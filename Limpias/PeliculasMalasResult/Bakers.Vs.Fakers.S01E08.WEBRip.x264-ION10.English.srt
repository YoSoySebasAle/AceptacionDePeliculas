
im michele
from davis california
and i am a professional baker
im percy from oak ridge
new jersey
and i am a professional baker
im jennifer
from los angeles california
and i am a professional baker
im henry from alameda
california
and i am a professional baker
hang on the fun
is about to begin
four bakers are here
to do battle
golden-brown delicious
two are amazing amateurs
do i look like i need help
hey have you got an
easy-bake oven down there
and two are professionals
lovely
out of this world
but only they know
their true identities
their mission
just winnin a bunch of money
outbake the competition
if a professional baker wins
they take home $0000
that sounds fancy
but if an amateur is able
to fake out the judges
i didnt wanna stop eating it
youre a baker
and take down the pros
pssh pssh
they walk away
with 5 grand
wow
bada-bing bada-boom
are you a baker
or a faker
i
am
a
what
what
no way
i dont believe it
welcome to
bakers vs fakers
whoo
let do this
there are two rounds
of competition here
in round  it my choice
uh-oh
today youre going to be
baking
cheesecake
nice
i love cheesecake
hmm
cheesecake definitely takes
a lot longer
to cook than your regular cake
and kind of have to be careful
in the timing of it
even a home baker
can make a decent cheesecake
but it takes a real pro
to make a cheesecake using
popcorn
popcorn
yeah
are we going to a movie or what
popcorn
popcorn in cheesecake
i got to make this work
we have buttered popcorn
cheddar popcorn chili popcorn
caliente
whoo
bacon popcorn
that the one right there
and unpopped popcorn
youve got 45 minutes
on the clock
you ready
ready
you sure
absolutely
okay
get baking
behind you
all right guys
popcorn in cheesecake
if you did
a new york-style cheesecake
with a lot of cream cheese
as a good support system
with eggs
let it hang out while
you figure out the popcorn
you could get somewhere
with that i think
there definitely
technique to it
but it also kind
of an easy dessert
i feel like a baker
would maybe hug the shoreline
a little bit more and let
the cheesecake really shine
are you saying bakers are safe
yeah
come on
i live on the wild side
oh my god
i mean to me youre baking
cheesecake in 45 minutes
they have to bake it
at a higher-temperature oven
i mean you could make
a no-bake cheesecake
all right
what would a baker
do with popcorn
with popcorn it all about
the aromatherapy
i want to feel like
im in a movie theater
maybe a pro will
pop fresh popcorn
and make caramel corn
it going to take
a real baker to figure out
how to get that real
popcorn essence and flavor
and not give us a mushy
disgusting mess
stay
i kind of describe myself
as a little bit a-dork-able
im generally just kind of silly
and try to have fun with things
let see
my personality gets reflected
in my baking style
i like to try to do something
a little different
in how something presented
i like to have fun
with the things that i do
there we go baby
i am making a cheesecake parfait
with a bacon popcorn shortbread
and caramel bacon sauce
so the first thing
im going to do
is start the no-bake cheesecake
got cream cheese
im doing a no-bake cheesecake
because i dont have to worry
about the possibility of it
not setting up
i know it a safe bet
i add cream cheese
and a little lemon juice
look at jennifer kitchen
she doing
a non-bake cheesecake
and i think that smart
it such a fast way
to reduce the time
that you need to spend
actually making the custard
now if she not a baker
i dont know who is
let get some of that
cheesecake filling in here
ive been baking since i could
pretty much reach the counter
i was a fat kid
i wanted to learn
how to make sweets
i picked up the bag of chocolate
chips and read the recipe
and you know i figured it out
and ive just grown from there
put you aside
oh oh my goodness
you all right over there
yeah
just dropping popcorn
trying to throw you off
even though
im a small-town girl
i go big and bold
with my baking
let go here
im using my favorite butter
i started baking just being
in the kitchen
with my grandmother
she would spend hours with me
coming up with different recipes
that we could enter
in the state fair
and after that i was hooked
it going
churros and caramel corn
always take me
back to my childhood
so today im making a cheesecake
with caramel popcorn
im going to use
the buttered popcorn
in my graham cracker crust
and then im going to use
the unpopped popcorn
to make my caramel popcorn
and then garnish it
with a cinnamon churro
all right
and the first thing
i need to do
is start my churro base
churro time
a churro is a fried pastry dough
rolled in cinnamon and sugar
as a child
i would go to the fair
and you got to have that churro
to walk around with
all right
i put the dough into
a piping bag
and get over to the hot oil
almost there
michele churros
look delicious
come on baby
come on
but her churros seemed
very soft to me
she might have put too
many eggs in the batter
and when you do a churro
it got to be so tough
you can barely
even squeeze it out of the bag
michele is a faker
theyre going to be good
bacon popcorn
my motto is
never trust a skinny chef
so i try to follow that
as you can tell
yep definitely bacon
im going to be making
a maple cheesecake
with a bacon popcorn crust
and then garnish it
with a candied bacon
who doesnt love bacon right
my personal baking style
is the balance
that i can create
between two ingredients
so i think i got this
im going to win this
competition
bring it buddy
you dont want my children
to starve do you
family everything to me
i wouldnt be where
im at today without them
all right
baking definitely my passion
and i feel like
it shows through
i baked my first cake
when i was 0
my mom was in
a boating accident
and when i found
out what happened
i went into the kitchen and
started looking at her recipes
i said you know what im
going to make a cake for her
and ive been doing
it ever since
first thing i need to get
done make the crust
grind up the graham cracker
and the bacon popcorn
to add texture to the base
figure wed put it
in the crust to give it
that popcorn flavor
look at henry
he grinding up
the popcorn the butter
he pressing that down
to make a crust
it is going to be
crisp and buttery
and perfect baker move
good good good
second thing im going to do
is the cheesecake batter
i need to cream the cheese
then add the maple
add the maple syrup
it going to add
some sweetness
and then add the eggs
i picked two simple ingredients
maple and bacon
but when they come together
it becomes this
salty-sweet-tasting cheesecake
in they go
the next step i need to work
on the candied bacon
i want to make sure
that the maple
and bacon flavors
will definitely shine through
im baking with bacon
the next step -
i brush maple on to the bacon
and add some of the crushed
bacon popcorn to add texture
in the oven it goes
henry got the bacon baking
in the oven at the same time
as the cheesecake
mm-hmm
could actually infuse
the flavor of the bacon
i was thinking about that
and a little bit of smoke
in there as well
it a definite baker move
okay
come on p-dubs
come on p-dubs
i would consider myself
very competitive
im not trying
to be braggadocious here
but ive been around
the block a few times
and you know these new kids
im not really concerned
about them
we can do this
we can do this
my style of baking
is spicy and sweet together
so today im making
a chocolate cheesecake
with a chili popcorn crust
come on percy
come on
the first thing i know
i got to do is the crust
that going to be the base
so ive got to grind
the popcorn melt the butter
put that into the springform pan
because i have to make
individual servings here
okay
im parbaking this crust
because i want my crust
to be stiff at the bottom
percy is using
a springform or mold
so he can serve the cheesecake
without any walls
that a baker
and he parbaking his crust
so that it crispy
and his popcorn
doesnt get soggy
trust me baker
come on come on
come on come on
growing up as a kid
we enjoyed popcorn in my house
i was the oldest of 4 children
so i knew
that if i wanted something
really good
i had to go make it myself
so i started baking
at this point my wife and i
we have two wonderful children
and three lovely granddaughters
i just want to win
this for them
in here for 5 to 8
i dont know who the baker
and who the faker
im pretty confused
theyre all so good
for me the bakers
are henry and michele
i think michele
is being creative
her cinnamon churro
it going to go so great
with the popcorn
it going to be very flavorful
and henry for me
has been the most ambitious
in this competition
he is trying the most
creative use of popcorn
how your cheesecake
cooking in there
it going
oh henry
i thought henry was a baker
but i just changed my mind
why
how many times is henry
going to open the oven
and let all the heat out
how is his cheesecake
going to be cooked
i think henry looks
like a faker
oh youre just totally
switching sides
so youre flipping
say it
just say it
i am am i wrong
youre wrong
youre wrong
we can do this
we can do this
oh
splash zone
are you a baker
or are you a faker
i
am
a
what
what
no way
popcorn come to mama here
i have my no-bake cheesecake
filling
so the next thing im getting
going is the shortbread
i want to use bacon popcorn
because it going to be
like a nice savory note to go
with the cheesecake filling
which is actually going
to be a little tart
there we go
there we go
jennifer looks like she got
some kind of shortbread
very smart
that shortbread can add sweet
and dense texture
that i really welcome
in a cheesecake
yes yeah
baker all the way
okay but when you have
a wet filling
like you have in a cheesecake
you need the crust to be dried
out and crisp on its own
or youre just going
to get straight sloppy mess
a shortbread crumble
is very fatty
so it going to stay soggy
i think that
a huge faker move
were in a good place here
we got bacon on high
oops
the last thing i need
to make is the caramel sauce
got to get a little
caramel going here
i want to give this
my special twist
so im going to add
little bits of bacon
no bacon left behind
it going to add some texture
and who doesnt love bacon
i love bacon
smells good
i smell bacon
yes maam
jennifer is cooking bacon
and then using the bacon
to put into her caramel sauce
to accentuate the smokiness
in her sauce
i love that
that a baker
we got this right
got a couple tricks
up my sleeve
now that the churros are done
im working on
my graham cracker crust
all right popcorn
i think the buttered popcorn
will add a little bit of salt
and a little bit of the butter
flavor to the crust
so i pulse those together
smells good in here
now i need to get
going on my cheesecake
i pour the cream cheese
into my mixing bowl
so i can get it nice and fluffy
and then im going
to add condensed milk
to add some sweetness
time to get these in the oven
and then im going to scoop
the cheesecake mixture
into mason jars
so that the cheesecakes
cook faster
all right
next i want to concentrate
on my caramel popcorn
change it up a little bit
by just popping my own popcorn
i get to create whatever
flavor i want with it
and the caramel will be
a perfect balance
to my cheesecake
yummy
next i get the caramel
coated onto the popcorn
they didnt have
my favorite caramel
i had to make it myself
every component michele making
has so much sugar in it
she is not salting her popcorn
and i think as a baker
you understand that balance
between salty and sweet
she a faker
doing good
yours baking yet
oh it almost done
what are you doing over here
youre supposed to be baking
dont be coming over
here for some tips
i pull my cheesecakes
out of the oven
and i put the cheesecakes
in the freezer
so i can let them cool down
hopefully they set in time
if i serve them
a warm cheesecake
it going to taste
more like a custard
and the whipped cream
will just melt off
this is going to work
im going to make it work
and i have no backup plan
you got to keep it
chilled you know
here my baker move for henry
his cheesecakes are already
out of the oven
and he giving them
time to settle
because if he adds
whipped cream on top
it not going to just melt
into a pool of cream
i need that prize money
come on now
i feel pretty good
we can do this
we can do this
so now i need to make my
cheesecake batter cream cheese
flour and eggs into all this
percy he just looks confident
he so zen right
oh
uh-oh
splash zone
all righty then
all right
that was such good timing
i still think percy is a baker
ive done that so many times
focus here percy
you know what you need to do
chocolate
im putting in cocoa powder
because chocolate and the heat
from the chili popcorn
work well together
they just bounce off each other
come on p-dubs
percy is pouring
a chocolate batter
he not pouring them very high
which i think
is a real baker move
it will be cooked in time
were almost a finished product
now im making the topping
for my cheesecake
im going to use
that same chili popcorn
just to get that crunch factor
a few more minutes
few more minutes
two minutes left
alex who are your two bakers
i think my bakers
are jennifer and percy
percy with the prebaked
crust sign of a baker
and jennifer really
infusing flavor very smartly
and i think a no-bake
cheesecake brilliant
i think she chose
something foolproof
like a baker would
daphne
my bakers are still
henry and michele
michele is our only person
in this kitchen
making her own popcorn
and the mason jars -
such a fast and easy way
to make this cheesecake
bake evenly
and i think that henry
he is trying
the most
creative use of popcorn
henry put the popcorn
in his crust
and he adding more popcorn
on top of the bacon
to really crisp it up
henry is such a baker
let go
0 9 8 7 6
5 4 3 2
stop your work
nice job
so everything in place
i think the candied bacon
will kind of give you
that sweet-savory taste
that will give me the edge
that i need to win
bakers and fakers
i gave you 45 minutes
to make cheesecake
using popcorn
it time to face the judges
percy what did you make for us
i made a chocolate cheesecake
with a chili-popcorn crust
honestly i was worried
that the chili
and the chocolate would kind
of kill the idea of popcorn
but it has that popcorn flavor
and that nice heat
from the chilis
i do have a lot of
unpopped kernels of popcorn
hmm
and id almost
call this cheesecake
underbaked in the center
percy the best thing
on this plate
for me was actually this
like toffee crisp
on the bottom
it still is crispy
it still crunchy
and really holds up
to all the wetness on top of it
but the cheesecake didnt
hit the mark for me
it is undercooked in some spots
jennifer
i did a cheesecake parfait
with a bacon-caramel sauce
and the bacon-popcorn
shortbread
so jennifer look
i love your cheesecake filling
it tart and not too sweet
also a brilliant move
because everything else
layered on here
does have its own sweetness
and i think that was
a smart balance
but the shortbread crumb
at the bottom
for me wasnt as successful
because it a very wet crumb
and i think when you have
so many layers of wet
you actually are craving
something drying at the bottom
yeah
the caramel and the bacon
is just so good
that combination is dynamite
if i were in a conversation
with somebody eating this
i would stop
you lose me a little
with your crumble
topping in the bottom
you chose a glass like this
i got to get all the way down
i mean i got to go to
the sub-subbasement
yeah
to get the crust
of my cheesecake
michele
yes
what did you make
i made a cheesecake
with caramel popcorn
and a cinnamon churro
your cheesecake
is beautifully cooked
really soft creamy luscious
and your crumb is the most
satisfying in its texture
with the dryness of it playing
so nicely with that
luscious cheesecake topping
but your churro to me
tastes like a cream puff
that was deep-fried
and then rolled
in cinnamon sugar
it doesnt have that
sort of yeasty-dough taste
that i associate with churros
i like your cheesecake
thank you
in terms of texture
and baking and execution
and you popped your own popcorn
youre the only one
the unique chewiness
of freshly popped popcorn
it really good
but i think overall
the popcorn a little sweet
this popcorn really needed salt
okay
henry
yes
what did you make for us
i made a maple-bacon
popcorn cheesecake
im getting a lot of the flavor
of the popcorn
particularly the crust
it packed
it got that
compressed feeling
it almost like a cookie
but your cheesecake
is undercooked
and when i eat
the bacon weirdly
the taste of the uncooked egg
comes out in the smoke
of the bacon
the flavoring of this
custard is fantastic
i love this combination
of maple and bacon
your custard is so sweet
and so powerfully flavorful
that i like it even better
when it blended
with this very neutral cream
did you want your
bacon to be crispy
yes
you did
i think the idea to put the
popcorn on top was a clever one
but i do think
it would have been
a more satisfying pairing
if this had been
a crispier bacon
thanks henry
thank you
and i want to thank
all of you guys
now comes the hard part
the judges need to deliberate
my dish it definitely isnt
as cooked as i wanted it to be
if i go home right now
i dont know how im going
to face my family
theyre going to be
so disappointed in me
and most of all im going
to be disappointed in myself
bakers and fakers
now it time to find out
who won the round
who going home and who
that person really is
alex
the winner of this round is
michele
yay
thank you
the texture of your custard
the crust underneath
it really came together
and we really liked that you
used both the ready-made popcorn
and you popped your own fresh
good job
thank you
i just won round
are you kidding me right now
daphne please tell us
who made
the second-best cheesecake
jennifer
well done
well done jennifer
good job jennifer
youre safe
okay judges
we are down to
your bottom two bakers
alex please tell us
who moving on to round 2
henry
yes
good job man
thank you
unfortunately percy that means
youve been eliminated
but before you go
tell us are you a baker
or are you a faker
i am
a
faker
oh
oh
get out of here
that some cheesecake
for a faker
what do you do for a living
many folks in new york
know me from being
on gospel music radio
in new york city for many years
no way
what i love about radio
is that it takes me
into people worlds
im percy williams
on your radio
thank you very much
for listening new york
new jersey and connecticut
i get a chance to inspire them
and i get that same feeling
while baking
keep it locked where it at
youre enjoying music
for your spirit
and nowadays i bake for family
i bake for friends
i like the happiness that
i see on people faces
when they enjoy something
that i baked in my kitchen
so how would you describe your
dessert in your radio voice
that was brotha percy
chocolate cheesecake
with a beautiful
chili popcorn crust
enjoy
i love it i love it
thank you percy
hello bakers and faker
im giving you the freedom
to bake whatever you want
yay
as long as you
incorporate
marshmallows
oh
oh
mm marshmallow
is so sweet
and it really can
overpower your dish
so i am not happy
about this ingredient
ugh okay
we got freeze-dried
marshmallows
vanilla marshmallows
coconut marshmallows
peppermint marshmallows
and marshmallow cream
45 minutes
on the clock you ready
ready
yes
get baking
whoo
all right guys
what do you think
of marshmallows
i like this ingredient
because you can play with it
yeah i immediately
thought of toasting them
kind of hoping that someone
who a baker explores
that idea of the toasted
almost-burned marshmallow
and the goo
i love marshmallows melted
into hot cocoa
if you make hot chocolate
and throw the marshmallows in
that a cop-out
for anybody who had
a hot chocolate
at the bus station
there something endearing
about that to me
totally
the baker will know
that marshmallow itself
is just pure sugar
and we want to see
a little bit of bitterness
that i think will carry the
marshmallow flavor a long way
for me i would
definitely go for salt
i would go peanut butter
i think marshmallow and peanut
butter pair beautifully
maybe a carrot cake
and then make the filling
with the marshmallow cream
so i guess loser
buying drinks tonight
all right
im very embarrassed
that my cheesecake
was undercooked
but making it
through motivates me
more to kill it
in the second round
is that carrots
it carrots
what
so for round 2
im going to be
making a carrot cake
with a cream cheese
marshmallow frosting
im baking carrot cake
my wife my number-one fan
so im going to make this
carrot cake to honor my wife
henry making a carrot cake
that a great idea
im a sucker for carrot cakes
so i really love the texture
of the grated carrots
in the cake
it a risky move
not everyone does
like carrot cake
and im obsessed
plenty of time
my strategy for this round
is to get the cake in the oven
as soon as i can
and to stack the cakes
so the cakes will hold up
to the cream cheese frosting
all right
i start mixing the oil
the sugar and the eggs
and then i get the dry
ingredients together
make sure it exact
and then fold
in the shredded carrots
get that all set
and stick it in the oven
i got it
now that that in
i start making
the cream cheese frosting
cheese
im going to use
the marshmallow cream
in the cream cheese frosting
to give it the sweetness
and hopefully
thatll shine through
marshmallows and carrots -
two things that i dont think
would ever go well
but i can make this happen
henry doing
a marshmallow
cream cheese topping
i think it going to be sweet
why
the yin and the yang
with carrot cake
is that snap you get when
you eat the cream cheese
and if it too marshmallowy
it going to miss that tang
i agree with that
that a faker
i have to tell you
i am kind of excited
about a marshmallow-flavored
frosting
i hope he torches it
i hope he gives it some nice
like deep dark
golden-brown bitterness
which is going to play
this cake even more savory
than a traditional
carrot cake would be
baker move
in we go
there we go
youre talking
to yourself over there
i can make anything i want
so i want to make something
that reminds a lot
of people of childhood
i am making peanut butter
and marshmallow cream pies
and peanut brittle
okay
im using almond flour
to make these
little pie crusts
sugar
but because of
the high fat content
it takes a little bit
longer to bake
i just want to get those in the
oven as quickly as possible
want to grease that first
i put a little bit of butter
on the bottom of the jars
to make sure they dont stick
get a little bit
of that dough in there
jennifer is making
an almond crust
and she packing it
in those small jelly jars
i feel like weve
seen ground-up
baked crust already
this competition
that a faker move
mm
off you go
time to make some candy
peanut brittle was
the first candy
i learned how to make
with my dad
so i need to get that
started with some sugar
and some corn syrup
and im using salted
roasted peanuts
come on baby cook for me
ah
so jennifer has a candy
thermometer out
baker all the way
it definitely a baker
baking a science
you cant eyeball it
there we go
it would be really nice
to win the money
i havent been able
to see my dad for years
because it expensive
to take time off
and go and visit him
that looks beautiful
how many can i fit in my hand
whoo
im not a big fan
of marshmallows
they are so sweet
but that what always
goes in hot cocoa
and hot cocoa reminds me
of sitting around the fire
with my grandma
all right
here we go
so i am baking
a hot cocoa cupcake
with marshmallow buttercream
filling
im like making
a mess over here
the first thing i need to do
is get my batter made
all right
im shaving the chocolate down
so it will melt a lot faster
i decided to add a little hint
of espresso in there
to bring the chocolate out more
i love that michele
is using espresso
to enhance her chocolate flavor
i think that
a real baker move
going to taste
like grandma house
this recipe comes directly
from my grandma
it got such
a deep chocolate taste
i know it going to take it
to the next level
i want to win this competition
in memory of my grandmother
she taught me everything i know
and i really want to show
how far ive come
and how proud my grandma
would be of me today
i am going in the oven
here we go
i check on my crust
i had put a little bit of butter
on the bottom of the jars
to make sure they didnt stick
they turned out
a little buttery
when the crusts
come out of the oven
that butter has seeped up
so i had little pools of hot
butter on top of the crust
oh man
check out jennifer
soggy and greasy crust
it is a disaster
i dont want the judges
biting into a chunk of butter
i might have to make this again
they turned out
a little buttery
when the crusts
come out of the oven
i had little pools of hot butter
on top of the crust
i might have to make this again
but i dont have enough time
to start over
well clean you up
so given the time frame
im going to stick to my guns
and stay with what ive made
there we go
so i have to try
to soak up that butter
let go cool you off
that my timer
so i take the cake
out of the oven
and set them in the freezer
got a hot pan coming through
this definitely is a huge risk
that im taking
because it could ruin
the texture of the cake
but at this point im panicking
because i need to get
these cakes cooled
so that they can set up in time
henry immediately put the cake
in the refrigerator
after it came out of the oven
i think that really compromised
the last few minutes of baking
i feel like it not done
that a faker move
and this
next im going to toast some
almonds to give it some texture
i think im the one that going
to be winning today
so i stick them in the oven
almost done
every year i make my wife
a birthday cake
and it carrot cake
so the last thing i want to do
is melt some chocolate
and write
happy birthday on the plate
look at henry
watch him cut this
parchment paper
watch him fold it
he making his own
points right now
i mean who is this person
he a mathematician or a baker
he a calligraphy teacher
who does greeting cards
i hope these come out
let go stick you
in the chiller
ive got the crust
and the brittle in the cooler
now im going to work
on the peanut butter mousse
and just salt here
little vanilla
then im going to whip
some cream to a soft peak
okay
there we go
and then i fold that whipped
cream into the peanut butter
i like that jennifer
is folding cream
into her peanut butter mixture
to keep it light and fluffy
okay
jennifer is definitely a baker
this last one
the next thing i need to start
is the marshmallow cream
i pipe it on top
of the peanut butter mousse
okay
ooh she getting a torch out
watch out everyone
playing with fire
i want to brûlée
the tops a little
all right
look at what jennifer doing
like that to me
is a faker move
the cream it wasnt
transformed at all
jennifer really just you know
took it out of the jar
and put it onto the plate
perfect
toasting really changes
the flavor of a marshmallow
i think this dish is going
to impress the judges
there we go
check my cupcake
almost
now that the cupcakes
are in the oven
i want to start
on my marshmallow buttercream
ooh this stuff sweet
i want to use
that marshmallow cream
because it already melted
down and ready to go
all right
what a mess
if i dont balance
that marshmallow cream
with enough butter
it might make it way too sweet
and overpower the chocolate
come on baby
i want to get my ganache going
so when the cupcakes are ready
i can just dip them
all right
im adding a little bit
of corn syrup
to give it a nice shine
i think she probably
making a ganache frosting
michele adding corn syrup
to her chocolate chips
to make sure
it glossy and smooth
you do want a bitter
chocolate topping
on what is going to be
an extremely sweet
sugar bomb of a cupcake
i think that
a really baker move
i agree
ganache is done
all right
i get my cupcakes
out of the oven
come on baby
i want to use the fondant
to make a little handle off
the side of the cupcake
everything got to be edible
she making some decorations
i dont like that
what does fondant have
to do with marshmallow
there a lot of frills
on michele cooking
im in it to win it
two minutes left
alex who are your two bakers
im going to go with jennifer
because of her concept
youre so pretty
love the toasted and burned
edges of marshmallows
so all she had to do was
toast that marshmallow
and you went hook
line and sinker
it doesnt take much for me
to get on your team
it doesnt take much
for me to jump ship
and michele did
the pro pastry bag
twisting the top to get
all the air out of it
and adding the corn syrup
to the glaze
was a really nice touch
that makes the chocolate
shiny and slick
that a total baker move
all right
daphne
i stay loyal to
the bitter bitter end
my bakers are henry and michele
michele has thought
of everything
her cupcakes are perfectly iced
and marshmallow is going
to feature prominently
in michele dish
no matter what
meanwhile my man henry
who ive been rooting for
from the beginning
i like to see henry cut rounds
out of his carrot cake
and doing a layering
of marshmallow frosting
it going to be
a very textural play
and that a baker move to me
okay guys
0 9 8 7 6
5 4 3 2
stop your work
yeah
drop the marshmallows
looking down at my dish
the presentation came out
exactly how i wanted
what it comes down to is flavor
im still a little concerned
if the marshmallow
going to come through
are you a baker or a faker
i
am
a
yes
no
yes
oh really
bakers and faker
you had 45 minutes
to bake anything you want
as long as it had
some marshmallows in it
but now you must
face the judges
henry whatd you do man
well i made a carrot cake
with a cream cheese
marshmallow frosting
that cake is kind of
inspired by my wife
it her favorite flavor
i figured id pay homage to her
henry you made
a really good cake
i really loved
the grated carrot texture
and i love
the happy birthday piping
the calligraphy was expert
but i think your cake
is borderline undercooked
and i think the cream cheese
in this frosting
overpower the marshmallow
i agree with you
i dont taste the marshmallow
in the frosting
but it is delicious
thank you
and i love the toasted almonds
they really give a great crunch
but they could have had
a little bit of salt on them
i just wish thered
been more marshmallow
thank you
michele what did you make
i made a hot-cocoa cupcake
with marshmallow filling
and then some mini
marshmallows on top
i think youve made
an amazing cupcake
thank you
the bitterness of the chocolate
and then we get
this gooey filling
it just perfect
great
but you made a number
of components
the fondant i think
this stuff is beautiful
but it just didnt
taste like marshmallow
michele the execution
on this dish is perfect
the crumb is so moist
it is so decadent
and rich and chocolaty
the glossy ganache on top
perfect
i will say this
those little mini marshmallows
torching them a little bit
i think
would have worked
really nicely as well
it changes the texture
and the flavor of a marshmallow
right
jennifer
whatd you make for us
i made a peanut butter
and marshmallow cream pie
with an almond crust
and a peanut brittle
the brittle is delicious
it like an avalanche
of all the nuts
i mean i love it
but when i get the peanut butter
and the almond crust
it tough for the marshmallow
to survive the street fight
it just doesnt taste
like marshmallows
okay
i do think
this peanut butter filling
is really nicely balanced
it smooth
it creamy
it the right sweetness
so good
thank you
what undid the dessert
for me was actually
the almond crust on the bottom
okay
the crust ended up
being a little bit wetter
than i had hoped
what ends up happening is
when you have a really fatty
wet dessert on top
of a really fatty wet crust
there isnt the differentiation
that you need to really have
the perfect mouth effect
okay
now comes the hard part
the judges got to deliberate
man im nervous about the cake
not being cooked long enough
you know there
so much at stake
winning with this recipe
that has been with me
since i was a child
would be the most special thing
i could even imagine
i think the flavors are great
and there a really
good balance going on
i feel like that

inside this envelope
