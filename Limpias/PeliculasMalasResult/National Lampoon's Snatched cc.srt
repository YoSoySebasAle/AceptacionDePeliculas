we love you
you are the man
you are the one and only
so come on don’t be so damn
hard on yourself
i appreciate the support guys
but i am getting this
taken care of
i am getting back to normal
back to normal
okay boys ante up
five cards
jacks or better
i mean it’s not like things
have really changed
you look the same to me
yeah you’re as ugly
as always
laughing
yeah i mean it’s not like
it’s a turn-on
what
you having a--a snatch
it’snot--that’s not i guess
a turn-on or anything
yeah yeah
too ugly to fuck
i mean there are
some guys that you know
they had a snatch
i mean you--you know
i don’t know you know
-you lost me
-be grateful
i’m just saying there are
some pretty guys that maybe
just maybe you might
have to consider
what are we
in a turkish prison
well i’m not saying
you’d bypass halle berry
to get to them
but say you’re--
you’re stranded
on a desert island
-like gilligan’s island
-exactly
-i’d do ginger or mary anne
-me too
but what if
they weren’t there
mrs howell
definitely mrs howell
good call old but rich
okay okay
but let’s say
you’re the skipper
and it’s just mr howell
and gilligan
okay guys stop okay
stop
what’s the question
if gilligan had a snatch
is what i’m saying
that’s the option
and we’re moving
right along
okay forget it
-matt damon
-huh
what about matt damon
if matt damon and i
were on a desert island
and he had a snatch
maybe
matt damon hmm
hmm matt damon
is awfully pretty
-very
-agreed
matt damon is
a very pretty man
well i’d do matt damon on
the condition he had a snatch
jesus guys
so you’re saying
we would--
we would bang matt damon
if he had a pussy
-you’ve done worse
-true
yeah matt damon
on a desert island
with a snatch
well i would have
to vote yes
i need to use the head
so it’s agreed
if one of us were trapped
on a desert island
and the only other person
on said desert island
was one very pretty actor
by the name of matt damon
and this said actor
matt damon
had no male genitalia
but in fact a snatch
we would therefore fornicate
with said pretty actor
matt damon
-yes
-if he’d have me
frank jesus guys
is it too much to ask
when you use the toilet
put the seat down
toilet seat slams
woman
i’m sorry but he’s not
in his office
-when do you expect him
-i really can’t
-frank baum
-doctor
what brings you here
i was wondering if you’d like
to give me my penis back
i’d love to
-great when can we schedule
-i can’t
what the hell
i thought
i would love to
but since your operation
i’ve lost my license to perform
surgery in the united states
i might go to bangkok
no no you’re the one
that got me
into this situation
in the first place
i was supposed to donate
my kidney not my--
frank maybe it’s not
such a bad thing
why don’t you take it out
for a test drive
a what
you know take it around
the block a few times
you might like it
no no i don’t wanna test it
i want my dick back
you’d have to talk
to dr weller about that
who--who’s dr weller
i am the head
of the hospital’s
gender reassignment department
and you are
i’m frank baum
of course you

i have a vagina
and a very nice one
i might add congratulations
thank you
but i don’t want it
you should’ve thought
of that before you got it
-what
-tell me
did you give serious
consideration to this
before you had your
gender reassignment
no never for a second
well that seems rather silly
don’t you think
no no no
there’s been a terrible mistake
okay let me guess
your mother was overbearing
and your father was distant
you loved to play with dolls
and put on your mother’s pretty
dresses and high-heeled shoes
every morning
when she went off to work
-never
-not even once
-never
-hmm
doctor if we could
just schedule
the operation
and give it all back
no
-no
-no
-why not
-well it’s not that easy
we don’t just change
someone’s gender willy-nilly
-oh i--i--
i beg to differ you do
-don’t
-do
-don’t
-do did well you did with me
-well i didn’t
-well the other doctor
he did
-ah yes
he doesn’t work here anymore
in fact he’s no longer
even a doctor
i know he told me
-this is all so sad
-i know
not you him
he’s been a surgeon
his whole life
now it’s all down the drain
no more pension
no retirement in florida
wait i’m the one
who was screwed here
-he lost his license
-i lost my dick you prick
whoa hey hey hey hey
i can’t work with you
if you’re gonna be hostile
i’m hostile because you
won’t give me my dick back
i don’t have it
i just wanna be a man again
-are you a misogynist
-of course not i love women
as long as you don’t
have to be one
tell me are you the same way
with blacks as well
-blacks blacks
do you like blacks
-of course
yeah as long as you don’t
have to actually be black
-no no
-would you rather
be a black man
-or a black woman
-neither
my point exactly
i’m sorry you’re just not ready
to be transformed
and until you are i can’t
in all good conscience
approve you
for gender reassignment
this is crazy
you’re crazy
that is exactly the kind of
attitude that is going to delay
your gender reassignment
procedure
oh my god okay
what do i have to do
just--just tell me
what i need to do what
when you are ready to
inhales exhales
heal yourself and calmly
progress down
the path toward gender
reassignment
like a nice calm normal
sane human being
then we can talk
until then i have other
patients to see
this is not over
not over
deep voice
it’s never over
do you suffer from sneezing
and runny eyes every spring
think maybe it’s pollen
or spring fever

you may be suffering
from asphaltitis
indistinct chatter
of the nose and sinus area
caused by the microscopic
-hey frank
-yup
-can i talk to you
-yeah give me a minute
i’m almost done
now
sure what’s so important
there seems to be
a little problem
-with what
-with you
me with what
there’s been a few complaints
from some of the other
gym members
what like--
was the equipment
not wiped down
it’s kind of a different
problem than that
we’ve gotten a few
complaints about you using
the men’s locker room
i’m a man
yeah but with a vagina
and so technically
you shouldn’t even be in there
what you want me to use
the women’s locker room
you’re not supposed
to be in there either
so you don’t want me
to use the men’s locker room
you don’t want me to use
the women’s locker room
what kind of discrimination
is that
it’s just making some people
feel being uncomfortable
you’re saying you don’t want me
to work out here anymore
yes yes that’s what
i’m saying
i’m sorry
scoffs

it’s unreal man
just unreal
but it’s in here
right here
nothing could take
that away from me
and no matter what
you see here
or what body parts
aren’t here
i’m here
i’m right here
yo
you guys have a lot
in common you know
nah i’m just
a sportscaster
you know a lot of people
don’t know this
but hunter was instrumental
to saving lot of lives
that mine went off
right under him
and it took everything
he crawled with
what he had left
he went down and radioed
for support
that tough sob
but let me tell you something
i’ve been in combat
and i’ve seen a lot
but i never saw anything
more beautiful
than you being wheeled
into that operating room
ready to give
one your kidneys
you went in there
to save a man’s life
not for pay
or patriotic duty
but just because
you’re a man
you’re brave son
real brave
okay
so they took
your junk instead
but that doesn’t change
why you were there
having a penis
makes you a male
but it doesn’t make you a man
you’re a man
