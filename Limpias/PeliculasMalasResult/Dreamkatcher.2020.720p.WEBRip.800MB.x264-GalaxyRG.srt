let me show ya
um josh come on
im not a baby
no youre not a baby
and did you know
that the spirits
wander through these woods
they like to linger
in old barns
they visit you in your sleep
in your dreams
do you have bad dreams
cause a spirit trap
will catch em
listen shh

you know how dreams work
dont you

the shit out of you
hey language
josh dreams dont come
from out here alright
they come from in here
it just your mind way
of figuring out stuff
that going on in your life
so if youre having
some bad dreams
it means youre probably dealing
with some stuff that difficult
and you could talk about it
you dont want to talk about it
you could try drawing it up
you know if you can see it
sometimes it makes it a little less scary
helps you understand it
and maybe you can figure it out
in your real life
does that make sense
i guess
i want to tell you
something this is a secret
youre in control
okay so when
youre falling asleep
just think good thoughts
about your mom
you know think about some of
the good times that you guys had

a regular little guy
he was smart funny
was a little bit quirky
he liked odd things
he had a collection that
he called his special stuff
that had dead animal fur
bones dead bugs
his father would say
get rid of that junk
normal boys play sports
and they have friends
i was his friend
it was christmas
and i wanted to find the perfect present
and there was a yard sale
down the street
and i found that thing
this crazy woman said to me
whoever hangs it in their room
will be protected
from evil forever
i thought the perfect present
boy was i wrong
protect him from evil
it was pure evil
it devoured him
and then one day he followed
his parents into the woods
and this little boy
hacked them to death
came upon them
all hacked to pieces
except for noah
suddenly he he just
leapt at me like a wild animal
and he was waving this axe
screaming at the top of his lungs
make it get out
make it get out
and then he killed josh mom
once upon a time
there was a boy named josh
and he had a hatchet
as a psychotherapist
i can tell you
that kids have issues alright
and using science
we just need to treat them
with therapy or with medicine
and this voodoo bullshit
it doesnt help
it doesnt help anyone

that you just drop it
