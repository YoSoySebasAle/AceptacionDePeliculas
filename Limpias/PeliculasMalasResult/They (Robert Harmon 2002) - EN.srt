they hide in the
dark so you cant see them

julia stop
hey listen im not going to hurt you
im going to stay right here
honey listen hey
hey there nothing to be afraid of
how did i get here
you must have been sleepwalking
it nice to see
someone else born after 950
hey
so how did you know billy
we were friends since we were kids
im julia
right yeah um
billy talked a lot about you
um im sam
this this is my roommate
terry hi
hi
billy sam and i
were really close in college
yeah
you were with him werent you
the night that he
yeah
im sorry
did he say anything to you
nothing i could understand
it was all pretty incoherent
sort of like
maybe he was on something again
you know he was taking prozac
i guess it didnt work
excuse me
what
hey
i just wanted to apologize for
sam comment back there
the guy engages his mouth
before his brain sometimes
it okay im just a little
over-sensitive right now
we all are
so had you
seen much of billy recently
yeah until he moved
back here about 3 months ago
do you know what he
was trying to tell us with all this
maybe he was planning
for a really long camping trip
or that he was afraid of the dark
i know that feeling
you had night terrors as a kid right
did billy tell you that
yeah for a while
that was all he could talk about
in fact it is the reason
that him and sam and i met
we all hadem
what
it crazy huh
see we all got
really close freshman year
but it was only later that billy
told us he had sought us out
he was obsessed back then
and what about lately
hed come to me
recently a few times
babbling about how
we shared the same problem
how we need to stay in the light
i guess i shouldve
taken him more seriously
but i was so used
to billy acting crazy you know
it never occurred to me that
the same thing could happen to us
you are the string days collected
like tiny silk beads
and counted before sleeping
julia
hey baby welcome home
are you drunk
i prefer intoxicated
come on
im just having a couple of drinks
what with all the hostility
i had an accident
what
on the way home i had an accident
are you hurt
no
okay tell me what happened
i was driving out
in the middle of nowhere and
i thought something
ran out in front of me
so i had to slam on the brakes and
i nearly went off the road
did you hit the omething
i dont know
i dont think so
i thought i saw what
im just not
exactly sure what happened
okay well was it an animal
i dont think so
okay so whatd you hit an alien
i should have known
i should have known
oh hey
no i should have known
what do you want me to say
that you would make fun of me
i dont know
i just know
that something scared me
ive got my defense
the day after tomorrow
i just dont need to come home and
find you getting wasted
with your idiot roommates
look let me
tell you what ive been up to
there was a thirteen car pile-up
on the 80 last night
so for the past 24 hours ive been
cutting dead people out of their cars
there a difference between what
youve been through
and what ive been through
yours is in there
mine out here
dont get confused
about which is which
billy must have been writing
in this diary since childhood
so we thought you might
want to take a look at it
maybe you can make more
sense out of it than we could
it pretty deranged stuff
like this
saw them again
beneath my window in the alley
always in darkness and shadow
where do they come from
could it be that darkness
is their way in and out
origins incubus
bringers of nightmares
grendels lurking in the darkness
can only assume
that light is my savior
maybe it all in my head
the insane nightmare of a schizo
you dont seem
surprised by any of this
it a lot like the stuff he talked
about the night he died
it not too surprising that
he would write about it too
no i guess not it just that
we were wondering if
what
if youve had any
recent night terrors
yeah actually i have
us too
ever since billy killed himself
ive had this uneasy feeling
you know like im being
watched or something
i mean im 24 years
old and i walk in a dark room
and it like im 5 again
cmon you guys
weve all been through an
extremely traumatic experience
it only natural that
certain uncomfortable feelings
would be stirred up
you dont remember
remember what
how powerful those feelings were
what do you mean
when i was five
i watched my sister drown in a lake
where we used to spend our summers
right after i started to suffer
from terrible night terrors
there was one particularly bad night
i woke up screaming my head off
my parents finally
managed to get me to sleep
and a couple of hours later my
mother came back to check on me
and i was gone
they looked everywhere
in the attic in the basement
all over the house
my mother was hysterical
she thought id been kidnapped
or id run off or who knows what
then my father
went into the backyard
and he heard a noise in
the doghouse of all places
he stooped down looked in
and there i was huddled in the back
naturally he reached in and
that when i stabbed him in the eye
with a kitchen knife
i was convinced
he wasnt my father
that he was some
kind of demon coming for me
i was absolutely sure of it
i havent had that
feeling since i was a kid
but i have it now
and so does sam and
we thought you might too
julia
yes dr booth
i hardly recognize you
in fact i dont recognize you at all
but come on in
it hard to think of you
as that frightened little girl
who used to come in here
my god it been what
twenty years
twenty years
it a wonder im still around
so what have
you been doing with yourself
well actually im going
for my masters in psychology
psychology that wonderful
now tell me outside of studying
how are you doing
im not doing that well dr booth
that why i came to see you
i havent been sleeping that well
i think i had a recurrence
a recurrence of what
night terrors
what makes you say that
a few nights ago i woke up
in my bathroom totally disoriented
my boyfriend came to
help me and i attacked him
well it certainly
sounds like a night terror
it not unheard of in adults
but really quite abnormal
yes that right
night terrors can be part
of normal childhood development
but ive found that the most violent
and persistent cases
occur in children whove suffered
profound emotional trauma
if i recall you
came to see me shortly after
your father took his
own life isnt that right
yes
so your recent night terror
could possibly have been triggered
by an increase in stress or fatigue
am i far off
no no
julia why dont we schedule
a formal session
i dont usually treat adults
but since we have a history
you could come in here describe
the things youre going through
and well try to figure out
if it really is a recurrence
of night terrors
or if it something else
you scared the hell out of me
sorry
what do you think went through
billy mind when he did it
the bullet
i dont know terry the same thing
that goes through everybody mind
before they kill themselves
that they hate their life;
theyre better off dead than alive
blam blam blam
i wonder what it
like to get to that place
terry stop picking it
or it never going to heal okay
it not healing anyway i might
as well get some satisfaction
i think it getting worse
maybe it cancer
there is something seriously demented
about you do you know that
you know maybe
i shouldve gone to law school
like i said demented
look im going to go out
try to detox for a little bit
are you going
to be alright by yourself
yeah
sure
yeah
okay bye
got you
damn rats
understanding your child dreams
hello
hey julia how goes it
lousy
im still on chapter four in crowley
and i cant remember half the other
sources in my bibliography
well look at the bright side
if you flunk it only another 2
months of hell and another 20 grand
but it could be worse
how
im not sure exactly
hey listen kim will you call me later
make sure im still awake
okay bye
thanks bye
state mental health association

could somebody turn
the lights back on please
hello
open the door
please somebody help me
damn it
moore theory of discordance
postulates that subjects
when presented with evidence
hostile to their world view
experience
dissociative discordance
or fight or flight reflexivity
and discordance here is defined
as delusions of reality stemming
from childhood trauma
and a heightened
state of anxiety
yes sorry
by increasing the number of
familiar external stimuli
individuals will
well individuals will try
individuals experiencing
discordance will
would you please excuse me
yeah certainly
hey it julia
leave a message after the beep
julia come on
pick up i know youre there
im sorry about the other night
so consider this the official apology
besides i want to
hear how your defense went
i bet you knocked
em dead but i need specifics
so pick up the phone
alright i can take a hint
but im gonna harass you
until you call me back
hey it julia
leave a message after the beep
paul
hello
julia this is sam
oh hi
i need to talk to you
hello
hey it julia
yeah come on in
okay
hello
sam
depressing isnt it
look im sorry that i called you
i just figured that youd be the
only one that would understand
understand what
i mean you see it right
i dont know what i see
but you can feel it
you definitely feel that
something bad is happening right
yes
you see you do understand
terry missing
what do you mean missing
she didnt come home last night
the rec center
called me this morning
and they said that they found her
bag with all of her stuff in it
sam slow down maybe
maybe she just
forgot her stuff in her locker
and what left the
building in her bathing suit
did you call the police
yes i did
theyre not going to find anything
ive been studying billy diary
ever since we found it
you know i cant seem to do much
of anything else it like
sam
no wait wait just listen
okay now i cant make
sense of all of it but
i was taken to their world when i was
five and marked but it faded
they only mark kids
who have night terrors
listen to this
last week the mark reappeared
it means theyre coming for me
just listen to his last entry okay
i cant write much longer
the mark on my hand
keeps getting worse
i cant stand it
i pulled out
this thing they planted in me
sam billy was unstable
we know that
no
this is ridiculous
hed had problems since he was a kid
we all did
now dont you think it possible
that something that scared us as kids
has come back to collect us
what are you saying
i never saw billy mark
but i did see terry
and hers looked a lot like this
hi
hi
what your name
sarah
my name is julia
are you all by yourself
where your mom
heaven
do you work here
no
i dont either
im a patient
sarah do you have bad dreams
sometimes
what happens in your dreams
they come for me
who comes
they
why do they come for you
to eat me
does anything keep them away
lights
you think im crazy
no
why dont you tell me what
you think it all might mean
our night terrors may not have been
induced by emotional trauma at all
maybe something really did
come for us when we were kids
and planted something in us
and whatever it was it left a mark
just like that little girl
and now theyre coming back
yes and that why the marks
reappear so that they can find us
and take us back to the place in
our night terrors out of the light
i know how it sounds
julia you say you failed your thesis
defense with dr crowley
perhaps youd like to tackle this case
subject is suffering
post-traumatic stress
from witnessing the
suicide of a close friend
influenced by the erratic behavior
of two strangers
she allows herself to entertain
the paranoid schizophrenic delusions
of her dead friend
and why does she do that
because she feels
a sense of personal failure
and guilt that billy
that her friend died
and you are going to be
an excellent psychologist
ill see you on thursday
thank you dr booth
oh julia
if these demons were coming back
wouldnt you have the mark too
remind me what im looking for
like an infected mark-thing
little pinkish like the size of a dime
well nothing yet
but it early
paul this is serious
okay im sorry youre all done
no marks
you sure
double-checked trust me
not that im complaining you know
but whyd you need me to do that
i met these two friends
of billy at the funeral
and
well they both had marks like billy
and so i went to tell dr booth and
oh youre just
gonna think this is crazy
julia didnt we just search
your entire body and find nothing
so what have
you got to worry about
youre right
youre right
jesus
somebody
hey over here help
hey over here
come on
hey paulie were
going down to the
woah hello nurse
get out get out

but ill get over it
troy may not however
im sorry about
the last couple of days
hey you feel dont apologize for it
good night
ill see you tomorrow
and all for less than a dollar
what do you think of that
you cant beat that kind of value
as the power shortage
reaches critical levels
residents are asked to save
energy and turn off the lights
in an effort to avoid more rolling
blackouts this weekend
and in a related story officials
say the rolling blackouts
will have an effect
on emergency services provided
in the largest metropolitan hospital
this comes as another blow to the
already beleaguered medical center
as eleventh-hour talks broke
down today between doctors
and hospital administration
hospital spokesperson
jason hildin
stated that the doctor strike
is a foregone conclusion
this is getting ridiculous
on the lighter side
of civic news

i was in this bathroom and
because of the light
it has something to do with the light
i think that they cant be in the light
