i would have brought myself a
little something to poke on

i just wanted to
let you guys know
you need to be
extra careful okay
especially if you wander
out in the woods at night
the caretaker said
there a lot of bears
around this time of year
wouldnt look really good
on my review if one of you
come back dead or with a
huge bite out of your ass
dont even think about it
all right
tonight fair game guys okay
have fun whatever but let
not forget why were up here
we have our first
meeting tomorrow

ah good question
uh were up here because it
a simultaneous pat on the back
and kick in the
pants to be honest
the head honchos love
what were doing okay
that why were here
but theyre worried that
our shareholders
are going to get a little
bit antsy and jump ship
if our little growth
stock doesnt somehow
exceed next quarter forecast
rita
wed like to start by
getting everyone together
to help inspire team unity
oh and they want
to pick our brains
to see if we can figure out
ways to increase productivity
of course with the same
amount of resources
which is always nice
it only a couple
of meetings people okay
you pretty much have
the rest of the weekend
to do whatever you want
like get eaten by bears
rawr

other smart aleck remarks
does anyone have any
questions or comments

in the antichrist

you know i could
i just-why waste

so you can look at porn
whoa it is not my fault the
server crashes every time
i try and download
your sex tape
youre going to die
lira
children could you
come back to the table
all of a sudden came the thunder
of hooves rushing up the path
a dark figure in
a black cloak
rode it horse
toward the porch
the old man walked
down the front stairs
and the cloaked figure stopped
his horse just outside
the pool of light
that was being cast
by the lanterns
hung above the porch
the old man staggered back
shot twice once in the neck
and the other in his chest
the dark figure rose
up onto his horse
and fled down the lane
disappearing into the night
friends rushed to
the old man aid
but it was already too late
the first shot had bored
a quarter sized hole
now your chance
to a chamber--
what the hell are
you talking about
chicks get super turned
on when theyre scared
like you would know
trust me
both times i scored the chick
was either drunk or scared
i think one of the
times she was both
alright
hey hey zac
just in case
thanks tedi
do you guys mind
no
sorry it was just getting
really good dale
please continue
thanks
now as i was saying
so much blood
poured from the old man
wounds that a thick pool
formed underneath his head
he coughed once
and then again
the second being
a hideous gurgling
sound as though
two invisible hands
were choking the old
man to death
squeezing the very
life out of him
the sound sent a shiver
up the spines of everyone
who heard the old man
last dying breath
hey
dale ghost story
getting to you
oh yeah
im going to have
nightmares for weeks
here
i brought you some pinot
trying to get me liquored up
maybe
is it working
maybe
this is really good
compliments of mr sau
you know i was a little
taken back by him joining us
on our little retreat
here but um
now im starting to think it
might have its benefits
having a rich boyfriend
does have its advantages
are you sure
i wouldnt know
im a two buck
chuck type of girl
you okay
yeah
im all right
no
there something wrong
i see it in your eyes
oh
you can read my
eyes now can you
yeah i can
i bet you cant even tell
me what color they are
well
* she got eyes of
the bluest skies *
* as if they
thought of rain *
**and id hate to
look into those eyes *
* and see an
ounce of pain *
they are brown
i know im just
messing with you
and you stole that
from axl rose
how do you know he
didnt steal that from me
because youre
not that sensitive
i am sensitive dammit
as if axl rose is
mr sensitivity
hey im sure he a nice
guy once you get to know him
that like saying
he an asshole
but youll get to used to it
no it not
he once threw a girl
down a flight of stairs
well im sure he
had good reason to
yeah he did
because she wouldnt
sleep with him
that will do it
that is not funny
that is--
why why are you laughing
i am not laughing
i see that
damn you zac
why do you always have
this messed up way
of making me feel better
i dont know how you do it
are you going to tell me
what wrong
rita not back yet
are you sure
i thought she was just avoiding dale tale of the occult in there
im pretty sure zac
she been gone all day
have you told dale
no
i didnt want to spoil his fun
a whole hell of a lot of fun
should we go back in
if we have to
from that day on the servants
couldnt keep the porch clean
every few weeks a
damp pool of blood
would appear in the same spot
where the old man had died
they tried repainting
the porch several times
but the blood stain would
always bleed through
one night one of the
servants saw something
that caused him to go mad
folks said that the
house was haunted
by the angry spirit
of the old man
the house was sold
several times
but each time the
residents were driven out
by the horrible gasping
breaths of the old man ghost
and the hideous blood stain
that could never be removed
the house was eventually
abandoned until just last year
one year ago today in fact
when it was completely remodeled
and turned into tearlon lodge
youre so full of it dale
i had you going
i dont know i thought
the story was pretty good
up until the end because i
think i heard that one before
yeah
good one d
although i think
youve got to give
partial credit to joel
the wine definitely helped
yeah it something else
you have any more
yeah
i got a whole case of it
ill go get you some some more
let him get it himself
dont be a bitch babe

she might have just gone to
visit with the caretaker

prefers to live off the grid
well what if zac and
i go and look for her

off in the middle of the night
you could get lost or
fall in a bear trap

he tried to kiss me
he came out onto the porch
he looked like
something was wrong
so i went over to

and one thing led to another
i guess he took that as me
coming onto him or something
and it not the first
time it happened either
he does this all
the time at work
it disgusting
why dont you tell dale
i did the first
time it happened
it just my word against his
and dale likes him
everybody in the office does
including you
what the hell kind of a
person do you think i am
there something seriously
wrong with that guy
he on all kinds of medication
he literally scares me
i just didnt want to because
any trouble or anything
dont you trust me
i dont feel safe around him
hey im sorry okay
no

we cant just
leave her in there

big misunderstanding
investigators baffled by
brutal crime at a private
psychiatric hospital in the
mountains near tearlon lake
a female patient age nine whose
name cannot be disclosed
was allegedly attacked and brutally mutilated by a male patient
of the same age
according to the police report
most of the girl tongue
had been cut out
with a pair of
surgical scissors
registered sex offender
earl ray warren
who had been working as an
orderly at the tearlon lake
psychiatric hospital
was brought in
for questioning after
investigators discovered
shocking evidence of torture
deprivation and child abuse
renowned psychiatrist
dr herman rexif
has resigned as head
physician of the hospital
and has refused to
answer any questions
no charges have been
filed at this time
earl ray warren was
released from police custody
yesterday after the conclusion
of the month-long investigation
authorities could not produce
any evidence of wrongdoing
although warren age 46
admitted to many bizarre
and cruel methods of negative
reinforcement in the care
and treatment of children
including a chamber
known only as the box
a tiny metal cell where children
were placed in isolation
sometimes for days at a time
it was done only on the direct orders of the trained medical staff
