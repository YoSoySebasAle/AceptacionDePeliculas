ive seen a wedding once
where the bride was in love
with another man
at the last second
shortly before she said yes
he ran into the church
and yelled her name
till they both ran off
before that he locked the
wedding guests into the church
ive seen enough
and the whole class
is yelling yes miss
sit down we need to talk
i thought wed go to the movies
please no back-talking
very well
i once knew someone
who only could live by night
although he wasnt really alive
he prowled the night
and drank the blood of humans
until they became like him
at cockcrow he had to be at his home
because sunlight made him wither
or did he melt
he turned to ash
and im leaving
what if we leave together
why now all of a sudden
im taking a shower first
