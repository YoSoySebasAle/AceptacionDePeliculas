the ancient greeks
believed humans once had four arms
four legs and a single head
made of two faces
we were happy
complete
so complete that the gods
fearing our wholeness would quell
our need for worship cleaved us in two
leaving our split selves
to wander the earth in misery
forever longing
longing
longing
for the other half of our soul
it is said that when one half
finds its other
there an unspoken understanding
a unity
and each would know no greater joy
than this
of course
the ancient greeks
never went to high school
good hang out
whatever
or theyd realize
crap
we dont need the gods
to mess things up for us
if you ask me
people spend far too much time
looking for someone to complete them
how many people find perfect love
or if they do
make it last
more evidence of camus theory
that life is irrational
and meaningless
and that my friends is some
a-plus love philosophy right there
or a-minus if mrs g is in a bad mood
either way it an a or you dont pay
outside are the dogs the sorcerers
the immoral persons
and everyone who loves
and practices lying

im not good with words
but you know you love her
i know i think about her when i wake up
and when im doing my sprints
and when im eating my mom bratwurst
and when im saying my prayers
that just means youre stubborn
not that youre in love
no it love
love makes you screwy
dont you get screwy
no
this whole section needs
although that fry thing does sound good
a dangling modifier
oh i get it
get what
youve never been in love
you want a letter about love
ill write you a letter about love
one thatll make her fall in love with me
not storm off in a huff like youre doing
this isnt even american
how are you going to learn english
shh
best part
longing
longing for a wave of love
to swell up in me
you sealed it
no im sure it good
hushmo me
hey
hey
hey
she wrote back
i like wim wenders too

and whyd you cheat off him
i didnt cheat off of him
no i looked up plagiarize
i kind of cheated off him
i paid you
but this is good
how

it like a game
she like challenging us
but in a good way
so uh
were were still in the game
yep mm-hmm
we are so
yay
game on aster flores
game on
dear aster okay you got me
i sometimes hide behind
other people words
for one thing i know nothing about love
im 7
ive lived in squahamish my whole life
such a downer
it not a downer
a major downer
ask her to hang out
what exactly is
hanging out
you know uh hanging out
but like what do you do
munsky what up
uh uh confession
want to go to joey and hang out
yeah
i hang out with my friends
i keep my head down
im a simple
paulie
guy
this meat wont grind itself
which is to say
if i knew what love was
i would quote myself
right here man
people air weather
why would we ever leave
psst
in here
isnt this sacrilegious
she wrote back
dear paul
you know it takes  muscles to yawn
this is the sort of weird fact
i find myself recalling
to keep myself from
well yawning
we believe that god loves us
or showing anything i feel really
we believe blindly and
so yeah
i turn to other people words too
imagine how the right gravel
can change your life
sweetheart sit up straight please
like a lady
when youre a pretty girl
and i know it makes me sound conceited
but that why youre even writing me
right
when youre a pretty girl
people want to give you things
it would look so cute on you
what they really want
oh
is to make you like them
thanks
not like them as in i like you
but like them as in i am like you
like
so cute on you
oh
oh you you mean right now
mm-hmm
check me out check me out
im underground
so im like a lot of people
which makes me kind of no one
every inch of my design
is far from grace
uh
can i text her now
too soon
no im gonna do it
if you want her to think
youre like everyone else
i never really thought about
the oppression of fitting in before
the good thing about being different
is that no one expects you
to be like them
hey wait for me
doesnt everyone
think theyre different but
pretty much were all different
in the same way
says the girl
perched on the rarefied peak
of mt popularity
babe
taco time
easy mr i know nothing about love
i may surprise you
so where do you wanna go
i want to go somewhere
where i could get pajamas
do you wanna go to gap
the one in tukwila has a gapbody
i love gapbody
it has like 5 dressing rooms
oh it the better gap
so much better
than the one in wenatchee
ugh wenatchee
oh my god go look at molly posts
eww
she looks so gross
she looks so gross
why would she post that
i have no idea
trig checked in at dick fry fry
aster is so lucky
totes lucky
his family owns half of squahamish
hers doesnt even own their house
youre so rude
you know that it true
yeah it true
what surprising is people
dont see what theyre not looking for
the obvious unseen
so
this is why half my class
is failing their essays
ill be reopen for business soon enough
and this cant go on much longer
ive been thinking about what you said
about seeing and not seeing
yes i do
i had a painting teacher
once tell me that
the difference between a good painting
and a great painting
is typically five strokes
and theyre usually
the five boldest strokes in the painting
the question of course
is which five strokes
i get it after one slaved away
at making a pretty good painting
the last thing youd want to do
is make a bold stroke and potentially
ruin everything
that why i gave up painting
still i wonder if that
is how im living my life
hey babe
which one
right one right
great
let do this
it a
pretty good life
probably the best life one could hope for
in squahamish
perhaps
but how well
do you really know squahamish
oh so that your boldest stroke
im into the slow build
what was that
decisiveness
but please
take all the time you need to be bold
is this bold enough for you
and thus was abstract art born
and transformed
hey
hey
or not
everything beautiful
is ruined eventually
maybe that the thing
if you do ruin your painting
you gotta know
you have everything in you
to get to that
pretty good painting again
but if you never
do the bold stroke
youll never know
if you couldve had a great painting
triangle is different
all polygons with three sides
take one side away
now it just an angle
add a side that a square
when does the dating start
this is dating
no dating is burgers
and fries and shakes
and maybe another order of fries
and
im gonna text her
wait what
at a certain point youve gotta close
were not at that point
were way past that point
oh my god
ive gone
little sister hacked my phone

if she brings up remains of the day
talk about how the movie loses out
by not spending more time on the nazis

but
it a date not a book report
i got two of them signed when he came

none of that is you
it could be i started reading
that remains of the day book
really
yeah i fell asleep a few times
but im still reading it
that gotta count for something
there are no points for effort
isnt that what love is how much effort

school project
hi ellie chu dad
we dont have time to school you
on everything aster thinks you are

deep versus broad-based learning
huh

then cram you on her greatest hits
oh cool

yes
are you ready for this
yes sir yes sir

the great thinkers of the 20th century
nana not trapped in hell either
hey hey where are you going
the hell got into munsky
youre like some marvelous distant
well queen i guess

two hand foods one great taste
conversation is like ping-pong
i hit one and then you

looks like the moose have a man open
oh
youre not hungry

now that weird
hey uh can i ask you a question
i dont want to try a taco sausage
why squahamish
just like your dad seems so unhappy here
and you also seem kind of unhappy
i gotta go
no no no wait
no youre not taking this seriously
i have a ton of work i have to do
no just youre so smart

waste my time trying to win you a girl
wholl never look your way
no it just seems weird
youre weird
no yes
enjoy your happy life in squahamish
no no
the thing about no exit is it like how
what i really want is to run my own shop
with new recipes and and fyi
taco sausage is really effing good
okay but im the fourth son
and my family been making
the same sausage for 49 years
and it doesnt matter
if theyre going broke or out of style
theyre nana recipes
if ma cant have nana
at least she can make her sausages
if i break away itll break her heart
and it either her heart or mine
so i stay
we had to go
where my dad could get a job
he studied trains
engineering
phd no less
so uh
he became the station manager
at squahamish
to start
the plan was to be promoted
to system engineer
or anything engineer
squahamish was a jumping-off point
it turns out speaking good english
trumps having a phd
or one from china anyway
and my dad he
doesnt speak very good
he not bad
i dont speak very good either
true
what your excuse
how do you feel about pot roast
i should get back to the station
i know but weve gotta eat
mom
tommy stop friending my friends
would you like to weigh in or are you
just gonna scream throughout the meal
ill deal with the dog wrestling
mom
it your fault
or we could go to your place
match energy match strokes
and just say one thing
where were you born
in squahamish
what about you
okay good that wasnt so hard
but where were you born
i dont need talking practice
it just seems
like a really short conversation
i was born in xuzhou china
when did you come here
when i was five
what do you like about squahamish
uh
ive never been anywhere else
me neither
how does satan get his message through
outside are the dogs the sorcerers
the immoral persons
does he write letters
no he causes us to question
question our lives our path
our very faith in god
satan plants the seed of doubt
and from that seed grows sin
sin is everywhere
were lucky to live in a good town
like squahamish
but the world is changing
let us stay strong against satan call
lest sin creep in and destroy
the good life god has prepared for us
you know what it like to finally meet
someone your age who gets you
you know where else you can meet
people your age who get you

how her eyes look right into yours
how
she twirls her hair when she reading
how
her laugh

and she stops being so perfect
for just a few moments
she has at least five different voices
how you could live
in an ocean of her thoughts and
feel like she knows

wife
aster
will you

thank you ellie
everyone
love isnt pretending
uh i know um
because ive been pretending
only for a few months but
it sucks
paul
and ive been thinking about how much
it would suck to have topretend to be
not you
uh your whole life
i always thought
that there was one way to love
uh one right way
but there are more
uh so many more than i knew
and
i never want to be the guy
who stops loving someone
for loving the way that they want to love
and thank you paul

you know trig
i have been writing your papers
for the last four years
and if youll forgive me
im just gonna rewrite you one last time
love isnt patient and kind and humble
love is
love is
love is messy
and horrible and selfish and
bold
it not finding your perfect half
it
the trying
and
reaching and
failing
love is
being willing to ruin
your good painting
for the chance at a great one
is this really the boldest stroke
you can make
you
yeah
