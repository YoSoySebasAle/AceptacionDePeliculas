it was
i dont know i feel like im
sort of stuck or something
last night
chris and i ate leftover mac and
cheese in front of the tv
id love to be your kind of
stuck
i mean it not like i dont
appreciate it but
nice dinners arent really
cutting it anymore
or maybe it the company i
dont know
do you think i should be more
social
you go out every night how much
more social can you get
i dont know how to explain it
when i dont even get it myself
well our church is having a
concert in a few weeks
you could come with meet some
new people
yeah im not really a church
person
think about it

not a lifelong commitment
let me guess
ron
hey

i appreciate sun city church
taking home base ministries
under their wing

here

with the build
lord knows the need is great
you want to join me on a coffee
run
coffee i just gave him coffee
no you gave him bargain brand
mud
whatever for the record
the reason chris wants to get
coffee
is cuz he has a thing for
one of the baristas
we call that thing a marriage
license

jason organization builds
houses
that what youre volunteering
to do
what no no i cant build a
house
you do this and youre gonna
have to swing a hammer
and you might chip a nail
i think this is a christian
organization
most likely he a christian if
he works for them
which means he probably not
gonna date someone who isnt
no it wont be a problem
ill just pretend fake it till
you make it
vic you cant fake faith
sure i can
i mean do you remember when i
cheered for seattle

things
he gonna figure it out
eventually

totally into me

building projects
hey if you need any help with
the newbies just let me know
thanks
hey i know you left cali to
start over
but dont be so focused on the
work
be more open from moving on from
rachel
i dont get involved with people
who volunteer for me
you know this
unless there a wow factor
a what no that
like when you see someone from
across the room and
suddenly nothing else even
matters
that ridicul
you were saying
come on we need to get started
you know i dont know her that
well
but by the way shelby talks
id say she more into hunting
guys than building homes
doesnt mean she cant
volunteer
dude im just saying be
careful
because she clearly
into you
look there nothing id like
more than to meet someone
but volunteer or not this girl
is way out of my league

hi im john marcus and welcome
back to our show
framing your house is an
ambitious yet exciting project
and since the frame is the
skeleton
or the backbone of your
house
supporting the entire
structure you will need to use
the proper tools and materials
the tools you will have to have
on hand are saw horses
hand saws power saws chalk
lines hammers and nail guns
hey ladies natty here from
fantastic wear
tired of those frumpy drab work

boxes if you want

merely external
braiding the hair and wearing
gold jewelry

of the heart
with the imperishable quality of
a gentle and quiet spirit
which is precious in the sight
of god
hey

week
you sure youre all right
from that fall

behind the wall
and i got up to get my notebook
in the other room
you were protected
what do you mean
god knew that guy was going to
drive into your house
okay could have been a
coincidence
i dont believe in coincidence
what i do believe is that he was
watching over you
i have ingredients for a mocha
do you want to come inside or a
coffee
yeah
okay
i like old houses
good opportunity to make
improvements
have you always lived here

have a brother
they all live in california
oh so whyd you move here
mostly this job they needed a
director i was available
mostly hmm
why were you available
come on
really
okay i was in a relationship
the plot thickens
but my leaving was a good thing
for both of us
oh so that all youre gonna
tell me
yep
youre kind of mysterious
sometimes
youre kind of a flirt
sometimes
moi
yeah
her name rachel
we were engaged
it wasnt long before we
realized
we wanted different things
like what
i found faith and she found a
reason to dump me
so that was a deal breaker
i probably should get going
oh okay
you know im sort of new to
this whole faith thing
yeah i know
oh
when i was offered the job
id only been going to church
for a couple of months
oh wow
what that for
i dont know im just trying to
figure you out
yeah im still trying to figure
me out
believe me i was trying to
belong
act like everyone around me
total fake i mean who does
that
yeah who does that
i finally settled into my own
relationship with god
and it turns out i dont have to
pretend with him
well i gotta go watch joy
kids so ill see you around
hey

with ron
it never bothered you before
to cancel for a better offer
what going on

warned me off of you
that not fair look i wanted
to go out with you
ive been trying to get you to
ask me out
oh so that it you got what
you wanted
i guess you won huh
it not like that
i double booked myself and i
never do that
do you hear yourself right now
im not into being strung along
can you just wait a second
fine tell me why you
volunteered
i volunteered because i wanted
to get to know you
and i wanted you to like me
so i pretended to be a
christian

i opened up about rachel
of course not
do me a favor just stay away
what up bro

oh man im sorry
hey you gonna tell me what
going on

youve been avoiding jason like
he the plague
look we need to talk

i havent been completely honest
with you about who i am
im not really a christian
wait then why would you tell me
you were
i dunno it complicated but
mostly
when i got to know you guys i
wanted you to like me
victoria if you want people to
like you
you let them get to know the
real you
im not trying to start
anything i just
i cant believe i listened to
you
you had me trick wyatt into
liking me
but that not who i am
and now he thinks im just some
kind of weirdo
and you know what christian or
not
i still would have been your
friend
hey there
rachel

i called your mom
and i texted chris a few times
but he well chris

much

rehearsing what i was gonna say
now that i look at you i
just

hey hey everybody werent
they amazing
we come to my favorite time of
this evening
especially after that
performance
and i dont want to miss an
opportunity
to celebrate with anyone who
accepted jesus tonight
so who brave enough to come
on up here
and share about it share their
testimony
yeah come on up young lady
what are you doing
what a testimony
your story but
yeah i see you come on up
come on
no
youve made it this far wed
love to hear your testimony
come on dont be shy now
umm hi everyone
oh whoa
sorry umm im a bit of a mess
i was not planning on coming
here tonight
hence the awkward gown
but i want to be here with my
friends
the ones who think im shallow
and i agree with them
ive only known superficial
relationships
i mean theyre safer they dont
cost me anything
and i can protect myself from
being hurt
a few weeks ago i met a guy a
really great guy
and me being me
i went after him pretending to
be someone im not
in order to get him to notice
me i volunteered
with this christian organization
that he works with
and it was wrong i mean this is
his ministry his passion
and i treated it like it was a
game
nothing is worth hurting the
ones that you love
that you care about
but while i was pretending to
know what i was doing
i actually started serving
putting other people ahead of
myself
and that was a first trust me
but it felt good
and i dont know the best part
about all of this is that
while i was pretending to be
like him a christian
i was actually learning how to
be one
when i took the focus off myself
and i stopped being so
selfish
i opened up to wanting to know
god and who he thinks i am
and then suddenly this whole
christian thing
it just it made sense and it
got real
so im here tonight to share my
story
i dont want to be the old me
i want to be someone that
pleases god
and considers others while
finding out who i truly am
so to all my friends
im so sorry and i hope youll
forgive me
wow what a great start
wow this is this is amazing
let let form a line
who would like to go next
