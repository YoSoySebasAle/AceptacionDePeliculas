
please welcome to the podium
the head coach and leader
of the mighty ducks
gordon bombay
thank you
it a great honor to be here today
to introduce you
to a truly great group of kids
sure they can be
a little rambunctious
theyve run me ragged and played
more than their fair share of pranks
i still havent forgotten
about those eggs
but i hung in there
and they hung in there for me
we became the quack attack
the flying v and the bash brothers
ive never had a better time
these kids are winners
each and every one of them
but more than that
these are good people
i hope that they enrich and enliven
your school and your lives
the way they have mine
now i hand you over
to the capable hands
of my old biology teacher
and the current headmaster
of eden hall dean buckley
dean
gordon bombay
has a lot to be proud of
we are happy to welcome the ducks
to our great educational institution
so today it gives me
great pleasure to award you
these full athletic scholarships
to the eden hall academy
where we hope the ducks will be happy
warriors and lead us on to glory
and divisional championships

dean
fellas
dean nice tie
lovely day
good boys
work those legs gaffney
where your energy
i think im gonna be sick
one cupcake over the line catlady
this is total crap
i cant play for this drill sergeant
play for us charlie
the ducks come on man
all right fulton
get low bend your knees
smooth strokes
that it fulton stay low
julie the cat
what the matter you eat a fur ball
yeah that good coach
i like that fur ball
that uh very clever
just get in the net goldberg
me sure thing be my pleasure
yeah
over here over here
you know i dont see a captain out here
on your left pass it
make him make the first move conway
hey averman you got nothing
over here charlie
come on charlie clear it out
clear it out
freeze i said freeze
averman
i did freeze
where the one place you
never want to clear the puck
it looked open
just answer the question conway
listen im not a defenseman
im a scorer
follow me
anybody share his opinion
all right then take a knee
what the one thing all
great teams have in common
great coaching
dont try to suck up to me averman
defense
see unlike scoring defense never quits
but to play great defense
you need one thing above all else
bet it starts with a w
confidence
listen if you learn nothing
else when youre here you learn this
all right
cause it not just about hockey
it easy to be confident
when you have control of the puck
it very very difficult
to keep that confidence
when you gotta take whatever
strange bounces life throws your way
dont be careless
but dont be too careful either
you cannot be afraid to lose
that how you gain the confidence
to attack the game
when the puck isnt yours
that how you attack life
even when you think
you dont have any control
and that how you play real defense
is this seat taken
you know you are just like
the rest of those snobs
i am not a snob
oh really
well you dont like me
because im an athlete
that a snob you dont even know me
if i knew you i wouldnt like you
oh yeah well try me
hi im charlie conway
im a 4-year-old
almost six-foot nonsmoking leo
i like hockey pizza and music
and i dislike
everything about that school
except maybe you
now you try
im linda
i dont like it here either
and pizza
i like pizza
music
of course i like music
i like pantera
no way i love pantera
so the only thing
we dont agree on is hockey
too violent
dont understand the rules
i have to admit ive never been to a game
you have never heard
of the anaheim mighty ducks
they named a pro team after us
sorry
oh man
well uh

any kind of nut i swear
i blow up it kind of gross

get dressed charlie
what is this all about
sit down
that his daughter
she was injured in a car accident
about five years ago
he was driving and they got sideswiped
so that why he gave up playing pros
when the north stars left minnesota
he stayed
he didnt want to disrupt her recovery
her doctors and her friends were here
we all just thought he was some
washed-up bully who couldnt hack it
he can hack it charlie
he just simply made a choice
i dont think he ever
regretted it for a minute
come on
check this out
look at that hair
i look like greg brady
i was like you charlie
when i played hockey
i was a total hotshot
tried to take control of every game
i wound up quitting
so i tried the law
same thing
i rule in the courtroom
but inside im a mess
i started drinking
man i was going down
but then this
great thing happened
maybe the best thing ever
i got arrested
and sentenced to community service
and there you were
charlie and the ducks
and as hard as i fought it
there you were
you gave me a life charlie
and i want to say thank you
i told orion about all this
when i talked to him about taking over
i told him that you were
the heart of the team
and that you would learn
something from each other
i told him
that you were
the real minnesota miracle man
you did
i did
so be that man charlie
be that man
hey nice move

were running late as it is
im afraid this is important
we have a board meeting
scheduled tomorrow and
well you all are on the agenda
we have to think long-term here
what in your best interest
hard as it is for me personally
because you kids have been a breath
of fresh air around here
the board is going to approve
the withdrawal of your scholarships
now youll be welcome to stay
through the end of the semester
but after that
it will be necessary for you
to enjoy other educational opportunities
dean i need a word with you
i think ive said all i need to say
no now
other educational opportunities
what he saying russ
ill put it in terms you can understand
adios amigo
adios amigo
oh i see
so that it
youre dumping em just like that
coach im sorry
your team isnt performing
and ive been under enormous pressure
from whom the alumni group
a bunch of aging pep clubbers
ted im trying to do you a favor
with those kids gone
youll get to pick your own team
let face it the ducks are drowning
i got my team
either they stay or i go
well miss you ted
why us
cause he a slime
yeah i know
where that dude lives
were just pawns
puppets for the stage show
jesters to entertain the king
barnacles on the bottom of
shut up
coach is this legal
i mean dont we have
contracts or something
i dont know what it is
all i know is were gonna fight it
do i have a motion for reconsideration
im sorry coach but unless there is a
motion from a board member and a second
the decision must stand
told you not to worry
you leave us no choice
but to bring in our attorney
please
dean buckley members of the board
as counsel for coach orion
and the freshman hockey team
im here today to set forth
your legal options
so that you may make the best possible
decision for all parties concerned
mr bombay this isnt a legal proceeding
not yet but i can assure you
that it will be
do you mind
these scholarships
an offer
became a binding contract upon
the signatures of the recipients
and acceptance by the ducks
they cannot be voided except for cause
which i guarantee you you have none
should you decide to pursue
their cancellation
i will slap you with an injunction
i will tie this matter up
in court for years
until long after these kids
have gone on to college
and i will collect damages
i will win
because i am very very good
you know why im so good
because i had a good education
you gave it to me
and youre gonna give it to these kids
he is good
just gettin started
now some of you may be snobbish enough
to believe that
these ducks dont belong at eden hall
let me tell you you are dead wrong
these are remarkable young people
you give them their full shot
and i promise you they will succeed
not only on the ice
but in the classrooms as well
these people are my friends
and i know what they can do
accordingly
i demand that you reinstate
their scholarships
for their benefit
and for your own
this is ridiculous really
what going on man
i move that the scholarships
be reinstated
is there a second
all in favor
we have no choice
scholarships reinstated
for hans charlie
ive got some business in chicago
but ill be back soon
if you need anything give me a call
all right
