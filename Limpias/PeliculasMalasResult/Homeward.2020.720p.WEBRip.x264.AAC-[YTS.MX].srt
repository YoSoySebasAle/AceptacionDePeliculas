orcs and elves
lived in peace for 000 years
and
i just wanted a family
i just wanted to belong
i didnt know
that rolf wanted
scrap what did you do
rolf used me
he used your brother
barl created a spell
to get a gemstone
that would create an army
wait what gemstone
from the stories
from our history
the battle between orcs
and elves 000 years ago
rolf knows where it is
impossible
he said he was the descendant
of the general orc
that fought in the final battle
secrets were passed to him
from generation to generation
wait a minute
rolf is related to shark tooth
mm-hmm
so if he has the stone
then no one is safe
legend has it that orcs became
0 times their normal size
and all of them were
controlled by
general sharp tooth
you know your history
your brother is this way
come on
groans
see
he in a funk
hey buddy

orc domination thing

we all messed up
but barl we are family
and as a family
were all gonna fix this okay

of the gemstone
to take full control
we need to stop him
