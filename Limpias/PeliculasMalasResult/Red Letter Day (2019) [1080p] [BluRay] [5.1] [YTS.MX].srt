hitler wasnt real

like someone you know
a family member or
someone from school
ill go with no one
then you creep
why who would you kill
still cant believe im
letting her date an older boy
i should probably check
to see if it even legal
i googled it
it totally legal
still super gross though
i guess she is nineteen
she can pretty much
date whoever she pleases
i mean id
let her have this one
she got enough drama with
the move and everything
interfering now
would likely cause
some kind of romeo and
juliet situation
i know
i dont like moving
any more than you kids but
i think we can make
this place cool right
it a thousand times
better than the townhouse

lewis that guy sucks
remember how mad he
got at your fortieth
when you let me
and tim have a beer
he called you so many names
immature rebellious
irresponsible
cant those jerks go one
morning without construction
i told you this neighborhood
will never be finished
i think he even called you a
dirty hippie at one point
he was very drunk that night
he apologized
yeah like months later
even just last week he got
so angry when we left those
cardboard boxes on
the lawn overnight
dude is so anal
did you know that term
comes from when babies wont
poo as an act of control
over their parents
ew
i dont even want to
know how you know that
i read
you should try it sometime
i do read you turd
kids sometimes
you have to be nice
to people that you dont like
in order to stay friends with
the people that you do like
lewis may be difficult
but alice is worth it
ill say

tell him yourself
what was that maddie

millionaires in
three simple steps

wedding invitations

pretty creepy choice for
a wedding invitation

who would send such a thing
mom
tim honey
does that letter tell you to
kill someone

what
red letter day
how much do you trust the
world outside the comfort
of your manicured reality
how well do you know your
friends and neighbors outside of
the safe bubble of
your online persona
welcome to red letter day
your instructions
are as follows
kill this person
before they kill you
the person in this photo has
been selected using data
from your online activity
you have been matched with
someone with conflicting beliefs
within five kilometers
of your residence
they too have been
sent this same letter
with your image and address
happy hunting and good luck
then there is an address
below alice photo
mine says the exact same thing
except for it just a picture
of some random bald dude
maddie what does yours say
im not opening that
knowing my luck
you probably got me
dont you dare
chill out maddie
it just some dumb prank
chill out
we received letters
telling us to kill people
im sorry
if im finding it kinda difficult
to take this seriously
i mean look at this dude
the only thing he murdering is
a full series of
firefly in one sitting
this isnt funny tim
ok just calm down
ok calm down
for all we know were the only
people who received these
ok let just open your letter
then ill call the police
no
i want no part of this
if you guys want to play this
stupid game then that on you
me i want nothing to
do with this shit
maddie come-
how about we just give
her a minute to calm down hey
yeah
youre probably right
it likely just
some dumb prank
but i should call the police
give me a minute
9 what your emergency
i think my family
has been threatened
we received letters
telling us to kill somebody
before they kill us

your home threatening you presently

thank you
connecting you with the
lakeview police department
hello id like to
report a threat on my life
is there someone threatening
you in person right now miss
no not presently
i received a strange letter
a letter
yeah this letter tells me
to kill one of my neighbors
before they kill me
it says that they
received the same letter
have you tried discussing
this with your neighbor
no
i literally just received
this and thought that i should
notify you first in case any
other letters had been reported
it likely just a prank
do you have children
yes i have children
look i really dont need
to be patronized right now
what would you like us to do
your job maybe
you could i dont know
look into this or something
i am cooperating just please
ill give you any
information that you need
ok we can send an
officer out to look into this
tonight at six
what
that
that nine hours from now
your life isnt
in any immediate danger
well yes
im not in any immediate danger
well if that status
changes contact us again
and someone will
be there in moments

what did they say
theyre sending a cop at six
christ

alice got the same thing
yeah
ill give her a call in a bit
first let me see your letter
joe dennis

dont know this man
never seen him
before in my life
wait is this the guy that
walks his cat
you know the weird balding one

but not the dude
i think this is pretty close
well i did just
unpack my telescope
ill be there in a second
honey
were going to spy on the
neighbors want to join
no
ok let take a look here
tim
what
holy shit
that totally a fluke mom
we bought you this
to look at the stars
not to be a creep
honestly i havent used that
thing since i unpacked it
i swear on my life
do we need to have another
discussion about consent
mom
alright
i believe you
come on creep
let get creeping
looks like professor x
hasnt checked his mail yet
just kinda looks like
another boring morning
in aspen ridge doesnt it
yeah
hang on a sec
i think this is him
let me see
that totally him
oh good it looks like
he leaving for the day
one less thing to worry about
does he have a
letter in his mailbox
cant tell
it one of those
old school ones on a post
you know this is
actually kind of fun
aside from the creepy
letters and everything
what sporty kevin
smith is up to over here
damn looks like
he also got a letter
let me see
christ
you know now would
probably be a good time to
give alice a call
yeah
mel
hey ali
hang on a sec
im guessing you received
one of those stupid letters too
yeah pretty messed up hey
oh god
looks like im dealing with
a bit of a poo-naumi over here
you have my sympathy
lewis a little help over here
sorry about this mel
look do you mind
just swinging by
for a cup of tea or something
visit me and this stinky baby
yeah
sure i can come
by in a little bit
ok chat soon
you made a big mess
you made a big mess
yes you did
mom please
you dont need to do this
she just a few houses down
ill be ten minutes
fifteen tops
but what if-
maddie come on
this is alice
were talking about here
at least take this
for protection
tim put that back right now
i think we should just call dad
ok come on look
whoever sent these letters
is trying to get us
to behave irrationally
for their own sick
pleasure or whatever
i think we should just call dad
he would know what to do
i can assure
you that your father
would not keep his cool
in this situation
he would likely just
barricade all the windows
maybe that not
such a bad idea
it better than
what youve got
look just stay here
ill be back soon
we good
i love you
i love you too tim
but let not act like it
the end of the world ok
take care maddie
oh and lock the
door behind me ok
hey youre probably still in
the air but i just wanted to
let you know there some
really weird shit going on
im sure once you land
youll hear all about it
but we just didnt
want you to worry
were safe for now even if
mom did leave us home alone
call back when you get this
i think youre being a
little too hard on mom
she trying her best
whatever
what kind of parent
leaves her children alone
during a time like this
give me a break maddie
i mean she literally
ten houses down in aspen ridge
maybe the lamest
neighborhood in the city
you might be taking these
letters a little too seriously
i dont think youre
taking them seriously enough
damn
people are sure
going nuts over this
holy shit
daria just posted a video
of her dad fighting
really let see
you try to act
like youre innocent
guess what
isis dont mean shit
to me motherfucker
listen just get out of
here before i call the cops
isis dont mean shit to me
you try to scare me
isis dont mean shit
to me motherfucker
isis what are you
even talking about
i was born in this country
my parents were born
in this country

you isis fucks that
even sent those letters huh
you wanna kill me
you wanna fucking kill me
come on take your best shot
youre a loser
youre not even worth my time
what the fuck did
you just say to me
what the fuck did you
jesus christ
what the fuck is
wrong with people
i knew this was the type
of shit that was hidden
underneath the surface
i just figured most
of it was in the us
rednecks like that are just
always looking for an excuse
people are shit
try not to get too
cynical maddie
i mean there
plenty of good people
were good people
whatever you say
i just hope daria is okay
looks like there a group
taking credit for the letters
the unknown
there a video
welcome to the
inaugural red letter day
presented by your
friends at the unknown
each of you has been
assigned one person to kill
before they kill you
what you do next is up to you
for too long have we been
categorized and separated
in the name of
profit and control
today we engage
will kindness and manners
prevail or will the true
self-serving nature of
humankind rear its ugly head
stay tuned and happy hunting
what the fuck was that
maybe we shouldnt have
let mom go to alice
play it again
it just mel
ya big scaredy cat
boo
come in come in
damn
somehow your house has
become even more beautiful
than the last time i saw it
oh mel youre sweet
i dont think that much
has changed
melanie
lewis
hello lucy
how my favorite
little lady doing
looks like someone
missed their auntie
green or black tea
green would be lovely
here let me get that for you
ok
has he been getting
enough sleep lately
im sorry he been
like this all morning
lewis
make yourself useful and
put a kettle on for us
i hear you made a
little mess this morning
the little stinker
how is it only
nine am and youve already
managed to roast a chicken
ive been up since
four with lucy
were trying to
cut out deli meat
i read about another listeria
outbreak on facebook
one more reason to
become vegetarian i guess
i would try lewis is more
of a red meat kind of guy
residents of the
calgary neighborhood of
crazy start to the day huh
yeah this is so messed up
has anyone you know
not yet as far as i know
they say to just to sit
tight until the police figure it out
if the dickhead i spoke
with this morning is on the case
i have no hope
of it being resolved
have a little compassion
imagine putting your
life on the line everyday
only to be treated
like an a-hole
didnt you date a cop once
ssshhhhh
thanks louie
uh huh
an anarchist group
calling themselves the unknown
are taking responsibility
god the news is so
depressing these days
mixed with all of
these dystopian tv shows
youd think the world is ending
were not evening getting
cable in the new place
pinching pennies are we
the kids dont
even watch it anymore
and id rather read a novel
or do something outside
to each their own
that the picture
these weirdos decided to use
you look good
thanks
so which picture
did they use for me
you were doing yoga
tim said you looked cute
well that flattering
crazy to think they
can just gather all our
information on the internet
it feels like such an
invasion of privacy
i know
it a strange new world
all your most intimate details
up to the highest bidder
it makes you want to
move to the mountains
id last about two week
yeah i guess we need to adapt
i mean can you even remember
what you used to in a line-up
or the waiting room or in the
bathroom before you had a phone
magazines
newspapers
archie
oh yeah
i guess it the same
thing just digital
and now you can voice
all your thoughts without
an opinions column
i try to stay away
from all that garbage
but sometimes you just
get sucked in
i just learned what
a cuck was last week
i dont even want to know
so who did lewis
get in his letter
i mean you dont have to
if it uncomfortable
mrs miller
i dont know if youve met her
yet but she is the cutest
goes around every
christmas with a tin of cookies
for everyone in the community
strange hed be paired
with such a sweet old woman
i know i mean i cant
believe their data or whatever
paired you and i together
i mean you do vote
conservative but
when are you going to stop
grilling me about that
last time i promise
so who did the kids get
if you dont mind
me asking of course
classic maddie
she just ripped hers up and
stormed off to her room
tim got this weird balding man
you might have seen
him walking his cat
that guy
oh he so weird
that cat barely moves
i swear i see him carrying it
more than i see it walking
so is maddie still
seeing that older boy
yeah but i cant blame her
i mean i went through a
bad boy phase myself
more than once
hell i married one
i shouldnt stay long
i just wanted to say that
im not taking
this letter seriously
like at all
i appreciate it
i was going to
call you right away
but i had to calm
lewis down first
you know how he gets
yeah
the kids are freaking out too
i tried telling them this was
likely just some dumb prank
here hoping
i should get back to the kids
so how are they adjusting to
the move and everything
tim is taking it
like a champ but maddie
i think she still
really misses kris
it hard enough being 9
just give it time
you got this
thanks ali
here hoping they
finish that new complex soon
it would be great to
have a cinema nearby
oh gees i cannot remember the
last time we went to a movie
not since lucie was born anyway
lewis what was the last
show we saw in the theatres
lewis
melanie can you please
explain why you brought
a large knife into my home
lucifer still hasnt responded
nope
i wouldnt worry about it
his coffin likely hasnt
let in the morning light yet
dick
oh fuck looks like theyre
reporting a murder in town
what
a custodian was attacked by
a masked man using a hatchet
at the bass pro shop at
crossiron mills this morning
police services suspect that
this is the first known murder
to occur in what is being
referred to as red letter day
police remind citizens to stay
inside and to keep all doors
locked until more
information is known
follow updates online using the
hashtag #yycredletterday for
more breaking news
as it happens
bass pro
chances are this murder isnt
even related to the letters
it wild
just wild
oh fuck
holy fuck holy fuck
who is that tim
oh my god
maddie i need you go upstairs
and call the police ok

extremely high demand
for officers right now
i wish we could
do something sooner
but it is simply not possible
please
hello
hello madison are you
still with me
madison
madison
please just come help us
alice please
i can explain
tim tried to give me that
knife before i left the house
just in case something
happened and he must have
slipped it into my
purse without me noticing
right and you just
didnt happen to notice
a gigantic carving
knife in your purse
well im so fucking sorry
lewis but as you may have
noticed there a lot of really
weird shit going on today
stop it
stop it you two
mel why would tim put the knife
in there if he knew you were
coming to my house
he just a dumb kid
im sure he thought he
was doing the right thing
im trying to believe you but
does tim think were bad people
do you think were bad people
that rich coming from
the edwards family
excuse me lewis
what is that supposed to mean
what do you think it means
lewis can we please just
discuss this upstairs
do you have something
against my family
oh where to start
you let your teenage
daughter date a grown man
you leave trash
all over your lawn
and youre enabling your
son to become an alcoholic
just like his father
and youre one to talk
dont think i dont know how
much you spend on webcam models
what was it last month alice
four thousand dollars
five hundred dollars for
just a pair of used panties
you told her about that
that was a secret melanie
i told you that in confidence
well i guess it all
out in the open now
and to think me and my
low-class family spent
christmas with you last year
how ashamed you must have been
what you must think of me
to believe for one second
that i was planning to
use that knife on you
look alice this is stupid
how long have we
known each other
ten years
do not touch her
all we know is that we received
a letter saying you would try to
kill alice and then
you show up at our home
with a ten inch blade
you will not lay another
hand on me lewis
you got that
then you will keep your
distance from my wife
this has been a crazy day
and clearly coming
here was a bad idea
so im just going to
get my things and go
youre not going anywhere
you are gonna stay right here
until the authorities arrive
alice are you really going
to let him behave this way
are you going to let
him treat me this way
look mel just do
what lewis says
alice stop her
she going for the knife
alice please
are you fucking
kidding me right now
my children are calling me
they need me tim needs me
i just want to answer my phone
im sorry
this is fucking crazy
lewis im sure we can work this
out just put down the knife
the only solution i can think of
is to lock you in the basement
until the police arrive
my children need me
that doesnt
concern me melanie
what matters to me is
the safety of my family
shhhh
it ok
so the choice is yours
you go down by
your own free will
or by force
but let get
one thing straight
you are not leaving this

no ok
do you remember
that road trip we took
to grandma nancy
when you were young
you were little
you were just five
maddie would have been seven
it was our first time ever
going through the mountains
with you kids
you kept making
us stop everywhere
so you could pick rocks
do you remember that
you guys must have
had ten pounds of rocks
back there with you
do you remember
what happened next
no
not really
we were just in
the middle of nowhere
it started to rain
and it was dark
so dark
that kind of dark you only get
when youre miles
away from anything
we rounded this corner and we
saw all these flashing lights
so we pulled over to see what
was going on and as we rolled
down the windows you could
hear this horrible moaning
and this woman crying
and then you saw it first but
we realized there was this
deer that had crashed through
the windshield and was pinning
the woman to her seat
you jumped out of the car and
maddie followed and i just had
to console you two while your
dad helped the woman out
and we stayed with her
as she waited for help
and the whole time that deer
was just making the
most horrible noise
this moan it just echoed
and you kids were
just begging us
begging us to do something
and there was just nothing
that we could do you know
your dad and i were just trying
to tell you that it was the
deer time to pass
and then the deer
it got like a second wind
it just started
like kicking madly
it kicked so hard and
it like lifted itself up
right out of the windshield
and then just bounded
off into the woods
we were all watching it run away
when maddie-
maddie said something
ill never forget
she said-
good creatures
dont die so easy
so youre the good creature
i hope so tim
i hope so
ok
wish me luck
good luck
