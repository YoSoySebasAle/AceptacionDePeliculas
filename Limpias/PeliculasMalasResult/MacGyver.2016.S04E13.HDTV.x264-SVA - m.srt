
it how
every message ended
previously on
macgyver
but who they are
remains a mystery
they call themselves codex
theyve been around
a lot longer than we first thought
there nothing more dangerous
than people who do
the wrong things
for the right reasons
tell him
about file 47
would plunge the
world into chaos
what do you say
a little breakfast with your dear old aunt
why do you refuse to see
what is actually happening here
and what is that
youre compromised
auntie gwen got to you
im gonna try something
but it means
risking everything
everyone i love
im sorry
we didnt start the fire
by billy joel playing
get out of my way
were not gonna make it
the world been turning
ah god nice try
jackass
gwen that was
a meals on wheels
were running out of time
we tried to fight it
rock-and-roller
cola wars
i cant take it anymore
there is a plan
in place
just take a deep breath
okay bossy
but if something happens to me
there something
you should know
im gonna send file 47
to some friends in dc
okay that is a terrible plan
it is a complex statistical
analysis of the climate crisis
indisputable scientific proof
that our planet is dying
file 47 posits a plan
to wipe out
a considerable amount
of the population
in order to get the planet back on track
a theoretical plan
you dont think that
a little dangerous
to put that in the hands
of the government
seeing it in print
might scare them into action
politicians only care
about power
and you want to give
em even more power
to play god and decide
who lives and who dies
we know
what kind of planet
the next generation is going
to inherit
we have to do something
oh no no no no no no
no no no no no
no no no no no
oh god you know what
i think youre right
were not gonna make it to the hospital
damn it ellie
you never listen to me
pull over
okay okay okay
it okay
we-we can do this
we-we can do this
weve got five phds between us
right well ive got three
youve got two
okay i dont see
how that important right now
oh-oh god
hey there little guy
hi
all right
ready to cut the cord
can you wait
just a minute i just feel like
the second we do
he gonna float away
aw you
you deserve the world
and the world
deserves you
oh look at us
so you dont have a name
we couldnt decide
but ill-ill think
of something
<font color=#ff00ff>*macgyver 206*
<font color=#00ff00>season 04  episode 3
title <font color=#ffc30f>save + the + dam + world
aired on <font color=#00ffff>may 08 2020
we have enough food
for a nice long hibernation
generator not great
but thanks to you
we dont have
to worry about power
what do you mean
thanks to us
you brought us shiva
spoiler alert
not just a weapon
it also known as a god
they call
the destroyer
it also named
after a goddess
associated with reincarnation
rebirth
in order
to be born again
first we have to die
shiva here
a
renewable
power source
be right back
your aunt must be really great
at dinner parties
she thinks she
saving the world
exactly
do you really think
we can change her mind
about this plan we dont
even know what the plan is
yeah i have a gut feeling
about this just
deep down somewhere
there some humanity left
somewhere
hey
i get it
you feel connected to her
to your mom
but i need you
to clear your head mac
we need to do
everything we can
to figure out
what theyre planning
yeah youre absolutely right
okay
until then
we need to look
like true believers
right
that doesnt look good
your reputation as artemis
precedes you ms davis
youve got a lot
of fans around here
would you mind accompanying
me to our tech room
uh like i said
were a package deal
you and i have other
business to attend to
we dont have a choice
right
ill s ill see you later
okay
okay
you come with me
and where are we off to
to meet leland
what a leland
he the man who saved my life
when the cia tried to kill me
uh he paid em off
had em declare me dead
who is he
he is codex
the man behind the curtain
among others
he a genius
before codex
file 47 was just theory
and statistics
on paper
now it a plan
to save the world
he helped me
resurrect it
he believes in me
and now
he has to believe in you
and if he doesnt
roman
isnt it about time
for your 400 feeding
let me guess they drop a
live goat into your cage
ill take it from here
no you wont
leland wants you to get your team ready
so i will meet you in
an hour in the vehicle bay
youll be fine
chopin nocturne
in e-flat minor playing
the years 347 to 35
the black plague in europe
over 00000 million
people died
and what happened
after that
the renaissance
and
codex
codex dates back to the 4th century
i know
it hard to believe huh
how is that
even possible
well a group of people
got together back then
with a singular purpose
to protect the planet
from plague
from famine
and
excuse my french
dumbasses
like the people
in power today
a lot of amazing science
had just come out
of the middle east
but westerners needed a
bit of a push
so we funded
a lot of the enlightenment
things were really clipping
along for us
and then
of course
things took a turn
for our dear mother earth
the industrial
revolution
kid good
everything went
all pear-shaped after that
plastics
were invented
we were worried when
they started splitting the atom
but we found
that chain reactions
do come in handy
you remember
world war i
course
franz ferdinand
guess what
he was codex
is that a jmw turner
yes it is
look at that sunset
he was influenced by
the 84 eruption
of mount tambora
spewed gas and ash
up into the sky
volcanic particles
in the stratosphere
probably diffused the light
used to be
mother earth
could protect herself
with an eruption
cool the earth back down
for the next couple
of years
that not the
case anymore
things have gotten out of hand
there just too damn many
of us
please
tell me what i can do to help
you got 20 people
on a lifeboat meant for ten
youre sinking
youre not gonna
make it to shore
what do you do
you throw the ten weakest out
and the strong can row us
back to shore
very good angus
have a nice day
you know
years ago
a man that you know
answered that question
the exact same way
russ taylor
his mind and his resources
were a perfect fit for us
but he refused our proposal
because he weak
friends
every single one of you
has made this day possible
it time to go to work
you okay
hey yeah fine
let do it
all right for security reasons
each team has a tablet
with instructions that will load
once you are on the road
everybody will be traveling
a different route
to attract
the least amount of attention
ill be directing the ops
from here in the bunker
what was is lost
what was is lost
but from death comes life
but from death
comes life
yeah
yeah
still think you
can change her mind
yeah i think our
best bet right now
is just go along with this plan
and see if we can figure out
a way to stop it
what plan mac
were flying blind
hey thanks
for helping us out
we can really use you
out there
sorry to
keep you in the dark
dont suppose you could
let us know what were in for
this is how leland does things
but it for our own good
right
come here
oh i just wish
your mom was here
all right
let do this
can you get in
we need all the intel
we can get
this thing is like
the fort knox of tablets
did leland give you
any clues
no but i
did see something
in the vehicle bay
dosimeters
the things
that measure radiation
yeah so the
question is
what do they have a
a dirty bomb or
do they have
a nuke
any clues in the tech room
no
they just had me writing code
there was something written
on the white board though
it it weird
it wasnt code
it was like an equation
with maybe six letters
it didnt happen to have
an f over an m did it
yeah
it did why
it an equation
for determining
nuclear fission critical mass
so they have a nuke
that explains why they
wanted to hack norad
leland said something
about starting a chain reaction
maybe theyre trying to start
world war iii if we can
well well well
the fam all here
get your gun out of my face
were trying to save everyone
oh that funny so are we
ive got a bad
feeling about this
okay everybody needs
to calm down
and well be okay
you really want us to believe
you used shiva to
infiltrate codex
yes so mac could find out
what their master plan is
yeah and we were making
a lot of progress
until you two showed up
we do not have time for this
im not buying any of this
you gassed us mac
i didnt have a choice
you booted me out of the phoenix
guys i promise
were on the same side here
yes i seem to recall
you betraying
and lying to us
as well riley
betrayed you
you guys dropped a freakin
hellfire missile on us
we tried to stop it
oh really now who lying
codex has a nuke
and every minute
that you keep
your guns trained on us
it gets closer to going off
and we get further away
from stopping it
ive known mac
longer than anyone
he telling the truth
desi taylor
take a breath
no im bringing them in
mac dont
i am going to change this tire
and were gonna make
the rendezvous
we do not have time for this
dont make me do this
taylor stand down
he compromised matty
oh really im the one
who compromised
hey matty did taylor
ever happen to mention to you
that codex tried to recruit him
what he talking about russ
yeah go ahead tell em russ
tell them how codex
approached you
tried to bring you on board
but you kept it a secret
because you didnt want
us to know
that youre the one
who compromised
desi
i want you
to put your weapon down
and put me on speaker
taylor stand down
i am not the one
who is compromised
all right
three years ago i was
approached by an organization
with considerable resources
codex
yes i didnt know that at the time
spearhead operations had a
contract with the us military
to deliver the hades prototype
the bioweapon
we stopped in la
the very same
codex offered me a large sum
to deliver it to them instead
i of course refused
so then they turned to bishop
exactly
someone tried to eliminate
me and they missed
instead five of
my teammates
my brothers in arms
for the last ten years
were taken out by an ied
which i later traced
back to codex
and ive been hunting
them ever since
im sorry for your loss
but does it justify this
all of this
buying the phoenix
using us
for your obsession for revenge
no matter the cost
youre all the best
at what you do
i needed you on my team
well then why wouldnt
you trust me
because i can no longer
read you angus
you fit no
discernible pattern
for all appearances you
crossed over to codex
yeah to stop you
from taking innocent lives
to save you from yourself
i just got a location
for the rendezvous point
that could be
where theyre launching
the nuke from
okay
here what were gonna do mac riley
youre gonna keep your covers
and get
to that rendezvous point
taylor desi
i want eyes on them
and keep a low profile
there just
one little problem
thanks
the last time
i changed a tire
was our camping trip
to yosemite remember
didnt leave our sleeping bags
for two days
hurry up
yeah got it
good
you know what
i trusted you
and you broke me down
and you got me to trust you
and let you in again and again
and when things got tough
you pushed me away
do you have any idea
what that did to me
youre the last person
i wanted to hurt
tire done
time to stop a nuke
everything okay
no no definitely not
got it
coordinates say the
rendezvous should be right there
were in position
we have eyes on mac and riley
youre late
yeah we got a flat
what are our instructions
standing by
nothing received yet
copy that
what is this place
just empty trucks
no nuke
what the hell is
a codex team doing here
i dont know and
i dont like it
this doesnt make sense
theyre all
at the rendezvous point
where the payload
gwendolyn
everything on schedule
were just getting eyes
on the payload
it not there
what do you mean
folks give us the room
a sec please
sit down
when i first found you
right after the crash
i thought to myself
ive never seen another human
shine more brightly
i could read a book
by you on a
moonless night
it easy to shine
when you have purpose
yeah but ive
always been in awe
of you gwen
im in awe of your
mind and your loyalty
even your anger
justifiable anger
they took
your sister
still here
thanks to you
leland what is happening
youve brought me
so much joy over the years
i hate to have to
bring you pain
your nephew angus
youve had such
high hopes for him
but he still a phoenix man
so ive put us all in jeopardy
were often blinded by
the love of our children
as ive been by
you many times
but now comes the hard part
what
what is this
guys youve got a helicopter
approaching from the south
can a helicopter
transport a nuke
not this one
that a cobra
attack helicopter
it a trap
what
everybody needs to run now
what are you talking about
theyre gonna blow up the warehouse
everybody needs to
get out of here now
let move let go
go go go code red
riles over here
come on
it gonna be loud
why
scarlett mr macgyver
and ms davis compromised
our security
more importantly
they compromised you
these human connections
are holding you back
taylor tell me you see them
no this fire too big
there no way of getting in
returning to base
it too hot drop it
weve got them matty
only you couldve
survived this
you okay
yeah
anyone else in there alive
what have you done
what codex always does
what was necessary
these people were
your weakness
i need your strength
need you to see
the big picture
now i know it stings
even though he
betrayed you
angus is your family
and scarlett
like a daughter
yeah what am i gonna
tell her sister
the truth
her sister died
for a greater good
is that what this is
that what it always is
were too close now for
these kind of mistakes
your nephew was dangerous
and your attachment
to him even more so
hmm
so who next
the council and i
have complete trust
in you
and yet you chose not to tell me
that you were gonna neutralize
my entire team
to protect you
to protect your mind
to protect your
natural leadership
you are valued
beyond measure
because you know
the hard truth
some are worth
more than others
you really think
gwen iced her entire team
no i dont
everything about that
attack just feels off
no angus that the true
face of your aunt gwen
im not giving up on her
guys there movement
at the codex ranch house
small convoy just pulled out
looks like a five-ton truck with
two jeeps acting as the escort
theyre moving something big
well
that got to be it that the nuke
closer
doing my best
im inside
look for id numbers
ill call up specs
it wasnt me
it was leland call
he knew that you
would betray us
he knew i would do
the right thing
the ends will justify
what had to be done
who are you trying to convince
me or you
gwen
it not too late to
put a stop to this
this couldnt be
what my mom wanted
nobody wants this angus
it what necessary
i cant believe that
sometimes you just have
to give people a chance
we gave people a chance
they failed
the world is dying
then give me
a chance to do it the right way
it doesnt take the whole world
sometimes you just need
that one person
that you can count on
who you trust
and together
any problem can be solved
i wish that were true
you know it is
i can see it
this isnt who you are
this isnt who
my mother hoped youd become
not the place
id pick for a family reunion
ive got this roman
got what exactly
your supposed-to-be-dead nephew
hiding in the back of our truck
no
angus
mac
take my hand
i still believe in you
no
mac
mac
get a little help here
it was a national park service logo
that said yellowstone on it
why would they pretend
to be forest rangers
volcanoes
leland had
a turner painting of one
he was talking
about them a lot
yeah but that guy just
sounds buckets of crazy
right but what
under yellowstone
is a supervolcano
did-did you just say
supervolcano
yeah i think theyre gonna use
the nuke to somehow set it off
you know
i actually did you a favor
because leland
wouldve had me kill you
it a bumpy road
i need to concentrate
okay so
think of a volcanic eruption
like the uh popping
of a champagne bottle
the cork blows out
and then all of the gases
that are trapped inside
they suddenly expand
and shoot out
and codex is popping
that cork
using a nuclear bomb
right but now imagine
instead of liquid
shooting out
it the gases that have been
trapped inside of magma
for hundreds
of thousands of years
expel ash and cover
the entire western hemisphere
summer would disappear
for possibly years
wait a second
just from one volcano
well yes
but not just any volcano
a really really big one
the best i can tell weve been
driving over this thing
for the past two hours
without sunlight
the planet cools
reversing the greenhouse effect
which is good
but it also destroys crops
causing famine disease
it basically a reset switch
we need to find that nuke
matty are you still tracking
that convoy
were trying
we havent spotted them yet
actually i know how to find it
you do
yeah before i fell
out of that truck
i managed to jam my phone
under the loading ramp
tracing the signal now
it good to have you back mac
sorry about the uh
gun in your face thing
eh what a gun in the face
between friends
one lookout
truck empty
they must have already moved
the bomb
the park service
awarded a contract
to a construction company
to retrofit the dam
it been under
repair for a year
and the president
of that company on paper
martin bishop
so codex set up a dummy corp
to run the dam but why
i dont know
but it has something to do with drilling
drilling wait
what makes you say that
because at the same time
codex took over the dam
they started buying up
a bunch of local
heavy-duty drilling equipment
riles i need a usgs map
of yellowstone
right
here you go
thanks
i knew it okay see there
directly under the dam
mm-hmm
it a side vent
to the volcano
magma chamber
it a thousand feet
and some change down
but it right there
they want to aim a nuke
at a river of lava
no i think theyre gonna blow
a hole where the dam is
what they want is this river
massive amounts of water
flood into the hole
that they drilled
right into the magma chamber
pressure builds and boom
water triggers the
eruption thanks
good news is i got a look
at the bomb it a b6
and you can disarm it
no chance
but what i can do is
build a shaped charge
to interrupt the
chain reaction
you want to blow up
a nuclear bomb
yup but hopefully
we just get
a good old-fashioned
run-of-the-mill explosion
no nuke going off
no mushroom cloud
if i can find the
right materials and
if we can find the nuke
it should work
i think follow me
well if
youre sure
no sign of the
nuke on these feeds
right well cover more
ground searching if we split up
riley you stay here
keep watch
okay
hey guys i uh found some
of codex drilling equipment
and uh
everything i need
to finish my build
a nuclear explosion
is initiated
by a very precise
conventional explosion
this pushes
the fusible material together
to start a chain reaction
but if the material doesnt go
together in just the right way
you might only get
a partial reaction
or even no nuclear explosion
at all
so how is
whatever youre building
supposed to work
like a shotgun
im gonna aim it directly at the
nuke and it should interrupt
the chain reaction
the time-delay fuse will
give us enough time to clear
the building before it goes off
hey guys
uh something happening
codex is bugging out
i dont know why
i do
theyre getting out of the blast zone
they armed the nuke
how do you know that
because im looking
right at it
right coming at you mac
auntie gwen i presume
taylor wait wait
dying just
aint your thing huh
you dont want to do this
i dont want to shoot you
but it what has to be done
that what
you tell yourself isnt it
but i was wrong
i saw the data and
i lost hope that people
could change that
that they could be better
i know that angus
showed you a better way
he showed me too
he my family
i want to help him
killing me
doesnt stop this
the only thing
that does that is helping angus
and youre not gonna
get to him in time
you all right
yeah
we have less than six minutes
and it cant be disarmed
i know
that not the plan
interrupt the
chain reaction
smart kid
the time-delay fuse
it must have broken
when he attacked me
im gonna have
to set it off manually
this is a one-way trip
i need you guys to get
as far away from here as
possible as fast as you can
the time delay wont work
im gonna set it off myself
mac
dont think
just run
angus go
i can do this
what no i
there
no time let me do this
please
for ellen
you connect this to uh
i know i got it
you deserve the world
and the world deserves you
go
run now
well done
we have a nuclear
emergency support team excavating
the dixon dam site
although gwen managed to stop
a full-scale nuclear explosion
we still need to sweep the area
for radiation
mac
were uh
were sorry about your aunt
thanks
so what about codex
the bunker empty
cleared out
looks like leland took the rest
of codex into hiding
we destroyed
their infrastructure
and their plan
oh
uh one more thing
oh bloody
ow
oh bloody
wanking
is that supposed to be swearing
no no it all right
no no
thank you
your badges
welcome back to the phoenix
hilarious
ill get you new ones as soon
as possible in the meantime
im gonna be uh out of
action for a while so mac
youre going to have to
take over my duties too
there a lot of work
to be done out there
about that
i think i know
just where to begin
you ready for this
of course yeah
itll be fine
youre nervous
i know you better
than you think
oh yeah
what am i thinking right now
third season of rick
and morty is the best
you shouldnt have
had an espresso and
you really want to fix that
broken light fixture over there
it was americano
ah
desi
i am
hey let not talk
about it okay
yeah right understood
what i mean egghead is
i dont want to talk
about it right now
you can buy me a drink
and well talk later
you got it
as long as i do
the drink ordering
because your taste in
drinks is embarrassing
it was one time
id never seen a bubblegum
cosmotini spritzer before
i just wanted to try it out
you had two
hey were ready for you
yeah of course
uh
yes
thank you for joining us
mr macgyver
we value your opinion
thank you very much
but this is not
about opinions
it about science
our planet is in trouble
knowing isnt enough
we must apply
being willing isnt enough
we must do
