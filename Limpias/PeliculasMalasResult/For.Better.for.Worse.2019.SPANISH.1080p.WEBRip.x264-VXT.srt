man
all of us have wondered
what is love
music starts
man
love is
commitment
sharing your life
all of it
your fears and dreams
but
the more you share
the more you love
or the longer the relationship
the more you love
how do you rate
a good relationship
by moments
which ones
the happy ones
or perhaps by enduring
the sad ones
music continues
i hope you never stop loving me
hi
music continues
hello
where did you get wine
over there
would you have a glass
with me or seven
ok
im sebastián
valeria
sebastián why is it different
to fall in love
than to love somebody
music continues
to fall in love is simple
it about emotions
first times
the first date
the first touch
and the first kiss
cell phone rings
sebastián
what if we put it all together
the real and the virtual
three years ago
you started dating sebastiaán
sebastián if we put together
the laughter
the kisses
all the pictures we took
the ones we shared
and those that are private
and what about
the late-night conversations
the messages
the comments the posts
if we put together
all we shared
the movies the songs
i love you panda
more moments
equals a better relationship
the more information
we create
the more we love each other
perhaps
but in the real
or the virtual world
an action a word
one click
can delete everything
music continues
i got it when i met valeria
i had to go back to my mom
after going all in
and losing everything
and yes there were hard times
but we faced them together
and we would move forward
just the same
cell phone rings
new message
itll be ok panda
well go through it together
now and always i love you
new message

valeria laisequilla plus one

sebas
sebastián
i am
going after my dreams now
i finally became
the caretaker
of a whole building

a janitor and now
im in charge

to spotify right
the wedding is awesome right
ale and i would always
dream of a wedding like this
-besides roy is a great guy
-woman i know right
ale must be really nervous
why nervous
i mean if they always dreamed
of this wedding
and troy is a great guy
-roy
-roy is a great guy

her first time
the first time she gets married

ale is a virgin
sebastián laughs
sebastián
in a school play

-no and i dont care
-to make love to her
son of a bitch
you know ive been
with over a thousand women
and ive never felt
the connection i had
sebastián
-hi mike
-mike
i was talking with alonso
there something wrong
with the platform
give me your mobile
what do you need it for
take it
what is it
let see
-show me
-that it
is that all
huh
the problem was your phone
when you downloaded the app
did you allow data sharing
no way that makes
me very nervous
what if someone accesses
my phone and hacks it
nobody wants to mike
that is necessary so the app
can use your mobile
internet connection
so in that case
i owe you an apology dont i
im sorry ok
can you imagine
what could have happened
if you hadnt invested
all your money
in your application
and spotify hadnt gotten
ahead of you
turocolapp with double p
exactly huh
you would be one of those
young billionaires now
laughs
come on truth is
at first i doubted hiring you
mostly because
of your massive failure
but now i see
it was the best decision
by the way do you remember
you said something
about hiring a training
a trainee
that it a trainer
hey pam
she is my daughter
and i want her to be useful
sure she must be the youngest
and she might call you
daddy right
yes why
hey daddy
pamela this is sebastián

ill leave you to two
to break the ice
bye princess
see you my visionary man
number one
take care of her
-i will mike
-ok
-stop it
-i love you i cant help it
i dont know why he thinks
that looks good
well your father belongs
to a generation
of rockers that
is dying

-we brought the band to
-oh i love this song

i dont want to see you
disappear

i didnt mean to hurt you
that time
we crashed
and burned unknowingly
against the break of day
and in a thousand pieces
on your skin i stayed
we uncovered ourselves
until we vanished
lost in the moment
i gave in
and when we forgot it
-hold on theyll see you
-i dont care faggot
we were born again
panda
would you marry me
caderas blancas playing
caderas blancas continues
yes i do
she said yes
valeria
so what is love
i dont know the precise words
to answer that
sebastián love is incredible
but it not perfect right
it wonderful
but oftentimes it not easy
valeria
love is everything
it indeed sharing
and commitment
sebastián but it also
to recognize we arent perfect
and we make mistakes
valeria to give yourself
completely and unconditionally
to take a leap of faith
despite the fear
sebastián love is
to face the world together
to forgive and begin again
valeria
for better
or for worse
