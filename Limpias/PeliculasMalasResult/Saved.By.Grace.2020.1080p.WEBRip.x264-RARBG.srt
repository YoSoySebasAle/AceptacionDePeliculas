jerk boss
mediocre policies

i should have known better
should have known better

comfort food
i brought you cookies and wine

that aint right
and he said it was layoffs

but i know it
just he didnt like me
because i stood up to him
but you know what kat
greener pastures ahead
a agree
you know what you didnt need
to work at the mall anyway
you have a degree
in religion
okay so then
work at a church
work at a churches
are full of drama
and you know i dont do drama
i just saw a position
today at our church
for what
executive pastor
executive pastor
mmhmm
executive pastor
hello pastor office
yes
yes
no
is that it
okay
your 500 canceled
yes
mr sandro i already told you
once the pastor gets
one free second
he will investigate a new oven
until then youre just
gonna have to make due
okay bye
sabrina sabrina
you dont have to monitor
my time like this
mr sandro been
waiting a long time
for me to fix that
oven since february
i know but you have
your 200 and your 300
and then you have
the deacon meeting
and marriage counseling
i just dont think
you can fit him in
i always got time for
stuff that important
it is not important
a new stove is not gonna help
that man cook any better
whatd you say
oh nothing
grace hightower
how are you dear
im fine pastor
just fine and you
he busy
yes i am what
can i do for you
yesterday i heard that
there was a job opening
here at the church
is that right
yes
we have an opening
for executive pastor
pastor frank quit and so we
are in desperate need of help
i mean we are in desperate need
you know anybody
that interested
yes pastor myself
excellent i think youd
make a great candidate
well you havent
seen this yet
well that amazing pastor
i didnt even think
you would think
i was qualified to do it
but ill tell you this
i have great
management experience
as well as volunteer
service here at the church
as well as college ministry
i know i know
sabrina you think we have
time for an interview
now
sir im gonna have
to advise against it
you have a media team
meeting in only 20 minutes
and like i can
but im not prepared
i didnt even think you
would take my application
actually we got time
for a group interview
what
yes sabrina grace
you both applied for
the same position
so let step into my office
and have a group session
so what makes you a good
fit for this position
well i am intimately
familiar with the duties
of both the pastor and
the executive pastor
as ive worked for both of
you for the past two years
hm grace
well i worked in a department
store for over eight years
so i have a lot of
executive like duties
that i did over there
like what
managed people
inventory control payroll
i pretty much ran the entire
day-to-day activities
over there
hm and what is your
greatest weakness
well i have to say
my greatest weakness is
im too meticulous focusing
on tasks with perfection
i mean i just
dont like to have
things fall through the cracks
hm that sounds good grace
that good
my greatest weakness
would be um
i care about people too much
the last job that i was with
it was a business
about making money
but people would come in
employees would come in
and they would ask for
advances against their checks
you know and i would feel
sorry for them pastor
and so i think that the
reason why i got fired
mm
sir is there anything
that i can help you with
after all that is my job
i just got an email from haiti
and im about to leave on
an emergency right away
right now
yes
and im gonna leave
you two in charge
what
good morning sabrina
morning
hm up early
i always do something
the pastor really likes
hm did he make
it okay yesterday
uh i havent heard
from him but uh
i will follow up when he
should arrive at the orphanage
okay good
um so um
where do i sit
i was thinking the lobby
shouldnt i have a desk
well this is my desk
and the only other
desk is the pastor
and i really dont think it
appropriate for you to use it
okay so um what
am i supposed to do
just work on my phone
huh that works for me
i have an idea
why dont we switch
why dont you work
here in the morning
and then ill come
in the afternoon
and ill work here on the desk
like i said this is my desk
i know where everything is
it is organized with
optimal efficiency
and ergonomics in mind
for me to leave this desk
would send this church
into a downward spiral
of tragedy and disaster
particularly when
the pastor is gone
mm
actually it would just be
really awkward with you here
mmhmm yeah
awkward all right
oh god
listen sabrina i
understand that you feel like
you are more qualified
than me that fine
but the pastor put
both of us in charge
weve got to stay here and
work together as a team
see it would be nice
if i needed the help
but i have this
all under control
personally i think that the
pastor felt sorry for you
because you got fired
for being too nice
mm that was uncalled for
just like you being here
this is a church
were supposed to be a team
im not here for this bull--
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
what in the siegfried and
roy is going on in here
oh deacon thompson im
sorry did she disturb you
well im having a
prayer meeting over there
im hearing all this
bickering over here
now what the problem
oh we just were
having a bit of conflict
about a job opening
oh what job opening
uh the executive
pastor position
executive pastor position
first time im
hearing about this
well i heard
about it from kat
the wino daughter
look as head deacon i should
at least know about this
well i am so sorry
i forgot to post it
on the church website
but probably wont
need it anyway
well why is that
well because the
pastor has placed myself
and her--
and me
in charge in his absence
so you know
i guess whoever does the
best will get the position
well what is
this position pay
60 grand vision
health retirement--
and we get what
the church house
church house you
mean the two bedroom
the two bath garage that
grill and basic cable
you sound
like a game show host
and a jacuzzi right
mmhmm
i could use that bump
mmhmm
well hey where
the pastor at anyway
oh he went to haiti
haiti
yeah
when the pastor gets back
i need to talk to
him immediately
you hear me right
loud and clear
thank you
jacuzzi oh yeah
scuse me can i help you
miss grace that you honey
yes--
how you doing
im fine miss pumpkin
how can i help you today
no im looking for pastor
oh well im here
in his absence
is there something
that i can do for you
uh ill just
talk to sabrina--
no no no that
what im here for
im here to help
what can i do for you today
okay well
i need to talk to the pastor
about these choir robes
uh huh
i mean theyre old and
frayed and we keep altering em
instead of replacing
em with new ones
okay well then how
much does it cost
i dont know sabrina
does all of that
okay well let me help you
let me figure
something out for you
okay how many robes is it
okay okay wow that a lot
i didnt know we had that
many people in the choir
well you know it
takes a lot to make
a joyful noise like us
you know what i mean
yes yes
okay so oh im gonna
find a price point for you
and ill be in contact
with you and let you know
how much it costs--
no look
im just gonna deal
with sabrina cause
working with you is redundant
but i really do appreciate you
i mean i really do
miss
pumpkin how are you
hi
sabrina my girl
miss grace
yes oh hi mr sandros
i heard you talking
about these robes

one of the best cooks here
chicken and dumplings
chicken and dumplings
look i need some money
okay but the thing is

you but no thank you
and you youre always working
well you know they keep
me working miss grace
yes but you know we have
some new young congregates here

that a good idea
oh you didnt hear
hm hear what
they going to haiti huh
yes he went to haiti
wow
im having like a
really rough day today

i dont see you as an executive
what do you mean
oh no no not like that

of the country
i find that hard to believe
one day i will go though
i will go out of the country

with you huh
i can be subtle sometimes
all right
well have a beautiful
day mr troy

church and you love god
you will be blessed
that right

today
girl no that was in 993
but if i keep the faith and
believe in god ima win again
miss bessie

until i do im not gonna quit
im gonna win this lottery
in the name of jesus

cant say that
about somebody--
i got proof and i
wanna bust him out
in front of the congregation

me the evidence that you have
and then ill present
it to the pastor
sweetheart you pretty
but you aint that pretty
you cant solve this problem
usher mike
deacon thompson
you know he dipping
in the collection plate
and he smokes
marijuana cigarettes
oh my god what is
wrong with these people
what do you mean
back stabbing
betrayals gossip
this is why i left
he corporate world
you know a lot
of people think
that working at a church
is a bed of roses
they forget about the thorns
oh man but what
if the silver linings
of leaving the corporate
world is avoiding politics
and boss butt kissing
ive been here
for almost one day
and everybody here
stressing me out
one day grace one day
this job is probably
not for you
this is probably a
sign of what to come
oh dont fret yourself honey
mother thomas you always
find a way to sneak up on us
that how you hear all
the good gossip honey
she always does that
i think when she dies
she gonna haunt us
and were not gonna even
know the difference
you got a funny
way of saying things
but im not sure what youre
saying is good or bad
mother thomas
you know i love you
that-a-girl
look grace darling
dont come in here
and get yourself caught
up with all this nonsense
that goes along with our church
it was here before jesus
was walking the earth
and itll be here after
what
matters is your heart
and whether you act or not on
the love that jesus put there
everything else is
babbly nonsense
here have a snack baby
no mother thomas
i just dont understand why
the church is so flawed
that the whole point
the church is the one
place that people can go
be themselves and still
be accepted none-the-less
you of all people
should know that grace
ow
dammit
i mean shoot

accessory right now anyway

a dvr bessie jo
boy i dont mess
with that nonsense
you know the man is watching us
dont you know that
calm down i
called this meeting

news from yesterday
it seems our executive pastor
was taking money from the
church for the past three years
how much money
well how bad is it
were gonna lose the building
calm down calm down calm down
we gotta find that
man and string him up
that what im talking about
perhaps maybe someday

right now we only have one
week left in this building
a building that weve called
home for the past 88 years
ive watched most
of you grow up here
that is unless our own
grace hightower can help us
all right grace
oh well she pretty
but that about it
ill believe it when i see it
well she assured
me she has a plan
so let hear the lady talk
come on grace
hello all hello
praise the lord
i fell asleep reading the
foreclosure papers last night
and while sleeping
i had a dream
that i was there when jesus fed
the 5000 people in matthew 4
and you were all there too
hallelujah
except for bessie joe
she was off somewhere
gambling fish
hallelujah
that bessie joe
in this dream a
little boy showed up
with five loaves of
bread and two fish
and everybody laughed
at him and they sneered
and they started
packing up to leave
but then jesus showed up
with his eyes deep
with the confidence
of the good shepard
the apostles they were scared
but jesus was confident
dont play
oh my god he just
started passing fish
fish all around
i was way in the
back in the dream
the fish was going
to get to me guys
there were people behind
me people beside me
i thought they were just gonna
fight to get to the fish
but they didnt have to
we all got fish
including you guys
we all got food
offa the fish
and that when i realized
our god is an abundant god
he makes a way out of no way
and i believe god
showed me that dream
to represent this church
i believe our miracle is
found in this here document
that right
what does it say
it says that if we can
get this debt paid off
before their next meeting
the church is ours to keep
well how we gonna do that
and how much do we
owe three $400000
2 million
2 million
oh man that
just plain crazy
listen people
there was nothing that
impossible for god
okay okay
come on guys he turned
two fish into a million
what could he do with
the money in our pockets
what kind of miracle
are you expecting grace
here what im proposing
i propose that we
give today give
where your money is there
the heart will be also
yes where your money
is there is your heart
right now
let give today everybody
out of our pockets
let make it
happen let give

pastor youre back
good morning grace
good morning when
did you get back
this morning
you must be exhausted
yes i heard
about pastor frank
pastor tomorrow
we lose the church
unless we come up with $500000
and that exactly what
i wanna talk to you about
my church
hey
good morning church
what a beautiful day it is
it goes without saying that
it been a tumultuous week
and i play a big part in that
and i wish to apologize to
you all first and foremost
as you may or may not know
im part of our
denominational missions board
and there was a major
tragedy in haiti
they needed me as
soon as possible
and still need people
if you feel god
tug on your heart
to serve our brothers and
sisters in another country
as a result i was mia for
the past couple of weeks
though i feel those
who stepped up
to lead this church in my
absence did a spectacular job
particularly grace and sabrina
i sincerely thank you both
which leads me to my
next announcement
as you know our executive
pastor mr frank
quit a few weeks ago and
moved out of the state
and with him he
took our mortgage
that he stole over the
past couple of years
leaving us unexpectedly
with a massive debt
the litigations will begin
shortly i assure you
but that doesnt negate the
issues we face as a church
how can we keep this building
how can we keep our
home of over 80 years
i understand miss
grace hightower
managed to muster up
about 60% of what we need
which is an amazing
feat in itself
but there is still a deficit
and a large one at that
so what do we do
we find ourselves in a
valley a dark valley
and not from our
own doing this time
someone pushed us but this
shouldnt be a surprise
for god assures us that
this life is filled with
both valleys and peaks
but what would a peak look like
without experiencing the valley
furthermore the one
who caused us the fall
what should we say about him
do we condemn him or forgive
as our lord im
sure already has
i would argue that
the first step
towards escaping this
valley is forgiveness
and so i urge all of
you to find your own way
to let go of this sin and
once we have forgiven again
follow in the footsteps of
the one we claim to follow
once we have with his help
moved past the offense the
next step is to simply look up
though it be dark in the valley
the sun will yet rise and
though it will take time
for the blessed rays to strive
our darkest faces they will
and when they do the path of
the darkness will be revealed
and we can step forward
i am very happy to stand
here today and say that
your prayers have been answered
it seems that while
i was in haiti
a fellow missionary
who i have never met
approached me
he is from a church about
our size in illinois
one that has done
great work worldwide
and domestically even
here in los angeles
this man approached me and said
he felt a tug on his heart
about three months ago
to raise a significant
amount of money
for an unknown congregation
somewhere in
southern california
one he felt was located none
other than the city of angels
and as it turns out
this man church
managed to raise exactly
a half million dollars an
incredible amount of money
for an unknown cause
am i right
now before you all start
looking for jobs in illinois
some of you may know that
despite your valent efforts
in fund raising
we are short exactly a
half million dollars
plus a few cents which is
why it was 00% god doing
when this man approached me
and offered all of the money
he had to give to
us to our church
hallelujah

celebration begin
