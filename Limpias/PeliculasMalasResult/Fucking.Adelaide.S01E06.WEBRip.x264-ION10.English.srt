
hush-a-bye
dont you cry
go to sleep my little babies
when you wake
you will find
all the pretty little horses
the bees and the butterflies
mm mm mm
mm mm mm-mm-mm-mm
shh
the first guests will be here
in 0 minutes what are you doing
im hungry
well there is a helluva lot of party
pies and sausage rolls out there
you go and dig in
cleo
whatd she say
is it time
where the funeral dead body
bereavement assistant lady gone
yeah bianca
she said shed be back soon
i dont think we couldve done
these last few days without her
i dont think
we could have done anything
without that death doula
do you think mum knew
a natural home funeral
would be so much fucking work
how the eulogy going
yeah you want run anything
past us first
me
you dont want to say something
doesnt the oldest do it
oh youre the performer
hey i cant prepare a speech
in eight minutes
are you seriously
not saying anything
does it have to be me
ill do it
great
yeah that good
that makes sense
what do i say
all you have to do is just
think of some nice things
about mum
ok
nice things
ah like how shed always let me
have that special cereal on sundays
or like whenever she was
on the phone to you emma
and youd be talking about work
and shed say
stop it youre making me so proud
im gonna start lactating again
you remember that
but we cant make this speech
about us
this speech has to be about her
it doesnt even look like our mother
weve spent three days with this body
and i hardly see her there anymore
her hair
ah
some of her hair came off
ok
oh
emma it in my hand
im gonna vomit
it ok give that to me
just sit down
you um you keep thinking
about those nice things
just keep thinking about that eulogy
ill fix this
ah
yeah the nice things um
there was that time
that she broke my teacup set
and then every day after that
she would leave this peace offering
of a new cup out the front of the
i cant say that
she liked
what did mum even like
i still cant get used to it
the smell
the smell of decomposing body isnt
that bad when it someone you love
it been three days already
surely she should have been embalmed
or something
no embalming
is environmentally unsound
mum was very specific in her will
and after five days
the maximum you can keep me at home
without embalming or proper
refrigeration
you will cover me
with a shroud of your choosing
kitty will know
the one that i like
and bury my body under the gum
in the backyard
sorry
i still have no idea
which shroud she means
why are we even doing this
why are we trying this hard
to follow her instructions
i mean
do you think she knew it was
illegal to be buried in the backyard
why did she even request that
if she gets buried
in the backyard
she not getting buried
under the fucking gumtree eli
if she gets buried in the backyard
doesnt that mean geoff technically
owns the burial plot too
the man relinquished all his rights
when he murdered our mother
but if he gets off
he in prison he gets nothing
but if he got charged
with accidental death
the coroner was very clear kitty
but if he did get out
he not getting out
everything that was maude
is solely ours now
and were not burying her
in the backyard
we cant do everything she wants
wanted
but if she wanted to get buried
in the backyard
doesnt that mean
she didnt want to sell the house
so if we sell the house
is that
bad
maybe she just didnt get
around to updating her will
maybe she didnt want
any of this anymore
well it does say um
during this time
family and friends should come
round to our beautiful house
for an afternoon
to be able to view my body
and for a wonderful celebration
to say a final farewell
there liquid dripping
from the bed
our beautiful house
that sounds like
she wanted to keep it
eulogy
liquid
what
there a great big puddle
is it the icepacks
tell me it just melted icepacks
oh she leaking
oh fuck
oh my god that smell
how is that even possible
surely the coroner had to deal
with that stuff
the coroner doesnt prepare anything
eli
the coroner just released maude
to us and me and kitty
and bianca the death doula
did all the body preparation
as per mum wishes
no thank you to you eli
well she not going to care now
is she can we just wait
bianca will be back in a minute
well clearly not because
she shouldve been here already
now people are arriving
so maybe we can we just
figure this out ourselves
tampons
are you serious
no no bianca said you could
use tampons for something like this
one of you get out your tampons
well i dont have any
what do you mean
you dont have any tampons
i thought i was only gonna be
in adelaide for a couple of days
kitty do you have any
i dont know
i moved out remember
kitty think
would mum have any in here
i have no idea
um
surely our mother wouldve gone
through menopause by now
surely
god i dont even know if our mother
went through menopause or not
this is gonna be the worst speech
whatever you say kitty
will be perfect
just get something down on paper
maybe
found some
super tampons perfect
how old do you think they are
does it matter
it doesnt matter kitty eulogy
i dont know what to say about her
there a present here for me
despite eli and i having birthdays
two days apart
she never made us
share the same birthday party
fuck
no that great just keep going
no we cant make this about us
this one got an auto-tuner on it
maybe why dont you just think
of a funny story
what like when mum started leaking
eli pass me another tampon
kitty a tampon
i remember when mum tried to teach
me how to put in a tampon
for the first time and
i was really nervous
mum
no
just letting you know
folks have started rocking up
yeah just some last-minute touches
cleo just wants to have a moment
before everyone else comes in
mm-hm
youre messing up her hair
i know toby
emma let me help
no stop no no no fixing from you
as you can see were just
were not quite ready
so maybe if you two could come back
in a second
i just want a moment
yeah
i get it but we just need some
time with our mum first darling
i just wanted to give this to her
dont take another step
no more yelling
im sorry for the yelling
but stay over there
what the hell
please just go
what wrong
i havent had a moment
i understand
can somebody please take her
out of here
the bees and the butterflies
fluttering round your eyes
go to sleep little baby
when you wake you will find
all the pretty little horses
how black and bay
dappled and grey
go to sleep little baby
when you wake you will find
all the pretty little horses
go to sleep little baby
de bees and dem butterflies
peckin out its eyes
oh my poor little baby
it wasnt that version
oh it was a slave song
it a mother singing about
her own child not being cared for
while she sings for the owner baby
that doesnt make sense
why would mum sing that
you guys ready
got lots of people out here
you ok
whoa
i dont know how that got there
kitty kitty kitty
ah hi everyone
um thank you so much
for coming today to celebrate maude
um
i dont quite know
how to start this but um
ah
um we didnt want to make
this speech just about us
and i didnt want to make it
about him and what he did
and um
but all i can think of
is that maude loves us
loved us
im sorry i never cry
kitty kitty kitty
sorry
um
one time i came back early
and i didnt tell mum
i wanted to surprise her
i had prepared a big speech
about how well i was doing in sydney
how great my life was
since i last saw her
how proud shed be of me
ah so i came around the back
to just where you are standing now
and i spotted her
she was right
just right there
and she was smoking a joint
and she seemed so happy
and content just
smoking by herself
i didnt know she smoked
did you know
did you know
did any of you know
yeah
none of us knew
why didnt she want us to know
so i walked back around
to the front of the house
and knocked on the door
surprise
and she was surprised
and she was really proud of me
and everything id been doing
this isnt fair
because i always told maude
that i would only come back to
adelaide for christmases and funerals
and now i havent broken that pledge
maybe i shouldve a long time ago
maybe we all could have had
a joint together
maybe we still can
maybe ill stick around
so can i make one final suggestion
can we go look for maude stash
i wont be a winner
yeah
and you wont be a winner
you can just tell
you can just tell you can just tell
that ill never make it
you can just tell
you can just tell
that ill never make it
you can just tell
you can just tell
that well never make it
