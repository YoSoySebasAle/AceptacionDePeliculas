
why you
hey have you seen a little
boy with height like this
with an apple
yeah over there lad
wait here ah
there you are you little blimer
hold on a moment what is going on here
much obliged pastor newton
now if youll just hold him
ill give him the caning he deserves
as a point of personal
privilege sir no one shall
be whipped in my presence
then you deal with him
what has he done wrong
sir fighting with the
other boys disobedience
swearing he tipped over me stall
oh sir he a bad seed
these are serious charges
im serious sir please
stand back and let me give
him the caning he deserves
not in my presence mr chapman
fine he your problem
you deal with him
ha
thank you sir
fighting eh swearing
these are serious charges
youre ms watson oldest arent you
aye she me stepmom
hmm well i was about to
go inside for a spot of tea
would you like to join me
might there be any biscuits
well there might be let go see
so fighting and swearing
you wouldnt understand
no
how could you youre
the parson and all
i think i might understand
much better than you think
i was once a little boy myself
and i think by the time i was
your age i had been expelled
from two different schools
for fighting and swearing
you never
hmm yes i wasnt always
a church parson you know
in fact ive been a great
many different things in life
ive probably done things
far worse than fighting
and swearing
like what
well i was a cabin boy on a
ship i was a ship captain
later on i was even a slave for a while
nah sir youre leading me on
no im not would you like
to hear a little of my story
well are there more biscuits
hah there might be
yes and more tea as well
of course it was all a very
long time ago you understand
but i dont think that little
boys have really changed
that much do you
i remember my dear
mother as if it were only
a few weeks ago
she taught me to pray
she taught me to read
by reading me the scriptures
she died when i was only six
my father was a merchant
seaman a captain
while im sure that he
loved me in his own way
i dont recall ever feeling loved by him
he soon remarried a beautiful young woman
who bore him other children
she wasnt terribly
interested in me and so
he was away at sea and i
ended up in boarding school
it wasnt long before i was
expelled from that school
for the same sort of
trouble youve been in
do you mean fighting
aye and general disobedience
when i was young i had this
hot core of anger inside of me
that burned all the time
and it was out of control
i couldnt control my actions always
aye
you do understand dont you
it wasnt long before i was
expelled from the next school
for the same thing and my
father decided that the only
thing to be done was to
take me to sea and so i went
on a ship with him when i was
we served as cabin boys
carrying and cleaning
and doing whatever any
grownup sailor wanted done
but that burning core of
anger was still inside me
and when it would burn i
would always end up in trouble
there suck on that young master newton
maybe youll think twice
about slinging blasphemies
around in me galley
i took my anger out
on the other boys the ones
who were smaller than i and
ended up in trouble again
but in spite of the trouble i got into
i grew into a man aboard
merchant ships and i became
an able-bodied seaman
ship leaves next wednesday
for jamaica we can use you
if youll sign on
aye sir i will ill be
visiting in kent for a few days
but i can be back for wednesday
little did i know how
those few days in kent
would affect the rest of
my life for it was there
staying with friends of
my mother that i met
the love of my life my polly
her name was mary mary
catlett and almost from
the first time i saw her
my heart was a captive
my secret nickname for her was polly
my dear polly my beloved
she was a little younger than
i and her beautiful smile
melted my heart and made a
permanent mark upon my soul
mr newton i shall speak
plainly we loved your
dear mother and held her
in the highest regard
mary is too young yet for
any decision but her father
and i do not object to an
understanding provided--
yes
provided that when you
return from your voyages
we will see some signs of
stability and of prospect
prospect
prospect for a living mr
newton is of great importance
yes i shall keep that
in mind mrs catlett
and i shall return
now i went back to sea
with a goal in mind
to make my way to find
advancement to make my fortune
so that i could return
and marry my dear polly
the beautiful memory of her
smile of her sweet face
got me through many long watches
and lonely nights at sea
but even the memory of her smile could not
keep me from trouble that hot
anger burned inside me still
and would boil over at times
send him to the surgery
and you youre on report
reduced rations for a week
and of course i was
a seaman at sea no different
from any other when it
poured i joined heartily
in the sins that waited any sailor
oh
but not all
temptations were in port
ah youre a fool if you
believe all that blatter
all of this can be explained
by reason and science
ah there no god up there
the rationalists have it right
is that what you do
when youre off duty
read philosophers
aye there lots of hours at sea john
lots of time to think hobbes voltaire
they make more sense than a
pack of priests mumbling latin
ah nothing but superstition
to control the rest of us
you should read hobbes ill
loan you his book leviathan
and so i too became
a sailor-philosopher of sorts
spinoza and hobbes often
made quite a deal of sense
and just as often made
me doubt the simple faith
of my childhood
one night at sea i
fell asleep over a book
and i had the strangest dream
one that would come back
to me again and again throughout my life
as long as you preserve this
ring you will be successful
and happy but should you
lose it or part of it
you must only expect sorrow and distress
you believe that ring is magic
as long as i preserve and keep it
i should be happy and successful
are you knocky boy
what a simpleton you believe
anything youre told dont ya
it seemed right
what right about it some
stranger hands you a ring
tells you it magic it a
talisman and you believe him
what a
seriously john how can
you buy such claptrap
you ascribe magical powers
to a wee piece of metal
shaped in a circle
id be ashamed to admit such
superstitions to another man
dont you understand
that by subscribing to
such superstitions it saps your
own human powers of reason
throw it away
go on throw it away
create your own faith
take control of your own
destiny go on throw it away
go on go on show youre a man
aye
oh you are a fool what a
believe anything
youre told but now
youre lost for that ring
contained in it all the mercy
and now it gone at your own hand
what did you do with it
i threw it away
i threw it away
where did you throw it
i brought it back for you
no
if youre to be entrusted
with this ring again
you will soon bring yourself
to the same distress
youre not able to keep it
but i will preserve it for
you and whenever it is
needful i will produce it
on your behalf
it wasnt long
before that voyage was nearing
its end and i would be
able to return to kent
to visit my polly as the ship
turned home all my thoughts
had turned to her and the
prospect of again seeing
her sweet face
but it was not to be
less than five miles from
her house i encountered
a press gang these were
the days of an impeding war
with france and the navy
needed fresh men all the time
press gangs roamed the country
authorized to virtually
kidnap a likely young
lad and press him into
the service of his majesty navy
run it a press gang
aye he awake
welcome to his majesty
navy what your name son
ah john newton
were at sea
aye a day out of
liverpool you was the last
conscript brought on board
here drink something
itll help you feel better
what the ship
hms eridge newly
commissioned man-of-war
under the command of captain carteret
were on our way to france
to defend king and country
were always fighting
with france or spain
ever since eve bit that apple
i was on my ways to
propose to my beloved
ah that a shame four
years well be out i expect
four years
aye
oh
captured carried away from
my love against my will
imprisoned at sea
each day on the ocean took
me further from polly
and increased my resentment
hey johnny johnny
you got to get along with
the other sailors weve
all got our crosses to bear
leave me alone
the smoldering anger that
had always burned in me
was now a fire of resentment
i obeyed orders i did my job
but i did so with a solemn
attitude in my mind god
himself had cheated me
why did you do this to me
am i such a sinner that
you just singled me out
for special punishment
ive nothing to do with you
but i was no fool i soon
perceived that i had a greater
chance of liberty if i was
promoted and so i began to focus
all my rage into hard
work and efforts to please
the officers not because i
had any true respect for them
but because i saw it as my
opportunity for a change
so i started to work hard
aye sir
and i showed officers great respect
newton
aye sir
good job seaman
thank you sir
at least to their faces
fool
you wish to see me sir
aye mr newton
your father a merchant captain
aye sir
ive heard good things
of him he written me
asking that i consider
you for advancement
ive spoken to the mate
and he says that you have
been an exemplary seaman
i try my best sir
that the attitude what
would you say to being promoted
to midshipman
aye sir i would like that very much
didnt think youd refuse
so be it you are promoted
to midshipman
being a midshipman meant
that i was a sort of apprentice
officer and i was set
over my former mates
come on you sluggards get to work
do that mopping i want
that cleaned up
aye sir set the topsail
belay the shrouds
sails mended seamen
while i behaved with perfect
form to my superiors
the rage inside me often
was taken out on the sailors
who were now under me much
as i had once bullied smaller
children
you call that a knot seaman
aye sir figure-of-eight
it a throbbing mess
take it apart and start again
aye sir
talk back and therell be
no rations for you tonight
aye sir
after some months at
sea patrolling the channel
and even fighting skirmishes
with french ships
we had to put back into
plymouth for repairs
and then it was that i had my chance
mr newton while we have
repairs im going to permit
a rotational shore leave for the seamen
im assigning you to go
ashore with them and supervise
to make sure none of desert
aye sir
it was as if the master had
left the cat to guard the cream
ill be back at sunset
anyone not here and ready to
return to the ship shall
be counted as deserting
and youll feel the lash
aye sir
all right off with you
here at last was my
chance to go see my polly
i wasnt much on thinking
things through in those days
and it didnt really occur to me
that desertion would catch up with me
john henry newton
i have a warrant for your
arrest for the desertion
from his majesty navy
mr john newton charged
with desertion from
his majesty royal
navy a charge punishable
by death when found
guilty by court-martial
or lesser punishment by a ship captain
as defined by article 6
of the article of war
captain what shall be the punishment
he shall be demoted
from his present position
and stripped of all rank
he shall be tied to the
main mast and administered
2 lashes with the cat
let each of you witness what
happen to those who desert
from his majesty service
no one shall speak a word to
mr newton for seven days
no one shall show him
favor no one shall share
any ration with him other
than the bread and water
assigned by the galley master
are these instructions clear
aye sir
you got your own now dont
you mr high and mighty
you got nothing more
than what you deserve
enjoy your meal sir
it healing up you can sleep
in the hammock from now on
well have you up swabbing
the deck in no time
mr jensen
master word to mr jensen
mr smythe
master word to mr smythe
and mr newton
but captain sir
i said mr newton sir
master word to mr newton
the captain had
conscripted two gunners from
a passing ship maritime law
required that he replaced them
with able-bodied seamen
so that the civilian ship
would not be shorthanded
this gave captain carteret
the perfect opportunity
to get rid of some troublemakers
able-bodied seamen my
arse two here with scurvy
and one barely recovered from the scourge
well i can tell ya
youll feel the cat again
you disobey on this ship
aye sir
this is a slave ship well
be 8 months on the triangle
serve well and youll be
rewarded serve poorly
and youll be punished understood
aye sir
dismissed
i came to like many
of the sailors of the levant
but the old rage still burned inside me
but now it was directed
all at the captain
that a sloppy bit of
work there mr newton
if that the way you
worked on the eridge
no wonder you got flogged
aye listen up mates ive
come up with a little song
about old mr phelps up here
♫ did you ever see the
lines since you been to sea
♫ let the good ship rock
♫ a benty-leggy captain
with a bent back knee
♫ wobbling down the dock
♫ wobbling down the dock
♫ let the good ship roll and rock
♫ better call a coward
or cower up the wall
♫ wobbling down the dock
♫ wobbling down the dock
♫ let the good ship roll and rock
♫ better call a coward
or cower up the wall
♫ wobbling down the dock
well anchor at the banana
islands in sierra leone
tomorrow ill need a
crew of three to row me in
to meet with the trader
harkness smythe and newton
the following day well

where well load the cargo
i like that

it might be nice for a while
i wanna get back to england
and i wanna see my polly
smythe harkness make ready the boat
newton you stay here with me
mr campbell this is
mr newton the young man
i was telling you about
it a pleasure to meet you mr--
you wont be so pleased
once you understand the deal
ive traded you mr newton
youre gonna stay here
as a servant how do you like
them apples mr funnyman
so youve met the lash
youll meet again soon enough
if you dont serve well
youre my property now
newton and there no way
off this island without me
knowledge or me permission
so dont you go be
getting any bright ideas
you have to be a servant
for me wife serve her well
do as your told and your
life will be much easier
but you buck against and
youll find out just how
hard a life can be
you guards take him to peyai
she always wanted to have
a white man as a slave
and now she got one
he is not much to look at is he
give him a mat and chain
him behind the house
first we must break him
my defiance my sins
had all caught up with me
i was a slave
they gave me only a
little to eat for days
just enough to drink to keep me alive
we take the chains off
today you are peyai slave
do you understand
you must do exactly as she bids
if you try to run away we will hunt you
and chain you if you
disobey you will be whipped
if you try to run away
twice we will kill you
slowly in a way that will make
you wish for death to come
do you understand
yes
now go
and serve your mistress
ah my little white man
oh you must be so terribly
hungry how could you
have treated my little white man so badly
here let me give you some food
you would like something
to eat wouldnt you
im sure you would im
sure you are starving
the food will taste so good
she worked me like a mule
she seemed to take particular
delight in watching me suffer
often making me do chores
that were simply pointless
ah very good now that you
have placed the logs here
put them back and place them
exactly where you found them
newton newton i want
some fresh coconut milk
go bring me some
newton newton
newton
where is my coconut milk newton
i want my coconut milk now
where is he
you are useless even as a slave
for a long time
i felt nothing but hunger
and despair i could never
forget that i was the lowest
form of life on the island
even the native slaves
had thatched huts to live in
while i had to sleep on
the ground under the stars
on the other hand
campbell and peyai lived in
a great brick house at
the center of the island
i was seldom allowed in the big house
and then only to do menial labor
but as long as i obeyed
peyai abusive commands
they fed me a little and
i regained some strength
in mind as well as body
one night i lay looking at
the expanse of the heavens
i began to try and see how
many constellations i could
identify how many stars
i could name this became
a nightly game that became
a private area of freedom
for me and i began to dream
again of my dear polly
my beautiful polly
i wonder if i will ever see her again
then one night it seemed
to me that a group of stars
formed a circle a ring a
constellation i had never seen
before and never since
it may have been my eyes playing a trick
or perhaps a planet had wandered
into an unusual position
visible from this latitude
but that night i could indeed
see a ring a ring like
the one in my dream
youre not able to keep it
but i will preserve it for
you and whenever it is needful
i will produce it on your behalf
during the days when peyai was in a mood
i would work very hard but
then there would be hours
of boredom when there was nothing to do
one day i found a small lime
tree growing near the village
that seemed much like me
beating and starving despairing of life
i adopted that little tree as my own
and began to take care of it
to water and to fertilize it
i found other seedlings and
planted them in what became
my own little garden
one day campbell had me move heavy crates
into the big house i was
alone for a few moments
and there i came upon a
dusty old geometry book
i took it and hit it under my mat
i began in my spare time
to work geometry problems
scratching diagrams in the sand
using the sun and the shadow
of my little lime tree
i calculated the latitude
and longitude of the islands
we were on
which were commonly
called the banana islands
just like the stars like
the little lime tree it gave
me something to focus
on a space that was mine
and mine alone
there was little that i
could do with the knowledge
but the exercise did much
to keep my mind occupied
and sharp
one day when i was tending
to my little garden
and passing the time with
equations written in the sand
mr campbell and peyai
walked down the path
and caught sight of what i was doing
newton what are you doing man
are you growing your own limes
i was terrified that
peyai as cruel as she was
would make me destroy my
little place of sanity
well who knows maybe
one day before those
trees are full grown you can sail back
to england and you can be
the captain of your own boat
then you can come back
here and enjoy the fruits
of your labor
then again perhaps he will
become the king of poland
what is this
do you understand the mathematics
yes sir i taught myself
oh you might not be a
complete waste after all
here are a set of equations
id like for you to solve them
what is it a test
aye if you will i want
to see just how good you are
with these mathematics
sit down sit down
im in need of a clerk to
manage me factory at kittam
they dont very many people
in sierra leone who understand
numbers
factory
aye it me slave
trading post it where
the bombo bring the
slaves from the interior
and make them ready for
transport to the west indies
my brother runs the factory
but he in need of someone
who can keep the accounts
you will go there
you will serve him now
the guard will take you
at kittam my life changed dramatically
i had new clean clothes
to wear angus campbell
treated me well almost as an equal
the bombo treated me with respect
inviting me to their feasts
i thought of polly often
before long i had given up
any hope of ever returning to england
my circumstance had changed from one
of daily despair to one of comfort
i had all i needed food
shelter clothing respect
and even women
thoughts of england faded
and my life in kittam
began to envelop every part of my being
the other settlers even
had an expression for it
they called it going native
what are they saying
it means freedom
but then came the
day when my entire world
would suddenly change again
as if a lightning bolt
had struck
mr newton a man here to see you
mr newton mr john newton
yes
im archibald gother
captain of the hms greyhound
out of liverpool
ah welcome captain gother
are you here to pick up
a shipment
not exactly you see
im here to take you home
me what are you talking about
your father commissioned me to find you
and bring you back to
england whatever the cost
ive been stopping at
every trading post south of
the canaries searching for
you and finally here you are
my father
mr newton
there she is the greyhound
after this we got two more ports of call
to pick up ivory and beeswax
and then we should set sail for liverpool
and for you home
captain gother a month
ago i wouldve told you
i had no hope or even dreams
of seeing england again
i was prepared to live out my days here
perhaps marry a native even
have my grave right here
in west africa if i
believed in god i would say
his hand had brought you here
believe it for who else can it be
and so i began my journey home
not as a crewman but as a
passenger on the greyhound
freed of the duties i was
used to i had many hours
at sea to think to think about my life
to think about life itself
it was during these long hours of leisure
that i discovered a book
the imitation of christ
by thomas a kempis i began reading it
not as a meditational work
but as a work of fiction
and entertainment to pass the time
but as i read the involuntary
suggestion came to me
what if these words were
true what if the faith
of this long dead writer
was in fact a reality
that i simply did not understand
i could not bear the inference
as it related to myself
dimly remembered scripture
verses came unbidden
to my mind especially
fearful passages that speak
of the judgment of those
who know the way of truth
but then depart from it
what if i were one of them
what if the faith i had
abandoned was in fact
the driving reality of the universe
what if god hand had in
fact been the moving force
that brought me to this
point brought gother
to sierra leone to rescue me
what if i had turned
my back on the very god
who sought to save me
i was so caught up in my
own thoughts and meditation
that i had not even been
aware of the storm that
had engulfed us
all hands on deck john
mister hey get that canvas down
pilot down pilot down
get newton get newton
i know where he is
god save us
thank you
i thought back then on that
powerful recurring dream
that had haunted my life
i will preserve it for you
and whenever it is needful
i will produce it on your behalf
we had survived
the most terrifying storm
of my life at sea
but more than that i had
a glimmer of new hope
a spark of faith in my
heart in my darkest moment
i discovered a chance of reconciliation
with a god that i had long
dismissed as mere fiction
that was march 0th 748
a day that i would mark
for the rest of my life
as the day of my conversion
there is little doubt that
our very cargo had saved us
the beeswax and the we carried
being both lighter than water
the greyhound was so swamped
with water that we surely
wouldve sunk if it were
not for the flotation
of the cargo itself
but was god hand not
present even in this detail
as we limped back toward
england tripled with only a few
sails i spent most of my
time reading the scriptures
meditating and praying
to the lord for mercy
and instruction
i began to see my life in
a different perspective
the burning anger that had
driven me as a younger man
was now faded
i began to see that my
entire life was that as
the parable of the prodigal son
not in a figurative way as
most people understand it
but in the most literal reality
land ho
we sighted land on
april 7th the irish island
of tory the next day we landed at swilly
finally i was safely
home after misadventures
that seemed like a storybook
so did you see your father
no
see god ways are very strange
you see the day i arrived in liverpool
i discovered that my father
had shipped out only the day
before for canada hed been appointed
governor of york fort
in hudson bay colony
i never saw him again
how sad
did he know that you were safe
oh yes we were able to write one another
so he knew the whole
story but he died there
in canada and was buried there
and i never saw him again
however god gave me a
new father as it were
joseph manastee who owned the ship that
i had returned on took me under his wing
and treated me as if i were his own son
he got me a commission as first mate
on a trade ship and i did very well
much of the rebellion in my
spirit the burning anger
had been washed away in
africa and i no longer found
myself always attracted to trouble
my new station in life
secure i could at long last
go back to kent and to my polly
my beloved polly
after years of remember
her face as in a dream
i was finally able to marry my dear polly
the love of my life
according to god holy
ordinance and thereto
i give you my truth
with this ring i give you my heart
with my body i give you worship
and with all of my worldly
goods i thee endow
in the name of the father and
the son and the holy ghost
amen
before long my benefactor
joseph manastee promoted me
to captain captain of my own ship
the duke of argyll
the duke of argyll was a slaving ship
so my job as captain was to take the ship
to the west coast of africa very close to
where i had been held captive
myself pick up slaves
there transport them to
the west indies there to
exchange them for molasses
and rum and return those
to england that why we
called it the triangular trade
wait you were a
captain of a slave ship
after you were a slave yourself
how could you do that
youre a very astute young man
no i was infant in the
faith and i really did not
see the evils of the
slave trade at the time
none of us did it was
considered an honorable way
to make a living
but you were held captive
how could you do that
to someone else
it was all too easy
you see attitudes are
starting to change now
but 20 years ago no one
questioned the slave trade
well save the quakers and
a few moravian missionaries
in st thomas
everyone in england that
had any money at all
had it invested in the slave
trade it was very profitable
and where profit is concerned
we turn a blind eye dont we
all i could see at the time
was that as a christian
ship captain my job was to
safely transport the slaves
from one port to the other
and treat them as well
as possible the same as i
might do with a load of cattle
it wasnt an uncommon on
slave ships for almost
a third of them to die
on that middle passage
they were kept chained below
decks fed little food
i prided myself on the fact
that only a few had ever died
on my ships
i devised a routine of regular
exercise for the slaves
so that each day they would
see the sunlight and keep
themselves as fit and healthy as possible
i insisted with mr manastee
that we have sufficient
provisions so that the
slaves could maintain
proper nourishment
and not arrive starved
i did the same with the crew
i was proud that my ship
had one of the best records
for delivering slaves
in good health
we only had a few deaths at
see i felt each one personally
and worked harder on
each voyage to make sure
that both crew and cargo
stayed healthy and fit
it may not seem like
much but it was far more
than most captains did in those days
i engaged the crew in
regular times of worship
ye shall have a song as in the night
when a holy solemnity is kept
and gladness of heart as
when one go with a pipe
to come into the mountain of the lord
to the mighty one of israel
let us pray
it was on this journey
that i had the chance
to return to the banana islands
to my own place of enslavement
i was even able to find
one of the lime trees
that i had planted with my own
hands so many years before
then came my third voyage
in 753 as captain
of the african
we landed in ghana to pick
up a load of 600 slaves
for transport to jamaica
it was on that voyage that
i began to first wonder
about the slave trade
that would be my last voyage
the weather looks good
im gonna sail the day after tomorrow
i shall miss you terribly
i so wish you did not
have to be gone so long
yes i know
but it is the nature of the trade
john
john john
im afraid he suffered a stroke
i could no longer command a ship
how sad
it seemed very hard
at the time but we were
later to understand that
it was a blessing from god
a blessing
yes a blessing you see
when god closes one way
it is often for a reason
that we do not know
or understand captain potter the man who
took over the ship for
me and his entire crew
were killed on that voyage
god preserve us
yes he did preserve us
and it was a deep lesson
because what we thought
was a curse at the time
actually was filled
with much grace
we moved back to polly
family home in kent
for my recuperation
during this time living
in kent i had many hours
of leisure which i often
spent outdoors i had hours
and hours for bible
study and for meditation
i spent many hours discovering
the layers of grace
present in our lord redeeming work
slowly i regained some of my strength
but i knew i would never
again captain a ship
however my knowledge of
the business enabled me
to obtain a position as
tide-surveyor of liverpool
a position of great responsibility
ahoy
surveyor state your cargo
00 barrels of rum and a
hundred barrels of molasses
from the island 75 barrels
i worked for the custom office
and was responsible to
inspect incoming ships
to make sure the proper
import customs were paid
to the government even
with the remaining weakness
from my stroke i could
still discharge the work
with responsibility and
yet have the free time
to study the scriptures as i desired
now that we were settled
in a house in liverpool
i made the most of my free time
i determined to know
nothing but jesus christ
and him crucified as paul
wrote in  corinthians
and i resolved to do
nothing that would not serve
that main purpose
i began to learn greek enough
to allow me to understand
the new testament and the
septuagint and then i began
studying hebrew the following year
i never attained a critical
skill in any of these
languages but i had no goal but to truly
and faithfully understand
the scriptural words
and phrases so that i
could judge for myself
the meaning of any particular passage
together with this i kept up a course
of reading the best writers
of christian theology
i could find
out of this gradually arose a new desire
my mother hope when i was
a child was that i should
enter the ministry
now for the first time i
began to feel a strong calling
in that direction myself
it was not a calling of
which i felt worthy
but i felt in some ways
i was the perfect person to proclaim
the faithful saying from  timothy
that jesus christ came
into the world to save the
chief of sinners
my life had been full of
such remarkable turns
i seemed selected to show
what the lord could do
my initial enthusiasm
was damped by refusal
after refusal to consider
me for ordination
i did not give up easily
but in rapid order
i was turned down by
the established church
by the dissenters by the methodists
and by the presbyterians
though not yet ordained i
began to preach at churches
around liverpool and to be well received
the lord bestows many blessings
upon his people but unless
he likewise gives em a thankful heart
they lose much of the comfort
they might have in them and
this is not only a blessing
in itself but in earnest of more
king david when he was
peacefully settled in
his kingdom purposed
to express his gratitude
by building a place for the arch
i began to receive more and
more invitations to preach
or to speak about my life experiences
polly polly read this

the parish church of st
peter and st paul in olney
oh john it is an answer to our prayers

but finally my dream to
server as a parish pastor
would become true

i came to be the pastor
of this parish of course

ago before you were born

yes and let it be a lesson to you
for the story that god
has in mind for you may
be very different from
what you have planned
the great adventure is finding
god will for your life

here it is
john newton
yes here read it
john newton clerk
once an infidel and libertine
a servant of slaves in africa
was by the rich mercy of our
lord and savior jesus christ
preserved restored and
pardoned and appointed to preach
the faith he had long labored to destroy
he changed my life
a few years later he was
called to st mary roman church
in london
when i was old enough i joined him there
and through him i met william wilberforce
and joined the movement to
abolish the slave trade
it took years the bill
passed parliament in 807
the same year that mr newton died
and the same year that
you were born alexandria
but he lived to see the
abolition of the slave trade
oh so he did it
well not he alone but
many working together
he did change the world
and he changed my life
the life of a little boy
who was hurt and angry
at the world
he taught me something of gentleness
and of god grace
and i hope you have a chance
to learn of that grace as well
