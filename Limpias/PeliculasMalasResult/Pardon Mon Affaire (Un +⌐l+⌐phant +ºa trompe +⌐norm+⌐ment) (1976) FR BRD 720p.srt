
on that heady morning
where from my privileged position
i could hear the birdsong
preceding the sounds of the city
i reflected upon the fortune the audacity
and dare i say it
the ingenuity that had led to my being there
a place where my imagination albeit colourfu
could never have brought me alone
six weeks earlier i had been
a strictly one-woman man
contentedly enamoured of family and homeland
a man whose gaze was never averted
by female passers-by

that afternoon i was back at work
as is only natural
for a man whose destiny
is suddenly shaken
i was perfectly aware that
i was planning for the first time
to betray marthe
and the thought of it appalled me
the stares from colleagues
oblivious to the drama
now unfolding
devoted to their stupid work
nevertheless pierced me
i interpreted them as disapproval
although challenging a society
whose morality i respected
i must confess that
the young lady in red
had set my conscience ablaze
now that enough lucien
ive had it up to here
why wont you answer my letters
what letters i didnt get them
ive never heard of 4 letters
going astray before
lucien

the window
of your room
i love your breasts
especially the left one
ill tell your parents

and what did old beady-eyes
spot galloping through the mist

no
next day
hello godmother
it was thursday
braving marthe questions
i removed my riding boots from
the bag which had been their home
since 958 the year of de gaulle
return to power
although the two events
were entirely unconnected
that summer on lle doleron
having been trained
by enthusiasts
my riding activities
were curtailed
by a falling-out between horseflesh
and my good self
as marthe was quick to point out
i countered tartly that she had
gone back to college
20 years after her last failure
then i kissed her censuring myself
for my fit of anger
thus attired i sallied forth
on the arm of my godmother
with whom i lunched or dined alone
every thursday of my life
i gave no backward glance
but i could feel marthe eyes
following me closely
she was still puzzled
as was the horse
that had to contend with me
i set off at a sedate pace
so that my mount
would stay the distance
but its happy-go-lucky nature
soon led me astray
and thus did it dawn on me that
desirable as women are
horses are high
and forests deep
it personal
would you like to make peace
what do you mean who that
someone who had supper alone
at the recamier
rue recamier
is that you
it is you my mother had an attack
at about 8 pm
i spent the night at ambroise pare
obviously you had
no way of knowing
much better thank you
she up and about
do you know the ascot

on the champs-elysees

as i said in my letter
youll need a jab
im not going to mexico
with you lucien
otherwise it southern morocco

and conventional
i must say
that just the way it is

poor fool

it you who small and poxy
ive been running
it was ringing as i arrived
no go ahead

at the ministry or his place
dont worry about me
therell be fifteen of us here
and i dont know how long
what
you know it wasnt very smart
to call me small and poxy
you must be unhappy
to resort to that
why are you giving me
all these details
because youre explaining
everything
the phone the germans
the schedule
ill scream
so will i
youll be more embarrassed
youd better call simon though
he expecting you to dinner
i told him i wasnt free
i didnt know you were
yes i suppose it for bouly kid
she came
how come youre here
you mother hairdryer was
playing up it the fuse
it worked this summer
when me and mouchy
did the massif central
i wont be cooking souffles
mind your backs
come on you scouts
it ready
dont you have anything
for stoning olives
it all in the bag plates bowls
camping table
what that what time is it
come and sit down
help yourself
what was your totem
dont wind me up
i was never a scout
do you want to know
how i stoned the olives
there
artistic isnt it
youre disgusting
so you made it how are you
just imagine that idiot went and
anyway he didnt turn up
we waited and waited
to employ a rather bold image
we are but pawns
have you eaten
i hate anyone going through
my things you did it again
yes i did
my sister advised me
to get a bailiff report
what does your sister know
she going to be a lawyer
ill have you know
it nothing to do with bailiffs
surely you dont expect her
to pay you alimony
sorry but he makes me laugh
go and have a word with him
mouchy cant you see
talk to him i say or would
you rather i put the gas on
then say so now
hello etienne dont get up
hello my poor bouly
simon told me youre living alone
i envy you believe me
youve had a haircut
want some
no thanks
still as beautiful as ever
flatterer
i get a letter perfectly innocent
nothing improper
you can read it
a boy i met at some friends
it a free country
he can write cant he
mum
well him
he makes a fuss
by what right
i said until were married
keep your comments to yourself
know what he said
why are you telling us this
if i cant even get a warm welcome
at my son
you want me out too
no but you just turn up
like a tornado
everything was nice and peaceful
so you expect me to write
before visiting
i live next door but i need
an appointment like a patient
look at these men here
theyre staring at you
have you no shame
no shame are you talking to
your mother or mrs luberon
mrs luberon
no shame
what mrs luberon
got to do with it
i know what youre up to
with mrs luberon
women liked simon but they had
to like him discretely
for 35 years hed had
this love affair with his mother
she was his sunshine and his bane
the man who lived with her
was called charles du tillet
his playful stoicism
commanded our respect
mouchy liked to claim he was
an international sports shoe boss
he looked a lot older than he was
he had his reasons
consumed by problems which
with hindsight were academic
my friends failed to realise that
despite my missed rendezvous
i was setting sail for a strange land
populated by just one woman
in matters equestrian
my progress stuttered somewhat
oddly the animal seemed to
sympathise with my predicament
even keeping lookout
behind the locker room
from where alas we saw no sign
of a woman in red
at the ministry my sporting
development went unnoticed
still mrs epseranza behaviour
towards me
remained inexplicably shady
i was racked by questions
i dared not ask her
the advantage their intuition
affords women over men
had maybe alerted her to an intrigue
the day i was mad enough
to call the young lady in red
in her office
it all suggested that mrs esperanza
a wife and mother
was siding with marthe
whom she had never met
whatever the reason
after much thought
i opted to ignore her
despite the provocation
i did suffer however
a short period of depression
come on forwards hey
forwards come on
however futile my search
i was as patient as ever
but it was taking its toll
physically
especially as i had to keep up tennis
which marthe knew
i was so keen on
nevertheless i likened
my predicament to happiness
when compared
to the misfortune of a friend
who always put on
a brave face for us
despite his anxiety
marie-ange had vanished
bouly was camping out at home
with the equipment
lent to him by simon
as for myself just as hope
was slipping away
my life became a fairytale
whoa morning glory
he exquisite i know horses
id seen him many times
in his stall and he
he whoa he
he superb
yes she is beautiful
weve met before
let me see
the ministry
when i signed my contract
are you sure
do you ride often
every day for years now
and you
no only for the last 4 or 5 years
then you must have started as a kid
about the other night
it was cruel but well played
the other night
all right
oh my whip
apologise morning glory
when a horse is stupid
careful morning glory
thanks
youre welcome
now keep still
you forgot that
sorry
excuse me
well then
about time
hey dont rush
sorry i had a puncture
again
your phone was engaged
change your tune or your tires
did a bird bite your knees
no dont you believe me

simon is serving come on
just a minute
let him warm up
hell warm up as he plays
give us a break will you
come on serve
ive located the kids
what
and you just say it
i could hardly sing it
where
with their uncle in dunkirk
were not even allowed to warm up
and marie-ange
still underground
ready
if she comes back
do i thrash her
i think that up to you to
simon

carry on playing boys
play bouly
i just want a word with simon

and he woke me too

last time
i was the one who hung up
i love you
one two three
i know he away
mum

what do you want
it now or never my love
to do what
go away
leave me alone
leave me alone
thisll be disappointing
but i have to be frank
im not as tenacious as moreau
in a sentimental education
really
i have to be tough
very tough i know it hard
to be dumped when youre 40
but lucien raki is out of your life
it for the best
are you for banning hgvs
from the banks of the seine
why do you ask
ive got a job
with a polling organization
so since im here are you for
well i dont know
against
goodbye madam
anyway you gave me a thrill
at that moment
had i sifted through my past
id have had to admit there had been
more pleasant nights
yet in this foreign land
where chance had plunged me
i felt the mad wind of adventure
on the back of my neck
a woman awaited me in london
another in paris while i was
stranded in sleepy brussels
next day
charlotte made light of the fog
and winged her way back to paris
there followed a succession
of thrills
every day between 455 pm
when i left the office
and 550 or 552 pm
when marthe came home
with or without her classmates -
it fair to say that in the hour
we had together
charlotte and i
lived life to the full
alternating exhilarating excursions
with hilarious meetings
charlotte and i cultivated
the mystery of charlotte
she said little about herself
i dared not violate her silences
better still so that she would
never for a moment suspect
the obscenity of my intentions
i was careful never to suggest
that we meet after nightfall
we would part
without leaving an address
her breathless with pleasure
me face puffed-up with desire
meanwhile marthe passed the exams
that had so daunted her
she failed just one oral
and was ready to re-sit
so hard
you wouldnt believe it
i admired her
as for me i was promoted
without exam or intrigue
and given martin-guyot job
when he opted to put
his pension fund to work
i was now head of the whole floor
and my promotion
rather than exciting jealousy
as was the custom
heralded unexpected
friendly overtures
from the more aggressive souls
i was far too busy to seek
an explanation for this upturn
on which although mystified
i congratulated myself
that summer the lives of others
also took a bewitching turn
simon
married off his mother
he was delighted
and we shared his joy
charles married reluctantly
but as mouchy said at the reception
lt the result that matters
the wedding party was rambling
showy and a triumph
whose is this
mine
youre too careless
but the best surprise
of the following week
was the sudden reappearance
of bouly wife and furniture
the reasons for her return
were vague
simon and daniel claimed
they had precipitated
the reunion the evening
i had spent away from paris
but their account of the incident
was confused and contradictory
as for bouly
he thought deep down
that the charm he exuded
was just too powerful
for the poor girl to resist
sad to report that the very next day
he was to be found
fishing in the same waters
for which he had been punished
ill call you in the middle
of the night
and say im mrs luberon
youll come and find them in bed
dont do that
anyway you dont know her name
what is her first name
come on tell us

a month ago i met an unmarried man
with no kids
who likes horses and traveling
in a month youve got married
and had two 4-year-old daughters
weve traveled as far as
the top of the arc de triomphe
you dont get on horses
rather horses get on top of you
in the country your clothes
are ridiculed by children
and you fly to belgium
while im waiting in london
stop gazing at your shoes
and look at me
after what happened earlier
i want you
like ive never wanted anyone
now why is that
i dont know
i want your hands
i want to see your body unclothed
you mean to say naked
why
best not look for explanations
i suggest you remove your bow tie
pitou it marthe
are your parents there
mum and dad are out im alone
only he isnt at simon
everybody seems to be out
no matter
know when theyll be back
no my dad broke a chair
had fate decreed that i should be
a man of national destiny
the night i had just spent
would have gone down in history
having fuelled my gluttony
with her silences
charlotte said in a second
what i had been unable to say
for a month
come
a wonderful command
that put a spark into my life
but such is the ugliness
of the male soul
that leaving marthe
did not cross my mind
not even for an alimony
amounting to 358% of my salary
after deductions
as it would have others
in my position
simone
simone
what is it
nothing it my husband

your husband

thanks to your bullshit
she left me for good
marie-ange
we got back so late
she thought i was with some bird
shit
damn
did she take the furniture
no what up with you
there was a ruptured spleen
so his nibs here
when luberon got there the guy
was dead so he went home
found fat boy and
but he was nice about it
took me to get the bullet out
what a guy
isnt etienne with you
why would he be
not the ladder it scares them
nearly always makes them jump
come on
did she say shed drop by
if only to see the kids
at the junction of rue de tilsitt
and avenue de la grande armee
the building is right on the corner
of the two streets
fire chief commandant claudon
is on the scene with his men
who are trying to reach the ledge
from the roof
who touched the aerial
not me
that chap looks like dad
etienne
be sensible sir
dont stay there
jump be a good lad
come on jump
be a good lad ok
with charlotte gone
i was suddenly troubled
by the thought
that should marthe leave me
it would not be without good reason
nevertheless i took steps
to ensure a soft landing
i counted in my solitude
a large number of women
in the welcoming committee below
i couldnt help noticing
one of them
photographing me
one of those blondes one refers to
as platinum
in actual fact
my ascent had barely begun
