good citizensof westerville
i come to you this dayas our nation is on the
precipice of war
now some of you here ifought with 5 years ago
in the war with mexico
i commanded you then buti come to you today not as
your officer butas your neighbor
your friend andfellow patriot
our nation is endangeredby the same imperialism as
it was when we marchedthrough texas
will we do no less whenthat danger is on
our very soil
applause
ladies and gentlemenwelcome with me now
bishop william hanby
applause
as many of you knowprior to my founding the
otterbein collegei traveled over 4000
miles on thecircuit in one year
during my travels i sawmuch injustice and hate
it has made me a man ofstrong convictions
and i founded thecollege to serve others
and it included within itswalls men and women
of all races
i have made my voice knownand shown my scorn for
injustice and i willcontinue to stand against
any law that makes it afelony to give food to a
hungry slave or be friendprecious men women
and children whodeserve freedom
the fugitive slave lawof 850 is inhumane
it is absurd that givingshelter to a friendless
man woman orchild is a crime
we may be boundby a man made law
but we are more bound bya lord-given conscience
ohio has alwaysbeen a free state
it was the first statein the union to outlaw
slavery in itsconstitution
we should stand as boldas the writers
of that constitution
today many of you willjoin the union army
and you shallbe that bold
may god bless you as youmake your choice to stand
for the freedom of all
how can a christianminister stand on that
platform and support thebreaking of the law
especially a law thatprotects the property
of a person
a human being cannot besomeone property
when a man-made law isin conflict with god
law there isno compromise
we choose oneway or the other
you are nothing buta freedom crusader
it says injoshua 245
choose you this daywhom you shall serve
as for me and my housewe shall serve the lord

thank you so much
you both need to rest
someone will bring youinto the house for food in

just close youreyes and rest
everything will be fineand you will see
freedom light soon
where haveyou two been
you both misseddinner and lizzie
you have strawon your clothes
we helped them jennie
girls wherehave you been
ruth you have strawon your clothes
we helped them mother
helped who
obviously youve beenout helping runaways again
yes but i went out andfound her and she fine
she led the runaways tothe barn and give them
food and water
yes and itwas exciting
was it
it was wonderful
yes but the bountyhunter has made helping
the runaways evenmore dangerous
as excitingas it may be
and as much as we allbelieve in our cause
it simply too dangerousfor you to be running
around in the woods
especially with thebounty hunter in the area
besides thatfather job ruth
and clearly theretoo much of him in you
the bible says thatruth was born for
such a time as this
lizzie thatwas esther
but that goesfor me too right
what can i say to this
dear emeryas i write you
i sit outside my tent in camp
i am happy to be here with my cousin reed
and i am very happy you are at home with liza
i have established friendships with several
other men as well
their names are john billings daniel lewis
isaac griffith and jacob wolf
i suspect that we shall all remain close
throughout the struggle ahead
we have made ourselves at home and as i settled in
i think of mother and father
i smile when i remember how excited they were
about the free soil party and how proud i think they
would be that i am fighting for the cause
i can still hear them arguing with dull faces
that free men on free sale made for a morally and
financially better way than the way of slavery
i remember when mother called them weak timid
half-baked men
i think being here makes a person sentimental
of fond memories
i think of how our family once had been as i look
into the faces of these men of courage
i can see lizaface as well
that sweet smile of mysister warms me as i think
of myself and all of thesemen preparing for the
battles thatlie before us
we have set up camp near the b and o railroad
and i have found that the 4th ohio is
filled with great men
at this point were so confident that we feel we
could single handedly defeat the entire
confederate army
stay safe and true to the cause your brother clay
talia what areyou doing here
did you escape onlyto be caught again
i will not let mysisters be
taken to kentuckywhere nellie
she in anotherwagon somewhere
were going together tonightnow you must go
how can ileave you two
quickly that how
even if you save me wemay not reach nellie
we cant let her go alone
she only a child
i will stay with nellieand you will be free
your spiritshall be strong
and your feetshall be quick
your path shall beordered by the lord
yes estellei understand

nellie and i willescape into ohio
and i will telegraph adinsheridan in westerville

skilled labor

her master for the labor

freight trainthe next day

girls giggling

tea party with all ofyou for breakfast

oh yes
yes please
what do you thinkabout last night
i think if there abounty hunter around here
we should findout who it is
you think weshould find out
yes it is aperfect plan
a bounty hunter wouldnever expect a
group of girls to belooking for him
i would notexpect it either
i think itis a great idea
we should getstarted right away
and i have experiencein this area
once i caught johnnytaking an apple from
miss audrey orchardbehind her house
there a bigdifference between a boy
taking an apple and a manin the woods with a gun
very goodclarissa-bell
the first clue
the bountyhunter has a gun
i think we knew that
yes what men intown have a gun
seriously
pretty muchall of them
let go into the woods
and begin lookingfor clues now
yes
let us all go runaround the woods in
our nice dresses andlook for clues
any ideas
maybe we should splitup and two of us go
in that direction
maybe you andjulianna head that way
so ill go with ruth
and liza will gowith julianna
we need a signal
my brothers usuallywhistle loudly
who herewhistles loudly
i guess i can
let hear
screaming
silence
perhaps we should justyell for one another
clarissa-belllook at this
i will bethere shortly
hurry hurry
it looks like arope and scarf
i am sure it a clue
it looks rather dirty
yes it does
ruth youre gettingyour drawers dirty
how can you careabout drawers
at a time like this
*
hello girls didyou find any clues
i think we did
we found thisrope and scarf
whered you find that
it was beside atree in the woods
so i got down andpicked it up
so let me guess yougot your drawers dirty
yes sheabsolutely did
yes but i thinkwere much closer to
finding out who thebounty hunter is
and i suppose weregoing to continue
until we find him
i know thisis a good thing
well be cautious
and well always tell youtwo what we are up to
and your brothers too
remember that is the deal
yes our brothers
and remember lizabrother will help too
i have no brothers
you can have mine
laughing
dear bishop hanby thank you for showing me
the meaning of faithfulness
i have watched your uncompromised stand to god
and for what you believe
your family has been faithful to emery
liza and me
i will fight for freedom and above all be faithful
to the lord who is faithful to me
i want you to know that i intend on being faithful
to this noble cause
i promise to defend my country against treason
and conspiracies and to vindicate honor to our
glorious stripes and stars
the last few days have been days
that ill never forget
weve been marching without pause toward
philippi virginia
the men were exhausted and in want for water
food and rest
even then the 4th are ready to fight
we knew and hoped that we would smell
gunpowder soon
scouts were sent out regularly
my cousin reed and i were honored to be
chosen for such a mission
quietly
quiet quiet quiet
quiet boys
quiet
come on quiet
quiet boys
quiet
the enemy could be justdown over there and we
dont want them knowingwere here do we
okay clay reed jacobi want you to go down
this road here easealong the woods
see if you can seethe enemy down there
go ahead and take off yourhaversacks and canteens
i dont want nothingclanging around
all right if you guyssee anything down there
send one of youback to report
the other two just keepan eye on them okay
let go
be cautious
keep your eyes down
we scouted ten miles that night and never saw
any rebels however we did see
where they had burned bridges
there was only the reflection of water where
they had once stood
i ask that you follow me and my company
with your prayers
pray that i am an example of patriotism
that if we should need reinforcements
i may inspire others to enroll as faithful
defenders of the union
we in the 4th ohio volunteers have pledged
ourselves to a no more noble sacrifice than to
further peace for all men no matter their color
and for our government enduring honor
i must now close as my regimen has been told
to remove all that is encombering us
were making a large pile of napsacks haversacks
blankets and all our articles so we can move
on in double quick time
we should arrive near philippi at daybreak
my best to you and your family
yours clay
we need to rememberclay in our prayers

and have lost my conductor
ive been followingthe north star
come sit down
i will get you some bread
my name is molly
im estelle
but i will singof thy power
yea i will sing aloud ofthy mercy in the morning
for thou has been mydefense and refuge
in the days of my trouble
you can read
i learned to when i wasyoung and lived in virginia
my brother can read
his name is samuel and immeeting him in ohio soon
he has promisedto teach me how
im on myway to ohio too
im going to meet mysister talia there
perhaps wecan go together
there is to be a boatat the ohio river
in three nights
yes yes iwould love to go
im really happy tohelp jackson and the
runaways but i just keepthinking of my sister
youll have to keepyour focus samuel
keep focused on yourfreedom and the
freedom of others
one at a time we willhelp set them free
but i just keepthinking that--
no keep your focus
the promise landis obtainable now
israel was caught inslavery for hundreds of
years and walked inthe desert away
from the promise
do not let your mindget caught there
youre right
i cant let my focus becontrolled by my emotions
and i have to keep myfaith that molly will find
freedom just as i have
free yourself from thephilosophy of slavery
see yourself as free
see molly as free
with that focus samuelthe lord will strengthen
you with his faith
you will be able to seewith the eye of faith
you find any tracks
yeah i think so
look at this
john parkeris a wanted man
and we who are withhim are just as
valuable to him
$000 dollars
who has that much money
im sure the localslave owners
have gotten together
it doesny saywhere to take them
the bounty hunterswouldnt know where to
take any of us
then why post flyers
to use fear as aweapon to stop us
gunfire in distance

my brother emery i have just finished
fighting in the battle of philippi
i could hear your voice encourage me
after leaving behind much of our gear
we marched on to philippi in double time
there was a woman favoring the rebs
that spotted us and fired a pistol at us
this started our cannon fire
as we advanced on the town those rebs
were not ready for us
it was a site of victory
the confederates were asleep from the effect of
their whiskey and the convincing tones of
our artillery finally awakened them
to their perilous situation
the rebs began running from their tents
as they attempted to dress
dont worry aboutyour fancy stuff boys
grab your guns and go
the yankees are coming
come on boys come on
the value of the spoil was amazing
it was quite a contrast as before this we had
nothing to eat but hard bread and raw ham
now the camp is filled with activity
food and laughter although were dealing with picket
fire nightly and ready for more battles ahead
im finding that my time with the 4th ohio
has changed me
i know im a more noble man
i know i will stand strong in the next battle
that lies ahead
your brother clay
that it
what do you think
it was a veryinteresting story
yes it was
im sure the graybacks wont always
be so foolish
there will be strugglesahead without a doubt
and you need to go
yes i do
i cant sit hereany longer while
clay is out there
this is everythingthat clay and i have
it will be enough tohelp you take care
of liza for a long time
emery youdont have to
yes i do
how will youget to clay
i know a chaplain whois going to meet
the 4th ohio tomorrow
im going with him
okay so we need to goover what we know now
well we havea rope and scarf
i took the scarfto the general store
mrs young said thatit is a fabric
and pattern they sell
did you ask her whoshe had sold it to
yes and she couldntremember exactly
however they were allpeople she knew from town
did she havereceipts of the sales
oh yes but she told mei shouldnt be so nosey
what about the rope
not at thegeneral store
i checked at the horsestable in town
there nothing like it
i checked the baker andblacksmith and did not
see anything like it
you checkedthe blacksmith
yes he seemed tothink it odd i was so
interested in his work
well we need tofind this rope in town
there has to be moreof it somewhere
i heard emery tell willthat the gun that was
fired in the woodswas a revolver
he said there werent toomany people in town
who own revolvers
that good to know
i think we shouldfollow the money
what do you mean
someone in town shouldhave a lot more money
that true
there are reports of fourrunaways being caught
maybe we shouldcheck with the bank
i dont think mr ripinat the bank will help us
we need to keep a lookoutfor a man with a new
wagon or clothes orsomething that shows
he got money

you realize we cantlet you go back right
but i have awife in kentucky
write her name
i cant write
what her name
florence jamison
but i will neversee her again
the only reasonyou found out where
mr cumberland livesis because some kind
soul had pity on you
if we allow you to returnthen theyll beat and
torture you until youtell them where we are
if you found the strengthto remain silent
then theyd kill you
going back isnot an option

then well sendher to you
before the sun rises illtake you to the station at
red oak and youll beon your way to canada
i understand sir

way to the river

tonight we should moveback where the bounty
hunter caught the girl
we should pray for aclear sky and full moon
so we can see well
yes
i was taught to trust inthe lord and that is
what we are gonna do
my mama told me a storyabout a runaway named
liza liza came thisway in the cold of winter
with a baby
she got to the edge of theriver and heard the dogs
barking behind her
she saw the light at thetop of liberty hill
there was no boat
so she stepped across theice jumping from patch to
patch all the way acrossthe river to freedom
that is an amazingstory molly
she made it acrossthe river estelle
and so are we
yes
were gonna get acrossthat river molly
but now we have to sleep
we have to runagain at dark
go ahead
i will take first watch
i am too excited to sleep
very well

how does that happen
well when the rainclouds arent big enough
to cover the sun
kind of likehard times huh
they arent bigenough to cover hope
yes lizajust like that
we received our firstletter from emery
shall we read it
yes
our dear sister liza and our dear friend audrey
i am here with clay now
we are both doing well and are healthy
earlier today i experienced my first action
it was a squirmish in the field against some rebs
gunfire
dramattic music
gunfire continues
get your head down
reload like thison your back
is this whatit like corporal
i thought wed befighting standing up
this is squirmishing
youre out front keepingan eye on what the
rebels are getting at
now keep your eye onthose cavalry out there
you see themget ready to run
okay
get up get upget up come on
okay
let go
shortly after the squirmish
the rains began and have not stopped since
the close companion to the rain is the mud and
someplaces ankle deep
our army issued clothing becomes so heavy with
water it nearly drags us to the ground
we can hear cannons in the distance
it is a small comfort to be safe in our tents but
i cannot help but feel for our comrades who have
pressed on to the battle at ridge mountain
is it raining whilethe sun shines there too
miss audrey
i dont think so liza
hey

are meant to be

in the savior love a love that demands that all
men are created equal on this earth
we can do nothing more for this cause my dear
liza than to stand courageously through the
fight for the rights of others
i know you and miss audrey are doing the same
as we are away

dalin
what happened to dalin

what are youtalking about
dalin is thebounty hunter
how do you know
because all ofthis was in his room
i should have known
it all makes sense now
new hat nice food
all the new clothes
he promised he wasntstealing but i never
thought of this
it not yourfault julianna
it was right undermy nose the whole time
no julianna
you cannot think that way
your brother madehis own decisions
you never couldhave stopped him
wait a minute
a $500 rewardfor talia edmondson
this is lottie
she at myhouse right now
does dalin know that
if he doeswere in trouble
julianna and i willgo warn my father
we will take the shortcutthrough the woods
music
make way let me pass
please let the girl go
youre in noposition to stop me
im within the law
dalin whatare you doing
come no closer bishop
let me pass
there no rewardin it if you shoot her
im merelyobeying the law
it is you whois breaking it
yes dalin
i am breaking the law
a law that is a stain onthe soul of this nation
but look at yourself
you hold within your handthe life of another
is that withinyour rights
move out ofmy way bishop
im turning this fugitiveinto the authorities
i will notlet you take her
dalin
julianna
julianna what areyou doing here
how could you
youre my brother
juliannawe needed the money
not that kind of money
we had to eat
i would eat dirt beforei ate the food of bondage
how can you say that
youre in bondage toyour own wants your own
self your own pride
father --
father set free everyslaved we owned
yes and he left us
he left us with nothing
and youre justas greedy as he was
youre in more bondagethan any slave
how can you say that
because the bondage yourein runs deep to the soul
i will pray for youdalin but if you continue
this i will neverspeak to you again
julianna
julianna
julianna
dalin it is time foryou to stop reproaching
the person of freedom
freedom is no person
on the contrary theperson of freedom is the
light that will set youfree from the bondage of
yourself and thebondage of greed
bishop idont understand
there was a man whotook men women and
children into bondage andled them to slaughter
oh he acted within thelaw but it was on the road
to damascus that he felland saw the light the
light of freedom
that was the turningpoint in paul life
this is the thatmoment for you dalin
open your eyes
see the light
walk into that light

god is good

music
what brings youto my home today
ive come to tell youthat i have not informed
anyone of the undergroundrailroad which you run
from your home sir
all we do from ourhome dalin is as the
lord leads andlove commands
i want tothank you sir
thank me
in all honesty itbecause of julianna that
youre evenhere right now
it is because ofjulianna and you sir
that i have changed
i know that iam a new man
how are we toknow the same
because of a man namedpaul in the book of acts
please let me read
then ananias answeredlord i have heard by many
of this man of theevil that he has done
he has the authority fromthe chief priests to bind all
and the lord said unto him gothy way for he is a chosen
vessel unto me
i am that man
yes
you have taken a riskfor the lives of others
you know my reputation
you know what hurti have brought
yet you sit here becauseof the lives of so many
because that is the kindof man that you are
dalin as someone whopaid for his own freedom
from a wicked man i knowthe meaning of captivity
i walked many a mile formy freedom only to walk
back again and spend timein jail until i paid for it
then you understand howgod can get a hold of a
man for a greater purpose
i also understand thatthings that appear to be a
risk arent a risk atall when seen through
the eyes of faith
it is my prayer thatyou will trust me
once again sir
and if not i will dowhatever you ask to again
earn that trust
i want to join theunderground railroad
just as the slave traderjohn newton came to
realize his needi have also
well --
excuse us father
no anna lottie wait
it safe
all right father
what is happening here
dalin was just sharingthat he is changed man
i would like tosincerely apologize to
you lottie

concerned about travelingso far with them
i dont know the areasor the bounty hunters
bishop hanby ivetraveled the road from
here to ripley takingfugitive slaves back to
their mastersfrom kentucky
i know all the localbounty hunters
i could be your cover
if youd allow meto go with adin
lottie whatdo you think
i think he should go
no one would expect abounty hunter to be
helping a fugitive
please sir
this is somethingi have to do
adin
if he can be trustedsir it would be
very beneficial
i believe you areto do this dalin
you told me thatyou are like paul

shoulder arms
left face
forward march
men who moments before were asleep and hungry now
began marching like soldiers with
determination in their faces ready to face
whatever was ahead
we marched at such a rapid pace that by  oclock
that afternoon we caught up with the gray back
rear guard
they were cavalry and after a short exchange of
gunfire they scattered quicker than my chickens
back home
by 2 oclock we had reached the chief river
after fording the river we received word from
skirmishers of a line of rebs waiting to ambush us
we volleyed three rounds in their direction
ready
aim
fire
fall back
fall back boys

yelling
the rebels took off running for their lives
after pursuing them for a mile and fording the river
again we found them formed in a line of battle
company ready

we were met with musket fire we returned fire and
called out or 6 pound canon to answer them
the gray backs fled again double quick time led by
their cavalry
what happened next was unexpected
without warning we were fired upon by the rebs
gunfire
steady boys
the almighty has blessed usand the rebel aim was high
now well giveit back to them
ready

by the grace of god the rebs had aimed high
and missed
we relentlessly fought the rebs for 37 minutes
we were given the command to advance and the
confederates began retreating

all that remained were ten rebs and an officer
hold on boys
well fight them here
stand strong men
fire at will
gunfire
it no use
surrender boys
five rebels and the officer were hit
five other gray backs surrendered
the victory was joyous but it did not come without
great loss for both sides
as we approach the confederate line there was
no celebrating
only the stark realization of the great price that
must be paid for this great country
look here boys

noble fight

will be reenlisting in the army and will not be
