i dont know if sunbathing on
the roof was such a great idea
whoa
all right everybody
now shake your body
loosen those limbs
this is fun
come on you can do it
it should feel like
youre climbing
up the side of
a mountain yeah

wow
im here to offer
some support
and jump two three

i think you can let go now
oh uh heh right
oh my gosh
i cant believe it
flash you just ran up
those bricks like zoom
and wonder woman
with the lasso
you were all
and superman
with the heat vision
you secured the base
with a pssh
batman swung in
and caught that guy
while green lantern
was putting the wall
back together
you guys are incredible
it is such an amazing
pleasure to meet you
you have been my hero
since i was just a kid
oop sorry
since you were a kid
by my observations
youre approximately
the same age as superman
same age oh no uh
i just meant that
watching you makes me
feel like a kid
hmm
anyway what a thrill
to meet you guys
i hope i didnt get in the way
not at all
in fact were grateful
mister
oh uh sorry
im shazam
uh shaz-what now
well shaz-bot
shazam
excuse me
shazam it was pretty courageous
of you to leap into danger like that
i know that one
of my powers too
courage of achilles
i used it just the other day
to eat some anchovies
how can we be sure
youre one of the good guys
totally understandable
but even if i wasnt
a great philosopher
once said
keep your friends close
and your enemies closer
so really what
do you have to lose
yep i know quotes
wisdom of solomon
sweet am i right
why does he keep mentioning
solomon atlas and the others
well i
his powers obviously derive
from each of the ancient heroes
he described
that makes up
the name shazam
s for the wisdom of solomon
h for the strength of hercules
a for the stamina of atlas
another a for
the courage of achilles
and m for
the speed of mercury
that means that
z must stand for
the power of zeus
still havent figure out
what that is myself
well whoever you are
we really appreciate
your help
my pleasure i mean
helping the justice league
so awesome
you should tag along
come to the hall of justice
see where the magic happens
i dont think
seriously
the hall of justice
like the hall of justice
oh man i i
be cool
this is the greatest thing
that ever happened to you
but just be cool
i mean i guess so
i dont have
anything going on
so uh yeah whatever
it not our fault
jeepers is right
we wouldve had your food
but the justice league
showed up
and ruined everything
enough
im tired of excuses
what i need is food
and if you cant get it
then i mr mind
will find others who can
yes
so powerful so hungry
so hungry
yes food
i need more food
excuse me sivana
how goes our small experiment
it done
this magically infused chemical
should do what you wanted
now can you stop
mind-controlling me and let me go
hmm nope
now jump like a kangaroo
mind control is the best
eat eat hunger
food
bring me more food
i must have more before
the justice league arrives
the justice league
here but how
call it intuition
and over here we have
our trouble alert system
if there a problem
anywhere in the world
well know about it
this is incredible
i
i think i might cry
hall of justice branded tissue
can i keep this
highly unsanitary
totally going
in my scrapbook
you guys i really cant
thank you enough for the tour
you all mean so much to me
the justice league has always
been a beacon of hope
in the darkest of times
ive always said
what would
the justice league do
i mean
it depends on your roster
that plastic man
is kind of different
but uh that doesnt matter
you guys have
helped me a lot
i might need one
of those hankies batman
well i better get going
i hope we do some superhero-ing
stuff together soon
no wait
i call
a justice league meeting
is a meeting necessary
we should be out
finding these monsters
i have their location
via the bat-tracer and
you know the rules batman
if one of us
calls a meeting
then we all must attend
should i go or
no stay right there
krypto will keep you company
it an ultrasonic whistle
one sec
a super-dog
ah hi krypto
arent you cute
yes you are yes you are
i think we should let him join
the league
but we just met him
not everyone is as reluctant to
join the league as you were batman
i like him
and not just because
he has a lightning bolt
on his chest
though that doesnt hurt
im with flash
there something
so innocent about him
you cant catch me
you cant catch me
or juvenile
i saw we take a vote
all in favor
raise your hand
shazam
we have an offer for you
an offer
wed like to invite you
to become a member of
the justice league
what is this for real
i i this isnt some
hidden camera show is it
there are 24 cameras
in this room
none of which you could find
even with superman abilities
no this isnt a prank
the reality is you fit all of
our justice league criteria
you have superpowers
check
fight for good
double check
and not a kid
check-aroni
so shazam what do you say
i will be
the best leaguer ever
i promise seriously
youll never regret this
shazam the justice league
is more than a
well-tuned crime fighting unit
it a family
a family
and families
are built on trust
shazam we think that
you could be a great
addition to the team
but in order for us
to fully trust you
we need to know
who you really are
not the superhero
but you
my uh oh no
dont worry
well go first
well except for batman
he kind of gets an exception
because he so grumpy
im not grumpy
yeah
i dont know you
no idea
i mean that not
even really a disguise
well sure it is
the star draws your view
from my face
not really
clark kent
oh wow you did
that amazing exposé
on building
without instructions
that was fantastic
oh thanks
i worked really hard
on that piece
ahem
oh right
so are you ready
to be part of the family
i
i
i cant
im sorry i i really am
i have to go
just as i surmised
shazam has something to hide
and this proves
he is not to be trusted
but you hide everything
bat exemption
no but i
bat exemption
now come on
we have monsters to catch
huh oh
hmm mm
i cant believe i didnt just
join the justice league
but if they knew that
i was just a kid
whoa is that guy flying oh man
nice cape
ive never seen a superhero
wow
look mommy
superman got a new costume
bye red superman
stay still
how did you even get in here
you pesky beast
oh hello billy
how was your day
oh you know
it doesnt take a wizard
to know something
bothering you
but im a wizard
so maybe it does
billy you can tell me
anything
i had
this great day you know
fighting bad guys
meeting my heroes but then
but then the justice league
wanted me to join their team
that sounds wonderful
it was except
in order to join
they said
they needed to trust me
which means i would have
to reveal my secret identity
and you were afraid
they would reject you
when they found out
you werent an adult
exactly
i know that in your heart
all youve ever wanted
was a family billy
somewhere to belong
ive tried to give you
that place
but my time is running out
soon youll need
to find your own way
and youll discover
that being in a family
doesnt come without
its own risks
risks
like what
trust my son
trust to share a part
of yourself with others
and hope that those you
share it with will accept it
youre talking about
you sharing
the power of zeus
with me right
the first guy you chose
to be the wizard champion
well i wouldnt say first
there was another
his name was teth adam
shazam
but he would become
mighty adam
he started out as
the hero i hoped he would be
but i was blind not
to see his growing ambition
soon he was corrupted by
his power and turned to evil
he tried to enslave the world
but after a long
and trying battle
i defeated him
no
and thus he became
black adam
what did you do
i locked him away
where he can never harm
anyone again
the point is billy
that even i
the wise and powerful wizard
risked something
and continue to risk
by giving that power to you
my true champion
aw shucks
what is it
the league
i sense a trap go
and remember billy
nothing creates trust
like helping those in need
wisdom of solomon
no common sense
now go
there you are
now just hold still
i hate moths
fan out
no sign of anything
out of the ordinary
strange the bat radar
indicates the tracer should be right
where that box is
oh i got it
no it a trap
right as always batman
the monster society
welcomes you
is that a talking worm i mean
come on we fight worms now
im no mere worm flash
im the powerful mr mind
the greatest villain
in the galaxy
wanted in over three quadrants
of the universe
for my evil evilness
and now i can add defeating the
justice league to my accomplishments
sivana if you please
huh
though my powers of
mental persuasion are strong
i know they could never tame the
superheroic minds of the justice league
well maybe the flash
thanks a lot
youll never
get away with this
i already have
the adult mind
is hard to manipulate
but the mind of a child
sivana fans
huh
what
it worked
of course it worked
dr sivana is no slouch
im a kid
well ill be
butter-churned in july
but i dont wanna be a kid
what are you talking about
i dont feel any different
turn us back sivana
this instant
sivana can do
nothing and neither can you
ah so easy
i have all of you now
wait i dont see batman
he gone
go my monsters
find the batman
and bring him to me
and now junior justice league
are you ready to do my bidding
well as pa used to say
does a cow moo when you pull its udder
what
ill assume
that a yes
so welcome to
the monster society of evil

thought you might need some help
i

is kind of dangerous
i

maybe shell take you out for a milkshake
or something those always cheer me up
i am batman
sheesh
mr mind transformed us
into children
in order to control our young
impressionable minds
but because im awesome i was able to
get away before his powers affected me

youre lucky i dont
take you out right now
i could you know
cause im batman
and batman is totally
the best hero
o kay
point is it pays
to keep people at a distance
so you
never get hurt
hemingway once said
the best way to find out
if you can trust someone
is to trust them
fine shazam
billy batson
hey
i dont understand
how did you
it all started when i helped you
during that two-face situation
oh no which one
which one
the red wire billy
i dont know who
the voice belonged to
i just knew it saved our lives
after that i went about
my usual routine
well billy that the last of the
money you got from recycling
hope this sandwich is worth it
cause im starving
spare some food
have a great day
youre a nice boy
billy batson
hey how do you know my name
that wasnt the only weird thing that
happened to me over the next couple of days
excuse me maam
let me give you a hand
youre
a nice boy billy batson
i just kept running
into the strangest people
hey mister you dropped this
huh
youre a nice boy
here for your trouble
free subway token
thanks mister
little did i know
that small token
would lead me
on an incredible journey
billy batson you have
been found worthy
that voice
climb aboard for
the adventure of a lifetime
what is this place
the seven deadly enemies
of man
whoa what a scary bunch
billy batson
ive been expecting you
you that old man
i gave the food to
that woman i helped
to cross the street
and that guy i returned
his money to
they were all you
yes
i did that to test you billy
test me test me for what
to see if youre worthy
of great power
and you are billy
never have i seen
a heart so pure
the world is a dangerous place
it needs heroes
heroes like you
all you need to do
is say my name
your name
shazam
sha zam
no no no
you cant just say it timidly
otherwise how would you
ever introduce yourself to people
thatd be ridiculous
say it with meaning
with purpose
shazam
after getting the power
of shazam i went to work
helping the city
as best i could
it was awesome
not just because i had
these incredible powers
but you know
because i was a grownup
sorry kid
maybe next time
next
whoa
one please
but even with
all that power
it didnt really matter
i just wanted to belong
to not be alone
you wouldnt understand
youre the batman
youve got friends a family
but being a kid
an orphan
it the worst
i totally understand if you
dont want to work with me
now that you know
uh im sorry
i know this is supposed to be
like an important moment
but i dont really
recognize you
maybe in your adult form
im bruce wayne
bruce wayne
like the bruce wayne
billionaire bruce wayne
the bruce wayne with all those
super expensive sports cars
the bruce wayne with the private
jet that has its own arcade in it
holy moly what that like
it okay i mean
i only have like
500 games onboard
no big whoop
awesome
listen billy
when i was a kid about your age
i lost my parents too
so i know what it is
to be alone
i took that fear and loneliness and
decided to do something good with it
just like youre doing
be proud of who you are billy
kids can be heroes too
my three former robins
are a testament to that
what you did that brave
showing me really who you are
that trust
i dont know what the others would say
but youre all right with me
now back to business
we have to figure out why the
justice league is gathering all that food
and how to stop that telepathic tyrant
mr mind
speaking of food im starving
ooh me too
hey wanna see something cool
alfred can i get two glasses
of milk and cookies
and not the oatmeal kind
maybe ooh something
with chocolate chips in it
as you wish master damian
uh damian im
oh oh yes
faster old man
old man
you have your own butler
not bad right
hell make me whatever i want
unless i make him mad
which happens more than
wait a minute that it
mr mind said that
in order to control us
he had to make sure our minds
were young and impressionable
but that also means
he has limits
and if im right
