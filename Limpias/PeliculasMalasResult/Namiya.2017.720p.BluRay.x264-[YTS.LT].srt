and tied someone up
namiya general store
small town musician
stay here
not sure if youre still in business
please excuse my impudence
my dream is to make good music
a musician
friends i once jammed with at bars
have released albums and headlined gigs
but i am still a nobody
i am my family only son
dad has just been taken ill
so i came home
in fact dad will soon retire
he has arranged for me to take his job
but im not giving up on my dreams
i dont know who else to talk to
if you happen to read this letter
i hope to get your advice
what
a corner store with no name
dubbed the namiya store by the locals
one can seek counseling there
by dropping off questions
at the front door
replies will be posted on
the wall the next day
if the question is personal
the reply is put in a
milk box at the back
this is 993
the no name corner store is namiya
i yes i know
must be an old letter you know
it got stuck and just fell down now
but this looks brand new
no smudges or stains
how can it be old
maybe this guy
didnt know the store was closed
so he writes in
hoping to get advice
bro
what era are we living in
who would still write letters
stop this nonsense
go to sleep
we leave at first light
well
will that musician give up his dream
i dont know
but to give up
is as hard as to carry on
if you were him
how would you choose
i have nothing to linger on
and nothing to let go of
wanna write a reply for the store
why not
what wrong with you two
paper
now that weve read his letter
we might as well give him a reply
stop this bullshit
have you thought about getting caught
since he wont come for
it until tomorrow
well be gone by then
id say
my dear buddies
take a good look at yourselves
know what kind of mess we are in
can you listen to me for once
fine
okay
write
your dad wants you to take over
so to hell with your music career
or you could live stream your singalongs
and hope you hit it big
as an internet celeb
well
happy now
where did you leave the letter
milk box at the back
just like the papers say
not this one right
he doesnt know what internet celeb
or live stream means
never heard of them
it been barely a minute
how did he manage to reply
it a few days
what do you mean
he said it in his letter
i thought it over for
days before replying
im telling you
i sense bad vibes the
minute i set foot here
no
wed better leave
let go
hang on
now what
i have an idea
xiao bo you write to explain
about the internet and live streaming
here
xiao bo
xiao bo
why did you come out
get back in
so nobody came to the back
but the letter in the milk box is gone
nobody came to the front either
right
still the third letter arrived
he doesnt know what a cell phone is
i cant stay anymore let go
we have to find out what is going on
let go
go
he sent us a letter
i want to give a reply to help him
fine
have fun
i am leaving
hungry
i thought youd left for good
i knew it
i cant leave you alone for a minute
what are you talking about
you were gone for nearly two hours
xiao bo almost passed out with hunger
i just saw an announcement posted online
saying that this general store
will revive for one night tonight
from midnight until sunrise
anyone who has received advice before
can again
write to the store-owner
xiao bo what is it
what the matter
oh my god
he is choking
hold still
stop making me worried
no one is stealing your biscuits
what the matter
what is it
the shadow
i measured it when i first got here
it been a while
since we came inside
the shadow should have gotten longer
no i only went out for a moment
didnt i
i checked my phone when i left
it was just past midnight
i even thought it was broken
impossible
you were gone for a lot longer
time runs slower
you said you saw an online post
announcing the store
revival for a night
yes
but when i left here
i didnt see anybody
but didnt we get the musician reply
maybe
this place is haunted
in order to answer your questions
id like to know more about you
try closing the door
one two three
this man uses a pager
watches the drama
the legend of white snake
what is smog
he doesnt know what smog is
beijing is bidding to
host the 2000 olympics
can this man be actually from the 90s
we just found out
by closing the back door
the letter in the milk
box will disappear
so i think
the back door is an on-off switch
what switch
to access the time portal
right
the portal is right here
xiao bo let write back
to encourage him
to hold on to his dreams
stop this nonsense
let say he from the 90s
he never made big-time
during all these years from around here
only zhang wei wei made
a name for herself
and she is a girl
is only outcome that matters
wouldnt it be great if
he pursued his dreams
you can sit around twiddling your thumbs
who are you to judge anyone
sure write him back
i wont stop you
but can he make a living with music
greetings namiya store
not sure if youre still in business
please excuse my impudence
my dream is to make good music
for three years
i fought hard in beijing
i stayed up all night
to write you a passionate poem
i see autumn like songbirds
perching disorderly on poplar
the red crow on your body squeals
breathing tenderly
i can see an arrogant knight
riding out from a white castle
as love reaches the emerald sea
i can see the succulent ginkgos
dangling from her shoulders
with breath as a breeze
with cherries like the eyes of pigeons
let your voice shiver more
sound more desperate
you should know
this is a weird sensation
dont look at her look at the sky
what are you drawing
how many times have you started over
where is your hometown
can you hear me
get ready
go
the flower of youth blossoms and withers
tiring me out but i have no regrets
the rain and snow of four
seasons flutter in the air
fascinating me but i pine away
the soft wind and the supple dream
are dazedly gentle
stop
look
for someone who so out of touch
you should try rock n roll
that might work better
cmon show me
sing with anger
free that rage from your heart
go
get ready
five six seven go
ive heard about but
not seen 25000 miles
yes go on
who knows if it is easy or not
move forward with head
down to find the real me
fire it up
again
walking back and forth losing myself
once more
rifles and millet are everything
canons and bombers are truths
not bad chuan
now were rocking
cui jian i love you
friends i once jammed with at bars
have released albums and headlined gigs
but i am still a nobody
what up
after rehearsing for three years
im finally ready
you must come tomorrow
we have to go now
will you come for the play
im afraid not
we have to catch a plane to usa
see you on broadway
well tour the us next
bye bye
take care
qin lang
bye bye
mr poet what are you doing
sunbathing
i love you like i love my motherland
but youve forsaken
the yangtze and yellow river
a pigeon as your parting gift
to hell with your yankee
qin lang phone call for you
hurry up you slacker
who is it
i am my family only son
dad has just been taken ill
so i came home
brother
my lang is back
you wear your hair so long
like a savage
look your son is back
why the fuss
what can happen to me
brother
you didnt bring much with you
are you not planning to stay
in fact dad will retire soon
he has arranged for me to take his job
to work in the same factory unit
but im not giving up on my dreams
boss
lang
how is your music career
ive been composing
when you have a dream
the whole world is your stage
who said that
the old man at the corner store
remember him
who
here
oh yes
he even gave an interview a while ago
is it still open
i think it closed now
we used to draw on his walls
yes were a nuisance
the old man would come and scold us
kids if you want to draw
please draw better
i dont know who else to talk to
if you happen to read this letter
i hope to get your advice
small town musician
internet celeb
live stream
dont drink
you just got better
what are your plans
after you have recovered
i will go back to beijing
dont worry about me
think about yourself
i know what im doing
when you quit school for beijing
you assured us
that youd succeed
then why are you bumming around
not me
making music is not as
simple as you think
you wont understand
of course we wont
but i can tell
you talk louder than you sing
brother
lang
sit down
everyone should have dreams
but life must go on
maybe take over your father job
it not so bad
uncle
come here
where have you been
what happened
dont you know dad has a heart problem
it can relapse anytime
brother
your health is deteriorating
shall we ask qin lang to come back
im fine
i can return to work in days
stay off qin lang
i know you love your son
but the way he living his life
can he even support himself
he cant just
bum around in beijing forever
if you feel awkward
i can talk to him
let him decide what to do with himself
when even i didnt speak up
he doesnt need your parenting
fine
fine
brother please calm down
forget what i said
you dont have to
worry about my problems
maybe it is better for me to stay home
anyone there
no one
thanks for lending an ear to my problems
and giving me replies
in fact i just wrote a song
the lyrics arent done yet
so ive never performed it
but it is the song i love most
i want to play it for
you with my harmonica
as my way of saying thanks
isnt that zhang wei wei reborn
it her big hit
she sings it well
you all know the story behind this song
maybe he should have given up
then he wont
and no future for zhang wei wei
to tell you the truth
i never wanted you to succeed me
but if your mind is made up
then so be it
im your father
can i not know what youre thinking
what wrong with me staying
big talk
save it until you reach your goal
go back to beijing
and give it everything
try your best
dont give up even if you stumble
otherwise
dont come back here
do you understand
yes
are you sure
if someday
you can choose
to relive your life or to continue
i dont know if your answer
will be your true sensation
or just a deception
i hope from blue sky to fame and fortune
everything that you want
will not vanish with the wind
they come and go
freely like dust
let me tell you
i once had problems
who is that
that madam zhang
she founded the house of rainbows
20 years ago
and she raised all the children here
that why were all zhangs
after she passed away
it became my duty to look after them
right up to this day
those who have moved on
often come back to visit
and bring money food clothes
everything
older kids will help the young
seniors will help newcomers
i performed all over the country
i dont know why
but i feel most at home in this place
right
i think the madam is
always watching over us
i bored you
anyway
thank you for performing here
we all had a good time
i should be thanking you
for letting me sing for the children
thank you
the song you sang was really good
thanks
i wrote it
do you like it
does the song have a name
reborn
reborn
it tells your own story
you can tell
isnt that obvious
what is your name
zhang wei wei
if someday
you can choose
to relive your life or to continue
i dont know if your answer
will be your true sensation
or just a deception
i hope from blue sky to fame and fortune
everything that you want
will not vanish with the wind
there a fire
children run
hurry up
go downstairs
hurry up
mr qin run hurry
help
mr zhang take my guitar
mr qin
mr qin
the relentless pursuit of your dreams
will be fully rewarded
trust me
countless people will be
comforted and inspired
by your songs in the future
persist on walking your own path
until that final moment
this last song
was not only my first hit
its composer mr qin lang
also saved my life
he gave me
a second chance to live
and also a career in music
reborn
for you
if someday
you can choose
to relive your life or to continue
i dont know if your answer
will be your true sensation
or just a deception
i hope from blue sky to fame and fortune
everything that you want
will not vanish with the wind
please tell me
dont be silent like a riddle
they come and go
freely like dust
let me tell you

to thank me

as long as you behave
ill never lay a finger on you
i have something important to tell you
you must not tell anyone
pretty soon youll start grade school
so it a good time to move south
and find you a better school
you are lying
you just wanted to move
this conversation stays between us
only pack what important to you
ive arranged everything for you and mom
you didnt say it but i know you hate me
you think im a loser
but i promise you
before long
we will prosper again like before

even giving up my life
a 3-year-old american boy
jordan chandler
has accused the famous pop star
michael jackson of sexual assault
jackson has denied the accusation
allegedly since 992
jackson has invited children to visit
his neverland ranch
this is not suitable for children
x-rated
neverland ranch is to make
up for his lost childhood
his fans from around the world
are stunned
if the boy family
decides to press charges
whether or not jackson is found guilty
hell have to undergo
lengthy investigations

to catastrophe
whenever i think of this
i feel a cold shudder down my spine
i cant write these letters anymore
it time

i dreamt of the store
as if it were right in front of me
i saw people from the future

about changes in their lives
strange
it been closed for months
it still spotless
uncle

theyre all from the future
the future
michael jackson
im such an old fool
so pathetic
i thought my advice
would bring misfortune to others
why would i have such power
dont say that
everyone now writes to thank you
i
have never helped anyone
when they came to me with a problem
they already knew the answer
but if they dont even try
nothing i write will help them
they have only themselves to thank
who would slip in a blank page
at this ungodly hour
who could that be
let me think it over
what there to think about
take this
read it in the car
also
this is for you
what that for
just take it
besides
these letters from the future
keep them safe for me
uncle why do you want to keep these
heavenly secrets cannot be divulged
okay
ill wait for you in the car
i never married
you are like a son to me
you looked after me
and i am forever grateful
please do me another favor
consider it my last wish
in the next 25 years
do not sell the store
or demolish it
do your best to maintain it
the letters i received
please keep them safe
after 25 years
before the anniversary of my death
announce for me
that the store counseling service
will be back for just
one night until midnight
whoever got advice
from me in the past
is invited to write in
and tell me if the advice they received
had any impact on their lives
also for my funeral
keep it simple
i dont want to be a nuisance
mr zhang congratulations on the show
thank you
in only five years since graduating
you have already achieved recognition
from both home and abroad
among our many budding artists
youve been very fortunate
we know
youre enormously creative
so among all your works
do you have a favorite
it should be my life
are we done
we all know
that you grew up in an orphanage
does this life experience
come through in any of the exhibits
it a common perception
that orphans must have gone through
a life of misery
but i may be an exception
my recollections
are all heart-warming
this feeling is also
reflected in my works
what about your biological parents
relatives
did they influence your works
i mean
i often sense solitude in your work
desperation
cries of anguish
are you trying to seek redemption
through your paintings
mr zhang
well talk again
thank you
mr zhang
mr zhang
congratulations
it beautiful
when you were kids
everyone was scavenging for bottles
but youd draw all day
well it makes an artist out of you
this mural must worth a fortune now
i owe my life
to the house of rainbows
this mural is priceless
whatd you like
this didnt use to be a bar right
it used to be an av shop
since there are more tourists these days
i turned it into an old-time bar
whatd you like
whisky
single malt
thank you
ive collected these
michael lived a tragic life
he was notorious when alive
at least he was cleared in death
june 28 2009
on the day of june 28th
the alleged victim admitted
he falsely accused michael for money
a die-hard fan
hang on
this is part of my collection
i have more at home
even his original imports
where did you get this

my parents were acting strange
and wanted to take me away
i was disgusted with them
i didnt want to live with them
thank you for not dismissing my drawing
as some bad joke
you gave me sincere advice
you said
when a family stays together
they can overcome anything
i believe you were right
ive had a wonderful life
and i owe it all to you
thank you
the golden voice challenge

the deadline coming up
if i enter this contest
and tell them im an orphan
would they let me skip the qualifiers
not unless you blend our hard-luck tales
into your own story
might as well crown me the champ
compared to jie
we are very lucky
whenever he drinks one too much
he talks about his hostess mother
and those hooligans who could be his dad
he was lucky to have made it out
or hed have been killed a long time ago
which song should i sing
reborn
if someday
you can choose
to relive your life or to continue
will you two ever stop
can i get some sleep around here

im telling you
do what you want with your music
just dont drag xiao bo down with you
the lost wang wang
the lost wang wang
even the name is ridiculous
dont bother reading
or replying
it wont change anything
what destined to happen will happen
to the namiya store
i work as a hostess
i heard of you by chance
i am a hostess
im nineteen
working in a night club
the place is littered with low lives
but because the pay is good
i do my best to put up with them
what do you want
getting my mail
bullshit
if you have a problem
drop the old man a line
hell leave you a reply in
the milk box the next day
tonight you should understand
destiny will not go away easy
love will not go away easily
with mr su compliment
thank you mr su for your support
here
a toast to mr su
youve been drinking all night
stop it
have a soft drink instead
however
i have an admirer lately
he different from the others
a girl
should treat herself well
thanks
pick anything you fancy
i really hope that
i can have my own shop one day
if you want this shop
you can have it
he wants me to become his lover
i know this is immoral
but he is good to me
the shoes look better
when theyre on your feet
that would be $299
it expensive
wait here your change
keep the change
keep the rest as a tip
consider this my gift to you
thank you
if you can give me some advice
id be grateful
jie
please
dont you think she lost her mind
why does she choose to be a hostess
for dirty money
is it worth it to sacrifice
your feelings
jie please
calm down first
he might not be a lowlife
right
we dont know everything right
you
xiao bo write to her
come here
write down what i say word for word
write
now youre fine with writing back
you said it wouldnt make a difference
i just want to rebuke her
cant i
i think you have misunderstood
im not doing this because of vanity
i need to take care of my family
they can barely make ends meet
i make good money being a hostess
but not all the time
the man said
he could open a shop for me
in the shopping mall he investing in
ive saved up some money
and have been waiting for
an opportunity like this
sis where are the flowers
if you water them with love
flowers will bloom
over here
i think she is shameless
maybe she is like us
unable to find a decent job
cant find a decent job
id be a pauper before a madame
xiao bo write
tell her that the man must be a crook
what if he is genuine
and helps her open a shop
then she wont need to be a hostess
then you tell her
if the man starts asking for money
he is definitely a cheat
everybody knows causeway bay is my turf
right
make sure the fund hits my
hong kong account soon
good
sure no problem
ill treat you to dim sum when i return
okay
i have so many deals to do lately
oh yes
about the shop
i have arranged everything for you
already
moreover
overhead
utilities
product sourcing
ill handle all of that
and you
just need to put up 70000
for the rent
then were all set
err
you need 70000
70000 is not a lot
dont you know
of all the shops in the mall
this one has the best location
in order to secure this shop
ive already
spent hundreds of thousands
remember
no matter how nicely he puts it
once he asks you for money
he is a con artist
go out and ask around
is the shop for real
where the shop that was here before
it went bust
i took over a few days ago
if your heart is tired
tears have run dry
this profound love
is hard to forget or end
but i dont see you anymore
sit down
are you zhang long
who
my surname is su
not zhang
i ask you one more time
are you zhang long
mind your attitude
i am a hong kong citizen
scum
you cant fool me
dont move
big brother
what going on
what your name
let be civil and talk
hold still
where are you taking us
we did nothing
why are you here to stir up my heartbeat
how can i stop loving you
why are you so indifferent
according to the notice
the store revives from
midnight till dawn
if i am not mistaken
the portal will close at daybreak
you were right about him
he was in fact a con man
but i now feel even more lost
other than being a hostess
i really dont know
how else i can support my family
she believed in us
we helped her
we helped her
why arent you happy
what for
now she even more lost
well
what more can we do
how would i know
which year is it over there
grab a pen and some paper
hurry
in fact like you
lowlives like him exist in all ages
dont feel bad about it
in fact like you
i am totally lost
but i want to tell you
no matter what
dont even think of
relying on anyone else
you have to rely on yourself
i cant tell you
how to become financially independent
but being a hostess is not the way out
maybe it hard for you to imagine
in the future people will
stop writing letters like this
the proliferation of
computers and the internet
will shrink our world
the advent of social networks
will make communication much easier
we dont even need to use cash
a cell phone
can handle all of our daily needs
in 20 years china
economy will flourish
stocks real estate it
internet e-commerce
these industries will
develop at light speed
if you study hard now
save up and invest
be a first mover
the better your chances of success are
i have no idea
what happened to her since
you tried your best
let it be
weve received letters from the past
but the notice invites
people from 207 to write in
if
what
if we drop a letter from the front
will it travel back 20 years
do we still have time
stop debating
well know after we tried
quick
get a blank page
blank sheet
hurry up
hurry up
it went through
i really want to know what 993 was like
and what these people looked like
it morning now
the portal is closed
no more letters
so
let go
where to
where did it go
what is this
look
namiya store
greetings
i am the lost wang wang
who wrote you in the winter of 993
your advice changed my life
fixed assets
young lady
tell me
what your major
do you have a major
dont you have a major
what do you study
accounting
yes your major is accounting
my major is accounting
study save up and invest
i did not forget any of them
i did loads of research
invested wisely in technology stocks
and accumulated some cash
i kept pace with the national policy
i soon bought my first property
then my second and third
just as id wished
i bought my late foster
parents house too
in the future that you described
i seem to have made all the right moves
in time
i left my hometown
and set up my own company
i am still learning
to turn risks into opportunities
from a simple food court
to the latest housing developments
ive yet to lose a battle
those awesome prophecies that you made
are all coming true
now i think of it
life is truly a miracle
come in
president
what is it
weve been invited
by binhai north district
to bid for an urban renewal project
binhai
your hometown
please take a look
this is the tender document
also
this is our research
please review it
i dont know if you remember
the reason i wanted money
was to support my big family
when i heard that the house of rainbow
was zoned for urban renewal
i decided to go for it
ill do my utmost to secure this project
i want to tear it down and rebuild it
mr chen
prepare our offer at once
we must win this bid
ms zhang
since you grew up in
the house of rainbows
what do you plan to do with it
ms zhang
how do you do
brother yi
xiao mei
long time no see
welcome
let me introduce
madam zhang niece
im zhang qing mei
nice to meet you
thanks for taking this place over
youre welcome
i lived here
when my foster parents passed away
the house of rainbows is always my home
dont worry
i will take good care of the children
im grateful
madam zhang left these behind
that a young madam zhang
so pretty
he handsome too
who was he
i heard from elder relatives
when my aunt was young
she fell in love with this man
the family was against it
they even planned to elope
but my aunt family locked her in
theyve lost contact since
no wonder madam zhang never got married
what a pity
so what has happened to this man
my grandpa said hed met him once
he was a gentleman
hed written once to my aunt
could this be that letter
in his letter
he asked my aunt to move on without him
after receiving this letter
my aunt decided never to marry
she bought this place
and spent the rest of her life here
the man has moved away
no one heard from him since
they havent seen each other again
no name
during the transition
i accidentally stumbled across
the story of you and madam zhang
be careful
madam zhang founded
the house of rainbows
i became what i am today
because of your advice back then
and i can now repay
the house of rainbows
i feel that you are
both watching over us
so i can grow up in a loving environment
with all my brothers and sisters
madam zhang devoted her life
in providing shelter for
dozens of children
and you
you showed me how to be benevolent
when i can think only of myself
and neglecting the feelings of others
thank you for giving me advice
the fact that i have not repaid you
is my greatest regret
from now on
i endeavor to help more people
from up above
i hope you can feel my aspirations
the lost wang wang
is in fact zhang qing mei
she not closing down
the house of rainbows
we were wrong about her
xiao bo
what wrong xiao bo
say something
brother xiao bo
xiao bo
xiao bo
uncle yi asked us to
bring xiao bo with us
but he wouldnt come out
xiao bo
he hasnt eaten all day
kids you go down first
kids you go down first
watch your step
watch out for the steps
xiao bo
xiao bo
xiao bo are you okay
everyone has left
let go okay
pull yourself together
what do you want
my biological parents abandoned me
my foster parents didnt want me
now even the house of rainbows
is going to be
demolished by zhang qing mei
dont they want to tear it down
they can bury me in the rubble
i can help them tear it down
watch me
xiao bo
damn it
xiao bo
xiao bo
i order you to calm down
are you crazy
tell us what you want
were with you all the way okay
if she wants to demolish rainbows
fine
we will trash her house
hold still
dont move hear me
youve got nerves
youve got nerves
it sad the letter never
reached the old man
the letter was intended for us
there seems to be an invisible force
linking rainbows to this store
let go
ive decided
ill go and sign up
are you confident
how about xiao bo
i want to go to qing mei house
if possible
i hope to have her forgiveness
and you
me
let go find qing mei first
to blank page
to blank page
i am getting old
i thought long and hard
before i realized why you sent me this
maybe im becoming senile
my guess is that you
didnt know what to ask
for those who sought my advice
they usually had specific questions
or should i say
they already come with their own maps
but in most cases
they had no idea where they were
but you sent only a blank page
this shows you didnt have a map
this is indeed disturbing
but what i want to share with you is
after counseling so many people
i discovered that
one must still work hard
in order to attain a better life
the advice i gave in my letters
only meant to reinforce
an already determined heart
the good thing about a blank page
is you can freely draw your own
that is to say
your future is your own
now go and draw your own map
i sincerely hope you
have faith in yourself
create without fear and
sparkle
this is the last reply i write
thank you
