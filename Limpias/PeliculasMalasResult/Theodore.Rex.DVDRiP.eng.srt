hi mr kane
im sorry to barge in sir
but id like you to meet
my partner
detective katie coltrane
nice to meet you
nice tomeet you
we have something wonderful
to show you
guppies
ice fish
theyre remarkable creatures
they live in our polar oceans
in water so cold
no other organism can survive
they possess an enzyme which
ive isolated and reproduced
because of it
ice fish can be trapped
and frozen in ice for years
brought back to life again
after injecting a serum
from the ice fish
into a subject blood
they can be frozen and
reanimated whenever you like
that just peachy but we are
not here for a social call
-i liked the fish
-come on
no need to take an attitude
ill try to remember that
were here because
someone gave oliver rex
and a clone named adam
a new cosmic address
is there--is there something
we can do to help
well according to his roommate
oliver worked here
and the dead clone
was registered to you
adam worked in species data
with oliver
-species data
-i collect endangered species
we try to rescue
the last specimen when we can
and keep them here
at my compound
thank you for letting us know
youre so very welcome but
i do have one more thing to ask
isnt it a little strange
to you
that both these guys were made
extinct on the same night
and they both
just happened to work for you
it strikes me as tragic
im sorry officers
im sorry i cant be
of more help to you
-thank you
-thank you for your time
thank you good-bye
good-bye and i really
enjoyed seeing the fishes
-let go
-excuse me coming
goal
brothers and sisters
we are gathered here this day
to recycle oliver rex
who from the beginning
to the end
was our friend
listen where the body
he was liquefied
what do you mean he was
liquefied--like a smoothie
you see those tubes over there
his essence
fertilizes the flowers
so that each guest
can take some home
farewell sweet ollie
