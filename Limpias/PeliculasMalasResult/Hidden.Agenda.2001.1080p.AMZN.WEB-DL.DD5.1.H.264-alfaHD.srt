the dc home

hey we get 5
ok were goin deep
on this one
deep shit
were not even

where they
end up anyway
that nsa
policy right
but we do
they dont know that
true but this time
we wont
and neither will they
i dont get it
it icarus
and the cleaner
were dealing with
so im making sure
elkert goes beyond
the vanishing point
how
well get to that
connie
get your
com lines open
to these providers
secure lines only
on it
kevin transportationyeah
minimum 5000 access points
and reservations
all modes everything
cancelable in 30 days
shit tall order
yep
that
why charlie
crunching
route permutations
on daedalus
patch me through
can we get started
please
all right well be using
a mersenne prime algorithm
that makes shadow tracking
that much more difficult
elkert will get
a handheld unit
with an encrypted
flash-memory card
hell have more than
50 links along the way
well need
all our resources
call on the least-used providers
in the nsa system
providers who wont even know
what it all about
but are looking
for a trigger code
a break in the chain
an infiltrator that needs
to be disposed of
if there is a match
he gives up a new envelope
hell get
birth certificates
passports subscriptions
then on to the next link
ive run
the provider list
but there are 2
noted as unknown
that our ace
in the hole
something ive been saving
for a rainy day
static drops
providers who
cant give up information
even if they wanted to
if you remove
the human element
there can be no betrayal
he must enter
the correct code here
or he dies
if he gets through
without mistakes
his trail will forever
be erased
hell be a ghost
i ought to install
a revolving door
you boys
got reservations
shut up
i told you id be back
to see you real soon
now we can do this
the easy way
or we can do this
the hard way
this pillow talk sam
if you think
youre gonna try
relax
im not gonna interfere
but i got an interest
really what that
let just say price
tricked us too
elkert so deep
we cant even
track him
now i wanna
talk to him
yeah well
i want the skinny
on price and his people
hey buddy
sonny
i tried to warn you
man
yeah and now
youre here to offer
me a friendly deal
nah nothin like that
though you did
put a whole new twist
on this icarus affair
elkert still alive
i might not be
though
jason price
fbi academy 8
top of his class
youngest special
protection agent
in division history
8 commendations
including
a presidential citation
but was suspended twice
for insubordination
what do i look like
an idiot
i know all this shit
gimme the post-bureau stuff
icarus knows
i was a plant
the cleaner been
contracted to whack me
jesus sonny
do i have stupid
written on my forehead
look wiretap
on yoesky phone
conversation took
place this morning
with the cleaner
find him and while
youre at it
there another haircut
i want you to schedule
the cleaner filtered
we already discussed
that
his type is usually
not a mark
ill double
the fee just do it
we picked him up right after
the second suspension
put his skills to use
in east germany
with nsa funding
he devised
the most sophisticated
protection system
in the world
called daedalus
it was used for
hiding western agents
who had been exposed
never lost a runner
but when the wall
came down
the usefulness
of the program
came into question
so price made a deal with
the nsa and went private
son of a bitch
what about
his people
that information
is beyond even
my clearance
i dont know what the hell
you want me to do
yes you do
youre fbi sonny
im not touching this
you would give
a scumbag like elkert
a fighting chance
you wont even help
your best friend
how could you put me
in this position
because i dont have
a fucking choice
you know how screwed up
the fbi is
i mean hell
your own kid charlie
just hacked the system
last month
and he e-mailed
the director a list
of protected witnesses
just to piss him off
the fucking system
is a joke
please i got
nowhere else to turn
so you know where all
the guys are he stashed
you wanna find elkert
or dont you
rival agencies
sharing
a private moment
how touching
what happened
to elkert price
what happened
to i dont ask
you dont ask frank
that only
works one way
well then it my way
you have a good thing
going here price
i wouldnt spoil it
you have
a lot more to lose
fuck you
i designed daedalus
so if you wanna
play hardball
remember this
the only losers
will be the marks
i ran under for you
is that a threat
no
i just think that
on a need-to-know
basis
there some pretty
important people
whod rather
not be known
he free to go
what
we had a deal
we had an understanding
i changed my mind
agency prerogative
this is fuckin
blackmail
im goin
to the director
all right

id watch my next few steps
very carefully
we will be
do what i told you
yeah
utilities on
bank accounts open

well that just it
nothing could have

if i find out you lied
ill be back
and it aint
gonna be for tv
unh
yeah jason it me
go ahead charlie
there some
good news and
there some bad news
first the good
daedalus
extrapolation couldnt
pinpoint a hole
the codes received
were all in order
no penetration
charlie he knew
sonny was going there
but dont tell me
he couldnt have
cracked the system
anything is possible
sonny wasnt supposed
to be in virginia
the code should
have directed him
to south dakota
where hed link and
wait wait
south dakota
yeah kevin checking
all the transpo routes
but so far
there no redirect
in the database
for arlington
that doesnt make sense
unless
unless what
sonny
he figured it out
ill check
the back door
be careful
let go of me
who the hell are you
if youd get off of me
id tell you you jerk
i thought you were
with the fbi or icarus
dont sweet-talk me
what your name
renee brooks
i was one
of paul elkert
associates at icarus
the cleaner
tried to kill me
at the courthouse
but i got the hell out
howd you manage that
i was in the bathroom
i heard gunshots
so i climbed
through the window
as fast as i could
still doesnt explain
what youre doin here
are you always
this sympathetic
no wonder
you and elkert
got along so well
howd you know
about me and elkert
he told me he was
coming to see you
and that
i should too
because i got this
what is it
it a key to
a safety-deposit box
in the caribbean
worth $00 million
do you expect
me to believe
that elkert would
hand you a key
to money he stole
he trusted me
i took care of his
finances at icarus
besides the bank
requires 2 keys
why would
he hand one to you
he didnt have a choice
he keeps one with him
the other one was
in his safe at icarus
when the fbi raid
went down
i grabbed
what was inside
and now youre
gonna get it to him
no doubt for a price
0% is my standard
safekeeping fee
when did you
last talk to him
the day of the hit
i was supposed
to come to you
after he was
safely hidden
but you
werent around
and why should
i lead you to elkert
for the money
he owes you
what if i dont
hell contact
me anyway
ill just
have to wait
you dont really buy
that phony story
of course not
but there a link
to elkert there
we need to keep
her close
in case he does
contact her
i dont see why
the cleaner
is inside going after
our biggest fish
and that means the fbi
has a shot at him
it also means all
our people are exposed
i need to put
a stop to this
before someone else
gets hurt
so
i havent decided yet
where your car
got a rental
she your girlfriend
what it to you
just wondering why
she doesnt like me
like got nothin
to do with it
it trust she thin on
i think it you
who lacking
maybe but i want
the truth
and i dont think
im getting it
you ok
that truthful enough
for you
tell me more about elkert
what you did for him
i set up shell companies
that billed icarus
for services in
out-of-the-way places
like africa
and the middle east
trouble spots
places no one would
go check
it worked
for a long time
then he got reckless
kept wanting more
taking bigger risks
greed
control
he was consolidating
power and assets
to challenge yoesky
what happened
sonny
he was playing
both sides
against each other
setting icarus up
for the fbi
when did elkert find out
not until it was
too late
sonny lured elkert
with a billion-dollar
weapons buy
involving 4 countries
the feds were waiting
elkert was floored
he trusted sonny
like his own
he made everyone
look bad
so that why yoesky
put the hit out
and the cleaner
what do you mean
you were on the inside
you must have heard stories
just a killer
expensive never misses
no one knows who it is
that a stock answer
i was hoping for an idea
of who im dealing with
i couldnt tell you
who it is
but ill tell you this
i think the cleaner
looking for a way out
what makes you say that
because it
what happens
when you work
for the mob
you do things you
dont really want to do
just so you can believe
youre actually getting
somewhere
when in fact
youre only biding time
until you can no longer
do what they ask
and then
youre eliminated
kind of sounds
like an excuse
maybe but it happens
to everyone
elkert sonny me
itll happen
to the cleaner
do you um
have a rest room
through there
thank you
hello
kev listen
i need you to call charlie
on the secure line
i want the two of you
to gather all statistical data
on sonny run
specifically
route corridors phone calls
bank charges
credit card bills
whatever
im looking
for anything abnormal
thatll confirm my suspicion
which is
if the cleaner
was on the inside
how come he was
a step behind sonny
he isnt he got him
not where he was
supposed to be
that what not right
about this
something fishy
ok im on it
shh
what is it
there someone outside
go upgo upstairs go
fbi everybody freeze
price we know
youre in there
we know she with you
price we got a warrant
exit plan
somebody break a window
theyre gone
i think were safe
you dont really
need protection do you
that was some job
you did on that agent
whered you learn
to fight like that
when you work for icarus
youd better be ready
come in
theyre gonna start
coming down hard now
did kevin talk
to charlie
they ran the matrix
there something
what
he said you should
see it for yourself
do you mind if
i leave her with you
no way
no way
now listen both of you
in case you
havent noticed
we got a big problem
here
i need to go
and see charlie
and i cant take
either of you
so can we be adults
for 2 seconds here
thank you
just take her
to the safe house
and wait for me there
so whatd you
want me to see
while cross-checking
through some
975 million calls
made during sonny run
we came up
with a remarkable
coincidence
the provider at every
one of sonny stops
received a call within
an hour of his arrival
well how could that be
it cant i mean
one of the providers
is fisherman
in bar harbor
who hadnt had a call
on the secure line
for the last 2 years
and that was
a wrong number
all right
guess we gotta
bring elkert in
i thought there was
no way to trace him
think i tell you everything
well this is
um interesting
it safe
that all that matters
so how long
you and price
known each other
long enough
for what
to know when he not
thinking clearly
you always
warm up to everyone
this quickly connie
it takes a lot more than
the damsel-in-distress routine
to sell me
well lucky for me
it him who buying
ill take
the bedroom
thank you
good night
reverse the factor
by the 29th marsenne prime
match your beta code
sending these codes
could expose
the providers
and their locations
you sure you want
to do this
we got no choice
continue
well
i wonder if
the runners ever knew
they were leaving
a dna trail behind
by rubbing off
those gold patches
doesnt matter now
yeah
so you found the remote
that bombed her car
in her purse
man that is fucked up
hey
sorry
well it sounds to me
she after all the money
yeah
well then why
keep her around
well i need her
at arm length
and there
another possibility
what that
she not who
she says she is
think we hit a static drop
let me do it
the static drop coordinates
a back door
next card
not coming up
he didnt use it
he jumped track on his own
that what he planned
all along
yeah well then
he could be anywhere
back up
to the previous provider
what did he give elkert
plane tickets
ok match that provider
with all tickets
ever issued to him
2 hits
phoenix and boston
ids
no
but there are 2 high
probability addresses
for those areas
but i cant tell
if theyre providers
or final covers
ok call kevin tell him
ill pick him up in an hour
ok
well at least you two
didnt strangle each other
spare the chitchat
did you find him
no but therere
2 possibilities
in other words
he lost
he broke protocol
jumped track
but there
still a chance
if we move
what do we do
we split up
kevin already
arranged flights
you and him
hit phoenix
well go to boston
we
come on let go
how well did you
know sonny
not real well
and only for about 2 months
i was the last one
brought into the circle
by elkert
and he trusted you
it why he trusted me
i had no allegiance
to anyone else
howd sonny manage
to fit in
it wasnt so hard
he had more mob in him
than a lot of made men
sonny no way
he may have been fbi
but he loved
the high-flying lifestyle
the syndicate afforded him
houses boats
personal well-hidden assets
in countries the government
cant touch
nonsense
i set it up for him
ok i dont want
to hear anymore
how long did you know sonny
since we were kids
we were orphans
in social services
together
grew up
in the same streets
same foster homes
eventually joined
the fbi together
so if you happen
to run into the cleaner
during all this
what will you do
ill ask him
to walk away
leave my runners
alone
and if he doesnt
ill kill him
or her
come on
what
why
were being followedby who
someone who
doesnt really know
what a bottle of ripple
can do to you
are you ok
yeah fine
price
gimme your hand
come on
come on
big baby
thanks

he knew about some perks
i took from icarus
he told me hed nail me
if i didnt do it
do what
penetrate your system
why
if you were convinced
that the cleaner
whacked me
youd think the cleaner
was inside
and getting close
youd have no choice
but to go back
to elkert save him
and then i would
fuckin follow you
and i would deliver him
to turgenson
you killed those providers
no i didnt do that
that was turgenson
he killed em
after each pickup
i had no idea i swear
i knew something stank
about your death

room 56
whend she leave
about an hour ago
she make any calls
seattle
you have reached the mailbox
of renee brooks
please leave a message
after the tone
so what was it
it how elkert
or somebody contacted her
who
all right where do we
go from here
you go with me
im gonna have
a little talk with elkert
after all
that gone down
why are you dragging
sonny along
he my prime suspect
the way to find
elkert is through
a safety-deposit box
it has to be registered
in his name at a bank
jeez we dont
even know which one
im not exactly
a specialist
in bank systems
well
i know someone who is
time to recall
another runner kid
and that
where we are
i need to put
your knowledge of
bank systems to use
what are we looking for
a
safe-deposit box
and its owner
paul elkert
what bank
that we dont know
caribbean somewhere
shit
that many
cayman islands alone
have 034
0000 banks
that 0 million accounts
all with passwords
renee
hid assets with you
in the caribbean
so
ill bet she used
the same bank
for elkert
for control
what was it
aruba
banco financiero di aruba
it a hit
but no personal info
just an e-mail
can we use it
isp out of canada
could use the ac program
i once wrote
e-mail the account
and attach trojan virus
hack their billing database
but it might
easily get traced
you might
not be the only one
nsa fbi you name it
anyone might
get this info
dont worry
anything happens
ill take care
of you
something
on your mind
just wondering
what gonna happen
my guess would be
someone gonna die
all right
what do we do
we go in
what kind of fuckin
plan is that
it the only one
i got
let go
fuck
get down
ok ill take
the back
look
for a way in
dont betray me
again sonny
elkert it price
what do you want
im here to help you
your life in danger
you never should
have come here
stop shooting
it me renee
renee what are
you doing here
she gonna
kill you elkert
shut up sonny
god damn it
who else you got here
how about the cleaner

im so sorry
sonny
unh
elkert
stay away from me
price
take it easy
im here to help you
bullshit
you led them all
straight to me
you called renee
why the fuck
would i call that bitch
she had
your second key
i dont need a second key
that safety-deposit box
is in my name
you only need a second key
if youre not me
hold on
the cleaner been
after this key for
cleaner doesnt exist
price
you said
i just mentioned him
so youd help me
yoesky invented the cleaner
to scare people
shitless that all
well how about
the courthouse hit
sonny set that up
for me
i made sonny
a rich man
he owed me big-time
yeah sonny
think about it price
who else
but a government agency
would know the exact time
location and the layout
of a secret grand jury hearing
stop shooting
i can get you out
im the last chance
you got
i dont need
your help price
fuck you
if youre gonna
get any of my money
you
but i trusted you
you expect me
to believe
she shot elkert
to save you
that right
horseshit
im gonna tear
your story apart
like you did
to my providers
you murderer
i dont know
what the hell
youre talking about
they were innocent
nobody innocent
price
drop it
turgenson drop it
place him under arrest
cant arrest me
im fbi
youre wanted
on 5 counts of murder
in the first degree
get him outta here
i warned you
this case could go bad
why did the nsa
want elkert dead
you picked up on that
not so hard considering
your panicked reaction
when i ran him under
elkert was too hot
we have certain
jurisdictional rights
but we couldnt
seize him from the fbi
without raising
a red flag
so you had him come to me
we thought
wed track him
quietly but
we werent expecting
your static drops
very clever
so you were working
with icarus all along
the mega arms deal
sonny got involved with
only the nsa
had the interest
and resources
to set that up
so you were
using the syndicate
to illegally divert weapons
to some dirty little war
somewhere right
that what
elkert had on you
that what
you didnt want
the fbi to know
you dont
have to worry
about that now
icarus
has pulled out
your actions
have torpedoed
important
national operations
and objectives
bullshit
was she your cleaner
does it matter
no
i guess this is one time
when there no
need-to-know on my part
well you
take care of yourself
price
thank you
and ive arranged
with the nsa
for a 5-million wire transfer
to each of your accounts
whoa
powell agreed to that
if i shut daedalus down
forever
i did explain
the potential downside
of having
a motley crew like
you guys running it
thanks
look after yourself
will ya
hey
hey
who gonna
mother me now
ill send you
monthly e-mails
yeah yeah
so what do we do
to get you under
nothing
this one
my own doing
the ultimate
vanishing act
yeah
ill miss you guys
how can you just
disappear on us
like this
it the only way
i can leave it
all behind connie
i guess things never did
settle right for us
everything ok
you
fine
free as a bird
so where are we
going
if i told you
we wouldnt be safe
