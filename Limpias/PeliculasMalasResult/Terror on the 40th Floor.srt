interesting man

other ginger cant we come on were both

i can ask a little favor in there you do
it for me sure if i could now look this
may sound crazy but you were the only
one in this whole company that i can ask
i am yeah
youre in charge of the personnel
records roger i think that the
confidential phone wireless what did you
make sure where he doesnt look at those
files just one quick look little files
are locked sure im not supposed to let
anybody look at them my job ginger i
think you wont sit down the state i
need that motion
charlie charlie
charlie
we have a major crime progress on the
200 lift hours building give me a third
law assignment three additional truck
companies and all available air bottles
i didnt want you have rescue problem
negative we had one fatality one man
injured the injured man has been
identified as a security guard he said
there nobody else in the building
tell us the problems his men are having
with this fire chief maca can you tell
us please what going on kula for one
thing the fire started 26 feet above
ground level and we dont have aerial
equipment i enough to reach that far
so everything were fighting this fire
with has to be carried up on our backs i
see there a surprising lack of flames
visible from the outside why is that
well that because a tall building like
this is like a giant incinerator the
heat and smoke and flames go straight up
nobody literally becomes a chimney and
any inside opening like an elevator
shaft or a stairwell or air-conditioning
ducts just sucks the smoke they hate the
flames straight up and pushes of outward
we cant get above it so we have to
fight it from below so to chase it from
florida floor where the fire has already
climbed seventh floor so far now is
there a possibility would go all the way
to the top yeah there always that
possibility but were certainly going to
do everything we can to keep that from
happening
well what steps here would you be excuse
me more vino anyone no no im gonna just
stay with it just happened have another
bottle all night yeah i would say i had
the last epistle i read anywhere i said
that there about 50 00 some odd percent
women really like him dont you
fantastic he rotten
it fantastic yeah he makes a pretty
good presentation i mean you and him
nope
well almost but that was another office
party anyway dont let her worry i mean
kelly really not my type
besides that was almost two years ago
your overland catches her he busy she
would know were gone
come on ginge was just down the hole
please refill yeah help yourself we got
our own bottle
our
here we go
youre crazy about lamb chops well done
medium and you buy your clothes at
boardman suppressives youve done quite
a bit of research little not exactly hot
office gossip but interesting what about
the negative side you mean like a wife i
do have one
every successful executive shoot
boys we have a lot of trouble hole in
this thing the fires extended at the
utility shaft in the 7th floor to get
those hoses up in a hurry italian
seventh italian one im sending three
additional companies the air
conditioning is shoving heat the smoke
into the upper floors im gonna shut off
the power
we need those elevators chief the guys
will drag it from blowing stuff up a
stairwell i dont those flames carry any
higher right then let me cut the power
on the fire thatll shut off the air
conditioners and well still have part
of the rest of the building all right
try but those flames company higher up
the power to everything come on thank
you
well i find that i can work better with
this probably going to call some
gorgeous number yes it nicely bound i
collected it might be too obvious where
my damn course is so expensive are they
youre worried about our boss over there
i think he pretty well occupied
yes expensive
have you ever seen the boardroom no we
have some very rare volumes in there
must be where all the big decisions are
made
i didnt wanted to do that for a long
time im going to be like relax she
liked me
should i apologize all these important
movie gentlemen ask members of the board
of directors i dont see you picture im
not dead yet
it wont be that easy that a sure i
even wanted it to be
we gotta look why dont you kids give us
a break and you play game by yourself
okay
hey went to go ride your bike okay dont
have a ring oh i think im getting too
old for this
i probably are over the hill as a matter
of fact you definitely order to help
visit my friend in case youre
interested ladies over 35 are over there
i know how you enjoy your sundays with a
kid that means pushing in baby are you
kidding
these kids are crazy about you i know i
just thought that it would be easier to
talk relax come here
i am i had it all figured out the way i
was going to tell you i had one all
figured out your mind pregnant what you
can call me stupid or dumb or whatever
it just a tire stay on the pill when i
should have are you sure youre pregnant
sure that great that is just great
what do we do now discuss it i mean i
can think of a couple a couple of
possibilities right off like what well
um abortion isnt a lot easier now we
could just
get married he didnt have the baby
about kat damn paul what about them
theyre part of you arent they i mean
well it is kind of a package deal
sure i just tell him their daddy made a
slight bedroom mistake and had to get
married that what it is jim
a mistake i got to think about it
so like insanely
i qualified find them questionable
choice for this position but like a 2
years with this company is your foster
does he know what i can do
it trying to wipe me out twelve years
like that what the letter back and let
get out of here rita what you having
ginger i dont want them to see him go
back around the other way dont meet in
the office put it back you gonna leave

need anything mr foster im sorry
ginger i did just what was a surprise
that heard what he said about me in his
letter what did he say about you halle
you want to wear a bell around your neck

anything it getting late i better go
home i promised my girls heads late good
night good night
what your secret man ive been working
on it for two months have you just too
subtle it not my business but took a
big chance i did yeah i think if
overland finds you poking around in the
confidential files hed probably fire
you right on the spot probably yeah but
dad i wouldnt worry about kelly he
wont find out unless somebody tells him
well she not telling exactly why
should you
we cant hold this thing here it
extending to the air-conditioning
dont let this thing get around back of
us well never get up
he broken through the 9th chief the
air conditions must have tripped on the
convoy that shut it off give me five
more minutes were bringing up 40
ejectives on the elevator right now ive
got a really crew kimono i gotta shut
the building down and get your light
generators up to the fire floor one all
right okay instead of italian one jeff
go ahead nicky get a crew down to the
basement right away she chopped off a
whole part of the building everything
it probably quick on fire something in
the basement nothing to worry about gigi
mom you could i forget me darlene would
you get my briefcase that that brown
one on the desk in there you think i
should go fireball that a good idea
but maybe we ought to find out what it
is for it

after eight on christmas hating i dont
know everything gonna be all right
ginger
sorry it smokey yeah yeah try not to
breathe too much of this stuff well my
clothes are gonna pick up this too
that a real tragedy elevators on his
way up we should be out in the fresh air
in a couple minutes this is one way to
break up a party those are the emergency
lights yeah there that
well cant you break it down or
something solid steel hong kong fix that
dead fly those lines over there
well try the phones across the hall

least well be away from the smoke until
we decide what to do but are we going
were gonna be safe this is a solid
build ginger not barn all right you
stick with me were gonna
we dont pitch this thing out here it
going to run sweat off the windows and
it a long way down
give me some more line
even though we can hardly see any
visible evidence of a fire from our
vantage point here on the street fire
department tells us there are now at
least seven floors involved and they
still have not been able to bring it
under control i remember now
they sealed off these windows when i put
in the air conditioning well cant you
break one theyre reinforced with wire
good what to do anyway i mean but 40
stories high well we could yell with
somebody down the street dont be stupid
betty they couldnt hear us from up here
they could even see us at night might be
why is it going easy on that stuff
howard that a management directive or
just a personal opinion nothing like a
little get-together with the home office
once a year dan
we understand this is only about 30
minutes after the last group of people
left the building where they had been
having an office party on the top floor
it cant be thankful that these lucky
people are home now safe with their
families what a blessing this fire

and remember that we still had some host
backs in the disabled elevator so we had
their horse adorable it happened
sometime after we kept our guard told us
it was nobody else in the building
come on the discovery of a body in the
elevator shaft adds yet another grim
complication to this christmas eve
tragic read the victim has tentatively
been identified as an employee of the
hendrik industries which we understand
occupies the top five floors in the
whitney talents the fire department now
faces the possibility that there may be
other people still trapped inside the
building
he didnt know ago my fault he dead
dead come on kelly
yeah guilty your tally remaining name
though what difference does it make now
a fire department helicopter is just
landing to pick up a paramedic rescue
team chief packer is ordered an
emergency search in the building from
the roof down to the fire
as you can see the rescue team is
loading equipment aboard the helicopter
they should be taking off momentarily
in here in here
were moving in this west room okay okay
be careful
hey it sweeping around life
by the guy
his whole burn through that all she
wrote
thank you big enough we need to put a
half
4 wall is collapsed on 36 to
backtrack then you get them out we dont
have to water them
too much fire all right stick with it do
what you can ill get help up right away
johnson this is one johnson this is one
can you read me johnson send a rescue
squad up to 36 used the south stairwell
weve got a collapsed wall with men
buried under it
take some pike poles in a k-2 up there
right away hurry tech for paramedics
where are you this is one paramedics

were on 33 north of the main utility
shaft get up to 36 right away report to
captain jones weve got two men buried
up there ill send up air bottles hurry
i cant you do something but it wont
change anything
why did you do it though did you bring
that out i thought somehow it might
please you well how nice i thought for
some obscure reason that hanging benji
started with care might make things a
little happier around here dont you
remember how he always used to go to the
stocking first alright oh i could see
this is gonna be a wonderful christmas
alright let talk about it again
never mind i said let go me dad no
what about last month a picture of benji
at that summer camp and before that a
relaxing evening with a stamp collection
now it got to stop
benji seems to be the only thing we have
in common these days in fact i think he
probably was the only thing we ever had
that kept us together and we made a
mistake obviously since we cant even
talk about our own son anymore benji is
dead summer he been dead for six
months im sorry
im sorry
im sorry
and your car
pharr is now completely out of control
an attempt to stop it on the 36th floor
has failed
costing the life of one fireman and
critically injuring several others if
the rumor is true if there are still
people on the upper floors there is grim
doubt that they could survive the
intense heat and smoke the fire
department is still struggling
desperately to stop the upper floors
from being engulfed by flame but there
doesnt seem to be much chance that they
can do it
here foolish line
my air
right here
their rescue this is one after the truck
get back in the air do a 360 around the
building use your spotlight check the
window see if there any sign of people
in the building
we cant hold it here careful careful
but stay together tell you one kitchen
45 weve lost the 38th floor were
backing out into the ceiling and going
up the vent
search team this is one can you read me
were going down a stairwell from the
rope and there a lot of smoke up here
stay on monitor rescue they may need you
fast
kenny arent you he out there is near
youre not sure
they know were here they know me yeah
paraone the search date got some people
on the top floor looks like at least
three one band two women
were at the top level breaking through
hair rescue hope physician with that
light dont lose those people
right
breathe deeply now were gonna walk up
to the roof can you look makes it happen
alright stay close
there are you out of here just hold on
