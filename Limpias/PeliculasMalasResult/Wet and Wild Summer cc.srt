didnt have a chance
but i was wrong about you bobby
thanks
well weve only got one problem now

me im nowhere near
as good as you guys
youre just as good
as rusty was better
bobby thanks
charlene okay mullets
that getting better
through through
come on through
julie there something
i have to tell you
that it okay you two
swim training begins now
two laps fro the skinnies to the cliffs
go
go
whistling
i dont think so donna
aw come on baby
it good for you
no thank you
honey honey the
doctor said you should
i hate quack doctors
honey what are you doing
packing
oh where are we going
were not going anywhere im going
you
where
australia
ive never seen him
act like this before
well maybe we can
use it to our advantage
how
ill call a general meeting
well say he flipped out
gone bananas
so
you get a letter from the doctor
who gave you the pills
giggling
that it
big mike mccain has
finally lost his marbles
his son off womanizing in australia
so it up to his senior vice president
richard gray
and mrs mccain
oh and mrs mccain
to take over the running of the company
the board will buy it
what about mullet beach
ill tell eastman to turn up the heat
whether bobby likes it or not
donna
oh richard
i think weve done it
richard i think this
calls for a celebration
oh ill second that
you know ive got this feeling
this is gonna be a
highly productive merger
oh richard richard
laughing
so that about the size of it
our founder and managing director is
sadly unable to function
competently in his position
crying
therefore with the blessing of
mr mccain wife
and power of attorney
it is my melancholy duty
to assume control of mccain world resorts
now mrs mccain and i
feel it would be the best
thing the only thing
to carry out big mike plans as if he
were still here with us
chatting in agreement
now youve all seen the
computer projection
oh that coastline is
some of the prettiest
on earth and the easiest to develop
flat land not much forestation
and it a steal as long as
we make the decision today
those hillbilly aussies wont know it
until it too late
carried unanimously good
big mike would be proud of you
bob one thing worries me
richard and what that bob
our people in australia that soft cock
eastman and his son can they handle this
probably not but
dont you worry about it
we have somebody down there as well

but do you have a job
no
no
does anybody else here not have a job

big mike has told the people of
mullet beach that hell give them back
all their land if they
go into partnership
with mccain
youre kidding
he wants to build some
kind of resort commune
