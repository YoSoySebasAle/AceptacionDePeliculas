it has to come from him
the more we force things
the more he gonna pull back

i just feel like
im letting you and jude down
youre not letting anyone down
please dont be sorry
youll feel better after some sleep
yeah
good night
all right
i understand that some of jude
recent behaviors would be upsetting
but the doll clearly is providing him
with a safe outlet
lo process his trauma
now comes the hard part
where he might try fo act out some more
act out
listen what if we just
got rid of the doll
how bad would that be
i urge you to be patient
and allow him to have his friend
he found a place with this doll
where he feels safe
and the last thing we want fo do
is take that away
ill send you some links
with further information

in this part of the house
come on
it so nice to hear you talking
joseph what happened in this house
uh jude why dont you go
show brahms the music room
stay close mate
there was a family
that lived here a long time ago
had a son
went a bit mad
killed a little girl
got burnt up in fire
wore a mask to hide it
lived inside the walls
of the house for 30 years
never came out
the heelshires
yeah the heelshires
and
and the parents committed suicide
drowned themselves
it a very sad story
and the son
well it all got a bit messy
after the parents had gone
he killed a man very nearly two others
before he was killed himself
but theyre all dead and buried now
what the son name
his name was brahms
did you say brahms
im sorry
i didnt mean to keep it from you
i just didnt think itd ever come up
thank you for telling us
come on jude
it time to go home
hey joseph
did you ever find your dog
yes i did
im afraid oz was found
gutted in the forest
im sorry to hear that
so your parents fell me
youve been talking again
is this your new friend brahms
he seems like a very nice friend
what are some of the things
you talk about
he tells me all sorts of things
sometimes he tells me about
the other families he lived with
oh has he lived with a lot of families
he wants to live with us now
he was very angry that mommy and daddy
wanted to take him away
oh and when brahms gets angry
does he say he wants fo
hurt someone or something
is there something
he wants to tell your mum and dad
well if jude had something fo do
with the dog death
then this is a lof more serious
than we thought
the doll might be enabling him
fo shift blame
for all the bad things that he might do
i think it would be a good idea
for me fo see him face-to-face
when do you think
you can bring him down to london
weve got guests coming today
but well bring him as soon as we can
all right then
but i urge you keep a close eye on him

that happened out there
there were other tragedies before
back in the 50s a kid killed
his own mother and brother
convinced a doll was speaking to him
and its still going on
last year that city man
that bought it after the heelshires
went a bit mad and disappeared

he wants you to listen
you asked me why im here
it the same reason that you are
he called me
he calls out to the ones that need him
the damaged ones
he looks inside you
it was just a whisper
at first
when i first came here
so quiet
and he was in pieces when i found him
broken
and then the voice said
lo put him back together
so i did
then i heard him growing inside
you must have heard it
jude sure has
oh yeah
i dont know what brahms is
but you can stop this
it too late
brahms and jude are gonna be one
and itll be beautiful

they thought the heelshires
were crazy but no
it always been the doll
even before the house
before the davies the ones before that
i found all their old letters
he knew that you were coming
he knew your boy would find him
that why he told me to bury him
