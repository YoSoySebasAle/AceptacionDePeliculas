
oh hey
welcome to danny house
i was just having the most
craziest vivid dream
i was getting married
and the reception got ruined
for some reason
i thought everybody
would be cool with it
but they got pissed
so i jumped out the window
to escape
then i started getting chased
by this gigantic spider
then the spider teeth
fell out
which
according to dream analysis
that means he insecure
then i got worried
what if i was
in a spider dream
man what does
dream mean anyway
are we in a dream right now
are we always dreaming
probably not
aaaaaaaaaaah
whoa that was crazy man
i just had a dream i was doing
the opening for my show
and i had lobster claws
for hands
more cheap props
aaaaaaaaaaah
im not doing this shit again
feed it to the cats
oui oui oui
you never wrote jokes
i never sat down and wrote
but youre going to put them
together in your head yeah
like jay-z

about jacking off
a jack off within a jack off
within a jack off
within a jack off

to be on the head
of the greatest chef in europe

in europe
so i got myself a chef hat
my dream was to be
chef hat chef hat

and no stomach
that does not sound healthy

but some stuff i dont like
ooh that vague description
is making my mouth water
monsieur danny

but if i could eat anything
it would be a dish
from beautiful scenic austria

to austria before
allow me to take you there
through your taste buds
monsieur

for you today
is the traditional
vienna sausage

like you opened up
a can of little sausages
and dumped them on a plate
how **** dare you
i slave in this kitchen
night and day
and you just come over here
and act like you work for zagat
do you know hard it was for me
a chef hat without
any arms or legs or feet
to accomplish
this culinary feat
you know i could have been
a chef hat at p diddy
but i said no
let me go to danny house
and what do i get for it
all manner of disrespect
if you ever insult me or one
of my special cuisines again

acclaimed comedian and actor
the toast of vienna
gilbert gottfried
oh look
it gilbert gottfried
what up
yes yes
how are you doing
oh gilbert gottfried
i love to prepare for him
weve been talking about dreams
do you have any weird dreams
well there -
there the obligatory
being somewhere
without your pants on dream
all dreams are weird
do you have any wet dreams
uh well no
those i like
when im wide awake
you think people
have wet dreams about you
constantly
i-i think -
i think everybody
who watches me
do you ever have dreams about
you doing stand-up
ill have those classic
actor dream
where it like
a full-packed house
and they cant remember
any of their lines
you know that happened
to me in real life
i actually went on stage
and ready to do my thing
and once i got out there
literally my whole brain
just went blank
couldnt think of one word
couldnt think of one song
has something like that
ever happened to you
i used to smoke
whatever it called
in my day it was grass
they called it mm-hmm
yeah
we call it dope
yeah
kush
and yes and fire pack
get loud
so i used to smoke that
mm-hmm
sometimes i would smoke
and have a drink
before i got onstage
mm-hmm
i would write a bunch
of real funny things
you think youre great
no matter what
youre doing there
yeah
then you look at it onstage
and it like hat sandwich
and it like what
so i quit that
so do you think like dreams
mean anything
do you remember
those little books
that would define your dreams
youd look up oh if you dream
a bug is on you
it means this
i guess the crazy dream
like that
in some sense
like i dont know
i have like a random baby mama
i aint never seen before
yes that happens to me
all the time
yeah
random baby mamas
yeah id be like
ive never seen this person
in my life
but then we have kids
in fact in the book
and we doing all type of shit
it said if you dream
about a random baby mama
baby mama
what does that mean
it means you like
to go roller skating
yeah
i thought you were about
to say go raw dog
like sometimes you have like
dumb simple dreams
like you could just dream of
i dont know just like
a boat floating in the ocean
with like
a piece of shit on it
ah yes
freud used to talk about that
that one dream everyone has
is a boat floating in the ocean
with a piece of shit on it
yeah
yeah you need to shit
on a boat
do you have like
nightmares and stuff
i do
one dream i had as a kid
okay
when i eat a pizza
i wouldnt eat the crust
for some reason
i tossed the crust away
mm-hmm
and then i had a dream
that i was -
i think i was walking
through the park
and all these crusts
of pizza jumped
attack of the pizza crust
yes
oh my god
and they were like snakes
they had eyes and mouths
so why would they want
to with you
when you were saving them
i know it
see this is why
pizza crusts are
very unappreciative
when i was a kid
february was like
a real hard month for me
that because it was
black history month
and i would be in school
and they would always show us
these civil rights movies
and shit every day
every day mother
getting bit by dogs
spraying them
with hoses and shit
and i would go home
and i had to sleep
in a bed with my mama
cause i would have nightmares
why was
martin luther king dream
my nightmare
yeah well i
yeah i think they should get
rid of black history month
for that because it -
it -
it gives people bad dreams
what do you think people in jail
dream about
uh
not being in jail
you ever wrote a joke
in your dream
not a good one
oh
so in that way jokes are
in my dreams are like my jokes
in real life
