been more than right
on 34 test flights
if we could just
get them on the ground

improved aircraft that
never got off the ground
you know what i had
to promise washington

and financing
i know dad
not to mention
the thornwell 20 million
that riding

guess what
im going to be in sydney

pretty good down here
some small delays
but safety check starting
in about an hour

the telecommunications pods
more to come
hey listen freddie
what this i hear
about the chinese
well theyve got a right
to talk to the world too
dont they
what are they

beam down
fortune cookies laughs
laughing
nope i dont know
which is the bigger
news event
starflight
or freddie baron
incorporated
am i crazy
not so i noticed
im a scientist
im supposed to
deal in specifics
and im being spooked
by a feeling
the rockets again
the rockets again
josh you told me
that the only one
who could handle them
was cody briggs
sighing
he the best there is
but he is no match
for a computer
now am i
being difficult
no youre being josh
i mean the computers
dont show any no-nos
the tests were fine
everything was
you look wonderful
you ought to sleep
in a gray suit
sighs
thornwell
hello doppler
good day to you
mr thornwell
mr bowdish said
to tell you
he waiting for you
thank youand congratulations sir
to all of us
elliot is there anything
to josh fuss
about postponement
oh no it
it too remote
youd better show me
starflightis an airplane
it not a spaceship
it was designed to operate
in a gravity field
take a look at this
see before the booster
rockets are cut off
that thing is
moving at better than
half a mile a second
straight out
towards space
what josh is worried about
is a possibility of a slip
that could
lift  starflightright out
of the atmosphere
and you and i know
that cant happen
yeah but supposing
it does
what does that do
in terms of
cabin pressure
well youd have
a pressurized craft
pushing against
the nothingness
of a zero atmosphere
so if there
any structural flaw
beeping
man over pa
starflight one  is two hours
from liftoff and counting
woman over pa
other cabins have
been outfitted
for the news teams
that have formed
an international crew
to cover this event
starflight  is operated
through a complicated network
of computer banks
it took two years
to program the software
for these computers
your father
would like you
on his far right
so what new
chuckles
josh come on
you almost missed
your own flight
chuckles
mr thornwellthat right
okay shake hands again
very nice
i understand youre
having a few
well we wont
call them troubles
but some qualms
well uh
josh you give me
one shred of evidence
that this magnificent plane
of yours is not ready
to take off
and ill cancel
the flight
smile josh
i would prefer it
if the rockets
were under
ground control yes
but she is ready
for her maiden flight
isnt she
well uh
now will the two
mr thornwells
come with me
what if he wouldve

nope airplanes
dont bother me
chris wait up
there been
a delta launch
from australia
angle of ascent
45 degrees
any problems
were still tracking
but it could come close
to the hst flight plan
chattering
were tracking
a delta launch that
didnt clear with us
she moving in an arc
that characteristic of
a second stage malfunction
now if she malfunctions
there no telling
what course shell take
where the feed
from nasa
some kook got
a delta rocket
moving toward us
starflightto ground
bowdish over radio
go ahead cody
wed like permission
to let nasa
take us through this
that affirmative cody
okay
nasa were all yours
were watching you
like a hawk  starflight
now when we took off
here los angeles
it may have felt to you
as if we were going
straight up
well we were
just like a missile
and that because
this craft is powered
by rockets
we use that rocket power
to attain an altitude
of 00000 feet
at which point
we were going
at a speed of
approximately four
mach 4
that about
2500 miles per hour
there gotta be
something you can do
there not
a bloody thing i can do
the automatic
sequence control
didnt complete
the third stage rockets
arent firing mate
but youve got to
give it every chance
dont let them
blow it
dont please
bud  safety ground command
is turning purple
bud dont let
them destruct it
look mate
we dont have
a bloody third stage
bud you destruct it
and im going to
lose everything
i mean everything
we dont have any choice
freddie
youve got to
stop them somehow
stop em
bud destruct the rocket
explosion
she gone
yeah well
their timing stinks
starflight
the missile
been destroyed
cody over radio  what does
that mean for us
a million pieces
of space junk
headed towards you
at 8000 miles an hour
how close
at your speed
everything close
im out of
my element chris
what my move
chris  we cant
pin the debris
not sure you can manage
lateral traffic avoidance
give me my move chris
starflight
pull up and climb
at your best rate
that means the rockets
in preparation for landing
in sydney
over pa
ladies and gentlemen
this is captain briggs
please return
to your seats immediately
and fasten
your seat belts
it couldnt be weather
at this altitude could it
all right del hit it
cody over radio
were at 45000
you should be over debris
in five seconds
joehmm
what going on man
i dont know
chris over radio
stand by to level off
and return to 20000
standing by
okay  starflight
level off
standby to leveled off
kill rockets
rockets are still burning
beeping
we mustve
taken a hit
rocket control wiring
cody over radio
thornwell ground
this isstarflight one
we think weve
taken a hit
weve lost all controls
to rocket thrust
we cannot
kill the burn over
cody weve got you
at 60000 and climbing
over
cody  how long
until the rockets
burn out on their own
two minutes
and four seconds
were an airplane
not a space ship
you know where
thatll push us
yeah straight up through
the atmospheric lid
450000 feet
into space
kill the burn cody
kill the burn
340000 and climbing
bowdish this is  starflight
how much time to burnout
twenty-four seconds
when do they hit space
450000 feet
cody  380000
del 43000
how long to bum out
fifteen seconds
me might make it
rumbling
how much time
bowdish
seven seconds
four three
bowdish  one burnout
were in orbit
eighty-seven miles up
end of ride
ladies and gentlemen
this is your captain
we are not in
any immediate danger
we are all weightless
so until we get some
more information
please stay
in your seats
with belts fastened
kind of get
everything loose
fastened down
well appreciate it
thank you
will josh gilliam
and erica hansen
please come
to the flight deck
you all right
yeahlet go
grab on
beeping
cody  thornwell ground
this isstarflight one
we have made
a preliminary check
there are no injuries
fifty-nine of us
are alive and well
waiting for
your instructions
where the hell
did everybody go
cody this is bowdish
you realize that uh
that plane was
not designed to
go into orbit
so we dont have
that information
in the computer
and were going to
need some think time
over radio  briggs
chris lucas at nasa
first directive calls for you
to save electrical power
no hot coffee
no microwave
and pull
the transmission plug to
that news bay of yours
does that get us home
weve got a preliminary
that gives you 50 hours
before your orbit
degenerates
and then things heat up
how our air
this is schultie cody
we should have a fix
on that for you
in a few minutes
cody you better
check the skin
on that ship
pressure looks normal
in all areas
briggs
well be tracking you
around the world
theyre talking
but theyre not
saying much
starflightout
let me see what
i can come up with
cody could you talk
to them about
the weightlessness again
if you keep them informed
they may not panic
i better get out there
right
ladies and gentlemen
this is captain briggs again
i repeat we are in
no immediate danger
the aircraft has not
been significantly damaged
the pressure
in all the cabins
is completely normal
thornwell ground control
and nasa
are already
initiating procedures
that will get us
back on course
were assured of nasa
complete cooperation
electricity crackling
in the meantime
if youd kind of
get everything loose
fastened down
wed appreciate it
thank you
this is for the news bay
in order
to save battery power
were suspending live
transmission facilities
to earth
well they pulled the plug
but that doesnt stop us
using our battery pack
why dont you guys
set up over in there
cameraman
godspeed boss
this is felix duncan
aboard  starflight one
in orbit
in a weightless environment
aboard a ship that
was not designed
for space flight
we are circling the earth
once every 90 minutes
for all intents and purposes
this is an aircraft that
has already crashed
well theyve got
at least 48 hours
before an
uncontrolled reentry
what have they got
on the outside
sixty
sixty
they have 60 hours
of oxygen left
that borderline
borderline
what are you saying
im saying
it borderline
there not enough oxygen
for that many people
for that long a period
of time
do i have to
spell it out for you
the only way were going
to get that thing down here
is to reactivate
the booster rockets
but the controls
are locked
all the fuel was
used up on the burn
i know that
and chris lucas of nasa
is doing
a feasibility study
on having
the space shuttle columbia
replenish the fuel
she going to
need a heat shield
to reenter
the atmosphere
im working on that
okay
excuse me
refuel the rockets
lucas youre crazier
than i am
what have you got
a tank full
of liquid hydrogen
stashed up here
chris it columbia briggs
shell be making
the delivery
her crew will
refill your tank with
the liquid hydrogen
were getting ready
to the send
the space shuttle
columbia up to you
right now
our best team is
at canaveral
it chief honcho
is captain kenny herrera
hell pilot the ship
thank god
weve learned how
to get them up fast
liftoff will be
in two hours
give it a shot
del check the cargo bays
see that everything
is still secured
were orbit plus 45
weve just gone halfway
around the world
door opens
del ive finished
the inspection
we have a damaged strut
in b cargo hold
seal going
if we close her off
we lose that much air
b cargo
that at least 0%
we lose four or five hours
even if columbia
does find us
how do we get back
without a heat shield
we dont
rocket liftoff
we got liftoff
columbia on its way up
to youstarflight
columbia to houston
we have target in sight
chuckles
is that ever
beautiful
oh boy
shall we do it
linda over radio
ready to refuel them
starflight
when were ready to feed
you release
the number three
fuel hatch
we copy
captain briggs
im ready to feed
that affirmative
linda  ready
captain herrera
start pumping
fueling completed
captain briggs
closing hatch
returning to columbia
could you take a look
at our rocket bay
we may have sustained
some damage
crackling
linda  captain briggs
you were right
your external
rocket system
control line is split
how long to
make the splices
sir this is a maze
im looking at
ill consult
with captain herrera
for now id cut
the power feed
to this line
captain briggs
we copy
if we could find
another configuration
a different angle
to reduce friction
to a minimum
we just might be able
to affect reentry
i mean
shed heat up
but she might
come through
then figure it out
sighs well we cant
what about nasa
nasa would need
the performance
characteristics
of the design
and theyre just not
in the computer
you see we ordered josh
not to put them
in the computer
internal security
i mean weve never
had a conventional aircraft
in a reentry mode before
90% of this maneuver
depends on the instincts
of the person
who designed the system
and that josh
columbia carries
an airlock
they could get him
and bring him back
it seems ironic
you two planning a way
to bring josh home
when if you had just
listened to him
in the first place
cody we think we can
jury-rig our airlock
to fit over
your sectioned-off
equipment compartment
therell be
spacesuits inside
well be bringing
the airlock over
to pick up josh gilliam
at nasa request
we copy
i guess we better
make sure it works
before we risk
josh gilliam
im the only one here
who wrote on
his school application
that he wanted
to be an astronaut
oh listen petecase closed
captain you better speak
to josh
all right pete
clanking
cody were here
all right ill patch
you over to ray
on phone  pete
this is ray barstow
the guy in
a funny white suit
you hear me okay
affirmative
on voice cue youll open
your compartment hatch
enter the airlock
then you close
starflight  hatch
linda  ready pete
pete  yeah
sorry all the great
space walk lines have
already been used
see you soon
all right ill secure
the compartment
have a good trip
ill catch the next one
piece of cake
linda  open the
compartment hatch
beeping
im in the airlock
about to suit up
ray  get the suit
and helmet on as quick
as possible pete
let us know
when youve got
the suit on
pete  im going
as fast as i can
your funny white suit
all right
i always wanted one
ray  yup it goes
with anything
make sure you shut
the airlock hatch pete
rattling
ray  pete
is your hatch shut
rattling
screaming
pete im so sorry
no more guinea pigs
there got to be
another way to
get you off
all right
but this time
it just me
no more guinea pigs
our transmission frequencies
are being monitored
the whole world
knows about pete
i think you have to
let people see that
were still all right
return power
to press bay
crackling
starflighthas
about 39 hours
of oxygen left
unless their orbit
breaks down
and they reenter
before then
damned if i can
figure this out
josh is the guy
to get everyone down
we got to figure a way
to get him down
schultie give me
a reading on that
oxygen clock will you
thirty-six hours
4 minutes
reporter weve got
the pilot wife
that janet briggs
grab your gear
have you been in contact
with your husband
no i havent
im sorry
when did you first hear
about the disaster
excuse me
i have got to
do you have
any children
im sorry im sorry
im janet briggs
can you let me throughhow does it feel
to have a world famous
husband in orbitplease
this information will
only help you
to tell the public
reporters clamoringplease i cant see
with that light
will you please
let me through
how are you
im okay
i appreciate you
you know
always did
it just seems easier
to tell you now
janet showed up
at ground control
i wouldve
expected that
didnt you
i guess
every 45 minutes
turn the lights on
turn em offswitch clicking
it the only entertainment
on this $50 million
flying coffin
this is not our coffin
we are going
to get back
cody wont we
lucas cody here yeah cody
chris if some kind of
air tight container
could be rigged
inside the luggage bay
could it be used
to transfer someone
that affirmative briggs
what are you thinking
erica tell josh to
pack his toothbrush
he going home
yes sir
look here how maybe
it can go down okay
the luggage compartment
is sealed off from
the rest of the ship
we load josh
into the casket
and the two astronauts
open the compartment
and pull josh to columbia
wouldnt he
need oxygen
the whole operation
will take four
to five minutes
there enough
oxygen in there
to sustain him
let suppose that thing
isnt really airtight
at best all josh
would have would be
a few cubic feet of air
and what left
in his own lungs
martin got a point
even a hairline fracture
or a pinhole
look i think josh
knows the risks
better than we do
chris over radio
houston to columbia
you still there kenny
what do you need chris
we might put you down
at thornwell in california
any problems
is that launch facility
of theirs operational
affirmative
okay as long
as we have our
own ground crew
can you handle
the ambassador wife
there no other way
look we ran out of
moral niceties
when those rockets
wouldnt turn off
if you dont believe me
go ask your passengers
how they feel about
swapping a dead man
for a chance to
get out of here alive
we dont have time
to think of another way
we just dont
ill talk
to mrs winfield
good girl
cody yeah cody here
linda and ray are
starting across to you
theyll open
the luggage bay hatch
and take delivery
of the casket
with josh in it
when you
give me the word
that a roger
were still
losing pressure
i cant figure out where
what about
b cargo hold
i checked itcheck it again
sobbing it not right
oh please
it not right
there no other way
sobbing
cody youll get your tush
frozen out there
not exactly my idea
of first class
transportation no
help help
whooshing
about four minutes worth
of air in here
shouldnt take
longer than that
you could hold your breath
for another three
if youre in shape
im not
linda  were at
the luggage bay hatch
ready to
take the casket
check the seal
sighs
no light leaks
hermetically sealed
i dont suppose theyve
ever had a consumer
complaint
let go
there a hole
the size of my fist
i didnt have
a choice cody
i sealed off
the entire cargo hold
you did right
depressurize
the luggage bay
now we lose the air
in the luggage compartment
starflighthere
starflight
you ready
my copilot decompressing
the luggage compartment now
in 30 seconds
well open the hatch
josh is halfway
to columbia now
hissing soundgasps
gasping for breath
are you all right
there was a leak
what did you do
laughs
remember the story
of the little dutch boy
and the dike
crackling
schultie over radio
were figuring
how much air you lost
look schultie
we got two compartments
sealed off
now that means lost air
which means lost time
i want
there must be millions
yup
all of it wouldnt
buy us out of this mess
starflight
this is bowdish
at control over
cody over radio
go ahead bowdish
we calculate youve lost
about nine hours
of your air supply over
roger bowdish out
youd better reset
that clock
theyve got 7 hours
and eight minutes
of oxygen left
well if josh doesnt
come up with a miracle
we can take our pick
suffocate or burn up
on reentry
thanks
man over pa
that touchdown
for columbia
back from rendezvous with
starflight one  in space
what about reentry
were projecting
2 hours
well i guess
we dont get
to choose
the air will run out
four hours sooner
than that
all chattering
give me a plane deck
rotate it
sighs
what else you got
captain our cupboards
are just about bare
you fellows got
a catering truck
you can put
some wings on
sure briggs
if you dont
mind your caviar
coming out of
a toothpaste tube
well be sending it to you
the next time we can get
columbia up
what the hell is that
sighs
elliot elliot
what is it
what does that
look like to you
whatthat
what a tunnel
the universal
docking device
could be
it could work
whatve you got
in there on it
felix  we have
just been told what
the rescue operation is
it involves
a universal docking device
built by thornwell aviation
as part of
its space program
this device
will be carried up
tostarflight
by that heroic
space traveler
the shuttle columbia
about to be launched again
from southern california
as we wait
each passenger is
surely wondering
if home and loved ones
will ever be seen again
yet there hope
and a triumph
of the human spirit up here
onstarflight one
as for
the rescue itself
the docking device
has been altered
to conform
to the hatch design
ofstarflight one
working
in tandem with nasa
well the waiting over
for you at least
you havent
lost him janet
yes i have
man over pa
ten nine eight seven
six five four
three two one zero
rumbling
columbia has liftoff
on its way
tostarflight one
cody as you know
weve got some
decisions to make
including us
there 57 survivors
columbia only has
its flight deck
quarters pressurized
they figure they can
squeeze in 20 at a time
three jumps in all
six of us as crew
will be the last
to leave
well have a drawing
on the decision
for the passengers
now these people will
be floating through
a snaking tunnel
50 miles up
getting into
the nearest thing
we have to a spaceship
and gliding
to a landing
without engines
it going
to be scary
weve got to
play it down
theyre already numb
with fear
i think some of them
are probably in shock
somebody could panic
what happens
if a piece
of space debris
pops the skin
of the tunnel
amy prepare the lists
for the drawing
passengers chattering
jack bernard
mrs edward harvey
mrs lucille hunt
frederick baron
scott mcgee
hal paressi
okay that the 20
it been decided
that you will go across
five at a time
the five will be
decided by the 20
ill need your decisions
right away
passengers chattering
del there are
the blue plate
specials you ordered
thanks
okay everybody
now youre going to
be kind of pulling
yourselves across
on a white nylon rope
inside the chute
ill go first
just follow me
dont be afraid
youll be fine
now watch your heads
man over pa  the first group
of five hasnt come out
of the tunnel yet
still waiting houston
ray okay now if
you five do as well
as the last five did
youre going to
make a hero out of me
easy we go
crackling
man over pa
that touchdown
for columbia
carrying the five
rescued passengers
fromstarflight one
josh it wasnt
your fault
that conduit
was still hot
space shuttle columbia
you got five
of them down
you can bring
the rest home
i just killed
five people
you didnt kill them
you tried to save them
ah what better
killing five at a time
or all at once
they have 2 hours
of oxygen left
you are the only chance
theyve got
dont you understand
i would need a bus to
bring them all back
then get them a bus
sighs
there is a way
we can get most
of them down anyway
culver air has
a booster tank for
their mayflower rocket
which if my figuring
is accurate
will fit almost exactly
inside columbia
cargo hold
put down that phone
put it down
now you listen to me
all three of you
that gantry out there
that orbitor
processing facility
the one that
columbia using now
that represents
$93 million
ive got to eat
cause we lost
the space shuttle
contract to culver
and i know how
they did it
industrial espionage
bowdish tell mr gilliam
about bart culver
bowdish he right josh
bart culver had
a whole network of
spies working on us
as a matter of fact
six of the key design
components were ours
those culver cutthroats
shafted me for $ billion
that was the size
of the contract we lost
mr gilliam
and now you expect me
to go crawling back
to culver
and have him
reap the praise
and the rewards
for rescuing
my hst project
are you telling me
that all those people
up there have to die
just so that bart culver
doesnt get credit
for the rescue
what the hell kind
of ajust one minute josh
you just watchall right
both of you
get out of here
josh count on
that booster tank
excuse me qt
yes get me bart culver
over at culver industries
our position changed
yeah the force
of the explosion
shifted us around
would you care to
join me in a tube
of roast beef
chuckles
suddenly youre funny
it the altitude
we dont have
very long do we
hold me please
oh
i love you
sighs
i wont say anything
to lori
softly
wait a minute
i love you
for a long time
im sorry
i guess i got hung up
on loyalty with janet
and probably pity
im sorry i didnt
grab on to you
stay close to lori huh
josh over radio  cody
there just one catch
say it josh
the tank can only hold
38 people maximum
some are gonna
have to stay behind
and we can only
use it once cody
im sorry
man over pa
columbia has liftoff
after a record turn around
of two hours
bowdish four hours
and 0 minutes
of oxygen left
man over pa
this is columbia houston
at rendezvous
withstarflight one
were about to
send the booster
tank across
this tank isnt exactly
a suite at the plaza
the people
on the ground
have it figured
that it will
hold 38 of you
i believe there are
with your staff and crew
somewhat more than that
six of the crew will stay
and therell
be three volunteers
passengers murmuring
well id like to
offer my services
if i may
well i mean
there are things to
be recorded here
your courage
achievements
like you
i always like to
be in at the finish
huh
thanks felix
now we need one
i thought
you needed two more
im about to
draft one myself
the rest of you
will have to
make the most
of lousy
accommodations
but only for
a short time we hope
mmm is this tomato juice
and tabasco sauce
no it apricots
oh
for a man who afraid
of flying
you sure look
pretty cool to me
you ran out of booze
and i ran out
of cold sweat
joe you know everything
on this airplane
still functions
scram jets
hydraulic systems
rockets
weve even got fuel
you know
the booster tanks
is a two-way street
it bringing us
a space suit with
life support systems
for what
i want you to
fix the wiring
to the rocket controls
youre gonna try
and fly this thing back
joe you ever skip
a flat rock across a lake
and watch it skim
and bounce along
on the surface
i want to give reentry
that kind of shot
cody i have
skipped a few rocks
on a few lakes
in my time
and i never saw one yet
that didnt sink
it one chance
in a million
well so was
this accident
cody
i am scared out
of my mind
being up here
inside this plane
and you want me
to go outside
laughing
oh no
sighs
ill need a wire stripper
and some wire nuts
and a dry pair of pants
when i get back
excuse me
excuse me please
please
excuse me
excuse me
if you dont make it back
i will never forgive you
boy are we glad
to see you
im glad
we could make it
back at you ray
could you stow that
back there please
let form
a human chain
erica
flashlights are inside
to your left
watch your step
and hang on
ive got
your other volunteer
benny youve got
no responsibility to
no no wait wait
felix and i
see this thing
the same way
now if we happen to
get out of here alive
we have got ourselves
one hell of a story
laughs
photographed exclusively
by the one and only
benny collins
those pictures better
be good
crackling
man over pa
all 38 aboard
the tank separating
fromstarflight  now
and returning
to columbia
captain briggs
can you seal off
everything
aft of cabin c
that affirmative
houston
we can divert
all remaining air forward
well know pretty quick
how much time
thatll buy you
thanks for being
so helpful houston
damn
columbia will be bringing
those people down
but well be
monitoring you
starflight
jet firing
cody over radio
joe just starting
outside to the rocket conduit
tap that vernier jet
give me an honest
day work joe
ive got joe outside
repairing the rocket cables
so if you can crank up
those toys of yours
and give me
the best shot
at reentry
look without
a heat shield
there no angle
that will work
it just cant be done
you got any better idea
ill get one
chris  houston here
weve just
got an update on your
time of reentry cody
starflightwill reenter
the earth atmosphere
in 73 minutes
captain it going
to take me hours
to sort this thing out
no it wont joe
youve got to do it
in less than one
oh my god
all right
keep it coming
come on
beeping
sighs
okay captain
check the primary circuit
that a good one joe
thatll do it
it all yours now cody
now you give me
a good day work
if we try to put
this thing back
in the atmosphere
were finished
now you tell me
what have we got
to lose
beeping
what i really need is
a pulling guard running
interference for us
exhales
put up columbia
all right now
add a plow wave effect
all right now
put  starflightin
right behind her
okay keep her coming
come on closer
closer
all right right there
okay hold it
schultie get me nasa
all weve got to do is
find the right angle
hello houston
yeah listen
you got columbia
touching down here
in about what
forty-seven minutesforty-seven minutes
do you think
she could make another jump
with minimum processing
what for
so she can watch
the burn up
can she do it
not quick enough
by the time
she got back up
there wouldnt be
anything left
of  starflight
got anything else
hanging around
anything up
there already
hold on
were checking
sighs
come on come on
xu5 is up doing repairs
on a military satellite
can you clarify
all right now listen
you remember
when you used
to have to piggyback
your twin shuttle
to florida on a 747
im going for
the flip side of that
sorry about
the gloom before
that all right
josh just had
a brainstorm
columbia xu5 is
on her way to us
could get here
before we take the dive
if she does
well maneuver behind
her plow wave
and ride her shadow
shell be
our heat shield
yeah if we stay
close enough
and if we dont pile up
and take both ships out
codyi know
columbia not
big enough
the wing tips will burn
a little
it crazy
that it is
cody  recheck your
projected oxygen bowdish
weve got
big problems
yes we know captain
we had an upside
and a downside
in our projections
then our readings
are accurate
we cant make it
to reentry
not with nine of you using
the remaining oxygen no
look if
if there were maybe
five or six of you
look dont ever stand
where i can see you
bowdish
because if you do
ill tear you in half
so help me god
now if we mean anything
to anyone down there
then somebody will
get that damn guy out
of the control area
because i dont want
to hear his voice again
man over pa  now returning

let check
cody  were sharing
what oxygen left

josh over radio  listen
better blow the airlock
itll throw you off

cody  were falling
too fast
im having trouble
