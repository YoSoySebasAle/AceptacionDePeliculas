follow me
this is your father
yes
youve come from ethiopia
where were you before that
morocco
how long were you there
2 years
where were you born
my father told me i was born
on a mongolian fishing boat
off the coast of botswana
but theyre
yes
two landlocked countries
i know that now
and your mother did she have
a different version
of your birth
she said they found me
under a leaf
right
someone from ethiopia
if they were to come to
england how would i know
with the sheer
volume of refugees
and the fact that
not everyone ends up
in the united kingdom
im afraid there no way
now if youll follow me
i need to go back
that impossible
the country in chaos
yes
if you step this way please
take a seat here
just wait here
hi yes
i pray your heart
will answer yes
and free me
come on darlin free me
only you
can free me from
this misery
i know that i told you a lie
come on mom
but did you have
to say good bye
without your love
i cant go on
so please dont
leave me all alone
and free me
darling darling free me
only you
can free me from
this misery
well done lilly
when i was
seven years old
my parents took me
to a sufi shrine
why are we here
to see the great abdal
they took me
there to be blessed
by a revered sufi master
the great abdal
at least that
what they told me
mom
mom mom
where are you going
were just uh
going for a ride
why arent you taking me
why dont you go back and play
with the other children
no but mom
sorry lilly
well be back
before you know it
well see you soon lilly
it took some doing
but we were able to find
a record of a daughter
born to a philip
and alice mitchel named lilly
seems they applied for
a passport for you
at the british
consulate in istanbul
they never returned
to pick it up
this card identifies
you as a british citizen
and permits you to return
home with all due rights
and privileges something
you will come to appreciate
if you have any sense at all
but that not my name
it is now
attention please
i have a short announcement
is there someone who
can translate for me
is the english girl here
ill do it
do you want me to translate into
amharic harari or oromigna
whatever you think best
very well you may proceed
the refugee referral agency
will arrange for long-term
housing at several
different council estates
as they become available
the name of anyone eligible
for immediate consideration
will be posted on a bulletin
board in the dining area
but what happens to us
if were not chosen
until your name
appears on that list
you can assume that most of you
will be here for
the foreseeable future
now if there are
no further questions
i have a question
when will she be back
she wont
when a person in authority says
and if there are no
further questions
it means they had no intention
of answering them
in the first place
i didnt know that
then you have a lot to learn
nouria
what did we expect
excuse me
im supposed to go to
the pelham garden estate
pelham is what we say
pelham
that it right there
straight ahead and turn left
youll see it
and there no garden
thank you
all right
she been circumcised
i told her
i know what you told her
you would make a good nurse
you are right
now i must ask you
some questions
i dont really know anything
you should really ask nouria
my questions are not
about the child
oh
who are you
and what in the world
are you doing in harar
is this information
required by the hospital
by me
im curious
you may have noticed you do
not look like anyone else here
yes i did
but there was supposed
to be a teacher here
i lived in harar
a muslim like you
i studied quran with the
great abdal at the shrine
to the blessed bilal al habeshi
wait
wait
were not interested
i know i know
a question please
just one moment
do you know this man
here in london
or is he still in harar
im not sure
sorry
who is this doctor to you
and when did that
become our business
just look again please
no my dear
we dont know this man
ive come to check
on the patient
oh lilly
may i speak to you
i would like to speak
to you in english
but i feel your friends
would not approve
why would they consider it wrong
to speak in more than one language
because it would appear
as if you and i were alone
surely my reaction to your words
would tell them everything
they need to know
and what reaction is that
i dont have one
or perhaps i havent
decided yet
if you do decide
and would consider sharing
that information with me
you might meet me at
the hospital at noon
three days from now
that is when nouria will
run out of the bandages
im about to give her
and then what
that would be up to you
i would like to go somewhere
where i can see water
you dont make things easy
do you
i dont make them
any way at all
get something green
like the sea
you might be eligible for
a position as a cleaner
but that all
for 2 years i was taught
quran by the greatest
sufi master in morocco
as well as mathematics astronomy
and classical persian poetry
im sorry but nothing
youve told me
suggests you qualify for
the auxiliary nursing program
youre saying im not
capable of emptying a bedpan
im sure you are but there are
people with actual experience
just as eager to do so
if youll follow me
i speak arabic
some amharic and enough harari
and oromigna to translate
the patients
surely with the countless
refugees arriving every day
that would be helpful
be here tomorrow at eight
to meet with the supervisor
of the auxiliary
nursing program
now dont misunderstand
youll primarily be
emptying those bedpans
which weve already
established i can do
how come i always lose
when i play with you huh
he cheats
i know you
just keep going
a few more stairs
and well get you into bed
she having a baby
dont just stand there help me
where my son
he there
where my son
he there he there he right there
hold my hand
breathe breathe
hold my hand
come and sit up
oh god
dont resist
come come
come on
now
w start pushing yes that it
it coming
push now a bit harder
come on
come on
nearly there
is he okay
he is a she
hello
ahmed come and see your sister
my son
is there someone
we should call for you
someone at home
i found her in the building one over
she was looking for a woman called daisy
daisy
they said when i was
in the shelter there
that she may be
able to take us in
daisy obasi
ah okay
the rich boyfriend in
manchester he finally proposed
she gone im afraid
is there somewhere
else you can stay
she can stay with me
shell need these it gets
cold in here at night
it must be nice to have
this place all to yourself
i didnt ask for it
you didnt have to
i just need a few hours
get a little sleep
there fruit in the kitchen and
biscuits in the cupboard by the sink
oh thank you lilly
haile selassie
claims he modernizing
creating a cash-crop economy
isnt that a good thing
the farmers dont grow food
for their families anymore
they grow it for
the rich landlords
and what do they do
sell it around the world
while their own people starve
and as the emperor dogs
eat off golden plates
i had no idea
as you requested
i imagine this isnt
what you expected
i didnt know what to expect
right now
in this nearly perfect moment
it is easy to imagine
that anything is possible
that i wont see injustice
and despair everywhere i turn
when a thief looks at a saint
all he sees are pockets
so im a thief am i
it a sufi saying
it means what
we perceive in the world
tells us who we are
tell me what do you perceive
in the world
that too much to ask
then tell me what you
see when you look at me
you want to know what
i see when i look at you
i shouldnt be here
then well go
uh-oh discovered
n no im
im not doing what
you think im doing
i mean i am
but for someone in need
no i meant me
youve discovered
my hiding place
it hard to read around doctors
when theyre talking about
what it is they talk about
when they arent
doing any doctoring
that was humor
or an attempt at
something like it
then im leaving now
oh before you go
zinc oxide
nappy cream
im fatima you may
go downstairs
dont you worry ive got
everything under control
youre in for it now
they wont let me
leave for 40 days
but of course
i wont stay that long
no
that how it must be done
it will be a good thing
for both of us
really
you are full of surprises
english girl
my papa dead
mine too
it has to look
especially nice today
make sure you fluff it
im fluffing mrs peele
there you look lovely
she right
you do look lovely
my son is coming
to visit me today
perhaps a touch of lipstick
why dont we let the doctor take a look at you first
oh of course
this wont take long
i promise
no sign of infection
im very pleased
miss
abdal
right right
yes i must make note
given that were old friends
so tell me who been
attending to the surgical site
i have
for someone with no training
youre doing excellent work
which im saying because
there no sign of infection
the training comment
was not relevant at all
yes
that was meant
to be a compliment
though it likely didnt sound
like one that what it was
i was acknowledging your skill
yes of course
thank you doctor
please dont
just dont make it worse
just
good
excellent carry on
aziz
im so glad you came
i didnt know if it
was the right building
this is what we do here
we watch exactly what
the emperor wants us to see
we complain we criticize
we imagine resisting
but we still watch
you see this pale color
these are the best leaves
the sweetest
the army
is with us munir
soldiers are turning their guns
on their own corrupt officers
because they are
planning to take power
good it cant be
worse than haile selassie
it can always be worse
theyll get rid of
haile selassie
but theyll never
let the power go
you dont know what in
the minds of the soldiers
they want to feed their
family just like us
the same soldiers who are
setting fields on fire
to keep the crops
from their enemies
destroying food while
their own people starve
sadia
you are right sadia
the soldiers mutiny in
asmara and we sit and talk
the unions call for a general
strike and we sit and talk
the army arrests government
officials civilians
and guess what we do
lilly please
do you mind if we go
aziz
aah
where are we going
mr djimon
i am so sorry
what wrong
he wont say anything
i promise
i should feel nothing but shame
and no doubt i will but
in this moment im happy
i should get back
nouria will be worried
today i thought i saw someone
i knew at the hospital
chased him down the hall
it wasnt him
hmm
there is a man
i knew it
such eyes
i can see why youd
want to chase him
it wasnt like that
it wasnt
not just that
what
so many people
she looks like nouria
might she be here
i cant imagine it
she would have gone
to the shrine
and your doctor
anyone he met from home
would have sent him here
to put up a message
he said hed do
whatever it took
no matter what
then make it as easy
for him as you can
i see youve found
my favorite seat
i always come out here
early to get this bench
it uh it quiet
even when it not
you know what i mean
how can i
it doesnt make any sense
i didnt know
it actually had to
here please it yours
we could have shared it
you know
people do that all the time
i know i know i know
but i prayed all night
that sitta would sleep
so that makes up for it
that not how it works
and when i wasnt praying
i was thinking about food
now which one should i have
cabbage curry
or carrot curry
they both taste
exactly the same
my father would say curry
requires an education
interesting
tell me more
there not much to tell
my parents died
when i was seven
a child alone is
is a terrible thing
i wasnt alone
the shrine to bilal al
habeshi in morocco took me in
the great abdal became
my teacher and my father
and that the whole story
until my journey to harar
lilly
you are hopeless
what do you mean
nobody knows anything
so they fill in
the facts where they can
vertise she swears that your
father was a big game hunter
and your mother owned
a coffee plantation
why would she say that
for fun
it in a book
the thing i dont
understand is why anyone
cares about these things
because that what people
do when we come together
we tell each other our stories
and if you cant share your
story then who are you
i spoke to mrs jahangir
yesterday at the market
she said i can work there
three days a week to start
it not much but
if i get another job
you should teach
of course i should
teach
now if only my degree
my references
my experience would be
able to convince someone
other than you that
i am qualified
but that not the point
my point is
if i get another job then
we can get our own place
is that what you want
no
but surely you need me to go
ahmed be careful
what about your story
with their father
we knew what was
happening in the country
but for us everything was
it was good
yusuf started going to
these political meetings
then he took part in strikes
and protests against
the emperor
and i i said
silly man what
what are you playing at
youre an agronomist
what do you know
of such things
when haile selassie
soldiers
beat him until he was broken
and bleeding and lying at the
feet of his wife and his son
he was so surprised
dont do it
those are new shoes
ahmed
ahmed
there is no meeting today
where is aziz
what are you doing here
i i wanted to be with you
i thought there would be a meeting
djimon has heard
the house is being watched
we cannot meet here again
then when will i be
able to see you
come away with me one night
no i cant
what would i tell nouria
uh tell her you are shopping
for sadia wedding
it another lie
everything is changing lilly
everything
what does that have to do
with the nature of my sins
just say yes
say yes
yes
be careful
promise me
my goal is to bring
lilly into the 20th century
whether she likes it or not
that was my sofa
ah well this is your sofa now
i bought it from vertise
she got a new one
with blue and pink flowers
on a cream background
which looks terrible with her
green carpet if you ask me
deh nobody is
so what do you think
it very plaid
excellent observation
but it also does
something very special
ahmed come and show
auntie her surprise
this is wonderful
ive never seen anything like it
you see what i mean
every day with lilly i get
to experience the world anew
amina
are you all right
we should go to hospital
no
amina
it could be something serious
i know what it is
in the refugee camp
i had to do whatever
i could to protect ahmed
of course
the guards when they
saw i wasnt circumcised
they turned me over
and did it the other way
sometimes there is pain
sometimes there blood
it over now
it will never be over
the water cold
ill check on sitta
how long were you in the camp
eight months
you figured it out
you could have told me
which part
the shame that my yusuf
isnt her father
or the relief
that he didnt have to live
knowing what they
did to his wife
allahu akbar
you must make a truly
light meringue mrs peele
i have never been able to make a
floating island actually float
let me see
good afternoon mr jahangir
afternoon
come and see what
im doing in the storeroom
oh yes she has big plans
wants to do everything
but sell my groceries
so what do you think
about what
our new office
why do we need an office
for the ethiopian family
reunification association
but there no such thing
well there is now
see after djibouti
i had to go through
the central refugee
office in rome
there were thousands
of us just waiting
i know i was there for
i dont know how many weeks
we were there for months and we just waited
while they did their endless paperwork
now if the office in
rome could send a list
of new arrivals from ethiopia
it could be matched with
a list of people here
searching for their relatives
where would that list come from
how many
ethiopian refugees
are in our community
center alone
and almost every one of
them is just like you
like me
they want to know if the
loved ones they left behind
got out of the country alive
look my husband is gone
you dont know that for sure
you only saw them take him away
he gone
we will do this together
but for our own reasons
now i believe your
exact words were
see
you really have no choice
amina customer
do you believe miss nairobi
won wearing that dress
lilly are you going to do
that until we get to dire dawa
sadia we lied
were not going to shop
for your wedding
so what we harm no one
but what if you and i
if we both
have sex
me and munir have done it
twice
arent you worried
about my parents finding out
about your soul
ah lilly
youre so naive
i see munir
thank you
youre a very practical muslim
i like to decide
things for myself
surely you have considered the quran
is not meant to be taken literally
that it is a a story to be
interpreted by each in his own way
i am sorry
i am sorry
it has been pointed out
to me more than once
that i tend to state
the obvious
clarity is not a sin
but boring people is
ive actually tasted
liquor before
truly
when was this
when i was five-years-old
maybe six
you are teasing me
im not
my parents had very
unusual ideas
they were not muslim
no no
i have wondered
why you never spoke
of your father and mother
the great abdal
taught me to look forward
and so here you are
with a muslim who
believes his faith is
open to interpretation
yeah
here i am
a free spirit after all
no
free spirits do
not fear judgment
and so what are you
someone who risking
the chance for paradise
in the next life to be
with you in this one
the office in rome sends
a new list every month
and if your husband
name is on it
i promise i will call you
you have a daughter
god has been good to you
enough for today
let go home
what about the post
it can wait
ill get the chips
you get the curry
hello
two specials please
thank you
lilly
lilly
hi
i was just having dinner
right

amina i truly hope

as do i
what is wrong with you
how could you be so rude to him
i dont know there something
about him i find very irritating
i thought he was a lovely man
perfect gentleman
yes too perfect
isnt that a good thing
stop
there is no one for me but aziz
ahmed
bring me my glasses
i dont know where they are
look for them
theyre
probably in her bag
ahmed
when i tell you
to do something
ahmed
youre going
back to mrs chilolo
but she doesnt have tv
now ahmed
do what your auntie says
your husband is alive amina
he wont be able to look at me
you dont understand
yusuf is a scholarly man
so
he knows the quran
and so do you
it says that if someone
is forced to do something
like you were
theyre not guilty if a sin
forced
when yusuf hears what
happened hell understand
i didnt fight lilly
i didnt fight
i walked into their barracks
and i offered myself to them
you did it to protect your son
stop
what would you say to any
other woman in that camp
if she had done
what she could do
to survive because
she knew her life was sacred
that it was a gift from allah
she would never leave
her child all alone
what would you say to her
i would say
i would tell her she was right
that she did the right
the right thing
what if he doesnt want sitta
you said that yusuf believed
he must always strive
to do better in the eyes of god
isnt that right
yes
then give him
the chance to do that
he alive
alhamdulillah
alhamdulillah
i dont have the words
if you only had a minute to tell
him everything you needed to
what would you tell him
about sitta
yes about sitta
and about learning
that he alive
i would tell him
now that i know
that he survived
i can let myself remember just
how much we loved each other
how he taught me
about photosynthesis
how i taught him how to dance
are you sure
move against me
are we in love
i am
how do you know
it is a feeling
right here
what is it
munir and i are not
returning to harar
things are happening in the north
we cant just watch from afar anymore
what about the hospital
this is more important
were going to fight for people
who cant fight for themselves
lilly as soon as you get back
munir uncle will put
you on a bus to djibouti
refugees are flocking there because
they have a british consulate
but you shouldnt be there
more than a few weeks
the color of your skin will put
you at the head of the line
why
lilly why do you think
you are white
you can go to england
and be anything you want to be
you dont have
you dont have to be ethiopian
you dont even
have to be muslim

im not leaving
lilly
im going back to
nouria to wait for you
you have been seen
at the meetings
if im taken
they might come for you next
and if they find you with
nouria youll be putting her
and bourtoucan in danger too
last night in addis
the army executed
60 political prisoners
over 50 of them were
their own generals
i need to know youre
somewhere safe

leaving me before

this wont last long
there are too many
of us for them to fight
i promise as soon as i can
ill come find you
we have to go
lilly now
people died of starvation
in northern ethiopia
not long after civil unrest
resulting from
economic pressures
brought an end to emperor
haile selassie regime
and the military took over
now the same civilians who
helped bring about change
are being imprisoned without
charge tortured and executed
and the ruling military party
has virtually closed off
the country from
the outside world

to jostle for power

i was held in a prison
near the somali border
i was not there long before
a guard beat me in such a way
that when he finished
there was only darkness
i could no longer see
then the doctor came
he had been part of the resistance
to the military takeover
he too was a prisoner
he was tortured
but even so
he cared for all of us
he promised my blindness
would not last
you see
he did not lie
he was the best man
because of him
many of us were
spared further pain
do you know what
happened to him
a day came
when a guard
took many of us
into a courtyard
they told us we would
have a good show
counter-revolutionary
that what they called us
but then
they brought him out
the doctor
he would not die on his knees
lilly im going to get zema
what are you doing here
first drink
you managed to get
quite dehydrated
with a doctor in the next room
i might have to reconsider
my career choice
mm-mm keep going
there you go
now tell me
please
right
someone named senit
found you on the floor
outside your flat
she got your spare key
from someone named vertise
who then called mrs jahangir
who then called amina in canada
and she called the hospital
and tracked down
me
that means i must
have told senit
i believe you did lilly
so everyone knows
everyone knows
i see youve found some
new reading material
i never thanked you
not properly
for recommending
science fiction
for taking care of me
there no need
of course there is
well then i believe
i should thank you as well
for inspiring me to expand
my literary horizons
sufi poetry
so you see
it a
it a good deal all around
when i was seven years old
my parents took me to morocco
we went to a sufi shrine
at the edge of the sahara
they left me there
and they never came back
it wasnt until years later
that i found out what
happened to them
and even then all i was told
was that drugs were involved
and that they died together
i dont i dont
know what to say
it all right
i was happy there
and i was loved
i would have stayed
there forever if i could
of course i can call back
but it will be to speak
with your supervisor
lilly how much there is
to tell you about alberta
today i met
a woman in the market
we reached for
the same melon
she came here alone from chile
after her family was killed
during the military coup
she said she has put
down roots here
and in that moment
i knew i could do that too
and not just because i ended
up with the melon
we are branches from
the same tree my sister
we must plant ourselves
where we are
and know in our hearts
that we are home
