your decision to go
dr zalazny

if i came alone
are you taurence
you are a very
daring woman
your still being alive
seems to prove your point
dr alex zalazny
the lab
you have the code control
yes
door opens
prototype
the shell
the rebirth chamber
yes
there no access panel
the third level
of the program
the third level
of the program please
the operational
program
should answer
your question
i have a question
for you
yes doctor
it seems they disappeared
without any explanation
who
dr roberts

sorry to hear that
i am going to need
an assistant
ill help you
dr zalazny
there

your advice

of myself
hey chip
snapping neck

you are an addict
and your total effort in life
is to obtain money
to feed your habit
now youre launched
on a full-scale teen-age
crime wave of your very own
you feel let down
and tired
but more persuasion
a greater need to belong
and it isnt long
until you try again
you try new things
the hypnotics
as theyre called--
seconal or reds
nembutal or yellows
phenobarbital
and the stimulants
amphetamine dexedrine
and benzedrine or bennies
you begin to lose track
of your friends
because now you belong
to a group
a group that must move in
a veiled world of secrecy

who are you
i am your father
chandra
i dont have
a father
how can you
be my father
i made this program
so we could meet
when you would be
old enough to understand
but i dont
understand
you were born in the times
of the mad minds
it ended with my death
youre the last omega
chandra
omega
we were taken out
of the cities
and implanted
it was meant to turn us
into teachers
shamans
we were called a lot of things
and then we were brought
back to the cities
to become leaders
what cities
theyre all gone
you were implanted
at birth
and it was my hope
that one day you would
become our leader
who
who are the people
that brought me here
they are the protectors
they have been raised to
sacrifice their lives for you
well if youre
my father
who my mother
you are an omega now
it will take some time
but soon you will feel
the powers that lay dormant
tell me
about my mother
il est ne
le divin enfant
chante tous et bois
resonnez musette
il est ne
le divin enfant
chante

stay away from me

louez hautbois
resonnez musette
sniffs
il est ne
le divin enfant
chantons tous
son avenement
i believe doctor
you were to limit
your studies
to the medical
aspects of
prototype
youve known all along
what did you think
happened
to the medical
program
you think they
passed out of existence
like dinosaurs
unsuccessful implants
failure of
the omega interface
it all bullshit
isnt it taurence
bullshit
the program was
a failure doctor
ridiculous
the omegas did
successfully adapt
to their implants
their failure was in
the overriding
of the primary
programming directives
so the government
created prototype
to assassinate
the omegas
assassination
doctor
prototypes werent
designed as assassins
they were the next
step in cybernetics
total rebirth
00% cybernetically
integrated entities
it was
an assassination program
it was the logical
conclusion
to an experiment
that had gone
out of control
doctor
that was
over 20 years ago
yes doctor
a different time
a time youre not
familiar with
or able to judge
maybe youre right
taurence
but why would
the government
let me come here and re-create
another prototype
you came here
for medical
research doctor
your unsealing of
the prototype lab
will assist us
in the conclusion
of the program
it was intended to
the conclusion
of what program
what are you
talking about
omega doctor
there is one left
one that was
implanted at birth
one that i believe
remains inactivated
until now
you see doctor
we couldnt allow
the same mistake
to plague us again
am i going to get
out of here alive taurence
arent you being
a bit overly dramatic
dr zalazny
it like the stories
of the people
that hunted down the
nazis in the second
world war
history to most
except the hunters
dr t roberts
dr taurence roberts
it you isnt it
yes doctor
where are you going
home
where else
would i be going
my work
is completed here
good night doctor
uh yeah
good night
what are you
doing here
i said
what are you doing
what does it
look like im doing
it looks like
youre leaving
well are you
yes im leaving
did i do something
no
i have to go away with
some people for a while
why why
look
i cant stay here
all right
we cant pretend
were brother
and sister anymore
you understand
dont follow me
stupid bitch
the a0
or the a002 programs
will not operate
without the omega
shell program
can i leave
the suit
and return
to what i was
no
you will die
to live
i must eliminate
the omega signal
yes
why was i created
you were reborn
to carry out
the omega program hawkins
i am no longer
the same hawkins
it will take time
you will acclimate
to your environment
in the suit
one day you may be able
to live outside of it
it will not be
the same hawkins
that leaves
the suit
if i die will you
build another
yes
i will build another
30 years ago
the government
ended the program
and sealed the lab
dr zalazny research
has allowed me
to complete my work
yes
i understand
i
i am alone
we are all alone hawkins
no
no
no
aah
aah
you need me hawkins
no
back cracks
