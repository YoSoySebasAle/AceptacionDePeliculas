that the one
but if this were a score
what would it be
i dont know
great reality tv
kiss my bollocks big brother
high explosive
semtex maybe
christ it enough
to take down the whole building
where the hell is it
i guess were supposed
to figure that out
why the hell do you keep running
toward all the scary shit
who the hell is this guy
hey
hey
you wanna tell us
what youre doing here
same thing youre doing
id imagine
trying to get out of here alive
you tried to escape
gerry youre late
and i have a schedule to keep
youre cutting it awfully close
youve had months
have you ever known me
to let you down
this isnt exactly the plan
we signed up for
why you here gerry
because theyre worried
because it tonight
and because i wanna make damn
sure our investment is safe
is it
look for yourself
you know ive been
doing this a long time
and if there one thing
ive learned
it that people
are who they are
i look at this
and i wonder
what makes you think that theyre
going to do what you want them to do
well because they have
no choice
because they are
who they are
what this
im not the one who going to have
to pay if this doesnt work out
always nice to chat theo
lovely to see you too gerry
no thank you
anybody mind
i was out in the hallway
i was looking for a way out
all hell broke loose
you didnt feel like
coming out to say hello
oh
let just say im a bit shy
by nature
and i wanted to know
who i was dealing with first
you satisfied
entirely
what so funny
well you have to admire
the humor of this situation
i mean four thieves
locked up
and we havent even committed
a crime yet
thieves you know
ill have you know
im a contractor
of course you are my dear
now listen up kids
if you wanna know what going
on take a good look around you
were all players
experts in our field
get to the point
you wanna
know the point big guy
the point is were all
career criminals
and this is a four-man crew
the mechanic rough brawny
and you dear lady
graceful nimble
youre the b&e specialist
we called them cat burglars
back in my day
and that leaves you
you slick-fingered devil
the safe cracker
what does that make you
smart guy
i guess that makes me
the smart guy
so
anybody figure out what
were supposed to steal yet
you pricks did your homework
who are you
well ill start with
the more infamous first
boston museum
8th of march 990
nah
oh yes
the frames of the pictures
are still hanging on the wall
no way that was you
grayson bishop
and it most certainly was
in fact i still have
one of the van goghs
hidden in a basement
somewhere to prove it
so an old-school
master thief huh
maybe youre the one
behind this
teach yourself a few new tricks
i seriously doubt there
is anything you can teach me
besides do you think
i would try to blow myself up
this doesnt make any sense
why us
well im the very best
at what i do
and im assuming you are
as well
otherwise i would be
completely insulted
it would be easier
to hire us no
maybe
or maybe it someone who knows
that we would never work for them
or better yet
maybe it someone
that wanted us fucked over
like who
do you got any enemies kid
because believe me
i have a long list
dont call me kid
you old fogy
you make me glad im an orphan
and an angry one at that
so what are we gonna do
we live or we die
doesnt sound like
much of a choice to me
excellent conclusion dear
harris
it so good to see you
what this
our border guy he reliable
right
he is
weve used him before
you paid top dollar
he was instructed to turn off the
cameras was he not
yes sir
by you
yes i told him
ill fix it
there is no fixing it harris
ill ill figure it out
ill talk
ill talk to him
you weigh
about 75 kilograms
is that right
yeah
shouldnt take too long
and please
just dont fight it
it easier that way
see harris every piece
has a purpose
and every move has a meaning
and if you cant follow
the rules
everyone loses
youre in charge now
and be careful decontaminating
we have to gain access
though the main elevator
then we have to open a security
door with an electronic lock
next we navigate a tunnel
secured by motion sensors
then unbreakable
tempered glass
once through
it the vault room
which brings us to the custom
970s mosler
even if you could do all that
which you cant
what your exit plan
i was thinking id just walk
out the front door
it kinda the point of
not setting off any alarms
that much security
what in the vault
gold
bonds
it diamonds
what
it diamonds
and it all started right here
john d rockefeller
son of a con artist
became one of
the wealthiest men in america
so he had diamonds
a lot of diamonds
hidden assets
from the government i assume
anyway theyre all stored
right here in the museum
at least for now
i mean they move em around
from time to time
it was last rumored
that they were in italy
florence to be exact
how do you know
it about the mosler
you see
it a bit of a legend
in certain rarefied circles
it never been cracked yet
though it has been tried
sounds like a bunch of bullshit
could be but our captor
believes it true
so then what do they
want us to do
draw them a map
theyve already got
the blueprints
they want us to steal it
no
they want us to pretend to
how that
for a slice of humble pie
it right this way guys
and why should i
trust you pops
maybe youre walking us
to an early grave
this whole place is a grave
you shouldnt trust me
i dont trust you
i mean
after all we are criminals
youre a real ray of
sunshine you know that
and youre a shoe size
passing for an iq dear boy
there it is
would you look at that
just like in the blueprints
they built a replica of
the museum
they want us to
practice the heist
theyre gonna watch our every
move and when were done
boom
and then
and then someone else
follows in our footsteps
and we are all okay with this
do you have any other options
shit
well i thought you were
the safe cracker
this isnt a safe it
a computer
no it not it a puzzle
it a henderson digital lock
it releases
the way it works it has four
bolts from the door to the frame
then we can use a gun
that unnecessary
oh yeah why is that
because this particular lock
depends on a person a person who
comes up with a four-digit pin
yeah well that like
a million different
combinations
permutations
and it 9999
give or take a fraction or two
but you see our advantage is
that henderson keypads
use silicone with
positive printing
what the hell does that mean
what that means is that
the surface clings
to the oil
from our fingertips
move over kid
youre blocking the view
all right
ah this should be easy
twenty-four permutations
voila
there it is
how did you know
the combo
i dont know the combo
i know people
and i know my keypads
yeah but the keypad at the museum
is not gonna be the same code
this is just a replica
well then it a good thing well
all be dead and it wont be us
actually the heist then
isnt it
im assuming the real security
system wont have an off switch
that where it is
that where they hid the bomb
they found the replica
theyre behind
what about grayson
played out just like
you said it would
he got everyone on task
and he cracked
the security code quick
and now
it showtime
i dont know why you
brought the whole tool shed
there nothing in there
to protect from lightsabers
what she on about
i can do this
do what
we need to redirect the laser
did you bring the mirror
and see
now it in front of me
your turn
shouldnt we be
motivating the others
i was just
looking for a weak spot
it hard work
leading a crew
im not leading anything
see it not just
about skills
it about personalities
you know mag
she strong and silent
bruised
but very reliable
and rowan
he a joker
but he knows his shite
and me
im the wiseass wise man
what about you kate
what are you gonna
bring to the party
that gonna take us
to the promised land
im not taking you anywhere
i dont know you
i know you
should we cut the crap
excuse me
your bingham paxton
granddaughter
corsica cabal
you dont know what
youre talking about
spoken like a career criminal
there no point
in us lying to each other
were all in this together
you mind me asking
how did he get pinched
your grandfather was a brilliant
man and i was an admirer
it was a job
italy
i was trying to crack a vault
and i took too long
police were supposed to be
diverted but
i escaped with the rest
of the crew
my grandfather
took the fall
what kind of vault
what kind of vault kate
it important
a mosler
a mosler
this was your grandfather
final score
he died in prison
didnt he
and it all your fault
you think you have
the answers to everything
listen to me
we do not have to do
what they want us to do
you and i could figure
something out
we dont have
to play their game
i dont have to play
your game either
i dont think you understand
the variables here
were pawns
were pawns in something
much bigger
hey
were ready
rowan got an idea
for the glass
all right here the news
prorated 0-hour
tempered glass
steel can be cut
stone can be broken
but this
this some new age
super-human shit
it the kind insurance
companies love to see
now the vibration might be able to
undermine the strength of the glass
you said it would break
there not even a dent
no
what i said was
we might be able to weaken it
we need a minute
hell with this
ill join you
i thought you were supposed
to be some kind of an expert
christ will you back off
are all girls in arizona
this mean or is it just you
im from mexico
oh lemme guess
cancun acapulco
hone your skills breaking into
rich tourist hotel rooms
sinaloa
oh cartel country
no wonder youre so friendly
but i was raised
in the magical crew
so all my friends
are dead
fair enough
this is not about me
this is about kate
i overheard her
talking to grayson
she cabal
you dont say
granddaughter of the great bingham himself
hmm
and i do not trust her
well
trust is hard to come by
these days
i think that maybe
we should keep an eye on her
well im keeping
an eye on everyone
youre an idiot
if you are not scared of them
you should be
they could be behind this
and we have the cub in our den
and what exactly do you
want me to do about it
i wanna show them
that we are serious
come up with anything
pass me the uh splicer there
so what did you
and grayson talk about
a score you know
what else
play poker
no
well you should
youre a great liar
what
quick
what the hell
youre working with them
who
the cabal
i dont know
what youre talking about
i overheard you
talking to grayson
youre cabal
and they are behind this
why would they do that
they are the only ones with
the resources for this no
youre making a mistake
we need each other
if were gonna get outta here
i think
that maybe you need us
and they need you
in one piece
and maybe if theyre
worried about you
theyll pop open the door
only if they know that we are serious
what the hell is going on here
nothing important
just a small hiccup
in group trust
dont be absurd
what are you doing
take it easy old boy
we need her
she cabal
so what
she was cabal
she not anymore
believe me
when i tell you this
she is not the one
responsible for all this
how do you know
she would never we caught dead
working for scum
the likes of theodore thurlo iii
who the hell is
theodore thurlo iii
i mean did we get kidnapped
by a knight of the round table

indirectly he has
a deep connection to you

i understand that theo used to recruit
all the urchins on the streets of mexico
only he didnt treat em
so good

and then betrayed
and left for dead

art heist in history
show some goddamn respect
gerry
please dont try to tell me
that this was part of the plan
it wasnt entirely unexpected
i have no idea what that means
what it means gerry
is that he fulfilled his role
and sometimes you have
to trade a pawn
to put your pieces
in the right position
just remember who
youre playing with
no more sacrifices
get me those diamonds
grayson went at it alone
and look wat happened to him

the irish system
for young lads without
a family isnt all that great
im sorry

tungsten carbide
cobalt bollocks
nothing
it got an extremely high
surface compression
stress resistance
at least a nine on the mohs scale

im here
elevator is on its way
left you a present inside
mag you there
i cannot find theo crew
keep looking
rowan im out
you ready to go
ah
mag is that you
who the fuck
rowan what the hell
are you doing
rowan
mag can you hear me
get in
give me the diamonds kate
oh i dont have them
on me
you never leave
the scene with a score
my grandfather
taught me that much
im not holding a carrot
if you kill me
your diamonds will be gone
i promise you that
so you dont care
about your own life
what about rowan
i just met rowan today
what makes
you think i care
because i know you kate
it why i picked you
it why i picked all of you
it why i allowed
you to escape
you knew wed escape
of course
but you tried to kill us
that was motivation
but the other team
there is no other team kate
just you every move you made
every action you took
you did it because i planned it
and i wanted it that way
you were pawns in
is this another
chess thing again
because i should mention
im more of a monopoly girl
thimble
top hat
i want the diamonds kate
you kill me you have nothing
i have rowan
and we can make him
talk eventually
but rowan doesnt know
where the diamonds are
it just me
and if i die
your diamonds are gone
that would be a mistake
for you
see there no way that you
financed this whole thing yourself
so im betting you had
a buyer
a buyer who fronted you
enough for this whole operation
the replica and all
and im gonna bet
that this buyer
isnt the type to just write
this off if you dont deliver
so am i close
the diamonds kate
if i dont tell you
where they are
no matter
what happens to me
theyll come for you
are there dice in chess
oh very well
kei call vince
let give kate a little taste
of what about to come
is there a problem kei
oh jesus christ
mag are you there
mag can you hear me
im heading to the rendezvous point
mag
what happened
yeah we gotta go
let go
mag what the hell
are you doing
im sorry kate
you dont have to do this
it not too late
it is for me
how much is he paying you
i didnt pay her
i raised her
kate let just stop this
all right
make it easy on ourselves
and just tell me
where the diamonds are
the diamonds are the only
thing keeping me alive
the diamonds are gonna
get you killed
and is it worth it
no
but making you fail
that something i would die for
shoot her
we should just take her and go
shell talk eventually
you know
i dont think she will
we need to reassess
and we need to clear the board
i dont want any loose ends
shoot her
no we need
to get out of here now
this is not the time
or the place for this
what did you say
im just saying that
i think that there is
im sorry
for what
dont listen to her
for what he did to you
for what he made you become
magdalena
do it

do it
i love you like a daughter

like a daughter
im sorry

what did you do to her
what did i do to her
i saved her okay
her family dead
she was on the streets
and i gave her everything
what do you care
you turned her into a weapon
i saved her from
becoming a corpse
and you made me
shoot her
i really didnt want it
to end this way kate
