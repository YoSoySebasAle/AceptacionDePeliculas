what are you some kind of
survivalist or something

eight years old
that boy will be
punished for his crime

oh rocky
thunder
looks like one of your
men stopped the target here
but couldnt finish the job
last report had them tracking
him north by northwest
then the radio went dead
let fan out
begin a hard target
search of the area
if you make contact with
the target do not engage
i repeat do not engage
i do not want this man
to escape our perimeter
you notify me and the
rest of the squad
move out
you got any more men
left alive out there
you better call em in
why
theyre just gonna
be in our way
my men are highly
skilled professionals
but if they were you
wouldnt have called me
im not going to stand
here and argue with you
good
either call them in or
suffer the consequences
what do you mean
ive turned
these wolves loose
theyre going to shoot
anything that moves out there
and ask questions later
michaels
yes sir
i need to talk to
you for a minute
look ive been given full
clearance to kill this target
but there a substantial
cash bonus in it for all of us
if we can bring him back alive
now i turn you
loose on this guy
and he doesnt stand a chance
that going to cost me money
now i need to know
can you follow orders
of course i can sir
you know i--
dont bullshit me michaels
between roth goin soft on
me and you killin everything
in sight im
starting to think i
got in the wrong line of work
now i do not want to
mess up this mission
so i need to know
can you obey orders
sir i am a soldier
i can follow orders
yeah just like you
did with kozinski
sir i apologize
for the incident ok
i had no idea the
guy was so fragile
he just kind of came apart
i overestimated his
tolerance for pain
no what you did
was underestimate
your own strength
now i do not want to
mess up this mission
so i need to know
unequivocally
can you obey orders
yeah
good
you damn well better
get the hell outta here
crying
grace
youre gonna have
to leave this place
and where will we go
we are gonna separate
theyre after me
they will kill you
why
who are these people
why would they kill me
because youve seen me
because ive seen you
what the fuck does that mean
i dont know
youve got a very
selective memory
grace it not my memory
i see things in flashes
i know i was their prisoner
but i dont know why
but if you dont
even know who they are
or why they are after
you how do you even
know there going to be more
do you want to stay here and
take the chance that im wrong
no
i dont
ok
let go
yeah that a copy
sir
yes mitchell
you know if roth
poses a problem
id be more than happy
to take care of him
i dont think that will
be necessary mitchell
besides id rather you
concentrate on the target
have i ever let you down
no you havent
in fact mitchell youve
got the three qualities
i admire most in a soldier
loyalty expertise
and thirst for blood
well now you cant be a
great fighter unless youve got
something worth fightin for
thunder

ok
phone ringing
general gardner here
general beckett i have denton
and his crew on the case
the initial problem should
be solved within the hour
but i think this
entire incident has
exposed how precarious our
position is with this project
i think we need to make
an immediate correction
in our policy
what do you suggest
i feel we should
terminate this operation
before it gets out of control
weve got $6 billion
wrapped into your operation
there general
and now you want us
to just let everything
go right down the
drain because you lost
your handle on the situation
is that it
if we cut our losses now we
can walk away with our careers
intact
all right and what is your
suggested course of action
oh an industrial
accident of some sort
an explosion something big
wipe out the plant and
everyone and everything in it
well i will uh give
that some thought general
meanwhile do nothing
retrieve the soldier
and you wait for further
instructions understand
yes sir
he gone quite insane
youll have to intercede
how long will it take
you to get to the plant
i can take an f4 be
there before sunrise
all right
general beckett
he a patriot one
of this country great heroes
i want you to show him
the proper respect
ill handle the matter
with velvet gloves
all right
oh caulder
