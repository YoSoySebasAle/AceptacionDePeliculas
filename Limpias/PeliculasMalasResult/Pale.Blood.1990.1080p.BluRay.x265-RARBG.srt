police move aside
this is frazer kelly im
reporting live from metropolis
a melrose avenue lingerie
boutique and a scene
of yet another grizzly
feast by the vampire killer
less than 0 minutes ago
i received an anonymous tip
at the channel 3 news desk
the shocking tip told me
that one of the mannequins
was not a mannequin
at all but a corpse
and very likely the vampire
killer victim number three
weve arrived here
before the police
to bring you this exclusive
you must be michael fury
im lori from the agency
the one youve been
corresponding with
im really sorry i couldnt
meet you at the airport
i got a hot tip from
a friend of mine
and i came right down here
looks like another one
you are michael
fury arent you
the one who been
paying me to investigate
these so-called vampire murders
that right
you had me scared
there for a minute
it just like the others
someone is using
sharpened incisors
to bite into the
necks of the victims
and all the blood
is drained out
but there no evidence
there never any evidence
and they appear no closer
to solving the hideous crimes
i see
now here tonight
another victim
this is frazer kelly
for channel 3 news
now back to the studio
well my car is right here
why dont i take
you to your condo
that really freaked me out
i dont even wanna eat dinner
i tell you it
makes me worry about you
walking out here by yourself
dont think im
gonna work here anymore
yes maam
fill it up please
and the victims are apparently
killed someplace else
maybe the same place every time
and then theyre brought to
the place where theyre found
and the rest you
know from my letters
you want a coke
anyway i found a great place
for you while youre here
it a brand new condo
it unfurnished
that what you
wanted isnt it
have you seen it
i spent a whole
day and night there
really
well after all
our correspondence
i kinda felt like i knew you
my letters were very
business-like as i recall
i know but i
like to read between the lines
i made up a whole
personality for you
i sat in your place
wondering how youd
decorate the living room
which bedroom youd
pick to sleep in
what your bed would look
like things like that
what do you do in the agency
research assistant
on the graveyard shift
all those summaries you sent
me were unusually thorough
well im very
interested in the occult
not just vampires
a lot of things
actually im kind of a
joke around the office
so when your first letter
came in they kinda thought
they thought we
deserved each other
ive read all the vampire books
seen just about every
vampire movie ever made
wouldnt it be incredible
if there really was
a vampire behind all this
you know a lot of people
think it possible
because of the puncture
wounds in the throats
of the three dead girls
well you saw them
they looked just like fang
bites and everyone knows
vampires must kill to live
i think people do
see too many movies
why must what you
call a vampire kill
why couldnt they take
just enough blood to exist
and let their quarry live
quarry
that an interesting
way of putting it
im tired
id like to get
to the apartment
michael
what are you really looking for
im looking for a killer
nice slow pan from
billy blue shirt
and hold beat
beat
now nice slow zoom real
slow real slow yeah
that good
good
yeah
now pull back real
slow yes real slow
hell somethin moved
down there i know it did
looking for something
jesus christ man you
scared the shit outta me
are you a cop
are you a cop
something happening down there
no nothing
happening down there
why are you filming nothing
look first of
all this isnt film
it videotape all right
second of all im an artist
i dont have to explain to you
or anybody else in the
world what im doing
huh art
but there nothing
happening down there
youd be surprised what you
can do in the editing process
bam
what your video about
it a goddamn
documentary all right
about the murders
yeah
about the murders
i mean why else
would i be here
at this hour freezing
my ass off huh
and listen dont try and
rip me off all right
that happened to me once before
and i didnt take kindly
to it you understand
first they steal your
ideas then your creativity
and then goes your bank book
and i tell you wha
jesus
now was that strange
or was that strange
oh man
i dont know
jesus christ
get a hold of yourself man
just get a hold of yourself
hey watch out
geez
van
not tonight
van honey youre

just tell van i lost
my nerves okay
oh come on dont be
a chickenshit please
i am chickenshit
and ill wait for you
at drac tonight okay
bye baby
j right from the beginning
j clouds begin to pour
j but we were all too young to
fear the power of the storm
j if we had lost our
hopes we knew our
j dreams would still remain
j because nothing is impossible
j nothing burns like
fire in the rain
j fire in the rain
j thunder rocked the mountains
j lightning cracked the sky
j no one that survived this
hurricane would dare deny
j if fate had played it part
j there would be
nothing to explain
j what was once a
very tiny spark
j is now a blazing
fire in the rain
j fire in the rain
j rain
j now see the sun coming out
j from behind the darkest clouds
j say goodbye to the storm
j as it moves across the sky
j see the fire burning brighter
than it ever has before
j moving close touch the flame
j burn like fire in the rain
j fire in the rain
j fire in the rain
j fire in the rain
j ive heard that
voice before somehow
j cant imagine
j it speaks words without
knowing what they mean
j and ive seen that
face before somewhere
j cant remember
j it seems as if it
happened in a dream
j i laugh and now you know
j that some things never change
j i laugh again because
to me you seem
j so strange
j so strange
j so strange
michael
i took a chance
you might still be awake
come onin
i do my best work at night
do you want a glass of wine
no thank you
your last letter said you were
arranging a list of suspects
i have friends in high places
well a couple anyway
there over 2000
names on that list
amazing
what a city
only the first
they have records of kinkiness
la you know
any conclusions
none that youd
be interested in
try me
not one of them is a vampire
youre right
that doesnt interest me
but youre the believer
what makes you so sure
none of them have
been seen in daylight
oh yes
the lore
cant be seen in mirrors
afraid of garlic
all those sorts of things
is that a smile
youre really obsessed
with this vampire business
put my personal beliefs
aside for a second
i also happen to be a
damn good investigator
and rule one is you work from
a theory that fits the facts
now the facts are weve
got a killer running around
who drains his victim of blood
now what are the possibilities
who drinks blood
nobody said the
killer drinks the blood
puncture wounds
just kinkiness
no
rule two is you dont alter
the facts to fit the theory
the facts say vampire
look the victims bodies
are still at the morgue right
as far as i know
well doesnt legend say
that the vampire
victim becomes a vampire
that depends
look the dead are dead no
matter how they got that way
dead and that all
do you know that some
people believe that the spirit
hangs around for a while
that if you can get
in touch with them
they can tell you things
i suppose
youre one of the people
who believes that
actually i am trying
to get in touch with them
maybe one of the murder
victims can tell me something
i need someone to
investigate the living
let stick to reality
there are all kinds of reality
good luck
let me know when the
spirits talk to you
youre funny huh
i didnt mean to
make fun of you
but you must admit
it a little bizarre
that okay it was worth it
just to see you smile again
i should go
really so soon
why dont you stay and watch
some of this movie with me
more vampires
no thank you
when will i see you again

the afternoon commute home tom
pauline southbound
55 there an accident
in the number two lane
hot new group durango 95
the darkness is his domain
to be seen yet unseen
is no difficult task
for one such as he
the shadow you thought
you did not see
flitting against the walls
of your darkened bedroom
it was there
the sound you could almost hear
his voice in another form
yes
the hiss of distant snakes
though his power over beasts
is great it is not limitless
no sadly no
certain animals do not obey him
indeed would hurt
him if they could
small dogs
especially pekingese
dachshunds cocker spaniels
they are more to my liking
the blood is the life
in truth his blood
is pale as water
pale blood
pale blood
hey lori
are you okay
yeah
let go sit down
though his powers are
greater than his limitations
the night only is his
yet how completely he
dominates the darkness
he can become shadow itself
and flow through windows
like water through cloth
to be heard yet unheard
his voice in another form
yes the hiss of hi jenny
hi
distant snakes
the blood is the life
