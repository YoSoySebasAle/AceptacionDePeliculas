you through my letters

would ever meet you

good morning
it is a beautifulclear july day in grenada
the year 936
the phalangists occupy thecity but the mood is mild
it is on that day that fredericogarcia lorca poet playwright
artist is executed
and his body is
thrown into an unmarked grave
he was 38
there are those who look
upon the death of lorca
as a much greater symbol ofthe conflict of that region
in general not the
political conflict
but the deeper chasm
towards utter brutality
that lies in man
the  wrote
one body with littleblood but with two hearts
is that to say that there isnot enough blood in the body
to keep two heart alive or
that two hearts can turn
thin veins into a
nurturing river
we have to keep an eye on thoseopposing hearts because--
yes come in
dr treanda
nicos sit down
ill be right with you
my heart is in the east buti am at the edge of the west
