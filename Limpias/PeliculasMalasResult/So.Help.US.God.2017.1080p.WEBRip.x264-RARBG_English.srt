i was once young too and
in love with your father
so i understand
i write letters to
him almost everyday
but suddenly he
doesnt write me back
sometimes boys
can be pretty dumb
they can do stupid things
maybe he met
someone over there
well maybe he has
but i would lay odds
she nowhere near as
beautiful and as smart as you
