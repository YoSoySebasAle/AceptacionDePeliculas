satellite
measurements of the mesopotamian
basin show that radioactivity
levels remain high
and with the oil spills in
arabia still burning the world
total reserves of petroleum
have dropped even lower
making gasoline all
but unobtainable
except for governmental agencies
food riots have continued
into the third day
and marshal law was declared
for all of greater detroit
army units and the national
guard have been called in
to restore order and the
military commander from michigan
that all looters will
be shot on sight
the migration into the
countryside continues
and once-peaceful rural areas
have become a battlefield
as roaming bands of what
can only be called bandits
raid farming communities for
well-hidden supplies of fuel
as well as food and ammunition
the most notorious of these
groups is lead by the renegade
army colonel straker who
travels in a heavily-armored
vehicle and has so far eluded
all attempts for capture
with most of the law enforcement
agencies fully committed
to the cities it looks like
his mobile reign of terror
will continue for some time
hey you hear that

hunter
damn
i wanted to show him
that new shortwave
ive been workin on

radio mecca prayers mostly
damn
my name rusty
im corlie hunter
told me to ask for you
youre lookin to join are ya
yes
good
good well come on in
ill show you around
hunter brought us
some of our best people
he sure gets around a lot
yeah were always shorthanded
here even in the winter
but there plenty to
eat if you like turnips
yeah
it a strict democracy
a little old-fashioned
but it seems to work
that my workshop
right over there
over there that the main
dome wall that where youll
be sleepin till we can fix
you up a place of your own
well that is if they
vote to let you in
but that shouldnt be too much
of a problem because women
are we have a lot of
bachelors are you single
yeah very
good good well dont just
be really nice to everybody
but not too nice to any one
person until after the vote
if you get my drift
okay
rusty where are you taking her
this is corlie
im just showing her
you could be carrying
her with a wound like that
wound
come on honey
dont you worry ill have
you fixed up right as rain
there was no doubt that it
was a perfect fit and then
before the two ugly sisters
could show their surprise
cinderella fairy godmother
appeared before them
and with a wave
of her magic wand
she changed cinderella
ragged dress
into a gown of golden silk
which made the ugly sisters
gasp in jealous anger
go now the fairy
said to cinderella
the coach outside will
carry you to your prince
so cinderella found true
happiness at last with her prince
and the very next day
they were married
and lived happily
ever afterwards
the end
