i designed for them
i spoke to a woman on the phone
and she has a victorian
cat o nine tails for sale
awesome
she said that we could come by
and take a look at it
well you know
that theyre very rare
so if it real i mean id pick it up
im not holding back
you wanna go take a look
oh yeah absolutely
hey im off to the bank
wait wait wait wait no
you have to take your daughter shayna out
to buy her dress for this dance
youve been avoiding it and
you cant avoid it any longer
for me i collect torture stuff
going to a mall is torture
she wants her daddy there
she wants her daddy wallet
but you have to go
tell you what if im
going youre coming too
all right
but first i need to check out
these cat o nine tails
oh man what the hell
welcome to the playroom
i mean this is wild
check out these tables
okay hey so youre a dominatrix right
retired which is why
im selling this stuff
and i thought youd like these things
that are rather dark
what the story with this table
it looks pretty old
this is a 950 operating table
people died on this thing side
rails held the arm pieces -
it sickening
and this one right here
i dont know it just me
but im getting a deeper
darker vibe from this one
this came from a turn of
the century women asylum
a psychiatric hospital
like a sanatorium
women were tied to this thing
no way
if you woke up with a headache
your husband could send you there
for as long as he wanted back then
you know at the risk
of sounding old fashioned
i kind of like that idea
just kidding just kidding
this is great
i came for something else
stef tells me you have an
800 prison flogging whip
can i see it
yeah
whoa that awesome
that is incredible and it ancient
it is a victorian-era british
prison cat o nine tails
for beating the convicts with
do you know how rare these things are
they were often destroyed
because the prison system
didnt want to admit
that theyd used stuff like this
yeah youre correct
this cat o nine tails
flogging whip is amazing
it a staggering find
hey rob come here for a second
what
you often wonder how
prisoners felt back in the day
when were researching this stuff
yeah
well youre gonna get to find out
youre in good hands
youre so evil so evil
this is gonna be great
yes i am and im going to
be loving every minute of this
i really dont know about this guys
i do
oh jesus
no more coffee stops
oh jesus
now i know what it feels like
oh nice
right on i enjoyed every second of that
ive gotta get down to business here
what your price
id like $600
$600
oh man i was thinking somewhere
along the lines of $ 200
im gonna put this in an exhibit
that im gonna put together
and assemble and tour
of ancient justice instruments
i have to keep the cost down
because i have to make the money back
by admissions as this tours
but if you own it a long time
and exhibit it often then
you will make money on it
$600
nah you know what
im really stuck at 2
im stuck at 6
really
you know what i hate to
say this because i likely
will never see another one in my life
but you remain the custodian of the whip
you sure
yeah ive gotta stay at 2 thanks
carolyn ran a really hard bargain
so i took a big chance
and walked for the door
wait
youll take 2
no 3
im not gonna quibble over $00
ive been after one for ten years
done $ 300 thank you so much
nice nice
that awesome
im really satisfied with
the price i paid for this
and truth be told i probably
would have paid a lot more
the last authentic one of
these i saw selling at auction
went for over $4000
today was a great day
stewart mclaughlin in a prison officer
from wandsworth prison in the uk
he also the author of
several prison-related books
and actually i got very
lucky that he was in town
and made time to meet with me
when i inquired what the oral history was
that this is a british
prison flogging whip
that was used on inmates for
infractions or punishments
what do you think
looking at this piece
it not like any official
cat o nine tails that ive seen
in any archive or museum
it certainly not
something that would have
been used in a british prison
in pre-870
the handle itself is way too short
as bit by bit stewart stripped away
everything i believed about this whip
i mean the measurements were wrong
the history was wrong
it wasnt a prison cat
i mean i started to feel
like a bit of an ****
id paid money on this my own
research my own knowledge
it wasnt right in this case
but i know in
british in penal colonies
around the globe
the smaller version of the cat
certainly serves as the boy cat
something like this
could be something like this
i think youre probably
looking at something
which may even be mid-800
stewart pointed out that
this was actually used
for flogging prisoners
maybe not in british prisons
but in penal colonies
this is still a rare piece
and it possibly earlier
than i ever thought it was
hey steve
yeah
youre gonna be happy
oh
i got your invite to
the annual invite-only
dark relics private auction
yes once a year i wait for this
and i printed you out pictures
awesome
knee restraints
oh i like that
spiked arm bracer to cleave
in someone face with
look at that
oh man that looks
like an antique coffin
it looks victorian maybe
yeah id say about the 800
that is awesome
you know what
id look great in here if i could win it
because you know who else go after this
oh money bags
yep it always the way
if i want it you know it gonna happen
yeah anything you want hell want
yeah
this guy i call money bags
he a new guy on the scene
collects the same stuff that
i do and has got deep pockets
he really pisses me off
and he has more money than you so
it true
youre fired
i want to know if this cat o nine tails
was ever used on human beings
so im having a blood test done on it
interesting
thing about blood stains
is that often at a crime scene
theyre washed out or bleached
and thankfully these
chemiluminescence agents
they allow us to see what is not there
would you mind turning
off the light please
no certainly
thank you
awesome
finger crossed here we go
okay
there it is saw it
you see it
wow
check it out and over there too
and look at the one
strand it dripping down
in three drops
it lighting up a like a neon sing
it is
look at that; it insane
now we just have to find
out if it human blood
can we do that next
yes that the next
test were gonna do
okay
this is the moment of truth i mean
that was a lot of blood
man this is awesome
we always believed this
was a flogging whip
for human beings and this
could be it right here
im gonna put my sample with blood on it
in the container
okay
and once again snap it off
close it back up again
shake it all up
finger crossed
one line is the control
one line is the control
and second line is
second line to
see if it human or not
what do you see
two blue lines
that amazing
this was used to draw blood
yes
that incredible
wow thank you so much
this cat o nine tails tested
positive for human blood
and that amazing
but i still dont know
where it was used and when
im gonna take it to another expert
but first my 3-year
old daughter is going
to her first major
school dance with a boy
im not exactly excited
to be here dress shopping
with her but it gotta be done
one-hundred and 50 200 bucks
this one i love
ta-da
how about this
it like 00 bucks;
it got good coverage
this is nice
no
look at how short the skirt is
no way
whoa sexy
wrong word change
now that is super
it horrible it
ugly it granny style
it elegant
it fun shopping with my dad
cause he pays for everything
but at the same time it annoying
dad youre embarrassing
why dont you just go
i could hunt for dark
artifacts and torture instruments
all day but looking at
dresses forget about it
just go
nothing skimpy no leopard-skin
trust me trust me
it on you see ya
bye
the day ive been
waiting for is finally here
the preview of objects from
the dark artifacts auction
i mean it one thing to
see pictures of these things
but to see them in person it amazing
hey hey hey hey hey
that amazing eh
check it out
that ive gotta have
check this out
this is so rare
it an actual hangman hood
it made out of leather
why is it so rare
because they disposed them
nobody wanted them
no way
bad luck man
the man that looked through
that took your life
that could go through the roof though
if people here realize what
that is the way i realize it
it could go really high
gotta have it
okay
it a really competitive business
you have to make a plan in
advance and stick to it
so do you want everything
id like it all but
there a few pieces
in particular that i want
one is the coffin and the other one is
that executioner hood
because that piece is so rare
think of how cool that coffin
would look in that corner
right behind my desk
im really excited about
this upcoming auction
but first i want to meet
with one more whip expert
to see if i can finally get to the bottom
of where and when this cat
o nine tails whip was used
hey peter
hey im an expert because of 50 years
of collecting reading
and writing about whips
you know i noticed
you brought a big bag with you
im hoping there more
than clothes in it
no i brought you some
whips from my collection
of 000 whips
awesome whoa
some stems from the
peter frisk collection
oh my god
that looks viscous
it is actually a rhino-hide
it from the belly of a rhino
could you imagine getting hit with this
and that what called a sjambok
it from south africa
it probably about 00 years old
that was used on people
that was used on people
this one here is a cossak
whip from the 9th century
a true cossak whip
a true cossak whip
it meant to be used for
horseback and cossak riding
in the russian army would
have carried a whip like that
probably an officer
this has caught my
attention immediately
this is awesome
what that
this is bone
it is bone and carved stone
and there a knife in the handle
check it out
would this be for stabbing
was this like a weapon
it might be for eating
your dinner actually
really like this
it very rare; it
should be in a museum
should be well it is
yours
yeah mine
that right
seeing your expertise and
your incredible collection
we came to the right guy
i mean i imagine there
nobody on the earth
that likely knows more
about whips than you
this cat o nine tails tested
positive for human blood
and that amazing but i still dont know
where it was used and when
yeah this is a fascinating whip
there is wear on them and age patina
im also looking at
the work of the joining
and the style of those is 9th-century
i have seen australian
convicts flogging whips
from the 9th century that resemble this
now i would add another possibility
okay
it also
resembles a photo post card
from the convict ship success
the success was the most famous
and notorious prison ship of all time
and when she retired they toured her
from port-to-port around the world
showing people the horrors
of the british penal system
this sticker is very very important
it a collection number
which appears to confirm
that it either in a museum on the ship
or somewhere else
my theory is that is was on display
set up in the convict ship success
everything consistent
it all fits in with success
this is killing me
i dont mean to interrupt you i have to
what it worth
it worth a lot of money
if it can be proved to be from success
it should be in the range
of possibly $0000
0000 bucks
even a 800 punishment
whip used on convicts
if we couldnt nail down
the ship certainly
even if you couldnt nail that down
it still worth three or four thousand
oh man this is great
so you have
a very valuable item
peter gave me some amazing
information about this whip
and now armed with that i know
that if i ever want to sell this thing
i could more than triple my money
wow
take good care of it
oh i will and you know what
if i ever decide to get rid of it
itll go to your collection
id buy it from you but
i know you wouldnt sell
not yet

by to take my daughter
to her first dance
you must be mr santini
this hat
respect
tell me a bit about yourself
do you collect anything
um no
i do i collect ancient torture devices
this thing here was called a face puller
it went right over someone face
and theyd pull the
face right off a person
isnt that awesome
you know when you shake a
man hand it a sacred bond
but back in the day they had this
if you broke your word like for instance
what time you get home at night
theyd crush your fingers
between those plates
do you agree that promises
are very important
yes
yeah that good you know
this thing here check it out
it got these spikes on the inside
first theyd take a person hat off
so this could fit over top of the head
see all these sharp points
theyd twist the handle and the entire top
of the person head would disconnect
awe sweet
oh my god where the limo
so much better than a limo
i think this is your limo
this is your ride kids
she gonna kill you
