because right now my
consciousness
is being violently penetrated by
wisdom genitals
okay well im heading out
just wanted to let you know
mr whitman is arriving soon
susan asked to make sure someone
was there to greet him
well i think mr whitman needs to greet
himself first if you know what mean
just dont piss him off
or susan i guess
whatever you
guys are weird
adios santiago
adios stacey have a wonderful evening
goodnight stacey
steven i need to speak to you
ah what up alan
i examined the employee log in
human resources
and there no information about
your pending promotion
oh yeah
it happened super last minute so
probably hasnt been updated yet
i checked with payroll and there no start
paperwork submitted for the wage increase
i actually agreed to maintain my
bellman rate
until i have sufficiently trained
our newest bellman hire josh
whom youve met
yes joshua met i have
great
but there a different
insurance
which covers management
and the paperwork for that
hasnt been submitted yet either
well yes
that because since weve employed
the new cashless tipping app bravo
we also implemented a new
paperless paper app
called paper
that cant be
i would know if there was some new
app that we were supposed to have
it brand new super new
literally just happened
like we
guys were talking about it
it getting launched
i just got a text about it in
the old palm pilot
so you know so that that
you know what alan
this seems like there still a lot
of information to be picked up on
so im gonna talk
im going to go find to brad
about
what would brad know
he just a common bellman
oh wow
alan how dare you
im right here
brad is one of our top employees
and actually probably in line
to replace me as bell captain
really
you know what yeah i think so
when my promotion is
complete
congratulations again on your promotion
thank you so much
im going to go talk to susan
great tell her i said hi
tell her we said what up
im sorry i got stuck all
right these guys are worthless
worth is only measured less by the man who
values less worth than what he actually worth
thus worthlessness cannot be worth
less than what it is worthless
okay if alan talks to susan
he going to know there no promotion
and were gonna be screwed
what are you doing
this is ops for alan
okay go for alan
hey man

approached by this big investor
who has an in with the indian
reservation and gaming board
and he wants to turn the place
into a casino and i
i dont qualify for that
and i love this place
i love you guys
but it hard to keep this place
profitable
and samantha says she wants to
move to florida
and when the
wife says jump you say
let move to florida
but our jobs are safe right
see this we dont know because
theyre rebranding
theyre gonna turn the conference
rooms into gaming tables and slots

one who made it to the top
of the ladder of lies

has been lying to me
lying to all of you
he is not the assistant front
office manager
he is a bell captain
and that it
what is he talking about
i dont know susan
he has been impersonating a
manager and that is a felony
i dont think that a felony
alan youre very sweaty
he led me to believe that he was
up for a very specific job
and then he was parading it all
around the hotel
there are liability issues
ethics issues
he should be fired
okay all right all right just
hold on just calm down
stop the music
what the hell is
going on
i have proof that gunther is using
sanz hand sanz hand sanz hands
hand sanitizer
to brainwash his followers
let me see that
you went into his room
you broke into a guest room
i think that a felony
well yes but not because
i told him to
i was trying to prove that gunther
is conning everyone with spirifresh
who the hell is gunther
that not gunther that chief macanopy
he the guy who buying the hotel from me
who chief macanopy
this doesnt add up
youre selling the hotel

alan
ah
oh my god it worse
than we thought

give gunther your money
no this is bad
stop stop
hey stop it
this man is a sham
who is this guy
sit down
i know you all want to make your
lives better
and i know you think this guy is
going to do that but he not
okay
what has he done for you
what
has he done for any of you
what physical product has he
actually provided
let get him
let get him with some violence
we dont rip him limb from limb we do
not attack we are peaceful people yeah
steve the physical product is
the metaphysical being
it hard for him to learn
what the hell does that mean
what are you clapping for
yes
why are you crying man
okay okay
then what with all the
sanz hands hand sanitizer
what it called
sanz hands hand sanitizer
i believe in clean hands guys
you cant just clap for
everything he says
id like to clarify that you can applaud
everything i say it no problem
shh
okay okay
well gunther well why do you have
a thousand bottles of this stuff
ew gross
damn it josh
omg that hot
that right there not appropriate
come on
ah-ha that
i suffer from mysophobia
which is a fear of germs
one that is debilitating
then i read the teachings of khatkhate
baba who showed me the way of clean
the way of the sanz hands
hand sanitizer
which also was leading me on the
path to spirifresh
okay if you buy in
bulk like larger bottles
you could probably save a lot of
money that way
just look at me josh
it like the eskimo
like the eskimos
thank you josh we love him
we love you
i love josh i love josh
i love him here too
okay this is classic behavior
this is called poor conductor
because he sees
the choo-choo train
a successful man is going and he
wants to derail this poor conductor
i know
what the hell is the
matter with you
boo this man
boo shame
