
bulgaria is known as
the land of roses
in 945 the communist regime
seized political power in the country
and nationalized every
private property and enterprise
rose oil distilling was monopolized
by the totalitarian state
the rose became one of the symbols
of the communist party
based on a true story
damascena the transition
july 969

what is the name
of the rose richest in oil
rose damascena
do you know why
it was brought from damascus
in ancient times hence the name
is there something you dont know
techo
it takes a million roses to make
one kilogram of rose oil
one million picks
one million seconds are needed
to pick all those roses
human hands are needed here
the thracians were a wise people
they started growing roses here
herodotus himself mentions it
and why exactly here
look at the valley
the valley of thracian kings
guarded by mountains
on both sides
rivers flow into it and
irrigate it
as if the gods themselves protect it
the most aromatic roses
how many trucks left
you are wasting my time all day
this is the last truck for today
yeah really
give a hand to the girls
these are picked by the students
no need to check them
no need yeah right

too young to cheat right
i have found stones
bags of water
and all kinds of stuff inside
o tempora o mores
i wont waste your time

rose oil is liquid gold they say
it brought millions and millions
to the state
for me the rose oil distillery was
a temple not a cash machine
may 986

small time crooks

at the expense of the state

a zealous communist

brother
i know youve got 7 kilos
of my rose oil in the trunk

you can either give me back my oil
and we go on together
or you can go to the city
and we forget were brothers

she will bring you money
what going on
we fixed gyula
well get some cash
is this the life you want
you call this a life
cousin
this girl is coming with me
get up
dont worry
the baby asleep in the back
the baby peed on the dollars
i hope it a lucky charm
where are we going
i dont know
today the national currency continued
its severe devaluation
one us dollar traded for 200 levs
on the interbank market
the cash markets followed
a different logic
the usd interbank trade started at
bgl 500 -650
but by noon the exchange rate
was up by bgl 500
and the ask spread hit
bgl 250 at noon
then the rate decreased and
a balance was reached
at a bid spread of bgl 800
and an ask spread of bgl 200
it is paradox that an ask spread
is significantly below the bit spread
trading was strained
usd 66 million were bought
and almost usd 5 million were sold
the volumes are below the ones
common for the past days
i do not expect that from you
the national currency again lost
more than 20% of its value in just a day
since the start of the year
the dollar
has tripled its value against
bulgarian lev
the usd appreciated
with nearly 200 bgl today
are you ok
the posters read pensions 5 dollars
sausage 2 dollars
the protesters shouted against
a new socialist government
and in favor of early elections
elections elections
take some money from the sack and
go buy something for yourself
what something
clothes shoes
whatever you need
and get disposable diapers
for the baby
tell them the baby age
seven months
do you want anything
no
youre staying here
first private bank
give our money back
hey where are you going
the line back there
hey wise ass
take you place at the back
where you going with the sacks
get back
go inside and tell your boss that
techo is waiting for him outside
can you please go to the
end of the line
ive been freezing here all day for
20 dollars and now that guy
easy there are dollars
for everyone
what are you doing here techo
the privileged ones will never end
keep calm
it a madhouse
the dollar has gone through the roof
yes indeed
this isnt inflation
it an outright catastrophe
the dollar reached
bgl 3000 in a day
and what
everybody gone nuts
trading their last penny
i know it
i can see it from the hotel
over there
but i tell you the dollar
will fall in 3 days
it cant happen
itll take at least a month
i bet my beard on it
and i bet my hair
you want these dollars
youre killing yourself bro
do you want them
or should i go to your neighbors
did you piss on it
just take them
money doesnt smell
that what people say
plank come here
handsome though
here are the levs
where are my dollars
give him the dollars
hey plank
you gonna stick around here
come with me
get off please
youll live here
my friends will help you -
with the kid with the school
if things turn out well
you might come to work for me
but for now
this is the right way
get off please
ill never fancy another man techo
i only have eyes for you
may you have women
but be deprived of love
i kept building the temple
of the rose by the river
near the place where
it all started
dreams are always
greater than prayers
it very hard to deceive
a dreamer
a lie may slow him down
but will never stop him
how do you manage to spend
so much money in no time
last month i gave you 00 000 dollars
you not only spent all the money
from the rose oil distillery
but you are trying to kill yourself
with new loans every month
i pay you back dont i
along with the monstrous interest
you see
the temple of the rose requires
a lot of money
be careful techo
my head flies off if you
ill need some extra help
shave my beard
son ive been watching you
for years
the freedom you search for
does not exist
it an illusion
it a prison
a prison
to be free means to
choose your own prison
youre greedy
a man shouldnt be greedy
money
women
freedom
everyone has his own limits
limits for all three of these
if a man goes over his limits
they crush him
and that all
he finished
you were such a wild kid
look at you now
so many people
depend on you
techo you promised me
you promised me
dad
you promised me
roses will blossom -
with or without us
well
with us is preferable
im leaving you too soon
my son

we had so much to do together
too soon
all left me
fate left me too
where are your workers

oranges olives dishes -
whatever pays
germany spain
who knows where
where is that terminal 2 that swallows
our children like a dragon
tell them not to leave
what for
let them know that from now on
i will double their pay
dont do that
well lose everything
youll fuck up the others too
theyll kill us
what if the buyers
disagree
that a fucking suicide
first time ever right
emigration -
the modern slavery
a subtle slavery that allows for
the illusion of freedom
25 million bulgarians
have left the country
not a single war
has caused so much damage
i thought youd never come
you can use an extra hand
i cant buy your oil techo
these are hard times
everyone produces
but there are no buyers no markets
turkey is crushing us

hasan bey
bulgaria and turkey are the largest
rose oil producers in the world
we were a leader until recently
the markets were yours
but now theyre ours
it isnt our fault that your country
has problems
were making large investments in
rose plantations
we have a good product
western companies came with
their investments
leave us this much 20%
give us some room to breathe
there terrible corruption
in bulgaria
the communist elite
switched sides
now they are the rich ones
who rip off the society
other nouveau riche come from
the criminal underground
we look after our business
you better fix your country
i can see you know very well
the problems in bulgaria
with all due respect hasan bey
my forecast is that in 7-8 years
you will have problems similar to ours
the wheel spins
things may turn around
i dont see how
i will turn them around
only time will show
may allah be with you
cousin stop the car
stop the car
take me back to the clinic
take me back
hey cousin
ill come to see you often
dont worry about me
youre not a free man cousin
im the free one among us
i started drinking
i really hit the bottom
i gave up
did you forget me
i didnt forget you
i renounced you
why did you stop dreaming
because i became a slave
a slave of the state
to the banks
to the mafia to their money
to my women to my children
a slave to everything
and everyone
it a voluntary prison
and you leave it
voluntarily too
good morning
techo ive known you for ages
why didnt you call me earlier
you sound like an
abandoned lover
you dont understand do you
you were dead
ive been drinking
for three weeks
you would be dead
on the third day
you really dont get it
your condition is really serious
some tests must be made
youve had symptoms
long before havent you
symptoms
i have symptoms
as many as you like
ill be going
well how do you want me to say it -
delicately or outright
delicately speaking there is
a tumor somewhere inside you
in the head
in the head
and
how much time do i have
plenty of time if i cut it out
prepare yourself for surgery
well
and what if you dont
cut it out
it will continue to grow and
depending on how aggressive it is
it could be months weeks
tomorrow
tomorrow
i see youre afraid
you dont get it at all
no it normal
were all afraid
but youre lucky because
i am a really good surgeon
i am calling the team
you really dont get it
no i dont
if you have to do
something important
and you can postpone it for
tomorrow will you do it today
what if you have no tomorrow
that thing in my head will remind
me that i have no tomorrow
i dont get it
where is the nurse
what nurse
ive run out of time
the dream stayed with me
the tumor in my head is
not a verdict but a gift
a gift to make me realize that
i have no tomorrow
and that my past is gone too
they exist only in my thoughts
now i know how to deceive time
ive learned to live now
in the very moment
to be today is my tomorrow
boss
hello stefan bey
hasan bey
that my son
i underestimated your words
stefan bey
that in the past
now we need to work together to
retain and expand our global markets
and by saying our markets
i mean ours and yours
that the responsibility
that we have to deal with
so the war between us is over
do i get it right
there has been no war

we dont have similar problems
the people are most important

joint operations

your oil first
