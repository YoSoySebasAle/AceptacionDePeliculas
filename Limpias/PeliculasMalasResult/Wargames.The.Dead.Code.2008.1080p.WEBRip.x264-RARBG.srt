granddaughter sent me

penis
newman is this your
first time with figjam
figjam
yeah were in the information acquisition business
well okay
yeah
figjam fuck im good
just ask me
him
this better be good rashe
good morning ken
show me
morbidity rate 986 %
set up the skiff
get me paget from homeland
cavanaugh from cdc
and stradler from
the joint chiefs
again full-screen
yes sir
that my girl
these are terrorists people
eliminated in an automated operation with 986 % efficiency
986 the temperature
of blood
and not a drop of ours spilled
thanks entirely to our girl ripley
ripley detected this particular terrorist cell
through one of
her honeypot sites
attractive high-stakes games hidden
in the darker reaches of the internet
screen
once a player penetrates
level 5
ripley tags him
as a security threat
ripley engaged
skilled gamers
exhibiting familiarity with weapon systems and terror tactics
this particular group managed to pool winnings of just under $3 million
which we paid
wait a minute
you paid
a terrorist group $3 million
that affirmative general
but youll be pleased to know that everyone associated with this group
is either in custody or already enjoying their much-hyped afterlife
ripley walks tall
and carries a very big stick
that why we
applaud everyone here
for endorsing ripley status
of complete autonomy
both foreign and domestic
temporary domestic autonomy
kenneth
let take your girl for a walk before you let her off her leash
there were innocents
at that party
understandably collateral
but what assurances
do we have
ripley wont orchestrate
a similar attack at home
ripley wont be dropping bombs at home
mr paget
and there will
always be innocents
at least ripley hit this target away from population and cameras
and she targeted
their vehicle
which just happened to be loaded with
c-4 and iranian katyusha missiles
the explosion that killed these people was theirs
not ours
thank you for your time
one question
what happens if we miss the connection after weve paid them off
i mean
if these guys are smart enough to beat the game
then they might be smart enough to beat their tail
in which case we wouldnt just be tempting them
wed be financing them
terror is a filthy sewer
filled with hatred and bile
that threatens our shores
if we are to
protect ourselves
we have to be able
to anticipate threats
are we tempting those
who would harm us
damn right if theyre innocent
truth will out
in the meantime ripley
will be online 24/7
looking to
identify our enemies
and the next 6-year-old who is a year away from strapping on a bomb
let focus people
you got 0 minutes to turn in your tests
need answers for 7
5 6 and 20
mr maltz i believe
you dialed the wrong number
damn
all computers are doomed
this machine didnt make
this kind of mistake
this machine was adjusting itself during the game
to the situation
that just arose
now i know
i propose that these
hey you know you promised your mom you wont play wow anymore
i totally agree with that
in fact i swear to you i will never
ever bother you about that again
arent you gonna ask why
why
actually you dont have to because im gonna tell you anyway
i just found this new gaming site
it called ripley
you know like
the matt damon movie
or alien
yeah whatever
anyway
this one has no limit
and i will stake you
with every cent that i have
which is equal to or less than the amount you already owe me
less less actually
so exactly how did mr
kasparov beat big blue
the world smartest
chess computer
he used
an unexpected strategy
he used an
unexpected strategy
a counter-intuitive strategy
something the computer
couldnt anticipate
mr
farmer youve suddenly taken an interest in chess
well actually
i dont play
but i was considering
taking it up
perhaps youd like to join our excursion
to montreal for the internationals
ill think about it
think mr farmer
imagine yourself
making a decision
so youre
interested in chess
about as much as you
oh you mean
because it didnt look like i was paying attention
because you were texting
and doing your nails
i already know
that match by heart
oh you dont believe me
didnt say that
didnt have to
you looked up and to the right
it a clear tell
oh really
what am i telling now
pain
if youre serious
about the trip
it $550
but you might get a discount because of the no-show
you going
what it to you
just curious
you are so full of it
youre an easy read
for a smart kid
maybe you shouldnt take up chess
cause if i faced you over a board
id take you apart
before your first move
bring it on then
no you gotta get yourself together before someone can take you apart
that how it works
* there a little hope
* in little plans
* bells chime out today
* you made your key
quite old to find
* the space you left behind
fills meaning there
* but now just favorite songs
* you know tonight im home
hmm
favorite quote
robert oppenheimer
okay dog name hoover
younger sister rebecca
rebecca
becky
no
i have your id sucker
you try and hack my password again
ill burn you
she put in a mousetrap
that scary
of course if you happen
to be mr will farmer
maybe you should just come to montreal if youre so curious
grab me a beer
so neatness doesnt
really count
not when youre
about to pass out
bless you tough day
lately were putting out more bullshit than air freshener
dont touch
theyre dumping
my odorless bleach idea
but i talked them into letting me keep my beta samples
talked them into
let just say they owed me
it one thing to take my ideas and keep all the profits
but to dump something
because a new vp doesnt want
to be upstaged by a woman
you getting sick
uh-huh
i hope it a cold
the flu is supposed to be
really nasty this year
what would you say if i told you i was thinking of taking up chess
id wanna know
the girl name
and how much
it going to cost
mr massude left you a packet
it over by the door
there a trip to montreal
it $550 but i think
i can get a discount
her name annie
good luck

that all about
i dont know mr
massude didnt really have time to talk
he wanted me to make sure
to give you this
and he said thanks
he didnt say anything else
those two with him
and they didnt exactly try to shut him up
but you could tell that they didnt want any chitchat
if you ask me
it probably something to do with immigration
but he nearly done
with his citizenship program
arent you gonna open it
yeah sure right
holy shit
wow
so what time
your flight
bye mom
bye sweetie have fun
okay youre sure
he coming
he said he was coming
well i guess he
not gonna make it
looks like it gonna be
just you and me
im gonna go look for him
relax relax
sit down okay hold it
ill go find him
please make sure
they dont leave without me
yeah
mr nichols
yeah
looking for your friend
will farmer
yeah why
you know where he is
this way
whoa
where are you taking me
excuse me sorry
excuse me excuse me sorry
excuse me
im sorry im sorry
some basic rules for this excursion
mr farmer
if youre going to be late
please let us know
and if you feel the need to be overly dramatic
save it for the school play
im sorry im having
trouble with my cell
will
you made it
yeah
i sent a text to dennis
didnt he tell you
it from security
no
ladies and gentlemen
thank you for your patience
please prepare
for departure
mr baron we cant
leave without dennis
everyone can relax i just heard from mr
nichols via airport security
something to do with
a family situation
hopefully hell be joining us
in montreal by tomorrow
this way mr nichols
arent you going to offer me
a cigarette and a blindfold
we usually wait until after we beat you with a phone book
mr nichols
you know
if you guys want to convince me im not in any trouble
then youll quit
calling me mr nichols
we dont have to convince you
of anything mr nichols
it going to be up
to you to convince us
of what exactly
that im not part of a high-school terrorist chess conspiracy
why did you make me
miss my flight
do you have any idea how much money my father paid for that ticket
tell us about mr farmer
your friend
all right
tell us about the game
if youd like to cooperate
you might save both yourself
and your friend a great deal of trouble
what do you want me to say
there nothing to tell
will is just a smart kid who played some stupid online game
to win some money to go on a trip with a girl
that it okay
end of story
there nothing else
but you know i mean
if you guys wanna add more to that
then feel free to call my father
who happens to be a lawyer
then we can sue you for violation of my civil rights
what girl
oh youve got to be
kidding me
consider this
your smart friend used funds provided by a terrorist cell in syria
and wagered it against
government computers
and displayed insider knowledge of biological and chemical weapons
meanwhile his mother
a bio-engineer at wyren
has been stealing and stockpiling chemical agents
this means that your very smart friend
mr will farmer
is being sought for bioterrorist activities against philadelphia
and is very likely to spend the rest of his life in federal prison
regarding your civil rights
you dont have any
not where terrorist linkage
is highly probable
you happy now dennis
why should i be happy
i just called you dennis
didnt i
command we have visual
on baker zulu niner
well continue observer status till subject lands
copy
it wasnt immigration
wasnt the local law it wasnt fbi
you hacked all those sites
i had to find out
who took him
according to local state and federal databases
that car doesnt exist
so who took him
i dont know
but whoever it was really freaked the shit out of him
because he left me the same amount of cash for fixing his computer
he knew he was gonna
be gone for a while
hello
mom hey
will is that you
of course it me
who else calls you mom
are you in montreal
no were still on the plane
theyre still kind of circling
listen i was just wondering
have you heard anything from dennis
he didnt make the flight
something about a family emergency
no nobody called
i dont think
hey anything else
about mr massude
oh a moving van pulled up
and i think they took
everything out
they cleaned out his house
it just seems kind of sudden
oh just a sec
hey mom
oh there somebody at the door
theyre wearing suits
either they want to sell me a bible or ive just won $000000

i would say she found something
perfect

jesus
i just got off the phone with cdc and homeland
who were giving me
a tag-team ass-chewing
because you put philadelphia
on a stage 2 alert

that exactly what we wanted to do
what the hell their problem
well there
a new flu out there
and cavanaugh
people are jumping
meanwhile ripley has labeled
mrs farmer son
as a person of interest
and were tagging him
to see where he leads
how the hunt going
on the syrian front extremely well
solid leads
ive got a budget meeting next week

manly intelligence
he is hacking into the merchant bank supercomputer behind us
i was in the cafe
the guy pulling heavy side jobs
im talking running credit cards and pocketing the cash
of course
he didnt notice me because im not a chick
and these pringles
this is all part of your plan
yes as a matter of fact yes
were gonna piggy-back on our guy there to get into that system
you dont really
think he hot
okay so that why we have
to borrow his terminal
borrow
and let me guess
you want me to distract him
just for a minute

fine
okay we should be
peer-to-peer

when other kids were out playing baseball
you were in a dark room
playing with computers
i played baseball
third base all-stars
and i didnt play
with computers

oh christ get that
image off the screen
at least we know
who watching
but he didnt need
to see her like that
tracing file access
inserting mobile
tracking software
what ripley gonna do
in all likelihood she already done it
this is carter
who have we got up at montreal
do you think that was her
i couldnt really tell
she got bad sinuses from working around chemicals all these years
when she gets a cold
if she not careful it turns to pneumonia
will will
we cant stay here why
because there is someone watching us
in the doorway across from the cafe
this guy
i ran into him before at the airport
a guy what guy
what did you say i nothing
he seemed innocent
i just ran into him
oh jeez annie go
over here this way
i think we lost them
go go go go
down here
okay did we lose them
yeah i think so
it crazy
oh jesus come on run
where are we going
the subway just trust me
this way
cut them off
are they following us
i dont know
are you okay
tracing mobile transponder
we gotta be bugged
did they give you anything at orientation
i didnt get that far
remember
wait wait
your cell phone
stupid
will will
connection lost
connection lost
will
it okay
it all right
were gonna stay
here till after dark
no no theyre gonna
come after us
they wont
im sorry im so sorry
i just wanna go home
the girl cell phone
found it 2 miles down the track
theyre still searching
they havent found the kids you know
you want some fries
yes thank you
ripley have any guesses
where theyre going
i dont think ripley guesses
about anything
i think ripley relies on her amazing feminine intuition
sorry rip didnt mean
to make that sound offensive
and the mother
she still in icu
theyre doing tests on her
nobody sure exactly what she got
does hassert
know any of this
you didnt speak to him
you know i spoke
with him earlier
he confident that ripley following protocols
and that we should
do the same thing
ripley premature
in any of this
who knows
that profile certainly fits
kid and his mother both disenfranchised
after what happened to the father
the kid with outstanding computer and chem weapon knowledge
and the stuff that
we found in that kitchen
there stuff there that could be used to make a bio-weapon
which could trigger
the decon system
or it could be used to make
anti-bacterial mouthwash
and where are the samples
that the thing
she wont tell us
what
yeah
hassert gave ripley priority to classify on her own discretion
even from us
yeah
what do you think
thinking is
bioterror threat
level 3
decontamination
system on standby
back at the cafe
when my e-date was wowing me
with his mastery
of the internet
i asked him if he ever
heard about ripley
let me guess he claimed
he owned the concept
not exactly
but he did help me
do a google search
which yes i could have done myself
but you said to distract him
did you ever hear about
a guy named stephen falken
he designed the old system
the one that they replaced with ripley
the joshua project
i know what
the joshua project was
i just had no idea
it was replaced by ripley
no not just that
when ripley took over
falken went crazy
he threatened to kill himself to stop them
and then they ignored him
and one day he just rode his truck off a bridge
he killed himself
just an urban legend
and he had remarried
he had a wife and two kids
a hell of a protest
i think i just
found a way out
uh im just gonna stay here
upgrading search
for suspects to local police
i hope this is
important people
the fat lady was just about to die of consumption
ill assume
were all up to speed
with the samples confiscated
from the farmer residence
i believe it clear that these alone
constitute just cause for a level 3 alert
the complete list contains
at least 5 agents
which in a series of combinations
could be used as a bio-weapon
by who
that our call
we also have confirmation
from your chemical and bio-sensors in the greater philadelphia area
that they are showing the presence of some of these compounds
well were talking about a major chemical manufacturing corridor here
hell weve got wyren dow
corning and four or five others
less than 0 miles
from downtown philly
all the more
reason for caution
you cant honestly believe this kid mother is involved
worst thing anyone
ever said about her
is that she over-qualified
for her pay scale
youre forgetting the father
ancient history
the woman works with household and personal antiseptics
were talking about mouthwash
for christ sakes
they test
the stuff on bacteria
which makes it perfectly reasonable to expect traces at home
i doubt the woman could threaten our democracy with gingivitis
there were more than traces
we are talking about the quarantine of millions of people
billions in expense
not to mention the potential for riot and panic
and how in hell did you gain access to our sensory data
without our knowledge
it as much
our turf as yours
our turf our call
are these your
staff decisions
or is this incredible load
of horse shit
being handed out by
that computer vixen of yours
computer vixen i see
id like to underscore the importance of our mutual cooperation
and unless
i hear otherwise
im going to assume
we have your support
unless anyone has anything to add
im going to try and catch the fourth act
ah
i gotta get some real food
i wish id taken french
i did
im trying to remember
the french word for hotdog
uh
try bread what that
you want two rabbits
nice work
um two of those
oh hotdogs
yes hotdogs
hey were gonna
get through this
are you sure
i havent been
sure of anything
since that glass half full question in seventh grade
really so what is it
half full or half empty
you first
never thought it mattered unless you happen to be dying of thirst
oh my god
what
it us were on tv
were like this bio-chem version of bonnie and clyde
will there a cop
still there
i think we should split up
okay
im gonna go first
all right
okay
you should stay together
i have a truck in
the lot down by the pier
meet me there
who are you
im the gentleman who nearly
started world war iii
move move
we havent much time
on the driver seat there a laptop
if you wouldnt mind
okay
youre stephen falken
mr slick showed me
his picture on the internet
you know what
youre supposed to be dead
i am technically
after i trashed my reputation and everything else i valued in life
trying to put
a stop to ripley
suicide seemed like
a believable way out
this way i can keep tabs
on what theyre up to
without giving them
a reason to kill me
how did you find us
ive been following ripley
ripley been following you
and my little
friend here helped
damn were out of range
may i
theyre biting
they assume
youve already escaped
and theyre abandoning
their perimeter
very clever
all i need is
a clear line of sight
i can hack into their cells
reroute all their calls through me
too risky
with ripley watching
any signature
and shell be on us
what do they want
ripley is hunting you will
and everyone on her matrix
let go please
wait before we go
you mind telling us where were going
to find someone to
help us stop ripley
jesus bill
what the hell is that
please tell me this isnt
another ripley issue
not exactly
look i understand what ripley doing
it just
it why you know
come on bill
maybe she is being excessive on the kid and the mother side
but how can you
discount that
what you mean that stuff
from massude brother
is that what
youre talking about
were into dozens
of randomly associated cells
massude a gold mine
i spoke to massude brother
i talked to the guy and with our interrogators over there
he a petty thief
he sells fake cartier watches
out of the souks in damascus
and by now he probably coughed up the names of every person
that he ever known
since he was six years old
which think about this
explains why we have no linkage
between the terrorist side
and the farmer family
no i disagree
six degrees
of separation tina
think about it
given enough time
ripley is gonna tie
half the goddamn civilized world to this thing
what are you saying bill
what do you want us to do
you want us to stop
that probably a treasonable offense
let we could send her
on a wild goose chase
a smoke screen
something to slow her down
i can hear what
youre saying bill
but you dont
mess with ripley
she messes with you
yeah
moving satellite
search to sector alpha 43
satellites heat signatures
does it work
they havent nabbed me yet
my youngest child
joshua loved bears
his favorite
called him max
you mind if i
ask you something
shoot
does your wife
know youre alive
or does she really think
you killed yourself
she knew i was sick
so probably made some sense
me not wanting
to drag them through it
youre sick
pancreatic cancer
it nasty
at least it quick
i was part of
ripley design team
that makes me a threat
my family safety
i couldnt let them threaten that
it probably
better this way
i lost my dad
when i was seven
but i still think
about him all the time
i know your kids are
probably grown up by now
but it seems a shame to deprive them of even a little more time
i thought you said
they wouldnt be looking for us
glove compartment two passports
one for you one for annie
i photoshopped in your ids
do either of you speak french
i do
a little
pretend to be asleep
if they try to search the vehicle
wake up and mumble something about having to go to the bathroom
you just play dead
what if it doesnt work
then theyll save you the trouble of having to pretend
enlarging massude/farmer matrix
hey why are you here
im not
okay
uh
are we where
were supposed to be
it a funnel
rarely used as a murder weapon
there a thermos
and sandwiches in the cab
good vermont cheddar
once we fill up
we wont be stopping again
too dangerous
what happened to your dad
he was a computer guy
worked for mci
and lived in virginia
y2k rapid deployment
he used to have all
kinds of cool gear
he used to let
me play with it
anyway he was off
on a big job in europe
picked up some weird bug
the infection went
straight to his heart
one day we were laughing about how
much snot he could blow out his nose
then he wasnt there anymore
funny thing
mom was always the one that had problems with infections
he was afraid shed pick up
something at work
that what they told you
your dad worked at mci
technically that true
but it wasnt y2k
the travel was in bosnia
for the government
i knew about your dad
when i was teaching at mit
he was a student there
later he became a communications liaison for the military
he believed it was an important humanitarian mission
and he wanted to help
because of his specialized knowledge of early gsm networks
he was sent to
track down f-6 pilots
there were
unspeakable atrocities
rumors of biological weapons
your dad may
have been a victim
shouldnt they
have warned him
or at least tried to help
exactly the sentiments
your mother expressed
which made her very unpopular with certain government agencies
i think you begin to see why ripley is so interested in you both
it not right
it no matter
your dad was a hero will
you must never forget that
was the decon system alerted
what i dont get is why ripley wont share information with us
she a computer
her primary job is to identify and kill terrorists
anyone who compromises
that objective is expendable
and loser buys breakfast
i think i got you
hey
it goes to show you
beauty before age
newman
no
no network
does he know youre coming
who
the guy who gonna
help us beat ripley
oh god dr falken falken
two
okay
right here
two
okay here you go
all right
two all right
all right
okay
all right
all right
are you gonna be
okay dr falken
stephen please
you two are now
all the family i have
hey hey in there
hey
dont bother with that
there nothing to sight on
you dont like to knock
i sent you several text messages
didnt you get that
it broken you fix
that who gonna
help us defeat ripley
oh dear god no not him
him
that joshua
wow it old
in his day
he was miles ahead of the curve
they sent us both out to pasture at the same time
i had him quietly shipped
out of state
and then here
to run a power grid
amazingly no one cared
that piece of shit
can do nothing right
he slow
i can beat it at chess
are you russian
i used to be in
soviet space program
but soviet space program
not what it used to be
you like vodka
youve been doing a lot more than just
playing chess and running the grid
i do a little
phishing after hours
that piece of shit can barely manage simple job like credit card fraud
maybe you dont know how to handle a sensitive one like this
i treat it too good
wow
atta boy joshua
time to wake up
greetings
professor falken
shall we play a game
yes joshua
many many games
bioterror threat level
are you really suggesting ripley tried to kill you
that absurd
no no ill tell you
what absurd
that a kid is fighting for his life in hospital right now
because of your
goddamn arrogance
that what absurd
excuse me sir
i just spoke with the surgical team
and
newman vitals are stable
but he hasnt regained consciousness
that cavanaugh
he on me
wanting to know why we still havent released the farmer woman
now that her condition
been downgraded
how could he know that
someone hacked into the system and circulated her file
someone
no prizes for guessing who
will somebody please explain to me how
with a $300 million budget
we cant manage to find one high school kid and his girlfriend
and that would be the cdc
cdc fbi dhs cia
ive got the whole damn
alphabet on my ass
demanding that we shut
this operation down
is that something
youre considering
i cant
another tip from massude brother
our afghan special-ops team
found a bio-weapon prototype
three of the compounds in common with the farmer samples
evidence points to
a sleeper cell in philly
bioterror threat level 4
commencing pre-decontamination procedure
initiating
decontamination countdown
im sorry mr hassert
ive got the cdc homeland
and the joint chiefs
for you on speaker 0
decontamination countdown
beginning now
never seen that
countdown before
what happens at zero
you dont wanna know
turn the bitch off
we cant what do you mean
you cant
ripley has control
the system impervious to human interference
that was the point
edwards air force base
just came online
ripley taken control
of one of their predators
it was stationed over afghanistan
fully armed and fuelled
nukes
smart bomb with multiple
low-yield warheads
well say halleluiah hassert
if that baby hits
us airspace
it gonna be
a white damn christmas
how long is it gonna
okay joshua have fun
beginning power
reroute now
can joshua defeat ripley protocol in philadelphia
given enough time
that what i designed him to do
checks and balances
work in tandem with ripley
not against her
bipartisanship
and we know
how that ended up
intrusion detected
gaming scenarios detected

you talking about
joshua
atta boy joshua
good work
thank you professor
i programed you to operate
at a reduced level
it was important to
conceal your identity
there are those who would wish to do harm to you and us
are you referring to
the current operation
seeking to apprehend
you and your friends
wait ripley knows
were here
yes that is why she requests
that i deliver a message
she wants you to leave
it is your only
hope for survival
why is that
because this game is lost
eta one minute

im subterranean
good
hey you gonna be okay

right now
ive got to figure out a way to get all the ip addresses
of everyone who has
ever played ripley
no problem
how long have you been there
long enough
just give me a few minutes
see you in the basement
look that guy
he opened up the database
how did he do that
all these
people played ripley
over 400000
busy girl
let begin again
shall we
let talk of microchips
i have a buyer
we could make
wonderful business
and i could
have you arrested
i am arrested
so you are
get him out of here
decontamination
in 48 minutes
how this gonna work
when you log on to ripley
she puts a bug in your system
if everyone can log
on at the same time
and tie up her servers with
renegade zombie computers
she might loosen
her grip on the city
intruder alert
intruder alert

mr
hassert ripley just let go of six blocks in downtown philly
make that eight blocks sir
0 blocks sir
get the kid in here
he clearly onto something
he set this up
the son of a bitch set us up
no im trying to help
im trying to fix this where are we going
let me go
if ripley gives us an opening
we gotta mobilize against those decon units
i want them taken out
if
sorry
if she gives us an opening
that a damn big if
have a seat will
we like what youre doing
that why you let me keep the backpack
correct
decontamination

gaming protocol alert
emergency override
she cut us off
damn we need help
to overload her
she too powerful
we gotta get more players in there
can you give me a prompt
on ripley screen
we tried a million ways
and she wont respond
decontamination
in 44 minutes
were not trying
to talk to her
that why the professor
went back inside
youve gotta be kidding me
is this glass bullet-proof
that pure steel
two inches i know
if we can raise her temperature
we might force a prompt
try
morbidity rate
recalculated to 58 %
collateral damage acceptable
if you fire into
that mainframe
ripley will think she being attacked
and start launching missiles
not if i just break the glass
im not gonna risk
a nuclear attack
step aside ken i swear to god
ill blow that 40 grand
worth of cosmetic surgery right up to your smug goddamn face
go ahead shoot me
but im not gonna move
ive got a prompt
go ahead will
decontamination
in 40 minutes
come on
he gotta be in there
he gotta be
try no try max
joshua little teddy remember
greetings
professor falken
yes
joshua
yeah the professor saved him
sent him like e-mail
professor isnt
with us joshua
but i know that
he would want you to help
perhaps a game
yes
decontamination
in 37 minutes
shit she not even
slowing down
we should bump the money
in the honeypot games
we need traffic
give the winner $000000
a million
not a wager a prize
beat the computer
win $000000
make it 00 million
were not playing for second

decontamination halted
all systems restored
yes
yes
wait wait
wait a minute hold it
there still
something wrong here
professor falken
we hear you joshua
what happening
what ripley doing
partitioning
shutting down
shutting down that good
that what we want isnt it
she not just
admitting defeat
ripley self-destructing
she ran a self-check
discovered joshua
she treating him
like a virus
now as he tries to migrate through her system to survive
she has to cannibalize
herself to get to him
ripley cant self-destruct
that a direct violation of her program
technically yes
so what the problem
mission redirected
destination washington dc
target eta 7 minutes
morbidity rate 00 %
you realize that if ripley destroyed
it automatically triggers a response
nuclear
depending on
the incoming vector
radarll trace that baby
right back to afghanistan
there is a genius subculture of chess fanatics who play to lose
they call it suicide chess
you force your opponent
to take your pieces
before he can do
the same to you
so whoever loses wins
if we can teach
ripley that
yes
joshua im going to teach you to play a new game
what are you doing
teaching joshua to
play russian roulette
are you serious
if joshua plays
with live missiles
ripley will have to play out
the wargame scenario
each event will end
in total annihilation
which is a direct contradiction to her programing
and what then
itll force her hand
she either backs off
or starts world war iii
hopefully shell see that
by playing to win she loses
fifteen minutes before
the predator hits dc
for this to be a real threat
i cant tell joshua not to lie
confirm codes
do it
codes accepted
there 36000
nuclear missiles out there
6000 of which are
armed and ready to fire
that a -in-6 chance of having a freaking nuclear warhead
