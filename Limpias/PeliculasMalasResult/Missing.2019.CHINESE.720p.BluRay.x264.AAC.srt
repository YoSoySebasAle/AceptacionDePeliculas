hello nam
ying there news about wah
come to the police station
nam
nam
a hiker found this two days ago
and brought it to us
here you can keep his badge
the police
will no longer be involved in this case
it been seven years since the incident
our protocol states
that we cant continue the investigation
his badge is best in your keeping
in my keeping
i kept a lot of things too
but what the point
i thought you asked me to come up here
to let me know if there
were any developments
now that weve found his
badge there hope
but youre telling me
youre gonna stop investigating
ying calm down
you know i want to find wah as well
where did you find his badge
at wah last known location
around the snake stone in sai kung
who found it
a regular citizen
but something doesnt feel right to him
i want to meet him
alright
i want to know where did
you find this badge
im not obliged to say anything
but whatever i say
cant be used in a court of law
hey she asking you a question
ive already answered you before madam
you dont belive me yet youve asked
your subordinate to question me
what do you want
im not a cop
this is my father
he been missing for a long time
please tell me more
it a place that doesnt exist on map
hey what are you doing
dont you wanna know where i went
open the gate now
what did you think i would do
alright
since neither of you believe me leave now
i believe you
i want to know where you found this badge
please tell me i beg you
many people have searched for him
for seven years
but weve found nothing
you were the only one who found something
so i want you to tell me more
as you said it been seven years
hed be dead even if we found him
at least id have an answer
i wont give up until i find him
what if i told you
when i was there
i saw my wife who died five years ago
would you believe me
yes i would
but what i say would sounds ridiculous
i dont want others to think im a lunatic
nam
it an enchanted realm
it was a very foggy day
before i went into the enchanted realm
i kept going on the same path
after god-knows how long i finally left
but i couldnt locate myself on a map
and my compass doesnt work
i kept walking and walking
it mustve been more than seven days
but it never got dark
i never got hungry or thirsty
i saw a lot of people walk by
hey
but they couldnt hear me at all
hey
hey
finally i saw a beam of light
i walked towards it
and there she was my late wife
as i was approaching
i came back out
i went back to the mountains a few times
but i couldnt get into the enchanted realm
how did you get in in the first place
i have no idea
but i think it a realm
that is fluid in nature
it doesnt have a fixed entrance or exit
and certain conditions need to be met
in order to get in
im still trying to figure it out
for the first few months
after my father went missing
i was at the mountains every day
but i never crossed into
the enchanted realm
i found his badge at the enchanted realm
if you couldnt get in
you wouldnt be able to find him
so youre saying
that my father is in that realm
yes
enough
ying let go
this is absolute nonsense
let me ask you
are your dreams real
yes why
because they feel real
but how can you quantify your feelings
do you have tangible evidence
and the place you were in your dream
was it real
a dream is a dream what are you on about
ying he crazy
why are you still listening to him
i guess it time for this lunatic
to take his pills
both of you leave
i beg you please tell
me more about the realm
get out
let go
ying ying
it been seven years
if he really still alive
he wouldnt be in the mountains
a badge doesnt mean much
can you be more rational about this
he said he was up there for seven days
ive asked his family
and they said he was gone for a few hours
he a lying lunatic
the police werent able to find anything
of his for the past seven years
but this so-called lunatic found something
that belonged to my dad
should i believe him or you
i want to find wah as well
but that doesnt mean
im gonna believe anything anyone says
i know you think this is ridiculous
but i choose to believe
at least there a glimmer of hope
slowly be careful
dont worry i can handle by myself
ching loves you
that why he hired a maid for you
why did you have to fire the maid
that bastard kid
no ive already submitted it
wait a second
sorry vincent
yes it at home sorry
ill submit it first thing tomorrow morning
ying ma sorry for the trouble today
ill hire a new maid as soon as possible
no worries i was free today
i was just chatting with mrs mak
im fine now why do i need a maid
mom
youre not listening to me
youre being unfilial
bastard kid
sorry i appreciate your help today
im off tomorrow i can take care of her
thanks for letting me
store stuff at your place
dont mention it
alright i should be heading back
sure ill send you out

bye-bye

we sent that girl to the hospital hours ago
hours ago
i know her
oh right ill get back to work
ying what are you doing here
that my client in there
she called me
and i got here as soon as i could
dont worry she not in danger
but you dont look too well
i got lost just now
what are you talking about
did you arrest that man
are you okay
there he was
ying
ying are you okay
mom
yes vincent
didnt you know there was a meeting
what meeting
isnt that tomorrow
two oclock on the 4th
yes sorry i
sorry ill be there soon
mom how many times
have i told you not to wander around
it very dangerous
there you are
youve been gone a month
you didnt even call
did you spend all your money
and now youre asking me for some
mom i made you breakfast this morning
come on let go home
do you have any shame
mom let talk about this at home okay
there a lot of people here
what cannot be said out here
are you afraid of people finding out
about your bad deeds
you little bastard
everyone you know are imbeciles
you only ever ask me for money
you talk back at me when youre at home
youre the best at acting
acting like such a good boy out here
it angers me to have a son like you
other people have children too
none are as bad as you
you nasty little bastard
i regret having you
you never do what you promised
i hate people who are fake
killing without mercy
ying youre awake
that man killed people
you were only dreaming
it real
that man was killed children
in the housing estate
i saw a beam of light
just like the one the other guy said he saw
i went to the enchanted realm
i really went in there
stop your nonsense okay
the doctor said you had low blood sugar
if you carry on like
this youll faint again
also my father called me
he really called me
come on why dont you rest for a bit
yes vincent
hello when are you
submitting the proposal
im working on it now
you are rushing
youre always rushing whenever i call you
the client is flying off tomorrow morning
i need some time
ill send it to you when im done
what kind of attitude is this
son
what is it
im hungry
ill make you something later
how many times have i told you
dont bother me while im working
why dont you ever listen to me
are you trying to kill me
is the whole world trying to kill me
trying to kill me
im giving everything up
to take care of you every day
mr ho
im not available
just put down the money and go
i think ive been into the enchanted realm
what about your police friend
she doesnt believe me
it was very foggy
i kept trying to find my way
then i saw a man slaughtering children
that the enchanted realm
what you just said proves that im right
the enchanted realm appears in places
where violence was prevalent
just like
i saw a group of japanese soldiers
burying some villagers
the enchanted realm is a place
where time and space interlace
people in the realm will witness
deeds of injustice from the past
that why you saw that
man killing children
did you tell the cops
im not actually crazy okay
wait a second
how did you get out
i saw a beam of light just like you said
the space that the enchanted realm occupies
is the same as the real world
it just that the fluidity is different
there can be an enchanted realm right here
this can still be a mountaineering shop
in the enchanted realm
were just not in there at this moment
just like parallel universes in films
here a simpler metaphor
fluidity
same place but one is going faster
and the other is going slower
but there will be times when they overlap
like the hour-hand and the minute-hand
one goes faster and the other goes slower
but they overlap at times
and when they overlap
the entrance to the
enchanted real will open
and because of the difference in fluidity
the two worlds experience time differently
so seven days in the enchanted realm
was just a few hours in our world
yes
but it was the opposite for me
i was only there for a while
but when i got out
it already been a few hours
what symptoms did you experience
after you got out of the enchanted realm
i felt tired so tired that i fainted
my friend sent me to the hospital
the doctor said that my blood sugar was low
what did you do in the enchanted realm
after i saw the man kill the children
i kept on running
i get it now
i get it now
the time you experience
in the enchanted realm
not only will it be compressed
but it can also be extended
which explains the how
i was able to spend seven days in the realm
without any food or water and no sleep
because i wasnt hungry sleepy or thirsty
i thought i was in there for seven days
but it has only been a
few hours for my body
that why i didnt feel sleepy
hungry or thirsty
with the same logic
i was running for a while in there
but ive been running for hours
in the real world
right do you know why
you had low blood sugar
from excessive exercise
also when i was in there
i received a call from my dad
does that mean he in there somewhere
that possible
but that could also be his spiritual waves
ive also received a call
from my dead wife when i was there
so there hope in finding him
yes
how do i get back in
do you hear weird noises sometimes
or see strange unexplainable things
things that only you can see or hear
and nobody else can feel
that it
but once i left
i didnt see these things again
now you have the key
to enter the enchanted realm
what does that mean
it magnetic fields
it radio waves
youre able to receive radio waves
that others cant
im gonna need your help
with getting back in there
why do you want to
get into the enchanted realm
we are the same
were both looking for answers
mrs mak
ying there you are
your mother left a bag at my place
come get it for her
sure
your mother is a saint
she always here taking care of me
but she forgetful
she was too busy listening to music
listening to music
have a look
june 3rd 980
chan kin sang a 55-year-old man
heavily in debt with mental disorders
tied up his three daughters
all under ten years old
and killed them
and commited suicide by
falling to his death
why are you telling me this
that case happened
at lai ching estate room 224
that the same room
you said you saw the killing
back then the neighours said
that the man kept on saying
killing without mercy
before he committed suicide
so the case happened 30 years ago
i also looked at the cctv footage
in the building that day
and found some abnormalities
ive also checked that wah phone
did make a call from sai kung that day
so i was really in the enchanted realm
i refuse to believe any of it
then how would you explain this
you saw a case from 30 years ago
because it was a projection
from your subconscious
there mustve been a signal jam in the cctv
so it was footage from another elebator
what about the phone call
the radio waves in sai kung are unstable
there might be an error in the data
so if you dont believe any of this
why are you helping me
wah taught me everything at the academy
he was my mentor
he called me on the day he went missing
but i was on a case so i didnt answer
so ive always wanted to know the reason
behind his disappearance
what i can do
is to follow every lead on this case
nam i know you dont believe me
but can you help me one last time
ive already helped you many last times
when did i ever refuse
a women went missing in the mountains
early this morning
the police speculates
that she fell off a cliff
this was the sixth disappearance from
the mountains in the past two months
according to information found on the scene
the lady who disappeared
is between 50-60 years old
son it been a while
since youve gone on a hike with your dad
let go on a family hike together okay
oh sure
when youre free tell your dad
when we were young we
never went to the mall
we would always go on hiking dates
we saw a snake one time
your dad was a big guy
but he was so terrified
i had to hold him the whole time
he absolutely useless
but when has your father ever been useful
vincent

did you think you can redeem yourself
by staying single
it too late
did you know how heartbroken
your mother was
she lost her husband
and she had to live with a sinner
like you everyday
if you came up hiking with me that day
i couldve gone home
i wouldnt have been here for seven years
because of a decision you made
i can never go back
and i can never see your mother
im sorry

ask yourself of all your sins
you made your mother lose her husband
and you killed your brother
with your own hands

your brother can never come into this world
all this happened because of you
you killed your brother 30 years ago
you killed me 7 years ago
are you still seeking redemption
yes i want to seek redemption
as long as youre gone
you cant hurt anyone around you
and people around you dont need to suffer
as long as you die
you can stay here with us forever
as long as you die
you can compensate for everything
this place is better than the real world
here you dont feel pain when you die
isnt it so tiresome being alive
just cut in there and youll be free
sister dont be afraid it wont hrt
ying
mom i killed my little brother
dont think this way
remember no matter how
hard we try sometimes
we cannot control the outcome
if i wasnt carelessly playing around
you wouldnt end up like this
we cannot control
the outcome of a lot of things
but we can control how we deal with it
youre still young
it okay if you dont understand
youll understand when youre older
remember you refused to
eat when you were young
you said eating would make you grow
youre afraid of growing up
and we wont love you anymore
we were at the park walking by the river
you saw your own reflection
in the river and you said
there was another you inside the river
and you wanted to save her
it okay if you couldnt find me
as long as you can find yourself
you understand
miss are you okay
miss are you okay miss
she fainted call the police
ying youre finally awake
have i been gone for long
i told you not to wander around
youre making me worry
mom im sorry
i wont wander off again
i never found out
whether my dad was in the enchanted realm
but im gonna stop fixating on this
because ive found the answers
i was looking for
ive never been back on
the mountain ever since
