i a beautiful
sunny afternoon
here in the cowboy state
weve got partly cloudy skies
clearing by sundown
and for you stargazers tonight
the geminid meteor shower
is set to put on
a once-in-a-lifetime show
between 600 pm and 200 am
so set your sights to the
north-northeast high in the sky
the national weather
service says temps
could dip into the mid-60s
so you have a beautiful night
to sit out with a sweetheart
kick back and put
something on the grill
and her a fun fact from
wyoming meteor research center
at hopkin air force base
only twice in
the showe history
have we seen a shower lasting
longer than two hours
and this one goes late
late into the night
so it sounds like i
going to be quite a show
dont go to bed early
and i didt know this but our
weather guy is saying to me
that these falling stars
are actually debris from
an asteroid that orbits the sun
every year-and-a half
i named how do you
pronounce this
fay-eh-thoon
phaethon is that it
sounds close enough
so we wot be able
to see that tonight but
plenty of shooting stars will
be dancing across the sky
keep it cool keep it fun
keep it safe
definitely be ready
for a fireworks display
from mother nature to go
with your rock n roll
currently 68 degrees and a
jam-packed line-up at kyos
what began as excitement
has turned to concern
in rural wyoming this morning
reports have been flooding
in from norad
and the international
space station
of some unusual activity
related to a meteor shower
mostly-viewable
in the northern u s
observatories around the
world are coordinating efforts
to assure the meteor that
made ground late yesterday
was one isolated incident
mount wilson observatory
in southern california
is closely monitoring
a group of 58 meteors
they want to reassure the public
that there is at this point
no cause for alarm and that
they are keeping a close eye
on the shower as it intensifies
notches road notches road
let me know when you see it
stand by for more
breaking news and reports
here on kyos wyoming
next dirt road on the right
why do meteors always land
in the middle of nowhere
i hate those country roads
i think we are here
00 years m like
my great-grandfather
built that barn you know
i all i have
i all the money i have
let see what
we got here huh
well let go say hi
how you doing guys
hello hi hi
officer pritchard
nice to meet you
kurt
yeah at first i thought
it was a jet
from the air force base
that caught on fire
or maybe it was a missile
that flew out of control
but until we got your call
to shelter in place
this town was in a panic
yeah well
tha understandable
a meteor traveling
0 times the speed of sound
will frighten anybody
so are you the poor woman that
just got her house destroyed
yeah
uh yeah
she was pretty shook up
but she keeps mentioning
how happy she is
that you guys are located
just a couple miles up the road
yeah are you the folks
that study the uh ufos
uh no
we actually study meteors
meredith this
is dr kurt siegel
h from the base
h their lead meteorologist
tha for weather brian
actually wre
called meteorists
those weather people
claimed that cool name
unfortunately
so here we are
oh yeah
i mean this was my house
i just put
in fresh juniper bushes
that explosion
even fried my radio
so do you mind
if we go ahead
and take a closer
look at things
yeah feel free
i a sad sight come on
all right this way
watch your step
just got to go around here
there too much damage
on the other side
all right now
watch your step here
i kinda tricky
here
okay
all right
so it came from right over here
and crashed the top of my house
and landed right over there
go ahead
here watch yourself
watch it
all right
watch your step
watch yourself
look at that
well this doest make sense
what
the size of it
i way too big
why
what did you expect
about a fraction of this
tha about six foot
what do you think mara
if this was the size
of an actual missile
what would it do
well geminids travel what
20000 or 30000 miles an hour
tha right
okay
well even without a payload
a small icbm
would generate the force
equivalent to a ton of tnt
i mean this size
speed
this whole town should be gone
shit
how do you explain that doc
im not sure
the only plausible explanation
is that this meteor
was traveling
at a much slower speed than
it should have
wll need a second opinion
on this
i gotta make a call
hey gwen it siegel
yes m at that crash site
there are a few things
that just dont add up here
i think we could really
use your expertise
oh youre on your way
good
because i need you and beth
down here stat
to run some element profiles
i cant figure out
for the life of me
how this thing survived
the atmosphere
or if there will be more
wre gonna need to dig
into this thing
i hope you have
your field kit
okay see you in a minute
she asked if we could take
the helicopter to save time
and i told her
wre not breaking
transport protocol ever again
please dot tell me
you taught her
how to fly a helicopter
i had a heart attack
when i found out
you taught her
how to fly a jet
boy i wish i had
a chauffer to fly me around
in a helicopter
title heavy weapons analyst
but yeah i can
get people where they need to go
from time to time
especially if they wanna
blow stuff up
my apologies
to be fair i did teach gwen
the basics of flying an f-35
and i told her
the next time wre up
she can take the controls
so is michael coming with her
michael no
i just her and beth
there here
yeah
gwen i understand
your husban
a hot shot colonel
now at the base
but we do still need you in
the field from time to time
sorry im late
beth is with us today
beth good to see you
yeah so no im late
because i had to start
the spectral imaging process
i told you that
was unnecessary gwen
my predictive models call
this a meteor shower
yeah well we should
talk about that
yeah we should
you gotta take a look at this
okay
kurt did you happen
to see all those dead birds
in the drive in this morning
yeah tha not uncommon
in a meteor shower
yeah no
but it seemed different
gwen what is it
beth would you mind
giving us a moment
thanks
kurt im telling you
im concerned
about this meteor
cloud density
if four objects aggregated
from the center
it could indicate
something much larger
more dangerous that
affecting them
gwen i understand
youre being cautious
because of russia but i ran
a complete threat matrix
and everything looked fine
yeah but what
if we were wrong about
phaeton disappearance
in that solar storm
after that asteroid
last perihelion
it never came back out
from behind the sun
that was the biggest solar
shower in decades
unless we just cat see it
cant see it
gwen no
gwen come on
the crate this way
beth
so gwen beth
this is brian
and next to him is meredith
the unfortunate home owner
hey brian meredith this
is our lead astrophysicist
oh my god
gwen armstrong
i read all about you
in wired magazine
looks like you have a fan
oh god m so sorry
about what happened to those
poor people who got injured
in chelyabinsk russia
thank you
ive read every single
one of your books seriously
when i saw it happen on
tv after your prediction
i felt so sad you know
and it said that the us
got the coordinates
completely wrong
and by the time they warned the
russians it was just too late
was that you
were you the one who got the
coordinates completely wrong
that was me
im sorry
sorry that it happened
thank you
thank you for your kind words
hey brian meredith
can i borrow you guys
for a second
i want you to tell me all
about what you saw
when that meteor struck yeah
hey mara why dot
you go radio base
and tell them wll be here
about another hour
copy that
you okay
yeah
i just want to get this sample
but if m being
completely honest
this whole russia thing
is still haunting me
sorry
i dont mean to dump
all of this on you
i know yore here
just to learn
uh dr armstrong
mm-hm
i dont mean
to overstep my bounds
but for what it worth
your theories are taught
all over the world
your husband michael
just got promoted
for helping redesign
a nuclear launch system
and you get to work
with him every day
if i even had a fraction
of those things
id think my life
was pretty incredible
thank you for all of that
okay i time to focus
on the task at hand huh
all right
so i need you to put these on
i want you to monitor the meteor
cloud as i take the sample
ive never done this before
you said you want to work
in this industry right
absolutely
well right now we need
to make sure that
this meteor shower
isnt a meteor storm
or something more dangerous
okay put these on
ill walk you through it
okay so the first setting
is just your basic telescope
that you look
through the lens
the second rendering
closes the aperture
and gives you a
real vr rendering
from the pentagon database
in real time
here you go
try that on
oh wow
this is incredible
i like m standing
above earth orbit
yeah pretty cool
and the third setting
just freezes the frame
and gives you
an interactive model
but you dont need to worry
about that right now
what i need from you is
to tell me if you see
meteor dust in the center
of that meteor cloud or
if it something solid
like an object
oh it kind of just
looks like a blob
like it keeps shifting
and changing around
but i cant really focus on it
okay
well reach out your hand
and pull up the menu bar
on the right hand side
squeeze your wrist
and open it up okay
and what is the density in the
center of that meteor cloud
um six objects
per square mile
six
yes it says six
do you remember
how to do a process
yeah i can do that
okay okay
okay
there you go
hey gwen
wha the eta on that sample
uh 30 seconds
okay
i dont understand why
he keeps rushing you
maybe if hed given
you more time on
your spectral imaging
theory in russia
all of those people wouldt
have gotten hurt
no i had enough time
but your spectral
imaging theory revolutionized
the way we do things
in the industry i mean
do you remember
that asteroid
that we found off
the observatory in hawaii
yeah it was 40000 miles
off of earth
mm-hm
well we found it
because of kurt algorithms
h the best
at projecting algorithms
wha that process say
59% iron and 3% silicates
both iron and silicates
are fully crystallized
but if dr siegel
ran his algorithm tests
on something better
something worthwhile
like the braeburg effect
i dont think that
anton braeburg is someone
that you should want to
model your career after
h kind of a laughing stock of
the science community right now
okay
hey what the core
temperature
400 degrees
are you sure
yeah it says 400
um okay
wve got to take
another sample
that cat be right
hey gwen how we coming
on that sample
uh 30 seconds
what is that gwen
i a composite drill
i a a combination of a
diamond and a laser
it can cut through anything
wve got to get this back
to base immediately
you okay
yeah
hey guys
ams site just
reported meteor made ground fall
2 miles due south
we gotta go come on
we have to get to base now
this is much worse
than we thought
ill check in with nws
no
oh no
you okay
im fine im fine
just get us out of here go
get us out of here
where gwen
where gwen
gwen
gwen
come on
kurt
where did you get this car
owner got killed
by a meteorite
go go go
no
oh no
beth is back there
no beth
beth is back there
we gotta go back
beth is gone gwen
gwen beth is gone
leave her
damn it
there no signal
there no signal anywhere
mara what do you got
what do you know
last update i got
was one minute ago
meteor strike outside of dublin
this thin global
oh my god
do you have anything
no the network jammed
you know what
let me try the satellite radio
oh my god
reverse reverse
go back
go go go
go
good good good
mara
okay that was close
everybody take a breath
wre okay
we made it
okay you okay
yeah
guys if the ground fall
spans the entire hemisphere
there no way the pentagon got
off a full response no way
you know there
definitely gonna add
a level five nuke strike
for good measure
probably
well if theyve
already launched level five
then were too late
because those meteors
will detonate those nukes
long before ill reach
the asteroid
then well have nothing
left to destroy it
what about nasa jpl gss
theve had to have
seen something
no one can see it
i hidden inside
the meteor cloud remember
i the needle in a haystack
i know
hey we just need to get there
and we need to tell them
to stop a level five
stop a level five
there not gonna react to us
there gonna think were giving
flawed data because of russia
and if we need proof
we dot have it
so what are we gonna do
i dont know mara
this contradicts
my entire threat matrix
im at a loss
gwen help me out
okay first things
first okay
we have to make sure that
they launch the emod okay
the evacuations meteor shield
the ordinance and
the orbital drones okay
and then kurt you know what
i want you to take that this
flag the center of the mass
in the meteor cloud
mark it as an apb and
let all the departments know
at least thatll give
them a fighting chance
at least of iding it
i got it got it
okay good
okay keep driving
and level five
as far as level five
kur right
there not gonna delay
a threat response
and if we want them
to stop the launch then
the data needs
to come from somebody else
someone like michael
h now lieutenant colonel
and h got
nuclear defense clearances
yeah but even if the order
comes down from him
he still has to get vetted
by singh wh at base
yeah and singh not stupid
h gonna know that order
is coming from you gwen
not if he breaks
the chain of command
and goes straight
to the pentagon okay
there no vetting there no
agencies there no red tape
michael still blames
me for russia gwen
h gonna think your
breaking protocol
to save time for some
back intel i gave you
look we all know
whose fault russia was
it wasnt yours
i love him but today h
just gonna have to get over it
yeah well what if
michael unable to do it
well if he unable to do
it then you know what
im going to take
the spec rendering
straight to the colonel
straight to the
command room right at base
right
we have to stop
this launch okay
so just get us to the base
and ill get the proof
yes maam
wll get you there
michael
gwen
there a two-mile
wide asteroid hidden inside
this meteor storm
wve got approximately
two hours and 29 minutes
until it hits
any nuclear response needs to
be saved to strike the asteroid
gwen you know
i cant do that
colonel singh has to approve
any protocol changes
i mean i can
flag incoming threats
on the defense database system
but i need a commanding
officer to clear it
but none of the other agencies
can see the asteroid
michael this is the worst
case scenario
the only reason i know
i there is because
i was able to examine
this mornin meteorite
what is that
meteor debris
shouldnt be that big
it is
oh my gosh
i creating a dust cloud
keep going
keep driving
no no no no no
damn it
oh no
oh no
are you okay
wha going on
yeah yeah im okay
i just that our
vehicle stalled
meteor debris
choked out the engine
oh no
damn it
well let go fix it
okay
okay okay
what do you think it is
i the belt chain
belt chain
okay
gwen you gotta get
out of there right now
this meteor storm is escalating
the dod has already approved
a level five launch
and there gonna be a meteor
shower right in your area
get out
michael listen to me
i cant stop this nuke strike
but you can
defense protocols
are cleared
for rank lieutenant colonel
and above
okay call general ambrose
at the pentagon
and tell him it was
you who personally
identified this
as an asteroid
we have to save the nukes
for the asteroid
im not gonna lie
to a commanding officer
it ist a lie
i a mass inside a cloud
that you or anyone
can see easily on radar
it just hast been
ided as an asteroid yet
the observatories
cant tell what it is
and the dod isnt
listening to me
is this from some intel
that mara gave you
no michael
you can confirm it personally
i as if youve captured
the dimensions
through
spectral imaging okay
youre asking me to stop a
nuclear strike in mid-launch
wre gonna leave
the whole planet
vulnerable to
a meteor storm
if you launch that strike
this storm will detonate
every one of those nukes
before it reaches the asteroid
only use conventional weapons
on the meteors
the drones have plasma
cannons that can melt tanks
and the satellite missiles
well there bunker busters
and the meteor shield
is woven crystallized carbon
and if the nukes strike
in the upper atmosphere
wre talking fallout
on a global scale
at its current heading
the nukes will strike it
right outside the mesosphere
fallout will be high enough just
like any other nuclear test
gwen
i could go to prison
for the rest of my life
we both could
there no time
break the chain of command
okay
you have to stop this launch
michael you have to believe me
wha our mark
two hours 6 minutes
south-southwest
i love you
i love you
so yore a mechanic
tha nice
i got it
you got it
right
yeah come on
this just in the
geological society of america
is now weighing in on
the growing threat of what
is now being called a
meteor storm
reported gravitational anomalies
and impact zones
are stirring up
geologic activity
including hot zones of volcanic
activity in our national parks
carbon dioxide monoxide and
methane levels in the atmosphere
are spiking nationwide
this is beginning to impact
the wildlife in the area
with reported injuries
and deaths being seen
as far north as canada
the department of defense
is involved as well as the un
and nato in preparation for
a potential nuclear strike
on the meteor storm
standby by for
further instructions
from the emergency
broadcast system
and in the meantime
please remain indoors
wyoming
i just received a terminate
signal from you
hang on
im putting you on com
there had better be a
good reason for this
sir this is lieutenant
colonel michael armstrong sir
under colonel singh in wyoming
i have full confirmation
of an incoming neo
backed by radar gss
incoming coordinates outlined
by radar are as follows
tha id number 3200 phaeton
vector southwest sir
sir we need to stop level five
countdown immediately
and retain as a defense
against the asteroid
we did not copy lieutenant
repeat we did not copy
i repeat
we have an incoming neo
it will strike in t-minus
two hours 6 minutes sir
we are aware of the
meteor storm lieutenant
however your alarm regards
a global response
is this signed off
by colonel singh
colonel singh is
responding directly
to a situation
in the field sir
but i have direct orders
from the colonel
to terminate level five sir
lieutenant we have
all emods active
terminate level five sir
we are confirmed on
the meteor threat lieutenant
i re
abort le five sir
level five abort
do you copy general
we are initiat
nice of you to join us
lieutenant armstrong
apologies sir
it wot happen again
daniels what the status
on the meteor shower
incoming
vector 20 delta 909 kentucky
incoming
vector 99 epsilon 30
south dakota
washington confirms
drones are in place
meteor shield deployed
orbital missiles engaged
level five strike at
t minus three minutes
we have a terminate
switch active
on our global response sir
is this accurate
this phon dead
get me ambrose on the line
yes sir
this is gonna be a long
day daniels
armstrong what the status
on that phone
it is working on it sir
we should be back up
in a few minutes
we are still on track
for launch
nuclear response in t minus
2 minutes 30 seconds
even if we cat get in touch
with the pentagon
we are following our last
known orders
daniels check the targeting
array is still aligned
sir we have a
full system crash
in the western half of the us
colonel we just severed
our apparatus to the pentagon
our missile systems for the
whole region are failing
sir what did you do
lieutenant armstrong
step away from the com
and disarm now
private daniels get dod
back online
to initiate that
launch right now
sir all of our coms are down
our landline and
backup feed are down
lieutenant colonel armstrong
crashed the system sir
subdue him now
get the system back online
daniels get me communication
with the pentagon now
i our new
guidance system sir
armstrong cut off
half the country
and a meteor just struck our
bas satellite dish sir
okay repair the dish and
run an auxiliary patch
straight to our ground lines
you may have just killed
millions of people
stick him in holding
or ll kill him myself
colonel i had no choice but
to cancel the level five
you just severed our
defenses to a global threat
i confirm when to call off a
nuclear strike
i will skin him alive for this
sir emod live
and engaging targets
all nuclear
capable countries have confirmed
participation level five
give me a level five mark
we are live
targe engaged
okay
give me a real time kill ratio
keep me appraised level five
standing by for kill ratio
and level five standing by
have we restored communication
with the pentagon
eta 30 seconds sir
emod kill ration at 6%
and climbing 7% 8%
gwen check with vr
see wha happening
did the meteor shield deploy
mm-hmm
looks like we still have
incoming meteors
level five launch
in t minus 30 29
28 27
26 25
gwen
the meteors are still
coming through
wha going on
out there
all batteries are deployed
defense systems are firing
but tha not enough
oh shoot
8 7 6
5 4 3 2
phalanx one through four down
phalanx eight through 2 down
launch orthogonal 90 degrees
sir nuclear assets
in the entire
western hemisphere are offline
it seems like
theve been crashed
from a program out of wyoming
do we have backup
launch backup as soon
as it live
gwen wha
the status on that response
only 2% of the meteors
have been destroyed
twelve percent
still no sign of
the nukes
east coast backup system
is restored
t minus 0 and launch
east coast is go
russia is go
india is go
us arsenal 50%
no
no no no no
what what what
what is it
the nukes
theve detonated the nukes
i have vr confirmation
that theyve launched
from the east coast along with
all the other nuclear countries
this is dr armstrong
come in
wha our percentage of
airborne nuclear missiles
50%
all other countries have
launched their full arsenal
orbital weapons
all ordinance and drones
are completely destroyed
wve also lost four out of 20
of our communication satellites
the only thing we have left
is the shield sir
yeah
michael why did you let
them launch the nukes
dr armstrong your husband
has been arrested
for a breach of
national security
his attempt to take down
the nuclear guidance system
was stopped but we were only
able to fire half our payload
colonel sir
i assure you that michael was
just forwarding the message
if yore involved in
any way in any of this
you will never see
light of day again
now return to base immediately
and report to me in command
michael been arrested
and singh wants me to report
to the command center
as soon as we arrive
but you cant report to singh
if he has you arrested
youre done
wre all done
mar absolutely right
i can run predictive
algorithms all day long
but spectral imaging that is
your area of expertise gwen
by the time i compile the data
it would be too late
her what were gonna do
as soon as we arrive
at the security checkpoint
i want you to report
your injuries
under code blue they cannot
arrest any injured personnel
right
thell definitely have
mps looking for you
all over the medical bay
i imagine they will but ll
find my way to the lab okay
ill get the proof and ll
meet singh in command center
got it
defense alarm
hey what have we got
no
no no no
the strike is complete sir
all nuclear weapons
from all countries
have detonated in orbit sir
wha our kill percentage
25% sir
what
tha not possible
meteor shield taking
heavy fire sir
sir the entire shiel
coming apart
son of a bitch
im good im good im good
let go where is everybody
why are there no guards
i protocol to secure
all personnel
inside the facility
during a launch
looks like the cameras
are down thanks michael
code blue
where the or
or why
what happened
please
ive lost a lot of blood
how what happened
i was hit by a meteor
come on
we dot have time
where do you need to go
or
come on
code orange is now in effect
all medical personnel report
to your designated
emergency response locations
im all right
im all right
oh god i should wrap this up
yeah im okay
dont worry about me
give us a minute please
thank you
im fine im fine
just get the gauze

i all right
just a quick wrap
we gotta go
i know
mara you sure
youre all right
im fine
hey thank you
yeah
we have to go talk
to colonel singh
are you okay
yeah
let go see singh
okay all right
let get you going
pop up
where the screen here
there
all right so
tha good
and these coordinates
nine
okay
this database
around the meteor cloud
the density
let find you
officer pritchard
dr siegel
colonel singh sir
as soon as the storm passes
we will be disbanding
your department
the incoming is so heavy
we can barely get damage
report from the field
colonel sir
dr armstrong thought
the threat was big enough
she doesnt give orders
i give orders
where is gwen armstrong
sir she left us as soon
as we arrived
well she needs to be here
at this com
to be questioned
by me personally
people are dead
and dying dr siegel
sir
officer pritchard
sir ve been working
the field with dr armstrong
for over seven years now
and her input concerning
this storm
is critical to our survival
mm-hm
im aware of your work
with dr armstrong
her husband hast
been shy about reporting
your failures in russia
here
there
there you are
there you are
yep i knew it
okay okay
yep
you know what
gwen armstrong has been flagged
as a national security risk
and i cannot have her
wandering this base
colonel sir you must
let her complete her testing
before you speak
dr siegel i respect you
and im trying
to respect your team
but after the russia incident
and today failed
orbit defense
you are no longer cleared
to advise this base
are you with me
where the power reserve
the last impact carried
an electromagnet pulse
the reserve power
offline sir
engineering en route
right now to repair it
and the communications
engineering running
a dedicated line
to both the dish
and the command center
that goes all the way to dc
engineering doing
their best right now
sir please
detaining gwen
is a grave mistake
no one is more steeped in
this research than she is
we are dealing with
global threats right now
not on gwen armstrong latest
free-association
youre team is relieved
i an asteroid
i have proof
undeniable proof
i just needed to wait
for the information
to come in to create
a spectral image
there over 00 observatories
the observatories
cant see it
and it wot show up on radar
until it emerges out of
meteor cloud that covering
and then it gonna hit earth
i dont see how
a rainbow reflected back
from a meteor cloud can create
an image like this doctor
we kept picking up
a dense section on our radar
it failed to yield
anything definitive
but i knew that something
was acting on these meteors
slowing them down
so i took a sustained
spectrometer reading and
there it is
so yore telling us
this asteroid
is cloaked
by its own meteor shower
this is the sun okay
during it last perihelion
phaeton was knocked off course
causing it to go back
into the meteor trail
when it finally caught
up with the meteors
it exerted its own
gravitational force
causing the meteors to slow down
and making them safe
to actually enter into
our own atmosphere
which is what causing
the meteor storm outside
so even if we were to
destroy all of the meteors
we still have a 26-mile
asteroid to destroy
where will it strike
difficult to say
which is why dr siegel
has run a sequencing
algorithm kurt
its trajectory places
it on the northernmost tip
of manitoba 538 miles
west of the bay
fortunately i was able
to upload its vector
to a priority list before
the last power outage
i far from
a populated area
that doest matter sir
the force will be equivalent
to one million hiroshimas
so that why you fought
so hard to stop level five
exactly
now with what we have
we need a surgical response
surgical
mara
we have about
2000 warheads left
at 50 megatons each
tha 00000 megatons
50000 per stage of attack
good
so it hast reached
a million megatons yet
we need to use half
of our remaining nukes
to dissipate the meteor cloud
then shoot the other
half straight
at the asteroid to destroy it
sir were back online
all systems are active
daniels you need to get
joe ambrose on the phone
and you go get your husband
copy that
michael
oh my god
what are you doing here
oh god
i was so scared
i was so afraid
you got hurt out there
is there any update
they need you in command
wve proven that
there an asteroid
is colonel singh working
with the pentagon
he is and he needs
you and me the entire team
come on
let go
let go
sir we just
received a priority alert
on the data cloud
so has every other
major observatory
across three continents
who sending this out
nasa jpl ams and fema
just forwarded it
from our base in wyoming
i a live vectoring model
what do the vectors target
we dot know sir
i a field sir
with precise measurements
28 miles
3 miles 262
i have ambrose
on the line sir
ah
general ambrose
i colonel singh wyoming
our research team just confirmed
a million megaton sir
mm-hm
we have a near earth object
with all intel
uploaded to dod data
general
wre calling for a two-stage
phew
general we have to
launch these missiles now
phaeton gravitation field is
accelerating the meteor shower
i only gonna get worse
this whole place
is gonna blow
sir wyoming has been hit
without the orbital shield
phaetho projecting
meteors straight at us
do we have any communication
sir we have a signal but
it keeps cutting in and out
colonel singh wouldt
have called
unless he was requesting
a severe response
keep working to get the
remaining of our nukes operable
copy that sir
all right the main
evacuation rout is this way
come on
oh we cat leave until
we make sure that ambrose
has the proper information
we cat stay gwen
the base has been compromised
i too dangerous
come on
i need to see this through
okay im not leaving until
im sure that
there gonna launch everything
according to plan
sir come on
we have to evacuate
to washington now
gwen we need to leave now
please
michael no
you okay
yeah yeah
okay where do we go
okay
all right we need to exit back
through the command room
come on
okay let go
you okay
yeah you
michael wher
the control room
straight this way
all right
wll go through the wall
wre not going
through that wall
tha solid concrete
six inches thick
wll cut straight
through with this hm
almost there
you through
yep
go for it
here goes nothing
yep
good
nice job
the roo collapsed here too
we can get there through
the annex bridge
okay
yeah
thanks
this way
wyoming
go for ambrose
general this is
gwen armstrong
do you have a
confirmed target
i an asteroid sir
two-square miles
ive sent you all
the data
what is the eta to impact
one hour and 5 minutes
the strike requires
a two-step response
50% into the meteor cloud
and 50% directly into
the asteroid
no gwen
whoa
babe you okay
yeah yeah yeah you
yeah
go get to the entrance
mara go go go go
just get to the entrance
ill come
colonel go
go just go go
help the others
im right behind you
gwen come on baby
okay okay wre coming
oh man
come on
gwen come on
here take my hand
come on let go of the bag
no
i can lift you
i shoulve listened
to you from the start
oh
all right
ladies and gentlemen
our two-mile wide field
is an incoming asteroid
sir are we talking
about the one
that disappeared behind the sun
phaeton
tha affirmative
we need to use the rest
of our nukes
on a stage-two
level five response
we need to set our
targeting system
so that the first wave
of nukes all hit
the exact same spot
of the meteor cloud
that will create a compound
wave to dissipate the cloud
and reveal the bigger asteroid
so we can target it
tha brilliant sir
this is gwen armstron plan
and yes it is
sir we just lost two more
communication satellites
but we do have communication
with other surviving bases
prepare for the first wave
yes sir
stand by
level five
level five is go
level five is go
level five is go
50% response go
heat signature at 4% 2%
sir it working
the cloud is beginning
to dissipate
heat signature one percent
level five stage two
target that asteroid
50% go
the asteroid is still intact
the nukes were ineffective sir
they were unable to make
contact with target
damn it
impact estimated
at 38 minutes
make sure the president
congress
and joint chiefs of
staff are evacuated
to the doomsday bunker
yes sir
we are now being informed
that the mission
to destroy the incoming
asteroid was unsuccessful
a general evacuation order
has been issued
for the entire east coast
of the united states
wve also received word
that the presiden motorcade
is being redirected to the raven
rock bunker in pennsylvania
god help us all
gwen
gwen
no we have to go
no wre not having another
russia incident
michael with all due respect
you were not there
she did what she was
supposed to be doing
did she she had 5 minutes
before that order came in
to ground those planes
gwen are you okay
i gave her
the orders michael
it was my fault okay
we were supposed
to meet kurt in russia
im the one that told her
to stay behind
it was my fault michael
she stayed because of me
well they didnt have to
pin the whole thing on you
michael
okay how much time
do we have left gwen
we have 34 minutes
and we already launched
phase one and phase two
of the nukes right
so what plan b guys
plan b is we make
our way to the airfield
about a mile from here
now there two birds
on the ground
we evac to safety all of us
no no no
wre not gonna evacuate yet
look there could be
a solution here
i a long shot
but it could work
the braeburg effect
braeburg
come on gwen enough of that
you know he a laughing
stock of our community
okay but kurt
listen to me okay
the last few hours
ive been noticing
that all this meteor impact
has displaced methane
into the atmosphere
when you add
an electrical force to methane
it turns into plasma vapor
now the tests i took this
morning of that meteor
it proves that it
has magnetic force
so if we somehow find
6000 megawatts of electricity
and create an electrical arc
up into the atmosphere
it could actually displace
that electromagnetic force
and then
and the nukes
and the meteors
and the asteroid all
crashing together
yes and destroy them
okay i understand that
but where are we gonna get that
power that wattage
we dot have that
there a power plant
not far from the airfield
can we use that
yes but we would
need some sort of
a massive controlled
explosion
exactly
one of those f-35s has
to be stocked with missiles
okay okay
let go to the hangar
let go let go
okay let get
to the airfield
let go
come on come on
okay the base
is through the field
for those of you at home
or hopefully
having found shelter
we have an update
from pentagon officials
raging fires are widespread
throughout north america
as a result of
the massive meteor shore
hundreds of thousands of home
have been damaged or destroyed
injuries and deaths are
estimated to be in the hundreds
the national weather service is
now reporting that this storm
is due to a
gravitational slowdown
from inside of the meteor cloud
caused by
two-mile-wide phaethon asteroid
which is due to impact
earth within the hour
come on guys
come on come on
come on
let go come on
let go let go let go
come on move it move it
let go kurt come on
whoa
come on come on
let go
this way this way
whoa
okay i can see it
another 300 yards
and wre there
let go come on
move move move
keep moving
keep moving
down down down
get down down
are you okay
yes
you okay
yeah
okay okay
mara you scour this field
find that jet
let just pray
that puppy is armed
with striking capabilities
i got it
now this incoming
wre experiencing
i can only imagine
is gonna get worse
so kurt you go with her
you ensure her success okay
yeah
okay
copy that
all right
gwen and i are gonna
locate a power source
the transformer is on
the other side of the
airfield due west
okay perfect
meet back here
okay go go go
gwen come on
okay go go
go go
okay okay
gwen come on
there
there it is
i see it let go
okay
okay go
okay hand me the ipad gwen
all right
oh god
you okay
yeah
okay
here you go michael
hold it
okay
you got it
yeah
okay
oh
please make this fast okay
im trying im trying
im trying
wre in
okay
okay
my security clearance should
give me access to the main grid
okay im redirecting
all kilowatts
within a 00-mile radius
to transformer 47
okay 47
what are those coordinates
michael
give me a minute
ah
are you okay
are you having fun yet doc
am i having fun
youre crazy
come on come on mara
come on
come on mara
almost there come on
okay youre okay
there the entrance
to the hangar
let go go go go
gotem
sending to you now
okay great
you gotem
plugging those in the equation
let see if this works
put that here
put this
so with that frequency
those coordinates
that dimension
at that speed
what do you got baby
this is gonna work
michael it gonna work
okay
come on gwen come on
we gotta go
let go
wre gonna have
to taxi this jet
yeah
who the chauffer now
mara
there no missiles
there no missiles
we gotta go tell em
let go tellem
come on
come on
damn it
come on
mara kurt
f-35 end of the tarmac
0% fuel
i okay
gwen there no missiles
shit
um
tha it
what
i over
there nothing we can do
there got to be
okay
there nothing
left we can do
the jet becomes the missile
by taking off
the jet becomes the missile
i just take off and fly it
straight up into the air
and come down at mach speed
to that electrical plant
and hit it right in the
center
gwen what are
you talking about
no on getting
inside that jet
tha a suicide mission
and you know what
there gotta be another way
youre not thinking straight
no
no on getting into that jet
i over
just get me into the sat com
ill figure it out
just link to help me back up
with the nukes
okay you can do that
through the computer
here we go
the fuel is at 0%
gwen gwen
gwen gwen
michael stop she gone
her best bet will be
to parachute into an open field
we gotta get to an open field
we gotta get to an open field
come on le go
move it
let go find an open field
come on come on
initiate flight sequencing
on engaged
engine one on
flight time three minutes
let do this
okay come here
she gotta land here okay
this is the only spot
that she can land
all right
gwen do you copy
i read you five
by five michael
engine engaged
sir our radar is
detecting an object
moving the speed of sound
flying up out of wyoming
do we have an id on it
no
we dot know
what it is yet sir
starting ascent
gwen
come in gwen
gwen come in
looks like it one of ours
sir an f-35
one minute three seconds
t-minus  minute
engaging f35 dive
in 5 4
3 2  now
gwen you get outta there
you make sure you get
outta there gwen
gwen do you copy
make sure you get outta there
come on gwen
45 seconds
im getting high level
radiation warnings
damn it come on
really starting to feel
the gs here
ejecting in 0 9
eight seven six
five
four
three
gwen do you copy
one
they did it
the target
the target has been neutralized
you heard correctly
ladies and gentlemen
the asteroi been destroyed
wre clear
wre all clear
oh my god
lieutenant armstrong
we can confirm
phaeton has been eliminated
is your wife all right
where is she
where is she
gwen
lieutenant armstrong
do you copy
where is she
general this is dr siegel
no sign of her yet
where is she
there
we have a visual on
dr armstrong sh alive
she made it
woo woo
she coming in for a landing
oh
hey doc
youre crazy
i had to
what was the probability
of that happening huh
we did it
youre crazy youre crazy
you did it
dr braeburg
shh the world doest
need to know
the world needs to know
no no no
no the world is safe now
kurt mara
woo woo
what a team
well done colonel sir
