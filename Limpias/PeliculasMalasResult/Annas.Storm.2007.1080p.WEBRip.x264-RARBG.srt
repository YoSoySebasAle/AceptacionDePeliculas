eggs or oatmeal
for breakfast this morning
she told me
not only to skip breakfast
but that i should
stay in bed all day
which is why i drove
straight to work
of course
then i heard a report
of a meteorite
hitting a gas field
on the east coast
and i can see online
that another one
has just slammed into
a farmhouse in kansas
maybe i should have stayed
in bed after all

it doesnt matter
this is an emergency
i hear the new doctor
very well trained
the new doctor
is one person
anna i havent treated
any patients in half a year
ricky death
was not your fault
i dont know that
maybe it was something i did
or didnt do
you want to look
for blame
well then
why dont you start
with the driver
of the truck
he was the one
who didnt like
the song on his radio
so he took his eyes
off the road
so he could
change the station
or how about the owner
of the minimart
where he got
his coffee that morning
maybe
he watered it down
or what about me
i was the one
that wouldnt let ricky
out of the house
until he double knotted
his laces
that took
20 seconds jack
20 seconds he could have used
to get across the road
there are people
who are hurt right now
who might die
if you dont walk back
into the er and help them
tyler is one of them
who do you think
ricky would want
treating his best friend
what is going on here
i told you to prep
warm saline dressing
and start an iv line
maam im sorry
but family waits out front
and let get some meds
on board
and why didnt anyone tell me
this man not responding
to the atropine
give him another milligram

in colorado alone
what caused it
hard to say
meteors are flying around us
all the time
they just dont usually
get close enough
to be sucked in
by the earth gravity
why didnt they burn up
in the atmosphere
same reason
the shuttle
doesnt burn up
on its way home
speed
and the iron content
of these stones
theyre mostly metal
they come in like cluster bombs
with no warning
nasa tracks only 7%
of near-earth objects
these are part of
the 93% they dont
is it over
no anna
it just beginning
an alert been issued
across the entire
western united states
for the next three hours
what am i supposed to do
what protocol
for a meteor storm
activate
your disaster plan
already did that
tell people to stay indoors
away from windows
and
hope it passes you by
tyler on 00% o2
and o2 sat is at 92
he has partial thickness burns
on his right arm
several lacerations
on his chest
bp 90 over 60

the building was hit
really hard anna
there a lot of people
trapped
can we get them out
were going to do
our best
here anna
put this on
this way anna
weve got leaks
in the gas main
when pockets of gas build up
anything can set them off
a spark static electricity
even a cell phone
is gas building up
in the cafe
i dont know
were going to put
a sniffer down who can reach
there a door
around the corner
at the end of the hall
it leads to the back stairs
down to the cafe
if we can clear a path
we should be able to reach them
emily down there isnt she
well do everything we can
i give you my word
got a reading
off the sniffer yet
down this way
here where
the stairs would be
but the upper floors collapsed
my god
carl anna
gas is seeping in
were going to have to
dig them out
we cant risk it
we cant
if we throw off one spark
and the whole place blows
and you know
what happens
to those people
when the oxygen
gets displaced
at 20% gas
they get dizzy
at 40% theyll vomit
at 60%
they are dead
can we shut off the flow
to the neighborhood
all the shut-off valves
are underground
i wouldnt know
where to look
who would
public works
i dont understand
why cant you do
the surgery here
because
were not surgeons
this isnt a trauma center
youve been saying that
all afternoon
we dont have an or
or an anesthesiologist
then you bring
those people here
we cant
the roads are closed
there is no access
look we are still hoping
for a helicopter
and where is it
doug
anna working on it
right now
excuse me
i have
another patient
jack
ill be right there
be honest with me
without surgery
she only has a couple of hours
so youre saying
that if i have
something to say to her
i need to say it now
miriam
douglas
can we help you chief
can i talk to you
for a minute
miriam is injured
this is not a good time
weve got a big problem
there a gas leak in town
well im sure
the fire department
can figure out
how to shut off a valve
it a main valve
that leaking
douglas
im not on duty
im afraid youre going
to have to be
people lives are at stake
would you step outside
please sheriff
i will not leave my wife
you dont have
a choice
put him in the van
dont touch me
dont take another step
clint
anna let me
handle this
he refusing
to safeguard the public
in a crisis
you activated
the security plan
you ought to know
its provisions
stop
clint i want you to leave
the hospital
i want to talk
to douglas alone
i will handle this
it doesnt
look good anna
if we dont get her
off this mountain
i know
ive got marty and jason
working on a medivac
douglas i am so sorry
about the timing of this
but i need you
to come to the cafe
and turn off the gas
you cant ask me
to leave my wife
to go help people
who wouldnt help me
im not asking you
to help them
there are other people
who are trapped down there
and theyre running
out of time
emily one of them
douglas
hey baby
im right here
im right here
douglas go
there are
six regulator stations
for the town
the one that handles this area
is right here
it chestnut street
now to shut this sector off
from inside the station
takes electricity
can we bring in a generator
no not with
unmapped leaks in the line
it just not safe
so i got to get down
to the manual shut-off valve
down in the sewer
once i cut the flow
well need to burn off
whatever gas
is left in the line
so any businesses
that are supplied
at 2 psi and above
they should turn
their gas on full
that the bakery
the diner and the lodge
what if we get everyone
in the area to burn off gas
that a good idea
we could get into that cafe
faster
let go
carl im in over
it going up too fast carl

ive upped him
2 milligrams morphine

through this jack isnt he
he inhaled
a lot of smoke
until he breathing
on his own again
and his oxygen levels come up
i cant be sure
he needs some time
on the ventilator
he had his heart so set
on that camping trip
every day
he would pull out the book
with the trees and the birds
a map to the sky

when ricky died
i didnt know
what to do or say

you were the first one
to come over
and the last one
to leave every night
you answered the phone for us

when people started flooding in

on the stove
emily was never alone

okay
this is
mayor anna davenport
talking to you
from our emergency
broadcast station
kcxn 60 radio
at 45 this afternoon
our town was hit
by a shower of small meteorites
less than an hour later
more rocks fell
the damage has been severe
but localized
both the power plant
has been hit
knocking out most of the
electricity in the county
weve got a broken water
main
and are being advised
to boil water
before drinking it
or just drink bottled water
until further notice
there have been some
casualties and many
injuries
dr ryan and dr baxter
are at the hospital
treating patients
but they need blood
every type and a lot of
it
so if you can
please come in and give
for those of you who cannot
stay in your homes
or dont want to be
alone
were setting up
a temporary shelter
at the cottonwood
community church
millie wildflower will be
coordinating efforts there
for those of you
who are afraid
that more rocks may fall
and are thinking about
getting out of town
well that
no longer possible
one of the impacts took out a
piece of highway 40
about six miles
down the mountain
even if you could
get off the mountain
it wouldnt keep you safe
there have been reports
of rocks falling
all over colorado
with an alert
for continued activity
in the sky
so what are we left to
do
where do we turn
when we cannot run
i hope to each other
dont wait to hear from
me
look in on your neighbor
share whatever food and water
you have
it comes from the bible
two are better than one
for if they fall
one will lift the other up
and a three-fold rope
is not easily broken
we are a town of 900
we are not easily broken either
seth
seth
there is one last thing
id like to say
seth
im the mayor of cottonwood
but im also a mother
emily wherever you are
please keep yourself safe
please sweetie be safe
my daughter emily
is missing
if anyone knows where she
is
please come to the hospital
and let us know
and em if you can hear me
i love you
and i will find you
all the way to the right
ease off the clutch
keep it going
that it
okay that it
im out
emily
emily emily
emily
seth
em
seth i did it
i got you out
god
no
my god
im so sorry
better
yes
how his blood gas
his c-o-2 is 49
and his p-h is 7-3-2
natalie can you resecure
his et tube
yes doctor
im thinking of upping
his vent rate
yeah i wouldnt
recommend that
why not
well he already had
a tension pneumo
a slightly low o-2 level
wont kill him
but if we blow out
his other lung
id leave his
airway pressure down
when i was at sc
i was working on a study
on permissive hypocapnia
in kids with chest trauma
there were many fewer
lung complications
why havent i
seen this study
it still underway
hasnt been published yet
look i know
it goes against your gut
it went against mine too
until i saw the early results
but it what tyler needs
how long have you been
out of residency doctor
three years why
you know when i said
a hundred years experience
can be a helpful number
three can be helpful too
let do it
thank you for coming
what are you
doing here
you asked the citizens
of this town to give blood
im here to give blood
im sorry

my back up
around me

franny

was she going
she didnt say
she didnt say
they didnt say
she was with seth
you scan ill drive

i put a tracking device
on seth car

invasion of privacy

why wouldnt they
have called
a cell doesnt get
reception up here
theyd need to have
a radio
they must have know
that something happening
they would have tried
to get back to town
maybe they thought
it was safer up here
maybe they tried to get back
and they couldnt
theyve had an accident
or theyve been
struck by rocks
would you keep
those thoughts to yourself
why is it our kids
cant stand to be apart
and we cant stand
to be together
weve never even had
a civil conversation
what do you want to talk about
well did seth say anything
this morning
we had some words
not about emily
about his mother
i didnt know molly very well
we were always friendly
when we saw each other in town
i know
i never really understood
why she left
i know that too
she said
she didnt want
to live in a small town
the rest of her life
called it provincial
hopeless
she didnt think about her son
who had his friends here
or the husband with a job here
i dont begrudge her
her ambition
i just wish shed
told me before we had seth
so did emily say
anything to you
nothing
she wouldnt even speak to me
she so angry
because i want to move too

so did you
yeah i wrote her a letter

no thought you might like
to read it first
that none of my business
dad i want you to know
how i feel about her
i want you to know
what it says
why
because we should know that
about each other shouldnt we
do you still
love her
yes i do
would you take her back
no i wouldnt
do you love her
she hasnt earned that
would you give her a chance to
yeah i would
well good
we both know
how we feel about your mom now
put a stamp on that envelope
seal it shut and mail it
yes sir
ill get you another ice pack
doctor weve got a problem
bed 4 coding
we need the crash cart
and a defibrilator now
find doug
keep him in the waiting room
im seeing cardiac arrest
i got nothing
start cpr
anna it tad
can you hear me
anna
mom
she not responding
anna i want you
to listen to me
the rocks that have been falling
over the last few hours
we now know that theyre debris
from a single larger meteor
heading our way
your way or mine
the computer models put impact
in eastern routt county
just north of highway 40
in other words mine
what going to happen
as it hits the atmosphere
youre going to hear
a tremendous sonic boom
louder than any youve heard
so far
the sky above you
will turn blindingly bright
and then
listen
im not gonna kid you anna
if it hits it like
an atomic bomb going off
total devastation
at impact site
with significant damage
up to 500 miles away
what do you mean if it hits
it theoretically
possible
that a big rock like this
could blow apart
from all the friction it causes
as it goes through
the atmosphere
if the composition
is just right
has that ever happened
once or at least
we think so
in 908 a big meteorite
about this size
was coming in over siberia
seconds before
it shouldve hit the ground
it just blew apart in the sky
how much time is there
projected impact
is in 45 minutes
you know we have
no road out of here tad
ive contacted general wade
at northcom
i put in a request for
as many choppers
as they can spare
a request
there are 900 people
in cottonwood anna
there are tens of thousands more
in towns all across the rockies
there just arent
enough helicopters
and there
not enough time
im sorry
do you believe in prayer tad
i believe in science
but sometimes i hedge my bets
well hedge one for us
will you
im so sorry
we did everything
we could but
would you like me
to take you in
anna
there another one coming
bigger than all the others
if it gets through
no one will survive
i cant do this
anymore
i cant fix it
i cant help the people
of this town
i
i cant even reassure them
that
what i thought
until you led me
back here
ill have no regrets
about today
because i know
i did everything that i could
and that because of you
there are certain things
that cant be put in a box
and made all better
ricky one of them
now miriam is
and what might happen
in that sky tonight is another
for the last six months youve
been turning away from me
away from emily
away from everybody else
in this town
you have 45 minutes anna
what are you going to do
with them
we can break in
in a moment anna
ill give you a cue
okay anna
youre on the air
this is mayor anna davenport
ive just spoken to
the colorado center
for emergency response
the latest report from nasa
shows a large meteor headed for
possible impact with earth
there is some hope that it
will explode in the
atmosphere
but if it doesnt
tracking has it making
landfall
somewhere between
the eastern rockies
and western colorado
the center of that radius is
right here in cottonwood
the estimated time of impact
is in 35 minutes
as your mayor it is my duty
to give you this
information
but there is no time
or means to flee
there is only time to
reflect
on how you want to spend
this next half hour
some of you may want
to spend it alone
others with your family
i want to spend it
with my husband
and my daughter
and the rest of my family
the people of this town
im going now
to the cottonwood
community church
i hope those of you
who want to
will join me there
i have to stay
i know
anna
do you remember
when ricky was four
and he learned
how to snap his fingers
he was so proud of himself
and he didnt just snap them
he flicked his wrist
like he was throwing dice
he made up a game about it
mad mommy he called it
i would have to pretend
to be mad at him
ricky youd better clean
up those toys right now
then hed snap his fingers
and id have to be nice
thank you for ricky
and thank you for emily
emily im really sorry
about this morning
it okay mom
i just wanted
so much to stay
to hold on
to this place
to ricky
and to seth
you really like him
dont you
yeah i do
i should have
listened to you more
i should have
talked to you more
what going
to happen tonight
were going
to be together
marty what wrong
what happening
schriever air force base
is sending a chopper
it on its way
here now
one chopper
how many does it hold
it an h-60
the pilot plus 0
youre telling me

to survive
mom it okay
im not afraid
it okay mom
how far is schriever
from here
50 miles
itll be here
just keep
watching the sky
anna
tad what happening
general wade issued a calldown
of all his craft
theyre needed
in the regions
where more people live
more people
or more important people
im sorry anna
im so sorry
it okay tyler
im right here
youre in the hospital tyler
and jack is taking care of you
youve got a tube in your mouth

and im not
going anywhere
im not going
to leave your side
you should go
go be with your family
ill cover here
what should we do now
where should we go
i think our odds of surviving
are better if we split up
if we all huddle here
and the church gets hit
who going to make it
out of here alive
if we fan out
as far as we can
well have a better
chance of survival
do you really want to survive
if the people you love dont
i know i wouldnt
neither would i
and i do believe
if we stand together
these moments will have meaning
emily
