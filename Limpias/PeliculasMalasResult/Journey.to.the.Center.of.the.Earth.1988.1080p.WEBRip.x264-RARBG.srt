on the possible existence
of a civilization
living in the center
of the earth

countless myths
concerning trolls

to conquer our world

too far from home

even if i have to dig a hole
to china
were gonna get out of here
when i was a kid
not much older than sarah
my daddy built me a tree house
except that he was really busy
so i had to find a way
to get up there myself
then bryan wanted to come up
in the tree house
i wouldnt help
because i was with my friends
and i had a thing
about being brothers and
so my dad would sit me down
and hed say
you know you brother too
small to get in that tree house
youre gonna have to help him
he used to say see this
that one finger
right there
you can just break it
really easy
but two of them
two of them together
you cant break it
you cant break it
you understand
so i still got a hand
but i wish i could take you
to that tree house now
take you there
away from all this
you just did
you have beautiful eyes
shit now what
aah snakes
theyre not snakes
theyre just big worms
i say we go back now
we cant
unless you have an elevator
then let go down
get off of me
bryan give me the canteen
it empty
we can stop
and refill it
no
weve lost the stream
we couldnt have
i saw it this morninghas it been that long
so what do you suggest
we do now
he got the right idea
maybe we should just get
some rest
too bad he cant find water
wait
baby want a drink
bryan have you still got
his empty bottle
yeahgive it to me quick
it all gone
there no more

let find out
bryan let me have the knife
and get it dirty
just hand it over
what do you wanna do
break the blade
there no water
under there man
it could be undergroundi thought we were underground

the ocean by now

bryan
visitors to atlantis
are required to report
to the nearest
police checkpoint
upon their arrival
citizens of the great
city state of atlantis
must be prepared to show
slack cards upon demand
lord over has issued
a statement
which reminds citizens
of atlantis
that there is no such thing
as a surface world
and rumors of the actual
existence of aliens are wrong
misleading
and counterproductive
to the future
of our great city state
anyone who thinks
they may have had contact
with an alien
female or older male
should report immediately
to general rykov
at government house
there is a reward
and finally the statement
stresses once and for all
aliens do not exist
the surface world
does not exist
and wanda saknussemm is a mere
figment of your imagination
hey you wake up
wake up
what are you
more important question
who are you
im bryan
im shank
heh
do you like my home
where am i
where do you think you are
if i knew
i wouldnt be asking
youre in atlantis city
atlantis city
atlantis city
new jersey
no
in the center of the earth
what kind of alien is this
um that a dog
where did you say i am
in the center of the earth
center of the earth right
um
look you better explain this
to me real slow
yes and then you can
tell me something
about the surface world
bryan
bryan
bryan
bryan
attention
you are in the atlantis
wasteland restricted area
all citizens are prohibited
from entering
i repeat
this is a restricted area
trespassers will be punished
by death
and a large fine
a reminder to all employees
at professor galba
transport to the surface
project
security wishes
to remind you
that any discussion
of the work being done here
is strictly forbidden
and punishable by death
thank you
have a good day
let me see if i can apply
a little bit
of light amplification
to make this stimulate
there you are
professor
you can save time
if you just do it my way
professor
it the modern technique
for atomic recompilation
your style is outdated
and of the stone age variety
i am an old cranky
professor
and i work
in an old cranky way
are you implying your technique
and knowledge are superior
to our advanced
atlantean science professor
im saying
that my method works
but most of all
this is my project
general rykov
you honor us
with your presence
is the progress on the transport
to the surface world
going well professor
it progressing general
are we on schedule
we could be
if professor galba would accept
modern scientific
atomic recompilation
it either my way
or no way
where consul crassis
he in charge here
i want to speak to him
i dont like all these changes
and talks of schedules
i never had an agreement
like that with him
he promised me
freedom and funding
money is tight professor
the economy is sluggish
and we cannot go on subsidizing
your research forever
i want to talk
to crassis
you cannot see crassis now
he having his hair done
in lemuria
youll have to deal
with me now
well i dont like you
and i certainly
detest him
why do you dislike us
professor
what have we done
to gain your animosity
i think youre going to use
my transporter to the surface
to send your army to conquer
the surface of the earth
ridiculous heh-heh-heh ridiculous
then why is he trying
to convince me
to make a cargo hold
for all their tanks
it will be our gift
to the aliens professor
now i want this transporter
completed within one month
or else
general rykov this old man
will stun us both soon
because of the failure of his earlier news conference
lord over has decided
to deliver his annual
state of the city speech
next week
it eagerly awaited
as a major announcement
concerning
the alien situation
general lord over
has moved up his speech
do you think he suspects
what were up to
no i think the pressure
for an official response
to the rumors
is forcing this speech
we have little time left
tola
do you have a good
believable alien yet
were close general
dangerously close
hello
i think im a bit lost
have i wandered into your
amusement park or something
you are an alien
arent you dear
well yeah i suppose i am
but ive got a work visa
coming from the embassy
next week
so thatll be all right
or wont it
where on earth are we going
none of this is necessary
it not very comfortable
either
just relax
general where do we take her
general
take her to the warehouse
tola
ill meet you there
well atlantis
does sound pretty weird
it getting very weird
i would normally sell you
aliens were very valuable
in atlantis
a little while ago
but now the government
arrests anyone
with any information
about aliens
it very dangerous
to have you with me
so how come youre helping me
and bernard out
i dont know i like things
from the surface world
i collect them
you can see my house
i get many things
from your world
fast photo here again with yet
another marvelous product
from govco the corporation
of your government
we can love each other
so hard that nothing
is gonna keep us apart
can we make a baby
possible existence
of aliens
can we go out
and look at your world
i mean as long as im here
id like to see atlantis
no
no it too dangerous
what that
it a beach
it so bright
and all the fluid
this is the surface world
yeah
sunrise brings a relaxing
moment for the natives
before the early morning planes arrive
if i can help you find
your way home
to the surface
will you take me home
with you bryan
what to my house
sure
my parents are pretty cool
about that stuff
ill be right back
i think i might be able
to find a way to get you home
but dont move from here
though
it very dangerous for you
in atlantis
the soldiers and the fat ladies
could easily find you
even you could have trouble
with the fat ladies bernard
let see
is it professor galba
who has the machine
to the surface
you are in sector 00
sector 00
a reminder
that temp body converters
will be a must later today
as a ripple of low pressure
will travel through
the pressurized zone
sector 00

govco we inform you of
what we know you need to know
all well general
it seems that we have
three subjects
who are very close in every way
to the original alien
wanda saknussemm
it may not be necessary at all
supervisor
but general
weve worked very hard
to create
a perfect duplicate
but why duplicate
when we have a real alien
she not an alien
she doesnt even look like one
to saknussemm
nevertheless
she is still an alien
you can meet me
at government house
ill decide on my own how
i will be exposing lord over
go ahead tola
remember
second-class citizens
trolls must not use respirators designated for humans

wow im bummed
really im from la
where are we malibu
things are so weird
bananas
are you bummed im bummed im bummed
wonderful
it so weird weve met
are you bummed im really bummed
my dear you have
such exquisite skin
and excellent follicles
my lunar cut will look
simply smashing on you
now there might be a slight
minor bit of pain
when i grip it to the hairpiece
to your skull
but it will be awesomeim bummed
a bit of agony
and torture anyway
it only hurts a little
so what are you trying
to do here
give her the tour
is it wiseit on the way to her cell
it your pension tola
yes
the applicants are sent here
by talent agents
from all over the city
and we decide
whether they are suitable
suitable for what
to become exact
wanda saknussemm replicas
they are washed and
dressed for
the transformation process
their skin is dyed
the perfect alien shade
and they are stretched
to wanda saknussemm
exact height
and this is where we teach them
to think and speak
like wanda saknussemm
who wanda saknussemm
and why are these girls
being made to look like her
they will be
wanda saknussemm
wanda was the first alien
ever to reach our world
she became quite a tourist
but why duplicate her
let just say general rykov
is planning to save atlantis
general rykov didnt
exactly seem the type
to care about the welfare
of the citizens
we all have our ambitions
yeah i suppose so
i have become
a bit muddled though
all i had to do
was take bernard for a bath
now i find myself
in the center of the earth
and i havent gotten a clue
where the dog is
what a dog
theyre pets
theyre small with big ears
and a lot of hair
we have them here in atlantis
we call them trolls
she doing that all wrong
am i
here
general rykov is

like that
wow im bummed

about your world
and how you came
to be here
well i was searching
for bryan this boy i met
well the brother of the boy
i met actually

no just a rather strange
american teenager
i fell down a pit

by general rykov

crystina

richard
i know nothing about him
you sure they didnt capture
a quasi-hunky guy
not terribly bright with
a real obnoxious personality
no no alien like that
just the girl
i think
she in great danger
let go
wait
where do you think
youre going
to save her
impossible
why
she being kept in a secret
warehouse by general rykov
and these meanest
and toughest soldiers
and theyve got
many weapons
there are too many rumors
about aliens existing
somehow i must
put a stop to it
especially
since it seems one or two
may have actually
entered the city
i believe the aliens
are spies
being sent down to report
on our capabilities lord over
we must mobilize for war
and we must launch
a massive retaliation
good
i understand your paranoia
general rykov
and you could be right
but it important
atlantis not learn of the aliens
until the right time
i will go on tv
and insist there are no aliens
and the smell
of freshly-cut grass
and the warmth
of the springtime sun
that what waiting
on the surface
beauty and peace
hey lady are all people equal
trolls and humans
in most of the world
there are still places
where bad people still live
but that all changing
and there are no wars
or fighting
im afraid there still
a bit of that too
there a lot of hope
in the future
that why you must come
to the surface in peace
start the relationship off
on the right foot
there much we can do
together
perhaps the general
is wrong
yes
this is moldine
down at the cloning lab
sir i think we have
a serious situation here
yes
an alien is brainwashing tola
and the others
she telling them
about the surface
no
about how peaceful
and beautiful it is
no
better get down here
before it too late
what are the chances
of going back with you

how to get back up
that no problem
