what is that supposed to mean
i told you and jake
not to adopt a black boy
they need to be
with their own kind
you think he doesnt see that
im not doing this right now
your husband died
and youre left
to raise him all alone
race has nothing
to do with it
hateful people make it that way
i called you to let you know
your grandson is missing

i havent been
here in a while
i talked to my mom
and she just made things worse
let just focus on
john cause your mom
male yeah is it okay
if i searched the place
look for forced entry
yes
are there any leads
on where he might be
i have no idea
im not even sure
he left on his own
have you talked to the
school or any of his friends
i called he not at school
the principal talked
to the classmates
and nobody has seen him
do you mind if
we pray for you
okay thanks
no sign of forced entry
i spoke with the police
because it hasnt
been 24 hours yet
there nothing they
can do until then
24 hours
somebody could have taken
him across country by then
look i have some of
my friends on the force
looking for john while
theyre on patrol
and i also called
the help center
you mean the community
group at that church
at least we have
someone looking with us
we just cant sit here
and hope that they find him
let just calm down
we can think better-
calm down
i lost my husband
and now im ab out
to lost my son
you have yours
i waited until i was
married to have children
trying to be obedient
nobody does that anymore
slow paced music
i thought the lord
would honor it
and instead he
took jake from me
a couple of years
before jake passed
we found out we
couldnt have children
that why we decided to adopt
as soon as life
starts to act right
jake passes
and now this
i dont think i can
believe in god anymore
god wouldnt give people
more than they can bare
and we know that
those who love god
all things work for good
for those who are called
according to his purpose
birds chirping
ominous music
yeah there this
super hot guy here
he has so many
tattoos on his arm
but he has that one
piercing on his nose
oh it so hot

i asked you to wait judy
what if we have an
emergency we cant fulfill
it father day weekend
and were short of help
im not gonna sit around
and wait for another emergency
when we have one right now
male what if he not lost
huh
what if he at a friends
house or something
exactly
you dont know where he is
that why we
prepare for the worst
and expect the best
male judy come on
what is wrong with you
this isnt you
i figured after what
happened to lily
you would be the first person
to wanna find
somebody else child
you were born and
raised in a church
do you believe this
is what god wants
male i dont
even believe in god
i said do you believe this is
what god wants from you
are you listening to me
i said i dont even
believe in god
how
you work at a church
so what
cause i work at a
church doesnt mean
i have to believe in god
i need a paycheck
judy what
when i was coming up
i didnt have
choice of religion
it was given to me
and as a kid i couldnt
ask any questions
you were just being curious
no no no
you try telling that
to my aunt nessa
you question anything
in the bible
she find the biggest
thickest bible she could
and she hit you it right
in the back of your head
and i didnt realize
until i got older
that she was afraid
look i never believed in god
i never embraced any of it
i mean i took communion
i got baptized
i went to confession
i was just faking it
i dont believe jesus died
on the cross for my sins
especially no one
as crazy as i was
but
after lily died
i just stopped
believing all together
i didnt think he was real
why would he do that
because he loves you
if he loved her why
did he let her die
why did he let my baby die
i mean it wasnt her fault
i didnt take care of my health
and if he loved her
why did he do that
she didnt deserve it
i was driving
and i passed out
and i was wrong
and she had to pay for it
it not love
that why i dont
believe in god no more
i dont believe it
solemn music
oh my god this is crazy
when did you know
you were a christian
i asked you a question
it a simple answer
when did you know
you were a christian
judy when jesus died
on the cross for my sins
no no no no no
im not asking you when
you knew you were saved
im asking you to tell me
when did you know that
you were a christian
the moment
the second hour the minute
that you knew what
you believe now
when did you know
you were a christian
somber music
woman lord can
you hear me though
a long time ago i stopped
believing your reports
through your son christ
all things were possible
and that i simply believe
i believed every word you said
after all youre the same god
that raised lazarus
from the dead
he that wants some more
so i got a question
why did you save him
and not my daughter
this is not divine order
i wasnt supposed to bury her
she supposed to bury me now
what in the world
do you want from me
what do you mean that the
faith of a mustard seed
it was your mountain
that fell down on me
left to die and the
rumble cant see
to get from under my humbles
you never believed in me
til you see miraculous
signs and wonders
i wonder i wonder
was all that you could
claim even real
when she touched the hem of
your garment was she healed
what miracles did
you perform for paul
how did five loaves and
two fish feed all of yall
that water into wine
they had to be lying
babies birthed by old
women and virgins
jonah in the whale
daniel in the den
okay then really
see up until now i
never questioned you
but the prayers of the
righteous did you even hear
i begged to switch places
she was just a baby
jesus was supposed to take
the will in an instant
my lifeline was killed
awake me from this dream
this cant be real
devil on duty
lie destroy kill
mission accomplished
im all out of options
i cant face the odds
the lord said let
go and let god
do you ever feel like
if you prayed hard enough
certain things wouldnt happen
i never thought
about it like that
but i know what you mean
god not punishing you
for not praying enough
it feels like it
or either he just isnt there
what
i just feel like
prayer doesnt work
if it did why are all these
things happening to me
remember when was asked
why the blind man was blind
he said so that god
may get the glory
let god get the glory on this
so what do we do now
why dont we go inside
and see if there might
be a clue as to where
he might have went
yeah come on
wendy no no no
no no that not
his room anymore
it this way come on
this way
why is this missing
woman what is it
wendy john knife

jake bought john this knife
as a souvenir from the
father and son retreat
john never took it
out of the case

and he coming back

what is a miracle
earlier today you asked me
when was the moment
the second that i
knew i was a christian
it was when i saw a miracle
jesus said in john 448
unless i see miracles
in amazing things
they will not believe
some wont believe until
they see a miracle
i believe were so consumed
by the worlds ways that
it hinders our beliefs
we cant see clearly
my mom had cancer
male you dont
need to tell me that
slow paced music

i prayed for my
mama day and night

nothing was helping her
then there was this lady
miss grace
she came to see mama
and she prayed for her
in a way i had
never seen anybody
pray for somebody
she was on her knees
praying for her
a few days later
mama was healed
the doctors couldnt explain it
a few days after
all that i got a
chance to spend some
time with miss grace
i understood why god
answered her prayers
that she was praying for mama
she loved jesus
i promise you try loving him

and youll see
he been loving
you for a long time
a long time

feeling depressed all the time
everything will get better
as soon as everything
gets back to normal
yeah
im gonna be honest with you
maybe you should
put up a few things
i mean the pictures
that you have of jake
can be pretty depressing
you have a photo of
him as your screensaver
on your computer and phone
you mentioned the
other day that you have
a photo of him on a
dashboard of your car
you even planning a ceremony
for the day that he died
look im not saying
forget about him
i just think it
important that we celebrate
the joy of jakes life
immersing yourself in his death
is only gonna make
you more depressed
you probably dont
even realize it
and i agree
you need surround
yourself with things
that bring you laughter
joy and inspiration
you need to celebrate
his good memories
and remember you have
a life to live too
our intake in our
lives is crucial
look people say
we are what we eat
were also what we hear and see
and we gotta be careful
what we allow in our lives
do you mind if
we prayed for you
jamal lord god the
creator of the earth
the heavens--
dear god please

i once
was lost
but
now
im found

but now
i see
slow light music
ive avoided coming in here
because every time i do
i cant stop crying
the last time i was in here
was when jake died
john would run up the
steps every morning
to watch jake car go by
he would look through
these binoculars
to watch jake go to work
the last time he looked
through the binoculars
was when the wreck happened
jamal oh my goodness
