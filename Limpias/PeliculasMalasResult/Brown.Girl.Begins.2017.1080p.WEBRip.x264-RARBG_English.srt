brown girl in the ring
woman
my people lived in peace
on the mainland of toronto
until 2030 the year
i was born
the wealthy stole toronto
for themselves
screaming
riots erupted
police radio chatter
whistle blows
the new regime built a wall
barring us from the mainland
police sirens wailing
they exiled my people
to a forsaken island off
the coast of toronto
wind blows eerily
our spirits hunger for a home
an evil sorcerer rudy rose up
from the aches of the burn
using buff
and creating crack to rule us
whip cracking
my grandmother a priestess
called on the spirit
mama ache to heal the burn
sings in foreign language
mama ache
she is light
continues singing
she is love
singing continues
with her help
we grew
‐but crack silenced mama ache
‐whip cracking
so mami called on papa legba
the destroyer
shouting and screaming
papa legba
demanded a young priestess
as a conduit for his power
i watched
as my mother tried to
open to papa legba
crying
open to me
mami
dont be afraid
ah
ah
let papa legba power in
or the fear will kill you
ah

‐yeee‐‐
‐mother screams

open your eyes
mami

with his power
open
shouting
my grandmother
watched helplessly

i watched as papa legba
killed my mother
no
sobbing no
she was too afraid
to receive his power
girl
no no
i am next in line
i too am afraid
where my mother ends
i begin
panting
grunts
shouts

change everything for us
for the good of our people
you must sacrifice yourself

are getting stronger
whimpering
mama ache tells me
your powers will be great
whimpering

you will heal others
by taking on their pain
you must open to papa legba
and destroy crack
then you can release
mama ache power
