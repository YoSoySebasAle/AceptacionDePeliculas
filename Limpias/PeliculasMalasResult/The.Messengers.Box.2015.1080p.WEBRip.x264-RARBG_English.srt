jake mom
check this outwhat the bible
no i found a noteinside of it
july 4 998
today im writingthis to let whomeverfinds this letter
know that itin my possession
i have a small wooden box
that is filled with some sort of something
that is beyond my comprehension
you see the boxcontains nothing
yet it feels likesomething is in it
when i open the box i immediately get a very peaceful
and beautiful feeling
you might thinkim crazy
but this box is connectedto someone called holy
it a feeling that i cant describe
when i open the boxi see jesus hangingon the cross
i can see a young man holding this very box and crying
while he watching jesus being crucified
i cant help but thinkof my jake when i getthis feeling
im not sure but i believe this box is meant to be in jake possession
carry out something that only he is meant to
i know that jakewill find this box
just at the timehe needs it
to fulfill whateverhe has been calledto do
jake what do youthink this means
grandpa felt and sawwhat i feel and see
what if grandpawas right
what if imsupposed to do somethingwith the box
but what
he never saidwhere he found it
what if someonegave it to him
what if grandpa foundthe box where i found it
what if he left it thereso i would find it
someone called holy
what does thateven mean
okay there isan explanationfor all of this
there has to be
you told methat grandpa always talked
about peoplethat came into his shop
do you rememberanything about somebody
that gave himthe box
no i dont rememberhim saying anything
about anyonegiving him the box
maybe somebodysold it to him
sighs i dont knowmaybe he did--
i just dont understandhow i only know three people
that felt what i feltwhen i opened the box
why didnt you annaor david feel anything
why just me grandpaand richie
how do you know richiefeels what you feeljake

besides richie said ittoo far for us to go
fine
now let go playthat boxing gameover there
the box
what box
the box that jake had
that richie picked upoff the ground
remember whenthey fought at the schoolthe other day
yeah what about it
well that nightrichie told me something
it was reallybothering him
he said thatwhen he opened the box
something cameover him
somethingpeaceful
that crazy man
i dont knowwhat that means
but somethingtells me that we needto go find jake
well do you knowwhere to find him
no there waysto find him
let go
man i still dont knowwhat that little boxcan do for richie
did he ever mentionwhat was in the box
he always saidhe felt like the box
held somethingspecial inside
although he nevercould find it
and you know the box
the box hadsome weight to it
i bet you twodont know this
your grandfathertook care
of a homeless manfor a while
hed come in hereand hed get his meals
and your grandfatherwould pay for it
he even let him stayin the back of his storefor a few weeks
i bet you didntknow that maggie
nope
anyway the first timei saw that box
was shortly afterholy disappeared
so i alwaysjust believed
holy gave himthe box
he never mentionedanything like thatto me
although i guessit because i probablywould have told dad
to makethe homeless manleave the shop
huh well ill be
he was right
there is somethingin there
what is it
i dont know
i think itsome kind of nail
may i
you knowjust a few months
before your grandpapassed
he told me he wasgoing to hide the boxin the store
chuckles and that if youhad anything
to do with it jake
you would findthe box
and he believed
somehowthe box would end upin your hands
at justthe right time
you mentioned holy
was that the homelessguy name
he saidhe was knownas holy
holylike god holy
or holey likeholey clothes
when your grandfathertold me he was gonna
let this guystay in his shop
i did my researchi went around
and i askeda lot of questions
and everyone i askedsaid he was harmless
just a kind old man
hey mom do youknow how jesus
was nailedto the cross
well he diedso that you and icould have life
yeah i know thatbut were the nails
through his handsor his wrists
im not sure
