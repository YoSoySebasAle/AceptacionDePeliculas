weve been playing it 900 am non-stop

i think we should lead
off the album with that
i think l should
finish my album
that something we need to talk about
clay wants to move the release date up
that bullshit
hell no
listen were thinking we can
leak a track onto the lnternet
perhaps tie it in with a video
piece that looks sort of homemade
like it was shot on
a cell phone or something
that way it can be downloaded and then all
over the place so that nobody buys the album
it wont get downloaded all over the place
the album will be released weeks later
the l nternet the swap
meet of the world man
we can send a track out the next couple of
weeks and get some traction on the album
wait a minute and you
listen to this dude
since you didnt hear me the first
time real good it aint done yet
it can be done
im in the studio right now lma talk
louder so dr phil over here can hear me
