the mind is its own place and in itself
can make a heaven of hell
a hell of heaven
john milton paradise lost
the great poet goethe
said at the end of his life
that he couldnt see one single mistake
among his fellow human beings
that he hadnt himself committed
if goethe saw his fellow
humans like this
how do you think then that the
son of man looks upon us
jesus message
is one of forgiveness
so my dear friends
there is no hell
now you want to sing right
we will now it happeneds that there are
two psalm numbers on the board
so which should we take
well actually do both at once
because it so that
in the psalm book from 937
well be singing psalm number 2
ive written 297 to prevent confusion in case it
should so be that any of you has the edition from 986
but both my dad and me
we might snort a bit about
these kinds of modern things
but now you know psalm 2
wonderful is the earth
if it is so that one imagines
certain things elsie
it is possible to receive medical help

and take a calming bath
and then you open the good book
and read something from the book of psalms
and which psalm should i read
it doesnt matter theyre all hits

hello
hi my name is henrik
go away
are you related to gabriel horneus
gabriel boy in stockholm
with old grandmother
i havent heard anything
he lived up there until the end
and grandfather
alvar
he killed himself
in the broken tree by the road
your father cut him down
one didnt talk about such
but my the boy could preach
you can be proud
he frightened the entire village to
healthy fear of god
he described the last judgement
what happends with those that betray god
what sort of pay that awaits
if we cant hold our fingers in
boiling water for a second did he say
how would it then feel like to be
in a boiling pot for the rest of eternity
it worked
but the tempter hated it hated
and that was why he sent
a messenger he sendt her
yes even your father
was a man in the flesh
it was disgraceful woman
a dirty dirty little whore
and he fell over and over again
i asked him to fight
and christ was victorious
but in the end
from the dirty stump spread the bad
and the bad got the upper hand
and it screamed in him
it screamed
the last day he walked around here
as a foaming stallion
that was the last that i saw of my boy
when he went over to the whore for the last time
i think dad was murdered
i think it was the father
of the lidman family
no no
the father of the lidman family is an
irreproachable man there a child there
it no good child
so you must have felt
it a damaged horrible evil child
a child that killed your father
no
henrik
henrik
come henrik
come
mommy will show you
mommy will show you everything
what were you doing in the barn
nothing
what were you doing in the barn
i did nothing please olle
you have to believe me
my father lvar
i hate that man
hate
but our carnal fathers are nothing
our spiritual father is everything
our god is coming god anger
burst forwards like a storm
but the roman letter paul says we
should fight the evil with the good
nahum from alqosh the lord is
a vengeful god full of suffering
the lord revenges his opponents
psalm 37 happy is the one who repays you
according to what you have done to us
happy is the one who seizes your infants
and dashes them against the rocks
the mercy of the lord infinite
his compassion never ends
psalm 58
to forgive is the central part
isaiah  verse 25
i will avenge me of mine enemies
and they shall both burn together
in a fire that will never end
glowing coal and sulphur
burning winds is the weight theyll get
jesaja 66 vers 6 with fire and with his sword
the lord will execute judgment on all people
and they will go out and look on the dead
bodies of those who rebelled against me
the worms that eat them will not die
the fire that burns them will not be quenched
the swedish church has since 983
refused the existence of a hell
theyre cowardly
theyre cowards and infidels
the disgracful murderers
their place is in the sea
burning of sulfur and fire
they shall be tormented day and night for ever
and ever book of revelation chapter 20
can you feel it
the bronze gates has opened
all the way down to the ninth circle
open your eyes and see
take the sword that god
has put before you

thy hand shall be equal to
all thine enemies
thy right hand shall overtake
those that hate thee

in the time of thine anger
the lord shall swallow them up in his wrath
and the fire shall devour them
their fruit shalt thou destroy
from the earth
and their seed from

bowstrings against the face of them
be thou exalted o lord in thy strength
so will we sing and praise thy power

in the time of thine anger
the lord shall swallow them up in his wrath
and the fire shall devour them
their fruit shalt thou destroy
from the earth
and their seed from
among the children of men
for they intended evil against thee
they imagined a device
wherewith they shall not prevail
for thou shalt make them turn their back
thou shalt make ready with thy
bowstrings against the face of them
be thou exalted o lord in thy strength
so will we sing and praise thy power
thy hand shall be equal to
all thine enemies
thy right hand shall overtake
those that hate thee
thou shalt make them as a fiery furnace

im so tired

in new shape
yes well then
nora
olle where have you been
but sit down
who lit the light in the barn
who lit the light in the barn
olle who lit the light in the barn
first i will read
a psalm to you
a psalm that his father read
at every church service
youll probably remember it
it a psalm expressing the core
of the faith it about the enemies of god
it about you
it psalm 2
the priest shall well call larserik
it too late
the priest has asked you about calling lars-erik
for three days but you have declined
because you know that he lying you know
if one takes the life of a god servant
one has commited a deadly sin
you know you know and you will get your
punishment now and in all eternity
olle
psalm 2 goes like this
thy hand shall be equal to
all thine enemies it was you
thou shalt make them as a fiery furnace
it was you that lit the light in the barn every night
make them as a fiery furnace
in the time of thine anger
there something you need to know
there something you dont know
the lord shall swallow them up in his wrath
and the fire shall devour them
there something you need to know
the fire shall devour them
their fruit shalt thou destroy
from the earth and their seed
tell
for they intended evil against thee
tell youve misunderstood everything
silence
tell him with thy bowstrings
against the face of them
amen
amen hit amen hit hit hit
he did horrible things
one arent allowed to do so
one arent allowed to do so
him and me in the barn
when we were reading
the lord shall swallow them up in his wrath
and the fire shall devour them
their fruit shalt thou
destroy from the earth
and their seed from among
the children of men
so will we sing and praise thy power
thy hand shall be equal to
all thine enemies
thou shalt make them as a fiery furnace
in the time of thine anger
the lord shall swallow them up
in his wrath
amen
and it continued after the wedding
it continued after the wedding
it was a disgraceful woman
a shame
a dirty dirty little whore
she lying she lying lies
hit hit hit
oh olle
gabriel is your father
it strange
it strange but i always felt
that was the way it should be
and it makes it so much easier
it was my fault
there is a child there it not
good child so you must have felt
a damaged horrible evil child
it was me that did it
a child that killed your father
it was my fault
you and dad was in the forest
mom was cutting my hair
then
then came
he talked to mom
they talked well
then
horneus he
his hand
his hand
and momshe saw
mom talked
and mom pointed
he bent over
and mom
mom
mom
drowning
olle
lvar
olle
i didnt say anything
dad
i didnt say anything
but you told henrik
you told
no i didnt
one isnt allowed to tell henrik
and you knew
it was our little secret
our little little secret
that mom wasnt supposed to know
it was between the two of us
between the two of us
but i didnt say nothing
henrik she did know
confess now henrik
it better that way
henrik do you know what happends
when one tells no
henrik ive told you
many times
what happends when one tells
is that one has to be punished
punished hard
for a very long time
very long time
forgive me
dadforgive me
it too late
henrik it doesnt help
that youve been standing there preaching
pretending that the punishment
is just an idea
you cannot lie away the sword
of truth the lies will get you
you cant joke away the day of judgement
when god shows you
his face of anger
will you understand how
gruesome a god he is
i cannot believe in a god that is
less merciful than myself
youre just making it worse for yourself
you have to be thrown down now
down into the dark abyss
from which noone returns
down into the lake that burns
of fire and sulfur
downinto hell
oh god oh god
he cant help you now
it a completely different power
that you will meet
you will meet yourself
my boy
my pretty pretty boy
it here
we found you on the floor
in the kitchen last night
dad carried you up
how are you
yes lars-erik niskala
expert on forensic medicine in hammerdal
the priest will meet at the assembly
yes
ajna want to say something
it leads your way through life
he said
we used to sit here and read
your father would have wanted that
someone believing in it should have it
yes after all it does say
some good things as well
the topic of today sermon
is possibly a little
unorthodox maybe
the last week has been
the last week has been
a bit odd for me
but i sleep a lot better now
i sleep better than ive done
in a long time
i dream different dreams
good dreams
i dream about a world without shame
and without blame
do not judge
so you will not yourself become judged
a carpenter son from nazareth
once said this
but what does the religions do
what does the churches do
the way i see it religions exist
for one reason only
in order to repress the people
to scare the serving classes
into obedience
so they will not dare to challenge
the privileges of the elite
and the elite
ladies and gentlemen are you
you never had sin and shamed
beaten into you
the elite that has always been sitting
in this church not in some country church
has never needed
to listen to sermons about hell
what is he saying
at the end of the 800s when one
wanted dedemonise the church
arch bishop sundberg said yes
but a peasant hell
will always be needed
a peasant hell
will always be needed
is he joking the one with the power
defines what moral
in the name of the holy lord
but noone noone has monopoly on god
i told you last week i dont know if you remember
but i said that there is no hell but i was wrong
i was wrong there is a hell
i know now
oh yes there is a hell
in the religions
there was no hell until religions
the religions invented hell
now hell have to pull himself together
do not judge
so you will not yourself be judged
so said the son of man
and still this is what the church has been
doing for 700 years
700 years
what is he saying
of torture
execution crusades
blood fire violence and abuse
john wrote in the first epistle to the corinthians
the one that does not love remains in death
this is the law
this is the answer
now hell pull himself together
no silence server the power
the only way in which to defend oneself from
the silence is to tell the truth
the truth will set you free
the truth and love
the endless unconditional love
this is the only god
that i have left
down
down
certain people dont agree with me but i think
it is a good god it a god that i would want to be
out
out out of the house of god
praise the lord in heaven
praise him in height
praise him all of his angels
praise him all of his army
praise him sun and moon
praise him all shining stars
praise him you heaven of heaven
you water over the sky
they shall praise his name
for he commanded their creation
he gave them their place in eternity
decided an orden that will never perish
yours is the day
yours is the night
god river is full of water
you take care of the earth give it rain
make it fertile and rich
you make the seeds grow
water the fields
where you pass forth
grows fat crops
the grazes of the wasteland goes fertile
the heights dress in rejoicing
the fields are adorned with flocks of sheep
the valleys are covered with seeds
everything is rejoice and song
everything is rejoice and song
