there are all sorts of ways
to hit a cue ball
the thing youre trying to do
is send it
in a particular direction
to hit another ball and drop
that ball into a pocket
but it where you send
the cue ball next
that separates you
from the others
when you first start playing
you think it only
about that one ball
you can put backspins
sidespin or topspin on a ball
or you can make it stop
on a dime bounce off a rail
you can hit a ball soft hard
or just give it a little kiss
you can send a ball
behind another ball
to make it hard for
your opponent to make a shot
once you have the skills
you can do any of these things
some dads take their kids
to church or to the ball game
that what some dads do

he took me to pool halls
and he taught me how to play
a game called 9-ball

out your eyes

nice watch
nine-ball succession pool
where you got to
knock them down in order

it takes skill
and more importantly
it takes foresight
