hi mrs matthews
sage
we just got back
from the park

you need to change her diaper
as soon as she poops dear
i was going to change
it before her nap
well why dont i just
change it for you now
i can change her
diaper mrs matthews
i hope you didnt take her
to that park on griffith street
it filled with homeless
i read in the paper
that they found
more than 2 homeless
people living there
filthy just filthy
and you know what they do
i dont know what they do
they leave trash everywhere
clothing tents
needles it disgusting
wow that really is something
i just think it would
be highly irresponsible
for you to take
her to that park
so a surprise visit huh
mm-hm im redecorating my
master bedroom and i will take
any excuse to visit my princess
what time is dinner
oh well luke doesnt
get back till later
and i was going to make
myself a salad and
well sage dear
that wont work
okay
you have a guest
you need to go to
the grocery store
and get something to prepare
i just got back from the
grocery store earlier
well good that means it
must not be very far away
okay well ill just
give jessee her bottle
and then be on my way
it almost four oclock
i can manage the bottle
it just if
i can handle it
well just be sure to
put her down afterwards
otherwise shell
be up all night
you have a
nice night ladies
youre the worst
it good to hear
you laugh again
it good to talk
about her again
how you doing
better i think
everything been i dont know
just blurry for so long
i wanted to be
there for you man
i shouldnt have
pushed you away
it was kinda selfish
i just didnt know
how to talk to you
i saw your texts and your calls
and i see you in the office
it just reminded me of jessica
weve both been there luke
in that room where
it goes wrong
but when it somebody you know
i really miss her too man
and i really miss
having you around
im sorry
youre a good doctor
i had it all planned out
a good girl a good
job a good life
and when it was yanked
away from me i just
i didnt feel worthy to
ever have that again
like it was my fault
and now
hey sometimes second chances
come in really weird ways
jessee definitely
my second chance
i bet having sage
around to help is a bit
of a breath of fresh air too
yeah more than you know
she so good with jessee
she cooks a mean steak
and most importantly
she doesnt put up with
katharyn attitude
what
what what that
nothing
shut up and drink your beer
this fish is interesting
it mahi mahi
hm it interesting
what time did you say
luke was coming home

well you do the dishes
im going to get some dessert
for my sweet princess
well actually we dont like
to feed her a lot of sweets
we
we dont like to give
her a lot of sweets
i think you should let
me be the grandmother
i just think
no dear it not
your place to think
ive seen the way you
behave with this child
excuse me
it highly unprofessional
you walk around like you
belong in this family
mrs matthews
i know you lost your child
i talked to the dunhills
they said they had to let you
go because you were depressed
and unfit for the job
no

and you are not going
to replace her mother

i got too comfortable
too comfortable
when i lost my
baby i was drifting
and then you and jessee came
along and it was like a family
but it wasnt my family
it wasnt meant for me
sage
listen
i love jessee i love her
with my whole heart but
i think i have to go
i think that
a horrible idea
what
i dont accept your
resignation maam
well i dont think
that how this works
okay why dont
you sleep on it
ill take off tomorrow
and watch jessee
if you wake up in the morning
you feel the same way
i wont stop you
sleep on it
huh
good morning sage
hi
i didnt know how
you liked your coffee
black is fine thanks
how did you sleep
where luke and jessee
he took her out
i was hoping to tell him that
today would be my last day
yeah he told me this morning
that that what
you were thinking
well there it is
why dont you sit
ill stand
sit please dear it
just coffee it doesnt bite
did you know that i hated
jessica in the beginning
it true
luke was a wild child
when he met her
he was hanging out with
riffraff and hellraisers
and then he met this girl
she was nice she was
beautiful she was educated
she gave him a reason to
get serious about school
get his degree
im not following
i hated it
for the first time in his
life there was someone
who wasnt me that
made him happy
it was her that he
wanted to please
well
from the time luke dad
died for a long time after
it was just the two of us
i held onto him really tightly
and then to see this
woman take my place i
it broke my heart
is this going somewhere
the way ive treated you
has not been very polite
and i realized last night
that the reason ive
treated you that way
is because you remind me of her
you have become important
to the two people
that i care most
about in my life and
i was just worried that there
wouldnt be room for me
i dont know what to say
luke told me about
the man you were with
i wish id been there
i would have let
him know how we deal
with things like
that on the ranch
luke and jessee love you
and i lied about the dunhills
shocking
they were really
sorry to lose you
and they told that youd
become a part of the family
and that you used to take
the boys to ride horses
now why didnt you put
that on your resume
i dont know
well horses and i go
together like steak and sauce

how bout you
oh no sports for me
i was too punk for that
i was all about loud
music and horses
horses

oh but barrel racing
is
it like the music
controlled chaos
hm must be a lot of space
to ride around in australia
you have no idea
it is so beautiful
hey
hi
just havin a party people
hey were thinking about
getting out of here
you guys interested
yeah there is this really
rad club down the street

yes
i dont get it
uh
we should get inside
check on jessee
well michelle with jessee
and im sure she
asleep by now
we need to we should
just get inside you know
did i do something
what is it
i keep seeing her
who
jessica
if it would have been up to me
we would have lived in
that apartment forever
this whole house was
just her brainchild
being in the desert
made her feel
like we lived in the old west
she sounds really great
she was
when i first met her i was
always looking for the
next beer run party
she got me focused
pushed me to be a doctor
and i just assumed you
loved the female anatomy
sounds kinda cheesy but
i became an ob because
i just loved the idea
of being there when
a family starts
seeing that look
on a father face
when he first sees his child
or the relief a mother
has when you tell her
that she has a very
happy healthy baby
nothing quite like it
well dr matthews
you do have a soft
side under there
yeah somewhere under there
how bout you
all i know about you is
that you are an aussie
and you used to ride horses
every weekend
when i was a kid
my dad taught me to barrel race
and i loved it so much
that i started competing
like a real cowgirl
yes like a real cowgirl
hm
the summer i sold my
horses was really rough
my mum moved back
here to the states
and my dad stayed in adelaide
and he had to sell the
horses just to get by
and that was that
i buried myself in music
and my horses just
became a faded memory
so the cowgirl has a past
yeah
you dont have to
answer this but allen
yeah
girls like bad guys i guess
mm-hm
mm-hm i met him
back home at a show
when his band was doing
smaller opening acts
and at first i was just
another girl to him
then he made me feel special
dedicated songs to me onstage
winked at me during solos
i loved it
then i followed him to the
states when he got signed
and then he changed real quick
our late nights became
his late nights
he stopped sleeping on the
bus and disappeared a lot
then i got pregnant
yeah and he adopted
the rockstar lifestyle
yeah things became
too real he said
needed to work on
touring and his work
he said hed send me
money and id be set
until the other night
the last i saw him
or heard from him was
when the bus pulled out
and he headed east
why are men so horrible
let face it were jerks
well present company
excluded obviously
i left voicemails
and emails and texts
and im about three months along
and he tells me i
shouldnt call him anymore
im upsetting his artistic flow
such a load
you never wanted to show up
to one of his concerts
and call him out
