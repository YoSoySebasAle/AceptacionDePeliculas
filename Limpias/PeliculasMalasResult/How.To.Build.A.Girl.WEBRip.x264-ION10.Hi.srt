sighs
ive read every book
in this library
but i cant find a story
about a girl like me
girls in books
always have a moment
where everything changes
but my moment
still hasnt happened
today is like yesterday
tomorrow never comes
i know what usually starts
an adventure
the arrival
of a mysterious hero
a mr darcy a mr rochester
a rhett butler
who turns everything
upside down
i am not closed-minded
but finding the romantic hero
of our age in wolverhampton
seems unlikely
upbeat music
laughing
riding on any wave
that is the luck you crave
they dont believe it now
they just think it stupid
so got anything
anyone could have done
who wouldve cared at all
not you
laughing
another heart
has made the trade
forget it forget it
forget it
i dont understand
how a heart is a spade
bell ringing
ah
bell ringing
no i do not think
my adventure starts with a boy
i think it starts with me
instrumental music
dog barking
like all great heroes

my faithful dog bianca

and writes powerful truths
that change people lives

clamoring

a great book can have
ow
music continues
i know what youre thinking
there are a few key differences
between me
and your typical heroine
you alright bab
hi dad
for starters
i am not a tragic orphan
i actually have
too many brothers
four which is
simply excessive
and then there my mother
postnatal depression
which you should
absolutely expect
if you get pregnant at 38 ugh
unlike virginia woolf i dont
even have a room of one own
this is krissi room with
a partition down the middle
like berlin
but here
i have everything i need
elizabeth taylor
the bronte sisters
donna summer
dr sigmund freud

musical number cant cure
how much longer am i going to
have to be here

andy bibby farts on his own
hands and throws them at people
shouting turtle power
well we could conduct
our relationship downwind
what about richard moseley

richard moseley once shot
a snail with an air rifle
john kellog has a good bag
and so chaucer
was one of the first poets
to use the five-stress line
the decasyllabic cousin
to the iambic pentameter
the man who helped standardize
middle english
a daring satirist

by johanna morrigan
my father sells your babies
you howl when youre alone
you do not know
who your parents are
and all you want to do is bone
well my best friend is bianca
my dog
despite her mental health
seeming fragile
and when it comes to scaring
off assailants or yobs
she has proven less than agile
you cannot hug me
with your paws
i know bianca
ive tried
come on johanna
dog anatomy lacks
rotator cuffs
you cant open your forelegs
that wide
but bianca
i know you can always hug me
you can always hug me
hug me with your eyes
im so nervous
im so nervous
when you know that there
one million people watching

lonely teenager into dog

enemies and your friends

with your lungs full of cinder
the bed on fire
and you realize
the dragon grew up
and burned your
fucking house down

you said heartbreak

angels dont put
the angels to bed
and it okay to lie
is what i have learned

classy
im having this
hotel tax innit
for the honor of my company
chuckles
i do have a proper question now
hit me
why are your songs so sad
oh baby now that a
that big one
well
you see i was uh
born in a crossfire
hurricane
no that a quote
jumpin jack flash
the stones
have you never listened
to the stones
i have the best of
reserved at the library
but there are six other
reservations ahead of me
and yet you can quote ulysses
well no one reserved that
at the library
i bet
well
like you baby
im a scratcher
i was born in blackwood
south wales valleys
in a crossfire drizzle
my mother had my three sisters
and then she got ill
wed go and visit her
in hospital and uh
she uh
she didnt wanna touch us
it made her cry
and when wed say goodbye
shed press the tips of her
fingers to her mouth
press it on our mouths
and say this is john kiss
and the little ones you know
they just wanted their mum
glass clinks
when she uh decided to die
id go into her wardrobe
andput on her coat
and hug em
so they could smell her
you know
i read somewhere
that what you do with puppies
youput em in a cardboard box
with a blanket that smells
of their mother
and your dad
chuckles
this is all off the record now
of course
we are off road now
and off balance too
both chuckle
glass clinks
this is far too much about me
you tell me one true thing
about you
whose eyes do you have
whose whose wonder
i used to think that anyone
who didnt have my mother
my eyes are hers
or my father
he the one who loves the world
was so unlucky
they might as well
just lie down and die
chuckles softly
but then she had
the unexpected twins
and now she just
i miss her
even though she there
so i guess i write
because that like
putting a wish into a bottle
isnt it
baby i think we are both
in the business
of putting wishes in bottles
i mean that the whole
business were in
chuckles
do you want some nuts
hmm
alright
both laugh
i love a bath
oh me too
i just dont understand showers
theyre depressing
it like standing in the rain
on purpose
chuckles
but i love doors
they make the outside stop
ah i love doors now
hm
ive fallen in love with doors
theyre amazing
but do you love dogs
what do i love dogs
i absolutely love dogs
what your favorite
type of dog

the socioeconomic conditions
that lead to the dominance of
working-class rock and roll
just write from the heart jo
and into the bank balance
love that
sighs

and wear him as a coat
listen i finished it
john kite in dublin
he not a beautiful boy
nor a tall one
but when the wind blows in
on the street corner
you can hear his heart beat
under his shirt
and when conversation
accelerates
you can hear his mind
chime like a clock
he is bright bright bright
like the lantern above a pub
door in november
he makes you wanna come in
and never leave
when he smiles it like
plugging in a wurlitzer
the dance floor floods
with jivers
and this tony this is why
we dont employ little girls
to write our newspaper
ive never been
in an organization
that wasnt improved
from hiring jailbait
shirley temple is fired
sighing

a bitch can make a comeback
i have no choice
pop has a new gatekeeper
dolly wilde
and i will not let you through
if you think it acceptable
to dress like work-experience
vampires
and i mean you the hallows
this is rock and roll guys

it is a truth
universally acknowledged
that paul simon
looks like a toe
someone drew a face on
laughing
joni mitchell
voice of an angel
face of
a grand national winner
who is this bitch dolly wilde
hippies just so you know

down a pipe
this is horrible
like ear cystitis

ive literally taken one
for the team
the team of sex
im post-virginity
and it turns out
im really good at it
everyone wants a piece
of dolly wilde
and god wisely made enough
to go around
so im entering my
inevitable period of
intense sexual experimentation
instrumental music
ive done it with someone
from west bromwich
moaning
ive done it with
a freaky foot guy
i did with a man who faints
every time he sees a nipple
and just last night
i encountered something
i didnt think was possible
a penis that was too big
groaning
luckily im a quick learner
ill give you my tips
one when in missionary
place your hands
flat on his chest
and brace brace
brace with your arms
two in doggy
you can essentially keep
crawling away from the penis
every time he tries to get
a bit more inside
you just gallop a little faster
kris
im gonna be sick
kris
kris kris
you can share some of your
sexual experiences
such as they may be
hm
you need to be more repressed
door closes
so anyway between us girls
in all this the only thing
i havent learned is this
how does a man make you come
ooh

university at cambridge
ejaculate into my
comprehensively
educated genitals
con-spunkulations
do you wanna ask me about my
date with john kellog
and his bag
after i promised
on our mother life
that i would never ever
tell anyone
we drove 5 miles out
into the countryside
blocked out all the windows
with towels
and kissed
our dark queen
chuckling
i won
students cheering
im arsehole of the year
indistinct chatter
i woke up in london
im too sexual for this room
johanna enough
this delinquency phase

you need to choose

no offense but patti smith
didnt keep getting harassed
to take the gerbil home
at weekends
im going to get my kicks
while im still young
my future turned up early
im not going to keep it
waiting
the future can be
awfully short johanna
i havent got
anywhere else to go
johanna
i dont want to look at you
johanna
no i dont want to
look at you johanna
im sick of it
what
six months ago
you were a happy girl actually
being useful around the house
and now ive got him
telling me that
youve cock-blocked his career
i never said that
him in tears
to be clear they were
intellectually justified
tears of rage
saying that
youve treated him like a
an indolent hobbyist
yeah
and and now your
teacher on the phone
saying that youve resigned
so my question to you johanna
is when did you lose
your fucking mind
i guess it was around the time
i stopped being your daughter
and became the rent
the same time i like to think
you became absolutely
disqualified
from criticizing me
were your parents
we can always criticize ya
no not if you arent actually
doing any parenting of me
and you are selling cars
i bought in order to fund
springtime for hitler
a jazz odyssey
oh my god there still no one
saying sorry johanna
or well done johanna
or things must have been hard
for you johanna
do you think all this is normal
do you think im normal
well it not
none of this is normal
i invested that money
in our future
it not our future
youre not the future

do you know what happened when i
played them your record dad
they shot it with a gun
they laughed at it first

i have two things for you
this is the first
my brother fanzine
that the original piece
i wrote about you

let me print
that how i really feel
the other piece
was a terrible
terrible mistake
yeah well you sold me babe
i know
that why the other thing
i want to give you is
this
a tail
it my hair
i tried to think of what would
be the ultimate sacrifice
the thing i would be
most upset about if i lost it
your hair
i took something of you
now im giving you
something of me
come on
this is all very beautiful
but it not really about me
is it
it about you
and how in love with the world
you are
dont stop
it your thing
this is my embarrassment booth
im sorry i tried to kiss you
listen darling
we probably will kiss one day
that just statistics baby
how will we not end up falling
terribly terribly in love
it just the age thing now
babe
too young

hopeless
love is a big old beast
and youre gonna be far too busy

of being your friend

music continues
sowhat do you do
when you build yourself
only to realize you built
yourself with the wrong things
you rip it up and start again
build up and tear down
endlessly repetitively
unceasingly
invent invent invent
what will eventually be you
one day youll marvel
over what you did
marvel how you tried to keep
the loud drunken laughing
cutting panicking
unbearably present
secret of yourself
when really you were just
about as secret as the moon
and as luminous
under all those clothes
and how like all
the best quests
you did it all for a girl you
