
palmer alaska
has luxury homes
with million-dollar views
cole and amanda have saved up
and are ready to spend
the big bucks
this log house has surprises
around every turn
now that nice
wow
ive always suspected
that i didnt want the desirable things
in life as much as i should
women cars houses movies bands
these things were how people chiseled out
a tidy philosophy of life
this cant be for real
it really serene
i never needed a philosophy of life
and one more thing
this is awesome
it only people who wanted things
felt guilty about getting
things and frustrated
about not getting things
that needed a philosophy
it might be my favorite
part of the house
the garage of cole dreams
a party shower and a sunroom
what will it all cost
i was just as pleased to get drunk
or drink a bunch and not get drunk
the main thing is the grass for me
there just so much of it
yeah
hmm
give me your weapon
i dont got one
someone that fights like you
should have a weapon
trespassin is a lot different
than armed robbery smart guy
mm-hmm
you talk too much
kyle you here
it colin
tell me you still got it man
yes
ooh that what im talking about
hey that what im talking about
you may wanna step out for a while
why that
well there a gentleman may stop by
if so
i got to shoot him
colin you one crazy son of a bitch
i got a guy in my closet
i dont know if it the same
one youre thinking of
curly headed
yeah that the one
and he alive
so far
pack your shit
did i just get promoted
yep
you goin to arkansas
im a drug dealer
im near the bottom rung of an outfit
run by a man named frog
a man ive never met before
to be honest
im not sure he even exists
what a lot of people dont know
about organized crime in the south
is that it not that organized
the term dixie mafia
has always been too generous
implied too grand a scale
there a handful of big-time operators
that run everything regionally but
it nothing like the italians
or the mexicans no families
just a loose affiliation
of deadbeats and scumbags
no code of honor
no philosophy of life
it mostly boring solitary work
but that suits me just fine
relying on other people
is the fastest way
fo end up dead in this business
you kyle
you swin
welcome aboard
ill be your co-pilot this evening
colin didnt mention id be
captaining a highway barge
yeah well youre moving wholesale now
the big leagues
what with the cones
i thought the randomness
of it might throw off a cop
well i guess that smart
im somethin of a criminal mastermind
oh youre one of those witty people
ive been called worse
you kinda remind me of a game show host
you know what kyle
it strikes me that if you wanna be
the strong silent type
you really gotta keep yourself
from commenting on every little thing
it wont be right away
but at some point soon
im gonna knock you on your ass
i suggest you keep
the bullshit to a minimum
look at you
no you act tough now
but well be friends
everybody who meets me
wants to be my friend
yeah i find that hard to believe
i mean what not to like
what kinda name is swin anyway
your mother
get in
if we go 83 the rest of the way
we wont be late
getting pulled over with drugs
makes you really late
there i go learnin again
you dont get this smart on accident
that nice to see
youre sad
no
it just most women
dont breastfeed anymore
which is a shame you know
cause breastfed babies
get fewer syndromes
i was a formula baby
your big ass im guessin had
a mouthful of the real deal
no idea
oh i bet ya did
bet you had a titty
in your mouth from day one
let call your mother and ask
she dead
i wouldnt care if all my sisters died
youre fuckin stupid
ah shit

but he said he gotta have that
adobe-marble core
mm-hmm well let me take
a look how you got this stacked
im a safety expert in this state
i appreciate
i appreciate it sir
but the thing is
we really gotta haul ass
were already pretty far
hey enough questions
fuck
what the cones for
you boys are carrying a load of faucets
stuffed with bags of powder and plug
you left from little rock
and you got a map of each state
in your glove box
im with frog
ive been ordered to intervene
so you boys not gonna have
a lot of choice
about your immediate futures
you gonna work under me
at the state park
frog got a whole new loop of clients
and im running those deals
so try not to look like deer
in the headlights
try to look angry or bored or something
so you know frog personally
ive known frogman for years
ever since a truck of his
got lost in my park

they say it aint smart to fuck around
with someone you dont know
your name is kyle ribb
you never killed a man
and your name is swin horn
you never killed a man
youre dependable
youre a project
so here how this

you may never refuse an order
and you may never quit
if you decide to run off
i will hunt you down
and i will kill you
no matter how much
ive grown to like you
do not socialize with the locals
do not bring girls around
do not draw attention to yourself
in time you two might take over
the operation
cutting me in for a humble percentage
why just think
one day this could all be yours
where the boss
vacuumin his corvette
goin on two hours
he obsessed with it
more of a german car guy myself
you think there any chance
bright is frog
ero
it fresh thinkin though
where do you think frog lives
on a ranch somewhere
i think that we will have
to work at this company
for a long time
before we ever found out
anything true about the frogman
i heard he has a pool
shaped like a lily pad
yep there you go
for a long time it just
gonna be shit like that
inconsequential falsehoods
sleep well
all nested in

so he got sent to an
indian reservation in oklahoma
were just stayin on to put things right
until he replaced
what exactly are you puttin right

it all complicated

you dont even wanna
what are we gonna do
with the money we got from this run
put it in the dryer with the rest
frog will probably be impressed
we held onto it this long you know
probably already counted it as just lost
how much you think he knows
uh maybe only that something not right
maybe he knows about every piss we take
maybe barry works for frog too
holy shit
also a possibility
you know you might be right
maybe we should get a gun
i actually might know
a pawn shop we could check out
it not halloween
what are these kids doing at my door
oh halloween for baptists
i suppose that true
come on in
thank you
you remember me
well
i didnt forget ya
this is my buddy ed
hello ed
hey
we need guns
a gun singular
for what
well we work over at the park
and we got our vacation coming up
we like to shoot targets to relax
but all we have is these shitty rifles
our boss said
we should try here for handguns
ranger bright said you should
try to get a gun from me
oh yeah he really respects you
said nothing mystifies you
hmm
shit hang on
it the seventh inning here
boys are down
freeman did and just like that
all righty
there one out
yeah we get that game going here
he tried to get a little
fancy there and it didnt work out
sorry about that
he really took that lead and
where were we
guns
that right
well i aint got no guns but uh
you can go to little rock
and get ya a gun
well we got a real problem
with city guns
we want somethin from out in the sticks
that someone dead daddy owned
what the plan for you two
you know in life
excuse me
well
it not too late to get on
a raft and float downstream
because bad things can happen to those
that dont pay the community fees
youre a little nutty
i love it
it fair to say that you traffic
in some underground goods
what the going rate
for a set of human bones
that ball swung on
there a high drive
into right center field and boy
this is gonna hurt us
depends on the person
you gonna sell us a gun or not
no i am not
because in your line of work
guns is as likely to get you killed
as it is to protect ya
and what line of work is that
rangering
hmm
what your line of work
guess im a ranger too
guess we all are
yeah
okay
thanks for the smoke
where swin
joggin
said the increased oxygen flow
helps his brain
hmm
can i help you with somethin
i need to know
how long youre stayin
and dont say to ask swin
it impossible to tell right now
and that the truth
he doesnt tell me a thing
he wont even tell me
where his family lives
well at this moment
we have no plans to leave
okay
you dont need to tell me
anything exact but
how bad is it
what you two do
i mean if you got caught
how long a sentence are we talking
rangers in trainin
park auditors
im not stupid
i should check you for a wire
right
i like you johnna
but the truth is i dont know you
where would i hide a wire
oh okay
yeah okay
well it hard to say
about jail sentences
i mean rapists get off
pot heads go to prison
depends what kinda evidence
they got or who rats you out
sometimes you can buy a way out
what is all this
are you all right
im pregnant
im pregnant
and im tryin to figure out
how to tell swin
i mean i
i could always make
somethin up and dump him
no no you cant do that
well you can if you want but
i think you should face
look i dont know
what im trying to say
should you be eating all that candy
i just wanna know where i stand
yeah
a lot of people think
that parenting is impossible
because their own parents were lousy
yeah i dont know anyone
who had good parents

we make runs all through
the south down to florida

we got buyin power now
we need to expand
well gang bangers are taking
more streets day by day
were gonna have to set up
some high-end exclusives
but what do you think frog
i think you can grow the business
any damn way you wanna grow the business
it your business now
you do what you want with it
i trust you
you feeling all right boss
maybe you took
too many hits to the head
the only mistake my mentor ever made
was not knowin when to step aside and
i dont want it to be like that with us
yeah it time i handed it over
you boys are ready
semi-retirement has a luxurious tone
to it dont you think
it does to me
ill find me a small place
out in the country
maybe over by bright park
ill open up a little curio shop
sleep late go to bed early
sell people shit
they dont need in between
we wanna have as much
good debt as possible
one day were gonna be
level six investors
right
like true capitalists
ill be like those
mob bosses in movies
sittin around in pizza joints
gettin fat
it a privilege i owe to you
you boys have made this possible
and unless there are people
stupid enough to provoke me
stupid enough to create
a threat to us or our business
be it through youth
or cockiness or ignorance
or whatever brand of idiocy
it would require
ill gladly lie dormant
in my little shell
while you two run the show
sorry about that
where were we
my actions dont seem
fo have any consequence
someone might still come to kill us
but it seems less likely
with each passing day
near as i can tell
bright death was my promotion
i guess as long
as his operation is runnin
frog dont care who runnin it
cornelius
beautiful
beautiful
like planet of the apes
oh yeah
id like to meet frog
it a good movie though
id like to know
what he thinks of me
as much for curiosity sake
as self-preservation
id like to look him in the eye
and see if it looks like a mirror
packets on hold
until i talk to ranger bright
what
what
oh
yall interrupting my exercise time
exercise
why would you be exercising
if you wanna die as soon as possible
i wonder what your rude friend
wants to do if i dont have a packet hmm
i intend to kill you by strangulation
now itll be suicide
cause im giving you a fuckin warning
why not just shoot me
all i brought are my big strong hands
what do you roll the ball
around in a circle 500 times
shut your ass up
is this an order from frog
frog said no more packets until he
finds out what happenin over here
that right
he wants to know what happened
to ranger bright
right and were probably supposed to
tell you so you can tell him
right
bull fuckin shit
are you the boss of this whole thing
dont be an idiot
wait a minute
are you the frogman
you have no intuition
intuition is for women
you dont need to worry
about intuition right now
what you need to worry about is the fact
that youre an unnecessary middleman
weve been thinking about streamlining
frog will be impressed if we can make
this operation more efficient
you are superfluous
what the fuck does that mean
you cant do that
you cant streamline
we do a whole bunch of shit
were not supposed to do
frog dont seem to mind
you dont understand
im a buffer
im a vital layer of insulation
mmm
im convinced you have a packet in here
and i refuse to tear the place up
now youre gonna hobble
right over and get it for me
how does one practice intuition
do you pray
mm-hmm
most prayers sound hollow in your head
but every once in a while one echoes
that the same as intuition
ill pray for you if you pray for me
the packet
it stuffed in the ball you asshole
what the fuck
why would you hide it from us
cause i was scared just like yall are
now i wanna know
what happened to ranger bright
he was my friend
your friend yes
you think that distributing
a manila envelope
every two weeks constitutes a friendship
to me and the ranger it did
oh
were not scared
you said were scared
same as you but that wrong
were not
consider that your baby shower
im sorry
youre right
sandra bullock is the happiest
she ever been
she views her divorce
and its fall out
as a blessing
and something she grew from
im sorry
but those magazines
are the canary and the coal mine
of western civilization
stop it theyre fun
it materialism run rampant
all that celebrity worship
and trash culture
it drivin everybody crazy
and they dont even realize it
keep talking professor
what do you think
all these zombie movies
and post-apocalyptic stories
are about the last few years
what
all these children novels
about over throwin
the government and fighting
each other to death
what are you talkin about
it mass projection
everybody wants the world to end
because if that what passing
for the american dream these days
they all wanna opt out
of what
of everything fuckin society
is that what you picture you did
opt out
touché
you wanna know the big reveal
hmm
you cant opt out
you cant i tried
i thought i had done it
but look at me
here i am
still ended up with a boss a job
and a wacky coworker
and a baby on the way
it a boy
is that a fact
it is
boy
yeah
id like to get the baby
some savings bonds for you know
save up for college
or clown school
or open a gun range
why wont you marry me
i dont not want to get married but
were still in the infatuation stage
even though were having a kid together
there no denying that were infatuated
that would be hard to deny
we should wait until after were not
attracted to each other anymore
to make a decision about marriage
it just doesnt make sense
what if that never happens
just give it time
colin was killed
cops busted into his shop and shot him
lookin for information about a car
and a dead kid they pulled
outta the swamp
ranger bright body
hasnt been found but
im pretty sure he been killed too
i sent barry over there to investigate
now he missing
they come here
and scare you half to death
then they stop by my shop
ask me if i wanted to
purchase a set of human bones
these two are supposed to be
workin for me
theyre about the worst enemies
ive ever had
i never had anybody kill my
associates or steal my money
whether they have a plan
or theyre just lost in a maze
of their own fuck ups
it dont matter now
theyre stupid
that what makes them dangerous
theyll be caught soon
and whatever happens
after theyve been caught
well
whatever wouldve happened
after theyve been caught
aint never gonna happen
youre gonna give em one last package
one last trip
somethin to make them
feel comfortable
make it close to hot springs
theyll feel lucky like uh
something goin right for em
nothing ever gonna go right
for them again
love you baby
sure you do
we shouldnt be here
gray cyprus kentucky
tell johnna gray cyprus
whatd you say
that your sisters
mm-hmm
dont be talkin in code
is he your brother or your husband
he funny
frisk em
theyre clean
get in the tub
you come on
let go get
let go
let go
let go move
oh you act tough now
but well be friends
everybody that meets me
wants to be my friend
we work for you dont we
so what were we supposed to do hmm
what would you have done if you were us
well
we both know you aint gotta do anything
to get in this spot
and i aint you
not by a long shot
nah youre a fat fuckin slob
what about the pawn shop guy
that doesnt sell anything
what do you think
i was starting to think he was frog
he was right there the whole time
so this outfit based in little rock
it aint based anywhere
why so secretive
youre planning to kill me right
oh it way passed the planning stages
first we need that cash
location of the bodies the girl
you should question swin
im not bothered by torture
well if i was gonna question swin
id have to hurry cause he
gonna be dead in a minute
and if you keep being such a pain
well well just go ahead
and shoot you in the head too
we dont need the money that bad
and we can find the girl on our own
the girl doesnt know shit
apparently not
hangin out with you two losers
if i was you
id go ahead and speed the plan up
keepin me alive is only
gonna end badly for you
dont embarrass yourself
trying to scare me
of course your brother
the only one allowed to have a gun
so well have to wait
why dont you just go ahead
and shut the fuck up right now
why do people keep doin stuff
wipin counters down
takin pictures cheatin
offendin things
fuck is the point
it evolved
many schools of thought
but in layman terms
being the most sophisticated monkey
also makes you the most confused monkey
so takin action any action at all
is a way to alleviate that confusion
what your line of work
guess im a ranger too
guess we all are
jesus just go ahead and tell me
uh
swin was never scared
he never begged or tried to sell me out
he was just
he was exactly swin to the last
you got ten minutes to pack up
and leave arkansas for good
here the money for you and the baby
you go to kentucky and you find
a town called gray cyprus
that where swin family lives
kentucky
swin got like 40 sisters
little guy will have more attention
than he knows what to do with
the baby knows something happening

lookin for revenge
go crazy
and ruin yourself
or you can get passed it

one day were gonna be
level six investors

thomas sold everything
he cashed out all the accounts
stocks bonds you name it
he said time is of the essence
thomas said time if of the essence
well
he said hurry the hell up
is what he said
this is the danger of a joint account
even if someone like family
hell is family
we can never really be sure
what goes on in another human mind
aint that right
mm-hmm
