youre the third
emperor of rome
whom ive served
first there was caligula
then claudius
and now you nero
you send general lucius
caesennius paetus
to defend armenia against
the might of parthia
im the one who invaded
armenia in the first place
i dont goddamn believe it
i dont fucking believe it
what goin on
i should be the one
to repel the parthians
not that cocksure paetus
and you order me
to safeguard what syria
from who
parthians are besieging
our legions in armenia
and there a heavy
winter coming
you better hope emperor
that the power of rome
rests solely not in the hands
of your appointed generals
but in the hearts of those
anonymous soldiers
who make up your legions
oh
proceed marcus
what is the latest
a new message
from the parthians
they demand we surrender
they give us three days
they guarantee we will not
be killed if
burn it
surrender is not an option
general
i said no
damn it
the parthians control
the pass
the scythians have cut off
our supply route here
if we dont get help
well die of starvation
do you also think
that this is all my fault
for making camp
in a place
that can easily be besieged
that this is all the result
of my incompetence
this is no time
to look back
were in no position
to sustain a prolonged siege
our own men remain loyal
but the mercenaries
have deserted
god damn mercenaries
any word from corbulo
i sent three of my best men
as emissaries
they all chose
separate routes
but the mountains are thick
with enemies familiar
with our plans
they all failed
there is one final option
take the only route the enemy
will not expect us to take
a handful
of well-prepared men
could scale the ravine
once in the forest
it a seven-day
forest march to syria
and corbulo scouts
are you telling me marcus
that a few of our men
exhausted and starving to death
will be able
to scale a cliff
walk and run
through the forest
battle the enemy
and reach syria
in just a few days
precisely
i can see that im not the
only one who has lost his head
it the only route
that will not be crawling
with the enemy
meanwhile
we can make them believe
were contemplating
the terms of the surrender
corbulo that bastard
i never imagined that
my greatest political foe
would one day be
my only hope for survival
and what if
after all this
he refuses to come
to our aid
it a risk we have to take
the route is impossible
have you already considered
whom to entrust
with this lunacy
he is a soldier
raised in the mountains
of north hispania
excellent climber and fighter
highly revered
by the auxiliary cohorts
auxiliary cohorts
he might desert
he is a soldier
loyal to rome
there are others
younger stronger
but none with his capacity
to endure
what his name
they call him noreno
do you think he will do it
if it an order
hell obey it to the end
yes an order
duty
a soldier lot is nothing
but to obey orders
to fight and sacrifice
one life
without thinking
what is hard
is to make decisions
they must leave tonight
we are all already dead marcus
your plan is impossible
i can already see corbulo
as he hears the news
of my defeat
the outcome
of my strategic blunder
his smile
we are going to need
great assistance from the gods
if we are basing our hopes
on a mountain man
but if the gods
are willing
so be it
sir
noreno the soldier is here
noreno
you called for me sir
youve been selected
to deliver a message
to general corbulo
the others failed
because they chose
a wrong route
youll go by one
the enemy does not expect
through the ravine
sir
what you ask of me
is impossible
impossible or not
that our only chance
to survive
i am aware
of your qualities
i didnt select you
for your obvious skills
you were chosen because of
your rare capacity to endure
if anyone can succeed
it you
we have provisions
for only two more days
if the enemy doesnt
kill us then
the lack of food
or the cold will
the entire roman legion
destroyed disgraced
you must succeed
when do i leave
now
when you leave the camp
run straight for the ravine
scale its walls
once in the forest head southwest
till you hit syria
and corbulo scouts
help me return to rome
help me see my son
i will do my best
when you reach corbulo
give him this
that parchment
bears paetus seal
oh may the gods
protect you
go out from here and run
as if hades himself
were pursuing you
for rome
im sorry my friend
go
run
come on
no
si
another idiotic roman
who believes he can cross
these terraces to seek help
what do i do with him saka
damn proud romans
when are they ever
going to stop
their pride
is what makes them great
they cant go far
look over there
here
here the famous ravine
go
two of the romans
are dead
the other scaled
the cliff face
that route is impossible
nothing is impossible
if you have the will
to survive
theyre just deserters
they sacrificed themselves
so that he could succeed
he making his way
to corbulo
the persians pay us to kill
romans not to let them escape
madyes you and saulio
make your way to the river
hell have to cross it
eventually
ill send word
to the persians
yeah for now
so claudius tell me
how far have you traveled
to arrive at the frontier
hibernia
hibernia
that the edge
of the world
what a celt doing
at the roman auxiliary
i heard the pay was good
pay
like most children
on the coast of hibernia
i was captured
and taken to britannia
as a slave
i was a game keeper
ward but
they couldnt hold me
he says do you
did you ever want to return home
i was away from home
too long
i wanted to see the world
so i made my way to gaul
and joined the auxiliary
theyve been the only family
ive ever known
and for that im thankful
he says you shouldve gone
to hispania
it his land
very beautiful there
um i was raised by
my grandfather in hispania
and uh when he joined
the auxiliary
he was stationed
in britannia
so i followed him
and fought alongside him
however when he died
i decided i would return
to hispania
i carried his body
to the top of the mountain
and there i laid him down
so the vultures could carry
his soul to the afterlife
however when i returned
to the auxiliary
i met marcus
he recognized
my ability and
well he gave me
a purpose
oh oh i think he means
uh for rome
si si
uh for rome
yes
for rome
for rome
rome
for rome
let her go
get out
do you live here alone
where is your family
noreno
duria
i wouldnt do it
look let me go
i dont have anything
to give you
i know that youre
a deserter but
believe me when i say
i will not tell anyone
where you are
i will not betray you
do you think
im actually afraid
youll tell someone
where i am
im not that important
that in
theyll need
to send soldiers after me
i have no interest
in what made you desert
but let me go
you will have helped save
an isolated legion
that has no chance
of survival
i dont care about you
or your damn legion
now let see what
youve got in the bag
a message with a roman
general seal on it
i should be able to get
something nice for this
you take what you like
but you leave me that
try to remember
that you were
a legionnaire too
rome and all her glory
can burn in hell
for all i care
thank you
thank you
a soldier life
is lived outdoors
in every damn
imaginable weather
im sure that something
you cant imagine nero
but when youre
a roman soldier
you get used
to your hardships
and what doesnt kill you
only makes you stronger
look over there
who the hell are you
let me go
please i beg of you
im a roman soldier
im on a mission of mercy
my men have no food
and no water
nobody cares
least of all me
i just wanna sell you
scyles
how the hell did you get all
the way out here with just this
scyles
shit
that man belongs to me
yeah well these
bonds say otherwise
youre getting old
and slow medea
turn around
go back to your woman
solias
oh wait
you cant
i killed her
this world is mine
anyone who comes
across this patch
belongs to me
she wandered too far
and now
she paid the price
this bounty is mine
and i am claiming my reward
take my hand
take it
steady soldier
stay calm
youre safe
rest
no i cannot rest
where am i
how long have i been here
no one is following you
stay still
you are safe here
shh
you are safe
there was
nothing to animate
the drooping spirits
of the army
but the example
of their general
who endured even more
than the common
soldiers did
that was written about me
about my conquests
of armenia
whose future paetus
now holds in the
in the palm
of his grubby little hand
when our long
arduous march
took us through
hot desolate
and rugged countryside
with food
and water scarce
and the armenians
likely to launch
an obstinate defense
do you know what i did
i executed vadandus
one of the nobles
i had captured
and i cut off
his fucking head
and then i took his head
and i put it in
the ballista
and i sent it catapulting
into the enemy
fortifications
and they took it as a
a portent
they hastened to surrender
that a true story
would you have had
the wiles to act as i have
no
only a true soldier
has such an imagination
ah
you are awake
how long was i out
almost a day
a day
i really must
go yes
i heard a few mumblings
a name duria
tell me
from what do you run
bandits
other romans perhaps
did you desert
your legion
im no deserter
i too
was a soldier of rome
but that was
a long time ago
i have a mission
to complete
we each have
a mission to complete
where are you headed
soldier
to the euphrates frontier
i carry a message
for general corbulo
the lives of an entire
legion depend on my success
i see i am in the presence
of an uncommon man
did you come across
the mountains
from paetus encampment
yes
and where did you serve rome
in another life
a distant life
i served under
general vespasian in judea
vespasian
mm-hmm
but he was the only leader
capable of putting down
the jewish revolt
against nero
and his practice
of rewarding
and releasing his oldest
and most loyal
of soldiers is
well it known by all
he legendary sir
i would have very much
liked to have served under
such a great general
now i serve a great king
i do not understand
come
drink and eat
you need to regain
your strength
i know this country well
your destination
is not far
the most direct route
is across a span of desert
that lies between here
and the euphrates river
i recommend staying out
of the sun
if you can
and stick to
the dry river gullies
perhaps not the most direct
route across the desert but
they will protect you
sir without knowing it
youve not only
saved my life
but the lives
of an entire legion
i am forever in your debt
do not thank me
i would do this
for any man
roman persian scythian
im glad im the only one
to hear you say this
it could be your death sentence
for betrayal against rome
in the name of rome
i killed many men
now in my wildest
nightmares i recall
how sometimes
i even enjoyed it
but i was the one
who died
enemies
no
men
in truth
all of them equal
all of them
children of god
equal
and how may i ask
did you return to life
after being dead
by listening to the words
of a crucified man
you should not speak
this way to anyone
least of all
a roman soldier
are you not aware
that nero has sentenced
all christians to death
i no longer fear anything
not death
and least of all nero
without fear
we are free
would you still be free
in a prison cell
condemned to the gallows
or in the coliseum
facing wild beasts
more free than ever
and you do you not
want to be free
well
well as strange
as it may sound sir
these last few days
i think i felt freedom
for the first time
although i was pursued
by my enemies and
quickly chased down
and they were ready to kill me
ive never felt so alive
ive really reveled in these last few
days away from the army
then it may be that one day
you will know real freedom
like me
without killing
and perhaps someday
you will explain to me
this truth of yours
that makes all men equal
and free
but for now i must go
i am very grateful
for your help
saul
my name is saul
i am noreno
i packed
some provisions for you
you said that in life
we all have a mission
to complete
have you completed yours
no
wait
here
take this
god go with you soldier
you are a good man saul
i will not forget you
i dream that your
your precious fool
of a general
paetus is close
to surrender
his men are starving
his mercenaries
are deserting
the enemies of rome
have surrounded him
and have cut off
his supply of lines
emperor
had i led the legion
to reclaim armenia
for rome
we wouldve been
victorious by now
why hasnt he sent
for me for help
too proud
too vain
too stupid
yet i hear nothing
i hear nothing
do you emperor
nothing
no galloping hooves
no there no insistent
footsteps
no one no one has come
no one no one to help
not a single damn messenger
you ordered me here to
not to marshal my forces
unless paetus himself
sends word that i must
come to his aid
three legions are at risk
of annihilation
because of your poor judgment
and youve condemned your
most able general to wait
well im waiting
not good enough
get up
that the spirit
show me roman
youve done well
better than anyone
couldve imagined
but there comes a time
between hunter and prey when
they both know it must end
youre better than this
sand
im not done with you
have my fun get up
youre gonna tell me
who taught you how to run
that it
that the fight
im looking for
we each have
a mission to complete
do you not want to be free
your mission is over
i will give you
the sweet release of death
now tell me
what is your name
i like to know the names of
things im going to kill
do it
no
your life
is meaningless to me
now you end
this macabre chase
or i swear
itll be your last
permission to speak
general
well what do we have today
is it urgent
some of the patrolmen found a
legionnaire in the euphrates
he claims to be
one of paetus men
wow
paetus
well he must be a deserter
it doesnt seem
to be the case
he says he a messenger
paetus dares
to send me a messenger
where the fuck is he
outside waiting
he was armed only
with this
he insists that he alone
will hand you the message
make him come in
what your name soldier
legionnaire quintus
laberius surus
second cohort
fourth scythia legion sir
i carry a message sir
from general paetus
to general corbulo
so youre bringing me
a message from paetus
yes sir
oh im sorry
but youve come here
for nothing
valerius see to it
that this man eats well
and reward his efforts
no no dont
please sir
you must help us
ill not allow that tone
soldier
that useless
fucking paetus
the situation
is all his fault
settling on such
a mountainous area
so goddamned
easy to attack
but sir
wont you do it
for the soldiers sake
they have no fault
in the poor decisions
of their general
who do you think you are
talking to me like that
you speak insolently
yes
youre right
the general bad decisions
are not the men fault
that what war is like
im not gonna help paetus
valerius
come on
no
im sorry soldier
why wont he help us
thousands of my men
will die
oh what is it amariah
what have i done now
i gather youve heard
my reply
to the messenger
didnt you
i have told you
that business of rome
is not my concern
yes you have
especially as i am
your mistress
not your wife
especially as
im not roman-born
amariah
although
i was not born here
but this is my country
your country
which is a claim
of the state of rome
that should unite us
not divide us
well all right
it true
ive refused
general paetus
plea for help
and ive sent
his messenger back
on his way empty-handed
my orders from emperor nero
are clear
im to remain here on
the banks of the euphrates
to safeground the
syria on behalf of rome
i do
not understand you gnaeus
for weeks you prowled the halls
of this palace at night
sleepless agitated
awaiting general paetus
to swallow his pride
and ask for your help
no
beg for your help
then when he finally does so
there no glory in arriving
too late amariah
oh
the young soldier boy
he should be admired
i mean look at the distance
that he traveled all alone
through no-man-land
wilderness
amuck with cutthroats
and parthian assassins
poor guy
went over mountains
through forests
across desert land
it astonishing
that he managed
to make it at all
he was desperate
no
he a soldier
in service to rome
he fulfilled his duty
i have been
always impressed
by the willpower
certain men exhibit
when faced
with an impossible mission
well which is why history
will be remembered
such as generals
as great men
generals
im talking about
simple soldiers
like that messenger
who you dismissed
without a second thought
he did his duty
you have told me many times
of how you above all
the other generals
particularly paetus
appreciated the value
of good soldiers
and without them
and their stalwart strength
even the most
best military commanders
would have no chance
of victory
are you saying
i risk being forgotten
because i didnt come
to the aid of a general
who no better than a cur
no my darling
your place in history
is more than guaranteed
in your celebrated single-handed
military victories
general paetus
cannot fall further
in esteem
than he already has
he humiliated himself
in front of his men
and most importantly
in the eyes
of the roman emperor
but if he dies
all alone in mountains
of armenia
then good riddance
if he dies holed up
in the barren cold
under vicious attack
besieged
possibly fighting
for his life
with his last breath
no that unlikely
there always
the possibility
he will become a martyr
even a posthumous hero
paetus
a hero
yes
a martyr hero
who gave his life for rome
legends my love
do not necessarily rise
from the facts of an event
but from the most romanticized
version of a story
the story that people
most wanted to hear
the hero they wanted
to believe in
oh well
what would you have me do
deny paetus
his immortality
march to his aid
do not grant him
a martyr death
if paetus returns
to rome
hell continue
his campaign to slander me
and the fucker
has the emperor ear
slander the man
who rescued him
uh-huh
his savior
the general
who liberated him
from the jaws
of a certain death
no
not even paetus
is that stupid
and of me
what will be whispered
about me behind my back
they will say
there goes
the great and honorable
general corbulo
who was so moved
by the courage
of a single soldier
a messenger
who weathered
an impossible journey
to plead for help
my advice to you general
is to praise this faithful
servant of rome
say nothing of paetus
instead
speak in complimentary terms
of unsung heroes
do this
the legions will love you
no one will speak
a bad word against you
you have condemned
your political rival
in a life sentence
of public gratitude
of singing your praises
through clenched teeth
are you sure
youre not secretly
roman-born amariah
you speak with the wisdom
of one with intimate knowledge
of this political
machinations of the capital
politics are the same
everywhere
as is the quest for power
internal and universal
the only thing
that ever changes
is the names of those
who wield the scepter
or the sword
go
go
valerius
summon the tribunes
i want to see them immediately
the troops must be ready
to march at dawn
congratulations soldier
do you know
what youre going to do now
well im going to return
to armenia
youre gonna go back
but your mission
was a success
yes
but when i was
on my way here
i met a man
and he said to me
that in life
we all have a mission
that needs to be fulfilled
and i feel like i still
havent fulfilled mine
and id like to think
that maybe
somewhere out there
there a woman
waiting for me
and i can live a life
in peace
well
may the gods help you
in your new life soldier
