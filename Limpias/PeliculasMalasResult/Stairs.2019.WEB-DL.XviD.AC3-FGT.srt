
what
a date with a woman in that
village a long time ago
i was cute
be careful i think you ’re an insider
shoot if you shoot
are you still in the village
probably
what
can not understand
separate the hands and check the tent and truck
i watch the surroundings
youre the dead body
all right
who
are you serious
to there
sit down
this woman
why in the tent
what is she
dont go down
what is that woman
the prisoner in the tent
i got my finger cut off
why dont you kill me
it a civilian
3 people look around
right now
clerk
what is your mission
stop
what is our mission  a simple question
kill all the humans in the enemy camp
collect the materials
this woman was also in the enemy camp
yeah but she
shoot and kill
pull out the gun and shoot this woman
i feel responsible for my brother death
but she irrelevant
shoot as i was told
command is absolute
there is someone over there
how many enemies are there
apparently there are at most 3-4 people
ask walker for rescue
roger that
it ’s a fierce shootout that calls for rescue right away
this one too
it is a strategy change
gather in a helicopter
rescue does not come
youre a lie
come on
hurry up
fucking bastard
we are the same
<the order is absolute>
let go
ill run away
over here
what
nothing apart
if you have something to say
nothing
really
what did you say
to whom
that prisoner woman
kia spoke
what story
dont go down
is it your mama
stop
<dont go down>
wait lie
there are stairs
let go quickly there is quite a lot to the top floor
fine
i forgot about the past
i cant forget
dont worry it true
is it just me  it doesnt arrive even if it goes up
are you okay
i wait here
no good
i have a bad feeling
me too
are you all okay
are you all safe
it settled
look at someone
i go
no
calm down
power problems
buxton
buxton
shit what
no good
dont go down
run
go up
is that no good either
wireless communication
what happening
god work
god is trying
dont say silly
she is right
when did you become pious
because of my first mission when i was 9 years old
if you were escorting the prisoners ---
surrounded by convoys by the rebels
i was caught with the prisoners too
it took 5 months to escape
behind their hideout ––
there was a clock tower with a long staircase
they are every day
everything was scattered on the stairs
like broken glass or safety pins
we took off our shoes
walked on it
repeat over and over again
all day long
i was told that i was a soul judge
so no doubt
this is punishment
what
kill the prisoners
dont talk silly
thinking about the current situation
there will be danger every few minutes
i have to run away
first ill find the exit
dont talk useless
that an order
let go up
i feel like im climbing the same stairs all the time
even if you reach the top
it looks like im back down
there is an exit
hold the gun
with an enemy
already one person was killed
what is this
no way now
stop it no
impossible
that right
after all it may be punishment
i can not do it
go down
dont say stupid
what should i do
i do not understand
but below is dangerous
why do you know it is dangerous
i feel
im sorry ---
believe in god better than you
stop it ryan
certainly i swore loyalty
but it ’s not going to hell
this song again
my mother sang when i couldnt sleep
i cant sleep
it a creepy song
what will you do
let go up
until when
eternally
thought to me
try talking
you should run away before that
let go
so what
im just beginning to see
are you going to hell soon
ford is noisy
mostly about prisoners
the date and place of detention are written
that woman is from calcars
it seems like i was restrained for a long time
aside from that
the instruction do not kill her
her synonym is also listed
what
the prophet of death
local superstition
i think you can understand it without explaining
this situation is obviously related to her death
what  kia
is it my fault
i apologize
if you say too much
ill kill you
stop stanton
shut up garrett
everyone set the clock
nolan and walker watch over the door
everything else is reconnaissance
reconnaissance
do you get it
same as usual training
it a situation that doesnt make sense
there no need to stay on the stairs
let find a solution
ford comes with me
what
can not understand
what if you dont come back
walker
listening
what wrong
dont come
emma
lower the gun
please drop the gun early
listen to the story  lower the gun
walker
come to help
please
walker
what about walker
i have to go
<dont go down>
need a strategy
this is different from training
i know
really
what is it then
obviously supernatural power is working
that power seems to want to stop our actions in the past
i want to save the prisoners
what will you do
do nothing
eh
wait i dont understand what you mean
do nothing
i should have decided to die when i took on the mission
once on the battlefield every danger awaits
will this is not the battlefield
no it ’s the battlefield
my mission was to kill people in
the enemy camp and collect information
mission completed
if you are destined to die here
that kind of contract
dan death was a disaster
but dont drag too much
your judgment will slow down
my brother death is my responsibility
prioritized emotions over missions
either way my brother may have died
but even now every time i close my eyes
the moment my brother died crosses my head
i just regret
younger brother wasted
for something big
we are disposable pieces anyway
just follow the instructions
i understand your feelings
can nolan go first
i have a leg injury so it takes time to walk
go
harris stop it
ill kill you
that probably right
this fucking guy
wake up
stop it already
ill go
standing
i cant
go
dont be stupid stand up
save the prisoners
correct the past--
the future should change
no i cant leave
let go
who else has limited legs
dont pick your finger within 24 hours
really angry
it ’s torture as walker says
let me rest a little
i ’ve been out twice
i returned to the same past both times
do you remember where you were at that time
i divided myself and watched around
attack from the left
so run to the right and in front of the tent
how can clark avoid killing prisoners
just tell the past about the circumstances
what if a man just like you suddenly appears
ill kill you
exactly
you dont have to touch yourself in the past
our ambush fails if we inform the enemy
what if the enemy killed me
come on
it ’s like “back to the future”
i like the third work
ignore the present
i cant think of another good strategy
if you scare your enemies they may escape from there
what are you waiting for
if nobody is gone let go home
i think it impossible
unbearable for a long time on
the battlefield without supplies and rescue
am i left
there are no exceptions for everyone
no
just drive them away
separate the hands and check the tent and truck
i watch the surroundings
youre the dead body
who
this woman
what are you doing
i confirmed my finger
why does my finger return
something might have changed
what is that woman
nothing has changed
clerk
what is your mission
stop
what is our mission  a simple question
it time already
what is your strategy
not particularly
shoot stanton
no all will survive
is that possible
command is absolute
i have to go back to the door
if you start running you will be shot
but i have to go
shoot the ground only once
someone is over there
go
my legs are dangerous
im worse
ill try again
now let go back and help the prisoners
there is time between when an enemy soldier gets up and when he attacks
let enter a tent while attracting with a gunshot
i
nolan is impossible and two people
lack in preparation and training
shut up and leave it to me
what if i cant make it
that right
wait until you return
now
my back was shot
may breathe
<all right>
what is that woman
the prisoner in the tent
i got my finger cut off
why dont you kill me
what is your strategy
same as before
help ford after driving away with a gun
command is absolute
there is someone over there
stop it
nolan and the two of us go back together
how many enemies are there
apparently there are at most 3-4 people
ford standing
look
ill go
how about two people
hurry up  let go
die if you dont pick up bullets
i have to stop bleeding
bite this
believe
sorry
hang in there
finished
i wont hold it for a long time unless i see a doctor
what is your strategy
there
ford firmly
otherwise ill die
this strategy does not work
shut up
he right
then another good idea
if you reach the helicopter
escape from here and help ford
if we die on the battlefield in the past we will disappear
no abnormalities
fine
pitiful guys
let stop him
still not possible now
<the order is absolute>
which one
im back again
thought to fail
noisy
stop  are you listening
damn it
let move
ill regret it if i take it off
right
but ill take it off
now try a different method
<what  〉
<can not understand>
what is that woman
the prisoner in the tent
i got my finger cut off
nolan
two people look around
right now
pull out the gun and shoot this woman
shoot as i was told
ive besieged release the prisoners
you can negotiate with this
who are you
if you dont release the prisoners youll kill all
it ’s a lie to be surrounded
if it ’s true i ’m already dead
do you get it
so what is your request
release the prisoners and leave
then dont kill
unfortunately
command is absolute
quickly
i dont know how long i will hold
good luck
for what
to challenge
the prisoners were destined to die
im sure we too
it the worst
maybe already dead
you must have thought about it once
i said walker was torture
here is hell
<what  〉
<can not understand>
someone is over there
why dont you kill me
it a civilian
ill stop
i cant stop it
is that so
two people go
you can get out of here if you save the prisoners
this hell never ends
absolutely
ill finish
where did you do it
i was in the enemy
i brought it
now i know why
nolan may be right
i wont die
the worst strategy
right
im sure there is another way
forget
to the container
save them if possible
join the helicopter
it ’s going to be a battle
i want to help as many people as possible
what is that woman
pull out the gun and shoot this woman
shoot as i was told
someone is over there
what are the materials
is that all
i dont know
kill all the enemies
<fine>
<i will help>
<standing>
<firmly>
what are you doing
lower the gun
first aid and return to duty
the important thing is to act correctly
rather than command
now i know
it will be the worst ending
doesnt work
do not remove
i wont remove it
come with me
good
it is a strategy change
gather in a helicopter
<the order is absolute>
it all right now
do not worry
should be fine
who are you
save the civilian command
it not a taxi
begging because it okay
there are others wait a moment
wait only 2 minutes
it was safe
can i rent a car
do whatever you want
lost sight of
what about stanton
im dead
why is that woman
new order take her with you
watch your fingers
what are you doing  let go early
kia what are you doing
go
you heard  go
the traitor
kia
you are expelled from the unit
why such a manet
the instruction was wrong
keep silent
stanton  this fucking guy
quickly
where are you
radio returned
is the civilian safe
everyone is on a helicopter
go already
i cant go
back to help
no
go
command
okay good luck
did you correct the mistake
yeah
if there is a way to stop the battle
the battle never ends
so be
very cold
right
do you remember the song that mom sang
i was saved by that song
what is the headquarters
speak honestly
stanton shot clark
i unavoidably shot him
no materials found rescued civilian pow
wait lie
there are stairs
let go quickly there is quite
a lot to the top floor
