penalty is for impersonation
in this state
go find yourself a corpse
nice to have met you
sighs
christopher
yeah
do you really have a theory
no not really
but there is a possibility that
uh there a gang war going
on between the black gangs
and the chinese gangs
and that guy was
definitely no wasp
you know what i think
i think the best move
to make is keep an eye
on each end in this town
right now
right now
oops sorry
hey wait
wait
hey
hey
hey you driver wait
music playing

almighty be with you
may your soul rest in peace
puking
may the peace of your
life with you forever
and ever and ever amen
gagging and coughing
you all right sam
yeah ive just never seen
anything like that before
yeah neither have i looks
like two murders in two days
in the same station jesus
well looks like your
murderer wasnt greedy
they say they found
a full wallet on him
so that leaves out robbery
that good thinking ed
that very good thinking
guess what i wanna make a
statement about yesterday
ok just a moment
ok
that uh body that
was found in the subway
yeah
it was definitely dead
and the department figures that
the probable cause of death
was murder
thank you
you wanna know what i think
yeah
about four years ago it
was a story in the papers
it seems that when they were
building the old subways
they had to break
through the sewers
and it seems that
a lot of workmen
broke through the sewers and
were attacked by animals
these were animals
that had become
mutant dogs cats rats
alligators all the throwaways
and they developed
senses that other animals
didnt have fangs claws
theyre wild
they lived off each other
survival of the species
and they attacked the workmen
now i think it very possible
that those workmen did not seal
up the sewers where they
should have been sealed up
and that those animals are
roaming through the subways
hey thanks
youre welcome
for the story
hey come on
youre not gonna
print that are ya
sounds like an edgar alan
poe story for christ sakes
hey look sam
let start using some
rational logic huh
and lesson one keep your mouth
shut in front of reporters
save the horror
stories for the kids
come on
magmore stay
here with this body
until the guys from
the morgue get down
police point the finger
at underground animals
according to a
well-informed source
the recent subway murders may
be attributed to mutant cats
rats and dogs
inbred and inhabiting
the subways for several years
christ that all we need
well have every little old
lady who sees a mouse asking
us for protective custody
well i got carried away
well next time
dont get carried away
now weve got definite
reports on fighting
between the chinese
and the black gangs
in the same areas
as the murders
now this first guy was chinese
the other guy just may have
been some unfortunate bystander
but the way both
bodies were mutilated
i cant help thinking that--
well anyway this is
what were going to do
ok i put men on stakeout at
every subway station from 68th
street down to 96th street
that gives us a cordon
around the entire area
where the murders took place
ive also got a hotline to
a team of social workers
down in chinatown
thatll keep us informed
of any unusual movement
if anything happens
well know about it
hopefully well know
about it in time
christopher what about
my theory about the uh--
dont worry about it sam
even one of your
saber-toothed rats
wont get through
the net weve put up

luke the amulet of mendow
i told him to put it back
i thought it might be
sacred but why would
your people kill him for it
old man please mr
curtis let me continue
this amulet holds the
answer to all that
has happened in recent days
it was brought to me by a
number of the red dragons
unfortunately the killer must
have thought he still had it
that is why he is dead
you come 0000 miles and
to be foiled in a search
there still hope
it is amazing
i dont understand
2000 years ago
the sorcerer master
lung-ton would allow seven
men to be possessed by demons
and these he would use to
terrorize villages and cities
master chang-dao produced the
emerald in which he trapped
the spirit of the demon
this is the amulet
your friend took
from this the monster is
released into the world
as long as this amulet
exists  the demon
is deprived most of his power
even though he is still strong
he is unable to tolerate light
that is why your subways is a
perfect place for him to hide
in my head your story is
fantastic but in my heart
i know that you
speaking the truth
the demon will stop at
nothing to regain this amulet
by destroying it it
will be free forever
immortal and indestructible
in a way i feel
responsible for this
i chose rodan to go with
me in the first place
what must i do
you must wage the combat
our only chance is this amulet
challenge the demon
defeat him and we are saved
lose and the demon
will eat the soul
of the man who challenged him
the demon or try to
attack your mind
he can assume the forms
of those you love most
and those you fear most
it will use every
trick at its disposal
i shall try to help
in the only way i can
while you are fighting i
will place my mind with yours
perhaps together we will
be stronger than one alone
this is for those
rats underground
squeaking squeaking
squeaking squeaking yes
and then all of you
god is nobody fool
cant you see
luke this is the only
thing that can stop him
i know you cant buy it
i couldnt buy it either
that right i cant buy
it especially the part
about you going down there
i dont need any dead heroes
ive got four guys
to take care of that
chris you wont
be able to hit it
with anything that can stop it
as a matter of fact
youre going to be
picked off alone or together
if i dont make it
then you can in
spiritual leaders at best
moses is dead
mohamed is dead
buddha is dead
and im feeling so--
that my job
so for the last time
the answer no
christopher let go
ok

pestiferous rats
shrieking squeaking
lusting to sink their
teeth into your weak heart
