starting partying way too much
all right you
made your point
just tell you story
how you want it
all right
this hot chick named nina
started partying way too much
her grades were slipping
so her parents grounded her
now if her grades improved
they have her a second chance
but with an early curfew
now as you can guess
on her first night out
nina was having such a good time
that she didnt make
it back on time
and when she finally
did get home
she found all the lights out
she tried the front door
wasnt locked
so instead of just
going on inside
she went around back and
climbed the old oak tree
beneath her bedroom window
as she had done so
many times before
next morning nina
wakes up early
it was quiet
so she thought maybe
her folks went into town
without waking her
when she reaches the
bottom of the stairs
she sees blood everywhere
she runs in the living room
to find her parents
mangled bodies
she screams when she
sees written on the walls
in their blood the words
lucky you didnt
open the door
asshole you trying to
give me a heart attack
look im sorry i
heard this story before
and i thought it would be funny

abigail possessed her
why cant you believe me
calm down calm down
you need to get some
rest all right
ill have a transcript
made of this recording
and well go from
there all right
i promise
did you guys find jessica
we did
is she
im afraid so
michele
time for your meds
good afternoon
detective henderson
judy
are you done
actually were done
take care michele ill be
in touch soon all right
well talk
detective youre
not gonna find sophia
not unless she wants you to
ill be in touch
detective henderson
howard how are you
fascinating person
this abigail barker
she was a real person then
oh yeah absolutely
she was born in 670
what else can you tell me
well
this abigail barker was
put on trial in 692
and she was found
guilty of practicing
acts of witchcraft by
the local magistrate
she was then tortured
which was standard
practice at the time
and then eventually executed
really
okay wait a minute
how easy would it
be for my witness
to have access to
that information
well anyone can research it
but i suppose why
would be my question
and then
how would they even find
this book in the first place
which by the way
happens to be a compellation
of spells and incantations
to tell you the truth i as
hoping you were gonna tell me
that abigail barker was
just a bunch of folklore
and that book a
bunch of nonsense
now i can get back to work
and get that book carbonated
what else do you got for me
well i dont know
if it relevant at all
but i also found
some documentation
of accusations against
witches using amulets
to transform
themselves into animals
and even powerful
creatures supposedly
youve gotta be kidding me
no it was actually
documented multiple times
during the witch trials
well that about
all i have for now
but keep me posted on
what happens okay
most
definitely thank you
all right
goodbye
howard
who is that
you know who this is
no i dont know you
oh but you do
it abigail
no
that not possible
arent you a believer
take a seat professor
i said sit down
i dont understand
youre no different
than they were
it seems the professor has
been telling tall tales
to detective henderson
people love tall tales
wouldnt you say
i suppose
when i was younger
i used art and spells
to connect with nature
i only meant good back then
the folks people lied
and labeled me a witch
they did unspeakable
things to me
and i now you know the rest
but they couldnt destroy me
because i choose darkness
my ally
we have just been
waiting to find someone
to give me my vessel
the book of spells
ah youre a smart
man professor
so im sure you understand
that until i find my book
i only need a little blood
sacrifice here and there
professor let see what
dead flesh feels like
sleepy time
so dr flanagan said that i
could go home in a day or two
dont you think
it a bit too soon
why do you say that grandma
youre still having episodes
the neighbors
are talking huh
you know i dont
care about that
so then why do you have a
problem with me coming home
i dont
how travis mom doing
well
as well as can be
expected you know
they all blame me huh
honey until this thing
gets all sorted out
people are gonna talk
theyre gonna come to
their own conclusions
yeah well im a victim
in this too grandma
i know you are sweetheart
you know
sophia parents have put up
a reward for her safe return
she not coming home
she dead
i mean how many times
do i have to keep
telling people this
sophia is not sophia anymore
sophia killed travis she killed
all of my friends grandma
oh honey
that why i dont
want you to be
in such a hurry to come home
grandma i dont wanna stay
in this fucking
hospital anymore
it like a fucking
prison in here
i miss all of my
friends funerals
lieutenant
what up
hey nikki
detective
looks like miles had a chance
to call 9 before he died
so approximate time
of death 90 pm
he got a single knife
wound to the chest
was also stabbed in the hands
there some claw marks
in the back of his neck
god
how did they get in
no sign of a break-in
we had to pick the front
lock to gain access
locked from the inside
what this
he wrote a name
with his blood
dont touch anything
forensics is on the way
okay that odd because miles
was doing some research for
me on an abigail barker
so we have a suspect
not exactly the abigail
barker were talking about
died in 692
i guess that was too easy
hey what about that 9 call
he only asked
for an ambulance
the line went solid after that
okay im gonna wanna
get a copy of that call
ill get you a copy
and put it in the folder
hey how that
chadwick case coming
slowly were dealing
with a very fragile victim
victim
thought she was a suspect
another girl went missing
and right now she
the only survivor
well
physically youre
in excellent shape
any pain
nope
how about the nightmares
oh yeah those havent
come around in awhile
ready to go home
sure
well im gonna change
your medication a little bit
and if you have another
day without any incidents
you can go home
sounds good to me
lower her dosage
to 25 milligrams
and let keep an eye on her
what about her
nighttime pills
just give me a
call in the afternoon
and well make a decision then
dr flanagan am i gonna
have to take these pills
once i go home
well with this medication
you cant quit cold turkey
we have to decreased
your dosage gradually
i want you to contact
your family physician
in the next two days
well send you home
with some instructions
and my notes to your doctor
okay because im ready to go
yeah i bet you are
what do you got for me
i got nothing
ive dusted head to
toe several times
i cant even find
a partial print
what about these
claw marks here
any idea where they
would have come from
they appear to
have been made by talons
however that not
what killed him
he died from a single
knife wound to the chest
what about under
the fingernails
clean
whatever it was the poor
guy didnt have a chance
