
hello
this is lou vinetti
reporting live from kjrx
i dont know if anybody
out there can hear me or not
only hours remain before earth
magnetic field declines to zero
and as most of
you know by now
once that occurs
solar radiation will destroy
the atmosphere
and god be with us all
turn the car off
i think it gone
start the car
dammit
well have to go back
get out of the car now
come on jump
ahhh
no
flights across the globe
have been grounded for 24 hours
as the comet
copernicus passes earth
which will be the largest
celestial object
in recorded history
to pass this close
it is expected to create
a global
electromagnetic disturbance
when the comet was first
discovered six months ago
good morning
hey miss penny
hey cyn
zoe that cynthia order
in the fridge over there
okay
so im taking the science club
on a field trip to watch
the comet
i heard
that very brave of you
youre coming along
too right zoe
yep
dad is letting me off work
early so i can come right dad
i suppose
next up to discuss what
unforeseen dangers
we might be facing we are
joined now via satellite
by our own
dr james mayfield
hey look who on tv
now doctor can you
explain why you believe
it possible that
the comet could hit us
when almost everyone else
has predicted
that it will pass us by
wait a minute
lou all i said was
that you cant
you rule it out
having just passed the sun
gasses in the comet icy core
will be heating
up like a hot spring
it will affect the comet
speed and trajectory
in ways that we just
cant predict
fascinating
now i understand the storm
hazard department
has sent you to northern
alaska to observe
the comet swing-by
that right
well be just inside
the arctic circle where
the comet is expected to pass
over its orbital fulcrum
meaning the closest
it will be to earth
it a very exciting opportunity
for us to observe
geomagnetic anomalies
in the earth magnetic field
thank you doctor
that was local hero and astrophysicist
dr james mayfield
via satellite from alaska
getting a signal
yep
logging in
to the satellite
last two cubans
im saving them for
a special occasion
that against
the law you know
yeah well relax peter
were in alaska
the us trade embargo
says no american citizen
can smoke a cuban cigar
anywhere in the world
alright were in
show time
you could get ten years
good point
i better smoke
both of them
hey pam
satellite link is up
you should be getting
our em readings
copy james
reading it now
across the globe eyes are
looking skyward tonight
millions of teacher and
students in every nation
get the chance to glimpse
something the great
astronomers of the past
could only dream of
okay everyone
id like to show you something
just as our planet
has a magnetic field
so does the comet
geeze
the comet going to be
going past pluto
by the time
this guy finishes
zoe could you come
up here please
hold this up
for me please
so were going to imagine that this
compass is earth
as the comet passes
the magnetic fields interact
creating intense bursts
of electromagnetic waves
which can interfere
with modern technology
so ladies no sulking if your
boyfriend doesnt return
your text
messages tonight
yo it a freaking comet
not your mother undressing
hey move it
leave him alone
hey
hey
hey
stop it
stop it
stop
stop it
youre both going to be
reimbursing the school
for the cost
of a new telescope
this guy started it
miss penny
no i didnt
he was picking on him
it mrs mayfield now and
i dont particularly care
who started it
youre both paying
for a new telescope
ill be contacting your parents about the exact cost
it bad enough you
married my father
now i cant even get
fair treatment in class
go wait by the wait by
the washroom shane
the data is looking
a bit fragmented
the electromagnetic interference
is coming on strong
yeah
our friend copernicus
seems unusually magnetic
where my lighter
viewers are probably experiences
increased interference
as copernicus reaches
what is expected to be
its closest
proximity to earth
comet is at orbital fulcrum
it should be passing over your
area in just a few minutes
we just got word that the comet
has reached orbital fulcrum
this is extraordinary
we will continue
to broadcast
we may lose our signal
we apologize for that
an electromagnetic
storm from the comet
is affecting our electricity
whoa whoa
we just had a surge in
the electron acceleration
the fields em levels
are skyrocketing
the radiation belt is being
pushed in to the atmosphere
pam are you reading this
yes
im measuring a radiation
spike in the belt safe zone
45 million
angstroms and rising
wait that odd
im getting a second
set of separate readings
from the comet
magnify sector lp4
i see something
in the tail
copernicus is fragmenting
a piece of the comet
is breaking away
we cant see anything
can you read
the fragment specs
projectile diameter
is 300 meters
velocity of 30
kilometres a second
what the trajectory
descending at
45 degrees
it going to hit earth
use the belt electron
trajectory to triangulate
a point of impact
working on it
latitude 5
longitude 79
james that only 00 miles
from where you are
james did you hear
what i said
get out of there
notify iew
to issue an alert
repeat notify iew
to issue an alert
pam do you copy
dammit
where is the projected
point of impact
i dont know
i lost her
maybe i can
amplify the signal
shockwave
get back in the car
what the point
were dead
we cant outrun
this blast
avalanche bunker
at the bottom of the hill
what
step on it man
try and put in the data
in case we dont make it
james
peter get out of there
come on
reports of massive damage
and casualties have been
coming in from alaska
northern canada and
eastern russia
communication is still
down throughout
these affected areas
as the death toll rises
were getting estimates
the as many as a quarter million
people may have perished
in this history-making disaster
one piece of
good news to report
local resident
dr james mayfield
has miraculously
survived the blast
despite being within a few
hundred miles of ground zero
when the comet struck
he is expected to be
arriving home today
james
i thought i lost you
it good to be home
hey buddy
hey dad
you okay
yeah
welcome home
thanks
who wants coffee
i would love one
well uh im sure you guys
have lots of science stuff
to talk about
shane i just got home
sit down with us
im kind of tired
i feel like laying down
he got into a fight
and broke a telescope
im making him and the other
kid pay for it
sorry
no no
dont be sorry
i dont envy
either one of you
i wouldnt want
a step-mother for a teacher
or a step-son
for a student
yeah well now that
youre home
youre going to have to do
all the disciplining
otherwise he never going
to let me get close
deal
of all the different
scenarios that could happen
if a comet hit earth
i wonder mr president
does the impact
of the comet create
any lasting effects the public
should be concerned with
were still investigating
that possibility
but right now it doesnt appear that there anything
the public needs
to be worried about
youve gotta be joking
what
a 300 metre projectile hits the planet at 30 kilometres per second
and he saying there
nothing to worry about
maybe he just doesnt want
to scare the public
unlike some people i know
my science advisors
have reported
that the immediate
crisis is over
so the important thing for
the american people to know
is that they are safe
and they can go on about
their daily lives
this is unbelievable
james i know you went through a terrible ordeal in alaska
but youre home now
so let somebody else
do the worrying
for a change
enjoy being with
your family
youre right
youre right as usual
the united states of
america stands
what is that
terrible sound
is it an earthquake
take cover
shane you okay
yeah
what
what
what do you mean
it been classified
just what i said
all the data
we collected in alaska
and uploaded to the government
has been classified
and neither you nor i have
the clearance to access it
in fact we shouldnt
even be talking
about this right now
the whole department
is under a gag order
the tremor we just had
was preceded
by some kind of
em disturbance which could mean
there been serious damage
to the magnetic field
yeah i recorded an
electromagnetic spike earlier
but i didnt know
what caused it
we need the comet data
who classified it
the administration
great
not even a comet hit is
immune to public spin
well maybe there really
was some damage to the field
and they dont want
to disclose it to the public
we need to find out
youve reached the office
of the president
science advisors
due to
extenuating circumstances
this office will not be taking
calls until further notice
what are you doing
up on the roof
tracking the sun
and why would you be
tracking the sun
it not where it
supposed to be
why would you say that
yesterday the sun set
behind eagle peak
what do you mean
it never set
behind the peak
exactly
hello
hey is this shane
yeah who this
it zoe
i was just calling
to tell miss penny
that the pastries are ready
pastries
yeah were donating them for
the school disaster fund drive
so she can pick them
up whenever she wants
okay yeah ill
let her know
okay bye
bye
zoe just called
the pastries for
the fund drive are ready
you want me to go
pick them up for you
that would be
great shane
thank you
can i help you
how it going
good
youre here to pick up the stuff
for your mom right
she not my mom
okay
step-mom
you have my sympathy
id die if my dad married
one of my teachers
hello
hey
my god
what is it
the sun is ten degrees off
where it should be
this time of year
how could that be
okay in like an hour
you still meeting kevin
at the park today
uh yeah
okay bye
here it is
thanks
ill be at the park
with kevin
oh yeah
yeah
ill see you there
cool
hey james
hey lou
i havent had a chance to talk
to you since the interview
so what this great
story youve got for me
remember how we used
to come out here
and watch all
those sunsets
maybe that what you
came out here for
i came out here for
the babes and the booze
do you remember how this
sundial was always
right on the money
yeah i remember
hi shane
hey zoe
what am i chopped liver
so shane buddy
ive got a little problem
because of you
you see this car
my dad making me
sell it to pay
for the stupid
telescope you broke
we broke
whatever
the point is i think we can
settle this little problem
how that
drag race
you win me
you win and ill pay the $4000
we owe for the telescope
i win you pay
come on
what do you think
youre not afraid of getting
your ass whipped are ya
you wouldnt win
ouch
you hear that
greaser boy thinks
he can beat me
let do it
dr mayfield said his
suspicion was first aroused
when he noticed the sun
setting behind eagle peak
now i can tell you from my own
experiences growing up here
that the sun has never
set behind eagle peak before
and then there our
trusty sundial
which has
never been wrong
until today
ready guys
get set
ahhh
ahhh
get out
get out james
james get out
you okay
yeah you alright
i cant believe
what just happened
poor kevin
oh my god
i cant get a reception
what about you
nothing
what is that
it looks like an aurora
here
i thought those things
only happened up north
in places like alaska
something bad is happening
dr
mayfield what exactly is the problem with the axis
changing ten degrees
i mean
so what if the sun sets ten minutes later
a shifted axis tilt means
the earth axis of rotation
is out of alignment
with its magnetic poles
this could have
serious consequences
for the earth magnetic field
the seismic activity
and the electromagnetic
interference with communications
that weve been experiencing
this could all be
just the beginning
the beginning of what
a catastrophic
pole reversal
you mean like what happened a million years ago
when the north and south
poles change places
that right
back to you
yeah
yeah
alright
alright already
james buddy
we are famous
what are you
talking about
you dont know
know what
youre story caught fire
my report was picked up
by all the big networks
really
there is some weird crap
going on all over this country
that the government
does not want to talk about
but your theory
makes more sense
than these
alien invasion stories
so the networks
picked it up
good
maybe it will force the administration to come clean
yeah well anymore
earth-shattering developments
im your man right
see you lou
im your man right
see you lou
im your man
good morning gentlemen
good morning
mr president
good morning
mr president
how are you sir
who leaked the axis
tilt to the press
dr james mayfield sir
mayfield
that your son
isnt it general
yes sir
dr mayfield is my son
then what the heck is he doing
leaking classified information
im sorry sir
im not aware of
his activities
we havent spoken in
nearly five years
you dont say
well maybe now would be a good time for a family reunion
because if you dont put
a muzzle on him we will
what exactly was his
involvement with this
our storm hazard research department contracted dr
mayfield
to monitor the comet
effect on the radiation belt
so wasnt this guy on the same
gag order as everyone else
yes sir and his research
was classified
but to be honest sir
the data he updated
could not have revealed an axis
tilt as it was collected
prior to the comet hit
dont argue semantics
with me doctor
a gag order is
a gag order
i dont need 400 phone calls
coming in to the white house
every hour about a pole reversal that not going to happen
it not going to happen
right dr elman
it a preposterous
thought mr president
the consensus is that
the earth axis
will slowly fall back
in to place as it rotate
glad to hear
however this doomsday hysteria
is exactly why we need
to keep the people in
the dark right now
your son
sir
is he smart
yes sir
how smart is he
too smart for
his own good sir
that what it
sounds like
you better bring him in
yes sir
james
it really happening
all the telltale signs
this is unprecedented
what is
the pole reversal
shane didnt come
home last night
are you sure
yeah
his car not here
his bed hasnt
been slept in
and i cant reach
him on his cell
you said he was going
to the park last night
oh my god
i just heard on the radio
that the park was ripped apart
by a major earthquake
last night
let go
what going on
dr mayfield we need
you to come with us
to the airbase sir
base
for what
i dont know sir but we
have an executive order
to take you to the base
by force if necessary
ill find shane
ill call you as soon as
i know what going on
this way
anything
nothing
this is so weird
i always get
a signal here
hey dad
james
should have known
you were behind this
long time no see
five years
not too long
i guess it
just seemed so to me
did you get my
birthday card
i did
thank you
very considerate
how your son
he must be getting
awfully big by now
yes he is
you probably wouldnt
even recognize him
probably not
have a seat james
so youve caused quite
a stir in washington
how that sir
violating a government
gag order for one thing
i didnt violate
any gag order
that axis shift was
my own research
dont play games
with me james
youre either on the team
or youre not
here we go
you know full well the intent of a government gag order
everything you worked
on was classified
the public has a right
to that information
it not your call james
youre a science rat
you dont make policy
scaring the american
public is against
this country greater good
you think youre
a good soldier
youre just a lapdog
for political bosses
youd probably shoot me
yourself if they told you
it would serve
the greater good
what am i doing here
obviously it not
because you miss me
i had the president of
the united states tell me today
that my son was a national
security risk
so what
he wants to burn me
at the stake
lucky for you
he wants to hear you out
oh you mean he wants
to cover his ass
increased electronic
interference continues
to be reported from
around the world
this new development
coupled with the increase
of reported seismic activity
and the appearance
of what seems to be auroras
around the globe
has many people
figuring for the worst
oh my god
are you guys okay
what happened
where your car
this thin skin is
the earth crust
spinning liquid in
the core is the engine
which generates our
protective magnetic field
dr mayfield we didnt
bring you here
for a geology class
the shift in the axis tilt
caused slippage
of the crust around
the core
consequently the earth is
now out of alignment
with its magnetic field and
the misaligned crust
is causing increased
seismic activity
yes
were aware of all that
we just want to hear
specific evidence
pertaining to your
far-fetched notion
of a pole reversal
im assume youre aware
of beached whales
birds migrating in the wrong direction
bees swarming
yes yes
creatures realigned with
the magnetic field
for navigation were confused
a short-lived result
of the comet
temporary distortion
of the magnetic field
answer me this then
dr elman
why are polar auroras
suddenly appearing
in places they shouldnt
again a temporary distortion
of the magnetic field
similar to what occurs when
there is a bad solar storm
what are we talking
about here gentleman
aurora borealis
auroras normally occur when the earth poles attract solar particles
the fact that so many polar
auroras are appearing elsewhere
indicates that new magnetic
poles are developing
i saw a polar aurora
here last night
we are now sitting
on a magnetic pole
which explains all
the electromagnetic interference
and the seismic activity
weve been having
dr mayfield many strange
anomalies have occurred
in modern times without
catastrophic consequences
these fields are
like rubber bands
they bend
and stretch and thin
but inevitably they always
return to their original state
only this time dr
elman the rubber band has snapped
mr president the mini
poles indicate
a geo-magnetic reversal
has started
as the north and south
poles disintegrate
the magnetic field they
support will collapse
static discharges will create
electromagnetic shockwaves
which will fry
everything electronic
we will be thrown back
into the stone age
the north and south poles
will disappear
remerging at opposite ends
of the globe
at which point our protective
magnetic shield
will be completely gone
exposing us to cosmic rays which
will incinerate the planet
just like what
happened on mars
dr mayfield must
we be so melodramatic
this is real science
mr president
this planet has seen many
geo-magnetic reversals
just not since
weve been here
as a man of science i am sure
you can appreciate the need
for thoughtful
rational discussion;
however your melodrama and
sensational media appearances
gives one the impression that
your intention are perhaps
more to do
with self-promotion
ive had a long day
gentlemen
signing off
what did you expect
james
you just told them the world
was going to end
this isnt global
warming dad
where we can spend years
dragging our feet
and debating the facts
theyll find out
soon enough
wait
that the same sound
i heard just before
the quake last night
stop the car
turn off the car
my god
ive never seen
anything like this
save your data everybody
storm hazards
what just happened
oh my god james
it was a massive 40
kilohertz em pulse surge
unlike anything
weve ever seen
40 kilohertz
yes
all the cities that were
hit were blacked out
and not only that
most of the satellites
in orbit got fried
what could possibly have
created a surge like that
it gotta be connected
to the polar auroras
were the hits random
i dont know yet
we lost power during the spike
which was lucky for us
or else the em surge
would have fried everything
were just getting our
emergency generators going
were pulling up data now
im seeing about two dozen
points where 40 mile wide
electromagnetic waves
struck earth
overlay the locations of
the mini poles on your screen
and tell me
what you see
overlay the locations
of all detected mini poles
oh my god
all the hit areas are
where the mini poles are
then that it
the solar particles
attracted by the poles
are building up massive
electrostatic discharges
pam your office has to tell
all those hit areas to evacuate
including lindenville
the discharges are going
to get much stronger
as the field fails
it going to be hard
to issue an alert
with a global blackout
but well certainly
do our best
can you run a timeline
projection on your mainframe
give me a couple hours
it will take a while
to process the data
james
how do we stop this
i dont know that we can
we just had the first
worldwide blackout in history
and you and none of your brain
trust can explain why
what we know
right now for certain
are that the affected cities
were struck by large
electromagnetic shockwaves
just as dr mayfield
had predicted
general mayfield have you been
able to locate your son yet
not yet sir
he in one of
the blackout areas
well i want to speak with
him as soon as he located
yes mr president
so tell me dr elman
can you still say
with a certainty
that were not experiencing
a pole reversal
i dont have an answer
right now sir
are we going to see
more of this
give me the worst
case scenario
mr president until weve
assembled our teams
i dont want to speculate
on something
that not my area
of expertise
dont try to cover your
ass with me doctor
weve got power outages
across the country
american lives
are at risk
so tell me
to the best of your ability
are we going
to see more of this
i believe so
mr president
then i have no choice
but to declare
federal marshall law
general mayfield--
yes sir
--youll supervise
west coast operations
yes mr president
well start setting up
shelters in the affected areas
james
thank god
did you find shane
yeah he was at the park
ive been trying
to call you
our cell phones
are useless
only the landlines
are working
where is he
in the kitchen
but one of the kids he was
with last night was killed
in the earthquake
oh no
what going on
there no power and i saw
an em wave in the sky
it bad
we have to get out
of lindenville
shane
you okay
what happening dad
is the world
falling apart
no no
just going through
a rough patch
ive packed for us both
im not going with you
what do you mean
im going back
to the base
what
what are you
talking about
why
i have an idea and i have
to talk to the president
i dont want to cyn
i just dont see that
there a choice
you know what
youre right
there is no choice because
your family comes first
no wonder shane doesnt
think you love him
listen to me
this is not a drill
this is the real deal
the survival of the planet
depends on actions
taken in
the next 24 hours
and those so-called government
science advisors
dont have a clue
i have to do this
for us
okay were here
smack in the middle of a mini
pole magnetic centre
the most dangerous place
to be right now
everywhere inside this circle
is going to get bombarded
with em pulses and torn apart
by seismic disturbances
i want you guys out of
this circle as soon as possible
go to this town here
little brook and wait for me
what are you
talking about dad
youre coming right
i cant
i have to go back
to the base
i dont believe it
youre abandoning us
that sucks
shane try to understand
there a global crisis
going on
you think
i dont know that
i saw one of my classmates
crushed to death
in a car last night
i know i know
im sorry
so you dont care if the
same thing happens to us
of course i do
that why
i have to fix this
well be okay
leave me alone
shane come on
if an em wave hits turn
the car off until it passes
the electronics wont be
short-circuited
as long as
the power is off
if the power is on
you and the car will fry
how long will you be
a day maybe two
be careful
yeah
you too
shane
no no no
no no no
take those ear buds off
stay away from electronics
you will get electrocuted
if an em wave hits
im serious
it dangerous
get rid of it
ill see you soon
hey
i love you
everybody is advised
to stay tuned
to this emergency
broadcast channel
federal marshall law
has been declared
lindenville residents are
ordered to evacuate their homes
and take shelter
at lindenville parish
we repeat
why are they telling
everyone to go to the church
didnt dad say it was
dangerous to stay in town
oh what this
road closed
youre supposed to take
shelter in the parish
were going
to little brook
maam we have orders
to divert everyone
to the lindenville parish
that ridiculous
it not even safe there
maam please
just back it up okay
let go
come on
turn the car off
i think it gone
start the car
dammit
well have to go back
get out of the car now
come on jump
ahhh
no
ahh
i cant hold on
yes you can
dont let go
help
anybody help
grab it
come on
we need to evacuate everyone
from the mini pole sites
evacuate
we just started rounding
up people for the shelters
no no no
you cant do that
the plasma charges building up
from the pole reversal
are escaping through
the mini poles
this whole area is going
to get hit worse
and worse
as the field fails
alright
ill notify the soldiers
but communications
have been spotty
what about the president
have you still been
able to contact him
yeah the emergency
hotline is holding up
good
ive got a crazy idea
i need to access storm
hazard mainframe
follow me
storm hazards
pam talk to me
im briefing the president
in a few minutes
james the computer
projection
it not good
i need to see whoever
is in charge
inside this circle is
the most dangerous place
on the west coast
were here
the epicentre
of the mini pole
creating the electromagnetic
and seismic disturbances
we need to move all these
people outside
of this circle to here
where did you get
this information
my husband
dr james mayfield
he a government
astrophysicist
he briefing the president
right now
i havent heard
anything about this
my orders are
to keep everybody here
i know but im telling
you it not safe here
lindenville has become
the magnetic centre
of a mini pole
what is that
a mini pole
no no no
turn the power off
the electricity will
attract the next em pulse
you have to shut
the generator down
shut it down
i dont think so
youre not
listening to me
were in danger here
maam federal marshall law
has been declared
i cant just move hundreds
of people
because you show me some
map with a circle drawn on it
you know what
call general mayfield
hell vouch for everything
ive just said
storm hazard lab
just ran this projection
this is what the magnetic
field normally looks like
this is what it looks like now
punctured by mini poles
this is 2 hours out
24 hours out
48 hours out
magnetic field
at zero gauss
gentlemen
we have two days
before our planet loses
its protective shield
and solar radiation burns
us all to a crisp
anyone here take issue
with dr mayfield projections
no sir
no sir
alright then
so who here has a game plan
to stop this pole reversal
alright
this is the way i see it
what if we detonate a nuclear
explosion of a magnitude
equal to that of which the comet
fragment hit earth
in the opposing hemisphere
so that it pushes back
with equal force
are you crazy
how do we know it wouldnt
make things worse
what about fallout
fallout
the pole reversal
completes in 48 hours
and then
it is bye-bye planet
does anybody else
have a better idea
that what i thought
that comet fragment hit us with
the force of 00 megaton bomb
we dont have
a warhead that powerful
what the most powerful
nuke in the us arsenal
we have a new
50 megaton prototype
that at the nuclear
test site
okay well can formulate
a dual detonation
that will equal 00
and
we cant get through
to the general
communication is down
well we cant just leave
these people here
this place is a
ticking time bomb
i suggest you find
a cot and you chill
anything
nothing yet sir
zoe
hey
when did you get here
just a few minutes ago
excuse me everybody
can i have your
attention please
im cynthia mayfield science
teacher at lindenville high
many of you know that
my husband dr james mayfield
is a respected astrophysicist
he told me that our town
is the epicentre
of the electromagnetic and
seismic disturbances happening
on the west coast
and that it very dangerous
to stay here
we need to move
outside the circle
the nearest safe
town is little brook
you wanna step down
from there maam
how come the soldiers
dont know this
because their
communications are down
theyre completely
in the dark
im not going to ask
you again maam
please listen to me
we could all die here
get her off of there
is it true
if you open your mouth
about this to anyone again
you will be arrested
is that clear
yes
and i dont want
to see that map again
release her
james youll be happy to know
the bomber is on its way
and two 50 megaton warheads
will launch at 600
yes
what do you mean
we lost the plane
yes
thank you
an em pulse took
out the bomber
the warheads
exploded in mid air
they have to try again
send another plane
james the skies
are unflyable
well lose them all
they have to try
send 20 planes
one might get through
james
james youve got to think
of something else fast
there got to
be another way
weve got
to get out of here
why would the soldiers
keep us here if it isnt safe
because they
dont anything
theyre just following
their last orders
communications have
gotten so bad
they cant even contact
their superiors
what do you want to do
dr mayfield was right
when he said
the comet might hit earth
i think we should go
were in
come on
it around here
this one
those poor people
i feel so bad
leaving them
you did everything
you could cyn
gentlemen i have a new plan
that just might work
were going to detonate at
the bottom of the ocean
the marianna trench the deepest
point of the earth crust
dr elman
yes the ocean crust is thin
enough that the blast
could go right through
to lithosphere and yes
it could conceivably push
the planet back into alignment
the marianna trench is over
36000 feet deep doctor
how do you plan
on getting there
submarine
unfortunately doctor we dont
have any that are operational
what do you mean you dont
have any that are operational
em interference crippled
the onboard computers
that control
the nuclear reactors
are you telling me there
not a single sub out there
that right
that not exactly true
general
the russians have an old diesel
sub they still train on
she isnt pretty
but she running
she on the west coast for an international training exercise
open that bunker
i guess theyre still ordering
everyone to the church
shhh
i can hear it
hear what
an em pulse tone
what an em pulse tone
electromagnetic shockwave
it a burst of
electromagnetic energy
coming from the mini pole
that sub should be in
the harbour by now
what is that noise
a pulse tone
cut the engine dad
now
stop the car right now
what was that
there it is
oh my god
turn the car off michael
turn it off
everything electronic has
to be turned off
cell phones mp3 players
everything
get rid of your
watch michael
i hope those guys remember
to cut their engine
cut your engine
cut your engine
cut your engine
i think it passed
michael what wrong
dad are you okay
can you drive
sure
james check the engine
weve got no time
to waste
the battery and
starter are fried
it looks like were an hour
from getting out of the circle
we need to get my
father to a hospital
what wrong
he has a pacemaker
i think the storm
shorted it out
oh god
how are we doing
good
give it a try
it is an honour
general mayfield
captain yolenkov
this is dr james mayfield
captain
i see the resemblance
there are two warheads in
the back of that truck
so we work together
to save world no
yes
dr mayfield will formulate
the detonation sequence
my ship she strong as ox
but not so fast you know
yes we know
the closest town
is clarksville
we past it a
few minutes ago
maybe they have
a hospital
no
dont go back
im okay
just get out
of the circle
oh no
not again
weve gotta get
out of here fast
get out or
ill blow your head off
okay
get out or ill
kill all of you
please my father is
having a heart attack
we need to get him
to a hospital
get out or ill put
him out of his misery
take it easy
were going
get out
ahhh
ugh
dad
what are conditions
in mariana trench
expect seismic activity
like nothing youve ever seen
you should warn your crew
that the steam vents
will be heating up the ocean
causing violent current shifts
all this from rock
hitting earth
technically the comet fragment
was made from ice
but yes
so tell me dr mayfield
you plan to detonate these
bombs at one time
no not exactly
in order to generate 00
megaton explosion
i need to formulate
a detonation sequence
just milliseconds apart
you know that this vessel
cannot outrun such a shockwave
we know
your crew captain
do they know
they have volunteered for
this mission in order
to save their families
outrunning the shockwave
is the least of our worries
it fried shane
you know you cant start a car without the battery
cars in the old days
didnt have batteries
they used to be started
by hand cranks
yeah well we dont have
a hand crank
and this is a modern car
you dont need a battery
to drive either
all we need to do is
capture an electrical charge
that will help ignite
the spark plugs
and where are we going
to get that from
have you ever seen
anything like this
no one has
were witnessing a geological
event that hasnt happened
on a scale
in millions of years
what creates such hell
massive tectonic movements
how will this
affect the mission
well it makes it
nearly impossible
ahhh
ahhh
ahhh
dad
dad
im okay
we have lost one engine
power will be
50 percent
hi
can shane really do what
he says he doing
all i know is shane loves
working with cars
he the biggest greaser
at our school
better hurry up
with that shane
00 meters from bottom
almost in position
dammit
we cannot stay at
this depth very long
do you have
a family captain
of course
that why were going to stay
here as long as it takes
if we die from a crushed
hull or a shockwave
what difference does it make
if we fail
the whole world dies
this is it
were on
okay ive got to set the timer
on the warheads
here it comes
just about done
i dont think i should
be holding this anymore
almost there
shane
done
antenna
tape
come on
we need to move
away shane
shane come on
let go
i feel happy dying knowing it
was to save family on surface
but i am sad that you
must die with your son
until a few days ago
i hadnt seen james
in five years so
were on
it done captain
fire when ready
it will be impossible to
outrun the shockwave
with one engine but at
least well die trying
i think it done
we just have to pray
that one static charge
has been trapped
in the cylinder
come on baby
yeah
youre a genius
weve got the greatest
show on earth here dad
it a scientist dream
isnt it
captain
if you could take us
in to that volcano
a steam funnel might propel us up out of the shockwave path
the hull is not designed
for such temperatures
but what have we got
to lose
our temperature is rising
the heat is
expanding the metal
brace yourselves
ahhh
ahhh
thanks to unprecedented
cooperation between nations
we have survived
the most catastrophic event
to ever threaten our existence
the earth has been healed
the human spirit
has triumphed
despite all that has
been lost
but we will honour
those lost
with our resolve
to rebuild
and we will rejoice in what
we have been given
a chance for a
new beginning
000 am perfect time
and finally our fragile
planet owes a huge debt
to dr james mayfield
he here
dad
this is your grandfather
