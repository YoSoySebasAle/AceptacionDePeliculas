holy
what
that a lot of money
you said he lived alone
here for how many years
people get a little eccentric
start by putting some aside
little by little
and before you know it
he doesnt have any family
itll end up in a police locker somewhere
governmentll take it
why should we let it get caught up
in the system like that
when it could actually do some real good
i mean you said yourself how much
he cared about you he wanted to help
he did
well there you have it
a way for him to help you
help us
we would have to be careful
yeah we will
adam
yeah
promise me
i promise
so how long did you work
for mr wellsley
about four and a half months
and you lived here too
leonard stayed here alone at night
that how he wanted it
he could still get around okay
when was the last time you saw him
yesterday afternoon
we left a little early
to go to the bank around
around 430
and you worked here too mr kettner
just a couple weeks
i was doing some yard work for leonard
were married
i kind of got that
yeah
so how was mr wellsley doing
was he having any health issues recently

but he wouldnt have complained about it
anyway
he wasnt like that
well im gonna need to get some
contact information next of kin
he doesnt have any family
no
no
im sorry for your loss
if you have any questions
just give me a call
leonard once told me
he wanted to be cremated
he wanted his ashes spread in the garden
let me get back to you
okay
thank you
where are you going
i have to talk to mr calvern
to get my name back on the list
what list
at the agency
for another position
why
because that what i should do
now that i dont have a job
if you dont hear back
about that job soon
maybe you should start looking again too
all right i will
ill see you later
okay
katie i am so sorry
the two of you were so close
i cant imagine what a shock it was
if there anything i can do
i would like to get another
assignment as soon as possible
oh okay well let talk in my office
okay
unknown
hello
speaking
oh hi yeah
i agree i thought
the interview went very
i see
yeah no i completely understand
thank you for calling
yeah you too
katie i assumed you knew
i cant put you back to work
not until the police finish
their investigation
investigation
well yes when a client expires
under the supervision of an employee
we cooperate with the authorities
to be absolutely certain that there was
you know how would it look
to a potential client
that there was even any hint of
wait you think i had something
to do with what happened to leonard
god no no of course not
no this is
im sorry katie this is company policy
there nothing i can do until the police
officially close their investigation
so how long is this gonna take
yeah i
i wish i knew
hello
hey
what were you thinking
you cant just come in here like this
like we still belong here
excuse me im bleeding right now
what do you want from me
we said wed be careful adam
i asked you and you promised me
you promised
all right okay
look i
im sorry
but if i wasnt here
i think that money would be gone
how could anyone know about the money
it leonard he kept it hidden
why else would they be here katie
you didnt see who it was
no they came up behind me
they couldnt have known you were here
they wouldnt have busted in like that
i heard the glass break
that why i came down
the back door was already open
and you didnt think
maybe that was a bad sign
that you should get out
no i didnt have time to think
the next thing i know i was waking up
to the sound of my phone ringing
how could you do this adam
this never should have happened
you never should have been here
that not the point
then what the point
almost a hundred grand that the point
youre always trying to justify your
you counted it
i counted to 92000 and there was more
then she calls me to say how sorry she is
that the hiring committee
decided to go another way
whatever the hell that means
i dont even know
theyre all just such assholes
im just sick of being poor
who was it adam
who got in here
maybe somebody
who did some work on the house
sometime before you started
leonard talked about hiring a gardener
but that was a couple of years ago
well whoever it was
i dont think it was a coincidence
they must have known
that leonard had passed away
and figured the house would be empty
yeah
but maybe youre right
maybe they didnt know about the money
they probably just wanted
to get in and get out
just grab whatever they can get away with
what if they come back
all right right this way
there you go
just ring when youre ready
thank you
babe
dinner on me
all right
temptation got me
i cannot resist that feeling
you make me want it
feels like all i ever needed
temptation got me
i cannot resist that feeling
you make me want it
feels like all i ever needed
morning
morning
i was just making you coffee
ms franklin this is detective chesler
we spoke at mr wellsley house
would you give me a call
when you get this message
you have the number thanks
sorry to keep you waiting
thanks for coming in
detective is there a problem
why dont we talk back here
did mr wellsley ever mention a will
no
and no family
he was all alone
well something like this
the rich old man living alone no heirs
we just have to cross all of our t
im sorry detective
i dont
what is this about
well you said that
mr wellsley asked to be cremated
so im assuming that you
want to honor his request
yes
yes we do
without a family and no will
the question becomes who bears
the cost of the arrangements
well take care of leonard
okay ive got the paperwork right here
what that
his favorite tea
thanks
for leonard
leonard
we should put the money back
it doesnt feel right
let just be here
for leonard
we should say something
and he shall be like a tree
planted by the rivers of water
that bringeth forth
his fruit in his season
and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
im sorry who are you
apologies ms franklin
my name is julia byron-kim
im mr wellsley attorney
ms byron-kim
leonard never said anything
about an attorney
please call me julia
and im not surprised
what do you mean
the first i heard from mr wellsley
was only a few weeks ago
he called me out of the blue
wanting me to write up his will
and asked me to come to the house
i never saw you here
he was very specific about that
i was to only come in the evenings
why
he left everything to you
oh my god
congratulations
oh my god
i dont even know what to say this is
say thank you leonard
wow
okay so what happens now
first i suggest you read
over the will very carefully
better yet i would have
your lawyer take a look
actually we dont have a lawyer
well mr wellsley did pay my retainer
in advance
asked that i help you
through this transition
what transition
we cant just move in right away
of course you can
with the understanding
that the will is going through probate
which takes about three months
and if there are any surprises
you should have someone
to look after your interests
now i understand if you
want to find your own lawyer
you said leonard called you
out of the blue
you didnt know him
i never met him before
why did he call you
he found me on the internet
he said that he liked my name
byron was his favorite poet
ms byron-kim
sorry julia
im kind of new at this
im not really sure
how to go about it officially
but i could really use your help
there are some big changes
coming your way
i hope youre ready
me too
and how about adam
what about him
well he does understand that legally
where it comes to this house
you make all the decisions
weve always decided things together
which is how it should be
these things you just never know
how it can change someone
well be okay
good
leave it to me then
great
congratulations
thanks
we should take a vacation for a month
just first class all the way
youll get your mba before you know it
find a great job
that piece of junk that we drive
we can pay off everything
credit cards loans
just wipe the slate clean
you know we should go right now
both of us just go pick brand new cars
come on adam im serious
yeah me too
we cant do that
why not we have the money
we cant just walk in there
with all that cash itll look weird
people are gonna ask questions
yeah no youre right
i did some research online
and been looking into that
into what
see there ways we can make it work
right we just spread the money around
different banks
different kinds of accounts
what are you talking about
if we do this right
it like nobody will ever know
we can get away with so much in taxes
adam
we still have to be careful
we have been careful okay
dont you think it time for us
to treat ourselves
you earned it
god knows i have
i mean maybe youre right
but we have to settle in first
take things slow you know just
just a little while longer okay
yeah
okay
well take it slow
ill call the movers see how soon
we can get them over here
what we dont need any of this stuff
what it our stuff
weve had it since we got married
yeah well here well keep the pictures
and some of those books
and we dont need the rest of this junk
what are we supposed to do with all of it
just leave it for the next poor losers
that have to live in this dump right
jeez adam
hello
yeah that was five months ago and
i already gave the police my statement
who was it who called you sir
i didnt get the name he just said
talk to someone at the front desk
i got nothing
mrkettner everything okay
he says somebody told him
to come down make a statement
what this regarding
like five months ago somebody robbed
the smile diner killed somebody
you were at the diner that night
yes
lucky you didnt get hurt
i kinda stopped the guy
you did
yeah in that situation i reacted
my wife was working that night so
ms franklin was there too
yeah but what i dont understand
is you already have the guy locked up
why do they need another statement
they dont
what are you talking about
that guy from the diner ray gaskin
yeah
he dead
somebody stabbed him
in his cell a couple weeks ago
so who called me
kind of wondering that myself
excuse me
hello katie do you remember me
yeah what are you doing back here
i know a pain in the ass right
but my client he driving me nuts
he just he absolutely loves the place
i think he wants to make an offer
i told you already
it not for sale
maybe if i could speak
with the owner myself
at least i can say i tried
look im really busy and you cant
just show up here like this so
i want you to go now please
you know katie
this aint my first rodeo
you know one of the first lessons
in real estate
if you want to find new listings
check the obituaries
yes
i know all about the late mr wellsley
sad
the house isnt for sale
you know ive had my eye
on this house for a couple years
the old man
kicks the bucket
and you think you can just move in
im gonna smile
wish you well
i own the house now
what the hell are you saying
leonard left it to me
i have his will i can prove it
yeah well for five grand
i can make a new will that says
it belongs to my dear aunt myrtle
i have a lawyer
of course you do
if you have any more questions
i suggest you talk to her
but in the meantime get the hell off
my property before i call the police
all right well i guess
ill see you around katie
he just messing with you
it not how it sounded
he practically accused me
of forging the will
babe trust me
the thing this guy cares about
is what he losing on commission
maybe i should talk to julia
the lawyer
why
in case hayden tries to make trouble
what could he do
i dont know but it like she said
we dont want any surprises right now
katie
this guy is just pissed off
forget about him
come on
it our first night in our new house
we should celebrate

funny you forgot to mention it
what
the will and all when we spoke
i asked you about his family
about a will
oh no i didnt know about it until
after the service his lawyer came by
that mustve been quite a shock
yeah it was
id have loved to see
the look on your face
you know i mean you worked there for
what did you say four months
why are you here detective
i was hoping to speak with your husband
he not here
well maybe you can help me
see i was wondering
when you worked nights at that place
the smile diner
did he pick you up all the time
i mean he picked you up before
yeah
right but was it a set thing
was it every night was it certain nights
no not exactly
so how did he happen
to be there that night
i i called him to pick me up
and he came early to study
well you ought to play the lottery
katie
youre a very lucky woman
does this have anything
to do with the fact that
the police called adam
about making another statement
he didnt tell you
police never called adam
no i was here
they called him down at the station
no i checked it out after he left
there no record
of any calls to his number
that doesnt make any sense
why would why would anyone
send him down there for no reason
well maybe they had a reason
maybe it just not the one you think
take care now
thanks julia
ill talk to you later bye
katie
what did she want
i called her actually
what did you tell her
nothing
that not how it looked
looked like you guys were best friends
all of a sudden
well maybe if youd been here
maybe if youd answered your phone
we agreed
we decided you were not going
to talk to her
no you decided
like youve been deciding
a lot of things lately
what are you even talking about
why didnt you tell me
that it wasnt the police who called you
it was somebody else who made
sure you went down there right
who told you that
detective chesler dropped by
and she was asking a lot of questions
about you
about what happened
the night of the diner
what is that about
adam
how should i know
who called
who sent you to the police station
i dont know
my bad i was gonna tell you about it
it a whole lot of other stuff
has been happening right now
what other stuff
i think im being followed
what
i kind of had the feeling before
today i just went driving
around just around
i kept seeing the same car
did you go to the bank
come on we said we would not do that
no adam no bullshit
just tell me
did you go to the bank today
did you take money out
i noticed him
so i figured you know
it wouldnt be a good idea just in case
in case he was after the money
we dont know that
why else is he watching you
look maybe im just paranoid
okay maybe there nobody
who following me i dont know
you got sent down
to the police station adam
that way im here alone
that way hayden shows up
tries to intimidate me
scare us out of the house what is that
why is he here
because he probably knows
i warned you
chesler
hey tom
you did
great
great okay hold on
all right so probably just
from the last four five months
were looking for any checks drawn
on an account from a leonard wellsley
yeah made out to her name
yeah
it kate franklin
listen can you see
what you got on the husband too
it a different last name
it an adam kettner with a k
great get back to me
as soon as you can thanks
what are you looking for
leonard didnt just stash that money
it had to come from somewhere
there has to be a reason
does that even matter now
julia said
if they find out
weve been hiding something illegal
we could lose everything
all right
so what do you suggest
we just give it all back
i dont know
yeah maybe
to whom katie
i dont know
but this never felt right
im not going back to the way
things were before
adam
we may not have a choice
we always have a choice
i had absolutely no idea
that mr wellsley left katie the house
that seems a little
excessive
doesnt it though
yeah
what can you tell me about her husband
ive never met the man
so you had nothing to do with hiring him
as a gardener at the house
no it strictly against our policy
for family members to work together
our patients are elderly infirm
we cant risk that kind
of potential distraction
so do you know of ms franklin
ever breaking the rules before
never no
no she absolutely understood
the importance of her job especially
with mr wellsley
why especially him
well you wouldnt have known it to look
at him but his health was very delicate
you know katie told me
she kept a notebook
like a daily log
just to keep track of his medication
do you happen to have
a record of his medications
youd have to speak
with his doctor about that
right how about ms franklin contract
how much she was being paid
yeah sure we can get that to you
yeah
excellent thank you and let me
just ask you did she
did she ever mention a raise
good lord
she deposited that check
just before wellsley died
was she really taking money
from that poor old man all along
it a good question
adam
adam
shit
ethan
these were never cashed
you okay
i think i know who that is
what
leonard said something
about hiring a gardener
i think i told you about this
a guy named ethan
this was a couple years ago
so he been up there for a while
there were checks made out to ethan doyle
they were never cashed
leonard said one day
he just stopped showing up
never heard from him again
somebody shot him
you looked
he must have bled to death up there
he was murdered
yeah i think so
but
leonard couldnt have known he was there
right i mean he would have helped him
and why would doyle hide out in the shed
why not come into the house
maybe these have something to do with it
take a guess
wow
do you think theyre real
why else would he hide them
shit
here just
oh god
oh my god
give them here come on
im sorry
dammit
dont answer
i saw your car
but i cant my car is parked outside
they know im here
okay im just gonna
i got it
open the door
do you hear me katie
katie open the door please
im sorry this really isnt a good time
well yeah im sure youre very busy
settling into your new home
you should be ashamed of yourself
how could you take advantage
of that poor man
what
look i knew something was up
i could feel it
but you know what you had him
so frightened he couldnt even tell me
it not no
im not letting you
tarnish my company good name
mr calvern
ill find proof
im gonna call the police
im gonna have you arrested
this really isnt a good time
this isnt over katie
ill be back
im gonna find out what been going on
in this house one way or another
im not letting this go you hear me
im not gonna lose my business over this
why isnt this full
katie
hey katie
hey
didnt you hear me
hi sorry i was making tea
you want some
no i got you a present
a new phone
yeah got one for each of us
new numbers too i figured
the way things were going
we could both use a little privacy
we cant keep them
katie
adam no
there is a dead man out there
he was murdered
he stole those diamonds
and who knows what else
he may have done who he may have hurt
these things dont just go away
like they never happened
the police must be looking for him
dont you get this
doyle stole the diamonds
got himself shot
and then he died out there all by himself
it like it like he fell down a well
two years later
nobody knows what happened to him or
the diamonds we can do whatever we want
what are you doing
im calling detective chesler
we need to tell her
no wait
wait just okay hang on
just listen to me for just a second
okay ask yourself what the heck
was doyle doing here in the first place
why take some crappy gardening job
if he planning to steal a fortune
in diamonds
i dont know
some old guy house digging up weeds
is the last place
that anybody gonna come looking for him
i mean think about it
why else wouldnt he cash the checks
he didnt want to leave a paper trail
that way he sets up the big score
nobody knows about this place
and he can just hide here
for as long as he needs to
although im sure
that getting shot and dying out there
was probably not a part of the plan
that doesnt change anything
we cant keep those diamonds
all right so what about the money
what are we gonna do about that
what do you mean
if we do this
then the police put us under a microscope
so how is that going to look
we took the money from here
and then we hid it in the bank
what are they gonna think
well explain it to them
tell them it was leonard money
that it was his safety net
all right and then what
cause you heard what the lawyer said
even if they believe us
even if we dont end up in jail
we could still lose this place
we dont need this house adam
we dont need any of this
okay as long as we have each other
were going to be all right
all right
im done with all right
that not enough anymore
i told you im not going back
to the way things were before
and what about that man out there
what are we supposed to do about that
pretend it never happened
ill take care of it
how how are you gonna do that
this house
belongs to us now
okay this is our future
im not gonna let anybody
take that away from us
look everything is gonna be okay
ill take care of this for you
what are you doing
someone in the house
where did you get that
adam
dont
dont move
we need to call 9
freeze asshole
oh my god
calvern
where the girl
how are you holding up katie
detective chesler
hell of a thing
it was an accident
yeah that what theyre saying
either way
law says it self-defense so
it still makes you wonder
what was going through his head
why would he do something like that
just let himself into the house
i dont know
something had to set him off
i know none of this is you katie
what
everything was fine around here
until adam started work
so you can tell me whatever is going on
i know that none of it is you
i dont know what youre talking about
i know about your money problems
i know what that does to people
i know about the big check
that you deposited from mr wellsley
you dont understand
okay dont say anything katie just
just listen for a second
because
could be that
it was a loan
maybe it was a gift who to say
but i want you
to put yourself in my shoes
the big picture
how all of a sudden
everything just drops in your lap
i told you
i mean here i am
the coroner tells me
that the old guy died in his sleep
you tell me what his last wish was
and i figure sure why not
but it is not until after he cremated
that you find a will
i didnt find it
i didnt even know about it
and i dont even have a body
i cant even prove
that he didnt die a natural death
i mean i gotta tell you
it starting to keep me up at night
i would never hurt leonard
i am not talking about you
what
has adam ever mentioned anyone
by the name of gaskin a ray gaskin
i know that name
cause he tried to rob
the diner that night
and he also worked as a janitor
at the university
while adam was taking classes
no that not no
okay
it a big school maybe they never met
but sooner or later
adam is going to screw up
it only a matter of time
dont let him take you down with him
you come to me
baby
they wanna talk to you
hell of a thing
katie
hey
i heard what happened are you all right
ive been trying to call you
my number been changed
i need to talk to you
yeah come upstairs
okay
and this detective chesler
do you believe her
is it possible that
adam had anything to do
with what happened
at the diner that night
i dont know what to believe
did adam have any problems
with mr wellsley
any issues
no
no nothing
if the police suspect that adam
had anything to do with his death
theyll try to find a motive
theyre gonna try to claim
that he hurried things along
he hated being poor
okay listen to me
if chesler thinks she can make a case
she not gonna waste any time
she gonna try to get a warrant
and search the house right away
can she do that
you need to be asking yourself
will she find anything
you need to promise me
promise me
that youll help adam too
it gone
what
the money
adam must have taken it
that what you found cash
yeah
almost $00000
in the attic
we thought it was stolen at first but
and then what changed your mind
the diamonds
so you found diamonds in the house
in the living space above the garage
does adam have these diamonds
yeah
you need to stop him
what why
he knows you suspect something
that why he took the money
he disappears and throws you to the cops
no adam would never do that
are you sure
you need to find him bring him
to the house and then call me
youre not coming with me
i need to hold off detective chesler
i dont want her serving
the search warrant
till we know adam in the house
detective chesler
detective johnson
what have we got
garbage truck was making its rounds
this morning called it in
how long he been in there
me still en route
you beat him here
damn
why did you call me
there was a backpack next to the vic
inside we found an old laundry receipt
it pretty faded but
the address matches the name
from one of your cases
what the name
leonard wellsley
come on adam pick up
whereve you been
adam
im up half the night talking to the cops
i wake up in the morning
youre already gone
there no note
you havent answered your phone all day
whereve you been katie
the bank
that one of the things
i need to talk to you about
why did you take the money
cause were in a lot of trouble
checked up on that real estate agent
hayden
i mean what this guy deal
why he so interested
in selling this particular house
guess what
there no record of a mickey hayden
getting a real estate license
what
yeah he just got released from prison
did a couple years
for robbing a jewelry store
jewelry
one of those spots downtown
doesnt even use a gun
he just sweet talks his way
through the security door
then he blindsides the armed guard
does some old school
like smash-and-grab
sixty seconds
comes out with three million dollars
in loose diamonds
that were never recovered
that why he was here
hang on it gets better
cops think that he had an accomplice
that they never found
you wanna take a wild guess
this other guy gets shot during
the burglary then he gets away
doyle got away with the diamonds
and
there only one other person
who couldve known about it
the one who shot him
hayden
this bastard didnt bother
to use a fake name what did he think
we werent smart enough to figure it out
we have to call the police
no the only thing that we need to do
is get the hell out of dodge
we got plenty of travel money so
сan you go pack some stuff up real fast
im gonna go get cleaned up
you were never gonna leave me
what no why would i ever leave you
get changed
hi julia
it katie
yeah he here but
listen it wasnt him
where are they
i dont know
call him out here
adam
adam
adam
right here baby
let her go
look i just want the diamonds
i said let her go
ive been waiting a long time for this
so how about
you just tell me where they are
some place youre never gonna find them
are you gonna shoot me kid
that right
cause if i just give you the diamonds
youll shoot both of us
here the thing though
even if you hit me from there
my gun gonna go off and it gonna
blow a hole in her the size of your head
and we dont want that now do we
so let just talk about this
adam
son of a bitch
adam
no
adam
baby
adam
baby
please
adam
in the garden
stay with me baby
katie
oh my god
here katie
im sorry
here sit
hey
katie listen
we need to look for the diamonds
before the police get here
do you understand
it the only way we can explain
what happened without implicating you
adam never would have hurt leonard
katie the diamonds
how could i have ever thought that
it was hayden
hayden
killed him with an overdose
he read the logbook the one
i kept for leonard medication
i found the empty pill bottle
how do you know it was hayden
leonard used to tell me all the time
that he could hear someone in the house
but i never i
it was hayden
looking for the diamonds
he couldnt find them
but you did
i dont understand
why did hayden shoot doyle
why didnt
why didnt he end up with the diamonds
because he wasnt half as smart
as he wanted you to think
i mean how smart do you have to be
to decide to rip off your partner
shoot him while the cops are rolling up
and he still gets away
with three million dollars in diamonds
meanwhile you get busted
and spend two years in prison
i never told you how much
the diamonds are worth
oops
what are you doing
look okay i paid my dues
okay i spent ten years
as a public defender
how do you think i got hayden case
i knew he was an idiot
but i believed his story
and we had an agreement an understanding
and of course he messes everything up
i plea bargained his charges
down to two years
i traced doyle back to
when he worked for leonard
but the only thing
that i couldnt figure out
was where he was
turns out doyle was dead
you helped kill leonard
no i had nothing to do with that okay
that was all hayden he got impatient
he wanted to hurry things along
but i did have to do some fast maneuvering
to cover up for him
the will
it isnt real is it
it real enough
with no one to contest it
what the difference
look im sure leonard wouldve given you
the house if he was alive
but that is beside the point
right now i need you to tell me
where the diamonds are
i dont know
katie
adam hid them
i really dont know where they are
but i wouldnt tell you if i did
you know
that what i really liked about you
it was never about the money
but im sure theyll turn up
these things always do
katie
detective
