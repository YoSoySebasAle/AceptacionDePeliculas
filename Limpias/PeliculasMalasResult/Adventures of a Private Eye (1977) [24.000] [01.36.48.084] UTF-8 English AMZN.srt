crime is on the increase
certainly too much for
the police to handle
that where people like us come in
oh im bob west by the way
private detective
excuse me can you tell me
where flash street is please
yeah you go through
the first set of traffic lights
to the second set and then you turn left
thanks mate
all right
you see the trouble with most people
today is theyre not observant
they walk around with their eyes closed
and that just what
the criminal type looking for
this is where i work
if ever there was a glamorous job
this has got to be it
fast cars private yachts
flying off to assignments
in exotic places fantastic
not that i do any of that but the bloke
i work for he does it all the time
and of course need i say it women
you know i have never known a fellow
cram so many beautiful women into one day
my boss goes through secretaries
like a chain-smoker
this one only started this morning
amateur peering through keyholes
is for the amateur
i wasnt actually mr blake
i just thought id dropped
something on the floor
bugging now that the professional way
bugging
yes and like everything else
purely a matter of technique
now you stick with me and youll soon
learn to be a successful bugger
hurry up miss walker
i want to be out of here in five minutes
case robert case
you mean you want me to handle one
while youre away mr blake
no i want you to hand me one now

leaving you in charge
of this office while im away
ill handle things while youre away
mr blake dont worry about that
watch it that just it
i dont want you to handle things
just keep an eye on the place
that will be quite sufficient
well
is there nothing i can do
while youre away
i mean finish off a case or something
to work on even the simplest of cases
requires a vast reservoir of experience
ive been here three months
im talking of years robert years
you havent even asked me
to follow anybody yet
i shall be gone for about four days
any problems you know where to
contact me hotel majestic beirut
by the way ive arranged for a temporary
secretary to deputise for miss walker
she should have been here
first thing this morning but she late
right miss walker
dont worry about a thing mr blake
ill make sure
everything running smoothly for you
look just take the messages that all
dont start messing in things
which dont concern you
no i wouldnt dream of it
come on

oh i can just see her now
soft blonde hair
lovely slender little body
deep sensitive eyes
gubbidge maud gubbidge
im the new secretary from rent-a-temp
rent-a-what
there must be a mistake i mean
this is the blake detective agency
isnt it
i was told to report to a mr west
is that you
well yeah but i was expecting
somebody a bit
older
well
now the last boss i had
he kept making improper suggestions to me
i hope youre not going to be like that
like what
keep making improper suggestions
oh no way
good as long as the only thing i have
to take down is shorthand i dont mind
you see it was my body
that was the trouble
yeah i can see that
he couldnt keep his hands off it
really
it got so bad it was just unbearable
so i had to hand in my notice
he said i aroused his primeval impulse
i seem to have that effect on men
you know
well if you wouldnt mind
answering the door please miss er
gubbidge maud gubbidge
yes what do you want
blake detective agency
thatll be all right miss garbage
gubbidge
yes yes if youd like to step this way
mr judd blake
well
laura sutton
how do you do
mr blake
ill come straight to the point
i want you to handle a case
for me immediately
oh yes but im not
no no no ill explain
you see i used to be
a professional model
and to be quite honest
i led a rather wild life
that is until i met ashley
ashley dotrice
then it was love at first sight
the fact that he was 87
a multi-millionaire
with a bad heart condition
had nothing to do with it naturally
naturally
but you see the thing is im not
and last week
we were supposed to be married
but i thought it best
we didnt have a long engagement
i mean hed already had
three heart attacks since last christmas
last week he had a fourth and died
oh im very sorry
hmm oh yes of course
i was terribly upset
now the point is that im due to inherit
his entire estate on the 25th
that very nice but the thing is
yes but you see the trouble is ashley
darling ashley you see he was under the
impression that i was still virgin
oh really
really
according to the terms of the will
i only inherit everything
if ive done nothing to bring
the family name into disrepute
so you see i have a problem
problem
well
i have a number of explicit photographs
of myself
with a gentleman in
a compromising situation
oh
i would like you to see them
oh yeah id love to yeah
i feel i should explain
well just pass them over
and let me have a look
you see they came through the post
yesterday morning
yes well
i think i should take a look and
they came with a note
threatening to send them
to ashley solicitor unless i pay 50000
yes well i can see
youve got a problem there
but if i could just have a look at them
mr blake im at my wits end
oh come on they cant be that bad
wow
exactly
needless to say
i dont have that kind of money
what
i said i dont have that kind of money
i cant touch any of the estate
until i inherit it on the 25th
and if i ask for some kind of a loan
then somebody might get suspicious
you know you photograph very well
thank you
what i want you to do is to catch
the blackmailer and get me the negatives
it incredible definition as well
you do see the position im in
youre in a very awkward position
i can see that
mr blake what do you think
oh i think theyre great
especially the one
with the stick of rock
yes well um
i think i should be able to fit you in
in between commitments
who do you reckon it is
if i knew who it was i wouldnt be here
employing you mr blake
yes quite
just testing you that all
well i think ill kick off by
following up a few leads
leads
yes you dont happen to have any do you
scott
who
the person on the picture
oh yes i hadnt noticed him
he a photographer
it could have been a set-up job but
yes well
you know i dont think
this is going to be
a particularly difficult
case to solve miss
sutton
just leave it with me for a few days
everything will be all right
oh dont worry
theyll be safely under lock and key
everything is kept strictly confidential
in this business
youre out of your head
how can you take on a job like this
amazing what you can do
with a garlic sausage
it an open-and-shut case
there absolutely nothing to it
anyway it a cucumber isnt it
nothing to it
you dont know the first thing
about being a private detective
it definitely a sausage
ive seen the way blake does it
it dead easy
it just plain common sense
nothing more
ill get these
it all right bob ill get them
anyway ive got ambition havent i
if i hadnt id probably still be stuck
in that boring old insurance office
might be all right for you
derek but me

i still say youre trying to run
before you can walk like you always do
that bicycle pump must have been painful

when it all over
all right sherlock

go to that flat in disguise

but it only the way
she done her make-up
yes all right what did she want
of course i dont need any of that

i foresaw a death in my tea leaves
someone is about to die i can sense it
what are you doing here
oh im sorry
there people popping up
and disappearing all over the place
you know i suspect there a secret panel
here somewhere
there are lots of them
you found out who it is yet
no im just searching for some clues
but dont worry as soon as
i find some ill know who it is
look um
i was thinking you know
later on tonight
i dont suppose you fancy a quick one
i mean if youre nervous about
sleeping alone
i dont mind
it all right i always lock my door
you always lock your door very wise
good night judd
if i were you id lock yours too
can i help you sir
what
oh
can i help you sir
that
that big bird it very interesting
the grimsdyke vulture sir
yeah yeah
who the fellow in the chain mail
marmaduke grimsdyke
we dont talk about him sir
i dont know why you made me come
all the way out here
why couldnt you come to the hotel
are you just going to stand there
or are you going to give it to me
hello there
hello percy been a good boy then
what happened
it was an accident
i fell on top of him he out cold
have you got any smelling salts
who is it
oh it scott whatever he doing here
he not breathing
oh my god ive killed him
he been shot
it was an accident
i fell on top of him i
he been what
look
look the thing to do is
to keep perfectly calm and not panic
so dont panic dont panic
let go and get the police
ill phone the police
and then well go and get the police
no no no no wait
will you wait
what
obviously it isnt an accident
you mean he been murdered
yes
oh my god listen
what do you phone for the police
christ it on the tip of my tongue
what is it
i mean
just wait will you just wait
you dont understand he been murdered
i know but if you stop rushing into
things and let me think clearly
think clearly yes that very good
think clearly
999 that what it is
i knew it was something
before you do anything
just sit down and let me think
look if he was shot outside
wed have heard it right
right
right
therefore he must have crawled there
or been placed there by somebody
for what possible reason
dont you see
no
to incriminate me
that exactly the kind of scandal
that everybody was waiting for
well have to hide him
what
will you shut up
if we can just delay him being found
for a few days
until the estate is mine
after that it doesnt matter
you cant do that
oh judd darling
that is the answer
what about the police
i mean you cant just go around
hiding dead bodies
you know there a law against
that sort of thing
nobody will ever know
there a quarry not far from here
he wouldnt be found for days
no im sorry laura
absolutely definitely emphatically no
but what were really doing is
helping the police
are we
well scott wasnt murdered here
he was murdered somewhere else
so by us moving the body we are stopping
the police from being confused
i dont think they will see it
quite like that somehow
especially if they find out
good evening craddock
good night madam
as soon as it light
you can get rid of it properly
what do you mean as soon as it light
well it going to look suspicious
if you try and get rid of it
in the middle of the night
oh judd you dont know
what this means to me
about
about 0 years i should think
if they find out
come on
morning sir
morning
i shouldnt think you can see much behind
with that on the back
well i saw you
it contrary to the motor vehicles
construction and use regulations
section 40 sub-paragraph 5
road traffic act 972
yeah well im sorry officer
i didnt realize
that i was contravening
where your spare wheel
well it in the back i suppose why
youre gonna need it
youve got a flat tire
right sir if youd care to get
out of the car ill give you a hand
it shouldnt take long
that all right officer
actually i can manage on my own
it going to be okay
in spite of what the public thinks
we do like to help sometimes
now youre gonna need a hand with this
otherwise youll never get the wheel out

to take the other end
ready one two three

i thought you might be
youve got that look about you
i knew youd be just game for anything

i see all the sex films you know
hot lust and sweaty thighs
nuns in rubber

not like the milkman
youd be amazed what he gets up to
with his extra pint of

and gestapo uniform
for a quick bit of the night porter
with the gasman

to get me hands washed

washing your hands
look i had to change the wheel didnt i
and then this woman came out
but that was after
the policeman pulled me up
well he didnt exactly pull me up
but he wanted to change the wheel
i had to help him otherwise it would
have looked suspicious wouldnt it
i had to and i did
and then this funny woman came out
with kinky black leather boots whip
the trunk where is it
oh no what are you two doing down here
why what have you done now
i dont believe it
i just do not believe it
even you couldnt be that stupid
all right ill admit there been
a slight error of judgment on my part
error do you realize
what youve got yourself into
following somebody about with binoculars
is one thing but murder
youve really landed
yourself in it this time
it no good you keep going on about it
i mean i didnt murder him did i
ill admit that things havent gone
quite as id liked them to
there no talking to him
i give up i just give up
oh im sure he was only trying to help
i told you not to take this case
in the first place
but you wouldnt listen to me
but ive solved it
i mean i know who murdered him
it just a question of proving it
that all
what do you mean
you know who murdered him
i do his accomplice
then why havent you told the police
well because im not quite sure
exactly who the accomplice is yet
but ive got some suspects
suspects
you wait until you see how strange
the butler been acting lately
what does that miss sutton
have to say about it
well she reckons the best thing to do now
is just to try and solve
the case as quickly as possible
listen that trunk has probably
been opened already
and if it has it will be no time at all
before it traced back to this place
so you go to the police before they come
to you and you tell them everything
i cant do that i promised laura
it the only chance youve got
of getting yourself out of this mess
short of pleading insanity on second
thought that probably your best chance
look if i tell the whole story
laura will inherit nothing
well so what
it better than being an accessory and
going to prison for the rest of your life
he right you know
is the plumber there
no no im sorry he hasnt been here
do send him round
yes ill tell him as soon as he comes
goodbye maam
the inspector please
oh yes youve come to the wrong place
he not here
pardon
no i just had his wife on the phone
wondered what happened to you
what happened to me
yes she expects you
really
yes youll find his house number 6
on the right the one with the red door
well what are you waiting for
the one with the red door
the one with the red door
thank goodness youre here
i was getting quite desperate
do come in
thank you
the kitchen at the back
i tried to do it myself
but it wasnt really very satisfactory
what i really needed was a nice long tool
to poke it with properly
if you see what i mean
i hunted about for hours
but i couldnt find anything satisfactory
finally i decided the only thing to do
is to get a man round instead
yes well actually ive come to
solve my little problem yes i know
i do hope youve got
the right equipment for it
it probably just tea leaves
oh no no
youve got it wrong im not
quite sure what it is
i do understand mr
west
you see well everyone thinks it blake
how strange blake doesnt sound
a bit like west
i suppose youll probably try
to suck it out with your little plunger
drink
say when
when
what
when
my goodness
you certainly like your drink dont you
i like a man who not afraid to admit it
listen when i came round
i thought your husband
was going to be here
oh he wont be home for ages yet
why dont you come and sit down
cheers
cheers
is it getting hard
pardon
finding work
oh yeah well
look are you sure about your husband
positive
he is the inspector
yes
and he a very difficult man
to live with i can tell you
oh really
i dont want you to get the wrong idea
but i get the kind of feeling that youre
the sort of man i could really depend on
but
what about the husband
oh he wont be back for ages yet
plenty of time
mummy
