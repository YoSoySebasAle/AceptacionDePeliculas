the interior of the crypt
is three meters
by three by 25 in height
it doesnt appear that
it been entered
it beautiful
it at least 900 years old
the detail is amazing
it is the story of creation
it is the story
of the birth of evil on earth
oh god larabe
it is the crypt
this is where the sanzia
have entombed the devil child
oh man
what a screw up
now well have some fun
is anybody here
who are you
are you crazy
what are you doing
you must stop this
everybody will be killed
if you do not stop this
what are you talking
about who are you
you brought their evil back
with your picks
and your shovels
close the tomb now and leave
the sanzias are dead
all of them are dead
he opened up the gate to hell
and the killings began
there will be others
the soul of the
sanzia child is alive
it has returned
all of the children
are in danger
close the tomb now
and maybe god will spare us
wait
wait
wait
wait for me
what was that about
superstition
there frequent opposition
to dredging up the past
a past descendants
of the sanzias
would prefer we left in secrecy
im looking for my son
he snuck out of the house
i thought he might
be here with you
jimmy my assistant
the explorer
no i havent seen him ha yet
what going on here

luis
luis
luis
luis
hello
it an emergency
we need an ambulance
at camino el rey
looks like it was
a heart attack
under the circumstances
with luis
im not going to punish you
but what you did was
totally irresponsible
just what did you think you
were gonna do out there
i dont know
mr resnick mentioned
that old tribe
and i read all about them
how they were like
really weird dudes
they tried to make like
an evil kid or something
you know a devil
child they called it
sanzias were into
really scary stuff
it just got me going i guess
what did you say the
name of that tribe was
sanzia
from now on you
can forget about
some of the more exotic
goings-on around here
such as mr resnick and
the archeological digs
what
dad come on
the digs are a cool place
what does that have
to do with anything
it has to do with your ability
to separate what
real and what not
what are you doing
i thought that youd
be more comfortable
if dolly slept over
there in the chair
dont touch her
jessica im taking the doll
out of the bed
and i dont want hear
another word about it
ill kill you
ill kill you if you
try to separate us
ill kill you
she mine
she mine
whoa
neat trick with your voice
daddy mommy trying to
take dolly away from me

through some changes
youre not hearing
a word im saying
that man that man karl resnick

in the field
why is he so interested in it
he interested because
he an archeologist
what are you suggesting
i dont know
i dont know
im trying to make sense of it
camilla was frightened
of the sanzia
she said that jessica
spoke to her in their language
you told me yourself
camilla spent half the day
mumbling over burning candles
if jessica said anything
she heard it from her
no she didnt elliot
she heard it from someone
but it wasnt her
okay im sorry
im tired im hungry
it the middle of the night
and i dont want to
hear this right now
mr resnick im marilyn wade
oh happy to meet
you sefora wade
i see your beauty
in your son face
how is he
he had a rough night
it was an unfortunate
experience
yes it was
i wonder if i could talk to you
about these carvings down here
oh please
these
these were removed
from the tomb
yes
well actually theyre
portions of the damaged door
see the details are exquisite
these are very old
sanzia right
correct
our son tells us
these people have
a grisly history
what is it that
youre looking for
were looking for the remains
of the sanzia devil child
the legends say
the sanzia prepared a place
for the birth of satan child
they suckled a child
that was neither man nor beast
it had the body of an infant
and the head of a goat
they fed it with the warm blood
of slaughtered children
a child so evil that
its reign of terror
almost caused their extinction
before they put the creature
to its howling death
and you knew this before
you opened the crypt
sefora whatever
made the sanzia afraid
this child was not supernatural
how do you know it wasnt
because im a man of reason
it not possible
mr resnick my daughter
has been drawing these symbols
since we arrived here
our housekeeper camilla
told me that jessica
spoke sanzia to her
she tried to warn me
and now she dead
and so is the night watchman
and so is your archeologist
and my daughter is being
touched by something
by some outside force
sefior resnick
we need help with the machine
how much time
sefiora where are you going
camilla said she has a sister
in the convent

you ignore the powers
of heaven and hell
my sister tried to warn you

but please tell me now

sanzia devil child
has been set free
it too late
listen to me im
not losing my daughter
to a goddamn
900-year-old goat head
tell me what you know
how does this thing
this spirit work
could it could it
go into something
other than a human
could it go into a doll
the devil takes
any form it desires
it can be one
or it can be many
the sanzia devil
child wants children
it will do anything
to spread its word
to the children
through the dolls
i dont know what
course satan will travel
all i can do is pray
for their salvation
you see
it has begun
there will be no end
to its reign of fear
it fear that
keeps them ignorant
to believe that
malarkey is insanity
maybe it is maybe it is
i have a husband who
thinks it insanity

to agree with him
