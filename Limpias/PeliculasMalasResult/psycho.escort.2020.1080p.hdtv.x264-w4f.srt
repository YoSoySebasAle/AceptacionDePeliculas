good impression at the retreat
that
jake sweetie
he in his room

you wanted crab rangoon
youre my sister
youre supposed to know
my order by heart
bottom of the bag
bless you
hey go easy on him
jake

that a little loud
honey
what happened
nothing
jake you promised me
no more fights remember
this happen before
or after school
after
so i wont be getting a message
from the principal
no the message is from coach
im sorry i couldnt make it
to your game today
it fine we lost anyways
this is the third fight
this semester
is he still seeing
the school counselor
yeah twice a week
you know
i just was on the phone with her
and she was telling me
about all the wonderful progress
he was making
you think
she was over-selling it
he got a black eye lori
he had a rough road
it gonna take some time
yeah
i know
i just wish i could do more
what that
it a invitation
the firm is hosting
an employee retreat
a day of wine tasting
at garrett house
sounds fun
yeah
i should really go
but
well it says
spouses and significant others
encouraged
id be the only one there
without a date
and you know
i just really dont wanna deal
with all the sympathetic looks
you know
yeah sympathy is awful
you know what i mean
i mean i already feel like
people walk on eggshells
whenever theyre around me
because of
you know
i just would rather not go
why dont you ask
that cute coworker of yours out
you know mr trivia
russell
no
why not
because hed get the wrong idea
for one
why cant it be the right idea
lori i just you know
i just dont feel like dating
right now
especially someone i work with
it just
di
it been two years
yeah im just not ready
i have an idea
now dont say no right away
the companionship collective
it like a dating service
and they pair you up
with activity partners
so you want me to rent a date
you said yourself you dont want
anything serious
i dont think so
why not
look wouldnt i
just be better off
with like a dating app
or something
these are professionals
they hang on your arm
they say all the right things
and then you say goodbye
it the perfect solution
you get the benefit of a date
without all the baggage
you cant keep avoiding
your coworkers
theyre gonna start
to take it personally
so youre really gonna go
right
i dont know
you need to stop hiding out
from life
im not hiding
are you still taking
those sleeping pills
no
i worry about you
you dont need to worry
im fine really
goodnight
goodnight
diane

there are a lot of questions
were very thorough
y-you know im just looking
for a plus-one to a work event

the pressures
that come along
with social gatherings
and the value
of keeping up appearances

a look at the schedule

more than 5 minutes

doubt your good ideas
self-sabotaging behavior

i wore the wrong shoes
im talking your ear off
im sorry it
no im sorry it not you
im just a little
nervous
well ive never done this
before
you know hire a
a companion
not that there anything wrong
with what you do i
i know it unorthodox
but i promise you it much
more common than you think

you set the parameters
and so for the next four hours
i am whoever you want me to be
friend boyfriend husband
no nothing like that
um no i just need someone
by my side for the day
you know
to take the pressure off
well there are a lot
of expectations put on people
sometimes it easier
to just play the game
i suppose we should
get our story straight
our story
how we met
first date
in case anyone asks
yes um
let see
we met through friends
i asked you out
theyd never believe that
why not
that i wouldnt beat you to it
thank you well
we should probably get going
no photos
im sorry
that was
incredibly rude of me
no it-it fine it just my
job it requires a low profile
it really hard
to be a convincing date
if youre all over social media
yes of course
you ready
i think so
dont worry
no were in this together
okay
diane diane hey

well you wanna start
with something lighter
like the chenin blanc
the sugars of the merlot
will linger on your palate
and you are
miles my date
looks like
diane brought a ringer
the man knows his wine

second date
this guy must have
really made an impression
it not a date
then why are you wearing
your favorite perfume
because
it my favorite perfume
i thought the whole point
of hiring somebody
was to avoid
romantic entanglements
it was
you seem entangled
look all of my coworkers think
that were already involved
plus my boss has made it clear
that he expects
to see him there tonight
so im just keeping up
appearances

okay well
we need to look convincing
right
right
that a lovely bracelet
thank you
it was a gift
and he told me something
that will forever stay with me
to know others is wisdom
to know oneself
is enlightenment
i think were gonna
go to the bar
it was nice meeting you
how do you do it
do what
keep track of all the lies
i prefer to think of them
as characters
do women ask you to be
a lot of different things
usually doctors lawyers
and if they wanna tick off
mom and dad at thanksgiving
im in a band
do you ever lose yourself
in all of this
sometimes
but not with you
with you
i feel like i can be myself
im glad
excuse me everyone
if youll join me at the table
dinner is served
but right now i need you
to be someone else again
okay so i admit
i spent most of the game
in the sand trap
sir that course is notorious
have you ever played
claremont greens
them greens is smooth
as pool tables
ooh i have not
ill set up a tee time yeah
how about this weekend

yeah
yeah that must be it

why do you do this
i mean work for
the companionship collective
you know what im sorry
it none of my business
no it alright
i lost my wife
and i never got to say goodbye
truth is i i dont know
that ill ever got over it
but doing this
just helps me realize
why i should put myself
out there
you know i understand
my husband robert
he he died
a little over two years ago
it was all
so very unexpected and
im sorry
no it just
it my bracelet
it pinched me
i feel like were the same
in certain ways
i know what it like to have an
idea of what your life will be
only to have it disappear
i keep trying to move on
i keep trying
to put myself out there
but
i dont know
just doesnt seem right
i know jennifer would want me
to be happy
so i try to start there
i should probably get you home
yeah you know what
it late i
i always walk a date
to the door
but this is a fake date
remember
well fake or not my mother
raised me to be a gentleman
you know for the record
you dont really have to go
to the golf course this weekend
is your handicap really a ten
no no it an eight
but i just didnt wanna
show anyone up
well
goodnight diane
goodnight
youre gonna see him again
um
um i mean i dont know
i dont really have
a a work function this month
i dont think so
you really like him dont you
no i dont i-i mean
i dont know
it okay to have feelings
it just you know
you did hire him
i dont want you to get hurt
no i know
i think it great that
youre opening up like this
you know i think it a sign
a sign for what
that youre ready
to start dating
i heard you crushed it
at the partner dinner
from who
-you know
i dont reveal my sources
come on
okay
i overheard garrett
talking to betty
garrett
what did he say
he said you crushed it
god i hope so
let me tell you
if i got this promotion
it would change everything
you know jake and i
are just getting by right now
it would mean more money
more flexibility
youre a shoe-in
you think so
no one works as hard as you
and your boyfriend
seemed to be a hit
garrett would not shut up
about his golfing prowess
you know
he not really my boyfriend
what too soon for labels
no i mean were not together
well have you ever heard
of this place called
the companionship collective
ew the rent-a-date place

i just didnt wanna go
to this wine tasting alone

and now everyone thinks
that were together
and i just dont wanna
correct anyone
please dont
dont say anything

the companionship collective

very interested to hear
youve been
actively deceiving him

a lot of thought

an ideal candidate for partner
partner

miles hi
hey
just calling to check in
you were just pretty upset
yesterday when you left
i-is everything okay
yes thank you
i-i appreciate that
actually i got the promotion
i guess
kyle didnt say anything
that great diane
we should celebrate
um you know a-actually
i dont think
that a good idea
i think we owe it to ourselves
to see where this could go
right
take a chance with me diane
tsk okay when
you get lunch at 200 right
meet me at the park
front entrance
-ill see you there
hey
gotta make this quick buddy
i have a date
was that miles
yeah it was
i was talking with betty
her son a grade above jake
she said miles isnt a part
of the big brother program
i dont understand
he not being honest with you
im sure
there an innocent explanation
ill ask him when i see him
i know it not my place
to say anything
but i think you should stay away
from this guy
youre right
it isnt your place
so im just a little confused
betty told me that you arent
part of the big brother program
at school
she said that there no miles
i have to tell you something
and it
i dont know how youre gonna
take this but
the agency insists
we use false names
false names
so youre not a miles
or a benjamin
no
that why betty was confused
because she didnt know
your real name
im sorry for the deception
the but the agency
just has really strict policies
on what we share with clients
clients
i thought
we were becoming friends i
are you still
just playing a part with me
no not anymore
i-im sorry i-i dont know
what i was thinking
no i should have i should have
told you on our second date
that-that when i knew there
was something real between us
im peter peter dwyer
you see it my real name
please stay
what are you looking for
ideally a fourth for golf
gotcha
i guess
that when it comes to dating
im a little out of practice
well you went through
a traumatic event
it takes time
it must have been very hard
it was
it still is i
you know i dont even sleep in
the same bedroom since he died
i sleep in the guest bedroom
i havent told anyone that
im glad you trust me
my wife
she had been working late
all week
it was a big project
she loved her job
she should have called me
but she didnt
and she wrapped her car
around a tree going 50
she died instantly
i know that we got off
to a rocky start
but i want you to know that
ive been more real with you
than anyone since my wife died
and ive been wanting to share
myself with you for a while now
thank you for hearing me
i like being with you
you make me happy
and i just havent had that
for a long time
russell what

his name isnt even miles
when i tried to hire him
they told me his name was greg
when you tried to hire him
i was worried about you
that gives you no right
to insert yourself like this
and his name isnt even greg
or miles
it peter dwyer actually
he told you
yes
it agency policy
to use fake names
okay but he let you think
