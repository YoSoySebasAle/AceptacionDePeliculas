our next guest is near
and dear to my heart
it actually a story that
i covered when i was
still a local reporter
out in the field
okay okay
i still can remember the
night that the call came into
the news room that a
young mother was missing
i was one of the first
reporters out on the scene
and police were everywhere
searching for answers but
finding very little
it was such a somber scene
and it seemed quite hopeless
fortunately our story
took a turn for the best
im gonna let her come out
and tell the story herself
let bring out
laurie curtis
thank you for having me
thanks for being here
you look great
thanks so do you
and congratulations
on your own show
this is so exciting
you must have been so
scared when you did
decide to make a run for it
yes absolutely
but i kind of looked
at it this way
i knew i was fighting for my
life so id rather take my
chances trying to escape than
to hang around and see what
he had in mind for me
sure sure i can
understand that
so tell us what
happened next
did the police ever
catch up with him
well the police
have been very helpful
i told them everything that
i knew and i even tried
to help them locate
where the barn was
and they were able to
find out who he was
and where he lived
but once they got there
he had been long gone and
unfortunately he been
evading the police i guess
for about a year now
but they assure me
theyre still on the case
it such an
incredible store
youre such an amazing woman
oh well thank you
i give the credit
to the lord
i know that without him
i wouldnt have
gotten through it
i just know that all good
things come from the lord
and that he takes care of us
and i knew if i had faith
that i would see my daughter
and my husband again
so he answered my prayers
here i am
well were so thankful to
have you here today

460 to dispatch

we have a suspect at large
and he is wounded copy
the laurie curtis place
affirmative
i need any assistance we can
get from any local
police departments
also get the canine unit
en route immediately
we need to lock this
whole area down
do you copy
copy
he back
that exactly
how it happened
and people think im lying
when i talk about it but i
dont even see why i would
make something like that up
well it is pretty
hard to believe
come on man
no im not calling you a
liar or anything im just
saying it pretty stretched
why would she lie about
something like that
i mean it like
something out of a
movie you know
it crazy
well i believe
you madison
thank you lacey
well did they get him
honestly the last thing i
did anybody
shhhh
what i just want to know the
score of the game
shhhh
i heard something
sit down dude
no i thought
i heard it too
yeah me too
maybe it was just
a squirrel or
something you know
yeah it could
have been anything
you know the police
finally found out who the guy
was based on where they
found laurie curtis
apparently he was just a
regular guy according to the
people at his church but he
got in a bad relationship
with some girl and she was
kind of after him
because he had a good job
and some money
and so eventually he figured
it out and he got
fed up with it
so he tried to end it but
she wasnt going that easy
it just the
relationship not working
what not
working about it
all of it
tyler youre going
to have to be a bit more
specific than that
we just seem to be going
in our separate directions
you dont even go to
church with me on sunday
church has nothing
to do with anything
but it does it has a
lot to do with what i feel
were not having
this discussion again
dasha i think it time
you go your way and im just
going to go mine
we can work it out just
like we have
every other time
it hasnt worked
i think it time
for you to leave
no
no
im sorry
youre sorry
youre sorry
for everything that ive
done for you youre sorry
yes
it not over not
until i say it is
so she went to the
police and made some nasty
accusations like hed been
beating her and
things like that
and unfortunately for
him she was
pretty convincing so
he doesnt love me
im sergeant jake lyons
id like to come inside and
ask you a few questions
okay is everything okay
they gave him
five years in prison
he didnt do very well there
the police started getting
really worried because he was
extremely violent and
introverted and so they put
him in isolation
and then about
three years went by
eventually his attorney came
back and proved that his
girlfriend had been lying
and so they set him
free on probation
that still doesnt explain
why someone would go after
people like that though
well people all respond
differently under pressure
and i cant imagine being
convicted of a crime
i didnt commit
it must be awful
yeah
all right you guys
gather around and listen up
here the situation
we got a suspect on the run
probably on foot and we have
strong reason to believe
that he is seriously injured
now i know some of you made
big plans for tonight but i
just cancelled them
relax and here what
we need to do from here
we need more manpower
to aid with the search
let activate a full recall
wake them up if you have to
let get something very
clear right now folks
were going all
night if we have to
i want this guy apprehended
before the sun comes up
now where my map of the
area around highway 56
got it right
here sergeant
all right highway 56 is
here here lake mitchell
and these are the
surrounding woods here
now according to the
report the suspect entered
the woods somewhere
around here
we believe he heading
east towards the highway
okay here what
were going to do
i want units here
here and here
i want to seal off
this entire area
i want check points set up on
any road that leads anywhere
near that highway
is that understood
yes sir
any questions
no sir sir
no sir
let make it happen
you got it sergeant
all right who
in charge here
that would be me
not anymore
how about some coffee
i would love some
i meant get me some
officer simpson get
this man a cup of coffee
so what does the fbi
want with this guy anyway
we believe he involved
in more than just these
local abductions
weve been watching the grid
to see if he was going to
pop up anywhere
i guess he a bit more
obsessed than we thought
anyway we really
want this guy
and i know youve had
mayberry finest working on
the case but the big boys
are here now so you girls
can turn in for the night
catch up on your
beauty sleep perhaps
agent manson you
know what i think
no what that
i think everything was
just fine until you
sergeant sergeant
serge come on now
what the status
on the canine units
um
today would be nice
looks like theyre
all on their way
the first one should be there
in about five minutes and
the rest should
be there in 20
come on people
at this pace wed be lucky if
this guy hasnt managed to
walk to the state line by the
time our net is deployed
look radio them tell
them to step on it
i want everybody there
in ten you got it
yes sir
now let move people
he a good boy
it just seems so wrong
for all of that to happen to
one person
seriously it reminds me
of those sayings that go
around on e-mail like when
someone wrecks their car and
it falls into the river and
just when you think theyre
about to drown all the
sudden they kick in the
windshield and then
they start swimming
i know exactly what
youre talking about
so any ways theyre trying to
get away from this alligator
and theyre able to get away
from the alligator but they
have the missing leg
so theyre trying to go up
this impossible hill and as
soon as they get up the
impossible hill they see
this car like were
going to be safe right
so theyre trying to get to
the car and as soon as they
get to the car the car loses
control hits them
and kills them both
isnt that crazy
that so wrong
that really rough man
hey i didnt
make it up okay
it got a name and it
called something like the
the worst luck award
we know ashley
exactly
but you know what
they are kind of funny
in a morbid way
but theyre sad too
doesnt morbid mean sad
okay ashley
that no squirrel
aah
are you crazy
we have a like a grizzly
squirrel back here and
youre cracking jokes
mocking oh
im so scared
oh luke please save me
please luke
i want you to save me
get off me
you smell horrible
we could have done
without you on this trip
ashley
ashley
hey
hey
come back here
ugh
hold up hold up
what are you thinking man
we could have killed you
yeah what wrong with you
we thought you were
going to kidnap her
youre lucky we
didnt mess you up
oh how sweet
her guardian little angels
what are you
doing here anyway
i thought you had some
competition or something
to go to

would be funny

attention all units

rendezvous point on the double

on the double
serge just got a
radio dispatch from 9
theyre sending
over an audio file
they think it has to
do with the suspect

in my backyard
maam are you in
immediate danger
no i think he went
back into the woods

description of him

dressed in all black
i think he saw me
maam just remain calm
we have units

that two miles east
of mrs curtis house
it looks like it
was 5 minutes ago
5 minutes

hasnt gotten away
contact the ground units
tell them they have a
gopher net deployment

clicks east 5 minutes ago
moving towards highway 56
move to intercept

no shots fired unless you
have to let move it
hey serge helicopter

whirring overhead
corporal i think
we got something
yeah he definitely
been through here
4 apex command he definitely
been through this way
all right everybody from
now on were going silent

wire hanger so we dont have

oh
it not going to work
got another marshmallow
so i havent seen you
around church much lately
what up
oh um nothing is up
ive just been busy
that all
that cool
i know you got
a lot going on
i just miss
seeing you around
that all
thanks brother dave
who knows
maybe ill be back some day
yeah
just dont wait too
long all right
what do you mean
aw nothing
forget it
no seriously what
do you mean
well you see
this fire here
there this guy and
everybody liked him
i mean a really cool guy
class act
made good grades
had a great girlfriend
even got along good
with his parents
went to church regularly
he just had it
all going for him
and then one day out of
the blue his girlfriend
dumped him
i mean no warning
just like that
and that just sent a
shockwave through his life
one thing started going
bad then another
pretty soon his grades
started to slip
and that led to more fights
with his parents and then
before long he dropped
out of church completely
it so funny how we run
from the one place that can
actually help us you know
anyway this guy life
is in a free fall
i mean even his close friends
have just given up on him
just wrote him off
next thing you know several
weeks have passed and he
sitting at home by
himself depressed
alone in the dark
hadnt even left the house in
a couple days and he just
sitting there by
the fireplace
that the only light
in the entire house
then he hears a
knock at the door
kind of scares him
he knew he hadnt invited
anyone over so he ignores it
a few seconds later
the knock is back
this time a little louder
little more intense
he says all right i didnt
invite anybody over
so he just ignores it
a third time
boom boom boom
even louder
so finally he gets up and he
walks to the door and as he
puts his hand on the doorknob
and opens it he looks out
and sees this huge
dark silhouette
as he peering into the
darkness trying to find out
who it is his eyes adjust
and he sees an old friend
from church standing there
it a freezing cold night
and his friend is just
staring at home and he
says can i come in
and he guys is like
well yeah come on in
so he reluctantly let him
in and they walk into the
living room
again there no lights on
so now there two guys
sitting there staring
at the same fire
neither of them
saying a word
so a few minutes go by
and then a few more
before you know it a
half hour has gone by
these guys have said nothing
finally the friend that
invited himself over gets up
and the guy thinks he
fixing to leave but instead
he walks up to the fireplace
just like this and he takes
those fireplace tongs and
he reaches into the fire and
he grabs one red hot coal
and takes it out and he holds
it up and then he sets it
right in front of them on the
brick hearth and he
just watches it
so his friend looks at it
they stair at it as
it was bright red
and then it turns kind of a
light orange and then a soft
pink and before
long it turns gray
and goes out completely
completely cold
so he stares at that
for a few minutes
and then his friend without
saying a word grabs the same
tongs picks up the coal
that completely lifeless
and he sets it right back
in the middle of the fire
and immediately the coal
burst to life alive with
flame red all the
coals igniting it
and they just stare at
it for a few seconds
and then the guy gets up
pats his friend on the back
and he walks out
without saying a word
and just before he gets to
the door our depressed
friend stops and
says hey wait
youre right
i appreciate what you just
said even though you didnt
speak a word
your sermon came
through loud and clear
i needed that
i have grown cold but i
promise you this ill be
back where i belong among my
friends back in church
this sunday i promise
so what happened next
well since you asked i
watched my friend put his
hand on my doorknob
at the house
he opened it and he let
himself out of my house and
he walked into the
cold night air
that was you
yeah that was me
and by the way ive
kept my promise
ive been back at church ever
since where i belong among
my friends
now when the struggles of
life come my way and the
cares of this world seem to
weigh me down i run to the
place that can help
me and not from it

to have you back

little boy grabs his
sister by the hand
he goes up to the door and
he turns the doorknob and he
opens the door
and then he sees this huge
black coffin staring down at
them its mouth just
opening and closing
opening and closing
the little boy and the
little girl they scream
they run to the bathroom
it their last chance
they lock it and the little
boy is so scared he hops
into the bathtub and he
closes the shower curtain
and the little girl is in the
corner just cowering rocking
back and forth
well finally she gets up
and she opens the medicine
cabinet and she grabs the
cough drops and she throws
them at the coffin
and it stops the coffin

about that at all
