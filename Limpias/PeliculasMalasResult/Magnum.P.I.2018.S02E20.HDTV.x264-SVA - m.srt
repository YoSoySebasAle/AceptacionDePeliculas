suspicious
dont mock me all right
i can tell something up
ice never has had a cell phone
even when most guys in prison
had burners
hmm
what is it
it a text chain
with some number
i dont recognize
ice is meeting up
with somebody tonight
well it probably the woman
he was just talking about

every angle i can think of
to keep higgins in hawaii

shell be on a plane to london
she says shell be back
but who knows
could take a while
for this whole visa thing
to get sorted out
a lot can happen
between now and then
maybe shell change her mind
decide london is
where she ought to be
maybe shell meet someone
one thing seems certain

as far as i know
he didnt get into details
look ill text you his contact
info so you can follow up
great yeah much appreciated
no problem
hope it works out
alohaaloha

theyre saying you guys

no man not me
my-my my partner
you know he was gonna do that
no of course not
son of a bitch popped the guard
then turned the gun on me
before splitting with the cash
i was lucky to get away
that looks bad
i got to get you to the hospital
no no no hospitals
youre gonna bleed out
then let it bleed out
im getting your ass
to the hospital
youre gonna tell
the cops what you know
ricky ricky forget it
you were there
you know who the killer is
im not turning myself in
i didnt kill nobody
and i didnt steal nothing
ice you got to do something
i am not gonna spend what time
i got left in a cage
besides i tell five-o everything i know
youre gonna end up
there with me
what happened
whose blood is that
icepickis he okay
he alive
listen i-i need your help
you heard about that
warehouse that got hit
in pearl city last night
yeah i-i saw it on the news
icepick was there
well you got to tell hpd
i cant
rick someone died last night
i know you guys are family
but this is magnum
it about more than that
look
i knew it was going down
i saw icepick last night
so you knew about it
and you didnt do anything
no i got in his face
i told him he couldnt do it
i told him to turn around
and walk away
hell
i thought he did i gave him a ride home
and he still went through with it
yeah
you were with him last night
you had advance knowledge of it
considering your relationship
theyre gonna think
you were involved
that why im here
if i go to the cops
we could both end up in prison
but there a killer on the loose
somebody got to catch him
and im sorry to put
you guy sin this position
but i dont know
who else to turn to
look thomas i need your help
sorry about the blood
there some pain medication
in the cabinet next to the fridge
i didnt want
to come here
rick insisted on it
it just as well he did
tell us about your partner
his name is adrian reese
we were in halawa together
he was getting out
he had a score lined up
wanted to pick
my brain about it
i figure i aint going anywhere so
so you gave him your take on it
for a roll of commissary stamps
and a pack of smokes yeah
but then i got out early and
i figured
what the hell ill hit up reese
and maybe he wants
some company
where do we find this guy
i wouldnt know
is there any information
you could give us
any detail that might help
no
come on there got
to be something
ice think
there a guy lying dead
in the morgue because of us
what are you talking about
because of us
i didnt see you there
i shouldve stopped you come on rick
you know you had
nothing to do with this
no i shouldve stayed with him
made sure he didnt go back
instead i trusted you
yeah well then you
didn’t learn what i taught you kid
what that
never trust a crook
yo
yo i got your message
you all right
yeah im fine
all right anything
you need i got you
thanks
yeah
thanks tc
im here for him
if you didnt have
a hole in you
the two of us
would be having words
youre a good friend
like you shouldve been
look my boy could go down
because of what you did
all right tc just
take a breath
no he right
i got myself into this
im the one
who got to make it right
where do you think youre going
to find reese
yeah that not happening
magnum right
youre in no fit state to go anywhere
you need to stay here
till you get your strength back
let us do our job
what this about
our client thinks this guy reese
might be the father
of her child
so we need to find him and collect dna
well you need a
court order for that
unless you plan to raid
his trash in search
of a half-eaten sandwich
or some used dental floss
right now were just focused
on uh tracking him down
he gone off grid
i can let you look at the file
but you cant take it with you
deal
here he is
all right thanks
hey listen i just want to say
im sorry to see you go
but i think you made
the right decision
i appreciate that
i hope this one doesnt give
you too much grief while im gone
heard that
let me know when
you get settled
im thinking about taking my
son to europe for summer vacation
maybe well look you up
oh yeah
you absolutely have to
id love to show you around
okay it looks like our guy
reese has a bunch of aliases
okay well
that a good place to start
all right thanks gordon
owe you one
just one
cheerio
hey when youre back
in london you dont mind
if i ask you to do stuff
like this for me right
hmm if i said i would mind
would it stop you
probably not
and besides i figure
it the least you can do
considering youre kind of
bailing on our partnership
im sorry but that is not my choice
is that why youve been
avoiding me this whole time
cause you think lm abandoning you
im not avoiding you
youve been on the surf ski
three times a day
since i told you i was leaving
well i like to surf-ski
no one likes paddling that much magnum
okay i take it back
youre not bailing
on me i just um
im disappointed
that youre leaving
so am i
hey
anything yet
were working on it
how mr hofstetler
he uh
he sleeping
what going on
robin coming to hawaii
i told him it wasnt necessary
that we could
deal with the particulars
of my exit over the phone
i-i dont think that it
what do you mean
well i talked to a guy
from five-o and he said
he may know a lawyer
who can help out with this
but it-it
very expensive
so i asked robin
to look into it
i wish you hadnt done that
why not
because robin’s already done so much for me
yeah you didnt ask
him to do anything i did and besides
it a long shot
uh almost zero percent chance
that it
gonna work
what is it
i dont know but
robin said that um
if it doesnt work he still
wanted to say goodbye
that very thoughtful of him
yeah well that robin
you know id like
to throw you a party
before you go uh
assuming im not in jail
thank you rickyeah
why dont you go home
take a shower
and maybe check in on the bar
uh no im-im okay
ill stick around
rick seriously
go take care of yourself
weve got this
all right well uh
call me if you find reese
i feel bad for him
shouldering the weight of this problem
he shouldnt blame himself
i dont think it that
i-i just think he feels like
icepick betrayed him
well he not wrong
i mean if it were me
i dont know
that i would protect him
yeah i dont think
i would either
but it complicated
i mean without icepick
rick probably wouldve ended up
on a very different path
rick feels like he owes him
yeah
oh i have something
reese used one of his aliases
to check
into the honua lani inn
then let head over there
but uh
but um this is the
picture of the guy
promise me you wont use
that fake badge when im gone
this little piece of tin
opens a lot of doors okay
so that a no
it-it helps me do my job
asking me not to use it
is like asking steph
curry not to use his jump shot
a jump shot yeah we have basketball
in england magnum
the door been busted open
mr hofstetler
he aint here
we mustve just
missed him
you lied to us
yeah well i didnt
want you more involved
than you already are
so you were just gonna execute
a man in cold blood
he didnt hesitate to pull
the trigger on that guard
last night couldve been a clean score
but that wasn’t good enough for reese
no no he wanted
to have it all for himself
and he didnt want
to leave any witnesses
20 years ago
i never would’ve trusted a guy like that
because i did
youre all in a fix now
maybe you can
still do some good
tell us what you know about
reese so we can find him
yeah then what
then we turn him in
figure out some way to
keep you and rick out of this
man you dont get it
i dont want
to put him back behind bars
i want someone
to stick him in the ground
it the only way you stop a man like that
he evil
even if you are right
that not what rick
wants us to do
hey boss yeah
there was a guy in
here looking for you who
he didnt leave his name
he sitting in the booth over there
all right thanks
funny ive been
looking for you
walk
walk all right
where the car
take it easy
it the porsche
good let go for a ride
okay where do you want to go
youre gonna take me
to icepick let go
if he moves off that sofa
shoot him you got it
oh girls
they want to have fun
rick
okay were on our way
we got to go
okay
i know it doesnt look like it
but i swear i got in
some pretty good shots
yeah sure you did
i did seriously
and i believe you
it doesnt sound like you do theodore
guys please
what did he want
he wanted to finish what
he started with ice
yeah dude mustve seen
coverage of the robbery
heard that there was only
one dead body instead of two
knew he messed up
yeah well if he hunting icepick
it only a matter of
time before he finds him
im more concerned
about you at the moment
im gonna be fine
maybe now you are
but reese knows that
you can link him to that heist
he gonna want you dead too
ah he got the money if he was smart
hed get off this rock
while he still can
if he was gonna do that
he wouldve done that yesterday
think he more concerned
with tying up loose ends
you sure
it sounds risky
i guess it better than
looking over your shoulder
for the rest of your life
we dont have a choice
we have to bring
the fight to reese
we have to find him
and take him down
before he gets to rick
and icepick
you guys got any leads
none of reese other aliases
from hpd panned out
but icepick did mention
another name
he been using
carl brewer
were looking into it now
all right well im
staying here with orville
until this whole
thing over
i dont need a bodyguard
im staying
he staying
i dont know you too well
but the way
youre looking at me
feels like you might
want to use that thing
believe me im tempted
no one was supposed
to get killed
given your experience
you had to know
that was still a possibility
ive been on the inside
for a long time
being on the prowl
that it what i do
i couldnt resist
one last score
i really didnt want anyone
to get hurt
uh-huh
what about rick
what about him
he like your son
youre supposed to protect him
i always have
best i could
until now
you put him
and everyone i love in danger
and for what money
you only care
about yourself
should be ashamed
i am
wasnt about the money though
then whyd you do it
i havent got that long left
i just wanted to
feel like it used to
i needed something
to make me feel alive again
really really alive
if only for
just one night
figure what have i got left
to lose
you had rick
wasnt that enough
it shouldve been
i guess ive been lying to
myself about being at peace
truth is
im not ready
to die just yet
anything on carl brewer
yeah
reese actually used that
alias to get a cellular data plan
oh okay score one for icepick
mm-hmm
ping the phone yet
why is it everything that
comes out of your mouth is a query
what im driving
youre laptop-ing
laptop-ing
it just not my thing
firstly laptop-ing is not a word
and secondly you really ought
to make it your thing magnum
if youre gonna continue
your business without me
well maybe you can teach me
before you leave
i have days magnum not months
and as to your query i cant ping
mr brewer cell phone
because it dead
but according
to his cell phone records
he did call one number
more frequently than most
and that belongs to a
leon yates
leon yates
name sounds familiar
could you pull up the news
coverage from the robbery uh-huh
leon yates
was the armed guard who
was killed during the heist
seems he wasnt such an
innocent victim after all
no he more like
an inside man
which would explain
how reese knew
that there was a safe
full of cash in the warehouse
yates have any family
says here he was survived
by a girlfriend
cynthia lloyd in kalihi
maybe she knows something
ms lloyd
yes
im jan hawks
this is travis mccoy
were investigating
the warehouse robbery
on behalf of its insurance company
were very sorry
for your loss
we heard your
boyfriend leon
was a very dedicated
security guard
do you mind
if we ask you a few questions
do we have to do this now
we understand
it a difficult time for you
generally in these circumstances
it better to move quickly
well only take a minute

saw a press conference
you guys got back from the sandbox
few years ago
pow heroes
okay you got me
but this doesnt
look like a hostage situation
on a hunch id say these two
had something going on
behind leon back

stab him in the back
and then steal his girl
not in that order but yeah
what do you want
