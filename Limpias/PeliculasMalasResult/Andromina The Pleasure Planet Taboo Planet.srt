our king must be anointed
with the sacred oil
before he crowned
ok
is this pleasing
to his majesty
oh yes
oh yes
how did i get picked
to be king actually
it written in
the sacred scrolls
that our king once
banished will return
the one who walks as a man who
walks into our village is king
so any guy that walked into
the village could be king
only the chosen one
oh right
right
right
ok so what your name
im called roxy
roxy
roxy i like that
so what do you do here roxy
ive been waiting
for your arrival
really
that it
ive been trained
by the holy sisters
my entire life to serve
the king once he returns
wow it must have been
pretty boring waiting for me
the anticipation
it been terrible
ill bet
ill bet
so what did these
sisters teach you anyway
hello
anybody
i have rights you know
the intergalactic alliance
planetary conference clearly
states that no traveler
traveling with an alliance base
shall be imprisoned
against his will
now i dont want to have
to get ugly on this
but my cousin
well he a lawyer
all right
now that what
im talking about
good morning mr jacobs
or can i call you cody
who are are
and what in the hell
is going on here
language cody
language
what is this
i am prefect alexa
the ruler of this sect
and you were caught
trespassing in our territory
there are no men allowed
why do you think i came here
there are clear
warning beacons
the galactic
alliance has honored
our desire to stay isolated
i didnt think a little
visit would be so bad
is that right
what is that
a mob of anxious women
outside this building
theyve heard of your
arrival and would like
to see a man for themselves
really
well bring them on
im anxious to meet them
you see cody
i cant let that happen
leave us
your presence here is causing
quite a bit of a problem
then send me back
it not that simple
if i do that the problem
will still linger
and what problem
would that be
men are a disease
they infect us distract
us and generally
lower the standard of living
correct me if im
wrong but without men
there wouldnt be any women
it takes two to tango
if you get my drift
please we perfected
successful breeding programs
eons ago
all we need from you is
your essence of life
we get that delivered cod
yeah i can see how
horrible we are
is that why you cant
keep your hands off me
i think of you as sort
of a pet a plaything
it been a long time since--
never mind
i intend to prove to
the population once
and for all exactly
how evil men are
you dont mind do you
please knock yourself out
thank you
this conductor will
read your brain impulses
and transfer them to images
well see what on your mind

ill be broadcasting
your brain
activity to the population
theyll see for themselves

it an epidemic
he is a false prophet
according to our laws
he must be put to death
and you being
such a peace loving
sect cannot possibly think of
doing such an evil-minded act
is that it
you have always been the one
to govern with a firm hand
govern him
but when i propose
unity you stay away
dont you think that a little
bit of a double standard
i just dont want
to deal with the man
he gotten to you hasnt he
no i was with them
but it meant nothing

these primitive ways
really
were too stubborn to
admit it to each other
our tribe traveled too
far away from society
we want to go back
then why dont you just
join one of the other sects
on the planet
we miss men
a lot
well what can i say

omar there no going back

long without a man
we have a lot of
making up to do

have a little proposition
for both of you

yeah
well if you decide to come
with you know where were at
buy you a drink
i said no thanks
roxy
what are you doing here
i guess i couldnt
live without you
what about your laws
laws are made to be rewritten
well how did you get here
holy crap
we have some unfinished
business cody
you cant touch me here

what
ive decided to re-evaluate
our planet position on men
visiting and i figure
the only way to do that
is to see how theyve evolved
this is as good a
place to start as any
so you want to be a hostess
but no matter what happens
im still in control
well
men one kiss from an
incredible woman and they
turned to putty
a constant plane in
space circling throughout time
a never ending chase a
search for the supply
catch a fleeting glance
split second and it gone
for one chance
obsession for
on and on
oh im going to find it
on and on
across the milky way
on and on
like a thousand light years
on and on
throughout time and space
time and space time and space
time and space time and space
relief is overdue
i think im gonna crash
simulation ending
a stimulation past
on and on
oh im trying to find it
on and on
across the milky way
on and on
like a thousand light years
on and on
throughout time and
space time and space
time and space time and space
time and space time and space
