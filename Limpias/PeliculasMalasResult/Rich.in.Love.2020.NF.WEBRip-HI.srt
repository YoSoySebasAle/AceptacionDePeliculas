since their divorce
my mom only dated rich guys
that way she could have her freedom

depend on someone else
you nullify yourself you know
you erase yourself
what is it
that made me think of my mom
she died two years ago
she lived for my dad
i wonder if she nullified herself
she probably had her own dreams
i think your mom would be proud to see you
freeing yourself from your dad
from your past and chasing your dreams
would she
