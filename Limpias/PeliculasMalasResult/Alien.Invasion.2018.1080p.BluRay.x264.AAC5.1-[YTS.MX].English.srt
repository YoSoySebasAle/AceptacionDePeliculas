humanity has had
the oddest habit
of turning a blind eye
to anything
that makes it uneasy
in 634 galileo was declared
a heretic for daring to suggest
that it was in fact the earth
that revolved around the sun
and not the other way round
and even though
this was one of the most
strongly supported facts
ever disclosed
that assertion cost him
not only his reputation
but it also cut him off
from society
right up until the day he died
for centuries
thousands upon thousands
of people
have experienced ufo sightings
and various forms of encounters
with extraterrestrials
even over 3000 years ago
the mayans depicted
some of these occurrences
in their wall carvings
but of course
it wasnt until
the advent of photography
towards the end
of the 9th century
that we were able
to actually record proof
physical proof
of these sightings
but that was never
gonna be enough
what with our ingrained
mockery and dupery
which gave way
to incessant suspicion
and dogma
which of course cast such
an enormous shadow of doubt
all over this proof
at least for those
who chose to turn
hello
a blind eye
hi sara
it just your mom calling
hi mom
how are you
im fine
listen the reason
im calling is
i wondered if you may be free
to come over for lunch tomorrow
oh are you serious
you know i cant
im going away you know that
sorry love
yes you did tell me
i dont know why i was certain
that was next week
oh no mom it this weekend
couldnt
someone else from the office
at least go with you
to keep you company
mom can we not do this again
you know this not work-related
this is for my book
i know sara
mom
are you hearing yourself
were not in the 20s
anymore okay
women can travel
around the world by themselves
you really need
to accept that already
you watch
your tone young lady
this is your mother
youre talking to
and you make it sound
like i was around
when dinosaurs ruled the earth
you are so like your father
mom please tell me
youre not drinking again
course not
anyway
i wasnt gonna bring this up
but i was speaking to your aunt
and she said she read
all kinds of weird stories
about that place
youre so intent on visiting
oh mom please
well you do
whatever you think you should
i can least expect
a call from you
as soon as you get there
though right
no mom
there no signal in the forest
and im pretty sure
there no wi-fi either
okay
you know what
ill ill call you
as soon as i get home
on monday okay
all right okay
but please promise me
youll be careful with the car
oh yes mom
okay ill talk to you soon
all right bye i love you
look
and four living creatures
emerged from the center
of the image
when the creatures moved
the wheels rolled
along with them
and when the creatures floated
above the land
the wheels also floated
because the spirit
of those creatures
was in the wheels
ezekiel chapter one
so as the prophet predicted
humanity found itself facing
one of its greatest challenges
to date
having to acknowledge
the existence of civilization
from other parts of the galaxy
we can only hope that this time
unlike what happened
with galileo
we wont have to wait
all of 300 years
to authenticate the veracity
of the unmitigated proof
we will be providing today
that must be it
excuse me
um um im headed
to the military barracks
is this the right way
youd think god
might at least do something
about our appearance
and that damn foul smell
when our souls
finally abandon us right
it definitely not one
of his stronger points
twenty years on the force
and the smell doesnt get
any kinder on the senses
i dont know
how you do put up with it
no different
to a deer or a boar
you say so
i just about
had enough of it joe
this has got to be the only
nature reserve in the world
where the damn bears
choose not to hibernate
what can i say
the unpredictable mysteries
of nature
yeah well a fucking truce
over the winter
would be doing everyone
a favor now wouldnt it
sure but like i already said
the temperature affects
their behavior
and besides
people know all well and good
the danger
theyre putting themselves in
by coming out here
there are warning signs
at every entrance
not to mention
the permit you need
before youre even allowed
to step foot in this place
yeah fucking waste of time
if you ask me
i dont why you all get off
on that red tape bullshit
well
looks like youve got your work
cut out for you
youd best get on with it
yeah i best had
um
youll have to excuse me
call me or come find me
whenever you want
mi casa su casa
and all of that
yeah right
moron how many times
ive got to tell you
no taking photos around me
get the fuck outta here now
it okay boss it okay
jesus christ
oh my god
oh my god
youre joe right
uh yeah
you must be the journalist
yeah something tells me
you knew that
before you scared
the hell out of me ranger
sara hamilton
yup thatd be me
good
well it great to see
youve brought your permit
and turned up on time
i wish everyone else
would take a leaf
out of your book
yeah well
i had no other choice
some guy on the phone
gave me strict instructions
otherwise there was no way
i was getting in here
yeah
uh that guy on the phone
might have been me
well you cant be too careful
you know
uh sometimes people
are too smart
for their own good
and they only realize
once it too late
yeah i got you
we need to know
when people are gonna be here
so we can be around
to keep watch over you
contrary to what
most people believe
the biggest obstacle
isnt getting in here
it getting out
alive
yeah the bears
exactly
yeah i saw the commotion
on the river bank
well i hope
the man upstairs
doesnt give us any problems
i think well be okay
but were gonna start
inside so
you dont have anything
to worry about
great
what do you say
we do this already
ill follow you
so what do you think
of this so far
it amazing
cant wait to get inside
something tells me youre not
gonna be disappointed
humans need something
to hold onto you know
and when it something
you cant
quite get your head round
you take your own ignorance
as the truth
well that a lovely
philosophy joe
but there must have been
documented cases
of sightings and contact
before what happened
well sure
but there no actual proof
of anything
from the moment
the barracks were built
until they were abandoned
official records you mean
well yeah
i couldnt tell you
about anything off the record
although i guess
i gotta warn you
strange things still happen here
now and again
shit
what going on
okay just keep quiet
what
oh my god
okay sara just do exactly
as i say
okay
okay
now on three
i want you to run out
of the forest as fast as you can
towards the barracks
as if your life depended on it
wait what about you
no dont ask questions now
for god sake sara
okay just run
and no matter what you hear
dont look back you hear me
no looking back
okay okay
one
two
three run sara run
fuck fuck fuck
help
help
come on
come out here
you dont get the balls do you
couldnt you have picked
a better time
cant you see weve got guests
come on come out here
where the hell are you
you still havent learned
who makes the fucking rules
around here have you
oh god oh god
shit
oh my god
youre a
fucking savage bastard
joe joe
joe watch out watch out
whoa whoa whoa
jesus what the fuck
jesus ed
what
you know him
yeah of course i do
everybody does it ed
didnt i mention him earlier
no no you didnt
oh well he as weird
as they come but
his heart is in the right place
isnt it buddy
jesus joe
yeah
i caught it on the iron rails
on the fence
we need to get you
to a hospital
it nothing
what
yeah all right
whatever you say
where he going
uh he got
a first aid kit in his hut
he gonna stitch it up for me
come on
youre joking right
no
it not the first time either
these sort of things happen
all the time
come on
he lives down there
no of course not
he lives in a caravan
in the forest
on the other side
of the barracks
but if we go this way
we avoid having to deal
with that friend
of ours outside again
yeah
and were just gonna
go down there just like that
come on
itll be more fun this way
yeah
you could say ed
the real keeper of this castle
he scares prying eyes away
even the damn bears
are scared of him
but what is he
mute or something
uh not exactly
he just
not the most talkative
of people
but he quite the erudite
youll see
here where
the officer rooms were
and at the far end
command and captaincy offices
and why was there a nursery
oh
some of the higher officers
lived here with their families
there were stories
about how women became
more fertile in this forest
it was a pretty productive time
for some of them
yeah
come on
youre gonna like this
ah leave it out
will you
let me show her
come on
what his problem now
ah nothing
he just
over meticulous is all
see
this was how they got
to the higher floors
up there was the library
the living room
and the bedrooms
for the noncommissioned
officers
and down there
hell
that actually
wouldnt surprise me
yeah well
the gateway at least
dr marshall
molecular biology lab
and the weapons tunnel
were on the lower floors
and
if you stick your head in there
for a few seconds
you can still hear the screams
of the long-lost souls
who were trapped down there
youre making fun of me
arent you
you be the judge
oh my god joe
what the hell is that
i told you weird things
still happen around here
dude what really down there
cause if youre not making
this up im leaving right now
yeah right were coming
keep your hat on
he wants us to get a move on
but pay no attention
well true or not
it probably not the best idea
to be walking around here
on your own
but i will put you
out of your misery
and i will tell you what it is
yeah something
that makes sense please
im serious
and by the way
do you really understand
everything that he says
um
how do i explain this
let me break it down
have you ever had a dog
yeah when i was a kid
chewie
he was part
of the family
okay
and even though chewie
all he ever did was bark
you still understood
everything he said right
yeah
exactly
well imagine if youve had
a chance to share
a couple of beers with him
im sure
your canine communication skills
would have reached
all new levels
well i never thought
about it like that
that what i was trying
to say earlier
more often than not
the truth is actually a lot
less complicated than it seems
you see
that what i was
getting at earlier
when we talked
about all those rumors
that were flying around
yeah and
what about those cries
we just heard
exactly
what about those cries
that just the sound
of the north wind blowing
through the ventilation ducts
on the lower levels
well that scared
the shit out of me
imagination can be
a man worst friend
isnt that right ed
time to visit
the underworld then
uh not yet
this is an exit
that leads directly outside
the tetis region
was one of the hot spots
where various ufo activity
was witnessed
following the cosmic call
as a result of the power burst
caused by the hiroshima
and nagasaki bombs
one of the most bizarre
ufo occurrences ever recorded
took place right here
on october 5th 946
a manned alien ship crashed
in the rocky mountain range
you can see behind me
the military swiftly moved in
a 25-kilometer radius
extending from the crash site
was declared
off-limits to civilians
it was impossible to gain access
to this forest
for the four decades
that the now abandoned
military reserve was operating
but on that october evening
before the military even arrived
on the scene
a local witnessed the event
and he took a photograph
that photograph
was published in the media
which caused
the government to launch
a relentless campaign rejecting
and debunking the proof
now in the photograph
taken by the civilian
we can see the image
of the flying saucer
and two human-shaped figures
lying on the ground
whose body measurements
deviate considerably
from the human norm
the official version
attributed the event
to a military jet
which crashed during training
caused by rotational energy
accordingly society mourned
the death of these two pilots
whose charred cadavers
were said to have been retrieved
near the fuselage
hmm
so what became
of this third figure
when they wake up
after the winter lethargy
they have one hell
of an appetite
and are seriously
sexually active
it their mating season
so they turn aggressive
because of how few
females there are
and why are there
so few females
i guess well have to ask
the man upstairs
the thing is they think
theyre the fucking kings
of the jungle you know
no respect for us humans
sara
come over to me it okay
come over here
ed
your friend back
okay okay
follow ed okay
it gonna be okay i swear

in his own particular way
shouldnt you go with him
well
oh no hurry
do you want me
to help you with
mmm no
it okay thanks
um i can probably do
a brushing up
of my sewing skills
after last time
joe can i take a look
yeah yeah of course
while the cat away
i mean ed doesnt really like
people meddling with his stuff
you said dr marshal
was in charge of the lab right
yep he was
and
he was ed dad
he was what now
yeah you heard me
ed was born and bred
in these here woods
he oblivious to the world
outside the forest
hence his
kindred relationship
with the wildlife
everyone just assumed
he disappeared
in the explosion that
killed his parents
and destroyed
the military barracks
but he was hiding in the woods
and grew up
living like a caveman
but what about his family
didnt he have
uncles or grandparents
someone
yeah
i guess there mustve
been someone
but this was
the only world he knew
that the embroidery done
yeah
i guess he just
didnt wanna leave
his memories behind you know
and he probably felt
it was his responsibility
to carry on his dad work
can i take a look
youre a reporter
with a scientific bent too
yeah of course
no secrets here
at least until
ed gets back anyway
uh

without a shadow of doubt
the types of experiments
the depraved doctor marshall
and his wife performed down here
in the depths
of the military base
although im sure youre
probably asking yourselves
what happened
to that sole alien survivor
with not a shred
of physical proof
suggesting the fact
that it even existed
maybe it was simply
just destroyed
in the explosion
that killed the doctor
and virtually
every one of the soldiers
housed at the barracks
fucking psychopath
maybe it was yes
just as maybe
on the afternoon
of april 30th 946
magda goebbels convinced
adolf hitler and eva braun
to fake their deaths and flee
to south america
