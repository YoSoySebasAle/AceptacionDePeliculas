im sorry
i-i didnt mean to

really
i really hoped that this
wouldnt affect me this year
but birthdays have never
really been great for me
well my mom died
on my birthday
she actually died
giving birth to me
so every year my birthday
kind of like a reminder
that i killed her
shit that that rough
yeah
and apparently my dad hit the bottle and disappeared
so i was raised
by my grandparents
which was great i mean
my grandpa was so amazing
but he died last year
so
well i
i just really miss him
so much
no doubt
every year id spend
my birthday with him
and he just missed my mom
so much but
he would always remember
to remind me that -
that her death
wasnt my fault
that that
some heavy shit
and it was 2 years ago
and i never even knew her
still it hard to eat cake
and ice cream you know

oh my god
im your friend celia
and i always have been
hello
hello
what your name
celia what yours
they call me donovan
it nice to meet you
donovan
can you come and play
celia
i cant im not allowed
dont worry
im here to protect you
im always going
to protect you celia
the cemetery
you saved me from that car
and countless other times
i might add
so what are you
like my guardian angel not exactly
i died too just like you
i was only eight at the time
so i understand how scared you must be
this might be easier
to explain
if i wasnt out here
freezing my ass off
if you think youre coming in here
youre out of your mind
you dont have a lot of time
two hours give or take
come 2 am it lights out
and then i suppose
i turn into a pumpkin
no then you become
completely vulnerable
to these nasty things
out here
so id can the sarcasm
because im trying to help you
im not letting you in here
just so you can turn into
one of those crazy
psycho demon things like my grandfather just did
you see that wasnt
your grandfather
it was the soul eater
that ate him
so now he can appear
act and sound like your grandfather
this is crazy
so what youre telling me
is that i wasnt only raped
and murdered tonight
but that my grandfather
was eaten
by one of those things
i dont know what to believe
well do you believe
that i am who i say i am
yes i do
well that enough for the time being
let me in
well it not locked
you actually
have to invite me in
you see
this white light around is called your sanctuary
people cant come in
your sanctuary
unless you invite them
and once in
they cant touch you unless you touch them first
so dont touch them
that would be bad
ok
come in
come with me
i have something
to show you
shit
wait hey
well come on
im not going out there
im not really good with heights
youre already dead
are you really afraid
of falling
take a look
were the only ones here
exactly it just
you and me now
that why
you gotta stick by me
wait i just saw
something look
what is that
that is a soul eater
what
a soul eater
is exactly as it sounds
it needs to feed constantly
or else it goes to hell
theyre all just waiting
for the perfect moment
when you step
out of the light
that when it can attack
youre my imaginary friend
i must just be imagining you
im as real as can be
in fact
im a little offended
that you stopped
believing in me
but you were the one
that stopped coming around
i havent seen you
since i was like eight
yeah but ive been there
the whole time
like when your grandfather joe
was in the hospital
or when you got drunk and crashed
your grandpa car into the dumpster
i was there when you lost
your virginityyou were there for that
i needed to make sure
that you were paying attention
you really never left
no
i wish i had known that
uh-ohwhat what is that
well that flicker means
that the light is dying
we need to move to a place
where the light is strong why
fastwhat happens
if it runs out
you dont want to know
come on let go inside
celia come on
hurry
celia
rachel
celia help
youve got to help meoh my god

he cant be trusted
he not like you and me
im your friend
listen to me
listen to me
celia please
youve got to help me
i dont know
celia look at me
do you remember
yes
you came here
the night i died
it was different
i always liked playing
with you
yeah right i sucked
you were always
so much better than me
well i was tougher
than you
is that why
you stuck up for me
when everybody else made fun
i knew it wasnt about you
you were worried
about hurting someone else
do you remember the night
my grandfather died
that was a terrible night
i never really thanked you
i was all alone
you barely knew me
but you stayed with me all night
i wouldnt have made it
after that night
we were connected werent we
yeah
i helped you then celia
and now i need you
to help me
please
aah
aah aah
aah
what the hell
just happened to me
gee i dont know genius
maybe it the fact you ignored everything i told you
i was confusedthere no time
for confusion
they will do whatever it takes to get into your head
to get you out of the light
you have to be smarter than them
you have to think
ok but but if she -
if itwas not rachel
then how did it know all those
personal things about me
because when it feeds
it takes everything -
memories feelings
every-
we have to get
to the basement
hurry
now
aah
try to stick by me
from now on all right
no problem
hey
look
are you seeing this
i see everything
it a gift
youll find
i have many gifts
you can only see your old world through mirrors
so this is what happening
right now at this exact moment
yes
i guess they havent
found my body yet
else the party
would be over
once your body leaves the sanctuary
your soul goes with it
then it open season
on your ass
oh come on now
dont start that
i could never stand
to see you cry
im scared donovan
well it doesnt
have to end this way
im listening
ill show you but youre
gonna have to be brave
and i know that not
your strongest suit
i guess
you have been watching
come on
what are you doing
this will lead you to a place
without soul eaters
that where this
all startedit ok
i cant
sure you can
no donovan please
i have a really bad feeling
ive been through this
a few times
i think i might know
what im talking about
that place is evil
im the guy who protected you from evil your whole life
i cant
so youd rather let them out there tear you to shreds
that what
youd rather have
there still more time
please let me see
if i can figure this thing out
if we run out of time
we can come back here
all right
thank you
remember dont look them
in the eye
aah
aah
ow
she got me
you need to cover that
hurry
theyre like sharks they smell blood
they know the source theyll come
is that the right time oh yeah
we dont get much power here
but enough for a few lights
clocks that sort of thing
it 08
if that accurate
your time is halfway gone

have died along with her
no he looked after me
he took care of me
yeah im sorry
i dont mean to yell at you
i dont wanna hurt you
i dont wanna lose you
to them you know
the fact is celia
your grandfather just went by the motions
like most people these days
after your mom died
in the end he lived
a mediocre life at best
so did i
no dont say that
sure you were timid
and held back by guilt
but you had depth
and that counts
yeah a lot of good
that did me
im just sitting here
waiting for these things to eat me
well i told you about
another option didnt i
not yet
you have half an hour
celia

something different
their rules
dont apply to me
i have sophisticated tastes

theyre just sheep in my flock
im watching them
for who
looks like your sanctuary
almost gone

you werent ready
i consider the culinary experience an art form
i nurture the souls until theyre just the way i like them
those people in the cellar
all carefully cultivated
just like you
youre disgusting
am i you know it a shame
that you died when you did
i had so many places
to guide you
so many things to acquire
true love
motherhood pride
pride is my favorite
so you were just
protecting me
so you could create
a perfect meal
but now ill just have to
work with what ive got
how about we start
with your laughter
not much to laugh about
these days anyway
such a small thing
to trade
and how about your loyalty
loyalty is quite a delicacy
and what need do you
have for it here i will give you nothing
id be careful
about what you say
this can be painful
or it can be easy
that is your only choice now
i will give you nothing
aah
maybe i should be done
with all of this
hand you to them
cut my losses
what have you done
once your body leaves the sanctuary
your soul goes with it
goodbye donovan
