crunching leaves under footsteps
panic heavy breathing
intense sounds
so how long were you
lost before i found you
i dont know
i wasnt really keeping track
of the time or anything
but i just saw this really beautiful hill
and i wanted to climb it and see the view
and then
i got lost
not a good idea i guess
you guess
that good that i found you then
yeah thanks again i dont know what i
would have done if you hadnt found me
i mean a girl can die up
if she gets lost
no i think if a bear came
i could handle myself
yeah
it not the bears you need to worry about
hey
where we going
is this the way to the trail
you sure
yeah
are you ready
no
im not going in there
oh come on i thought you
came out here for adventure
wow you are really
good at building a fire
thank you

shit
if i remember correctly
im not the one who ditched my brother
to travel along with some strange girl
but um would you be
having such witty conversations
by myself
debatable
but not impossible
ok
i guess it fate
fate
well
you dont think so
no
but it kind of romantic though
finding a lost girl in the woods
no
how we met
on a trail
a lot of people meet that way
i wouldnt say a lot
you make it sound so morose
well what if it is bad
sure
but what if it is good
anyway
youre stuck here with me now
ok whatever
i think it you who is stuck with me
ok
