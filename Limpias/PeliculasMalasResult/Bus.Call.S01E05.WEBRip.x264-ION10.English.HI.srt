
episode 5 were almost home
the guys are halfway through the
european run
in addition to a lingering
sense of fatigue
each day seems to bring
its own set of logistical challenges
yea where are we pushing it
streets are small parking is
non-existent
so we detached the trailer in the middle
of the road and pushed it over here
now were waiting for a van to put all the
gear in so we can take it across the street
so we can set up which is supposed
to start an hour and a half ago
everything pretty straightforward
on the us headline run
here it just who knows there a
lot more variables a lot more unknowns
every day it like kinda figuring out
figuring out a lot more things on the fly
we are in some dirty-ass loading dock in
manchester uk
we entered some kind of time-warp
that made us fucking six hours late
we should have been here a long
time ago but holger stopped
and everybody was asleep and
everybody slept through it
he seriously stopped at a truck stop
for five hours
and didnt empty the piss tank
and then get to the venue and
empties it all over the fucking street
ill run down maybe have to
pull it down from downstairs
im washing my underwear in the venue
because we havent seen the laundry
for days and im out of clean clothes
and this is rock n roll
what is it is it tuesday night
is that what it is
who gives a fuck
were in islington and weve been
discussing the election of
kaiser orange the 2nd
the guy won the presidency
that really fuckin happened
we should literally tweet egomaniac all day
like once
on the hour just do hashtag egomaniac
yeah it been an exciting fucking 24 hours
just watching the world
possibly come to an end
or not or who knows
it a great great time to be a nihilist
this european run consists of 4 shows
in 8 days but that doesnt mean they
have four days off any day without a
performance is scheduled because the
next gig is just too far away to make it
there in time to perform
the guys take in the sights as they can
but most off days are typically spent
nearly entirely on a bus
van train or airplane
so were in glasgow scotland michael
hometown mic hometown which is cool
in this land where i can say what the fuck
i want and people understand me
*speaking scottish*
i flew in a day before yeah to catch up
with family and my best friend
so i caught with her and my other cousin and
my mum and my aunt so that was really nice
this is my mum
you alright
this town was the fuckin
spearhead of the industrial revolution
the 70 was fuckin terrible
rife gangland violence in glasgow man
you ever heard of the ice --cream wars
yeah that was pretty fucking bad too
cameraman doesnt sound bad
they werent fighting with ice-cream
jason does this look like
something that important
yeah it used to be an old cinema here
and it used to be a circus before that
when they were excavating
prospecthill up the road
they found elephant bones and
they got a fuckin archeological team in
to fuckin
there was elephants in scotland
no there was a circus at the abc
and when the elephant died they just buried
it up the road and didnt tell anybody
geron how long is mic going to
talk about the history of scotland
until i finish wiring this fuckin plug
dick
thank you for calling advantage customer
service were closed at this time
our normal hours are 8am to 7pm
that the second time that happened
to me i cant figure out the time zones
what time is it
okay scotland
i fell asleep
to be awoken by a large bang
bam bam and i fucking see out of the
corner of my i like stuff flying
as the bus driver was fleeing the
scene of the crime so to speak
actually not so to speak
that exactly what he did
and we didnt stop we just kept going
yeah i dont know why but im
in a shit mood today though
just in a fucking shitty mood
yea everyone fucking sick of it
im kinda nervous cause
we have like 2 weeks left and
like everyday is just
exponentially getting greater
my disdain for this trip
and i want to just get
home as quick as possible
and everyone feels like that
like band and crew the shows are great
everything great were just fucking sick of it
let have a great a great
show
deep in the heart of a long tour
run patience frays
and otherwise charming quirks
of travel begin to wear you out
ahh another gig
a good touring family expects this and
works together to keep spiri ts high
and maintain a sense of humor even
through the exhaustion and monotony
yup i remember when that happened
the guy say goodbye to the bus and
head out for three fly gigs in russia
and ukraine two markets theyve been
looking forward to playing for a long
time however the band draw in those
countries is completely unknown
we are in cologne germany
no were not were in dusseldorf
oh yes we are in dusseldorf germany we were in
cologne we went to sleep and we woke up in dusseldorf
were flying to st petersburg
moscow and then ukraine playing kiev
yeah it pretty exciting there a few places
where you actually legitimately did not expect to
end up playing shows in when you first
join a band
you interpret what i say into russian
actually im very excited to go to russia a little
nervous because of the election that been going on
but seems like translating in russian
im always going to talk over you
so you just have to keep going
im pretty fucking excited to be here i
wasnt expecting all this snow i mean i know
it russia but it only november
how cold is it
fuck you cold
okay so id like to make a toast but in
the russian tradition zakuski
you should take a shot and then follow it
up instead of a lime like tequila you put a
little piece of garlic or pickle
or this garlic bread
it very exciting were in like a
traditional russian restaurant
on our first night here it pretty cool
thanks so much for bringing me on this week
and ill do my best to stay out of trouble
were in st petersburg walking to the
hotel just had a great russian meal
were about to pass a little grocery
store a sex club a sex shop
and then our hotel
let see if we make any detours cut
where are we jesse
am i covered in snow
you are yeah
were on a bridge in st petersburg
i wore the wrong jacket
i didnt realize it was snowing out
but yeah it quite a sight
were having fun with electricity today
see that that side fucked
*teaching russian pronunciation of st
petersburg*
go click on her profile picture
jesus geron look at that girl dude
go to alexandra again
she has a marry now
button on her profile
holy shit geron
i love russia russia great
*teach russian*
you literally just say kak
just like cock
ok cock
*speaking russian*
did you get all that
ticket price venue location night of the
week or a conflicting sporting event can
mean the difference between selling out
a venue and playing to a half full room
as they play their first shows ever in
russia and the ukraine they are
optimistic but do not know quite what to
expect
jason there more
people here than germany
geron are there
geron yeah probably
geron germany
jason cologne
jason last show two days ago
geron i dont remember that oh yeah
yo mo
that was a top 0 crowd
nostrovia
you totally killed it
sorry im like sweating like monkey
so hot in there oh my god
it about 600 in the
morning i think
were leaving going to the
ukraine to play a show in kiev
how much sleep did you get
uh 3 hours
about the third show in a row
today been a long day
watching these guys load
the gear is very tiring
the show in kiev was also a hit but the
guys only have a few moments to reflect
on success in russia and ukraine before
having to pack up and move along once again
it midnight we are loading
the luggage room with gear
we have to unload it at 530am tomorrow
and fly to barcelona
the last 3 shows in europe are in spain another
new market for them with an unknown fanbase
they also remain in limbo with their
record label back home
so what our actual plan
weve not heard back from the guy
theyre saying go hard at radio
weve not communicated with our radio
team they apparently have gone to radio
whatever that means
if we dont hear from them today or tomorrowa
full week after writing a letter like that
then that not only a week
that a month 5 6 weeks after um
saying we want off the label and we
still havent heard anything from them
how do we give this song a
shot because i actually believe in it
well we dont have an another option you
cant force people to do shit when youre
halfway across the world
weve got the single going to radio were hoping
for some good data in the next holiday period
if that doesnt happen it dead
it one thing to say no let go big let
go to radio hard but what the fuck does that
mean after theyve killed a campaign and
were going back six weeks later to the
same pd asking them to play the same
song that we just pulled away
from so it one thing to say that but
it can potentially harm us going big if
there not an actual strategy and plan
im tired
talk about divide and conquer theyre
actually doing that to us by turning
this entire thing negative
they have killed music for us
is this a 00 watt one
yea i mean let do a bassman for the wet i
mean yeah bassman for wet and this guy for dry
they have a shitload of amps
that arealmost right
despite a number of presale
tickets sold 5 minutes to showtime
the crowd is surprisingly sparse
the thing here the people wait until
more or less the end to grab some
beers outside because it cheaper
to get some food outside
because it cheaper too
jason then they show up
we have to do it dude there whatever 30
peopleturn that into 50 or 60 the next time
by the time im 45 im gonna have this
career off the ground dude
dude your funny bone
id hit that
right on cue the crowd showed
up as the band took the stage
that was definitely that was most
improved from expectations to actuality
i was expecting the worst show of the tour
mvp
it may still be the worst show of the
tour but it was still pretty good
the band has one more show in the
coastal town of santander before the
final show of the tour in madrid
camera hey mo
mo fuck off
camera how your day going
hey danny
camera fucking creepy his eyes are open
danny
is he ok hi
danny were doing soundcheck
danny oh my im fucking tired
although santander was one of the
smallest cities they played
the show provided one of the most memorable
moments of the tour
i think everybody faces last night was
a fucking gem to be honest with you
the band played the show it was great they
decided they werent going to play the encore
so they said play the house music
we turned the house music on
we brought the lights up in the room
and the crowd just wouldnt shut up
they wouldnt leave
there only 60 70 people here but they
were going bananas for them
jesse guys come back
they had to come back out again
honestly the sooner i get off
that fucking bus the better
camera are you excited to go home
yes very very excited to go home
when was the last time you were home
i cant remember
i think this tour was absolutely worth
it you know we lost a lot of money on it
a lot of fucking money
overall it was probably worth the
money that we spent to come here
you know very small shows but i think we
actually started something here
a base for us to come back to
particularly in eastern
europe russia poland
hey danny uh is he in here
oh hi hey go through dylan space and
go downstage to your position or
else youre going to be really fucked
jason we get to go home
jason last one
danny forever
jason no no just for a week or two
good morningit not morning if you
dont go to sleep yet
camera what time is it
5am
it sunday the 20th of november we are
going home
after four months on the road playing
60 shows in 30 states and 0 countries
the guy head back to the
us to close out the year
with two more weeks of
playing radio festivals
but with no single on the radio the future
of the album remains unclear
next time on bus call
we are at our south african
childhood home in johannesburg
well be working but at the same time were
gonna try to show the crew a really good time
its oppikoppi day
three days of just
people losing their minds
now now what do we do
