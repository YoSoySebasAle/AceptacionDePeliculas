the importance of our work

you wish
we got a party to throw
katya
come join us
katya here
oh thanks
so do you like it
i didnt know this place
hosted events like this
i thought this was just
an abandoned factory
it doesnt host anything
you mean
this is illegal
that the whole point
we firmly believe that drinking and dancing
require no permission by
any kinds or authorities
it so unbelievably cool
i know right
i want selfie
over here
well arent we awesome
this is the best party ive ever been to
actually this is mass market
we keep the best for ourselves
what do we keep
the best of the best of the best
we dont have anything
well the girls are local
they can help
what do you need
well the thing is we like to pay
visits
visits to very special
places with no hosts
you want to break into someone house
nothing bad just a house party
we dont steal and we clean up afterwards
but we need a special house
like the one on the beach
where you worked in over the summer
sasha told us everything already
this is not up for discussion
you couldnt keep your mouth shut
but it a perfect option
your mysterious prince
left long ago anyway
and you know the place
i said no
katya you brought us
to his house yourself
you have a problem and
it needs to be fixed
how exactly by going to that house
great idea
not just going katya going with vadik
scientists have proven that
repressing bad memories is good
katya when are you gonna
stop torturing yourself
you like that vadik do you
you do
first time you even look at someone else
youre smiling again so give it a chance
crimean gothic in all its beauty
wow
cool
id like to remind you
not to post anything
why
do you want us to get busted
so who is the owner
he an architect
he pretty well off that architect
yeah
it the bottom lock
they never used the top one
wait you said he lives there alone
they died
his wife and kid
here
no in a car crash
well to quote a classic
the beauty of country
life is in its informality
brilliant
that a neat place
look at the fireplace
shall we start it
sure
sorry
one hell of a place but if you ask me
there a little much of this
atmospheric decrepitude
and one of the doors doesnt open
probably stuck
it damp
maybe let blow
there no draft
maybe there a heater
sorry
im just looking for a heater
they should be under the stairs
thanks
i say
put it back now
you know the rules
what that book
a study of demonic entities
nikolai karlovich von grubbe
that our house
that quite a freak show
this part is awesome
all the sketches presented in the book
were made by the author during his
visionary revelations
like they were posing
what were they smoking back then
great question
you think her majesty will
deign to enter the kitchen
or does she think she
hired free waitresses
you just want her boyfriend
you know your fairy-tale
castle is in decay
there mold everywhere
that our dining room
yeah
the baron in the middle
let me
baron von grubbe a famous
philologist and mystic
in the early 20th century
his country house was known
as the biggest spiritualist salon
of the crimean riviera

showed him the dwellers of hell

and move on with your life

and crumbling down
i say you should come back to moscow
or next time ill take you there by force
it looks like he was staying here

summoners
of crazy ghosts

in a haunted house
boo

catch
im gonna go
cold
this species of low-order demons
dwell in the damp gloom of hell
theyre capable of inducing
sleep and colorful visions
while luring human souls
and feeding on their suffering
wait wait
despite their innate cowardice
these jackals of hell attack anyone
who dares to stand in their way
stop it
it used to be someone favorite piece
oops

maybe he left with polina
the cellar open
what the heck
did you let him out

sasha
what the hell is that
quietly leave now
katya
what on earth was that
sasha
let go
come on come on come on
can someone explain to me what going on
god damn
you dont understand
theyre gonna kill andrey
theyre gonna kill him
calm down easy
it okay easy easy
i couldnt reach polina
not now
there another car
dont look
get out of the car
into the house
this isnt gonna help
we need more fire
they dont like fire
first thing they did was clog the chimney
you know them well
well enough
what are those creeps
vadik stop it
he knew about them from the start
and now everyone dead
theyre dead
no one invited you here
why are you still alive
because i brought them here
now listen to me
your only chance is to stay here
where it warm
and burn anything you can find
you leave in the morning
when they are not so dangerous
wanna help
get enough firewood
so they are
phantoms
demons
who assumed the shape of my wife and son
monsters from another world
so all of that is real
you still have doubts
he studied hell
he found the door and left it open
when i bought the house
i didnt believe it either
what do they want
only me
you presented a danger to me
so they started killing you
keep it we need to make a torch
did they kill before us
my friend tried to take me away
i didnt know their ways back then
after that i locked the house
isolated myself from the world
and learned how to live with them
only i hadnt anticipated you
keep the fire burning
you can leave in the morning
andrey wait
im gonna make some tea
mommy
you wanna spin
come
let me spin you
hurray
how many times more i am dizzy
andrey
pass the ball
hit hit hit
great job come on come on come on
come on come on come on
you shouldnt have followed me
i couldve held them off till morning
what was that
these monsters
exist at the cost of those who let them in
feeding on their pain
but giving something in return
to me they give an illusion
that my family is still alive
only i lose them
every time
again and again
back then in the summer
they were here
i was going insane
praying for things to go back to normal
and i was heard
i started having dreams
very real dreams
that how they kept me from forgetting
then came the dampness
and then they came
standing there watching
as if saying
let us in
and well always stay with you
at some point i couldnt resist anymore
and allowed them in
the dreams started lasting for days
and then i woke up
and saw their
real faces
and realized that i invited monsters
you never tried to run
i didnt want to
damn
katya
no
no
andrey
katya no
sasha
where sasha
we need to try to start the fire again
theyre gonna kill us anyway
they wont touch him it about us
theyre gonna just keep killing
am i wrong
vadik what are you doing
he said it they depend only on him
he goes they go with him
give me another idea
there is none
lower the gun
katya he right
i brought them here
they will leave with me
katya no
no katya
run away
no
dont repeat my mistakes
let go
take her out
what
embrace me
