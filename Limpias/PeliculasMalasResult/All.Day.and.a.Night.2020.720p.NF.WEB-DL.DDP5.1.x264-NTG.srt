she hardly can understand me
by any means
im on the corner with candy
i sense the chance in the air
and the packages landed
i was stranded
on many different occasions
and always kept it silent
when facing them situations
mileage honey
go hand in them litigations
you know im paying well
dont plan on going to jail nigga
aint nothing worse
than waking up in the cell
hearing the homie died
im tired of taking these l nigga

incarcerated my brother
i tried to take it for him
he on his way to the pros
he supposed to make it for us
theyd rather break us
than build us up in this broken system
we aint no different
if we ridin round smokin niggas
but im just thirsty for revenge
itll soothe the pain
and the prescriptions i be poppin
dont reduce the pain
i throw your partner a pack
cause you let him do his thing

and you can use the chain

and try to use the name jah nigga

but i aint got it this time
i got a lot of my mind
ma still on my line
she think im still getting high
im in the field with my guys
i split a mil with my guys
it cool to be a boss
but dont belittle your guys
wounds heal over time
and over time they heal
still turning down deals
ill never turn down a drill
nobody wins on appeal
either kill or be killed
shit killin me still
you aint felt how i felt
it a real feeling for real
real feeling for real
real feeling for real
