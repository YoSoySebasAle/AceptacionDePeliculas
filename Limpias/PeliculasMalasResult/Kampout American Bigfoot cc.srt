from a couple turkey hunters
out in the hawking hills area
now theyre doing
a documentary film
and they came across what
they believe to be a bigfoot
so i went out checked
everything out
and saw the location
of the sighting
and get this they got a video
where can we see this video
got it right in the truck
let go
god look at the
size of that thing

nine and a beauty

very unprofessional
he not exactly
mr popularity
the other day i was dealing
with a missing child case--
wait wait
you say there a missing child
yeah what about it
this is just a
hunch all right
but just maybe this missing kid
and our sasquatch are connected
how do you figure
hank humans and primates
share 96% of their dna code
it the most of
any other mammal
there been actual cases
where human children
have been raised by primates
most recently the
feral child of borneo
and the nigerian chimp boy
maybe the sasquatch
abducted this kid
to raise it as one of
their own for some reason
i dont know but
it just a guess
and i say we should
go check the area
well now search and
rescue is still there
searching for the kid
great
if it did take him
maybe well find him
let take my truck just
in case we got to off road
ill get a couple of
walkies and a shotgun
all right pilgrim
