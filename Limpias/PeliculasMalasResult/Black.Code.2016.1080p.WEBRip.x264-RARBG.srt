man we are going through
the most profound change
in communication technologies
in all of human history
right now
chattering
printing press
radio telegraph television
all very important
but i believe were going
through the most transformative
purely on the basis
of three technologies
mobile social media
and cloud computing
they share one
very important characteristic
and that the amount
of private information
information that used to
be in our desktops
or filing cabinets
even in our heads
that we now
entrust to third parties
whirring
data that we are conscious of
and deliberate about
like the e-mails we send
and the tweets we post
but it also includes
a lot of information
that were completely
or mostly unconscious about
so if you take my mobile phone
even when im not using it
it emitting a pulse
trying to locate
the nearest wi-fi router
or cell phone exchange
and within that beacon is
the make and model of the phone
the fact that it my phone
because my name is attached
to the operating system
and most importantly
the geolocation of the phone

deibert continues
we are leaving
this digital exhaust
that contains
extraordinarily precise
information about our lives
our social relationships
reduced to
trillions of data points
that form now
this new ethereal layer
around the planet
that only growing
in all directions
ticking
capabilities are being put
in the hands of policy makers
five years ago
theyd never imagine
that they would have

i mean i love it

all the energy down here
the noise and stuff
like that
it kind of ait like being in a hive
yeahyeah exactly
many people believe that
you have this cloud services
that are floating around
people think okay
it a cloud server
but this is
the actual physical location
of the internet
whirring clicking
karlung continues
it a constant struggle
to protect data
voices echo
the swedish security police
wanted to install tools
to automatically
log in to our data
and get out the information
so i invited them
to our facility
and then i had a microphone
which i was provided
by the swedish public service
national radio
speaking swedish
i taped this conversation
and they were so angry
and they also wanted us
to sign a paper
where they said that
we could not say
anything about it
it should be total secrecy
they said
if a terrorist attack happens
it your fault
click buzz
man speaks swedish
karlung
it like a creepy feeling
nobody can say that
any facility is safe
there are always possibilities
to go in and find data
and take it out
people say that
oh i dont have
anything to hide
they can read my mail
i dont have anything
but it not that
which is this problem
the problem is without secrecy
there can be no democracy
without secrecy
there can be no market economy
right
there is an obvious candidate
for the nobel peace prize
reallyand that is edward snowden
i mean yeah
does the public enjoy
the same right to privacy
that we have in the past
are we still private citizens
and then public officials
where the government knows
very little about us
but we know
everything about them
why are we the public
becoming disempowered
at the same time
that governments
around the world
corporations around the world
institutions around the world
are gaining greater
and greater leverage over
the range of our activities
their knowledge of what we do
deibert the citizen lab
is an unusual place
cell phones ringing
were a research unit
at the university of toronto
we combine the skills
of engineers
computer scientists
with social scientists
we collaborate with people
from all over the world
to do the field research
that we do
and we do this
to advance research
on global security
cyberspace
and human rights
the world is
a very dangerous place
as we saw recently in
in tragic incidents
in paris
and you want to
have security agencies
be well adept at discerning
what those threats
are over our horizon
but is it okay
that the government sets up
a giant digital x-ray machine
over everything that we do
because that effectively
where were headed right now
typing
continues
weve been a kind of
digital early warning system
scanning the horizon
and what weve seen frankly
has been really disturbing
digital chirping
typing
praying chanting
chanting in tibetan
man in tibetan
it was around 430
we had just finished praying
sixty or 70 police arrived along
with 300 or 400 soldiers
they forced their
way into the monastery
chimes playing
golog in tibetan
they started ransacking
the monastery
all the monks were asking
why are they here
what are they doing here
everyone was nervous
i had a sinking feeling
one of the monastery artists
was arguing with the police
and i tried to intercede
suddenly my phone rang
so i quickly switched it off
i switched off my phone
we could hear the police outside
talking in chinese
on walkie-talkies
then the police searching inside
were called out
i could see one of them
looking closely at a photo
but i couldnt see
if it was a photo of me or not
then they came back in
and pointed a gun
to each of our heads
and we were told to put
our phones down on the ground
in front of them
as they kept us all at gunpoint
so i switched my phone back on
and put it down
in front of them
vibrates
just after i switched it
back on my phone rang
the police asked whose phone
is this i said it mine
-shouts
-blows landing
they started beating me
with their rifles
striking me with the points
and the butts of their guns
-shouting in tibetan
-blows landing
then a bunch of them grabbed me
and dragged me away
beating continues
stops
golog
they had complete records
of all our phone conversations
they knew everything
vehicle horns honking
woman in english
tibetans are watched from every
angle and from every corner
it in their homes
it in their offices
it in the streets
in tibet
certainly in central tibet
and around
the capital city of lhasa
chinese authorities
together with
chinese corporations
telecommunications companies
theyve integrated
the ability to spy on people
via their mobile phone
via the last communications they
may have had over the internet
down to the closed circuit
television camera
on the streets
the chinese so strictly
control access to tibet
it just like a black hole
for media
for independent observers
for international agencies
for anything
golog in tibetan
ever since i started being
politically active
i never gave a thought
to my own security
i just see it
as a responsibility
that comes with being tibetan
woman speaks in tibetan
golog
how i escaped is a secret
light music
tethong
people
are incredibly courageous
people inside tibet will
send out news and information
and theyll say
i want this story to be told
they could be imprisoned
they could be tortured
their family
could pay the price
music continues
we on the outside have to decide
how to walk this very
sort of fine line between
protecting people security
and honoring their wishes
about getting news
and information out
and we know for a fact
thanks to citizen lab report
that we are being
successfully targeted
music stops
a new report has been released
from a group
of digital detectives
from their computers in toronto
theyve tracked
a high-tech spy ring
that reaches around the world
typewriter clicks
reporter for the past ten months
these computer experts have been working as cyber sleuths
hot on the trail of a massive electronic spy network
they say it has taken control of nearly 300 high-level computers
in more than 00 countries
a discovery that could have major political implications
they can extract any
document they wanted
they could turn on web cameras
turn on audio devices
so that they could
in effect use the computers
as a listening device
in the offices
reporter the web of intrigue started with the dalai lama
who thought his computer had been hacked
up until about 2007 or 2008
id never really heard
of malware
you know id heard
of viruses obviously
but i hadnt really heard
about targeted malware attacks
affecting
the human rights community
clicking
first time i heard about it was
in the context of the tibetans
gradually
we started piecing together
they are under surveillance
the surveillance comes
from groups within china
theyre using malicious software
and socially-engineered e-mails
e-mails that are crafted
to get them to open it up
to get inside their devices
reporter nart villeneuve a computer wiz
figured out how the operation worked
by getting the attackers to hack into his computer
were monitoring these groups
for long periods of time
and youre essentially waiting
for them to screw up right
and when they do
you take advantage of that
sometimes it takes a long time
you could be monitoring a group
for a year and get nothing
then one day
they just use a server
that they dont lock down
and all the data
just sitting there
i was at home
it was pretty late
typing
deibert
nart was scouring through it
trying to figure out
what actor is responsible
for getting inside
the dalai lama office
and there was
a 22 or 24 character string
that kept coming up
that he couldnt figure out
what is the meaning of this
so on a whim he just copied
and pasted it into google
one website came up
and it was chinese characters
so he clicked on it
mouse clicks
to my surprise
what came back
was the actual page
that the attackers used
to interface
with the compromised systems
so they set up a website
where they could monitor
their victims
but they didnt
password protect it
so it was like a window
into everything they were doing
electronic music
nart
this wasnt just targeted
at tibetan organizations
or human rights organizations
this was global
a pretty wide range
of institutions
that showed that
these attackers were
were quite busy
there was huge pickup
in the media
it was all over the world
and it put us on
a different kind of footing
in terms of our credibility
in the cyber security community
we were novices at that time
we were kind of outsiders
no audible dialogue
so we were kind of
calling it on the fly
like what do we do
what the right thing to do
who do we notify
i knew that publishing it
was important
we had to redact
a lot of the information
to protect people
should we notify the government
should we notify
the canadian government
how do we notify
other governments
that are being victimized
at the time you know
we didnt want
to completely disclose
everything that we had done
because we
wanted to do it again
deibert
in some of the communities
i mentioned they loved it
but i got the feeling from
certainly inside
my own government
there was a lot of weirdness
interviewer
are we allowed to speculatewell i think now we know
because there
a snowden disclosure that
explicitly references the fact
that the canadians
and the americans
our signal
intelligence agencies
were piggybacking
off the ghostnet network
so in publishing the report
we basically broke up
their party
from our initial samples from
the office of the dalai lama
they were actually compromised
by two distinct groups
the ghostnet group obviously
got the most attention
but there was another group
that was also active
the ghostnet group
shut down their operations
but the other group um
theyre still going
birds tweeting
tibetan horns

horns continue
gong rings

the vast majority of tibetans
inside of tibet use wechat
but it both
a blessing and a curse
woman speaking tibetan
golog
qq is chinese-made
wechat is chinese-made
all these social media apps
come from china
if someone in lhasa
or nagchu were to post a photo
of his holiness on wechat
they would be caught
immediately
in our research
what we see are acts of war
that take place
against citizens
using these very technologies
getting inside
the computers of tibetans
and then arresting them
and possibly executing them
is a kind of act of war
speaking tibetan
deibert
we see this sort of thing
every week right
minor to major versions of it
everything on the site
is correct except this
so this the last log-in on
the c panel was from korea
mm-hmmdo you guys have any work
in korea
is there anyno no
so who actually accesses
the website to update it
and all that sort of thing
it must be
someone unauthorizedyeah
bell ringing

for me tibet is a memory
it like a reoccurring dream
this photo is full of memories
if i close my eyes
i can see it all vividly
this is the hall where
we prayed and made offerings
on this side are
all of my classmates
this is one of my best friends
in english one two three
four five six
seven
in tibetan
i use these different phones to
contact tibetans inside tibet
i dont use my personal phone
im constantly switching
the number that i use
if you call too many times
from the same number
it will get blacklisted
then when they catch you using
a blacklisted number
theyll investigate
who calling
and who are they calling to
since 2008 ive kept contacts
in tibet so i can find out
what happening there
most of the news i receive
regards peoples suffering
for example
people being killed
arrested disappearing
children being separated
from their parents
when the parents of
a child are arrested
often the children are left
with no one to care for them
tibetan horn
horn continues
when somebody self-immolates
communicating
is even more dangerous
even though it makes me uneasy
i have to ask for details
if i dont get
the whole story out
it a great loss
horn resumes
this video was received by
a friend of mine through wechat
screaming

screaming continues
man shouts

indistincthmm
this video was aired
by bbc and al jazeera
a lot of news agencies aired it
it only a few seconds
but it proves that
many of the things weve been
reporting are a reality
and now it documented
you can google it

not that long ago
the government of pakistan
put out this tender
for proposals for a nationwide
internet filtering system
they wanted to solicit proposals
from companies to build
effectively
the great firewall of pakistan
today if you visit pakistan
and you get online
and you try to access youtube
this is what youll see
a blocked page like this
im in islamabad
putting in a sim card
first and foremost
im really excited
to see shahzad
i first met shahzad and
the organization bytes for all
eight years ago i think
and he been involved
in one way or another
in citizen lab research
ever since
mouse clicks
chattering
-hi shahzad
-hello
so great to see youhere we are
here we are
both chuckling
deibert
bytes for all does what they do
fight for internet rights
and advocacy-based
approach to internet freedom
under extreme duress
so theyre operating
in a country that
specifically around media
and free expression
has got to be one of
the worst places in the world
uh journalists are
routinely kidnapped murdered
uh offices firebombed
et cetera
and theyve experienced
all of that
death threats
staff members kidnapped
his own son beat up and
thrown to the side of the road
as a warning to shahzad
not to do what he doing
in my opinion
internet has opened up
so many opportunities
for the people to express
and that is the sole reason
that we are fighting
for open internet
they lost their public spaces
they lost their ability
to go out freely
so as they are putting controls
and curbs on physical spaces
they are doing exactly the same
in online spaces as well
so precisely the reason
we are standing out there
to reclaim those spaces
and we have to at some point
and well continue to do that
oh my god sighs
the government has the ability
to ban specific pages
speaking foreign language
in english
you ban all of facebook
businesses are suffering
people communicate
i mean you can
laugh and joke and say
for a few days people
wont play farmville
but it not about that
it about your fundamental
rights being snatched from you
and no government
in my opinion should have
the ability to do that
woman right
not only that they banned
wikipedia for a little while
-yes mm-hmm
-youtube
uh about several thousand
websites were affected
i think the internet is
this vast unregulated
wonderful democratizing space
and no matter what anyone does
people will find a way

hi im sabeen mahmud

a non-profit organization
ive always believed
that technology is
always the driver of change
not business not government

and gender-based violence
has always existed
but with the advent
of the internet and the number
of social networking tools
i think it
a great mobilization platform

her mother who was also
accompanying her was wounded

mahmud was taken to a hospital
where she was pronounced dead
sitar music continues
inaudible
when she spoke
in physical spaces
nothing happened
when she was
carrying on her campaign
she was not targeted
people were amused or they
ignored her
or they just walked past
but when this whole sort of
campaign
hit the internet
and the social media
that when
the lynch mobs gathered
and one of
the reasons i find is
that speech
in a physical space lasts
only as long as youre speaking
but once it is uploaded onto
the internet on any platform
it is there forever
and then your attackers or
you know whoever opposes you
they gather
and then they spread it further
and more and more
people join that group
of people who are attacking and
it takes on a life of its own

a demographic revolution
the center of gravity

the vast majority of internet

with midia ninja
and we went to the streets
and tried to do live streaming
there was a mobile station
with an electric generator
using gasoline you know
a 4g modem a laptop
a camera a video switcher and--

-synthesized music
it was impossible to
push a 00-pound cart

silva it was good
in the first two or three times
in more calm demonstrations
i remember
there was a discussion
and then carioca said
no i found an app
its name is twitcasting
and maybe we can try it
electropop
it was a japanese free app
used by teenagers to hang out
you know
in portuguese
it was a low-quality image
but it could be transmitted
nonstop
that why twitcasting
was perfect
chantingspeaks portuguese
it a very delicate moment here
in the saens peña square
people being prohibited
from walking to
or to leave the square
this image we are seeing here
a corridor of police
encircling the protest
singing in portugueseindistinct
looking at brazil
this is one of those cases
where you have
a sporting event in this case
which triggers all sorts of
extra concern around security
and the control of information
much of it legitimate
but what often happens is that
the layering of surveillance
extra-legal measures that
happens leading up to
and during these events
doesnt just disappear
it becomes part of
the permanent architecture
chanting in portuguese
can you tell me
what this is
no i cantwhy not
it transmits live video

mobile phones are prevalent
everyone has one in their hands
and the police
now use a technique
where they set up fake
cell phone towers that captures
everyone within the vicinity
and gathers up
identifying information that
emitted by the cell phones
which they then
use to track people
and associate them
with each other
and being at specific
physical events like a protest
and the government
can go back in time
and recreate
every facet of your life
on that particular day and hour
with whom
you were communicating
not only
what youre broadcasting
but what youre saying privately
and use this to incriminate you
down the road
in portuguese
nineteen people accused
of planning acts of vandalism
were arrested today in rio
woman it was just dawn
when 30 police left to serve search and seizure warrants in rio
they confiscated computers cell phones
gas masks and one piece of wood with nails and other objects
inside the police station here
there a new operational unit
which is
the internet crimes unit
they attempt to transform
our youth who want to see
a different country
into a gang
of marginalized criminals
surveillance of the internet
mobile phones
manipulation of evidence
they are monitored
phone-tapped and followed
including the ninjas
you can be sure their phones
are all tapped
that includes us as well
this surveillance
this espionage
this paranoia
that been imposed
people realize there
some hidden mechanism of power
going on through surveillance
and you begin to suspect maybe
this device you cant trust
maybe the state in here
or it in my mobile phone or
and as that kind of
seeps out there
people become much more
unwilling to take risks
you know even in our own work
were much more cautious
about what we say over e-mail
worried that
somebody listening and so on
it like sand in the machinery
it kind of slows things down
and everything becomes
much more complicated
just to communicate
basic instructions
youre like oh
first i have to encrypt it
all these technologies too
cryptography things
they might be getting cheap
but if we consider
in terms of time
they are expensive
you know
people are being murdered
every day in the favelas
the military police
are still running
so it complicated now
to stop the machines
and adapt our system
to a more safe mode
crowd booing
in portuguese these days
the media can police more
than the police themselves
by reproducing this idea
of the protester as enemy
the truth is tough to swallow
globo supported
the dictatorship
bentes history of o globo
started during
the military dictatorship
it was the media arm
of the dictatorship
and they think
theyre as powerful
as the government
we say if you hate the media
then become the media
oh my oh  ill go for what you know
who i owe  why own when you can just
sell it
in portuguese
weve just had many bombs
explode
there were many aggressions
we just witnessed
many rubber bullets shot
one on top of the other
as soon as the bomb exploded
the arbitrariness commenced
the physical aggressions
during searches
no one is being aggressive
no you are talking smack

physically aggressive here

youve already unleashed
such a shitload of violence

whoa dont take me
whoa brother
what going on
theyre arresting me
theyre kicking me
theyre kicking me
theyre crushing my phone
what is this
i was just attacked by
eight of you ten of you
big armed men in uniform
i didnt do anything wrong
to any of you
i am transmitting live
on the internet
with a cell phone
this is not
any kind of violence
this is not a crime
this is a constitutional right
of the citizen
the military police here in rio
are a disgrace
crowd applauding
deibert
so at the same time
that you have so many people
able to communicate to
a global audience at an instant
governments in ways that
they werent 20 years ago
are really ramping up
information controls
because they see
and when we say governments
were really talking about
entrenched powers
institutionalized uh you know
forms of capitalism in the state
that see you know
this type of
unpredictable citizen activism
as a threat to their interests
and are developing ways
to counter it
announcer you have new challenges today
sensitive data is transmitted over encrypted channels
you need more
you want to look through your target eyes
you have to hack your target
you have to overcome encryption and capture relevant data
being stealth and untraceable
exactly what we do
the vendors of
these products and services
market them to governments
usually at trade shows
that are only open
to accredited law enforcement
and intelligence agencies
actually ive got
a big binder that i can
so if you ignore the bag
actually which
chuckling
someone uh deposited
these in as a gift to me
but i think
was hoping to disguise it
in the kindergarten bag
these are brochures
from the type of trade shows
that were talking about
products and services that allow
cell phone detection
uh insertion of malware
tracking
social media monitoring
in many ways the way to
think about this market
is that it
the commercialization
of cyber crime
you trick somebody into
installing a software program
that contains malicious code
that exploits some vulnerability
in the system
which then allows the attacker
to do anything they want
turn on the webcam
listen in on the microphone
record keystrokes
record the location
the movement
it operates without
much accountability
certainly no corporate
social responsibility
ripe for abuse in a place
like sudan or ethiopia
weve seen in one
case after another
how this ends up being used
to target civil society
aha
gamma group
maker of the notorious
finfisher spyware
cars honking
the whole history
my personal history
my family history
and my organization history
is written with surveillance
in ethiopia
there is only one server
every telecommunication
connection
passes through
the ethiopian
telecommunications server
and that server is
highly controlled
when you talk to a friend
you know that somebody
is hearing
when you write an e-mail
you suspect that somebody
might have read it
and that somebody
wants to hunt you down
and when i came to the uk
there was a total liberation
of that stress
i felt
i am living in a free country
where the privacy of individuals
is respected
and my privacy is
also respected
but i was wrong
sometime in 203
we started to find
some of the things that we
discussed among a small circle
in open media
and in unfriendly medias
of the ethiopian government
you dont want to
suspect your friend
but you have to
and we keep on wondering
how they could find out
we got the answer
from a totally unexpected area
a certain group of people
goes to citizen lab
and they published a report
and in that report
there was my photograph
and they used it
to attach with the spyware
and distribute it
among the ethiopian community
the attacker has to socially
engineer or convince the target
to open a file or to
you know click through
some security warning
um in order to become infected
we had found a document
that had pictures of ethiopian
opposition leaders in it
and it looked like
it was targeted
and designed to appeal
to members of
the ethiopian diaspora
uh but in fact
the file was cleverly disguised
to look like a document
that actually
a computer program
an executable file
so when you run this
it will install software
on your computer
even though you know they
changed the icon and everything
to make it look like
this is a document
or a picture
this is actually a program
after that
i just tried to scan
people who were arrested
after my departure
i had a friend in saudi arabia
who was sent back to ethiopia
and arrested and
sentenced to 8 years
and i started to question
probably it was because of me
and he not the only person
i was able to look at the memory
of an infected computer
in other words
what going on inside
the computer when it infected
and i was able to identify
several interesting artifacts
in the memory
including a bunch of strings
that said finfisher finspy
very clearly attributing this
to the company
ethiopia is
one of the poorest countries
in the world
internet users in ethiopia
are less than two percent
it is the lowest in the world
but they spend
millions of dollars
for finfisher
for spying on people like me
who are trying to do
to bring a better future
to ethiopia
you dont have to be the nsa to
get inside somebody computer
um instead you can
exploit their curiosity
their um need to communicate
and of course
journalists at the very heart
of what they do
is engage in communication
with a lot of people
and a lot of people that
they dont know and trust
necessarily
because theyre engaged
in outreach and communicating
constantly with sources
crowd shouting
cheering whistling
fifty years ago
nobody would have known
what happened in syria
but in 20 when it started
everybody had facebook
everybody has e-mails
and everybody has whatsapp
and viber
so you just cant stop people
from telling
what is happening to them
so when they besieged daraa
at the beginning
they shut down communication
internet land lines
and even electricity
but they did not know that
in the 2st century
people have their ways
people were charging
their mobiles from their cars
or generators
hand generators
um manual generators
and people were using
satellite connections
you dont need to use
the country uh internet
to be connected to the internet
you can use anything
and they were able to tell
what was happening to them
um so the story got around
man speaking foreign language
sirens blaring
a few years ago many of us
celebrated the arab spring
as the paradigm of what
these technologies could do
remember
we called it at the time
liberation technology
it would bring about the end
of authoritarian rule
man speaking arabic
unfortunately
syria has become the
arab spring dark aftermath
explosion
boy shouting in arabic
as groups
sympathetic to the assad regime
have employed
off-the-shelf malware crime kits
to infiltrate social networks
arrest torture and
murder opposition groups
and even target
their air strikes
rifles cocking
shouting
gunshot
man from the beginning
we believed that the camera
is the most powerful weapon
and it was actually
the only weapon we have
to deliver our own message
to the whole world
this is interesting
baraa
speaking arabic
it a pleasure for me
to introduce
one of my best friends
mr baraa
he one of the most activist
people inside syria
he came a few days ago
cause he has
he has many broken
bones on his body
gunfire
he was there and covered
the battle in daraa city
and in the afternoon
they get a tank shell
explosion
he was with his friend
whom has this camera
and that good guy you know
he gets killed
by one tank shell
from the regime side
gunfire
this video you will see now
a remote control car and
it exploded a huge explosion
it was filmed
by this camera
explosion
after that
the rocket launchers
started to hit the place
from the regime side
so our activist this media guy
he gets killed in here
in this exact this place
now here
he was standing here
and people found
the camera with him
we took out the memory card
and we post this
as you know
in memory of hussain
wreckage clattering
so now mr baraa here
just a few days just to heal
he paid a visit
to some hospitals
to check out himself
then he will go back into syria
to keep working
there is a war on facebook
uh every side is using facebook
to promote themselves
they say on facebook
that the army now controls
a certain area
so the rebels all go to that
certain area even though
it still rebel-controlled
they start bombing it even
though it under their control
then they withdraw from it
the other way around
the regime will say
we will occupy this area
we will take over this area
then the fsa would leave because
theyre afraid of bombardment
it just a game
facebook is a game
wjd
it was just a silly joke i made
i didnt hurt anybody
i didnt insult anyone
it was not political
it was not racist
there is nothing
that they could hold against me
with a thing that
i wrote on facebook
but still
at a time of war
people get crazy
they did not drag me
in the street or kidnap me
they just asked me to come
to ask me a few questions
this is what they said
so i signed the paper
that im coming
i went
the next morning at 30
to the detention center
the security guy came to me
he like
he like half of my height
he blindfolded me
and i was like
i was okay with that
because i thought it some
it confidential secrets
of the country
that they dont want me to see
and then i was presented
to the detective
or the interrogator
i never saw him
he told me
youre a computer engineer
please be seated
and i sat next to him
and he started reading
all my facebook posts
i was like oh
one of the posts
that i wrote was
no praying no fasting
until the regime falls
which was actually
making fun of both sides
and i laughed and he like
im not kidding with you
im not joking with you
he kicked me on my chest
and then he requested
the same short guy
because he was
there in the room
to bring something called
the flying carpet
which is a torturing machine
it a wooden board
like the door
but it has joints in the middle
that can flip
and i had to lay on it
they tied my wrists and
they tied me from the middle
they tied my legs
and they just closed it
so my knees touched my chest
he took off my shoes
and my socks
and started beating me
with a metal
uh with a metal whip
the pain is unbelievable
you just cant take it anymore
you just cant endure
this amount of agony
what we saw in syria
was a lot of use of say
off-the-shelf remote access
tools
so this is sort of software
that you can get from
underground message boards
or maybe purchased
for not so much money
maybe $200-300 that
give you the ability
to record someone keystrokes
read their e-mails
even look at them
through their webcam
record via
the computer microphone
conversations that are being had
around the target computer
frequently what you would see
is it would be bundled
with some type of lured document
which showed
a deep understanding
of the psychology of the people
they were trying to target
for instance one of
the documents that was sent out
that i keenly recall
was a list
a purported list
of insurgents identified
by the syrian government
so of course what happened was
that this was promptly passed
around
to all sorts of very
interesting groups in syria
because everyone wanted to know
if they were on this list
or not
so the actual spyware
payload itself wasnt
particularly sophisticated
but the social
the social
and social engineering side
of that operation
um was quite smart
internet entered almost
all countries in the region
before it entered syria
yes
government in syria
we are not as developed
as canada for example
or not as developed
as united states
in canada
they can monitor people
and control people
and spy people in
a very intelligent way
and even they dont
feel that they are
spied on
but in syria
of course you go to old ways
they untie me and then i was
and then he asked me to
sit next to him and he said
let start talking
and i told him
i dont want to
talk to you anymore
he said i want you
to admit you work with the free
syrian electronic army
i was like
i dont know what that is
he said you like their page
you like their page
on facebook
i told him
i like their page on facebook
but there are too many pages
on facebook that you can like
i also like assad page
on facebook
well that did not convince him
so his boss came
and he told him
what is going on
he told him
this is the facebook guy
and he not cooperating
so then his boss told him to
send him down to the basement
peel his skin off and just
remind me of him after a month
and i was like can we go
back to the flying carpet
chuckles
i stayed there
for almost a month
and then i was released
with a presidential amnesty
so i went in a taxi
covered with dust
dirt shit and blood
all over my face
my clothes
and then the taxi driver
felt pity for me
and he gave me a cigarette
i remember
that was the first time i cried
and i went to my flat in latakia
where i used to study
and my roommates
were shocked
to see me alive
and then like
two weeks after that
i fled the country
i came to jordan
i am a journalist now
man with syria
a lot of the bad things
that are happening
are happening to people
who dont look
like westerners
the bad things happening to
these people through technology
through the risks
inherent in technology
are not different
than the kinds of risks
that we may face
um although they look
different
we see in the news
almost every day
a report of a breach
some kind of a large hack
data being exploited somewhere
it the same problem
but in syria
it looks very different
and because there are
dark skinned people
uh and there are guns
and a foreign language
it feels i think to many
exotic and different
and it couldnt happen here
and i think in fact
what youre seeing in syria
is this is what happens
when the risks get higher
but the technology is the same
theyre using the same facebook
that we are
chattering
in portuguese
my name is bruno
for those who dont know me
man beat boxing
id been attending protests
for a month
a month full of protests
it good to have protection
in case police repression
is very strong
when the professor asked
the class what they thought
people were
against the protestors
i improvised a chest protector
with aluminum
i said whoa you didnt
even go to the protests
it not like you describe it
so i decided to make a video
to document a protest
for those who didnt attend
chattering
im arriving now
at largo do machado
woman shouting in portuguese
lot of different people here
singing in foreign language
shouting on microphone
man shouting in portuguese
they have shut down
all the lights
to intimidate the crowd
but were not going to leave
only when the people become one
and not two peoples
where the rich
use the poor against the poor
because we are strong
we are not weak

news intro
in portuguese
the protest took place
outside
the governor palace
it started peacefully
but ended in confrontation
man a battle began on one side rocks being thrown
on the other side rubber bullets
the masked bandits threw molotov cocktails at the police
one policeman was hit by the fire
the military police found a bag with molotov cocktails
-police officer
you should film this
-reporter what is it
molotov cocktails

i wasnt even there
i wasnt carrying a backpack
someone attacked me

my friend
sirens wailing
shouting

lots of people were there
by 700 in the night
and we were live
carioca we are here
transmitting live to 5000
viewers with a mobile phone
silva
suddenly a man came to carioca
and he asked to interview him
carioca
whoa can i speak here
what is this
silva and then
the military police came
to carioca searched his bag
and then they said
he should be taken to jail
as a preventive arrestment
to be searched and inquired
carioca
theyre taking me away
i dont have anything in my bag
how this information
was being virilized
was really amazing
like sharing sharing sharing
tweets tweets tweets
mention mention mention
the ninja is being arrested
and suddenly there was
like a small crowd
like 5000 people
and all of them was
screaming together
in portuguese
hey police
where is the midia ninja
chanting hey police
where is the midia ninja
at the police station
there were some lawyers
to help us some activists
that where i met bruno teles
man speaking in portuguese
woman speaking portuguese
-what your name
-my name is
bruno ferreira teles
teles
the midia ninjas appeared
right when i needed to speak
they gave me a voice
they asked me if i wanted
to give them an interview
i said i want to i need to
as we interviewed bruno
globo broadcast that
he threw the molotov
and had been arrested
it was bruno ferreira
who was caught with a backpack
full of molotov cocktails
the police officer who was hit
with the molotov cocktail
suffered burns to the thorax
the big media in general
were all against me
they associated me
with vandalism
with violence
shouting
i want to ask you
to help me to find the video
of the moment
where i ran from police
they took me in
and they are saying
i was there with bottles
of molotov cocktails
and i was not
that all im asking
that you search out these videos
and collaborate
silva in english
then we posted this video from
the mobile like real time
and it virilized very fast
carioca in portuguese
our in-box exploded
5000 e-mails in 24 hours
a ton of images and video
that showed bruno innocence
glass shattering
vocalizing
video sound distorted
vocalizing continues
glass shattering
woman what is this people
this is surreal
woman vocalizing

shouting
music distorting
gunshot muffled
electrical crackling
crackling continues
the video was just getting
bigger in the social media
bruno teles became a character
crowd shouting
within a day
globo reversed their position
they said i was a student
a good kid
everyone likes him
contrary to information
released by the military
and civil police
the student bruno teles
did not possess explosives
at the time of his arrest
silva they said
that bruno was innocent
and they used midia ninja image
and they credited midia ninja
it was the first
time that we were seeing
globo recognizing
a free media collective
as a legitimate player
in the communication game
it was a next step
crowd shouting

orlando
this is an old strategy
when police infiltrate groups
and appear as activists
they legitimize
the police violence
explosion
for the population
if the protestors
are launching explosions
the police must do
whatever is necessary
even on the margins of the law
bentes
the best form of security today
is to live stream everything
if everyone knows where you are
then youre safe
the french word surveillance
implies watching from above
in this case sub-veillance
is more accurate
bottom-up the crowd
surveils from all angles
crowd chanting in portuguese
hey undercover cops
go fuck yourself
are you an undercover copim a protestor idiot
shouting continues
crowd booing
it took only
the time for the video
to circulate online and on tv
then habeas corpus was filed
and he was released
woman bruno come here
woman crying

what if we didnt have
these images
shouting
how many others
dont have the good fortune
of being filmed

ive always been a fan
of the terms hacking
and hacktivism
especially hacktivism
which is the combination of
hacking and political activism
and those combined
are pretty powerful to me
it about encouraging people
not to accept technology
at face value
we need to encourage people
to think about
what it is that surrounds them
to question authority
in a sense of the authority
being the technological
environment around them
and to realize that
when you start pulling back
the layers of all of this
that where
the exercise of power is
so if we want liberal democracy
to flourish
we need people
to start lifting back the layers
and understanding
what going on
clicking
snowden i think ultimately
it comes down to understanding
what your values are
because how do you
develop your thoughts right
how do you determine
what it is that
you truly believe
how do you determine what
it is you really want to say
if you cant even
keep notes safely
if you cant
have some private space
some space for thought
some space to enjoy the product
of your own intellect
to share that with people
close to you who you trust
whether theyre family
whether theyre colleagues
whether theyre compatriots
deibert one thing
that i see a lot is this idea
of technology as a solution
it a natural thing
okay technology
is under threat
let find
a technological solution
there are so many projects now
around secure communications
platforms chats
instant messaging
but it only one component
of a solution set
and i think often overlooked
are the legal and political
dimensions
if were talking about
protecting and preserving
all of this
as a secure and open
communication space
that means holding governments
accountable
it means holding
companies accountable
putting in place rules and laws
that ensures they cant
do things that infringe
on our freedoms and rights
that to me is uh
such a critical foundation
of a digital democracy today
