basically
you know my boss isnt aware
that i understand yoruba
mm-hmm
the other day
i overheard a phone conversation
and i kept hearing
pa meta pa meta pa meta
and i know it means three
i believe i heard there were three people
in that car sir
stop crying stop
i know youre only doing your job dpo
im still in shock
that he accused me of killing his son
that i practically raised
ask this foolish man
who brought him to lagos
does it matter does it matter
imagine
hmm
do you call that an achievement huh
imagine
somebody brought you
somebody brought you
people will continue
to bring other people
so dont make a mountain
out of a molehill
he who lives by the sword
will die by the sword
i will embarrass you
you will see
ill discredit you beyond imagination
this wont end here
chief please stay out of this for now
you will see
continue
what do i stand to gain from killing mike
mm-hmm
were you aware there were
three of them in the car that day
yes i did
how frequently did you speak to mike
what has that got to do with this
what im asking is
when last did you speak to mike
the day of the incident
and what did you speak about
he was asking about my welfare
he was asking me how i was faring
were you sick
do you need to be sick
before youre asked about your welfare
how you are faring
did he say he was going to the tailor
yes he did
and you knew he was in the car
with his fiancée and her friend
you obviously have
prior information about this situation
could that be what you heard
from my secretary
shouldnt we take it seriously
you called for them
to kill the three of them
nonsense
mm
arrant nonsense
how could someone who is reasonable
somebody who is sensible
could have believed that
well i was hoping youd tell us
what happened was there was this sacrifice
i needed to do
i instructed my son
to kill all the three rams
that was what happened
he who lives by the sword
will die by the sword
no longer human beings but rams now
he who lives by the sword
will die by the sword
yes
i get it you want the devil
ill show you the devil
youll see this case is going further
youll see my wrath
sir this ram isnt big
it not as big as the other one
this one bigger
this one is bigger
also this one is older
cant you see this one
what did the boss say
he instructed us to kill the three rams
how can we kill all three
confirm it
hello sir
sir did you say we should kill all three
all right okay sorry sir
all right sir all right sir
mallam come quick
and that was exactly what happened
okay i suggest you dont leave town
because well need you
for further questioning

i know nothing about it
really adunni really
after everything
i left my family i left my fiancé
everything back in ghana
just to come here to be with you
and you would think that i would do
something as cruel as killing

the conversation you had over the phone
i was--
i was only rebuking my sister efia
i was on the phone talking to efia
i suspected my fiancé of cheating on me
