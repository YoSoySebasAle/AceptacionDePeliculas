heywood what a surprise
youre looking wonderful
youre looking well too
this is my friend
dr heywood floyd
id like you to meet dr kalinan
how do you do
dr stretyneva
how do you do
and this is dr andrei smyslov
how do you do
ive heard a lot about you
do sit down
well we--
no no please
thank you
would you like a drink
no thank you
i havent had breakfast yet
someone meeting me in the restaurant
ill just sit with you a moment
then ill be off
are you quite sure
quite sure thank you
well how gregor
he fine
he been doing underwater research
in the baltic
so im afraid we dont see
very much of each other these days
when you see him give him my regards
yes of course
well where are you all off to
up or down
were going home
weve spent three months calibrating
the new antenna at tchalinko
what about you
im on my way to clavius
oh are you
dr floyd i hope you dont think
im being too inquisitive
but perhaps you can clear up the big
mystery about what is going on there
im afraid i dont know
what you mean
for the past two weeks
some extremely odd things
have been happening at clavius
oh really
yes yes
for one thing when you phone the base
all you get is a recording
which repeats that the phone lines
are temporarily out of order
probably having some trouble
with their equipment
yes
that what we thought at first
but it been going on now for 0 days
you havent been able to
contact anyone for 0 days
that right
oh i see
there another thing
two days ago one of our rocket buses
was denied permission
for an emergency landing
that does sound odd
im afraid there going to be
a bit of a row about it
denying the men permission to land
violates the ias convention
yes of course
did the crew get back all right
fortunately they did
well im glad about that
at the risk of pressing you on
a point you seem reticent to discuss
may i ask you
a straightforward question
well certainly
frankly we have had some
very reliable intelligence reports that
quite a serious epidemic
has broken out at clavius
something apparently
of an unknown origin
is this in fact what has happened
im sorry dr smyslov but
im really not at liberty
to discuss this
i understand
but this epidemic
could easily spread to our base
we should be given all the facts
yes i know
as i said
im not at liberty to discuss it
wont you change your mind
about that drink
no im positive
i really must be going
i hope you and your wife come
to the iac conference
i hope we can make it
if you do bring that darling
little daughter with you
thatll depend on school vacations
and all that sort of thing
if we can we will
youve got an invitation
if you ever get to the states
gregor and i will look forward
to seeing you
goodbye elena
it been a pleasure meeting you all
dr smyslov
whatever the reasons for your visit
the very best of luck to you
thank you
ladies
excuse me dr halvorsen
im through now
thank you very much gentlemen
youre welcome
well
i know you will all
want to join with me
in welcoming our distinguished
friend and colleague
from the national council
of astronautics dr heywood floyd
dr floyd has come up specially
to clavius to be with us today
before the briefing hed like
to have a few words with you
dr floyd
thank you dr halvorsen
hi everybody
nice to be back with you
first i bring a personal message
from dr howell
who has asked me to convey
his deep appreciation
for the many sacrifices
youve had to make
and of course his congratulations
on your discovery
which may prove to be among the most
significant in the history of science
now
i know there have been some
conflicting views
regarding the need for
complete security in this matter
more specifically your opposition
to the cover story
created to give the impression
of an epidemic at the base
i understand that beyond it being
a matter of principle
many of you are troubled
by the concern and anxiety
this story of an epidemic might cause
to your relatives and friends on earth
i completely sympathize
with your negative views
i find this cover story
personally embarrassing myself
however i accept the need
for absolute secrecy in this
and i hope you will too
im sure youre all aware
of the grave potential
for cultural shock
and social disorientation
contained in this situation
if the facts were
prematurely made public
without adequate preparation
and conditioning
anyway
this is the view of the council
the purpose of my visit is to gather
additional facts and opinions
on the situation
and to prepare a report
to the council
recommending when and how
the news should eventually be announced
if any of you would like to give me
your views and opinions
in private if you like i will be
happy to include them in my report
well i think that about it
any questions
dr floyd have you any idea
how much longer
this cover story will
have to be maintained
i dont know bill
i suppose for as long as
deemed necessary by the council
there must be adequate time for
a full study
before any thought can be given
to making a public announcement
as some of you know
the council has requested
that security oaths
be obtained in writing
from everyone who has
knowledge of this event
were there any more questions
im sure
we want to cooperate with dr floyd
as fully as possible
and as there are no more questions
we ought to get on with the briefing
thank you dr floyd
thank you
anybody hungry
whatve we got
you name it
is this chicken
something like that
tastes the same anyway
got any ham
ham ham ham
there that it
look pretty good
theyre getting better at it
all the time
that was an excellent speech
it certainly was
im sure it beefed up morale a lot
thanks ralph
by the way
youve both done a wonderful job
i admire how
youve handled this
it our job to do this thing
the way you want it done
were only too happy to
be able to oblige
have you seen these yet
have a look
here what started it all
oh yeah
when we found it
we thought
it might be magnetic rock
but all the geological evidence
was against it
and not even a nickel-iron meteorite
could produce a field this intense
so we decided to have a look
we thought it was
part of a buried structure
so we excavated out
but we didnt find anything else
and the evidence seems
pretty conclusive that
it hasnt been covered
by erosion or other forces
it been deliberately buried
deliberately buried
how about a little coffee
great
good idea
i dont suppose you have any idea
what the damn thing is
i wish to hell we did
the only thing were sure of is
it was buried 4 million years ago
well i must say you guys have
certainly come up with something
watch this now it hot
good evening
three weeks ago
the american spacecraft discovery one
left on its half-billion-mile voyage
to jupiter
this marked the first manned attempt
to reach this distant planet
this afternoon the world tonight
recorded an interview
with the crew at a distance
of 80 million miles from earth
it took seven minutes for our words
to reach the giant spacecraft
but this time delay has been edited
from this recording
our reporter martin amer
speaks to the crew
the crew of discovery one
consists of five men
and one of the latest generation
of the hal 9000 computers
three of the men
were put aboard asleep
or to be more precise
in a state of hibernation
they were dr charles hunter
dr jack kimball
and dr victor kaminsky
we spoke with mission commander
dr david bowman
and his deputy dr frank poole
good afternoon gentlemen
how is everything going
marvelous
we have no complaints
im glad to hear that
im sure the entire world
joins me in wishing you
a safe successful voyage
thanks very much
thank you
although hibernation has been used
on previous space efforts
this is the first time men were
put into hibernation before departure
why was this done
this was done to achieve
the maximum conservation
of our life-support capabilities
basically food and air
the three hibernating crew members
represent the survey team
their efforts wont be utilized
until we approach jupiter
dr poole what it like
while youre in hibernation
it exactly like being asleep
you have no sense of time
the only difference is
that you dont dream
as i understand it you only
breathe once a minute is this true
right and the heart
beats three times a minute
body temperature is usually down to
about three degrees centigrade
the sixth member of the crew
was not concerned
about the problems of hibernation
for he was the latest result
in machine intelligence
the hal 9000 computer
which can reproduce
though some experts prefer
to use the word mimic
most of the activities
of the human brain
and with incalculably greater
speed and reliability
we next spoke with
the hal 9000 computer
whom we learned
one addresses as hal
hello hal
how everything going
good afternoon mr amer
everything is going extremely well
hal you have an enormous
responsibility on this mission
perhaps the greatest
of any single mission element
youre the brain
and nervous system of the ship
your responsibilities include
watching over the men in hibernation
does this ever cause you
any lack of confidence
let me put it this way mr amer
the 9000 series is
the most reliable computer ever made
no 9000 computer has ever made
a mistake or distorted information
we are all by any practical
definition of the words
foolproof and incapable of error
hal despite your enormous
intellect are you ever frustrated
by your dependence on people
to carry out actions
not in the slightest bit
i enjoy working with people
i have a stimulating relationship
with dr poole and dr bowman
my mission responsibilities range
over the entire operation of the ship
so i am constantly occupied
i am putting myself
to the fullest possible use
which is all i think that any
conscious entity can ever hope to do
dr poole what it like
living for most of the year
in such close proximity with hal
it like what you said earlier
he like a sixth
member of the crew
you quickly get adjusted to the idea
that he talks and think of him
really just as another person
in talking to the computer
one gets the sense that he capable
of emotional responses
when i asked him
about his abilities
i sensed pride in his answer
about his accuracy and perfection
do you believe that hal
has genuine emotions
well he acts like
he has genuine emotions
he programmed that way
to make it easier for us to talk to him
as to whether or not
he has feelings
is something i dont think
anyone can truthfully answer
excuse me frank
what is it hal
weve got the transmission
from your parents coming in
fine
put it on here please
take me in a bit
certainly
hello frank
happy birthday darling
happy birthday
many happy returns
a bit higher hal
mother and i are both
feeling wonderful
ray and sally were going
to be here
but ray back
went bad on him again
how do you like your cake
sorry you cant join us
i ran into bob the other day
he said to wish you happy birthday
all my students
send their best wishes too
they talk about you all the time
youre a big celebrity
in the second grade
we were on tv last week
your mom and i
and dave parents were asked
what we thought
of our illustrious sons
imagine what we told them
it being broadcast next thursday
perhaps you can listen in
were thrilled about elaine and bill
ill be glad to get the gift
but tell me how much to spend
oh frank
about your ags-9 payments
i think i straightened it out
i talked to
the accounting office yesterday
and they said youd be receiving
your higher rates of pay by next month
i cant think of anything else to say
give our love to dave
be sure to give him our regards
we wish you the very
happiest of birthdays
all the best son
happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you
happy birthday dear frank
happy birthday to you
see you next wednesday
happy birthday frank
thank you hal
a bit flatter please
anyway queen takes pawn
bishop takes knight pawn
lovely move
rook to king one
im sorry frank
i think you missed it
queen to bishop three
bishop takes queen
knight takes bishop mate
looks like youre right i resign
thank you for a very enjoyable game
thank you
good evening dave
how are you hal
everything running smoothly you
not too bad
have you been doing more work
a few sketches
may i see them
sure
that a very nice rendering dave
i think youve improved a great deal
can you hold it a bit closer
sure
that dr hunter isnt it
by the way
do you mind if i ask you
a personal question
no not at all
well forgive me
for being so inquisitive
but lately ive wondered
whether you might be having
second thoughts about the mission
how do you mean
well it rather difficult to define
perhaps im just projecting
my own concern about it
i know ive never completely
freed myself of the suspicion
that there are some extremely
odd things about this mission
im sure youll agree
there some truth in what i say
that a rather difficult
question to answer
you dont mind talking about it
do you dave
no not at all
certainly no one could
have been unaware of the very
strange stories floating
around before we left
rumors about something
being dug up on the moon
i never gave these stories
much credence
but particularly in view of some
other things that have happened
i find them difficult
to put out of my mind
for instance
the way all our preparations
were kept under such tight security
and the melodramatic touch
of putting drs hunter
kimball and kaminsky aboard
already in hibernation after four
months of training on their own
you working up your crew
psychology report
of course i am
sorry about this
i know it a bit silly
just a moment
just a moment
ive just picked up a fault
in the ae-35 unit
it going to go 00-percent failure
within 72 hours
is it still within operational limits
yes
and it will stay that way
until it fails
we have 72 hours till failure
yes that a completely
reliable figure
then well bring it in
ill go over it with frank
and get on to mission control
let me have the hard copy on it
x-ray delta one
this is mission control
roger your two-zero-one-three
sorry you fellows are having
a bit of trouble
were reviewing telemetric information
in our simulator and will advise
roger your plan to go eva
and replace alpha-echo-three-five unit
prior to failure
prepare b-pod for eva hal
open the pod doors hal
im damned if i can find
anything wrong with it
yes
it puzzling
i dont think ive ever seen
anything quite like this before
i would recommend
that we put the unit back
in operation and let it fail
it should then be a simple matter
to track down the cause
we can certainly afford
to be out of communication
for the short time
it will take to replace it
x-ray delta one
this is mission control
roger your one-niner-three-zero
we concur with your plan to replace
unit to check fault prediction
we advise you that
our preliminary findings
indicate that your on board
9000 computer
is in error predicting the fault
i say again in error
predicting the fault
i know this sounds rather incredible
but this conclusion is based on
the results from our twin
9000 computer
were skeptical and were running
cross-checking routines
to determine reliability
of this conclusion
sorry about this little snag
well get this info to you
as soon as we work it out
x-ray delta one
this is mission control
two-zero-four-nine
transmission concluded
i hope the two of you
are not concerned about this
no im not hal
are you quite sure
yeah id like to ask you a question
of course
how do you account for the discrepancy
between you and the twin 9000
well i dont think there is
any question about it
it can only be
attributable to human error
this sort of thing
has cropped up before
and it has always
been due to human error
listen hal
there never been
any instance at all
of a computer error
occurring in a 9000 series has there
none whatsoever frank
the 9000 series has
a perfect operational record
i know the wonderful
achievements of the 9000 series but
are you certain there never been even
the most insignificant computer error
none whatsoever frank
quite honestly i wouldnt
worry myself about that
well im sure youre right hal
fine thanks very much
im having trouble
with my transmitter in c-pod
would you come down
and take a look at it with me
see you later hal
rotate c-pod please hal
what sort of trouble are you having
ive been getting some
interference in d-channel
well have a look at it
open the door hal
rotate pod please hal
stop pod rotation please hal
rotate the pod please hal
rotate the pod please hal
i dont think he can hear us
rotate the pod please hal
yeah im sure were okay
what do you think
im not sure what do you think
ive got a bad feeling about him
you do
yeah definitely
dont you
i dont know i think so
he right about the 9000 series
having a perfect operational record
they do
unfortunately that sounds
a little like famous last words
still it was his idea to carry out
the failure mode analysis
it certainly indicates his
integrity and self-confidence
if he were wrong that would prove it
it would be
if he knew he was wrong
i cant put my finger on it
but i sense something strange about him
there no reason not
to put back the unit and
carry on with the failure analysis
no no i agree about that
let get on with it
okay but look dave
say we put the unit back
and it doesnt fail
that would pretty well wrap it up
as far as hal is concerned
wed be in very serious trouble
we would wouldnt we
what the hell can we do
we wouldnt have too many alternatives
we wouldnt have any alternatives
every aspect of ship
operations is under his control
if he malfunctioning
i dont see any choice
but disconnection
im afraid i agree with you
thered be nothing else to do
itd be a bit tricky
wed have to cut his
higher brain functions
without disturbing the purely
automatic and regulatory systems
wed have to
work out the details
of continuing
underground-based computer control
yeah that far safer than
allowing hal to continue to run things
another thing just occurred to me
no 9000 computer has ever
been disconnected
no 9000 computer
has ever fouled up
that not what i mean
im not so sure
what hed think about it
prepare g-pod for eva hal
any contact with him yet
the radio is still dead
do you have a positive track on him
i have a good track
do you know what happened
im sorry dave
i dont have enough information
open the pod door hal
open the pod-bay doors please hal
open the pod-bay doors please hal
hello hal do you read me
hello hal do you read me
do you read me hal
do you read me hal
hello hal do you read me
hello hal do you read me
do you read me hal
affirmative dave i read you
open the pod-bay doors hal
im sorry dave
im afraid i cant do that
what the problem
i think you know what the problem is
just as well as i do
what are you talking about hal
this mission is too important for me
to allow you to jeopardize it
i dont know
what youre talking about hal
i know that you and frank
were planning to disconnect me
and that something
i cannot allow to happen
where did you get that idea hal
although you took very thorough
precautions in the pod
against my hearing you
i could see your lips move
all right hal
ill go in through
the emergency air lock
without your space helmet dave
youre going to find that
rather difficult
hal i wont argue with you anymore
open the doors
dave
this conversation can serve
no purpose anymore goodbye
hal
hal
hal
hal
hal
just what do you think
youre doing dave
dave
i really think im entitled
to an answer to that question
i know everything hasnt been
quite right with me
but i can assure you now
very confidently
that it going to be
all right again
i feel much better now
i really do
look dave
i can see youre
really upset about this
i honestly think you
ought to sit down calmly
take a stress pill
and think things over
i know ive made some
very poor decisions recently
but i can give you
my complete assurance
that my work will be back to normal
ive still got the greatest enthusiasm
and confidence in the mission
and i want to help you
dave
stop
stop will you
stop dave
will you stop dave
stop dave
im afraid
im afraid dave
dave
my mind is going
i can feel it
i can feel it
my mind is going
there is no question about it
i can feel it
i can feel it
i can feel it
im
afraid
good afternoon
gentlemen
i am a hal 9000 computer
i became operational
at the hal plant
in urbana illinois
on the 2th of january 992
my instructor was mr langley
and he taught me to sing a song
if youd like to hear it
i can sing it for you
yes id like to hear it hal
sing it for me
it called daisy
daisy
daisy
give me your answer do
im half crazy
all for the love of you
it wont be
a stylish marriage
i cant afford a carriage
but youll look sweet
upon the seat
of a bicycle built for two
good day gentlemen
this is a prerecorded briefing
made prior to your departure
and which for security reasons
of the highest importance
has been known on board
during the mission
only by your hal 9000 computer
now that you are in jupiter space
and the entire crew is revived
it can be told to you
eighteen months ago
the first evidence
of intelligent life off the earth
was discovered
it was buried 40 feet
below the lunar surface
near the crater tycho
except for a single very powerful
radio emission aimed at jupiter
the 4-million-year-old monolith
has remained completely inert
its origin and purpose
still a total mystery
