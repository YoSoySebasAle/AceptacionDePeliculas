
soon after its premiere
the film metropolis
was severely truncated
and alterations were made
from that time onward
more than a quarter of the film
was assumed to have been lost
then in 2008 a virtually complete
version of the film
was discovered in buenos aires
what had been preserved
was however a heavily damaged
copy of the film
that had been printed to 6mm
film stock
lacking the full frame
of the picture’s original aspect ratio
a considerable amount of the film
reconstruction was able to be completed
and the correct sequence
of its editing
established by means
of this argentinian material
spanish intertitles have been translated
into german
with the aid of the censor-cards
in order to display in their correct
position on the image
the cropped elements taken
from the 6mm negative
the missing portion of the frame
has been marked by black
the intertitles appear
with their original graphic treatment
those titles which appear in a different
typeface like the one used here
have been added to summarise
the content of still-missing scenes
as far as is necessary
to facilitate
an adequate understanding
of the storyline
shorter gaps are indicated
by small segments of black leader

epigraph
the mediator between head and hands
must be the heart
shift change
deep beneath
the earth lay the
city of the workers
as deep beneath the earth
as the city of the workers lay
so high above it towered the complex
known as the “sons’ club”
with its lecture halls and libraries
its theatres and stadiums
fathers for whom every revolution
of a mechanical wheel meant gold
had bestowed upon their sons
the wonder of the eternal gardens
which of you ladies shall today
have the honour of entertaining master freder
joh fredersen’s son
look these are your brothers
look —
these are your brothers
who — was that
but this was what happened to freder —
the son of joh fredersen
the master of metropolis —
as he sought out the girl
to the new tower of babel —
to my father —
why is it josaphat that i learn of this explosion
from my son and not from you —
details —
what were you looking for
in the machine-halls freder
i wanted to look into the faces of the people
whose little children are my brothers my sisters
your magnificent city father —
and you the brain of this city —
and all of us within the light of this city —
and where are the people father
whose hands built your city —
off where they belong
off where they belong
in the depths
and if those in the depths
one day rise against you
the chief foreman of the heart-machine grot —
with an important message
there were two more copies
of those damnable plans herr fredersen
in the pockets of two men who met
with an accident today at the m-machine
how is it josaphat that these plans
were brought to me by grot rather than by you
apply to the g-bank
for your remaining wages
father do you know what it means
to be dismissed by you —
it means to be sent below —
father — below into the depths —
do you know what it means to be dismissed
like that by joh fredersen
would you like to come with me
josaphat
go home josaphat and wait for me
i still have a long way to go tonight
into the depths —
to my brothers
from today on i wish to be kept precisely informed
of my son’s every move
brother
the machine there needs
to be someone at the machine
there will be someone at the machine
me
listen to me
i want to trade my life with you
josaphat
99th block house 7 7th floor
wait for me —
both of you
josaphat
99th block house 7 7th floor
josaphat
99th block house 7 7th floor
in the middle of metropolis
there stands a strange house
that the centuries had overlooked
the man who dwelled within
was rotwang the inventor
hel
born to bring me happiness
and a benediction to all mankind
lost to joh fredersen
died giving life to freder joh fredersen’s son
a mind like yours rotwang
should be able to forget
only one time in life did i forget something
that hel was a woman — and you a man
let the dead lie rotwang
she’s dead for you as she is for me
for me she isn’t dead joh fredersen —
for me she lives —
do you think the loss of a hand
is too high a price for recreating hel —
do you wish to see her —
now joh fredersen —
isn’t it worth losing a hand
to have created the man of the future —
the machine-man —
24 more hours of work —
and no man joh fredersen will be able
to differentiate the machine-man from a mortal —
the woman is mine joh fredersen
hel’s son was yours
and what brings you my way
joh fredersen
i need your advice —
as usual when all my experts fail me
can you decipher for me these plans
that for months have been getting discovered
in the pockets of my workers
at two once my shift ends
she has summoned us again
father —  father —
will ten hours never come to an end —
— it’s a blueprint
of the two-thousand-year-old catacombs
deep below the lowest levels
of your metropolis
i should like to glean what my workers
are doing exactly in those catacombs
today i shall tell you
the legend of the construction
of the tower of babel
the legend of the construction
of the tower of babel
come let us build a tower
whose zenith shall reach unto the stars
and at the tower’s zenith we shall write
great is the world and its maker
and great is man
but those who had conceived
of the tower of babel
could not build the tower of babel
the task was too great
so they paid wages to outside hands
but the hands that built the tower of babel
knew nothing of the dream
of which the head that had conceived it
had been fantasising
the hymns of praise of one man
became the curses of others
the same language was spoken
but these men did not understand one another
great is the world and its maker
and great is man
head and hands require a mediator
the mediator between head and hands
must be the heart
and where is our mediator
maria —
wait for him
he will surely come
we will wait maria
but not for much longer —
oh mediator
have you finally come
you summoned me —
here i am
rotwang give the machine-man
the likeness of this woman
i shall sow discord
between them and her
i shall destroy their belief
in this woman —
leave me alone now joh fredersen
you’ll find the way back without me
you fool now you shall also lose
the last remaining thing you still had from hel
your son
until tomorrow in the cathedral
end of the prelude
intermezzo
freder witnesses a monk at the pulpit
who preaches
“verily i say unto you the days
of which the apocalypse speaks draw nigh”
the monk’s hand points to the bible
in which it is written
“and i saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured
beast full of names of blasphemy
having seven heads and ten horns
and the woman was arrayed
in purple and scarlet colour
having a golden cup in her hand
and upon her forehead was a name
written a mystery
babylon the great the mother
of abominations of the earth
and i saw the woman drunken
with the blood of the saints”
you will annihilate joh fredersen —
him and his city and his son —
gluttony
avarice
pride
lust
envy
anger
sloth
had you come earlier
you wouldn’t have frightened me
i now beg of you stay away from me
and my beloved
where is the one whose clothes
you are wearing
josaphat
99th block house 7 7th floor
would you please wake georgy up
he must lead me
to the workers’ city at once
no 8 get back to the machine
and forget that you ever left it — understood
i have to have someone
who’s faithful to me josaphat —
otherwise how shall i attain the end-goal
of my path —
i must go on josaphat —
must now on my own
seek out the person to whom georgy
was supposed to lead me
tonight josaphat —
tonight when i come back
josaphat
99th block house 7 7th floor
so what price are you demanding
for leaving this residence tonight
you still don’t seem to have grasped
who sent me here
central bank of metropolis
this man doesn’t want his son
to find you still here tonight
in three hours’ time
i shall be calling for you
come it is time to give the man-machine
your face
where is maria —
she’s with your father
i’m telling you
she is with your father —
“she is the most perfect and most obedient tool
that a man has ever possessed
tonight you shall see how she holds up
before the eyes of the upper hundred
you shall see her dance and if only one single
person recognises the machine in her
i will call myself a bungler
who never succeeded at anything
c rotwang”
“c a rotwang requests herr joh fredersen
to be his guest this evening”
i want you to go to those in the depths
in order to annihilate the work of your prototype
“c a rotwang requests herr joh fredersen
to be his guest this evening”
verily i say unto you the days
of which the apocalypse speaks draw nigh
all seven deadly sins
on her behalf —
death overtakes the city —
end of the intermezzo
the revelation of st john
avalun publishing hellerau
i escaped from the thin man
wearing this attire
but for ten days your father’s bloodhound
has been making the workers’ city unsafe
the only thing keeping the workers in check
is their expectation for the mediator
promised unto them
even stranger things
have been happening freder
on that evening when you fell ill
once the best of friends
because of that woman
the other man
on that same evening
the eternal gardens lie abandoned
but night after night in yoshiwara
and this woman
at whose feet all sins are heaped
is also called maria
that same woman that those in the depths
regard as a saint —
many now go to the city of the dead
to a woman they have judged
to be as true as gold
the mediator is not likely
to miss that occasion
whatever happens tonight
it is my express order to allow the workers
to do as they please
joh fredersen wants to let those in the depths
use force and do wrong
so that he can claim the right
to use force against them
when you spoke to your poor brothers
you talked about peace maria
today a mouthpiece of joh fredersen
incites them to rebel against him
she will destroy their belief
in the mediator
you know i’ve always talked about peace
but your mediator hasn’t come
you’ve waited long enough
your time has come —
but i’ve tricked joh fredersen
your clone does not obey his will —
only mine alone
who is the living fodder
for the machines for metropolis —
who smears the machine-joints
with their own marrow —
who feeds the machines
with their own flesh —
let the machines starve you fools —
finish them off —
do them in —
these machines —
you aren’t maria —
you are not maria—
maria talks of peace not murder —
this is not maria —
joh fredersen’s son —
do him in the dog
in his white silken hide —
get your women your sons
out of the workers’ city
let no-one stay behind
death to the machines —
in the attic of his home
rotwang displays
for maria his ever-growing intoxication
with his triumph over fredersen
— and twice over did i trick joh fredersen —
for i concealed from him that his son
wants to be the mediator of your brothers —
and is in love with you —
maria isn’t the only one listening to rotwang
on the other side of the attic’s window
joh fredersen was eavesdropping
joh fredersen breaks into rotwang’s attic
he wrestles with his old rival and overtakes him
maria is free
faithful after all
come freder
we still have to go through the workers’ city
women and men
let no-one miss out on today —
death to the machines —
not one man —
not one woman has stayed behind —
leave the machines —
let them race to their death —
to the heart-machine —
danger
open the gates
you have to open the gates
if the heart-machine perishes
nothing in the machine-district
will be left standing —
have you lost your minds —
if the heart-machine perishes
the entire workers’ city will be laid to waste —
where are your fathers
your mothers
do you have any idea that your son
is amongst the workers
yes — you you’re maria —
to the air shafts — quickly quickly
the reservoirs have burst the city is drowning —
we’ll take the children
to the sons’ club
why are all the lights out
i need to know —
where is my son
tomorrow thousands
will ask in fury and desperation
joh fredersen
where is my son —
where are your children
the city is drowned
the shafts are totally flooded —
who bade you attack the machines
without which you’re finished you idiots —
it’s the witch’s fault — i
we’ll be looking on
as the world goes to the devil —
find the witch; this is all her fault —
strike her dead —
now i’m going to take you home
my hel —
the witch — the witch —
there she is — there she is —
where are our children
you witch you —
burn the witch —
to the stake with her
to the stake with her—
hel —  my hel —
your children saved —
head and hands want to join together
but they don’t have the heart to do it
oh mediator
show them the way to one another
the mediator between head and hands
must be the heart
