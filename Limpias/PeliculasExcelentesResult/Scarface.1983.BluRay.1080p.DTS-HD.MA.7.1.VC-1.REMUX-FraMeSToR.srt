so this and my other factory
i can guarantee production
of 200 kilos refined
every month of the year
the problem is
i have no steady market
basically what im looking for
is somebody in the states
who can share the risk with me
somebody who can guarantee
to buy from me say
50 kilos a month
oh that a big commitment mr sosa
something like that
too bad frank not here
you should talk to him
it wouldve been nice if hed come
he would like to come
but with his trial coming up
it hard to leave the country
so he sent you instead
something like that
well talk at my house shall we
you got good stuff here
class-a shit
this lopez guarantees
to buy 50 kilos from me
every month of the year
he picks it up here
i can sell it to him
for as little as
7000 a key
you cant do better than that
but then we got to take
the risk of moving it
well be cutting out the colombians
know what that means
that means we have to
go to war with them
we cut out the colombians
we take risks on both sides
why dont we split the risk
you guarantee your delivery say
as far as panama
we take it from there
panama is risky
it costs me more
panama i can sell for 35 a key
what are you nuts
35 we still got to
take that shit to florida
do you know what
that like these days
you got the navy everywhere
you got frogmen
you got ec2s with
the satellite-tracking shit
you got the fucking bell 209
assault choppers up the ass
were losing one
out of every nine loads
that no duckwalk anymore
let me tell you
forget about 35
what do you suggest
that is reasonable
excuse me
one moment
what the fuck
the matter with you
are you negotiating
for frank lopez
dont worry about it
take it easy
im not worried about it
you should worry about it
if he wants to make a deal
it up to him not you
were doing this
one deal that it
fuck you
how that
fuck you
fuck you
you need to open your eyes
and keep your mouth shut
that it
let it go at that
dont worry about it
your head in the wrong place
you must watch out for yourself
why not talk to him
you think he wants
to give you the money
shut the fuck up
im doing
the talking here not you
youre here to watch my back
watch my back
better than your front
let me tell you
that easier to watch
close your mouth
i cant wait to see what
frank gonna react to this one
just shut up
im doing the talking here
now where were we
panama
youre looking for a partner right
something like that
look mr sosa
were getting ahead of ourselves
i am down on frank authority
to buy 200 keys that it
that my limit
i got no right
nobody got no right to negotiate
let the man finish okay
let him propose a proposition
then we can talk more
you got no authority here
i started you in this business
so shut the fuck up
frank is gonna love it
that up to frank not you
im sorry about this mr sosa
no it is all right
youre right
maybe you should talk to frank
well good
i dont think it something
i want to do on an overseas phone
but as soon as i get back to miami
i will talk to frank personally

i dont feel the same
about the rest of
your organization

im talking about omar suarez
this garbage was recognized
by my associate at lunch
from several years ago in new york
he was an informer for the police
he put vito duval and nello
and gino ramos away for life

i think you speak
from the heart montana

sugar corporation
pleasure meeting you
nice to meet you
general edward strasser
commander of the first army corps

this is ariel bleyer
with the ministry of the interior
tony montana
and here is our friend
charles goodson from washington
nice to meet you
how do you do mr montana
sit here tony
gentlemen
i would like to discuss something
that is of interest
to all of us here
you have a problem tony
we have a problem
i think together
we can solve all our problems
we all know you have tax
troubles in your country
and that you may have
to do a little time
we have friends in washington
that assure us these troubles
can be taken care of
you may have to pay some back taxes
a big fine
but there will be no prison
okay
so what your problem alex
ill show you my problem
ive heard about financial
support your government receives
from the drug industry in bolivia
well the irony of this
is that this money
which is in the billions
is coming from your country
you are the major purchaser
of our national product
which is cocaine
on one hand
youre saying the us government
is spending millions to eliminate
the flow of drugs onto our streets
at the same time
we are doing business
with the same government
that is flooding
our streets with cocaine
let me show you a few
of the other characters
that are involved
in this tragic comedy
my organization just recently traced
a large purchase by this man
this charming face here
belongs to general cucombre
he is the minister of the
defense of bolivia my country
and general cucombre just
a couple months ago
bought a $2 million villa
on lake lucerne in switzerland
now if cucombre is supposed to be
the bolivian defense minister
what is he doing
living in switzerland
guarding cash registers
this man here alejandro sosa
a very interesting character
he a wealthy landowner
educated in england
very good family
but this man is the business
brain and drug overlord
of an empire that
stretches across the andes
he not your ordinary drug dealer
well
discussing it openly
he scheduled for 60 minutes next
he is going on french british
italian japanese television
people everywhere are
starting to listen to him
it embarrassing tony
that is our problem
you remember alberto dont you
how could i forget him
alberto is an expert
in the disposal business
he going to help
us fix our problem
but he doesnt speak english
he doesnt know his way
around the states too well
he needs a little help
is that a problem tony
no problem
good
so what the big mystery
with the bolivian situation
you gonna tell me what
happened with sosa or what
a lot of bullshit
