
so where are you
youre in some motel room
you just you just wake up and
youre in in a motel room
there the key
it feels like maybe it just the
first time youve been there but
perhaps youve been there for a week
three months
it it kinda hard to say
i i dont know
it just an anonymous room
nothing in the drawers
but you look anyway
nothing except the gideon bible
which i of course read religiously
you know who you are
and you know kind of all about yourself
but just for day-to-day stuff
notes are really useful
sammy jankis had the same problem
but he he really had no system
he wrote himself
a ridiculous amount of notes
but hed get them all mixed up
you really do need a system
if youre gonna make it work
you kind of learn
to trust your own handwriting
that becomes an important part of your life
you write yourself notes
and where you put your notes
that also becomes really important
you need like a jacket that got
like six pockets in it
particular pockets for particular things
you just kind of learn to know
where things go and how the system works
and you have to be wary of other people writing
stuff for you that is not gonna make sense
or is gonna lead you astray
i mean i i dont know i guess people try and take
advantage of somebody with this condition
if you have a piece
of information which is vital
writing on your body instead of
on a piece of paper can be the answer
it just a permanent way of keeping a note
who is this
you said we talked before
i dont remember that
yeah but it not amnesia
i remember everything up until my injury
i just cant make new memories
so i cant remember talking to you
what did we talk about
oh sammy jankis
i guess i tell people about sammy
to help them understand
sammy story helps me
understand my own situation
sammy wrote himself endless
amounts of notes
but he got mixed up
i have a more graceful
solution to the memory problem
im disciplined and organized
i use habit and routine
to make my life possible
sammy had no drive
no reason to make it work
me
yeah
i got a reason
i met sammy through work;
insurance i was an investigator
id investigate the claims
to see which ones were phony
i had to see through people bullshit
it was useful experience
cause now it my life
but when i meet someone
i dont know if ive met them before
i have to just look in their eyes
and try and figure them out
my job taught me the best way to find out
what someone knew was just let them talk
and watch the eyes and the body language
if someone scratches their
nose while theyre talking
experts will tell you
it means theyre lying
it really means theyre nervous
people get nervous for all sorts of reasons
it all about context
yeah i was good
sammy was my first real challenge
id just become an investigator
when i came across sammy
mr samuel r jankis strangest case ever
you know the guy a 58-year-old
semi-retired accountant
he and his wife had been in this car accident
nothing too serious
but he acting funny
he cant get a handle on what going on
the doctors find some possible damage
to the hippocampus nothing conclusive
but sammy cant remember
anything for more than a couple of minutes
cant work cant do shit
the medical bills pile up
his wife calls the insurance company
and i get sent in
now this is my first big claims investigation
so i really check into it
sammy can think just fine
but he cant make any new memories
he could only remember things
for a couple of minutes
this is mr shelby
hed watch tv
but anything longer than
a couple of minutes was too confusing
he couldnt remember how it began
he liked commercials they were short
sammy it time for my shot
the crazy part was
that this guy who couldnt even follow the
plot of green acres anymore
could do the most complicated things
as long as he learned them
before the accident
and as long as he kept his mind
on what he was doing
be gentle
now the doctors assure me there a real condition
called anterograde memory loss
or short-term memory loss
it rare but legit
but every time i see him
i catch this look
this slight look of recognition
but he says he cant remember me at all
sammy it okay i got it i got it
hi mr shelby
hi mrs jankis
now i can read people and
im thinking bad actor
so now im suspicious and i order more tests
sammy couldnt pick up any new skills at all
but i find something in my research
conditioning
sammy should still be able to learn
through repetition
it how you learn stuff like riding a bike
you just get better through practice
it a completely different part of the brain
from the short-term memory
so i had the doctors test
sammy response to conditioning
just pick up any three objects
that a test
where were you guys when i did my cpa
sorry
ta-da
ow what the fuck
it a test sammy
well test this you fucking quack
some of the objects were electrified
theyd give him a small shock
they kept repeating the test
always with the same objects electrified
the point was to see if sammy could learn
to avoid the electrified objects
not by memory but by instinct
they kept testing sammy for months
always with the same objects
carrying the electrical charge
ow what the fuck
it a test sammy
test this you fucking quack
even with total short-term memory loss
sammy should have learned to instinctively stop
picking up the wrong objects
all the previous cases responded to conditioning
sammy didnt respond at all
it was enough to suggest that his condition
was psychological not physical
we turned down his claim on the grounds
that he wasnt covered for mental illness
his wife got stuck with the bills
and i got a big promotion
conditioning didnt work for sammy
-so he became helpless
but it works for me
i live the way sammy couldnt
habit and routine make my life possible
conditioning
acting on instinct
sammy wife was crippled
by the cost of supporting him
and fighting the company decision
but it wasnt the money that got to her
i never said that sammy was faking
listen i have an idea
sammy i have an idea
just that his problem was mental not physical
i want you to have a pen in your pocket okay
youre gonna have a pen in your pocket
but she couldnt understand
and youre gonna have a pad like that
in your pocket i did something wrong
you did something wrong
now were gonna deal with it well figure out
were gonna try a little harder
she looks into his eyes
and sees the same person
and if it not a physical problem
he should just snap out of it
ellen called
ellen called
ellen cant come today ellen cant come
okay im sorry
im sorry im trying im sorry
try harder
so good old leonard shelby from the insurance
company gives her the seed of doubt
just like he gave it to the doctors
but i never said that he was faking
i never said that
well what mrs jankis didnt understand was
that you cant bully someone into remembering
the more pressure youre under
the harder it gets
well then call m call me back
who is this
yeah
uh-huh
well sir thatd certainly be in keeping
with some of my own discoveries
i was hoping for a little more on the drugs angle
can you hang on a sec
the police report mentioned
the drugs found in the car outside my house
the car was stolen
but his prints were all over it
i got friends in the department
they gave me a copy of it
i dealt with the police a lot
in my insurance job
in my condition it really tough
i cant keep it all in mind at once
i have to summarize the different sections
and there pages missing
i guess ive been trying to log them all
i dont know why these are crossed out
but they werent even looking for john g
the stuff they found in the car just fit in with
what they believed had happened
so they didnt chase any of it up
there something about the drugs stashed
in the car that doesnt ring true for me
because the police claim
the guy was an addict
needing money to score
which i think is bullshit
cause he not gonna go breaking into places
while he still got a stash that big
well i think john g left it there
or planted it there
how do you know that
oh shit that true it fits
so he a dealer
hang on a sec
now were getting somewhere
i cant blame the cops
for not taking me seriously;
this is a difficult condition
for people to understand
i mean look at sammy jankis
his own wife couldnt deal with it
i told you about how she tried
to get him to snap out of it
eventually she came to see me at the office
i found out all kinds of shit
she told me about life with
sammy how she treated him
thank you for seeing me
you know it got to the point where shed get sammy
to hide food all around the house
and then shed stop feeding him
to see if his hunger
would make him remember
where hed hidden the food
she wasnt a cruel person
she just wanted old sammy back
mr shelby you know all about sammy
and youve decided that he faking
mrs jankis the company position
isnt that sammy is faking anything
just that his condition cant be shown to be ph
i just want to know what your honest opinion about sammy is
ah we shouldnt even be talking like this
while the case is still open to appeal
im not appealing the decision
then why are you here
try to understand
when i look at sammy
i dont see some
vegetable
i see my same old sammy
what do you think that like for me
to suspect that he might be imagining
this whole problem and that if i
just could say the right thing
hed snap out of it and go back to being normal
if i
if i knew that my
old sammy were truly gone
then i could say good-bye
and start loving this new sammy
as long as i have doubt i cant
say good-bye and move on
what do you want from me
i want you to forget the company
you work for for 30 seconds and
tell me if you really believe
that sammy faking his condition
i need to know
what you honestly believe
i believe that sammy should be physically
capable of making new memories
thank you
i thought i helped her
i thought she just needed some kind of answer
i didnt think it was important
what the answer was
just that she had one to believe
fact 5
drugdealer
no she shouldnt have
given me that responsibility
im a claims investigator not a doctor
yeah i guess
but ive got all sorts of other considerations
legal responsibility large financ
never answer the phone
who is this
front desk
burt right
this is mr shelby in room 2
yeah that the thing
i dont want any calls
nope none at all
hello
it burt from the front desk
yeah
ah i know you said you didnt want any calls
but this guy called
he on the phone now -he says he a cop
a cop
yeah
and ah
he says youre really gonna wanna
know what he has to say so ah
no im not too good on the phone
i need to look people in the eye when i talk to them
kay whwhat
why are you calling me
what do you want
i know youre a cop but what do you want
have i done something wrong
i dont know something bad maybe i ah
why are you asking me i cant remember
what ive done you wouldnt believe me anyway
because of my condition
you dont believe someone with this condition
nobody believed sammy
i didnt even fucking believe sammy
it completely fucked
because nobody believes you
oh it amazing what a little brain damage
will do for your credibility
i guess it some kind of poetic justice
for not believing sammy
you know the truth about my condition officer
you dont know anything
you feel angry you dont know why
you feel guilty
you have no idea why
you could do anything
not have the faintest idea 0 minutes later
like sammy
what if ive done something like sammy
i didnt tell you
what happened to sammy and his wife
she came to see me at my office
i thought she was just trying to catch me off guard
so i didnt tell her what i really thought
but i never said that he was faking it
just that his condition was mental not physical
i found out later that she went home
and gave sammy his final exam
sammy
it time for my shot
she knew beyond a doubt that he loved her
so she found a way to test him
sammy
it time for my shot
she really thought shed call his bluff
there you go
or she just didnt wanna live
with the things shed put him through
sammy
it time for my shot
i wont hurt
she went into a coma and never recovered
sammy couldnt understand
or explain what happened
he been in a home ever since
he doesnt even know that his wife is dead
i was wrong about sammy
and i was wrong about his wife
she wasnt interested in the money
she just needed to understand his problem
his brain didnt respond to conditioning
but he wasnt a con-man
and when she looked into his eyes
she thought he could be the same person
when i looked into his eyes
i thought i saw recognition
now i know you fake it
if you think youre supposed to
recognize somebody you just pretend to
you bluff it to get a pat
on the head from the doctors
you bluff it to seem less of a freak
what drug dealer
so this jimmy grants deals drugs out
of the bar where his girlfriend works
but he not gonna bring her along
hell come by himself right

would be the best way to get him

so you lie to yourself to be happy
there nothing wrong with that
we all do it
who cares if there a few little details
youd rather not remember
what the fuck are you talking about
i dont know
your wife surviving the assault
her not believing your condition
the torment and pain and
anguish tearing her up inside
the insulin
that sammy not me
i told you about sammy
yeah right
like you tell yourself over and over again
conditioning yourself to remember
learning through repetition
sammy let his wife kill herself
sammy ended up in an institution
sammy was a con-man
-a faker
i never said that sammy was faking
you exposed him for what he was
-a fraud
and i was wrong
that the whole point
see sammy wife came to me
sammy didnt have a wife
it was your wife who had diabetes
ouch
my wife wasnt diabetic
you sure
ouch cut it out
she wasnt diabetic
you think i dont know my own wife
what the fuck is wrong with you
well i guess i can only make you remember
the things you wanna be true
like old jimmy down there
he not the right guy
he was to you
come on you got your revenge
enjoy it while you still remember
what difference does it make
whether he was your guy or not
it makes all the difference
why youre never gonna know
yes i will
no you wont
i will somehow ill know
you wont remember
when it done i will know itll be different
i thought so too
in fact i was sure of it but you didnt
that right
the real john g
i helped you find him over a year ago
he already dead
dont lie to me anymore
look lenny
i was the cop assigned to your wife case
-i believed you
i thought you deserved a chance for revenge
im the one that helped you find the other guy
in your bathroom that night
the guy that cracked your skull
and fucked your wife
we found him you killed him
but you didnt remember
so i helped you
start looking again
looking for the guy you already killed
oh yeah so who was he
just some guy i mean does it even matter who
no reason lenny
no conspiracy
just bad fucking luck
couple of junkies too strung out to
realize your wife didnt live alone
but when you killed him i was so convinced
that youd remember
but it didnt stick
like nothing ever sticks
like this wont stick
i took that picture
just when you did it
look how happy you are
i wanted to see that face again
oh gee thanks
fuck you
i gave you a reason to live
and you were more than happy to help
you dont want the truth
you make up your own truth
like your police file
it was complete when i gave it to you
who took out the 2 pages
you probably
no it wasnt me see it was you
why would i do that
to create a puzzle you could never solve
you know how many how many towns
how many john g or james g
i mean shit lenny im a fucking john g
your name is teddy
my mother calls me teddy
my name john edward gammell
cheer up

im the one that put it all together
you wander around youre playing detective
youre living a dream kid
a dead wife to pine for
a sense of purpose to your life
a romantic quest that you wouldnt end

you helped me out and im grateful
you have to burn them
leonard you decided to help me
trust yourself
trust your own judgment
you can question everything
you can never know anything for sure
there are things you know for sure
such as
i know what that gonna sound like
when i knock on it
i know what that gonna
feel like when i pick it up
see
certainties
it the kind of memory you take for granted
you know i can remember so much
the feel of the world
and her
she gone
and the present is trivia
which i scribble down as fucking notes
hey hey come on try and relax come on
it not easy for me to relax you know
come on take your jacket off
now come on
hey
didnt think you were the type
it backwards
come here
come here
what about here
maybe it for when i find him
ive lost somebody too
im sorry
his name was jimmy
what happened to him
he went to meet somebody
-he never came back
who did he go to meet
a guy called teddy
what do the police think
they dont look too hard for guys like jimmy
when you find this guy this john g
what are you gonna do
im gonna kill him
maybe i can help you find him
i dont even know how long she been gone
it like ive woken up in bed
and she not here
because she gone to
the bathroom or something
but somehow i just
i just know she never gonna come back to bed
if i could just
reach over and touch
her side of the bed
i would know that it was cold
but i cant
i know i cant have her back
but i dont want to wake up in the morning
thinking she still here
i lie here not knowing
how long ive been alone
so how
how can i heal
how am i supposed to heal
if i cant
feel time
she has also lost someone
she will help you out of pity
awake
where am i
somebody bedroom
it must be her room
but who is she
it only me
did you sleep okay
yeah you
oh shit shit i gotta be someplace
it pretty weird
it useful
you never write a phone number on your hand
i uhm i should be able to talk to my friend
today about the license plate
yeah the license plate
john g license plate
you have it tattooed on your thigh
natalie
she has also lost someone
she will help you out of pity
if it registered in this state
it should only take a couple seconds
to pull up his license and registration
ill call you as soon as i talk to him
do you think we could just arrange a meeting now
im not too good on the phone
you know it great that you
well that youre
helping me like this
im helping you
because you helped me
so next time you see me
will you remember me
i think you will
im sorry
lenny before you go
could i have my shirt back please
yo lenny
i thought you split for good
well things change
so i see
my name teddy
i guess ive told you about my condition
only every time i see you
come on ill buy you lunch
have i told you about sammy jankis
yeah
im sick of hearing about the guy
what about john g
you think he still here
who
johnny g the guy youre looking for
i mean that why you havent left town am i right
maybe
leonard look you have to be very careful
why
the other day you mentioned that maybe
somebody was trying to set you up
get you to kill the wrong guy
oh well i go on facts not
recommendations but thank you
lenny you cant trust a man life
to your little notes and pictures
why not
because your notes could be unreliable
memory unreliable
oh please
no no no really
memory not perfect
it not even that good
ask the police
eyewitness testimony is unreliable
the cops dont catch a killer
by sitting around remembering stuff
they collect facts they make notes
and they draw conclusions
facts not memories
that how you investigate
i know it what i used to do
look memory can change the shape of a room
it can change the color of a car
and memories can be distorted
theyre just an interpretation
theyre not a record
and theyre irrelevant if you have the facts
you really want to get this guy dont you
he killed my wife
he took away my fucking memory
he destroyed my ability to live
youre living
only for revenge
then well get the bastard
where you staying
discount inn
i dont know what room
i havent got my key
probably left it in your room
hi im checked in here
but i think ive misplaced my key
how you doing leonard
probably in the room right
dont see my key anywhere
oh shit this is the wrong room
youre in 304 now im sorry
i fucked up
this is not my room
no come on let go
then why is this my handwriting
this was your room
but now youre in 304
when was i in here
last week
but then i rented you
another room on top of it
why
business is slow i mean i i
i i told my boss about the
your condition and stuff
and he said
try and rent him another room
how many rooms am i checked
into in this shit-hole
just two
so far
well
at least youre being honest
about ripping me off
well youre not gonna remember anyway
you dont have to be that honest burt
leonard
always get a receipt
oh yeah im gonna write that down
what time is it
quarter to 00
y
your room
today 00 pm meet natalie for info
she has also lost someone
she will help you out of pity
natalie
you dont remember me
im sorry i should have explained i have this cond
you did explain lenny
please call me leonard
my wife called me lenny
yeah i know you told me
well then i probably told you how much i hated it
yeah
do you mind taking your glasses off
it hard for me to
thanks
so you have information for me
is that what your little note says
yeah
must be tough living your life
according to a couple of scraps of paper;
you mix your laundry list
with your grocery list
and youll end up eating your
underwear for breakfast
i guess that why you have
those freaky tattoos
yeah it tough it almost impossible
look im sorry i dont remember you
it nothing personal
i do have information for you
you gave me a license plate number
had my friend at dmv trace it
guess what name came up
john edward gammell -john g
do you know him
no
but his face on his driver license
looked really familiar i think he
i think he been in the bar maybe
here a copy of his license
his registration photo and all
are you sure you want this
have i told you what this man did
yeah
well then you shouldnt have to ask
but even if you get revenge
youre not gonna remember it
youre not even gonna
know that it happened
my wife deserves vengeance doesnt make
any difference whether i know about it
just because there are things i dont
remember doesnt make my actions meaningless
the world doesnt just disappear
when you close your eyes does it
anyway
maybe ill take a photograph to remind myself
get another freaky tattoo
tell me about her again
why
because you like to remember her
she was beautiful
to me she was perfect
no
dont just recite the words
close your eyes
and remember her
you can just feel the details
the bits and pieces
you never bothered to put into words
and you can feel these extreme moments
even if you dont want to
you put these
together and you get a feel of a person
enough to know how much you miss them
and how much we hate the person who took them away
i uhm
i added an address in here
it might be useful
it an abandoned place outside of town
uhm a guy i knew used to do bigger deals there
it isolated
sounds perfect
