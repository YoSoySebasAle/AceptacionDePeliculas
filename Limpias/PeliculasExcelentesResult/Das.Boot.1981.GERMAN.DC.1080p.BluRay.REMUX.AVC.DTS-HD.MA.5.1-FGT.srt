one ship travelling fast
no chance of getting it in this light
it more than merely
superficial to take the utmost
care in dress and personal apperances
it denotes that the
has a corresponding effect on other people
an officer should be thoroughly
unpretentious
in character and wardrobe
always be the case in the old days
young officers used to
when superiors were more lenient
for the german lieutenant
always knew
comfortably huh
no mail no telephone

chief coming through
all of our compass are out of action
and we may have lost sonar gear too
and radio contact seems bad
first rate condition
can we get out again
do you think we have a chance sir
good question
some air must be still in the ballast tanks
from the blowing
should help us
if we used every ounce of high pressure
well try
the boat has to be light
weve got to get the water out
must work must work
aft is almost bailed
it could just work
by hand into the trimming tanks
then with ballast pump
and high pressure air
we could forced the water out
ballast pump
were fixing it
then we gamble on one pump
one blast and--
wont be a second chance
when
when all repaired are completed
about 8 hours sir
co2 content
8 percent
will the oxygen last
no
emergency issue
for all men whore working

that great
dont worry captain
well soon be arriving
how it going
two bearings stand to be changed and fix
do you want some glucose
it a little crazy
hauling us through the strait
it was bound to go wrong
he knew it
the old man knew it
from the moment that
radio signal comes through
realised the risk
the reason he wanted us ashore
at vigo
he knew there wasnt any hope
he wanted us believe
quite simple as that
easy trick
dive drift with the current and --
that a clever trick
but it has to work
will we ever get out of this
i really dont know
im sorry
you think it hopeless now
it been 5 hours
hell never do it
im sorry
that we wanted to stay
to be heading into the inexorable
where no mother will care for us
no woman crosses our path
where only reality reigns
with cruelty and grandeur
just want someone to be with
the only thing i feel is afraid
reporting sir
motors are all done
the ballast tanks is cleared
accumulated water can all be pump
then blown out
with compressed air
compass is in order
echo sonar clear
good chief
go and take a rest
few small problems sir

see if we can get our rear end
out of the sand
at the surface
say your prayers men
traffics heavy up there
and we pray the engines start
so we can get out of this place
if the condition about the same
weve got to head straight
to la rochelle
