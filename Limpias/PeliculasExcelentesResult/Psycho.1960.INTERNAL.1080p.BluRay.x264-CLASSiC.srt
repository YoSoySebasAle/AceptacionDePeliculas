you never did eat your lunch
did you
i better get back to the office
these extended lunch hours
give my boss excess acid
why dont you call your boss
and tell him
youre taking the rest
of the afternoon off
friday anyway
and hot
what do i do with my free afternoon
walk you to the airport
well we could laze around here
a while longer
checking-out time is 300 pm
hotels of this sort arent interested
in you when you come in
but when your time is up
oh sam i hate having to be with you
in a place like this
ive heard of married couples
who deliberately spend
an occasional night in a cheap hotel
when youre married you can do
a lot of things deliberately
you sure talk like a girl
who been married
oh sam this is the last time
yeah for what
for this
for meeting you in secret
so we can be secretive
you come down here on business trips
and we steal lunch hours
i wish you wouldnt even come
all right what do we do instead
write each other lurid love letters
oh i have to go sam
i can come down next week
no
not even just to see you
have lunch in public
oh we can see each other
we can even have dinner
but respectably
in my house
with my mother picture on the mantel
and my sister helping me broil
a big steak for three
and after the steak
do we send sister to the movies
turn mama picture to the wall
sam
all right
marion whenever it possible
i want to see you
and under any circumstances
even respectability
you make respectability
sound disrespectful
oh no im all for it
it requires patience temperance
a lot of sweating out
otherwise though it just hard work
but if i can see you and touch you
even as simply as this i wont mind
im tired of sweating for people
who arent there
i sweat to pay off my father debts
and he in his grave
i sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony
and she living on the other side
of the world somewhere
i pay too
they also pay who meet in hotel rooms
a couple of years
and my debts will be paid off
if she ever remarries the alimony stops
i havent even been married once yet
yeah but when you do youll swing
oh sam let get married
yeah and live with me in a storeroom
behind a hardware store in fairvale
well have lots of laughs
ill tell you what
when i send my ex-wife her alimony
you can lick the stamps
ill lick the stamps

now just a moment
turn your motor off please
may i see your licence
why
please

im in no mood for trouble
what
there an old saying the first customer
of the day is always the most trouble
but like i say im in no mood for it
so im gonna treat you so fair and square
that you wont have one human reason
can i trade my car in and take another
do anything you have a mind to
being a woman you will that yours
yes it there nothing wrong with it
i just
sick of the sight of it
why dont you have a look around here
and see if there something
that strikes your eyes
and meanwhile ill have my mechanic
give yours the once-over
you want some coffee i was just about
no thank you
im in a hurry
and i just wanna make a change
one thing people never ought to be
when theyre buying used cars
and that in a hurry
but like i said it too nice a day to argue
ill shoot your car in the garage here
that the one id have
picked for you myself
how much
go ahead
spin it around the block
it looks fine
how much would it be with my car
you mean you dont want the usual day
and a half to think it over
you are in a hurry arent you
somebody chasing you
of course not please
well it the first time the customer
ever high-pressured the salesman
i figure roughly
your car plus $700
$700
you always got time to argue money huh
all right
i take it you can prove that car is yours
i mean out-of-state licence and all
you got your pink slip
i believe i have the necessary papers
is there a ladies room
in the building
over there
i think you better take it for a trial spin
i dont want any bad word of mouth
about california charlie
id really rather not
cant we just settle this and
i might as well be perfectly
honest with you maam
it not that i dont trust you but
but what

about making a decision
and wanting to hurry
do you think ive stolen my car
no maam
all right let go inside
hey
just put it in here please
thank you
heck officer
that was the first time
i ever saw the customer
high-pressure the salesman
somebody chasing her
i better have a look
at those papers charlie
she look like
a wrong one to you
acted like one
the only funny thing
she paid me $700 in cash
yes mr lowery
caroline marion still isnt in
no mr lowery but then
she always a bit late on monday mornings
buzz me the minute
she comes in
and call her sister
no one answering at the house
i called her sister
mr lowery where she works
the music makers music store
you know
and she doesnt know where marion is
any more than we do
you better run out
to the house
she may be well
unable to answer the phone
her sister going to do that
she as worried as we are
no i havent
the faintest idea
as i said i last saw your sister
when she left this office on friday
she said she didnt feel well and wanted
to leave early and i said she could
that was the last i saw
oh wait a minute
i did see her some time later
driving
i think youd better come over here
to my office quick
caroline get mr cassidy

im not taking
the responsibility
oh for heaven sake
a girl works for you for 0 years

you better come over
well i aint about
to kiss off $40000
ill get it back and if any of it missing
ill replace it with her fine soft flesh
ill track her never you doubt it
hold on cassidy
i still cant believe
it must be some kind of a mystery i cant
you checked with the bank no
they never laid eyes on her no
you still trusting hot creepers
she sat there while i dumped it out
hardly even looked at it planning
and even flirting with me
gee im sorry i didnt hear you
in all this rain
go ahead in please
dirty night
you have a vacancy
oh we have 2 vacancies
twelve cabins 2 vacancies
they they moved away the highway
oh i thought id gotten off the main road
i knew you must have
nobody ever stops here any more
unless theyve done that
but there no sense dwelling on our losses
we just keep on lighting the lights
and following the formalities
your home address
oh just the town will do
los angeles
cabin one
it closer in case you want anything
right next to the office
i want sleep more than anything else
except maybe food
well there a big diner about 0 miles
up the road just outside of fairvale
am i that close to fairvale
fifteen miles ill get your bags
boy it stuffy in here
well the mattress is soft
and there hangers in the closet and
stationery with bates motel printed on it
in case you wanna make
your friends back home feel envious
and the
over there
the bathroom
yeah
well if you want anything
just tap on the wall
ill be in the office
thank you mr bates
norman bates
youre not really gonna go out again
and drive up to the diner are you
no
well then would you do me a favour
would you have dinner with me
i was just about to myself
you know nothing special
just sandwiches and milk
but id like it very much
if youd come up to the house
i dont set a fancy table
but the kitchen awful homey
id like to
all right
you get yourself settled
and take off your wet shoes
and ill be back as soon as it ready
okay
with my with my trusty umbrella
no i tell you no
i wont have you bringing
strange young girls in for supper
by candlelight i suppose
in the cheap erotic fashion
of young men with cheap erotic minds
mother please
and then what after supper
music whispers
mother she just a stranger
she hungry and it raining out
mother she just a stranger
as if men dont desire strangers as if
i refuse to speak of
disgusting things because they disgust me
you understand boy go on
go tell her shell not be appeasing
her ugly appetite
with my food or my son
or do i have to tell her
cause you dont have the guts
huh boy you have the guts boy
shut up shut up
ive caused you some trouble
no
mother my mother
what is the phrase
she isnt quite herself today
you shouldnt have bothered
i really dont have that much of an appetite
oh im sorry
i wish you could apologise for other people
dont worry about it
but as long as youve fixed a supper
we may as well eat it
it might be nicer and warmer in the office
well it stopped raining
eating in an office is just too officious
i have the parlour back here
all right
sit down
thank you
youre very kind
it all for you im not hungry go ahead
you you eat like a bird
and youd know of course
no not really
anyway i hear the expression
eats like a bird
is really a false falsity
because birds really eat a tremendous lot
but i dont really know
anything about birds
my hobby is stuffing things
you know taxidermy
and i guess
id just rather stuff birds because
i hate the look of beasts
when theyre stuffed
you know foxes and chimps
some people even stuff dogs and cats
but oh i cant do that
i think only birds look
well stuffed because
well because theyre
kind of passive to begin with
it a strange hobby curious
uncommon too
oh i imagine so
and it not as expensive as youd think
it cheap really
you know needles and thread sawdust
the chemicals are the only thing
that cost anything
a man should have a hobby
well it it more than a hobby
a hobby supposed to pass the time
not fill it
is your time so empty
no
well i run the office
and tend the cabins and grounds
and do little errands for my mother
the ones she allows
i might be capable of doing
do you go out with friends
well a boy best friend is his mother
youve never had an empty moment
in your entire life have you
only my share
where are you going
i didnt mean to pry
im looking for a private island
what are you running away from
why do you ask that
i dont know
people never run away from anything
the rain didnt last long did it
you know what i think
i think that
were all in our private traps
clamped in them
and none of us can ever get out
we scratch and claw
but only at the air only at each other
and for all of it we never budge an inch
sometimes we deliberately step
into those traps
i was born in mine
i dont mind it any more
oh but you should you should mind it
oh i do but i say i dont
you know if anyone ever
talked to me the way i heard
the way she spoke to you
sometimes when she talks to me like that
i feel id like to go up there
and curse her and leave her forever
or at least defy her
but i know i cant
she ill
she sounded strong
no i mean ill
she had to raise me all by herself
after my father died
i was only five and it mustve been
quite a strain for her
i mean she didnt have to go to work
or anything like that
he left her a little money
anyway a few years ago
mother met this man
and he talked her into building this motel
he could have talked her into anything
and when he died too
it was just too great a shock for her
and the way he died
i guess it nothing to talk
about while youre eating
anyway it was just too great
a loss for her she had nothing left
except you
well a son is a poor substitute
for a lover
why dont you go away
to a private island like you
no not like me
i couldnt do that whod look after her
shed be alone up there
her fire would go out
itd be cold and damp like a grave
if you love someone
you dont do that to them
even if you hate them
you understand i dont hate her
i hate what she become
i hate the illness
wouldnt it be better if you put her
someplace
you mean an institution a madhouse
people always call a madhouse
someplace dont they
put her in someplace
im sorry
i didnt mean it to sound uncaring
what do you know about caring
have you ever seen the inside
of one of those places
the laughing and the tears
and the cruel eyes studying you
my mother there
but she harmless
she as harmless
as one of those stuffed birds
i am sorry
i only felt it seems she hurting you
i meant well
people always mean well
they cluck their thick tongues
and shake their heads
and suggest oh so very delicately
of course ive suggested it myself
but i hate to even think about it
she needs me
it not as if she were
a maniac a raving thing
she just goes a little mad sometimes
we all go a little mad sometimes
havent you
yes
sometimes just one time can be enough
thank you
thank you norman
norman
oh youre not going back
to your room already
im very tired
and i have a long drive tomorrow
all the way back to phoenix
really
i stepped into a private trap back there
and id like to go back
and try to pull myself out of it
before it too late for me too
are you sure you wouldnt like
to stay just a little while longer
just for talk
oh id like to but
all right
well ill see you in the morning
ill bring you some breakfast all right
what time
very early dawn
all right miss
crane
crane that it
good night
no
no
mother oh god mother
blood blood
ive tried many brands
so far of those ive used
i havent had much luck with any of them
let see what they say about this one
they tell you what its ingredients are
and how it guaranteed to exterminate
every insect in the world
but they do not tell you
whether or not it painless
and i say insect or man
death should always be painless
i suppose this one seems to claim more
and better qualities than lots of the others
sam
sam lady wants to see you
yes miss
im marion sister
oh sure lila
is marion here
well of course not
thank you

i could get to believe you
i dont care if you believe me or not
all i want to do is see marion
before she gets in this too deeply
did you check in phoenix hospitals
maybe she had an accident or a holdup
no she was seen leaving town
in her own car
by her employer i might add
i cant believe it can you
well you know

who have a reputation for being honest
i think she here miss crane

with the nuts and bolts
but she here in this town somewhere
ill find her ill be seeing you

motels my eyes are bleary with neon
but you know this is the first place
that looks like it hiding from the world
well ill tell you the truth
i didnt really forget to turn the sign on

like any use any more you know
see that used to be
the main highway right there
well wanna come in and register
no no sit down i dont wanna trouble you
i just wanna ask a few questions
no that no trouble today linen day
i always change the beds here once a week
whether theyve been used or not
hate the smell of dampness dont you
it such a
i dont know creepy smell come on
you out to buy a motel

reason i ask you said youd seen so many
in the past couple of days
i thought maybe you
what what was it you wanted to ask
well you see
im looking for a missing person
my name arbogast
im a private investigator
ive been trying to trace a girl
that been missing for oh
about a week now from phoenix
it a private matter
the family wants to forgive her
she not in any trouble
i didnt think the police went looking
for people who arent in trouble
im not the police
oh yeah
we have reason to believe
that she came along this way
may have stopped in the area
did she stop here
well no one stopped here
for a couple of weeks
would you mind looking at the picture
before committing yourself
commit myself
you sure talk like a policeman
look at the picture please
mmm-mmm
sure
yeah
well she may have used an alias
marion crane her real name
but she couldve registered
under a different one
well i tell you i dont even much bother
with guests registering any more
you know one by one
you drop the formalities
i shouldnt even bother
changing the sheets
but old habits die hard
which reminds me
what that
it the light the sign
we had a couple last week
said if the thing hadnt been on
they wouldve thought
this was an old deserted
well you see that exactly my point
you said that nobodyd been here
for a couple weeks
and there a couple came by
and didnt know that you were open
yeah
well as you say old habits die hard
it possible this girl couldve registered
under another name
do you mind if i look at your book
no
thank you
all right
ill get the date somewhere
see there nobody
let see now i have a sample of her
handwriting here
oh yes
here we are
marie samuels that an interesting alias
is that her
yeah yeah i think so
marie marion
samuels her boyfriend name is sam
mmm-hmm
was she in disguise by any chance
wanna check the picture again
look i wasnt lying to you mr
oh i know that i know you wouldnt lie
you know it tough keeping track
of the time around here
oh i know i know
oh yeah
well it was raining
and her hair was all wet
i tell you it not really

and she went straight to sleep
and left early the next morning
how early
oh very early
mmm-hmm which morning was that
the
the next morning sunday
i see
did anyone meet her here
no
did she arrive with anyone
no
did she make any phone calls or
no
locally
did you spend the night with her
no
well then how would you know
that she didnt make any phone calls
well she was very tired and
see now im starting to remember
im making a mental picture
of it in my mind
you know if you make a mental
picturisation of something
that right that right take your time
she was she was sitting back there
no no she was standing back there
with a sandwich in her hand
and she said she had to go to sleep early
because she had a long drive ahead of her
back where
back where she came from
no you said before that she was
sitting back there standing back there
yes back in my parlour there
she was very hungry
and i made her a sandwich
and then she said that she was tired
and she had to go right to bed
i see how did she pay you
cash cheque
cash
cash huh
and after she left she didnt come back
well why should she
yeah
well mr arbogast i guess that about it
ive got some work to do if you dont mind
well to tell you the truth i do mind
you see if it doesnt jell it isnt aspic
and this aint jelling
it not coming together
something missing
well i dont know
what you could expect me to know
people just come and go you know
that right she isnt still here is she
no
if i wanted to check the cabins
all 2 of them
id need a warrant wouldnt i
listen if you dont believe me come on
with me you can help me change beds

of those faces you just cant help believing
is anyone at home
no
oh there somebody
sitting up in the window
no no there isnt
sure go ahead take a look
oh that must be my mother
she an invalid
it practically like living alone
oh i see
now if this girl marion crane were here
you wouldnt be hiding her would you
no
not even if she paid you well
no
let just say just for the sake of argument
that she wanted you to gallantly protect her
youd know that you were being used
you wouldnt be made a fool of would you
but im not a fool
well i
and im not capable of being fooled
not even by a woman
well this is not a slur on your manhood
let put it this way
she might have fooled me
but she didnt fool my mother
well then your mother met her
could i talk to your mother
no as i told you she confined
yes but just for a few minutes that all
there might be some hint
that you missed out on
you know sick old women
are usually pretty sharp
mr arbogast i think ive
just for a moment i wouldnt disturb her
i think ive talked to you all i want to
yes but just for
i think itd be much better if you left now
thanks
well all right
you sure would save me a lot of leg work
if youd let me talk to her
would i need a warrant for that too
sure
uh-huh
all right thanks anyway

only the old lady at home
sick old lady unable to answer the door
or unwilling
where could he have gone
maybe he got some definite lead
maybe he went right on
without calling me
in a hurry
sam he called when he had nothing
nothing but a dissatisfied feeling
dont you think hed have called
if he had anything at all
yes i think he wouldve
let go see al chambers

good evening
well i dont know where to start
except at the beginning
yes
this is lila crane from phoenix
how do you do
she been here searching for her sister
there this private detective helping and
well we got a call from this detective
saying that hed traced her to that motel
out on the old highway
that must be the bates motel
he traced her there and called us to say
he was going to question mrs bates
norman took a wife
no i dont think so
an old woman his mother
well anyway that was early this evening
we havent seen or heard from him since
now your sister missing how long
well she left phoenix a week ago yesterday
without a trace
howd you and this detective
come to trace her to fairvale
they thought shed be coming to me
left phoenix under her own steam
yes
she not missing so much
as she run away
that right
from what
she stole some money
a lot
$40000
and the police havent been able to
everyone concerned thought if they
could get her to give the money back
they could avoid involving her
with the police
that explains the private detective
he traced her to the bates place
what exactly did he say
when he called you
well he said that marion was there
for one night and then she left
with the $40000
well he didnt say anything
about the money
it isnt important what
he said on the phone is it
he was supposed to come back here
and talk to us
after he talked to the mother
and he didnt
that what i want you
to do something about
like what
im sorry if i seem overanxious
it just that im sure there something
wrong out there and i have to know what
well i think there something wrong
too miss but not the same thing
i think what wrong is
your private detective
i think he got himself a hot lead
as to where your sister was going
probably from norman bates
and called you to keep you still
while he took off after her and the money
no no he said he was dissatisfied
and he was going back there
why dont you call norman
and let him say just what happened
at this hour
well he was out
when i was there just a while ago
if he back
he probably isnt even in bed yet
he wasnt out when you were there
he just wasnt answering the door
in the dead of night like some people do
this fellow lives like a hermit
you must remember that bad business
out there about 0 years ago
please call
florrie the sheriff wants you to
connect him with the bates motel
hello norman sheriff chambers
ive been just fine thanks
listen we got worries here
yeah have you had a fella
stop by there tonight
well this one wouldnt be
a customer anyway
he a private detective name of
arbogast
arbogast
and after he left
no that okay norman
this detective was there
norman told him about the girl
the detective thanked him
and he went away
and he didnt come back
he didnt see the mother
your detective told you
he couldnt come right back
because he was going to question
norman bates mother right
yes
norman bates mother has
been dead and buried
in green lawn cemetery
for the past 0 years
i helped norman pick out the dress
she was buried in periwinkle blue
it aint only local history sam
it the only case of murder and suicide
on fairvale ledgers
mrs bates poisoned this guy
she was involved with
when she found out he was married
then took a helping
of the same stuff herself
strychnine ugly way to die
norman found them dead together
in bed
you mean that old woman i saw sitting in
the window out there wasnt bates mother
now wait a minute sam
are you sure you saw an old woman
yes in the house behind the motel
i called and pounded
but she just ignored me
you want to tell me
you saw norman bates mother
but it had to be
because arbogast said so too
and the young man wouldnt let him
see her because she was too ill
well if the woman up there is mrs bates
who that woman buried out
in green lawn cemetery
now mother
im gonna bring something up
i am sorry boy
but you do manage to look ludicrous
when you give me orders
please mother
no
i will not hide in the fruit cellar
you think im fruity huh
im staying right here
this is my room
and no one will drag me out of it
least of all my big bold son
theyll come now mother
he came after the girl
and now someone will come after him
mother please it just for a few days
just for a few days so they wont find you
just for a few days
in that dark dank fruit cellar no
you hid me there once boy
and you wont do it again not ever again
now get out
i told you to get out boy
ill carry you mother
norman
what do you think youre doing
dont you touch me dont norman
put me down put me down
i can walk on my own
good morning
good morning
good morning
we thought if you didnt mind
wed drive out to that motel with you
he already been
went out before service
did you two have breakfast
you didnt find anything
nothing let clear the way here
well what did he say about my sister
just what he told your detective
she used a fake name
saw the register myself
saw the whole place as a matter of fact
that boy alone there
no mother
you must have seen an illusion sam
i know youre not the seeing-illusions type
but no woman was there
and i dont believe in ghosts
so there it is
i still feel that there something
can see you do
im sorry i couldnt make you feel better
you want to come around
to my office this afternoon
and report a missing person and a theft
that what you want to do
the sooner you drop this
in the lap of the law
that the sooner you stand a chance
of your sister being picked up
how about that
i dont know
it sunday
come on over to the house
and do your reporting around dinnertime
itll make it nicer
you too sam
thank you
maybe i am the seeing-illusions type
no youre not
well you want me to drop you
at the hotel or
sam
i still wont feel satisfied
until i go out there
neither will i come on
we better decide what were gonna say
or do when we walk in there
were going to register as man and wife
were going to get shown to a cabin
and then were going to search every
inch of the place inside and out
i wonder where norman bates
does his hermiting
someone at that window
i just saw the curtain move
come on
well
just coming up to ring for you
uh-huh
suppose you want a room
we were gonna try to make it
straight to san francisco
but we dont like the look of that sky
looks like a bad day coming doesnt it
okay
ill take you to cabin 0
better sign in first hadnt we
no that not necessary
my boss is paying for this trip
and well it 90% business
he wants practically notarised receipts
id better sign in and get a receipt
thank you
ill get your bags
havent any
ill show you the room then
first time ive ever seen it happen
you check in any other place
in this country without bags
and you have to pay in advance
$0
that receipt
ill go on ahead
all right there your receipt
now ill show you the cabin
dont bother yourself well find it
sam we have to go into that cabin
and search it
no matter what were afraid of finding
or how much it may hurt
i know
do you think if something happened
it happened there
i dont know
but if you had a useless
business like this motel
what would you need to get out
to get a new business somewhere else
$40000
how could we prove that
well if he opens a motel on
the new highway in say a year
there must be some proof that exists now
something that proves he got that money
away from marion somehow
what makes you sound so certain
arbogast he liked me sam
or he felt sorry for me and he was
beginning to feel the same way about you
i could tell the last time
i talked to him on the phone
he wouldnt have gone anywhere
or done anything without telling us
unless he was stopped
and he was stopped
so he must have found out something
well start with cabin one
if he sees us were just taking the air
bates
no shower curtain
sam
look
what is it
it figuring
it didnt get washed down look
some figure has been added to
or subtracted from 40000
that proves marion was here
itd be too wild a coincidence
bates never denied she was here
well doesnt that prove that he found out
about the money
do we simply ask him where he hidden it
no
but that old woman whoever she is
she told arbogast something
i want her to tell us the same thing
you cant go up there
why not
bates
well let find him
one of us can keep him occupied
while the other gets to the old woman
youll never be able to hold him still
if he doesnt want to be held
i dont like you going into that house alone
i can handle a sick old woman
all right ill find bates
and keep him occupied
wait a minute
if you get anything out of the mother
can you find your way back to town
yes of course
if you do get anything
dont stop to tell me
you looking for me
why yes as a matter of fact
wife taking a nap
and i never can keep quiet enough for her
so i just thought id look you up and talk
good you satisfied with your cabin
oh it fine
ive been doing all the talking so far
havent i
i thought it was the people
who were alone most of the time
who did all the talking
when they got the chance
here you are doing all the listening
you are alone here arent you
mmm-hmm
drive me crazy
i think that would be a rather
extreme reaction dont you
just an expression
what i meant was
id do just about anything to get away
wouldnt you
no
mrs bates
im not saying
you shouldnt be contented here
im just doubting that you are
i think if you saw a chance to get out
from under youd unload this place
this place
this place happens to be my only world
i grew up in that house up there
i had a very happy childhood
my mother and i were more than happy
you look frightened
have i been saying something frightening
i dont know what youve been saying
ive been talking about your mother
about your motel
how you gonna do it
do what
buy a new one in a new town
where you wont have to hide your mother
why dont you just get in your car
and drive away from here okay
where will you get
the money to do that bates
or do you already have it socked away
shut up
a lot of it $40000
i bet your mother knows where
the money is and what you did to get it
i think shell tell us
where that girl you came here with
where is she
mrs bates
im norma bates
if anyone gets any answers
itll be the psychiatrist
even i couldnt get to norman
and he knows me
you warm enough miss
yes
did he talk to you
no
i got the whole story but not from norman
i got it from his mother
norman bates no longer exists
he only half-existed to begin with
and now the other half has taken over
probably for all time
did he kill my sister
yes and no
well now look if youre trying to lay
some psychiatric groundwork
for some sort of plea
this fellow would like to cop
a psychiatrist doesnt lay the groundwork
he merely tries to explain it
but my sister is
yes
yes im sorry
the private investigator too
if you drag that swamp somewhere
in the vicinity of the motel youll
have you any unsolved missing
persons cases on your books
yes two
young girls
did he confess to
like i said the mother
now to understand it the way i understood
it hearing it from the mother
that is from the mother half
of norman mind
you have to go back 0 years
to the time when norman murdered
his mother and her lover
now he was already dangerously disturbed
had been ever since his father died
his mother was a clinging
demanding woman
and for years the two of them lived
as if there was no one else in the world
then she met a man
and it seemed to norman
that she threw him over for this man
now that pushed him over the line
and he killed them both
matricide is probably the most
unbearable crime of all
most unbearable to the son who commits it
so he had to erase the crime
at least in his own mind
he stole her corpse
a weighted coffin was buried
he hid the body in the fruit cellar
even treated it to keep it
as well as it would keep
and that still wasnt enough
she was there but she was a corpse
so he began to think and speak for her
give her half his life so to speak
at times he could be both personalities
carry on conversations
at other times
the mother half took over completely
he was never all norman
but he was often only mother
and because he was
so pathologically jealous of her
he assumed that she was as jealous of him
therefore if he felt a strong
attraction to any other woman
the mother side of him would go wild
when he met your sister
he was touched by her aroused by her
he wanted her
that set off the jealous mother
and mother killed the girl
after the murder
norman returned as if from a deep sleep
and like a dutiful son
covered up all traces of the crime
he was convinced
his mother had committed
why was he dressed like that
he a transvestite
not exactly
a man who dresses in women clothing
in order to achieve a sexual change
or satisfaction is a transvestite
but in norman case
he was simply doing everything possible
to keep alive the illusion
of his mother being alive
and when reality came too close
when danger or desire
threatened that illusion
hed dress up
even to a cheap wig he bought
hed walk about the house
sit in her chair speak in her voice
he tried to be his mother
and now he is
that what i meant when i said
i got the story from the mother
you see when the mind
houses two personalities
there always a conflict a battle
in norman case the battle is over
and the dominant personality has won
and the $40000 who got that
the swamp
these were crimes of passion not profit
he feels a little chill
can i bring him this blanket
oh sure
all right
thank you
it sad when a mother
has to speak the words
that condemn her own son
but i couldnt allow them to believe
that i would commit murder
theyll put him away now
as i should have years ago
he was always bad
and in the end he intended to tell them
i killed those girls and that man
as if i could do anything
except just sit and stare
like one of his stuffed birds
they know i cant even move a finger
and i wont
ill just sit here and be quiet
just in case they do suspect me
theyre probably watching me
well let them
let them see what kind
of a person i am
im not even gonna swat
that fly
i hope they are watching
theyll see
theyll see
and theyll know
and theyll say
why she wouldnt even harm a fly
