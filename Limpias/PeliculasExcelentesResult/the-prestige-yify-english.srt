man  are you watching closely
chirping
man 2 every magic trick consists
of three parts or acts
the first part is called the pledge
the magician shows you
something ordinary
a deck of cards a bird or a man
applause
he shows you this object
perhaps he asks you to inspect it
to see that it is indeed real
unaltered normal
but of course it probably isnt
where do you think youre going
im part of the bloody act you fool
loud zapping
the second act is called the turn
zapping
the magician takes
the ordinary something
and makes it do
something extraordinary
now youre looking for the
secret but you wont find it
because of course
youre not really looking
you dont really want to know
you want to be fooled
but you wouldnt clap yet
because making something
disappear isnt enough
you have to bring it back
that why every magic trick
has a third act
the hardest part
the part we call
the prestige
muffled screaming
man the prestige and did robert
angier the great danton your employer
get to that final part
of his trick that night
no sir something went wrong
what went wrong
i saw someone making
their way below stage
i followed him
it was borden
watching mr angier drown
would you please describe
your occupation to the jury mr cutter
im an ingnieur i design illusions
and construct the apparatus
necessary for performing them
so mr cutter was this
water-filled tank beneath the stage
part of mr angier illusion
no the tank was brought
on for the first trick
and then taken offstage
borden must have placed it
under the trap door after the end of it
how large was this tank
it a normal tank
for escape under water
about 400 or 500 gallons
how do you think he
was able to move the tank
under the trap door
without anyone noticing
he a magician ask him
laughing
man i ask again
would this man explain the mechanics
of mr angier illusion
the real transported man is one
of the most sought after illusions
in this business
i have the right to sell it on
if i reveal the method here
the trick is worthless
how can we know
that the tank wasnt simply
some part of the trick that went wrong
mr cutter i see your predicament
but alfred borden life
hangs in the balance
if you were prepared to disclose
the details to me in private
i might be able to judge
their relevance to the case
might this be an acceptable compromise
guard im going to have to ask
you to turn out your pockets
not my idea sir the warden saw
his show in manchester last year
where he vanished into thin air
he convinced hell try and escape
men shouting
i told him the only way
borden going to disappear
is if i leave him out there
with the other inmates
check the locks
twice
my name is owens
im a solicitor
i represent lord caldlow an
accomplished amateur magician and
borden how much
he is interested
how much for my tricks
five thousand pounds
talk to fallon my ingnieur
money for him
yes i did he offered
to sell me your tricks
all except the most valuable
one the transported man
well i wont forgive myself
for selling my greatest trick
even for your daughter
if you are for the drop your daughter
is going to need looking after
fallon will take care of her
perfect fallon
a man with a past
as obscure as your own
the courts have motioned she be removed
from his care she will be an orphan
i know youre no stranger
to the workhouse
it better than here
im offering you a way to wrap up
your affairs with dignity
im offering your daughter a future
as lord caldlow ward
she will want for nothing
ever
well think it over
and lord caldlow
would like you to have this
as a show of good faith
it might be of interest
robert angier diary including
the time he spent in colorado
learning your trick
he never learned it
really
on his return he mounted
a version of the transported man
that the papers said was
better even than your original
if you want angier secrets
you go dig him up and ask him yourself
i want your secret mr borden
consider your daughter
angier a cipher
an enigma
a search
a search for answers
even if colorado
is the end of my journey
itll take much longer to unravel
the rest of borden secrets
see the cipher in his notebook is
unlocked by a single word
but it will still take months
to translate his writing
and to know his mind
well my passion is equal to the task
man mr angier welcome
to colorado springs
the whole town has electricity
yes sir
well
quite a reception
youre our first guest
of the season mr angier
your telegram didnt indicate
how long youd be staying with us
as long as it takes
i will need a coach tomorrow
to take me up the mountain
well the peak closed sir
for scientific experimentation
yes i know
that why im here
whoa whoa
driver youll have to walk
the rest im afraid sir
rumbling
rumbling continues
electrical zapping
groans
door slams
man im amazed how many
of you newspaper writers
cant read my sign
not the welcome i was expecting
i know you
youre the great danton
i saw your show in london
seven times you guessed every object
the audience had in their pockets
im alley sorry about the fence
people keep interfering with our work
ive come to see tesla
why
he made a machine
for a colleague of mine some time ago
can you get me a meeting with him
impossible im afraid
ive brought a lot of money
im sorry mr angier
i simply cant help
ill be staying
at the hotel indefinitely
hey what am i holding
your watch
angier borden journal
entry for april 3 897
describes a show
at the orpheum theatre
that was just days
after he first met me
borden we were two young men
at the start of a great career
two young men devoted to an illusion
two young men who never
intended to hurt anyone
man which of you brave souls
is willing to bind
this lovely young woman
shouting
man me
applause
drum taps
if you would tie her wrists
bind her feet
around the ankle
are either of you two gentlemen sailors
no
no
im sure you can both tie a strong knot
drum tapping continues
stopwatch ticking
drum roll
applause
he complacent
he predictable he boring
milton has gotten success
whatever that means
so now he scared
he wont take any risks at all
he squandering the goodwill
of his audience with tired
second-rate tricks
theyre all favorites
give me something fresh
he wont even try a bloody bullet catch
a bullet catch is suicide
all it takes is some smartass
volunteer to put a button in the barrel
use a plant
you cant for every trick
no seats left for the punters
all right no bullet catch whatever
but the point is a real magician
tries to invent something new
that other magicians will
scratch their heads over
then you sell it to him
for a small fortune
what
i suppose you have such a trick
i sure do
would you care to sell it to me
no no one else can do my trick
any trick can be duplicated
wrong
if mr borden has invented
his masterpiece
he prepared to do it
milton is a showman
but borden is right
he wont get his hands dirty
if you want to see what
it takes to make real magic
go to the tenley there a chinaman
there and he really has what it takes
chung ling soo
i cant afford that
i know the bloke run the door
you two go and see that show and
whichever one of you can tell me
how he does the goldfish bowl
trick gets the prize
which is
ten minutes onstage
with my old friend mr ackerman
really
who ackerman
the top theatrical agent in london
i saw you drop the knot again
woman i turned my wrists
some nights you
just dont get it do you
i mean if that knot slips
and julia on the hoist
shell break her leg
it the wrong knot
like i said the langford
double will hold tighter
the langford double isnt
a wet knot it too dangerous
if the rope swells she cant slip it
i can slip a langford underwater
we can practice
borden he said no
oh you know knots better than me
listen no more mistakes
all right yeah do you
you want to take over
just leave
i didnt think so
hey cutter where he from
where are you from he shifts
props for virgil at the hall
worried hell steal your tricks
doesnt deal in methods
how do you know
because i hired him
to find out how virgil
does the orange trick
i dont trust him
he a natural magician
course you cant trust him
i think he all right
you think everyone all right
even you
watch your sightlines if i can see you
kiss your wife leg every night
so can the blokes at the ends
of rows three and four
oriental-sounding guitar strumming
snare drum roll
angier youre wrong it cant be
look at the man
this is the trick
this is the performance right here
this is why no one
can detect his method
total devotion to his art
a lot of self-sacrifice
you know
it the only way to escape
all this you know
i can barely lift this thing
and it not even filled with water
or fish look
i dont know hang on a second
he must be strong as an ox
he been pretending
to be a cripple for years
any time he in public
any time he goes out it unthinkable
borden saw it at once
but i couldnt fathom it
living my whole life
pretending to be someone else
you are pretending
i dont think changing a name compares
not your name who you are
and where youre from
i promised i wouldnt embarrass
my family with my theatrical endeavors
i thought of a name for you
the great danton
chuckles
do you like it but it sophisticated
it french
angier borden writes as if no one but
he understood the true nature of magic
but what does he know of self-sacrifice
you bloody fool
applause
whimpering he killed it
it ok
he killed it
he didnt
look now hell bring it back
no he killed it
no he didnt
applause continues
look see he all right he fine
look at him
but where his brother
he a sharp lad your son
oh he my nephew
ah
chirping
youre the lucky one today
are you watching closely
look closer
never show anyone
theyll beg you
and flatter you for the secret
but as soon as you give it up
youll be nothing to them
you understand nothing
the secret impresses no one
the trick you use it for is everything
well thank you for lunch mr borden
youre welcome
alfred it alfred
alfred
so i could use a cup of tea
i cant allow
it the landlord it not
you think that
is that enough to keep me out
chuckling i think so
so ill see you again
milk and sugar
what in there
angier machine
you built this mr cutter
oh no sir this wasnt
built by a magician
this was built by a wizard
a man who can actually do
what magicians pretend to do
tell me your honor what happens
with these things after the trial
theyve been sold to a lord caldlow
an avid collector
very interested in the case
yeah well dont let him take this
why ever not
it too dangerous
im sure beneath its bells and whistles
it got a simple
and disappointing trick
the most disappointing of all sir
it has no trick
it real
scoffs
this is the tank angier drowned in
yes
this is the
place where the performer
hand reaches through
to the trick padlock
a standard magical
apparatus for escapes
yeah with one important difference
this isnt a trick lock
it been switched for a real one
what a way to kill someone
theyre magicians your honor
showmen men who live by dressing up
plain and sometimes brutal truths
to amaze to shock
even without an audience
there was an audience
you see this water tank
was of particular significance
to these two men
particularly awful significance
milton which of you brave souls is
willing to bind this lovely young woman
drum taps
if you would tie her wrists
bind her feet around the ankle
are either of you gentlemen sailors
no
laughter
im sure you can both tie a strong knot
milton claps
stopwatch ticking
drum roll
gasps
robert
no no
julia julia
gasps
cutter i knew an old sailor once
they told me he went overboard
tangled in the sails
they pulled him out
but it took him five minutes to cough
he said it was like
going home
what do you want borden
im sorry for your loss angier
which knot did you tie
i keep asking myself that
and
and
im sorry i just dont know
you dont know
im sorry
you dont know
you dont know
alfred

where did you get all
i had to borrow and dont ask
he a very enterprising soul

the money will come with the audience
but what about until then
what i earn it barely enough for us
dont worry about it ill share
half my food with him or something

having a baby
oh my god
we should have told fallon
that is great
oh come here
chuckling oh
alfred what is this
oh this is just the trick to work
ackerman up at the end of my act
is it the masterpiece the great trick
no no no the world is
not ready for that one yet
this is just your run-of-the-mill
daring spectacular bullet catch

gun when the charge is fired

could put a penny or a button
or god forbid sarah somebody

because im not gonna let
anything happen

be all right because
i love you very much
say it again
i love you

in love with magic than me

to tell the difference

booing
borden metal rings
ladies and gentlemen

shouting

audience silent

yes
which knot did you tie borden
which knot did you tie borden
i dont know
gunshot
gasps
groaning
borden he came in to demand
an answer and i told him the truth
that i have fought with myself
over that night
one half of me swearing blind
that i tied a simple slipknot
the other half convinced
that i tied the langford double
i can never know for sure
how can he not know
angier how can he not know
he must know what he did
he must
sarah that bloody hurts
i dont understand
how it can be bleeding again
it as bad as the day it happened
we have to get a doctor back
we cant afford the doctor back
baby cries
youve woken her
great
im sorry i need this to heal
so i can get back to work
youve got to face things what tricks
can you perform with this injury
i can do car pulls
i can do some prop tricks
i can still do that i can do
the trick ive been telling you about
the one that theyre
gonna remember me for
come on
i never thought id find an answer
at the bottom of a pint glass
hasnt stopped your looking
heard about a booking
nice little theater
young up-and-coming magician
who
you
me booking why
i want to keep on working
who going to hire the ingnieur
that killed julia mccullough
in front of a sellout crowd
at the orpheum
someone who knows it wasnt your fault
someone who knows alfred borden
and his repertoire of exotic knots
i hear he had a spot of bad luck
catching a bullet south of the river
that a dangerous trick that one
well have to whitewash the windows
confound the more curious
members of the public but it will do
stomps on floor
we should see about an assistant
ive made some arrangements
you settled on a name
yes i have
the great danton
it a bit old-fashioned isnt it
no it sophisticated
the birdcage cant be
our climax everybody knows it
not like this
i dont want to kill doves
then stay off the stage
youre a magician not a wizard
you got to get your hands dirty if
youre going to achieve the impossible
in here miss wenscombe
no point in meeting mr angier
if you dont fit on the right
what so hard about this
nothing
youre going down here
indistinct talking
and this will conceal right
oh sure
tighten up on there
yep
ok
this ties up here
ties in the back
good
breathe as little as possible
now you see
that it
ok
she not experienced
but she knows how to present herself
a pretty assistant is the most
effective form of misdirection
thank you ladies and gentlemen
for my final trick
i will require the assistance
of two volunteers
mr merrit if you would oblige me
yep
under
under yeah
come around his foot
careful
it all right
grinding
your volunteer put their hand there
yeah
and another one here
if youll place your hands
on either side of the cage please
thank you olivia
you best not be intending
to hurt this animal mr angier
of course not
ready right
one
two
three
that bloody marvelous cutter
very nice
and the best part is
chuckling
i thought you said i had
to get my hands dirty
someday perhaps you will
i just had to know that you can
very nice very nice indeed
i havent had the chance to compliment
you on your beautiful theater
itll be a lot more
beautiful when it full
dont worry
you all say that why should i worry
if your tricks dont get them
in somebody else will
maybe somebody willing
to do a bullet catch or a water escape
cheap thrills mr merrit
people hoping for an accident
likely to see one too
what would that do for your business
chuckling you got a week john
thank you mr merrit
chuckles
up-tempo classical music
thank you
music ends
applause
uh sir in the third row there
please stand up
and show us your handkerchief
laughter
this isnt mine
perhaps youd return it to the lady
in the aisle of the second row
i believe she has yours
applause
up-tempo piano music
im sorry im so sorry im making
so many mistakes im so nervous
the audience doesnt seem
to be responding
theyve seen a lot of tricks before
but not this next one
cloth over
keep your fingers crossed
ill have the champagne ready
applause
angier chuckles
all groaning
youve seen this one before
man weve seen them all before
ill make it a little
harder then shall i
two volunteers please
a lady and a gentlemen
to hold this cage with me
ill perform this feat in a manner
never before seen by yourselves or any
other audience anywhere in the world
drum roll
madame place one hand
on the back of the cage
one hand on the front
sir one hand on the bottom of the cage
one hand on the top
snapping
woman screams
i shouldve spotted him
you had a lot of plates going
dont suppose we can do this again
no
so what the climax of our show
show
you dont have a show
we have a week engagement
to perform magic not butcher birds
and break my customers fingers
clear out anything here
in the morning gets burned
mr merrit
it done john
ive hired a comedian
you know i hate comedians
cutter well there
plenty of good theaters
if we can come up with a new trick
change the name of the act
the name stays
right well then the new trick
gonna have to be irresistible then
i have a couple of methods to try out
and then we need a new angle
on the presentation
and if you need some inspiration
there a technical exposition
at the albert hall this week
engineers scientists you know
that sort of thing captures
the public imagination
thunder rumbling
mind if i join you tesla sends
me down here during the storms
perfect excuse to come join
the great danton for a drink
two of them
beautiful isnt it
god i miss new york though
why are you here
the lightning lives here
and not much else
our work is secret
that a cipher
a rotating transposition
that shifts every day of the diary
simple but time-consuming to translate
even with the five-letter keyword
which is
we magicians have a circle of trust
you have a circle of trust
with someone whose diary you stole
maybe i bought it
and youre hoping to find
a great secret in there
ive already found it
that why im here
tesla built one for another magician
why would you want the same thing
call it a professional rivalry
mr tesla has built unusual
machines for unusual people
but he would never talk about it
i understand discretion
i just want the machine
finish your drink
i want to show you something
i think youll have
a special appreciation for our work
i thought it was a secret
youre a magician
who gonna believe you
not long now
our equipment requires
a great deal of current
tesla electrified the whole town
in exchange for using the
generators when we need them
we do our tests when
the townspeople are asleep
mr tesla doesnt want
to scare anyone
electrical humming
where are the wires
exactly
where the generator
you saw it last week
that must be ten miles from here
fifteen
and i have to ride all of them
before i get to bed
ill send word for you
in a few days mr angier
angier magic real magic
man now appearing only here
at london royal albert hall
one of the miracles of our age
a technological marvel youve never
seen anything like it in your lives
your eyes will not believe
what theyre witnessing
the miracle of nikola tesla
ladies and gentlemen
free clean power
like to know the future
the man who speaking right now
is going to change the world
come one come all
immediate seating no waiting
loud electrical zapping
ladies and gentlemen
gasps
objections have been raised
they should be raised
does that look safe to you
part of thomas edison smear campaign
against mr tesla
superior alternating current
man we have asked mr tesla
to reconsider
man 2 which he will not
but ive been told he refuses
to appear under any such restrictions
gasps
this thing gonna blow
ladies and gentlemen please
borden hey
hello jess
have you had a nice day
with mommy huh
sarah
i love you
see today it true
yeah
hello
angier i saw happiness
happiness that should have been mine
but i was wrong
his notebook reveals that
he never had the life that i envied
the family life
that he craves one minute
he rails against the next
demanding freedom
his mind his mind is a divided one
his soul is restless
his wife and child tormented
by his fickle and contradictory nature
so what do you think youll call her
i dont know
everybody needs a name so what hers
maybe sarah
that a lovely name
that a lovely name
well you talk about what you want
to do for the rest of the day
all right go on you talk with her
are they taking her away
to the workhouse
you keep talking
tell owens ive reconsidered take it
go on take it
it for the best
let me see
im gonna learn
all the professor secrets
only if i teach you how to read
theyre just stupid tricks right
havent helped you
get out of here have they
or cant you undo real locks professor
maybe im just biding my time
maybe one day ill
open my hand get your attention
ask are you watching closely
maybe a magic whirl or two
and then ill be gone
howd you get so famous then
magic
oi borden get back here
all lauging
thank you
shut up
laughing continues
where the bloody key
distant electrical humming
angier february 8 899
today finally a breakthrough
tesla agreed to see me
electrical zapping
perfectly safe
so this is the great danton
mr alley has effused about your act
to me on any number of occasions
hold out other hand
what conducting the electricity
our bodies mr angier
quite capable of conducting
and indeed producing energy
have you eaten mr angier
chuckling i need something impossible
youre familiar with the phrase
man reach exceeds his grasp
is a lie
man grasp exceeds his nerve
society only tolerates
one change at a time
first time i tried to change the world
i was hailed as a visionary
second time
i was asked politely to retire
so here i am enjoying my retirement
nothing is impossible mr angier
what you want is simply expensive
if i were to build for you this machine
you would be presenting it
merely as illusion
well if people actually
believed the things i did on stage
they wouldnt clap theyd scream
think of sawing a woman in half
have you considered the cost of this
price is not an object
perhaps not but have you
considered the cost
im not sure i follow
go home forget this thing
i can recognize an obsession
no good will come of it
hasnt good come of your obsessions
at first but i have
followed them too long
i am their slave
and one day
they will choose to destroy me
if you understand an obsession then
you know you wont change my mind
so be it
will you build it
ive already begun
to build it mr angier
i hope you enjoy the mountain air
this will take some time
deep inhale exhale
uh i thought youd gone
i dont really have anywhere to go
youve been sleeping here
cutter said itd be all right till we
get another booking what are you doing
uh research
part of a magician job
is to watch his competition
see what illusions
youre going to do something
to that man arent you
cutter hoping you let things lie
he says if borden thinks
things are even between you
even
my wife for a couple of his fingers
he has a family now
and he performing again
borden is out there living
his life just as he intended
as if nothing had happened
and look at me
im alone and no theater will touch me
us
youre going to need a better disguise
i need a volunteer
wenscombe what happened
did you hurt him
what happened robert
you sir just a rubber ball yes
thank you
just a rubber ball no
not normal not a normal rubber ball
it magic
he had a new trick
wenscombe was it good
it was the greatest
magic trick ive ever seen
door opens
minimal applause
angier did they applaud
when you saw it
it was too good it was too simple
the audience hardly had time to see it
he a dreadful magician
a wonderful magician
he a dreadful showman
he doesnt dress it up
how to sell it
how does he do it
he uses a double
no it too simple
this is a complex illusion
you say that because
you dont know the method
it a double that comes out
it the only way
ive seen him perform it three times
the prestige is the same man
no it not
the same man comes out of the cabinet
it the same man
he wears padded gloves
to hide his damaged fingers
but if you look closely you can tell
he doesnt know how to sell it
to an audience but i do
yeah we could use it
as a climax to the show
yes
the man stole my life
im gonna steal his trick
we got to find someone
who looks like you
he doesnt use a double
i dont know how borden does it
either you either wait for him
to retire and buy the secret
or you listen to how i would do it
and the only way
that i know how to do it
is to find you a bloody good double
all right
take a good look
let get out there and find me
whoo
look look
what that
it for you
what this for
come
sarah you
i asked you last week
you caught me in a wrong mood
but you wont ever
sarah

to change my mind arent i

wenscombe giggles

yes are you laughing now
chuckling
i have to take a piss
he out of his mind

he perfect he needs a little help
but when i get done with him
he could be your brother
i dont need him to be my
brother i need him to be me
give me a month
so you open the door
and
chuckling
exhales
come on
groans
chuckling
couldnt you have found a softer one
well it not for sleeping on
so if you come down through there
does root go up through there
yep
it going to be amazing
well it has to be borden
trick is getting noticed
the place was packed today
you went and saw his show again
ready to meet yourself mr angier
root sighs
wenscombe giggles
all i have to do is
keep myself stinking drunk
and no one will be able
to tell the difference
have a little faith sir
now would you favor us
with a performance mr root
clapping
youd drink too if you knew
the world half as well as i do
did you think you were unique
ive been caesar ive played faust
how difficult could it possibly
be to play the great danton
you can go back to being
yourself now root for nothing
id rather be him for now
i find it uh amusing
chuckles
my liege
i did deny no prisoners
you look wonderful
oh thank you
root has to keep a low profile
anyone sees him the game up
i dont know how you do things
im not sure i wanna know
have you thought what we should call it
there no point being coy borden
calls his trick the transported man
applause
ladies and gentlemen much
of what youve seen may be termed
as illusions or entertaining trifles
rimshot
applause
alas
drumroll
i cannot claim
this next feat as illusion
watch carefully
you will see no trickery
for no trickery is employed
merely a technique familiar
to certain citizens of the orient
and various holy men of the himalayas
indeed many of you may be
familiar with this technique
but for those of you who
are not do not be alarmed
what youre about to see
is considered safe
applause cheering
applause cheering continues
to our achievement
the manager says he
never seen a reaction like it
at least he saw it i spent
the ovation hiding under the stage
no one cares about
the man who disappears
they care about the one who comes out
i care about the man in the box
thank you i dont know
maybe we could switch before the trick
im the prestige
and root below stage
no the anticipation
of the trick is everything
we need your showmanship
to build up the suspense
once root opens his mouth it over
he cant introduce this trick
of course i can im the great danton
root you bloody fool
get out of that wardrobe and makeup
anyone could walk in here at any minute
congratulations all
life is not full of these
moments we worked hard
we need to celebrate properly
what wrong is it your wife
no it the trick
it isnt good enough
borden trick is nothing
compared to ours he has no style
he doesnt spend the finale
hiding under the stage
i need to know how he does it
why
so i can do it better
i need you to go and work for him
work for him are you joking
youll be my spy
we just got our start
you want me to leave
that how we advance think of it
people are excited by cutter
version imagine what wed do
with the real illusion wed have the
greatest magic act anyone ever seen
he knows i work for you
exactly why hell want to hire you
hell want my secret
why would he trust me
because youre
gonna tell him the truth
hmm
good girl
rattling
you must be curious to see what
so much money has bought you
fitting you should be here
for her maiden voyage
your hat
you might want to stand back
electric zapping
fizzling
i dont understand
perhaps it would be best
if you left us to it
is there a problem mr tesla
no come back next week
next week
next week it will be fine
tesla
just a little temperamental
door closing
interesting workshop
yeah we make do
my name is olivia
i know who you are
here to steal the rest of my show
to give your show what it missing
yeah what might that be
me
chuckles i was just
saying that wasnt i
a woman touch
ive left angier
all right
i want a job
yeah
i know youve no reason to trust me
why wouldnt i trust you
youre only the mistress of my
enemy why wouldnt i trust you
mr borden
alfred
im going to tell you the truth
now that is a slippery notion
in our line of work
isnt it miss wenscombe
i am here because he sent me here
he wants me to work for you
and steal your secret
what does he need my secret for
his trick is topnotch
he vanishes
and then he reappears instantly
on the other side
of the stage mute overweight
and unless im mistaken very drunk
it astonishing how does
he do it and tell me olivia
does he enjoy taking his bows
under the stage
it killing him he obsessed
with discovering your methods
he thinks of nothing else
takes no pleasure in our success
and ive had enough
there is no future with him
he sent me here to steal your secrets
but ive come to offer you his
this is the truth is it
think youd better get dressed sir
root youre late and more drunk than
usual get down below stairs right away
no
no we need to have
a little chat mr cutter
we have a problem cutter borden
is performing right across the street
yeah we have a bigger problem
root he realized
that he can make demands
wha he blackmailing us
i was surprised to tell you the truth
it usually takes them
a lot longer to figure it out
how much does he want
it makes no difference
weve got to stop doing the trick
stop the trick look at this
last week they said you were
the premier stage performer in london
not magician mind you
performer of any kind
what your point
my point is youve climbed too high
to get away with
professional embarrassment
we dont do any tricks we cant control
just pay him for now we keep
doing the trick until borden opens
and then well phase it out
all right
angier cutter was always surprised
how fast root turned bad
to what do i owe the pleasure
of this rather welcome pint of ale
youre the great danton arent you
sh sh sh sh sh
of course i am but dont advertise it
because ill be mobbed with fans
angier we paid him enough
to keep him in beers
you wouldnt expect him
to rock the boat
many of you may be
familiar with this technique
but for those of you
who arent do not be alarmed
what youre about to see
is considered safe
and who are you
i am a humble admirer
and a fellow practitioner
mmm very good
grunts
borden another one
oh if you insist
borden another
im not performing tonight
im only doing one show
but to be frank
my people pretty much
run things these days
get up there
get up
your illusion the transported man
im not claiming to know your methods
but i had a similar trick in my act
and uh whispering i used a double
mm i see very good
well it was and then it went bad
what i didnt count on was that
when i incorporated this bloke
into my act
he had complete power over me
complete power you say
laughing
applause
grunting
ohh laughs
be very careful giving
someone that power over you
huh thank you um
yes thank you for the warning
hmm cheers
i cannot claim
this next feat as illusion
what youre about to see
is considered safe
ahh
moaning
crowd laughing
applause
chuckling
laughing applause
oh the great danton
i apologize
there simply is too much magic
for my stage at the pantages
across the street
pardon my intrusion
and go easy on the poor chap
he does try so very hard
all laughing applauding
i dont know how borden found him
kept him under wraps i was careful
yeah well he did
do you think it was her
you werent expecting me
i expected you sooner
your message said afternoon
it takes a bit for me
to get around these days
he taken everything from me
my wife my career
now you
you sent me
i sent you to steal his secret
not to improve his act
it my job
or fall in love
i did everything you asked
yes yes
how does he do it
cutter was right a double
course he said that
he didnt say it
ive seen things makeup glasses wigs
we dont use for the show
ive seen it hidden backstage
misdirection
he leaves them lying
around to make you think that
he doesnt know when im looking
all the time olivia that who he is
that what it takes
he lives his act dont you see
just because youre sleeping
with him doesnt mean he trusts you
you think you can see
everything dont you
the great danton is a blind fool
his notebook
you stole it
i borrowed it for tonight
i thought you could translate
some of it
i cant no one can it a cipher
even with the keyword
it will take months to decode
and without the keyword
perhaps never
well see
we will not see
if i dont get that back by
tomorrow hell know i took it
leave him
i cant he knows where i live
this is his diary olivia all of his
secrets are right here in my hands
it wont bring your wife back
i dont care about my wife
i care about his secret
sighs grunts
look ill um
ill go to his workshop
and stage a break-in
hell know you took it
yes me not you

robert
i have fallen in love with him

drumroll
cymbal crashes
electrical zapping
applause

gunshot
ahh

unless you give me what i want
which is
your secret
my secret
your method for the transported man
fallon wouldnt tell me
he doesnt talk at all
you have my notebook
useless without the keyword

fallon you hear me fallon
angier how the arm
still attached

same way he always has
the same way as we do
it just that you want something more
well let find out then shall we

a journey ahead of us
to america
robert

i cant im sorry
then the rest is up to me
im sorry
good evening hello darling
laughs
champagne your finest
i didnt know we were going
to be joined for dinner
absolutely we are celebrating
miss wenscombe mr fallon
what are we celebrating
weve hit upon a new trick
havent we
what trick freddie
yes freddie what trick
i am going to bury
myself alive every night
and then someone will come along
and dig me up wonderful
i think he had quite enough
no pour the champagne
pour the sarah dont talk to me
like that im not a bloody child
perhaps it would be better
mr fallon escort her home
my husband being a bore
oh please
i see no reason you should suffer
dont ruin this evening
good night mrs borden
good night freddie
freddie
that my name
not at home
im not always at home am i
couldnt you have at least
taken off the beard
sarah i just came from
the bloody theater just now
all right im out in public
everybody else loves it
why are you being like this
i had a terrible ordeal today
i thought that
something very precious
had been lost to me
so i just wanted
to celebrate just a little
all right what what did you lose
i see more secrets
sarah secrets are my life
our life
no alfred stop this isnt you
stop performing
shudders
i thought i had the place to myself
unexpected guests not very polite
a lot of questions
at first i thought they
worked for the government
no
worse they work for thomas edison
borden today a most
curious development
his assistant came to us
with a proposition
obviously angier has sent her
and told her to admit as much
does he enjoy taking
his bows under the stage
he sent me here to steal your secrets
but ive come to offer you his
this is the truth
is it
no that what he told
me to tell you the truth
is that i loved him and i stood by
him and he sent me to you
like he would send a stagehand
to pick up his shirts
i hate him for that
i could spot angier methods
from the back of the theater
so what could you
possibly have to offer me
you may know his tricks
but you cant understand why
no one sees yours are better
you hide this
i had to look very closely
to spot it
during the transported man
but this makes you unique
it shows you arent using a double
you mustnt hide it
you must display it proudly
im sure it takes great skill
to perform illusions with one good hand
yeah it does
so let people know
you can be so much more than
he is and i can show you how
borden i think
she telling the truth
i think we cannot trust her
but i love her i need her
to open myself to such a relationship
to the dangers of such an affair
i need assurances of fidelity of love
but how to be sure
i know a way it the only
way to know her mind
how could he send you away
borden she must help me
rid ourselves of angier
today my mistress
proves her truthfulness
not to me you understand
ive been
convinced since she led me to root
today olivia proves her love for me
to you angier
yes angier she gave you
this notebook at my request
and yes tesla is merely
the key to my dairy
not to my trick
you really think id part
with my secret so easily after so much
goodbye angier
may you find solace
for your forward ambition
back in your american home
tesla
tesla alley
alley
tesla never made a machine
like the one i asked for
i never said he had
you let me believe that he had
you stole my money because
your funding was cut off
youve been shooting
sparks in my top hat
laughing at me all along
while using my money to stave off ruin
i have seen edison men
where
in the hotel i have a mind
to bring them up here
that would be unwise mr angier
it is true that you are
our last remaining financier
but we have not stolen your money
this is my cat
when i told you i could make you
a machine i spoke a truth
why isnt it working
because exact science mr angier
is not an exact science
the machine simply
does not operate as expected
it requires further examination
so where did my top hat go
nowhere
we tried the damn thing a dozen times
the hat went nowhere
we need to try different material
it may provoke a different result
meowing
great
you are responsible for whatever
happens to this animal doctor
meows
electrical zapping
sighs
i hope whatever you were
really doing with my money
was more worthwhile mr tesla
meowing
cats screeching
screeching continues
hissing
alley
so the machine was working
i never checked the calibration
cause the hat never moved
these things never quite
work as you expect them to
that one of the principal
beauties of science
ill need a couple of weeks to iron out
the problems with the machine
well send word when it ready
dont forget your hat
well which one is mine
they are all your hats
you look so pretty
in this new dress of yours
are we going to the zoo
no daddy has some errands to run
but you promised
i promised did i
then go to the zoo we shall
daddy will go run his errands
and ill be back before you know it
so you go get ready well go
see those chimpanzees hoots
sarah what are you doing
each of us have our vices
sarah whatever you may think
your only competition
for my affections is our little girl
i love you i will always love you
and you alone
you mean it today
absolutely
which makes it so much
harder when you dont
more shopping she does
love the smell of money
the little lady wants to go to the zoo
so i thought you could take her yeah
i mean i can do it tomorrow if not
and uh sarah
she knows
uh at least she knows
that something is not right
so if you can just do
whatever you can to help me
talk to her just
convince her that i do love her
what is it freddie
listen dont call me that please
it nothing it just that
sometimes it seems wrong
i told you when youre
with me youre with me
leave your family at home
where they belong
im trying im trying olivia
ill get dressed
yeah
i saw fallon hanging around again
there something about
that man i dont trust
you trust me then trust fallon
he protects the things
that i care about
engine sputters
were sorry to see you go mr angier
we were sorry to see
mr tesla leave as well
he very good to colorado springs
mr angier
i didnt think it was necessary
to tell edison men about the box
what box
tesla i apologize for leaving
without saying goodbye
but i seem to have outstayed
my welcome in colorado
the truly extraordinary is not
permitted in science and industry
perhaps youll find
more luck in your field
where people are happy to be mystified
you will find what you
are looking for in this box
alley has written you
a thorough set of instructions
i add only one suggestion
on using the machine
destroy it
drop it to the bottom
of the deepest ocean
such a thing will bring you only misery
angier tesla warning is
as unheeded as he knew it would be
today i tested the machine
taking precautions in case
tesla hadnt ironed out
the kinks in its operation
but if it went wrong
i would not want to live
like that for long
electrical zapping
angier but here at the turn
i must leave you borden
yes you borden
sitting there in your cell
reading my diary awaiting your death
for my murder
angier journal that gesture
of good faith that a fake
i assure you it not
the provenance of the journal
is clear and under no doubt
and it written in angier own hand
for which we have numerous examples
it dont matter
so my tricks
all of them
including the transported man
lord caldlow will be very pleased
no he wont
theyre not complete
it just the pledge
and the turn for each
without the prestige for these
tricks these are worthless
yeah
you get the rest of it
when you bring my daughter here
i want to say goodbye
sarah we have to go through it now
we have to go through it now
now listen to me deny it all you want
olivia means nothing
olivia
i need an assistant
ill go to her ill tell her
youll tell her what
i know what you really are alfred
i know
sarah sarah sarah
i cant keep it in
you cant talk like this
no no
sarah shut up sarah shut up
i dont want to hear it anymore
you cant talk like this
sarah you cant hide it anymore
because i know alfred i know
i know what you really are alfred
i cant live like this
oh well you think
i can live like this
you think i bloody enjoy
living like this

what is so wrong with your life
alfred i cant live like this

and no secrets
do you do you love me

no
birds chirping
crashing
birds squawking
seagulls calling
birds fluttering
who there
im looking for an old friend
i heard about a booking
nice little theater
good up-and-coming magician
youre back
it good to see you john
good rehearsal space
blind stagehands i like it laughs
you always had a good eye for publicity
i need your help john
it my last show a limited engagement
your last show
a wise man once told me obsession
was a young man game
im almost done there one thing left
the real transported man
you want to design a show around it
i dont want you backstage
i need you in front managing
call in any favors
or connections you have left
to get us the right booking
what sort of booking you after
the sort that borden cant ignore
oh what an honor it is
to see you again sir
you told me you only wanted to show me
one trick thatd pique my interest
it a very clever trick
pleased to meet you mr ackerman
likewise im sure
let get on shall we
turn it on gentlemen
very pretty
that it cutter he simply disappears
that not a trick he has to come back
there has to be a
angier a prestige
exactly
pardon me
it very rare to see
real magic
it been many years since
are you interested in helping us
yes but youll have
to dress it up a little
disguise it
give them enough reason to doubt it
you havent spoken
about her freddie not once
why would i talk about her to you hm
because she was a part of
your life and now she gone
you know the day before she killed
herself she said she wanted to meet me
that she had something
to tell me about you
i was such a coward
i couldnt bring myself to face her
but
what would she have said
you want to know the truth about me
the truth is that
i never loved sarah
i never loved her
you married her
you had a child with her
yes part of me part of me did but
the other part didnt
the part that found you
the part that sitting here right now
i love you no olivia i love you
that the truth
that is the truth that matters
you could be in some other restaurant
with some other woman right now
talking about me that way
no
yes
it inhuman to be so cold
he back
after two years he got a new trick
theyre saying it
the best london ever seen
you should see the look
on your face professor
you should go to him
you two deserve each other
but im afraid im booked the moscow
ballet plays through next year
then get rid of them there will be
00 performances no more no less
five performances a week no matinees
that what youll
charge for each ticket good day
applause
footsteps on stage
ladies and gentlemen my first trick of
the evening involves considerable risk
anyone in the audience
who would be irrevocably
damaged by seeing a man drown
should leave now
when i tell you the lady
who taught me this illusion
actually died performing it
youll understand the seriousness
of the dangers involved
let begin
applause
in my travels i have seen the future
and it is a strange future indeed
the world ladies and gentlemen
is on the brink of new
and terrifying possibilities
taps cane
applause
what youre about to witness
is not magic
it purely science
id like to invite you
to come up on stage now
so that you can examine
the machine for yourselves
electrical zapping
crowd murmuring gasping
applause
man reach
exceeds his imagination
applause cheering
bravo
one hundred performances why
does his method dictate that
is it a publicity move what is it
he a no-talent magician
and they call him
the bloody best in england why

you go live your life in full now
all right you live for both of us
goodbye
are you watching closely
put it down on the end
take a minute to consider
your achievement
i once told you about a sailor
who described drowning to me
yes he said it was like going home
i was lying he said it was agony
man alfred borden this day
in the name of the king
and the high court of england
you will meet your end
no one cares about the man in the box
cutter
cutter
man do you have anything to say
abracadabra
gunshot
moans
angier moans
a brother a twin
you were fallon
the whole time
no
we were both fallon
we were both borden
were you the one who went into the box
or the one who came back out
we took turns
the trick is where we would swap
cutter knew cutter knew
but i told him it was
too simple too easy
no
simple maybe but not easy
there nothing easy
about two men sharing one life
i dont understand
how it can be bleeding again
wha what about olivia and your wife
we each loved one of them
i loved sarah
he loved olivia
we each had half of a full life
really which was enough for us
just
but not for them
see sacrifice robert
that the price of a good trick
you wouldnt know
anything about that would you
groaning
ive ive made sacrifices
no
yes
it takes nothing
to steal another man work
yeah it takes everything
no no wait im not
gunshot
it took courage
it took courage to climb
into that machine every night
not knowing
if id be the man in the box
or in the prestige
do you want to see
what it cost me
you didnt see where you are did you
look look
i dont care
you went halfway around the world
you spent a fortune
you did terrible things
really terrible things robert
and all for nothing
for nothing
borden yeah
you never understood
why we did this
the audience knows the truth
the world is simple
it miserable
solid solid all the way through
but if you could fool them
even for a second
then you could make them wonder
and then you
then you got to see something
very special
you really dont know
it was
it was the look on their faces
inhales deeply
cutter every magic trick
consists of three parts or acts
the first part is called the pledge
the magician shows you
something ordinary
the second act is called the turn
the magician takes
the ordinary something
and makes it into
something extraordinary
but you wouldnt clap yet
because making something disappear
isnt enough you have to bring it back
now youre looking for the secret
but you wont find it because
of course youre not really looking
you dont really want to work it out
you want to be fooled
