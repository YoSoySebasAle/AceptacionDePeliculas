voices not heard
district attorney james lister
was killed in an explosion of a car
belonging to secretary of commerce
bailey
as he left the secretary estate
mr lister killed in the blast
was scheduled to testify
in washington on thursday
before a senate committee
a committee investigating what has
been called the bailey scandal
a team of detectives
has been assigned to the case
secretary bailey was not available
for any statement at this time
did you know them
offices of his legal advisor
irving gold
in hopes of getting some comment
mr gold youre aware
that district attorney lister
is the second witness in the
bailey scandal to meet a sudden end
the first was thomas finney
undersecretary of commerce
who fell to his death from his
5th-floor office a month ago

what keeping you here
the only remaining witness
is the man who
rightly or wrongly has given
his name to this affair
secretary bailey

the secretary has no worries
if he has no worries
why has he retreated to his place
on long island
he preparing his attack
on the questions
he will be asked
by the committee
id call them accusations
more than questions
he has no worries
brentley the public does
particularly in view of the rumors
about rigged contracts
bribery the international mafia
especially those dealing
with the illegal use
of the transport union
pension funds

situation it lies elsewhere

opening night
fifteen years ago

patron saint of the place

as sweet as balm
as soft as air as gentle
oh antony

possession lies a lass unparalleld
downy windows close
and golden phoebus never be beheld
of eyes again so royal

supposed to say after
more than 30 years

turning me down
to become an actress

age cannot wither her
it like the play

no
but i was invited anyway
if you dont know each other

secretary bailey
is a rich businessman
he came to the united states as an
immigrant and made a lot of money
in san francisco and la
where he lived for 30 years
noodles i know all that it all
in the papers what else is there
he married a very wealthy woman
they had a child
she died when the child was born
a few years ago he went
into politics moved here
that history im not talking
about that im talking about now
right now he in trouble
just tell me youve been living
with him all these years
and youre his lover
deborah
age can wither me noodles
were both getting old
all that we have left now
are our memories
if you go to that party on saturday
night you wont have those anymore
tear up that invitation
there an exit back this way
noodles go through it
keep walking
dont turn around
please noodles
im begging you please
are you afraid that ill turn
into a pillar of salt
if you go out that door yes
deborah
this is secretary bailey son
his name david just like yours
i must admit this party was
a wonderful idea mr secretary
it a bit like saying im going
up before the commettee in 5 days
like my conscience is clear
the most important people
in new york are my guests
it going to be a night
to remember
especially if the house blows up
where are you putting the next bomb
in the freezer
or in the toilet
you cant even think straight
anymore
ill tell you something
a waiting list of people would like
to send flowers to your funeral
i can point out ten right now
if you like me to yes
but none of them wants to read my
obituary in front of the committee
as much as you do
you and your union
we just want to resolve
this situation clean
ive heard that same song from you
for 35 fucking years
who do you think you are talking to
i helped you to make a fortune
you and the rest of those parasites
it was a reasonable arrangement
between labour and management
2% for them and 40% for you
you defend them and you screw them
come on
it been the story of your life
do you think anybody believe you
anymore some
but no one believes in you anymore
because you have made mistakes
and i havent
but that beside the point
the important thing right now
is that
you and i straighten out
these transfers of authority
now it all as we have agreed
have had our lawyers drawn it up
all you have to do is sign
my last will
you are not in a position
to exercise your will
i give up everything
2% would be set aside for your boy
in that way he can be assured
of living to a ripe old age
or not if i dont sign
why dont you take care of this
by yourself
id be very happy for you tonight
if during all the noise of the party
i heard a shot
maybe you will
door opens
butler please go in
max what are you waiting for
i dont understand mr bailey
sit down noodles
make yourself comfortable
im glad you accepted my invitation
noodles well i was curious
so many important people
in one place
max yes well the rats usually
desert a sinking ship
but in my case they appear to be
flocking onboard
yeah well i read about
your troubles in the newspapers
but a man in your position
with all your power
and all your privileges
has to assume a certain amount
of responsibility
a certain amount of risk
whyd you ask me
to come here mr bailey
that invitation doesnt mean
a goddamn thing and you know it
all that counts is what
was in that suitcase
the money and the contract
it didnt say who the contract
was on though
havent you figured that out yet
you mr bailey
i havent had a gun in my hand
for many many years
my eyes arent too good even
with my glasses my hands shake
and i wouldnt want to miss
cut the bullshit noodles
im already a dead man
at least give me the chance to
settle the debt that i owe to you
ill never make it before
the investigating committee
theyre scared ill implicate
the whole bunch of em
they gotta get rid of me
today is as good a day as any
you do it noodles
youre the only person
i can accept it from
you see i found out where you were
i brought you back here for this
to even the score
between you and me
you can get out through there
it leads right down to the street
nobody will see you
i dont know what youre talking
about you dont owe me a thing
your eyes were too full of tears
to see it wasnt me burned up
on that street
it was somebody else
you were too shocked to realize
that the cops were in on it too
that was a syndicate operation
noodles
youre crazy
you said that to me once before
a long time ago
my mind was never as clear
as it was at that moment
i took away your whole life
from you
ive been living in your place
i took everything
i took your money
i took your girl
all i left for you was 35 years
of grief over having killed me
now why dont you shoot
it true
i have killed people mr bailey
sometimes to defend myself
sometimes for money
and many people used to come to us
business partners rivals
lovers
some of the jobs we took
and some we didnt
yours is one we would never touch
is this your way of getting revenge
no
it just the way i see things
it 025
and ive got nothing left
to lose
when youve been betrayed
by a friend you hit back
do it
you see mr secretary
i have a story also
a little simpler than yours
many years ago i had a friend
a dear friend
i turned him in to save his life
but he was killed
but he wanted it that way
it was a great friendship
it went bad for him
and it went bad for me too
good night mr bailey
i hope the investigation
turns out to be nothing
itd be a shame to see
a lifetime of work go to waste
truck starts
