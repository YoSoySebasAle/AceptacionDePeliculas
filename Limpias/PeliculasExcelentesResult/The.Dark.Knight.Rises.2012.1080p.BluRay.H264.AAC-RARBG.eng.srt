
i knew harvey dent
i was his friend
and it will be a very long time before
someone inspires us the way he did
i believed in harvey dent
dr pavel im cia
he wasnt alone
uh you dont get to bring friends
they are not my friends
dont worry no charge for them
and why would i want them driver
they were trying to grab your prize
they work for the mercenary
the masked man
bane
aye
get them on board ill call it in
the flight plan i just filed
with the agency
lists me my men dr pavel here
but only one of you
first one to talk gets
to stay on my aircraft
who paid you to grab dr pavel
he didnt fly so good
who wants to try next
tell me about bane
why does he wear the mask
a lot of loyalty for a hired gun
well perhaps he wondering
why someone would shoot a man
before throwing him out of a plane
at least you can talk
who are you
it doesnt matter who we are
what matters is our plan
no one cared who i was
till i put on the mask
if i pull that off will you die
it would be extremely painful
youre a big guy
for you
was getting caught part of your plan
of course
dr pavel refused our
offer in favor of yours
we had to find out what he told you
nothing i said nothing
well congratulations
you got yourself caught
sir
now what the next step of your master plan
crashing this plane
with no survivors
mayday mayday
aah what you doing to me let me out
no
no no no no
no they expect one of us
in the wreckage brother
have we started the fire
yes the fire rises
calm down doctor
now is not the time for fear
that comes later
harvey dent day
may not be our oldest public holiday
but were here tonight
because it one of the most important
harvey dent uncompromising stand
against organized crime
had made gotham a safer place than it was
at the time of his death eight years ago
this city has seen a historic turnaround
no city is without crime but this city
is without organized crime because the dent act
gave law enforcement teeth
in its fight against the mob
now people are talking about
repealing the dent act
and to them i say not on my watch
i want to thank the wayne foundation
for hosting this event
im told mr wayne couldnt be here tonight
im sure he with us in spirit
and now im gonna give way
to an important voice
you ever lay eyes on wayne
at one of these things
no one has not in years
people put their faith
in a murderous thug in a mask and a cape
a thug who showed his true nature
when he betrayed the trust
of this great man
and murdered him in cold blood
sweetheart not so fast with the chow
shrimp balls
thank you
jim gordon can tell you the truth about
harvey dent ill let him tell you himself
commissioner gordon
the truth
i have
written a speech
telling the truth about harvey dent
maybe the time isnt right
maybe right now
all you need to know
is that there are
000 inmates in blackgate prison
as a direct result of the dent act
these are violent criminals essential cogs
in the organized-crime machine
maybe for now all i should say
about the death of harvey dent is this
it has not been for nothing
you see the guy who owns the house
no i heard
he never leaves the east wing
i heard he had an accident
yeah that he disfigured he
has to wear a alfred mr till
why are your people
using the main staircase
and where mrs bolton
uh she at the bar sir can i help
the east drawing room
unlock the door put the tray on the table
lock the door again nothing more
im sorry miss tate
i tried but he wont see you
and you mustnt take it personally
everyone knows that wayne holed up
in there with 8-inch nails
peeing into mason jars
it very good of you
to let me on the grounds
why are you wasting your time
trying to talk to a man
who threw away your investment
on some save-the-world vanity project
he cant get your money back i can
i could try explaining that
a save-the-world project vain or not
is worth investing in mr daggett
but you understand only money
and the power you think it buys
so why waste my time indeed
second shift reports in
you should spend more time
with the mayor
well that your department
anyone shown him the crime stats
he goes by his gut and it bothers him
no matter what the numbers
must be popular with his wife
not really she took the kids to cleveland
hell have plenty of time for visits
the mayor gonna dump him in the spring
really
mm-hm
but he a hero
a war hero this is peacetime
oh sorry sorry
im so terribly sorry mr wayne
it is mr wayne isnt it
although you dont have the long nails
or heh the facial scars sir
is that what they say about me
it just that no one ever sees you
that a beautiful necklace reminds me
of one that belonged to my mother
it cant be the same one
because her pearls are in this safe
the manufacturer clearly explained
is uncrackable
oops
nobody told me it was uncrackable
im afraid i cant let you take those
look you wouldnt beat up a woman
any more than i would beat up a cripple
of course sometimes
exceptions have to be made
good night mr wayne
can i have a ride
you read my mind
let go
miss tate was asking to see you again
she very persistent
and quite lovely
in case you were wondering
i wasnt
what are you doing
examining print dust
weve been robbed
and this is your idea
of uh sounding the alarm is it
she took the pearls
tracking device and all
she
one of the maids
perhaps you should stop letting them
in this side of the house
perhaps you should start learning
to make your own bed
why were you dusting for prints
i wasnt
she was
sir congressman gilly wife
has been calling in
the congressman never made it home
after the wayne foundation event
that a job for the police
when you and dent cleaned the streets
you cleaned them good
pretty soon well be chasing down uh
overdue library books
and yet here you are
like were still at war
what your name son
blake sir
you have something you want to ask me
it about that night this night
eight years ago the night dent died
the last confirmed sighting of the batman
he murders those people
takes down two swat teams
breaks dent neck
and then just vanishes
im not hearing a question son
dont you want to know who he was
i know exactly who he was
he was the batman
let go see about the congressman wife
master wayne
master wayne
you havent been down here in a long time
trying to find out more about
our jewel thief i ran her prints
unless she lost a lot of weight
she was wearing
someone else fingerprints
she good
she may be but we have a trace
on the necklace
we do i cross-referenced the address
she went back to
with police data
on high-end b-and-e and um
selina kyle
the databases are full of close-calls
tips from fences
she good but the ground
is shrinking beneath her feet
we should send the police
before she fences the pearls
she wont she likes them too much
and they werent what she was after
what was she after
my fingerprints
it was printer toner
mixed with graphite on the safe
it gives a good pull and it untraceable
fascinating you two should
exchange notes over coffee
youre trying to set me
up with a jewel thief
at this point id set you up with a chimpanzee
if it brought you back to the world
there nothing out there for me
and that the problem
you hung up your cape and your cowl
but you didnt move on
you never went to find a life
to find someone
alfred
i did find someone
i know and you lost them
but that all part of living sir
but youre not living youre just waiting
hoping for things to go bad again
remember when you left gotham
before all this before batman
you were gone seven year
seven years i waited
hoping that you wouldnt come back
every year i took a holiday
i went to florence
there this café
on the banks of the arno
every fine evening id sit there
and order a fernet branca
i had this fantasy
that i would look across the tables
and id see you there with a wife
maybe a couple of kids
you wouldnt say anything to me
nor me to you
but wed both know that youd made it
that you were happy
i never wanted you to come back to gotham
i always knew there was nothing here
for you except pain and tragedy
and i wanted something
more for you than that
i still do
they wash up here
a couple of times a month
more when it gets colder
homeless sheltering in the tunnels
we pulled him from the basin
but other than that we didnt touch him
what
name jimmy
he from st swithin
it the boys home
where i coach some ball
jimmy hadnt been around for months
no why
blake you know why
he aged out we dont have the resources
to keep boys on after 6
i thought the wayne foundation
gave money for that
not for the past couple of years
he has a brother here doesnt he
mark ill tell him
id like to if that all right
you know what he was doing
in the tunnels
lot of guys been going down the tunnels
when they age out
say you can live down there
say there work down there
work
what kind of work are you
gonna find in the sewers
more than you can find up here i guess
so you know about him
of course
do you think he coming back
i dont know
you brought a date
i like having someone around
to open doors for me
right hand no partials
very nice
mm-hm
not so fast handsome
you got something for me
ah yes
i dont know what youre planning to do
with mr wayne prints
but im guessing youll need his thumb
you dont count so good huh
i count fine
in fact im counting to 0 right now
okay
my friend outside just hit send
this place is a little dead
itll liven up in a minute trust me
is everything okay
great catch you later
hmm
it would have been a lot easier
to just give me what we agreed
we cant have loose ends
and even in that dress
no one gonna miss you
no
but my friend over there
every cop in the city missing him
that cute
but theyre not gonna be looking
in a place like this
i dont know
you did just use his cell phone

he bleeding you gotta help him
i got the congressman

manhole get this up

you three down with me
you two you go down

what they went down there
were gonna go down there right
that was a gas explosion kid
wasnt gas it a sewer
no one goes in till we know what there
we know sir the police commissioner
someone get this hothead out of here
and where that dwp guy
why are you here
answer him
i was asking you
it the police commissioner
and you brought him down here
we didnt know what to do
you panicked
and your weakness has cost the lives
of three others
no he alone
search him
then i will kill you
he dead
so show me his body
the water runs to any one of the outflows
wed never find him
follow him
follow him
you okay you okay
hey hey you awake
i need to see bruce wayne
im sorry mr wayne doesnt take
unscheduled calls
even from a police officer
and if i go get a warrant for
the investigation of harvey dent murder
that still count as unscheduled
what can i do for you officer
commissioner gordon been shot
he chased a gunman
down into the sewers
when i pulled him out he was babbling
about an underground army
a masked man called bane
shouldnt you be telling
your superior officers
they asked me if he saw
any giant alligators
he needs you
he needs the batman
if commissioner gordon thinks
oh he doesnt know or care who you are
but weve met before
it was a long time ago i was a kid
uh st swithin
it used to be funded by
the wayne foundation it an orphanage
my mom died when i was small it was
a car accident i dont really remember it
but my dad got shot a couple years later
over a gambling debt
and i remember that one just fine
not a lot of people know
what it feels like do they
to be angry
in your bones
i mean they understand
foster parents
everybody understands
for a while
and then they want the angry little kid
to do something he knows he cant do
move on
so after a while
they stop understanding
they send the angry kid to a boys home
i figured it out too late
you gotta learn to hide the anger
practice smiling in a mirror
it like putting on a mask
so you showed up this one day
in a cool car
pretty girl on your arm
we were so excited
bruce wayne billionaire orphan
i mean we used to make up stories
about you man legends
and you know with the other kids
that all it was just stories but
right when i saw you
i knew who you really were
id seen that look on your face before
it the same one i taught myself
i dont know why you took the fall
for dent murder
but im still a
believer in the batman
even if youre not
why did you say that your boys home used
to be funded by the wayne foundation
because the money stopped
might be time to get some fresh air
start paying attention to the details
some of those details
might need your help
you check that name bane
he a mercenary
no other known names
him and his men were behind
a coup in west africa
that secured mining operations
for our friend john daggett
now daggett brought them here
or so it seems
ill keep digging
yeah
alfred why did the wayne foundation
stop funding boys homes in the city
the foundation is funded by
the profits of wayne enterprises
there have to be some
time to talk to mr fox i think
ill get him on the phone
no no no do we still have
any cars around the place
yes one or two
i need an appointment at the hospital
for my leg
which hospital
whichever one jim gordon in
i have seen worse cartilage in knees
that good
no that because there is
no cartilage in your knee
and not much of any use
in your elbows or your shoulders
between that and the scar tissue
on your kidneys
the residual concussive damage
to your brain tissue
and the general scarred-over quality
of your body
i cannot recommend that you go heli-skiing
right
we were in this together
then you were gone
the batman wasnt needed any more
we won
based on a lie
and now there evil rising
from where we tried to bury it
the batman has to come back
what if he doesnt exist any more
he must
you took my goddamn wallet didnt you
you f you took my wallet
no i
get out
she took my ah
now
creep
i dont know what he so upset about
there only 60 bucks in here
probably the watch
who that
a stiff can barely
climb out of his sports car
no that bruce wayne
mr wayne over here
im not sure if my assistant
right through here
thank you so much
bruce wayne at a charity ball
miss tate isnt it
even before you became a recluse
you never came to these things
the proceeds go to the big fat spread
it not about charity
it about feeding the ego
of whichever society hag laid this on
actually this is my party mr wayne
oh
and the proceeds will go where they should
because i paid for the big fat spread myself
that very generous of you
you have to invest if you want to restore
balance to the world
take our clean-energy project
sometimes the investment
doesnt pay off
im sorry
you have a practiced apathy mr wayne
but a man who doesnt care about the world
doesnt spend half his fortune to save it
and isnt so wounded when it fails
that he goes into hiding
have a good evening mr wayne
mind if i cut in
thank you
you dont seem happy to see me
you were supposed to be a shut-in
i felt like some fresh air
why didnt you call the police
i have a powerful friend
who deals with things like this
that a brazen costume for a cat burglar
yeah who are you pretending to be
bruce wayne eccentric billionaire
who your date
his wife in ibiza
she left her diamonds behind though
worried they might get stolen
it pronounced ibiza
you wouldnt want these folks realizing
youre a crook not a social climber
you think i care what anyone
in this room thinks of me
i doubt you care what anyone
in any room thinks of you
dont condescend mr wayne
you dont know a thing about me
well selina kyle i know you came here
from your walk-up in old town
a modest place for a master jewel thief
which means that either
youre saving for retirement
or youre in deep with the wrong people
you dont get to judge me because you were
born in the master bedroom of wayne manor
actually i was born in the regency room
i started out doing what i had to
once youve done what you had to
they never let you do what you want to
start fresh
ugh there no fresh
start in today world
any 2-year-old with a cell phone
could find out what you did
everything we do is collated
and quantified everything sticks
is that how you justify stealing
i take what i need from those
who have more than enough
i dont stand on the shoulders
of people with less
robin hood
i think id do more to help someone than
most of the people in this room than you
you think maybe youre assuming
a little too much
maybe youre being unrealistic about what
really in your pants other than your wallet
ouch
you think all this can last
there a storm coming mr wayne
you and your friends better batten down
the hatches because when it hits
youre all gonna wonder how you
ever thought you could live so large
and leave so little for the rest of us
you sound like
youre looking forward to it
im adaptable
those pearls do look better on you
than they did in my safe
but i still cant let you keep them
you you scared her off
not likely
must have lost my ticket
your wife said you were taking a cab home
my wife
just you sir
dont worry master wayne
takes a little time to get back
in the swing of things
bruce wayne as i live and breathe
what brings you out of cryo-sleep
mr wayne
you havent lost your sense of humor
even if you have lost most of my money
actually you did that
if you funnel your entire r and d budget
into a fusion project
that you then mothball
your company is unlikely to thrive
what are my options
well if youre unwilling
to turn on the machine
i cant i cant lucius
well then sit tight
your majority keeps daggett at bay
while we figure out a future for
the energy program with miranda tate
she has supported the project
all the way
she smart and quite lovely
we all just want what
best for you bruce
show her the machine
ill think it over
anything else
nope why
these conversations used to end
with an unusual request
i retired
mm-hm well let me show you
some stuff anyway
just for old times sake
i figured youd have
shut this place down
oh it was always shut down officially
all this new stuff
after your father died wayne enterprises
set up 4 different defense subsidiaries
for years ive been shuttering
and consolidating
all the different prototypes
under one roof
my roof
why
keep them from falling
into the wrong hands
oh now youre just showing off
defense department projects
for tight geometry urban pacification
rotors are configured to maneuver
between buildings without recirculation
what it called
oh it has a long uninteresting
wayne enterprises designation
i just took to calling it the bat
and yes mr wayne it does come in black
works fine except for the autopilot
takes a better mind than mine to fix it
better mind
well i was trying to be modest
a less busy mind
yours
is it really painful
youre very welcome to try it alfred
happy watching thank you sir
not bad
not bad at all
if youre seriously considering
going back out there
you should hear the rumors
surrounding bane
im all ears
there is a prison
in a more ancient part of the world
a pit where men are thrown
to suffer and die
but sometimes
a man rises from the darkness
sometimes the pit sends something back
bane
bane
born and raised in hell on earth
born in a prison
no one knows why or how he escaped
but they do know that once he did
he was trained by ra al ghul
your mentor
bane was a member
of the league of shadows
and then he was excommunicated
and any man who is too extreme
for ra al ghul is not to be trifled with
i didnt realize i was known
for trifling with criminals
that was then
and you can strap up your leg
and put your mask back on
but that doesnt make you
what you were
if this man is everything that you
say he is then the city needs me
the city needs bruce wayne
your resources your knowledge
it doesnt need your body or your life
that time past
youre afraid that if i go back out there
ill fail
no
im afraid that you want to
you cant short the stock because
bruce wayne goes to a party
wayne coming back is change
change is either good or bad i vote bad
on what basis
i flipped a coin
it says rye i said no rye man
hey rookie lose the helmet

well what do you know
sir what about the armed robbers
please just let me go please
one bike pulled off
no hostage should we pursue
negative stay on the batman
he getting away
who do you wanna catch
some robber or the son of a bitch

central heights
and east park side areas
eight years and he has to pick tonight
he drawing the cops off bane
please just let me go
please
we lost him
how could you lose him
he got a lot of firepower
what and you dont
he heading back downtown
then he as dumb as he dresses
close it off gentlemen
like a rat in a trap gentlemen
you might have
the wrong animal there sir
you sure it was him
bane says the batman interfered
but the task was accomplished
what about the men they arrested
he said and i quote
they would die before talking
where does he find these guys
open the champagne
and can we get some girls in here
careful what you wish for
cat got your tongue
you dumb bitch
nobody ever accused me
of being dumb
youre dumb for coming here tonight
i want what you owe me
want doesnt get
nice outfit
those heels make it tough to walk
i dont know
aah
do they
so where is it
where what
the program the clean slate
the ultimate tool for a master thief
with a record
hold it right there
where is it
the clean slate
where you type in someone name
date of birth
in a few minutes theyre gone
from every database on earth
sound a little too good to be true
youre lying
rykin data took it to prototype stage
that why i bought them
but they had nothing
it was a gangland myth
stay back
im not bluffing
they know
they just dont care
youve gotta be kidding me
no guns no killing
where the fun in that
my mother warned me about
getting into cars with strange men
this isnt a car
see you around
youre welcome
i had it under control
those werent street thugs
they were trained killers
i saved your life
in return i need to know what you did
with bruce wayne fingerprints
wayne wasnt kidding about
a powerful friend
i sold his prints to daggett
for something that doesnt even exist
i doubt many people get the better of you
hey when a girl desperate
what he gonna do with them
i dont know
but daggett seemed pretty interested
in that mess at the stock market
miss kyle
so that what that feels like
i see from the television coverage that you
got your taste for wanton destruction back
i retrieved this
arent the police supposed
to be investigating then
they dont have the tools to analyze it
they would if you gave them to them
one man tool is another man weapon
in your mind perhaps but there arent
many things you cant turn into a weapon
alfred enough
the police werent getting it done
perhaps they might have if you
hadnt made a sideshow of yourself
you thought i didnt have it in me
you led a bloated police force on a chase
with a load of fancy new toys from fox
what about when you come up
against him what then
ill fight harder i always have
look his speed his ferocity his training
i see the power of belief
i see the league of shadows resurgent
you said he was excommunicated
by ra al ghul
who leads them now
ra al ghul was the league of shadows
and i beat him
bane is a mercenary
we need to find out what he up to
trades of some kind coded
and my fingerprint
courtesy of selina kyle
get this to fox
he can crack the code and tell us
what trades they were executing
ill get this to mr fox but no more
ive sewn you up ive set your bones
but i wont bury you
ive buried enough members
of the wayne family
youll leave me
you see only one end to your journey
leaving is all i have
to make you understand
youre not batman any more
you have to find another way
you used to talk about finishing
about a life beyond that awful cave
alfred rachel died knowing that
we had decided to be together
that was my life beyond the cave
i cant just move on
she she didnt she couldnt
what if she had
she i cant change that
what if before she died
she wrote a letter
saying she chose
harvey dent over you
and what if
to spare you pain
i burnt that letter
how dare you use rachel to try to stop me
i am using the truth master wayne
maybe it time we all stopped trying to
outsmart the truth and let it have its day
im sorry
youre sorry
you expect to destroy my world
and then think that
were gonna shake hands
no no no
i know what this means
what does it mean
it means your hatred
and it also means losing someone
that i have cared for
since i first heard his cries echo
through this house
but it might also mean saving your life
and that is more important
goodbye alfred
alfred
answering your own door
yeah
page three
seems you made a series of large
put options on the futures exchange
verified by thumbprint
those options expired
at midnight last night
long-term we may be able to prove fraud
but for now youre completely broke
and wayne enterprises is about to fall
into the hands of john daggett
the weapons we cant let daggett
get his hands on applied sciences
applied sciences is all looked up
and off the books
the energy project however
is a different story
miranda tate
let convince the board to get behind her
let show her the reactor
were meeting her there in 35 minutes
so you better get dressed
you brought me out here
to show me this mr fox
bear with me miss tate
please keep hands and feet inside
the car at all times
this is it isnt it
the reactor is beneath the river
so it can be instantly flooded
in the event of a security breach
is bruce wayne really that paranoid
im gonna plead the fifth on that one
i thought you might like to see
what your investment built
no fossil fuels
free clean energy for an entire city
three years ago
a russian scientist published a paper
on weaponized fusion reactions
one week later your reactor
started developing problems
i think this machine works
miranda if it were operational
the danger to gotham would be too great
would it make you feel better to know
that the russian scientist
died in a plane crash six months ago
someone will work out what dr pavel did
someone will figure out a way to make
this power source into a nuclear weapon
i need you to take control
of wayne enterprises
and this reactor
to do what with it
nothing
until we can guarantee its safety
and if we cant
decommission it flood it
destroy the world best chance
for a sustainable future
if the world not ready yes
bruce if you want to save the world
you have to start trusting it
im trusting you
doesnt count you have no choice
i could have flooded this chamber
at any time
im choosing to trust you
please
all right ladies and gentlemen
this meeting will now come to order
id like to point out that we have
a non-board member here
which is highly irregular
even if his family name is above the door
bruce wayne family built this company
and he himself has run it
into the ground sir does anybody disagree
check the share price this morning
crazy gambling on futures has not
only cost mr wayne his seat
it cost us all a lot of money
and he has to go
im afraid he has a point mr wayne
now back to business
mr wayne over here man 2
how it feel to be one of the people
mr wayne theyre towing your car i
didnt know what to do they had paperwork
looks like you need a ride huh
wayne well give you a ride
how the hell did miranda tate get
the inside track on the wayne board
she been meeting with him
sleeping with him

you dont know much of anything do you
where bane
we told him it was urgent
where is that masked
speak of the devil
and he shall appear
what the hell is going on
the plan is proceeding as expected
oh really
do i look like im running
wayne enterprises right now
your hit on the stock exchange
it didnt work my friend
and now you have my construction crews
going around the city at 24 hours a day
how exactly is that supposed to help
my company absorb wayne

ive paid you a small fortune
and this gives you power over me
what is this
your money and infrastructure
have been important
till now
what are you
im gotham reckoning
here to end the borrowed time
youve all been living on
youre pure evil
im necessary evil
no no no no
when you started why the mask
to protect the people closest to me
but you were a loner right
you didnt have any family
there are always people you care about
you just dont realize how much
until theyre gone
the idea was to be a symbol
batman could be anybody
that was the point
well it was damn good to see him back
not everybody agrees
theyll figure that out in the end
you got anything on bane whereabouts
yeah i got 500 pages of tunnel records
and a flashlight
i could use some help actually
you know what drop me in old town
hey hey hey i dont think so
that the way this works
i dont think so
that is the way
he not a mark
and he doesnt have a cent
to his name anyway
yeah it not much
but it more than youve got right now
actually theyre letting
me keep the house
the rich dont even go broke
the same as the rest of us huh
my powerful friend might hope
to change your mind about leaving
and how would he do that
by giving you what you want
it doesnt exist
he says it does
he wants to meet tonight
why
he needs to find bane
says youd know how
tell him ill think about it
okay
i like your place
mr wayne
im sorry they took all your money
no youre not
can we help you officer
uh yeah
john daggett body was just found
in a dumpster about an hour ago
thought you might want to know
why
his name all over these permits i just
pulled to uh map the tunnels under gotham
that mta maintenance uh
sewer construction couple of other things
where did you get to
with the tunnel searches

weve had teams down there
it a huge network
well get more men work a grid
i want him found
yeah the uh masked man were on it
lose the uniform
youre working for me now
we could use some hotter heads
around here
sir that could also be a coincidence
youre a detective now son
youre not allowed to believe
in coincidence any more
nobody answering
no
im on my own now
do you have keys
never needed them
hope you didnt like me for my money
suffering builds character
ill take care of your
parents legacy bruce
who this
where alfred
he left
taking everything
what that
my power been shut off
youre good at that
when i was a child
we had almost nothing
but on the nights when we had a fire
we felt very rich indeed
i assumed your family was wealthy
not always
not when i was young
an old mistake
ive made a few myself
more than a few
we could leave
tonight
take my plane go anywhere we wanted
someday perhaps
not tonight
dont be shy
wayne says you can get me
the clean slate
that depends
on what
on what you want it for
i acquired it to keep it out
of the wrong hands
still dont trust me huh
how can we change that
start by taking me to bane
you asked
from here
bane men patrol the tunnels
and theyre not your average brawlers
neither am i
he behind you
who
me
what do you think youre
just a little further
i had to find a way to stop them
trying to kill me
you made a serious mistake
not as serious as yours i fear
bane
let not stand on ceremony here
mr wayne
peace has cost you your strength
victory has defeated you
theatricality and deception
powerful agents to the uninitiated
but we are initiated arent we bruce
members of the league of shadows
and you betrayed us
us you were excommunicated
by a gang of psychopaths
i am the league of shadows
and im here to fulfill
ra al ghul destiny
you fight like a younger man
nothing held back
admirable but mistaken
oh you think darkness is your ally
but you merely adopted the dark
i was born in it
molded by it
i didnt see the light
until i was already a man
by then it was nothing to me
but blinding
the shadows betray you
because they belong to me
i will show you where
i have made my home
whilst preparing to bring justice
then i will break you
your precious armory
gratefully accepted we will need it
ah yes i was wondering
what would break first
your spirit
or your body
get me commissioner gordon i got a line
on the congressman kidnapping
excuse me miss
uh yes
im gonna need to see your ticket
and identification please
oh do you mind
i showed your picture to
the congressman guess what
dont tell me still in love
oh head over heels
pressing charges though
youve made some mistakes ms kyle
girl gotta eat
and you have an appetite
why would you run
you cant hide with a record like this
maybe it not you im running from
who then bane
what do you know about him
that you should be as afraid of him
as i am
we can offer you protection
okay
when i spotted you i was looking
for a friend of mine bruce wayne
did they kill him
im not sure
why didnt you just
kill me
you dont fear death you welcome it
your punishment must be more severe
torture
yes
but not of your body
of your soul
where am i
home
where i learned the truth about despair
as will you
there is a reason why this prison
is the worst hell on earth
hope
every man who has rotted here
over the centuries
has looked up to the light
and imagined climbing to freedom
so easy
so simple
and like shipwrecked men turning
to seawater from uncontrollable thirst
many have died trying
i learned here there can be
no true despair without hope
so as i terrorize gotham
i will feed its people hope
to poison their souls
i will let them believe
that they can survive
so that you can watch them clambering
over each other to stay in the sun
you can watch me torture an entire city
and then when you have truly understood
the depth of your failure
we will fulfill ra al ghul destiny
we will destroy gotham
and then when it is done
and gotham is
ashes
then you have my permission to die
youre looking her up in here
the dent act allows non-segregation
based on extraordinary need
first time she broke out
of women correctional she was 6
little closer baby
why honey you wanna hold my hand
she gonna be fine
i still dont see the need of a
board meeting for the energy project
bruce got a lot of things right
keeping the board in the dark
was not one of them
how good of you to join us
chair president
all i need now is one more
ordinary board member
mr fox would you like to nominate
no
i will volunteer
where are you taking us
you were right commissioner
will you excuse us please
what happened
your masked man kidnapped
the wayne enterprises board
he let most of them go
but he took three into the sewers
no more patrols no more hide and seek
get every available cop down there
and smoke him out
the mayor wont want panic
so it a training exercise
im sorry i didnt take you seriously
not you
youre telling me the batman gone
so you chase up the daggett leads
any way you can
yes sir
he asks how much you would pay us
to let you die
i told him i told him you have nothing
do it for the pleasure
they pay me more than that
to keep you alive
he will try the climb
has anyone ever made it
of course not
he says there is one who did
a child
a child born in this hell
bane
an old legend nothing more
dont
whatever it is they want you to see
it happening soon
fire in the hole
turn it on
i only need one other board member
there are eight others waiting
i wont do it
all right stop
lucius youll kill this man
and yourself
and youll barely slow them down
go on then do your work
take them up to the surface
people of their status
deserve to experience
the next era of western civilization
ive been to half of daggett cement plants
and locations they poured underground
anything strange about the pourings
honestly commissioner i dont know
anything about civil engineering
but you know about patterns
keep looking
it done
this is now a 4-megaton nuclear bomb
pull the core out of the reactor
no you cannot
this is the only power source
capable of sustaining it
if you move it
the core will decay in a matter of months
five by my calculations
and then it will go off
and for the sake of your children
dr pavel
indeed i hope it does
hey hey
that was you in front
of the stock exchange wasnt it
when
when
when cops were trying to pull onto castle
street and your truck was shutting them out
oh yeah youre the cop
detective now
and uh as a detective were not
allowed to believe in coincidence
what were you doing here
what are you working on
commissioner it blake
i got two dead witnesses
and a lot of questions call me whenev
wait a minute im looking at
four barrels of polyisobutylene
that looks like motor oil right next to it
jesus theyre not making cement
theyre making explosives
patch me in to foley
foley overseeing the operation
theyre heading into a trap
were seeing thousands of police
heading into the sewers
mr mayor literally thousands
it a training exercise that all
now if youll excuse me ive got tickets
to watch our boys thrash rapid city
foley
it a trap pull everyone out
bane has been pouring concrete
laced with explosives
where
oh say can you see
by the dawn early light
what so proudly we hailed
at the twilight
there a ring around the tunnels
theyre gonna blow it and trap
the cops underground
pull them out pull them out now
through the perilous fight
oer the ramparts we watched
were so gallantly streaming
and the rockets red glare
the bombs bursting in air
gave proof through
that a lovely lovely voice
that our flag was still there
oh say does that star-spangled banner
yet wave
oer the land of the free
and the home of the brave
let the games begin
everybody okay
let move move move
go go
gotham
take control
take control of your city
foley
jesus blake
every cop in the city in those tunnels
not every cop
sir are you okay im a police officer
i need your car right now
clear the corners rookie
get my coat son
this
this is the instrument of your liberation
satellite shows a radiation spike
whatever it is it nuclear
identify yourself to the world
dr leonid pavel nuclear physicist
pavel was confirmed dead
plane crash on an agency pull
out of uzbekistan but
it looks like it him
and what what is this
it a fully primed neutron bomb
with a blast radius of six miles
and who is capable of disarming
such a device
only me
only you
thank you good doctor
now this bomb is armed
and this bomb is mobile
and the identity of the triggerman
is a mystery
for one of you holds the detonator
now we come here
not as conquerors
but as liberators to return control
of this city to the people
and at the first sign of interference
from the outside world
or from those people
attempting to flee
this anonymous gothamite
this unsung hero will trigger the bomb
for now martial law is in effect
return to your homes
hold your families close
and wait
tomorrow you claim
what is rightfully yours
pull back the fighters
start high-level reconnaissance flights
get the president on the line
tanks and planes
cannot stop us from detonating our device
send an emissary to discuss terms of access
for supplies and communication
how many of you are there son
you dont have enough men to stop
2 million people from leaving this island
no no we dont
but you do
now why the hell would i try
to help you keep your hostages
if one person crosses this bridge
gotham gets blown to hell
the people of our greatest
city are resilient
they have proven this before
and they will prove it again
we do not negotiate with terrorists
but we do recognize realities
as this situation develops
one thing must be understood
above all others
people of gotham
we have not abandoned you
what does that mean
it means were on our own
i have to get in front of a camera
they will kill you the second
you show your face
bane says he giving gotham back
to the people they need to know i could lead
bane not gonna let that happen
then hell show his true colors
and youll be dead
behind you stands a symbol of oppression
blackgate prison
where a thousand men have languished
under the name of this man
harvey dent
who has been held up to you
as the shining example of justice
were just gonna keep moving you
till we can get you in front of the camera
you have been supplied
with a false idol to stop you
tearing down this corrupt city
yes yes yes
let me tell you the
truth about harvey dent
from the words of gotham
police commissioner
james gordon
the batman didnt murder harvey dent
he saved my boy
then took the blame
for harvey appalling crimes
so that i could to my shame
build a lie around this
fallen idol
i praised the madman
who tried to murder my own child
well i can no longer live with my lie
it is time to trust the people of gotham
with the truth
and it is time for me to resign
and do you accept this man resignation
and do you accept the resignation
of all of these liars
of all the corrupt
those men locked up
for eight years in blackgate
and denied parole under the dent act
it was based on a lie
gotham needed a hero
well it needs it now more than ever
but you betrayed everything you stood for
there a point far out there
when the structures fail you
when the rules arent
weapons any more
theyre shackles
letting the bad guy get ahead
one day you may face
such a moment of crisis
and in that moment
i hope you have a friend like i did
to plunge their hands into the filth
so that you can keep yours clean
your hands look plenty filthy to me
commissioner
we take gotham from the corrupt
the rich
the oppressors of generations
who have kept you down
with myths of opportunity
and we give it back to you
the people
gotham is yours
none shall interfere do as you please
but start by storming blackgate
and freeing the oppressed
open it
step forward those who would serve
for an army will be raised
the powerful will be ripped
from their decadent nests
and cast out into the cold world
that we know and endure
courts will be convened
spoils will be enjoyed
blood will be shed
the police will survive
as they learn to serve true justice
this great city
it will endure
gotham will survive
he says you must first fix your back
how does he know
he was the prison doctor
he a morphine addict
who incurred the displeasure
of powerful people
including your masked friend
how
many years ago it was a time of plague
some of the other prisoners attacked bane
the doctor fumbling attempts
to repair the damage
left him in perpetual agony
the mask holds the pain at bay
bane was the child you spoke of
he was born here
the legend is that there was a mercenary
who worked for a local warlord
he fell in love with
the warlord daughter
they were married in secret
when the warlord found out
the mercenary was condemned to this pit
but then he exiled him instead
the mercenary understood that it was
the daughter who had secured his release
but what he could not know
was the true price of his freedom
she took his place in the pit
and she was with child
the mercenary child
innocence cannot flower underground
it has to be stamped out
one day the doctor forgot
to lock the cell
but the child had a friend
a protector who showed the others
that this innocence was their redemption
it was to be prized
the mother was not so lucky
this is bane prison now
he wouldnt want this story told
there a vertebra protruding
from your back
it has to be put back
stay like this until you stand
tsk tsk tsk did you
not think i would return bruce hmm
i told you i was immortal
i watched i watched you die
oh there are many forms of immortality
once i had a wife
my great love
she was taken from me
you were the mercenary
bane is your child
your heir
an heir to ensure
the league of shadows fulfills its duty
to restore balance to civilization
no
you yourself fought the decadence
of gotham for years
with all your strength
all your resources
all your moral authority
and the only victory you could
achieve was a lie
now you understand
gotham is beyond saving
no
and must be allowed to die
no
yeah just lift your head
oh that good
no no
what that
this was someone home
and now it everyone home
there a storm coming remember
this is what you wanted
it for the bus
in case there a chance to evacuate
any news is the commissioner
the less you know father
how are the boys doing
well weve had more power on
so theyve got some tv
it good to see you
blake you be careful out there
theyre hunting down cops like dogs
why build yourself
im not meant to die in here
here there what the difference
i told you it could not be done
you told me a child did it
but no ordinary child
a child born in hell
forged from suffering
hardened by pain
not a man from privilege
we got boots on the ground sir
just waiting on intel
you have id
of course not
well how can we trust you
we dont have any choice
commissioner gordon
captain jones special forces
captain glad to have you here
it our job sir
now uh how many of you are there
well there dozens
id rather not say exactly
but the men trapped underground
number almost 3000
condition
getting food and water
can we break them out
yes sir
take out the mercenaries
south of ackerman park
blow the rubble make a hole
big enough for 0 at a time
im in contact with my partner
who down there theyre just waiting
men who havent seen daylight in months
officers who havent seen daylight in months
what about the bomb satellite
cant pick up radiation hot spots
they keep it on a truck
it must have a lead-lined roof
they move it constantly
good so you know the truck
well it one of three
weve been tracking it
decoy
you dont really think he coming back
doesnt matter what i think
actually it does you should put your
faith in something a little more real
the routes dont vary much
okay what about the triggerman
no leads it a bluff bane wouldnt give
control of that bomb to someone else
we cant take that chance until we have
the triggerman we just track the device
and meanwhile gotham lives under
a warlord like some failed state
dial it back officer
this situation is unprecedented
we cant do anything to risk millions of lives
you gonna tell him what really going on
captain the situation is more
complicated than you think
there someone you need to meet
came upstairs looking for a vantage point
found the people who run the corporation
what corporation
wayne enterprises you good
mr fox would you like to brief
the captain
miss tate fully aware of the situation
and as ceo of wayne enterprises
i have to take responsibility for it
why
we built it
you built the bomb
it was built as a fusion reactor
first of its kind
bane turned the core into a bomb
and removed it from the reactor
here the important part
as the device fuel cells deteriorate
it becomes increasingly unstable
to the point of detonation
this bomb is a time bomb
and it will go off in 23 days
regardless of bane revolution
or what we or the outside world
choose to do
so your plan might not be
as practical as you thought
could you disarm it
i could reconnect it to the reactor stabilize it
let move from this location and call it in
right let go
no no well take it from here
you stay and look after these folks
someone sold us out
go go go
ill die before i talk
im on your schedule captain
there were people living upstairs
round them up forjudgment
and hang them where the world can see
police have cordoned off the entire
central heights and east park side areas
as well as merchant and south shoreline
boulevards in an attempt
he says the leap to freedom
is not about strength
my body makes the jump
survival is the spirit the soul
my soul is as ready to escape as my body
fear is why you fail
no im not afraid
im angry
bruce
why do we fall
you do not fear death
you think this makes you strong
it makes you weak
why
how can you move faster than possible
fight longer than possible
without the most powerful impulse
of the spirit
the fear of death
i do fear death
i fear dying in here
while my city burns
there no one there to save it
then make the climb
how
as the child did
without the rope
then fear will find you again
ah supplies for your journey
oh that wonderful that
what does that mean
rise
no
no there been a mistake
take me to bane
i want to see bane
order
this is a mistake where is bane
there been no mistake mr stryver
you are philip stryver
executive vice president
of daggett industries
who for years has been living off
the blood and sweat
of people less powerful than him
call bane i am one of you
bane has no authority here
this is merely a sentencing hearing
now the choice is yours
exile or death
order
exi exile
sold
to the man in the cold sweat
you follow the thick ice
you try to swim youre dead in minutes
has anyone made it
where are they
it not like we have a lot of time
how long
the bomb goes off tomorrow

they might hit the button when it starts
when what starts
war
you missed a spot

the mask is not for you
it to protect the people you care about
count to five then throw
no offense but you got
something bigger in that belt

all-out assault on bane

in case we fail
lead an exodus
save as many lives as you can
you dont need me here
youve given me an army
now go
hey thanks
dont thank me yet
well i might not get a chance later
you shouldnt have
the midtown tunnel
blocked by debris
but the cannons have enough firepower
to make a path for people
wait until the fighting begins
youre gonna wage a war
to save your stuck-up girlfriend
to start it throttle
i got it

i am
and though im not ordinary
i am a citizen
miranda
why
talia
my mother named me talia
before she was killed
the way i would have been killed
if not for my protector
bane
goodbye
i climbed out of the pit
i found my father
and brought him back
to exact terrible vengeance
but by that time
the prisoners and doctor had done
their work to my friend
my protector
the league took us in
trained us
but my father could not accept bane
he saw only a monster
his very existence was a reminder
of the hell hed left his wife to die in
he excommunicated bane
from the league of shadows
his only crime was that he loved me
i could not forgive my father
until you murdered him
he was trying to kill millions
of innocent people
innocent is a strong word
to throw around gotham bruce
i honor my father by finishing his work
vengeance against the man who killed him
is simply a reward for my patience
you see
it the slow knife
the knife that takes its time
the knife
that waits years without forgetting
then slips quietly between the bones
that the knife
that cuts deepest
please
maybe your knife
was too slow
the truck is under attack
gordon
you gave him a way to block my signal
no matter
he bought gotham  minutes
come on
this way
stay there what are you doing
blake mcu
im getting these boys to safety
youll get us all killed
if anyone crosses this bridge
theyll blow the city
it gonna blow anyway
we need to open this bridge now
detective if you take one step forward
we will shoot you
if you take two steps forward
we will blow the bridge
okay go back by the bus and wait for me
all right go back and wait
prepare a convoy we must secure
the bomb until it detonates
dont kill him
i want him to feel the heat
feel the fire of 2
million souls you failed
goodbye my friend
goodbye
keep moving forward
flank them at the stairs
shoot them
shoot them all
we both know that i have to kill you now
youll just have to imagine the fire
about the whole no-guns thing
im not sure i feel as strongly
about it as you do
pull up
stay level
we have to force that convoy east
to the entrance to the reactor
i need you on the ground
ill be in the air go
the situation has changed
your orders are out of date
im a cop like you
and im walking out there
please do not shoot me
shoot at his feet
nothing like a little air superiority
detective please stop
please detective stop
stop walking
blow it do it
you have to get that bomb here
youve got 0 minutes
theyre pushing us
to the entrance of the reactor
theyre gonna try to reconnect the core

yeah follow your orders
all right boys get in a circle
bow your heads
it on my side

on the bus okay go go go
back on the bus
there nowhere to go
on the bus
youve got to turn the truck east
stay straight

we can get a cable on it
fox showed me how to override
the reactor
oh dear
including the emergency flood
there no way
this bomb
will be stopped
what are you doing
protection from the blast
were gonna be all right
it an atom bomb
think they need to hear that
let them die without hope come on
prepare yourselves
my father work
is done
what are you doing
i can get it out over the bay
set it to fly out
over the water then eject
no autopilot
you couldve gone anywhere been anything
but you came back here
so did you
i guess were both suckers
i never cared who you were
and you were right
shouldnt the people know
the hero who saved them
a hero can be anyone
even a man doing something
as simple and reassuring
as putting a coat around a young boy
shoulders to let him know
the world hadnt ended
bruce wayne
come on there you go
okay you too come on father
hey heads down this is it
no
no that batman
that detonation
it out over the bay clear of the city
i see a beautiful city
and a brilliant people
rising from this abyss
i see the lives for which
i lay down my life
peaceful
useful prosperous and happy
i see that i hold a sanctuary
in their hearts
and in the hearts
of their descendants
generations hence
it is a far far better thing that i do
than i have ever done
it is a far far better
rest that i go to
than i have ever known
im so sorry
i failed you
you trusted me
and i failed you
can i change your mind
about quitting the force
you know what you said about
structures becoming shackles
you were right and i cant take it
the injustice
i mean no one ever gonna know
who saved an entire city
they know
it was the batman
mr wayne will was not amended
to reflect his more modest estate
nonetheless there are considerable
assets to dispose of
the contents of the house are to be sold
to settle the estate accounts
and the remainder is left in its
entirety to alfred j pennyworth
the house and grounds are left to
the city of gotham on condition that
they never be demolished
altered or otherwise interfered with
and that they shall be used for
one purpose and one purpose only
the housing and care of the city
at-risk and orphaned children
my clerk can help with the smaller
correspondences and instructions
blake john

uh try my legal name
you should use your full name
i like that name
robin
