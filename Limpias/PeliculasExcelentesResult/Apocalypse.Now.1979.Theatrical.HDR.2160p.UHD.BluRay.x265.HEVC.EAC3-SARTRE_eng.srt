your courage in any other way
right well

yes sir ive heard the name
jesus
operations officer fifth special forces
luke would you play
that tape for the captain please
yes sir im sorry sir
listen to this carefully captain
october 9 0430 hours
sector peter victor king
these were monitored out of cambodia
this has been
verified as colonel kurtz voice
i watched a snail
crawl along the edge
of a straight razor
that my dream
it my nightmare
crawling slithering
along the edge
of a straight razor
and surviving
transmission  received 68
december 30 0500 hours
sector king zulu king
but we must kill them
we must incinerate them
pig after pig---
cow after cow
village after village
army after army
and they call me an assassin
what do you call it when
the assassins accuse the assassin
they lie
they lie and we have to be merciful
for those who lie
those nabobs
i hate them
i do hate them
walt kurtz
was one of the most outstanding officers
this country ever produced
he was brilliant
he was outstanding in every way
and he was a good man too
a humanitarian man
a man of wit and humor
he joined the special forces
and after that
his ideas methods
became
unsound
unsound
now he crossed into cambodia
with this montagnard army of his
that worship the man like a god
and follow every order
however ridiculous
well i have some
other shocking news to tell you
colonel kurtz is about to be
arrested for murder
i dont follow sir murdered who
kurtz had ordered the execution
of some vietnamese intelligence agents
men he believed were double agents
so he took matters into his own hands
well you see willard
in this war things get
confused out there
power ideals the old morality
and practical military necessity
but out there with these natives
it must be a temptation
to be god
because there
a conflict in every human heart
between the rational and the irrational
between good and evil
and good does not always triumph
sometimes
the dark side
overcomes what lincoln called
the better angels of our nature
every man has got a breaking point
you and i have them
walt kurtz has reached his
and very obviously he has gone insane
yes sir very much so sir
obviously insane
your mission is to proceed
up the nung river in a navy patrol boat
pick up colonel
kurtz path at nu mung ba
follow it
learn what you can along the way
when you find the colonel
infiltrate his team by
whatever means available
and terminate the colonel command
terminate the colonel
he out there operating
without any decent restraint
totally beyond the pale
of any acceptable human conduct
and he is still in the field
commanding troops
terminate with extreme prejudice
you understand captain
that this mission does not exist
nor will it ever exist
how many people had i already killed
there were those six
that i knew about for sure
close enough to blow
their last breath in my face
but this time it was
an american and an officer
that wasnt supposed to make
any difference to me but it did
shit charging a man
with murder in this place
was like handing out
speeding tickets at the indy 500
i took tine mission
whet the hell else was i gonna do
but i really didnt know
what id do when i found him
did you check the tank
yeah
i was being ferried
down the coast in a navy pbr
a type of plastic patrol boat
a pretty common sight on the rivers
they said it was a good way
to pick up information and move
without drawing a lot of attention
and that was okay
i needed the air and the time
only problem was i wouldnt be alone
morning captain
the crew were mostly just kids
rock n rollers
with one foot in their graves
how old are you
seventeen
the machinist
the one they called chef
was from new orleans
he was wrapped too tight for vietnam
probably wrapped
too tight for new orleans
lance on the forward 50s
was a famous surfer
from the beaches south of la
to look at him you wouldnt believe
hed ever fired a weapon in his life
clean mr clean
was from some south bronx shithole
and i think the light and space of vietnam
really put the zap on his head
then there was phillips the chief
it might have been my mission
but it sure as shit was the chief boat
there about two points
where we can draw enough water
to get into the nung river
theyre both hot belong to charlie
dont worry about it
dont smoke
you know
ive pulled a few special ops in here
about six months ago
i took a man who was going up
past the bridge at do luong
he was regular army too
i heard he shot himself in the head
good morning vietnam
im army specialist zack johnson on afvn
it about 82 degrees in downtown
saigon right now also very humid
and we have an
important message for all gls
who are living off base
from the mayor of saigon
yeah
hed like you to hang your laundry up
indoors instead of on the windowsills
the mayor wants you
to keep saigon beautiful
and now here another blast
from the past going out to big sam
who all alone out there with
the first battalion 35th infantry
and dedicated by the fire team
at an khe to their groovy co
the rolling stones satisfaction

sayonara
at first i thought
they handed me the wrong dossier
i couldnt believe
they wanted this man dead
third-generation west point
top of his class
korea airborne about 000 decorations
et cetera et cetera
i had heard his voice on the tape
and it really put the hook in me
but i couldnt connect up
that voice with this man
like they said
he had an impressive career
maybe too impressive
i mean perfect
he was being groomed for one
of the top slots in the corporation
general chief of staff anything
in 964 he returned from a tour
with advisory command in vietnam
and things started to slip
his report to the joint chiefs of staff
and lyndon johnson was restricted
seems they didnt dig
what he had to tell them
during the next few months
he made three requests for transfer
to airborne training fort benning
georgia and was finally accepted
airborne
he was 38 years old
why the fuck would he do that
966 joins special forces
returns vietnam

his idea of great r&r was
cold rice and a little rat meat
he had only two ways home
death or victory
no wonder kurtz put
a weed up commands ass
the war was being run
by a bunch of four-star clowns
who were gonna end up
giving the whole circus away
shit
holy shit
chicken time you aint shitting

who is that
what going on
is that you lazzaro
fire on the canopy
i got it get out of there
get out i got it yeah i got it
lance get down
put that fucker out man
what the fuck they think theyre doing
late summer autumn 968
kurtz patrols in the
highlands coming under frequent ambush
the camp started falling apart
november
kurtz orders assassination
of three vietnamese men and one woman
two of the men were colonels
in the south vietnamese army
enemy activity in his old
sector dropped off to nothing
guess he must have hit
the right four people
he joined the special forces
and after that his
the army tried one last
time to bring him back into the fold
methods
and if hed pulled over
it all would have been forgotten
unsound
but he kept going
now he crossed into cambodia
and he kept winning it his way
with this montagnard army of his
and they called me in
man like a god and follow
every order however ridiculous
they lost him
he was gone
nothing but rumors
and random intelligence
mostly from captured vc
the vc knew his name by now
and they were scared of him
he and his men were playing hit and run
all the way into cambodia
i know where im going
im going to the white house
to have dinner with the
president of the united states baby
that where im going
hey chef put the cover on that
clean
how long has that kid been on this boat
seven months
he really
specializing in busting my balls
very possible captain
he thinks the same of you
oh yeah what do you think chief
i dont think
my orders say im not supposed to know
where im taking this boat so i dont
but one look at you and i know
it gonna be hot wherever it is

klicks above the do luong bridge

were not supposed to be in cambodia
but that where im going
you just get me close to my destination
and ill cut you and the crew loose
all right captain
dear son
im afraid that both you
and your mother will have been worried
at not hearing from me
during the past weeks
but my situation here
has become a difficult one
i have been officially
accused of murder by the army
the alleged victims were
four vietnamese double agents
we spent months uncovering
them and accumulating evidence
when absolute proof was completed
we acted we acted like soldiers
the charges are unjustified
they are in fact
and in the circumstances
of this conflict quite completely insane
in a war there are many moments
for compassion and tender action
there are many moments for ruthless
action what is often called ruthless
what may in many circumstances
be only clarity
seeing clearly what there
is to be done and doing it
medevac come in
directly quickly awake
alpha tango tango
echo tango alpha
looking at it
request dust-off
three maybe four kias over
i will trust you to tell your
mother what you choose about this letter
as for the charges against me
i am unconcerned
medevac come in
i am beyond their timid lying morality
and so i am beyond caring
medevac do you read over

you cant go out into space you know
without like with fractions
what are you gonna land on
one-quarter three-eighths
what are you gonna do when you go
from here to venus or something
that dialectic physics okay
dialectic logic is
there only love and hate
you either love somebody or you hate them
mutt
you mutt
this is the way the fucking world ends
look at this fucking shit were in man
not with a bang a whimper
and with a whimper
im fucking splitting jack
on the river i thought
that the minute i looked at him
id know what to do
but it didnt happen
i was in there with him for days
not under guard
i was free
but he knew i wasnt going anywhere
he knew more about
what i was going to do than i did
if the generals back in nha trang
could see what i saw
would they still want me to kill him
more than ever probably
and what would his people back home want
if they ever learned just how
far from them hed really gone
he broke from them
and then he broke from himself
id never seen a man
so broken up and ripped apart
ive seen the horrors
horrors that youve seen
but you have no right
to call me a murderer
you have a right to kill me
you have a right to do that
but you have no right to judge me
it impossible for words to describe
what is necessary
to those who do not know
what horror means
horror
horror has a face
and you must make a friend of horror
horror and moral terror are your friends
if they are not
then they are enemies to be feared
they are truly enemies
i remember when i was with special forces
it seems a thousand centuries ago
we went into a camp
to inoculate some children
wed left the camp after we had
inoculated the children for polio
and this old man came running after us
and he was crying he couldnt see
we went back there
and they had come
and hacked off every inoculated arm
there they were in a pile a pile
of little arms
and i remember
i cried i wept like
some grandmother
i wanted to tear my teeth out
i didnt know what i wanted to do
and i want to remember it
i never want to forget it
i never want to forget
and then i realized
like i was shot
like i was shot with a diamond
a diamond bullet
right through my forehead
and i thought my god
the genius of that the genius
the will to do that
perfect genuine
complete crystalline pure
and then i realized
they were stronger than me
because they could stand it
these were not monsters
these were men trained cadres
these men who fought with their hearts
who have families who have children
who are filled with love
but they have the strength
the strength
to do that
if i had 0 divisions of those men
then our troubles here
would be over very quickly
you have to have men who are moral
and at the same time who are able
to utilize
their primordial instincts to kill
without feeling without passion
without judgment without judgment
because it judgment that defeats us
i worry that my son might not
understand what ive tried to be
and if i were to be killed willard
i would want someone to go to my
home and tell my son everything
everything i did everything you saw
because there nothing that i detest
more than the stench of lies
and if you understand me willard
you will do this for me
pbr street gang
this is almighty over
pbr street gang this is almighty
standing by over
pbr street gang this is almighty
standing by how do you copy
they were gonna
make me a major for this
and i wasnt even
in their fucking army anymore
everybody wanted me to do it
him most of all
i felt like he was up there
waiting for me to take the pain away
he just wanted to go out like a soldier
standing up
not like some poor wasted
rag-assed renegade
even the jungle wanted him dead
and that who he really
took his orders from anyway
we train young men to drop fire
on people but their commanders
wont allow them to write fuck
on their airplanes
because it obscene
the horror
the horror
calling pbr street gang
pbr street gang this is almighty
do you read me over
pbr street gang
pbr street gang this is almighty
the horror
the horror
