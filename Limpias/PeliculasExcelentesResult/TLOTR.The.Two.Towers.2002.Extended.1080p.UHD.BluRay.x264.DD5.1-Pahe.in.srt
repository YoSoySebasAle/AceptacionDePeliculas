our master grows impatient

dont worry about me pippin
what is it what do you smell
man-flesh
theyve picked up our trail
aragorn
let move
their pace has quickened
they must have caught our scent
hurry
come on gimli
three days and nights pursuit
no food no rest
and no sign of our quarry
but what bare rock can tell
not idly do the leaves of lórien fall
they may yet be alive
less than a day ahead of us come
come gimli were gaining on them
im wasted on cross-country
we dwarves are natural sprinters
very dangerous over short distances
rohan
home of the horse-lords
there something strange at work here
some evil gives speed
to these creatures
sets its will against us
legolas what do your elf-eyes see
the uruks turn northeast
they are taking the hobbits to isengard
saruman
the world is changing
who now has the strength to stand
against the armies of isengard
and mordor
to stand against the might of sauron
and saruman
and the union of the two towers
together my lord sauron
we shall rule this middle-earth
the old world will burn
in the fires of industry
the forests will fall
a new order will rise
we will drive the machine of war
with the sword and the spear
and the iron fists of the orc
i want them armed
and ready to march within two weeks
but my lord there are too many
we cannot all be armed in time
we dont have the means
build a dam block the stream
work the furnaces night and day
we dont have enough fuel
to feed the fires
the forest of fangorn
lies on our doorstep
burn it
yes
we will fight for you
swear it
we will die for saruman
the horse-men took your lands
they drove your people into the hills
to scratch a living off rocks
murderers
take back the lands they stole from you
burn every village
we have only to
remove those who oppose us
it will begin in rohan
too long have these peasants
stood against you
but no more
éothain éothain
you take your sister
youll go faster with just two
papa says éothain must not ride garulf
he is too big for him
listen to me you must ride to edoras
and raise the alarm
do you understand me
yes mama
i dont want to leave
i dont want to go mama
freda i will find you there
quickly
go child
rohan my lord
is ready to fall
théodred
find the king son
mordor will pay for this
these orcs are not from mordor
my lord éomer over here
he alive
théodred
your son is badly wounded my lord
he was ambushed by orcs
if we dont defend our country
saruman will take it by force
that is a lie
saruman the white has ever been
our friend and ally
gríma
gríma
gríma
orcs are roaming freely
across our lands
unchecked unchallenged
killing at will
orcs bearing the white hand of saruman
why do you lay these troubles
on an already troubled mind
can you not see
your uncle is wearied
by your malcontent
your warmongering
warmongering
how long is it since
saruman bought you
what was the promised price gríma
when all the men are dead
you will take your share of the treasure
too long have you watched my sister
too long have you haunted her steps
you see much éomer son of éomund
too much
you are banished forthwith
from the kingdom of rohan
and all its domains
under pain of death
you have no authority here
your orders mean nothing
this order does not come from me
it comes from the king
he signed it this morning
keep breathing that the key
breathe
theyve run as if the very whips
of their masters were behind them
were not going no further
until weve had a breather
get a fire going
merry
merry
i think we might have made a mistake
leaving the shire pippin
what making that noise
it the trees
what
you remember the old forest
on the borders of buckland
folk used to say there was something in
the water that made the trees grow tall
and come alive
alive
trees that could whisper
talk to each other
even move
im starving
we aint had nothing but maggoty bread
for three stinking days
yeah
why cant we have some meat
what about them
theyre fresh
they are not for eating
what about their legs
they dont need those
they look tasty
get back scum
the prisoners go to saruman
alive and unspoiled
alive
why alive
do they give good sport
they have something
an elvish weapon
the master wants it for the war
they think we have the ring
shh
as soon as they find out we dont
were dead
just a mouthful
a bit of the flank
looks like meat back on the menu
boys
pippin
let go
go on
call for help
squeal
no one going to save you now
pippin
a red sun rises
blood has been spilled this night
riders of rohan
what news from the mark
what business does an elf a man
and a dwarf have in the riddermark
speak quickly
give me your name horse-master
and i shall give you mine
i would cut off your head dwarf
if it stood but a little higher
from the ground
you would die before your stroke fell
i am aragorn son of arathorn
this is gimli son of glóin
and legolas of the woodland realm
we are friends of rohan
and of théoden your king
théoden no longer recognizes
friend from foe
not even his own kin
saruman has poisoned the mind
of the king
and claimed lordship over these lands
my company are those loyal to rohan
and for that we are banished
the white wizard is cunning
he walks here and there they say
as an old man hooded and cloaked
and everywhere his spies
slip past our nets
we are no spies
we track a party of uruk-hai
westward across the plain
they have taken two of our friends
captive
the uruks are destroyed
we slaughtered them during the night
but there were two hobbits
did you see two hobbits with them
they would be small
only children to your eyes
we left none alive
we piled the carcasses and burned them
dead
i am sorry
hasufel arod
may these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters
farewell
look for your friends
but do not trust to hope
it has forsaken these lands
we ride north
it one of their wee belts
we failed them
a hobbit lay here
and the other
they crawled
their hands were bound
their bonds were cut
they ran over here
they were followed
the belt
run
tracks lead away from the battle
into fangorn forest
fangorn
what madness drove them in there
did we lose him i think we lost him
im going to rip out
your filthy little innards
come here
trees climb a tree
he gone
merry
let put a maggot hole in your belly
run merry
little orcs
it talking merry
the tree is talking
tree
i am no tree
i am an ent
a tree-herder
a shepherd of the forest
dont talk to it merry
dont encourage it
treebeard some call me
and whose side are you on
side
i am on nobody side
because nobody on my side
little orc
nobody cares for the woods anymore
were not orcs were hobbits
hobbits
never heard of a hobbit before
sounds like orc mischief to me
they come with fire
they come with axes
gnawing biting breaking
hacking burning
destroyers and usurpers curse them
no
you dont understand were hobbits
halflings
shire-folk
maybe you are
and maybe you arent
the white wizard will know
the white wizard
saruman
see see
weve led you out
hurry hobbitses hurry
very lucky we find you
nice hobbit
oh it a bog he led us into a swamp
a swamp yes yes
come master we will take you
on safe paths through the mist
come hobbits come we go quickly
i found it i did
the way through the marshes
orcs dont use it
orcs dont know it
they go around for miles and miles
come quickly
soft and quick as shadows we must be
i hate this place it too quiet
there been no sight nor sound
of a bird for two days
no no birdses to eat
no crunchable birdses
and we are famished yes
famished we are precious
here
what does it eats
is it tasty
it tries to chokes us
we cant eats hobbit food
we must starve
well starve then and good riddance
oh cruel hobbit
it does not care if we be hungry
does not care if we should die
not like master
master cares
master knows
yes
precious
once it takes hold of us
it never lets go
dont touch me
there are dead things
dead faces in the water
all dead all rotten
elves and men and orcses
a great battle long ago
dead marshes
yes yes that is their name
this way
dont follow the lights
careful now or hobbits go down
to join the dead ones
and light little candles
of their own
frodo
gollum
dont follow the lights
gollum
mr frodo
are you all right
so bright
so beautiful
our precious
what did you say
master should be resting
master needs to keep up his strength
who are you
mustnt ask us not its business
gollum gollum
gandalf told me you were
one of the river-folk
cold be heart and hand and bone
cold be travelers far from home
he said your life was a sad story
they do not see what lies ahead
when sun has failed and moon is dead
you were not so very different
from a hobbit once
were you
sméagol
what did you call me
that was your name once wasnt it
a long time ago
my name
my name
sméagol
black riders
hide hide
come on frodo come on
quick they will see us
they will see us
i thought they were dead
dead
no you cannot kill them no
wraiths
wraiths on wings
they are calling for it
they are calling for the precious
mr frodo it all right
im here
hurry hobbits
the black gate is very close
orc blood
these are strange tracks
the air is so close in here
this forest is old
very old
full of memory
and anger
the trees are speaking to each other
gimli
lower your ax
they have feelings my friend
the elves began it
waking up the trees
teaching them to speak
talking trees
what do trees have to talk about
except the consistency
of squirrel droppings
something out there
what do you see
the white wizard approaches
do not let him speak
he will put a spell on us
we must be quick
you are tracking
the footsteps of two young hobbits
where are they
they passed this way
the day before yesterday
they met someone they did not expect
does that comfort you
who are you
show yourself
it cannot be
forgive me
i mistook you for saruman
i am saruman
or rather saruman
as he should have been
you fell
through fire
and water
from the lowest dungeon
to the highest peak
i fought with the balrog
of morgoth
until at last
i threw down my enemy
and smote his ruin
upon the mountainside
darkness took me
and i strayed out of thought
and time
stars wheeled overhead
and every day was as long
as a life age of the earth
but it was not the end
i felt life in me again
ive been sent back
until my task is done
gandalf
gandalf
yes
that was what they used to call me
gandalf the grey
that was my name
gandalf
i am gandalf the white
and i come back to you now
at the turn of the tide
one stage of your journey is over
another begins
we must travel to edoras with all speed
edoras
that is no short distance
we hear of trouble in rohan
it goes ill with the king
yes and it will not be easily cured
then we have run all this way for nothing
are we to leave those poor hobbits here
in this horrid dark dank
tree-infested--
i mean charming
quite charming forest
it was more than mere chance that
brought merry and pippin to fangorn
a great power has been sleeping here
for many long years
the coming of merry and pippin
will be like the falling of small stones
that starts an avalanche
in the mountains
in one thing you have not changed
dear friend
hm
you still speak in riddles
a thing is about to happen that has not
happened since the elder days
the ents are going to wake up
and find that they are strong
strong
oh that good
so stop your fretting master dwarf
merry and pippin are quite safe
in fact they are far safer
than you are about to be
this new gandalf more grumpy
than the old one
that is one of the mearas
unless my eyes are cheated
by some spell
shadowfax
he is the lord of all horses
and has been my friend
through many dangers
o rowan mine
i saw you shine
upon a summer day
upon your head
how golden-red
the crown you bore aloft
such a beautiful verse
is it much further
bru-ra-hroom dont be hasty
you might call it far perhaps
my home lies deep in the forest
near the roots of the mountain
i told gandalf i would keep you safe
and safe is where ill keep you
i believe you will enjoy this next one too
it one of my own compositions
right
beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
and the dreams of trees unfold
when woodland halls are green and cool
and the wind is in the west
come back to me
come back to me
and say my land is best
oh
sleep little shirelings
heed no nightly noise
sleep till morning light
i have business in the forest
there are many to call
many that must come
the shadow lies on fangorn
the withering of all woods
is drawing near
the veiling shadow that glowers
in the east takes shape
sauron will suffer no rival
from the summit of barad-dûr
his eye watches ceaselessly
but he is not so mighty yet
that he is above fear
doubt ever gnaws at him
the rumor has reached him
the heir of númenor still lives
sauron fears you aragorn
he fears what you may become
and so hell strike hard and fast
at the world of men
he will use his puppet saruman
to destroy rohan
war is coming
rohan must defend itself
and therein lies our first challenge
for rohan is weak and ready to fall
the king mind is enslaved
it an old device of saruman
his hold over king théoden
is now very strong
sauron and saruman
are tightening the noose
but for all their cunning
we have one advantage
the ring remains hidden
and that we should seek to destroy it
has not yet entered
their darkest dreams
and so the weapon of the enemy
is moving towards mordor
in the hands of a hobbit
each day brings it closer
to the fires of mount doom
we must trust now in frodo
everything depends upon speed
and the secrecy of his quest
do not regret your decision to leave him
frodo must finish this task alone
he not alone
sam went with him
did he
did he indeed good
yes very good
the black gate of mordor
oh save us
my old gaffer would have a thing or two
to say if he could see us now
master says to
show him the way into mordor
so good sméagol does
master says so
i did
that it then
we cant get past that
look
the gate
it opening
i can see a way down
sam no
master
i do not ask you to come with me sam
i know mr frodo
i doubt even these elvish cloaks
will hide us in there
now
no
no no master
they catch you they catch you
dont take it to him
he wants the precious
always he is looking for it
and the precious is wanting
to go back to him
but we mustnt let him have it
no there another way
more secret a dark way
why havent you spoken of this before
because master did not ask
he up to something
are you saying there another way
into mordor
yes there a path
and some stairs
and then
a tunnel
he led us this far sam
mr frodo no
he been true to his word
no
lead the way sméagol
good sméagol always helps
hello
treebeard
where has he gone
i had the loveliest dream last night
there was this large barrel
full of pipe-weed
and we smoked all of it
and then
you were sick
id give anything for a whiff of old toby
did you hear that
there it is again
something not right here
not right at all
you just said somethingtreeish
no i didnt i was just stretching
youre taller
who
you
than what
than me
ive always been taller than you
pippin everyone knows im the tall one
youre the short one
please merry
youre what three-foot-six at the most
whereas me im pushing 37
three-foot-eight
you did something
merry dont dont drink it
merry
no treebeard said that you
shouldnt have any
i want some
it could well be dangerous
give me it back merry
what happening
it got my leg
merry
no
help
away with you
you should not be waking
eat earth dig deep drink water
go to sleep
away with you
come the forest is waking up
it isnt safe
the trees have grown wild
and dangerous
anger festers in their hearts
black are their thoughts
strong is their hate
they will harm you if they can
there are too few of us now
too few of us ents left to manage them
why are there so few of you
when you have lived so long
are there ent children
bru-ra-hroom
there have been no entings
for a terrible long count of years
why is that
we lost the entwives
oh im sorry
how did they die
die no
we lost them
and now we cannot find them
i dont suppose youve seen entwives
in the shire
cant say that i have
you pip
what do they look like
i dont remember now
edoras and the golden hall
of meduseld
there dwells théoden king of rohan
whose mind is overthrown
saruman hold over king théoden
is now very strong
my lord your son
he is dead
my lord
uncle
will you not go to him
will you do nothing
be careful what you say
do not look for welcome here
oh he must have died
sometime in the night
what a tragedy for the king
to lose his only son and heir
i understand
his passing is hard to accept
especially now that your brother
has deserted you
leave me alone snake
oh but you are alone
who knows what youve spoken
to the darkness
in the bitter watches of the night
when all your life seems to shrink
the walls of your bower
closing in about you
a hutch to trammel some wild thing in
so fair
so cold
like a morning of pale spring
still clinging to winter chill
your words are poison
youll find more cheer in a graveyard
ah
i cannot allow you before théoden king
so armed gandalf greyhame
by order of gríma wormtongue
your staff
hm oh
you would not part an old man
from his walking stick
my lord gandalf the grey is coming
he a herald of woe
the courtesy of your hall
is somewhat lessened of late
théoden king
he not welcome
why should i welcome you
gandalf stormcrow
a just question my liege
late is the hour
in which this conjurer
chooses to appear
láthspell i name him
ill news is an ill guest
be silent keep your forked tongue
behind your teeth
i have not passed
through fire and death
to bandy crooked words
with a witless worm
his staff
i told you to take the wizard staff
théoden
son of thengel
too long have you sat
in the shadows
i would stay still if i were you
hearken to me
i release you
from the spell
you have no power here
gandalf the grey
i will draw you saruman
as poison is drawn from a wound
wait
if i go théoden dies
you did not kill me
you will not kill him
rohan is mine
be gone
i know your face
éowyn
éowyn
gandalf
breathe the free air again my friend
dark have been my dreams of late
your fingers would remember
their old strength better
if they grasped your sword
ive only
ever served you my lord
your leechcraft would have had me
crawling on all fours like a beast
send me not from your sight
no my lord no my lord
let him go
enough blood has been spilt
on his account
get out of my way
hail théoden king
where is théodred
where is my son
simbelmynë
ever has it grown on the tombs
of my forebearers
now it shall cover the grave
of my son
alas that these evil days
should be mine
the young perish and the old linger
that i should live
to see the last days of my house
théodred death
was not of your making
no parent should have to bury
their child
he was strong in life
his spirit will find its way
to the halls of your fathers
they had no warning
they were unarmed
now the wild men are moving through
the westfold burning as they go
rick cot and tree
where is mama
shh
this is but a taste of the terror
that saruman will unleash
all the more potent for he is driven now
by fear of sauron
ride out and meet him head on
draw him away from your women
and children
you must fight
you have 2000 good men riding north
as we speak
éomer is loyal to you
his men will return
and fight for their king
they will be 300 leagues from here
by now
éomer cannot help us
i know what it is you want of me
but i will not bring further death
to my people
i will not risk open war
open war is upon you
whether you would risk it or not
when last i looked
théoden not aragorn
was king of rohan
then what is the king decision
by order of the king
the city must empty
we make for the refuge of helm deep
do not burden yourself with treasures
take only what provisions you need
helm deep
they flee to the mountains
when they should stand and fight
who will defend them if not their king
he only doing what he thinks
is best for his people
helm deep has saved them
in the past
there is no way out of that ravine
théoden is walking into a trap
he thinks he leading them to safety
what they will get is a massacre
théoden has a strong will
but i fear for him
i fear for the survival of rohan
he will need you before the end
aragorn
the people of rohan will need you
the defenses have to hold
they will hold
the grey pilgrim
that what they used to call me
three hundred lives of men ive walked
this earth and now i have no time
with luck my search will not
be in vain
look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day
at dawn look to the east
go
that horse is half mad my lord
there nothing you can do leave him
his name is brego
he was my cousin horse
brego
your name is kingly
i have heard of the magic of elves
but i did not look for it
in a ranger from the north
you speak as one of their own
i was raised in rivendell
for a time
turn this fellow free
he seen enough of war
gandalf the white
gandalf the fool
does he seek to humble me
with his newfound piety
there were three
who followed the wizard
an elf a dwarf and a man
you stink of horse
the man
was he from gondor
no from the north
one of the dúnedain rangers
i thought he was
his cloth was poor
and yet he bore a strange ring
two serpents with emerald eyes
one devouring
the other crowned with golden flowers
the ring of barahir
so gandalf greyhame
thinks he has found isildur heir
the lost king of gondor
he is a fool
the line was broken years ago
it matters not
the world of men shall fall
it will begin at edoras
i am ready gamling
bring my horse
this is not a defeat
we will return
we will return
you have some skill with a blade
women of this country learned long ago
those without swords
can still die upon them
i fear neither death nor pain
what do you fear my lady
a cage
to stay behind bars until use
and old age accept them
and all chance of valor has gone
beyond recall or desire
youre a daughter of kings
a shieldmaiden of rohan
i do not think that would be your fate
théoden will not stay at edoras
it vulnerable he knows this
he will expect an attack on the city
they will flee to helm deep
the great fortress of rohan
it is a dangerous road to take
through the mountains
they will be slow
they will have women and children
with them
send out your warg-riders
hey stinker dont go getting
too far ahead
why do you do that
what
call him names
run him down all the time
because
because that what he is mr frodo
there naught left in him
but lies and deceit
it the ring he wants
it all he cares about
you have no idea what it did to him
what it still doing to him
i want to help him sam
why
because i have to believe
he can come back
you cant save him mr frodo
what do you know about it
nothing
im sorry sam i dont know
why i said that
i do
it the ring
you cant take your eyes off it
ive seen you

i know what i have to do sam
the ring was entrusted to me
it my task
mine my own
cant you hear yourself

they stole it from us
sneaky little hobbitses
wicked tricksy false

master looks after us now
we dont need you
what

we told him to go away
and away he goes precious
gone gone gone
sméagol is free
look
look see what sméagol finds
they are young
they are tender they are nice
yes they are eat them eat them
youll make him sick you will
behaving like that
there only one way to eat
a brace of coneys
what it doing
stupid fat hobbit
it ruins it
what to ruin there hardly any meat
on them
what we need is a few good taters
what taters precious
what taters eh
po-ta-toes
boil them mash them
stick them in a stew
lovely big golden chips
with a nice piece of fried fish
even you couldnt say no to that
oh yes we could
spoil a nice fish
give it to us raw
and wriggling
you keep nasty chips
youre hopeless
mr frodo
who are they
wicked men
servants of sauron
they are called to mordor
the dark one is gathering all armies
to him
it wont be long now
he will soon be ready
ready to do what
to make his war
the last war that will cover
all the world in shadow
weve got to get moving come on sam
mr frodo
look
it an oliphaunt
no one at home will believe this
sméagol
weve lingered here too long
come on sam
no
wait were innocent travelers
there are no travelers in this land
only servants of the dark tower
we are bound to an errand of secrecy
those that claim to oppose the enemy
would do well not to hinder us
the enemy
his sense of duty was no less
than yours i deem
you wonder what his name is
where he came from
and if he was really evil at heart
what lies or threats led him
on this long march from home
if he would not rather have stayed there
in peace
war will make corpses of us all
bind their hands
it true you dont see
many dwarf women
and in fact they are so alike
in voice and appearance
that theyre often mistaken
for dwarf men
it the beards
this in turn has given rise
to the belief
that there are no dwarf women
and that dwarves just spring out
of holes in the ground
which is of course ridiculous
it all right nobody panic
that was deliberate
it was deliberate
i havent seen my niece smile
for a long time
she was a girl when they brought
her father back dead
cut down by orcs
she watched her mother
succumb to grief
then she was left alone
to tend her king in growing fear
doomed to wait upon an old man
who should have loved her as a father
gimli
no i couldnt
i really couldnt
i made some stew
it isnt much but it hot
thank you
it good
really
my uncle told me a strange thing
he said that you rode to war
with thengel my grandfather
but he must be mistaken
king théoden has a good memory
he was only a small child at the time
then you must be at least 60
seventy
but you cannot be 80
eighty-seven
you are one of the dúnedain
a descendant of númenor
blessed with long life
it was said that your race
had passed into legend
there are few of us left
the northern kingdom
was destroyed long ago
im sorry please eat
the light of the evenstar
does not wax and wane
it is mine to give to whom i will
like my heart
go to sleep
i am asleep
this is a dream
then it is a good dream
sleep
you told me once
this day would come
this is not the endit is the beginning
you must go with frodo
that is your path
my path is hidden from me
it is already laid before your feet
you cannot falter now
arwen
if you trust nothing else
trust this
trust us
where is she
the woman who gave you that jewel
our time here is ending
arwen time is ending
let her go
let her take the ship into the west
let her bear away her love for you
to the undying lands
there it will be ever green
but never more than memory
i will not leave my daughter here
to die
she stays because she still has hope
she stays for you
she belongs with her people
is this how you would take your leave
did you think you could slip away at
first light unnoticed
i will not be coming back
you underestimate your skill in battle
you will come back
it is not of death in battle that i speak
what do you speak of
you have a chance for another life
away from wargriefdespair
why are you saying this
i am mortal you are elf-kind
it was a dream arwen
nothing more
i dont believe you
this belongs to you
it was a gift
keep it
my lord
she is sailing to the undying lands
with all that is left of her kin
what is it
háma
im not sure
wargs
a scout
what is it what do you see
warg were under attack
get them out of here
all riders to the head of the column
come on get me up here im a rider
come on
you must lead the people
to helm deep and make haste
i can fight
no
you must do this for me
follow me hyah
forward i mean charge forward
make for the lower ground
that it go on
stay together
bring your pretty face to my ax
that one counts as mine
stinking creature
aragorn
aragorn
tell me what happened
and i will ease your passing
he
dead
he took a little tumble off the cliff
you lie
get the wounded on horses
the wolves of isengard will return
leave the dead
come
at last
helm deep
there it is helm deep
were safe
were safe my lady
thank you
mama
éothain
freda
where is the rest
this is all we could save my lady
take it to the caves
make way for the king
make way for théoden
make way for the king
so few so few of you have returned
our people are safe
we have paid for it with many lives
my lady
lord aragorn
where is he
he fell
draw all our forces behind the wall
bar the gate
and set a watch on the surround
what of those who cannot fight
my lord the women and children
get them into the caves
saruman arm will have grown long
indeed if he thinks he can reach us here
helm deep has one weakness
its outer wall is solid rock
but for a small culvert
at its base
which is little more than a drain
how how can fire undo stone
what kind of device
could bring down the wall
if the wall is breached
helm deep will fall
even if it is breached it would take
a number beyond reckoning
thousands to storm the keep
tens of thousands
but my lord there is no such force
a new power is rising
its victory is at hand
this night
the land will be stained
with the blood of rohan
march to helm deep
leave none alive
to war
there will be no dawn for men
look there smoke to the south
there is always smoke rising
from isengard these days
isengard
there was a time
when saruman would walk in my woods
but now he has a mind of metal
and wheels
he no longer cares for growing things
what is it
it saruman army
the war has started
may the grace of the valar
protect you
brego
arwen
it is time
the ships are leaving for valinor
go now before it is too late
i have made my choice
he is not coming back
why do you linger here
when there is no hope
there is still hope
if aragorn survives this war
you will still be parted
if sauron is defeated
and aragorn made king
and all that you hope for
comes true
you will still have to taste
the bitterness of mortality
whether by the sword
or the slow decay of time
aragorn will die
and there will be no comfort
for you
no comfort to ease the pain
of his passing
he will come to death
an image of the splendor
of the kings of men
in glory undimmed before
the breaking of the world
but you my daughter
you will linger on in darkness
and in doubt
as nightfall in winter
that comes without a star
here you will dwell
bound to your grief
under the fading trees
until all the world is changed
and the long years of your life
are utterly spent
arwen
there is nothing for you here
only death
do i not also have your love
you have my love father
the power of the enemy is growing
sauron will use his puppet
saruman
to destroy the people of rohan
isengard has been unleashed
the eye of sauron now turns
to gondor
the last free kingdom of men
his war on this country
will come swiftly
he senses the ring is close
the strength of the ring-bearer
is failing
in his heart frodo begins
to understand
the quest will claim his life
you know this
you have foreseen it
it is the risk we all took
in the gathering dark the will
of the ring grows strong
it works hard now to find its way back
into the hands of men
men who are so easily seduced
by its power
the young captain of gondor
has but to extend his hand
take the ring for his own
and the world will fall
it is close now
so close to achieving its goal
for sauron will have dominion
over all life on this earth
even unto the ending
of the world
the time of the elves
is over
do we leave middle-earth
to its fate
do we let them stand alone
what news
our scouts report saruman
has attacked rohan
théoden people have fled
to helm deep
but we must look to our own borders
faramir orcs are on the move
sauron is marshaling an army
easterlings and southrons
are at the black gate
how many
some thousands more come every day
who covering the river to the north
we pulled 500 men at osgiliath
if their city is attacked
we wont hold it
saruman attacks from isengard
sauron from mordor
the fight will come to men
on both fronts
gondor is weak
sauron will strike us soon
and he will strike hard
he knows now we do not have
the strength to repel him
my men tell me that you are orc spies
spies now wait just a minute
well if youre not spies
then who are you
speak
we are hobbits of the shire
frodo baggins is my name
and this is samwise gamgee
your bodyguard
his gardener
and where is your skulking friend
that gangrel creature
he had an ill-favored look
there was no other
we set out from rivendell
with seven companions
one we lost in moria
two were my kin
a dwarf there was also
and an elf and two men
aragorn son of arathorn
and boromir of gondor
youre a friend of boromir
yes
for my part
it will grieve you then to learn
that he is dead
dead
how when
as one of his companions
id hoped you would tell me
if something has happened to boromir
we would have you tell us
his horn washed up upon the riverbank
about six days past
it was cloven in two
but more than this i know it in my heart
he was my brother
boromir
boromir
this city was once the jewel
of our kingdom
a place of light and beauty and music
and so it shall be once more
let the armies of mordor know this
never again will the land of my people
fall into enemy hands
this city of osgiliath
has been reclaimed for gondor
for gondor
for gondor
for gondor
for gondor
good speech nice and short
leaves more time for drinking
break out the ale these men are thirsty
remember today little brother
today life is good
what
he here
moment of peace can he not give us that
where is he
where is gondor finest
where my first-born
father
they say you vanquished the enemy
almost single-handedly
they exaggerate
the victory belongs to faramir also
but for faramir this city
would still be standing
were you not entrusted to protect it
i would have done
but our numbers were too few
oh too few
you let the enemy walk in
and take it on a whim
always you cast a poor reflection on me
that is not my intent
you give him no credit
and yet he tries to do your will
he loves you father
do not trouble me with faramir
i know his uses and they are few
we have more urgent things to speak of
elrond of rivendell has called a meeting
he will not say why
but i have guessed its purpose
it is rumored that the weapon
of the enemy has been found
the one ring
isildur bane
it has fallen into the hands of the elves
everyone will try to claim it
men dwarves wizards
we cannot let that happen
this thing must come to gondor
gondor
it dangerous i know
ever the ring will seek to corrupt
the hearts of lesser men
but you you are strong
and our need is great
it is our blood which is being spilled
our people who are dying
sauron is biding his time
he massing fresh armies
he will return
and when he does
we will be powerless to stop him
you must go
bring me back this mighty gift
no my place is here with my people
not in rivendell
would you deny your own father
if there is need to go to rivendell
send me in his stead
you
oh i see
a chance for faramir captain of gondor
to show his quality
i think not
i trust this mission only to your brother
the one who will not fail me
remember today little brother
captain faramir
we found the third one
you must come with me now
down there
to enter the forbidden pool
bears the penalty of death
they wait for my command
shall i shoot
the rock and pool
is nice and cool
so juicy sweet
our only wish
to catch a fish
so juicy sweet
wait
this creature is bound to me
and i to him
he is our guide
please
let me go down to him
sméagol
master is here
come sméagol
trust master come
we must go now
sméagol you must trust master
follow me come on
come
come sméagol
nice sméagol that it
come on
dont hurt him
sméagol dont struggle
sméagol listen to me
master
that enough
where are you leading them
answer me
sméagol
why does it cry sméagol
cruel men hurts us
master tricksed us
of course he did
i told you he was tricksy
i told you he was false
master is our friend
our friend
master betrayed us
no not its business
leave us alone
filthy little hobbitses
they stole it from us
no no
what did they steal
my precious
we have to get out of here
you go go now
you can do it
use the ring mr frodo
just this once
put it on
disappear
i cant
you were right sam
you tried to tell me but
im sorry
the ring taking me sam
if i put it on
hell find me
hell see
mr frodo
so this is the answer
to all the riddles
here in the wild i have you
two halflings
and a host of men at my call
the ring of power within my grasp
a chance for faramir
captain of gondor
to show his quality
no
stop it
leave him alone
dont you understand
he got to destroy it
that where were going into mordor
to the mountain of fire
osgiliath is under attack
they call for reinforcements
please it such a burden
will you not help him
captain
prepare to leave
the ring will go to gondor
he alive
where is he where is he
get out of the way
im going to kill him
you are the luckiest the canniest
and the most reckless man
i ever knew
bless you laddie
gimli where is the king
youre late
you look terrible
a great host you say
all isengard is emptied
how many
ten thousand strong at least
ten thousand
it is an army bred for a single purpose
to destroy the world of men
they will be here by nightfall
let them come
i want every man and strong lad
able to bear arms
to be ready for battle by nightfall
we will cover the causeway
and the gate from above
no army has ever breached
the deeping wall
or set foot inside the hornburg
this is no rabble of mindless orcs
these are uruk-hai
their armour is thick
and their shields broad
i have fought many wars
master dwarf
i know how to defend my own keep
they will break upon this fortress
like water on rock
saruman hordes will pillage and burn
weve seen it before
crops can be resown
homes rebuilt
within these walls
we will outlast them
they do not come to destroy rohan
crops or villages
they come to destroy its people
down to the last child
what would you have me do
look at my men
their courage hangs by a thread
if this is to be our end then i would
have them make such an end
as to be worthy of remembrance
send out riders my lord
you must call for aid
and who will come
elves
dwarves
we are not so lucky in our friends
as you
the old alliances are dead
gondor will answer
gondor
where was gondor
when the westfold fell
where was gondor when
our enemies closed in around us
where was gon--
no my lord aragorn
we are alone
get the women and children
into the caves
we need more time
to lay provisions--
there is no time war is upon us
secure the gate
we ents have not troubled
about the wars of men and wizards
for a very long time
but now something
is about to happen
that has not happened
for an age
entmoot
what that
tis a gathering
a gathering of what
beech oak
chestnut ash
good good good
many have come
now we must decide
if the ents
will go to war
move back move to the caves
come on people quickly now
well place the reserves along the wall
they can support the archers
from above the gate
aragorn you must rest
youre no use to us half alive
aragorn
im to be sent with the women
into the caves
that is an honorable charge
to mind the children to find food
and bedding when the men return
what renown is there in that
my lady a time may come for valor
without renown
who then will your people look to
in the last defense
let me stand at your side
it is not in my power to command it
you do not command
the others to stay
they fight beside you because they
would not be parted from you
because they love you
im sorry
farmers farriers stable boys
these are no soldiers
most have seen too many winters
or too few
look at them theyre frightened
i can see it in their eyes
and they should be
three hundred against ten thousand
they have more hope of
defending themselves here than at edoras
aragorn
they cannot win this fight
they are all going to die
then i shall die as one of them
let him go lad
let him be
every villager able to wield a sword
has been sent to the armoury
my lord
who am i gamling
you are our king sire
and do you trust your king
your men my lord
will follow you to whatever end
to whatever end
where is the horse and the rider
where is the horn that was blowing
they have passed like rain
on the mountains
like wind in the meadow
the days have gone down in the west
behind the hills
into shadow
how did it come to this
huh
it been going for hours
they must have decided something
by now
decided no
we only just finished saying
good morning
but it nighttime already
you cant take forever
dont be hasty
were running out of time
move move to the outer wall
give me your sword
what is your name
haleth son of háma my lord
the men are saying that
we will not live out the night
they say that it is hopeless
this is a good sword
haleth son of háma
there is always hope
we have trusted you this far
you have not led us astray
forgive me
i was wrong to despair
there is nothing to forgive legolas
we had time id get this adjusted
it a little tight across the chest
that is no orc horn
send for the king
open the gate
open up the gate
how is this possible
i bring word from elrond of rivendell
an alliance once existed
between elves and men
long ago we fought and died together
we come to honor that allegiance
you are most welcome
we are proud to fight
alongside men once more
you could have picked a better spot
well lad whatever luck you live by
let hope it lasts the night
your friends are with you aragorn
let hope they last the night
show them no mercy
for you shall receive none
what happening out there
shall i describe it to you
or would you like me to find you a box
hold
so it begins
prepare to fire
their armour is weak at the neck
and beneath the arm
release arrows
did they hit anything

and what about saruman
have you come to a decision about him
now dont be hasty master meriadoc
hasty
our friends are out there
they need our help they cannot
fight this war on their own
war yes
it affects us all
tree root and twig
but you must understand young hobbit
it takes a long time
to say anything in old entish
and we never say anything
unless it is worth taking
a long time to say
seventeen eighteen

brace the gate
hold them stand firm
aragorn
gimli
charge
the ents cannot hold back this storm
we must weather such things
as we have always done
how can that be your decision
this is not our war
but youre part of this world
arent you
you must help please
you must do something
you are young and brave master merry
but your part in this tale is over
go back to your home
maybe treebeard right
we dont belong here merry
it too big for us
what can we do in the end
weve got the shire
maybe we should go home
the fires of isengard will spread
and the woods of tuckborough
and buckland will burn
and
and all that was once green and good
in this world will be gone
there wont be a shire pippin
aragorn
fall back to the keep
get your men out of there

haldir

haldir
brace the gate
hold them
to the gate draw your swords
make way
we cannot hold much longer
hold them
how long do you need
as long as you can give me
gimli
timbers
brace the gate

i will leave you at the western borders
of the forest
you can make your way north
to your homeland from there
wait stop
stop
turn around
turn around take us south
south
but that will lead you past isengard
yes exactly
if we go south we can slip
past saruman unnoticed
the closer we are to danger
the farther we are from harm
it the last thing hell expect
that doesnt make sense to me
but then
you are very small
perhaps youre right
south it is then
hold on little shirelings
i always like going south
somehow it feels like going downhill
are you mad well be caught
no we wont
not this time
look
osgiliath burns
mordor has come
the ring will not save gondor
it has only the power to destroy
please
let me go
hurry
faramir
you must let me go
and those little family of field mice
that climb up sometimes
and they tickle me awfully
theyre always trying to get somewhere
where they
many of these trees were my friends
creatures i had known
from nut and acorn
im sorry treebeard
they had voices of their own
saruman
a wizard should know better
there is no curse in elvish
entish or the tongues of men
for this treachery
look the trees theyre moving
where are they going
they have business with the orcs
my business is with isengard tonight
with rock and stone
yes
come my friends
the ents are going to war
it is likely
that we go to our doom
last march
of the ents
faramir orcs have taken the eastern
shore their numbers are too great
by nightfall we will be overrun
mr frodo
it calling to him sam
his eye is almost on me
hold on mr frodo
youll be all right
take them to my father
tell him faramir sends a mighty gift
a weapon that will change our fortunes
in this war
do you want to know
what happened to boromir
you want to know
why your brother died
he tried to take the ring from frodo
after swearing an oath to protect him
he tried to kill him
the ring drove your brother mad
watch out
mr frodo
theyre here
theyve come
nazgûl
stay here keep out of sight
take cover
the fortress is taken
it is over
you said this fortress would never fall
while your men defend it
they still defend it
they have died defending it
theyre breaking in
theyre past the door
is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves
is there no other way
there is one passage
it leads into the mountains
but they will not get far
the uruk-hai are too many
tell the women and children
to make for the mountain pass
and barricade the entrance
so much death
what can men do
against such reckless hate
ride out with me
ride out and meet them
for death and glory
for rohan
for your people
the sun is rising
look to my coming
at first light on the fifth day
at dawn
look to the east
yes
yes
the horn of helm hammerhand
shall sound in the deep
one last time
yes
let this be the hour
when we draw swords together
fell deeds awake
now for wrath
now for ruin and a red dawn
forth eorlingas
gandalf
théoden king stands alone
not alone
rohirrim
éomer
to the king
yes
a hit a fine hit
break the dam
release the river
pippin hold on
hold on little hobbits
what are you doing
where are you going
it me
it your sam
dont you know your sam
i cant do this sam
i know
it all wrong
by rights we shouldnt even be here
but we are
it like in the great stories mr frodo
the ones that really mattered
full of darkness and danger they were
and sometimes you didnt want
to know the end
because how could the end be happy
how could the world go back
to the way it was
when so much bad had happened
victory
we have victory
but in the end
it only a passing thing
this shadow
even darkness must pass
a new day will come
and when the sun shines
it will shine out the clearer
those were the stories
that stayed with you
that meant something
even if you were too small
to understand why
but i think mr frodo i do understand
i know now
folk in those stories
had lots of chances of turning back
only they didnt
they kept going
because they were holding
on to something
what are we holding on to sam
that there some good
in this world mr frodo
and it worth fighting for
i think at last we understand one another
frodo baggins
you know the laws of our country
the laws of your father
if you let them go
your life will be forfeit
then it is forfeit
release them
stay out of the forest
keep away from the trees
final count
forty-two
oh that not bad for a pointy-eared
elvish princeling
i myself am sitting pretty on 43
forty-three
he was already dead
he was twitching
he was twitching
because he got my ax
embedded in his nervous system
he doesnt look happy does he
not too happy at all merry
still i suppose the view
would be quite nice from up there
oh yes it a quality establishment
i hear the staff are very good
what are you doing
nothing
the world back to normal that all
no it isnt
im starving
good luck trying to find something
decent around here
probably dead rats and moldy bread
saruman storeroom
i dont believe it
it cant be
it is
longbottom leaf
the finest pipe-weed in south farthing
it perfect one barrel each
wait
do you think we should share it
with treebeard
share it
no no
dead plant and all that
dont think hed understand
could be a distant relative
i get it
dont be hasty
exactly
bar-hrum
this is the old sewer
runs right under the river
through to the edge of the city
youll find cover in the woods there
captain faramir
you have shown your quality sir
the very highest
the shire must truly be a great realm
master gamgee
where gardeners are held in high honor
what road will you take
once you reach the woods
gollum says there a path
near minas morgul
that climbs up into the mountains
cirith ungol
is that its name
no
no
yes
frodo
they say a dark terror dwells
in the passes above minas morgul
you cannot go that way
it is the only way
master says we must go to mordor
so we must try
i must
go frodo
go with the goodwill of all men
thank you
may death find you quickly
if you bring them to harm
come on keep up
mr frodo didnt mean for them rangers
to hurt you
you know that dont you
he was trying to save you see
save me
so there no hard feelings
forgive and forget
no no no hard feelings
gollum gollum
nice master
nice hobbits
very decent of you
very decent indeed gollum
sauron wrath will be terrible
his retribution swift
the battle for helm deep is over
the battle for middle-earth
is about to begin
all our hopes now lie
with two little hobbits
somewhere in the wilderness
i wonder if well ever be
put into songs or tales
what
i wonder if people will ever say
let hear about frodo and the ring
and theyll say
yes that one of my favorite stories
frodo was really courageous
wasnt he dad
yes my boy
the most famousest of hobbits
and that saying a lot
well youve left out
one of the chief characters
samwise the brave
i want to hear more about sam
frodo wouldnt have got far
without sam
now mr frodo you shouldnt make fun
i was being serious
so was i
samwise the brave
sméagol
were not going to wait for you
come on
master
master looks after us
master wouldnt hurt us
master broke his promise
dont ask sméagol
poor poor sméagol
master betrayed us
wicked tricksy false
we ought to wring
his filthy little neck
kill him kill him
kill them both
and then we take the precious
and we be the master
but the fat hobbit he knows
eyes always watching
then we stabs them out
put out his eyeses
and make him crawl
yes yes yes
kill them both
yes no no
it too risky it too risky
where is he where has he gone
hey gollum where are you
sméagol
we could let her do it
yes she could do it
yes precious she could
and then we takes it
once theyre dead
once theyre dead
shh
come on hobbits long ways to go yet
sméagol will show you the way
follow me
