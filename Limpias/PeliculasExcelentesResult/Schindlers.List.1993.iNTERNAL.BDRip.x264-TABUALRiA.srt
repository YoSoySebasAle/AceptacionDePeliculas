my friend
did i call this meeting
you told mr stern
you wanted to speak to me
im here
ive made you a fair offer
fair would be
a percentage in the company
forget the whole thing
get out
how do we know
that you will do what you say
because i said i would
you want a contract
to be upheld by what court
i said what ill do
that our contract
the standard ss rate for jewish skilled
laborers is seven marks a day
five for unskilled and women
this is what you pay
the reich economic office
the jews themselves
receive nothing
poles you pay wages
generally they get a little more
are you listening
what was that about the ss
the rate the what
the jewish worker salary
you pay it
directly to the ss
not to the worker
he gets nothing
but it less
it less than what
i would pay a pole
it less
that the point im trying to make
poles cost more
why should i hire poles
an enamelware factory
over at lipowa street
it owned by a german
but it outside the ghetto

for eggs

oskar schindler

he did something

he came here
with nothing
a suitcase
and built a bankrupt company
into a major manufactory
and left with
a steamer trunk
two steamer
trunks full of money
all the riches
of the world
it comforting to see
that nothing changed
youre wrong emilie

always something missing
in every business i tried
i can see now it wasnt me that failed
something was missing

oskar schindler
we started without you
fine
i miss anything good
i was explaining to herr bosch
and herr madritsch
some of the benefits of moving
their factories into plaszow
i meant the food
since your labor
is housed on-site
it available to you
at all times
you can work them
all night if you want
your factory policies
whatever theyve
been in the past
theyll continue to be
theyll be respected
i have to know
where do you get a suit
like that
what is that is that silk
of course
ja
it has a nice sheen about it
thank you
very nice
id say id get you one but the man
who made it is probably dead
i dont know
i go to work the other day
nobody there
nobody tells me about this
i have to find out i have to go in
everybody gone
no
no
theyre not gone
theyre here
theyre mine
every day that goes by im losing money
every worker that is shot
costs me money
i have to find somebody else
i have to train them
we are going to be
making so much money
that none of this
is going to matter
it bad business
thank you
leave the bottle
take that
lena thank you
scherner told me
something else about you
yeah what that
that you know the meaning
of the word gratitude
that it not some
vague thing with you
like it is with others
you want to
stay where you are
youve got things
going on the side
things are good
you dont want anybody
telling you what to do
i can understand all that you know
i know you
what you want is
your own sub-camp
do you have any idea what is involved
the paperwork alone
and then youve got to
build the fucking thing
getting the fucking permits is
enough to drive you crazy
then the engineers show up
they stand around they argue
about drainage foundations
codes exact specifications
parallel fences
four kilometers long
200 kilograms
of barbed wire
6000 kilograms of electrified fences
ceramic insulators
three cubic meters of
air space per prisoner
im telling you you want to shoot somebody
ive been through it
you know i know
well you know
youve been through it
you could make
things easier for me
id be grateful
where stern
goldberg and chilowicz
make sure i see my cut
from the factory owners
in this camp
leaving you to take
care of my main account
the schindler account
he wants his independence
i gave it to him
but independence costs money
this you understand
look at me
dont forget who you

make sure he stays
he a slippery bastard
we need more wine
more wine

of our ss friends
wives and children
dont forget to
send something
record payoffs to
the main administration
and economics office
the arm
slowly stern slowly
the armaments board
governor general division of the interior
and chief of police as fees
and make them on
the first of each month
as opposed to individual payoffs
to our ss contacts
the list is in the lower drawer
of my desk which you

of my desk which you handle

is that youve been working
since i think what
about 600 this morning
yet such a small pile
of hinges
oh christ
may i try that sir
check the angle lever
maybe it bent
no no you wouldnt hear a click
if it was the angle lever
maybe it the pin
maybe the pin shaft is greasy
ja come on
what did i just say
here
herr kommandant
i beg to report that my heap of hinges
was so unsatisfactory
because the machines were being
recalibrated this morning
i was put on to
shoveling coal
strange huh
yeah
thank you muek
lisiek dont touch the leather
it just been oiled
rottenführer
oh for me
oh thank you very much
herr direktor
herr direktor
herr direktor
herr direktor
he was making
hinges slowly
so the man can
turn out a hinge in
less than a minute
why the long story
thank you sir
youre welcome
nobody knows who
stole the chicken hmm
tell him about the chicken
a man walks around with a chicken
and nobody notices this
save yourselves
tell him about the chicken
still nobody knows
it was you
you committed this crime
no sir
but you know who though
yes
who
him
he very gifted
yeah sure
bring him over
sir thank you
thank you again
herr direktor
youre welcome again

hello miss elsa krause is here
i only need five minutes
she wants to speak to
the herr direktor
yes
he wont see you
please sit down
pernod cognac
no no thank you
so what can i do for you
they say that
no one dies here
they say your
factory is a haven
they say you are good
who says that
everyone
my name is regina perlman
not elsa krause
ive been living in krakow on false papers
since the ghetto massacre
my parents are in plaszow
their names are
chana and jakob perlman
they are older people
they are killing older people now in plaszow
they bury them up
in the forest look
i dont have any money
i borrowed these clothes
im begging you please
please bring them here
i dont do that
youve been misled
i ask one thing
whether or not
the worker has certain skills
that what i ask
and that what i care about
my father is an importer
not a metalworker
such activities are illegal
you will not entrap me
cry and i will have you arrested
i swear to god
people die
it a fact of life
he wants to kill everybody
great
what am i supposed to do
about it
bring everybody over
is that what you think
send them over to schindler
send them all
his place is a haven didnt you know
it not a factory
it not an enterprise
of any kind
it a haven for
rabbis and orphans
and people with no
skills whatsoever
you think i dont know
what youre doing
youre so quiet all the time
i know i know
are you losing money
that not the point
so the point is
it dangerous
it dangerous to me
you have to understand
goeth is under enormous pressure
you have to think of it
in his situation
he got this
whole place to run
he responsible for everything here
all these people
he got a lot of things
to worry about
and he got the war
which brings out the worst in people
never the good always the bad
always the bad
but in normal circumstances
he wouldnt be like this hed be all right
thered just be the good aspects
of him which
he a wonderful crook
a man who loves good food good wine
the ladies making money
killing
he cant enjoy it
bejski told me the other day
somebody escaped
from a work detail
outside the wire
goeth lined up everybody
from the missing man barracks
he shot the man to the left of bejski
the man to the right of him
he walked down the line shooting
every other man with a pistol
twenty-five
what do you want
me to do about it
nothing nothing
were just talking
perlman
perlman
husband and wife
jakob and chana perlman
have goldberg bring them over
im sure this will be better
than those rags lisiek
herr direktor i was just helping
lisiek to find something
to clean the stains from
the herr kommandant bathtub
go clean it
pardon me herr direktor
you dont have to
report to me helen
you know who i am
im schindler
of course
i have heard and
you have been here before
here why dont you
keep this someplace
go on take it
i get extra food here
well if you dont want to eat it trade it
or give it to lisiek
why not build yourself up
my first day here
he beat me
because i threw out
the bones from dinner
he came down to the basement
at midnight and he
he asked me where they were
for his dogs
you understand
i said to him
i dont know how i say this
i never could say it now
i said to him
why are you beating me
he said the reason
i beat you now
is because you ask
why i beat you
i know your
sufferings helen
it doesnt matter
i have accepted them
accepted them
one day he will shoot me
no no no
he wont shoot you
i know i see things
we were on the roof on monday
young lisiek and i
and we saw the herr kommandant
come out of the front door
and down the steps by the patio
right there below us
and there on the steps
he drew his gun and he
shot a woman who
was passing by
a woman carrying a bundle
through the throat
just a woman on her way somewhere
you know
she was no fatter or thinner
or slower or faster
than anyone else
and i couldnt guess
what had she done
the more you see of
the herr kommandant
the more you see there is
no set rules that you can live by
you cant say to yourself
if i follow these rules i will be safe
he wont shoot you
because he enjoys you too much
he enjoys you so much
he wont even let you wear the star
he doesnt want
anyone else to know
it a jew he enjoying
he shot the woman
from the steps
because she meant
nothing to him
she was one of a series
neither offending
or pleasing him
but you helen
it all right
it not that kind of a kiss
thank you
here
right the wine
wonderful party amon
thank you
why do you drink
that motor oil
i send you good stuff
all the time
your liver going to explode
like a hand grenade
you know i look at you
i watch you
youre never drunk
oh that
that real control
control is power
that power
is that why they fear us
we have the fucking power to kill
that why they fear us
they fear us because
we have the power to kill arbitrarily
a man commits a crime
he should know better
we have him killed
and we feel pretty good about it
or we kill him ourselves
and we feel even better
that not power though
that justice
it different than power
power is when we have
every justification to kill
and we dont
you think that power
that what the emperors had
a man stole something
he brought in
before the emperor
he throws himself down on the ground
he begs for mercy
he knows he going to die
and the emperor pardons him
this worthless man
he lets him go
i think you are drunk
that power amon
that is power
amon the good
i pardon you
what do they want
i dont know but theyre in my office
right now reviewing our books
as my accountant tell me

are reviewing my books

your job properly

that he will forgive me

that you really

and a well-trained servant

it must get lonely down here
when youre listening to everyone
upstairs having such a good time

the truth helen
is always the right answer
yes youre right
sometimes were both lonely
yes i
i mean
i would like so much to
reach out and touch
you in your loneliness

i wonder i mean
what would be wrong with that
i realize that
youre not a person in
the strictest sense
of the word but
no maybe youre right

to tie their shoes together

make something
special for u-boat crews
and then they were herded
down a big corridor
to bunkers with stars
of david on the doors
and signs that said
bath and inhalation room

herr schindler
i remember earlier this year
ig farben ordered
a trainload of hungarians
for its chemical factory
the train came in
through the archway
and the officer in charge of the selection
went immediately to work
and sent 2000 of them
straight away to
special treatment
it is not my task
to interfere with
the processes that take
place down here
why do you think i can help you
if i cant help ig farben
allow me to
express the reason
im not making any judgment
about you
it just that i know
that in the coming months
were all going to need
portable wealth
i could have you arrested
im protected by powerful friends
you should know that
i do not say
i am accepting them
all i say is im not comfortable
with them on the table
i have a shipment
coming in tomorrow
ill cut you
300 units from it
new ones
these are fresh
the train comes
we turn it around
yes yes
it yours
i understand

get stuck on names

the inside
of a 45 millimeter
shell casing

back on the train
under department w provisions
it is unlawful to kill a worker
without just cause
under the businesses
compensation fund
i am entitled to file
damage claims for such deaths
if you shoot
without thinking
you go to prison
i get paid
that how it works
so there will be
no summary executions here
there will be no interference
of any kind with production
in hopes of ensuring that
guards will
no longer be allowed
on the factory floor
without my authorization
for your cooperation
you have my gratitude
come on come

madam
hello
what is it
weve received an angry complaint
from the armaments board
the artillery shells
tank shells rocket casings
apparently all of them have
failed quality control tests
that to be expected
start-up problems
this isnt pots and pans
this is a precise business
ill write them a letter
theyre withholding payment
sure so would i
so would you
i wouldnt worry about it
well get it right one of these days
there a rumor youve been going around
miscalibrating the machines
they could shut us down
send us back to auschwitz
ill call around find out
where we can buy shells
pass them off as ours
i dont see the difference
whether theyre made here
or somewhere else
you dont see a difference
i see a difference
youll lose a lot of money
fewer shells will be made
stern if this factory
ever produces
a shell that can
actually be fired
ill be very unhappy
hello madam

of unconditional surrender
of all german land
sea and air forces in europe

expeditionary force

the unconditional surrender
of germany has just been announced

the process
of looking for survivors
of your families

years of murder

throughout the world
weve survived
many of you have come up to me
and thanked me
thank yourselves
thank your fearless stern
and others among you
who worried about you
and faced death
at every moment
im a member of
the nazi party
im a munitions manufacturer
im a profiteer of slave labor
i am a criminal
at midnight youll be free
and ill be hunted
i shall remain with you until five
minutes after midnight
after which time
and i hope youll forgive me
i have to flee
i know you have received orders
from our commandant
which he has received
from his superiors
to dispose of the population
of this camp
now would be the time
to do it
here they are theyre all here
this is your opportunity
or you could leave
and return to
your families as men
instead of murderers
in memory of the countless victims
among your people
i ask us to observe
three minutes of silence
amen
amen
