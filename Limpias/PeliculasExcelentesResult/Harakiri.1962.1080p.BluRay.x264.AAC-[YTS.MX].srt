000 am master bennosuke
pays a visit to the kandabashi mansion
of the honorable lord doi
to present fresh river trout
from the shirakawa river
which arrived from our domain
no other official business to record
however
at about 400 in the afternoon
a samurai claiming to be a former retainer
of the fukushima clan in hiroshima
appeared at our gate

soto sakurada-machi edo
official residence of the iyi clan
you were a retainer of the former
fukushima clan in hiroshima
that is correct
my name is hanshiro tsugumo
written with the character
tsu as in harbor
and gumo as in cloud
what is the nature of your visit
my master house fell in 69
i subsequently left the domain
and moved here to edo
where i found shelter
in a back-alley tenement
while eking out a meager living
i sought connections
for employment with a new master
but try as i might
we live in times of peace
and my every effort has been in vain
failing to find employment
and with little to do
he finds himself in dire straits
and believes
he can endure it no further
rather than live on
in such poverty and disgrace
he wishes to die
honorably by harakiri
and asks for permission
to use our forecourt
such is his request
not again
will they never stop
how shall i respond
fine show him in
this is the room sir
please go in
thank you
i am a former retainer
of lord masanori fukushima
of hiroshima
hanshiro tsugumo by name
i respectfully beg your favor
i am senior counselor
of the house of iyi kageyu saito
i am much obliged
for this immediate interview
the purpose of my visit -
ive already been told
of your request
rather than live on
in endless poverty
idly waiting for death
you wish to end your life in a manner
befitting a samurai by harakiri
i believe that was the gist of it
that is correct
in these times
it is a truly admirable resolve
i can only express the highest esteem
you mentioned
that you served
the former lord fukushima
did you happen to know
a man named motome chijiiwa
chijiiwa
yes
hmm
you dont recognize the name
im quite certain he said
hed served the former lord fukushima
in its prosperous days
the clan retainers
numbered some 2000 men
one could hardly know them all
i see
but never mind that
earlier this year
perhaps around the end of january
this ronin named motome chijiiwa
came calling
and the purpose of his visit
was the same as yours
he requested the use of our forecourt
to dispatch himself with honor
is that right
would you like me to tell you
what happened in that case
i would indeed
you say you were a retainer
of the former fukushima clan in hiroshima
that is correct
i served the former
lord masanori fukushima of hiroshima
my name is motome chijiiwa
what is the nature of your visit
after the fall of my master house
i moved here to edo
and found shelter in a back-alley tenement
while eking out a meager living
i sought connections
for employment with a new master
but try as i might
we live in times of peace
and my every effort has been in vain
so now it seems it our turn
how shall we respond
let me think
it amazing how such foolishness
can take hold
blame it on what
the sengoku clan did
say what you will that was a mistake
i disagree yazaki
that not necessarily true
why not
the fellow who went to the sengoku house
was serious about disemboweling himself
there was nothing dishonorable
about his intent
precisely because
they were touched by his sincerity
the sengoku house decided
to take him in as a back-room retainer
that was good
they made the right decision in that case
the problem
is the shameless imitators
who have followed
they have no intention whatsoever
of performing harakiri
and just because theyre hurting a little
for food and clothing
they show up at our gate
to practice their thinly disguised extortion
we cant very well allow him
to disembowel himself in our gateway
our only choice is to follow
the example of other clans
give him a little something
and ask him to leave
no
that will not do
if we give him money
and send him away
hell soon be followed by others
one after the other
like ants drawn to a mound of sugar
ever since the battle of sekigahara
edo has been teeming with ronin -
masterless samurai
theyre like wild dogs
roving about in search of prey
think what people will say
the house of iyi has gone soft
like the others
everybody thought they had backbone
so until now the ronin avoided their gate
but look what theyve done now
they boast of their martial valor
but this is a time of peace
so theyre just
living in yesterday dreams
would you have such laughable chatter
spreading all over edo
especially when his lordship
is away in his domain
under no circumstances can we allow
a stain to come upon our lord name
while he away
giving him money
and asking him to leave -
such lily-livered nonsense
is out of the question
he hasnt the slightest intention
of killing himself
yet he speaks of honorable harakiri
counselor
if i may
my apologies for keeping you waiting
i am umenosuke kawabe
a member of lord iyi mounted guard
my name is motome chijiiwa
a ronin from hiroshima
kindly come with me
excuse me
i am to show you to the bath
since lord iyi is at present
away in his domain
senior counselor saito conveyed your request
to his lordship son bennosuke
he finds your resolve most admirable
and wishes you to be brought forward
for an immediate audience
i am to have an audience
with master bennosuke
that is correct
i must beg your pardon
but your present attire will not do
while you refresh yourself
in the bath
well see to some new robes for you
i place myself in your hands
your kindness overwhelms me
i must be dreaming
this is so
completely unexpected
almost -
pardon me
my apologies
for keeping you waiting so long
i must ask you to change again
your robes
is something wrong
what about my audience
with master bennosuke
i was told
id be granted an audience
i dont believe so
you must have misunderstood
no im quite certain
that was the word i received from
umenosuke kawabe of the mounted guard
kawabe
now that you mention it
yes that must be it
so im not mistaken
i believe i understand
when senior counselor saito
personally conveyed your desire
to master bennosuke
he noted how rare it is these days to find
men with such a great sense of honor
i would like to add this man
to the ranks of our retainers he said
but when a man declares
that he wishes to tear his belly open
it can only come
from a most profound resolve
i am sure it would be no use
trying to dissuade him
grant him his final wish
although i would like to meet
this man of such uncommon valor
and tell him how much
i admire his purpose
i am unfortunately scheduled to go
to lord doi residence at this hour
extend to him
every courtesy of this house
and have all our retainers
witness his final act
that they may remember it
as a proud example
such were master bennosuke words
i was told
tell me
what do you think of this story
a most interesting tale
worthy of the famous red armor
that symbolizes the house of iyi
and its reputation for great martial valor
may i ask what your intentions are
you mean
about this
exactly
you may set your mind at ease
i came here
with every intention of dying
well well
a most admirable resolve
in that case master tsugumo
perhaps i should recount for you
a little more of motome chijiiwa story
by all means
now then
we must be aware of the time
please change into those robes
all other arrangements
are already in place
for a harakiri ceremony
with all the proper formalities
i have a request
i must beg a brief respite
respite
i will not run or hide
i will return to this house
but i beg you
for a day or two respite
im afraid it too late for that
but this is absurd
absurd
we made the harakiri arrangements
at your own request
my most abject apologies
just a day or two respite
i will return without fail
a samurai word is his bond
there can be no delay
master swordsman hayato yazaki
fit and eager
his skills honed to perfection
one false step
and hell slice you in two
the others will descend on you as well
rather than being chopped up
like a dead fish
perform harakiri
and die like a samurai
now change into those robes
o ancestors of the house of iyi
i must beg your forgiveness
for defiling the mansion courtyard
with unworthy ronin blood
i do this to preserve
the honor of this house
as well as that
of the tokugawa family
and of the samurai code itself
i beg you to be witness
to my decision
his short blade is the same
look at it
it wouldnt cut tofu
he sells off his soul as a samurai
replacing his blades with bamboo
and then shows up
saying he wants to perform harakiri
the nerve of the man
everything is in place
for the ceremony to begin
master motome chijiiwa
rather than sit and wait
for death in dire poverty
youve declared your wish
to die honorably by harakiri
it is a commendable decision
you are an example for all samurai
i am ashamed to admit
that even in this house known for martial valor
since our ancestor naomasa day
the resolve youve shown
is seen but rarely
so that they may witness
the noble demise of a true warrior
and engrave a lasting impression of it
upon their minds
ive ordered all retainers
of this household to attend
may your heart be at peace
i beg of you
what is it
i beg for a brief respite -
a day or two grace
i swear i will not run or hide
ill return to this spot without fail
please i implore you
this is most unexpected
ive heard lately
of incidents all across edo
in which ronin who dont deserve
to call themselves samurai
demand the use of a clan forecourt
to commit harakiri
but are happy to walk away
in exchange for a few coins
surely youre not -
absolutely not sir
no no
of course not
id never believe that a man
of your noble character and mien
could be such a despicable extortionist
now then
you may proceed
unworthy as i am
i shall be your second
i am an exponent
of the shindo-munen-ichi school
i imagine you are aware
but let me note just to be sure
the rite of harakiri
has changed over time
in recent years
it is often harakiri in name only
the subject reaches for the blade
on the wooden stand
and his second immediately
strikes off his head
in other words
there is no disembowelment at all
and in fact sometimes
the stand holds not a short sword
but only a folding fan
however
our proceedings today will not sink
to such debased and empty forms
we shall adhere strictly
to the traditional ways
is that understood
you will rip your bowels open
crosswise like this
once i see you have done so
i will strike off your head
until im satisfied
youve fully torn open your bowels
i will not bring down my sword
is that understood
now then
it is your own sword
that is the blade you will use
a samurai sword is his soul
no blade could be more fitting
for this purpose than your own
come what keeps you
proceed
strike strike me
no not yet
pull your blade across
why do you delay
draw your blade across
pull it to the right
i suppose he had no other recourse
but even so
to bite off his tongue
would you say he was being resourceful
or just unseemly
then again
who in his right mind attempts harakiri
with just a bamboo sword
now then
what are your intentions
you mean
about this
the account ive given you
of motome chijiiwa fate
is true in every detail
take my advice master tsugumo
quietly take your leave
you need have no such concerns with me
unlike this chijiiwa fellow
the sword in my belt
is not made of bamboo
rest assured i will not bite off my tongue
i will disembowel myself in grand form
very well
master tsugumo
since you are unswerving in your resolve
i shall grant your wish
attendant
this ronin from hiroshima
master hanshiro tsugumo
is to be granted use of the courtyard
to perform harakiri
his present dress will not do
give him fresh robes befitting
one who journeys to the next world
if i may
what is it
please do not trouble yourselves
over such things
for the final moments
of a down-and-out ronin like myself
surely nothing is more fitting
than the clothes i now wear
i am deeply grateful for the courteous
and considerate treatment
you have accorded me today
i can find no adequate words
to thank you
now then i shall begin
might i ask counselor
who will be serving as my second
i have assigned ichiro shinmen
master shinmen
did you wish for someone else
yes sir
i would like master hikokuro omodaka
you request hikokuro
i believe he a retainer in this house
ive heard he trained
in the shindo-munen-ichi school
indeed
hikokuro is a fine choice
hikokuro
im afraid he not
in attendance today
he sent a note saying he ill
and requesting a few day rest
i see that too bad
master tsugumo
as you heard
omodaka is not present today
you will need to make another choice
that is most disappointing
i had my heart set on master omodaka
performing the service
i wonder if i might not beg
his special consideration
well
he says he ill
but he seemed fine yesterday
surely it cant be anything serious
messenger
make all due haste
to omodaka residence
tell him to come immediately
if his illness permits now hurry
im putting you
to a great deal of trouble
please accept my apologies
now then
do you wish to wait here
or would you like
to come inside and relax
no
the comfort of your residence
might cause my resolve to waver
my journey into eternity mustnt grow
distasteful i shall remain here
you display remarkable discipline
i can but express my admiration
if i may counselor
it could be quite tedious for us both
to sit here and wait in silence
to pass the time
perhaps youll allow me to tell you
a little about myself
about yourself
yes
the hardscrabble tales of a half-starved
ronin dont amount to much
but what befalls others today
may be your own fate tomorrow
perhaps your retainers
will find some small point or two
worth remembering
among my otherwise
useless ramblings
what befalls others today
may be your own fate tomorrow
this could be amusing
i want everyone here
to listen carefully to this man
the words of one
staring death in the face
are unlikely to be useless ramblings
im sure well all learn something
counselor
that tale you related earlier -
may i be assured
it was true in every detail
indeed
the ronin from hiroshima
named motome chijiiwa
was a man of some acquaintance to me
motome chijiiwa
was a man of some acquaintance to me
motome was a lad of 5
and my daughter miho
was an angelic child of
that was  years ago
but when i close my eyes
their images come back to me vividly
as if it were only yesterday
my turn again
never mind
all we do all day is count stones
to repair the castle walls
we wont be needing bows and arrows
for a good long while
the world is at peace
the four seas are calm
incidentally this coming 22nd
is the seventh anniversary
of nui passing
i knew it was coming up
but is it seven years already
yes and im planning
a modest ceremony at my residence
dont bring any offerings
very well
i can hardly believe it
seven years already
what never ceases to amaze me
is how a rough warrior like you
has managed to raise miho all these years
without taking a second wife
come jinnai
look who talking
when your yuki died
i wondered how you would ever manage
but look at you
youre a perfect example
of the kite begetting a hawk
kite begetting a hawk
you were the widower kite
doting so on your child
in every aspect of his upbringing
then lo and behold
the child grew not into a kite
but a magnificent young hawk
nonsense
he certainly keeps growing
but he got a long way to go
before you can compare him
to a young hawk soaring freely overhead
you know
i never figured either of us would be good
for anything but battlefield laurels
but we havent done too bad
at raising children
had life gone on like that
all would have been well
but it was not to be
when all is said and done
our lives are like houses
built on foundations of sand
one strong wind and all is gone
how my master house
with its 498000-koku domain
was brought to ruin
im sure you already know
even better than i do myself
owing to an unreasonable and one-sided
judgment by the tokugawa shogunate
regarding the repairs
being performed on hiroshima castle
in june of 69
my master masanori fukushima
was ordered into exile at kawanakajima
leaving his 2000 retainers
without any means of livelihood
through no fault of their own
jinnai
to hanshiro tsugumo
in view of our long-standing friendship
i ask your indulgence in the following
the castle repairs commissioner
the honorable masakatsu fukushima
will be electing death at any moment
therefore i will precede him
on his journey
my company alone will suffice
i beg you not to follow
regarding my only child motome
he has grown tall
but he is still only 5
please look after him
as he finds his way in life
why did he have to be so hasty
committing harakiri
even before i have done so
hanshiro i forbid you to follow
if the house could still be saved i might
wish you to accompany me in death
but with the house abolished
it would be pointless
jinnai company will suffice
but sire
dont be foolish hanshiro
jinnai died because he knew
you would if he didnt
he died to accompany me
on your behalf as well
which means hanshiro
that you must now live on
both for you and for him
and also for his son motome
who will look after him if not you
i go now to meet jinnai
hanshiro is there anything
youd like me to tell him
do you have nothing for me to say
tell jinnai
tell jinnai this
have no fears about motome
i will watch over his every step
on the path to manhood
i will not fail him
i swear this on my life
go on master tsugumo
what did you find out
it seems his illness
is indeed most serious
what the nature of the ailment
according to his family
a high fever
and excruciating pain
in all his joints
go on
i asked if i might visit him
at his bedside
but he sent word back
that his pain was so great
that he did not wish to be seen
in his present state
all i could do was convey
the message you sent and return
it seems
there nothing we can do
perhaps he was overcome by
the relentless heat of recent days
master tsugumo
you heard what he said
i must ask you to select
someone else as your second
i am sorely disappointed
but it appears i have no choice
in that case
i would ask for master hayato yazaki
hayato
inaba i believe he too
has been absent these four or five days
that is correct
he requested leave
because he wasnt feeling well
master tsugumo
im afraid hayato yazaki
is also absent due to illness
master yazaki is also ill
im sorry to hear that
again it seems i have no choice
i request master umenosuke kawabe
counselor
surely it not possible
that master kawabe
is also under the weather
well well
it seems he is indeed indisposed
all three unavailable
on this particular day -
what a very odd coincidence
most curious
he up to something
clearly so
hikokuro was the one
who first insisted
that motome chijiiwa
be forced to go through with harakiri
yazaki was the one
who discovered his blades were bamboo
and insisted he be forced to use them
and kawabe was quick to agree
that why i urged that he at least
be spared the bamboo blade
of what good is that now
indeed sire
but how shall we deal with him
i doubt he intends
to meekly disembowel himself
he obviously has something
up his sleeve
whatever it is
he wont get away with it
well force his hand
and make him commit harakiri
in fact if he refuses
well descend upon him in force
and cut him down
what happens within the walls
of this compound
is as secret as what happens
behind the walls of our castle back home
one signal from me
and everyone will know what to do
but im bothered
about hikokuro and the other two
i need to send someone
to find out more
and under the circumstances
id like you to personally hurry
and find out the real story
master tsugumo
summer days are long
but the hour advances
i must ask you to proceed
without further delay
but counselor
the ritual cannot take place
without a second
i understand your concern
but ive discussed the matter
with my senior colleagues
with all three men of your choice ailing
we cannot accommodate your wishes
you will have to accept our selection
ichiro shinmen
i command you to serve
as second for master tsugumo
perform your duty with care
i must protest
to act as my second
i have named
three specially selected men
i must have one of these three
are you deaf
all three you name are ill
and are not present today
i explained this very clearly
did you not hear
then in that case
i have no choice
i must call off my harakiri for now
enough hanshiro tsugumo
your extortion scheme
has gone too far
it bad enough to march in here
demanding a place to perform harakiri
but then you quibble endlessly
over naming your second
you never intended to commit harakiri
all you really want is money
counselor
if i were the extortionist you say
would i be calmly sitting here
on this platform
then why do you not quietly proceed
i am fully prepared to die
but cutting my belly open
does not in itself
ensure smooth passage
to the netherworld
i need someone to expeditiously
strike off my head -
a swordsman of reliable skill
i do not perform harakiri
to atone for a crime or offense
the least i can expect
is to choose my own second
further debate on the matter
is clearly a waste of time
you are a fraud
a disgrace to our class
you never intended
to commit harakiri
insolent dog
stop
wait
wait i say
i beg of all those present
a moment a brief moment
you cant possibly have more to say
but i do
i do have more to say
i havent finished my story
i have no ears
for your endless ramblings
counselor
if you force me to
i will fight desperately to the death
no matter the odds against me
some of your men
will be wounded undeservedly
some may even lose their lives
would it not be better
to simply hear me out
once i have finished my story
i will disembowel myself
with no further ado
or if you feel harakiri
is too good for me
you may turn your men on me
to do what they will
in any event
i would first like you to hear
what i have to say
as to these conditions you state
do i have your word
you have my word
and as a samurai
you will hold true to it
very well
but make it short
i will not listen
to your useless mutterings for long
men fall back
now where was i
oh yes
my master house fell
and jinnai chijiiwa died
but before doing so
he asked me to look after motome
when my master house fell
we immediately left the domain
and moved to edo
the streets of edo
were crowded with ronin
flotsam from the battle of sekigahara
in former times
other clans would have gladly taken in
any ronin whod earned a name for himself
but in an era no longer in need
of warriors or horses
so peaceful that no wind
even rustled the leaves on the trees
it was a constant struggle
simply to find a meal
indeed it shames me to recall
our miserable lives
of these last eight or nine years
but amidst all our hardships
my daughter miho
was rapidly becoming a woman
and soon it was
the spring of her 8th year
father
ive set your lunch out
in case im not back in time
the greatest delicacies
taste of nothing when eaten alone
if youre not back ill wait
ill collect for these and then stop
by yoshizakicho for dried fish
hello
welcome sir
busy as usual
looks like youre on your way out
yes to the wholesaler
in kyobashi
the mikawaya i suppose
take care
experience is the best teacher
youve become very deft at that
forgive me
i hate asking you
for advances all the time
but my earnings
simply refuse to catch up
you disarm me
by beating me to the punch
i came intending
to lodge a complaint or two
but when you make the first move
what can i say
by the way
what are your thoughts
on that matter i raised the other day
have you come to a decision
yes i have
glad to hear it
it takes a load off my mind
no
i appreciate your proposal
regarding miho
but ive decided to decline
in the end her adoption
by the joshuya family
would be a mere pretext
lasting perhaps six months
once established
as a member of their family
shed be sent to lord sakakibara
as his concubine
master tsugumo
the sakakibara are a family
with a domain of 0000 koku
it may sound odd to seek benefit
from your daughter connections
but you need do nothing
and doors will open to you
i understand that
but master seibei
no matter how far ive fallen
i cannot make my daughter a concubine
to profit from her connections
it fine to uphold your pride
but as a parent you must consider
your daughter feelings too
what
she young and beautiful
yet she doesnt have
a single fancy kimono to wear
she can only look forward to endless days
of slaving at her father side
master tsugumo
you cant fight the world you live in
nor go against
the tide of the times
it a good proposal for miss miho
and for you
no matter how you look at it
in fact to be honest
is it not precisely because miss miho
was blessed with such beauty
that an avenue like this
remains open to you
confucius said
he who knows not the will of heaven
is not a superior man
he who knows not proper decorum
must not rise to his feet
he who knows not the heart of words
cannot know the heart of man
that will be all for today
thank you sir good-bye
hey katsuzo
let go sparrow hunting today
hello uncle hanshiro
it good to see you
have some tea
much obliged
i know this house well enough
to at least boil water
as it happens motome
i came today to discuss
a matter of some weight
you sound so formal
what could it be
how quickly the days
and months fly by
miho is now 8
she looks more
like her mother every day
in fact it hard to see
how she could possibly be of my blood
if shed taken after me
shed never have grown so beautiful
what are you trying to say sir
well motome
id like you to take miho as your wife
i realize this is all very sudden
but what do you think
will you do it motome
you know as well as i
the state of my livelihood at present
i offer classes in the chinese classics
to a handful of children
and live from hand to mouth
how could i possibly take a wife
do you dislike miho
all im asking
is how you feel about her
it not only because
of the promise i made to your father
that i hope youll marry miho
boorish and dull as i am
im not entirely insensitive
to your feelings for each other
it was more difficult than i expected
to persuade motome
i didnt realize
he had such a stubborn
and willful streak
but i knew he loved miho
and i knew miho
would have no objections to the match
the crane that lives a thousand years
a symbol of myriad joys
the tortoise that lives 0000 years
bears on its back the three worlds
of heaven earth and man
the sands upon the beach
numberless and smooth
may they ever reflect the morning sun
after two years
a child was born
it was a boy
and they named him kingo
of course
i was the one who chose the name
hello father
what this asleep again
father youre too generous
nonsense
even after i married you off
you still cook for me
and besides
i now have only myself to support
i save more money
than i know what to do with
and i cant take it with me
well well
did you wake up
now none of that you little rascal
a warrior son
should not be flashing dimples
what did i tell you now
really even the matsudaira clan
of dewa province
that right
i can understand abolishing
the domains of newer vassals
but to treat vassals whove supported
the tokugawa for generations so harshly
the shogunate policy toward
the warlords is completely beyond me
well see another jump
in the number of ronin
did you hear
one of them tried to commit harakiri
at the sengoku clan gate
a ronin named shume ooi
formerly of the kurume clan
i heard the sengoku
were so impressed
that they offered him employment
that much was fine
it what happened next
yes i heard
other ronin who got wind of the story
began presenting themselves at the gates
of daimyo houses all over edo
insisting on committing harakiri
and refusing to budge
in order to get rid of them
the houses offered them money
to leave
it a shameful turn of events
it certainly is
no matter how hard-pressed
they may be
it a despicable thing to do
in these difficult times
it no help growing desperate
becoming too impatient
in seeking employment
is a danger we must all
take care to avoid
you are absolutely right
if you stop worrying so much
about finding employment
you can sit here like this
without answering to a superior
at no one beck and call
what the matter there little one
it time for his milk
ill nurse him
you mustnt give him
your breast every time he cries
hell develop bad habits
lookee here kingo
ready
see my funny face
all right
upsy-daisy here goes kingo
in kanda
at the myojin shrine
there a festival
tonight
kingo was the center of our existence
and the three of us lived happily
with the constant sound
of warm laughter
raising peaceful ripples around us
it truly was
a time of greater happiness
than id ever known in the domain
however
good things never last for long
one day miho suddenly coughed up
profuse quantities of blood
she had always been
of weak constitution
and with the endless burden
of our piecework labor
shed driven her frail body
too hard for too long
motome panicked
the poor fellow
date clan construction site
fifty laborers at 40 mon
fifty laborers at 40 mon
just a minute samurai sir
are you trying to get me in trouble
there isnt enough work
even for the townsmen
if the authorities spotted
a two-sworded laborer
id be in for a real dressing-down
hosokawa clan construction site
twenty laborers 45 mon
pawn shop
poor motome
he tried everything but to no avail
miho was gradually wasting away
and the worst was yet to come
it seared forever in my memory
wed just barely made it
through the end of the year
and the plum blossoms
had begun to bloom
shortly after the beginning
of the new year
what wrong
is it miho
is it miho
it kingo
what kingo
a fever
like he on fire
why miho
why did you just sit by
until it came to this
i thought it was an ordinary cold
what did the doctor say
you did have a doctor see him
didnt you
you havent had a doctor see him
why havent you had
a doctor look at him
kingo fight it off
your grandpa
like your mom and dad
has already sold off
everything of value
there not a thing
not a thing we can do for you
there nothing
nothing we can do kingo
but youre the son of a samurai
you cant let a little illness
get the better of you
dont let it beat you
dont let it dont let it
father
i have an idea
what
i need to go out
please look after kingo
what do you have in mind
a former retainer of the kato clan
now lives in nihonbashi
and makes his living
as a moneylender
his rates are so high
that i didnt dare go to him before
but i cant worry about that anymore
youre right if you know such a man
hurry and go
im on my way
ill be back by evening at the latest
as you can see miho is too weak
so please take care of kingo
of course
i know what to do
but motome
you can see
he barely hanging on
you must be quick
and you mustnt fail
ill return by evening without fail
ill be off then
were depending on you motome
no no ill do that
it wont be long now kingo
what taking him so long
he getting worse
what could motome be doing
no no your getting up wont do
kingo fever any good
where can motome be
he swore hed be back by evening
what could he be doing
i waited
every moment felt like an eternity
but motome did not return
we never saw him again
ill be back by evening
so please look after kingo
those were his final words
as he went out the door
and that was the last i saw
of motome chijiiwa
but then
around 900 that night
he did return home
only not on his own
he was borne home by a party
of retainers from the house of iyi
most courteously
this was the request
with which motome chijiiwa
came to us
but our forecourt is a busy place
and would have been most inconvenient
so we offered him our courtyard and saw
to his needs with all due propriety
thus allowing him to fulfill his wish
and perform harakiri
we understand there have lately been
incidents all across edo
in which ronin present themselves
at the gates of daimyo houses
and threaten to commit harakiri
unless given money
this disgraceful practice has put
many houses at a loss as to what to do
but now we have motome chijiiwa
a samurai of true valor
who carried out his resolve
to die honorably
and we have
the members of the iyi clan
who responded appropriately
to facilitate his wishes
in contrast to many disgraceful ronin
and the spineless timidity
of other daimyo households
both parties in this instance
acted in an exemplary manner
that will open eyes and clear the air
it is truly an occasion
for mutual congratulations
we bid you -
wait
to avoid any misunderstanding
we must show the blades
oh yes
for the record we wish you to examine
the swords chijiiwa was carrying
you will note
that both blades are of bamboo
bamboo
as you can see
both are made of bamboo
no one must accuse us later
of having switched blades
so take a good look
is it clear
in that case
motome must have borrowed
a blade from your household
no he did not
he died magnificently
using his own blade
motome killed himself
with that bamboo blade
exactly
the entire household
witnessed the spectacle
of harakiri performed
with a bamboo blade
as you may imagine
it was an unsightly affair
it would have been more fitting
for a samurai
to end his life with a true blade
which is a warrior soul
now then
we bid you good night
miho wept
she wept
and wept
motome
forgive me
i
i had no idea
you had even sold your blades
for miho sake
you even sold your blades
but i but i
i would never let this go
it never entered my mind
the stupid thing
was too dear to me
and i clung to it
to this stupid -
with his fever still raging
and in a coma
kingo died two days later
three days after that
as if chasing after him
miho died as well
thus did hanshiro tsugumo
find himself utterly alone in the world
having lost every last person
he had ever cared about
master tsugumo
does that conclude your story
yes i suppose so
there just one more thing
may all those here listen carefully
to what im about to say
no matter how grinding
his poverty and hunger
for a samurai to present himself
in someone else entryway
and declare that he wishes
to commit harakiri there
is an unspeakable act
that can in no way be excused
however
the manner in which
the house of iyi handled the matter
surely left a great deal to be desired
if a samurai risks shame and ridicule
to beg for a day or two grace
he must surely have good reason
a simple inquiry
as to the reason for the request
would have told so much
yet with this many
witnesses present
not a single one among you
had the consideration to ask
his wife lay gasping for breath
on the very verge of death
while his beloved son burned with fever
in dire need of a doctor
motome no doubt wished
to explain the situation to me
make whatever last effort
he could for his son
before turning all further care
over to me
and then return here
to the house of iyi
hanshiro tsugumo
enough of your self-serving excuses
what
as to motome chijiiwa -
the circumstances that drove him here
were no doubt complex
but it was he who declared
his wish to commit harakiri
what followed upon that request
may not have been what he intended
but he reaped
what he himself sowed
he was in no position to complain
or to blame or condemn anyone
at that point
his was but to cast all else aside
and die a magnificent death
to face death without wavering -
that is truly the way of the samurai
but what did this man do
he cravenly asked
for a day or two grace
one might well accuse him
of having gone mad
true enough
motome had indeed gone mad
but i say good for him
i praise him for it
he may have been a samurai
but he was also
a man of flesh and blood
he could not live on air alone
when he has reached
the point of no return
even a man as strong as motome
will go mad trying to protect his family
and i would praise him for it
theyll call him the bamboo ronin
not only samurai but townspeople too
will scoff at his wavering
but let them laugh all they want
who can fathom the depths
of another man heart
thanks to the shogunate ruthless policy
of wiping out the provincial lords
countless samurai lost their masters
and were cast out
to wander the depths of hell
how can those who never wanted for food
or clothing understand their misery
to those who find motome
loathsome for his pleading i ask
what if you found yourself
in the same position
would you do any differently
after all
this thing we call samurai honor
is ultimately nothing but a facade
is that your grievance
grievance
is that what youre trying to tell us
that samurai honor
is nothing but a facade
yes
even if i say i want
to commit harakiri
they surely wont actually
make me do it
such wishful thinking
is where these ronin go wrong
if a man says he wants
to commit harakiri we will let him
in fact since he has proposed it himself
well make sure he does
that is the policy of the house of iyi
for us samurai honor
is no mere facade
and so hanshiro tsugumo too
has come here
with no intention of committing harakiri
but rather out of deep bitterness
over the manner in which the iyi clan
treated his son-in-law motome chijiiwa
and the desire to vent
his many grudges
is that what you think
that not for me to say
you can only look into your own heart
but all the same
you have no intention
of letting me leave here alive
that is my decision to make
i need make no excuses to you
counselor
there is a proverb the suspicious mind
conjures its own demons
do you know it
when i say i will disembowel myself
i truly mean it
yet even after all i have said
you still refuse to -
suppose i were to go on living
what could i possibly have
to look forward to
the fact is i can hardly wait
to join motome and miho and kingo
in that world to which
they have gone ahead
but i would never be able
to face them
were i to go empty-handed
i think you can understand that
i thought perhaps once i had explained
then even members of the iyi clan
would surely say
oh so that how it was
perhaps we were overzealous that day
in rushing to that end
anyone can see that our handling
of the situation was less than ideal
perhaps there were ways
in which we carried things too far
no doubt both parties could have
conducted themselves to better effect
if i could take with me
even a single word in this vein
it would be a comfort to motome
was this not the most fitting gift
i could hope to take him
such were my thoughts
but i see now it was nothing
but wishful thinking
if you can see that
then it makes the rest easy
this world does not bend
to sentimental tales
if you really think
that samurai honor
is ultimately nothing more
than a facade
then you never had a chance
of swaying us
so in the end
these have been nothing but the
useless grumblings of a cranky old man
but it does no good
to lament that now
well then
forgive me
for my long-winded recitation
i will now proceed with the ritual
wait
before that
i must return some items
that belong to this house
for easier identification
i have placed name tags on each
please examine them carefully
master hayato yazaki
and master umenosuke kawabe -
i understand theyre both among
the best swordsmen of the iyi clan
held in high esteem
for their bravery and honor
but counselor
gentlemen
let me set your minds at ease
i took only their topknots
not their lives
in the case of hayato yazaki
it was six days ago
hold it
in the case of umenosuke kawabe
it was five days ago on may 8th
however
when it came to that master swordsman
of the shindo-munen-ichi school
master hikokuro omodaka
i had a little more difficulty
perhaps aware of what had happened
to yazaki and kawabe
i could not catch him off guard
in fact to be honest
i found myself at quite a loss
as to how to deal
with master omodaka
may i enter
if you reach for your sword
ill slice you in one motion
from shoulder to waist
but i fear
the lintel will catch
the tip of my blade
if you lunge to the side
then this pillar will get in the way
it took a few days to locate your home
my apologies for the delay
i ask you to make ready
this is obviously no place
for a sword duel
it a bit far but i must ask you
to accompany me to gojiin-gawara
as miserable a hovel as this is
your landlord will be inconvenienced
if you do not return
and without someone to retrieve your remains
your soul will wander aimlessly
i suggest you leave a note
it should indicate youre going
to gojiin-gawara
for a duel with hikokuro omodaka
of the iyi clan
taking advantage of the wind
was brilliant
but a blade can do more than cut
it can also stab
or even snap another blade in two
swordsmanship untested in battle
is like the art of swimming
mastered on dry land
on the other hand
i had not seen battle either
since the siege of osaka castle
6 years ago
taking his head
would have been difficult enough
but taking only his topknot
proved more difficult still
whatever the differences in skill
for a samurai to have
his topknot taken
is the same
as having his head stricken off
it is an ineptitude a disgrace
that can scarcely be atoned for
even by death
yet these men claim illness
and shirk their duties
while waiting for their topknots
to grow back counselor
this house boasts of its red armor
and martial valor
but it seems that even
in the great house of iyi
samurai honor is nothing more
than a facade
maniac
cut him down
fall back
hanshiro tsugumo
has been killed counselor
and our casualties
what were the casualties
among our men
masakatsu sugita sobei uemura
ichiro shinmen uemon yoshioka -
four dead
eight more seriously wounded
the ronin from hiroshima
hanshiro tsugumo
committed harakiri
all our own men died of illness
the house of iyi has no retainers
who could be felled or wounded
by some half-starved ronin
former retainer of the fukushima clan
hanshiro tsugumo
committed harakiri honorably
according to his wish
all our men died of illness
their deaths have nothing to do
with tsugumo
furthermore we cannot allow
any more to die of illness
see that the wounded
are treated immediately
i have just returned counselor
hikokuro omodaka
last night at his home -
kawabe and yazaki both claim illness
but in fact -
fool
why did you not order them
to commit harakiri on the spot
go back immediately
and order them to do so
and take some skilled swordsmen
with you
if they fail to willingly disembowel
themselves make them do it by force
of course these two men and omodaka
too did not officially commit harakiri
they died of illness
sire
imbecile
you werent born yesterday
you know the ways of the world
how can you not realize
the implications idiot
i am on my way sire
the former retainer of the fukushima clan
hanshiro tsugumo
died by harakiri
at 600 in the evening
his speech and behavior
had been somewhat erratic
many of those present felt
he showed signs of derangement
furthermore it has become clear
that when another former retainer
of the fukushima clan
one motome chijiiwa asked to commit
harakiri in january of this year
we did not err in our chosen response
word of the martial rigor of this house
echoed throughout edo
in the present case too
word of our resolute handling
spread across the city
before two days were out
as a result on the third day
in a formal session at edo castle
lord doi took the occasion
to confer words of praise
upon our young master bennosuke
as follows
at peace yet ever vigilant
let the house of iyi
continue to embrace this principle
and your fortunes are sure to prosper
for ages to come
the 6th day of may
harakiri
the end
