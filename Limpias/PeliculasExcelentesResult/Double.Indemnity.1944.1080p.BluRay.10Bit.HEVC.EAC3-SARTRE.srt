office memorandum
walter neff to barton keyes claims manager
los angeles july 6 938
dear keyes
i suppose youll call this
a confession when you hear it
well i dont like the word confession
i just want to set you right about
something you couldnt see
because it was smack up against your nose
you think youre such a hot
potato as a claims manager
such a wolf on a phony claim
maybe you are but let take a
look at that dietrichson claim
accident and double indemnity
you were pretty good in there
for a while keyes
you said it wasnt an accident check
you said it wasnt suicide check
you said it was murder check
you thought you had it cold didnt you
all wrapped up in tissue paper
with pink ribbons around it
it was perfect
except it wasnt because
you made one mistake
just one little mistake
when it came to picking the
killer you picked the wrong guy
you want to know who killed dietrichson
hold tight to that
cheap cigar of yours keyes
i killed dietrichson
me walter neff insurance salesman
35 years old unmarried no visible scars
until a while ago that is
yes i killed him
i killed him for money
and for a woman
and i didnt get the money
and i didnt get the woman
pretty isnt it
it all began last may
around the end of may it was
id been out to glendale to deliver
a policy on some dairy trucks
on the way back i remembered this auto
renewal near los feliz boulevard
so i drove over there
it was one of those
california spanish houses
everyone was nuts about 0 or 5 years ago
this one mustve cost somebody about $30000
that is if he ever finished paying for it
is mr dietrichson in
who wants to see him
my name is neff walter neff
if youre selling something--
look it mr dietrichson i want to talk to
and it not magazine subscriptions
listen mr dietrichson is not in
how soon do you expect him
hell be home when he gets here
if that any help to you
what is it nettie who is it
it for mr dietrichson
im mrs dietrichson what is it
how do you do mrs dietrichson
im walter neff pacific all risk
pacific all what
the pacific all risk insurance company
it about some renewals on the automobiles
ive been trying to contact your
husband for the past two weeks
but he never in his office
ls there anything i can do
the insurance ran out on the 5th
id hate to think of your
having a smashed fender
or something while youre not
fully covered
perhaps i know what you mean mr neff
ive just been taking a sunbath
no pigeons around i hope
about those policies mrs dietrichson
i hate to take up your time but
oh that all right
if youll wait till i put
something on ill be right down
nettie show mr neff into the living room
where would the living room be
in there but they keep the liquor locked up
it all right i always carry my own keys
the living room was still stuffy
from last night cigars
the windows were closed
and the sunshine coming in
through the venetian blinds
showed up the dust in the air
on the piano in a couple of fancy
frames were mr dietrichson and lola
his daughter by his first wife
they had a bowl of those
little red goldfish
on the table behind the big davenport
but to tell you the truth keyes
i wasnt a whole lot interested
in goldfish right then
or in auto renewals or in mr
dietrichson and his daughter lola
i was thinking about that dame upstairs
and the way she had looked at me
and i wanted to see her again close
without that silly staircase between us
i wasnt long was i
not at all mrs dietrichson
hope ive got my face on straight
it perfect for my money
neff is the name isnt it
yeah
with two f like in philadelphia
if you know the story
what story
the philadelphia story
suppose we sit down and you
tell me about the insurance
my husband never tells me anything
well it on your two cars
the lasalle and the plymouth
weve been handling this insurance for mr
dietrichson for three years
and wed hate to see the policies lapse
that a honey of an anklet
youre wearing mrs dietrichson
as i was saying wed hate
to see the policies lapse
of course we give them 30 days
that all were allowed to give
i guess he been too busy down
at long beach in the oil fields
couldnt i catch him at home
some evening for a few minutes
i suppose so but he never
home much before 800
that fine with me
youre not connected with the
automobile club are you
no the all risk mrs dietrichson why
somebody from the automobile
club has been trying to get him
do they have a better rate
if your husband a member
no he isnt
well then hed have to join the club and
pay the membership fee to start with
i never knock the other fellow
merchandise mrs dietrichson
the automobile club fine i can
do just as well for you though
i have a very attractive policy here
it wouldnt take me two minutes to
put it in front of your husband
for instance were writing a new
kind of 50 % retention feature
in the collision coverage
youre a smart insurance man
arent you mr neff
well ive been at it  years
doing pretty well
it a living
you handle just automobile
insurance or all kinds
all kinds fire earthquake theft
public liability group insurance
industrial stuff and so on
right down the line
accident insurance
accident insurance sure mrs dietrichson
wish youd tell me what
engraved on that anklet
just my name
as for instance
phyllis
phyllis huh
i think i like that
but youre not sure
id have to drive it around
the block a couple of times
mr neff why dont you drop by
tomorrow evening around 830
hell be in then
who
my husband you were anxious
to talk to him werent you
yeah i was but im sort of
getting over the idea
if you know what i mean
there a speed limit in this state mr
neff 45 miles an hour
how fast was i going officer
id say around 90
suppose you get down off your
motorcycle and give me a ticket
suppose i let you off
with a warning this time
suppose it doesnt take
suppose i have to whack you
over the knuckles
suppose i bust out crying and
put my head on your shoulder
suppose you try putting it
on my husband shoulder
that tears it
830 tomorrow evening then
that what i suggested
will you be here too
i guess so i usually am
same chair same perfume same anklet
i wonder if i know what you mean
i wonder if you wonder
it was a hot afternoon
and i can still remember
the smell of honeysuckle
all along that street
how could i have known that murder can
sometimes smell like honeysuckle
maybe you would have known keyes
the minute she mentioned accident
insurance but i didnt
i felt like a million
i went back to the office
to see if i had any mail
it was the day you had that truck
driver from inglewood on the carpet
remember keyes
mr neff mr keyes wants to see you
he been yelling for you all afternoon
is he sore or just frothing
at the mouth a little
park this for me will you sweetheart
hello walter
hi george
come on come on garlopis
youre not kidding anybody
with that line of bull
youre in a jam and you know it
says you
all i want is my money
says you
all youre gonna get
is the cops hello walter
this is sam garlopis from inglewood
sure i know mr garlopis
wrote a policy on his truck
how are you mr garlopis
i aint so good my truck burned down
yeah now look garlopis
every month hundreds of claims
come to this desk
some of them are phonies
and i know which ones
how do i know because
my little man tells me
what little man
the little man in here
every time one of these phonies comes
along it ties knots in my stomach
i cant eat
yours is one of them garlopis that
how i knew your claim was crooked
so what did i do
i sent a tow car over to your
garage this afternoon
and they yanked up that
burned-out truck of yours
and what did they find
they found what was left
of a neat pile of shavings
what shavings
the ones you soaked with
kerosene and dropped a match on
look mister im just a poor guy
maybe i made a mistake
that one way of putting it
i aint feeling so good mr keyes
here just a minute sign
this and youll feel fine
sign what
it a waiver on your claim right here
here
here
now youre an honest man again
goodbye garlopis
but i aint got no more truck
$2600 is lot of dough where i live
what the matter garlopis dont
you know how to open the door
just put your hand on the
knob turn it to the left
now pull it toward you
that the boy
thank you mr keyes
what kind of an outfit is this anyway
are we an insurance company or just
a bunch of dimwitted amateurs
to write a policy on a mug like that
now wait a minute keyes
i dont rate this beef
i clipped a note to that
garlopis application
to have him thoroughly investigated
before we accepted the risk
i know you did walter
im not beefing at you it the company
it the way they do things
the way they dont do things
the way theyll write anything just
to get it down on the sales sheet
and im the guy that has to sit here
up to my neck in phony claims
so they wont throw more money out the
window than they take in at the door
okay turn the record over
let hear the other side
well i get darn sick of trying to pick up
after a gang of fast-talking salesmen
dumb enough to sell
life insurance to a guy
who sleeps in the same bed
with four rattlesnakes
walter ive had 26 years of this
and let me tell you im getting--
yeah and youve loved
every minute of it keyes
you love it only you worry about it too
darn much you and your little man
youre so darn conscientious
youre driving yourself crazy
you wouldnt even say today is tuesday
unless you looked at the calendar
then youd check to see if it was
this year or last year calendar
then youd find out
who printed the calendar
and find out if their calendar checked
with the world almanac calendar
now that enough from you walter
now get out of here
before i throw my desk at you
i love you too
i really did too you old crab
always yelling your head off
always sore at everybody
but you never fooled me with your
song and dance not for a second
i kind of always knew that behind
the cigar ashes on your vest
you had a heart as big as a house
back in my office there was a phone
message from mrs dietrichson
about the renewals
she didnt want me to come tomorrow evening
she wanted me to come thursday
afternoon at 330 instead
i had a lot of stuff lined up
for that thursday afternoon
including a trip down to santa monica
to see a couple of live prospects
about some group insurance
but i kept thinking
about phyllis dietrichson
and the way that anklet
of hers out into her leg
hello mr neff arent you coming in
im considering it
i hope you didnt mind
my changing the appointment
last night wasnt so convenient
that all right
i was working on my stamp collection anyway
i was just fixing some iced tea
would you like a glass
yeah unless youve got a bottle
of beer that not working
there may be some i never
know what in the icebox
nettie
about those renewals mr neff
i talked to my husband about it
oh you did
yes hell renew with you he told me so
as a matter of fact i thought
hed be here this afternoon
but he not
no
that terrible
nettie
oh i forgot today the maids day off
never mind the beer iced tea will be fine
lemon sugar
fix it your way
as long as it the maid day off maybe
there something i can do for you
like running the vacuum cleaner
fresh
i used to peddle vacuum cleaners
not much money but you
learn a lot about life
i didnt think youd learned it
from a correspondence course
whered you pick up this tea drinking
youre not english are you
no californian
born right here in los angeles
they say all native
californians come from iowa
mr neff i--
make it walter huh
walter
that right
tell me walter on this insurance
how much commission do you make
twenty percent why
i thought perhaps i could throw a
little more business your way
i can always use it
i was thinking about my husband
i worry a lot about him
down in those oil fields
it very dangerous
not for an executive is it
he doesnt just sit behind a desk
he right down there
with those drilling crews
it got me worried sick
you mean some dark night a
crown block might fall on him
please dont talk like that
but that the idea
the other day a casing line
snapped and caught the foreman
he in the hospital with a broken back
that bad
it got me jittery just thinking about it
suppose something like that
happened to my husband
it could
well
dont you think he ought to have accident insurance
mmm-hmm
what kind of insurance could he have
enough to cover doctors and hospital bills
say $25 a week cash benefit
and hed rate around $50000 capital sum
capital sum what that
in case he gets killed
maybe i shouldnt have said that
i suppose you have to think of
everything in your business
well your husband would understand
im sure i could sell him on the idea
of some accident protection
why dont i talk to him about it
you could try but he pretty tough-going
theyre all tough at first
he has a lot on his mind
he doesnt seem to want
to listen to anything
except maybe a baseball game on the radio
sometimes we sit here all evening
and never say a word to each other
sounds pretty dull
so i just sit and knit
is that what you married him for
maybe i like the way
his thumbs hold up the wool
anytime his thumbs get tired
only with me around
you wouldnt have to knit
wouldnt i
you bet your life you wouldnt
wonder if a little rum
would get this up on its feet
i want to ask you something walter
could i get an accident policy for
him without bothering him at all
how that again
it would make it easier for you too
you wouldnt even have to talk to him
i have a little allowance of my own
i could pay for it and he
neednt know anything about it
why shouldnt he know
because he doesnt want accident insurance
he superstitious about it
a lot of people are that funny isnt it
if there was a way to get it like
that all the worry would be over
see what i mean walter
sure i got good eyesight
you mean you want him to have the
policy without him knowing it
and that means without the insurance
company knowing that he doesnt know it
that the setup isnt it
is there anything wrong with it
no i think it lovely
then if some dark wet night
that crown block did fall on him--
what crown block
only sometimes it cant quite make it on
its own it has to have a little help
i dont know what youre talking about
of course it doesnt have
to be a crown block
it can be a car backing over him or he
could fall out of the upstairs window
any little thing like that
just so it a morgue job
are you crazy not that crazy
goodbye mrs dietrichson
what the matter
look baby you cant get away with it
you want to knock him off dont you
that a horrible thing to say
whatd you think i was anyway
a guy that walks into a good looking
dame front parlor and says
good afternoon i sell
accident insurance on husbands
you got one that been around too long
one youd like to turn into
a little hard cash
just give me a smile
and ill help you collect
boy what a dope you must think i am
i think youre rotten
i think youre swell so long
as im not your husband
get out of here
you bet ill get out of here baby
ill get out of here but quick
so i let her have it
straight between the eyes
she didnt fool me
for a minute not this time
i knew i had hold of a red-hot poker
and the time to drop it was
before it burned my hand off
i stopped at a drive-in for a bottle of
beer the one i had wanted all along
only i wanted it worse now to get rid
of the sour taste of her iced tea
and everything that went with it
i didnt want to go back to the office
so i dropped by a bowling alley
at third and western
and rolled a few lines
to get my mind thinking about
something else for a while
i didnt feel like eating dinner when i
left and i didnt feel like a show
so i drove home put the car
away and went up to my apartment
it had begun to rain outside
and i watched it get dark
and didnt even turn on the light
that didnt help me either
i was all twisted up inside
and i was still holding on
to that red-hot poker
and right then it came over me that i
hadnt walked out on anything at all
that the hook was too strong
that this wasnt the end between her and me
it was only the beginning
so at 800 the bell would ring and id know
who it was without even having to think
as if it was the most
natural thing in the world
hello you forgot your hat this afternoon
did i
dont you want me to bring it in
sure
put it on the chair
howd you know where i live
it in the phone book
it raining
yeah
peel off your coat and sit down
your husband out
yes long beach theyre
spudding in a new well
he phoned hed be late about 930
it about time you said
you were glad to see me
i knew you wouldnt leave it like that
like what
like it was this afternoon
i must have said something that gave
you a terribly wrong impression
you must never think anything
like that about me walter
okay
no it not okay
not if you dont believe me
what do you want me to do
i want you to be nice to me
like the first time you came to the house
it cant be like the first time
something happened
i know it has
it happened to us
i feel as if he was watching me
not that he cares not anymore
he keeps me on a leash so
tight i cant breathe
he in long beach isnt he relax
maybe i oughtnt to have come
maybe you oughtnt
you want me to go
if you want to
right now
sure right now
im crazy about you baby
im crazy about you walter
that perfume on your hair
what the name of it
i dont know i bought it in ensenada
you ought to have some of that
pink wine to go with it
the kind that bubbles all i got is bourbon
bourbon is fine walter
get a couple of glasses will you
club soda
plain water please
you know about six months ago a guy slipped
on a cake of soap in his bathtub
and knocked himself cold and was drowned
only he had accident insurance
so they had an autopsy and
she didnt get away with it
who didnt
his wife
then there was a case of a guy
who was found shot
his wife said he was cleaning a gun
and his stomach got in the way
all she collected was a
three-to-ten stretch in tehachapi
perhaps it was worth it to her
see if you can carry that
as far as the living room
it nice here walter
who takes care of it for you
a colored woman comes in
a couple of times a week
cook your own breakfast
squeeze a grapefruit once in a while
get the rest down at the corner drugstore
sounds wonderful
just strangers beside you
you dont know them and you dont hate them
you dont have to sit across the table
and smile at him and that daughter
of his every morning of your life
what daughter you mean the
little girl on the piano
lola she lives with us
he thinks a lot more of her
than he does of me
you ever think of a divorce
he wouldnt give me a divorce
i suppose because itd
cost him too much money
he hasnt got any money not since
he went into the oil business
but he had when you married him
yes he had and i wanted a home why not
but that not the only reason
i was his wife nurse
she was sick a long time when she
died he was terribly broken up
i pitied him so
and now you hate him
yes walter he so mean to me
every time i buy a dress or a pair
of shoes he yells his head off
he never lets me go anywhere
he keeps me shut up
he always been mean to me
even his life insurance all
goes to that daughter of his
that lola
nothing for you at all
no and nothing is just
what im worth to him
so you lie awake in the dark and
listen to him snore and get ideas
walter i dont want
to kill him i never did
not even when he gets drunk
and slaps my face
only sometimes you wish he was dead
perhaps i do
then you wish it was an accident and
you had that policy for $50000
is that it
perhaps that too
the other night we drove home from a party
he was drunk again
when we drove into the garage he just sat
there with his head on the steering wheel
and the motor still running
and i thought what it would be
like if i didnt switch it off
just closed the garage doors
and left him there
ill tell you what itd be like
if you had that accident policy and
tried to pull a monoxide job
weve got a guy in our office named keyes
for him a setup like thatd be just
like a slice of rare roast beef
in three minutes hed know
it wasnt an accident
in 0 minutes youd be sitting
under the hot lights
in a half-hour youd be signing
your name to a confession
but walter i didnt do it
and im not going to do it
not if there an insurance
company in the picture baby
they know more tricks
than a carload of monkeys
and if there a death mixed up
in it you havent got a prayer
theyll hang you just as sure
as ten dimes will buy a dollar
and i dont want you to hang baby
stop thinking about it will you
so we just sat there
she started crying softly like the rain
on the window and we didnt say anything
maybe she had stopped thinking
about it but i hadnt
i couldnt
because it all tied up with something
id been thinking about for years
since long before i ever
ran into phyllis dietrichson
because you know how it is keyes
in this business you cant sleep
for trying to figure out all the
tricks they could pull on you
youre like the guy
behind the roulette wheel
watching the customers to make
sure they dont crook the house
and then one night you get to thinking
how you could crook the house yourself
and do it smart
because youve got that wheel
right under your hands
you know every notch in it by heart
and you figure all you need
is a plant out front
a shill to put down the bet
and suddenly the doorbell rings
and the whole setup is right
there in the room with you
look keyes im not trying
to whitewash myself
i fought it only i guess
i didnt fight it hard enough
the stakes were $50000 but they
were the life of a man too
a man whod never done me any dirt except
he was married to a woman
he didnt care anything about
and i did
will you phone me walter
i hate him i loathe going back to him
you believe me dont you walter
sure i believe you
i cant stand it anymore
what if they did hang me
theyre not going to hang you baby
it better than going on this way
theyre not gonna hang you because
youre gonna do it and im gonna help you
do you know what youre saying
sure i know what im saying
were gonna do it
and were gonna do it right
and im the guy that knows how
walter youre hurting me
there not going to be any slip-up
nothing sloppy nothing weak
it got to be perfect
call me tomorrow but not from your house
from a booth
and watch your step every single minute
this has got to be perfect you understand
straight down the line
straight down the line
that was it keyes
the machinery had started to
move and nothing could stop it
the first thing we had to do was fix
him up with that accident policy
i knew he wouldnt buy but all i wanted
was his signature on an application
sol had to get him to sign without
his knowing what he was signing
and i wanted another witness besides
phyllis to hear me give him a sales talk
i was trying to think
with your brains keyes
because i wanted all the answers ready
for all the questions you were gonna
spring as soon as dietrichson was dead
a couple of nights later i went to the house
everything looked fine except i didnt
like the witness phyllis had brought in
it was dietrichson daughter lola
and it made me feel
a little queer in the belly
to have her sitting right there in the
room playing chinese checkers
as if nothing were going to happen
i suppose you realize mr
dietrichson
that not being an employee
you are not covered by the state
compensation insurance act
the only way you can protect yourself is
by having a personal policy of your own
yeah i know all about that
the next thing youll tell me i need
earthquake insurance and lightning
insurance and hail insurance
if we bought all the insurance
they can think up
wed stay broke paying for
it wouldnt we honey
what keeps us broke is you going out
and buying five hats at a crack
who needs a hat in california
dollar for dollar mr dietrichson
accident insurance is the
cheapest coverage you can buy
well maybe some other time
mr neff i had a tough day
just as you say
suppose we just settle that
automobile insurance tonight
sure
all well need on that is for you to
sign the application for renewal
phyllis do you mind
if we dont finish this game
it bores me stiff
got something better to do
yes i have
father is it all right if i run along now
run along where who with
just anne were going roller-skating
anne who
anne matthews
it not that nino zachetti again is it
it better not be that zachetti guy
if i ever catch you with that--
it anne matthews i told you
and i also told you
were going roller-skating
im meeting her at the corner of vermont
and franklin the northwest corner
in case youre interested
and im late already
i hope that all quite clear
good night father
good night phyllis
good night miss dietrichson
im sorry good night mr
neff
good night mr neff
a great little fighter for her weight
now if youll just
sign these mr dietrichson
sign what
the applications for the auto renewals
so youll be covered until
the new policies are issued
when will that be
about a week
just so im covered when i drive up north
san francisco
palo alto
he was a stanford man mr neff
and he still goes to his
class reunion every year
what wrong with that cant i have
a little fun even once a year
great football school stanford
did you play football mr dietrichson
left guard
almost made the varsity too
where do i sign
the bottom line
both copies please
sign twice huh
yes one is the agent copy
i need it for my files
filesduplicates triplicates
thank you mr dietrichson
dont worry about the check i can pick
it up at your office some morning
how much you taking me for
$4750
i think that enough insurance
for one evening mr neff
plenty
bring me some soda when you come up phyllis
good night mr neff
good night mr dietrichson
i think you left your hat
in the hall mr neff
good night mr neff
all right walter
fine
he signed it didnt he
sure he signed it you saw him
now listen that trip to palo alto
when does he leave
end of the month
he drives huh
he always drives
not this time youre gonna
make him take the train
why
because it all worked out for a train
listen baby there a clause
in every accident policy
a little thing called double indemnity
the insurance companies put it in as
a sort of come-on for the customers
that means they pay double
on certain accidents
the kind that almost never happen
like for instance if a guy
is killed on the train
they pay $00000 instead of $50000
i see
were hitting it for the limit baby
that why it got to be the train
itll be the train walter
just the way you want it
straight down the line
hello mr neff
it me
is anything wrong
ive been waiting for you
for me why
i thought you could let me ride
with you if youre going my way
which way would that be
down the hill down vermont
sure vermont and franklin
northwest corner wasnt it
be glad to miss dietrichson
going roller-skating huh
you like roller-skating
i can take it or leave it
only tonight youre leaving it
yes lam
im having a very tough time at home
my father doesnt understand
me and phyllis hates me
sounds tough all right
that why i have to lie sometimes
you mean it not vermont and franklin
it vermont and franklin all right
only it not anne matthews
it nino zachetti
you wont tell on me will you
id have to think it over
nino not what my father says at all
he just had bad luck
he was doing premed at usc
and working nights as an usher
in a theater downtown
got behind in his credits flunked out
then he lost his job for talking back
he so hot-headed
becomes expensive doesnt it
guess my father thinks nobody
good enough for his daughter
except maybe the guy that owns standard oil
i wish hed see it my way
i cant give nino up
itll all straighten out miss dietrichson
i suppose it will sometime this is
the corner right here mr neff
nino over here nino
this is mr neff nino
hello nino
the name is zachetti
nino please mr neff gave
me a ride from the house
i told him all about us
why does he have to get told about us
we dont have to worry about mr neff nino
im not doing any worrying
just dont you broadcast so much
well what the matter with you nino
why he a friend
i dont have any friends
if i did i like to pick them myself
come on
look sonny she needed a ride
so i brought her along
is that anything to get tough about
all right lola make up your mind
are you coming or arent you
of course im coming
dont mind him mr neff
and thanks a lot for the ride
youre awfully sweet nino
she was a nice kid
maybe he was a little better than he sounded
but right then it gave me a nasty feeling
to be thinking about them at all
with that briefcase right behind my head
that had her father signature in it
and what that signature meant
it meant he was a dead pigeon
it was only a question of time
and not very much time at that
you know that big market
up on los feliz keyes
that the place phyllis and i
had picked for a meeting place
i already had most of the plan in my head
but a lot of details had to be worked out
and she had to know them all
by heart when the time came
we had to be very careful from now on
we couldnt let anybody see us together
we couldnt even talk to
each other on the telephone
not from her house or at my office anyway
so she was to be in the market every
morning about 00 buying stuff
and i could sort of run into
her there any day i wanted to
sort of accidentally on purpose
walter i wanted to--
not so loud
i wanted to talk to you
ever since yesterday
let me talk first it all set
the accident policy came through
ive got it in my pocket
i got his check too i saw
him down in the oil fields
he thought he was paying
for the auto insurance
the check just made out to the
company so it could be for anything
but you have to send a check
for the auto insurance see
itll be all right that way because
one of the cars is in your name
open your bag quick
can you get in the safe-deposit box
yes we both have keys
fine
but dont put the policy in there yet
ill tell you when
remember you never saw it you never
even touched it you understand
im not a fool
okay when is he leaving on the train
that just it he isnt going
what
that what ive been trying to tell you
the trip is off
what happened
mister could you reach me
that package of baby food
that one up there
i dont know why they always put
what i want on the top shelf
go ahead im listening
he had a fall-down at the well broke his leg
it in a cast
broke his leg
what do we do now walter
nothing we just wait
wait for what
until he can take the train
i told you it got to be the train
but we cant wait i cant go on like this
look were not gonna grab a hammer and
do it quick just to get it over with
there are other ways
were not gonna do it other ways
but we cant leave it like this
what do you suppose would happen if he
found out about the accident policy
plenty but not as bad as
sitting in that death house
dont ever talk like that
dont let start losing our heads that all
it not our heads
it our nerve were losing
excuse me
were gonna do it right that all i said
it the waiting that getting me
it getting me just as bad baby
but weve got to wait
maybe we have walter only
it so tough without you
it like a wall between us
i better go baby im
thinking of you every minute
after that a full week
went by and i didnt see her once
i tried to keep my mind off
her and off the whole idea
i kept telling myself that maybe those
fates they say watch over you
had gotten together and broken
his leg to give me a way out
then it was the 5th of june you
may remember that date keyes
you came into my office
around 300 in the afternoon
hello keyes
i just came from norton office
the semiannual sales records are out
youre high man walter that twice in a row
congratulations
thanks how would you like a cheap drink
how would you like a $50 cut in salary
do i laugh now or wait till it gets funny
no im serious
ive just been talking to norton too
much stuff piling up on my desk
too much pressure on my nerves
i spend half the night
walking up and down in my bed
ive got to have an assistant
and i thought of you
me why pick on me
well because ive got a crazy
idea you might be good at the job
that crazy all right im a salesman
yeah a peddler a gladhander a backslapper
youre too good to be a salesman
nobody too good to be a salesman
phooey
all you guys do is just ring doorbells and
dish out a smooth line of monkey talk
what troubling you
is that $50 cut isnt it
well thatd trouble anybody
now look walter
the job im talking about
takes brains and integrity
it takes more guts than
there is in 50 salesmen
it the hottest job in the business
yeah but it still a desk job
i dont want to be nailed to a desk
deskjob
is that all you can see in it
just a hard chair to park your
pants on from 900 to 500 huh
just a pile of papers to shuffle
around and five sharp pencils
and a scratch pad to make figures on
maybe a little doodling on the side
well that not the way
i look at it walter
to me a claims man is a surgeon
that desk is an operating table
and those pencils are scalpels
and bone chisels
and those papers are not just forms and
statistics and claims for compensation
theyre alive theyre packed with drama
with twisted hopes and crooked dreams
a claims man walter is a
doctor and a bloodhound and a--
who okay hold on a minute
a claims man is a doctor and a bloodhound
and a cop and a judge and a jury
and a father confessor all in one
and you want to tell me
youre not interested
you dont want to work with your brains
all you want to work is with
your finger on the doorbell
for a few bucks more a week
there a dame on your phone
walter neff speaking
i had to call you walter
it very urgent are you with somebody
yes i am cant i call you back margie
no you cant ive only got a minute
it cant wait
listen he going tonight on the train
are you listening
walter yeah im listening margie
only make it snappy will you
he on crutches
the doctor says he can go if he careful
the change will do him good
it wonderful walter just the
way you wanted it on a train
only with the crutches it makes
it much better doesnt it
yeah yeah that 00 % better
hold the line a minute will you
keyes suppose i join you in your office
that all right ill wait
only tell her not to take all day
go ahead
it the 05 from glendale
im driving him
it still the same dark street isnt it
and the signal is three honks on the horn
okay anything else
no
oh uh
what color did you pick
blue navy blue and the
cast is on his left leg
mmm-hmm
yeah that suits me fine
this is it walter im shaking like a leaf
but it straight down
the line for both of us
i love you walter goodbye
sorry keyes
what the matter
dames chasing you again or still
or is it none of my business
if i told you it was a customer--
margie i bet she drinks from the bottle
why dont you settle down
and get married walter
why dont you for instance
i almost did once long time ago
now look keyes ive got
to call on a prospect
even had the church
picked out the dame and i
she had a white satin dress
with flounces on it
i was on my way to the jewelry
store to buy the ring
and then suddenly that little man
in here started working on me
so you went back and had her investigated
yeah and the stuff that came out
shed been dyeing her hair
ever since she was 6
there was a manic depressive in
her family on her mother side
she already had one husband
he was a professional
pool player in baltimore
and as for her brother--
i get the general idea
she was a tramp from a long line of tramps
yeah all right all right
now what do i say to norton what
about this job i want you for
i dont think i want it keyes
thanks just the same
fair enough
only get this i picked you for the job
not because i think youre so darn smart
but because i thought you were a shade
less dumb than the rest of the outfit
guess i was wrong
youre not smarter walter
youre just a little taller
yes keyes
those fates i was talking about
had only been stalling me off
now they had thrown the switch
the gears had meshed
the time for thinking had all run out
i wanted my movements accounted for
up to the last possible moment
so when i left the office i put my rate
book on the desk as if i had forgotten it
that was part of my alibi
from here on it was a question
of following the timetable
move by move
i got home about 700 and
drove right into the garage
this was another item to establish my alibi
hi mr neff
hello charlie
how about giving the heap a wash job
how soon you gonna want it
i got a couple cars ahead of you
any time you get to it charlie
im staying in tonight
okay
up in my apartment
i called lou schwartz
one of the salesmen that shared my office
he lived in westwood so it was a toll
call and thered be a record of it
i told him id forgotten my rate
book and needed some dope
on the public liability bond i was figuring
i changed into a navy blue suit
like dietrichson was going to wear
lou schwartz called me back
and gave me a lot of figures
i stuffed a hand towel and a roll
of adhesive into my pockets
so i could fake something that
looked like a cast on a broken leg
next i stuck a card
inside the telephone box
so that it would fall down if the bell rang
that way id know if anybody had
called me while i was away
then i did the same thing to the
doorbell in case anybody came to see me
i left the apartment by the service stairs
nobody saw me
i walked all the way from my
apartment to the dietrichson house
i didnt want to take the bus
because there was always the chance that
someone might remember seeing me on it
i was being that careful
i could smell that honeysuckle again
only it was even stronger
now that it was night
i slid the garage door open
as quietly as i could
shed backed the sedan in
just the way i told her to
id figured it was safer that way
in case he got into the car
before she drove it out
i got into the back of the car
i lay there on the floor and waited
all the time i was thinking about that
dark street on the way to the station
where i was to do it
and the three honks on the horn
that were to be the signal
about 0 minutes later they came down
all right honey
yeah im all right
ill have the car out in a second
take it easy honey
weve got lots of time yeah
remember what the doctor said
if you get careless
you might end up with a shorter leg
so what i could break the other
one and match them up again
it makes you feel pretty good to
get away from me doesnt it
it only for four days ill
be back monday at the latest
this is not the right street
why did you turn here
what are you doing that for
what are you honking the horn for
you take care of the redcap
and the conductor
dont worry
keep away from me as much as you can
tell them i dont want to be helped
i said dont worry walter
you start as soon as the train leaves
when you get to the refinery turn
off the highway onto the dirt road
from there it exactly
eight-tenths of a mile
to the dump beside the tracks remember
i remember everything
no speeding
you dont want any oops stopping
you with him in the back
walter weve been through
all that so many times
when you leave the highway
turn off all your lights
ill be back on the observation platform
ill drop off as close to the spot as i can
let the train pass
then dim your lights twice

my overcoat back in the section

car 9 section
car 9 section  with pleasure
okay this has gotta be fast
here take his hat pick up the
crutches back on the tracks
okay baby that it
all right let go
on the way back
we went over once more
what she was to do at the inquest
if they had one and about the
insurance when that came up
i was afraid she might go to pieces
a little now that we had done it
but she was perfect no nerves not a
tear not even a blink of the eyes
she dropped me a block
from my apartment house
walter what the matter
arent you going to kiss me
it straight down the line isnt it
i love you walter
i love you baby
it was two minutes past 00 as i
went up the service stairs again
nobody saw me this time either in
the apartment i checked the bells
the cards hadnt moved
no calls no visitors
then i changed my clothes again
that left one last thing to do
i had to go down to the garage i
wanted charlie to see me again
you gonna use your oar after all
im not quite through
well that all right charlie
just going up to the drugstore
to get something to eat
been working upstairs all night my
stomach getting a little sore at me
yes sir mr neff
that was all there was to it
nothing had slipped
nothing had been overlooked
there was nothing to give us away
and yet keyes as i was walking
down the street to the drugstore
suddenly it came over me that
everything would go wrong
it sounds crazy keyes
but it true so help me
i couldnt hear my own footsteps
it was the walk of a dead man
that was the longest night
lever lived through keyes
and the next day was worse when the
story had broke in the papers
and they started talking
about it at the office
and the day after that when
you started digging into it
i kept my hands in my pockets because
i thought they were shaking
i put on dark glasses so
people couldnt see my eyes
and then i took them off again so they
wouldnt get to wondering why i wore them
i tried to hold myself together but
i could feel my nerves pulling me to pieces
oh walter
hello keyes
come along the big boss wants to see us
the dietrichson case
must be
anything wrong
well the guy is dead
we had him insured and it gonna cost us dough
that always wrong
what have they got so far
autopsy report
no heart failure no apoplexy no
predisposing medical cause of any kind
died of a broken neck
when the inquest
had it this morning
his wife and daughter
made the identification
the train people and some of the
passengers told how he went through
to the observation car
it was all over in 45 minutes
verdict accidental death
what do the police figure
that he got tangled up in his
crutches and fell off the train
theyre satisfied
it not their dough come on walter
all right thank
you very much gentlemen
i believe the legal position is now clear
please stand by i may need you later
come in mr keyes you too mr neff
you find this an uncomfortably
warm day mr keyes
im sorry mr norton but i
didnt know this was formal
sit down gentlemen thank you
any new developments
i just talked to this jackson long
distance up in medford oregon
who jackson
he the last man who saw dietrichson alive
they were out on the observation
platform together talking
dietrichson wanted a cigar
and so jackson went back
to get dietrichson cigar case for him
when he returned to the observation
platform no dietrichson
well jackson didnt think
anything was wrong until
a wire caught up with
the train at santa barbara
they found dietrichson body
on the tracks near burbank
very interesting about the cigar case
anything else
no not much
dietrichson secretary says she
didnt know anything about the policy
there a daughter but all she remembers
is neff talking to her father
about accident insurance
at their house one night
i couldnt sell him at first
mr dietrichson opposed it
he said hed think it over
later i saw him in the oil
fields and closed him
he signed the application
and gave me his check
a fine piece of salesmanship
that was mr neff
well there no sense in
pushing neff around
he got the best sales record in the office
are your salesmen supposed to know a
customer is going to fall off the train
fall off a train are we sure
dietrichson fell off the train
i dont get it
you dont mr keyes
then what do you think of this case
this policy might cost us
a great deal of money
as you know it contains
a double indemnity clause
just what is your opinion
no opinion at all
not even a hunch
one of those interesting
little hunches of yours
nope not even a hunch
im surprised mr keyes ive
formed a very definite opinion
i think i know in fact i know i
know what happened to dietrichson
you know you know what
i know it was not an accident
what do you say to that
me
well youve got the ball
let see you run with it
there a widespread feeling that just
because a man has a large office--
yes have her come in please
there a widespread feeling that
just because a man has a large
office he must be an idiot
im having a visitor if you dont mind
no no i want you to stay
and watch me handle this
mrs dietrichson
thank you very much
for coming mrs dietrichson
i assure you i appreciate it
this is mr keyes
how do you do
how do you do
and mr neff
ive met mr neff how do you do
mrs dietrichson
wont you sit down
may i extend our
sympathy in your bereavement
i hesitated before asking you to
come here so soon after your loss
but now that youre here i hope you wont
mind if i plunge straight into business
you know why we asked you to come dont you
no all i know is that your secretary
made it sound very urgent
your husband had an accident
policy with this company
evidently you dont know that
mrs dietrichson
no i remember some talk at the
house but he didnt seem to want it
your husband took the policy out a
few days later mrs dietrichson
youll probably find the policy
among his personal effects
his safe-deposit box hasnt been opened yet
it seems a tax examiner has to be present
please mrs dietrichson
i dont want you to think
youre being subjected to any questioning
but there are a few things
we should like to know
what sort of things
we have the report of the coroner inquest
accidental death
we are not entirely satisfied
in fact we are not satisfied at all
frankly mrs dietrichson we suspect
a suicide
im sorry would you like a glass of water
please
thank you
had your husband been depressed or
moody lately mrs dietrichson
did he have financial worries for instance
he was perfectly all right and i
dont know of any financial worries
let us examine this so-called accident
first your husband takes out this
policy in absolute secrecy why
because he doesnt want his family
to suspect what he intends to do
do what
next he goes on this trip entirely alone
he has to be alone he hobbles all the
way out to the observation platform
very unlikely with his leg in a cast
unless he has a very strong reason
once there he finds he is not alone
there is a man there
what was his name keyes
his name was jackson probably still is
so he gets rid of this jackson with
some flimsy excuse about cigars
and then he is alone and then he does it
does what
he jumps suicide in which case
the company is not liable
you know that of course
now we could go to court--
i dont know anything in fact
i dont know why i came here
just a moment please i said we could
go to court i didnt say we want to
what i want to suggest is
a compromise on both sides
a settlement for a certain sum
a part of the policy value
dont bother mr norton when i came in
here i had no idea you owed me any money
you told me you did
then you told me you didnt
now you tell me you want to pay
me a part of it whatever it is
you want to bargain with me
at a time like this
i dont like your insinuations about my
husband and i dont like your methods
in fact i dont like you mr
norton goodbye gentlemen
nice going mr norton
you sure carried that ball
only you fumbled on the goal line
then you heaved an illegal forward pass
and got thrown for a 40-yard loss
now you cant pick yourself up because
you havent got a leg to stand on
i havent eh she can go to court
and we can prove it was suicide
oh can we
mr norton the first thing that
struck me was that suicide angle
only i dumped it into the wastepaper
basket just three seconds later
you know you ought to take a look at
the statistics on suicide sometime
you might learn a little something
about the insurance business
mr keyes i was raised
in the insurance business
yeah in the front office
come now youve never read an actuarial
table in your life have you
why theyve got 0 volumes on suicide alone
suicide by race by color by occupation
by sex by seasons of the
year by time of day
suicide how committed by poisons
by firearms by drowning by leaps
suicide by poison subdivided
by types of poison
such as corrosive irritant
systemic gaseous narcotic
alkaloid protein and so forth
suicide by leaps subdivided
by leaps from high places
under the wheels of trains
under the wheels of trucks
under the feet of horses from steamboats
but mr norton
of all the cases on record there not
one single case of suicide by leap
from the rear end of a moving train
and do you know how fast
that train was going
at the point where the body was found
5 miles an hour
now how can anybody jump off a
slow moving train like that
with any kind of expectation
that he would kill himself
no no soap mr norton
were sunk and well have to pay
through the nose and you know it
may i have this
come on walter
next time ill rent a tuxedo
i could have hugged you
right then and there keyes
you and your statistics
you were the only one
we were really scared of
and instead you were
almost playing on our team
that evening when i got home
my nerves had eased off
i could feel the ground under my feet again
and it looked like easy going
from there on in
that $00000 looked
as safe for phyllis and me
as if we had the check
already deposited in the bank
hello oh hello baby
sure everything is fine
you were wonderful in norton office
i felt so funny i wanted to
look at you all the time
how do you think i felt baby where are you
at the drugstore just a block away
can i come up
okay but be careful
dont let anybody see you
hello keyes
what on your mind
that broken leg
the guy had a broken leg
what are you talking about
talking about dietrichson he had
accident insurance didnt he
yeah
then he broke his leg didnt he
so what
and he didnt put in a claim
why didnt he put in a claim why
what are you driving at
walter i had dinner two hours
ago and it stuck half way
that little man of yours
is acting up again huh
there something wrong
with the dietrichson case
why because he didnt file a claim
maybe he just didnt have time
maybe he just didnt know that
he was insured
no no that couldnt be it
you delivered the policy
to him personally didnt you
yeah
you got his check
sure i did
got any bicarbonate of soda
no i havent
walter ive been living with
this little man for 26 years
and he never failed me yet
there got to be something wrong
well maybe norton was right
maybe it was suicide
no not suicide
but not an accident either
what else
now look walter
a guy takes out an accident
policy that worth $00000
if he killed on a train
then two weeks later
he is killed on a train
and not in a train accident mind you but
falling off some silly observation oar
do you know what the mathematical
probability of that is
one out of i dont know how many billions
and add to that the broken leg no
it just cant be the way it looks
something has been worked on us
such as what
murder
dont you have any peppermint or something
sorry want a little soda water
no no no
who do you suspect
maybe i like to make
things easy for myself
but i always tend to suspect the beneficiary
you mean the wife
yeah
that wide-eyed dame that just didnt
know anything about anything
youre crazy keyes
she wasnt even on the train
i know she wasnt walter
i dont claim to know how it was
worked or who worked it
but all i know is that it was worked
ive got to get to a drugstore
this thing feels like
a hunk of concrete inside me
good night walter
good night keyes
see you at the office in the morning
yeah
id like to move in on her
right now tonight
if it wasnt for norton and his
striped-pants ideas about company policy
id have the police after her so
fast itd make her head spin
theyd put her through the wringer
and brother the things
they would squeeze out
only you havent got a single
thing to go on keyes
not too much just 26 years experience
all the percentage there is and
this hunk cf concrete in my stomach
can i have one of those things
good night keyes
so long walter
how much does he know
he doesnt know anything
it those stinking hunches of his
and he cant prove anything can he
not if were careful not if we
dont see each other for a while
how long a while
until this dies down
you dont know keyes
once he gets his teeth into
something he never lets go
hell investigate you have you shadowed
hell watch you every minute from now on
you afraid baby
yes im afraid
but not of keyes im afraid of us
were not the same anymore
we did it so we could be together but
instead of that it pulling us apart
isnt it walter
what are you talking about
and you dont really care whether
we see each other or not
shut up baby
pacific all risk good afternoon
hello mr neff
hello
lola dietrichson
dont you remember me
yes yes of course
could i talk with you just a few minutes
somewhere where we could be alone
oh yes come into my office
is it something about what happened
yes mr neff it about my father death
im terribly sorry miss dietrichson
lou do you mind if i use the
office alone for a few minutes
no it all yours walter
look at me mr neff
im not crazy im not hysterical
im not even crying
but i have the awful feeling
that something is wrong
and i had that same feeling once
before when my mother died
when your mother died
we were at lake arrowhead
that was six years ago
we had a cabin there
it was winter and very cold my
mother was very sick with pneumonia
she had a nurse with her
there were just the three of us in the cabin
one night i got up and went
into my mother room
she was delirious with fever
all the bed covers were on the floor
and the windows were wide open
the nurse wasnt in the room
i ran and covered my mother up
as quickly as i could
just then i heard a door open behind me
the nurse stood there
she didnt say a word but there
was a look in her eyes
ill never forget
two days later my mother was dead
do you know who that nurse was
no who
phyllis
i tried to tell my father
but i was just a kid then
he wouldnt listen to me six
months later she married him
and i kind of talked myself out of the idea
she could have done anything like that
but now it all back again now that
something happened to my father too
youre not making sense miss dietrichson
your father fell off a train
yes and two days before he fell off
that train what was phyllis doing
she was in her room in front of a
mirror with a black hat on
pinning a black veil to it
as if she couldnt wait to see
how she would look in mourning
youve had a pretty bad shock
miss dietrichson
arent you just imagining these things
i caught her eyes in the mirror
they had that look in them they
had before my mother died
that same look
you dont like your stepmother do you
isnt it just because she is your stepmother
i loathe her because she did it
she did it for the money
only youre not going to
pay her are you mr neff
she not going to get away with it this
time because im going to speak up
im going to tell everything i know
youd better be careful saying things like--
im not afraid youll see
im sorry
i didnt mean to act like this
all this that youve been telling
me who else have you told
no one
how about your stepmother
of course not
ive moved out
im not living at home anymore
and you havent told that
boyfriend of yours zachetti
im not seeing him anymore we had a fight
where are you living now
i got myself a little apartment in hollywood
four walls and you just
sit and look at them
yes mr neff
so that evening
i took her to dinner
at a mexican restaurant down on olvera
street where nobody would see us
i wanted to cheer her up
the next day was sunday and we
went for a ride down to the beach
she had loosened up a bit
she was even laughing
i had to make sure that she wouldnt tell
that stuff about phyllis to anybody else
it was dynamite whether it was true or not
and i had no chance to talk to phyllis
you were watching her like a hawk keyes
i couldnt even phone her because i
was afraid you had the wires tapped
monday morning there was a note on my
desk that you wanted to see me keyes
for a minute i wondered
if it could be about lola
it was worse
outside your door was the last guy
in the world i wanted to see
come in come in walter
hello keyes
i want to ask you something
after all the years weve known each other
do you mind if i make
a rather blunt statement
about what
about me
walter im a very great man
yeah
this dietrichson business it murder
and murders dont come any neater
as fancy a piece of homicide
as anybody ever ran into
smart tricky almost perfect but
i think papa has it all figured out
figured out and wrapped up in tissue
paper with pink ribbons on it
go ahead im listening
you know what
that guy dietrichson was never on the train
he wasnt
no he wasnt
now look walter you cant
be sure of killing a man
by throwing him off a train
that going 5 miles an hour
the only way you can be sure
is to kill him first
and then throw his body on the tracks
now that would mean either
killing him on the train
or and this is where it really gets
fancy you kill him somewhere else
and put him on the tracks
two possibilities and i
personally buy the second
youre way ahead of me keyes
well look walter it was like this
they killed the guy the wife
and a somebody else
and the somebody else took the crutches
and went on the train as dietrichson
then the somebody else jumped off
then they put the body on the
tracks where the train had passed
an impersonation see a cinch to work
because it was night
very few people were about
they have the crutches to stare at
they never really looked at the man at all
fancy all right keyes but
maybe it a little too fancy
is it i tell you it all
fits together like a watch
now let see what we have
in the way of proof
the only guy who really got a good
look at this supposed dietrichson
is sitting right outside my office
i took the trouble to bring
him down here from oregon
come here mr jackson yes sir mr keyes
these are fine cigars you smoke
two for a quarter
that what i said
well did you study those photographs
yes indeed i studied them thoroughly
very thoroughly
have you made up your mind
mister keyes im a medford man
medford oregon
up in medford we take our time
making up our mind
well were not in medford now
were in a hurry let have it
are these photographs
of the late mr dietrichson
yes
then my answer is no
what do you mean no
i mean this is not
the man that was on the train
will you swear to that
mr keyes im a medford man
medford oregon
if i say it i mean it if i mean
it of course ill swear it
there you are walter there your proof
this is mr neff one of our salesmen
pleased to meet you mr neff
pleased indeed
how are you
very fine thank you
never was better
sit down mr jackson
just how would you describe the man
you saw on the observation platform
well im pretty sure he was a younger man
about 0 or 5 years younger than
the man in these photographs
dietrichson was about 50 wasnt he walter
fifty-one according to the policy
the man i saw was nothing like 5 years old
of course it was pretty dark
out on that platform
come to think of it he tried
to keep his back towards me
but im positive just the same
thank you jackson
of course you understand this
matter is strictly confidential
we may need you again down here in los
angeles if the case comes to court
any time you need me im entirely
at your disposal gentlemen
expenses paid of course
oh yes yes of course
get me lubin in the cashier office
hello lubin this is keyes
listen im sending a man named jackson
down to you with an expense account
well we brought him down here from
medford oregon in connection with
the dietrichson claim
well take care of his hotel bill will you
ever been in oregon mr neff
yeah hell be right down
no never been up there
wait a minute you go trout fishing
maybe i saw you up klamath falls way
nope i dont fish
you dont go fishing
mr neff neff it the name
there a family of neffs in corvallis
no relation
let me see this man an
automobile dealer in corvallis
a very reputable man too im told
all right mr jackson
suppose you go down to the cashier office
room 27 on the th floor
hell take care of your expense account
and your ticket for the train tonight
tonight
tomorrow morning would suit me better
there a very good osteopath in town
id like to see before i leave
osteopath
well just dont put her
on the expense account
well goodbye gentlemen
it been a pleasure
goodbye
there it is walter it beginning
to come apart at the seams already
murder never perfect always
comes apart sooner or later
and when two people are
involved it usually sooner
now we know the dietrichson dame
is in it and a somebody else
pretty soon well know
who that somebody else is
hell show he got to show sometime
somewhere theyve got to meet
their emotions are all kicked up
whether it love or hate doesnt matter
they cant keep away from each other
they may think it twice as safe
because there are two of them
but it isnt twice as safe
it 0 times twice as dangerous
theyve committed a murder
and it not like taking
a trolley ride together
where they can get off at different stops
theyre stuck with each other
and theyve got to ride
all the way to the end of the line
and it a one-way trip and
the last stop is the cemetery
she put in her claim
im gonna throw it right back at her
let her sue us if she dares
ill be ready for her and that somebody else
theyll be digging their own graves
mrs dietrichson this is jerry market
we just got in a shipment of that
english soap you were asking about
will you be coming by today
thank you mrs dietrichson
hello walter
come over here
what the matter everything the matter
keyes is rejecting your claim
he sitting back with his mouth
watering waiting for you to sue
he wants you to sue but youre not going to
what he got to stop me
he got plenty
he figured out how it was worked
he knows it was somebody else on the train
and he dug up a witness
he thinks can prove it
prove it how if he rejects
that claim i have to sue
yeah and then youre in court and a lot
of other things are going to come up
like for instance about you
and the first mrs dietrichson
what about me and the first mrs dietrichson
the way she died
and about that black hat you were trying
on before you needed a black hat
lola been telling you
some of her cockeyed stories
she been seeing you
ive been seeing her if you want to know
so she wont yell her head off
about what she knows
she putting on an act for you crying
all over your shoulder the lying--
keep her out of this all im telling
you is were not going to sue
because you dont want the money anymore
even if you could have it because she
made you feel like a heel all of a sudden
it isnt the money anymore it our necks
were pulling out do you understand
because of what keyes can do
youre not fooling me walter
it because of lola
what you did to her father
youre afraid she might find out someday
and you cant take it can you
i said leave her out of this
it me im talking about
i dont want to be left out of it
stop saying that
it just that it hasnt worked as we wanted
we cant go through with it that all
we have gone through with it
the tough part is all behind us
we just have to hold on now
and not go soft inside
stick close together the way we started out
watch it
i loved you walter and i hated him
but i wasnt going to do anything
about it not until i met you
you planned the whole thing
i only wanted him dead
and im the one that fixed it so he was dead
is that what youre telling me
and nobody pulling out
we went into this together were
coming out at the end together
it straight down the line
for both of us remember
yes i remembered
just like i remembered
what you had told me keyes
about that trolley car ride
and how there was no getting off
till the end of the line
where the cemetery was
and then i got to thinking
what cemeteries are for
theyre to put dead people in
i guess that was the first time i
ever thought about phyllis that way
dead i mean
and how it would be if she were dead
i saw lola three or four times that week
one night we went up into the
hills behind the hollywood bowl
i guess it sounds crazy keyes
but it was only with her that
i could relax and let go a little
why are you crying
not gonna tell me huh
of course i will walter i
wouldnt tell anybody else but you
it about nino
zachetti what about him
they killed my father together
he and phyllis
he helped her do it i know he did
what makes you say that
ive been following him he been
to her house night after night
it was phyllis and him all along
maybe he was just going with me as a blind
and the night of the murder--
you promised me you werent
gonna talk like this anymore
he was supposed to pick me up
after a lecture at ucla
but he never showed up he said he was sick
sick
he couldnt show up because the train
was leaving with my father on it
maybe im just crazy
maybe it all in my mind
sure it all in your mind
i only wish it were walter
cause i still love him
zachetti phyllis and zachetti
what was he doing up at her house
i couldnt figure that one out
i tried to make sense out
of it and got nowhere
but the real braintwister came the next day
you sprang it on me keyes after
office hours when you caught me
down in the lobby of the building
walter walter just a minute
hello keyes
just hang on to your hat walter
what for
oh nothing much
that dietrichson case just busted wide open
how do you mean
the guy showed that how
what guy
the guy who helped her do it
the somebody else
no kidding
yeah she just filed suit against us
it okay by me
when we get them in that courtroom
ill tear them to pieces both of them
come on ill buy you a martini walter
no thanks keyes
with two olives
no ive got to get a shave and a shoeshine
ive got a date
margie i still bet she drinks
from the bottle
they give you matches
when you buy cigars you know
all you have to do is ask for them
dont like them they always explode
in my pocket so long walter
i was scared stiff keyes
maybe you were playing
catand-mouse with me
maybe you knew all along
i was the somebody else
i had to find out and i knew where to look
in your office
memo to mr norton
confidential dietrichson file
with regard to your proposal to put
walter neff under surveillance
i disagree absolutely
i have investigated his movements
on the night of the crime
and he definitely placed in his
apartment from 75 pm on
in addition to this i have known
neff intimately for  years
and i personally vouch for him
without reservation
furthermore no connection
whatsoever has been established
between walter neff and
mrs phyllis dietrichson
whereas i am now able to report that such
a connection has been established
between her and another man
this man has been observed
to visit mrs dietrichson
on the nights of july 9th
0th th 2th and 3th
we have succeeded in identifying
him as one nino zachetti
former medical student age of 28
residing at lilac court apartments
228 /2 north la brea avenue
we have checked zachetti movements
on the night of the crime
and have found that
they cannot be accounted for
i am preparing a more detailed
report for your consideration
it is my belief that we already have
sufficient evidence against zachetti
and mrs dietrichson
to justify police action
i strongly urge that this whole matter
be turned over to the office
of the district attorney
respectfully barton keyes
phyllis it walter
ive got to see you tonight
yes it has to be tonight
how 00
dont worry about keyes
just leave the front door
unlocked and put the lights out
no nobody watching the house not anymore
it just for the neighbors i
told you not to worry about keyes
ill see you at 00 yeah
goodbye baby
i guess i dont have to tell you
what i intended to do at 00 keyes
for the first time i saw a way to get
clear of the whole mess i was in
and of phyllis too all at the same time
yeah that what i thought
what i didnt know was that
she had plans of her own
in here walter
hello baby
anybody else in the house
nobody why
what that music
a radio up the street
just like the first time
i came here isnt it
we were talking about automobile insurance
only you were thinking about murder
i was thinking about that anklet
and what are you thinking about now
im all through thinking baby
i just came to say goodbye
goodbye
where are you going
youre the one that going baby not me
im getting off the trolley
car right at this corner
suppose you stop being fancy
let have it whatever it is
all right ill tell you a friend
of mine got a funny theory
he says when two people commit a murder
it sort of like theyre riding
on a trolley oar together one
cant get off without the other
theyre stuck with each other
and they have to go on
riding together clear to the end of the line
and the last stop is the cemetery
maybe he got something there
you bet he has
two people are gonna ride to the
end of the line all right
only im not gonna be one of them ive
got another guy to finish my ride for me
just who are you talking about
an acquaintance of yours
a mr zachetti
come on baby i just got into this thing
because i happen to know a little
something about insurance didnt i
i was a sucker
id have been brushed off just as soon
as you got your hands on the money
nobody wanted to brush you off
save it im telling this
it been you and that zachetti
guy all along hasnt it
that not true
doesnt make any difference
if it true or not
the point is keyes believes zachetti
is the one he been looking for
hell have him in that gas chamber
before he knows what happened to him
what happening to me all this time
dont be silly baby
what do you think is gonna happen to you
you helped him do the murder didnt you
that what keyes thinks
and what good enough for
keyes is good enough for me
maybe it not good enough for me walter
maybe i dont go for the idea
maybe id rather talk
sometimes people are where they cant talk
under six feet of dirt maybe
and if it was you theyd charge that
up to zachetti too wouldnt they
sure they would and that
just what gonna happen baby
cause he coming here
tonight in about 5 minutes
with the cops right behind him
it all taken care of
that would make everything
lovely for you wouldnt it
right and it got to be done before
that suit of yours comes to trial
and lola gets a chance to sound off
before they trip you up on the stand and
you start to go in drag me down with you
maybe i had zachetti here so they
wont get a chance to trip me up
so we can get the money and be together
that cute say it again
he came here first to ask where lola was
i made him come back i was working on him
he a crazy sort of guy quick-tempered
i kept hammering into him that
she was with another man
so hed go into one of his jealous rages
and then id tell him where she was
and you know what he wouldve
done to her dont you walter
yeah and for once i believe you
because it just rotten enough
were both rotten
only youre a little more rotten
you got me to take care
of your husband for you
and then you got zachetti to take care
of lola maybe take care of me too
then somebody else would have come along
to take care of zachetti for you
that the way you operate isnt it baby
suppose it is
is what youve got cooked up
for tonight any better
i dont like that music anymore
mind if i close the window
you can do better than that cant you baby
better try it again
maybe if i came a little closer
how this think you can do it now
why didnt you shoot again baby
dont tell me it because youve
been in love with me all this time
no i never loved you walter
not you or anybody else
im rotten to the heart
i used you just as you said
that all you ever meant to me
until a minute ago
when i couldnt fire that second shot
i never thought that could happen to me
sorry baby im not buying
im not asking you to buy
just hold me close
goodbye baby
zach em
come here
i said come here
my name is neff
yeah and i still dont like it
what do you want
look kid
i want to give you a present
this nice new nickel
what the gag
suppose you go on back down the hill
to the drugstore and make a phone call
keep your nickel and buy
yourself an ice-cream cone
the number is granite-0-3-8-6
ask for miss dietrichson first name is lola
she isnt worth a nickel
if i ever talk to her it not
going to be over any telephone
tough arent you
here take the nickel and call her
she wants you to
she doesnt want any part of me
i know who told you that it not true
lola in love with you she always has been
dont ask me why i couldnt even guess
here granite-0-3-8-6
now go on and call her
go on that way
it almost 430 now keyes
it cold
i wonder if she still lying
alone up there in that house
or if theyve found her by now
i wonder a lot of things
they dont matter anymore
except i want you to do
a favor for me keyes
i want you to be the one to tell lola kind
of gently before it breaks wide open
and i want you to take care of
her and that guy zachetti
so he doesnt get pushed around too much
hello keyes
up pretty early arent you
i always wondered what time
you got down to the office
or did that little man of
yours pull you out of bed
the janitor did
seems you leaked a little
blood on the way in here
yeah
wouldnt be surprised
i wanted to straighten you out
on that dietrichson case
so i gather
how long have you been standing there
long enough
kind of a crazy story
with a crazy twist to it
one you didnt quite figure out
you cant figure them all walter
that right i guess you cant at that
now i suppose i get the big speech
the one with all the two-dollar words in it
let have it keyes
walter youre all washed up
thanks keyes that was short anyway
im gonna call for a doctor
what for so they can patch me up
so they can nurse me along
till i get back on my feet
so i can walk into that gas chamber
up at san quentin on my own power
is that it keyes
something like that
ive got a different idea
yeah
look keyes
suppose you went back to bed and
didnt find these cylinders
till tomorrow morning
when the office opens
after that you can play it any way you like
would you do that much for me keyes
give me one good reason
i need four hours to get where im going
youre not going anywhere walter
you bet i am
im going across the border
you havent got a chance walter
good enough to try for
youll never make the border
that what you think
just watch me
youll never even make the elevator
so long keyes
hello
send an ambulance to the pacific
building on olive street
yeah it a police job
how you doing walter fine
only somebody moved the elevator
a couple of miles away
theyre on the way
you know why you couldnt
figure this one keyes
ill tell you
because the guy you were
looking for was too close
he was right across the desk from you
closer than that walter
i love you too
