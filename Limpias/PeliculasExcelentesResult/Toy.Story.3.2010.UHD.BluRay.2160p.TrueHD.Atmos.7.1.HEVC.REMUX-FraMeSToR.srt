and huggable on the outside
but inside he a monster
but how do you know that
chuckles hell tell you

he was a good toy a friend
me and him
we had the same kid daisy
was there
when lotso got unwrapped
daisy loved us all
but lotso
lotso was special
they did everything together
youve never seen
a kid and a toy more in love
one day we took a drive
hit a rest stop had a little playtime
after lunch daisy fell asleep
she never came back
lotso wouldnt give up
it took forever
but we finally made it back to daisy
but by then it was too late
something changed that day
inside lotso
something snapped
she replaced us come on
no she only replaced you
she replaced all of us
didnt she
she dont love you no more
now come on
we were lost cast off
unloved unwanted
then we found sunnyside
