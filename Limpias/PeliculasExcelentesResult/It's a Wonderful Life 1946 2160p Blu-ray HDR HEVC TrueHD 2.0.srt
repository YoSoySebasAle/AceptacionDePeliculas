satisfying a fundamental urge
it deep in the race
for a man to want his own roof
and walls and fireplace
and were helping him get those things
in our shabby little office
i know pop i know that

i know youre anxious to make a train
i have a taxi waiting downstairs
i want the board to know
that george gave up his trip to europe
to help straighten things out here
these past few months
good luck to you at school george
good luck george
goodbye george
and now we come to the real purpose
of this meeting
to appoint a successor
to our dear friend peter bailey
mr chairman
id like to get to my real purpose
wait just a minute now
wait for what
i claim this institution
is not necessary to this town
therefore mr chairman i make
a motion to dissolve this institution
and turn its assets and liabilities
over to the receiver
potter you dirty contemptible
ill wring his neck
george did you hear
what that buzzard
mr chairman
it too soon after
peter bailey death
to talk about chloroforming
the building and loan
peter bailey died three months ago
i second mr potter motion
very well in that case
ill ask the two executive officers
to withdraw but before you go
im sure the whole board wishes
to express its deep sorrow
at the passing of peter bailey
thank you very much
it was his faith and devotion
that are responsible
for this organization
ill go further than that
ill say that to the public
peter bailey
was the building and loan
that fine potter coming from you
considering that you probably
drove him to his grave
peter bailey was not a businessman
that what killed him
oh i dont mean any disrespect
to him god rest his soul
he was a man of high ideals
so-called
but ideals without common sense
can ruin this town
now you take this loan here
to ernie bishop
you know
that fellow that sits around all day
on his brains in his taxi you know
i happen to know
the bank turned down this loan
but he comes here
and were building him
a house worth $5000
why
well i handled that mr potter
you have all the papers there
his salary insurance
i can personally vouch
for his character
a friend of yours
yes sir
you see if you shoot pool
with some employee here
you can come and borrow money
what does that get us
a discontented lazy rabble
instead of a thrifty working class
and all because
a few starry-eyed dreamers
like peter bailey stir them up
and fill their heads
with a lot of impossible ideas
now i say
just a minute just a minute
now hold on mr potter
youre right when you say my father
was no businessman i know that
why he ever started this cheap
penny-ante building and loan
ill never know
but neither you nor anybody else
can say anything
against his character
because his whole life was
why in the 25 years since he
and uncle billy started this thing
he never once thought of himself
isnt that right uncle billy
he didnt save enough money
to send harry to school let alone me
but he did help a few people
get out of your slums mr potter
and what wrong with that
why here
youre all businessmen here
dont it make them better citizens
and doesnt it make them
better customers
you said that they
whatd you say just a minute ago
they had to wait and save their money
before they even thought
of a decent home
wait wait for what
until their children grow up
and leave them
until theyre so old
and broken-down that they
do you know how long it takes
a working man to save $50007
just remember this mr potter
that this rabble youre talking about
they do most of the working and paying
and living and dying
in this community
well is it too much to have them work
and pay and live and die
in a couple of decent rooms
and a bath
anyway my father didnt think so
people were human beings to him
but to you
a warped frustrated old man
theyre cattle
well in my book he died
a much richer man than youll ever be
im not interested in your book
im talking about
the building and loan
i know very well
what youre talking about
youre talking about something
you cant get your fingers on
and it galling you that what
youre talking about i know
well ive said too much i
youre the board here
you do what you want with this thing
there just one thing more though
this town needs
this measly one-horse institution
if only to have some place where people
can come without crawling to potter
come on uncle billy
sentimental hogwash i want my motion
boy oh boy that was telling him
george old boy
you shut his big mouth
you should have heard him
what happened
we heard a lot of yelling
well were being voted
out of business after 25 years
easy come easy go
here it is help wanted female
you still want me
to hang around george
yeah ill be right down
yeah hey youll miss your train
youre a week late for school already
go on
what going on in there
never mind dont worry about that
theyre putting us out of business
so what i can get another job
im only 55
go on go on
hey look you gave up your boat trip
now you dont want to miss college
too do you
george george
they voted potter down
they want to keep it going
you did it george you did it
they got one condition
only one condition
what that

fifteen years ago a half a dozen
houses stuck here and there

i used to hunt rabbits there myself
look at it today
dozens of the prettiest little homes
you ever saw
90% owned by suckers
who used to pay rent to you
your potter field my dear
mr employer is becoming just that
and are the local yokels making with
those david and goliath wisecracks
oh they are are they
even though they know the baileys
never made a dime out of it
you know very well why
the baileys were all chumps
every one of these homes is worth
twice what it cost
the building and loan to build
if i were you mr potter
you are not me
as i say it no skin off my nose
but one of these days
this bright young man
is gonna be asking
george bailey for a job
the bailey family has been
a boil on my neck long enough
yes sir
come in here
we just stopped in town
to take a look at the new factory
and then were gonna
drive on down to florida
why dont you
have your friends join us
why sure hey why dont you kids
drive down with us huh
oh im afraid
i couldnt get away sam
still got the nose
to the old grindstone eh
jane i offered to let george in
on the ground floor in plastics
and he turned me down cold
oh now dont rub it in
im not rubbing it in
well i guess we better run along
awfully happy to have met you mary
nice meeting you too
goodbye glad to see you
goodbye george
so long george
see you in the funny papers
so long mary
bye sam have fun
thanks for dropping around
florida
hee-haw
hee-haw
thank you sir
that quite a cigar mr potter
you like it
ill send you a box
well i
i suppose
ill find out sooner or later
but just what exactly
did you want to see me about
george now that just what i like
so much about you
george i am an old man
and most people hate me
but i dont like them either
so that makes it all even
you know just as well as i do
that i run practically everything
in this town
but the bailey building and loan
you know also
that for a number of years
ive been trying to get control of it
or kill it
but i havent been able to do it
you have been stopping me
in fact you have beaten me george
and as anyone in this county
can tell you that takes some doing
take during the depression
for instance
you and i were the only ones
that kept our heads
you saved the building and loan
i saved all the rest
yes well most people say
you stole all the rest
the envious ones say that
george the suckers
now i have stated
my side very frankly
now let look at your side
young man 27-28 married
making say $40 a week
$45
$45
$45
out of which after supporting
your mother and paying your bills
youre able to keep say $0
if you skimp
a child or two comes along and you
wont even be able to save the $0
now if this young man of 28
was a common ordinary yokel
id say he was doing fine
but george bailey is not a common
ordinary yokel
he is an intelligent smart
ambitious young man
who hates his job
who hates the building and loan
almost as much as i do
a young man who been dying to get
out on his own ever since he was born
a young man the smartest one
of the crowd mind you
a young man who has to sit by
and watch his friends go places
because he trapped
yes sir
trapped into frittering his life away
playing nursemaid
to a lot of garlic eaters
do i paint a correct picture
or do i exaggerate
now what your point mr potter
my point
my point is i want to hire you
hire me
yeah i want you to manage my affairs
run my properties
george ill start you out
at $20000 a year
$20000 a year
you wouldnt mind living
in the nicest house in town
buying your wife
a lot of fine clothes
a couple of business trips
to new york a year
maybe once in a while europe
you wouldnt mind that
would you george
would
youre not talking to somebody else
around here are you
you know this is me
you remember me
george bailey
george bailey
yeah george bailey
whose ship has just come in
provided he has enough brains
to climb aboard
holy mackerel
well how about the building and loan
oh confound it man
are you afraid of success
im offering you
a three-years contract
at $20000 a year starting today
is it a deal or isnt it
well mr potter i
i know i ought to jump
at the chance but i i just
i wonder if it would be possible
for you to give me 24 hours
to think it over
sure sure sure
you go on home
and talk about it to your wife
id like to do that
yeah in the meantime
ill draw up the papers
all right sir
okay george
okay mr potter
no no no no
now wait a minute here
i dont need 24 hours
i dont have to talk to anybody
i know right now
and the answer is no
no doggone it
you sit around here
and you spin your little webs
and you think the whole world
revolves around you and your money
well it doesnt mr potter
in the whole vast
configuration of things
id say you were nothing
but a scurvy little spider
you
