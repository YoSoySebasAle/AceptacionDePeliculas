from the day we arrive
on the planet
and blinking step into the sun
there more to see
than can ever be seen
more to do
than can ever be done
there far too much
to take in here
more to find
than can ever be found
squawking
but the sun rolling high
through the sapphire sky
keeps great and small
on the endless round
it the circle of life
and it moves us all
through despair and hope
through faith and love
till we find our place
on the path unwinding
in the circle
the circle of life
purring
it the circle of life
and it moves us all
through despair and hope
through faith and love
till we find our place
on the path unwinding
in the circle
the circle of life
life not fair is it
you see l well i shall never be king
and you shall never see
the light of another day
adieu
didnt your mother ever tell you
not to play with your food
what do you want
im here to announce that
king mufasa on his way
so youd better have a good excuse
for missing this morning ceremony
oh look zazu
youve made me lose my lunch
youll lose more than that
when the king gets through with you
he as mad as a hippo with a hernia
i quiver with fear
now scar dont look at me that way
help
scar
mm-hmm
drop him
impeccable timing your majesty
why if it isnt my big brother
descending from on high
to mingle with the commoners
sarabi and i didnt see you
at the presentation of simba
that was today
i feel simply awful
screeching
mustve slipped my mind
yes well as slippery as your mind is
as the king brother
you shouldve been first in line
well i was first in line
until the little hairball was born
that hairball is my son
and your future king
i shall practice my curtsy
dont turn your back on me scar
oh no mufasa
perhaps you shouldnt
turn your back on me
roars
is that a challenge
temper temper
i wouldnt dream of challenging you
pity why not
well as far as brains go
i got the lion share
but when it comes to brute strength
im afraid im at the shallow end
of the gene pool
there one in every family sire
two in mine actually
and they always manage to
ruin special occasions
what am i going to do with him
hed make a very handsome throw rug
zazu
and just think whenever he gets dirty
you could take him out and beat him
chuckles
muttering
hmm
simba
chuckles
dad dad
come on dad we gotta go wake up
uhh
sorry
-snoring
dad dad
your son is awake
before sunrise he your son
dad come on dad
you promised
okay okay im up im up
yeah
mufasa look simba
everything the light
touches is our kingdom
wow
a king time as ruler
rises and falls like the sun
one day simba
the sun will set on my time here
and will rise with you as the new king
and thisll all be mine
everything
everything the light touches
what about that shadowy place
that beyond our borders
you must never go there simba
but i thought a king
can do whatever he wants
oh there more to being king
than getting your way all the time
there more
-laughs simba
everything you see exists together
in a delicate balance
as king you need to
understand that balance
and respect all the creatures
from the crawling ant
to the leaping antelope
but dad dont we eat the antelope
yes simba but let me explain
when we die our bodies
become the grass
and the antelope eat the grass
and so we are all connected
in the great circle of life
good morning sire
good morning zazu
checking in with the morning report
fire away
well the buzz from the bees
is that the leopards
are in a bit of a spot
really
what are you doing son
pouncing
let an old pro show you how it done
i told the elephants to forget it
but they cant
zazu would you turn around
yes sire
the cheetahs are hard up but
stay low to the ground
cheetahs never prosper
whispering yeah okay
stay low to the ground right yeah
what going on
a pouncing lesson
very good pouncing
pouncing
no sire you cant be serious
this is so humiliating
try not to make a sound
what are you telling him mufasa
mufasa simba
mufasa laughs
that very good
zazu
yes
news from the underground
now this time
sire hyenas in the pride lands
zazu take simba home
aw dad cant i come
no son
pah i never get to go anywhere
oh young master
one day you will be king
then you can chase those
slobbering mangy stupid poachers
from dawn until dusk
hey uncle scar guess what
i despise guessing games
im gonna be king of pride rock
oh goody
my dad just showed me
the whole kingdom
and im gonna rule it all
yes well forgive me
for not leaping for joy
bad back you know
hey uncle scar
when im king whatll that make you
a monkey uncle
youre so weird
you have no idea
so your father showed you
the whole kingdom did he
everything
he didnt show you what beyond
that rise at the northern border
well no he said i cant go there
and he absolutely right
it far too dangerous
only the bravest lions go there
well im brave what out there
im sorry simba i just cant tell you
why not
im only looking out for the
well-being of my favorite nephew
yeah right im your only nephew
all the more reason
for me to be protective
an elephant graveyard is no place
for a young prince oops
an elephant what whoa
oh dear ive said too much
well i suppose youd have
found out sooner or later
you being so clever and all
just do me one favor
promise me youll never visit
that dreadful place
no problem
there a good lad
you run along now and have fun
and remember
it our little secret
hey nala
hi simba
come on i just heard
about this great place
simba im kind of
in the middle of a bath
sarabi and it time for yours
mom
mom youre messing up my mane
okay okay im clean
can we go now
so where are we going
it better not be anyplace dumb
no it really cool
so where is this really cool place
oh
uh around the water hole
the water hole
what so great about the water hole
ill show you when we get there
oh
uh mom can i go with simba
hmm what do you think sarabi
well
both please
it all right with me
yeah
all right
as long as zazu goes with you
no not zazu
zazu step lively
the sooner we get to the water hole
the sooner we can leave
so where are we really going
an elephant graveyard
wow
shh zazu
right so how are we
gonna ditch the dodo
oh just look at you two
little seeds of romance
blossoming in the savanna
your parents will be thrilled
what with your being betrothed and all
be-what
betrothed intended
affianced
meaning
one day you two are
going to be married
yuck
eww
i cant marry her she my friend
yeah itd be so weird
sorry to bust your bubble
but you two turtle doves
have no choice
it a tradition going back generations
when im king
thatll be the first thing to go
not so long as im around
well in that case youre fired
nice try but only the king can do that
well he the future king
yeah so you have to do what i tell you
not yet i dont
and with an attitude like that
im afraid youre shaping up to be
a pretty pathetic king indeed
not the way i see it
singing im gonna be a mighty king
so enemies beware
well ive never seen
a king of beasts
with quite so little hair
im gonna be the main event
like no king was before
im brushin up on lookin down
im workin on my roar
thus far a rather uninspiring thing
oh i just cant wait to be king
youve rather along way to go
young master if you think
no one sayin do this
now when i said that
no one saying be there
what i meant was
no one sayin stop that
you dont realize
no one sayin see here
now see here
free to run around all day
well that definitely out
free to do it all my way
i think it time that you and i
arranged a heart-to-heart
kings dont need advice
from little hornbills for a start
if this is where
the monarchy is headed
count me out
out of service out of africa
i wouldnt hang about
this child is getting
wildly out of wing
oh i just cant wait to be king
everybody look left
everybody look right
everywhere you look im
standing in the spotlight
not yet
let every creature
go for broke and sing
let hear it in the herd
and on the wing
it gonna be
king simba finest fling
oh i just cant wait to be king
oh i just cant wait to be king

be prepared for the murkiest scam
meticulous planning
tenacity spanning
decades of denial

african choir sings
there a calm surrender
to the rush of day
when the heat of a rolling wind
can be turned away
an enchanted moment
and it sees me through
it enough for this restless warrior
just to be with you
and can you feel
the love tonight
it is where we are
it enough
for this wide-eyed wanderer
that we got this far
and can you feel
the love tonight
how it laid to rest
it enough
to make kings and vagabonds
believe the very best
there a time for everyone
if they only learn
that the twisting kaleidoscope
moves us all in turn
there a rhyme and reason
to the wild outdoors
when the heart
of this star-crossed voyager
beats in time with yours
and can you feel
the love tonight
it is where we are
it enough
for this wide-eyed wanderer
that we got this far
and can you feel
the love tonight
how it laid to rest
it enough
to make kings and vagabonds
believe the very best
it enough
to make kings and vagabonds
believe the very best
