how lucky you lawyers are
i almost married a lawyer
i was in attendance for his appendectomy
and we became engaged
as soon as he could sit up
and then peritonitis set in
and he went like that

37 years has it been all that long
yes sir this is 952 that was in october
95 the shepherd bush murder
the chemist accused of putting
cyanide in his uncle toothpaste

i hope it still fits
i lost 30lbs in that wretched hospital
still i suppose my head isnt any smaller

any criminal cases your doctors have
doctors theyve deprived me of alcohol

more mothballs put me away too
230 sir wilfrid time for our little nap
oh get out
beddy-bye wed better go upstairs now
get undressed and lie down
we what a nauseating prospect
upstairs please
are you aware that while on my sickbed
i seriously considered strangling you
with one of your own rubber tubes
i would then have admitted the crime
retained myself for the defence
my lord members of the jury i hereby
enter a plea of justifiable homicide
for four months this alleged
angel of mercy has pored probed
punctured pillaged and plundered
my helpless body
while tormenting my mind
with a steady drip of baby talk
come along now like a good boy oh no
take your hands off me
or ill strike you with my cane
you wouldnt it might break your cigars
what cigars

is turned ill snatch her thermometer
and plunge it between
her shoulder blades so help me i will
oh no sir you mustnt walk up weve
installed something for you here it a lift
a lift im sick of this plot
to make me a helpless invalid
i think it a splendid idea
let try it shall we
out of there ill try it
it my lift because it was my heart attack
here you are simply press this button
for up and this one for down
carter i warn you
if this contraption should collapse
if the barrister
should fall off the bannister
remarkable
smoothest flight ive had in years
upsy-daisy
once more to get the feel of the controls
good afternoon
is it possible to see sir wilfrid
i didnt make an appointment
but this is urgent
if it about a brief im sorry but were
full sir wilfrid has all that he can handle
im sure hell want this brief
serious criminal matter
absolutely not mr mayhew
sir wilfrid is still convalescent
he cant accept anything
of an overstimulating nature
put me on a diet of bland civil suits
hello mayhew
hello distressing news about your health
it tragic youd better get
a man with younger arteries
if you could just give us a few minutes
this is mr leonard vole
he in rather a ghastly mess im afraid
how do you do mr vole
well according to mr mayhew
im not doing at all well
sir wilfrid sir wilfrid
youre dawdling again
oh shut up
sorry mayhew try me again when
youve something not too stimulating
like a postman bitten by a stray dog
i wish you could help us wilfrid but
i quite understand take care of yourself
mayhew mayhew
oh no sir wilfrid please
dont worry we wont take the brief
but an old friend needs help
surely i can give him a word of advice
come on ill give you five minutes
no no i dont want you just mayhew
our nap sir wilfrid our nap
you go ahead start it without me
this is your fault
you should not have permitted it
it is not my fault i distinctly told
sir wilfrid no criminal cases
well if it anyone fault
i expect it mine
seems silly to me
but mr mayhew thinks it very urgent
he thinks i may be arrested any minute
arrested for what
well for murder
oh
it the case of emily french
youve probably seen reports in the press
middle-aged widow well-off
living with a housekeeper at hampstead
mr vole had been with her earlier
when the housekeeper returned
she found her dead
struck on the back of the head
and killed
vole seems caught
in a web of circumstantial evidence
perhaps if i gave you the details youd
suggest the strongest line of defence
id probably think better with a cigar
of course
no previous convictions he of good
character with an excellent war record
youd like him a lot
theyve confiscated the matches a light
the defence may turn on establishing
an alibi for the night of the murder
i havent got any let me get you some
lord no you dont know miss plimsoll
this will take all our cunning
young man
come here please
your solicitor and i feel you may be able
to enlighten me on an important point
yes thank you
sir wilfrid
youre not in bed yet upstairs
give me a match
sorry i never carry them
what you said id like him
but i do have a lighter
youre quite right mayhew
i do like him thank you
can you imagine miss plimsoll face
if she saw me now
then let make absolutely sure
that she doesnt
splendid all the instincts
of a skilled criminal
thank you sir
here
whether or not you murdered
a middle-aged widow
you certainly saved the life
of an elderly barrister
i havent murdered anybody it absurd
christine that my wife she thought
i may be implicated and needed a lawyer
that why i went to see mr mayhew
now he thinks he needs a lawyer
and now i have two lawyers
it rather silly
i am a solicitor sir wilfrid is a barrister
only a barrister can actually
plead a case in court
oh i see
she shall not even find the ashes
sit down
thank you
i saw in the paper that mrs french had
been found dead with her head bashed in
it also said the police were anxious to
interview me since i visited that evening
naturally i went to the police station
did they caution you
i dont quite know
they asked if id like to make a statement
and said theyd write it down and it might
be used against me is that a caution
well it cant be helped now
they seemed quite satisfied
they seemed satisfied mr vole
he thinks that he made a statement
and that the end of it isnt it obvious
that you will be regarded as the principal
suspect im afraid youll be arrested
ive done nothing
why should i be arrested
this is england you dont get arrested
or convicted for crimes you havent done
we try not to make a habit of it
but it does happen though doesnt it
of course there was that case of
that fellow whatshisname adolph beck
in jail for years and they
suddenly found it was another chap
hed been innocent
unfortunate but restitution was made
he received a pardon a bounty from the
crown and was restored to normal life
that all right for him what if
it had been murder what if hed hanged
how would they have restored him
to his normal life then
mr vole you must not take
such a morbid point of view
it just when you say these things
are closing in on me it like a nightmare
relax youre in the hands of the finest
most experienced barrister in london
let get this straight i may have done
something highly unethical
ive taken your cigar
but im not taking your case i cant
im forbidden my doctors would never
allow it im truly sorry young man
but if youd like the case
handled by these chambers
id recommend mr brogan-moore
yes a very able man
i second sir wilfrid recommendation
all right sir if you say so
hold this
carter
i would like to see brogan-moore here
as soon as he comes in from court
sir wilfrid i have never
known such insubordination
not even as a nurse during the war
what war was that
the crimean war no doubt
youll like brogan-moore
he had excellent training under me
this morning i had no lawyers at all
and now suddenly i have three
we should explain
that i have very little money
i shant be able to pay
all the costs and fees
well get a fourth lawyer to sue you
he wont get very much
i havent had a job in four months
what sort of work do you do
well uh
my last job was as a mechanic
the foreman kept riding me all the time
i took it as long as i could then i quit
and before that
i worked in a department store in toys
demonstrating children building sets
of course it lasted only during christmas
before that i tested electric blankets
electric blankets
i suppose you think im a bit of a drifter
it true in a way
but im really not like that
my army service unsettled me that and
living abroad i was stationed in germany
it was fine there though
that where i met my wife
she was an actress and a good one
she a wonderful wife to me too
but i havent been much of a provider
im afraid
somehow i just dont seem able to settle
down now ive come back to this country
if i could just put my eggbeater across
eggbeater
yes sir i uh im a bit of an inventor
nothing big just little household things
pocket pencil sharpeners
key chain flashlights
but my best is really this eggbeater
it not only beats
it also separates the yolk from the white
is that really desirable
if you were a housewife
youd see it right away
the trouble is i need money
for manufacturing and promotion
i was really hoping that what mrs
french might do for me after i met her
exactly how did you meet mrs french
that rather funny in itself
it was 3 september i remember
because it my wife birthday
i was window-shopping in oxford street
daydreaming about what id buy for her
if i had any money
you really like this one
very much
you dont think it too mad
mad
not at all daring perhaps i wouldnt
recommend it to every woman but you
why shouldnt you attract attention
you think so
absolutely but if i could
suggest one little thing
perhaps we could tip it and bring it back
a bit like that show more of your face
my bus goodbye
good
you buy that hat i insist
actually it was a ridiculous sort of hat -
a silly thing with ribbons and flowers
im constantly surprised that women
hats do not provoke more murders
go on please
i was only trying to be nice
to make her feel good
i never dreamed id see her again
or the hat
but you did
yes a few weeks later
again by accident i was peddling my
eggbeaters and business was a little slow
would you mind madam your hat
oh it you
hello
it your fault you know
you chose it yourself
may i
sure if you like
thank you it such a bother
taking it off and putting it back on again
that chap is jesse james theyve led
him into an ambush it not at all cricket
dont worry he shoots his way out
he does
ive seen it i got to the movies a lot
you do
i get restless so i go out then i find
ive no place to go so i go to the movies
sometimes i see the same one
two or three times ooh
toffee
oh yes please
at this time you had no idea
that mrs french was well-off
no absolutely not
we were sitting in the cheap seats
all i knew was she seemed to be
very lonely had no friends whatsoever
she and her husband
lived abroad in british nigeria
he was in the colonial service
he died in 45 of a heart attack
please mayhew not when im smoking
go on young man
well they finally
polished off jesse james
and after we left the movie
she invited me to her house for tea
i think it the most fascinating thing
ive ever seen janet come and look
ive seen eggbeaters before maam
but this beats so quickly
and it separates too
it must be cen-trifugal
or centrifugal which is it
it specific gravity
but it whips cream too
did you hear that janet
it whips cream too
we must have one is it expensive
compliments of the inventor
manufacturer and sole distributor
thank you well use it constantly
wont we janet
come wed better get out of here
janet doesnt like visitors in her kitchen
ha
it a bit chilly in here isnt it
shall we have a fire
why not
this is a charming room
hubert and i collected all these things
when we lived in africa
hubert was my husband
well now there a loveable chap
that the mask of the witch doctor
he wore it when he pulled
our servants teeth
so hubert used to call him a witch dentist
hubert was so witty
yes i can see that
oh here tea
let use our good silver and china
oh no dont bother mrs french
this is perfectly all right
lemon or milk please
i dont really care
would you prefer sherry
thatd be fine
weve no got any
oh but we have there that bottle
the one we bought last christmas
if you care for an eggnog there a wasted
egg in the kitchen ready and separated
do sit down dont mind janet mr vole
it just that she terribly scotch
oh is she i thought
she came with the collection
you know maybe
ill take a glass of sherry myself
i feel like christmas somehow
after that i saw her once or twice a week
she always kept a bottle of sherry for me
wed talk play canasta
listen to gramophone records
gilbert and sullivan mostly
it so weird to think of her now
lying in that living room murdered
i assure you she been moved by now
to leave her would be unfeeling unlawful
and unsanitary
tell sir wilfrid about
the evening of the murder
i went around to see her
about eight oclock
she fixed a sandwich
we talked listened to the mikado
i left about nine i walked home
i got there about half past
i can prove that i can swear to it in or out
of court in the witness box anywhere
how much money did you get
from mrs french
nothing
the truth how much
why should she give me any money
because she was in love with you
that ridiculous she liked me
she pampered me like an aunt
but that all i swear
why didnt you tell her you had a wife
i did
but you never took your wife along
when you went there why not
because
because what
because she was under the impression
we didnt get along too well
is that true
no we love each other
then how did she get that impression
she just seemed to want to believe it
you never corrected her why
i was afraid shed lose interest
because she was rich
and you were after her money
well yes in a way
i was hoping for a loan for my new
invention just a few hundred pounds
an honest business proposition that all
is that so wicked
you knew it was
the housekeeper day off
well yes
you went there because shed be alone
no because i thought
she might be lonely
all right lonely you and the rich
lonely widow all alone in that house
with a gramophone blaring the mikado
perhaps you turned up
the volume to drown her cries
when i left her she was alive
when janet came back she was dead
the house had been ransacked it said
in the papers it mustve been a burglar
i didnt do it no matter
how bad things look i didnt do it
you must believe me
you do believe me dont you
i do now but i wasnt sure
that why i subjected your eyes
and my arteries to that ordeal
im sorry
that all right
as for things looking bad they
dont look bad mr vole they look terrible
apparently youve no alibi at all
but i have i left mrs french at nine
by bus or underground
no i walked it was a fine night
did anyone see you
christine saw me when i got home
it was 926 i know because i went right to
work on a clock ive been tinkering with
my wife will tell you
your wife loves you yes
very much
were devoted to each other
you realise mr vole the testimony of a
devoted wife does not carry much weight
people might think
christine would lie on my account
it has been known mr vole
blood is thicker than evidence
ah brogan-moore come in come in
so good to have you out of hospital
i didnt get a full pardon im out on
parole you know mr mayhew i believe
this is his client mr leonard vole
how do you do
how do you do
the emily french murder
oh how do you do
badly thank you
a mass of circumstantial evidence
no alibi whatsoever it a hot potato
tossing it into your lap
much obliged
your line of defence
however will be lack of motive
you will agree that we can rule out
a crime of passion hm
that leaves us with a murder for profit
if mr vole had been sponging off mrs
french why cut off the source of supply
or if hed been hoping for a golden egg
why kill the goose before it was laid
no motive no motive whatsoever
you find some flaw in this reasoning
no no it very sound as far as it goes
well it all yours youll find mr vole
very responsive and quite candid
so candid he already told me
well have to sue him for our fees
oh well simply put a lean
on mr vole $80000
what $80000
the $80000 mrs french left you
left me
they opened mrs french
bank vault today and found her will
congratulations
$80000
and i was worried about a couple
of hundred for that silly eggbeater
i must call christine
oh
this doesnt make things
look any better for me does it
no i wouldnt think so
so now theyll say i did have a motive
they will indeed $80000 makes for
a very handsome motive
i thought you were crazy
but now they will arrest me
it not unlikely
as a matter of fact it quite likely
theyre on their way up now
i knew nothing about that will id no idea
shed any intention of leaving me money
if i didnt know how can it be a motive
well certainly bring that out in court
it our old friend inspector hearne
chief inspector as of last month
chief inspector they must think
a lot of you at scotland yard
youre getting the de luxe treatment
oh in here chief inspector
sorry to disturb you in your chambers
that perfectly all right
i never object to the actions of the police
except once in a great while in court
yes sir i still have the scars
you know mr mayhew mr brogan-moore
this is leonard vole youd better search
him he may be armed with an eggbeater
is your name leonard vole
yes it is
i have a warrant for your arrest
on the charge of murdering emily french
i must warn you that anything you say
may be taken down and used in evidence
well im ready must i be handcuffed
that wont be necessary sir
ive never been arrested before
not even for walking a dog off a lead
or having a beer after hours
there no disgrace in being arrested
kings prime ministers archbishops
even barristers have stood in the dock
somebody better call my wife
i will dont worry
ill go too see youre properly charged
you will see to it that he is well-treated
we will
would you like a cigar pardon me
that very kind of you sir wilfrid
id better not it would constitute a bribe
we ought to be going mr vole
one thing ive learned for sure never
look in a window with women hats
good day sir
makes a very nice impression
doesnt he
yes rather give him the monocle test
passed with flying colours
i hope he does as well in the dock
this is sticky you know
of course the prosecution will
blast in with their heaviest artillery
all youll have is one little popgun
an alibi furnished by his wife
isnt that an intriguing challenge
i think id like it more if it was less
of a challenge and less intriguing
miss plimsoll has issued an ultimatum
in bed in one minute or shell resign
splendid give her a month pay
and kick her down the stairs
either you take care of yourself
or i too shall resign
this is blackmail
but youre quite right
for my first day this has already
been rather hectic i should be in bed
id better get in touch with mrs vole
and have her come over will you sit in
thank you no im in no condition to cope
with emotional wives drenched in tears
miss plimsoll how alluring you look
waiting like a hangman on the scaffold
take me im yours
oh
about mrs vole handle her gently
especially when you tell her of the arrest
bear in mind she a foreigner so prepare
for hysterics even a fainting spell
better have smelling salts ready
box of tissues and a nip of brandy
i do not think
that will be necessary
i never faint in case i dont fall gracefully
and i never use smelling salts
because they puff up the eyes
im christine vole
how do you do
this is mr brogan-moore
how do you do
i am wilfrid robarts
how do you do
my dear mrs vole im afraid
we have bad news for you
dont be afraid im quite disciplined
there nothing to be alarmed about yet
leonard has been arrested
and charged with murder is that it
yes
i knew he would be i told him so
im glad youre showing such fortitude
call it what you like
what is the next step
your husband will have
to stand trial im afraid
will you explain the procedure
mr brogan-moore will lead the defence
oh
you will not defend leonard
regrettably not
my health or rather
the lack of it forbids me
it is regrettable mr mayhew described
you as champion of the hopeless cause
is it perhaps
that this cause is too hopeless
ill have a serious talk with dr harrison it
was a mistake to let you come back here
i should have taken you
to a rest-home or a resort
some place quiet far off like bermuda
shut up you just want
to see me in those nasty shorts
come now sir wilfrid
you must not think of it
you must get ready for sleep
think beautiful thoughts
now let get undressed put these on
tops and bottoms while i make your bed
after your rest
well have a nice cup of cocoa
then perhaps
well have a walk around the square
you know i feel sorry
for that nice mr vole
and not just because he was arrested
but that wife of his she must be german
that what happens when we let our
boys cross the channel they go crazy
the government should do something
about foreign wives like an embargo
how else can we take care of our own
surplus dont you agree sir wilfrid
all right hop in
sir wilfrid
sir wilfrid
come back
yes of course i knew that leonard had
been seeing mrs french quite frequently
go on
i knew when he came home with a pair
of green socks shed knitted for him
that quite natural
im sure a jury will find it endearing
leonard can be very endearing
he hates that particular shade of green
and the socks were two sizes too large
but he wore them just the same
to give her pleasure
leonard has a way with women
i only hope he has an all-woman jury
they will carry him from court in triumph
a simple acquittal will do now you know
mrs french left your husband money
yes a lot of money
of course your husband had
no previous knowledge of this bequest
is that what he told you
surely youre not suggesting different
oh no no i do not suggest anything
clearly she had come to look upon your
husband as a son or favourite nephew
you think mrs french looked
upon leonard as a son or a nephew
i do an entirely natural
and understandable relationship
what hypocrites you are in this country
pardon me brogan-moore
do you mind if i ask you a question
go right ahead sir wilfrid
you realise your husband entire
defence rests on his word and yours
i realise that
and that the jury will be quite sceptical
of the word of a man accused of murder
when supported only by that of his wife
i realise that too
let us then at least make sure
the two are not in conflict
by all means let
i assume you want to help your husband
of course i want to help leonard i want
to help mr brogan-moore and to help you
there isnt that
more comfortable for you
now mrs vole this is very important
on the night of the murder your husband
came home before 930 correct
precisely isnt that
what he wants me to say
isnt it the truth
of course
but when i told the police
i do not think they believed me
maybe i didnt say it well
maybe because of my accent
my dear mrs vole in our courts
we accept the evidence
of witnesses who speak only bulgarian
and who must have an interpreter
we accept the evidence
of deaf-mutes who cannot speak at all
as long as they tell the truth
youre aware that when youre
in the witness box you will be sworn
and you will testify under oath
yes
leonard came home at 926 precisely
and did not go out again
the truth the whole truth
and nothing but the truth is that better
mrs vole do you love your husband
leonard thinks i do
well do you
am i already under oath
whatever your gambit may be
do you know that under british law
you cannot be called to give testimony
damaging to your husband
how very convenient
we are dealing with a capital crime
the prosecution
will try to hang your husband
he is not my husband
leonard and i went through
a form of marriage
but i had a husband living somewhere
in east germany in the russian zone
did you tell leonard
i did not it would have been stupid
he would not have married me and
id have been left to starve in the rubble
but he did marry you
and brought you safely here
dont you think you should be grateful
one can get very tired of gratitude
your husband loves you
very much does he not
leonard
he worships the ground i walk on
and you
you want to know too much
auf wiedersehen gentlemen
thank you for coming in mrs vole
your visit has been most reassuring
do not worry sir wilfrid i will give him
an alibi and i shall be very convincing
there will be tears in my eyes when i say
leonard came home at 926 precisely
youre a very remarkable woman
mrs vole
and youre satisfied i hope
im damned if im satisfied
care for a whiff of those smelling salts
that woman up to something but what
the prosecution will break her down
in no time when she in the witness box
this case is going to be rather
like the charge of the light brigade
or one of those japanese suicide pilots
quite one-sided
with the odds all on the other side
i havent got much to go on have i
the fact is ive got nothing
let me ask you something
do you believe leonard vole is innocent
do you
do you
im not sure
oh im sorry wilfrid
of course ill do my best
it all right brogan-moore
ill take it from here
i have called dr harrison and given him
a report on your shocking behaviour
give me a match miss plimsoll
sir wilfrid
did you hear me a match
mr mayhew sir wilfrid im told you are
going to represent me im very grateful
i struck a bargain with my doctors they
exile me to bermuda as soon as we finish
thank you
there hope that well both survive
get into these we need a photograph
why
this is what you were wearing that night
well circulate a photo on the chance
that someone saw you on your way home
over here against the wall please
hold it
one more in profile please
do we really need this my wife knows
what time i came home that night
a disinterested witness
may be of more value
yes of course
christine is an interested witness
ill pick up the negatives later thank you
i dont understand it
why hasnt she come to see me
wont they let her see me
i mean it been two weeks now
mayhew give me the reports
have you been talking to her

i want to read a portion of the evidence
of janet mckenzie the housekeeper
mr vole helped mrs french
with her business affairs
particularly her income tax returns
oh yes i did some of those forms
are very complicated
there also a hint you may
have helped her draft her new will
well that not true
if janet said that she lying
she was always against me
i dont know why
it obvious you threw an eggbeater into
the wheels of her victorian household
now this cut in your wrist
you say you cut yourself with a knife
well that true i did
i was cutting bread and the knife slipped
but that was two days after christine
was there shell tell them in her evidence
are you keeping something from me
is she ill was she shocked
all things considered she took it well
though that may be only on the surface
wives are often profoundly
disturbed at such a time
yes it must be hard
weve never been separated before
not since our first meeting
how did you meet your wife mr vole
in germany in 945

mr vole i must tell you

and a thermos of lukewarm cocoa
officer

ill-tempered old man who hates to lose
let us wish each other luck

touching isnt it
the way he counts on his wife
yes like a drowning man
clutching at a razor blade
leonard stephen vole you are
charged on indictment for that you
on the 4th day of october
in the county of london
murdered emily jane french
how say you leonard stephen vole
are you guilty or not guilty
not guilty
members of the jury
the prisoner stands indicted for that he
on the 4th day of october
murdered emily jane french
to this indictment
he has pleaded not guilty
and it is your charge to say
having heard the evidence
whether he be guilty or not
members of the jury
by the oath which you have just taken
you have sworn
to try this case on the evidence
you must shut out
from your minds everything
except what will take place in this court
you may proceed
for the prosecution mr myers
may it please you my lord
members of the jury
i appear in this case with my learned
friend mr barton for the prosecution
and my learned friends
sir wilfrid robarts and mr brogan-moore
appear for the defence
i trust we are not to be deprived
of the learned and stimulating
presence of sir wilfrid
my lord may i assure my learned friend
that sir wilfrid is in the old bailey
he slightly incapacitated
but will be in his seat presently
my lord may i express my regret that
sir wilfrid is even slightly incapacitated
you may mr myers you may also
proceed with the case for the prosecution
thank you my lord
the facts in this case are simple
and to a point not in dispute
you will hear how the prisoner made
the acquaintance of mrs emily french
a woman of 56
how he was treated by her
with kindness and even affection
on the night of october 4 last
between 930 and 0
mrs french was murdered
medical testimony
will be introduced to prove
that death was caused by a blow
from a blunt and heavy instrument
and it is the case for the prosecution
that the blow was dealt
by the prisoner leonard vole
that not true i didnt do it
among the witnesses
you will hear police evidence
also the evidence of mrs french
housekeeper janet mckenzie
and from the medical
and laboratory experts
and the evidence of the murdered
woman solicitor who drew her final will
i now call chief inspector hearne
criminal investigation department
new scotland yard
chief inspector hearne
chief inspector hearne
chief inspector hearne
this is ridiculous just nervous heartburn
i always get it the first day of a trial
240 above 30
you shouldnt be here at all
i should be in court the trial begun
syringe please
be a good brave boy sir wilfrid
it may interest you to know
that i am descended from a warrior family
which traces its brave past
back to richard the lion-hearted
youre to have a calcium injection daily
tranquillising pill every hour
ill set my wristwatch alarm
any pain or shortness of breath
pop one of these nitroglycerin tablets
under your tongue
oh and ill leave you some
that enough doctor
the judge will be asking for a saliva test
carter id better take
that thermos of cocoa with me
helps me wash down the pills
let me see it please
my learned patient is not above
substituting brandy for cocoa
it is cocoa so sorry
if you were a woman miss plimsoll
i would strike you
take care of this carter
now sir wilfrid in the courtroom
you must avoid overexcitement
yes doctor yes yes
watch your temper
keep your blood pressure down
thank you doctor i shall be quite safe
what with the pills and the cocoa
come along carter
from the body temperature
and other factors
we placed the time of death
at between 930 and 0pm
approximately 30 minutes before janet
mckenzie returned home and called us
death was instantaneous caused by one
blow from a heavy and blunt instrument
were there any signs of a struggle
none just the one blow
would that indicate that the murderer
had taken mrs french by surprise
my lord i must object
my learned friend refers
to the assailant as the murderer
we have not yet determined whether
the assailant was a man or a woman
it could quite conceivably
have been the murderess
mr myers sir wilfrid has joined us just in
time to catch you on a point of grammar
please rephrase your question
yes my lord inspector
is it your opinion that the assailant
whether he she or it
had taken mrs french by surprise
my lord i am taken by surprise
that my learned friend should try to solicit
from the witness an opinion not a fact
quite so youll have
to do better than that mr myers
my lord i withdraw the question entirely
is that better
that much better
silence silence
very well inspector
let us proceed with the facts
after establishing the cause and the time
of death what did you then do
a search was made photographs were
taken and the premises fingerprinted
what fingerprints did you discover
i found the fingerprints of mrs french
those of janet mckenzie and some which
later proved to be those of leonard vole
no others
no others
did you say the room had the appearance
that a robbery had been committed
yes things were strewn about and the
window had been broken near the catch
there was glass on the floor
and fragments were found outside
the glass outside was not consistent with
the window being forced from the outside
youre saying that someone made it look
as if it had been forced from the outside
my lord i must object my learned friend
is putting words in the witness mouth
after all if he insists
on answering his own questions
the presence of the witness
would seem superfluous
quite dont you think so mr myers
yes my lord
inspector
did you ascertain if any of the murdered
woman property was missing
according to the housekeeper
nothing was missing
in your experience inspector
when burglars or burglaresses
break into a house
do they leave without taking anything
no sir
do you produce a jacket inspector
yes sir
is that the jacket
yes sir
that is exhibit p my lord
where did you find this inspector
that is the jacket
found in the prisoner flat
which i handed to our lab
to test for bloodstains
and did you find any bloodstains
yes
though an attempt
had been made to wash them out
what tests were made
first to determine
if the stains were human blood
then to classify it by group or type
and was the blood
of a particular group or type
yes sir it is type o
and did you subsequently
test the blood of the dead woman
yes sir
what type was that
the same type o
thank you inspector
no further questions
inspector you say the only fingerprints
you found were those of mrs french
janet mckenzie and leonard vole
in your experience when a burglar breaks
in does he usually leave fingerprints
or does he wear gloves
he wears gloves
so the absence
of fingerprints in a robbery
would hardly surprise you
no sir
cant we surmise the burglar might have
entered a presumably empty house
suddenly encountered
mrs french and struck her
then realising she was dead
fled without taking anything
i submit my lord
that it is entirely impossible
to guess what went on in the mind
of some entirely imaginary burglar
with or without gloves
let us not surmise sir wilfrid
but confine ourselves to facts
inspector when you questioned
the prisoner as to the stains on his jacket
did he not show you
a recently-healed scar on his wrist
saying he had cut himself slicing bread
yes sir that is what he said
and were you not told
the same thing by his wife
yes sir but afterwards
just a simple yes or no please
did the prisoner wife show you a knife
and tell you that her husband
had cut his wrist while slicing bread
yes sir
i will ask you to examine this knife
just test the edge of it
with your finger carefully
you agree that the point
and the cutting edge are razor-sharp
yes sir
now if such a knife were to slip
might it not inflict a cut
that would bleed profusely
yes sir it might
inspector you stated that the bloodstains
on the prisoner jacket were analysed
as was the blood of mrs french and
they were both found to be of group o
that is correct
however
if the prisoner blood
were also of this same group
then the stains on his jacket
may well have resulted
from the household accident
he described to you
yes sir
did you examine
the prisoner blood inspector
no sir
i have here a certificate
stating that leonard stephen vole
is a blood donor
at the north london hospital
and that his blood is group o
thank you inspector
inspector granted that the cut
on the wrist was caused by that knife
is there anything to show
whether it was an accident
or done deliberately after the murder
to account for the bloodstains
oh really my lord
i withdraw the question
you may stand down
call janet mckenzie
janet mckenzie
janet mckenzie
janet mckenzie
i swear by almighty god
that the evidence
the truth the whole truth
and nothing but the truth
carter carter pill pill
your name is janet mckenzie
aye that my name
when did you first come to london
that was many years ago 28 years ago
where do you live
now that mrs french poor soul is dead
ive moved in with my niece
at 9 glenister road
you were companion-housekeeper
to the late mrs emily french
i was her housekeeper
ive no opinion of companions
poor feckless bodies afraid
of a bit of honest domestic work
i meant you were on friendly terms not
altogether those of mistress and servant
aye ten years i was with her
and looked after her
she knew me and she trusted me
many the time
i prevented her doing a foolish thing
please tell us in your own words about
the events of the evening of october 4
it was a friday and my night out i was
going to see my niece at glenister road
which is about five minutes walk
i left the house at half past seven
i promised to take her
a dress pattern that she admired
och is this thing necessary
an excellent question
however it has been installed at
considerable expense to the taxpayers
so let us take advantage of it
please continue
well when i got to my niece
i found id left the pattern behind
so after supper i slipped
back to get it as it was no distance
i got back to the house at 25 past 9
i let myself in
and went upstairs to my room
as i passed the sitting room i heard the
prisoner in there talking to mrs french
no it wasnt me it wasnt my voice
talking and laughing they were
but it was no business of mine
so i went upstairs to fetch my pattern
now let us be very exact as to the time
you say that you
re-entered the house at 25 past 9
aye the pattern was on a shelf in my
room next to my clock so i saw the time
and it was 25 past 9
go on please
i went back to my niece och
she was delighted with the pattern si
simply delighted i stayed until 20 to
then i said good night and i come home
i went into the sitting room to see
if the mistress wanted anything
before she went to bed
and there she was dead
and everything tossed hither and thither
did you really think
that a burglary had been committed
my lord i must protest
i will not allow that question
to be answered mr myers
miss mckenzie were you aware
that leonard vole was a married man
no indeed
and neither was the mistress
janet
my lord i must object
what mrs french knew or did not know is
pure conjecture on janet mckenzie part
let me put it this way
you formed the opinion
that mrs french thought
leonard vole was a single man
have you any facts to support this
the books that she ordered
a life of the baroness burdett-coutts
and the one about disraeli and his wife
both of them about women that married
men years younger than themselves oh
i knew what she was thinking
im afraid we cannot admit that
why
members of the jury it is possible
for a woman to read the life of disraeli
without contemplating marriage
with a man younger than herself
were you aware of the arrangements mrs
french made to dispose of her money
she had her old will revoked
and a new one drawn up
i heard her calling mr stokes
her solicitor
he was there at the time
the prisoner i mean
you heard mrs french
and the prisoner discussing her new will
yes he was to have all her money
she told him
as she had no near relations nor anybody
that meant to her what he did
when did this take place
on october 8
one week to the day
before she was murdered
thank you
that concludes my examination
not just yet miss mckenzie
would you thank you
miss mckenzie you have
given evidence about two wills
in the old will that which was revoked
were you not to receive
the bulk of mrs french estate
that so
whereas in the new will except for
a bequest to you of a small annuity
the principal beneficiary
is the prisoner leonard vole
itll be a wicked injustice
if he ever touches a penny of that money
it is entirely understandable
that you are antagonistic to the prisoner
im not antagonistic to him
he a shiftless scheming rascal
but im not antagonistic to him
i suggest you formed this opinion
because his friendship with mrs french
cost you the bulk of her estate
ive never liked him
your candour is refreshing
now on the night of october 4
you say you heard the prisoner
and mrs french talking together
what did you hear them say
i didnt hear what they actually said
you mean you only heard the voices
the murmur of voices
they were laughing
what makes you say
the man voice was leonard vole
i know his voice well enough
the door was closed was it not
aye that so
you were in a hurry to get the pattern
so you probably walked
quickly past the closed door
yet you are sure
you heard leonard vole voice
i was there long enough
to hear what i heard
come im sure you dont wish to suggest
to the jury that you were eavesdropping
it was him in there
who else could it have been
what you mean is that you wanted it to
be him that the way your mind worked
now tell me did mrs french sometimes
watch television in the evening
yes she was fond
of a talk or a good play
wasnt it possible when you
returned home and passed the door
what you really heard was the television
and a man and woman
voices and laughter
there was a play called lover leap
on the television that night
it was not the television
oh why not
because the television was away
being repaired that week that why
silence silence
odd it not time yet
if my learned friend has no further
questions id like
i have not quite finished
you are registered are you not
under the national health insurance act
aye that so
four and sixpence i pay out every week
that a terrible lot of money
for a working woman to pay
i am sure that many agree with you
miss mckenzie did you recently apply
to the national health insurance for
a hearing aid
for for what
i protest against the way
in which this question was put
i will repeat the question my lord
i asked you in a normal tone of voice
audible to everyone in open court
did you apply to the national health
insurance for a hearing aid
yes i did
did you get it
not yet
however you state that you walked past
a door which is four inches of solid oak
you heard voices
and you are willing to swear
that you could distinguish the voice of
the prisoner leonard vole
who who
no further questions
och maybe you could help me
your lordship
six months ago i applied for
my hearing aid and im still waiting for it
my dear miss mckenzie considering
the rubbish that is being talked nowadays
you are missing very little
you may stand down now
call police constable jeffries
police constable jeffries
police constable jeffries
i swear by almighty god
that the evidence i shall give
shall be the truth the whole truth
and nothing but the truth
mr myers does that conclude your case
no my lord i now call the final witness
for the prosecution christine helm
christine helm
christine helm
christine
i swear by almighty god
that the evidence i shall give
shall be the truth the whole truth
and nothing but the truth
my lord i have the most serious objection
to this witness being summoned
as she is the wife of the prisoner
i call my learned friend attention
to the fact that i summoned
not mrs vole but mrs helm
your name in fact is christine helm
yes christine helm
and you have been living
as the wife of the prisoner leonard vole
yes
are you actually his wife
no
i went through a marriage ceremony
with him but i already had a husband
he still alive
christine that not true
there is proof of a marriage
between the witness and the prisoner
but is there any proof
of a so-called previous marriage
my lord the so-called previous marriage
is in fact well-documented
mrs helm is this a certificate of marriage
between yourself and otto ludwig helm
the ceremony having taken place
in breslau on 8 april 942
yes that is the paper of my marriage
i dont see any reason why this witness
should not be qualified to give evidence
youre willing to give evidence against the
man youve been calling your husband
yes
you stated to the police that on the night
that mrs french was murdered
leonard vole left the house at 730
and returned at 25 minutes past 9
did he in fact return at 25 past 9
no he returned at ten minutes past ten
christine what are you saying
it not true you know it not true
silence
i must have silence
as your counsel will tell you
vole you will very shortly
have an opportunity of
speaking in your own defence
leonard vole returned you say
at ten minutes past ten
and what happened next
he was breathing hard very excited
he threw off his coat
and examined the sleeves
then he told me to wash the cuffs
they had blood on them
go on
i said what have you done
what did the prisoner say
he said ive killed her
christine why are you lying
why are you saying these things
what an awful woman
she evil ive known it all along
if the defence so desires
i will adjourn for a short time
so that the prisoner
may gain control of himself
my lord is most gracious
but pray let the witness continue
we are all of us caught up
in the suspense of this horror fiction
to have to hear it in instalments
might prove unendurable
proceed mr myers
mrs helm
when the prisoner said i have killed her
did you know to whom he referred
it was that woman
he had been seeing so often
when questioned by the police you told
them that the prisoner returned at 925
yes because leonard
asked me to say that
but youve changed your story now why
i cannot go on lying to save him
i said to the police what he wanted
because im grateful to him
he married me
and brought me to this country
what he has asked me to do i have
because i was grateful
it was not because
he was your husband and you loved him
i never loved him
it was gratitude then
that prompted you to give him an alibi
in your statement to the police
that is it exactly
but now you think it was wrong to do so
because it is murder
that woman she was a harmless old fool
and he makes of me
an accomplice to the murder
i cannot come into court and swear that
he was with me at the time it was done
i cannot do it i cannot do it
then this is the truth
that leonard vole returned
that night at ten minutes past ten
he had blood on the sleeves of his coat
and that he said to you
i have killed her
that is the truth
that is the truth before god
that is the truth
thank you
mrs vole or mrs helm
which do you prefer to be called
it does not matter
does it not
in this country we are inclined to take
a rather more serious view of marriage
however it would appear that when
you first met the prisoner in hamburg
you lied to him about your marital status
i wanted to get out of germany so
you lied did you not
just yes or no please
yes
thank you
and in arranging the marriage
you lied to the authorities
i um did not tell the truth
to the authorities
you lied to them
yes
and in the ceremony when you swore
to love honour and cherish your husband
that too was a lie
yes
and when the police questioned you
about this wretched man
who believed himself married and loved
you told them
i told them what he wanted me to
you told them that he was at home
with you at 25 minutes past 9
and now you say that that was a lie
yes a lie
and when you said that he had
accidentally cut his wrist again you lied
yes
and today you told a new story entirely
the question is frau helm
were you lying then are you lying now
or are you not in fact
a chronic and habitual liar
carter carter
the other pill under the tongue
my lord is my learned friend to be
allowed to bully and insult the witness
mr myers this is a capital charge
and within the bounds of reason
i should like the defence
to have every latitude
my lord may i also
remind my learned friend
that his witness by her own admission
has already violated so many oaths
that i am surprised the testament
did not leap from her hand
when she was sworn here today
i doubt if anything is to be gained
by questioning you any further
that will be all frau helm
mrs helm i presume you know the
meaning of the english word perjury
in german the word is meineid
yes meineid
it means to swear falsely under oath
and are you aware mrs helm
that the penalty in this country for perjury
is a heavy term of imprisonment
yes im aware
mindful of this fact i ask you once more
is the evidence that you have given
the truth the whole truth
and nothing but the truth
so help me god
then that my lord
is the case for the prosecution
want a tissue
yes thanks
it the first murder trial
ive ever been to it terrible
silence
sir wilfrid
are you ready for the defence
my lord members of the jury
the prosecution has very ably presented
against the prisoner leonard vole
a case with the most overwhelming
circumstantial evidence
among the witnesses you have heard
chief inspector hearne
who has given his testimony in a fair
and impartial manner as he always does
he has put before you a clever theory
of how this crime was committed
whether it is theory
or actual fact however
you will decide for yourselves
and then you have heard
the evidence of janet mckenzie
a worthy and devoted housekeeper who
has suffered two most grievous losses
one the death of her beloved mistress
and second in being deprived
of an inheritance of $80000
which shed fully expected to receive
i will not comment
further on her evidence
but will express only
my deepest sympathy for her
in both these mishaps
and most damaging of all the prosecution
has produced a surprise witness
one christine helm whom the prisoner
brought from the rubble of her homeland
to the safety of this country giving her
his love and the protection of his name
i objected to her testimony
because a wife cannot give evidence
harmful to her husband
but it has been proven that her marriage
to mr vole was fraudulent and bigamous
therefore her evidence must be admitted
and you must consider it
for what it is worth
such is the prosecution case
now it is the turn of the defence
we could present on behalf of
the prisoner witnesses to his character
his war record the lack of criminal
or evil association in his past
however only one witness
can shed new light
on this tragic riddle
the prisoner himself
members of the jury
i call leonard stephen vole
i swear by almighty god
that the evidence i give will be the truth
the whole truth and nothing but the truth
no
is your name leonard stephen vole
it is
where do live
620 edgware road
leonard stephen vole did you or did
you not on the night of october 4 last
murder emily jane french
i did not
thank you that will be all
have you in fact concluded your
examination of the prisoner sir wilfrid
the prisoner has endured three days
of profound mental agony and shock
the defence feels
his faculties should be spared
for the cross-examination
by my learned friend for the prosecution
this is not a plea for any indulgence
i am confident that
no matter how searching this may be
the prisoner will withstand it
at the time you made the acquaintance
of mrs french were you employed
no sir
how much money did you have
a few pounds
did she give you any
no
did you expect to receive any
no sir
did you know that in her new will
you were the beneficiary of $80000
no i didnt
now mr vole when you went to visit
mrs french for the last time
did you wear a trench coat
and a brown hat
yes i did
was it this coat and hat
yes sir
my lord the defence in its efforts
to establish an alibi for the prisoner
circulated this photograph
hoping to bring forth a witness
who had seen him leaving
mrs french house or entering his own
at the times that he has stated
apparently this splendid effort
was without results
however the defence
will be pleased to learn
that at the last moment
a witness has come forward
and that the prisoner had been
seen wearing this coat and this hat
lamentably he had not been seen on the
night of the murder but one week before
on the afternoon of october 8 were you
not in a travel agency in regent street
and did you not make inquiries about
prices and schedules of foreign cruises
supposing i did it not a crime is it
not at all many people go on a cruise
when they can afford to pay for it
but you couldnt pay for it could you
well i was hard up i told you that
and yet you came to this particular
travel agency with a clinging brunette
a clinging brunette mr myers
my lord the lady was so described to me
she was very affectionate with the
prisoner constantly clinging to his arm
oh
you then admit that you made inquiries
about expensive and luxurious cruises
how did you expect
to pay for such a thing
i dont know it was
if you dont know perhaps i can help
on the morning of the very same day
you heard mrs french change her will
leaving you the bulk of her money
i didnt
and in the afternoon
you started plans to dispose of it
no it was nothing of the kind
i was in a pub and i met a girl
i dont even remember her name
we had a drink and walked out together
we passed the window and saw the fancy
posters all blue seas and palm trees
the grecian isles or somewhere we went
in for fun and i started asking for folders
well the man gave me a funny look
because i did look a bit shabby
anyway it irritated me
so i kept asking for the swankiest tours
all de luxe and cabin on the boat deck
but it was just an act
an act you knew that in a week
you were going to inherit $80000
no it wasnt that way at all
it was make-believe and childish but
it was fun and i enjoyed it i never thought
of killing anyone or inheriting any money
it just a coincidence that mrs french
should be killed only one week later
i told you i didnt kill her
do you know any reason why christine
helm should give the evidence she has
if it were not true
no i dont know why my wife
i dont know why i still call her my wife
she must be lying or out of her mind
she seemed remarkably
sane and self-possessed
but insanity is all you can suggest
i dont understand it
oh god what happened
what changed her
very effective im sure
but in this court we deal with fact
and the fact mr vole
is that weve only your word for it
that you left mrs french house
at the time you say
that you came home at 5 and 20 minutes
past 9 and that you did not go out again
somebody must have seen me
in the street or going in the house
one would think so but the only person
who did see you come home that night
says it was ten past ten
and that you had blood on your hands
i cut my wrist
you cut your wrist deliberately
no i didnt i didnt do anything
but you make it sound as though i did
i can hear it myself
you came home at ten past ten
no i didnt youve got to believe me
youve got to believe me
you killed emily french
no i didnt i didnt do it
i didnt kill her i never killed anybody
god it like a nightmare
some ghastly horrible dream
good evening sir wilfrid
how did it go today
oh sir wilfrid
im from hawks and hill sir and ive
brought your bermuda shorts for a fitting
what
youd better slip these on sir wilfrid
im in the middle of a murder trial
itll all be over by the afternoon
and the boat train doesnt go until 940
you work it out you know my shape
youve stabbed it often enough
upstairs you need a lukewarm bath
and your calcium injection
and there a lot more packing to be done
it ridiculous having boat reservations
the jury may be out for days
not on this case im afraid
it seems too open-and-shut
i watched when frau helm
was on the stand they didnt like her
no but they believed her they liked
leonard vole but they didnt believe him
and that travel agency business
doesnt help either cigar
no
wilfrid do you think she lied
well dont you
im not sure
i am she lied whether she calls it
meineid or perjury she lied
the only question is why what
her game what is she up to what
i hope that in your final speech you
wont become too emotionally involved
you must think of your condition
he right
i want to see you save yourself
this isnt going to be your last case
yes it is but until it over
im still a barrister
my client life is at stake
that all that matters his life
he entitled to the best that i can do
if i cant stand up to make my final appeal
for him ill make it sitting down
if i become short of breath ill take a pill
or two pills or all of them and the box too
yes

to whom these were addressed miss
miss um
where is she
on that train i should think doesnt want
her other cheek slashed cant blame her
care for another sir
hm
good idea
silence
be upstanding in court
all persons who have anything
to do before my lords
the queen justices of oyer and terminer
and general jail delivery for the
jurisdiction of the central criminal court
draw near and give your attendance
god save the queen
since the defence has called
but one witness the prisoner
it has the right to be heard last
mr myers if you are ready let us have
the final address for the prosecution
my lord members of the jury
i will be brief in my final speech
because i think weve proved so obvious
a case of murder against leonard vole
that a verdict of guilty
must be the only possible conclusion
i will briefly summarise these facts
youd better begin again mr myers
that is if sir wilfrid
is at all interested in our proceedings
i am indeed my lord the speech
for the crown however is premature
i ask that the case for the defence be
reopened and that a witness be recalled
i most strenuously object to the case
being reopened at this final stage
evidence of a startling nature
has come into my possession
the course my learned friend
proposes is quite unprecedented
i have anticipated this objection
and can meet it with ample precedent
there is the king vs stillman reported
in the criminal appeal reports of 926
at page 463
also the king vs porter in volume one
of the king bench division reports
942 at page 53
and lastly there is the case
of the king vs sullivan
in which this issue was raised which
im sure your lordship will remember
since you appeared for the prosecution
i did oh yes before mr justice swindon
what is this new evidence sir wilfrid
letters my lord
letters written by christine helm
my lord the prosecution
continues its objection
if my memory serves me well
your lordship similar objection
in the king against sullivan
was sustained
your memory for once
serves you ill mr myers
my objection then was overruled
by mr justice swindon
as yours is now by me
call christine helm
christine helm
christine helm
christine helm
if you still have doubts about mr vole i
wouldnt mind betting you a box of cigars
mrs helm you appreciate
you are still under oath
yes
do you know a man named max
i dont know what you mean
it a simple question do you
or do you not know a man called max
max certainly not
it a fairly common name and yet
youve never known a man named max
in germany perhaps but a long time ago
i shall not ask you to go back that far
just a few weeks to october 20 last
what have you got there
a letter
i suggest that on october 20
you wrote a letter
i dont know what youre talking about
addressed to a man named max
i did nothing of the sort
the letter was but one of a series
written to the same man
lies all lies
you seem to have been well let us say
on intimate terms with this man
how dare you say a thing like that
it isnt true
im not concerned with the general trend
of this correspondence only one letter
my beloved max
an extraordinary thing has happened
i believe all our difficulties
may be ended
i will not stand here
and listen to a pack of lies
that letter a forgery
it isnt even my letter paper
it isnt
no
i write my letters on small blue paper
with my initials on it
like this
this is a bill from my tailor for a pair
of extremely becoming bermuda shorts
wilfrid the fox that what we call him
and that what he is
now mrs helm youve been kind enough
to identify your letter paper
now if you like i can have an expert
identify your handwriting
damn you
damn you
leave her alone
damn you
mrs helm
let me go
let me get out of here let me go
mrs helm
let me go
usher get the witness a chair
sir wilfrid will you now read the letter
in question so that the jury may hear it
my beloved max
an extraordinary thing has happened
all our difficulties may soon be solved
leonard is suspected of murdering
the old lady i told you about
his only hope of an alibi
depends on me and me alone
suppose i testify that he was not at home
with me at the time of the murder
that he came home
with blood on his sleeves
and that he even admitted to me
that hed killed her
strange that he always said
he would never let me leave him
but now if this succeeds
he will be leaving me
because they will take him away forever
and i shall be free and yours
my beloved
i count the hours until
we are together christine
mrs helm
will you go back to the witness box
i now ask you again christine helm
did you write this letter
christine tell him you didnt write it
i know you didnt
please answer my question
did you write this letter
before answering mrs helm
i wish to warn you that the law regarding
perjury in this country is very severe
if you have already
committed perjury in this courtroom
i strongly advise you
not to add to your crime
but if this letter
has not been written by you
then now is the time to state this fact
i wrote the letter
and that my lord
is the case for the defence
i keep asking which is harder
your head or your arteries
stop pressing your luck youre overdue
were all packed and ready
i hope the jury wont take all afternoon
i concede
congratulations here are your cigars
not yet
come on it all over
wrapped up neat and tidy
what wrong
it a little too neat too tidy
and altogether too symmetrical
that what wrong with it
the jury is back
youre not worried about the verdict
it not their judgment
that worries me it mine
come along
where my wig
the prisoner will stand up
members of the jury
are you all agreed upon your verdict
we are
do you find the prisoner at the bar
leonard stephen vole
guilty or not guilty
of the murder of emily jane french
not guilty mlord
silence
silence
leonard stephen vole
you have been found not guilty
of the murder
of emily jane french on october 4
you are hereby discharged
and are free to leave the court
persons with anything more to do
before the queen justices
of oyer and terminer and jail delivery
for the jurisdiction of the central
criminal court may depart the area
thank you yes well talk later
thank you mr mayhew
thank you mr brogan-moore carter
thank you sir wilfrid for everything
you were wonderful
id say we were lucky all around
yeah
i have your belongings sign the receipt
mr vole and we can release you
mr vole  they didnt call me mr
when they charged me
ill go with you i have your hat and coat
let go before they change their mind
chipper isnt he an hour ago
he had one foot on the gallows
and the other on a banana peel
you ought to be very proud wilfrid
arent you
not yet weve disposed of the gallows
but there still that banana peel
somewhere under somebody foot
every word you said was a lie
you ought to be locked up liar
youd better wait here
until we get rid of that crowd madam
thank you
ready sir miss plimsoll will be waiting
let me finish the last of the cocoa
while im still beyond her jurisdiction
would you excuse me
brogan-moore carter thank you
i never thought you british could get
so emotional especially in public
i apologise for my compatriots
it all right
i dont mind being called names or
pushed around or even kicked in the shin
but i have a ladder
in my last pair of nylons
in case you are not familiar with
our prison regulations no silk stockings
prison will i go to prison
you heard the judge
you will certainly be charged with perjury
tried for it and to prison you shall go
well it wont be for life will it
if i were appearing
for the prosecution it would be
you loathe me dont you
like the people outside
what a wicked woman i am
and how brilliantly you exposed me
and saved leonard life
the great sir wilfrid robarts did it again
well let me tell you something
you didnt do it alone you had help
what are you driving at
im not driving at anything
leonard is free and we did it
we
remember
when you said that no jury would
believe an alibi given by a loving wife
no matter how much she swore
he was innocent that gave me the idea
what idea
the idea that i should be a witness not
for my husband but for the prosecution
that i should swear leonard was guilty
and that you should expose me as a liar
because only then would they believe
leonard was innocent
so now you know
the whole story sir wilfrid
ill give yer something
to dream about mister
want to kiss me ducky
i suspected something but not that
never that
thank you for the compliment
it been a long time since i acted
and i never played such an important role
all those blue letters
it took me hours to write them
to invent max there never was a max
there never been anyone but leonard
my dear could you not have trusted me
worked with me truthfully
and honourably we would have won
i could not run that risk
you thought he was innocent
and you knew he was innocent
i understand
no sir wilfrid
you do not understand at all
i knew he was guilty
that cant be true no
listen to me once and for all
he came home after ten
he had blood on his sleeves
he said he had killed the woman
only i could save him he pleaded
and you saved him a murderer
again you dont understand
i love him
i told you she was an actress
and a good one
leonard
i knew shed do something
but i just didnt know what or how
leonard leonard
fooled you completely didnt she
it was you vole who fooled me
oh easy easy we both got
out of this alive let stay this way
where are your pills
youve made a mockery of english law
who did you got me off
and i cant be tried again for this
that english law too isnt it
you cant touch him now nobody can
the scales of justice
may tip one way or another
but ultimately they balance out
youll pay for this
ultimately a long way off id rather
pay for it as soon as possible and in cash

lots of money once the will goes through
im not cheap i want everybody
to get something out of it
