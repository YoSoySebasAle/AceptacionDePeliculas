
did you hear that
they shut down the main reactor
well be destroyed for sure
this is madness
were doomed
therell be no escape
for the princess this time
what that
r2-d2 where are you
at last where have you been
theyre heading in this direction
what are we going to do
well be sent to the spice mines of
kessel or smashed into who knows what
wait a minute where are you going
the death star plans
are not in the main computer
where are those transmissions
you intercepted
what have you done with those plans
we intercepted no transmissions
this is a consular ship
were on a diplomatic mission
if this is a consular ship
where is the ambassador
commander tear this ship apart
until youve found those plans
and bring me the passengers
i want them alive
there one set for stun
shell be all right
inform lord vader we have a prisoner
hey youre not permitted in there
it restricted
youll be deactivated for sure
dont call me a mindless philosopher
you overweight glob of grease
come out before somebody sees you
secret mission what plans
what are you talking about
im not getting in there
im going to regret this
there goes another one
hold your fire there no life-forms
it must have short-circuited
that funny the damage
doesnt look as bad from out here
are you sure this thing is safe
darth vader only you could be so bold
the imperial senate
will not sit still for this
when they hear youve attacked
dont act so surprised your highness
you werent on
any mercy mission this time
several transmissions were beamed
to this ship by rebel spies
i want to know what happened
to the plans they sent you
i dont know what youre talking about
im a member of the imperial senate
on a diplomatic mission to alderaan
you are part of the rebel alliance
and a traitor
take her away
holding her is dangerous
if word of this gets out
it could generate
sympathy for the rebellion
in the senate
i have traced the rebel spies to her
now she is my only link
to finding their secret base
shell die before
shell tell you anything
leave that to me
send a distress signal and then inform
the senate that all aboard were killed
lord vader the battle station plans
are not aboard this ship
and no transmissions were made
an escape pod was jettisoned
during the fighting
but no life-forms were aboard
she must have hidden
the plans in the escape pod
send a detachment
down to retrieve them
see to it personally commander
therell be no one to stop us this time
yes sir
how did we get into this mess
i really dont know how
we seem to be made to suffer
it our lot in life
ive got to rest before i fall apart
my joints are almost frozen
what a desolate place this is
where do you think youre going
well im not going that way
it much too rocky
this way is much easier
what makes you think
there are settlements over there
dont get technical with me
what mission
what are you talking about
ive just about had enough of you
go that way
youll be malfunctioning within a day
you nearsighted scrap pile
and dont let me catch you
following me begging for help
because you wont get it
no more adventures
im not going that way
that malfunctioning little twerp
this is all his fault
he tricked me into going this way
but hell do no better
wait what that
a transport im saved
over here
hey hey
help please help
r2
r2-d2 it is you it is you
someone was in the pod
the tracks go off in this direction
look sir droids
we stopped
wake up wake up
were doomed
do you think theyll melt us down
dont shoot dont shoot
will this never end
fine let go
luke
luke
luke tell your uncle if he gets
a translator be sure it speaks bocce
doesnt look like we have much choice
but ill remind him
yeah well take that red one
no not that one
you i suppose youre programmed
for etiquette and protocol
protocol
why it my primary function sir
i am well-versed in all the customs
i have no need for a protocol droid
of course you havent sir
not in an environment such as this
that why i have been programmed
what i need is a droid who understands
the binary language
of moisture vaporators
vaporators sir my first job
was programming binary load lifters
very similar to your vaporators
in most respects
can you speak bocce
of course i can sir
it like a second language to me
all right shut up ill take this one
shutting up sir
luke
take these two over
to the garage will you
i want them cleaned up before dinner
but i was going into tosche station
to pick up some power converters
you can waste time with your friends
when your chores are done
now come on get to it
all right come on
and the red one come on
well come on red let go
uncle owen
yeah
this r2 unit has a bad motivator look
hey what are you trying to push on us
excuse me sir but that r2 unit
is in prime condition a real bargain
uncle owen what about that one
yeah
what about that blue one
well take that one
take this away
youll be pleased with that one sir
he really is in first-class condition
ive worked with him before
here he comes
okay let go
now dont you forget this
why i should stick my neck out for you
is quite beyond my capacity
thank the maker
this oil bath is going to feel so good
ive got such a bad case of
dust contamination i can barely move
it just isnt fair
biggs is right
im never gonna get out of here
is there anything i might do to help
no not unless you can alter time
speed up the harvest
or teleport me off this rock
i dont think so sir
im only a droid and not very
knowledgeable about such things
not on this planet anyway
as a matter of fact
im not even sure which planet im on
well if there a bright center
to the universe
youre on the planet
that it farthest from
i see sir
you can call me luke
i see sir luke
just luke
and i am c-3po
human-cyborg relations
and this is my counterpart r2-d2
hello
you got a lot of carbon scoring here
looks like you boys
have seen a lot of action
with all weve been through
sometimes im amazed
were in as good condition as we are
what with the rebellion and all
you know of the rebellion
against the empire
that how we came to be
in your service
if you take my meaning sir
have you been in many battles
several i think
actually there not much to tell
im not much more than an interpreter
and not very good at telling stories
well not at making them
interesting anyway
well my little friend
you got something jammed
in here real good
were you on a starcruiser or
help me obi-wan kenobi
youre my only hope
what this
what is what
he asked you a question what is that
help me obi-wan kenobi
youre my only hope
help me obi-wan kenobi
youre my only hope
oh he says it nothing sir
merely a malfunction
old data pay it no mind
who is she she beautiful
im afraid im not quite sure sir
i think she was a passenger
on our last voyage
a person of some importance i believe
our captain was
is there any more to this recording
behave yourself r2
youre going to get us into trouble
it all right you can trust him
he our new master
youre my only hope
he says he the property
of obi-wan kenobi
a resident of these parts
and it a private message for him
quite frankly sir i dont know
what he talking about
our last master was captain antilles
but with all weve been through
this little r2 unit
has become a bit eccentric
obi-wan kenobi
i wonder if he means old ben kenobi
i beg your pardon sir but do you know
what he talking about
i dont know anyone named obi-wan
but old ben lives out
beyond the dune sea
he kind of a strange old hermit
i wonder who she is
sounds like she in trouble
i better play back the whole thing
he says the restraining bolt has
short-circuited his recording system
he suggests that if you remove the bolt
he might be able to play back
the entire recording
oh yeah well
i guess youre too small
to run away on me if i take this off
okay
there you go
wait a minute whered she go bring her
back play back the entire message
what message
the one youve just been playing
the one youre carrying
inside your rusty innards
luke luke
ill be right there aunt beru
im sorry sir but he appears to have
picked up a slight flutter
here see what you can do with him
ill be right back
just you reconsider
playing that message for him
no i dont think he likes you at all
no i dont like you either
you know i think that r2 unit we bought
might have been stolen
what makes you think that
i stumbled across a recording
while i was cleaning him
he says he belongs to someone
called obi-wan kenobi
i thought he might have meant old ben
do you know what he talking about
i wonder if he related to ben
that wizard just a crazy old man
tomorrow i want you to take
that r2 unit to anchorhead
and have its memory erased
thatll be the end of it
it belongs to us now
but what if this obi-wan
comes looking for him
he wont
i dont think he exists anymore
he died about the same time
as your father
he knew my father
i told you to forget it
your only concern is to prepare
those new droids for tomorrow
in the morning
i want them up there on the south ridge
working on those condensers
yes sir
i think those new droids
are gonna work out fine
in fact i was also thinking
about our agreement
about me staying on another season
and if these new droids do work out
i want to transmit my application
to the academy this year
you mean the next semester
before the harvest
sure there more than enough droids
harvest is when i need you the most
it only one season more
this year well make enough
on the harvest
that ill be able to hire
some more hands
and then you can go
to the academy next year
you must understand
i need you here luke
but it a whole nother year
it only one more season
that what you said
when biggs and tank left
where are you going
looks like im going nowhere
i have to go finish
cleaning those droids
owen he cant stay here forever
most of his friends have gone
it means so much to him
ill make it up to him next year
i promise
luke just not a farmer owen
he has too much of his father in him
that what im afraid of
what are you doing hiding back there
it wasnt my fault sir
please dont deactivate me
i told him not to go
but he faulty malfunctioning
kept babbling on about his mission
oh no
that r2 unit has
always been a problem
these astro droids
are getting quite out of hand
even i cant understand
their logic at times
how could i be so stupid
he nowhere in sight
blast it
pardon me sir
but couldnt we go after him
it too dangerous
with the sandpeople around
well have to wait till morning
luke im shutting the power down
all right
ill be there in a few minutes
boy am i gonna get it
you know that little droid gonna
cause me a lot of trouble
oh he excels at that sir
come on
luke
luke
luke
have you seen luke this morning
he said he had some things to do before
he started today so he left early
did he take those new droids with him
i think so
he better have those units in
the south range repaired by midday
or therell be hell to pay
there a droid on the scanner
dead ahead
it might be our little r2 unit
hit the accelerator
hey whoa
just where do you think youre going
master luke is your rightful owner now
well have no more
of this obi-wan kenobi gibberish
dont talk to me of your mission either
youre fortunate he doesnt blast you
into a million pieces right here
no it all right
but i think wed better go
what wrong with him now
there are several creatures
approaching from the southeast
sandpeople or worse
come on let go have a look
come on
well there are two banthas down there
but i dont see any
wait a second
theyre sandpeople all right
i can see one of them now
hello there
come here my little friend
dont be afraid
dont worry hell be all right
rest easy son youve had a busy day
youre fortunate to be all in one piece
ben ben kenobi
boy am i glad to see you
the jundland wastes
are not to be traveled lightly
tell me young luke
what brings you out this far
this little droid
i think he searching
for his former master
but ive never seen
such devotion in a droid before
he claims to be the property
of an obi-wan kenobi
is he a relative of yours
do you know who he talking about
obi-wan kenobi
obi-wan
now that a name
ive not heard in a long time
a long time
i think my uncle knows him
he said he was dead
oh he not dead
not yet
you know him
well of course i know him
he me
i havent gone by the name of obi-wan
since oh before you were born
well then the droid does belong to you
i dont seem to remember
ever owning a droid
very interesting
i think we better get indoors
the sandpeople are easily startled
but theyll soon be back
and in greater numbers
3po
where am i
i must have taken a bad step
can you stand weve gotta get out
of here before the sandpeople return
i dont think i can make it
you go on master luke
there no sense in you risking yourself
on my account im done for
no youre not
what kind of talk is that
quickly theyre on the move
my father didnt fight in the wars
he was a navigator on a spice freighter
that what your uncle told you
he didnt hold
with your father ideals
thought he should have stayed here
and not gotten involved
you fought in the clone wars
yes
i was once a jedi knight
the same as your father
i wish id known him
he was the best starpilot in the galaxy
and a cunning warrior
i understand youve become
quite a good pilot yourself
and he was a good friend
which reminds me
i have something here for you
your father wanted you to have this
when you were old enough
but your uncle wouldnt allow it
he feared you might follow old obi-wan
on some damn-fool idealistic crusade
like your father did
sir if youll not be needing me
ill close down for a while
sure go ahead
what is it
your father lightsaber
this is the weapon of a jedi knight
not as clumsy or random as a blaster
an elegant weapon
for a more civilized age
for over a thousand generations
the jedi knights
were the guardians of
peace and justice in the old republic
before the dark times
before the empire
how did my father die
a young jedi named darth vader
who was a pupil of mine
until he turned to evil
helped the empire hunt down
and destroy the jedi knights
he betrayed and murdered your father
now the jedi are all but extinct
vader was seduced
by the dark side of the force
the force
the force is
what gives a jedi his power
it an energy field
created by all living things
it surrounds us and penetrates us
it binds the galaxy together
now let see if we cant figure out
what you are my little friend
and where you come from
i saw part of a message
i seem to have found it
general kenobi years ago you served
my father in the clone wars
now he begs you to help him
in his struggle against the empire
i regret that i am unable to present
my father request in person
but my ship has fallen under attack
and im afraid my mission
to bring you to alderaan has failed
i have placed information
vital to the survival of the rebellion
into the memory systems
of this r2 unit
my father will know how to retrieve it
you must see this droid
safely delivered to him on alderaan
this is our most desperate hour
help me obi-wan kenobi
youre my only hope
you must learn the ways of the force
if youre to come with me to alderaan
alderaan
im not going to alderaan
ive gotta get home
it late im in for it as it is
i need your help luke
she needs your help
im getting too old
for this sort of thing
i cant get involved
ive got work to do
it not that i like the empire
i hate it
but there nothing
i can do about it right now
it all such a long way from here
that your uncle talking
oh boy my uncle
how am i ever gonna explain this
learn about the force luke
look i can take you
as far as anchorhead
you can get a transport there
to mos eisley or wherever youre going
you must do what you feel
is right of course
until this battle station is fully
operational we are vulnerable
the rebel alliance
is too well equipped
theyre more dangerous
than you realize
dangerous to your starfleet
commander
not to this battle station
the rebellion will continue to
gain support in the imperial senate
the imperial senate will no longer
be of any concern to us
ive just received word that the emperor
has dissolved the council permanently
the last remnants of the old republic
have been swept away
that impossible
how will the emperor maintain control
without the bureaucracy
the regional governors now have
direct control over their territories
fear will keep
the local systems in line
fear of this battle station
and what of the rebellion
if the rebels have obtained a complete
technical readout of this station
it is possible however unlikely
that they might find a weakness
and exploit it
the plans you refer to
will soon be back in our hands
any attack made by the rebels against
this station would be a useless gesture
no matter what technical data
theyve obtained
this station is now
the ultimate power in the universe
i suggest we use it
dont be too proud of this
technological terror youve constructed
the ability to destroy a planet
is insignificant
next to the power of the force
dont try to frighten us with
your sorcerer ways lord vader
your sad devotion
to that ancient religion
has not helped you conjure up
the stolen data tapes
or given you clairvoyance enough
to find the rebels hidden fortress
i find your lack of faith disturbing
enough of this vader release him
as you wish
this bickering is pointless
lord vader will provide us with
the location of the rebel fortress
by the time this station is operational
we will then crush the rebellion
with one swift stroke
it looks like the sandpeople did this
all right
there gaffi sticks bantha tracks
ive just never heard of them
hitting anything this big before
they didnt but we are
meant to think they did
these tracks are side-by-side
sandpeople always ride single file
to hide their numbers
these are the same jawas
that sold us r2 and 3po
and these blast points
too accurate for sandpeople
only imperial stormtroopers
are so precise
but why would imperial troops
want to slaughter jawas
if they traced the robots here
they may have learned
who they sold them to
and that would lead them back home
wait luke
it too dangerous
uncle owen
aunt beru
uncle owen
now your highness we will discuss
the location of your hidden rebel base
there nothing you could have done
had you been there
youd have been killed too
and the droids would now be
in the hands of the empire
i want to come with you to alderaan
there nothing for me here now
i want to learn the ways of the force
and become a jedi like my father
mos eisley spaceport
you will never find a more wretched
hive of scum and villainy
we must be cautious
how long have you had these droids
about three or four seasons
theyre up for sale if you want them
let me see your identification
you dont need
to see his identification
we dont need to see his identification
these arent the droids
youre looking for
these arent the droids
were looking for
he can go about his business
you can go about your business
move along
move along move along
i cant abide those jawas
disgusting creatures
go on go on
i cant understand
how we got by those troops
i thought we were dead
the force can have a strong influence
on the weak-minded
you really think were gonna find
a pilot here thatll
take us to alderaan
most of the best freighter pilots
are to be found here
only watch your step
this place can be a little rough
im ready for anything
come along r2
hey we dont serve their kind here
what
your droids
theyll have to wait outside
we dont want them here
why dont you wait out by the speeder
we dont want any trouble
i heartily agree with you sir
uh ill have one of those
he doesnt like you
im sorry
i dont like you either
you just watch yourself
were wanted men i have the
death sentence on 2 systems
ill be careful then
youll be dead
this little one not worth the effort
come let me get you something
aah
im all right
chewbacca here is first mate
on a ship that might suit us
i dont like the look of this
han solo im captain
of the millennium falcon
chewie here tells me youre looking
for passage to the alderaan system
yes indeed if it a fast ship
fast ship youve never heard of
the millennium falcon
should i have
it the ship that made the kessel run
in less than 2 parsecs
ive outrun imperial starships
not the local bulk cruisers mind you
im talking about
the big corellian ships now
she fast enough for you old man
what the cargo
only passengers
myself the boy two droids
and no questions asked
what is it some kind of local trouble
let just say wed like to avoid
any imperial entanglements
well that the real trick isnt it
and it gonna cost you
something extra
ten thousand all in advance
ten thousand
we could almost
buy our own ship for that
but who gonna fly it kid you
you bet i could
im not such a bad pilot myself
we dont have to sit here and listen
we can pay you 2000 now
plus 5 when we reach alderaan
seventeen
okay you guys got yourselves a ship
well leave as soon as youre ready
docking bay 94
ninety-four
looks like somebody beginning
to take an interest in your handiwork
all right well check it out
seventeen thousand those guys
must really be desperate
this could really save my neck
get back to the ship get it ready
youll have to sell your speeder
that okay
im never coming back
to this planet again
going somewhere solo
yes greedo
as a matter of fact
i was just going to see your boss
tell jabba that ive got his money
it too late you should have
paid him when you had the chance
jabba put a price on your head so large every
bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you
im lucky i found you first
yeah but this time
ive got the money
if you give it to me i
might forget i found you
i dont have it with me
tell jabba
jabba through with you
he has no time for smugglers
who drop their shipments at
the first sign of an imperial cruiser
even i get boarded sometimes
do you think i had a choice
you can tell that to jabba
he may only take your ship
over my dead body
that the idea
ive been looking forward
to this for a long time
ill bet you have
sorry about the mess
her resistance to the mind probe
is considerable
itll be some time before we can
extract any information from her
the final checkout is completed
all systems are operational
what course shall we set
perhaps she would respond
to an alternative form of persuasion
what do you mean
i think it is time we demonstrated
the full power of this station
set your course for alderaan
with pleasure
lock the door r2
all right
check this side of the street
the door locked
move on to the next one
i would much rather have gone with
master luke than stay here with you
i dont know what this trouble is about
but im sure it must be your fault
you watch your language
all right give it to me ill take it
look at this ever since the xp-38
came out they just arent in demand
itll be enough
solo come out of there solo
right here jabba
ive been waitin for you
have you now
you didnt think
i was gonna run did you
han my boy you disappoint me
why havent you paid me
and why did you fry poor greedo
jabba next time
you wanna talk to me
come see me yourself
dont send one of these twerps
han i cant make exceptions
what if everyone who smuggled for me
dropped their cargo at the first sign
of an imperial starship
it not good business
look jabba
even i get boarded sometimes
you think i had a choice
but i got a nice easy charter
ill pay ya back plus a little extra
i just need a little more time
han my boy youre the best
so for an extra twenty percent
fifteen jabba
dont push it
okay fifteen percent
but if you fail me again
ill put a price on your head so big
you wont be able to go
near a civilized system
jabba youre a
wonderful human being
come on
if the ship as fast as he boasting
we ought to do well
what a piece of junk
shell make 5 past light speed
she may not look like much
but she got it where it counts kid
ive made a lot of special
modifications myself
but were a little rushed so if youll
just get on board well get outta here
hello sir
which way
all right men load your weapons
stop that ship blast them
chewie get us out of here
oh my id forgotten
how much i hate space travel
looks like an imperial cruiser
our passengers
must be hotter than i thought
hold em off
angle the deflector shields
while i make the calculations
for the jump to light speed
stay sharp there two more comin in
theyre gonna try and cut us off
why dont you outrun em
you said this thing was fast
watch your mouth or youre gonna
find yourself floating home
well be safe enough
once we make the jump to hyperspace
besides i know a few maneuvers
well lose em
here where the fun begins
how long before you can
jump to light speed
itll take a few moments to get
the coordinates from the navicomputer
are you kidding
at the rate theyre gaining
traveling through hyperspace
aint like dustin crops boy
without precise calculations
wed fly right through a star
or bounce too close to a supernova
and that would end your trip real quick
what that flashing
were losing a deflector shield
go strap yourselves in
im gonna make the jump to light speed
weve entered the alderaan system
governor tarkin
i should have expected
to find you holding vader leash
i recognized your foul stench
when i was brought on board
charming to the last
you dont know how hard i found it
signing the order
to terminate your life
im surprised you had the courage
to take the responsibility yourself
princess leia before your execution
i would like you to be my guest
at a ceremony
that will make
this battle station operational
no star system will dare
oppose the emperor now
the more you tighten your grip tarkin
the more star systems
will slip through your fingers
not after we demonstrate
the power of this station
in a way you have determined
the choice of the planet
thatll be destroyed first
since you are reluctant to provide us
with the location of the rebel base
i have chosen to test
this station destructive power
on your home planet of alderaan
no alderaan is peaceful we have
no weapons you cant possibly
you would prefer another target
a military target
then name the system
i grow tired of asking this
so it will be the last time
where is the rebel base
dantooine
theyre on dantooine
there you see lord vader
she can be reasonable
continue with the operation
you may fire when ready
what
youre far too trusting
dantooine is too remote
to make an effective demonstration
but dont worry we will deal with
your rebel friends soon enough
no
commence primary ignition
are you all right what wrong
i felt a great disturbance in the force
as if millions of voices suddenly
cried out in terror
and were suddenly silenced
i fear something terrible has happened
youd better get on with your exercises
you can forget your troubles
with those imperial slugs
i told you id outrun them
dont everybody thank me at once
anyway we should be at alderaan
about 0200 hours
now be careful r2
he made a fair move
screaming about it cant help you
let him have it
it not wise to upset a wookiee
but sir nobody worries
about upsetting a droid
that cause a droid
dont pull people arms
out of their sockets when they lose
wookiees are known to do that
i see your point sir
i suggest a new strategy r2
let the wookiee win
remember a jedi can feel the force
flowing through him
you mean it controls your actions
partially
but it also obeys your commands
oh
hokey religions and ancient weapons
are no match
for a blaster at your side kid
you dont believe in the force do you
kid ive flown from one side
of this galaxy to the other
ive seen a lot of strange stuff
but ive never seen anything
to make me believe
there one all-powerful force
controlling everything
there no mystical energy field
controls my destiny
it all a lot of
simple tricks and nonsense
i suggest you try it again luke
this time let go your conscious self
and act on instinct
with the blast shield down i cant see
how am i supposed to fight
your eyes can deceive you
dont trust them
stretch out with your feelings
you see you can do it
i call it luck
in my experience
there no such thing as luck
look good against remotes is one thing
good against the living
that something else
looks like were coming up on alderaan
you know i did feel something
i could almost see the remote
that good youve taken
your first step into a larger world
yes
our scout ships
have reached dantooine
they found the remains of a rebel base
but they estimate that
it has been deserted for some time
they are now conducting an extensive
search of the surrounding systems
she lied she lied to us
i told you she would never
consciously betray the rebellion
terminate her immediately
stand by chewie here we go
cut in the sublight engines
what the
weve come out of hyperspace
into a meteor shower
some kind of asteroid collision
it not on any of the charts
what going on
our position correct
except no alderaan
what do you mean where is it
that what im trying to tell you
it aint there it been blown away
what how
destroyed by the empire
the entire starfleet
couldnt destroy the whole planet
itd take a thousand ships
with more firepower than ive
there another ship coming in
maybe they know what happened
it an imperial fighter
it followed us
no it a short-range fighter
there arent any bases around here
where did it come from
sure is leaving in a big hurry
if they identify us were in trouble
not if i can help it
chewie jam its transmissions
let it go it too far out of range
not for long
a fighter that size couldnt get
this deep into space on its own
he must have gotten lost
been part of a convoy or something
he aint gonna be around
long enough to tell anybody about us
look at him
he heading for that small moon
i think i can get him before he
gets there he almost in range
that no moon
it a space station
it too big to be a space station
i have a very bad feeling about this
turn the ship around
yeah i think youre right
full reverse
chewie lock in the auxiliary power
chewie lock in the auxiliary power
why are we still moving towards it
were caught in a tractor beam
it pulling us in
there gotta be something you can do
there nothing i can do kid
im at full power i have to shut down
theyre not gonna
get me without a fight
you cant win
but there are alternatives to fighting
clear bay 327
we are opening the magnetic field
to your stations come with me
close all outboard shields
close all outboard shields
yes
weve captured a freighter entering
the remains of the alderaan system
its markings match those of a ship
that blasted its way out of mos eisley
they must be trying to return
the stolen plans to the princess
she may yet be of some use to us
unlock one five seven and nine
release charge
three-one-six report to control
there no one on board sir
according to the log the crew
abandoned ship right after takeoff
it must be a decoy sir several escape
pods have been jettisoned
did you find any droids
no sir
if there were any
they must also have jettisoned
send a scanning crew aboard
i want every part of this ship checked
yes sir
i sense something
a presence ive not felt since
get me a scanning crew in here
on the double
i want every part of this ship checked
there no one here
boy it lucky you have
these compartments
i use them for smuggling i never
thought id be smuggling myself in em
this is ridiculous
even if i could take off
id never get past the tractor beam
leave that to me
damn fool
i knew you were gonna say that
who the more foolish
the fool or the fool who follows him
the ship all yours if the scanners
pick up anything report it immediately
all right let go
hey down there
could you give us a hand with this
tk-42 why arent you at your post
tk-42 do you copy
take over weve got a bad transmitter
ill see what i can do
between his howling
and your blasting everything
it a wonder the whole station
doesnt know were here
bring em on i prefer a straight fight
to all this sneakin around
weve found the computer outlet sir
plug in he should be able to
interpret the entire imperial network
he says he found the controls to the
power beam that holding the ship here
hell try to make the precise location
appear on the monitor
the tractor beam is coupled
to the main reactor in seven locations
a power loss at one of the terminals
will allow the ship to leave
i dont think you boys can help
i must go alone
whatever you say ive done more than
i bargained for on this trip already
i want to go with you
be patient luke
stay and watch over the droids
they must be delivered safely
or other star systems will suffer
the same fate as alderaan
your destiny lies along
a different path from mine
the force will be with you
always
you said it chewie
where did you dig up that old fossil
ben is a great man
yeah great at getting us into trouble
i didnt hear you give any ideas
anything better than just hangin
around waiting for em to pick us up
who do you think
what is it
im afraid im not quite sure sir
he says ive found her
and keeps repeating she here
who who has he found
princess leia
the princess she here
princess
where where is she
princess what going on
level 5 detention block aa-23
im afraid she scheduled
to be terminated
oh no weve gotta do something
what are you talking about
the droids belong to her
she the one in the message
we gotta help her
dont get any funny ideas
the old man wants us to wait here
he didnt know she was here
find a way into that detention block
im not going anywhere
theyre gonna execute her
you said you didnt want to just wait
to be captured now you want to stay
marching into the detention area
is not what i had in mind
but theyre gonna kill her
better her than me
she rich
rich
rich powerful if you were to
rescue her the reward would be
what
well more wealth than you can imagine
i dont know i can imagine quite a bit
youll get it
i better
you will
all right kid
you better be right about this
all right
what your plan
3po hand me those binders there
will you
okay
now im gonna put these on you
okay han you put those on
dont worry chewie
i think i know what he has in mind
master luke sir pardon me for asking
but what should r2 and i do
if were discovered here
lock the door
and hope they dont have blasters
that isnt very reassuring
57 to scan control
57 to scan control

5-3 to upper bay door
i cant see a thing

but everything
perfectly all right now

thank you
how are you
were sending a squad up
negative negative

give us a few minutes to lock it down
large leak very dangerous

dont underestimate the force
the jedi are extinct
their fire has gone out of the universe

of their religion
yes
we have an emergency alert
in detention block aa-23
the princess put all sections on alert
obi-wan is here the force is with him

he must not be allowed to escape
escape is not his plan
i must face him alone
get behind me get behind me
watch your left
they went down the cell bay
cant get out that way
looks like you managed to cut off
our only escape route
maybe youd like it back in your cell
your highness
c-3po c-3po
yes sir
are there any other ways out of
the cell bay weve been cut off
what was that i didnt copy

seems to be the only way in or out
all other information on your level
is restricted
open up in there open up in there

it nothing outgassing
dont worry about it
there she is
c-3po do you copy
yes sir

where are you going
he certainly has courage
what good will it do us
if he gets himself killed come on
aaaah
i think we took a wrong turn
there no lock
that oughta hold them for a while
quick weve got to get across
find the controls to extend the bridge
i think i just blasted it
theyre coming through
here hold this
here they come
for luck
we think they may be splitting up
they may be on level 5 and 6 now sir
where could they be
close the blast doors
open the blast doors
open the blast doors
ive been waiting for you obi-wan
we meet again at last
the circle is now complete
when i left you i was but the learner
now i am the master
only a master of evil darth
your powers are weak old man
you cant win darth
if you strike me down
i shall become more powerful
than you can possibly imagine
you should not have come back
didnt we just leave this party
what kept you
we ran into some old friends
the ship all right
seems okay if we can get to it
i hope the old man got
the tractor beam down
look
come on r2 were going
now our chance go
ben
no
come on
luke come on
come on
luke it too late
blast the door kid
run luke run
i hope that old man got
the tractor beam out of commission
or this is gonna be a short trip
okay hit it
were coming up on their sentry ships
hold them off
angle the deflector shields
while i charge up the main guns
i cant believe he gone
there wasnt anything
you could have done
come on buddy
were not out of this yet
you in kid okay stay sharp
here they come
theyre coming in too fast
weve lost the lateral controls
dont worry shell hold together
hear me baby hold together
ha ha
got him i got him
great kid dont get cocky
there still two more of them
out there
that it we did it
we did it
help i think im melting
this is all your fault
are they away
theyve just made the jump
into hyperspace
youre sure the homing beacon
is secure aboard their ship
im taking an awful risk vader
this had better work
not a bad bit of rescuing huh
you know
sometimes i amaze even myself
that doesnt sound too hard
they let us go it the only
explanation for the ease of our escape
easy you call that easy
theyre tracking us
not this ship sister
at least the information in r2
is still intact
what so important
what he carrying
the technical readouts
of that battle station
i only hope that when the data
analyzed a weakness can be found
it not over yet
it is for me sister
look i aint in this
for your revolution
and im not in it for you princess
i expect to be well paid
im in it for the money
you neednt worry about your reward
if money is all that you love
then that what youll receive
your friend is quite a mercenary
i wonder if he really cares
about anything or anybody
i care
so
what do you think of her han
im trying not to kid
good
still she got a lot of spirit
what do you think you think
a princess and a guy like me
no
youre safe when we heard about
alderaan we feared the worst
we have no time for sorrows
commander
you must use the information
in this r2 unit to help plan the attack
it our only hope
yes
were approaching the planet yavin
the rebel base is on a moon
on the far side
we are preparing to orbit the planet
the battle station is heavily shielded
and carries a firepower
greater than half the starfleet
its defenses are designed around
a direct large-scale assault
a small one-man fighter should be able
to penetrate the outer defense
pardon me for asking sir
but what good are snub fighters
against that
the empire doesnt consider a small
one-man fighter to be any threat
or theyd have a tighter defense
an analysis of the plans
provided by princess leia
has demonstrated a weakness
in the battle station
the approach will not be easy
youre required to maneuver
straight down this trench
and skim the surface to this point
the target area is only two meters wide
it a small thermal exhaust port
right below the main port
the shaft leads directly
to the reactor system
a precise hit will start
a chain reaction
which should destroy the station
only a precise hit will
set up a chain reaction
the shaft is ray-shielded
so youll have to use proton torpedoes
that impossible even for a computer
but it not impossible
i used to bull-eye
womp rats in my t-6 back home
theyre not much bigger
than two meters
then man your ships
and may the force be with you
orbiting the planet
at maximum velocity
the moon with the rebel base
will be in range in 30 minutes
this will be a day long remembered
it has seen the end of kenobi
and will soon see
the end of the rebellion
all flight crews
man your stations
all flight crews man your stations
so you got your reward
and youre just leaving then
that right yeah
i got some old debts
i gotta pay off with this stuff
even if i didnt
you dont think id be fool enough
to stick around here do ya
why dont you come with us
youre pretty good in a fight
we could use ya
come on
why dont you take a look around
you know what about to happen
what theyre up against
they could use a good pilot like you
youre turning your back on them
what good a reward
if you aint around to use it
besides attacking that battle station
aint my idea of courage
it more like suicide
all right
well take care of yourself han
i guess that what youre best at
isnt it
hey luke
may the force be with you
what are you looking at
i know what im doing
all pilots to your stations
all pilots to your stations
what wrong
oh it han
i dont know
i really thought hed change his mind
he got to follow his own path
no one can choose it for him
i only wish ben were here
open main launch tubes
main launch tubes opening sir
hey luke
biggs
i dont believe it how are ya
coming up
ill be up there with you
