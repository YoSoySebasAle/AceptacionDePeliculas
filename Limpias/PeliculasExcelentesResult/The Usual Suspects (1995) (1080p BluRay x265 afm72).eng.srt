pissed about that truck getting hijacked
they were hoping somebody
would give them something to go on
they knew we wouldnt fight it

fenster and mcmanus

a fast jump high risk long money
we all knew it could be done
the way i figured
to do it wrong meant killing
to do it right took five men
five men meant keaton
keaton took convincing
new york finest taxi service
bullshit
bullshit
they dont operate any more
mcmanus has a friend in the 4th
precinct theyre coming out for one job

new york finest taxi service
was not your normal service
it was a ring of corrupt cops in the nypd
that ran a high-profit racket
driving smugglers and
drug dealers round the city
for a few hundred dollars a mile
you got your own police escort
they even had business cards
after a while somebody started asking
questions and the service shut down
since then internal affairs have
been waiting to catch them in the act
that where we came in
so how was the flight
fucking great
will this get me to staten island
you kidding me
thisll get you to cape cod
mcmanus brought us the job fenster got
the vans hockney supplied the hardware
i came up with how to do it

50 more cops went down with them
everybody got it right in the ass
from the chief on down

i would like to propose a toast
there you go

the man with the plan
verbal were gonna miss the flight

i said well make it
were gonna miss the plane
shell understand
that heart-warming really
im weepy
jeff you wanna wait outside
you guys wanted to know
what happened after the line-up
come on verbal
who do you think youre talkin to
you expect me to believe that he retired
for a woman
bullshit keaton was using her
he loved her
sure
im supposed to believe
hitting the taxi service wasnt his idea
that was all fenster and mcmanus
keaton was a cop for four years
kujan whod know the service better
but edie had him turned around
let me tell you something
i know dean keaton
ive been investigating him
for the past three years
the guy i know was
a cold-blooded bastard
iad indicted him on three murder counts
before he was kicked off the force
so dont sell me the hooker with a heart
you got him all wrong
do i keaton was under indictment a total
of seven times while he was on the force
in every case the witnesses
either reversed their testimony
or died before they could testify
when they finally did nail him for fraud
he spent five years in sing sing
he killed three prisoners inside
of course i cant prove this
but i cant prove the best part either
dean keaton was dead
did you know that he died in a fire
two years ago during an investigation
into the murder of a witness
who was going to testify against him
two people saw dean keaton walk into
a warehouse he owned before it blew up
they said he went in
to check a leaking gas main
it blew up and took
all of dean keaton with it
within three months of the explosion
the two witnesses they were dead
one killed himself in his car
the other fell down an open elevator shaft
beeping
agent baer
get this show on the road
there are too many people here
doctor well be out of here
before he blows his porch light
i have a noon meeting
five minutes
everyone calm down all right
i want you to ask this man
about the shoot-out in the harbour
speaks hungarian
he says they were buying
dope we know
he doesnt know what they were buying
but not dope uh people
what
kovash continues speaking
he needs guarantees
what is he talking about
he says his life in danger
he saw the devil looked him in the eye
im on my way
no no no wait a minute
ask him to tell him what he told me
about the devil
who the devil
keyser söze
keyser söze
he was in the harbour killing many men
he saw keyser söze
kovash carries on speaking
he saw his face
tell him to tell her what he looks like
describe him
ok
kujan six weeks ago
an anonymous call tells me
i can find keaton at mondino
with his attorney and there he is
because he never profited
from his alleged death
and we convicted someone else
of the murder we tried to pin on him
we had to let him go
he was dead just long enough
for the murder rap to blow over
and then he had lunch
i dont know about that
oh i dont think you do
but you say you saw keaton die youre
covering his ass and he still out there
i think he behind that whole circus at the
harbour he using you cos youre stupid
you tell me he dead so be it i wanna be
sure he is before i go back to new york
he wasnt behind anything
it was the lawyer
what lawyer
what lawyer verbal
when i was in that barbershop quartet
i know you held out on the da
what did you leave out of that testimony
i can call up ruby in ten minutes
the da gave me immunity
not from me you get no immunity
from me you piece of shit
every criminal ive put in prison
every cop that owes me a favour
every creep that walks the street for
a living will know the name of verbal kint
now you talk to me or that immunity
they seem so fit to grant you
wont be worth the paper the contract
put out on your life is printed on
there was a lawyer
kobayashi

no but im sure keaton is dead
convince me
and tell me every last detail

no no
better put a leash on that puppy
you know it an awful shame
about saul gettin whacked
the cops are gonna be
lookin for the guys who did it
sooner or later theyre gonna
come around askin me
you have a sweet night ladies
fuck you
so this lawyer
kobayashi
came from redfoot
right
why leave this out
when you talked to the da
dave someone to see you
jack
been lookin for you still after that coke
from the harbour blood bath yesterday
yeah
stop lookin there was no coke
i been in la county talkin to a guy they
pulled out of a drainpipe in san pedro
he came to this morning
he in a hungarian mob doing a deal with
argentinians says it was no dope deal
but the $9 million
we know he says no way on the dope
he tells me they were pulling
stumps for turkey the next day
they had no time to negotiate that kind
of product and no means to move it
what the money for
he didnt know no one knew
except for a few key people
they were all very hush about it he says
whatever it was it was very sensitive
i don t get it
they tell me you got the cripple from
new york did he mention keyser söze
who
just bear with me here
who keyser söze
aw fuck
weve been going over this
for an hour and a half
what we need to do is find redfoot
keaton and get the hell outta here
what we need to do is think think back
somebody with power
somebody capable of
trackin us from new york to la
dean what the hell are we doin here
were waitin
im out
sit down
no it hot and im fuckin bored
man mr hockney do stay
mr keaton
mr fenster i recognise from
his mug shots as well as mr mcmanus
i can only assume that you are mr kint
the gentleman who disposed of saul berg
my employer sends his gratitude
a most unexpected benefit
i am mr kobayashi
i have been asked by my employer
to bring a proposal to you gentlemen
what do you want
my employer requires your services
one job one day work very dangerous
he does not expect all of you to live
but those of you who do
will have $9 million to divide
between you in any way you see fit
who your boss
i work for keyser söze
who keyser söze
judging by the change in mood mr kint
i feel sure the rest of
your associates can tell you
i come with an offer directly from mr söze
an order actually
what do you mean an order
in 98 mr keaton you participated in a
hijacking of a truck in buffalo new york
the cargo was raw steel
steel which belonged to mr söze
and which was destined for pakistan
to be used in a nuclear reactor
a most profitable violation
of un regulations
you had no way of knowing this
because the fellow shipping the steel
was working for mr söze
without his knowledge
earlier this year mr fenster and mr
mcmanus hijacked a flight out of newark
the plane was carrying gold and
platinum wiring also set for pakistan
two months ago mr hockney stole a
truck carrying gun parts through queens
gun parts which were set to be
destroyed by the state of new york
they were to be lost in a way station
and rerouted to belfast
again mr söze
using pawns who had no knowledge
which brings us to mr kint
nine months ago one of
mr söze less than intelligent couriers
was taken in a complicated
confidence scam by a cripple
he was relieved of $62000
now it has taken us some time to find you
our intention was to approach you
after your apprehension in new york
you set up the line-up
yes
you were not to be released until i arrived
it seems ms finneran was a little
too effective in expediting his release
holding the rest of you was a moot point
what about redfoot
mr redfoot knew nothing
mr söze rarely works
with the same people for long
and they never know
who theyre working for
one cannot be betrayed
if one has no people
so why are you telling us
because you have stolen from
mr söze mr fenster all of you
that you did not know you stole from him
is the only reason you are still alive
he feels you owe him
you will repay your debt
all right fuck the debt and fuck you
how do we know you work for söze
i dont think that is relevant mr hockney
all five of you are responsible for the
murder of saul berg and his bodyguards
mr redfoot can testify to your
involvement and we can see to it he will
what your point
the offer is this gentlemen
mr söze primary interest is narcotics
he been competing shall we say with
a group of argentinians for years now
competing with mr söze has taken its toll
the argentinians are negotiating the sale
of $9m in cocaine in three days time
this purchase will revitalise the
diminishing strength of their organisation
mr söze would like you to stop the deal
if you choose
you may wait until after the buy
whatever money changes hands is yours
mr söze would like you to get to the boat
and destroy the cocaine on board
and then you will be free
of your obligations to mr söze
you give me one good reason
why i shouldnt kill you right now
a gift from mr söze
good day gentlemen
my whole life in here -
everything ive done since i was 8
they fuckin know everything
everybody ive ever worked with
or did time with
no
this isnt right
i dont know
who was that guy who used
to talk about söze in new york
bricks marlin
yeah i did jobs for him indirect stuff
he said he always made five times
more money than the job was worth
this guy a pipe dream kobayashi
usin him for window-dressing
i dont know this is bad
no it bullshit
this guy could be lapd
it a fuckin set-up
the way i hear it
söze is some kind of butcher
a peerless psycho fucked-up butcher
there is no keyser söze
who is keyser söze
he supposed to be turkish
some say his father was german
nobody ever believed he was real
nobody ever knew him or saw anybody
that worked directly for him
but to hear kobayashi tell it anybody
couldve worked for him you never knew
that was his power
the greatest trick the devil ever pulled
was convincing the world he didnt exist
one story the guys told me the story
i believe was from his days in turkey
a gang of hungarians
wanted their own mob
they realised that to be in power you
didnt need guns or money or numbers
you just needed the will
to do what the other guy wouldnt
after a while they come into power
and they come after söze
he was small-time then
just running dope they say
they come to his home in the afternoon
looking for his business
they find his wife and kids in the house
and decide to wait for söze
he comes home to find his wife raped
and children screaming
the hungarians knew söze was tough so
they let him know they meant business
they tell him they want
his territory all his business
söze looks over the faces of his family
then he showed these men of will
what will really was
he tells him he would
rather see his family dead
than live another day after this
he lets the last hungarian go
waits until his family are buried
then goes after the rest of the mob
he kills their kids their wives
their parents and their parents friends
he burns down the houses they live in
and the stores they work in
he kills people that owe them money
and like that he gone
underground
nobody ever seen him since
he becomes a myth a spook story
that criminals tell their kids at night
rat on your pop
and keyser söze will get you
but no one ever really believes
do you believe in him verbal
keaton always said
i dont believe in god
but im afraid of him
well i believe in god
and the only thing that scares me
is keyser söze
do you give any weight to this
i can introduce you to dan metzheiser
from justice he has a file on söze in dc
been a hobby of his guys equate him
to that reporter on the incredible hulk
knock at door
youve heard of him
on the street
yeah
a few times
outside stuff
somebody working for a guy
who worked for a guy who got some
money from keyser söze shit like that
it could be an old badge a hex sign
to keep people from fucking with you
but youre here
shit yeah
i got a guy trying to leave hospital on
a fried drumstick cos he afraid of söze
yeah ill run it up the flagpole
i told it like it happened on the boat
so what if i left out how i got there
it so full of holes the da wouldve
told me to blow amnesty out my ass
that why you never told the da
you tell me agent kujan
if i said the loch ness monster
hired me what would you say
turn state evidence well hear it out
i got immunity what can you offer me
if there really is a keyser söze
he gonna come looking for you
where your head where do you
think the pressure coming from
keyser söze or whatever you
wanna call him knows where i am
he got the front burner under your ass
to let me go so he can scoop me up later
immunity was to deal with you
i got a new problem when i post bail
so why play into his hands
we can protect you
oh gee thanks dave
bang-up job so far extortion coercion
kiss my pucker
the fuckers that rounded us up and sank
us are now bailing me out fuck you
you think you can catch keyser söze
you think a guy like that comes this close
to getting caught and sticks his head out
if he comes up for anything
itll be to get rid of me
after that my guess is
youll never hear from him again
beeping
what happened next
the next morning fenster was gone
he couldnt handle slumming for söze
he left us a note wishing us good luck
and took a chunk of the money
then what
mcmanus was furious
he was talking about tracking him down
and ripping his heart out all sorts of shit
that night we got the call
what call
kobayashi told us
where we could find fenster
hockney let get the fuck outta here
we gotta bury him
with what
with our hands
oh this is nuts
it dry fucking sand mcmanus
when he rots the surfers
are gonna smell him a mile away
dig you fuck
what we gonna do he gonna kill us
i dont know about you peg leg
but i can run i got no problem with that
kobayashi doesnt seem
to have a problem with it either
if you run were gonna be
diggin a hole for you you got that
this aint my boy were buryin
i dont owe anybody
so fuck you
he was my partner for five years
we did more jobs and i saw more money
than you can ever count so fuck you
cos now it payback
it not payback
it precaution you want payback
you wanna run i dont care
im not doin this for fenster
im not doin it for you
im doin this for me
im gonna finish this thing
this kobayashi bastard
is not gonna stand on me
after they killed fenster nobodyd run
i wanted to i thought we could make it
why didnt you say anything
i tried but keaton wouldnt have it
it was too far-fetched for him
keaton was a grounded guy an ex-cop
to a cop the explanation is never
that complicated it always simple
there no mystery
no arch criminal behind it all
if you got a dead body and
think his brother did it youre right
nobody argued with keaton they just
set their minds to whacking kobayashi
theyre coming up
did you hear me he coming up
he on his way down
two gunshots
dont move
press 20 do it now
move
the answer is no
mr söze will be most upset
listen cocksucker there is no keyser
söze you mention him again ill kill you
a strange threat i can only assume
youve come here to kill me anyway
we know that you can get to us
but now you know that we can get to you
im giving you one
last chance to call this off
mr sö my employer has made up
his mind he does not change it
neither do we
you got fenster but you wont get all of
us before one of us gets through to you
i believe you mr mcmanus
i most sincerely do
you would not have been chosen were
you not suitable but it not my decision
whatever you threaten
me with is ludicrous
in comparison to what will be done to me
if i do not carry out my orders in full
im the guy that gonna get you
i just wanted you to know that
im so sorry mr mcmanus
i implore you mr keaton believe me
mr söze is very real and very determined
well see
before you do me in mr mcmanus
you will let me finish my business
with ms finneran first wont you
what did you say
edie finneran
she upstairs in my office
for an extradition deposition
i requested she be put on the case
personally she flew in yesterday
no matter
kill away mr mcmanus
youre lyin
am i
ms finneran escort while she here in
la never leaves her side for a moment
i thought youd be glad
to know she in good hands
now rest the boat will
be ready for you on friday
if i see you or any of
your friends before then
ms finneran will find herself the victim
of a gruesome violation before she dies
as indeed will your father mr hockney
and your uncle randall in arizona mr kint
i might only castrate
mr mcmanus nephew david
do i make myself clear
well take care of the bodies downstairs
well add them to the cost of mr fenster
if youll excuse me gentlemen
sighing
it a logistical nightmare
close quarters 0 maybe 20 men
no tellin how many more are below
can we stealth these guys
nah with all that coke
theyre gonna be ready
which brings me to
sunny point number two
even if one of us gets through and
jacks the boat we still got nothin
what if we wait for the money
ten more men at least
in my opinion it cant be done anybody
who goes in there is not comin out alive
im gonna wait for the money
hockney me too
did you hear what he just said
if im goin in i want a cut
me too
there nothing that cant be done
i just cant believe
were gonna walk into certain death
the news said it raining in new york
indistinct voices
whispers what language is that
i dont know
russian i think
hungarian
sh
chatter continues
package has arrived
you kids ready
i would be if i didnt have
to stop and answer you
im ready mcmanus
you better be set up in ten seconds
im ready
i want you to stay here
im supposed to cover the
listen if we fail take the money and go
keaton i cant
find edie tell her what happened
she knows people she knows what to do
if i dont get kobayashi my way
shell get him her way
what if i

indistinct voices
addresses men in spanish

fernando
¿qué hace aquí

mcmanus  old macdonald had a farm
ee-eye ee-eye oh
and on that farm he shot some guys
bada-boom bada-bing bang boom
yelling
elvis has left the building
shouting
man screams
no dispare ¡vámonos
oh man
chuckles
hello
why didnt you run
i froze up
i thought about fenster and
how he looked when we buried him
then i thought about keaton
it looked like he might pull it off
dave
a boy came across a body on the beach
this morning shot twice in the head
two men from the bureau identified him
what else
his name was arturro marquez
a smuggler from argentina
he was arrested last year
in new york for trafficking
he escapes to california
they pick him up in long beach
theyre setting up extradition
he escapes again
now get this edie finneran brought in
to advise on the proceedings
kobayashi
new york faxed a copy of his testimony
he was a rat
yeah a big fucking rat
arturro was very opposed
to returning to prison
so much so that
he named close to 50 people
guess who he named in the finale
keyser söze
baer there more
ill tell you what i know
stop me when this sounds familiar
there was no dope on that boat
argh
footsteps
you stay quiet
he here i know he here
that him im telling you
that him i know he here
you cant understand that him
shut up
that him you hear me
im telling you it keyser söze
two gunshots
mechanical whirring
where hockney
i dont know there no coke
what
you heard me you dumb fuck no coke
what the fuck do you mean
ive been in every fucking room
there gotta be coke
there is nothing nothing
dont fuck with me
there is no fucking coke
im outta here
i told them nothing
i swear
i told them nothing please
gunshots
mcmanus what the fuck is goin on
the strangest thing
your statement says you saw a man
in a suit with a slim build
wait a minute
are you saying you saw keyser söze
you said you didnt know who it was
there was dope on that boat
stop stallin
im not
you know what im gettin at
hey i got immunity i wont take this
you know you know
what im gettin at verbal
i dont know
yes you do the truth
try to tell me you saw someone kill keaton
i did
youre lying to me
i am not
youve known this whole fuckin time
i dont know what youre saying
i did see keaton get shot i swear
then why didnt you help him
you had a gun he was your friend
because i was afraid ok
afraid
afraid of what
i knew it was keyser söze
but keaton
it was keyser söze agent kujan
i mean the devil himself
how do you shoot the devil in the back
what if you miss
all right let get back to the pier
sirens
arturro marquez ever hear of him
what no
he was a stool pigeon
for the justice department
he swore out a statement
saying that he had seen
and could positively identify
one keyser söze
it says in the report he had
intimate knowledge of his businesses
including but not exclusive
to drug-trafficking and murder
i never heard of him
his people were selling him
to a gang of hungarians
most likely the same hungarians
söze all but wiped out back in turkey
the money wasnt there for dope
the hungarians were gonna buy the one
guy that could incriminate keyser söze
i said i never heard of him
keaton did
edie finneran was marquez extradition
adviser she knew what he knew
i dont under
there were no drugs it was a hit
a suicide mission to whack out the
one guy that could finger keyser söze
so söze put some thieves to it men he
knew he could march into certain death
youre saying söze
sent us to kill someone
keaton did verbal
he left you behind for a reason
just do what i tell you
if you all knew sözed find you anywhere
why did he give you the money to run
he could have used you on the boat
he wanted me to live
a one-time dirty cop
without a loyalty in the world
finds it in his heart
to save a worthless rat cripple
no sir why
edie
i dont buy the reform story for a minute
even if i did i certainly dont believe
he would send you to protect her
so why
because he was my friend
no verbal he wasnt your friend
keaton didnt have friends
what are you doin here
he saved you because
he wanted it that way it was his will
keaton was keyser söze
no
the kind of man who could wrangle
men like hockney and mcmanus
the kind of man who could engineer
a line-up through all his contacts at nypd
the kind of man who
couldve killed edie finneran
she was found yesterday at a hotel
in pennsylvania shot twice in the head
what do you think
about keaton now verbal
edie
he used all of you to get him on that boat
he couldnt get on alone
he had to pull the trigger himself
to make sure he got his man
the one man that could identify him
this is all bullshit
you said you saw him die
or did you you had to hide
when you heard the police cars
you said you heard the shot before the fire
but you didnt see him die
i knew him he would never
he programmed you to tell us
just what he wanted you to
he knew we were close
you said it yourself
where was the political pressure
coming from it was keaton
immunity was your reward
but why me
why not fenster mcmanus or hockney
im stupid im a cripple why me
because youre a cripple verbal
because youre stupid
because youre weaker than them
if he dead if what you say is true
then it wont matter
it was his idea to hit the taxi service
in new york wasnt it tell me the truth
it was all keaton
we followed him from the beginning
i didnt know i saw him die
i believe he dead oh christ
youre not safe on your own
you think he
keyser söze
i dont know verbal
keyser söze a shield
or like you said a spook story
but i know keaton and someone
is out there pulling strings for you
stay and let us protect you
no way im not bait i post today
you posted 20 minutes ago
captain leo wants you out of here asap
unless you turn state
ill take my chances
if someone wants to get you
theyre gonna get you out there
turn state evidence
you might never see trial
maybe so
but im not a rat agent kujan
fuckin cops

kujan ill find him
rabin waste of time
kujan a rumour not
a rumour that doesnt die
rabin what

yeah but it all has a system dave
it all makes sense when you look at
it right you gotta stand back from it
you wanna see a real horror show
you should see my garage
kujan convince me
when i was in that barbershop quartet in
skokie where your head agent kujan

kobayashi youve heard many tales
mcmanus bricks marlin

living will know the name of verbal kint

that way
kujan i know you know something
im smarter than you and
im gonna find out what i wanna know
to a cop the explanation simple
you know what im gettin at the truth
no arch criminal behind it all
keaton somebody with power
kovash in hungarian keyser söze
who keyser söze
you think a guy like that comes this close
to getting caught and sticks his head out
because youre stupid verbal
because youre a cripple
who the gimp
youve known the whole fuckin time
who keyser söze
who keyser söze
verbal im sure keaton is dead

kujan first thing i learnt on the job
was how to spot a murderer
baer they tell me you got the cripple
from new york he mention keyser söze
kujan who
verbal after that my guess is
youll never hear from him again
the greatest trick the devil ever pulled
was convincing the world he didnt exist
and like that
he gone
