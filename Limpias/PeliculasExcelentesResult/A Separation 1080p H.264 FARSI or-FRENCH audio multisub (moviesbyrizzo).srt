is this right
when someone is thrown theyll fall straight
they dont hit here and bounce off
and hit here and then turn
and hit here and fall here
right
if id thrown her from there
she shouldve fallen there on those steps
or she would fall straight on the railing
she wouldnt fall like this
imagine you were thrown
follow the direction
then how had she fallen there
i dont know
im just saying
she wasnt thrown on these steps
come and stand here
and hit here and then turn
and hit here and fall here
i want you to know go on
did he throw you in this direction
no towards the lower level
you look
this door doesnt allow me to
even if i want to it not possible
where did you fall down
on these stairs
which step
i think it was this one
you think or youre sure
im not sure

i didnt see her fall
when i got here she was on that lower step

i was so sick
i didnt know what happened to me
look ill stand in her place
you in the doorway
and push me as hard as you want
im saying it not possible to fall there

you choose who pushes you
im saying it not possible
im saying if you push from here
she wont fall on the stairs

they all say they saw her on that one
maam did you see her get thrown
from up there i couldnt see the door
but i saw the stairs when she fell

that morning when i saw her here i asked her
why there was garbage on the steps
she said she had gotten dizzy
and dropped the bag

then why does she try to get
my daughter to speak
i did no such thing
you are a teacher arent you ashamed
why did you ask her if i hit her mom
and she lost the baby
i never did
you pick on a 4-year-old drawing
and tell her her dad hit her mom
and she lost the baby
i didnt say that
why do you think we beat our wives
and children like animals
i swear on this quran
were humans just like you
i have nothing to lose
tell your husband
not to make me do something crazy
ill wait by the door
im unemployed
ill stand out there all clay
eventually youll come out
come to the court and say you lied
or ill get to the bottom of what between
you and her husband
shame on you ive been patient so far
so why are you defending him
i told the truth

the lady that took care of my dad
apparently that day you gave her
the number for a gynecologist
i wanted to ask you for that number to call
and see if she went
to see the doctor that week
and what her problem was
i would appreciate you calling me back
thank you
what do you want to do
with what
you want to keep this up
every day a new fight
why what happened

and embarrassed her in front of everyone
what did he say
he screamed her dad killed my child
how can she go back to that school
do you know what you are doing
what i am doing
he making threats
he wouldnt dare
termeh go to your room
what if he kills your child
on her way to school
what do you want me to do
run off abroad with you
to hell with abroad
why cant you talk normally
this is about termeh
and the situation youve put her in
ive put her in
you have some nerve accusing me
who left home
who filed for a divorce
you said leave whenever you want
why did you come back
i didnt im here because of her situation
her situation fine
you have two choices
dont try to intimidate me
what intimidation
either you clear up the situation
no i know what to do
didnt you hit her
didnt she fall didnt her baby die
yes i killed her child
why are you so stubborn
pay the blood money and end it
i wont be forced into paying
why forced
put yourself in their place
im not responsible for their troubles
their child died
and my dad has been hurt
he doesnt even speak anymore
he didnt speak much before
i was happy with the few words he spoke
is it as bad as losing a baby
where were you to see i caused it
then how did she lose it
i dont know
there might be a chance that
her husband did something
and now she wants to blame me
her child said that day
she had gone to the doctor
why couldnt she wait two hours
to go to the doctor
why did she tie the old man
to his bed and leave
the examiner said
her child died due to a blow
how do we know it was a blow from me
i wont accept it till it been proven to me
fine let me take termeh
shame on you
for putting pressure on me now
i am worried about her
your child wants to live here
she has to stay here and learn
learn what fighting and obstinacy
to learn not to be a coward like you
who gives in so easily
he knows who to frighten
why doesnt he threaten me
yes im a coward
your whole life
instead of solving problems
youve either run away or
raised your hands and given in
just say why you want to leave this country
youre afraid to stay
i was gone one week
and you couldnt manage
i couldnt manage and im responsible
give me termeh and you do what you want
termeh sweetie you dont have to stay
go wherever you like
you still dont want to come

yes i knew
your mom was telling the truth
when they were talking in the hall
i heard everything from the kitchen
then why did you say you didnt
do you know what would happen
if i said i knew
one and a half to three years in prison
i only thought of what would happen to you
who youd stay with
i said i didnt know
if you knew why did you hit her
i knew she was pregnant
but at that moment i didnt
i had forgotten iti wasnt paying attention-
so tell them this
the law doesnt care about this
either i knew or i didnt
look at me

that she gave the number i told him
you told him
yes
okay
what crime did i commit
nothing youre right
he not accepting his responsibility
i admit that he to blame
but in the end what will happen

for a payment plan of the blood money
but why that what upsets me
why do you think it for the money
when did i say such a thing
you think i am a bum and my kid died
and i dont understand anything
i never said anything like that
let see what she saying
there no other way
your child wont come back
i admit that he to blame
but in the end what will happen
her husband didnt do it on purpose
theyre good people
for giving you a solution
take the money and settle it
you can use it in your situation
right now well decide on an amount
and ill get my husband approval
now we have to get his approval
for god sake leave us alone
you act like you dont need the money
take a look at yourself
dont let him go
wait a second i want to talk to you
will you stay
mom
let me speak to him
come sit i want to talk to you
i can hear you
i went and spoke to her husband today
sit down
i managed
to get him to agree
to take 5 million instead of 40 million
three five-million checks
in exchange for his consent
how dare you speak to him about money
i cant handle the stress of my child safety
you dont get it
just now when you were late
i was worried sick
why are you interfering
i didnt come here to fight
oh god why cant i make her understand
didnt you say it was my fault
that i introduced her
that if i hadnt left
none of this wouldve happened
so let me fix it then
if i pay it means
i have accepted it was my fault
but he has consented
he wont let us be
he wont anyway
why should i bribe him
think of it as my dower money
if i had to i would beg and borrow
to get your dower money
but i dont have the money
to pay for extortion
our child is going through adolescence
she is suffering
so you understand
the sensitivity of her adolescence
if she was suffering
she wouldnt have stayed
why do you think she stayed
did she choose you
to keep us from separating
she knows i wont go anywhere without her
she is suffering but she doesnt show it
call them now and say i wont pay
until it been proved to me
that i am responsible
ill sell my car
dont sell it for my sake
it not for you
if your child is not worth
why are you talking nonsense
money not the issue
i wont rest till my child safety
is guaranteed
you dont have the right to do anything
understand
if i had done nothing you would be in prison
come to court and get back the bail
i dont want to be out because of it
