and successfully built
one hundred thousand trees
twenty thousand tons of marble

here in xanadu last week
xanadu landlord was laid to rest
a potent figure of our century
america kubla khan
charles foster kane
its humble beginnings
in this ramshackle building a dying daily
kane empire in its glory
held dominion over 37 newspapers
two syndicates
a radio network
an empire upon an empire
the first of grocery stores paper mills
apartment buildings
factories forests ocean liners
an empire through which for 50 years
flowed in an unending stream
the wealth of the earth
third richest gold mine
famed in american legend
is the origin of the kane fortune
how to boarding housekeeper mary kane
by a defaulting boarder in 868
was left the supposedly worthless deed
to an abandoned mineshaft
the colorado lode
fifty-seven years later
before a congressional investigation
walter p thatcher
grand old man of wall street
for years chief target
of kane papers attacks on trusts
recalls a journey he made as a youth
my firm had been appointed trustee
by mrs kane
for a large fortune
she recently acquired
it was her wish that i take charge
of this boy charles foster kane
chief is it not that on this occasion
charles foster kane
personally attacked you after
striking you in the stomach with a sled
i shall read to the committee
a prepared statement
which i have brought with me
and then refuse to answer questions
mr charles foster kane
in every essence of his social beliefs
and by the dangerous manner
he has persistently attacked
american traditions
of private property
initiative and opportunity
for advancement
is in fact nothing more or less
than a communist
that same month in union square
the words charles foster kane
are a menace
to every workingman in this land
he is today what he has always been
a fascist
and still another opinion
kane urged his country entry
into one war
opposed participation in another
swung the election
to one american president at least
spoke for millions of americans
was hated by as many more
for 40 years
appeared in kane newsprint
no public issue
on which kane papers took no stand
no public man whom kane himself
did not support or denounce
often support then denounce
twice married twice divorced
first to a president niece
emily norton who left him in 96
died 98 in a motor accident
with their son
sixteen years after his first marriage
two weeks after his first divorce
kane married susan alexander
singer at the town hall in trenton
new jersey
for wife two one-time opera-singing
susan alexander
kane built
chicago municipal opera house
$3 million
conceived for susan alexander kane
half-finished before she divorced him
the still unfinished
xanadu
no man can say
kane molder of mass opinion
though he was
in all his life
was never granted elective office
by the voters of his country
but kane papers
were once strong indeed
and once the prize seemed almost his
in 96 as independent candidate
for governor
the best elements of the state
behind him
the white house seemingly the next easy
step in a lightning political career
then suddenly less than one week
before election
defeat
shameful ignominious
defeat that set back for 20 years
the cause of reform in the u s
forever canceled political chances
for charles foster kane
then in the first year
of the great depression
a kane paper closes
for kane in four short years collapse
eleven kane papers merged
more sold scrapped
is that correct
dont believe everything you hear
on the radio
read the inquirer
how were business conditions in europe
how did i find business conditions
in europe mr bones
with great difficulty
are you glad to be back
im always glad to be back
im an american
always been an american
anything else
when i was a reporter
we asked them quicker than that
what do you think
of the chances for war in europe
i talked with the responsible leaders
of england france germany and italy
theyre too intelligent
to embark on a project
which would mean
the end of civilization
you can take my word for it
there will be no war
kane helped to change the world
but kane world now is history
and the great yellow journalist himself
lived to be history
outlived his power to make it
alone in his never-finished
already decaying pleasure palace
aloof seldom visited
never photographed
an emperor of newsprint
continued to direct his failing empire
vainly attempted to sway
as he once did
the destinies of a nation
that had ceased to listen to him
ceased to trust him
then last week as it must to all men
death came to charles foster kane
news on the march
that it
hello hello
stand by
ill tell you if we want to run it again
how about it mr rawlston
how do you like it
seventy years in a man life
that a lot to try to get into a newsreel
it a good short
but what it needs is an angle
all we saw on that screen
was that charles foster kane is dead
i know that i read the papers
it isnt enough
to tell us what a man did
youve got to tell us who he was
wait a minute
what were kane last words
do you remember boys
what were the last words
he said on earth
maybe he told us about himself
on his deathbed
maybe he didnt
all we saw was a big american
how did he differ from ford
hearst or john doe
yeah sure
i tell you a man dying words
what were they
you dont read the papers
when charles foster kane died

here a man
who couldve been president
who was as loved hated
and talked about
as any man in our time
but when he dies

to be used by you you may follow me
that all right im just looking for
jennings
thank you jennings
you will be required to leave this room
at 430 promptly

manuscript regarding mr kane

thank you
pages 83 to 42
come on boys
be careful charles
mrs kane
pull your muffler around your neck
charles
mrs kane
i think well have to tell him now
yes ill sign those papers now
mr thatcher
you people seem to forget
that im the boy father
it going to be done exactly the way
ive told mr thatcher
there nothing wrong with colorado
i dont see why we cant raise our son
just because we came into money
if i want to i can go to court
a father has a right to
a boarder that beats his bill
and leaves worthless stock behind
that property is as much my property
as anybody
now that it valuable
and if fred graves had any idea
this would happen hed have made out
the certificates in both our names
but theyre made out to mrs kane
he owed the money to both of us
the bank decision in all matters
i dont hold with giving charles to a bank
stop this nonsense
were a bit uneducated
the bank decision
concerning his education
his places of residence
is to be final
the idea of a bank being the guardian
stop this nonsense jim
we will assume full management
of the colorado lode
which i repeat mrs kane
you are the sole owner
where do i sign mr thatcher
right here
mary im asking you for the last time
youd think i hadnt been
a good husband or father
the sum of $50000 a year
is to be paid to you
and mr kane as long as you both live
and thereafter to the survivor
let hope it all for the best
it is
the union forever
why i cant raise my own boy
is more than i can understand
go on mr thatcher
everything else the principal
as well as all monies earned
is to be administered by the bank in
trust for your son charles foster kane
until he reaches his 25th birthday
at which time
he is to come
into complete possession

i think it would be fun
to run a newspaper
traction trust exposed
traction trust bleeds public white
traction trust smashed by inquirer
landlords refuse to clear slums
inquirerwins slum fight oh
wall street backs copper swindle
copper robbers indicted
galleons of spain off jersey coast

of how to run a newspaper
i dont know how to run a newspaper

you know there not
the slightest proof this
armada off the jersey coast
hello mr bernstein
can you prove it isnt
mr bernstein
id like you to meet mr thatcher
mr leland

i like it myself send it right away
i came to see you
about this campaign of yours
the inquirer campaign against
the public transit company
do you know anything
we can use against them
still the college boy eh
i was expelled from college a lot
of colleges you remember i remember
charles i think i should remind you
of a fact you have forgotten
youre one of the largest stockholders
in the public transit company
the trouble is you dont realize
youre talking to two people
as charles foster kane
who owns 82364 shares
of public transit preferred see
i do have a general idea of my holdings
i sympathize with you
kane is a scoundrel
his paper should be closed
a committee formed to boycott him
if you can form such a committee
put me down for a contribution of $000
on the other hand
i am the publisher of the inquirer
as such it my duty ill let you in on a
little secret it is also my pleasure
to see that the working people of this
community arent robbed by a pack
of money-mad pirates just because
they have no one
to look after their interests
ill let you in on another little secret
mr thatcher
i think im the man to do it
you see i have money and property
if i dont look after the interests
of the underprivileged somebody else will
maybe somebody
without money or property
that would be too bad
i saw your financial statement today
oh did you
tell me honestly
dont you think it rather unwise to
continue this philanthropic enterprise
this inquirer that is costing you
$ million a year
yes i did lose $ million last year
i expect to lose $ million this year
i expect to lose $ million next year
at the rate of $ million a year
ill have to close
this place in 60 years
with respect to the said newspapers
the said charles foster kane
hereby relinquishes
all control thereof
and of the syndicates
pertaining thereto
and any and all other newspaper press
and publishing properties of any kind
and agrees to abandon
all claim thereto
which means were bust all right
well out of cash
all right mr bernstein
ive read it mr thatcher
just let me sign it and go home
youre too old
to call me mr thatcher charles
youre too old to be called
anything else
you were always too old
in consideration thereof
thatcher & company agrees
to pay to charles foster kane
as long as he lives
my allowance
you will continue to maintain
over your newspapers a large
measure of control
measure of control
and we shall seek your advice
this depression is temporary
there always the chance
that youll die richer than i will
it a cinch ill die
richer than i was born
we never lost as much as we made
yes yes but your methods
you know charles
you never made a single investment
you always used money to
to buy things hmm
to buy things
my mother should have chosen
a less reliable banker
i always gagged on that silver spoon
you know mr bernstein
if i hadnt been very rich
i might have been a really great man
dont you think you are
i think i did pretty well
under the circumstances
what would you like to have been
everything you hate
oh
i beg your pardon sir what did you say
it 430 isnt it jennings
yes maam
you have enjoyed a very rare privilege
young man
did you find what you were looking for

what
rosebud and your name is jennings
isnt it
goodbye everybody
thanks for the use of the hall
who a busy man me
im chairman of the board
i got nothing but time
what do you want to know
we thought maybe if we could
find out what he meant by his last words
as he was dying
that rosebud
maybe some girl
there were a lot of them
in the early days
it hardly likely that mr kane
could have met someone casually
and then 50 years later
on his deathbed
well youre pretty young mr thompson
a fellow will remember a lot of things
you wouldnt think hed remember
you take me
one day back in 896 i was crossing
over to jersey on the ferry
and as we pulled out
there was another ferry pulling in
and on it there was a girl
waiting to get off
a white dress she had on
she was carrying a white parasol
i only saw her for one second
she didnt see me at all but ill
bet a month hasnt gone by since
that i havent thought of that girl
who else have you been to see
well i went down to atlantic city
susie
thank you
i called her myself the day after he died
i thought maybe somebody ought to
she couldnt even come to the phone
ill be seeing her again in a couple of days
about rosebud mr bernstein
if youd talk about anything connected
with mr kane that you can remember
you were with him from the beginning
from before the beginning young fellow
and now it after the end
have you tried to see anybody
except susie
i havent seen anybody else but ive
been through walter thatcher journal
that man was the biggest fool i ever met
he made an awful lot of money
well it no trick
to make a lot of money
if all you want
is to make a lot of money
you take mr kane
it wasnt money he wanted
thatcher never did figure him out
sometimes even i couldnt
you know who you ought to see
mr leland
he was mr kane closest friend
they went to school together
harvard
oh harvard yale princeton
cornell switzerland
he was thrown out of a lot of colleges
mr leland never had a nickel
one of those families
where the father is worth $0 million
then one day he shoots himself
and it turns out there nothing but debts
he was with mr kane and me
the first day mr kane took over
the inquirer

social announcement
mr kane on behalf of all the employees
of the inquirer
mr bernstein
thank you very much everybody i
im sorry i cant accept it now
goodbye

hey everybody look out here
let go to the window
mr leland mr bernstein
yes ms townsend
mr and mrs thomas monroe norton
announce the engagement
of their daughter emily monroe norton
to mr charles foster kane
huh
come on
emily monroe norton she the niece
of the president of the united states
president niece
before he through
shell be a president wife
the way things turned out
i dont need to tell you
miss emily norton was no rosebud
it didnt end very well did it
it ended
then there was susie that ended too
you know mr thompson
i was thinking
this rosebud
youre trying to find out about
yes
maybe that was something he lost
mr kane was a man who lost
almost everything he had
you ought to see jed leland
of course he and mr kane
didnt exactly see eye to eye
you take the spanish-american war
i guess mr leland was right
that was mr kane war
we didnt really have anything
to fight about
do you think if it hadnt been for that war
of mr kane
wed have the panama canal
i wish i knew where mr leland was
a lot of the time now
they dont tell me these things
maybe even he dead
in case youd like to know
he at the huntington memorial hospital
on 80th street
you dont say i had
nothing particular the matter with him
they tell me just
just old age
it the only disease that you dont
look forward to being cured of
i can remember absolutely everything
young man
that my curse
that one of the greatest curses
memory
i was his oldest friend and as far as
i was concerned he behaved like a swine
not that charlie was ever brutal
he just did brutal things
maybe i wasnt his friend
but if i wasnt he never had one
maybe i was what you nowadays
call a stooge
you were about to say
something about rosebud
do you happen to have a good cigar
ive got a young physician here
who thinks im going to give up smoking
no im afraid i havent sorry
oh oh ha ha
i changed the subject didnt i
what a disagreeable old man
i have become
youre a reporter and you want to know
what i think about charlie kane
well heh
i suppose he had some private sort
of greatness
but he kept it to himself
he never gave himself away
he never gave anything away
he just left you a tip
hmm heh he had a generous mind
i dont suppose anybody
ever had so many opinions
but he never believed in anything
except charlie kane
he never had a conviction
except charlie kane in his life
i suppose he died without one
that must have been pretty unpleasant
of course a lot of us check out without
having any special convictions about death
but we do know what were leaving
we do believe in something
are you absolutely sure
you havent got a cigar
sorry mr leland
never mind
what do you know about rosebud
rosebud
rosebud
i saw that in the inquirer
i never believed anything
i saw in the inquirer
anything else
i can tell you about emily
i went to dancing school with emily
i was very graceful
we were talking about the first mrs kane
what was she like
she was like all the girls i knew
in dancing school
very nice girl emily was a little nicer
after the first couple of months
she and charlie didnt see much
of each other except at breakfast
it was a marriage
just like any other marriage
youre beautiful
i cant be
yes you are youre very beautiful
ive never been to six parties
in one night before
ive never been up this late
it a matter of habit
what will the servants think
that we enjoyed ourselves
why do you have to go straight off
to the newspaper
you never shouldve married a
newspaperman theyre worse than sailors
i absolutely adore you
charles even newspapermen
have to sleep
ill call mr bernstein and have him
put off my appointments till noon
what time is it
i dont know it late
it early
charles
do you know how long
you kept me waiting last night
when you went to the newspaper
for 0 minutes
what do you do in a newspaper
in the middle of the night
my dear your only correspondent
is the inquirer
sometimes i think id prefer a rival
of flesh and blood
i dont spend that much time
on the newspaper
it isnt just the time
it what you print attacking the president
you mean uncle john
i mean the president of the united states
he still uncle john
and a well-meaning fathead
who letting a pack of high-pressure
crooks run his administration
this whole oil scandal
he happens to be the president not you
that a mistake that will be corrected
one of these days
your mr bernstein sent junior
the most incredible atrocity yesterday
i simply cant have it in the nursery
mr bernstein is apt to pay a visit
to the nursery now and then
does he have to
yes
really charles people will think
what i tell them to think
wasnt he ever in love with her
he married for love
love
that is why he did everything
that why he went into politics
it seems we werent enough
he wanted all the voters to love him too
all he wanted out of life was love
that charlie story how he lost it
you see he just didnt have any to give
he loved charlie kane of course
very dearly
and his mother
i guess he always loved her
how about his second wife
susan alexander
you know what charlie called her
the day after hed met her
he told me about her
he said she was
a cross-section of the american public
i guess he couldnt help it
she must have had something for him
that first night according to charlie
all she had was a toothache
what are you laughing at young lady
ooh
what the matter with you
toothache
what
toothache
toothache
oh oh
you mean youve got a toothache
what funny about that
youre funny mister
youve got dirt on your face
not dirt it mud
do you want some hot water
i live right here
what that young lady
i said if you wanted some hot water
i could get you some
hot water
all right thank you very much
do i look any better now
this medicine doesnt do a bit of good
what you need is to get your mind off it
hey
excuse me but my landlady
prefers me to keep this door open
when i have a gentleman caller
all right
oh
you have got a toothache havent you
i surely have
why dont you try laughing at me again
what
im still pretty funny
i know but you dont want me
to laugh at you
i dont want your tooth to hurt either
ooh
look at me
see that
what are you doing
im wiggling both my ears
at the same time
that it smile
it took me two solid years at the best
boys school in the world to learn that
the fellow who taught me
is now president of venezuela
that it
is it a giraffe
no not a giraffe
i bet it is
what
well then it an elephant
it supposed to be a rooster
a rooster
you know an awful lot of tricks
are you a professional magician
no im not a magician
i was just joking
you really dont know who i am
you told me your name mr kane
but im awfully ignorant
i guess you caught on to that
i bet ive heard your name a million times
you really like me though
even though you dont know who i am
i surely do youve been wonderful
without you i dont know
what i would have done
i had a toothache
and i dont know many people
i know too many people
i guess were both lonely
want to know what i was going to do
before i ruined my best sunday clothes
i bet theyre not your best sunday clothes
you probably have more
i was just joking
i was on my way
to the western manhattan warehouse
in search of my youth
you see my mother died a long time ago
her things were put in storage out west
there wasnt any other place
to put them
i thought id send for them now
tonight i was going to take a look at them
a sort of sentimental journey
i run a couple of newspapers
what do you do
me
mm-hm
how old did you say you were
i didnt say
if you had i wouldnt have asked you
how old
pretty old
how old
twenty-two in august
that a ripe old age what do you do
i work at seligman
im in charge of the sheet music
is that what you want to do
no i wanted to be a singer i guess
that is i didnt my mother did for me
what happened to the singing
mother always thought she always talked
about grand opera for me
imagine
but my voice isnt that kind
it just you know what mothers are like
yes i know
have you got a piano
a piano
mm-hm
yes there one in the parlor

your toothache is bothering you
no that all gone
all right
let go to the parlor
yes lindor shall be mine
i have sworn it
for weal or woe
yes lindor
there is only one man
who can rid the politics
of this state of the evil domination
of boss jim gettys
i am speaking of charles foster kane
the fighting liberal
the friend of the workingman
the next governor of this state
who entered upon this campaign
to point out
and make public the dishonesty
the downright villainy
of boss jim w gettys political machine
now in complete control
of the government of this state
i made no campaign promises
because until a few weeks ago
i had no hope of being elected
now however i have something more
than a hope
jim gettys has something less
than a chance
every straw vote
every independent poll shows
that i will be elected
very well
now i can afford to make some promises
the workingman and the slum child
know they can expect
my best efforts in their interests
the decent ordinary citizens know
that ill do everything in my power
to protect the underprivileged
the underpaid and the underfed
mother is pop governor yet
not yet junior
id make my promises now
if i werent too busy
arranging to keep them
but here one promise ill make
and boss jim gettys knows ill keep it
my first official act
as governor of this state
will be to appoint a special district
attorney to arrange for the indictment
prosecution and conviction
of boss jim w gettys
if the election were held today
youd be in by 00000 votes
gettys isnt even pretending
pop
hello son
he isnt just scared he sick
it beginning to dawn on jim gettys
i mean what i say
did you like your old man speech
i could hear every word
hello emily
hold it
great speech mr kane
wonderful
will you get us a taxi
a taxi why i thought
im sending junior home
in the car with oliver
good night father
goodbye son
emily
why did you send junior home in the car
what are you doing in a taxi
there a call i want you to make
with me
it can wait
no it cant
what this all about emily
it may not be about anything at all
i intend to find out
where are you going
im going to 85 west 74th street
if you wish you may come with me
ill come with you
i had no idea you had this flair
for melodrama emily
come right in mr kane
charlie
he forced me to send your wife that letter
i didnt want to
he been saying the most terrible
mrs kane
i dont suppose
anybody would introduce us
im jim gettys
yes
i made miss alexander send you the note
mrs kane
she didnt want to at first
but she did it
charlie the things he said to me
he threatened to
gettys
i wont wait until im elected
to start with i think ill break your neck
maybe you can do it
and maybe you cant
charles your breaking this man neck
would scarcely explain this note
serious consequences for mr kane
for yourself and for your son
he wanted to get her to come here
what does this note mean
im susan alexander
i know what you think
what does this note mean ms alexander
she dont know
she sent it because i told her
it wouldnt be smart not to
emily this gentleman
im not a gentleman
your husband is only trying to be funny
calling me one
i dont even know what a gentleman is
you see my idea of a gentleman heh
if i owned a paper and didnt like
the way somebody was doing things
some politician
id fight him with all i had
i wouldnt show him in a convict suit
so his children could see
his picture in the paper
youre a cheap crooked grafter
were talking now about what you are
im fighting for my life
not just my political life
he said unless you
that what i said
here the chance im willing to give him
it more of a chance than hed give me
unless he decides by tomorrow that he
so sick he has to go away for a year
monday morning all papers in the state
except his will carry the story ill give
what story
the story about him and ms alexander
there isnt any story
shut up
weve got evidence that would look bad
in the headlines
do you want me
to give you the evidence
id rather he withdrew
without having the story published
not that i care about him
but id be better off that way
so would you mrs kane
what about me
he said my name would be dragged
through the mud that everywhere i went
there seems to be only one decision
you can make charles
id say that itd been made for you
you cant tell me the voters
of this state
im not interested in the voters
of this state right now
i am interested in our son
charlie if they publish this story
they wont
good night mr gettys
are you coming charles
no
im staying here
i can fight this all alone
if you dont listen to reason
it may be too late
too late
for what
for you and this public thief
to take the love of the people
away from me
you got other things to think about
your little boy
you dont want him to read about you
in the papers
there only one person in the world
to decide what ill do and that me
you decided what you were going to do
charles some time ago
youre making a bigger fool of yourself
than i thought
ive got nothing to say to you
youre licked
get out if you want to see me
have the warden write me a letter
if it was anybody else id say what going
to happen to you would be a lesson to you
only youre going to need
more than one lesson
and youll get more than one lesson
dont worry about me gettys
dont worry about me
im charles foster kane
im no cheap crooked politician
trying to save himself
from the consequences of his crimes
gettys im gonna send you to sing sing
sing sing gettys sing sing
have you a car mrs kane
yes thank you
good night
good night
paper read all about it extra extra
paper
no thanks
with a million majority
already against him
and the church counties
still to be heard from
im afraid we got no choice
this one
that one
good night again
is there anything i can
no thanks mr bernstein
you better go home and get some sleep
you too
uh-huh
good night mr kane
hello jedediah
im drunk
if youve got drunk to talk to me about
ms alexander dont bother
im not interested
ive set back the sacred cause of reform
is that it
all right
if that the way they want it
the people have made their choice
it obvious the people
prefer jim gettys to me
you talk about the people
as though you owned them
as though they belong to you
goodness
as long as i can remember youve talked
about giving the people their rights
as if you could make them
a present of liberty
as a reward for services rendered
jed
you remember the workingman
ill get drunk too jedediah
if itll do any good
it wont do any good
besides you never get drunk
you used to write an awful lot
about the workingman
go on home
he turning into something called
organized labor
you wont like that one little bit
when you find out
it means your workingman expects
something as his right and not your gift
when your precious underprivileged
really get together
oh boy
thatll add up to something bigger
than your privilege
then i dont know what youll do
sail away to a desert island probably
and lord it over the monkeys
i wouldnt worry about it too much
therell probably be a few of them there
to tell me when i do something wrong
you may not always be so lucky
youre not very drunk
drunk what do you care
you dont care about anything
except you
you persuade people that you love them
so much that they ought to love you back
only you want love on your own terms
it something to be played your way
according to your rules
let me work on the chicago paper
what
you said you were looking for someone
to do dramatic crimitism criticism
i am drunk
i want to go to chicago
youre too valuable here
there nothing left for me to do
all right you can go to chicago
thank you
i guess id better try to get drunk anyway
i warn you jedediah
you wont like chicago
the wind comes off the lake and theyve
probably never heard of lobster newburg
will saturday after next be all right
anytime you say
thank you
a toast to love on my terms
those are the only terms anybody knows
his own
mr kane im from the inquirer
what that young man
are you through with politics
am i through with politics
i should say vice versa
were going to be an opera star
are you singing at the metropolitan
we certainly are
charlie said if i didnt
hed build me an opera house
that wont be necessary
no no no
places everybody
places please
mr leland is writing it
from the dramatic angle
weve covered it from the news end
and the social
how about the music notice
yes it already made up
mr mowan wrote a swell review
enthusiastic
yes sir
naturally
mr bernstein
mr kane
mr kane this is a surprise
weve got two spreads of pictures
the music notice on the front page
but there still one notice to come
the dramatic
the dramatic notice
mr bernstein that mr leland isnt it
yes were waiting for it
where is he
right in there mr kane
mr kane
mr kane
mr leland and mr kane
havent spoken together for years
you dont suppose
there nothing to suppose
excuse me
close the door
he aint been drinking before
never we would have heard
what does it say there
the notice what he written
miss susan alexander a pretty
but hopelessly incompetent amateur
last night opened
the new chicago opera house
in a performance of
i still cant pronounce that name
her singing happily
is no concern of this department
of her acting
it is absolutely impossible to
go on
go on
that all there is
of her acting it is absolutely
impossible to say anything except
that in the opinion of this reviewer
it represents a new low
in the opinion of this reviewer
i didnt see that
it isnt here mr bernstein
im dictating it
mr kane i
get me a typewriter
im going to finish mr leland notice
hello bernstein
hello
hello mr leland
where my notice bernstein
ive got to finish my notice
mr kane is finishing it for you
charlie
charlie
charlie out there
i guess he fixing it up
i knew id never get that through
mr kane finishing your review
just the way you started it
he writing a bad notice
like you wanted it to be
i guess thatll show you
hello jedediah
hello charlie
i didnt know we were speaking
sure were speaking jedediah
youre fired
everybody knows that story
mr leland but why did he do it
how could a man write a notice
you just dont know charlie
he thought that by finishing that notice
hed show me he was an honest man
he was always
trying to prove something
that whole thing about susie
being an opera singer
that was trying to prove something
you know what the headline was
the day before the election
candidate kane
found in love nest with inger
he was going to take
the quotes off the singer
hey nurse
five years ago he wrote
from that place down there in the south
what it called shangri-la el dorado
sloppy joe what the name
all right xanadu i knew it all the time
you caught on didnt you
im not that hard to see through
well i never even answered his letter
maybe i should have
i guess he was pretty lonely down there
in that coliseum all those years
he hadnt finished it when she left him
he never finished it
he never finished anything
except my notice
of course he built the joint for her
that must have been love
i dont know
he was disappointed in the world
so he built his own an absolute monarchy
it was something bigger
than an opera house anyway
nurse
yes mr leland
im coming
there one thing you can do for me
sure
stop at the cigar store on your way out
and get me a couple of good cigars
be glad to
thank you
one is enough
when i was a young man there was
an impression that nurses were pretty
well it was no truer
then than it is today
ill take your arm
all right
you wont forget about those cigars
i wont
have them wrapped like toothpaste
or theyll stop them at the desk
you know that young doctor
i was telling you about well
he got an idea
he wants to keep me alive
id rather youd just talk
anything that comes into your mind
about yourself and mr kane
you dont want to hear what comes into
my mind about myself and charlie kane
you know maybe i shouldnt have sung
for charlie that first time i met him
but i did an awful lot of singing
after that
i sang for teachers at $00 an hour
the teachers got that i didnt
what did you get
i didnt get a thing except music lessons
that all there was in it
he married you didnt he
he didnt mention anything about marriage
until after it was over and
until it got in the papers about us
and he lost the election
and that norton woman divorced him
he was really interested in my voice
why did he build that opera house
i didnt want it i didnt want a thing
it was his idea
everything was his idea
except my leaving him
dont forget
ta-ta-ta ta-ta-ta ta-ta-ta
dont get nervous
please let come back
look at me mrs kane darling
get the voice out of the throat
place the tone right in the mask
diaphragm
youre out of pitch
some people can sing some cant
impossible impossible
it not your job to give your opinion
of mrs kane talents
youre supposed to train her voice
signor matiste nothing more
please continue with the lesson
but mr kane
please
ill be the laughingstock
of the musical world people will think
youre concerned what people will think
perhaps i can enlighten you a bit
im an authority on what people will think
heh the newspapers for example
i run several newspapers
between here and san francisco
it all right darling
signor matiste is going to listen
to reason
how can i persuade you
you cant
it all right darling go ahead
i thought youd see it my way
no no no
places places

i think it dreadful

in a day or two mr kane
i cant imagine how mrs kane
came to make such a foolish mistake
the sedative dr wagner gave her
was in a somewhat larger bottle
the strain of preparing for the new opera
has excited and confused her

no objections to my staying
with her are there
no not at all
id like the nurse to be here too
good night mr kane
charlie
i couldnt make you see
how i felt charlie
but i couldnt go through
with the singing again
you dont know what it means
to know that people are
that the whole audience
doesnt want you
that when you got to fight them
all right
you wont have to fight them anymore
it their loss
what are you doing
jigsaw puzzles
charlie what time is it
in new york
hmm
i said what time is it in new york

mm-hm
the bulldog just gone to press
well hurray for the bulldog
gee 30 shows are just getting out
people are going to nightclubs
and restaurants
of course were different
because we live in a palace
you always said you wanted
to live in a palace
a person could go crazy in this dump
nobody to talk to
nobody to have any fun with
susan
49000 acres of nothing
but scenery and statues
im lonesome
until yesterday weve had no less
than 50 of your friends at any one time
i think if you look in the west wing
youll find about a dozen vacationists
still in residence
you make a joke out of everything
charlie i want to go to new york
im tired of being a hostess
i want to have fun please charlie
charlie please
our home is here susan
i dont care to visit new york
what are you doing
oh one thing i can never understand
how do you know
you havent done it before
it makes a whole lot more sense
than collecting statues
you may be right
i sometimes wonder
but you get into the habit
it not a habit i do
it because i like it
i thought we might have
a picnic tomorrow
huh
i thought we might have
a picnic tomorrow
invite everybody to spend the night
at the everglades
invite everybody order everybody
you mean and make them sleep in tents
who wants to sleep in tents
when theyve got their own room
with a bath where they know
where everything is
i thought we might have
a picnic tomorrow
you never give me anything
i really care about
it cant be love
for there is no true love
i know ive played at the game
like a moth in a blue flame
lost in the end just the same
all these years
my heart been floating around
in a puddle of tears
mm i wonder what it is
sure you give me things
but that dont mean anything to you
youre in a tent darling
you arent at home
i can hear you very well
if you speak in a normal tone of voice
what the difference between giving me
a bracelet or giving someone $00000
for a statue youll keep crated up
and never look at
it just money it doesnt mean anything
you never really gave me anything
that you care about
i want you to stop this
im not going to stop it
right now
you never gave me anything in your life
you just tried to buy me
into giving you something
susan

i feel kind of sorry for mr kane
dont you think i do
what do you know it morning already
come around and tell me the story
of your life sometime
rosebud
ill tell you about rosebud
how much is it worth to you
a thousand dollars
okay
well ill tell you mr thompson
he acted funny sometimes you know
no i didnt
yes he did crazy things sometimes
ive been working for him  years now
in charge of the whole place
so i ought to know
rosebud
yes
like i tell you the old man
acted kind of funny sometimes
but i knew how to handle him
need a lot of service
yeah but i knew how to handle him
like that time his wife left
rosebud
i see
and that what you know about rosebud
yeah
i heard him say it that other time too
he just said
rosebud
then he dropped the glass ball
and it broke on the floor
he didnt say anything after that
and i knew he was dead
he said all kinds of things
that didnt mean anything
sentimental fellow arent you
hmm
yes and no
that isnt worth $000
you can keep on asking questions
if you want to
were leaving tonight
when were through taking pictures
allow yourself plenty of time
the train stops at the junction on signal
but they dont like to wait
i can remember
when theyd wait all day
if mr kane said so
better get going
take a picture of that
can we come down
yes hurry up were leaving
how much do you think
all this is worth mr thompson
millions
if anybody wants it
well at least he brought all this stuff
to america
what that
another venus
25000 bucks
a lot of money to pay
for a dame without a head
the banks are out of luck
oh i dont know
theyll clear all right
he never threw anything away
welcome home mr kane from 467
employees of the new york inquirer
one stove from the estate of mary kane
$2
were supposed to get everything
junk as well as art
he sure liked to collect things
anything and everything
a regular crow eh
hey look a jigsaw puzzle
we got a lot of those
a burmese temple and three
spanish ceilings down the hall
part of a scotch castle
that needs to be unwrapped
put all this stuff together
the palaces and the paintings
and the toys and everything
what would it spell
charles foster kane
or rosebud
how about it jerry
what rosebud
that what he said when he died
did you ever find out what it means
no i didnt
what did you find out about him
not much really
wed better get started
what have you been doing all this time
playing with a jigsaw puzzle
if youd discovered what rosebud meant
i bet it wouldve explained everything
no i dont think so
no
he was a man who got
everything he wanted and then lost it
maybe rosebud was something
he couldnt get or something he lost
it wouldnt have explained anything
i dont think any word
can explain a man life
no i guess rosebud is just a piece
in a jigsaw puzzle
a missing piece
well
come on everybody
well miss the train
throw that junk in
maybe i was what you nowadays
call a stooge huh
everything was his idea
except my leaving him
ive got his trunk all packed
ive had it packed for a week now
sometimes i think id prefer
a rival of flesh and blood
youre gonna need more than one lesson
and youll get more than one lesson
who a busy man me
im chairman of the board
i got nothing but time
what do you want to know
we thought if we could find out what he
meant by his last words as he was dying
sentimental fellow arent you
hmm
yes and no
i think it would be fun
to run a newspaper
i think it would be fun
انه يكتب اعلان سيء مثل الذي أردته
اعتقد انه سيريك
مرحبا يا جيديداياه
مرحبا يا تشارلي
لم اعلم اننا تكلمنا
نعم نحن نتكلم يا جيديداياه
انت مطرود
كل شخص قد عرف القصة  سيد ليلاند
ولكن لماذا فعلها؟
-كيف يكتب الرجل اعلانا؟
-انت لا تعرف يا تشارلي
لقد اعتقد انه بإنهائه ذلك الاعلان
سيريني انه رجل شريف
انه يحاول دائما ان يثبت شيئا
كل هذا عن سوسي لتكون مغنية اوبرا
لقد كان يحاول اثبات شيء ما
انت تعرف ما كان العنوان الرئيسي
اليوم الذي قبل الانتخابات؟
وجد المرشح كين في عش الحب مع مغنية
لقد كان سيحذف الاقتباسات من المغنية
هي أيتها الممرضة
قبل 5 سنواتقد كتب من ذلك المكانفي الجنوب
بماذا تدعى؟شانغري-لا؟إلدورادو
سلوبي جووز؟ما الاسم؟
حسنازنادولقد عرفتها
فهمتأليس كذلك؟
لم اكن قاسيا لإدراك ذلك
حسناانا حتى بحياتي لم اجب على رسالته
ربما يجب علي
اعتقد انه كان وحيدا هناك في ذلك المدرجكل هذه السنين
لم ينته من ذلك عندما تركتهلم ينهه مطلقا
لم ينهي اي شيء ما عدا إعلاني
-بالطبعلقد بنى البار لها
-ذلك يجب ان يكون الحب
لا ادري
لقد كان محبط في هذا العالم
ذلك قد بنى مملكته الخاصة
لقد كان شيئا اكبر من دار الأوبرا على اية حال
-يا ممرضة
-نعم سيد ليلاند
انا قادم
-يوجد شيء واحد تعمله لي
-اكيد
توقف عند متجر السجار و احضر لي سيجارا جيدا
-انا سعيد لذلك
-شكرا
واحد كافي
عندما كنت شابالقد كان عندي انطباع ان
الممرضات ممتازات
لم يكن الوضع اصدق من اليوم
-سأخذ يدك
-حسنا
-لن تنس السيجار؟
-لن أنس
اجعلها ملفوفة كمعجون الاسنان
و إلا سيوقفون ذلك
كما تعلم ذلك الطبيب الصغير الذي اخبرتك عنه
حسنا
لقد كانت لديه فكرةيريد ان يبقيني على قيد الحياة
اتمنى ان تتكلم عن اي شيء تريدينه
عن نفسك و السيد كين
لا تريد ان تسمع الذي يدور برأسي
عن نفسي و عن تشارلي كين
كما تعلملم يكون من اللازم ان أغني لـ تشارلي
المرة الاولى التي قابلته بها
ولكنني غنيت اغاني سيئة بعد ذلك
لقد كنت اغني للمدرسين بـ 00$ للساعة
-لقد حصلوا على ذلكأليس كذلك؟
-ما الذي حصلتي عليه؟
لم أحصل على شيء ما عدا دروس الموسيقى
هذا كان كل شيء
لقد تزوجكأليس كذلك؟
لم يذكر اي شيء عن الزواج حتى انتهى و
حتى نشروا ذلك في الجرائد
و خسر الانتخابات و طلقته السيدة نوتون
لقد كان مهتما بصوتي
لماذا بنى دار الاوبرا؟
لم اريد ذلكلم اكن اريد شيئالقد كانت فكرته
كل شيء كان فكرته
ما عدا طلاقي
لا تغضبي
ارجوكيدعينا نعود للعمل
انظري إلي سيدة كين يا عزيزتي
انك بعيدة عن درجة النغمة
بعض الناس يغنيو البعض لا يستطيع
مستحيل
ليس من عملك ان تعطي السيدة كين وجهة نظرك
من المفروض ان تدرب صوتها
سيغنور ماتيستي لا اكثر
ارجوكاكمل الدرس
-ولكنسيد كين
-ارجوك
سأكون الاضحوكة في عالم الموسيقىسيفكر الناس بـ
انت متعلق بما يفكر به الناس؟
ربما استطيع ان أنورك قليلا
انا ملم بما سيفكر الناس به
الجرائد على سبيل المثال
لدي جرائد عدة ما بين هنا و سان فرانسيسكو
حسنايا عزيزتي
سيغنور ماتيستي سيسمع السبب
-كيف أقنعك؟
-لا تستطيع
حسنا يا عزيزتيأكملي
اعتقدت انكي تريدينها بطريقتي
لالالا
كم هو فضيع
توقف عن اخباري انه صديقك
الصديق لا يكتب مقالا كهذا
كل هذه الجرائد تغيضنيكما توقعت
ولكن الجريدة تنشر شيئا مثل هذا الذي يعكر
ظهوري الاول في الاوبرا
ادخل
سأدخل
صديقليس من نوع الاصدقاء الذين اعرفهم
ولكنني لست من الطبقة الراقية مثلك
ولم أدرس في حياتي في مدرسة راقية
هذا كافي يا سوسان
من السيد ليلاندسيدي
لقد ارادني ان اعطيك اياها بنفيسي
هل هذه منه؟
تشارلي
بخصوصكيجب ان تفحص نفسك
الارسال له رسالة تقول له انه مطرود
مع 25$ ألف دولار
أي نوع من الطرد تدعو ذلك؟
لقد ارسلت له شيك بـ 25$ ألف دولارأليس كذلك؟
نعم
لقد ارسلت له شيك بمبلغ 25$ الف دولار
ما هذا؟
بيان المبادئ
ماذا؟
ما هذه؟
تحفة اثرية
انت مهرج سيءأليس كذلك؟
سأخبرك شيء واحد لن تكون مسرورا لسماعه
انه غنائي انا
لقد انتهيت
لم أريد فعل هذا في الاول
ستواصلين غنائك يا سوسان
لا اقترح ان تجعليني مسخرة
لا تقترح ان تجعل نفسك مسخرة
ماذا عني؟ انا التي يجب ان تغني
انا التي أصرخ
لماذا لا تتركني لوحدي؟
اسبابي ترضيني يا سوسان
يبدو انك غير قادرة على فهمهن
لن اقولها لكي مرة أخرى
ستواصلين غناؤكي
احضر الدكتور كوري
سوزان
ستكون بخير في يوم او يومين سيد كين
لا استطيع تصور كيف للسيدة كين ان ترتكب
مثل هذه الحماقة
المسكن الذي اعطاها الطبيب واغنر كان
من قارورة كبيرة الى حد ما
ضغوط الاعداد للأوبرا الجديدة جعلتها مهتاجة و مشوشة
نعمانني متـأكد انه كان ذلك
لا اعتراض من بقائي هنا معها؟
لا مطلقا
و اريد ايضا من الممرضة ان تكون هنا
تصبح على خير سيد كين
تشارلي
لم استطع ان اجعلك ان ترى ما احسست به يا تشارلي
ولكن لم استطع الاستمرار في الغناء مرة أخرى
انت لا تعلم ما تعني لتعرف هؤلاء الناس
كل الحضور لا يريدونك
ذلك عندما تحاربهم
حسنا
لن يتوجب عليك محاربتهم مرة أخرى
انها خسارتهم
ماذا تفعلين؟
ألغاز جيغسو
ما الساعة الان يا تشارلي؟
في نيو يورك؟
انا قلت ما الساعة الان في نيو يورك؟
- 30
-ليلا؟
قد باشر الكلب بطباعة الجريدة للتو
حسنامرحاااااا للكلب
30 لقد نهضوا للتو
الناس ذاهبون الى الملاهي الليلية و المطاعم
بالطبعنحن مختلفون لاننا نعيش في قصر
انت دائما تقول انك اردت العيش في قصر
يمكن لشخص ما ان يصبح مجنونا في هذه النفايات
لا يوجد شخص يتكلم لوحده و يحصل على المرح
49ألف فدان من لاشيء فقط تماثيل و مشاهد
انا وحيدة
حتى البارحة كان لديك 50 على الاقل
من اصدقائك في نفس الوقت
اعتقد انك اذا نظرتي الى الجناح الغربي
ربما ستجدين درزن من السواح مازالوا مقيمين
انت تضحك على كل شيء
تشارلياريد ان اذهب الى نيو يورك
انا تعبانة من كوني مضيفة
اريد ان احصل على المرح يا تشارلي
ارجوك
تشارليارجوووك
موطننا هنا يا سوزان
لا اهتم بزيارة نيو يورك
ماذا تفعلين؟
شيء واحد لا استطيع فهمه
كيف تعرفينألم تعملينها من قبل؟
يعني لي الشيء الكثير من الاحاسيس
أكثر من جمع التماثيل
ربما انتي محقة
انا احيانا اتساءل
ولكن تدخل في العادة
انها ليست عادةانا افعل ذلك لانني احب ذلك
اعتقدت ان لدينا كشتة غدا
ادعي اي شخص لقضاء الليلة في إيفرغلادس
ادعو اي واحداطلب اي شخص تقصد
و اجعلهم ينامون في الخيام
من يريد النوم في الخيامعندما
يكون لهم غرفهم الخاصة
مع دورة مياة كما يعرفون كل شيء فيه
اعتقدت ان لدينا كشتة غدا
لم تعطيني شيئا قد اهتممت به
أكيدتعطيني اشياء ولكنها لا تعني شيئا لك
انتي في خيمة يا عزيزتي انتي لست في البيت
استطيع سماعك جيدااذا تكلمت بنبرة صوت عادية
ما الفرق بإعطائي عقدا او اعطاء شخص ما 00$ ألف دولار
لتمثال تحفظه بصندوق و لن نظر له مطلقا
انه مالا فقطلا يعني شيئا
انت لم تعطيني شيئا تهتم به
اريد منك ان تقف عن هذا
لن اتوقف
لم تعطني شيئا في حياتك
انت فقط حاولت ان تشتريني لأعطيك شيئا
مهما فعلتفعلت ذلك لانني احبك
انت لا تحبني
تريدني ان احبك
أكيد انا تشارلز فوستر كين
مهما اردتفقط اذكري اسمه و سيكون لكي
ولكن يجب ان تحبينني
لا تقل لي انك آسف
انا لست اسفا
سيد كين؟
السيدة كين تريد ان تراكسيدي
ماري ترتب حقائبها منذ الصباح
قولي لـ أرنولد أنني جاهزةيا ماري
وقولي له ان يأخذ الحقائب
نعم سيدتي
لقد اصبحتي مجنونة تماما
ألا تعلمين ان ضيوفناالذين سيعلمون عن هذا؟
حزمت امتعتهاارسلت في طلب سيارة
و تركتك؟
بالطبع سيسمعوا
لن اقول الى اللقاء إلا لك
ولكنني لم اتصور ان الناس لم يعلموا
لن ادعكي تذهبين
الى اللقاء يا تشارلي
سوزان
ارجوكيلا تذهبين
ارجوكيسوزان
من الان فصاعداكل شيء سيكون حسب ما تريدينه
ليس الطريقة التي افكر بها تريدينهاولكن
طريقتك
يجب ان لا تذهبين
لن تستطيعي فعل هذا بي
انا افهم
انه انتالتي يفعلونها لك
لم اكن انا مطلقا
ليس ما تعنيه لي
لا استطيع ان افعل هذا لك؟
اوووهنعم استطيع فعل ذلك
في حالة انك لم تسمع لقد خسرت كل اموالي
لقد كانت آخر 0 سنوات صعبة للكثيرين
لم يكونوا خشنين معيلقد خسرت
كل أموالي للتو
-انت ذاهب الان الى زانادو؟
-يوم الاثنينمع الاطفال من المكتب

نحن ننشر مجلة للصور
اذا انت ذكيستتصل مع ريموندانه رئيس الخدم
لقد تعلمت الكثير منه

انت تعرفمثله
انا اشعر بالاسف للسيد كين
هل تعتقد ذلك؟
ماذا تريد ان تعرفانه الصباح الان
تعال و قل لي قصة حياتك
روزبد؟
سأخبرك عن روزبد
كم تستحق؟
$000
حسناسأخبرك سيد تومسون
-لقد كان مرحا بعض الاوقاتكما تعلم
-لا
نعم لقد فعل اشياء مجنونة في زمن ما
لقد عملت له  سنة
رئيس للقصر بأكمله لذلك يجب على ان اعرف
-روزبد
-نعم
كما قلت لكلقد كان الرجل العجوز مرحا في بعض الاوقات
-ولكنني عرفت كيف امسكه
-احتاج الكثير من الخدمات
ولكنني عرفت كيف امسكه
في مثل ذلكالوقت تركته زوجته
روزبد
افهم
وذلك كل ما تعرفه عن روزبد؟
ولقد سمعته في وقت آخرايضا
فقطقال
روزبد
وبعد ذلك اسقط كرة من الزجاج وانكسرت على الارض
لم يقل شيئا بعد ذلكو بعدها عرفت انه مات
لقد قال كل الاشياء التى لا تعني شيئا
زميل عاطفيأليس كذلك؟
-نعم او لا
-ذلك لا ستحق 000$
تستطيع طرح الاسئلة اذا اردت
سنغادر الليلة
عندما ننتهي من نقل الصور
اعط لنفسك الوقت الكافي
يقف القطار عند اعطائه اشارة ولكنه لايحب التوقف
اتذكر عندما انتظر كل اليوم
اذا قال السيد كين ذلك
من الافضل الذهاب
-هل ننزل؟
-نعم اسرع نحن سنغادر
كم من المال يستحق هذا سيد تومسون؟
ملايين
أذا كل واحد يريد ذلك
حسنالقد احضر كل الاشياء في امريكا
-ما هذا؟
-فينوس آخر
$25000
الكثير من المال المدفوع
لإمرأة من دون رأس
ليس للبنوك حظ؟
-خالين الوفاض
-لم يقم برمي اي شيء
اهلا بك في منزلك سيد كين من 467

من المفروض ان نحصل على كل شيء الفن و الخردة
يحب ان يجمع كل شيء بالتأكيد
اي شيء و كل شيء
كغراب منظم  اليس كذلك ؟
-هيييانظروا لغز جيغسو
-لدينا الكثير من هذا
معبد بورماوثلاثة اسقف أسبانية في  البلكونة
جزء من قلعة اسكتلندية
من المفروض ان لا تكون ملفوفة
ضع هذه الاشياء مع بعضها البعض
القصور و الاصباغ و الالعاب و كل شيء
كيف تنطق؟
-تشارلز فوستر كين
-أو روزبد
-ماذا عن ذلك يا جيري؟
-ما هو روزبد
ذلك ما قاله عندما مات
هل بحثت ما تعنيه هذه الكلمة؟
-لا الم افعل
-ما الذي وجده عنه؟
حقيقةليس كثيرا
من الافضل ان نبدأ
ماذا فعلت كل ذلك الوقت؟
اللعب مع لغز جيغسو؟
اذا اكتشفت ما تعنيه روزبد
اراهن على انها ستكشف كل شيء
لالا اعتقد ذلك
لا
لقد كان رجلا قد حصل على كل شيء
أراده بعدها خسر كل شيء
ربما كان روزبد كان شيء ما لم يستطع
الحصول عليه او شيء قد أضاعه
لا أعتقد انها ستشرح كل شيء
لا اعتقد اي كلمة قد تشرح حياة رجل
لاأعتقد ان روزبد هي فقط عبارة عن
لغز جيغسو
قطعة مفقودة
هيا بنا
سنفقد القطار
أرم هذه الخردة
مع تحياتي لكم    ريــمي  اتمنى انكم استمتعتم بوقتكم
كل شيء كان فكرته
ماعدا ان يتركني
كان لدي صندوقه مكتظا بالأشياء
حزمته لمدة إسبوع حتى الآن
أحيانا أعتقد أني أفضل
منافس من لحم ودم
ستحتاج أكثر من درس واحد
و ستحصل على أكثر من درس واحد
لماذا تنشغل بي ؟
أنا رئيس اللوحة
ليس لدي شيئا سوى الوقت
ماذا تريد معرفته ؟
إعتقد أننا    يمكننا أن نكتشف ما يعني
بكلماته الأخيرة التي كان ينطقها وقت موته
زميل عاطفي أليس كذلك؟
نعم  و لا
أعتقد انه سيكون مرحا
