well to begin with any
story of my career
would have to include my
lifelong friend cosmo brown
we were kids together grew
up together worked together
yes
well dora ive had one motto
which ive always lived by
dignity always dignity
this was instilled in me by mum
and dad from the very beginning
they sent me to the finest
schools including dancing school
that where i first met cosmo
and with him i used to perform
for mum and dad society friends
they used to make
such a fuss over me
if i was very good
i was allowed to
accompany mum and
dad to the theatre
they brought me up on shaw
molière the finest
of the classics
to this was added rigorous
musical training
at the conservatory of fine arts
we rounded out our apprenticeship
at an exclusive dramatics academy
and at all times
the motto remained
dignity
always dignity
in a few years we were ready to
embark on a dance concert tour
we played the finest symphonic
halls in the country
fit as a fiddle and
ready for love
i can jump over
the moon up above
fit as a fiddle and
ready for love
havent a worry havent a care
feeling like a feather
that floating on air
fit as a fiddle and
ready for love
soon the church bells
will be ringing
and a march with ma and pa
how the church bells
will be ringing
with a hey-nonny-nonny
and a hot-cha-cha
hi diddle diddle
my baby okay
ask me a riddle
im happy to say
fit as a fiddle and
ready for love
audiences everywhere adored us
get out of here
finally we decided to
come to sunny california
we were stranded we were
staying here resting up
when offers from the movie
studios started pouring in
we sorted them out and decided
to favour monumental pictures

or bring an interpreter

keep away from me just because
youre a big movie star
you expect every girl to faint
at your feet dont touch me

will not molest you
i am but a humble jester and
you you are too far above me

a gorgeous mixture
of all that lies under
the big blue sky
my heart cries
who that she looks familiar
youre a dazzling eyeful
i featured her before in
lots of nightclub shows
ive seen her there
shed be good as zelda sister
that a good idea
excuse me
there may be blondes
and brunettes
that are hard to resist
you surpass them like a queen
youve got those lips that
were meant to be kissed
and youre over sweet 6
beautiful girl what
a gorgeous creature
beautiful girl let
me call a preacher
what can i do
but give my heart to you
a beautiful girl is like
a great work of art
she stylish she chic
and she also is smart
for lounging in her boudoir
this simple plain pyjama
her cloak is trimmed
with monkey fur
to lend a dash of drama
anyone for tennis
well this will
make them cringe
and youll knock
them dead at dinner
if your gown just
drips with fringe
you simply cant be too modest
at the beach or by the pool
and in summertime
it organdy
thatll keep you
fresh and cool
youd never guess
what loud applause
this cunning hat receives
and youd never dream the
things that you could hide
within these sleeves
a string of pearls
with a suit of tweed
it started quite a riot
and if you must wear
fox to the opera
dame fashion says dye it
black is best when
youre in court
the judge will be impressed
but white is right
when youre a bride
and you want to
be well-dressed
beautiful girl
for you ive got a passion
beautiful girl
youre my queen of fashion
im in a whirl
over
my beautiful girl
that stupendous
thanks

in musical pictures
mr simpson thinking about
casting you as zelda sister
that wonderful
hey kathy

memory you may as well know

to be seen with me
you mean lofty star
with humble player
not exactly but for
lunch dont you
tear a pheasant with miss lamont
look kathy all that stuff about
lina and me is sheer publicity
oh certainly seems
more than that
from what ive read in all those
articles in the fan magazines
you read the fan magazines
i pick them up in the beauty
parlour or the dentist office
just like anybody
honest
i buy four or five a month
you buy four or five
to get back to the main point
you achieve a kind of intimacy
in all your pictures
did you say all my pictures
now that i think of it ive
seen eight or nine of them
eight or nine
it seems to me i
remember someone saying
if youve seen one
youve seen them all
i did say some awful things
that night didnt i
no i deserved them
of course i must admit i was
pretty much upset by them
so upset that i
havent been able to
think of anything
but you ever since
honest
honest
well ive been pretty upset too
kathy
kathy look i
kathy seeing you
again now that i
im trying to say something
to you but i
im such a ham
i guess im not able to
without the proper setting
what do you mean
well
come here
this is the proper setting
why it just an empty stage
at first glance yes
but wait a second
a beautiful sunset
mist from the distant mountains
coloured lights in a garden
milady is standing on her balcony
in a rose-trellised bower
flooded with moonlight
we add 500000
kilowatts of stardust
a soft summer breeze
and
you sure look lovely
in the moonlight
now that you have the proper
setting can you say it
ill try
life was a song
you came along
ive laid awake the
whole night through
if i but dared
to think you cared
this is what
id say to you
you were meant for me
and i was meant for you
nature patterned you
and when she was done
you were all the sweet things
rolled up in one
youre like
a plaintive melody
that never lets me free
but im content
the angels must have sent you
and they meant you
just for me
but im content
the angels must have sent you
and they meant you
just for me
now
ta te ti toe too
no no miss lamont
round tones round tones

there no use kidding myself
once they release the
duelling cavalier
lockwood and lamont are through
the picture a museum piece
im a museum piece
things went wrong with the
sound get the technical
no it wasnt that
this is sweet of both
of you but i
something happened to me tonight

about me is true
im no actor
i never was just a
lot of dumb show
i know that now
well at least youre
taking it lying down
no kidding cosmo
did you ever see anything as
idiotic as me on that screen
yeah how about lina

maybe it was a photo
finish im through
youre not through
why of course not
with your looks you could
drive an ice waggon
or shine shoes
block hats
sell pencils
dig ditches
or go back into vaudeville
fit as a fiddle and
ready for love
i could jump over
the moon up above
fit as a fiddle and
ready for love
too bad i didnt do
that in duelling
cavalier they might
have liked it
why dont you
what
make a musical

after duelling cavalier
nobodyd come to see
me jump off the
woolworth building
into a damp rag
turn the duelling
cavalier into a musical
duelling cavalier

theyve got six weeks
before it released

picture from her
she only doing you a favour
in the dancing cavalier

it already done
there a whole publicity
campaign planned
publicity
they cant make a fool out of me
they cant make a laughing
stock out of lina lamont

monumental pictures enthusiastic
over lina singing and dancing
i never said that
premiere tomorrow night to reveal
lina lamont big musical talent

every word printed about me
if i dont like it i can sue

deleterious to my career

to go on doing just that
