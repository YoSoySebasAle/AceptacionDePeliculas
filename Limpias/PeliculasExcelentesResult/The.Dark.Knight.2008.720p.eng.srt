if you got problems
with malfunctioning equipment
i suggest you take them up
with maintenance counselor
ive put every money launderer
in gotham behind bars
but the mob
is still getting its money out
i think you and your friend
have found the last game in town
youre trying to hit them
where it hurts their wallets
it bold
you gonna count me in
in this town the fewer people know
something the safer the operation
i dont like that you got
your own special unit
and it full of cops
i investigated at internal affairs
if i didnt work with cops
youd investigated while at ia
id be working alone
i dont get political points for being an
idealist i do the best i can with what i have
you want me to back warrants
for search and seizure on five banks
without telling me what were after
i can give you the names of the banks
well that a start

a different name for me down at mcu
i wouldnt know about that
in china lau security investments
stands for dynamic new growth
a joint chinese venture with
wayne enterprises will be a powerhouse
well mr lau
i speak for the rest of the board
and mr wayne
in expressing our own excitement
sir i know mr wayne is curious about
how his trust fund gets replenished
but frankly this is embarrassing
you worry about the diligence
mr reese
ill worry about bruce wayne
it done
the numbers are solid
do them again
wouldnt want the trust fund to run out
now would we
another long night
this joint venture was your idea
and the consultants love it
but im not convinced
lau company has grown by
8 percent annually like clockwork
his revenue stream
must be off the books
maybe even illegal
okay cancel the deal
you already knew
just needed a closer look at their books
anything else you can trouble me for
i need a new suit
yeah three buttons
is a little 90s mr wayne
im not talking fashion mr fox
so much as function
you wanna be able to turn your head
sure make backing out
of the driveway easier
ill see what i can do
took three weeks
to get a reservation here
i had to tell them
i work for the government
really
health inspector not afraid to pull strings
rachel fancy that
yeah bruce fancy that
rachel natascha natascha rachel
natascha are you the prima
prima ballerina for the moscow ballet
wow harvey taking me next week
really so youre into ballet
bruce this is harvey dent
the famous bruce wayne
rachel told me everything about you
i certainly hope not
let put a couple tables together
im not sure that theyll let us
oh they should i own the place
how could you want to raise children
in a city like this
well i was raised here i turned out okay
is wayne manor in the city limits
is heh-heh
the palisades sure
you know as our new da you might wanna
figure out where your jurisdiction ends
im talking about the kind of city
that idolizes a masked vigilante
gotham city is proud of an ordinary citizen
standing up for what right
gotham needs heroes like you
elected officials
not a man who thinks he above the law
who appointed the batman
we did all of us who stood by
and let scum take control of our city
but this is a democracy harvey
when their enemies were at the gates
the romans would suspend democracy
and appoint one man to protect the city
it wasnt considered an honor
it was a public service
harvey the last man that they appointed to
protect the republic was named caesar
and he never gave up his power
okay fine
you either die a hero
or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain
whoever the batman is he doesnt
wanna do this for the rest of his life
how could he batman is looking for
someone to take up his mantle
someone like you mr dent
maybe if im up to it
what if harvey dent
is the caped crusader hm
if i were sneaking out every night
someone wouldve noticed by now
well im sold dent
and im gonna throw you a fundraiser
that nice but im not
up for reelection for three years
no you dont understand
one fundraiser with my pals
youll never need another cent
what the hell is this
as youre all aware
one of our deposits was stolen
a relatively small amount 68 million
who stupid enough to steal from us
two-bit wackjob
wears a cheap purple suit and makeup
he not the problem he a nobody
the problem is our money
being tracked by the cops
thanks to mr maroni
well-placed sources
we know that police have indeed
identified our banks using marked bills
and are planning to
seize your funds today
and since the enthusiastic new da has
put all my competitors out of business
im your only option
so what are you proposing
moving all deposits to
one secure location not a bank
where then
no one can know but me
if the police were to gain leverage
over one of you
everyone money would be at stake
what stop them getting to you
i go to hong kong
far from dent jurisdiction
and the chinese will not extradite
one of their own
how soon can you move the money
i already have
for obvious reasons i couldnt wait
for your permission
rest assured your money is safe
and i thought my jokes were bad
give me one reason why i shouldnt
have my boy pull your head off
how about a magic trick
im gonna make this pencil disappear
ta-da
it
it gone
oh and by the way
the suit it wasnt cheap
you ought to know you bought it
sit
i want to hear proposition
let wind the clocks back a year
these cops and lawyers
wouldnt dare cross any of you
i mean what happened
did your balls drop off hm
you see a guy like me
a freak
damn right
a guy like me look listen
i know why you choose
to have your little ahem
group-therapy sessions
in broad daylight
i know why youre afraid
to go out at night
the batman
see batman has shown gotham
your true colors unfortunately
dent he just the beginning
and as for the television
so-called plan
batman has no jurisdiction
hell find him and make him squeal
i know the squealers when i see them
and
what do you propose
it simple we uh kill the batman
if it so simple why havent
you done it already
if youre good at something
never do it for free
how much you want
uh half
youre crazy
no im not
no im not
if we dont deal with this now
soon
little gambol here wont be able
to get a nickel for his grandma
enough from the clown
ah ta-ta-ta let not blow
shit
this out of proportion
you think you can steal from us
and just walk away
yeah
im putting the word out
five hundred grand for this clown dead
a million alive so i can teach him
some manners first
all right so listen
why dont you give me a call
when you wanna start taking things
a little more seriously
here my card
youre a hard man to reach
lau halfway to hong kong
if youd have asked
i could have taken his passport
all that was left in the vaults
were marked bills
they knew we were coming
as soon as your office got involved
my office
youre sitting down there with scum like
wuertz and ramirez and youre talking
oh yeah i almost had your rookie
cold on a racketeering beat
dont try and cloud the fact that clearly
maroni got people in your office dent
we need lau back
but the chinese wont extradite
a national under any circumstances
if i get him to you
can you get him to talk
ill get him to sing
were going after the mob life savings
things will get ugly
i knew the risk when i took this job
lieutenant
how will you get him back any
he does that
our chinese friends left town
before i could tell them the deal was off
well im sure that youve always wanted
to go to hong kong
what wrong with a phone call
i think mr lau deserves
a more personal touch
now for high-altitude jumps youre
going to need oxygen and stabilizers
well i must say
compared to your usual requests
jumping out of an airplane
is pretty straightforward
what about getting back into the plane
id recommend a good travel agent
without it landing
now that more like it mr wayne
the cia had a program back in the 60s
for getting their people out
of hot spots called sky hook
we could look into that
yeah
okay now
hardened kevlar plates over titanium-dipped
tri-weave fibers for flexibility
youll be lighter faster more agile
perhaps you should
read the instructions first
yeah
now there is a tradeoff
separation of the plates makes you
more vulnerable to knives and gunfire
we wouldnt wanna make things
too easy now would we
how will it hold up against dogs
we talking rottweilers or chihuahuas
should do fine against cats
i found one in arizona
a very nice man said he could have it up
and running in a week and he takes cash
what about the flight crew
south korean smugglers
they run flights into pyongyang
below radar
did you think of an alibi
oh yes
i believe this is your plane sir
you look tired alfred
youll be all right without me
if you can tell me the russian for
apply your own bloody suntan lotion
yo gambol somebody here for you
they say theyve just killed the joker
they brought the body
so dead that 500
how about alive hm
you wanna know how i got these scars
my father was
a drinker
and a fiend
and one night
he goes off crazier than usual
mommy gets the kitchen knife
to defend herself
he doesnt like that
not one bit
so me watching
he takes the knife to her
laughing while he does it
he turns to me and he says
why so serious
he comes at me with the knife
why so serious
he sticks the blade in my mouth
let put a smile on that face
and
why so serious
now
our operation is small
but there is a lot of potential
for aggressive expansion
so which of you fine gentlemen
would like to join our team
oh there only one spot open right now
so were gonna have
tryouts
make it fast
welcome to hong kong mr fox
mr lau regrets he is unable
to greet you in person today
i understand
for security purposes im gonna have to
ask you to check in your mobile
of course
i must apologize for leaving gotham
in the middle of our negotiations
this misunderstanding
with the gotham police force
i couldnt let it threaten my company
of course
a businessman of your stature
will understand and
with you here now we can continue
well i do appreciate you bringing me out
here in such style mr lau but i re
we do not allow cell phones in here
im sorry forgot i had it
no i really came to tell you that
our business deal has to be put on hold
you see we cant afford
to be seen to do business with
whatever it is youre accused of being
im sure a businessman of your stature
will understand
i think mr fox a simple phone call
might have sufficed
mr wayne didnt want you to think
he was deliberately wasting your time
just accidentally wasting it
that very good mr lau
accidentally very good
hey sir
there a better view from the peak tram
how the view from lsi holdings
restricted
lau is holed up in there good and tight
what this
i had r&d work it up
sends out a high-frequency pulse
records the response time
for mapping an environment
sonar just like a
submarine mr wayne like a submarine
and the other device
it in place
mr wayne
good luck
look give us the money
and well talk about making a deal
the money is the only reason
im still alive
oh you mean when they find out that
youve helped us theyre gonna kill you
are you threatening my client
no
im just assuming your client
cooperation with this investigation
as will everyone
no okay
enjoy your time in county mr lau
wait
i wont give you the money
but i will give you my clients
all of them
you were a glorified accountant
what could you possibly have
on all of them that we could charge
im good with calculation
i handled all their investments
one big pot
got it
one minute
rico if they pooled their money we can
charge them as one criminal conspiracy
charge them with what
in a rico case if you can charge
one of them with a felony
you can charge all of them with it
that great
mr lau
what kind of details do you have
about this communal fund
ledgers
immunity protection
a chartered plane back to hong kong
after you testify in open court
im just curious
with all your clients locked up
what gonna happen
with all that money
like i said im good with calculation
he cant go to county
ill keep him here in the holding cells
what is this gordon your fortress
well you trust them over at county
i dont trust them here
lau stays
well i dont know about mr lau travel
arrangements but im sure glad he back
put word out we hire the clown
he was right
we have to fix real problem
batman
im not aware of any participation
our boy looks good on the tube
you sure you wanna embarrass me
in front of my friends
oh dont worry theyre coming too
have a nice trip see you next fall
seven hundred twelve counts of extortion
eight hundred and forty-nine
counts of racketeering
two hundred and forty-six counts of fraud
eighty-seven counts of conspiracy murder
five hundred and twenty-seven
counts of obstruction of justice
how do the defendants plead
order in the court
five hundred and forty-nine
criminals at once
how did you convince surrillo
to hear this farce
she shares my enthusiasm for justice
after all she is a judge
even if you blow enough smoke
to get convictions out of surrillo
youre gonna set
a new record at appeals
it wont matter
the head guys make bail sure
but the midlevel guys they cant
they cant afford to be off the streets
theyll cut deals that include some jail time
think of all you could do
with 8 months of clean streets
mr mayor you cant
no get out both of you
sit down
the public likes you
that the only reason that this might fly
but that means it on you
theyre all gonna come after you now
and not just the mob
politicians journalists cops
anyone whose wallet
about to get lighter
are you up to it youd better be
because they get anything on you
and those criminals are back on the
streets followed swiftly by you and me
jesus
i think your fundraiser
will be a great success sir
and why do you think i wanna
hold a party for harvey dent
i assumed it was your usual reason
for socializing beyond myself
and the scum of gotham underbelly
to try to impress miss dawes
very droll but very wrong
actually it dent
police released
video footage found concealed on the body
sensitive viewers be aware
the image is disturbing
tell them your name
brian douglas
and are you the real batman
no
no
no
no
then why do you dress up like him
because he a symbol that we
dont have to be afraid of scum like you
yeah you do brian you really do
huh yeah oh shh shh shh
so you think batman
made gotham a better place hm
look at me
look at me
you see this is how crazy
batman made gotham
you want order in gotham
batman must take off his mask
and turn himself in
oh and every day he doesnt
people will die
starting tonight
im a man of my word
harvey dent
scourge of the underworld
scared stiff by the trust-fund brigade
ill be back
rachel
a little liquid courage mr dent
thank you alfred right
that right sir
rachel talks about you all the time
youve known her her whole life

harvey dent the man of the hour
where rachel dawes
she is my oldest friend come here
when rachel first told me she was dating
harvey dent i had one thing to say
the guy from those god-awful
campaign commercials
i believe in harvey dent
yeah nice slogan harvey
but it caught rachel attention
and then i started to pay attention
to harvey
and all that he been doing
as our new da
and you know what
i believe in harvey dent
i believe that on his watch
gotham can feel
a little safer a
little more optimistic
look at this face this is the face
of gotham bright future
to harvey dent let hear it for him
harvey
harvey may not know you well enough
to understand youre making fun of him
but i do
no i meant every word
you know that day
that you once told me about
when gotham would no longer
need batman
it coming
bruce
you cant ask me to wait for that
it happening now harvey is that hero
he locked up half of the city criminals
and he did it without wearing a mask
gotham needs a hero with a face
you can throw a party wayne
ill give you that
thanks again
you mind if i borrow rachel
lieutenant that joker card pinned to the
body forensics found three sets of dna

take the envelope get in open it
itll tell you where youre headed
you cant leave me alone
with these people
the whole mob after you
and youre worried about these guys
compared to this
the mob doesnt scare me
gordon youre unlikely to discover this
for yourself so
take my word the police commissioner
earns a lot of threats
i found the appropriate response
to these situations a long time ago
them gunning for you
makes you see things clearly
yeah i bet
yeah it makes you think about things
you couldnt stand losing
about who you wanna
spend your life with
that a pretty big commitment
not if the mob has their way
you get to explain to my wife
why im late for dinner

were not intimidated by thugs
you know
you remind me of my father
i hated my father
okay stop
well hello beautiful
you must be harvey squeeze hm
and you are beautiful
you look nervous is it the scars
you wanna know how i got them
come here hey
look at me
so i had a wife
she was beautiful like you
who tells me i worry too much
who tells me i ought to smile more
who gambles and gets in deep
with the sharks hey
one day they carve her face
and we have no money for surgeries
she cant take it
i just wanna see her smile again hm
i just want her to know
that i dont care about the scars
so
i stick a razor in my mouth
and do this
to myself
and you know what
she cant stand the sight of me
she leaves
now i see the funny side
now im always smiling
you got a little fight in you i like that
then youre gonna love me
drop the gun
oh sure you just take off your little mask
and show us all who you really are hm
let her go
very poor choice of words
are you all right
let not do that again
is harvey okay
he safe
thank you
jim it over
as long as they dont get to lau
weve cut off their funds
the prosecution over
nobody standing up in front of a judge
while judges and police commissioners
are getting blown away
what about dent
he got any sense dent halfway to mex
so where do you keep your trash
youre due in court i need you alive
long enough to get you on the record
you cant protect me
you cant even protect yourselves
you refuse to cooperate youre not
coming back here you go to county
how long do you calculate
youll last in there
targeting me wont get their money
i knew the mob wouldnt go down easily
but this is different they crossed a line
you crossed the line first
you squeezed them you hammered them
to the point of desperation
and in their desperation they turned to
a man they didnt fully understand
criminals arent complicated alfred
we just need to figure out
what he after
with respect master wayne
perhaps this is a man
you dont fully understand either
a long time ago i was in burma
and my friends and i were working
for the local government
they were trying to buy
the loyalty of tribal leaders
by bribing them with precious stones
but their caravans were being raided
in a forest north of rangoon by a bandit
so we went looking for the stones
but in six months we never
met anyone who traded with him
one day i saw a child
playing with a ruby
the size of a tangerine
the bandit had been
throwing them away
so why steal them
because he thought it was good sport
because some men arent looking
for anything logical like money
they cant be bought bullied
reasoned or negotiated with
some men just wanna
watch the world burn
your name sir
eighth and orchard
youll find harvey dent there
check the names
richard dent
patrick harvey
harvey dent
i need 0 minutes with the scene
before your men contaminate it
it because of you these guys are dead
detective
give us a minute guys
that brick underneath
gonna take ballistics off a shattered bullet
no
fingerprints
whatever youre gonna do do it fast
because we found his next target
he put it in tomorrow paper
im not sure
you made it loud enough sir
what can i do for you mr reese
you wanted me to do the diligence
on the lsi holdings deal again
well i found some irregularities
their ceo is in police custody
no not with their numbers with yours
applied sciences whole division of wayne
enterprises just disappeared overnight
i went down to the archives
and i started pulling some old files
dont tell me you didnt recognize your baby
pancaking cop cars on the evening news
now you got the entire r&d department
burning through cash
claiming it related to
cell phones for the army
what are you building for him now
a rocket ship
i want
$0 million a year
for the rest of my life
let me get this straight
you think that your client
one of the wealthiest most powerful men
in the world is secretly a vigilante
who spends his nights beating criminals
to a pulp with his bare hands
and your plan
is to blackmail this person
good luck
when
keep that
this is your original scan
here it is reengineered
and there the thumbprint he left
when he pushed the round in the clip
ill get you a copy
mr wayne did you reassign r&d
yeah government
telecommunications project
wasnt aware
we had any government contracts
you know lucius im playing this one
pretty close to the chest
fair enough
with no word from the batman
even as they mourn commissioner loeb
these cops have to wonder if
the joker will make good on his threat
in the obituary column of
the gotham times to kill the mayor
ive checked all the databases
there are four possibles
cross-reference the addresses
look for parkside
overlooking the parade
i got one
melvin white
502 randolph apartments
aggravated assault
moved to arkham twice
what do you got on the roof
were tight but frankly
there a lot of windows up here
commissioner loeb dedicated his life
to law enforcement
and to the protection
of his community
i remember when i first took office
and i asked if he wanted
to stay on as commissioner
and he said he would provided
i kept my politics out of his office
clearly he was not a man who minced
words nor should he have been
a number of policies that he enacted
as commissioner were unpopular
policies that flooded my office
with angry calls and letters
who that
what happened
they took our guns
and our uniforms
and as we recognize the sacrifice
of this man
we must remember that vigilance
is the price of safety
stand by honor guard
attention port arms
ready aim fire
ready aim
ready aim
stay down dont move
mr mayor get him out of here
ill see you later
why are you going back
get out of here
tell me what you know about the joker
no
im sorry barbara
jimmy go play with your sister

friend but harvey trust me
bruce penthouse is now
the safest place in the city
then you go straight there
dont tell anybody
and ill find you there
i love you
i want the joker
from one professional to another
youre trying to scare somebody
pick a better spot
from this height
the fall wouldnt kill me
im counting on it
where is he
i dont know where he is he found us
he must have friends
friends have you met this guy
someone knows where he is
nobody gonna tell you nothing
theyre wise to your act
you got rules
the joker he got no rules
nobody gonna cross him for you
if you want this guy you got one way
but you already know what that is
just take off that mask
let him come find you
or you can let a couple more people
get killed while you make up your mind
you wanna play games
how that feel
you wouldnt
i wouldnt
you dont think i will
you dont think i will
no no i wouldnt
that why im not
gonna leave it up to me
heads you get to keep your head
tails
not so lucky
so you wanna tell me about the joker
let go again
i dont know anything god dont
youre not playing the odds friend
let do it again
youd leave a man life to chance
not exactly
his name schiff thomas
he a paranoid schizophrenic
former patient at arkham
the kind of mind the joker attracts
what do you expect to learn from him
the joker killed gordon
he gonna kill rachel
youre the symbol of hope
i could never be
your stand against organized crime
is the first legitimate ray of light
in gotham in decades
if anyone saw this
everything would be undone
the criminals you arrested
would be released
and jim gordon
will have died for nothing
youre gonna hold
a press conference tomorrow
why
no one else will die because of me
gotham in your hands now
you cant
you cant give in
you cant give in
harvey called
he said batman gonna turn himself in
i have no choice
you honestly think that gonna
keep the joker from killing people
maybe not but i have enough blood
on my hands
and ive seen now what i would
have to become to stop men like him
you once told me that
if the day came when i was finished
that wed be together
bruce dont make me
your one hope for a normal life
did you mean it
yes
bruce
if you turn yourself in
theyre not gonna let us be together
logs as well
everything
anything that could lead back
to lucius or rachel
people are dying alfred
what would you have me do
endure master wayne take it
theyll hate you for it
but that the point of batman
he can be the outcast he can make
the choice that no one else can make
the right choice
no today i found out
what batman cant do
he cant endure this
today you get to say i told you so
today i dont want to
but i did bloody tell you
i suppose theyre gonna
lock me up as well
as your accomplice
accomplice im gonna tell them
the whole thing was your idea
ladies and gentlemen ive called
this press conference for two reasons
firstly to assure the citizens
of gotham
that everything that can be done
over the joker killings is being done
secondly because the batman
has offered to turn himself in
but let consider the situation
should we give in
to this terrorist demands
do we really think he gonna
youd rather protect an outlaw vigilante
than the lives of citizens
the batman is an outlaw
that not why we demand he turn himself
in were doing it because were scared
weve been happy to let batman
clean up our streets till now
things are worse than ever
amen
yes they are
but the night is darkest
just before the dawn
and i promise you
the dawn is coming
one day the batman will have to answer
for the laws he broken but to us
not to this madman
no more dead cops
yeah
he should turn himself in
give us the batman come on
where is he
so be it take the batman into custody
what
is he here
i am the batman
what
come on
alfred
why is he letting harvey do this
he went down to the press conference
i know he just stood by
perhaps both bruce and mr dent
believe that batman stands for
something more important
than the whims of a terrorist
miss dawes
even if everyone hates him for it
that the sacrifice he making
he not being a hero
he being something more
yeah youre absolutely right
letting harvey take the fall for this
is not heroic at all
you know him better than anyone
i do
will you give this to him for me
when the time is right
how will i know
it not sealed
goodbye alfred
bye rachel
i didnt have time to talk this through
what are you doing
theyre transferring me to central holding
this is the joker chance and when he
attacks the batman will take him down
listen this is too dangerous
we get this guy to county he their
problem the streets will be cleared
so let go
the convoys stop for no reason
i hope you got some moves pal
he using you as bait he doesnt know if
he can get the joker he failed so far
how do you know what he thinking
i just do anyway this isnt just about you
what about the people depending on you to
clean the city up and do it honorably and
harvey tell everyone the truth
heads i go through with it
this is your life you cant
leave something like that to chance
im not
you make your own luck
hey you wait like everybody else pal

to control things really are
so when i say ah come here
when i say that you and your girlfriend
was nothing personal
youll know that im telling the truth
im gonna need your weapon
what
why because my wife in the hospital
yeah thatd be why
it the schemers
that put you where you are
you were a schemer you had plans
and look where that got you
police are taking every precaution
urging people not to
take matters into their hands
i just did what i do best
i took your little plan
and i turned it on itself
look what i did to this city with
a few drums of gas and a couple of bullets
hm you know what i noticed
nobody panics when
things go according to plan
even if the plan is horrifying
if tomorrow i tell the press that like
a gangbanger will get shot
or a truckload of soldiers
will be blowing up
nobody panics
because it all part of the plan
but when i say that
one little old mayor will die
well then everyone loses their minds
introduce a little anarchy
upset the established order
and everything becomes chaos
im an agent of chaos
oh and you know the thing
about chaos
it fair
you live
you die
now were talking
mr reese
that mr wayne isnt it

youve turned every cell phone in gotham
into a microphone
and a high-frequency generator-receiver
you took my sonar concept
and applied it to every phone in the city
with half the city feeding you sonar
you can image all of gotham
this is wrong
ive gotta find this man lucius
at what cost
the database is null-key encrypted
it can only be accessed by one person
this is too much power for one person
that why i gave it to you
only you can use it
spying on 30 million people
isnt part of my job description
this is an audio sample if he talks
within range of any phone in the city
you can triangulate his position
ill help you this one time
but consider this my resignation
as long as this machine is
at wayne enterprises i wont be
when youre finished
type in your name
my officers are going over
every inch of the tunnels and bridges
but with the joker threat
theyre not an option
and land routes east
backed up for hours
which leaves the ferries
with 30000 ready to board
i wanna use the ferries so i can
get those prisoners off the island
the men you put away
those arent people im worried about
you should be
whatever the joker planning
it a good bet harvey prisoners are
involved i wanna get them out of here

like this
the joker just a mad dog
i want whoever let him off the leash
i took care of wuertz but who was
your other man inside gordon unit

decide quickly
because the people on the other boat
may not be quite so noble
stay back
well now who are you to decide
we ought to talk this over at least
we dont all have to die
those men had their chance

what were you trying to prove
that deep down
everyone as ugly as you
youre alone
cant rely on anyone these days
you gotta do everything yourself dont we
that okay i came prepared
it a funny world we live in speaking of
which you know how i got these scars
no but i know how you got these
oh you
you just couldnt let me go could you
this is what happens
when an unstoppable force
meets an immovable object
you truly are incorruptible arent you
huh you wont kill me
out of some misplaced sense
of self-righteousness
and i wont kill you
because youre just too much fun
i think you and i are destined
to do this forever
youll be in a padded cell forever
maybe we could share one
you know theyll be doubling up the rate this
city inhabitants are losing their minds
this city just showed you
that it full of people
ready to believe in good
until their spirit breaks completely
until they get a good look
at the real harvey dent
and all the heroic things he done
you didnt think id risk losing the battle
for gotham soul
in a fistfight with you
no
you need an ace in the hole
mine harvey
what did you do
i took gotham white knight
and i brought him down to our level
it wasnt hard
see madness as you know
is like gravity
all it takes is a little push
dent
this is where they brought her
gordon after your men handed her over
this is where she died
i know i was here
trying to save her
but you didnt
i couldnt
yes you couldve if youd listened to me
if you stood up against corruption
instead of doing your deal
with the devil
i was trying to fight the mob
you wouldnt dare try to justify yourself
if you knew what id lost
have you ever had to talk to the person
you loved most
tell them it gonna be all right
when you know it not
well youre about to know
what that feels like gordon
then you can look me in the eye
and tell me youre sorry
youre not going to hurt my family
no
just the person you love most
so is it your wife
put the gun down harvey
harvey put down the gun
please please harvey please
oh goddamn it
will you stop pointing that gun
at my family
no
we have a winner
no jim stop him
harvey
dont let him
harvey
im sorry
for everything
please dont hurt my son
you brought your cops
all they know is there a situation
they dont know who or what
theyre just creating a perimeter
you think i wanna escape from this
there is no escape from this
you dont wanna hurt the boy harvey
it not about what i want
it about what fair
you thought we could be decent men
in an indecent time
but you were wrong
the world is cruel and the only morality
in a cruel world
is chance
unbiased
unprejudiced
fair
his son got the same chance she had
fifty-fifty
what happened to rachel wasnt chance
we decided to act
we three
then why was it me who was
the only one who lost everything
it wasnt
the joker chose me
because you were the best of us
he wanted to prove that
even someone as good as you
could fall
and he was right
youre the one pointing the gun harvey
so point it at the people responsible
fair enough
you first
my turn
harvey youre right
rachel death was my fault
please dont punish the boy
please punish me
im about to
tell your boy
he gonna be all right gordon
lie
like i lied
it going to be all right son
dad daddy is he okay
thank you
you dont have to thank me
yes i do
the joker won
harvey prosecution
everything he fought for
undone
whatever chance you gave us at fixing
our city dies with harvey reputation
we bet it all on him
the joker took the best of us
and tore him down
people will lose hope
they wont
they must never know what he did
five dead
two of them cops you cant sweep that
no
but the joker cannot win
gotham needs its true hero
no
you either die a hero
or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain
i can do those things
because im not a hero not like dent
i killed those people
that what i can be
no no you cant youre not
im whatever gotham needs me to be
call it in
a hero
not the hero we deserved
but the hero we needed
nothing less than a knight
shining
theyll hunt you
youll hunt me
youll condemn me
set the dogs on me
because that what needs to happen
because sometimes
the truth isnt good enough
sometimes people deserve more
sometimes people deserve
to have their faith rewarded
batman
batman
why he running dad
because we have to chase him
okay were going in go go move
he didnt do anything wrong
because he the hero gotham deserves
but not the one it needs right now
so well hunt him
because he can take it
because he not a hero
he a silent guardian
a watchful protector
a dark knight
