aboard the axiom
as always the weather is a balmy
72 degrees and sunny and
i see the ship log is showing
that today is our 700th anniversary
of our five-year cruise
well im sure our forefathers would
be proud to know that 700 years later
wed be doing the exact same thing
they were doing

so be sure next mealtime

hey auto what that flashing button
captain probe one
has returned positive
positive
eve
but no probe
ever come back positive before
buy n large
greetings and congratulations
captain
if you are seeing this
that means your
extraterrestrial vegetation evaluator
or eve probe has returned from earth
with a confirmed specimen
of ongoing photosynthesis
that right it means it time
to go back home
home were going back
now that earth has been restored
to a life-sustaining status
by golly
we can begin operation re-colonize
simply follow
this manual instructions
to place the plant
in your ship holo-detector
and the axiom will immediately
navigate your return to earth
it that easy
now due to the effects of microgravity
you and your passengers
may have suffered some
slight bone loss
but im sure a few laps
around the ship jogging track
will get you back in shape in no time
we have a jogging track
if you have any further questions
just consult your operation manual
see you back home real soon

well send the seeds
out in the breeze

youve got a lot on your chest
well you can come as my guest

we hear the birds sing in the trees

well send the seeds
out in the breeze
like the fish in the ocean
we felt at home in the sea
we learned to live off the good land
we learned to climb up a tree
then we got up on two legs
but we wanted to fly
and when we messed up
our homeland
we set sail for the sky
were coming down to the ground
there no better place to go
we got snow up on the mountains
we got rivers down below
were coming down to the ground
we hear the birds sing in the trees
and the land will be looked after
well send the seeds
out in the breeze
were coming down
coming down to earth
like babies at birth
coming down to earth
we define new priorities
these are extraordinary qualities
were coming down to the ground
there no better place to go
