the salted pork is particularly good

treebeard groaning
treebeard
young master gandalf
im glad youve come
wood and water stock and stone
i can master
but there is a wizard to manage here
locked in his tower
show yourself
be careful
even in defeat saruman is dangerous
well let just have his head
and be done with it
no
we need him alive
we need him to talk
saruman you have fought many wars
and slain many men théoden king
and made peace afterwards
can we not take counsel together
as we once did my old friend
can we not have peace you and i
we shall have peace
we shall have peace
when you answer
for the burning of the westfold
and the children that lie dead there
we shall have peace
when the lives of the soldiers
whose bodies were hewn
even as they lay dead
against the gates of the hornburg
are avenged
when you hang from a gibbet
for the sport of your own crows
we shall have peace
gibbets and crows
dotard
what do you want gandalf greyhame
let me guess the key of orthanc
or perhaps the keys of barad-dûr itself
along with the crowns of the seven kings
and the rods of the five wizards
your treachery has already cost
many lives
thousands more are now at risk
but you could save them saruman
you were deep in the enemy counsel
so you have come here for information
i have some for you
something festers
in the heart of middle-earth
something that you have failed to see
but the great eye has seen it
even now he presses his advantage
his attack will come soon
youre all going to die
but you know this dont you gandalf
you cannot think that this ranger
will ever sit upon the throne of gondor
this exile crept from the shadows
will never be crowned king
gandalf does not hesitate
to sacrifice those closest to him
those he professes to love
tell me what words of comfort
did you give the halfling
before you sent him to his doom
sighs
the path that you have set him on
can only lead to death
ive heard enough
shoot him
stick an arrow in his gob
gandalf
no
come down saruman
and your life will be spared
save your pity and your mercy
i have no use for it
gandalf
saruman
your staff is broken
gasps
gríma you need not follow him
you were not always as you are now
you were once a man of rohan
come down
a man of rohan
what is the house of rohan
but a thatched barn
where brigands drink in the reek
and their brats roll on the floor
with the dogs
the victory at helm deep does not
belong to you théoden horse-master
you are a lesser son of greater sires
gríma
come down
be free of him
free he will never be free
no
get down cur
grunts
saruman
you were deep in the enemy counsel
tell us what you know
you withdraw your guard and i will tell you
where your doom will be decided
i will not be held prisoner here
gasps
grunts
panting
send word to all our allies
and to every corner of middle-earth
that still stands free
the enemy moves against us
we need to know where he will strike
creaking
the filth of saruman
is washing away
trees will come back to live here
young trees
wild trees
pippin
bless my bark
gandalf
peregrin took

merry & pippin singing
oh you can search far and wide
you can drink the whole town dry
but youll never find a beer so brown
but youll never find a beer so brown
as the one we drink in our hometown
as the one we drink in our hometown
you can drink your fancy ales
you can drink em by the flagon
but the only brew for the brave and true
pippin
merry & pippin singing

thank you i win
no news of frodo
no word nothing
we have time
every day frodo moves closer to mordor
do we know that
what does your heart tell you
that frodo is alive
yes
yes he alive
gollum
too risky too risky
thieves
they stole it from us
kill them kill them kill them both
yells
shh quiet mustnt wake them
mustnt ruin it now
but they knows
they knows
they suspects us
what it saying my precious my love
is sméagol losing his nerve
no not
never sméagol hates nasty hobbitses
sméagol wants to see them dead
and we will
sméagol did it once
he can do it again
it ours
ours
we must get the precious
we must get it back
patience patience my love
first we must lead them to her
we lead them to the winding stair
yes the stairs and then
up up up up
up the stairs we go
until we come to the tunnel
and when they go in
there no coming out
she always hungry
she always needs to feed
she must eat
all she gets is filthy orcses
and they doesnt taste very nice
does they precious
no
not very nice at all my love
she hungers for sweeter meats
hobbit meat
and when she throws away the bones
and the empty clothes
then we will find it
and take it for me
for us
yes we meant for us
gollum gollum
the precious will be ours
once the hobbitses are dead
you treacherous little toad
gollum yelling
no no master
no sam leave him alone
i heard it from his own mouth
he means to murder us
never sméagol wouldnt hurt a fly
yells
he a horrid fat hobbit
who hates sméagol
and who makes up nasty lies
you miserable little maggot
ill stove your head in
sam
sam
call me a liar youre a liar
yells
you scare him off were lost
i dont care i cant do it mr frodo
i wont wait around for him to kill us
im not sending him away
sam
you dont see it do you
he a villain
we cant do this by ourselves sam
not without a guide
i need you on my side
im on your side mr frodo
i know sam i know
trust me
come sméagol
snoring
what time is it
not yet dawn
i dreamed i saw a great wave
climbing over green lands
and above the hills
i stood upon the brink
it was utterly dark in the abyss
before my feet
a light shone behind me
but i could not turn
i could only stand there waiting
night changes many thoughts
sleep éowyn
sleep
while you can
the stars are veiled
something stirs in the east
a sleepless malice
the eye of the enemy is moving
merry
what are you doing
snoring lightly
merry whispering
pippin
pippin
mutters indistinctly
pippin
what are you mad
i just want to look at it
just one more time
merry
put it back
pippin
growling
no
rumbling
whimpering
in normal voice
pippin
eerie breathing
he is here
sauron
i see you
pippin
sauron speaking
in black speech
grunting and gasping
merry
help gandalf help
someone help him
pippin
fool of a took
whispers indistinctly
gasping
look at me
gandalf forgive me
gandalf
look at me
what did you see
a tree
there was a white tree
in a courtyard of stone
it was dead
the city was burning
minas tirith is that what you saw
i saw
i saw him
i could hear his voice in my head
and what did you tell him
speak
he asked me my name
i didnt answer
he hurt me
what did you tell him
about frodo and the ring
there was no lie in pippin eyes
a fool
but an honest fool he remains
he told sauron nothing
of frodo and the ring
weve been strangely fortunate
pippin saw in the palantír
a glimpse of the enemy plan
sauron moves to strike
the city of minas tirith
his defeat at helm deep
showed our enemy one thing
he knows the heir of elendil
has come forth
men are not as weak as he supposed
there is courage still strength
enough perhaps to challenge him
sauron fears this
he will not risk the peoples of
middle-earth uniting under one banner
he will raze minas tirith
to the ground
before he sees a king
return to the throne of men
if the beacons of gondor are lit
rohan must be ready for war
tell me
why should we ride to the aid
of those who did not come to ours
what do we owe gondor
i will go
no
they must be warned
they will be
you must come to minas tirith
by another road
follow the river
look to the black ships
understand this
things are now in motion
that cannot be undone
i ride for minas tirith
and i wont be going alone
of all the inquisitive hobbits
peregrin took you are the worst
hurry hurry
where are we going
why did you look
why do you always have to look
i dont know i cant help it
you never can
im sorry all right
i wont do it again
dont you understand
the enemy thinks you have the ring
he going to be looking for you pip
they have to get you out of here
and you youre coming with me
merry
come on
how far is minas tirith
three days ride as the nazgûl flies
and you better hope we dont have
one of those on our tail
here
something for the road
the last of the longbottom leaf
i know youve run out
you smoke too much pippin
but but well see each other soon
wont we
i dont know
tearfully
i dont know what going to happen
merry
run shadowfax
show us the meaning of haste
merry
merry
he always followed me
everywhere i went
since before we were tweens
i would get him into
the worst sort of trouble
but i was always there to get him out
now he gone
just like frodo and sam
one thing i have learned about hobbits
theyre a most hardy folk
foolhardy maybe he a took
elrond
take her by the safest road
a ship lies anchored
in the grey havens
it waits to carry her across the sea
the last journey of arwen undómiel
wind whistling
there is nothing for you here
only death
elf escort
lady arwen
we cannot delay
my lady
arwen tell me what you have seen
elrond arwen
arwen
you have the gift of foresight
what did you see
i looked into your future
and i saw death
but there is also life
you saw there was a child
you saw my son
elrond
that future is almost gone
but it is not lost
nothing is certain
some things are certain
if i leave him now
i will regret it forever
it is time
arwen
from the ashes a fire shall be woken
a light from the shadow shall spring
renewed shall be blade that was broken
screams
the crownless again shall be king
re-forge the sword
speaks in elvish
father
{\an8}<font color=#008000>ada
<font color=#ffff00>dad
elrond
your hands are cold
the life of the eldar is leaving you
this was my choice
speaks in elvish
father
{\an8}<font color=#008000>ada
<font color=#ffff00>dad
whether by your will or not
there is no ship now
that can bear me hence
weve just passed
into the realm of gondor
minas tirith
city of kings
make way
it the tree
gandalf gandalf
gandalf
yes the white tree of gondor
the tree of the king
lord denethor however
is not king
he is a steward only
a caretaker of the throne
now listen carefully
lord denethor is boromir father
to give him news of his beloved son
death would be most unwise
and do not mention frodo or the ring
and say nothing of aragorn either
in fact it better if you
dont speak at all peregrin took
hail denethor son of ecthelion
lord and steward of gondor
i come with tidings in this dark hour
and with counsel
perhaps you come to explain this
perhaps you come to tell me
why my son is dead
arrows whistling
screams
arrow impacts
grunts
boromir died to save us
my kinsman and me
he fell defending us from many foes
pippin
i offer you my service such as it is
in payment of this debt
this is my first command to you
how did you escape
and my son did not
so mighty a man as he was
the mightiest man
may be slain by one arrow
and boromir was pierced by many
get up
my lord there will be a time
to grieve for boromir
but it is not now
war is coming
the enemy is on your doorstep
as steward you are charged
with the defense of this city
where are gondor armies
you still have friends
you are not alone in this fight
send word to théoden of rohan
light the beacons
you think you are wise mithrandir
yet for all your subtleties
you have not wisdom
do you think the eyes
of the white tower are blind
i have seen more than you know
with your left hand you would use me
as a shield against mordor
and with your right
youd seek to supplant me
i know who rides with théoden of rohan
oh yes word has reached my ears
of this aragorn son of arathorn
and i tell you now i will not bow
to this ranger from the north
last of a ragged house
long bereft of lordship
authority is not given to you
to deny the return of the king steward
the rule of gondor is mine
and no other
gandalf
come
all has turned to vain ambition
he would even use his grief
as a cloak
a thousand years
this city has stood
now at the whim of a madman
it will fall
and the white tree
the tree of the king
will never bloom again
pippin
why are they still guarding it
gandalf
they guard it because they have hope
a faint and fading hope
that one day it will flower
that a king will come
and this city will be as it once was
before it fell into decay
the old wisdom borne out
of the west was forsaken
kings made tombs more splendid
than the houses of the living
and counted the old names
of their descent
dearer than the names of their sons
childless lords sat in aged halls
musing on heraldry
or in high cold towers
asking questions of the stars
and so the people of gondor
fell into ruin
the line of kings failed
the white tree withered
the rule of gondor was given over
to lesser men
mordor
yes there it lies
this city has dwelt ever
in the sight of its shadow
thunder rolling
a storm is coming
this is not the weather of the world
this is a device of sauron making
a broil of fume
he sends ahead of his host
the orcs of mordor
have no love of daylight
so he covers the face of the sun
to ease their passage
along the road to war
when the shadow of mordor
reaches this city
it will begin
well
minas tirith
very impressive
so where are we off to next
oh it too late for that peregrin
there no leaving this city
help must come to us
sam
it must be getting near teatime
leastways it would be in decent places
where there is still teatime
were not in decent places
mr frodo
what is it
it just a feeling
i dont think ill be coming back
yes you will of course you will
that just morbid thinking
were going there and back again
just like mr bilbo
youll see
frodo i think these lands
were once part of the kingdom of gondor
long ago when there was a king
mr frodo look
the king has got a crown again
come on hobbits
mustnt stop now this way
thunder rumbling in distance
coughing
so i imagine this is just
a ceremonial position
i mean they dont actually expect me
to do any fighting
do they
youre in the service of the steward now
youll have to do as youre told
peregrin took
ridiculous hobbit
guard of the citadel
grunts
thank you
there no more stars
is it time
yes
it so quiet
it the deep breath before the plunge
i dont want to be in a battle
but waiting on the edge of one
i cant escape is even worse
is there any hope gandalf
for frodo and sam
gandalf
there never was much hope
just a fool hope
our enemy is ready
his full strength gathered
not only orcs but men as well
legions of haradrim from the south
mercenaries from the coast
all will answer mordor call
man
come on
this will be the end of gondor
as we know it
here the hammer stroke will fall hardest
if the river is taken
if the garrison at osgiliath falls
the last defense of this city
will be gone
but we have the white wizard
that got to count for something
gandalf
gandalf sauron has yet to reveal
his deadliest servant
the one who will lead
mordor armies in war
the one they say no living man can kill
the witch-king of angmar
youve met him before
he stabbed frodo on weathertop
screams
he is the lord of the nazgûl
the greatest of the nine
minas morgul is his lair
gollum
the dead city
very nasty place full of enemies
quick quick
they will see they will see
come away come away
look we have found it
the way into mordor
the secret stair
climb
frodo breathing heavily
voices whispering indistinctly
no mr frodo
not that way
gollum yells
gollum what it doing
no
theyre calling me
gollum no
rumbling
gollum screaming
gollum
hide hide
grunts
thunder rolling
roars
witch-king screeching
i can feel his blade
we come to it at last
the great battle of our time
fell beast roars
witch-king screeches
come away hobbits
we climb we must climb
the board is set
the pieces are moving
up up up the stairs we go
and then it into the tunnel
hey what in this tunnel
you listen to me
and you listen good and proper
anything happens to him
you have me to answer to
one sniff something not right
one hair stands up
on the back of my head it over
no more slinker no more stinker
youre gone got it
im watching you
what was that about
nothing just clearing something up
peregrin took my lad
there is a task now to be done
another opportunity for one
of the shire-folk to prove their great worth
you must not fail me
madril
it been very quiet across the river
the orcs are lying low
the garrison may have moved out
weve sent scouts to cair andros
if the orcs attack from the north
well have some warning
oar splashes
quiet
soldier
we need 0 more
soldiers speaking
indistinctly

theyre not coming from the north
to the river quick quick
go come on

yelling
faramir
hold hold them

even to death
you have given us hope
merry
excuse me
i have a sword
please accept it
i offer you my service théoden king
and gladly i accept it
you shall be meriadoc
esquire of rohan
horse-men
i wish i could muster a legion of dwarves
fully armed and filthy
your kinsmen may have no need
to ride to war
i fear war already marches
on their own lands
théoden so it is before the walls
of minas tirith
the doom of our time will be decided
now is the hour
riders of rohan oaths you have taken
now fulfill them all
to lord and land hyah
faramir

they broke through our defenses
theyve taken the bridge
and the west bank
battalions of orcs are crossing the river
iorlas
it is as the lord denethor predicted
long has he foreseen this doom
foreseen and done nothing
faramir
this is not the first halfling
to have crossed your path
no
youve seen frodo and sam
where when
in ithilien
not two days ago
gandalf theyre taking the road
to the morgul vale
and then the pass of cirith ungol
what does that mean
what wrong
faramir tell me everything
tell me all you know
this is how you would serve your city
you would risk its utter ruin
i did what i judged to be right
what you judged to be right
you sent the ring of power into mordor
in the hands of a witless halfling
it should have been brought back
to the citadel to be kept safe
hidden
dark and deep in the vaults
not to be used
unless at the uttermost end of need
i would not use the ring
not if minas tirith were falling in ruin
and i alone could save her
ever you desire to appear lordly
and gracious
as a king of old
boromir would have remembered
his father need
he would have brought me a kingly gift
boromir would not
have brought the ring
he would have stretched out his hand to
this thing and taken it he wouldve fallen
you know nothing of this matter
he would have kept it for his own
and when he returned
you would not have known your son
boromir was loyal to me
not some wizard pupil
whimpers
father
my son
leave me
grunts
gollum
careful master careful
very far to fall
very dangerous are the stairs
come master
come to sméagol
sam
mr frodo
get back you
dont touch him
why does he hates poor sméagol
what has sméagol ever done to him
master
panting
master carries heavy burden
sméagol knows
heavy heavy burden
fat one cannot know
sméagol look after master
he wants it
he needs it
sméagol sees it in his eye
very soon he will ask you for it
you will see
the fat one will take it from you
witch-king
send forth all legions
do not stop the attack
until the city is taken
slay them all
what of the wizard
witch-king i will break him
guard
where are théoden riders
will rohan army come
mithrandir
courage is the best defense
that you have now
pippin
what were you thinking peregrin took
what service can a hobbit
offer such a great lord of men
faramir
it was well-done
a generous deed should not
be checked with cold counsel
you are to join the tower guard
i didnt think they would find any livery
that would fit me
once belonged to a young boy
of the city
a very foolish one
who wasted many hours slaying dragons
instead of attending to his studies
this was yours
yes it was mine
my father had it made for me
well
im taller than you were then
though im not likely to grow anymore
except sideways
laughing
never fitted me either
boromir was always the soldier
they were so alike he and my father
proud
stubborn even
but strong
i think you have strength
of a different kind
and one day your father will see it
pippin here do i swear fealty
and service to gondor
in peace or war
in living or dying
from
from this hour henceforth
until my lord release me
or death take me
and i shall not forget it
nor fail to reward
that which is given
fealty with love
valor with honor
disloyalty with vengeance
i do not think we should so lightly
abandon the outer defenses
defenses that your brother
long held intact
what would you have me do
i will not yield
the river in pelennor unfought
osgiliath must be retaken
my lord osgiliath is overrun
much must be risked in war
is there a captain here who still has
the courage to do his lord will
you wish now that our places
had been exchanged
that i had died
and boromir had lived
yes
i wish that
since you were robbed
of boromir
i will do what i can
in his stead
if i should return
think better of me father
that will depend on the manner
of your return
snoring
ugh
sam
what are you up to
sneaking off are we
sneaking
sneaking
fat hobbit is always so polite
sméagol shows them secret ways
that nobody else could find
and they say sneak
sneak

faramir
your father will has turned
to madness
do not throw away your life
so rashly
where does my allegiance lie
if not here
this is the city of the men of númenor
i will gladly give my life
to defend her beauty
her memory her wisdom
your father loves you faramir
he will remember it
before the end
horses whinnying
can you sing master hobbit
well
yes
at least well enough
for my own people
but we have no songs
for great halls
and evil times
and why should your songs
be unfit for my halls
come sing me a song
chewing noisily
singing
home is behind
the world ahead
and there are many paths to tread
through shadow
to the edge of night

where are the riders from snowbourn
gamling none have come my lord
théoden
six thousand spears
less than half of what id hoped for
six thousand will not be enough
to break the lines of mordor
more will come
every hour lost hastens gondor defeat
we have till dawn
then we must ride
horses whinnying
the horses are restless
and the men are quiet
they grow nervous in the shadow
of the mountain
gimli
that road there
where does that lead
it is the road to the dimholt
the door under the mountain
none who venture there ever return
that mountain is evil

many orcs with a blunt blade
come on
to the smithy go
you should not encourage him
you should not doubt him
i do not doubt his heart
only the reach of his arm
snickers
why should merry be left behind
he has as much cause
to go to war as you
why can he not fight
for those he loves
you know as little of war
as that hobbit
when the fear takes him
and the blood and the screams
and the horror of battle take hold
do you think he would stand and fight
he would flee
and he would be right to do so
war is the province of men éowyn

i come on behalf of one whom i love
arwen is dying
she will not long survive the evil
that now spreads from mordor
the light of the evenstar is failing
as sauron power grows
her strength wanes
arwen life is now tied
to the fate of the ring
the shadow is upon us aragorn
the end has come
it will not be our end but his
you ride to war but not to victory
sauron armies march on minas tirith
this you know
but in secret he sends another force
which will attack from the river
a fleet of corsair ships sails
from the south
theyll be in the city in two days
youre outnumbered aragorn
you need more men
there are none
there are those who dwell
in the mountain
eerie breathing
wind whistling
murderers
traitors
you would call upon them to fight
they believe in nothing
they answer to no one
they will answer
to the king of gondor
andúril the flame of the west
forged from the shards of narsil
sauron will not have forgotten
the sword of elendil
the blade that was broken
shall return to minas tirith
the man who can wield
the power of this sword
can summon to him an army more
deadly than any that walks this earth
put aside the ranger
become who you were born to be

the war lies to the east
you cannot leave on the eve of battle
you cannot abandon the men
éowyn
we need you here
why have you come
do you not know
it is but a shadow and a thought
that you love
i cannot give you what you seek
i have wished you joy
since first i saw you
gimli
just where do you think youre off to
not this time
this time you must stay gimli

of the stubbornness of dwarves
you might as well accept it

men chattering indistinctly

i dont understand
man 2
lord aragorn

why does he leave on the eve of battle
he leaves because there is no hope
he leaves because he must
gamling
too few have come
we cannot defeat
the armies of mordor
no
we cannot
but we will meet them
in battle nonetheless
i have left instruction
the people are to follow
your rule in my stead
take up my seat in the golden hall
long may you defend edoras
if the battle goes ill
what other duty would you
have me do my lord
duty
no
i would have you smile again
not grieve for those
whose time has come
you shall live to see
these days renewed
and no more despair
gimli what kind of army would linger
in such a place
legolas
one that is cursed
long ago the men of the mountains
swore an oath
to the last king of gondor
to come to his aid
to fight
but when the time came
when gondor need was dire
they fled
vanishing into the darkness
of the mountain
and so isildur cursed them
never to rest until they had
fulfilled their pledge
who shall call them
from the grey twilight
the forgotten people
the heir of him to whom
the oath they swore
from the north shall he come
need shall drive him
he shall pass the door
to the paths of the dead
the very warmth of my blood
seems stolen away
the way is shut
it was made by those
who are dead
and the dead keep it
the way is shut

i do not fear death
well this is a thing unheard-of
an elf will go underground
where a dwarf dare not
oh
oh id never hear the end of it
we must ride light and swift
it is a long road ahead
and man and beast must reach the end
with the strength to fight
little hobbits do not belong in war
master meriadoc
all my friends have gone to battle

im gonna bleed you like a stuck pig
gasps drops sword
not if i stick you first
sam
grunts removes sword
oh sam im so sorry
sorry for everything
sam let get you out of here
it too late it over
theyve taken it sam
they took the ring
begging your pardon but they havent
i thought id lost you
so i took it
only for safekeeping
give it to me
give me the ring sam
voice of the ring whispering
voice echoing
sam
give me the ring
whispering stops
in normal voice
you must understand
the ring is my burden
it will destroy you sam
breathing with difficulty
come on mr frodo
we best find you some clothes
you cant go walking through mordor
in naught but your skin
sam
we did it mr frodo
we made it to mordor
frodo
there are so many of them
well never get through unseen
it him the eye
we have to go in there mr frodo
there nothing for it
come on let just make it
down the hill for starters
frodo has passed beyond my sight
the darkness is deepening
if sauron had the ring
we would know it
it only a matter of time
he has suffered a defeat yes
but behind the walls of mordor
our enemy is regrouping
let him stay there
let him rot why should we care
because 0000 orcs now stand
between frodo and mount doom
ive sent him to his death
no
there is still hope for frodo
he needs time and safe passage
across the plains of gorgoroth
we can give him that
how
draw out sauron armies
empty his lands
then we gather our full strength
and march on the black gate
coughs
we cannot achieve victory
through strength of arms
aragorn
not for ourselves
but we can give frodo his chance
if we keep sauron eye fixed upon us
keep him blind to all else that moves
a diversion
certainty of death
small chance of success
what are we waiting for
sauron will suspect a trap
he will not take the bait
oh i think he will
crackling
sauron speaking
in black speech
long have you hunted me
long have i eluded you
no more
behold the sword of elendil
éowyn
the city has fallen silent
there is no warmth left in the sun
it grows so cold
it just the damp
of the first spring rain
i do not believe this darkness
will endure
horn blowing

thunder rumbling

thunder rumbling
grunts
panting

straight as we can
there no point carrying anything

clanging
mr frodo
look
there is light
and beauty up there
that no shadow can touch
wheezing
thunder rumbling
take mine
there a few drops left
there will be none left
for the return journey
i dont think there will be
a return journey mr frodo
voice of the ring whispering
frodo get down
hide
grunts
frodo
where are they
let the lord of the black land come forth
let justice be done upon him
gate creaking
my master sauron the great
bids thee welcome
is there any in this rout
with authority to treat with me
we do not come to treat with sauron
faithless and accursed
tell your master this
the armies of mordor must disband
he is to depart these lands
never to return
aha old greybeard
i have a token i was bidden
to show thee
frodo
frodo
silence
no
silence
the halfling was dear to thee i see
know that he suffered greatly
at the hands of his host
growls
who wouldve thought one so small
could endure so much pain
and he did gandalf
he did
laughs
and who is this
isildur heir
it takes more to make a king
than a broken elvish blade
yells
i guess that concludes negotiations
i do not believe it
i will not
growling
pull back
pull back
orcs chanting
sam
it gone mr frodo
the light passed on
away towards the north
something drawn its gaze
hold your ground hold your ground
sons of gondor of rohan my brothers
i see in your eyes
the same fear that would take
the heart of me
a day may come
when the courage of men fails
when we forsake our friends
and break all bonds of fellowship
but it is not this day
an hour of wolves
and shattered shields
when the age of men
comes crashing down
but it is not this day
this day we fight
by all that you hold dear
on this good earth
i bid you stand men of the west
steam hissing
grunts
never thought id die fighting
side by side with an elf
what about side by side with a friend
aye
i could do that
do you remember the shire
mr frodo
itll be spring soon
and the orchards will be in blossom
and the birds will be nesting
in the hazel thicket
and theyll be sowing
the summer barley in the lower fields
and eating the first
of the strawberries with cream
do you remember
the taste of strawberries
hoarsely
no sam
i cant recall the taste of food
nor the sound of water
nor the touch of grass
im
naked in the dark
there there nothing
no veil between me
and the wheel of fire
i can see him
with my waking eyes
then let us be rid of it
once and for all
come on mr frodo
i cant carry it for you
but i can carry you
come on

my friends
you bow to no one
frodo
and thus it was
a fourth age of middle-earth began
and the fellowship of the ring
though eternally bound
by friendship and love
was ended
thirteen months to the day since gandalf
sent us on our long journey
we found ourselves
looking upon a familiar sight
we were home
hi
hobbits chattering
and laughing
hey watch the pumpkin

hm
frodo how do you pick up the threads
of an old life
how do you go on
when in your heart
you begin to understand
there is no going back
there are some things
that time cannot mend
some hurts that go too deep
that have taken hold
door opens
sam
mr frodo
what is it
it been four years to the day
since weathertop sam
it never really healed
there and back again a hobbit tale
by bilbo baggins
and the lord of the rings
by frodo baggins
you finished it
frodo
not quite
there room for a little more
frodo bilbo once told me his part
in this tale would end
that each of us must come and go
in the telling
bilbo story was now over
there would be no more journeys
for him
save one
bilbo weakly
tell me again lad where are we going
frodo
to the harbor bilbo
the elves have accorded you
a special honor
a place on the last ship
to leave middle-earth
frodo
any chance of seeing
that old ring of mine again
the one i gave you
im sorry uncle
im afraid i lost it
oh
pity
i should like to have held it
one last time
seagulls cawing
oh
well here a sight
i have never seen before
the power of the three rings is ended
the time has come
for the dominion of men
{\an8}<font color=#008000>i aear cân ven na mar
<font color=#ffff00>the sea calls us home
the sea calls us home
in elvish
the sea calls us home
i think im
quite ready
for another adventure
farewell
my brave hobbits
my work is now finished
here at last
on the shores of the sea
comes the end of our fellowship
i will not say do not weep
for not all tears are an evil
it is time frodo
sam
what does he mean
we set out to save the shire sam
and it has been saved
but not for me
you dont mean that
you cant leave
the last pages are for you sam
frodo
my dear sam
you cannot always be torn in two
you will have to be one and whole
for many years
you have so much to enjoy
and to be and to do
your part in the story will go on
well
im back
chuckles
annie lennox singing
into the west
lay down
your sweet and weary head
night is falling
you have come
to journey end
sleep now
and dream
of the ones who came before
they are calling
from across
the distant shore
why do you weep
what are these tears
upon your face
soon you will see
all of your fears
will pass away
safe in my arms
youre only sleeping
what can you see
on the horizon
why do the white gulls
call
across the sea
a pale moon rises
the ships have come
to carry you home
and all will turn
to silver glass
a light on the water
all souls pass
hope fades
into the world of night
through shadows falling
out of memory and time
dont say
we have come now to the end
white shores are calling
you and i will meet again
and youll be here
in my arms
just sleeping
what can you see
on the horizon
why do the white gulls
call
across the sea
a pale moon rises
the ships have come
to carry you home
and all will turn
to silver glass
a light on the water
grey ships pass
into the west
