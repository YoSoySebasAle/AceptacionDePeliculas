good morning mr crawford
sorry to pull you off the
course at such short notice
your instructors tell
me youre doing well
top quarter of your class
i hope so
they havent posted
any grades yet
a job come up and
i thought about you
not a job really more
of an interesting errand
sit down
yes sir
i remember you from
my seminar at uva
you grilled me pretty
hard as i recall
on the bureau civil rights
record in the hoover years
i gave you an a
a-minus sir
let see double major psych and
criminology graduated magna
summer internships at
the reitsinger clinic
it says here when you graduate
you want to come to work for
me in behavioural science
yes very much sir very much
were interviewing all the
serial killers now in custody
for a psycho-behavioural profile
it could be a real help
in unsolved cases
most of them have been
happy to talk to us
do you spook easily starling
not yet sir
see the one we want most
refuses to cooperate
i want you to go after him
again today in the asylum
and who the subject
the psychiatrist hannibal lecter
hannibal the cannibal
i dont expect him to talk to you
but i have to be able
to say we tried
so if he wont cooperate i
want just straight reporting
how he look how
his cell look
is he sketching drawing
if he is what he sketching
here a dossier on lecter
a copy of our questionnaire
and a special id for you
have your memo on my
desk by 0800 wednesday
okay
excuse me sir but
why the urgency
lecter been in prison
for so many years now
is there some connection between
him and buffalo bill maybe
i wish there were
i want your full
attention starling
yes sir
be very careful with
hannibal lecter
dr chilton at the asylum
will go over all the physical
procedures used with him
do not deviate from them
for any reason whatsoever
and youre to tell him
nothing personal starling
believe me you dont want
hannibal lecter inside your head
just do your job but
never forget what he is
and what is that
oh he a monster
a pure psychopath
so rare to capture one alive
from a research point of view
lecter is our most prized asset
well
you know we get a lot of
detectives here but i must say
i cant ever remember
one as attractive
will you be in
baltimore overnight
because this can be quite a fun
town if you have the right guide
well im sure this is a
great town dr chilton
but my instructions
are to talk to dr
lecter and report
back this afternoon
i see
let make this quick then
weve tried to study
him of course
but he much too sophisticated
for the standard tests
oh my does he hate us
he thinks im his nemesis
crawford very clever
isnt he using you
what do you mean sir
a pretty young woman
to turn him on
i dont believe lecter even
seen a woman in eight years
and oh are you ever his taste
so to speak
i graduated from uva doctor
it is not a charm school
good then you should be
able to remember the rules
do not touch the glass do
not approach the glass
you pass him nothing but soft
paper no pencils or pens
no staples or paper
clips on his paper
use the sliding food
carrier no exceptions
if he attempts to pass you
anything do not accept it
do you understand me
yes i understand sir
im going to show you why we
insist on such precautions
on the afternoon of july 8 98
he complained of chest pains and
was taken to the dispensary
his mouthpiece and restraints
were removed for an ekg
when the nurse leaned over
him he did this to her
the doctors managed to reset
her jaw more or less
save one of her eyes
his pulse never got above 85
even when he ate her tongue
i keep him in here
dr chilton
if lecter feels that
youre his enemy
then well maybe well have
more luck if i go in by myself
what do you think
you might have suggested this in
my office and saved me the time
yes sir but then i
would have missed
the pleasure of your company sir
when she finished
bring her out
hi im barney
he told you dont
get near the glass
yes he did clarice starling
nice to meet you clarice
you can hang your coat
up here if you like
thank you i will
he past the others
the last cell
you keep to the right
i put out a chair for you
oh yes that very
good thank you
ill be watching youll do fine
hi
i can smell your cunt
good morning
dr lecter my name is clarice
starling may i speak with you
youre one of jack
crawford arent you
i am yes sir
may i see your credentials
certainly
closer please
closer
that expires in one week
youre not real fbi are you
im still in training
at the academy
jack crawford sent
a trainee to me
yes im a student
im here to learn from you
maybe you can decide for yourself
whether or not im qualified
enough to do that
that is rather slippery
of you agent starling
sit please
now then tell me
what did miggs say to you
multiple miggs in the next cell
he hissed at you
what did he say
he said i can smell your cunt
i see
i myself cannot
you use evyan skin cream
and sometimes you
wear lair du temps
but not today
did you do all these
drawings doctor
that is the duomo seen
from the belvedere
you know florence
all that detail just
from memory sir
memory agent starling is
what i have instead of a view
well
perhaps youd care to lend us your
view on this questionnaire sir
oh no no no
you were doing fine
you had been courteous and
receptive to courtesy
you had established trust with the
embarrassing truth about miggs
and now this ham-handed segue
into your questionnaire
it wont do
im only asking you to
look at this doctor
either you will or you wont
yeah
jack crawford must
be very busy indeed
if he is recruiting help
from the student body
busy hunting that new
one buffalo bill
what a naughty boy he is
do you know why he
called buffalo bill
please tell me the
newspapers wont say
well it started as a bad
joke in kansas city homicide
they said this one likes
to skin his humps
why do you think he
removes their skins
agent starling
enthral me with your acumen
it excites him
most serial killers keep some sort
of trophies from their victims
i didnt
no
no you ate yours
you send that through now
oh agent starling
you think you can dissect me
with this blunt little tool
no
i thought that your knowledge
youre so ambitious arent you
you know what you look like to me
with your good bag and
your cheap shoes
you look like a rube
a well-scrubbed hustling
rube with a little taste
good nutrition has given
you some length of bone
but youre not more than one
generation from poor white trash
are you agent starling
and that accent youve tried
so desperately to shed
pure west virginia
what does your father
do is he a coal miner
does he stink of the lamp
and oh how quickly
the boys found you
all those tedious
sticky fumblings
in the back seats of cars
while you could only dream of
getting out getting anywhere
getting all the way to the fbi
you see a lot doctor
but are you strong
enough to point that
high-powered perception
at yourself
what about it why dont you
why dont you look at yourself
and write down what you see
maybe youre afraid to
a census-taker once
tried to test me
i ate his liver with
some fava beans
and a nice chianti
you fly back to school
now little starling
fly fly fly
i bit my wrist so i could die
look at the blood
gotcha
miggs you stupid fuck
hannibal the cannibal
agent starling come back
agent starling agent starling
i would not have had
that happen to you
discourtesy is
unspeakably ugly to me
then do this test for me
no but i will make you happy
ill give you a chance
for what you love most
and what is that doctor
advancement of course
now listen carefully look deep
within yourself clarice starling
go seek out miss mofet an old
patient of mine
m-o-f-e-t go now
doctor
i dont think miggs could
manage again quite so soon
even though he is crazy
go now
hey bill

rule 404
clarice phone it the guru
crawford
yeah
thanks ardelia
starling
sir
miggs is dead
dead how
the orderly heard
lecter whispering to
him all afternoon
and miggs crying
they found him at bed check
hed swallowed his own tongue
starling
yeah im still here sir
i just i dont know
how to feel about this
you dont have to
feel any way about
it lecter did it
to amuse himself
look i know it got ugly today
but you mentioned a
name at the end mofet
any follow-up on her
well lecter altered or destroyed
most of his patients histories
prior to capture so there no
record of anyone named mofet
but i thought the
yourself reference
was too hokey for lecter
so i figured he from baltimore
and i looked in the phone book
and there a your
self storage facility
right outside of
downtown baltimore sir
unit 3 was leased for 0 years
prepaid in full
the contract
is in the name of a
miss hester mofet
so nobody been in
here since 980
not to my knowledge
privacy is a great
concern to my customers
yes i wont disturb
anything i promise
ill be out of here
before you know it
can i help you
yes actually you can
it stuck
we could return
tomorrow with my son
what about him
i would ask my driver to help you
but he detests physical labour
great
well you just stay here
ill be back in one minute
it stuck
hand me that flashlight sir
oh
if this door should fall
down or anything else
this is the number for our
baltimore field office

youre with me
you call them if
anything should happen
yes miss starling

you watch yourself
thank you
hester mofet it an
anagram isnt it doctor
hester mofet the rest of me
miss the rest of me meaning
that you rented that garage
thank you
your bleeding has stopped
how did you
it nothing
it just a scratch
dr lecter whose head
is in that bottle
why dont you ask me
about buffalo bill
why do you know
something about him
i might if i saw the case file
you could get that for me
why dont we talk
about miss mofet
you wanted me to find him
his real name is benjamin raspail
a former patient of mine
whose romantic attachments ran
to shall we say the exotic
i did not kill him i assure you
merely tucked him away
very much as i found him
after hed missed
three appointments
if you didnt kill him
then who did sir
who can say
best thing for him really
his therapy was going nowhere
his dress make-up
raspail was a transvestite
in life oh no
garden variety manic-depressive
tedious very tedious
and i just think of him
as a kind of experiment
a fledgling killer first
effort at transformation
how did you feel when
you saw him clarice
scared at first then
exhilarated
jack crawford is helping
your career isnt he
apparently he likes you
and you like him too
i never thought about it
do you think jack crawford
wants you sexually
true he is much older
but do you think he visualises
scenarios exchanges
fucking you
that doesnt interest me doctor
frankly it the sort of
thing that miggs would say
not any more
thank you barney
what happened to your drawings
punishment you see for miggs
just like that gospel program
when you leave theyll
turn the volume way up
dr chilton does enjoy
his petty torments
what did you mean by
transformation doctor
ive been in this room for
eight years now clarice
i know they will never ever
let me out while im alive
what i want is a view
i want a window where i can
see a tree or even water
i want to be in a
federal institution
far away from dr chilton
what did you mean by
fledgling killer
are you saying that
he killed again
im offering you a psychological
profile on buffalo bill
based on the case evidence
ill help you catch him clarice
you know who he is dont you
tell me who decapitated
your patient doctor
all good things to those who wait

saddle up pack your field
gear youre moving out
youre going with crawford
where
found a girl body
down in west virginia
been in the water
about a week looks
like a buffalo
bill-type situation
he keeps them alive for three
days we dont know why
there no evidence of rape or
physical abuse prior to death
all the mutilation you see
there is post-mortem
okay three days
then he shoots them skins
them and dumps them
each body in a different river
the water leaves us no trace
evidence of any kind
that fredrica bimmel
the first one
her body was the only one he
took the trouble to weight down
so actually she was
the third girl found
after her he got lazy
okay let see
circles where the
girls were abducted
arrows where their
bodies were found
this new one today washed up here
elk river west virginia
look at him starling
tell me what you see
well he a white male
serial killers tend to hunt
within their own ethnic groups
he not a drifter
he got his own house
somewhere not an apartment
why
what he does with
them takes privacy
he in his 30s or 40s
he got real physical strength
combined with an older
man self-control
he cautious precise
and he never impulsive
hell never stop
why not
he got a real taste for it now
he getting better at his work
not bad starling
questions

anything about
the information
contained in my report
or dr lecter offer sir
im considering it
that why you sent me
in there isnt it
to get his help on
buffalo bill sir
well if that was the
case then i just
i just wish i was in
on it that all
if i had sent you in there
with an actual agenda
lecter would have
known it instantly
he would have toyed with
you then turned to stone

it matters mr crawford
cops look at you
to see how to act
it matters
point taken
ligature marks found

skinning was post-mortem
time pilch my move

if the beetle moves one of your
men does that still count

good morning im donna ferucchi
im gene cassel with sports
and im tim langhorn our
top story for this morning
catherine martin
the 25-year-old daughter
of senator ruth martin
listed first as a
missing person is
now believed to
have been kidnapped
by the serial killer known
only as buffalo bill
memphis police sources indicate
that the missing girl blouse
has been identified
sliced up the back
in what has become a kind of grim
all-too-familiar calling card
young catherine martin
as weve said
is the only daughter of
us senator ruth martin
the republican junior
senator from tennessee
and while her kidnapping
is not at this point
considered to be
politically motivated
nevertheless it has stirred the
government to its highest levels
reached for a comment on the
ski slopes of stowe vermont
the president himself said to be
and i quote
intensely concerned
just moments ago senator martin
taped this dramatic personal plea
excuse me
im speaking now to the person
who is holding my daughter
catherine is very gentle and kind
talk to her and youll see
you have the power
you are in charge
i know you can feel
love and compassion
you have a wonderful chance
to show the whole world
that you can be merciful
as well as strong
that youre big enough
to treat catherine
better than the world
has treated you
you have that power
please
my daughter is catherine
boy that smart
release her unharmed
jesus that really smart
she keeps repeating the name
if he sees catherine as a
person and not just an object
it harder to tear her up
please release my little girl
what youre doing miss starling
is coming into my hospital
to conduct an interview
and refusing to share information
with me for the third time
sir i told you
this is just a routine
follow-up on the raspail case
he is my patient i have rights
i understand that sir
look i am not just some
turnkey miss starling
this is the number for the
us attorney office
please either you
discuss this with him
or you let me do my
job do you understand
if your profile helps
us catch buffalo bill
in time to save catherine martin
the senator promises
you a transfer
to the va hospital at
oneida park new york
with a view of the woods nearby
maximum security still
applies of course
youd have reasonable
access to books
best of all though
one week of the year
you get to leave the
hospital and go here
plum island
every day of that week you
may walk on the beach
you may swim in the ocean
for up to one hour
under swat team
surveillance of course
and there you have it
a copy of the buffalo
bill case file
a copy of the senator offer
this offer is
non-negotiable and final
if catherine martin
dies you get nothing
plum island animal
disease research centre
sounds charming
that only part of the island
there a very very nice beach
terns nest there
there beautiful
terns
if i help you clarice it
will be turns with us too
quid pro quo i tell you
things you tell me things
not about this case
though about yourself
quid pro quo yes or no
yes or no clarice poor
little catherine is waiting
go doctor
what is your worst
memory of childhood
the death of my father
tell me about it and
dont lie or ill know
he was a town marshal
and one night he
surprised two burglars
coming out of the
back of a drugstore
they shot him
was he killed outright
no he was very strong he
lasted more than a month
my mother died when
i was very young
so my father had become
the whole world to me
and when he left me i had
nothing i was ten years old
youre very frank clarice
i think it would
be quite something
to know you in private life
quid pro quo doctor
so tell me about
miss west virginia
was she a large girl
yes
big through the hips roomy
they all were
what else
she had an object deliberately
inserted into her throat
now that hasnt been
made public yet
we dont know what it means
was it a butterfly
yes a moth
just like the one we found in
benjamin raspail
head an hour ago
why does he place
them there doctor
the significance of
the moth is change
caterpillar into
chrysalis or pupa
and from thence into beauty
our billy wants to change too
there no correlation
in literature
between transsexualism
and violence
transsexuals are very passive
clever girl
youre so close to the way
youre gonna catch him
do you realise that
no tell me why
after your father murder
you were orphaned
what happened next
i dont imagine the answer is on
those second-rate shoes clarice
i went to live with my mother
cousin and her husband in montana
they had a ranch
was it a cattle ranch
sheep and horses
how long did you live there
two months
why so briefly
i ran away
why clarice
did the rancher make
you perform fellatio
did he sodomise you
no he was a very decent man
quid pro quo doctor
billy is not a real transsexual
but he thinks he is
he tries to be
he tried to be a lot
of things i expect
and you said that i was very close
to the way we would catch him
what did you mean doctor
there are three major centres
for transsexual surgery
johns hopkins the university of
minnesota and columbus
medical centre
i wouldnt be surprised if billy
had applied for sex reassignment
at one or all of them
and been rejected
on what basis would
they reject him
look for severe
childhood disturbances
associated with violence
our billy wasnt born
a criminal clarice
he was made one through
years of systematic abuse
billy hates his own
identity you see
and he thinks that makes
him a transsexual
but his pathology is a
thousand times more savage
and more terrifying
it rubs the lotion on its skin
it does this whenever it told
mister my family will pay cash
whatever ransom youre
asking for theyll pay it
it rubs the lotion on its skin
or else it gets the hose again

murdered a transient
