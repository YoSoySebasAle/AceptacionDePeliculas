ladies and gentlemen
frankie wake up
a most distinguished guest
would like to say a few words
would you please welcome senator
pat geary of the state of nevada
and there mrs geary
thank you very much
ladies and gentlemen
and this is a very very happy day
for me and my wife mrs geary
we see nevada far too seldom
but particularly today when we can join
with old friends we can make new friends
and we help celebrate
a young man first communion
and also to thank that boy family for
a magnificent contribution to the state
i have here in my hand a check made out
to the university
and it is a magnificent endowment
in the name of
anthony vito corleone
and the check is signed by
that young man parents
whom i think we should recognize now
mike pat kay stand up please
let the folks see you
folks i want you to join me
in giving a real nevada thank you
to mr and mrs michael corleone
we also have as a special added
attraction the sierra boys choir
who have chosen a certain special song
and a special arrangement
to honour their host
mr michael corleone
boys
the plaque
okay fellas i got that one
okay this is yours
senator just you and mrs corleone
excuse me
this is my lawyer tom hagen senator geary
he the one who arranged this whole
thing through your man turnbull
yes yes
sit down
i was under the impression
that you and i would talk alone
i trust these men with my life senator if i were
to ask them to leave it would be an insult
it perfectly all right with me
but i should tell you i am a blunt man and i
intend to speak very frankly to you
maybe more frankly
than anyone in my position
ever talked to you before
the corleone family
has done very well here in nevada
you own or control
two major hotels in vegas
one in reno
the licences were grandfathered in
so there was no problem
with the gaming commission
now my sources tell me
that you plan to make a move
against the tropigala
they tell me that within a week
youre gonna move klingman out
that quite an expansion however it will
leave you with one little technical problem
the licence will still be
in klingman name
turnbull is a good man
yeah well let let cut out the bullshit
i dont want to spend
more time here than i have to
you can have the licence
the price is 250000 dollars
plus a monthly payment of five
percent of the gross
of all four hotels mr
corleone
now the price for the license
is less than $20000 am i right
that right
now why would i ever consider paying more than that
because i intend to squeeze you
i dont like your kind of people
i dont like to see you come out
to this clean country in your oily hair
dressed up in those silk suits
and try to pass yourselves off
as decent americans
ill do business with you but the fact is
that i despise your masquerade
the dishonest way you pose yourself yourself
and your whole fucking family
senator
were both part of the same hypocrisy
but never think it applies to my family
all right all right
some people have to play little games
you play yours
so let just say that youll pay me
because it in your interest to pay me
but i want your answer and the money
by noon tomorrow and one more thing
dont you contact me again ever
from now on you deal with turnbull
open that door son
senator you can have my answer now
if you like
my offer is this
nothing
not even the fee for the gaming licence which
i would appreciate if you would put up personally
good afternoon gentlemen

cuba cuba
most respected gentlemen
allow me to welcome you to the city of havana
i want to thank this distinguished group
of american industrialists
for continuing to work with cuba
toward the greatest period of prosperity
in her entire history
mr william shaw
representing
the general fruit company
messrs corngold and dant
of united telephone
and telegraph company
mr petty
regional vice president of
the pan american mining corporation
mr robert allen
of south american sugar
mr michael corleone of nevada
representing our associates
in tourism and leisure activities
and my old friend and associate
from florida
mr hyman roth
i would like to take this opportunity to thank united telephone
and telegraph for their lovely christmas gift
a solid gold telephone
perhaps you gentlemen would like to take a look at it
mr president
yes
perhaps you would discuss the status of rebel activity
and what this can mean to our businesses
of course
heavy stuff
i want to assure you that although the rebels have
mounted an impressive campaign in las villas
my staff indicates with assurance that well
drive them out of the city of santa clara
before the new year
i want to put you all at ease
we will tolerate no guerrillas
in the casinos or the swimming pools
he said that theyre making an arrest
and in a few minutes
hell let us through
johnny
it nothing
just some lousy bandits
the police are cleaning them up
viva fidel
well i hope my age is correct
im always accurate about my age
make sure that everybody
sees the cake before we cut it
im very pleased
you were all able to come from
such distances to be with me today
when a man comes
to this point in his life
he wants to turn over
the things he been blessed with
turn them over to friends
as a reward for the friends he had
and to make sure that everything
goes well after he gone
not for years
hear hear
well see the doctors would disagree
but what do they know
these are wonderful things
that weve achieved in havana
and there no limit
to where we can go from here
this kind of government knows
how to help business to encourage it
the hotels here are bigger
and swankier
than any of the rough joints we put in vegas
and we can thank our friends
in the cuban government
which has put up half the cash with the
teamsters on a dollar for dollar basis
has relaxed restrictions on imports
what im saying is that we have now
what we have always needed
real partnership with a government
smaller piece
you all know michael corleone
and we all remember his father
at the time of my retirement or death
i turn over all my interests
in the havana operation to his control
but all of you will share
the nacionale will go
to the lakeville road boys
the capri to the corleone family
the sevilla biltmore also
but eddie levine of newport will bring in the
pennino brothers
dino and eddie for a piece
and also to handle the actual casino operations
and weve saved a piece
for some friends in nevada
to make sure that things go smooth
back home
i want all of you to enjoy your cake
so enjoy
happy birthday
lchaim
i saw an interesting thing happen today
a rebel was being arrested
by the military police
and rather than be taken alive he exploded
a grenade he had hidden in his jacket
he killed himself and he took a captain
of the command with him right johnny
those rebels you know theyre lunatics
maybe so
but it occurred to me the soldiers
are paid to fight the rebels arent
what does that tell you
they could win
this country has had rebels
for the last 50 years it in their blood
believe me i know ive been coming here
since the twenties
we were running molasses out of
havana when you were a baby
the trucks owned by your father
michael
id rather we talked about this
when were alone
the two million never got to the island
i wouldnt want it to get around
that you held back the money
because you had second thoughts
about the rebels
ah sit down michael sit down
if i could only live to see it
to be there with you
what i wouldnt give for 20 more years
here we are protected free to make
our profits without kefauver
the goddamn justice department
and the fbi
90 miles away in partnership
with a friendly government
90 miles it nothing
just one small step looking for a man that wants
to be president of the united states
and having the cash
to make it possible

my sixth sense tells me your brother fredo brought
a bag full of money where is it
youre pulling out
just wanna just wanna wait
how do you feel
terrible
id give four million just to be able to take a piss
without it hurting
who had frank pentangeli killed
the rosato brothers
i know but who gave the go-ahead
i know i didnt
there was this kid i grew up with
he was younger than me
sort of looked up to me you know
we did our first work together
worked our way out of the street
things were good we made the most of it
during prohibition
we ran molasses into canada
made a fortune your father too
as much as anyone
i loved him and trusted him
later on he had an idea to build a city
out of a desert stop-over
for gis on their way to the west coast
that kid name was moe greene
and the city he invented was las vegas
this was a great man
a man of vision and guts
and there isnt even a plaque
or a signpost or a statue of him in that town
someone put a bullet through his eye
no one knows who gave the order
when i heard it i wasnt angry
i knew moe i knew he was headstrong
talking loud saying stupid things
so when he turned up dead i let it go
and i said to myself
this is the business weve chosen
i didnt ask
who gave the order because it had
nothing to do with business
that two million in a bag in your room
im going in to take a nap
when i wake if the money on the table
ill know i have a partner
if it isnt ill know i dont

vito what do you think
well make a big business
new york city
would you mind speaking up please
new york city
are you the son of vito corleone
yes i am
and where was he born
corleone sicily
did he at times use an alias that was
known in certain circles as godfather
godfather is a term that was used by his friends
one of affection and one of respect
mr chairman i would like to verify
the witness statement
for years now a growing number of my constituents
have been of italian descent
and ive come to know them well
they have honored me
with their support and with their friendship
indeed i can proudly say that some of my
very best friends are italian-americans
however mr chairmanat this time and unfortunately
i have to leave these proceedings
in order to preside over a very important
meeting of my own committee
but before i leave i do want to say this
that these hearings on the mafia
are in no way whatsoever
a slur upon the great italian people
because i can state from my own knowledge
and experience
that italian-americans are among
the most loyal most law-abiding
patriotic hard-working
american citizens in this land
it would be a shame mr chairman
if we allowed a few rotten apples
to give a bad name to the whole barrel
because from the time of the great christopher
columbus up through the time of enrico fermi
right up until the present day
italian-americans have been pioneers
in building and defending our great nation
they are the salt of the earth and theyre
one of the backbones of this country
im sure we all agree
with our esteemed colleague
mr corleone you have been advised
as to your legal rights
we have testimony from a witness
a previous witness one willi cicci
he has stated that you are head of the most
powerful mafia family in this country
are you
no im not
the witness has testified that you are
personally responsible
for the murder of a new york city
police captain in 947
and with him a man
named virgil sollozzo
do you deny this
yes i do
is it true that in the year 950
you devised the murder of the heads
of the five families in new york
to assume and consolidate
your nefarious power
it a complete falsehood
mr questadt
is it true that you have a controlling interest
in three of the major hotels in las vegas
no it not true i own some stock in
some of the hotels there but very little
i also have stock in ibm and it&t
do you have any interests or control over gambling
and narcotics in the state of new york
no i do not
senator my client would like to read
a statement for this committee
mr chairman mr chairman i think this statement
is totally out of order at this time
sir my client has answered every question asked by
this committee with the utmost sincerity
he has not taken the fifth amendment as it was his right to do so in all fairness i think this statement should be heard
no no im going to allow mr corleone to read
his statement ill put it in the record
in the hopes of clearing
my family name
and the sincere desire to give my children their fair share
of the american way of life
without a blemish on their name
and background
i have appeared before this committee and
given it all the cooperation in my power
i consider it a great dishonor to me personally
to have to deny that i am a criminal
i wish to have the following noted
for the record
that i served my country faithfully and honorably
in world war two
and was awarded the navy cross
for actions in defense of my country
that i have never been arrested
or indicted for any crime whatsoever
that no proof linking me to any
criminal conspiracy
whether it is called mafia or cosa nostra
or whatever other name you wish to give
has ever been made public
i have not taken refuge
behind the fifth amendment
although it my right to do so
i challenge this committee to produce
any witness or evidence against me
and if they do not i hope they will have
the decency to clear my name
with the same publicity with which
they now have besmirched it
im sure were all quite impressed mr corleone
particularly with your love for our country
committee will stand in recess
until 000 am monday morning
at which time the committee will produce a witness wholl
corroborate the charges which were made against you today
and at which time mr corleone you may very well
be subject to indictment for perjury
i remind you that youre still
under subpoena mr corleone adjourned
ten-to-one shot you said
a ten-to-one shot
he would take the fifth and i lose
you sound like my bookie
i owe that monkey my life
well just get a good night sleep
yeah a good night sleep
you got a big day tomorrow
i got you a new suit
a new shirt new tie
im gonna shave you myself in the morning
youre gonna look respectable for 50 million
of your fellow americans
tomorrowmy life my life wont be worth
a nickel after tomorrow
come on i saw this i saw this 9 times

most people on the outside
some deal
alive pentangeli is alive
how did they get their hands on him
roth he engineered it michael
frankie went to make a deal with
the rosato brothers
and they tried to kill him
he thought you double-crossed him
our people with the new york detectives
said he was half dead scared stiff
and calling out loud that youd turned on him
they already had him on possession
bookmaking murder one and a lot more
the fbi has him airtight
he on an army base 24 hour guards
no way we can get to him youve opened
yourself to five counts of perjury
what about fredo
what does he know
he says he doesnt know anything
and i believe him
roth he played this one beautifully
im going to talk to fredo
i havent got a lot to say mike
we have time
i was kept pretty much in the dark
i didnt know all that much
what about now is there anything
you can help me out with
anything you can tell me now
they got pentangeli that all i can tell you
i didnt know it was
gonna be a hit mike
i swear to god i didnt know it was gonna be a hit
johnny ola bumped into me
in beverly hills
he said that he wanted to talk
he said that you and roth
were in on a big deal together
and that there was something in it
for me if i could help him out
he said that you were being tough
on the negotiations
but if they could get a little help
and close the deal fast
it would be good for the family
and you believed that story
you believed that
he said there was something in it
for me on my own
ive always taken care of you fredo
taken care of me
youre my kid brother
you take care of me
did you ever think about that
did you ever once think about that
send fredo off to do this
send fredo off to do that
let fredo take care of some
mickey mouse nightclub somewhere
send fredo to pick somebody up
at the airport
im your older brother mike and
i was stepped over
that the way pop wanted it
it aint the way i wanted it
i can handle things im smart
not like everybody says
like dumb im smart
and i want respect
is there anything you can tell me about
this investigation anything more
the senate lawyer questadt
he belongs to roth
fredo
youre nothing to me now
youre not a brother
youre not a friend
i dont want to know you
or what you do
i dont want to see you at the hotels
i dont want you near my house
when you see our mother i wanna know
a day in advance so i wont be there
you understand
mikey
i dont want anything to happen to him
while my mother alive

than at a ballgame in here
hey there willi cicci
frankie five-angels
this committee will come to order
state your name please
frank pentangeli
and where were you born
partinico it outside of palermo
and where do you live now
i live in an army barracks
with the fbi guys
we have here finally a witness
that will further testify
to michael corleone rule over a criminal empire that controls all of the gambling in this country and perhaps in other countries
this witness has had no buffer
between himself and michael corleone
he can corroborate our charges on enough counts
for this committee to recommend a charge
of perjury against michael corleone
senator
thank you chairman
mr pentangeli
mr pentangeli were you a member
of the corleone family
did you serve under caporegime
peter clemenza
under vito corleone
also known as the godfather
i never knew no godfather
i have my own family senator
mr pentangeli you
you are contradicting a sworn statement youve
previously made to me and signed
i ask you again sir
here and now under oath
were you at any time a member of
a crime organization
headed by michael corleone
i dont know nothing about that
i was in the olive oil business
with his father
but that was a long time ago that all
we have a sworn affidavit we have it
your sworn affidavit that you murdered
on the orders of michael corleone
do you deny this confession and do you realize what
will happen as a result of your denial
look the fbi guys they promised me a deal
so i made up a lot of stuff about michael corleone
cause that what they wanted
but it was all lies everything
they kept saying
michael corleone did this
and michael corleone did that
so i said yeah sure why not
mr corleone would you kindly identify for the committee
the gentleman sitting to your left
i can answer that
his name is vincenzo pentangeli
is he related to the witness
he is i believe his brother
will he come forward and be sworn sir
sir this man does not understand english

that where i want it met
mike that impossible theyll turn him over directly to the
internal revenue customs and half the fbi
it not impossible
nothing is impossible
it would be like trying to kill the president

tom you know you surprise me
if anything in this life is certain
if history has taught us anything
it that you can kill anyone
rocco
difficult not impossible

why did you ask me if something
was wrong when i came in
i thought you were
going to tell me that
you were moving your family to vegas
and that youd been offered the vice
presidency of the houstan hotels there
i thought youd tell me that
i turned them down i mean do i have to tell you about every offer that i turn down
let do business
all right
just consider this michael
just consider it
now roth and the rosatos are on the run

i dont feel i have to wipe everybody
out tom just my enemies that all
you gonna come along with me in these things
i have to do or what
because if not you can take your wife
your family and your mistress
and move them all to las vegas

and my father everybody
i was the only one that caught a fish
nobody else could catch one except me

did my brother go back
yeah dont worry
he ten times tougher than me
my brother he old-fashioned
he didnt want to go out to dinner
he just wanted to go straight home
that my brother hey listen nothing could get
him away from that two-mule town
he could have been big here
he could have had his own family
tom
what do i do now
frankie
you were always interested
in politics and history
i remember you talking about hitler
back in 33
yeah i still read a lot
i get good stuff in there
you were around the old-timers who dreamed of how the
family should be organized
based on the old roman legions
and called them regimes--the capos and the soldiers
and it worked
yeah it worked
those were the great old days
you know
we was like the roman empire
the corleone family
was like the roman empire
yeah
it was once
frankie
when a plot
against the emperor failed
the plotters were always
given a chance
to let their families keep their fortunes
right
yeah but only the rich guys tom
the little guys got knocked off and all
their estates went to the emperors
unless they went home and killed
themselves then nothing happened
and their families their families were taken care of tom
that was a good break a nice deal
yeah
they went home
and sat in a hot bath
opened up their veins
and bled to death
and sometimes they had a little party
before they did it
dont worry about anything
