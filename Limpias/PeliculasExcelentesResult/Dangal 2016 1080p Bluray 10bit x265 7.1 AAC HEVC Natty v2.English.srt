welcome to the wrestling area
at the seoul olympics
looking forward to
an exciting match today
it come on
shall i come down
no
stand there holding it
the final match this olympics
in the 72 kilo category
between wrestlers from
russia and america
it really sad that
despite wrestling being
such a popular sport in india
indian wrestlers have
disappointed in the olympics
even our boys
can bring home medals
but where is the support
neither money
nor facilities
how will our boys win a medal
if a medal could be won with words
you would have won
it a long time ago
are you new here
that what i thought
try stepping into a
wrestling arena someday
youll run for your life
before the match begins
looks like you have
done it many times
run for your life
if this were an arena
then wed see who would run
why do we need an arena
now the moment
we were all waiting for
the stage is all set for a big fight
there palpable
excitement in the air
both the wrestlers are walking
for the fight
you are absolutely right tom
looks like it going
to be an interesting bout
the crowd seems excited
the wrestlers come face to face
let see how it plays out
the customary handshake
the referee whistle
and the match begins
he down
he down
an early thrashing
for the russian wrestler
overconfidence can often
prove fatal
bro you want to try once more
now the wrestlers are gearing up
for the next round
yes tom this match doesnt look
as easy as it had seemed
let see what happens now
both wrestlers testing each other
a great attack
an equally superb defense
and that was a magnificent move
what an amazing move
he didnt know what hit him
here an attack
and that a counter-attack
and it over
it all over
david has become goliath
and goliath has become david here
well said tom
no one expected such a quick defeat
for the russian wrestler
what a match
this is top class wrestling
you are good
youve just defeated
a state level champion
dont be disheartened buddy
youve just lost to
a national level champion
meet my uncle
mahavir singh phogat
he quit wrestling many years ago
but wrestling hasnt

the smaller kid will win
there you go
merely building a good body
does not make a wrestler
come here kid
wrestling runs in the blood
you have to be born with it
here buy yourself some milk
bless you
when there no food on your plate
what will you eat medals
no one gives a damn
about wrestling
just take up the job
you are being offered
why did you quit wrestling
i had no choice
wrestling gave me respect fame
but it couldnt give me money
so i took up this job
every wrestler dreams
of bringing honor and
glory to the country
but if the country offers no support
how far can a wrestler go
it not your fault that you
couldnt win a medal for your country
how long will you let these
memories depress you
what i couldnt do
our son will
he will win gold
for our country
our flag will fly the highest
mark my words
that day uncle was
as anxious as a student
whose high school results
were due
dont worry brother
it going to be all right
it a girl
uncle was hoping for a boy
but a girl was born
it ok
you have a sister now omkar
i was genuinely happy
but uncle was faking it
and then it all started
suddenly everyone in the village
was an expert
in the art of conceiving a boy
feed a black cow sweets made
with white sesame seeds
wrapped in maize flatbreads
with your left hand before sunrise
a son for sure
mahavir here a special prayer
for a son
recite it daily
here eat this
eat this
stop will you
mahavir
make sure you try only on a sunday
on all other days
reign in your urges
got it
neither did people stop
giving their advice
here you go son
nor did uncle and aunt
stop acting on them
the day of the delivery arrived
and so did half the village
to take credit for a son
geeta you are going to
have a brother
you can play with him
it a girl
but neither did uncle get a son
nor the villagers credit
but in all these
unfailing techniques
where did the fault lie
she must have fed a black buffalo
instead of a black cow
else look at my cousin
from rohtak
she had three healthy boys
in three years
if you say the prayer in reverse
the results will also be reversed
self-control is a virtue
i told him to try only on sundays
he must have let
the reins free every day
i couldnt give you a son
it not your fault
and dont get me wrong
both geeta and babita
are very dear to me
but only a boy
can fulfill my dream
years went by
uncle remained adamant
he wanted a boy
but maybe god was adamant too
the third child was a girl
and so was the fourth
this time i too was dejected
dinner is ready papa
dinner
turn it over or itll burn
another helping papa
after that uncle gave up on his
desire for a son and on his dream too
hey mahavir singhji
what wrong with him
are you coming to watch
the wrestling match this evening
no you carry on
hey mahavir
ive been blessed with a boy
here have some sweets
what happened
look how badly
theyve been thrashed
say something
yes look how badly
theyve been thrashed
theyre all swollen and bruised
yes theyre all swollen and bruised
why did you beat them
i didnt uncle
geeta and babita beat them up
they started it
he called me a loser
and babita a witch
so we gave it to them
they beat them so badly
for such a trivial reason
yes shouldnt have
beaten them so badly
please forgive them
theyre kids
we are letting go because
they are your girls
move
got thrashed by girls
come here
come here
we wont fight again papa
first tell me how did you
manage to do it
first he called me a loser
but i remained quiet
but then he called babita a witch that
was it
i grabbed him and
punched him like this
then the other guy attacked
i caught his hair
and shoved him down
and dug my elbow in his back
they say that a twig is enough
to give hope to a drowning man
here uncle had found
not one but two lifeguards
all along i was desperate for a son
so he could win a gold
for the country
but what didnt occur to me
is that gold is gold
whether a boy wins it or a girl
from now on geeta and babita
will do no household chores
wrestling is in their blood
from now on they will only wrestle
wrestling is for boys
you think our girls are
any lesser than boys
ive never ever seen girls wrestle
what will the villagers say
for how long will they talk
what if the girls break
their hands and legs
well fix them
where will the money come from
i dont know
dont ruin the girls lives
for your passion
let me try for a year
for this one year
you bury your feelings
if i am proven wrong
ill bury my dream forever
be ready at 5 am tomorrow
why papa
i want to feed you
your favorite snack gol gappas
5 am ok
what did you do now
i thought you did something
eat
how is it
it a little less spicy papa
all right make it spicier
eat as much as you want right now
because from today you will both
lead the life of a wrestler
and wrestlers are not allowed
pickled oily and spicy food
in fact
all the food that you most love
consider this your last treat
a messiah for the rest
a terror for your own
come on faster babita
o papa dont put us
through this torture
a messiah for the rest
a terror for your own
papa it difficult to run
in these clothes
o papa dont put us
through this torture
dont torture us
o papa
o papa
o papa you are

injurious to our health
o papa you are
injurious to our health

so much discipline
so much discipline
makes us want to die
o papa you are
injurious to our health
have mercy on us
we are little children
have mercy on us
we are little children
so much discipline
so much discipline
makes us want to die
o papa you are
injurious to our health
nobody wouldve ever been
punished so severely
for beating up a couple of boys
he abused me
why did you have to beat him
now you tell me
you stopped our
picnics and outings
this is torture
grave torture
to tell children not to
enjoy their childhood
this is torture
grave torture
toffees games and toys
scrumptious foods
have bid us adieu
since your scolding
this is our time
for fun and games
why is it being measured
by a stopwatch
our luck is like a broken down car
our luck is like a broken down car
and our papa
and our papa is the
driver of that car
o papa you are
injurious to our health
you have forbidden us
tasty and spicy food
this is torture
grave torture
you ask delicate dolls
to toughen up
this is torture
grave torture
well obey your
every command mummy
just save us
from this wrestling
for one year forget
that you have a mother
hey forgot so quickly
how utterly absurd mahavir
girls in the wrestling arena
will you have me sin at this age
our childhood has been
thrown away
the garden has lost its blossoms
wonder what kind of
war we prepare for
day and night we cry
cascades of tears
you are still not happy
o dictator we are your sacrifice
do you think we are so hopeless
do you think we are so hopeless
better than you are
better than you are
bollywood movie villains
o papa you are
injurious to our health
babita
will you press my legs please
i was going to ask you
the same thing
always respect mother earth
the more you respect it
the more respect
you will get in return
uncle had managed to bring
geeta and babita to the wrestling pit
but there was something missing
in order for geeta and
babita to train well
they needed to practice
with good wrestlers
omkar
him
yes
isnt that too much brother
it was bad enough that
you were making the girls wrestle
now you want
them to fight boys
yes or no
i dont have the heart to say yes
and i dont have the courage
to say no
ok then send him over
because of you both
i am caught in the crossfire
stop complaining
you are just caught
in the crossfire
weve been pushed into war
keep running
why has papa got him
to train with us
this pint-sized boy is no challenge
he looks like a ttss to me
what does that mean
tall on talk short on strength
ttss is it
go easy i am your little sister
yes yes
dont mind me saying
but your girls are a little weak
want to fight me
ill be right back
i dont understand your ways
at one time
i can either be
their coach or their father
when the coach is at work
the father has to take a back seat
sorry for calling you ttss
sorry my foot
you think this is a joke
he is throwing you down
and you are letting him
when he attacks from the left
why dont you stabilize yourself
on the left and defend
sorry papa
child this is wrestling
three sorrys and the game is over
come on
try again
where the strength in you
you are training the girls to wrestle
i didnt say anything
but i will not allow you to cook
chicken in my kitchen
try and understand
wrestlers require protein
i dont care
if meat is cooked in my kitchen
i will stop eating
you want your girls
to be weak wrestlers
i dont know anything
there no way chicken will be
cooked in my kitchen
-omkar
-yes
-do you know how to cook
-no uncle
then learn
we dont have enough money
for their current diet
how can we afford
chicken now
what sell you chicken
worth 00 rupees for 20
and i will benefit from this deal
why dont you explain the math
look geeta and babita will eventually
become famous wrestlers
and when people will find out that
they eat chicken from your shop
where do you think
theyll buy chicken from
that makes sense
but just 20 rupees
there are other shops too
wait listen
let make it 40
i wont give a dime
more than 25
i have browned the onions
and now this pot
will not go back in my kitchen
now put the chicken in the pot
and let it cook on a slow flame
it to be eaten with rice
but it can also be
eaten with bread
uncle was fulfilling his duty
and the villagers theirs
girls are best suited
for the kitchen
not for wrestling
mahavir singh has gone mad
not mad
he become shameless
he getting the girls to
wear shorts and fight boys
since you all started wrestling
your walk has become very manly
wonder what else will happen
next itll be my fist
and your face
if only you had
given birth to a boy
their mother doesnt protest either
the entire village is laughing at us
who will marry our girls
i will make our girls so capable
that boys will not choose them
they will choose boys
i am going to tell papa today
this wrestling isnt working out
me too
b-o-y boy
c-a-t cat
papa this wrestling
isnt working out
for babita
yes papa and
geeta gets so tired
that she falls asleep in class
she cant concentrate
on her studies at all
babita body aches terribly
she keeps tossing
and turning all night
in school girls tease
geeta by calling her a man
sad isnt it
none of these
seem like a problem
tell me if there is
a real problem read
e-l-e-p-h-a-n-t
papa our hair is getting ruined
because of wrestling in the mud
she even has lice
i killed eight this evening
now that a real problem
ok be ready tomorrow at 5 am
carry on
papa please
we dont have any problem
in fact we are enjoying it
please dont cut our hair
we will do as you say
ma say something
look what papa is doing
please dont cut our hair papa
well do whatever you say
well wake up in the morning
do everything
wont ever complain
just dont cut our hair please
please papa
cut it
cut it
can you grow it
then cut it
getting them to wrestle
was still ok
but it cruel to chop their hair off
they are girls after all
whatever i am doing
is for their best
anything that distracts them
from wrestling
i will get rid of
is that the full moon or the sun
i am confused today both
seem to have risen together
let it go babita
our stars are to blame
enough of wrestling
now it time for a street-fight
and then in a small village
of haryana called balali
a grand rebellion began
revolutionaries geeta and babita
versus dictator mahavir singh
all of uncle arsenal
were neutralized one by one
the alarm clock was
cleverly misguided
what happened papa
you are late today
age is catching up
no problem
weve finished today training
come babita
countless light bulbs were martyred
how come the bulb fuses every day
quality papa
quality
injury was made an ally
in the battlefield surrender
was given without a fight
should i give it to you
and uncle despite having both hands
felt helpless like the armless
character from the film holay
get out of here
i couldnt understand how
i had suddenly become so strong
but uncle understood very well
why geeta and babita
had suddenly become so weak
geeta and babita thought
that they had won the war
hey
are you going to sunita wedding
m mummy
are you trying to embarrass me
choose one
this one
let me see
finally
my girls are looking like girls
dont tell papa
come home before 8 pm
i arrive the blushing bride
i arrive the blushing bride
shy nervous
i arrive the blushing bride
ive seen many weird things in my life
but my groom is
the weirdest of the lot
ive seen many weird things in my life
but my groom is
the weirdest of the lot
marrying me to him is like
casting pearls before swine
my groom is such a loser
my groom is a loser
my groom is such a loser
i told my groom
help me freshen up
get me a toothbrush from the store
but instead of a toothbrush
he got me sugarcane from the fields
what a loser
such a loser
my groom is such a loser
my groom is a loser
my groom is such a loser
let it go brother
he is crazy
we missed training
just for a day
what was the need to create
such a big scene
what kind of father forces
his daughters to become wrestlers
makes them wake up at 5 am to run
works them like slaves
makes them fight boys
and if they protest
he cuts their hair
may god never give
anyone such a father
i wish god had given me
such a father
at least your father
thinks about you
otherwise our reality is
the moment a girl is born
teach her to cook and clean
make her do
all the household chores
and once she turns 4
marry her off
get rid of the burden
and hand her over to a man
whom she has never seen before
make her bear children
and raise them
that all she good for
at least your father
considers you his child
he is fighting against
the whole world
he is silently tolerating
their taunts
why
so that the two of you
can have a future a life
what is he doing wrong
i am here to stay
beat the best
i am here to stay
beat the best
when fortune gives you
a chance to prove yourself
you have barely
a handful of days to prepare
it asks in exchange
every drop of your sweat
know for sure
you gain so much more
fortune bows before
your intense effort
so wrestle o wrestler
wrestle o wrestler
that day one fact
became clear to me

but i sure didnt have
wrestling in my blood

not just wrestling competitions
but hearts too

mahavir singhji
care to join me for lunch
the federation is a breeding ground
for such termites
they have ruined sports
there is no support
for sports persons
only abuses when you dont win
medalists dont grow on trees
you have to nurture them
with love with hard work
with passion
and here the scoundrels dont
give money for even a mat
what is a mat brother
synthetic mattresses
on which wrestlers fight
a mattress is a mattress
no
did i say something wrong
uncle had already ruined
our sleep figuratively speaking
now he was hell bent
on doing it literally too
wrestling on a mat is different
from mud wrestling
now we have to wrestle
on the mat
and in mat wrestling
you have to score points
you can score one two
three or five points
omkar
if you hold the opponent
by the waist
and drop him to his knees
then you score one point
and from the ground position
if you roll him on to his back
then you score two points
there are different ways
to do this
uncle
like this
or from the ground position
like this
if you flip your opponent on his back
from a standing position
then you will score three points
please uncle
like this three points
like this from standing position
on to his back
to score five points is difficult
but it can be done
if you flip your opponent
from a standing position
above your head
in a rainbow-like arc
and have him fall on his back
then you score five points
-watch
-no no please uncle
-come here
-no please
a real wrestling mat is not like this
it like this
we have to fight
in the yellow area
the red zone is a danger area
if you step out of it
you lose a point
there are three rounds
of two minutes each
three rounds
of two minutes each
whoever wins two out of
three rounds wins the match
sir your daughter is underweight
so
take my advice
go back
feed her
fatten her and
come back next year
if she fights like this
she will break her bones
you just tell me whether
she is allowed to wrestle or not
yes she is
sign up
sub-junior nationals
good move
geeta had defeated beefy boys
how long could these girls survive
is that a girl or a storm
sub-junior national champion
junior nationals
is she underweight
yes but how does it matter
junior national champion
time flew by
geeta went from junior to senior
and uncle
from senior to senior-citizen
go geeta
babita and i went from
shorts to full length pants
push push her down
side throw
victory to haryana
national champion
finally uncle dream
has been achieved
now we can all relax
no
my dream remains to be fulfilled
every year sees
a national champion
my dream will be fulfilled
when you win gold
not for yourself
but for your country
you can celebrate today
from tomorrow we start
preparing further

an international medal
you came to drop her right
youve done that
now leave the rest to me

the institute must be
very big isnt it
everyone there must be
a champion isnt it
and the facilities there
must be amazing right

why do my days
suddenly seem different
i know not
why is my heart leaping
like a squirrel

these new colors
these sweet sounds
why do my days
suddenly seem different
i know not
why is my heart leaping
like a squirrel
shall we go out later tonight
is the weather a little wild
or is my spirit soaring
just one wont make a difference
the taste of free will
is so juicy
i know not
why the branches of my desire
are suddenly blooming
with flaming flowers
i know not
why is my heart leaping
like a squirrel
i know not
yes that the way
remember one mistake
can cost you the medal
a new friendship is forming
with the limitless open skies
that making the earth jealous
she complaining
i am getting spoilt
life too nowadays
seems bored of counting
it reciting couplets
among math equations
yes papa training is going well
i am going
coach sir is waiting
bye
ive left behind the arguments
of right and wrong
ive moved on
why is my heart leaping
like a squirrel
geeta
come here
forget your papa technique
learn only what i teach you
got that
hello
sorry geeta has gone out
for years i have been losing
to both of you intentionally
it is the truth
that it
you see
wrestlers shine only when
the technique is right
win the nationals soon
you too will be sorted
yes when are you coming home
i am coming next week
need something
nothing you get here
ok
did you like it
really
you grew out your hair
it looking good
your papa wont like it
now everything cant work
the way papa wants
coach sir didnt say anything
and he is such an accomplished coach
you do as you please over there
just be a little careful here
mummy real training happens
with a lot of freedom
not with so many restrictions
we watch movies
television eat out too
my performance hasnt suffered
i am the topmost wrestler
at the nsa
you home wrestler
-how are you
-i am fine papa
how your training going
she going to sydney for a fight
how your training going
it going very well papa
youve seen
i am learning a lot of new things
new strategy moves
technique
very good
i have thought that
i will teach her some things too
after all she too has to
win the nationals
youve grown your hair
-papa
-no
it good
dont just attack
youve to defend too
hold me
now how will you free yourself
hold this way break and attack got that
that an old technique
let me
hold me
tight
push your thumbs in this way
and move it to the side
not in the front but to the side
break and attack
what wrong with my technique
what wrong
no papa it not wrong
this is more correct
coach sir has taught it
so now you are an expert
international
papa i was
id like to know what is it that
your coach sir has taught you
that your father couldnt
not her show me
come on
push your thumbs in this way
so this is what your coach sir
has taught you
is this how youll win
an international medal
i wasnt ready papa
so get ready
this is what i was saying papa
isnt there a difference
what happened today
wasnt right
what wasnt right
this was bound to happen
someone had to tell papa
that his techniques are weak
his techniques arent weak
he become a little weak
and dont forget that
youve won the nationals
based on his weak techniques
you can win the nationals
with these techniques babita
not international matches
and the sooner
you realize this the better
all right
you keep faith in your techniques
i still put my faith in papa
i pray to god that you fight
well at the nationals
and i pray that you do well
in your international tournament
this world
is a lie
true is my pain
mirage-like my beloved
is our bond
those eyes
that dreamt
beautiful dreams together
they tear up in separation now
those eyes
that stayed awake nights together
refuse to awaken
even in the mornings
separated are the paths
of those who pledged
to walk together always
now they share only sorrow
those misty eyes
that peered through
windows with hope
are now suffocated
with despair
the breath is unsettled
with thoughts that torment
why is this soul in disarray
why this despair
this disheartenment
why is the heart filled with
the storm of a million questions
those eyes
that shone brightly like
stars in the sky
have now disappeared
in the dark night
those eyes
that used to feast
on the warmth of the sun
tired now seek the shade
separated are the paths
of those who pledged
to walk together always
now they share only sorrow
those misty eyes
that peered through
windows with hope
are now suffocated with despair
world championship sydney

youll have a new coach
and your papa once again
will become old
no papa
never forget

this is the lounge
here we chill and watch tv
where is the training center
my arent you eager
see it tomorrow
rest today
can i say something
dont feel offended
tell me
youve changed a lot
i remember the first time
you lost a match
you couldnt sleep all night
and now in spite of losing an
international fight you are
i mean it doesnt show
at all on your face
has papa trained you
to say this
i remember papa training
very well
it seems youve forgotten
you focus on your training
i will manage mine
and why are you lecturing me
ive only lost one match
moscow
geeta kumari is trailing
in the second round as well
she fought well
but hasnt managed much
geeta tries
but kasha scores one point
and that it
geeta kumari makes an early exit
from the world championship
what a disappointment
yet another defeat for
india geeta kumari phogat
in jakarta too geeta exits
in the first round
a humiliating defeat for geeta
in the istanbul world championship
she will have to wait longer to win
an international medal
geeta dont lose hope
weve worked very hard
and you played well
you just couldnt win
it doesnt mean you are
a bad wrestler
it happens
some people are not made
for international victory
do you feel too
that i am not cut out
for an international medal
i dont know about that
all i know
is that you are the girl
who thrashed boys
in mud wrestling
you are the girl
who in spite of being
underweight won sub-juniors
you beat everyone at the nationals
for three straight years
if you are not cut out
for international victory
then i dont know
which girl in india is
i have a lot of faith in you
but it nothing compared to
the faith that papa has in you
talk to him once
how do i face him
he our papa
at worst what will happen
he will give you an earful
take it

so wrestle o wrestler
wrestle o wrestler

straight attacks wont do
you have to play with
the opponent mind
fake a move
but make another
sir
sir i had put her on a diet
but i dont know why
it hasnt reduced
what have you been up to geeta
will you say something
or just keep crying
sir judging by their actions
i feel they dont need nsa
the rest is up to you
do you all have anything to say
so you admit you are at fault
sir they have just one fault
that their father is crazy
he is so crazy about getting
a gold for the country
that in their childhood itself
he snatched away their toys
and made them wrestle
when they resisted
he cut their hair off
in order to prepare them
he made them wrestle boys
took the taunts and abuses
of the entire village
just so that one day they would
make the country proud
look sir
look
these 50 rupees
she won at rohtak
this in hisar
this in chandigarh
this this all this sir
these girls have traveled
a long way to reach here sir
now dont tell them to turn back
it all my fault
i humbly apologize
coach-sir is just concerned
with getting three medals
no matter if they are bronze
but i want our country
to win gold
and this girl can do it sir
all of you please wait outside
youve made a mistake
by wasting time
in 55 kilos geeta wont even
get selected for india
if she had fought in the 5 kilos
she couldve won a medal
she shouldve won a medal
much earlier in 55 kilos itself
you are responsible for that
what did i do wrong
geeta natural game is attacking
by putting technique above instinct
youve changed her game
it like telling a tiger
to fight like an elephant
youll be left with neither
a tiger nor an elephant
so why dont you tell me
how to fight to win a medal
with your permission i would like to
demonstrate it here and now
theyre calling you inside
what happened was wrong
but the committee has decided
to give them another chance
thank you sir
but from today
neither are you allowed
to enter the nsa premises
nor are they allowed
to step out
ok sir
today make one for me too uncle
sorry
thank you
we had come to play the lead role
nsa made ours
a guest appearance
let head back now
no omkar
they can stop me
from going inside
but no one can stop me
from coaching geeta
cheers uncle
against three of them
i held my own
but the one who
took me to the cleaners
she was smaller than me
and not that strong either
but she beat me by nine points
do you have a recording
of this match
yes papa in the library
courier me a copy of all of them
only three months remain
for the delhi commonwealth games
and the fervor can be sensed at the
national sports academy in patiala
where are we going uncle
the one thing
i disliked about uncle
was his constant
air of suspense
it could kill you
crazycougarcom
the lustful aunt
if you want to watch a movie
let go to amar mahal
they dont show decent films here
get off
wild daughter
-yes
-how much for all the tickets
of the next show
which film do you
want to watch
weve brought it with us
pause
play
are you done
be happy
your next show is sold-out too
what are you guys up to
i mean where is the movie from
atlanta indonesia
-imported
-yes
listen can i make a copy
give me 50 rupees less
how will she win
if she fights like this
uncle
uncle youve gathered
the knowledge
but how will you pass it on
nsa has issued a hoot-at-sight
order against you
sit
again suspense
is this how you fight
like a quivering kitten
if this is how you want to fight
then dont
what happened papa
i saw all your matches
you werent wrestling
that for sure
do you have copies of
the dvds that you gave me
yes papa
can you arrange to watch
them alone
ill borrow a laptop
all right
be ready at 5 am tomorrow
it been a while since
papa gave me an earful
felt good
play the jakarta fight round one
i have papa
go to three minutes 58 seconds
you have a lead
of two points
and you started
playing defensive
play look
threw away the lead didnt you
when the opponent is trailing
go for the jugular
how did you do that
alternately when you should be defending
you are attacking and giving away points
you will gain nothing by
desperately chasing after points
youll have to apply your mind
youve lost matches
that were yours to win
go geeta
national trials patiala
each round consists of two minutes
however there are 20 seconds
in those two minutes
wait for that one second
when the opponent makes a mistake
she good isnt she
yes sir
very good
now you look ready sis
did you tell papa
what did he say
there no need to get too happy
a grand opening ceremony
to the 200 commonwealth games
host nation india displaying
her ancient culture
a proud moment indeed
and here comes
the indian contingent
a huge welcome for them
let us remind you that
the finest athletes
from 72 countries are participating
well be back tomorrow
to start off the events
until then goodnight
geeta was quite nervous
before her first bout
and that was expected
so far her performance
in international events had been poor
however little the nation
still had hopes for her
and this was probably
geeta last opportunity
to prove herself
the first match in women wrestling
55 kilo category is between
india geeta kumari and
melissa anderson from wales
go geeta
geeta seems quite nervous
now let see if she can
break her jinx
of losing in the first
couple of rounds
we would like to remind
our spectators
that there will be three rounds
of two minutes each
whoever wins two rounds
wins the match
with that the match begins
both the wrestlers are quite alert
neither of them wish to lose a point
a great attack by melissa
geeta is in trouble
one point to melissa
melissa ; geeta 0
melissa seems stronger
three more points to melissa
what are you doing geeta
melissa 4; geeta 0
if geeta gives away
2 more points
melissa will win this round
on technical superiority
geeta making an effort
but melissa still has the advantage
and melissa gets two points
exactly as we feared
melissa has won the first round
on technical superiority; 6-0
what are you doing geeta
dont lose so badly
we now need to see that
after losing the first round badly
is geeta capable of making
a comeback in round two
geeta with a good attack
melissa makes a counter-attack
two points to melissa
one more point to melissa
the match seems to be
slipping out of geeta hands
you are not to lose geeta
come on geeta
geeta lagging by three points
shell have to score real quick
geeta making an effort
but she got no points for that
this is a good opportunity
two points to geeta
melissa 3; geeta 2
geeta tries to score some more
but the referee blows the whistle
the round is nearing completion
geeta is still behind by a point
come on geeta
it looks as though geeta is about to be
disqualified in the first round
geeta in trouble
geeta gets three points
geeta 5; melissa 3
just four seconds to go
yes geeta
geeta back in the match
it one round each
geeta has shown that she is not
going to accept defeat so easily
it the last round
play defensive
got it
play attacking
and the last round begins
geeta on the attack
one point for geeta
geeta ; melissa 0
geeta has the stronger offense
geeta makes an attack but cant score
another attack
two more points in geeta kitty
geeta3; melissa 0
will she manage to keep her lead
very good defend now
geeta is still on the attack
geeta makes an attack melissa counters
geeta is in a tight spot
three points for melissa
i told you to defend
no problem
keep attacking
the score is equal at 3-3
go for it geeta
this match can tilt either way
geeta was poised to win
but lost her lead
both the wrestlers on edge
geeta in danger
-counter-attack
-wow what a move
three points to geeta
keep her down geeta
just a few more seconds
for the match to end
can geeta keep her there
geeta has won this match
india geeta kumari phogat
has proven her critics wrong
a proud moment for geeta father
mahavir singh phogat
and a proud moment for the country
so far india has won
five gold 3 silver
and seven bronze medals
in women wrestling
india geeta kumari phogat
has entered the semi-finals
of the 55 kilo category
geeta will now face
nigeria naomi edwards
two time world champion
what do you think
naomi is a very strong wrestler
extremely aggressive and attacking
she doesnt give any
opportunity to her opponent
it not going to be easy
for geeta this time
today you played as per your will
now do as i say
or it impossible to win
it a difficult one
but not impossible
youll have to play offensive
you have to play defensive
just go for the points
dont go for the points
youll get a lot of opportunities
dont give her any opportunities
because she wont give you any
force a lock-jam each time
if she doesnt get to score
shell get frustrated
and will give you an opportunity
that the moment
we should grab
the first semi-final match in
the 55 kilo category
india geeta kumari
versus nigeria naomi edwards
naomi attacking from the start
and against her nature
geeta playing defensive
naomi attacks
geeta in trouble
geeta putting up a strong defense
naomi trying to break free

i prayed for her
tomorrow is the final
bless you
how can we allow this sir
mahavir singh is shouting instructions
to geeta from the audience
the poor thing is getting confused
whether to listen to him or me
from her game it sure doesnt
seem like she confused
besides how can we ask
the audience to remain silent
arent you the coach
she should be listening to you
no sir she is listening to me
-that why she winning
-then what the problem
you wanted a bronze right
it quite possible that
tomorrow she may win gold
no
i am surprised she made it so far
but i am happy for her
it should be an interesting
final tomorrow
playing an indian
in front of an indian crowd
beating her of course
angelina any pressure
before the finals
yeah i am sure she must be
under tremendous pressure
ive beaten her twice
-first round
-yeah
yeah first round
so thank you and
namaste
what the strategy
for tomorrow papa
there is only one strategy
for tomorrow child
you have to fight in a way
that people remember you
if you win silver
sooner or later
youll be forgotten
if you win gold
you will become an example
and examples are given child
not forgotten
see those girls
if you win tomorrow
you will not win alone
millions of girls like them
will win along with you
itll be a victory for every girl who
is considered inferior to boys;
who is forced
into household chores
who is married off
to just raise children

the most important one
because tomorrow you wont be
fighting just that australian
