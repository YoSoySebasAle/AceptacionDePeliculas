
robert i shall
tell you of william wallace
historians from england
will say i am a liar
but history is written by those
who have hanged heroes
the king of scotland
had died without a son
and the king of england
a cruel pagan known
as edward the longshanks
claimed the throne
of scotland for himself
scotland nobles fought him
and fought each other over the crown
so longshanks invited them
to talks of truce
no weapons one page only
among the farmers of that
shire was malcolm wallace
a commoner with his own lands
he had two sons john and william
i told you to stay
well i finished my work
where are we going
macandrews he was supposed
to visit when the gathering was over
can i come
no go home boy
but i want to go

or youll feel the back of my hand
go you home william
horse whinnying

shuddering
whispering william
gasping
man  and i say we hit back now
man 2 we cannot fight them
it suicide
man 3 something got to be done
wallace is right we fight them
every nobleman who had
a will to fight was at that meeting
we cannot beat an army
not with 50 farmers
we do not have to beat them
just fight them
now who with me
i am wallace
all right all right
ready
men chattering
where do you think youre going
im going with you
youre going with me are you
and what are you going to do
im gonna help
laughs
and a good help youd be too
but i need you to stay here and look
after the place for me while im away
i can fight
i know
i know you can fight
but it our wits that make us men

chuckles
laughing

screaming

grunting
laughing
faint screams
rooster crowing
da

campbell william

praying in latin
amen
men amen
women amen
thunder rumbling
horse whinnies
william
im your uncle argyle
you have the look of your mother
well stay here tonight
tomorrow youll come home with me
i dont want to leave
you didnt want your father
to die either did you
but it happened
did the priest give a poetic benediction
the lord bless thee and keep thee
it was in latin
you dont speak latin
well that something
we shall have to remedy isnt it
argyle the lord
bless thee and keep thee
the lord cause his
light to shine on thee
the lord lift up his countenance
upon thee and give thee peace
amen
your heart is free
have the courage to follow it
thunder rumbling
bagpipes playing
what are they doing
saying goodbye in their own way
playing outlawed tunes
on outlawed pipes
it was the same for me and your
daddy when our father was killed
first learn to use this
then ill teach you to use this
robert many years later
edward the longshanks
king of england
supervised the wedding
of his eldest son
who would succeed him to the throne
amen
robert as bride for his son
longshanks had chosen
the daughter of his rival
the king of france
choir singing in latin
robert it was widely whispered
that for the princess to conceive
longshanks would have
to do the honours himself
that may have been
what he had in mind all along
scotland
my land
the french will grovel
to anyone with strength
but how will they believe our strength
when we cannot rule
the whole of our own island
where is my son
your pardon milord
he asked me to come in his stead
i sent for him and he sends you
shall i leave milord
if he wants his queen
to rule when i am gone
then by all means stay and learn how
please
nobles
nobles are the key
to the door of scotland
grant our nobles lands in the north
give their nobles
estates here in england
and make them too greedy to oppose us
but sire our nobles
will be reluctant to uproot
new lands mean new taxes
and theyre already taxed
for the war in france
are they
are they
the trouble with scotland
is that it full of scots
men laughing
perhaps the time has come
to reinstitute an old custom
grant them  prima nocte
first night
when any common girl
inhabiting their lands is married
our nobles shall have sexual rights
to her on the night of her wedding
if we cant get them out
well breed them out
that should fetch just the kind
of lords we want to scotland
taxes or no taxes
a most excellent idea sire
is it
people chattering
robert now in edinburgh
were gathered the council
of scottish nobles
among these was robert
the 7th earl of bruce
a leading contender
for the crown of scotland
i hear that longshanks
has granted  prima nocte
clearly meant to draw
more of his supporters here
my father believes that we must
lull longshanks into our confidence
by neither supporting
his decree nor opposing it
a wise plan
and how is your father
we missed him at the council
his affairs in france
keep him long overdue
but he sends his greetings
and he says that i speak for all
of the bruces and for scotland
inhaling
festive music playing
people cheering
music stops
man it all over now
youve dropped your rock
test of manhood
you win
call it a test of soldiery then
the english wont let
us train with weapons
so we train with stones
the test of a soldier is not in his arm
it here
no it here
crowd gasping

and ordering it opposed
from our lands in the south
sit down stay awhile
this wallace
he doesnt even have a knighthood
but he fights with passion
and he inspires
chuckles and you wish to
charge off and fight as he did

youre the 7th robert bruce
the 6 before you
passed you land and title
because they didnt charge in
call a meeting of the nobles
they do nothing but talk
rightly so
theyre as rich in english titles
and lands as they are in scottish
just as we are
you admire this man
this william wallace
uncompromising men
are easy to admire
he has courage so does a dog
but it is exactly the ability to
compromise that makes a man noble
and understand this
edward longshanks is
the most ruthless king
ever to sit on the throne of england
and none of us and nothing of scotland
will remain unless we are as ruthless
give ear to our nobles
knowing their minds
is the key to the throne
groaning

to come back here and tell our enemies
that they may take our lives
but theyll never take our freedom
men cheering
shouting in foreign language
men cheering

one of you will die today
laughing
you are outmatched
you have no heavy cavalry
in two centuries no army has won
im not finished
before we let you leave
your commander must cross that field
present himself before this army
put his head between his legs
and kiss his own arse
id say that was rather less
cordial than he was used to
you be ready and do exactly as i say
on my signal ride round behind

sir william in the name of god
we declare and appoint thee
guardian and high protector of scotland
and thy captains as aides-de-camp
stand and be recognized
cheering
does anyone know his politics
no but his weight with the commoners
could unbalance everything
the balliols will kiss
his arse and so we must
sir william
sir william
inasmuch as you and your
captains hail from a region
long known to support the balliol clan
may we invite you to continue your
support and uphold our rightful claim
damn the balliol clan
theyre all longshanks men
gentlemen
gentlemen
now is the time to declare a king
wait and youre prepared to recognize
our legitimate succession i take it
youre the ones
who wont support the rightful king
those were lies
when you first wrote them
no
man that the truth
i demand recognition
of these documents
these documents were lies
when you wrote them
men shouting
gentlemen please gentlemen
please gentlemen
wait sir william
where are you going
we have beaten the english
but theyll come back
because you wont stand together
what will you do
i will invade england and defeat
the english on their own ground
scoffs invade that impossible
why why is that impossible
youre so concerned with squabbling
for the scraps from longshanks table
that youve missed your
god-given right to something better
there a difference between us
you think the people of this country
exist to provide you with position
i think your position exists
to provide those people with freedom
and i go to make sure that they have it
men chattering
robert wait
i respect what you said
but remember that these
men have lands and castles
it much to risk
and the common man
that bleeds on the battlefield
does he risk less
no
but from top to bottom
this country has got no sense of itself
its nobles share allegiance with england
its clans war with each other
aye
aye
if you make enemies
on both sides of the border
youll end up dead
we all end up dead
it just a question of how and why
im not a coward
i want what you want
but we need the nobles
we need them
aye
nobles
laughs now tell me
what does that mean to be noble
your title gives you claim
to the throne of our country
but men dont follow titles
they follow courage
now our people know you
noble and common they respect you
and if you would
just lead them to freedom
theyd follow you
and so would i
damn it
my sodomite cousin the prince
tells me he has no troops to lend

england is begging for help

all cheering
soldier make way for the king
it not your fault
stand up to him
i will stand up to him and more
footsteps approaching
sighs
what news of the north
nothing new your majesty
weve sent riders to speed any word
i heard the word in france
where i was fighting
to expand your future kingdom
the word my son is that our
entire northern army is annihilated
and you have done nothing
i have ordered conscriptions sir
theyre assembled and ready to depart
excuse me sire but there
a very urgent message from york
come
leave us
thank you sire
wallace has sacked york
what
wallace has sacked york
exclaims
sire thy own nephew
what beast could do such a thing
if he can sack york
he can invade lower england
we would stop him
who is this person who speaks to
me as though i needed his advice
i have declared
phillip my high counselor
is he qualified
i am skilled in the arts of
war and military tactics sire
are you
then tell me what advice would
you offer on the present situation
screaming
grunts
consume
i shall offer a truce
and buy him off
edward crying
but who will go to him
not i
if i fell under the sword
of that murderer
it might be my head in a basket
and not my gentle son
the mere sight of him
would only encourage an enemy
to take over the whole country
edward coughing
so whom do i send
whom do i send
leaves rustling
exclaims
im dreaming
yes you are
and you must wake
i dont want to wake
i want to stay here with you
and i with you
but you must wake now
wake up william
wake up
william wake up wake up
campbell; william
a royal entourage comes
flying banners of truce
and the standards
of longshanks himself
i am the princess of wales
i come as the king servant
and with his authority
to do what
to discuss the king proposals
will you speak with a woman
i understand you have recently
been given the rank of knight
i have been given nothing
god makes men what they are
did god make you
the sacker of peaceful cities
the executioner of the king nephew
my husband own cousin
york was the staging point
for every invasion of my country
and that royal cousin
hanged innocent scots
even women and children
from the city walls
longshanks did far worse
the last time he took a scottish city
speaking latin
speaking latin
speaking french
you ask your king to his face ask him
you see if his eyes can
convince you of the truth
hamilton leave us
milady
leave us now
let us talk plainly
you invade england
but you cannot complete the conquest
so far from your shelter and supply
the king desires peace
longshanks desires peace
he declares it to me i swear it
he proposes that you
withdraw your attack
in return he grants you title estates
and this chest of gold
which i am to pay to you personally
a lordship and titles gold
that i should become judas
peace is made in such ways
slaves are made in such ways
the last time longshanks
spoke of peace i was a boy
and many scottish nobles
who would not be slaves
were lured by him under a flag of truce
to a barn where he had them hanged
i was very young
but i remember longshanks
notion of peace
i understand you have suffered
i know about your woman
she was my wife
we married in secret because i would
not share her with an english lord
they killed her to get to me
sighs
i have never spoken of it
i dont know why i tell you now
except i see her strength in you
one day youll be a queen
and you must open your eyes
you tell your king that
william wallace will not be ruled
and nor will any scot while i live
my son loyal wife
returns unkilled by the heathen
so he accepted our bribe
no he did not
then why does he stay
my scouts tell me
that he has not advanced
he waits for you at york
he says he will attack
no more towns or cities
if you are man enough
to come and face him
did he
the welsh bowmen
will not be detected
arriving so far around his flank
the main force of our armies
from france will land here
to the north of edinburgh
conscripts from ireland will
approach from the southwest to here
welsh bowmen troops from france
irish conscripts
even if you dispatch them today
theyd take weeks to assemble
i dispatched them before i sent your wife
so our little ruse succeeded thank you
and while this upstart
awaits my arrival in york
my forces will have arrived
in edinburgh behind him
you spoke with this wallace in private
tell me
what kind of man is he
a mindless barbarian
not a king like you milord
you may return to your embroidery
humbly milord
you brought back
the money of course
no
i gave it to ease the suffering
of the children of this war
laughing
that what happens
when you send a woman
forgive me sire
i thought that generosity
might demonstrate your greatness
to those you mean to rule
coughs
my greatness will be
better demonstrated
when wallace returns to scotland
and finds his country in ashes
consume
william there riders approaching
personal escort of the princess
aye
must have made an impression
aye
i didnt think
you were in the tent that long
mademoiselle
both speaking french
it true english ships are
moving up from the south
i dont know about the welsh
yet but the irish have landed
i had to see it with me own
eyes before i could believe it
what the hell are the irish
doing fighting with the english
i wouldnt worry about them
didnt i tell you before
it my island
hamish ride ahead to edinburgh
and assemble the council
order it
aye
shouts
your island
my island yup
craig you want to negotiate
no please gentlemen
lords craig is right
this time our only
option is to negotiate
now unless you want to see
edinburgh razed to the ground
my army has marched for
more days than i can remember
and we still have preparations
to make so ill make this plain
we require every soldier
you can summon
your personal escorts
even yourselves
and we need them now
with such a force arrayed against us
it time to discuss other options
other options
dont you wish at least to
lead your men onto the field
and barter a better deal with longshanks
before you tuck tail and run
sir william
we cant defeat this army
we can and we will
sir william
we won at stirling
and still you quibble
we won at york
and you would not support us
if youll not stand up with us now
then i say youre cowards
and if you are scotsmen
im ashamed to call myself one
please sir william
speak with me alone
i beg you
now youve achieved
more than anyone ever dreamed
but fighting these odds
it looks like rage not courage
it well beyond rage
help me
in the name of christ help yourselves
now is our chance now
if we join we can win
if we win well then well have
what none of us have ever had before
a country of our own
youre the rightful leader and
there is strength in you i see it
unite us
unite us unite the clans
all right
right
this cannot be the way
you said yourself
the nobles will not support wallace
so how does it help us to join
the side that is slaughtered
i gave him my word
i know it is hard
being a leader is
now son
son look at me
i cannot be king
you and you alone can rule scotland
what i tell you you must do
not for me not for yourself
for your country
hamish lads make way
coming through you
make way lads make
men chattering
the bruce is not coming william
hell come
mornay and lochlan have come
so will the bruce
quite a lovely gathering
wouldnt you agree
the archers are ready sire
not the archers
my scouts tell me their archers
are miles away and no threat to us
arrows cost money use up the irish
the dead cost nothing
and send in the infantry and cavalry

ive lived long enough to live free
proud to see you
become the man you are
im a happy man
sniffing
im the one who rotting
but i think your face
looks graver than mine
son
we must have alliance
with england to prevail here
you achieved that
you saved your family
increased your land
in time you will have
all the power in scotland
lands titles men power nothing
nothing
i have nothing
men fight for me
because if they do not
i throw them off my land
and i starve their wives
and their children
those men who bled
the ground red at falkirk
they fought for william wallace
and he fights for something
that ive never had
and i took it from him
when i betrayed him
and i saw it in his face on the battlefield
and it tearing me apart
all men betray all lose heart
i dont want to lose heart
i want to believe as he does
i will never be on the wrong side again
snores
gasps
shuddering
shouts
no please
men yelling
man there he is after him
shouts
shouts
lord craig is it true about mornay
aye
wallace rode into his
bedchamber and killed him
more a liability now than ever he was
and there no telling wholl be next
maybe you
maybe me
laughs
it doesnt matter
im serious robert
so am i
christ shit search the place
lochlan
william wallace killed 50 men
fifty if it was one
a hundred men with his own sword
cut through them like
moses through the red sea
hamilton his legend grows
it will be worse than before
he rallies new volunteers
in every scottish town
and when he replenishes
his numbers
theyre sheep mere sheep
easily dispersed
if we strike the shepherd
very well
pick a flock of your finest
assassins and set a meeting
milord wallace is renowned
for his ability to smell an ambush
if what lord hamilton tells me is correct
he warmed to our future
queen and would trust her
so well dispatch her with the
notion that she comes in peace
milord the princess
might be taken hostage
or her life be put in jeopardy
my son would be most distressed by that
but in truth if she were to be killed
we would soon find the king of france
a useful ally against the scots
you see as king you must
find the good in any situation
it william wallace sure
he given up his sword
be ready
grunting
screaming
screaming
milady
i received your message
this is the second time
you have warned me of danger
why
there will be a new shipment of
supplies coming north next month
foods and weapons they wont
no stop
why do you help me
why do you help me
because of the way
you are looking at me now
laboured breathing
stephen just when we
thought all hope was lost
our noble saviours have arrived
off with their hoods
sir william
weve come to seek a meeting
well what the point
youve all sworn loyalty to longshanks
an oath to a liar is no oath at all
every man of us is ready
to swear loyalty to you
so let the council swear publicly
we cannot
some scarcely believe youre alive
others think youll pay
them mornay wages
so we bid you to edinburgh
meet us two days from now
pledge us your pardon
and well unite behind you
scotland will be one
one you mean us and you
no
i mean this
it the pledge of robert the bruce
you do know it a trap tell him
i think if the bruce wanted to kill you
hed have done it already at falkirk
aye
i know i saw
leaving him aside
what about the others
nest of scheming bastards
they couldnt even agree
on the colour of shite
it a trap are you blind
look at us
weve got to try
we cant do this alone
joining the nobles is the
only hope for our people
you know what happens
if we dont take that chance
what
nothing
i dont want to be a martyr
nor i i want to live
i want a home and children and peace
do you
aye i do
ive asked god for those things
it all for nothing
if you dont have freedom
that just a dream william
a dream just a
laughs then what
have we been doing all this time
weve lived that dream
your dream isnt about freedom
it about murron
youre doing this to be a hero
cause you think she sees you
i dont think she sees me
i know she does
and your father sees you too
grunts
jesus
get up give us your hand
coughs
shall i come with you
no ill go alone
ill see you after
right
sooner rather than later i hope
he wont come
he will
i know he will
man milord he approaches
no
grunting
stay out of it robert
shouts
you lied you lied
bruce is not to be hurt
that the arrangement
father
you rotting bastard
why why
longshanks required wallace
so did our nobles
that was the price of your crown
die
i want you to die
soon enough ill be dead
and youll be king
i dont want anything from you
youre not a man
and youre not my father
youre my son and you
have always known my mind
you deceived me
you let yourself be deceived
in your heart you always knew
what had to happen here
at last you know
what it means to hate
now youre ready to be a king
my hate will die with you
william wallace
you stand in taint of high treason
against whom
against your king
have you anything to say
never in my whole life
did i swear allegiance to him
it matters not he is your king
confess and you may
receive a quick death
deny and you must
be purified by pain
do you confess
do you confess
exhales
then on the morrow
you shall receive your purification
your highness
i will see the prisoner
weve got orders
from the king that nobody
the king will be dead in a month
and his son is a weakling
who do you think will rule this kingdom
now open this door
majesty-
guard come on filth
up on your feet
stop it
leave me
i said leave me
milady
sir i come to beg you
to confess all and swear allegiance to
the king that he might show you mercy
will he show mercy to my country
mercy is to die quickly
perhaps even live in a tower
in time who knows what can happen
if you can only live
if i swear to him
then all that i am is dead already
sobs
you will die it will be awful
every man dies
not every man really lives
drink this
it will dull your pain
no it will numb my wits
and i must have them all
for if im senseless or if i wail
then longshanks will have broken me
i cant bear the thought of your torture
take it
all right
i have come to beg for
the life of william wallace
scoffs
youre quite taken with him arent you
i respect him
at worst he was a worthy enemy
show mercy o thou great king
and win the respect of your own people
gasps
even now
you are incapable of mercy
laboured breathing
and you
to you that word
is as unfamiliar as love
before he lost his powers of speech
he told me his one comfort was
that he would live to
know wallace was dead
you see
death comes to us all
but before it comes to you know this
your blood dies with you
a child who is not of
your line grows in my belly
your son will not sit
long on the throne i swear it
laboured breathing
gurgling
crowd clamouring
crowd exclaiming
im so afraid
give me the strength to die well
crowd booing
man here he comes
shouting
now behold the awful price of treason
crowd cheering
you will fall to your knees now
declare yourself the king loyal subject
and beg his mercy
crowd murmuring
and you shall have it
rope
crowd cheering
consume
vomiting
stretch him
that it stretch him
gasping
man shame shame
cheering
consume
gasping
pleasant yes
gasping
rise to your knees
kiss the royal emblem on my cloak
and you will feel no more
inhaling
rack him
crowd cheering
crowd continues cheering
grunting

gasping
it can all end right now
peace
gasping

crowd shouting

the prisoner wishes to say a word

gasping
freedom
robert after the beheading
william wallace body
was torn to pieces
his head was set on london bridge
his arms and legs sent to the
four corners of britain as a warning
it did not have the effect
that longshanks planned
and i robert the bruce
rode out to pay homage
to the armies of the english king
and accept his endorsement
of my crown
i hope youve washed
your arse this morning
it about to be kissed by a king
come let get it over with
stop
you have bled with wallace
now bleed with me
groans
shouts
wallace wallace
all chanting
wallace wallace
wallace wallace
wallace wallace
wallace wallace
men shouting
william in the year of our lord 34
patriots of scotland
starving and outnumbered
charged the fields of bannockburn
they fought like warrior poets
they fought like scotsmen
and won their freedom
