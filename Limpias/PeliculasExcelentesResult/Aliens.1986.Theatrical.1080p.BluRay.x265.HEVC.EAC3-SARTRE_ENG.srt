im glad to see youre
feeling a little better
they tell me that all the weakness
and disorientation should pass soon
that just natural side effects of such an
unusually long hypersleep or something like that
what do you mean
how long was i out there
inhalation therapy report to-
has no one discussed
this with you yet
no but i mean
i dont recognize this place
no i know uh-
okay it just that
this might be a shock to you
it long-
how long
please
57 years
what
that the thing
you were out there for 57 years
what happened was you had drifted
right through the core systems
and it really
just blind luck
that a deep-salvage team
found you when they did
it one in a thousand really
i think youre damn lucky to be alive kiddo
you could be floating out there forever
you-you okay
uuh

ive slept enough
jonesy
come here
shh
it all right
it all right now
it over
id just like to go -
back to this point about
the override destruct order
is it in the file
i dont understand this
we have been here
for three and a half hours
now how many different ways do
you want me to tell the same story
look at it from our
perspective please
please
now you freely admit to
detonating the engines of
and thereby destroying
an m-class starfreighter
a rather expensive piece
of hardware
forty-two million
in adjusted dollars
that minus payload of course
the lifeboat flight recorder
corroborates some elements of your account
in that for reasons unknown
the nostromo set down on lv-426
an unsurveyed planet at that time
that it resumed its course
and was subsequently set for
self-destruct by you for reasons unknown
not for reasons unknown
i told you
we set down there on company orders to
get this thing which destroyed my crew
and your expensive ship
the analysis team which went over
the lifeboat centimeter by centimeter
found no physical evidence
of the creature you describe
good that because i blew it
out of the goddamn air lock
like i said
are there any species like this
hostile organism on lv-426
no it a rock
no indigenous life
did iq just drop sharply
while i was away
maam i already said
it was not indigenous
it was a derelict spacecraft
it was an alien ship
it was not from there do you get it
we homed in on its beacon
and found something
never recorded once
in over 300 surveyed worlds
a creature that gestates
inside a living human host
yes
these are your words
and has concentrated acid for blood
that right
look i can see
where this is going
but im telling you
that those things exist
thank you officer ripley that will be all
please youre not listening to me
kane the crew member-
kane who went into that ship
said he saw thousands of eggs there
thousands
thank you that will be all
goddamn it that not all
because if one of those things gets down
here then that will be all
then all of thisthis bullshit
that you think is so important-
you can just kiss
all of that good-bye
that could have been better
look i think theripley
van leuwen
why dont you
just check out lv-426
because i dont have to
there have been people there for over 20 years
and they never complained
about any hostile organism
what do you mean what people
terraformers planet engineers
they go in set up these big atmosphere
processors to make the air breathable
takes decades
it what we call
a shake n bake colony
how many are there
how many colonists
i dont know-60 maybe 70 families
do you mind
families
jesus
hiya ripley
this is lieutenant gorman
of the colonial marine corps-
ripley we have to talk
weve lost contact
with the colony on lv-426
i dont believe this
you guys throw me at the wolves
and now you want me to go back out there
forget it it not my problem
can i finish
no there no way
ripley you wouldnt be
going in with the troops
i can guarantee your safety
these colonial marines
are very tough hombres
theyre packing
state-of-the-art firepower
there nothing
they cant handle
lieutenant am i right
that true
weve been trained to deal
with situations like this
then you dont need me
im not a soldier
yeah but we dont know exactly
what going on out there
it may just be a downed
transmitter okay
but if it not
i would like you there as an adviser
and that all
look i dont have time for this
ive got to get going go to work
right i heard youre
working the cargo docks
that right
running loaders and
forklifts that sort of thing
yeah so
nothing i think it great
that youre keeping busy
and i know it the only
thing that you could get
there nothing wrong with it
what would you say if i told you
i could get you reinstated
as a flight officer
the company already agreed
to pick up your contract
if i go
yeah if you go

it would be the best thing in the world
to get out there and face this
thing get back on the horse

night your sheets are soaking with sweat-

hello
ripley

boy definitely got
a corncob up his ass
thought you never miss bishop
you never said anything about an
android being on board why not
it nevernever occurred to me
it just common practice
we always have a synthetic on board
i prefer the term
artificial person myself
right
is there a problem
im sorry
i dont know why i didnt even-
ripley last trip out
the syn-the artificial person malfunctioned
malfunctioned
there were problems and
a few deaths were involved
im shocked
was it an older model
the hyperdyne systems
that explains it then
the a2s always were a bit twitchy
that could never happen now
with our behavioral inhibitors
it is impossible for me to harm or by omission
of action allow to be harmed a human being
you sure you dont want some
you just stay away from me
bishop you got that straight
guess she dont like
the corn bread either
squad ten-hut
officer on deck as you were
quickly quickly settle down
all right listen up
morning marines im sorry we didnt have time
to brief you people before we left gateway-
sir
what is it hicks
hudson sir he hicks
what the question
is this gonna be a stand-up
fight sir or another bug hunt
all we know is that there still
no contact with the colony
and that a xenomorph
may be involved
excuse me sir a what
a xenomorph
it a bug hunt
what exactly are we dealing with here
ripley
ill tell you what i know
we set down on lv-426
one of our crew members was brought back on
board with something attached to his face
some kind of parasite
we tried to get it off
it wouldnt come off
later it seemed to come off
by itself and die
kane seemed fine
we were all having dinner
and um
it must have laid something inside his
throat some sort of embryo
he started-um he-
look man
i only need to know one
thingwhere they are
yo vasquez
kick ass anytime anywhere
right right somebody said alien she
thought they said illegal alien and signed up
fuck you man
anytime anywhere
are you finished
i hope youre right
i really do
yeah okay right
thank you ripley
we also have ripley report on disk
i suggest you study it
because just one of those things managed to
wipe out my entire crew in less than 24 hours
and if the colonists have found that
ship then there no telling
how many of them
have been exposed
do you understand
anyway we have it on disk
so you better look at it
any questions

sing a couple of songs why dont we try that
wed better get back
cause itll be dark soon
and they mostly
come at night mostly
that everything right all right
this is absolutely everything
that we could salvage
out of the apc wreckage
we got four pulse rifles
with about 50 rounds each
that aint so good
we got
5 of these m-40 grenades
dont touch that
dangerous honey

seventeen days
seventeen days
hey man i dont wanna rain on your
parade but were not gonna last 7 hours
those things are gonna come in here like
they did before theyre gonna come in here-
hudson hudson
theyre gonna come in here
and theyre gonna get us
this little girl
survived longer than that
with no weapons and no training
right
why dont you put her in charge
youd better just start dealing with
it hudson listen to me
hudson just deal with it
because we need you
and im sick of your bullshit
now i want you to get on a terminal and
call up some kind of floor plan file
do you understand
construction blueprints i dont care
anything that shows the layout of this place
are you listening
yeah
i need to see air ducts
i need to see electrical access
tunnels subbasements
every possible way
into this complex
we dont have much time
okay
okay im on it
hudson
just relax
ill be in medlab ill check
on gorman continue my analysis
fine you do that
so this service tunnel must be
how theyre moving back and forth
that right
it moves from the processing station
right into the sublevel here
come down on that
okay come over
hold go back
okay punch that in right there
no it back here
okay
well there a pressure
door at this end
we could close that weld it shut
that should hold em for a while
but we gotta figure on them
getting into the complex
that right so we repair the
barricades at these two intersections
right
and weld plate steel over these ducts
here and here and here
that should seal off
medlab and operations
outstanding now all we need
is a deck of cards
all right people
let move like we got a purpose
affirmative
affirmative
were sealing the tunnel
baby hurry up come on
for what it worth
here i want you to put this on
what it for
it a locator
then i can find you anywhere
in the complex on this
it just a precaution
thanks
doesnt mean were
engaged or anything
all right what next
last stop
get in
scoot down that good
now you lie here and have a nap
youre very tired
i dont want to
i have scary dreams
well i bet casey doesnt
have scary dreams
let take a look
nope nothing bad in there
see maybe you could
just try to be like her
ripley she doesnt
have bad dreams
because she just
a piece of plastic
right im sorry newt
there
my mommy always said
there were no monsters-
no real onesbut there are
yes there are arent there
why do they tell
little kids that
most of the time it true
here
take this
for luck
there that
dont go please
newt im gonna be
right in the next room
and you see that camera
right up there
i can see you
right through that camera
all the time
to see if youre safe
im not gonna leave you newt
i mean that that a promise
you promise
i cross my heart
and hope to die
and hope to die
now go to sleep
and dont dream
sneak
the molecular acid oxidizes after the
creature death completely neutralizing it
bishop you know that very interesting
but it doesnt really get us anywhere does it
im trying to figure out
what were dealing with here
let go through it again
they grab the colonists
they move them over there
and they immobilize them
to be hosts for more of these
which would mean that there would have
to be a lot of these parasites right
one for each colonist
that over 00 at least
yes that follows
but each one of these things
comes from an egg right
so who laying these eggs
im not sure
it must be something
we havent seen yet
bishop i want these specimens destroyed
as soon as youre finished with them
is that clear
mr burke gave instructions
that they were to be kept alive in
stasis for return to the company labs
he was very specific about it
look those two specimens are worth
millions to the bio-weapons division right
now if youre smart
we can both come out of this heroes
and we will be set up for life
youre crazy burke
do you know that
do you really think you can get a dangerous
organism like that past icc quarantine
how can they impound it if
they dont know about it
but they will know about it
burke from me
just like theyll know that you were
responsible for the deaths of 57 colonists
wait a second
you sent them to that ship
youre wrong
i just checked the colony log
directive dated 6-2-79
signed burke carter j
you sent them out there
and you didnt even warn them
why didnt you warn them burke
okay look
what if that ship didnt even exist
do you ever think about that
i didnt know so now if i went and made
a major security situation out of it
everybody steps in administration steps in
and there no exclusive rights for anybody
nobody wins so i made a
decision and it was wrong
it was a bad call ripley
it was a bad call
bad call
right
these people are dead burke
dont you have any idea
what youve done here
im gonna make sure that they nail
you right to the wall for this
youre not gonna sleaze
your way out of this one
right to the wall
ripley i-
you know i expected
more from you
i thought youd be
smarter than this
well im happy
to disappoint you
it very pretty bishop
but what are we looking for
that it emergency venting
that beautiful man
man thatthat just beats it all
how long till it blows
four hours
with a blast radius
of 30 kilometers
equal to about 40 megatons
we got problems
i dont believe this
i dont fucking believe this
vasquez close the shutters
why cant we shut it
down from here
im sorry
the crash caused too much damage
an overload is inevitable
at this point
man and i was getting short
four more weeks and out
now im gonna buy it on this rock
it aint half fair man
hudson give us a break
four more weeks man
weve got to get the other
drop ship from the sulaco
i mean there must be some way
of bringing it down on remote
how the transmitter was on the apc
it wasted
i dont care how but wed better think
of something wed better think of a way
think of what were fucked were doomed
shut up
shut up what about
the colony transmitters
the uplink tower down at the other end
why cant we use that
no i checked the hardware in
between here and there was damaged
we cant align the dish
well somebody gonna
have to go out there
take a portable terminal
go out there and patch in manually
yeah sure with those things running around
you can count me out
guess we can just count you out of everything
ill go
that right man
why dont you go man
ill go
what
ill go i mean im the only one
qualified to remote pilot the ship anyway
yeah right man
bishop should go good idea
believe me id prefer not to
i may be synthetic
but im not stupid
how long
this conduit runs almost to the
uplink assembly80 meters
say 40 minutes to crawl down there-
right
an hour to patch in
and align the antenna
thirty minutes to prep the ship
and about 50 minutes flight time
it gonna be close
good luck
see you soon
watch your fingers
vaya con dios man
i want you two
walking perimeter

embryos we were carrying-
me and newt
