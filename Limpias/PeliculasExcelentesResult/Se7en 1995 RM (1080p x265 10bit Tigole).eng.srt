detective somerset
im detective mills
lieutenant i apologize for interrupting like this
just get in town 20 minutes ago
they dump me here
look
mills
i thought we might find a bar someplace
you know sit talk
id like to get to the precinct
you know not much time
for this transition thing
i meant to ask you something
when we spoke on the phone before
yeah
why here
i dont follow
well all this effort to get transferred
it the first question
that popped into my head
i guess for the same reasons as you
or the same reasons you had
before you decided to quit yeah
you just met me
maybe im not understanding
the question
it very simple
you actually fought to get reassigned here
ive just never seen it
done that way before
i thought i could do some good look
it would be great for me if we didnt start
out kicking each other in the balls
if youre calling the shots lieutenant
yes
i want you to look
and i want you to listen ok
now i wasnt standing around
guarding the taco bell
ive worked homicide five years
not here
i understand that
well over the next seven days detective
youll do me the favor of remembering that
hello yeah
ok
say it again
i thought we moved here
to get away from tractor pulls
serpico gotta go
yeah well you might wanna get rid
of this little crusty
this eye serpico
did you get it
got it
good
coffee
no
nothing been touched
everything like i found it
what time was death established
like i said
i didnt touch anything
but he had his face in a plate of
spaghetti for about 45 minutes now
wait a minute
no one bothers with vital signs
did i stutter
this guy aint breathing unless he
started breathing spaghetti sauce
so that how it done around here
i beg your pardon detective
but this guy been sitting
in a pile of his own piss and shit
if he wasnt dead
he wouldve stood up by now
all right thank you officer
ok
thank you
i wonder
what exactly was the point of the
conversation you were about to get into
dont know
how many times has barney fife
found dead bodies that werent dead
drop it
somebody phone guinness
i think weve got a record here
better homes and gardens
who said this was murder
no one
guy heart gotta be the size
of a canned ham
if this isnt a coronary
well i dont know
how about that
we had this case once
guy dead on the ground
knife in his back
gotta be murder right
fuck
anyway big insurance policy involved yeah
so the guy took the tip of the blade
stuck it in his own shoulder blades
and he mustve screwed up a few times
because there was multiples back there
could you please be quiet
wait a minute
what
got a bucket here
what in it
oh god
fucking vomit
any blood in it
i didnt see any
help yourself
are you thinking it poison
oh wonderful very moody
thinking it poison somerset
you girls have got forensics
waiting outside
dont know if well all fit though
there room light the problem
hi how are you
hey
detective mills would you go help
the officers question the neighbors
what
send in forensics on your way out please
he dead
thank you doctor
youve seen my files right
you seen the things ive done
nope
i did my time on door-to-doors
and walking the beat
i did that shit for a long time
and
badge on my belt says detective
that the same as yours
look i made a decision
i had to consider the integrity of the scene
couldnt worry whether you thought you
were getting enough on the playing field
hey man
just dont be jerking me off
that all i ask dont jerk me off
he been dead a long time
and i can tell you it was not from poison
oh man
how does someone
let themselves go like that
it took four orderlies
just to get him on the table
howd the fat fuck
ever fit out his front door
please
it obvious he was a shut-in
now look at this
see how big this stomach is
and the strange thing is it stretches
here look at the size of
the cardiac orifice where the food
wait i see what youre pointing out
but that means nothing to me
ok he got lines of distention
across the duodenum
and the interior wall is ripped open
this man ate till he burst
he didnt really burst
not all the way
he was hemorrhaging internally
and there was a hematoma in the rectus
and transverse abdominis muscles
so he did die by eating
yes and no
what about these bruises up here
well i havent figured that out yet
gun pressed against his head
pressed hard enough sure
fuck yeah
marks from the front side
flush with the muzzle
ladies and gentlemen
we have ourselves a homicide
killer put a bucket beneath him
kept on serving
took his time too
coroner said this couldve gone on
more than 2 hours
victim throat was swollen
probably from the effort
and there was definitely a point
when he passed out
that when the killer kicked him
and he burst
sadistic fucker
when you want somebody dead
you drive by and shoot him
you dont risk the time it takes to do this
unless the act itself has meaning
come on
somebody had a problem with the fat
boy and decided to torture him
simple as that
in the grocery bags we found two receipts
that means the killer stopped
in the middle of everything
and made a second trip
to the supermarket
so
hey man it his thing
ive been out in the rain all day
this is beginning
weve got one dead guy not three
no motive
dont even start that big brain of
yours cooking on this all right
please id like to be reassigned
what
what
what
what in the hell are you talking about
this cant be my last duty
it just gonna go on and on and on
youre retiring
six more days and youre all the way gone
wont be the first time
youve left unfinished
those other oases were taken as close
to conclusion as humanly possible
and if i may speak freely
were all friends here
this should not be his first assignment
oh come on i knew it
this is not my first assignment
you dick
it too soon for him
hey man you know im right here
you can say that shit to my face
captain
it too soon for you
captain if we can just talk in private
this isnt working
it a personal thing
maybe
just shut up mills
look i dont have anyone else
to put on this and you know it
this is metro
you dont just get to swap
give it to me
say what
yeah he doesnt want it fuck him
sorry but see you later
have a nice time
give it to me
no im putting you on something else

no
i will not discuss the details
of this ongoing investigation
so dont even bother asking
what you guys got for me
nothing yet boss
why dont you guys go get a coffee
we have this breaking story for you
were going to go live downtown
where defense attorney eli gould
was found murdered this morning
district attorney martin talbot
is taking questions from reporters
there could be a conflict of interest
that is ridiculous to the point
of being offensive
there is no conflict whatsoever
and any claim that there
could be is irresponsible
mr talbot mr talbot
now hold on
it rumored youre far
from apprehending a suspect
let me address that
ive just come from a meeting of law
enforcement officials and theyve assured me
they have their very best men on this
this will be the very definition
of swift justice
pardon me george
somerset
come in
have you heard the news
nope havent heard
eli gould was found murdered
this morning
someone broke into his law firm
and bled him to death

on the sidewalk helpless
his attacker stabs him in both eyes
this happened just last night
about four blocks from here

i dont understand this place any longer
it the way it always been
maybe youre right
you do this work
you were made for it and i
dont think you can deny that
maybe im wrong
the coroner sent this down for you
found them in fat boy stomach
mixed in with food
looks like plastic little pieces of plastic
set them on the desk please
they were
they were fed to him
oh lord

behind the refrigerator
in the obesity murder scene
long is the way and hard
that out of hell leads up to light
it from milton
paradise lost
all right im confused
it means that this is beginning

written in grease
there are seven deadly sins captain
gluttony
greed
sloth wrath pride lust
and envy
seven
hold on

how often i see guns i just
i cant get used to them
same here
why arent you married william
oh trace what the hell
i was close once
it just didnt happen
it surprises me
it really does
well
anyone who spends a significant amount
of time with me finds me disagreeable
just ask your husband
very true
very very true
so how long have you lived here
too long
how are you liking it
you know takes time settle in
itll be good
well you get numb after awhile
there are things to any city
subway
it will go away in a minute
it nothing
real estate guy
fucking piece of
sorry honey
he
he shows us the place
a few times
i think he good
he efficient
tracy really likes him
then i start wondering why will he only
bring us here five minutes at a time yeah
we found out the first night
the soothing relaxing vibrating home
im sorry
yeah all right laugh it up
i dont know why youre laughing
all right already
the guy wouldve had to get
into the building
before the office was closed
and security tightened
now gould wouldve been working late
im certain he was the biggest
defense lawyer in town
infamous really
now listen body was found
on tuesday morning
the office was closed on monday which
means the guy couldve gotten in friday
laid low till the cleaning crew left then
had his way with gould all day saturday
sunday maybe even monday
hey look at this
gould was bound right arm almost free
he was handed a butcher knife
check out the scale
a pound of flesh
yeah
one pound of flesh
no more no less
no cartilage no bone
but only flesh
merchant of venice
didnt see it
this task done and
he would go free
im telling you that chair
was soaked through with sweat
of course
the killer wouldve wanted gould
to take his time
to sit and decide which out to make first
imagine it
there a gun in your face
which part of your body is expendable
what about the love handle
cut along the side of his own stomach
all right let take a fresh look at these
even though the corpse is there
look through it
edit out the initial shock
trick is to find one item
one detail and focus on it
until it an exhausted possibility
just gonna get another beer
beer
wine please
he preaching
he punishing
the sins were used in medieval sermons
there were seven cardinal virtues
and seven deadly sins
used as teaching tools
yeah yeah yeah like in
the parson tale and
what this
dante
you read them
yeah
well parts
hey remember in purgatory
dante and his buddy
theyre climbing up the hill
theyre checking out all the sinners yeah
yeah the seven terraces of purgation
yeah yeah right
but there pride comes first not gluttony
yeah well for now let just consider that
the books were the killer inspiration
the sermons were about atonement for sin
these murders are like forced attrition
forced what
attrition
it when you regret your sins
but not because you love god
oh like because someone sticking
a fucking gun in your face
no fingerprints
nope
totally unrelated victims
yeah
and no witnesses of any kind
which i dont get
because the fucker had to get back out
well in any major city minding
your own business is a science
the first thing they teach women in
rape prevention is never cry for help
always yell fire
nobody answers to help
you holler fire they come running
that fucked up
he mustve left another puzzle piece
you know what
thank you for talking this out
but i gotta sleep
walk the dogs
this is just strictly to satisfy my curiosity
im still leaving at the end of the week
oh shit
no wait wait
gould wife
she was out of town at the time
so this means she saw something
what if it a threat
well i put her in a safe house
she wasnt too happy about it
what if it isnt something she has seen
but something she supposed to see
but hasnt been given a chance
yeah ok what
i dont know
but that the one thing
sign us in
gotta see mrs gould
treat me like a prisoner
why do you have a phone if i cant
make long distance phone calls
mrs gould
dont treat people like this
mrs gould i am sorry
i truly am
i dont understand
ok i need you to look at
each photo very carefully
look and see if there anything
strange or out of place
anything at all
i dont see anything
youre sure
please i just
i cant do this right now
ok
it got to be now
there may be something we havent seen
wait
what
here
this painting it upside down
you sure your men didnt move this
no no
those shots were taken before forensics
nothing
there gotta be something
moved the screws to rehang it
yep
what the fuck is that
switchblade
goddamn it
there must be something
he didnt paint the fucking thing
no he fucking with us
that what he doing
see this this is us
yeah
just wait a minute
now somerset climbing on the furniture
just wait a minute
youre kidding me
call the print lab
oh man
honestly have you ever
seen anything like this
no
i can tell you guys just by
looking at the swirl pattern
theyre not the victim fingerprints
i dont know man
i say he whacked enough
it doesnt fit
he doesnt wants us to help him stop
who knows
so many freaks out there doing their
little evil deeds they dont wanna do
the voices made me do it
my dog made me do it
jodie foster told me to do it
you know um ive seen this baby take as
long as three days to make a match
so maybe you guys wanna cross
your fingers somewhere else
you meant what you said to
mrs gould didnt you
about catching this guy
yeah
wish i still thought the way you do
why dont you tell me what the hell
it is you think were doing then
picking up the pieces
were collecting all the evidence
taking all the pictures and samples
writing everything down
noting the time things happened
that all
that all
putting everything into neat
little piles and filing it away
on the off chance it will ever
be needed in the courtroom
picking up diamonds
on a deserted island
saving them in case we get rescued
bullshit
even the most promising clues
usually only lead to others
so many corpses roll away unrevenged
dont try to tell me
you didnt get that rush tonight
i saw you
were getting somewhere
wake up glimmer twins
youve got a winner
this guy goes by the name of victor
his real name is theodore allen
his prints were found
at the scene by homicide
he got a long history
of serious mental illness
his parents gave him a very strict
southern baptist upbringing
but somewhere along the line
they fell short
now victor dabbled in drugs
armed robbery and assault
spent time in prison here a while back
for the attempted rape of a minor
but his lawyer saw to it that didnt last long
his lawyer by the way
is the recently deceased eli gould
greed murder victim
yes sir
were gonna finish this thing
up today ladies and germs
victor been out of circulation a while
but there still a residence in his name
youre not buying all this are you
doesnt seem like our guy does it
you tell me
our killer seems to have more purpose
you ever take a bullet
never in my 34 years knock wood
ive only taken my gun out three times
with the intention of using it
never pulled the trigger
not once
you
yeah but no i never took a
i never took a bullet
but i pulled my gun once shot it once

it was my first one of these
we were a secondary unit
i was pretty shaky going in
i was a rookie then
anyway we bust open the door
looking for this junkie and
the fucker just opened fire on us
one cop got hit in the arm

how do they get here so fucking quick
they pay police for the information
and they pay well
hey man im sorry i
those
you know they piss me off
it ok
it impressive to see a man
feeding off his emotions
a year of immobility seems about right
judging by the deterioration
of the muscles and the spine
blood tests show a whole smorgasbord
of drugs in his system
even an antibiotic
which mustve been administered
to keep the bed sores from infecting
now has he tried to speak
or communicate in any way
even if his brain were not mush
which it is
he chewed off his own tongue long ago
doc
is there absolutely no chance
that he might survive
detective hed die of shock right now if
you were to shine a flashlight in his eyes
he experienced about as much pain and
suffering as anyone ive encountered
give or take
and he still has hell to look forward to
good night
yeah
hello william
it tracy
tracy
is everything all right
yeah yes everything fine

if you can just give me a call ok
i have to go now
well good night
good night
i mean you know this city so well
youve been here so long
it can be a hard place
i dont know why i asked you to come
why dont you talk to him about it
tell him how you feel
i cant you know i cant be a burden
especially now
ill get used to things
you know i think i just
i wanted to talk to someone who
lived here for a long time and
i mean upstate you know it a
completely different environment
did david tell you that i teach fifth grade
well i did
he mentioned it
ive been going around
you know looking at schools
but the conditions here are horrible
what about private schools
i dont know
why dont you tell me
what really bothering you tracy
david and i are gonna have a baby
oh tracy i
i dont think im the
im the one to talk to about this
i hate this city
i had a relationship once
it was very much like a marriage
we got pregnant
this was a long time ago
i remember getting up one morning
and going to work
just another day like any other except it
was the first day after i knew about
the pregnancy
and i felt this fear for the first time ever
i remember thinking how can i bring
a child into a world like this
how can how can a person grow up
with all this around them
i told her i didnt want to have it
and over the next few weeks
i wore her down
i wanna have children
i can tell you now
im i know i mean
im positive that i made the right decision
but there not a day that passes
that i dont wish that i had made
a different choice
if you dont keep
the baby i mean if that your decision
dont ever tell him
that you were pregnant
but if you choose to have this baby
you spoil that kid every chance you get
that about all the advice
i can give you tracy
i got to go
william
thank you
victor landlord said there was an
envelope of cash in the office mailbox

a paralyzed tenant with no tongue
who pays the rent on time

i dont think so
his luck will run out
not depending on luck
we walked into that apartment exactly one
year after he tied victor to the bed
one year to the day
he wanted us to
dont know that for sure
oh yes we do
this note he left
his first words to us
long is the way and hard
that out of hell leads up to light
fuck him so what
he right so far
imagine the will it takes
to keep a man bound for a full year
to sever his hand
and use it to plant fingerprints
to insert tubes into his genitals
this guy is methodical exacting
and worst of all patient
he a nut bag
and just because the fucker got
a library card doesnt make him yoda

anyone who checks out a flagged book
has his library records fed
into the fbi computers then on

oh legal illegal
these terms dont apply
you cant use the information directly
it just a useful guide
it might sound silly but you cant get
a library card without an
id and a current phone bill see
so they run a list
precisely
if you wanna know who reading
purgatory and paradise lost
and helter skelter

he was not pleased
and i couldnt stop laughing

if we catch john doe
and he turns out to be the devil
i mean if he satan himself
that might live up to our expectations
but he not the devil
he just a man
you know
see you bitch and you complain
and you tell me these things these
if you think youre preparing
me for hard times
thank you but
but you gotta be a hero
you wanna be a champion
well let me tell you
people dont want a champion
they wanna eat cheeseburgers
play lotto and watch tv
how did you get like this
i wanna know
it wasnt one thing i can tell you that
go on
i just dont think i can continue
to live in a place that embraces
and nurtures apathy as if it was a virtue
youre no different no better
i didnt say i was different or better
im not
hell i sympathize
i sympathize completely
apathy is a solution
i mean it easier to lose yourself
in drugs than it is to cope with life
yeah
it easier to steal what you
want than it is to earn it
it easier to beat a child
than it is to raise it
hell love costs
it takes effort and work
we are talking about people
who are mentally ill
we are talking about people
fucking crazies
no no were not
yes today
were talking about everyday life here
you cant afford to be this naive
fuck off
see you should listen to yourself
yeah
you say that the problem
with people is that they dont care
so i dont care about people
it makes no sense
you know why
you care
you wanna know
damn right
and youre gonna make a difference
whatever the point is
is that i dont think youre quitting
because you believe these things
you say i dont
i think you wanna believe them
because youre quitting
you want me to agree with you and say
yeah yeah yeah youre right
it all fucked up
it a fucking mess
we should all go live in
a fucking log cabin
but i wont
i wont say that
i dont agree with you
i do not
i cant
im gonna go home
thank you though
i love you honey

no credit history
no employment records
his bank account only 5 years old
and it was started with cash

for the first time ever
you and i are in total agreement
he wouldnt just stop
so what the fuck man

from completing his masterpiece
well wait for his plea
my client says there are two more bodies
two more victims hidden away
he will take detectives mills
and somerset to these bodies
but only detective mills and
somerset only at 600 today
why us
he says he admires you
it part of the game
the client claims if the detectives do not
accept this these bodies will never be found
frankly im inclined to let them rot
weve got him
downstairs locked up
done deal
he gonna get his free room and board
get his free cable tv
hell my wife doesnt even have cable
why are we having this conversation
mills
hey something stinks
and this one here in the street
yeah you in your $3000 suit
and that smug smile on your face
dealing for that shit i dont like it
mills
i am required by law to serve my clients
oh jesus
to the best of my ability
to serve their best interest
we dont make deals here mr swarr
my client also wishes inform you
that if you do not accept
he will plead insanity across the board
let him try it
id like to see him try
come on now we all know
the extreme nature of these crimes
i could get him off with such a plea
im not letting this conviction slide
i can tell you that
he says that if you do accept
under his specific conditions
hell sign a full confession
plead guilty right now
it your case
make a decision
full confession
im in
it has to be the both of you
if he were to claim insanity
this conversation is admissible
the fact that he blackmailing us
with his plea
and my client would like
to remind you two more are dead
press would have a field day
if they find out the police didnt
seem concerned about finding them
giving them a proper burial
yeah if in fact there are two more dead
lab report came up from downtown they
did a quickie on doe clothing and nails
they found blood from doe
from him slicing his fingers
blood from the woman
who face he cut off
and blood from a third party
as yet unidentified
youd be escorting an unarmed man
let finish it
if john doe head splits
open and a ufo should fly out
i want you to have expected it
i will
hey man if i was to accidentally
shave off a nipple would it be covered
by workman comp
i suppose so
if you were man enough
to actually file a claim
id buy you one out of my own pocket
if i keep coming home late
my wife gonna think something up
you know
yeah
what
let go
c-victor -5-5 take clear the tc
pull around
there it is late-model black
sedan at your 0 oclock
who are you john
who are you really
what do you mean
all i mean at this stage
what harm can it do to tell
us a bit about yourself
it doesnt matter who i am
who i am means absolutely nothing
you need to stay on your left up here
so where are we heading
youll see
were not just going to pick up
two more dead bodies are we john
that wouldnt be shocking enough
weve got newspapers
to think about yeah
wanting people to listen
you cant just tap them
on the shoulder anymore
you have to hit them
with a sledgehammer
and then youll notice
youve got their strict attention
but the question is
what makes you so special
that people should listen
im not special
ive never been exceptional
this is though what im doing
my work
your work john
yes
see i dont i dont see
anything special about it john
that not true
no it is true
and the funny thing is all this work
two months from now
no one gonna care
no one gonna give a shit
no one gonna remember
you cant see the whole complete act yet
but when this is done
when it finished
it going to be
people will barely be able
to comprehend
but they wont be able to deny
could the freak be any more vague
i mean as far as master plans go john
i cant wait for you to see
i really cant
it really going to be something
well you know what
im gonna be standing right next to you
so when this big thing happens
you be sure and let me know
because i wouldnt wanna miss it
oh dont worry
you wont
you wont miss a thing
with the tour bus itself
give two miles separation
what so exciting
it not too far now
high-tension lines ahead
prepare for frequency change
ive been trying to figure something
in my head and maybe
you can help me out yeah
when a person is insane
as you clearly are
do you know that youre insane
maybe youre sitting around
reading guns and ammo
masturbating in your own feces
do you just stop and go
wow it is amazing how
fucking crazy i really am
yeah do you guys do that
it more comfortable
for you to label me insane
it very comfortable
it not something i would
expect you to accept
but i did not choose
i was chosen
well whatever
i dont doubt that you believe that john
but seems to me that youre
overlooking a glaring contradiction
meaning what
glad you asked
if you were chosen
that is by a higher power
and if your hand was forced
it seems strange to me that youd
get such enjoyment out of it
you enjoyed torturing those people
this doesnt seem in keeping
with martyrdom does it
john
i doubt i enjoyed it any more
than detective mills would enjoy time
alone with me in a room without windows
isnt that true
how happy would it make you
to hurt me with impunity
that hurts my feelings
i would never
you wouldnt because there consequences
it in those eyes of yours though
nothing wrong with a man
taking pleasure in his work
i wont deny my own personal desire
to turn each sin against the sinner
wait a minute i thought all you
did was kill innocent people
innocent
is that supposed to be funny
an obese man
a disgusting man who
could barely stand up
a man if you saw him in the street
youd point him out to your friends
so theyd join you in mocking him
a man who if you saw him
while you were eating
you wouldnt be able to finish your meal
and after him i picked the lawyer
you both must have to secretly
thank me for that one
this is a man who dedicated his life
to making money by lying with
every breath that he could muster
to keeping murderers and
rapists on the streets
murderers
a woman
murderers john like yourself
a woman
so ugly on the inside that she
couldnt bear to go on living
if she couldnt be beautiful on the outside
a drug dealer
a drug dealing pederast actually
and let not forget
the disease-spreading whore
only in a world this shitty
could you even try to say these
innocent people and keep a straight face
but that the point
we see a deadly sin
on every street corner
in every home
and we tolerate it
we tolerate it because it common it
it trivial
we tolerate it morning noon and night
well not anymore
im setting the example
and what ive done is gonna be
puzzled over
and studied
and followed
forever
yeah
delusions of grandeur
you should be thanking me
why that john
because youre going
to be remembered after this
realize detective the only reason
that im here right now
is that i wanted to be
no no we wouldve got you eventually
oh really
so what were you doing
biding your time toying with me
allowing five innocent people to die
until you felt like springing your trap
tell me what was the indisputable
evidence you were going to use on me
right before i walked up to you
and put my hands in the air
john calm down
i seem to remember us
knocking on your door
oh that right
and i seem to remember
breaking your face
youre only alive because i didnt kill you
ok sit back
i spared you
sit back
remember that detective
every time you look in the mirror
at that face of yours
for the rest of your life
or should i say
for the rest of what life
i allow you to have
sit back
sit back you fucking freak
shut your fucking mouth
youre no messiah
youre a movie of the week
youre a fucking t-shirt at best
dont ask me to pity those people
i dont mourn them any more than the
thousands that died at sodom and gomorrah
is that to say john that what you
were doing was god good work
the lord works in mysterious ways
do you see those high-tension towers
that where were headed
