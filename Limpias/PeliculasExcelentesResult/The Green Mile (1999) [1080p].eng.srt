you know what he did
i read the court transcript
-thank you missus
-my pleasure
kids lunch is about ready
yall come on up
together
coming mama
what exactly are you
trying to find out
ive wondered if he did anything
like that before
why has he said anything
no but a man who does
a thing like that
has often developed a taste for it
over time it occurred to me
that it might be easy enough
to follow his back trail find out
a man his size and colored to boot
cant be that hard to trace
youd think so but youd be wrong
believe me we tried
like hed dropped out of the sky
how can that be
were in a depression
a third of the country out of work
people are drifting by the thousands
looking for jobs for greener grass
even a giant like coffey
wouldnt get noticed everywhere
not until he kills
a couple of little girls
he is
strange l admit
but there doesnt seem to be
any real violence in him
i know violent men mr hammersmith
i deal with them day in and day out
you didnt come to ask me
whether he killed before
you came to see if l think
he did it at all
do you
one seldom sees
a less ambiguous case
he was found with the victims
in his arms
and yet you defended him
everyone is entitled to a defense
mrs hammersmith
kids lunch
yall listen to your mama
ill tell you something
and you listen close too because it
might be something you need to know
im listening
we had us a dog
just a sweet mongrel
you know the kind
well in many ways
a good mongrel dog is like a negro
you get to know it
often you get to love it
it is of no particular use
but you keep it around
because you think it loves you
if youre lucky mr edgecomb you
never have to find out any different
my wife and l were not so lucky
caleb come here for a second
come here
please son
he still has the one good eye
i suppose he lucky
not to be completely blind
we get down on our knees
and thank god for that much at least
right caleb
okay go on in now
that dog attacked my boy
for no reason
just got it in his mind one day
the same with john coffey
he was sorry afterwards
of that l have no doubt
but those little girls
stayed raped and murdered
maybe hed never done it before
my dog never bit before
but l didnt concern myself with that
i went out with my rifle grabbed
his collar and blew his brains out
is coffey guilty
yes he is
dont you doubt it
and dont you turn your back on him
you may get away with it once
or even a hundred times
but in the end
youll get bit
footsteps approach

the man is on death row for the crime
and plus
he huge
if he tried to get away itd take
a lot of bullets to stop him

in accordance with state law
may god have mercy on your soul
paul
you have to say it
you have to give the order
coffey voice
he killed them with they love
that how it is every day
all over the world
roll on two
electrlclty humming
paul it was the last execution
i ever took part in
i just couldnt do it anymore
after that brutal either
we both transferred out
took jobs with boys correctional
it was all right
catch them young
became my motto
you dont believe me
i dont imagine youd lie to me paul
-lt just that--
-lt quite a story
it quite a story
one thing i dont understand
you said you and jan
had a grown son in  935
is that right
the math doesnt work does it
do you feel up to taking a walk
paul
watch your step
now let your eyes adjust
there
hey wake up old fella
wake up
paul it isnt lt cant be
come over here boy

that cant be mr jingles
speaks french
go on you can do it
this isnt exactly the mouseville
we had in mind is it
but we make do dont we old fella
i think mr jingles
happened by accident
i think when we electrocuted del
and it all went so badly
well john could feel that
you know
and l think a part of
whatever magic was inside of him
just leapt into my tiny friend here
as for me
john had to give me
a part of himself
a gift the way he saw it
so that l could see for myself
what wild bill had done
when john did that
when he took my hand
a part of the power
that worked through him
spilled into me
he what
he infected you with life
it as good a word as any
he infected us both
didnt he mr jingles
with life
im  08 years old elaine
i was 44 the year that john coffey
walked the green mile
you mustnt blame john
he couldnt help what happened
he was just a force of nature
oh lve lived to see
some amazing things ellie
another century come to pass
but lve
ive had to see my friends and
loved ones die off through the years
hal and melinda
brutus howell
my wife my boy
and you elaine
youll die too
and my curse is knowing
that ill be there to see it
it my atonement you see
it my punishment
for letting john coffey
ride the lightning
for killing a miracle of god
prlest
almighty everlasting god
the source of all being and life
paul
youll be gone like all the others
ill have to stay
oh lll die eventually
of that im sure
i have no illusions of immortality
but i will have wished for death
long before death finds me
in truth l wish for it already
woman slnging on radlo
mr jingles
where you been
been worried about you boy
you hungry
let go see if we cant find you
something to eat
a few crumbs anyway
i know youd like that
look at you
i lie in bed most nights
thinking about it
and l wait
i think about all the people
ive loved
now long gone
i think about my beautiful jan
how l lost her so many years ago
and l think about all of us walking
our own green mile
each in our own time
but one thought
more than any other
keeps me awake most nights
lf he could make a mouse
live so long
how much longer do i have
we each owe a death
there are no exceptions
but oh god
sometimes
the green mile seems so long
