of the almighty
the hold-up at the motel went down

the destinies of the outlaws
then took different paths
i dont think this guy
was involved in the heist

talking about love with you

after the hold-up
there were constant police raids
in the slum
every day someone got beaten up
someone was nailed
but no-one had seen anything
no-one knew anything
no-one blabbed to the cops
about where the thieves
were hiding out

dona zelia began selling drugs here
in order to raise her daughters
she also gave away drugs
to boys at times
in return for special favours
her favourite was big boy
one day he grew very big
zelia operation was so amateur
that he had no trouble
seizing it from her
big boy used
the neighbourhood kids as dealers
what about my pot
stick it up your ass
the best dealer
i sold everything
was a guy called carrot
can i have a sip
he earned big boy trust
and moved up to become a manager
blacky 20 for us and 5 for you ok
one day
a buddy of carrot showed up
his name was aristotle

carrot wanted to kill big boy
but it wasnt necessary
big boy hadnt paid off the cops
he died in jail
we got them
carrot took everything
that belonged to big boy
but didnt want the apartment
the place was ill-fated
carrot gave it
to his most trusted dealer
50 bags
blacky
we can sell loads
that how he took over
the local trade
but not for long
who is it
go see
hey blacky
fuck lil dice
you show up like this at my place
who said it was your place
yeah who
lil dice
lil dice my ass
my name is lil z√© now
lil z√© had always wanted
to be boss of the city of god
ever since he was called lil dice
theyre having fun and not me
i want to get out of here
what kid your friend took everything
what do you want
that night lil dice
satisfied his thirst to kill
though he knew
shaggy would never forgive him
to avoid being punished
he left the city of god
he had to work hard for peanuts
what with you kid
youre an idiot
yeah benny
lil dice and benny managed well
they had the gift of crime
you have more than me
it was my idea
the only problem
was running into an older hoodlum
like my brother goose
lil dice
shit man i thought
you were a goner at the motel
youre fucking loaded
dont benny
that our money
fuck you pass me the money
benny tell your brother shaggy
that shorty is squealing
im leaving the slum
goose
take it from shaggy
youll need it
from one hit to the next
lil dice grew up
at 8 he was the most respected hood
in the city of god
youre of age now watch out
he was one of
the most wanted robbers in rio
lil dice how it going
happy birthday

get lost tuba
excuse me amigo
give me a beer
didnt you see me prick
you didnt see me
what up man
up yours the next time
ill waste you asshole
lil dice was ready for anything
i wanna talk
and he was itching to start
who are the fattest cats here
there are tons of them
look at jerry adriani
gold chain snazzy clothes
look at pereira
and the chick he with
bernice she was my brother girl
check out his car
then there blacky
covered in gold
gold chain gold watch
look at carrot and his car
theyre all dealers
theyre all fucking loaded
hold-ups bring in chicken shit
the big bucks are in drugs
i see
especially in selling coke
but you need money
not really
well kill these clowns
and take over their business
when do we start
now
exu-the-devil
is the light that shines forth
he brought you here
why remain in the city of god
where god has forgotten you
i know what you want
you want power
i have something
which will give it to you
to change your fate
i give you my protector boy
but you mustnt fornicate
with the amulet
otherwise
youll die
the boy is no longer called lil dice
but lil z√©
lil z√© will grow up
youll stick with me
ill stick with you
lil dice became lil z√©
and he began to kill
he started one morning
taking over jerry adriani racket
he spent all day on the job
by night almost all of the rackets
in the slum were his
the only business
he didnt touch was carrot
since he was a friend of benny
all that was left was the apartment
but that would be easy
who is it
go see
hey blacky
fuck lil dice
you show up like this at my place
who said it was your place
yeah who
something wrong lil dice
lil dice my ass
my name is lil z√© now
lil z√© see
youre a goner bastard
dont kill him he understands
right blacky
it all yours
i dont want no trouble ok
i should have taken this chance
to avenge my brother death
youll live but youll work for us
understand
that easy to say
where are you going
he clean lil z√©
what your name kid
rocket
he goose brother
goose
the late goose
quick kid run along
tell everyone that this business
now belongs to lil z√©
and that well be selling coke
got that
cocaine
where the turf
over there on the left
selling drugs
is like any other business
the supplier
delivers the merchandise
which is then packaged
on the premises
it done in an assembly line
boring as hell
pot is wrapped up in lids
cocaine is put into packets
and then into bundles of 0 or 00
you can even make a career
in dealing drugs
the kids start out as delivery boys
theyre paid to run errands
and take messages
then they become lookouts
if the police arrive
the kites disappear
and everyone scrams
later you become
a dealer or a vapour
when the heat on
the vapour quickly evaporates
moving up the ladder
you have the soldier
and if the guy is good at maths
he can become a manager
the boss right-hand man
the police receive their part
and dont make trouble
since lil z√© killed off
all of his enemies
there were no shoot-outs
in the city of god
you could drive there
the playboys felt safe
buying their drugs there
the city teemed with addicts
and lil z√© grew rich
do you want to try some
cheers mate
cant decide which to wear
this one cool
if dealing were legal
lil z√© would have been
man of the year
but things were risky for me
i was afraid of him
and he was everywhere
what a drag this guy is
whenever i wanted to smoke a joint
i had to go see carrot
half a lid
thanks
but it was worth it
i only smoked with angelica
she and tiago had split up
so i made my move
i was about to win her over
these pictures are really great

but they didnt know
that the city had a boss now

and forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive those
who trespass against us
and lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil
amen
hoodlums have guns but cant shoot
one bullet from knockout ned
was worth ten from lil z√© gang
lil z√© couldnt take it

the cops considered anyone
living in the slum a hoodlum
people got used to living in vietnam
and more and more volunteers

because elsewhere
another more important sex scene
for the slum was taking place
carrot was helping knockout ned escape
without firing a shot
the policeman guarding him
was in the willing hands of the nurse
and in the meantime to eliminate carrot
lil z√© was investing in munitions
he invested heavily
even if he couldnt pay
remember the double-barrel
