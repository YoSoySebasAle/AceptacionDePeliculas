
are you here to kill me
i know what this is
ive seen one before
many many years ago
it belonged to a man i met
in a half-remembered dream
a man possessed of
some radical notions
what is the most
resilient parasite
a bacteria a virus
an intestinal worm
what mr cobb is trying to say
an idea
resilient highly contagious
once an idea has taken
hold of the brain
it almost impossible
to eradicate
an idea that is fully formed
fully understood that sticks
right in there somewhere
for someone like you to steal
yes in the dream state your
conscious defences are lowered
and that makes your thoughts
vulnerable to theft
it called extraction
mr saito we can train your
subconscious to defend itself
from even the most
skilled extractor
how can you do that
because i am the most
skilled extractor
i know how to search your mind and
find your secrets
i know the tricks
and i can teach them to you so
that even when youre asleep
your defence is never down
look if you want my
help youre gonna
have to be completely
open with me
i need to know my way around your
thoughts better than your wife
better than your therapist
better than anyone
if this is a dream and you
have a safe full of secrets
i need to know
what in that safe
in order for this all to work you
need to completely let me in
enjoy your evening gentlemen
as i consider your proposal
he knows
what going on up there
saito knows he playing with us
doesnt matter i can
get it here trust me
the information is in the safe
he looked right at it
when i mentioned secrets
what she doing here
just head back to the room all
right ill take care of this
okay make sure you do
were here to work
if i jumped would i survive
with a clean dive perhaps
mal what are you doing here
i thought you might be missing me
you know that i am
but i cant trust you any more
so what
looks like arthur taste
actually the subject is partial
to postwar british painters
please have a seat
tell me
do the children miss me
you cant imagine
what are you doing
just getting some fresh air
stay where you are mal
goddamn it
turn around
the gun dom
please
now the envelope mr cobb
did she tell you or have
you known all along
that youre here to steal from me
or that we are actually asleep
i want to know the
name of your employer
ah there no use threatening
him in a dream right mal
that depends on what
youre threatening
killing him would
just wake him up
but pain
pain is in the mind
and judging by the decor were
in your mind arent we arthur
what are you doing it too soon
but the dream collapsing
im gonna try to
keep saito under a
little bit longer
were almost there
he was close very close
stop him
this isnt gonna
work wake him up
he wont wake
give him the kick
what
dunk him
he out
you came prepared
not even my head of security knows
this apartment how
did you find it
it difficult for a
man of your position
to keep a love nest
like this secret
particularly where there
a married woman involved
she would never
yet here we are
with a dilemma
theyre getting closer
you got what you came for
well that not true
you left out a key piece of
information didnt you
you held something back because
you knew what we were up to
question is whyd you
let us in at all
an audition
an audition for what
doesnt matter you failed
we extracted every bit of
information you had in there
but your deception was obvious
so leave me and go
you dont seem to
understand mr saito
that corporation that hired us
they wont accept failure
we wont last two days
cobb
looks like im gonna have to
do this a little more simply
tell us what you know tell
us what you know now
ive always hated this carpet
it stained and frayed
in such distinctive ways
but very definitely made of wool
right now
im lying on polyester
which means im not lying on
my carpet in my apartment
you have lived up to your
reputation mr cobb
im still dreaming
howd it go
not good
dream within a dream
huh im impressed
but in my dream you
play by my rules
ah yes but you see mr saito
were not in your dream
were in mine
asshole how do you
mess up the carpet
it wasnt my fault
youre the architect
i didnt know he was gonna
rub his cheek on it
that enough
you what the hell was all that
i have it under control
id hate to see you
out of control
we dont have time for this
im getting off at kyoto
he not gonna check
every compartment
yeah well i dont like trains
listen every man for himself
yes hello
hi daddy
hi dad

daddy

that enough kids say bye-bye
listen im gonna send some
presents with grandpa all right
and you be good you be
our ride on the roof
right
hey are you okay
yeah yeah im fine why
well down in the
dream mal showing up
look im sorry about your
leg wont happen again
it getting worse isnt it
one apology all youre
getting all right
where nash
he hasnt shown you wanna wait
we were supposed to deliver
saito expansion plans
to cobol engineering
two hours ago
by now they know we failed
it time we disappear
where you gonna go
buenos aires
i can lie low there
maybe sniff out
a job when things quiet down you
stateside
send my regards
he sold you out thought to come
to me and bargain for his life
so i offer you the satisfaction
it not the way i
deal with things
what will you do with him
nothing
but i cant speak for
cobol engineering
what do you want from us
inception
is it possible
of course not
if you can steal an idea
from someone mind
why cant you plant
one there instead
okay here me planting
an idea in your head
i say dont think
about elephants
what are you thinking about
elephants
right but it not your idea
because you know i gave it to you
the subject mind can always
trace the genesis of the idea
true inspiration
impossible to fake
that not true
can you do it
are you offering me a choice
because i can find my own way
to square things with cobol
then you do have a choice
then i choose to leave sir
tell the crew where
you want to go
hey mr cobb
how would you like to go home
to america to your children
you cant fix that no one can
just like inception
cobb come on
how complex is the idea
simple enough
no idea is simple when you need to
plant it in somebody else mind
my main competitor is an
old man in poor health
his son will soon inherit
control of the corporation
i need him to decide to break
up his father empire
cobb we should walk
away from this
hold on
if i were to do this if
i even could do it
id need a guarantee
how do i know you can deliver
you dont
but i can
so do you want to take
a leap of faith
or become an old man
filled with regret
waiting to die alone
assemble your team mr cobb and
choose your people more wisely
look i know how much
you wanna go home
this cant be done
yes it can just have
to go deep enough
you dont know that
ive done it before
whod you do it to
why are we going to paris
were gonna need a new architect
you never did like
your office did you
no space to think in
that broom cupboard
is it safe for you to be here
extradition between france
and the united states
is a bureaucratic
nightmare you know that
i think they might find a way
to make it work in your case
look i brought these
for you to give
to the kids when
you have a chance
itll take more than the
occasional stuffed animal
to convince those children
they still have a father
im just doing what i know
im doing what you taught me
i never taught you to be a thief
no you taught me to
navigate people minds
but after what happened
there werent a whole
lot of legitimate
ways for me to use that skill
what are you doing here dom
i think i found a way home
it a job for some very
very powerful people
people who i believe can fix
my charges permanently
but i need your help
youre here to corrupt one
of my brightest and best
you know what im offering let
them decide for themselves
money
not just money
you remember
it the chance to build
cathedrals entire cities
things that never existed
things that couldnt
exist in the real world
so you want me to let someone else
follow you into your fantasy
they dont actually
come into the dream
they just design the
levels and teach
them to the dreamers that all
design it yourself
mal wont let me
come back to reality dom
please
reality
those kids your grandchildren
theyre waiting for
their father to
come back home
that their reality
and this job this last job
that how i get there
i would not be standing here
if i knew any other way
i need an architect
who as good as i was
ive got somebody better
ariadne
id like you to meet mr cobb
pleased to meet you
if you have a few
moments mr cobb has a
job offer hed like
to discuss with you
a work placement
not exactly
i have a test for you
youre not gonna tell
me anything first
before i describe the job i
have to know you can do it
why
it not strictly
speaking legal
you have two minutes
to design a maze
that it takes one minute to solve
stop
again
stop
youre gonna have to
do better than that
that more like it
they say we only use a fraction
of our brain true potential
now that when were awake
when were asleep our mind
can do almost anything
such as
imagine youre
designing a building
you consciously
create each aspect
but sometimes it feels
like it almost
creating itself if
you know what i mean
yeah like im discovering it
genuine inspiration right
now in a dream our mind
continuously does this
we create and perceive our
world simultaneously
and our mind does
this so well that
we dont even know it happening
that allows us to get right in
the middle of that process
how
by taking over the creating part
now this is where i need you
you create the world of the dream
we bring the subject
into that dream and
they fill it with
their subconscious
how could i ever
acquire enough detail
to make them think
that it reality
well dreams they feel real
while were in them right
it only when we wake up that we
realise something was
actually strange
let me ask you a question
you never really remember the
beginning of a dream do you
you always wind up right in the
middle of what going on
i guess yeah
so how did we end up here
well we just came from the
think about it ariadne
how did you get here
where are you right now
were dreaming
youre in the middle of
the workshop sleeping
this is your first lesson in
shared dreaming stay calm
if it just a dream
then why are you
because it never
just a dream is it
and a face full of
glass hurts like
hell when youre in
it it feels real
that why the military
developed dream sharing
it was a training
program for soldiers to
shoot stab and
strangle each other
and then wake up
how did architects
become involved
well someone had to
design the dreams right
why dont you give us
another five minutes
five minutes
what we were talking
for like at least an hour
in a dream your mind
functions more quickly
therefore time seems
to feel more slow
five minutes in the real world
gives you an hour in the dream
why dont you see what you can
get up to in five minutes
youve got the basic
layout bookshop cafe
almost everything
else is here too
who are the people
projections of my subconscious
yours
yes
remember you are the dreamer
you build this world
i am the subject my
mind populates it
you can literally talk
to my subconscious
that one of the ways we extract
information from the subject
how else do you do it
by creating something secure
like a bank vault or a jail
the mind automatically
fills it with
information it
trying to protect
you understand
then you break in and steal it
well
i guess i thought
that the dream space
would be all about the visual
but it more about
the feel of it
my question is what
happens when you start
messing with the
physics of it all
it something isnt it
yes it is
why are they all looking at me
because my subconscious feels that
someone else is
creating this world
the more you change
things the quicker
the projections start
to converge on you
converge
they sense the foreign
nature of the dreamer
they attack like white blood
cells fighting an infection
what theyre gonna attack us
no no
just you
this is great but
im telling you if
you keep changing
things like this
jeez mind telling your
subconscious to take it easy
it my subconscious
remember i cant control it
very impressive
i know this bridge this
place is real isnt it
yeah i cross it every day
to get to the college
never re-create places from your
memory always imagine new places
you draw from stuff
you know right
only use details
a streetlamp or a
phone booth never entire areas
why not
building a dream
from your memory
is the easiest way
to lose your grasp
on what real and
what is a dream
is that what happened to you
listen to me
this has nothing to do
with me understand
that why you need me
to build your dreams
hey get off her
back up back up
cobb cobb
get off her
let me go let me go
mal
mal
cobb wake me up
wake me up wake me up
no
mal no no
wake me up
hey hey hey look at me
youre okay youre okay
hey
why wouldnt i wake up
there was still time on the clock
you cant wake up from within
the dream unless you die
shell need a totem
what
a totem it a small personal
that some subconscious
youve got on you cobb
she a real charmer
oh
i see you met mrs cobb
she his wife
yeah so a totem you need a
small object potentially heavy
something you can have on
you that no one else knows
like a coin
no
it needs to be more unique than
that like this is a loaded die
no i cant let you touch it
that would defeat the purpose
see only i know the
balance and the
weight of this
particular loaded die
that way when you
look at your totem
you know beyond a
doubt that youre
not in someone else dream
i dont know if you
cant see what going
on or if you just
dont want to
but cobb has some serious problems
that he tried to
bury down there
and im not about to just open
my mind to someone like that
shell be back ive
never seen anyone
pick it up that quickly before
reality not gonna be enough for
her now and when
she comes back
when she comes back youre
gonna have her building mazes
where are you gonna be
i gotta go visit eames
eames no he in mombasa
it cobol back yard
it a necessary risk
well there plenty
of good thieves
we dont just need a thief
we need a forger
rub them together all you want
theyre not gonna breed
you never know
im gonna get you a drink
youre buying
your spelling hasnt improved
piss off
how your handwriting
it versatile
good
thank you very much
inception
now before you bother telling
me it impossible let me
no it perfectly possible
it just bloody difficult
interesting because arthur keeps
telling me it cant be done
arthur you still working
with that stick in the mud
he is good at what he does right
oh he the best but
he has no imagination
not like you
listen if youre gonna perform
inception you need imagination
let me ask you something
have you done it before
we tried it we got the idea
in place but it didnt take
you didnt plant it deep enough
no it not just about depth
you need the simplest
version of the idea
in order for it to
grow naturally in
your subject mind
it a subtle art
so what is this idea
that you need to plant
we need the heir of
a major corporation
to dissolve his father empire
right there you have various
political motivations
and anti-monopolistic
sentiments and so forth
but all of that stuff it
it really at the mercy of your
subject prejudice you see
what you have to do is start
at the absolute basic
which is what
the relationship with the father
do you have a chemist
no not yet
right okay well there
a man here yusuf
he formulates his own
versions of the compounds
why dont you take me there
once youve lost your
tail the man at the bar
cobol engineering
that price on my head
was that dead or alive
dont remember let see
if he starts shooting
run interference ill
meet you downstairs
in the bar in say half an hour
back here
this is the last place
theyd suspect
all right
freddy freddy simmonds
my god it you isnt it
no it isnt you
not dreaming now are you
get him
there
one cafe
one cafe
one cafe
care for a lift mr cobb
what are you doing in mombasa
im here to protect my investment
ah so this is your idea
of losing a tail huh
different tail
cobb said youd be back
i tried not to come but
but there nothing quite like it
it just
pure creation
shall we take a look at some
paradoxical architecture
youre gonna have to
master a few tricks
if youre gonna build three
complete dream levels excuse me
what kind of tricks
in a dream you can cheat
architecture into
impossible shapes
that lets you create closed
loops like the penrose steps
the infinite staircase
see
paradox
so a closed loop like that
will help you disguise the
boundaries of the
dream you create
but how big do these
levels have to be
it could be anything
from the floor
of a building to an entire city
they have to be complicated enough
that we can hide from
the projections
a maze
right a maze
and the better the maze
then the longer we have before
the projections catch us
exactly
my subconscious seems
polite enough
ha ha you wait
theyll turn ugly
no one likes to feel someone else
messing around in their mind
cobb cant build any more can he
i dont know if he
cant but he wont
he thinks it safer if he
doesnt know the layouts
why
he wont tell me but
i think it mal
his ex-wife
no not his ex
theyre still together
no
no she dead
what you see in there is
just his projection of her
what was she like in real life
she was lovely
you are seeking a chemist
yes
to formulate compounds for a job
and to go into the field with us
no i rarely go into
the field mr cobb
well wed need you
there to tailor
compounds specific to our needs
which are
great depth
a dream within a
dream two levels
three
not possible that many dreams
within dreams is too unstable
it is possible you just
have to add a sedative
a powerful sedative
how many team members
five
six
the only way to know youve done
the job is if i go in with you
there no room for tourists
on a job like this mr saito
this time it seems there is
this i think is a good place
to start i use it every day
what for
here ill show you
perhaps you will not want to see
after you
ten twelve all
connected bloody hell
they come every day
to share the dream
you see very stable
how long do they dream for
three four hours each day
in dream time
with this compound about 40
hours each and every day
why do they do it
tell him mr cobb
after a while it becomes
the only way you can dream
do you still dream mr cobb
they come here every day to sleep
no
they come to be woken up
the dream has become
their reality
who are you to say otherwise sir
let see what you can do
you know how to find me
you know what you have to do
sharp no
are you all right mr cobb
yeah yeah
everything just fine
robert fischer
heir to the fischer
morrow energy conglomerate
what your problem
with this mr fischer
that not your concern
mr saito this isnt your
typical corporate espionage
you asked me for inception
i do hope you understand the
gravity of that request
now the seed that
we plant in this
man mind will grow into an idea
this idea will define him
it may come to change
well it may come to change
everything about him
were the last company
standing between
them and total energy dominance
and we can no longer compete
soon theyll control the energy
supply of half the world
in effect they become
a new superpower
the world needs robert
fischer to change his mind
that where we come in
how is robert fischer
relationship with his father
rumour is the relationship
is quite complicated
well we cant work based
solely on rumour can we
can you get me access to
this man here browning
fischer senior right-hand man
fischer junior godfather
it should be possible if you
can get the right references
references are something of a
speciality for me mr saito
im not smelling settlement
here take them down
mr browning
maurice fischer policy is always
one of avoiding litigation
well shall we voice your
concerns with maurice directly
not sure that necessary
no no no i think we should
how is he
i dont want to bother him
unnecessarily but
robert i told you keep out the
damn wait so do it get
mr fischer
put it through
never never never do
the same as i asked
leave that
here
must be a cherished memory of his
i put it beside his bed
he hasnt even noticed
robert
we need to talk about
a power of attorney
i know this is hard
but it imperative
not now uncle peter
the vultures are circling
and the sicker maurice
fischer becomes
the more powerful peter
browning becomes
ive had ample opportunity
to observe browning
and adopt his physical
presence study
his mannerisms and
so on and so forth
so now in the first layer of the
dream i can impersonate browning
and suggest concepts to
fischer conscious mind
then when we take him
a level deeper
his own projection of browning
should feed that
right back to him
so he gives himself the idea
precisely that the
only way it will stick
it has to seem self-generated
eames i am impressed
your condescension as always is
much appreciated
arthur thank you
were you going under on your own
no no i was just
running some experiments
i didnt realise
anyone was here so
yeah i was just i was
working on my totem actually
here let me take a look
so youre learning huh
an elegant solution for
keeping track of reality
was it your idea
no it was
it was mal actually this
this one was hers
she would spin it in
the dream and it
would never topple
just spin and spin
arthur told me she passed away
how are the mazes coming along
each level relates to the part
of the subject subconscious
that we are trying to access
so im making the bottom
level a hospital
so fischer will bring his father
you know i actually i have
a question about this layout
no no no dont
show me specifics
only the dreamer should
know the layout
why is that so important
in case one of us brings
in our projections
we dont want them knowing
the details of the maze
you mean in case you bring mal in
you cant keep her out can you
right
you cant build
because if you know the
maze then she knows it
well shed sabotage
the whole operation
cobb do the others know
no no they dont
youve gotta warn them if
this is getting worse
no one said it getting worse
i need to get home that
all i care about right now
why cant you go home
because they think i killed her
thank you
for what
for not asking whether i did
i will split up my
father empire
now this is obviously
an idea that
robert himself would
choose to reject
which is why we need to plant
it deep in his subconscious
the subconscious is motivated
by emotion right not reason
we need to find a way to translate
this into an emotional concept
how do you translate business
strategy into emotion
that what were
here to figure out
robert relationship
with his father
is stressed to say the least
can we run with that
we suggest breaking
up his father
company as a screw
you to the old man
no because i think
positive emotion
trumps negative
emotion every time
we all yearn for
reconciliation for catharsis
we need robert fischer to have a
positive emotional
reaction to all this
all right well try this
my father accepts
that i want to create
for myself not follow
in his footsteps
that might work
might were gonna need to do
a little better than might
thank you for your
contribution arthur
forgive me for wanting a
little specificity eames
specificity
inception not about
being specific
when we get inside his mind were
gonna have to work
with what we find
on the top level we open up his
relationship with his father
and say i will not follow
in my father footsteps
then the next level
down we feed him
i will create
something for myself
then by the time
we hit the bottom
level we bring out the big guns
my father doesnt
want me to be him
exactly
three layers down
the dreams are gonna
collapse with the
slightest disturbance
sedation
for sleep stable enough to create
three layers of dreaming
well have to combine it with
an extremely powerful sedative
good night
the compound well be using
to share the dream
creates a clear connection
between dreamers
whilst accelerating
brain function
in other words more
time on each level
brain function in the dream
will be about 20 times normal
and when you enter a dream within
that dream the
effect is compounded
it three dreams that
0 hours times 20
maths was never my strong
subject how much time is that
it a week the first level down
six months the second level
down and the third level
that 0 years
whod wanna be stuck in
a dream for 0 years
depends on the dream
so once weve made the
plant how do we get out
im hoping you have something more
elegant than shooting
me in the head
a kick
what a kick
this ariadne would be a kick
it that feeling of falling
you get that jolts you awake
snaps you out of the dream
we gonna feel a kick
with this sedation
that the clever part
i customised the sedative to leave
inner-ear function unimpaired
that way however deep the sleep
the sleeper still feels falling
or tipping
the trick is to synchronise a kick
that can penetrate
all three levels
we could use a
musical countdown to
synchronise the different kicks
he hasnt got any surgery
scheduled no dental nothing
wasnt he supposed to
have a knee operation
nothing nothing
that theyll put him
under for anyway and we need
we need at least a good 0 hours
sydney to los angeles
one of the longest flights in the
world he makes it
every two weeks
he must be flying private then
not if there were unexpected
maintenance with his plane
it would have to be a 747
why that
on a 747 the pilot up top
the first-class
cabin in the nose
so no one would walk through
youd have to buy out
the entire cabin
and the first-class
flight attendant
i bought the airline
it seemed neater
well looks like we
have our 0 hours
ariadne terrific
work by the way
you know how to find me
you know what you have to do
you remember when you
asked me to marry you
of course i do
you said you had a dream
that wed grow old together
and we can
you shouldnt be here
just wanted to see
what kind of tests
youre doing on your
own every night
this has nothing to do with you
this has everything to do with me
youve asked me to
share dreams with you
not these these are my dreams
why do you do this to yourself
it the only way i
can still dream
why is it so important to dream
in my dreams were
still together
these arent just dreams
these are memories and you
said never to use memories
i know i did
youre trying to keep her
alive you cant let her go
you dont understand these
are moments i regret
theyre memories that
i have to change
well what down there
that you regret
listen there only one thing
you need to understand about me
this is your house
mine and mal yes
where is she
she already gone
that my son james
he digging for
something maybe a worm
that phillipa
i thought about calling
out to them
so theyd turn and smile
and i could see
those beautiful faces of
theirs but it all too late
right now or never cobb
then i start to panic
i realise im gonna
regret this moment
that i need to see their
faces one last time
james phillipa come on in
but the moment past
and whatever i do i cant
change this moment
as im about to
call out to them
they run away
if im ever gonna see their faces
again ive gotta get back home
the real world
what are you doing here
my name is
i know who you are what
are you doing here
im just trying to understand
how could you understand
do you know what it
is to be a lover
to be half of a whole
no
ill tell you a riddle
youre waiting for a train
a train that will
take you far away
you know where you hope
this train will take you
but you dont know for sure
but it doesnt matter
how can it not matter to you
where that train will take you
because youll be together
how could you bring her here dom
what is this place
this is a hotel suite where we
used to spend our anniversary
what happened here
you promised you promised
wed be together
please i need you to
stay here just for now
you said wed be together you
said wed grow old together
ill come back for you i promise
do you think you can just build a
prison of memories to lock her in
do you really think that
that gonna contain her
it time
maurice fischer just
died in sydney
when the funeral
thursday in los angeles
robert should
accompany the body no
later than tuesday
we should move
all right
cobb im coming with you
i promised miles no
the team needs someone
who understands
what youre struggling with
and it doesnt have to be me
but then you have to show
arthur what i just saw
get us another seat on the plane
if i get on this plane and you
dont honour our agreement
when we land i go to jail
for the rest of my life
complete the job en route
i make one phone call
from the plane
you have no trouble getting
through immigration
im sorry
oh yeah absolutely
thank you
excuse me i think this is
yours you must have dropped it
would you care for a drink
oh water please
oh same please
thank you
you know i couldnt
help but notice
but you wouldnt
happen to be related
to the maurice fischer would you
yes he
he was my father
well he was a very inspiring
figure im sorry for your loss
here you go
thank you
hey
to your father
may he rest in peace huh
couldnt have peed
before you went under
sorry
bit too much free champagne
before take-off
ha ha bloody ha
we know he gonna be looking
for a taxi in this weather
asshole hey man why
dont you try
walk away
just have him ca
i gotta go
all right taxi thank you
all right third and
market snappy
what are you doing
sorry i thought it was free
it not
maybe we could share
maybe not can you pull
over and get this
great
come on
there $500 in there the
wallet worth more than that
you might at least
drop me at my stop
im afraid that it doesnt
cover him
down down now
what the hell is going on
this wasnt in the design
cobb
cobb
get him
are you all right
yeah im okay im okay
fischer okay unless
he gets carsick
saito
get fischer in the back room now
get him in the back room move
what the hell happened
has he been shot is he dying
i dont know
jesus christ
what happened to you
blocked by a freight train
why put a train in a
downtown intersection
i didnt
whered it come from
why the hell were we ambushed
those were not normal projections
theyd been trained
for god sakes
how could he be trained
fischer had an extractor
teach his subconscious
to defend itself
so his subconscious
is militarised
it shouldve shown
in the research
why the hell didnt it
calm down
dont tell me to calm down
this was your job goddamn it
this was your responsibility
you were meant to check
fischer background
we are not prepared for this
we have dealt with
sub-security before
well be more careful and
were gonna be fine
this was not a part of
the plan he dying
put him out his misery
no dont do that dont do that
cobb hey hey
he in agony im waking him up
no it wont wake him up
what do you mean it
wont wake him up
when we die in a
dream we wake up
not from this
were too heavily sedated
to wake up that way
right so what
happens when we die
we drop into limbo
are you serious
limbo
unconstructed dream space
well what the hell is down there
just raw infinite subconscious
nothing is down there except for
what might have
been left behind
by anyone sharing the dream who
been trapped there before
which in our case is just you
how long could we be stuck
cant even think about
trying to escape until
the sedation
how long
decades it could be infinite ask
him he the one
who been there
let get him upstairs
great
thank you
so now were trapped in fischer
mind battling his
own private army
and if we get killed
well be lost in limbo till our
brains turn to scrambled egg
someone got first aid
you knew these risks
and didnt tell us
there werent meant to be risks
i didnt know wed be
dealing with gunfire
you had no right
this was the only way to
go three layers deep
you knew about this and
went along with it
i trusted him
when when he promised
you half his share
no his whole share besides
he said hed done it before
what with mal because
that worked so good
that has nothing to
do with it i did
what i had to to get
to my children
you led us into a war
zone with no way out
there is a way out we
continue on with the job
and we do it as
fast as possible
and we get out using the
kick just like before
forget it we go any deeper
we just raise the stakes
i am sitting this one
out on this level
fischer security is
surrounding this place
ten hours of flight time
is a week at this level
that means each and
every one of us will
be killed that i
can guarantee you
we have no other
choice but to continue
on and do it as fast as possible
downwards is the
only way forwards
get ready
you come on let
go shake him up
im insured against kidnapping
for up to 0 million
this should be very simple
shut up it wont be
in your father office
below the bookshelves
is his personal safe we
need the combination
i dont know any safe
that doesnt mean you dont
know the combination
tell us what it is
i dont know
we have it on good
authority you do know
yeah whose authority
five hundred dollars this cost
what inside it
cash cards id and this
useful
maybe
youre on youve got an hour
an hour
i was supposed to have
all night to crack this
and saito wasnt supposed
to be shot in the chest
youve got one hour now get
us something useful please
what that
good authority
uncle peter
just make them stop
the combination
i dont know it
why does browning say you do
i dont know
just let me talk to him
and ill find out
you have one hour start talking
you all right
you okay
those bastards have had
at me for two days
they have someone with access
to your father office
theyre trying to open his safe
yeah
they thought id know the
combination but i dont know it
yeah well neither do i so
what
maurice told me that
when he passed
you were the only one
able to open it
no he never gave
me any combination
maybe he did i mean
maybe you just
didnt know it was a combination
well what then
i dont know some meaningful
combination of numbers
based on your experiences
with maurice
we didnt have very many
meaningful experiences together
perhaps after your mother died
after my mother died you
know what he told me
robert there really
nothing to be said
oh well he was bad with emotion
i was  uncle peter
how he doing
he in a lot of pain
when we get down to
the lower levels
the pain will be less intense
and if he dies
worst-case scenario
when he wakes up his
mind is completely gone
cobb ill still honour
the arrangement
i appreciate that saito
but when you wake
up you wont even
remember that we had
an arrangement
limbo is gonna
become your reality
youre gonna be lost
down there so long
that youre gonna
become an old man
filled with regret
waiting to die alone
no
ill come back
and well be young
men together again
breathe
these people are gonna kill us if
we dont give them
the combination
they just wanna ransom us
i heard them
theyre gonna lock us in that van
and then drive it into the river
all right what is in the safe
something for you
maurice always said it was his
most precious gift to you
a will
maurice will is
with port and dunn
that an alternate
this would supersede the
other if you want it to
it splits up the component
businesses of fischer morrow
itd be the end of the
entire empire as we know it
destroying my whole inheritance
why would he suggest such a thing
i just dont know
he loved you robert
in his own way
in his own way
at the end
he called me in to his deathbed
he could barely speak
but he took the trouble to
tell me one last thing
he pulled me close
and i could only make out
one word
disappointed
when were you in limbo
you might have the
rest of the team
convinced to carry
on with this job
but they dont know the truth
truth what truth
the truth that at any
minute you might
bring a freight train
through the wall
the truth that mal is bursting
through your subconscious
and the truth that as we
go deeper into fischer
were also going deeper into you
and im not sure were
gonna like what we find
we were working together
we were exploring the concept
of a dream within a dream
i kept pushing things
i wanted to go deeper and
deeper i wanted to go further
i just didnt understand
the concept that
hours could turn into
years down there
that we could get
trapped so deep
that when we wound up on the
shore of our own subconscious
we lost sight of what was real
we created we built the
world for ourselves
we did that for years
we built our own world
how long were you stuck there
something like 50 years
jesus
how could you stand it
it wasnt so bad at
first feeling like gods
eventually it just became
impossible for me
to live like that
and what about for her
she had locked something away
something deep inside her
a truth that she had once
known but chose to forget
limbo became her reality
what happened when you woke up
well to wake up from that
after years after decades
to become old souls thrown
back into youth like that
i knew something was wrong with
her she just wouldnt admit it
eventually she told me the truth
she was possessed by an idea
this one very simple idea
that changed everything
that our world wasnt real
that she needed to wake up
to come back to reality
that in order to get back home
we had to kill ourselves
what about your children
she thought they
were projections
that our real
children were waiting
for us up there somewhere
im their mother
calm down
i can tell the difference
if this is my dream why
cant i control this
you dont know youre dreaming
she was certain there was
nothing i could do
no matter how much i begged
no matter how much i pleaded
she wanted to do it but
she could not do it alone
she loved me too much so she came
up with a plan on our anniversary
sweetheart what are you doing
join me
just just step back
inside all right
just step back
inside now come on
no im going to jump and
youre coming with me
no im not
now you listen to me
if you jump youre not gonna wake
up remember youre gonna die
now just step back inside
come on step back inside
so we can talk about this
weve talked enough
mal
come out onto the ledge
or ill jump right now
okay
were gonna talk about this
all right
im asking you to
take a leap of faith
no honey
no i cant you know
i cant do that
take a second think
about our children
think about james
think about phillipa now
if i go without you theyll
take them away anyway
what does that mean
i filed a letter
with our attorney
explaining how im
fearful for my safety
how youve threatened to kill me
why did you do this
i love you dom
why did why would
you do this to me
ive freed you from the guilt
of choosing to leave them
were going home to
our real children
oh no no no mal
you listen to me
all right mal
look at me please
youre waiting for a train
mal goddamn it dont do this
a train that will
take you far away
james and phillipa
are waiting for you
you know where you hope
this train will take you
but you cant know for sure
mal look at me
but it doesnt matter
mal goddamn it
mal listen to me
because youll be together
sweetheart look at me mal no
jesus christ
she had herself declared sane by
three different psychiatrists
it made it impossible
for me to try
to explain the nature
of her madness
so i ran
right now or never cobb
james phillipa
come on in come on
all right let go
i left my children
behind and ive been
trying to buy my way
back ever since
your guilt defines her
it what powers her
but you are not responsible for
the idea that destroyed her
and if we are gonna
succeed in this
you have to forgive yourself and
youre gonna have to confront her
but you dont have
to do that alone
no youre not
im doing it for the others
because they have no idea the risk
theyve taken coming
down here with you
we have to move
time up
all right i dont
know any combination
not consciously anyway
how about instinctively huh
i got somebody in
your father office
right now ready to tap
in the combination
give me the first six numbers
that come to your head right now
i have no idea
right now
i said right now right now
five two eight four nine one
youll have to do
better than that
all right bag them
youre going for a ride
were worth more to you
alive you hear me
whatd you get
relationship with his father
is worse than we imagined
this helps us how
the stronger the issues the
more powerful the catharsis
how are we gonna reconcile them
im working on that
work faster the projections
are closing in quick
we gotta break out of here
before were totally boxed in
damn it
you mustnt be afraid to dream
a little bigger darling
we need to shift his animosity
from his father to his godfather
destroy his one
positive relationship
no repair his relationship
with his father
whilst exposing his
godfather true nature
we should charge fischer a lot
more than saito for this job
his security is gonna get
worse as we go deeper
i think we run with mr charles
no
who mr charles
bad idea
the second we get
into that hotel his
security gonna be all over us
we run with mr charles
like on the stein job
youve done it before
yeah and it didnt work
the subject realised
he was dreaming and
his subconscious
tore us to pieces
excellent but you
learned a lot right
i need some kind of distraction
no problem
how about a lovely lady
that ive used before
listen to me you drive
carefully all right
everything down there is
gonna be unstable as hell
dont jump too soon
we only got one
shot at that kick
we gotta make it
ill play the music
to let you know
it coming the rest is on you
you ready
ready
sweet dreams
am i boring you
i was telling you my story i
guess it wasnt to your liking
i have a lot on my mind
there goes mr charles
mr fischer right
pleasure to see you again rod
green from marketing i
and you must be
leaving
in case you get bored
mustve blown you off
that is unless her phone number
really is only six digits
funny way to make friends someone
stealing your wallet like that
goddamn it the wallet alone
is worth at least 500
about $500 right
dont worry about it my people
are already on it as we speak
who or what is mr charles
it a gambit designed
to turn fischer
against his own subconscious
and why dont you approve
it involves telling the
mark that he dreaming
which involves attracting
a lot of attention to us
didnt cobb say never to do that
so now youve noticed
how much time
cobb spends doing things
he says never to do
mr saito can i have a moment
im sorry but
hold on wait
you look a bit perkier
very amusing mr eames
turbulence on the plane
no it much closer
that yusuf driving
im sorry who did
you say you were
rod green from marketing
but that not true at all is it
my name is mr charles you
remember me dont you
im the head of your
security down here
get out on a different
floor keep moving
dump the wallet security
will be looking for that
okay
we need to buy cobb
a little more time
security huh
you work for the hotel
no no
i specialise in a very
specific type of security
subconscious security
youre talking about dreams
are you talking about extraction
i am here to protect you
mr fischer im here to
protect you in the event
that someone tries to access
your mind through your dreams
youre not safe here
theyre coming for you
strange weather isnt it
you feel that
what happening
cobb drawing fischer attention
to the strangeness of the dream
which is making his subconscious
look for the dreamer
for me quick give me a kiss
theyre still looking at us
yeah it was worth a shot
we should probably
get out of here
you feel that youve actually
been trained for this mr fischer
pay attention to
the strangeness of
the weather the shift in gravity
none of this is real
youre in a dream
now the easiest way for
you to test yourself
is to try and remember
how you arrived
at this hotel can you do that
yeah i
no breathe breathe
remember your training
accept the fact that
youre in a dream
and im here to
protect you go on
youre not real
no
no im a projection
of your subconscious
i was sent here to protect
you in the event
that extractors tried to
pull you into a dream
and i believe that what
going on right now mr fischer
yeah
okay
okay
can you get me out of here
right away follow me
hold on a second
jesus christ what are you doing
these men were sent here
to abduct you all right
if you want my help you
have to remain calm
i need you to work
with me mr fischer
if this is a dream i should just
kill myself to wake up right
i wouldnt do that if i
were you mr fischer
i believe they have you sedated
and if you pull that trigger
you may not wake up
you may go into a
further dream state
now you know what
im talking about
you remember the training
remember what i said to you
give me the gun
this room should be
directly below 528
yeah
think mr fischer think
what do you remember
from before this dream
there was a lot of gunfire
there was rain
uncle peter
oh my god weve been kidnapped
where were they holding you
they had us in the back of a van
that explains the gravity shifts
youre in the back of
a van keep going
it had something to do with
something to do with a safe
god why is it so
hard to remember
it like trying to remember a
dream after youve woken up
listen it takes
years of practise
you and browning have been
pulled into this dream
because theyre trying to steal
something from your mind
i need you to focus and try
and remember what that is
what is it mr fischer think
a combination they demanded the
first numbers to pop into my head
theyre trying to extract a
number from your subconscious
it can represent anything
were in a hotel right now
we should try hotel rooms what
was the number mr fischer
try and remember for me
this is very important
five
five two it was something
it was a long number
that good we can start
there fifth floor
yep
so do you use a timer
no i have to judge it for myself
while youre all asleep in
528 i wait for yusuf kick
well how will you know
his music warns me
and then when the van hits
the barrier of the bridge
that should be unmistakable
so we get a nice
synchronised kick
if it too soon we
wont get pulled out
but if it too late i
wont be able to drop us
well why not
because the van will
be in freefall
cant drop you without gravity
right
theyre with me go on
mr charles
do you know what
that is mr fischer
yeah i think so
they were trying to put you under
im already under
under again
what do you mean a
dream within a dream
hey i see youve changed
im sorry
oh im sorry i mistook
you for a friend
oh
good-looking fellow im sure
no no no that fischer
projection of browning
let follow him and
see how he behaves
why
because how he acts
will tell us
if fischer is starting to suspect
his motives the way
we want him to
uncle peter
you said you were
kidnapped together
well not exactly they already
had him they were torturing him
and you saw them torture him
the kidnappers are
working for you
robert
youre trying to get that safe
open to get the alternate will
fischer morrow has been my entire
life i cant let you destroy it
im not gonna throw
away my inheritance
i couldnt let you rise to
your father last taunt
what taunt
the will robert that will
that his last insult
a challenge for you to build
something for yourself
by telling you youre not
worthy of his accomplishments
what but that he
was disappointed
im sorry
but he wrong
you can build a better
company than he ever did
mr fischer he lying
how do you know
trust me it what i do
he hiding something and we
need to find out what that is
i need you to do the same thing to
him that he was
going to do to you

route into the complex
fischer youll be going with him
all right what about you

about 20 minutes
ago i thought it was
the wind up here

so what do we do
we move fast
yusuf 0 seconds from the jump
which gives arthur three minutes
hey
that him
which gives us what
sixty minutes
can they make that
route in an hour
they have to climb to the terrace
then they need a new route
a more direct route
it designed as a labyrinth
there must be access routes
that cut through the maze
eames
did eames add any features
i dont think i should tell you
we dont have time for
this did he add anything
he added an air-duct system
that can cut through the maze
good explain it to them
saito

okay that the antechamber
outside the strong room
does the strong room have windows
it wouldnt be very
strong if it did
let hope fischer likes
what he finds in there
are those projections
his subconscious

parts of his mind

army headed your way

reviving him his
mind already trapped down there

happen in there i

fischer down there
not enough time
no but there will be
enough time down there
and we will find him
okay as soon as
arthur music kicks in
just use the defibrillator
to revive him
we can give him his
own kick down below
look you get him in there
as soon as the music ends
you blow up the hospital
and we all ride the kick
back up the layers
it worth a shot if
saito can hold the
guards off while i
set the charges
saito will never make it will he
cobb come on weve
gotta try this
go for it
if you are not back
before the kick

needs to happen here
mal gonna be down there
i know where to find her
shell have fischer
how do you know
because she wants me
to come after him
she wants me back
down there with her
all right
this is your world
it was
and this is where shell be
come on
saito saito
i need you to take care of fischer
while i go set some charges okay
no room for tourists
on these jobs
dont be silly
you built all this
this is incredible
we built for years
then we started in
on the memories
this way
this was our neighbourhood
places from our past
that was our first apartment
then we moved to that
building right there
after mal became pregnant
that became our home
you reconstructed all
of this from memory
like i told you we
had lots of time
what is that
that the house mal grew up in
well will she be in there
no
come on
we both wanted to live in a house
but we loved this
type of building
in the real world wed have
to choose but not here
how are we gonna
bring fischer back
were gonna have to come up
with some kind of a kick
what
im gonna improvise
listen there
something you should
know about me about inception
an idea is like a
virus resilient
highly contagious
and the smallest seed
of an idea can grow
it can grow to define
or destroy you
the smallest idea such as
your world is not real
simple little thought
that changes everything
so certain of your
world of what real
do you think he is
or do you think he
as lost as i was
i know what real mal
no creeping doubts
not feeling persecuted dom
chased around the globe
by anonymous corporations
and police forces
the way the projections
persecute the dreamer
admit it
you dont believe in
one reality any more
so choose
choose to be here
choose me
you know what i have to do
i have to get back to our
children because you left them
because you left us
youre wrong
im not wrong
youre confused
our children are here
and youd like to see their
faces again wouldnt you
yes but im gonna see
them up above mal
up above
listen to yourself
these are our children
watch
james phillipa
dont do this mal please
those arent my children
you keep telling yourself that
but you dont believe it
no i know it
what if youre wrong
what if im what real
you keep telling
yourself what you know
but what do you believe
what do you feel
guilt
i feel guilt mal
and no matter what i do no
matter how hopeless i am
no matter how confused that
guilt is always there
reminding me of the truth
what truth
that the idea that caused you to
question your reality
came from me
you planted the idea in my mind
what is she talking about
the reason i knew
inception was possible
was because i did it to her first
i did it to my own wife
why
we were lost in here
i knew we needed to escape
but she wouldnt accept it
she had locked something
away something deep inside
a truth that she had once
known but chose to forget
and she couldnt break free
so i decided to search for it
i went deep into the recess of her
mind and found that secret place
and i broke in
and i planted an idea
a simple little idea that
would change everything
that her world wasnt real
that death was the only escape
youre waiting for a train
a train thatll take you far away
you know where you hope
this train will take you
but you cant know for sure
yet it doesnt matter
now tell me why
because youll be together
but i never knew
that that idea would
grow in her mind like a cancer
that even after she woke
that even after you
came back to reality
that youd continue to believe
your world wasnt real
that death was the only escape
mal no jesus
you infected my mind
i was trying to save you
you betrayed me
but you can make amends you
can still keep your promise
we can still be
together right here
in the world we built together
cobb we need to get fischer
you cant have him
if i stay here will
you let him go
what are you talking about
fischer is on the porch
go check he alive ariadne
cobb you cant do this
go check he alive
right now do it
he here and it time
but you have to come now
you take fischer
with you all right
you cant stay here
to be with her
im not saito dead by now
that means he down
here somewhere
that means i have to find him
i cant stay with her any more
because she doesnt exist
im the only thing you
do believe in any more
no
i wish
i wish more than anything but
i cant imagine you with
all your complexity
all your perfection
all your imperfection
you all right
yeah
look at you
youre just a shade youre
just a shade of my real wife
and you were the best
that i could do but
im sorry youre
just not good enough
