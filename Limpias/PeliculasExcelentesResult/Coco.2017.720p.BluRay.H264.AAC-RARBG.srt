sometimes i think im cursed
because of something that happened
before i was even born
see a long time ago
there was this family
the papa he was a musician
he and his family would sing
and dance and count their blessings
but he also had a dream
to play for the world
and one day he left with his guitar
and never returned
and the mamé
she didnt have time to cry
over that walk—away musician
after banishing all music from her life
she found a way
to provide for her daughter
she rolled up her sleeves
and she learned to make shoes
she could have made candy
or ﬁreworks or sparkly unden/vear
for wrestlers but no she chose shoes
then she taught her daughter
to make shoes
and later she taught her son—in—law
then her grandkids got roped in
as her family grew
so did the business
music had torn her family apart
but shoes held them all together
you see that woman was my great-
great—grandmother mamé imelda
she died way before i was born
but my family still tells her story
every year on dia de los muertos
the day of the dead
and her little girl she my
great—grandmother mamé coco
hola mama’ coco
how are you julio
actually my name is miguel
mama coco has trouble
remembering things
but it good to talk to her anyway
so i tell her pretty much everything
i used to run like this but now
i run like this which is way faster
and the winner is luchadora coco
i have a dimple on this side
but not on this side
dimple no dimple dimple no dimple
miguel eat your food
my abuelita she
mama coco daughter
oh youre a twig mijo
have some more
no gracias
i asked if you would like more tamalesl
si
that what i thought you said
abuelita runs our house
just like mama imelda did
no music
no music
-y aunque la vida
-no music
i think were the only family in méxico
who hates music
and my family ﬁne with that but me
-be back by lunch mijo
—love you mama
i am not like the rest of my family
-hola miguel
-hola
-muchas gracias
-de nada miguel
hey dante
sit down roll over shake
fist bump
good boy dante
i know im not supposed to love music
but it not my fault it his
ernesto de la cruz
the greatest musician of all time
right here in this very plaza
ernesto de la cruz took his first steps
toward becoming the most beloved
singer in mexican history
he started out a total nobody
from santa cecilia like me
but when he played music
he made people fall in love with him
he starred in movies
he had the coolest guitar he could ﬂy
and he wrote the best songs
but my all—time favorite it
-remember me
-remember me
though i have to say goodbye
-remember me
-remember me
dont let it make you cry
for even if im far away
i hold you in my heart
i sing a secret song to you
each night we are apart
remember me
though i have to travel far
-remember me
-remember me
each time you hear a sad guitar
know that im with you
the only way that i can be
until youre in my arms again
he lived the kind of life
you dream about
until 942
when he was crushed by a giant bell
i want to be just like him
sometimes i look at de la cruz and
i get this feeling like were connected
like if he could play music
maybe someday i could too
if it wasnt for my family
-ay-ay-ay muchacho
-huh
i asked for a shoe shine
not your life story
oh yeah sorry
i just cant really talk about
any of this at home so
if i were you id march
right up to my family and say
hey im a musician deal with it
—i could never say that
—you are a musician no
i dont know
i mean i only really play for myself
did de la cruz become the world
best musician by hiding his skills’
no he walked out onto that plaza
and he played out loud
mira mira theyre
setting up for tonight
the music competition
for dla de muertos
you want to be like your hero

they are as mysterious
as they are powerful
or maybe he just a dog
come i need your eyes
you are the audience darkness
and from the darkness a giant papaya
dancers emerge from the papaya
and the dancers are all me
and they go to drink from the milk
of their mother who is a cactus
but who is also me
and her milk is not milk but tears
is it too obvious
i think it just
the right amount of obvious
it could use some music
oh what if you did like
oh and then it could go
and what if everything was on fire
yes fire everywhere
inspired
you have the spirit of an artist
the dancers exit
the music fades the lights go out
and ernesto de la cruz
rises to the stage

ernesto doesnt do rehearsals

please miguel put my photo up
my friend youre being forgotten
-and whose fault is that
-héctor please
those were my songs you took

if im being forgotten it because
you never told anyone that i wrote them
that crazy
de la cruz wrote all his own songs
you want to tell him or should i
héctor i never meant to take credit
we made a great team but you died
and i only sang your songs because
i wanted to keep a part of you alive
how generous
you really did play together
i dont want to fight about it
ijust want you to make it right
miguel can put my photo up
and i can cross over the bridge
i can see my girl
ernesto remember the night i left

then im sending you off with a toast
to our friendship
iwould move heaven and earth for you
mi amigo saludl
you walked me to the train station
but i felt a pain in my stomach
i thought
it must have been something i ate
perhaps it was that chorizo my friend
or something i drank
i woke up dead

with reality héctor
all this time
i thought it was just bad luck
