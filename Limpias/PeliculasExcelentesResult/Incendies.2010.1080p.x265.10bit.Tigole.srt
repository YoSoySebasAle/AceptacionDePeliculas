executor of the will

all my assets are divided between
the twins jeanne and simon
my money will be halved
and my belongings
divided as they see fit

you know about our father
and that we have no brother
why did you let her write that
i understand your reaction
it very surprising

you knew her it cant be
one doesnt invent such things
not in a will
there this too
look your mother has left us
something rather
well sleep on it and
well be in touch
ill wait outside
thank you jean
sit down simon

and that job
a whole other matter
simon
bury your secretary how you want
but ill bury my mother normally
for once in her life
shell have acted normally
end of discussion
take your time
come back when simon calmer
i know it very unusual but
your mother wasnt crazy
jeanne

she ever mention a dog
big families always have a dog
do we have to find it now too
she fucking crazy
ill talk to jean
about what
having a normal funeral
well take care of her then you
where you going
bury her any way you want
cut it out
you werent there when she died
you were there when
she had her accident
you feel guilty about everything
i dont feel guilty
do you realize what we just heard
she gone christ
it over peace at last
i feel so fucking peaceful
im at peace
i can see that
the mathematics
youve studied until now
have sought to provide
clear and definitive answers
to clear and definitive problems
now you are embarking
on a new adventure
you will face insoluble problems
that will lead to other
equally insoluble problems
friends will insist that the object
of your toil is futile
youll have no way
of defending yourself
for the problems will be
of mind-boggling complexity
welcome to pure mathematics
and the realm of solitude
let me introduce my assistant
miss jeanne marwan
hello
well start with
the collatz conjecture
what does your intuition tell you
your intuition is always right
that why you have the makings
of a true mathematician
but for this
youre going to need help
do you have family there
any contacts
it ridiculous niv
you just learned that
a your father is alive
and b you have another brother
what ridiculous is
to challenge the inevitable
you have to know
or your mind will never be at peace
and without peace of mind
no pure mathematics
you need a starting point
my father died during the war
in daresh
that the unknown variable
you never start
with the unknown variable
my mother from der om
a village in the fouad
she studied french
at daresh university
if she studied there hope
sad haidar
youll pay a visit to sad haidar
an old friend who teaches in daresh
you can trust him
mum
are you alright
what are you doing
mum
are you ok
madame youre on my towel
mum
what happened
where jeanne
mum
does she get migraines
no
memory lapses
no
incidences of falling
no
moments of confusion
she usually confused
no she never confused
wahab come
let go of my sister
where are you going
son of a refugee
nicolas stop

wahab
well seek you in your camps
and slaughter you

you stained our family honour
that enough

youve humiliated us
ruined the family name
why my god have you
cast us into darkness
my god what have you done
why did you do this to me
what am i to do with you
should i kill you
im pregnant grandma
my god blackness everywhere
why
why did you do this to us

eat if you want your child
to be strong
listen to me carefully
there nothing here for you now
ill help you after the birth
i want you to leave here
youll stay with your uncle charbel
in town
youll go to school there
youll learn to read to think
to escape this misery

promise me that youll go to school
i promise you grandma
i promise you
take a good look at your mother
so youll recognize her
ill find you again one day
i promise you my love
be careful
dont worry
come it time you left
i see terrible times ahead
one day ill find you my son
i received the message
from my friend niv cohen
but i cant help you
because back then
i was teaching the history
of mathematics at paris xi
more precisely
the period when
leonhard euler succeeded
although blind in first providing
a formal mathematical resolution
to the problem of
the seven bridges of knigsberg
yes he defied diderot
at the court
by declaring
sir
e exponent pi +  = 0
therefore god exists
niv niv niv
hello do you speak french
of course can i help you
im looking for someone
who might know this woman
she studied here
about 35 years ago
youre kidding right
i wasnt born i cant help

you must know someone who can help
ive travelled too far please
her name is nawal marwan
youre kind
no i want to get rid of you
najat it me
got any time to waste
she looks familiar
perhaps she worked
on the student newspaper
that was long ago
the people who left
changed their identity
but it striking
the photograph of your mother
was taken in kfar ryat
look here
it the sign for kfar ryat
it a prison in the south
you dont know of kfar ryat
no
then youre definitely not from here
you dont know the south
if the international community
does not intervene immediately
the refugees
crammed into camps
along the border
she here
we students oppose
the nationalist party
and expelling the refugees
in the south
the nationalists support
the christian right
who openly threaten
the refugees
the refugees are armed and
and have the support of most
of the muslims in this country
but you yourself are christian
we stand for peace
this is not about religion
nawal nawal
the radio
they shut the university
the nationalists closed
down the campus
nawal come back

there will be fighting
i want you to stay with me
there gunfire
girls come eat
mum they attacked the university
that no reason not to eat
christian villages in the south
were attacked
god help us
that why they shut the university
it wont be long
before it blows up here too
well go to the mountains
until things calm down
for how long
we go tomorrow
the rest of the family
is already there
what about school
the schools will close anyway
god only knows until when
and the newspaper
dont worry
the paper can survive
without us for a while
ideas only survive
if were there to defend them
exactly rafqa exactly

mrs maka
hello madame
thanks for seeing us
it about someone you knew
you know nawal marwan
you were a nurse at kfar ryat
she says she knew your mother
you helped our mother give birth
madame were looking
for the child she had in jail
can you help us
she worked in kfar ryat prison
she assisted her during delivery
she safeguarded the babies
and returned them to
the woman who sings upon her release
sarwan janaan
nawal marwan had twins
you really knew the woman who sings
you dont know what it means for me
nawal marwan worked  8 years for me
as my secretary
my wife and i were fond of her
and her children
but i realize i didnt really
know her after all
ready
ready
at my request
mr maddad did research
to find your brother and father
for the father abou tarek
there no death certificate
many in this country disappeared
he may have gone abroad
that what his kind often did
theyre either dead or they left
wait and see
maybe this is best
for the brother
your client mrs nawal marwan
is from the village of der om
she gave the child
to a midwife named elham
who placed him
at the kfar khout orphanage
in may  970
it was hard to locate the registries
many documents were destroyed
in the war
but i finally turned up the registries
the sisters of charity
collected and donated them
to the national archives
in may  970
the midwife of der om elham
gave up a male child for adoption
the only boy placed
at the orphanage that month
look he was registered
under the first name of nihad
the dates match
it him
he your brother nihad
kfar khout orphanage
nihad of may
that was his name for the records
nihad of the month of may
the month of arrival
was a temporary surname
there were no adoptions at the time
the war had started
in  974 the orphanage
was destroyed
we must ask who destroyed
kfar khout
to learn what happened
to the children
between you and me
given what occurred in the region
there little hope
he probably dead too
i didnt say dead
i said we lost his trace
theyre both dead
we open the letters finished
i wont allow it
this kind of thing is sacred
it would be like a rape
great it runs in the family
sorry
there one path left
but it somewhat radical
the warlord who razed
the orphanage is still alive
he may know what happened
to nihad and the others
it been an eternity
you must understand
those years saw a series of reprisals
that set off each other
with merciless logic
like an equation
a warlord is precisely
the kind of man with a long memory
hell remember believe me
wallat chamseddine
that his name
where do we find him
you dont find him he finds you
we can try something
do you like tea mr marwan
it your turn
youll travel to
the deressa refugee camp

of the woman who sings
and that youre looking
for nihad of may

named nihad of may
why do you want nihad of may
he my brother
my mother asked me to find him
how can you say that nihad of may
is the son of nawal marwan
my brother was placed
at the kfar khout orphanage
we found the birth records
the dates everything fits
nihad of may is my brother
my friends and i attacked
the christians of kfar khout
to avenge the aggressions
against our brother refugees
there was an orphanage
in kfar khout
i spared the children
and i took them with us
nihad was among them
we trained them prepared them
to fight alongside us
nihad had a gift
he was special
he quickly became
a formidable marksman
buthe wanted to find
his mother
he searched for months
i dont know what he saw or heard
he becamecrazed with war
he came back to see me
he wanted to be a martyr
his mother would see his photo
on every wall in the country
but i refused
he went back to daresh
he became the most dangerous
sniper in the region
a real machine
he would shoot at anyone
and then
there was the enemy invasion
and one morning
they captured nihad
hed killed seven soldiers
they didnt kill him
they trained him
and they sent him
to the kfar ryat prison

on my grave
and on it
engrave my name in the sun
my loves
where does your story begin
at your birth
if so it begins in horror
at the birth of your father
then it begins in a great love story
but i say your story
begins with a promise
to break the chain of anger
thanks to you
today i have finally kept it
the chain is broken
finally i can take the time
to cradle you
to gently sing a lullaby
to console you
nothing means more
than being together
i love you
your mother
