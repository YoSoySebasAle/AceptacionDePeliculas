superhit films
after retiring from acting
he joined the real estate business
according to his wife simi sinha
he left home with ten million rupees
to close a property deal
but he never returned
the police investigation is continuing
despite the government new rules

he was such a happy person
kamdar
read akash his statement
hell sign it
on 27 june 208 sinha asked me
to play the piano at his home
for his wedding anniversary
i arrived there at one sharp
pramodji came ten minutes later
we spoke briefly but he had
to rush away to meet a builder
all lies
they shot him stuffed his body in a bag
snapped a finger to remove his ring
i can see look at my eyes i can see
catch him
daani theyre having an affair
he talking utter rubbish
youre the liar
i waited for a while
but he did not come back
at 2pm mrs sinha asked me to leave
may the days pass
may the seconds tick by
lost in memories of her
lost in her words
lost when i see her
since the day we met
colour floods my dreams
may the days pass
thank you
pramod always used to say
bury the past think of the future
but today when i look ahead
i see no future
he left me all alone
on our wedding anniversary
he asked akash over as a surprise
but my husband came home late
he talked to us briefly then he left
just as he was leaving he said
simi ill be right back
im so sorry to hear the news
i just couldnt believe it
daani darling take care of yourself
come and see me
simi told you a bunch of lies
lies
pramod was not late
i saw everything
a man showed up first
then pramod arrived
the man was inside in the house
when the piano player got there
who are you
mrs da
im the principal of st anne
and pramod neighbour
pramod and my husband
were close friends
they must be enjoying a drink together
in heaven
go on
i returned home from the post office
a man was in the lift with me
he went into pramod flat
he was inside when pramod arrived
with gifts in hand
the blind piano player
was the last man to arrive
wrong the blind man arrived first
and then mr sinha
no im telling you there was already
a third man in the house
a third man what man
he resembled a builder i mean
a body builder
i could identify him
if i saw him again
body builder a third man
yes
ask simi
she over there
ask her make it sound casual
go on
that was papa favourite song
will you teach it to me
of course
a third man
last week you mean
the pizza delivery boy
he delivered the pizza
then a little later pramod arrived
actually mrs da is trying to help
she a fan of pramod
too many crank calls
the last caller was the limit
he said it was manohar sir
who dumped sinha body
on the bridge
what wrong easy
im fine thank you
people are just jealous of him
manu has many enemies
i read youve arrested a chap
called surya
he wont tell us where he hidden the
ten million sir will make him talk
sorry but may i say something
you shouldnt cross simi off
the list of suspects
after all why did she marry sinha
with such an age gap
a love marriage
sure he rich
but what about the rest
she must have a lover
mrs da was implying that
mrs da
pramod sinha neighbour
she insists a third man was present
she says she can identify him
get a sketch done
sinha murder is a high profile case
solve it and you will all get promoted

sir weve found simi sinha car
at suicide point
we found her bag
and a shoe near the car
looks like she jumped sir
we havent found a suicide note
we re searching the river
but it teeming with crocodiles
sir hello
simi sinha the widow of actor
pramod sinha has committed suicide
im standing on pune lndrayani bridge
where a bag and a shoe
were found near mrs sinha car
pramod sinha body was also discovered
nearby a few days ago
the police believe mrs sinha
jumped from this bridge
simi step-daughter daani
told the press
she last saw simi leave home
with the piano teacher akash
at this point akash whereabouts
are unknown
theyve eloped
simi sinha had ambitions of acting
and to achieve this she married
the much older actor sinha
after pramod sinha died simi dream
of setting the box-office on fire failed
this failure probably
drove simi to drown herself
pramod sinha murder has not been
solved and now
crying over your own death
he a doctor
hell take a blood test
if our blood group matches
hell use your cornea for the transplant

to bump into her
she wrinkles her eyes
in the bright sunlight
takes deep drags of life
as she walks along

she murdered two people
and blinded you
any court of law would give her
the death penalty
