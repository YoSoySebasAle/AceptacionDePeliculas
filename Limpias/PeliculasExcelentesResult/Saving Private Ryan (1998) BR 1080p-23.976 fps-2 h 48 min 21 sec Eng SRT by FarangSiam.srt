colonel ive got something
you should know about
yes
these two men died in normandy
this one at omaha beach
sean ryan
this man at utah
peter ryan
this man was killed
last week in new guinea
daniel ryan
the three men are brothers sir
ive just learned that this afternoon
their mother is going
to be getting all three telegrams
that not all there a
fourth brother the youngest
he parachuted in
with the 0st airborne
night before the invasion
he somewhere in normandy
we dont know where
is he alive
we dont know
come with me
«god damn it»
all four of them
were in the same company
in the 29th division
but we split them up
after the sullivan brothers died
on the juneau
any contact with the fourth son james
no sir he was dropped about
5 miles inland near neuville
but that still deep
behind german lines
now mac
there is no way you can know
where in the hell he was dropped
general first reports out of
ike people at shaef
said the 0st is scattered
all to hell and gone
there misdrops all over normandy
now assuming private ryan
even survived the jump
he could be anywhere
in fact he probably kia
and frankly sir we go sending
some sort of rescue mission
flathatting throughout swarms
of german reinforcements
all along our axis of advance
theyre gonna be kia too
i have a letter here
written a long time ago
to a mrs bixby in boston
so bear with me
dear madam
i have been shown in the files
of the war department
a statement of the adjutant
general of massachusetts
that you are the mother of five
sons who have died gloriously
on the field of battle
i feel how weak and fruitless
must be any words of mine
that would attempt
to beguile you from the grief
of a loss so overwhelming
but i cannot refrain
from tendering to you
the consolation that may be found
in the thanks of the republic
they died to save
i pray that our heavenly father
may assuage the anguish
of your bereavement
and leave you only the cherished
memory of the loved lost
and the solemn pride
that must be yours
to have laid so costly a sacrifice
upon the altar of freedom
yours very sincerely and respectfully
abraham lincoln
that boy is alive
we are gonna send somebody
to find him
and we are gonna get him
the hell out of there
«yes sir
yes sir»
«we expected 32 tanks
to float to the beach»
«twenty-seven didnt make it»
miller charlie company
go on in captain
i understand your situation
but if we dont offload
those duel-drive shermans by 0600
«were gonna have an entire division»
«stuck at carentan
with its pants around its ankles»
«well you let me know then»
«have charlie company hold at vierville
until we can get some armor up there»
«yes sir runner»
airborne was supposed to win
an open door for the rest of us
instead they misdropped scattered
all their sticks into the wind
what your situation
yes sir sector four is secure
we
we took out towed 88s
here here and here
theyd already gotten four
of our shermans
and a number
of our deuce and a halves
these two minefields
are actually one big one
we tried to make our way up
through the middle of it
but it turned into a mixed
high-density field
little bit of everything
spreng mine 44s schuh mine 42s
pot mines a-200s
the little wooden bastards
that the mine detectors dont pick up
this road here they placed
big mushrooms teller mine 43s
i guess for our tanks
from here right up
to the edge of the village right here
so we marked them
called the engineers
resistance
we had higher
support expectations sir
there was an under-strength
company without artillery
wehrmacht 346 infantry
von luck kampfgruppe
we ended up with 23 prisoners
we turned them over
to mps from the 29th
what about our casualties
well the figures
were 35 dead times two wounded
they just didnt wanna
give up those 88s
it was a tough assignment

show me
my men are beat
were gonna hold up here
for about three hours
well pull out after dark

like a three-star hotel
something with clean sheets
and soft pillows and room service
how about a nice comfy church
well take that
what have you heard
how it all falling together
well we got the beachhead secure
problem is monty taking
his time moving on caen
we cant pull out till he ready so
that guy overrated
no argument here
you gotta take caen
so you can take saint-lô
you got to take saint-lô
to take valognes
valognes you got cherbourg
cherbourg you got paris
paris you get berlin
and then that big boat home
we sure as hell
could use you around here
but i understand what youre doing
you do
yeah
i got a couple of brothers myself
good luck
thank you
no i mean it find him get him home
«what with your hand»
i dont know
it started in portsmouth
when they brought us
down for embarkation
it comes and goes
well you may have to get
yourself a new line of work
«this one doesnt seem
to agree with you anymore»
«what»
«what»
nothing
what was the name
of that kid at anzio
the one that was always walking
around on his hands you know
«and he was singing that song
about the man on the flying trapeze»
vecchio
vecchio
«yeah vecchio»
he was a goofy kid
remember he used to pee
a v on everybody jacket
for vecchio for victory
«he was so short
he was a midget wasnt he»
«how did you get to be a ranger»
«he got shot in the foot once didnt he
when he was walking on his hands»
«yeah he could walk faster on his hands»
«he could run faster on his hands than»
vecchio
yeah
caparzo
you see when you end up
killing one of your men
you tell yourself it happened
so you could save the lives
of two or three or 0 others
maybe 00 others
do you know how many men
ive lost under my command
«how many»
ninety-four
«but that means ive saved the lives
of 0 times that many doesnt it»
maybe even 20 right
twenty times as many
and that how simple it is
that how you
that how you rationalize
making the choice
«between the mission and the men»
except this time the mission is a man
this ryan better be worth it
hed better go home
cure some disease
or invent a longer-lasting
light bulb or something
cause the truth is
i wouldnt trade 0 ryans
for one vecchio or one caparzo
amen
look there it goes again
sir are you all right
now look were gonna
move out in two hours
why dont you get some sleep
«i dont know how he does it
what that»
falls asleep like that
i mean look at him
the guy lights out the minute
his head hits the pack
clear conscience
yeah what that saying
if god on our side
who the hell could be on theirs
if god be for us
who could be against us
«yeah what did i say»
«well actually the trick
to falling asleep is trying to stay awake»
«how is that wade»
«well when my mother was an intern
she used to work late through the night»
«sleep through the day»
so the only time that we ever got
to talk about anything
was when shed get home
so what i used to do
i used to lie in my bed
and try to stay awake
as long as i could
but it never worked
cause the harder i tried
the faster id fall asleep
«yeah well that wouldnt have
mattered none in my house»
my ma she wouldve come home
shook me awake
chatted me up till dawn
i swear that woman
was never too tired to talk
yeah that probably the only time
she could get a word in
funny thing is
sometimes shed come home early
and id pretend to be asleep
«who your mum»
yeah
shed stand in the doorway
looking at me
and id just keep my eyes shut
and i knew she just wanted
to find out about my day
that she came home early
just to talk to me
and i still wouldnt move
id still pretend to just be asleep
i dont know why i did that
we only got a couple of hours
shut up and go to sleep
«captain sir»
corporal

yeah i think this is
all good for me sir

calls into action the will
perfects the physical constitution
brings men into such swift
and close collision
in critical moments

of finding the bright side
you know emerson sir

the whole goddamn
airborne watching
these arent poker chips
«all right all right all right

he not here
maybe we should bust up
into a couple of different groups huh
and wander the woods
like hansel and gretel
calling his name
he bound to hear us sooner
or later ryan
that might be
a little hard to do captain
maybe the locals have seen him
hey you know
ryan anybody know ryan
0st airborne
ryan you know a guy named ryan
private james ryan from iowa
anybody know a ryan
james ryan

youre gonna have to speak up sir
youre gonna have to speak up sir
my hearing is not good
it comes and goes
it comes and goes
a german grenade went off
next to his ear
a grenade went off right by my head
got it got it
do you know private ryan
who
private ryan james ryan
jimmy ryan
james james francis ryan
no no no james francis ryan
all right get me a pencil
something to write on
something to write on
quick quick come on a pencil
a small one sir
write this down
james francis ryan question mark
iowa question mark
do you know him does he know him
read the message look
yeah of course i know him sir
does he know where he is
yeah yeah we missed
our drop zone by about 20 miles
ended up way over
by bumville or some damn place
him me and a couple of other guys
were coming here to the rally point
ran into a colonel who was gathering
up men to go to ramelle
ramelle
to baby-sit a bridge
that the last ive seen of him sir
great great thank you
write thank read and thank you
youre welcome
assemble on me
thank you lieutenant
ramelle
were here there
ramelle is on the merderet river
right here just to the southwest of us
you know anything about this bridge
he was talking about captain
yep the target has
always been cherbourg
we cant push on paris
until we take a deep water port
and rommel knows that
so he gonna try to get his armor
across the merderet river
anywhere he can
that way he can hit
our invasion forces in the flank
«when we make
the big right turn to cherbourg»
«that makes any village on that river»
«with an intact bridge
solid gold real estate»
let go
captain
«what the hell is that»
a radar site
it gotta be out of action
looks like we got something in that
sandbag bunker right under the station
see it
yeah that my guess too
what is it
machine gun probably mg42
jesus is that what got those guys
maybe one of them our boy
no their patches are 82nd
so your luck not that good
yeah well i dont know how fast
the rest of you betties are
but im thinking we detour
this way quick and quiet
the krauts will never
even know we were here
so captain what im trying to say is
why dont we just go around the thing
i hear what youre saying
but we cant go around it
im with reiben on this one sir
i mean we left them 88s
for the air force
the air force isnt gonna spend
ordnance on one machine gun
captain
we can still skip it
and accomplish our mission
«i mean this isnt our mission
right sir»
oh that what
you want to do mellish
you just want to leave it here
so they can ambush
the next company that comes along
no sir that not what im saying
im simply saying
it seems like an unnecessary risk
given our objective sir
our objective is to win the war
sir i just i dont have
a good feeling about this one
when was the last time
you felt good about anything
all right three runners
with suppressing fire
mellish you hook to the right
ill go up the middle

ill go left
all right
upham switch off with jackson
and you linger in the rear
«yes sir»
we advance and keep pressure on him
till he has to change out his barrels
i think we should be able
to hit him from grenade range
maybe i should go up the middle sir
the way you run i dont think so
maybe i should go left sir
maybe you should shut up
reiben base of fire
mags and clips where
you can reach them and
and extra grenades
for the base runners
«hill clear four down and dead»
«upham grab the gear get up here
we need water and extra dressing now»

yes sir howd you guess that
looks like you guys got hit pretty hard
yes sir small unit action
they came in
and beat the hell out of us with 88s
tell you what sir
if youre our relief
im gonna file a complaint
i wouldnt blame you
who your co
it would have been
captain jennings sir
im afraid the best we can muster up
right now is a corporal
so what are you guys all about
were here for him ryan
me sir
james francis ryan of iowa
yes sir
payton iowa that correct but
what is this about
your brothers were killed in combat
which ones
all of them
on the level
yeah im afraid so
you might want to take
some time with this
if there someplace
you want to go and
what this all about
ryan lost his brothers
which one
all of them
you
you came all the way
out here to tell me that
well youre going home
our orders are to bring you back
bring me back
corporal henderson i dont mean
to leave you even more shorthanded
but orders are orders
any communication about when
youre going to be relieved up here
sir there no way to tell i mean
we have no idea
what happening south of us
i have my orders too sir
they dont include me
abandoning my post
i understand that
but this changes things
i dont see that it does sir
the chief of staff
for the united states army says it does
sir our orders are to hold
this bridge at all cost
now our planes in the 82nd
have taken out every bridge
across the merderet
with the exception of two
one at valognes and this one here
we let the germans take them
were gonna lose our foothold
and have to displace
private your outfit wants to stay
that one thing
but your party over here
sir i cant leave
until at least reinforcements
you got three minutes
to gather your gear
sir what about them
i mean there barely hardly enough
hey asshole
two of our guys already died
trying to find you all right
sir
that right
what were their names
irwin wade and adrian caparzo
wade and
caparzo
it doesnt make any sense
it doesnt make sense sir
why why do i deserve to go
why not any of these guys
they all fought just as hard as me
is that what theyre
supposed to tell your mother
when they send her another
folded american flag
tell her that when you found me
i was here and i was
with the only brothers that i have left
and that there no way
i was gonna desert them
i think shell understand that
there no way im leaving this bridge
what are your orders
sergeant we have crossed
some strange boundary here
the world has taken a turn
for the surreal
clearly but the question still stands
i dont know what do you think
«you dont want to know what i think»
no mike i do
well part of me thinks the kid right
what he done to deserve this
he wants to stay here fine
let leave him and go home
yeah
but another part of me thinks
what if by some miracle we stay
and actually make it out of here
someday we might look back on this
and decide that
saving private ryan
was the one decent thing
we were able to pull out of this whole
god-awful shitty mess
that what i was thinking sir
like you said captain
we do that
we all earn the right to go home
oh brother
this is everything
you got the two 30-caliber machine
guns 7 grenades  hawkins mines
you got the two bazookas
but they only got eight rounds left
and assorted small arms
we had a 60 mortar
but an arty round took it out
might as well be spit wads
if they roll on us with tanks
which theyre sure to do
what are you thinking sir
well im thinking theyre going to try
to whip around the flanks
unless we can draw
them up this main road here
in between these buildings
where all the rubble makes
a bit of a bottleneck
disable em
if we can
make that tank a 60-ton roadblock
we do that we got
a fighting chance at their flanks
yes sir that good split them up
dont let them mass anywhere
hit them hard as we can one-on-one
and fall back to the bridge
machine gun on the move down here
and number two up high somewhere
to piss a little bad news down
on their heads
that would be the idea
jackson
if we can id like to get you up
in that bell tower
yes sir
give you a little company
if you need it
yes sir some company couldnt hurt
id say a30 with about
000 rounds would be okay
parker job opportunity
yeah well it not the worst idea
ever captain
it just that everything depends
on getting the tank
down this main road for us
to knock out right
so how the hell do you
plan on doing that
reiben right as our esteemed
colleague from the airborne pointed out
what we got here are
a bunch of spit wads
so how do we stop the tank
if we get it to commit
give it a rabbit to chase
we could hit the tank in the tracks
yeah but with what
well we could try a sticky bomb
sticky bomb sir
sir are you making that up
no it in the field manual
you check it out if you want to
we seem to be out of field manuals sir
perhaps you can enlighten us
all right you have
some demolition dont you
some tnt or some composition b
yeah that sir is the one thing
we got plenty of
i got that bridge wired with enough
composition b to blow it twice
all right you can spare some then
you take a standard-issue gi sock
cram it with as much
comp b as it can hold
rig up a simple fuse
then you coat the whole thing
with axle grease
that way when you throw it
it should stick
it a bomb that sticks
it a sticky bomb
you come up with a better way
to knock the tracks off a tank
im all ears
this is good
now we got to surrender our socks
haul away
all right select the field of fire
crossfire with the one
in the bell tower
all right i can cover
2 to nine from here
«easy
i got her»
here are the mines
for being the best we can do
that forward machine gun
is not in a terrible firing position
and this position right here
this is the alamo
they push us back this far
last man alive blows the bridge
we only got a 30-second delay
on that fuse
so let everyone know that
if you are that last man
you better hurry your ass off
or youre not going to be alive long
captain where am i during all this
never more than
two feet away from me
and that not negotiable
ill get some ammo come on
hey upham
yes
listen to me all right
yeah
youre listening
yes
all right were gonna be displacing
and falling back like crazy
sons of bitches
right up there
so you got to be johnny on the spot
with the ammo or were dead
right
you understand that
johnny on the spot
yeah
you all right
yeah yes
you know when we were
shipping out of england
the supply sergeant was handing
out cartons of cigarettes
and i said no thank you
i dont smoke
i dont smoke
quite a situation huh
unbelievable
here fucked up beyond
all recognition right
you got that right
<fubar>
ouch
yeah well
<fubar>
it going to be a real show huh
yeah okay
take it easy
<fubar>
«who that singing sir»
edith piaf
«what she so upset about»
her lover left her
but she still sees his face
everywhere she goes
that would do it
~nous nous aimions bien tendrement~
~comme saiment tous les amants~
~et puis un jour tu mas quittée~
~depuis je suis désespérée~
~je te vois partout dans le ciel~
~je te vois partout sur la terre~
~tu es ma joie et mon soleil~
even life itself only represents you
~ma nuit mes jours~
<font color=#ff00ff>~mes aubes claires~
sometimes i dream that im in your arms
what was that part
she sang that before
the chorus it the chorus
the chorus
<font color=#ff00ff>~tu es partout car tu es dans mon cœur~
and you speak softly in my ear
~tu es partout car tu es mon bonheur~
~toutes les choses~
and you say things
<font color=#ff00ff>~qui sont autour de moi~
that make my eyes close
~même la vie ne représente que toi~
and i find that marvelous
again upham
«yes»
to be honest with you
i find myself curiously aroused by you
marvelous
no it really a melancholy song
at the beginning of the song she says
and then one day you left
you left me and ive been
desperate ever since
i see you all over the sky
i see you all over the earth
jesus upham
any more songs like this
the krauts arent going
to have to shoot me
im just going to slit my own wrists
you know
youre a strange bird upham
sorry it edith you know
you know what
that song reminds me of
it reminds me of mrs rachel troubowitz
and what she said to me
the day i left for basic
what dont touch me
no mrs rachel troubowitz
is our super wife
she comes into my mom shop
to try on a few things all right
and she easily like a 44 double e
double e
these things are massive
those are big
no and ive got her convinced
that she like a 42 d all right
so were in the dressing room
she trying to squeeze
into this side-cut
silk-ribboned triple-panel girdle
with the shelf-lift brassiere
and it beautiful cause she just
pouring out of this thing you know
is it really tight
no no it beautiful
and she sees me and she can tell
i got a hard-on the size
of the statue of liberty all right
and she says to me
richard calm down
and she says when youre over there
if you see anything that upsets you
or if youre ever scared
i want you to close your eyes
and think of these you understand
so i said yes maam
«are you all right sir»
yeah im just keeping the rhythm
«is it true you were
a teacher back home»
yes
see that something i could never do
you know
not after the way me and my brothers
treated our teachers no sir
i had 000 kids like you
i cant see my brothers faces
ive been trying
and i cant see their faces at all
has that ever happened to you
you gotta think of a context
what does that mean
well you dont just think
about their faces
you think about something specific
something youve done together
well when i think of home
i think of something specific
i think of my hammock in the backyard
or my wife pruning the rose bushes
in a pair of my old work gloves
this one night two of my brothers came
and woke me up in
the middle of the night
and they said
they had a surprise for me
so they took me to the barn
up into the loft
and there was my oldest brother dan
with alice alice jardine
i mean picture a girl who just took
a nosedive from the ugly tree
and hit every branch coming down
and dan got her shirt off
so he working on this bra
and he trying to get it off
and all of a sudden
sean just screams out
danny youre a young man
dont do it
and so alice jardine hears this
and she screams and she jumps up
and she tries to get
running out of the barn
but she still got this shirt
over her head
she goes running right into the wall
and knocks herself out
so now dan is just so mad at us
he starts coming after us
but at the same time
alice is over there unconscious
he got to wake her up
so he grabs her by a leg
and he dragging her
at the same time he picks up a shovel
and he going after sean
and sean said
what are you trying to hit me for
i just did you a favor
and so this makes dan more angry
he tries to swing this thing
he loses the shovel
it goes out of his grasp
and hits a kerosene lantern
the thing explodes
the whole barn almost goes up
because of this thing
that was it that was the last
that was
dan went off to basic next day
that was the last night
the four of us were together
that was two years ago
