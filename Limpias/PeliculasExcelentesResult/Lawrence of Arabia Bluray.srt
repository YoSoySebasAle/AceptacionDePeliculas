
he was the most extraordinary man
i ever knew
did you know him well
i knew him
well nil nisi bonum
but did he really deserve
a place in here
lord allenby could you give
a few words about lawrence
what more words
the revolt in the desert
played a decisive part
in the middle eastern campaign
yes sir but about
colonel lawrence himself
no no i didnt know him well
you know
mr bentley you know as much
about lawrence as anybody
yes it was my privilege to know him
and to make him known to the world
he was a poet a scholar
and a mighty warrior
thank you
he was also the most shameless
exhibitionist since barnum and bailey
you sir who are you
my name is jackson bentley
i overheard your last remark
and take the gravest exception
-he was a great man
-did you know him
no i cant claim to have known him
i had the honor to shake his hand
in damascus
knew him i never knew him
he had some minor function
on my staff in cairo
michael george hartley
this is a nasty dark little room
that right
we are not happy in it
i am it better than
a nasty dark little trench
-then youre a big noble fellow
-that right
here is william potter
with my newspaper
-here you are tosh
-thanks
would you care for one of
corporal hartley cigarettes
-is it there
-of course
headlines
but i bet it isnt mentioned
in the times
bedouin tribes attack
turkish stronghold
i bet that no one in this
headquarters even knows it happened
or would care if it did
allow me to ignite your cigarette
-mr lawrence
-yes
-flimsy sir
-thank you
youll do that once too often
it only flesh and blood
michael george hartley
youre a philosopher
and youre balmy
-it damn well hurts
-certainly it hurts
what the trick then
the trick william potter
is not minding that it hurts
by the way if captain gibbon
should enquire for me
tell him ive gone
for a chat with the general
-he balmy
-he all right
lawrence
yes
youre supposed to be
do you usually wear your cap
in the mess
always
you should be on duty
where are you going
mustnt talk shop
freddie not in the mess
im going for a powwow
with the general
im not asking as your superior
but as the secretary of this mess
we dont want chaps in here
who should be on duty
where are you going
i must say lawrence
-sorry
-youre a clown lawrence
ah well we cant all be lion tamers
sorry
it an intrigue dryden
i do not propose to let
an overweening crass lieutenant
thumb his nose at his commander
and get away with it
it doesnt sound as though
hed be any great loss sir
dont try that dryden
there a principle involved
there is indeed
he of no use here in cairo
he might be in arabia
he knows his stuff sir
knows the books you mean
ive already sent out
colonel brighton who a soldier
if brighton thinks we should send
some arms we will
well what more do you want
that there would be no question
of lieutenant lawrence
giving military advice
by god i should hope not
it just that the arab bureau would
like its own man on the spot to
to what
to make our own appraisal
of the situation
ill tell you it my considered
opinion and that of my staff
that time spent on the bedouin
will be time wasted
theyre a nation of sheep-stealers
they did attack medina
and the turks made mincemeat
of them
we dont know that
we know that they didnt take it
a storm in a teacup a sideshow
in my opinion this whole theatre
of operations is a sideshow
the real war being fought against
germans not turks
not here but on
the western front in the trenches
your bedouin army
or whatever it calls itself
would be a sideshow of a sideshow
big things have small beginnings sir
does the arab bureau
want a big thing in arabia
does the bureau think theyll sit down
under us when this war is over
the bureau thinks the job of
the moment sir is to win the war
dont tell me my duty mr dryden
-lawrence sir
-send him in
good morning sir
salute
if youre insubordinate
i shall put you under arrest
-it my manner
-your what
my manner it looks insubordinate
but it isnt
i cant make out whether youre
bad-mannered or just half-witted
-i have the same problem sir
-shut up
the arab bureau thinks you
would be of use to them in arabia
why i cant imagine
you cant perform
your present duties properly
l cannot fiddle but i can make
a great state from a little city
-what
-themistocles sir
-a greek philosopher
-i know youve been well-educated
it says so in your dossier
youre the kind of creature
i cant stand lawrence
but i suppose i could be wrong
all right dryden
you can have him for six weeks
who knows it might even
make a man of him come in
yes what is it
the convoy will be in
port said tomorrow night
-is that certain
-yes sir
there doesnt seem to be
any artillery
but there must be artillery
sir this is something
of an expedition
he has to get to yenbo find a guide
find the arabs and then get back
he cant do that in six weeks
-two months then
-three
all right three now will you
let me do some work mr dryden
thank you sir
id like to say sir
that i am grateful for this
shut up and get out
sir
how can i fight a bloody war
without bloody artillery
-how did you do it
-might better ask why i bothered to
-because im the man for the job
-i just wonder about that
of course i am
what is the job by the way
find prince feisal
good and when ive found him
find out what kind of a man he is
find out what his intentions are
not his immediate intentions
that is colonel brighton business
not yours
i mean his intentions
in arabia altogether
that new
where are they now
anywhere within 300 miles of medina
theyre hashemite bedouins
they can cross 60 miles of desert
in a day
thanks this is going to be fun
lawrence only two kinds of creature
get fun in the desert
bedouins and gods
and youre neither take it from me
for ordinary men
it a burning fiery furnace
no dryden it going to be fun
it is recognized that you have
a funny sense of fun
here you may drink
one cup
you do not drink
no
ill drink when you do
i am bedu
truly now you are a british officer
yes

the hazimi may not drink
at our wells
he knew that
salaam
sherif ali
so long as the arabs fight
tribe against tribe
so long will they be
a little people
a silly people
greedy barbarous and cruel
as you are
come
i will take you to feisal
i do not want your company sherif
wadi safra is another day from here

of feisal that he doesnt know
ill give him that no escort
my guide was killed
at the masturah well
-turks
-no an arab
bloody savages
-this is wadi safra isnt it
-yes theyre over there
just a minute
what your name and who sent you
lawrence ive been seconded
to the arab bureau
what are you to do
for the arab bureau
well it rather vague sir
im to appreciate the situation
well that wont be difficult
the situation bloody awful
their morale if they ever had any
which i doubt
the turks knocked out of them
in front of medina with howitzers
theyre fading away by dozens
every night
what i want to say is this
wherever you are
and whoever you are with
youre a british officer
here an order
when we get into that camp
youre to keep your mouth shut
-do you understand what im saying
-i understand what youre saying
youll make your appreciation
and get back to--
oh my god
not again
ive told him
god knows ive told him
move south ive said
youre still in range
they simply will not understand
what modern weapons do
stand and fight stand and fight
fire back at them
-who are you
-lieutenant lawrence sir
seconded to the arab bureau
this is a bloody mess sir
well have to move south
yes colonel 50 miles south
you were right and i was wrong
we must take some thought
for the wounded
-we can take care of them at yenbo
-if they can get to yenbo
they can hardly come with us
no they must try to reach yenbo
lieutenant
lawrence
you understand
lieutenant lawrence
my people are unused to
explosives and machines
first the guns and now this
cigarette
im sorry
cigarette your excellency
umph off
please your excellency
just one for two
hold it jenkins
jenkins
lawrence
you have no servant
-i dont need a servant
-no
we can do everything light fires
cook food wash clothes
-yes everything
-i dont doubt it
-it will be very nice for you
-i cant afford it
recite then as much of the koran
as may be easy to you
god knoweth that there be
some among you sick
while others travel through the
earth in quest for the bounties of god
others do battle in his cause
recite therefore
as much as may be easy
and observe the prayers
this will be best and richest
in the recompense
seek ye the forgiveness of god
verily god is forgiving merciful--
greetings ali
-my lord
-sherif ali
lieutenant lawrence you have met
sherif ali i think
yes my lord
and now selim the brightness
by the noonday brightness
and by the night
when it darkeneth
thy lord hath not forsaken thee
neither hath he been displeased
and surely the future shall be better
for thee than the past
and in the end shall your lord be
bounteous to thee
and thou be satisfied
so
yes colonel
-i want a decision sir
-you want me to fall back on yenbo
well youre not doing
much good here sir
im sorry to rub it in sir
but we cant supply you here
you could supply us through aqaba
aqaba
if you can get ahold of aqaba
we can supply you
-but you cant
-you could
you mean the navy
the turks have  2-inch guns
at aqaba sir
can you imagine what that means
yes i can imagine
put that out of your mind sir
the navy got other things to do
oh yes protecting the suez canal
the one essential sector of this front
is and must be the canal
you can see that sir surely
i see that the canal is
an essential british interest
it is of little consequence to us
i must ask you not to speak like that
british and arab interests are
one and the same
possibly
upon my word sir youre ungrateful
fall back on yenbo and we will
give you equipment
give you arms advice
training everything
-guns
-a modern rifle for every man
no guns artillery
guns like the turkish guns at medina
yes give us guns
and keep the training
your men need training
far more than guns sir
english will teach
bedu to fight
we will teach them sherif ali
to fight a modern mechanized army
yes lieutenant
what do you think about yenbo
i think it is far from damascus
well have you in damascus sir
never fear
have you been in damascus
mr lawrence
yes my lord
it is beautiful is it not
-very
-that will do lawrence
dreaming wont get you to damascus
but discipline will
look great britain is a small
country much smaller than yours
small population compared with some
it small but it great and why
-because it has guns
-because it has discipline
because it has a navy
because of this
the english go
where they please
and strike where they please
this makes them great
-right
-mr lawrence that will do
lawrence is not your military adviser
but i would like to hear his opinion
damn it
who do you take your orders from
from lord feisal in feisal tent
old fool why turn from him to him
they are master and man
my lord i think
i think your book is right
the desert is an ocean
in which no oar is dipped
on this ocean the bedu go
where they please
and strike where they please
this is the way the bedu has
always fought
youre famed through the world
for fighting this way
and this is the way you should
fight now
i dont know
im sorry sir but youre wrong
fall back on yenbo the arab rising
becomes one unit in the british army
-what is this to you
-youre a traitor
no colonel
he is a young man
and young men are passionate
they must say their say
but wiser people must decide
i know you are right
very well when shall we move
the sooner the better
youll lose another 50 men tonight
you tread heavily
but you speak the truth
i will give you my answer tomorrow
and now
it is late
colonel brighton means
to put my men
under european officers
does he not
in effect my lord yes
and i must do it
because the turks have
european guns
but i fear to do it
upon my soul i do
the english have a great hunger for
desolate places
i fear they hunger for arabia
then you must deny it to them
you are an englishman
are you not loyal to england
to england and to other things
to england and arabia both
and is that possible
i think you are another of these
dessert-loving english
doughty stanhope
gordon of khartoum
no arab ioves the desert
we love water and green trees
there is nothing in the desert
and no man needs nothing
or is it that you think we are
something you can play with
because we are a little people
a silly people
greedy barbarous and cruel
or do you know lieutenant
in the arab city of cordoba
were two miles of lighting
in the streets
when london was a village
yes you were great
nine centuries ago
time to be great again my lord
which is why my father made this war
upon the turks
my father mr lawrence
not the english
but my father is old
and i
i long for the vanished
gardens of cordoba
however before the gardens
must come the fighting
to be great again it seems that we
need the english
or
or
what no man can provide
mr lawrence
we need a miracle
aqaba
aqaba
from the land
you are mad
to come to aqaba by land we should
have to cross the nefud desert
that right
the nefud cannot be crossed
ill cross it if you will
you it takes more than a compass
englishman
the nefud is the worst place
god created
i cant answer for the place
only for myself
fifty men
fifty against aqaba
if 50 men came out of the nefud
they would be 50 men
other men might join
the howeitat are there i hear
the howeitat are brigands
theyll sell themselves to anyone
-good fighters though
-good--
yes there are guns at aqaba
they face the sea sherif ali
and cannot be turned around
from the landward side
there are no guns at aqaba
with good reason it cannot be
approached from the landward side
certainly the turks dont dream of it
aqaba over there
it only a matter of going
you are mad
and where are you going lieutenant
with 50 of my men
to work your miracle
blasphemy is a bad beginning
for such a journey
-who told you
-ali did
why not you
you are falling back from yenbo sir
yes i must
but i will spare these to you
did ali break confidence to tell me
sherif ali owes you his allegiance
my lord
yet you did not tell
colonel brighton
no
since you do know
we can claim to arrive
in the name of feisal of mecca
yes lieutenant lawrence
you may claim it
but in whose name do you ride
sherif i caught them
they have tracked us
they were here i caught them
why are you here boy
to serve lord lawrence sherif
this is true lawrence
they do wish it
you have been tracking us
-you were told to stay
-no sherif
our camel strayed we followed her
she led us here to be
lord lawrence servants
-it is the will of allah
-blasphemy
dont do that
no lawrence these are not servants
these are outcasts parent-less
be warned they are not suitable
they sound very suitable
you can ride with the baggage
these are not servants
these are worshippers
one shilling every week
that is fair
-each
-no
-that is too much
-all right
they will be lucky for you
allah favors the compassionate
there is the railway
and that is the desert
from here until the other side
no water but what we carry
for the camels no water at all
if the camels die
we die
and in 20 days they will start to die
there no time to waste then
is there
i was thinking
you were drifting
yes it will not happen again
be warned you were drifting
it will not happen again
that water is wasted
from now on
we must travel by night
and rest while it is
too hot to travel
a few hours each day
why dont we start now
no we will rest now
three hours
fine
ill wake you
do we rest here
there is no rest now short of water
the other side of that
and how much of that is there
im not sure
but however much it must be crossed
before tomorrow sun gets up
this is the sun anvil
have we done it
no but were off the anvil
thank god for that anyway
yes thank him
lawrence i do not think you know
how you have tempted him
i know
weve done it
god willing
when do we reach the wells
god willing midday
-then weve done it
-thank him lawrence thank him
gasim

the auda id heard of wouldnt need to
summon help to look after his wells
he must be a great hero

one of his own bastards
no there is no resemblance
alas you resemble your father
-auda flatters me
-you are easily flattered
i knew your father well
did you know your own
we are 50 you are two
how if we shot you down
why then you have a blood feud
with the howeitat
-do you desire it
-not the generals in cairo
nor the sultan himself desire that
call off your men
this honors the unworthy
ive only just begun to teach him
and what are you teaching him today
howeitat hospitality
be not clever with me english
-who is he
-a friend of prince feisal
-so you desire my hospitality
-yes

turks to buy you friends of feisal
but
dine with me
dine with auda english
dine with the howeitat harith
it is my pleasure that you dine
with me in wadi rumm
this thing you work against aqaba
what profit do you hope from it
we work it for feisal of mecca
the harith do not work for profit
well if it is in a man to be
a servant sherif ali
he could find worse masters
than feisal
but i
i cannot serve
you permit the turks to stay in aqaba

we do not work this thing for feisal
no

beni sahkr these i know
i have even heard of the harith
but the arabs
what tribe is that
theyre a tribe of slaves

well they are nothing to me
my tribe is the howeitat
who work only for profit
who work at auda pleasure
and auda pleasure is
to serve the turks
serve
i serve
it is the servant who takes money
i am auda abu tayi

all got in battle
75 men have i killed with
my own hands in battle
i scatter i burn my enemies tents
i take away their flocks and herds
the turks pay me a golden treasure
yet i am poor
because i am a river to my people
is that service
no
and yet now it seems auda
has grown old
and lost his taste for fighting
it is well you say it in my tent
thou old tulip

that the turks could not buy
why should they wish to
now
i will tell you what they pay me

friends weve been foolish
auda will not come to aqaba
-for money

blessed thing i can

congratulations
thank you for your hospitality
gentlemen
congratulations

artillery sir
i was wondering that sir
might be difficult to get it back
give them artillery and youve made
them independent
then i cant give it to them can l
-for you to say
-no it not
ive got orders to obey thank god
not like that poor devil
he riding the whirlwind
let hope were not
excuse me friend
who do these bags belong to
to prince feisal
-youre not prince feisdal
-no
you know him though
he is my master i am his servant
can you read
chicago courier is my paper
but my work is syndicated in america
i understood so from your letter
mr bentley
now
-where can i find major lawrence
-is that what you have come for
not altogether sir no
well mr bentley you will find
major lawrence with my army
that what i meant sir
where can i find your army
i dont know
-last week they were near el ghira
-ghira
yes i fear you have a long journey
can you ride a camel
-ive never tried
-take a mule
avoid mellaha the turks are there
in mellaha now they move fast
they do
but not so fast as we do
you will find
myself
i am going to cairo
-as you know
-yes
there work for me there
of a different kind
yes
i understand youve
been given no artillery
-that is so
-youre handicapped
it restricts us to small things
it intended to
do you know general allenby
watch out for allenby
he a slim customer
-excuse me
-a clever man
slim customer it very good
ill certainly watch out for him
youre being very sympathetic
your highness we americans were
once a colonial people
we naturally feel
sympathetic to any people
who struggle for their freedom
very gratifying
also my interests are the same
as yours you want your story told
i badly want a story to tell
ah now you are talking turkey
are you not
i will give you a guide and a letter
and before i leave here
which must be presently
i will have some facts and figures
put on paper for you
you know that we are
destroying the turkish railways
i do sir
major lawrence is in charge
of all this is he
my army is made up of tribes
the tribes are led
by the tribal leaders
your people do think very highly
of major lawrence
oh yes and the rightly
in this country mr bentley
the man who gives victory
in battle is prized
beyond every other man
one figure i can give you
from my head
because it never leaves my head
since starting this campaign
four months ago we have lost
37 wounded
56 dead
you remark the disproportion between
our dead and wounded
yeah
four times as many
that because those too wounded
to bring away we ourselves kill
we leave no wounded for the turks
-you mean
-we leave no wounded for the turks
in their eyes we are not
soldiers but rebels
rebels wounded or whole are
not protected by the geneva code
and are treated harshly
how harshly
more harshly than i hope
you can imagine
i see
our own prisoners are taken care of
until the british
can relieve us of them
according to the code
-i should like you to notice that
-yes sir
is that the influence
of major lawrence
why should you suppose
it just that i heard
in cairo that
major lawrence has
a horror of bloodshed
that is exactly so
with major lawrence
mercy is a passion
with me it is merely good manners
you may judge which motive
is the more reliable
-and now perhaps
-oh sure sure
thank you sir
can you manage the letter--
ill do everything i have said
if you will tell me truly
the nature of your interest
in my people and major lawrence
it very simple sir
im looking for a hero
indeed
you do not seem a romantic man
oh no
but influential men back home believe
it time for america
to lend her weight to
the struggle against germany
and turkey
ive been sent to find material to
show our people that this war is
-enjoyable
-hardly that sir
but to show it in its
more adventurous aspects
you look for a figure who
will draw your country towards war
all right yes
lawrence is your man
stop
stop it
stop it
come on men
lawrence
good god god
jiminy never seen a man killed
with a sword before
why dont you take a picture
wish i had
how is it with thee lawrence
am i in this
did you take his picture
yeah
you are using up your nine lives
very quickly
charming company you keep
auda
he a bit old-fashioned he thinks
these things will steal his virtue
he thinks youre a kind of thief
it all right to take your picture
-all right
-okay
just walk
major lawrence
yes sir that my baby
this looting has got to stop
it is customary
it theft and theft makes thieves
i would not say that to auda
-it is their payment colonel
-payment
truly are not british soldiers paid
-they dont go home when being paid
-they are not free to
well there another lot youve
seen the last of
theyll come back
he says theyll come back
will they
not this year lawrence
look lawrence how many men do
you think youll have left 200
-less
-well then
i said theyll come back
you badly hurt
not hurt at all
didnt you know they can only
kill me with a golden bullet
it is for children
i have set myself to learn again
-what are you learning from this
-politics
youll be a democracy in this country
you gonna have a parliament
i will tell you that
when i have a country
did i answer well
you answered without
saying anything that politics
you learn quickly
i have a good teacher
yeah
-how your hurt
-fine
before i return to the fleshpots
which i shall be very glad to do
may i put two questions to you
straight
id be interested to hear you put
a question straight
one
what in your opinion do these people
hope to gain from this war
they hope to gain their freedom
freedom
they hope to gain their freedom
-there one born every minute
-theyre going to get it
im going to give it to them
-the second question
-well i was going to ask
what is it that attracts you
personally to the desert
it clean
well now
that a very illuminating answer
may i
take one farewell picture
i gave math budad two lamps for it
one clock for two lamps
a fair bargain
fair i robbed him
trash
i must find something honorable
honorable
the year is running out brighton
i must find something honorable
now you may blow up my train
and what will you do now
now i go home
they will carry my toys
they will carry my toys too see
major lawrence will campaign
this winter
but you got what you wanted
so youre going home is that it
of course when lawrence has got
what he wanted he will go home
when youve got what you want
you will go home
no i shant auda
then you are a fool
maybe but i am not a deserter
give thanks to god brighton
that when he made you a fool
he gave you a fool face
you are an impudent rascal
i must go lawrence before i
soil myself with a fool blood
like talking to a brick wall
so what will you do now
what can you do
ill go north
that what allenby wants
allenby wanted the arab army
behind deraa
then that where ill take it
tell allenby to hurry up or well be
in deraa before he in jerusalem
wont we
train farraj
yeah lawrence
hide yourself my friend
detonator
all right fetch another
-pardon lawrence i put--
-plenty of time fetch another
farraj
-what happened
-detonator a detonator
he cannot ride lawrence look
if they take him alive
you know what theyll do to him
daud will be angry with you
salute him for me
what will you do now
go north
with twenty
what would
you recommend me to do
what would you recommend
he hasnt  / 0 so many men sir
he lied in fact
yes and no he doesnt claim to have
done anything he hasnt done
then there is an arab north army
-no sir he has lied about that
-any idea why
-it his army i supposed
-it prince feisdal army
do you think he gone native harry
no
he would if he could i think
-not my line of country
-it doesnt matter just curious
what matters is i believed it
the turks believe it
they are offering 20000 pounds
for him
good heavens
-shouldnt say he had long to live
-whatever else he a brave man--
surely surely if he still going north
with 50 men he doesnt lack guts
i wonder if theyd offer that much
for me
what about next year
will they still come back
i wouldnt be surprised
-they think he a kind of prophet
-they do or he does
-now may i speak
-yes
one more failure and you will find
yourself alone
-i do not include myself
-i do not include the others
so say they love you
the more reason to be thrifty
with them
give them something to do
that can be done but you no
they must move mountains
walk on water
that right that right
who are you to know
what can be done
if wed done what you thought could
be done wed be in yenbo now
whatever i ask them to do can
be done they know that if you dont
do you think im just anybody
do you
my friends who will walk on water
with me
-who will come with me into deraa
-deraa is garrisoned
will you take 20 against 2000
-ill go by myself if i have to
-why
because i told the english generals
the arab revolt would be in deraa
when theyd be in jerusalem
or perhaps you are here
for the english generals
who says this
rumor
that is not an argument
oh argument
this afternoon i will take
the arab revolt into deraa
while the arabs argue
can you pass for an arab
in an arab town
yes if one of you would lend me
some dirty clothes
it madness
what are you looking for
some way to announce myself
be patient with him god
-do you not see how they look at you
-peace ali i am invisible

i am surrounded by cattle
he wouldnt know an interesting face
from a sow belly
i have been is deraa now
for three and a half years
if they posted me to the dark side
of the moon i could not be more
isolated
you havent the least idea
what im talking about
no effendi

no
that would be too
iucky
where did you get that
-it old effendi
-no this is recent
-you are a deserter
-no effendi
yes you are a deserter
but from which army

a man cannot be always in uniform
your skin is very fair
beat him
to me
sleep

i suppose
and the end of the arab revolt
im not the arab revolt aii
im not even arab
a man can be whatever he wanted
you said
im sorry i thought it was true
you proved it
look ali look
that me what color is it
that me
and there nothing i can do about it
a man can do whatever he wanted
you said
he can
but he cant want what he wanted
this is the stuff that decides what
he wants
you may as well know
i wouldve told them anything
i wouldve told them who i am
i wouldve told them where you were
-i tried to
-so would any man
well any man is what i am
and im going back to allenby to
ask him for a job
that any man can do
allenby in jerusalem
-ill make easy stages
-you
oh yes easy stages
look ali i think i see
a way of being just
ordinarily
happy
can i take this
it is not clean
no but it warm
and these
having led them here
have you no care for them
you lead them theyre yours
trust your own people
and let me go back to mine
-i say dont forget those form fives
-all right
mind if i join you
honored sir
-good to be back
-we heard you were sir
-what doing out there
-where
-arabia
-well yes sir
nothing much wrong time of year
what doing here
were settling in
we built a squash court
jolly good
well i have to go up there
it borrowed someone pinched mine
bloody wogs
yes probably
jolly good about the squash court
lays it on a bit thick doesnt he
morning
-good morning sir
-good to be back
-ill believe you sir
-no really it is
hello
morning youre to go right in
lawrence
or is it major lawrence
sir
well general i will leave you
major lawrence doubtless
has reports to make
about my people
and their weakness
and the need to keep them
in the british interest
and the french interest too
we must not forget the french
i told you sir no such treaty exists
yes general you have lied
most bravely but not convincingly
i know this treaty does exist
treaty sir
he does it better than you general
but then of course
he is almost an arab
you really dont know
then what the devil this
it my request
for release from arabia sir
for what reason
you sure you havent heard
of the sykes-picot treaty
no
-i can guess
-dont guess tell him
well now
mr sykes is an english civil servant
monsieur picot is
a french civil servant
mr sykes and monsieur picot met
and they agreed that after the war
france and england should
share the turkish empire
including arabia
they signed an agreement
not a treaty sir
an agreement to that effect
there may be honor among thieves
but there none in politicians
and let have
no displays of indignation
you may not have known
but you certainly had suspicions
if weve told lies
youve told half-lies
and a man who tells lies like me
merely hides the truth
but a man who tells half-lies
has forgotten where he put it
the truth is im an ordinary man
you might have told me that dryden
and i want an ordinary job sir
that my reason for resigning
it personal
-personal
-yes sir
personal
youre a serving officer in the field
and as it happens a damned
important one are you mad
no and if you dont mind
id rather not go mad
that my reason too
look im making my big push
on damascus the  6th of next month
and you are part of it
can you understand that youre
an important part of the big push
i dont want to be part
of your big push
what about your arab friends
i have no arab friends
i dont want arab friends
what in hell do you want lawrence
ive told you i just want
my ration of common humanity
-lawrence
-yes
nothing sorry i interrupted sir
that all right
thank you mr dryden
thank you sir
why dont we
there blood on your back
-do you want a doctor
-no
tell me what happened
say what goes on in there
-nothing
-oh come on
-no really nothing at all
-is the man in trouble
i expect so we all have troubles
life a vale of troubles
let me know if the man in trouble
ive got a claim in that man
-what claim
-ive made that boy a hero
when the war over
he can be anything he wants

the whole town is plastered
with the arab flag
-when
-a day and a night sir
theyve been here a day and a night
theyve occupied the town
theyve done it
he set up his own headquarters
in the town hall
what else beside the town hall
telephone exchange
post office powerhouse
hospitals fire station
everything sir
they call themselves
the arab national council
and theyre in the town hall
well theyre your pigeon harry

by special train in two days time
two days
two days is what you asked for

-we cant just do nothing
why not it usually best
get us something to drink tracey
and tracey all troops to remain
quartered until further orders
does that apply to technical units
technical units particularly
yes sir
medicals too sir
im afraid so harry
medicals too
we here
are neither harith nor howeitat
nor any other tribe but arabs
of the arab council
acting for prince feisal
he insulted me
sherif ali said that the telephones
are in the care of the howeitat
and they have ceased to work
and this is true
they will not work because
they are given no electricity
the electricity is
in the care of the harith
if you answer
there will be bloodshed
you speak to me of bloodshed
i ask pardon of auda abu tayi
humbly
humbly harith
yes humbly
this is a new trick
why is there no electricity
i have been to that
electrical house lawrence
there are three large machines
he means generators
so
one of them is burning
they are of an incredible size
but helpless
it is so of all machines
let them burn
what need of telephones
-the need is absolute
-then we need english engineers
no take english engineers
and you take english government
take--
fire has broken out
-where
-the jinsibi district
-it is not a district that matters
-it will spread
then use the fire brigade
we have tried
but there is no force in the water
then you must carry it
-the ruala do not carry water
-what else are they good for
we will hear petitions this afternoon
this afternoon
-ill take this up after the war
-surely we should do something sir
-it an old man sport
-are you an old man sir
all i can say is sir
it a heavy responsibility
sorry sir
maybe it the bulb
no sir
it the power
theyre leaving
that it then
marvelous-looking beggars
arent they
leave it lawrence come with me
-come where
-back
i know your heart
what is it
is it this
i tell you this is nothing
is it the blood
the desert has dried up more blood
than you could think of
i pray that i may never
see the desert again
hear me god
you will come
there is only the desert for you
what about you
no i shall stay here
and learn politics
a very low occupation
i had not thought of it
when i met you
you have tried very hard
to give us damascus
it what i came for
and then
it would be something
yes
much
-he is your friend
-take your hand away
-you love him
-i fear him
then why do you weep
if i fear him who love him
how must he fear himself
who hates himself
take your hand away howeitat
so you are not yet entirely politician
not yet
well these are new tricks
and i am an old dog
and allah be thanked
iil tell thee what
being an arab will be thornier
than you suppose harith
in all my years
ive never seen anything like it
it comes within the jurisdiction
of the arab council
under the circumstances i think
i must take over immediately
under any circumstances at all
you must obey your orders
no sir i will not
control yourself
now go over to the town hall
and see what they say
we did what we could
in the civic hospitals
but you forgot
the turkish military hospital
it has 600 beds there are
about 2000 turkish wounded in it
all of whom are the responsibility
of your precious arab council
what it like
this is outrageous
outrageous
outrageous
you filthy little wog
my friend lawrence
if i may call him that
my friend lawrence
how many men will claim the right
to use that phrase how proudly
he longs for the greenness
of his native land
he pines for the gothic cottages
of surrey is it not
already in imagination
he catches trout
and all the activities
of the english gentleman
that me youre describing sir
not colonel lawrence
youre promoted colonel
yes what for
take the honor colonel
be a iittle kind
as a colonel youll have a cabin
to yourself on the boat home
then thank you
well then
godspeed
there nothing further here
for a warrior
we drive bargains old men work
young men make wars
and the virtues of war
are the virtues of young men
courage and hope for the future
then old men make the peace
and the vices of peace
are the vices of old men
mistrust and caution
it must be so
what i owe you is beyond evaluation
the powerhouse the telephone
exchange these i concede
the pumping plant i must retain
if you retain it
there will be no water
-i shall be glad of assistance
-then you must bring down your flag
i shall not and if your men
attempt it my men will resist it
-have you men
-enough for that
it a thing that
makes an ugly incident
im sure your government
does not wish to appear at the peace
conference as an aggressor
i say
it lawrence isnt it
may i shake your hand sir
just want to be able
to say id done it sir
havent we met before
dont think so sir
no no sir i should remember that
it is widely known the arab council
took power in my name
they have no power it illusory
illusions can be very powerful
particularly
when they take this form
the world is delighted
at the picture of damascus
iiberated by the arab army
led may i remind you
by a british-serving officer
ah yes but then lawrence
is a sword with two edges
we are equally glad
to be rid of him are we not
i thought i was a hard man sir
you are merely a general
i must be a king
excuse me sir
well
well
it seems were to have
a british waterworks
with an arab flag on it
do you think it was worth it
not my business
thank god im a soldier
yes sir
so you keep saying
you i suspect
are chief architect
of this compromise
-what do you think
-me your highness
on the whole i wish
id stayed in tunbridge wells
well sir going home
home sir
