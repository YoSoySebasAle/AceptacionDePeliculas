randall patrick mcmurphy
thirty-eight years old
what can you tell me about
why youve been sent over here
well
i dont know
what it say there
mind if i smoke
no go right ahead
well it
says several things here
it said youve been belligerent
talked when unauthorized
youve been resentful in attitude
towards work in general that youre lazy
chewing gum in class
the real reason
that youve been sent here
is because they wanted you
to be evaluated
to determine whether or not
youre mentally ill
this is the real reason
why do you think they might think that
well as near as i can figure out
it cause l
fight and fuck too much
in the penitentiary
no no no you mean why
why did you get sent over here
from the work farm
well i really dont know doc
it says here that you went around
let me just take a look
it aint up to me you know
one
two three
four
youve got at least
five arrests for assault
what can you tell me about that
five fights huh
rocky marciano got 40
and he a millionaire
that true
that is true
of course it true that you went in for
statutory rape
that true is it not this time
absolutely true but doc
she was 5 years old going on 35 doc
and she told me she was 8
and she was
very willing you know what i mean
i practically had to take
to sewing my pants shut
but between you and me
she might have been 5
when you get that little red beaver
right there in front of you
i dont think it crazy at all
and i dont think you do either
i hear what youre saying
no man alive could resist that
that why i got into jail to begin with
now theyre telling me
im crazy over here
cause i dont sit there
like a goddamn vegetable
it dont make a bit of sense to me
if that what being crazy is
then im senseless out of it
gone down the road whacko
but no more no less that it
to be honest with you mcmurphy
what it says here
is that
they think
they think
youve been faking it
in order to get out of your work detail
what do you think about that
do i look like that kind of guy to you
let just be frank for a minute
all right randall if you would
tell me
do you think there anything
wrong with your mind really
not a thing doc
im a goddamn marvel of modern science
youre going to be here for a period
for us to evaluate you
were going to study you
well make our determinations
as to what were going to do
and give you the necessary treatment
as indicated
doc let me just tell you this
im here to cooperate with you
a hundred percent
a hundred percent
ill be just right down the line with you
you watch
cause i think we ought to get
to the bottom of
rp mcmurphy
rp mcmurphy
the scythe
im awfully tired
sit down
im tired
is that better
mr ellsworth
youll wear yourself out
all right gentlemen let begin
at the close of friday meeting
we were discussing
mr harding problem concerning his wife
mr harding stated that his wife
made him uneasy
because she drew stares
from men on the street
is that correct mr harding
yes
that correct
he also thinks he may have
given her reason
to seek sexual attention elsewhere
but he wasnt able to say how
mr harding has been heard
to say to his wife
i hate you
i dont ever want to see you again
youve betrayed me
so does anyone care
to touch on this further
mr scanlon would you begin today
are you sure
billy how about you
no no maam
id like to write in my book
that you began the meeting
just once
mr martini
are you with us
yes
would you like to begin
mr cheswick
me
yes
you mean there not a man here
who has an opinion on this matter
all right
mr harding
youve stated on more than
one occasion
that youve suspected your wife
of seeing other men
oh yes
yes very much i suspect her
i suspect her
maybe you can tell us why
you suspect her
well i can only
speculate as to the reasons why
have you ever speculated mr harding
that perhaps you are
impatient with your wife
because she doesnt meet
your mental requirements
perhaps but you see
the only thing i can really
speculate on nurse ratched
is the very existence of my life
with or without my wife
in terms of the human relationships
the juxtaposition of
one person to another
the form the content
harding why dont you knock off
the bullshit and get to the point
this is the point
this is the point taber it not bullshit
im not just talking about my wife
im talking about my life
i cant seem to get that through to you
im not just talking about one person
im talking about everybody
im talking about form
im talking about content
im talking about interrelationships
im talking about god the devil
hell heaven
do you understand finally
yeah harding youre so fucking dumb
i cant believe it
it makes me feel very peculiar
very peculiar
when you throw in something like that
why
what does that mean peculiar harding
peculiar
peculiar
im gonna tell you guys something
you just dont want to learn anything
you just dont want to listen to anybody
he got intelligence
youve never heard the word peculiar
say what are you trying to say
you trying to say im queer is that it
little mary ann little marjorie jane
is that what youre trying to tell me
is that your idea of communicating
something to me
well is it
theyre all crowding in on you
mr harding
theyre all ganging up on you
is that news
they sometimes want to gang up
on me too but i
cheswick do me a favor
take it easy
and stay off my side
but i only want to
i only want to help you
i understand
but dont you want me to

both of you
illusions

to sexual problems
i might be having with my wife
let say it true let say
i know it true but you dont
if that your idea of trying
to tell me something
you know harding i think youre
some kind of morbid asshole
peculiar
asshole again
it makes you feel peculiar
youve talked about your wife
ever since i can remember
you know she on your mind

well mr mcmurphy what youre asking
is that we change
a very carefully worked out schedule
a little change never hurt huh
a little variety
well it not necessarily true
mr mcmurphy
some men on the ward take a long
long time to get used to the schedule
change it now
and they might find it very disturbing
fuck the schedule they can go back
to the schedule after the series
im talking about the world series
nurse ratched
well anyway this is no way
to proceed about this
how would it be if we had a vote
and let the majority rule
great let vote on it
