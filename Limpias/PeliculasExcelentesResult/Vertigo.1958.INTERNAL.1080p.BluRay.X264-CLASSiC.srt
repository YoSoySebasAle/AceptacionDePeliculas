once youve quit the police force
you sound so
disapproving midge
no it your life
but you were the bright
young lawyer that decided
he was going to be
chief of police someday
i had to quit
why
well it because of this fear
of heights i have this acrophobia
i wake up at night seeing
that man fall from the roof
and i try to reach out
to him and it just
it wasnt your fault
i know that what
everybody tells me
johnny the doctors
explained to you
i know i know
i have acrophobia
which gives me vertigo and i get dizzy
boy what a moment
to find out i had it
well youve got it
and there no losing it
and there no one to blame
so why quit
you mean and sit behind a desk
chair-borne
where you belong
what about my acrophobia
what about
now suppose im sitting in this chair
behind the desk here the desk
and a pencil falls from the desk
down to the floor
and i reach down to pick up the pencil
bingo my acrophobia back
oh johnny-o
well whatll you do
well im not gonna
do anything for a while
you know dont forget im a man
of independent means as the saying goes
fairly independent
mmm-hmm
well why dont you
go away for a while
you mean to forget
oh no midge
dont be so motherly
im not gonna crack up
have you had any
dizzy spells this week

midge the music
dont you think it sort of
oh
what this doohickey
it a brassiere you know about
those things youre a big boy now
ive never run across
one like that
it brand-new
revolutionary uplift
no shoulder straps no back straps
but does everything
a brassiere should do
works on the principle
of the cantilever bridge
it does
mmm-hmm
an aircraft engineer
down the peninsula designed it
he worked it out
in his spare time
kind of a hobby
a do-it-yourself
type of thing
how your love life midge
that following
a train of thought
well
normal
arent you ever
gonna get married
you know there only one man
in the world for me johnny-o
you mean me we were engaged once
though werent we
three whole weeks
good old college days

in college by the name of gavin elster

could do it and probably wouldnt
youre not gonna go diving off
another rooftop to find out
i think i can lick it

oh johnny johnny
how did you get in the shipbuilding
business gavin
i married into it
very interesting business
no to be honest
i find it dull
well you dont have to
do it for a living
no but one assumes
responsibilities
my wife family
is all gone
someone has to look
after her interests
her father partner runs the company yard
in the east baltimore
so i decided as long as i had to work
at it id come back here
ive always
liked it here
how long have you
been back
almost a year
you like it huh
well san francisco
changed
the things that spell san francisco
to me are disappearing fast
like all these
yes i should have liked to have
lived here then color excitement power
freedom
shouldnt you
be sitting down
no no im all right
i was sorry to read about that thing
in the paper and youve quit the force
is it a permanent
physical disability
no no
it just means that i cant climb stairs
that are too steep or go to high places
like the bar at
the top of the mark
but there are plenty
of street-level bars in this town
would you like a drink now
no i dont think so no it
a little early in the day for me
well i guess that just
about covers everything doesnt it
i never married i dont see much of
the old college gang
im a retired detective and youre
in the shipbuilding business
what on your mind gavin
i asked you to come up here scottie
knowing that youd quit detective work
but i wondered whether youd go back
on the job as a special favor to me
i want you
to follow my wife
no it not that
were very happily married
well then
im afraid some harm
may come to her
from whom
someone dead
scottie do you believe that
someone out of the past
someone dead can enter
and take possession of a living being
no
if i told you that i believe this has happened
to my wife what would you say
well id say take her to
the nearest psychiatrist or psychologist
or neurologist or psycho
or maybe just the plain family doctor
id have him
check on you too
then youre of no use to me
im sorry i wasted your time
thanks for coming in
scottie
okay
i i didnt mean
to be that rough
no it sounds idiotic
i know
and youre still the hardheaded scot
arent you
always were
do you think im making it up
no
im not making it up
i wouldnt know how
shell be talking to me
about something
suddenly the words
fade into silence
a cloud comes into her eyes
and they go blank
she somewhere else away from me
someone i dont know
i call to her
she doesnt even hear me
then with a long sigh
she back
looks at me brightly
doesnt even know she been away
cant tell me
where or when
well how often
does this happen
more and more
in the past few weeks
and she wanders
god knows where she wanders
i followed her one day
watched her coming out of the apartment
someone i didnt know
she even walked
a different way
got into her car and drove out
to golden gate park five miles
sat by the lake
staring across the water at the pillars
that stand on the far shore
you know portals of the past
sat there a long time
without moving
i had to leave
get back to the office
when i got home that evening
i asked her what shed done all day
she said shed driven out to golden gate park
and sat by the lake that all
well
the speedometer on her car showed
that shed driven 94 miles
where did she go
ive gotta know scottie
where she goes and what she does
before i get involved
with doctors
well have you talked
to the doctors at all about that
yes but carefully
i want to know more before committing
her to that kind of care
scottie
all right ill get you a firm
of private eyes to follow her for you
theyre dependable
good boys
i want you
look this isnt my line
scottie i need a friend someone i can trust
im in a panic about this
im supposed to be retired i dont want
to get mixed up in this darn thing

i want you to introduce me get your hat
i dont need a hat
hey johnny
what it all about
hey
wait a minute
hello yes
i remember carlotta
the beautiful carlotta
the sad carlotta
what does an old wooden house
at the corner of eddy and gough street
have to do with
carlotta valdes
well it was hers it was built
for her many years ago
by whom
by
by
no the name
i do not remember
a rich man
a powerful man
cigarette
no thank you
cigarette miss
no thanks
it is not an unusual story
she came from somewhere small
to the south of the city
some say from
a mission settlement
young yes
very young
and she was found dancing and singing
in a cabaret by that man
and he took her and built
for her the great house
in the western addition
and there was a
there was a child
yes that it
a child a child
i cannot tell you exactly
how much time passed
or how much happiness
there was
but then
he threw her away
he had no other children
his wife had no children
so he kept the child
and threw her away
you know a man could
do that in those days
they had the power
and the freedom
and she became
the sad carlotta
alone in the great house
walking the streets alone
her clothes becoming old
and patched and dirty
and the mad carlotta
stopping people
in the streets to ask
where is my child
have you seen my child
poor thing
and she died
she died
how
by her own hand
there are many
such stories
well thank you very much
you are welcome
i appreciate it
good-bye
good-bye
hey wait a minute
good-bye pop thanks a lot
now then johnny-o pay me
for what
for bringing you here
come on tell
there nothing to tell
youll tell or youll be back in that corset
come on johnny please
come on come on
ill take you home
there we are
you havent told me everything
no ive told you enough
who the guy
and who the wife
out ive got things to do
i know the one that phoned
your old college chum elster
midge out please
and the idea is
that the beautiful mad carlotta has
come back from the dead
and taken possession
of elster wife
now johnny really come on
well im not telling you what i think
im telling you what he thinks
well what do you think
well i
is she pretty
carlotta
no not carlotta
elster wife
yes
i guess youd consider
that she would be
i think ill go take a look
at that portrait good-bye
midge
good-bye
midge you
youve done well scottie
youre good at your job
that carlotta valdes
yes
there are things
you didnt tell me
i didnt know where shed lead you
but you knew about this
oh yeah
you notice the way
she does her hair
you know
there something else
my wife madeleine has several pieces
of jewelry that belonged to carlotta
she inherited them
never wore them
they were too old-fashioned
until now
now when she alone she takes
them out and looks at them
handles them gently
curiously
puts them on and stares
at herself in the mirror
and goes into that other world
is someone else again
now carlotta valdes
was what
your wife grandmother
great-grandmother
now the child
who was taken from her
whose loss drove carlotta mad and to her death
was madeleine grandmother
and the mckittrick hotel
is the old valdes home
well i think
that explains it
anyone could become obsessed
with the past with a background like that
she never heard
of carlotta valdes
she knows nothing of a grave
out at the mission dolores
or that old house
on eddy street the
the portrait at the palace of the legion of
nothing
well when she goes
to these places
she no longer my wife
well how do you know
all these things she doesnt
her mother told me most of them
before she died

for myself here

she tell her daughter
natural fear
her grandmother went insane
took her own life

that once youve saved a person life
youre responsible for it forever
so im committed
i have to know
there so little
that i know
it as though i were walking
down a long corridor
that once was mirrored and fragments
of that mirror still hang there
and when i come to the end
of the corridor
there nothing but darkness
and i know that when
i walk into the darkness
that ill die
ive never come to the end
ive always come back before then
except once
yesterday
and you didnt know
you didnt know what happened
till you found
yourself with me
you didnt know
where you were
but the small scenes the fragments
of the mirror you remember those
vaguely
what do you remember
there a room
and i sit there alone
always alone
what else
a grave
where
i dont know
it an open grave and i
i stand by the gravestone
looking down into it
it my grave
but how do you know
i know
but is there a name
on the gravestone
no no it new
and clean and waiting
well what else
this part is a dream
i think
there a tower and a bell
and a garden below
it seems to be in spain
a village in spain
it clicks off and it gone
well a portrait
do you see a portrait
no
if i could just find the key
the beginning and put it together i
so explain it away
there a way
to explain it you see
if im mad then that would
explain it wouldnt it
madeleine
oh scottie
im not mad im not mad
i dont want to die
there someone within me
and she says i must die

urge to see me

desperate to me

a little undercurrent

it was the tower again and the bell
and the old spanish village
yes
clear so very clear
for the first time all of it
tell me
it was a village square
and a green with trees
and an old whitewashed
spanish church with a cloister
across the green there was a big
gray wooden house
with a porch and shutters
and a balcony above a small garden
and next to it
a livery stable
with old carriages
lined up inside
go on
at the end of the green
there was a whitewashed stone house
with a lovely pepper tree
at the corner
and an old wooden hotel
from the old california days
and a saloon dark low ceilings
with hanging oil lamps
yes
it all there
it no dream
youve been there before
youve seen it
no never
madeleine a hundred miles
south of san francisco

spanish mission

and it been preserved

think of when you were here
there were not
so many carriages then
there were horses
in the stalls
a bay two black
and a gray
it was our favorite place
but we were forbidden
to play here
sister teresa
would scold us
look at this

of the stall without being pushed
but even so

i loved you and i wanted
to go on loving you

let me go into
the church alone
but why
madeleine
madeleine
madeleine
ferguson
mr elster suspecting that all was not well
with his wife mental state
took the preliminary precaution
of having her watched by mr ferguson
lest any harm befall her
and you have heard that
mr elster was prepared
to take his wife
to an institution
where her mental health would have been
in the hands of qualified specialists
mr ferguson
being an ex-detective
would have seemed the proper choice
for the role of watchdog and protector
as you have learned
it was an unfortunate choice
however i think youll agree that no blame
can be attached to the husband
his delay in putting his wife
under medical care was due
only to the need for information
as to her behavior
which he expected to
get from mr ferguson
he had taken every precaution
to protect his wife
he could not have anticipated that
mr ferguson weakness his fear of heights
would make him powerless
when he was most needed
as to mr ferguson
you have heard his former superior
detective captain hansen
from that great city
to the north
testify as to his
character and ability
captain hansen was
most enthusiastic
the fact that once before
under similar circumstances
mr ferguson allowed a police colleague
to fall to his death
captain hansen dismissed
as an unfortunate incident
of course mr ferguson
is to be congratulated
on having once saved
the woman life
when in a previous fit of aberration
she threw herself into the bay
it is a pity that knowing
her suicidal tendencies
he did not make a greater effort
the second time
but we are not here
to pass judgment
on mr ferguson lack of initiative
he did nothing
and the law has little to say
on the subject of things left undone
nor does his strange behavior
after he saw the body fall
have any bearing
on your verdict
he did not remain at the scene
of the death he left
he claims he suffered a mental blackout
and knew nothing more
until he found himself back
in his own apartment in san francisco
several hours later
you may accept that or not
or you may believe that having once
again allowed someone to die
he could not face the tragic result
of his own weakness
and ran away
that has nothing to do
with your verdict
it is a matter between him
and his own conscience
now from the evidence of the state
of mind of madeleine elster
prior to her death from
the manner of her death
and from the postmortem
examination of the body
showing the actual cause
of her death
you should have no difficulty
in reaching your verdict gentlemen
you may retire if you wish
hold on mr jones
weve reached a verdict
thank you
the jury finds that madeleine elster
committed suicide
while of unsound mind
your verdict will be
so recorded dismissed
all right scottie
let go
mind if i speak to him
for a minute
no go ahead
scottie
sorry scottie
that was rough
he had no right
to speak to you like that
it was my responsibility
i shouldnt have got you involved
no there nothing
you have to say to me
im getting out
scottie for good
i cant stay here
im going to wind up her affairs and mine
get away as far as i can
europe perhaps and i probably
never will come back
good-bye scottie
if there anything
i can do for you before i go
there was no way
for them to understand
you and i know
who killed madeleine
come on scottie
let get out of here
it mozart
wolfgang amadeus
i had a long talk with that lady
in musical therapy johnny
and she says that

the lady said
you know it wonderful how they have
it all taped now john
i have music
for dipsomaniacs
and music for melancholiacs
and music for hypochondriacs

at least six months perhaps a year

depend on him

from acute melancholia
together with
a guilt complex
he blames himself
for what happened to the woman
we we know little
of what went on before
well i can give you one thing
he was in love with her
oh that does complicate
the problem doesnt it

know something doctor

like her he dressed me up like her
it was quite safe because she lived
in the country and rarely came to town

to kill herself
he knew of your illness he knew youd never
