before you turn into a lonesome
and bitter old man
yeah cant you

rushing home to
a hot apartment
to listen to the automatic laundry
and the electric dishwasher
and the garbage disposal
and the nagging wife

so deep if i were you

far too much water
why dont
you shut up
well
i do declare
new york state sentence for a peeping tom is
six months in the workhouse
oh hello stella
and they got no windows
in the workhouse
you know in the old days they used
to put your eyes out with a red-hot poker
any of those bikini bombshells
youre always watching worth a red-hot poker
oh dear weve become
a race of peeping toms
what people ought to do is get outside
their own house and look in for a change
yes sir
how that for a bit
of homespun philosophy
reader digest
april 939
well i only quote from the best
yeah
you dont have to take my
temperature this morning
quiet see if you
can break 00
you know i should have
been a gypsy fortune-teller
instead of
an insurance-company nurse
i got a nose for trouble
can smell it ten miles away
you heard of that market crash in 29
i predicted that
just how did you do that stella
oh simple
i was nursing
a director of general motors
kidney ailment they said
nerves i said
then i asked myself what general motors
got to be nervous about
overproduction i says
collapse
when general motors has to
go to the bathroom 0 times a day
the whole country
ready to let go
you know stella
in economics
a kidney ailment has no relationship
to the stock market
none whatsoever
crashed
didnt it
i can smell trouble right here
in this apartment
first you smash your leg then you
get to looking out the window
see things you shouldnt see
trouble
i can see you
in court now
surrounded by a bunch of lawyers
in double-breasted suits
youre pleading you say judge it was only
a little bit of innocent fun
i love my neighbors
like a father
and the judge says
well congratulations
youve just given birth
to three years in dannemora
right now id welcome
trouble you know
youve got a
hormone deficiency
how can you tell
from a thermometer
those bathing beauties
youve been watching
havent raised your temperature
one degree in a month
here we go
one more week
no i think youre right i think
there is gonna be trouble around here
i knew it
ooh
do you ever
heat that stuff
gives your circulation
something to fight
oh i see
what kind
of trouble
lisa fremont
you kidding
she a beautiful young girl and youre
a reasonably healthy young man
she expects me
to marry her
that normal
i dont want to
that abnormal
i just im not
ready for marriage
every man ready for marriage
when the right girl comes along
and lisa fremont is the right girl
for any man with half a brain
who can get
one eye open
she all right
whatd you do have a fight
no
father loading
up the shotgun
what
please stella
it happened
before you know
some of the world
happiest marriages
have started under the gun
as you might say
no she just not
the girl for me
yeah she
only perfect
she too perfect she too talented
she too beautiful she too sophisticated
she too everything
but what i want
is what you want something
you can discuss
what it very
simple stella
she belongs to that rarefied atmosphere
of park avenue you know
expensive restaurants and
literary cocktail parties
people with sense belong
wherever theyre put
can you imagine her traveling
around the world with a camera bum
who never has more than
a week salary in the bank
if she was
only ordinary
you never gonna
get married
ill probably get married one
of these days
but when i do it gonna be
to someone who thinks of life
not just as a new dress
and a lobster dinner
or latest scandal
i need a woman who
willing to hold it
who willing to go anywhere
and do anything and love it
so the honest thing for me to do is
just call the whole thing off
let her find
somebody else
yeah i can
hear you now
get out of my life
you perfectly wonderful woman
youre too good for me
look mr jefferies
im not an educated woman
but i can tell
you one thing
when a man and a woman see
each other and like each other
they ought to come together wham
like a couple of taxis on broadway
and not sit around analyzing each other
like two specimens in a bottle
there an intelligent way
to approach marriage
intelligence
nothing has caused the human race
so much trouble as intelligence
modern marriage
no weve progressed
emotionally
baloney
once it was see somebody
get excited get married
now it read a lot of books
fence with a lot of four-syllable words
psychoanalyze each other
until you cant tell
the difference between
a petting party and
a civil service exam
people have different
emotional levels
when i married myles we were both
a couple of maladjusted misfits
we are still maladjusted misfits
and we have loved every minute of it
well that
fine stella
now would you fix me
a sandwich please
yes i will
and ill spread a little common
sense on the bread
lisa loaded to her fingertips
with love for you
i got two words of advice
for you marry her
she pay you much
oh
there
here the key
thank you
well if you want
anything just ring
honey
come on
got to carry you
over the threshold
window shopper
how your leg
it hurts a little
and your stomach
empty as a football
and your love life
not too active
anything else
bothering you
mmm-hmm
who are you
reading from top
to bottom lisa
carol
fremont
is this the lisa fremont who never wears
the same dress twice
only because it
expected of her
it right off the paris plane
do you think itll sell
that depends on the quote
you know let see now
there the airplane ticket over and import duties
hidden taxes profit markup
a steal at $00
eleven hundred
they ought to list that dress
on the stock exchange
why we sell a dozen
a day in this price range
who buys them
tax collectors
even if i had to pay it would be
worth it just for the occasion
why is something big
going on somewhere
it going on right here
it a big night
it just an old run-of-the-mill wednesday
the calendar full of them
it opening night of the last depressing week
of lb jefferies in a cast
well i havent noticed a big demand
for tickets or anything
that because i
bought out the house
you know this cigarette box has
seen better days
i picked that up in shanghai
which has also seen better days
it cracked and you never use it
it too ornate
im sending up a plain flat silver one
with just your initials engraved
that no way to spend your
hard-earned money
well i wanted to
oh
what would you think of starting off
with dinner at 2
you have perhaps an
ambulance downstairs
no better than that
thank you for waiting carl
the kitchen right there on the left
oh ill take the wine
good evening mr jefferies
carl
just put everything in the oven
carl on low
yes madam
let open the wine now
all right
it a montrachet
a great big glassful
there a corkscrew right over there
here ill do it
big enough
yeah theyre fine
i cant think of anything more boring
or tiresome than what youve been through
and the last week must be the hardest
let me sir
all right
yeah i want to get this thing off
and get moving
well im going to make this
a week youll never forget
fine thanks
just a
minute carl
this will take care
of the taxi as well
thank you
miss fremont
have a pleasant dinner
mr jefferies
all right
good night
good night
what a day
ive had
are you tired
not a bit
i was all morning
in a sales meeting
then i had to dash to the waldorf
for a quick drink with madame dufresne
who just over from paris
with some spy reports
and then i had to go to 2 and have lunch
with the harper bazaar people
and that when
i ordered dinner
then i had two fall showings
20 blocks apart
then i had to have a cocktail
with leland and slim hayward
were trying to
get his new show
and then i had to
dash back and change
well now tell me tell me
now what was mrs hayward wearing
oh she looked wonderfully cool
she did
she had on the most
divine italian hand-print
mousseline de soie
oh italian
oh you
italian imagine
to think i planted three nice items
in the columns about you today
you did
you cant buy that
kind of publicity
i know
someday you may want to open up
a studio of your own here
how would i run it
from say pakistan
jeff
isnt it time you came home
you could pick your assignment
i wish there
was one i wanted
make the one
you want
you mean leave the magazine
yes
for what
for yourself
and me
i could get you a dozen
assignments tomorrow
dont laugh
i could do it
that what im afraid of
can you see me driving down
to the fashion salon in a jeep
wearing combat boots
and a three-day beard
wouldnt that
make a hit
i could see you looking very handsome
and successful in a dark blue flannel suit
let stop talking
nonsense shall we
hmm
guess id better start
setting up for dinner
to see you is to love you
and i see you everywhere
in the sunrise
in the moon glow
any place i look youre there
to see you is to want you
and i see you all the time
on a sidewalk
in a doorway
on the lonely stairs i climb
someday let me show you
how happy endings start
youll find how well
i know you
cause to know you at all
is to know you by heart
to see you is to love you
and youre never out of sight
and i love you
and ill see you
in the same old dream
tonight
miss lonelyheart
at least that something
youll never have to worry about
oh
you can see my apartment from here
all the way up on 63rd street
no not exactly but we have
a little apartment here
that probably about
as popular as yours
you remember of course
miss torso the ballet dancer
she like a queen bee
with her pick of the drones
id say she doing
a woman hardest job juggling wolves
thank you
well she picked the most
prosperous-looking one
she not in love with him
or any of them
oh how can you
tell that from here
you said it resembled
my apartment didnt you
i hope theyre
cooked this time
where that wonderful
music coming from
some songwriter over there
in the studio apartment
wow
he lives alone probably
had a very unhappy marriage
oh it enchanting
it almost as if it were being
written especially for us
hmm
no wonder he having so much
trouble with it
at least you cant say
the dinner isnt right
lisa it perfect
as always
there cant be that much difference
between people and the way they live
we all eat talk
drink laugh wear clothes
well now look
if youre saying all this because you dont
want to tell me the truth
because youre hiding something
from me then maybe i can understand
im not hiding anything
it just that
it doesnt
make sense
what so different about it here
from over there or anyplace you go
that one person couldnt live
in both places just as easily
some people can
now if youll just let me
what is it but traveling from one place
to another taking pictures
it just like being a tourist
on an endless vacation
okay
now that your opinion
youre entitled to it
now let me give you my side
it ridiculous to say that
it can only be done
by a special private little group
of anointed people
i made a simple statement
a true statement
but i can back it up if youd
just shut up for a minute
if your opinion is as rude as your manner
i dont think i care to hear it
oh come on now
simmer down
i cant fit in here
you cant fit in there
i mean according to you people should be born
live and die on the same spot
shut up
did you ever eat
fish heads and rice
of course not
well you might have
to if you went with me
did you ever try to keep warm in a c-54
at 5000 feet 20 degrees below zero
oh i do it all the time whenever i have
a few minutes after lunch
did you ever get shot at
did you ever get run over
did you ever get
sandbagged at night
because somebody got unfavorable publicity
from your camera
did you ever those high heels
theyll be great in the jungle
and the nylons and
those six-ounce lingerie
three
all right three
theyll make a big hit in finland
just before you freeze to death
well if there one thing i know
it how to wear the proper clothes
yeah yeah
well try and find a raincoat in brazil
even when it isnt raining
lisa in this job
you carry one suitcase
your home is
the available transportation
you dont sleep very much
you bathe less
and sometimes
the food that you eat
is made from things that you couldnt
even look at when theyre alive
jeff you dont have to be deliberately repulsive
just to impress me im wrong
deliberately repulsive
im just trying to make it sound good
you just have to face it lisa
youre not meant for that kind of a life
few people are
youre too stubborn
to argue with
im not stubborn
im just truthful
i know a lesser man would have told me
it was one long holiday
and i would have been awakened
to a rude disillusionment
oh well now wait a minute
wait a minute
if you want to get vicious on this thing
id be very happy to accommodate you
no i dont particularly
want that
so that it
you wont stay here
and i cant go with you
it would be
the wrong thing
you dont think either one of us
could ever change
right now it
doesnt seem so
im in love with you i dont care
what you do for a living
id just like to be
part of it somehow
it deflating to find out
the only way i can be part of it
is to take out a subscription
to your magazine
i guess im not the girl
i thought i was
there nothing wrong
with you lisa
youve got this town
in the palm of your hand
not quite it seems
goodbye jeff
you mean good night
i mean what i said
well lisa
couldnt we just
uh
couldnt we just keep things
status quo
without any future
when am i gonna
see you again
not for a long time
at least
not until tomorrow night
dont
hey rain
grab that the rest of the blanket
wait ill get the clock
oh no
put it in now
pull on it
let me do it
in you go
no you cant come in
it much too late
no no not now get your foot
out of the way no i said good night
what that supposed to be
maam
it called
hunger
youd think the rain would have
cooled things off
all it did was
make the heat wet
that it
that it
that stiff one right there
right there
you know the insurance company
would be much happier
if youd sleep in bed at night instead of
in that wheelchair
howd you know
eyes are
all bloodshot
must have been watching out
that window for hours
yeah i was
what are you gonna do if
one of them catches you
it depends
which one
miss torso
for example
you keep your
mind off her
she sure is the eat
drink and be merry girl
yeah shell wind up fat
alcoholic and miserable
yeah
speaking of misery poor miss lonelyheart
she drank herself to sleep again alone
poor soul
oh well
maybe one day shell
find her happiness
yeah and some man
will lose his
isnt there anybody in the neighborhood
who could cast an eye in her direction
i dont know
it just might be that the salesman
will be available soon
oh him and his wife
splitting up
i just cant
figure it
he went out several times last night
in the rain carrying his sample case
well he a salesman
isnt he
what would he be selling
at 300 in the morning
flashlights
luminous dials for watches
house numbers that light up
i dont think so
i dont think so
i think he was taking something out
of the apartment
uh-huh
his personal effects
he gonna run out
on her the coward
yeah
sometimes it worse
to stay than it is to run
yeah well it takes a particularly low type
of man to do a thing like that
how about this morning
any further developments
the shades are all
drawn in the apartment
in this heat
yeah
well theyre up now
get back
get back
where do you
want me to go
come on get out of sight
get out of sight
what is it
what the matter
that salesman looking out
of his window you see
get back
hell see you
im not shy
ive been looked at before
that no ordinary look
that the kind
of look a man gives
when he afraid somebody
might be watching him
get away from there get away from there
hell be after you
go on into the house
into the house
goodbye mr jefferies
see you tomorrow
uh-huh
and dont sleep in
that chair again
uh-huh
uh-huh uh-huh
great conversationalist
stella
take those binoculars out of the case
and bring them here will you
trouble
i can smell it
ill be glad when they crack that cast
and i can get out of here
uh-huh
how far does a girl have
to go before youll notice her
well if she pretty enough
she doesnt have to go anywhere
she just has to be
well aint i
pay attention to me
im not exactly on
the other side of the room
your mind is
and when i want a man
i want all of him
dont you ever
have any problems
i have one now
so do i
tell me about it
why
why would a man leave his apartment three times
on a rainy night with a suitcase
and come back
three times
he likes the way his
wife welcomes him home
no no no no
no no not this
salesman wife
and why didnt he
go to work today
homework it
more interesting
what interesting
about a butcher knife
and a small saw
wrapped in newspaper
hmm
nothing
thank heaven
why hasnt he been
in his wife bedroom all day
i wouldnt dare
answer that
well listen ill answer it lisa
there something terribly wrong
and im afraid
it with me
what do you think
something too
frightful to utter
he went out a few minutes ago
in his undershirt hasnt come back yet
thatd be a terrible job
to tackle
just how would you start
to cut up a human body
jeff ill be honest with you
youre beginning to scare me a little
jeff did you hear what i said
youre beginning to scare
shh shh
he coming back
jeff if you could
only see yourself
what the matter
sitting around looking out of the window
to kill time is one thing
but doing it the way you are
with binoculars and wild opinions
about every little thing you see
is diseased
what do you think i
consider it recreation
i dont know what
you consider it
but if you dont stop it
im getting out of here
what the
what is it youre
looking for
i just want to find out what the matter
with the salesman wife that all
does that make me
sound like a madman
what makes you think there something
the matter with her
a lot of things she an invalid
she demands constant care
yet neither the husband or anybody else
has been in to see her all day why
maybe she died
where the doctor
where the undertaker
she could be sleeping
under sedatives
he in there now
there nothing to see
there is something
ive seen it through that window
ive seen bickering
and family quarrels
and mysterious trips at night
and knives and saws and ropes
and now since last evening
not a sign of the wife
all right now you tell me
where she is
i dont know
what she doing where is she
maybe he leaving his wife
i dont know i dont care
lots of people have knives and saws
and ropes around their houses
and lots of men dont speak
to their wives all day
lots of wives nag and men hate them
and trouble starts
but very very few of them end up in murder
if that what youre thinking
it pretty hard for you to keep away
from that word isnt it
you could see all that he did couldnt you
of course
you could see
because the shades were up
and he walked along the corridor
and the street and the backyard
ive seen him in the backyard
fixing the flowers
oh jeff do you think a murderer
would let you see all that
that he wouldnt pull the shades down
and hide behind them
just where he being clever
he being nonchalant about it
and that where youre not
being clever
a murderer would never parade his crime
in front of an open window
why not
why for all you know
there probably something a lot more
sinister going on behind those windows
where
oh
no comment
let start from
the beginning again jeff
tell me everything
you saw
and what you think
it means
yeah
the name
on the second floor
rear mail box reads
mr and mrs lars
that l-a-r-s
lars thorwald
what the number of
the apartment house
25 west
9th street
thank you dear
okay chief
what my next assignment
just go home
all right
but what he doing now
he just sitting
in the living room in the dark
hasnt gone
near the bedroom
now you go home
and get some sleep
good night
good night
all right
what it all about jeff
now look doyle it just something
i cant tell you over the telephone
you have to be here
and see the whole setup
important huh
well it probably
nothing important at all
it just a little neighborhood murder
that all
did you say murder
jeff
yes as a matter of fact
i did say murder
oh come now
my only thought was throwing
a little business your way that all
i figured a good detective would jump
at the chance of something to detect
im not working
what
this happens to
be my day off
well i usually took
my best pictures on my day off
ill drop by
okay doyle all right
as soon as you can
bless your heart stella
gee whiz look at this
i cant tell you
what a welcome sight this is
no wonder your husband
still loves you
the police
what
you called the police
well not exactly
not an official call
it just an old friend of mine
an old ornery
friend of mine
just where do you
suppose he cut her up
of course
the bathtub
that the only place where he could
have washed away the blood
he better get that trunk out
of there before it starts to leak
harry
look look
mr jefferies
i thought doyle would be here
by the time the trunk left
or id have called the police
now were gonna lose it
hold everything
dont do anything foolish
im just gonna get the name off
that freight truck
ill keep an eye
on the alley
long distance
you didnt see the killing or the body
how do you know there was a murder
because everything this fellow done
has been suspicious
trips at night in the rain and knives
and saws and trunks with rope
and now this wife
that isnt there anymore
i admit it all has a mysterious sound
it could be any number of things
murder the
least plausible
doyle dont tell me
he an unemployed magician
amusing the neighborhood with his sleight
of hand dont tell me that
it too obvious and stupid
a way to commit murder
in full view
of 50 windows
then sit over there
smoking a cigar
waiting for the police
to come and pick him up
all right officer do your duty
go over and pick him up
jeff youve got a lot to learn
about homicide
why morons have
committed murder so shrewdly
it taken a hundred trained police minds
to catch them
that salesman wouldnt just knock
his wife off after dinner
and toss her in the trunk
and put her in storage
ill bet it been done
most everything
been done under panic
this is
a thousand-to-one shot
he still sitting around the apartment
that man not panicked
you think
i made all this up
well i think
you saw something
there probably a very simple
explanation for that
for instance
wife took a trip
his wife was sick
in bed
yeah so you told me
well jeff
ive got to run along
i wont report this to the department
let me poke into it a little on my own
no sense in your getting a lot of
ridiculous publicity
thank you
we know the wife is gone
so ill see if i can find out where
do that
you had any
headaches lately
not until you
showed up
itll wear off
along with the hallucinations
see you around
get along
he has
a six months lease
used up a little more than five
and a half months of it
he quiet drinks
but not to drunkenness
pays his bills promptly with money earned
as a costume jewelry salesman
wholesale
kept to himself none of his neighbors
got close to him or his wife
yeah well i think they missed
their chance with her
she never left
the apartment
where is she the icebox
until yesterday morning
what time
600 am
600 am
i think that about
the time i fell asleep
too bad
thorwalds were leaving their apartment
at just that time
feel a little foolish
no not yet
how your wife
oh she fine
who said
they left then
who left where
the thorwalds
at 600 in the morning
oh the building superintendent
and two tenants
flat statements no hesitation
they jived with the letter
thorwalds were on their way
to the railroad station
well now tom how could anybody
possibly guess that
what did they have signs on their luggage
saying grand central or bust
the superintendent met thorwald
on his way back
thorwald told him that hed put
his wife on a train to the country
i see id say this is a pretty
convenient guy this superintendent
have you checked his bank
statements lately
huh
well what good
his information
it a secondhand version
of an unsupported story
by the murderer
himself thorwald
now did anybody actually see
the wife get on the train
i hate to
remind you
but this all started because you said
she was murdered
now did anyone including you
actually see her murdered
what are you doing
are you interested in solving this case
or in making me look foolish
well if possible both
well then do a
good job of it
go over there
and search thorwald apartment
it must be knee-deep
in evidence
i cant do that
well no i dont mean right now
but when he goes out for a drink
or a paper or something
what he doesnt know wont hurt him
i cant do that
even if he isnt there
what he does he have a courtesy card
from the police department or something
now dont get me mad
not even a detective can walk
into an apartment and search it
if i were caught in there
theyd have my badge within 0 minutes
all right make sure
you dont get caught that all
what if you find something
youve got a murderer
and they dont care anything
about a couple of house rules
if you dont find anything
the fellow clear
at the risk of sounding stuffy id like
to remind you of the constitution
and the phrase search warrant issued
by a judge
who knows his bill
of rights verbatim
he must ask for evidence
give him evidence
yeah i can
hear myself
your honor i have a friend
who an amateur sleuth
well the other night after having
a heavy dinner he
hed throw the new york state
penal code right in my face
and there
six volumes
you know by tomorrow morning
there may not be any evidence left
over in that apartment
you know that
it a detective
nightmare
what do you need
before you can search
tell me now
what do you need
bloody footsteps leading up
to the door
one thing i dont need is heckling
you called me and asked for help
now youre behaving
like a taxpayer
how did we ever stand
each other in that plane
for three years
during the war
i guess ill go over to the railroad station
and check on thorwald story
oh forget
about the story
find the trunk
mrs thorwald in it
oh i almost forgot
there was a postcard in
thorwald mailbox it was
mailed 330 yesterday
afternoon from merritsville
that 80 miles
north of here
message went arrived okay
already feeling better
love anna
oh
is that
anna is that
who i think it is
mrs thorwald
oh so anything
you need jeff
you might send me
a good detective
many dreams ago
i dreamed many dreams
waiting for my true love
to appear
though each night it seems
someone filled my dreams
still the face
that i kissed wasnt clear
so i let my heart dance
to many sweet refrains
but now just one song
and just one dream remains
that one song is you
and at last i know
youre the one i dreamed of
many dreams ago
hello
hello miss doyle
yes
this is jeff again
has tom come in yet
not yet jeff
you mean you havent
even heard from him
not a word is it something
really important jeff
yeah im afraid
it is tess
ill have him call the moment
i hear from him
no no dont
bother to do that
just have him get over here
as soon as he can
looks like thorwald
pulling out tonight
who thorwald
hell know
hell know
and thorwald a man
tess dont worry
good night you idiot
good night
long distance again
there somebody
at the door
hi
hello
hello
whatd you
do to your hair
oh well i just sort of
take a look at thorwald
he getting ready to pull out
for good look at him
he doesnt seem
to be in any hurry
he been laying out all his things
on one of the beds
shirts suits
coats socks
even his wife
that alligator handbag
his wife had on the bedpost
what about it
he had it hidden in the dresser
at least it was there
he took it out went to the telephone
and made a long-distance call
he had his wife jewelry
in the handbag
seemed worried
about it
asked somebody advice over
the telephone
someone not his wife
well i never saw
him ask her for advice
she volunteered plenty but i never
saw him ask her for any
i wonder where
he going
i dont know
suppose he doesnt come
back again
hell be back
his things are still there
well i guess it safe
to put on some lights now
no not yet
okay you can turn it on now
he must have gone someplace to the right
all day long ive been trying
to keep my mind on my work
thinking about thorwald
and you and your friend
doyle
did you hear from him again
since he left
not a word
he said he was gonna check
the railroad station and the trunk
he must be
still at it
something on
your mind
it doesnt make
sense to me
what doesnt
women arent that
unpredictable
mmm
well i cant guess
what youre thinking
a woman has a
favorite handbag
and it always hangs on her bedpost
where she can get at it easily
and then all of a sudden she goes away
on a trip and leaves it behind why
because she didnt know
she was going on a trip
and where she going
she wouldnt need the handbag
yes but only her husband
would know that
and that jewelry
women dont keep their
jewelry in a purse
getting all twisted and
scratched and tangled up
well do they hide it
in their husband clothes
they do not
and they dont leave it
behind either
why a woman going anywhere
but the hospital
would always take makeup
perfume and jewelry
put that over there
that inside stuff huh
it basic equipment
and you dont leave it behind
in your husband drawer
in your favorite handbag
well im with you sweetie
im with you
tom doyle has a pat answer
for that though
that mrs thorwald
left at 600 am
yesterday with
her husband
according to
those witnesses
well i have a pat
rebuttal for mr doyle
that couldnt have been mrs thorwald
or i dont know women
what about
the witnesses
well agree they
saw a woman
but she was not
mrs thorwald
that is not yet
is that so
come here
id like to see your friend face
when we tell him
he doesnt sound like
much of a detective
oh dont be too hard on him
he a steady worker
i sure wish
hed show up
dont rush him
we have all night
we have all what
night
im going to
stay with you
well youll have to clear that
with my landlord
i have the whole
weekend off
that very nice
but i just have one bed
if you say anything else
ill stay tomorrow night too
i wont be able to
give you any pajamas
you said ill have to
live out of one suitcase
ill bet yours
isnt this small
this is a suitcase
well a mark cross
overnight case anyway
compact but
ample enough
looks like you
packed in a hurry
look at this
isnt that amazing
ill trade you
my feminine intuition
for a bed for the night
ill go along
with that
there that
song again
where does a man get inspiration
to write a song like that
well he gets it from the landlady
once a month
it utterly beautiful
i wish i could
be creative
oh sweetie
you are
you have a great talent
for creating difficult situations
i do
sure
like staying here
all night uninvited
surprise is the most important
element of attack
and besides youre not up
on your private eye literature
when theyre in trouble
it always their girl friday
who gets them
out of it
is she the girl that saves them
from the clutches
of the seductive showgirls
and the over-passionate
daughters of the rich
the same
that the one huh
it funny he never ends up
marrying her does he
that strange
weird
why dont i slip into something
more comfortable
by all means
i mean like the kitchen
and make us some coffee
oh and some
brandy too huh
harry
jeff
hi
what else have you got
on this man thorwald
well enough to scare me you wouldnt
show up in time and wed lose him
think he getting
out of here
look he got
everything he owns
laid out over there in the bedroom
waiting to be packed
im just warming some brandy
mr doyle i presume
tom this is
miss lisa fremont
how do you do
we think thorwald guilty
careful tom
hello
lieutenant doyle
yeah he right here
for you
hello
lieutenant doyle sir
speaking
yeah
all right
i see thank you
goodbye
coffee will be
ready soon
jeff arent you going to tell him
about the jewelry
jewelry
he got his wife jewelry hidden
in his clothes in the bedroom over there
you sure it belonged
to his wife
it was
in her favorite handbag
mr doyle that can only lead
to one conclusion
namely
that it was not mrs thorwald that left
with him yesterday morning
you figured
that out eh
well it simply that women dont leave
their jewelry behind
when they go
on a trip
come on come on
tom
now you dont really need any
of this information do you
as a matter
of fact i dont
lars thorwald is no more
a murderer than i am
you mean to say you can explain everything
that gone on over there
and is still going on
no neither can you
that a secret private world
youre looking into out there
people do a lot of things in private
they couldnt possibly explain in public
like disposing
of their wives
you get that idea out of your mind
itll only lead in the wrong direction
what about the knife
and the saw
did you ever
own a saw
well at home
in the garage i had
how many people
did you cut up with it
or with the couple of hundred knives
youve probably owned in your lifetime
well your logic is backward
you cant ignore the wife disappearing
and the trunk and the jewelry
i checked the railroad station
he bought a ticket
ten minutes later
he put his wife on a train
destination merritsville
the witnesses are that deep
that might have been a woman
but it couldnt have been mrs thorwald
that jewelry
look miss fremont
that feminine intuition
stuff sells magazines
but in real life
it still a fairy tale
i dont know how many
wasted years ive spent
tracking down leads based
on female intuition
all right i take it you didnt
find the trunk
and all this is from an old speech you
once made at the policemen ball
i found the trunk
a half-hour after i left here
i suppose it normal for a man
to tie up a trunk with heavy rope
well if the lock
is broken yes
and what did you find inside the trunk
a surly note to me
mrs thorwald clothes
clean well packed
not stylish but presentable
didnt you take them
off to the crime lab
i sent them on their
merry and legal way
why when a woman is taking
a simple short trip
does she take everything
she owns
let let the female psychology
department handle that one
i would say it looked
as if she wasnt coming back
that what known
as a family problem
and if she wasnt coming back
why didnt he tell his landlord
ill tell you why he didnt tell his landlord
because he was hiding something
do you tell your
landlord everything
i told you to
be careful tom
look if id have been careful piloting
that reconnaissance plane during the war
you wouldnt have had the chance
to take the pictures
that won you a medal and a good job
and fame and money
what do you say we all sit down
and have a nice friendly drink too hmm
forget all about this
we can tell lies about the good
old days during the war
you mean youre through
with the case
there is no case to be through with
miss fremont
how about that drink
yeah i guess
youre right
well i think i better get home
and get some sleep
cheers
not much of a snifter
oh jeff if you
need any more help
consult the yellow pages
in your telephone directory
oh i love funny
exiting lines
who was that trunk
addressed to
mrs anna thorwald
well then let wait
and find out who picks it up
oh that telephone call
i gave them your number
i hope you dont mind
depends on
who they were
the police at
merritsville
they reported the trunk was
just picked up
by mrs anna thorwald
dont stay up too late
look
what
yeah he kind
of young isnt he
what are you doing
you know much as i hate to give
thomas j doyle too much credit
he might have gotten a hold
of something when he said
that was pretty private
stuff going on out there
i wonder if it ethical to watch a man
with binoculars and a long-focus lens
do you do you
suppose it ethical
even if you prove that he didnt
commit a crime
im not much on
rear-window ethics
of course they can
do the same thing to me
watch me like a bug under
a glass if they want to
jeff you know if someone came in here
they wouldnt believe what theyd see
what
you and me
with long faces
plunged into despair because we find out
a man didnt kill his wife
were two of the most frightening
ghouls ive ever known
youd think we could be a little bit happy
that the poor woman is alive and well
whatever happened to that old saying
love thy neighbor
you know i think ill start reviving
that tomorrow
yeah ill begin
with miss torso
not if i have to move
into an apartment across the way
and do the dance of the seven veils
every hour
show over for tonight
preview of coming
attractions
did mr doyle think
i stole this case
no lisa i dont
think he did
what do you think
well
i will rephrase
the question
thank you
do you like it
yes i like it
well
what the matter
somebody hurt
it the dog
something happened
to the dog
what the trouble
somebody fall out a window
see it a dog
down there
it dead
it been strangled
the neck is broken
which one of
you did it
which one of you
killed my dog
you dont know the meaning
of the word neighbors
neighbors like each other
speak to each other
care if anybody
lives or dies
but none of you do
but i couldnt imagine
any of you being so low
that youd kill a little
helpless friendly dog
the only thing in this whole neighborhood
who liked anybody
did you kill him
because he liked you
just because
he liked you
let go inside
come on let go back in
it only a dog
you know for a minute that tom doyle
almost had me convinced i was wrong
but youre not
look
in the whole courtyard only one person
didnt come to the window
look
why would thorwald want to kill
a little dog
because it
knew too much
you think this is worth
waiting all day to see
is he
cleaning house
he washing down
the bathroom walls
hmm
must have splattered
a lot
well why not
that what were all thinking
he killed her in there he has to clean up
those stains before he leaves
oh stella your
choice of words
nobody ever invented
a polite word for a killing yet
lisa lisa back there on that shelf
there a little yellow box you see it
top one
right on top yeah
bring it and bring
me the viewer there
i just got a
now these are
about two weeks old
i hope i took something else besides
eg art now which one
what are you looking for
here
there something and if im right
i think ive solved a murder
mrs thorwald
no
no the dog
uh-huh
i think i know
why thorwald killed that dog
here now you take a look
tell me what you see
now take it down
now look again
now take it down you see
but it just a picture
of the backyard that all
one important change
one important change
those flowers in thorwald pet
flower bed
you mean where the dog
was sniffing around
where the dog was digging
now look at those flowers
look right those two yellow
zinnias on this end
arent as tall
as they were
now since when do flowers
grow shorter in two weeks
there something
buried there
mrs thorwald
you havent spent much time
around cemeteries have you
mr thorwald could scarcely put
his wife body
in a plot of ground
about one foot square
unless of course he put her
in standing on end
and then he wouldnt
need a knife and saw
no my idea is she
scattered all over town
leg in the east river
oh stella please
no no no there
something in there
those flowers have been taken out
and put back in
maybe it the knife and saw
yeah
call lieutenant doyle
no let wait
let wait till it gets a little darker
and ill go over there and dig them up
youll go you wont dig anything up
and get your neck broken
no no weve
were not gonna call doyle until
i can produce mrs thorwald body
what weve got to do is find
a way to get into that apartment
he packing
uh-oh
here get me
a pencil
stella get me some note paper
it up here someplace
there it is
you did it thorwald
you did it
look out lisa
he coming
you never should have let her do it
if he ever
look look look
well thank heaven
that over
all right if i
have a drink
sure go ahead
there no doubt about it he leaving
it just a question of when
mind if i use that
portable keyhole
go ahead just as long as you tell me
what youre looking at
i wonder
wonder what
miss lonelyheart
just laid out something
that looks like rhodium
tri-eckonal capsules
you can tell
from here
ive handled enough of those red pills
to put everybody in hackensack
to sleep for the winter
well does she have
enough of them to
no it will make
the rest easy to
wasnt that close
what was his reaction i mean
when he looked at the note
well it wasnt the kind of an expression
that would get him a quick loan at the bank
jeff the handbag
suppose mrs thorwald
wedding ring
is among the jewelry
he has in that handbag
now during the phone conversation
he held up three rings
one with a diamond one with
a big stone of some sort
and then just
a plain gold band
and the last thing she would leave behind
would be a wedding ring
stella do you ever
leave yours at home
the only way anybody could get that ring
would be to chop off my finger
let go down and find out
what buried in the garden
why not ive always wanted
to meet mrs thorwald
what are you two talking about
you got a shovel
a shovel of course
i dont have a shovel
there probably
one in the basement
jeff if youre squeamish
just dont look
squeamish
im not squeamish
i just dont want you two to end up
like that dog ended up that all
oh you know miss fremont
he might just have something there
just hold on
here take this
no sense taking any
chances in this thing
here give me
the phone book
