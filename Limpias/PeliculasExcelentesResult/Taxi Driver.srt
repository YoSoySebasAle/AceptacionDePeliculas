yeah
we all work together

the thing is i drive a taxi at
night so it kind
of hard for me
to work in the day
then what exactly do you want
would you like to come have
some coffee and pie with me
why
why ill tell you why
yeah
i think youre a lonely person
i drive by a lot
and i see you here
i see a lot of
people around you
and i see these phones and all
this stuff on your desk
that means nothing
and when i came
inside and met you
i saw in your eyes and how
you carried yourself
that youre not a happy person
and i think you need something
and if you wanna call it a friend
you can call it a friend
youre gonna be my friend
yeah
what do you say
it a little hard standing
here and asking you so
five minutes that all just
outside right around here
im there to protect you
come on just take a little break
i have a break at 400
and if youre here
400 today

ill be here
im sure you will
all right 4 pm
right
outside in the front
yes
okay
oh my name is travis betsy
travis
i appreciate this betsy
may 26th 400 pm
i took betsy to charles coffee
shop on columbus circle
i had black coffee
and apple pie with
a slice of melted yellow cheese
i think that was a good selection
betsy had coffee and
a fruit salad dish
she couldve had
anything she wanted
fifteen thousand volunteers
in new york alone not bad
but the organisational problems
yeah i know what you mean
i got the same problems
i got to get organised
little things
like my apartment my possessions
one of these days
ill get organis-ised
you mean organised
organis-ised
organis-ised it a joke
o-r-g-a-n-e-z-i-e-s-d
you mean organis-ise
like those little
signs in offices that say think
do you like where you work
weve got some good people and i
think palantine
got a good chance
you know you have beautiful eyes
do you like the guy you work with
he okay
yeah i know but do you like him
he funny good at
his job he okay
though he does have
a few problems
i would say he has
quite a few problems
his energy seems to go
in the wrong places
when i walked in and i saw
you two sitting there
i could just tell that
there was no connection
whatsoever
and i felt when i walked in
there was something between us
there was an impulse that
we were both following
so that gave me the
right to talk to you
otherwise i never wouldve felt
that i had the right
to talk to you
i never wouldve had the
courage to talk to you
and with him i felt
there was nothing
when i walked in i knew i was
right did you feel that way
i wouldnt be here if i didnt
where are you from
upstate
that fellow i dont like him
not that i dont like him
i just think he silly
i dont think he respects you
i dont believe ive ever
met anyone quite like you
you wanna go to
a movie with me
i have to go back to work now
i dont mean now another time
sure you know what
you remind me of
what
that song
by kris kristofferson
who that
the songwriter
he a prophet
he a prophet and a pusher
partly truth partly fiction
a walking contradiction
you saying that about me
who else would i be talking about
im no pusher ive never pushed
no just the part about
the contradictions
you are that
i called betsy again
at her office
she said maybe wed
go to a movie
after work tomorrow
that my day off
at first she hesitated but i
called her again and she agreed
betsy betsy oh no
betsy what i forgot
to ask her last name
damn i got to remember
stuff like that
dont worry about anyone
committing themselves
until things start coming
in from california
listen i think we shouldve
waited for the limo
i dont mind the
cab but i mind
going to california
without the right
preparation thatll
get us in trouble
are you charles
palantine the candidate
yes i am
im a big supporter
i tell everybody
that comes in this
taxi they have to vote for you
why thank you
travis
im sure youll win everybody
i know gonna vote for you
i was gonna put one of your
stickers in my taxi
but the company said it
was against their policy
theyre a bunch of jerks
let me tell you i have
learnt more about america
from riding in taxicabs than in
all the limos in the country
oh yeah
that true
can i ask you something travis
sure
what is the one thing about this
country that bugs you the most
well i dont know i dont follow
political issues
that closely sir
oh well there must be something
well whatever it is he should
clean up this city here
because this city
here like an open
sewer it full
of filth and scum
sometimes i can hardly take it
whatever ever becomes the
president should just
really clean it up
know what i mean
sometimes i go out and i smell it
i get headaches it so bad
and they just like they
just never go away you know
i think that the
president should just
clean up this mess
he should flush
it right down the fucking toilet
well i think i know
what you mean travis
but it not gonna be easy
well have to make
radical changes
damn straight
here you go travis

what do you think
of your opponent
chances in the upcoming primary
mr goodman is a fine man
i would certainly if it
came to it prefer him
to our opponent in
the other party
i think that my programmes
are better defined than his
theyre more imaginative i have
a better chance of winning
it academic though he not
gonna win the primary i am
i see
well one more thing
id like to ask you
how do you feel your
campaign is going
when we came up with our
slogan we are the people
when i said let the people rule
i felt i was being somewhat
overly optimistic
i must tell you that i am more
optimistic now than ever before
the people are rising to the
demands that i have made on them
the people are beginning to rule
i feel it is a
groundswell i know
it will continue through
the primary and in miami
and i know it will rise
to an unprecedented
swell in november
that bitch goddamn ill
blow her brains out
ill kill her goddamn
it im gonna
get my hands on
her ill kill her

i could sell this gun to some
jungle bunny in harlem for $500
but i just deal high-quality
goods to the right people
how about that
this might be a little too
big for practical purposes
in which case for
you id recommend
38 snub-nosed
look at this
look at that that a
beautiful little gun
it nickel-plated
with a snub-nose
otherwise the same as
a service revolver
thatll stop anything that moves
the magnum they use that in
africa for killing elephants
that 38 that a funny gun
some of these guns are like toys
that 38 you go out and hammer
nails with it all day
come back and itll cut dead
centre on target every time
it got a really nice action
to it and a heck of a wallop
you interested in an automatic
it a colt 25 automatic
it a nice little gun
it a beautiful gun
holds six shots in the clip
one shot in the chamber
if youre dumb enough
to put a round there
here look at this
380 walther
holds eight shots in the clip
that a nice gun
that a beautiful little
gun look at that
during world war ii they used
this gun to replace the p 38
just given out to officers
aint that a little honey
how much for everything
all together
well only a jackass
would carry that
cannon in the streets like that
here a beautiful handmade
holster i had made in mexico
forty dollars
three-fifty for the magnum
250 for the 38
one and a quarter for the
25 50 for the 380

dear mr bickle
i cant say how happy mrs
steensma and i were
to hear that you are
well and recuperating
we tried to visit you
at the hospital
when we were in new
york to pick up iris
but you were still in a coma
there is no way we
can repay you
for returning our iris to us
we thought we had lost her
and now our lives are full again
needless to say
you are something of a hero
around this household
im sure you want
to know about iris
she back in school
and working hard
the transition has been
very hard for her
as you can well imagine
but we have taken steps to see
she has never cause
to run away again
in conclusion
mrs steensma and i would
like to again thank you
from the bottom of our hearts
unfortunately we cannot afford
to come to new york again
to thank you in person
or we surely would
but if you should ever
come to pittsburgh
you would find yourself a most
welcome guest in our home
our deepest thanks
