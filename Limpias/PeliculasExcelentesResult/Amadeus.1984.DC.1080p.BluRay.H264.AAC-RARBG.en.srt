signore we have
something special for you
something youre going to love
mmm is that good
signore believe me
this is the most delicious thing
i ever ate in my life
really you dont know
what youre miss--
all right that enough
open the door
signore if you dont
open this door
were gonna leave nothing
for you
and im never gonna come
see you again
good morning father
herr salieri
leave me alone
i cannot leave alone a soul in pain
do you know who i am
that makes no difference
all men are equal in god eyes
are they
offer me your confession
i can offer you god forgiveness
how well are you trained in music
i know a little
i studied it in my youth
where
here in vienna
oh then you must know this
i cant say that i do
what is it
it was a very popular tune in its day
i wrote it
here how about this
this one brought down the house
when we played it
well
i regret it is not too familiar
can you recall no melody of mine
i was the most famous composer
in europe
i wrote 40 operas alone
here
what about this one
yes i know that
that charming
im sorry i didnt know
you wrote that
i didnt
that was mozart
wolfgang
amadeus mozart
the man you accuse yourself
of killing
youve heard that
is it true
for god sake my son
if you have something to confess
do it now
give yourself some peace
he
was my idol
mozart
i cant think of a time
when i didnt know his name
i was playing games
when he was playing music
for kings and emperors
even the pope in rome
i admit i was jealous
when i heard the tales
they told about him
not of the brilliant little prodigy
but of his father
who had taught him everything
my father he did not care for music
when i told him
how i wished i could be
like mozart
he would say why do you want
to be a trained monkey
youd like me to drag you around
doing tricks like a circus freak
how could i tell him
what music meant to me
while my father
prayed earnestly to god
to protect commerce
i would offer up
secretly
the proudest prayer
a boy could think of
lord make me a great composer
let me celebrate your glory
through music
and be celebrated myself
make me famous through the world
make me immortal
after i die
let people speak my name
with love for what i wrote
in return
i will give you my chastity
my industry
my deepest humility
every hour of my life
amen
and do you know what happened
a miracle
francesco
my life changed forever
i knew god had arranged it all
that was obvious
one minute i was a frustrated boy
in an obscure little town
the next i was here
in vienna city of musicians
and emperor joseph
the musical king
in a few years i was his court
composer isnt that incredible
every night i sat with
the emperor of austria
playing duets with him
correcting the royal sight-reading
actually the man had no ear at all
but what did it matter
he adored my music
tell me
if you had been me
wouldnt you have thought
god had accepted your vow
and believe me i honored it
i was a model of virtue
i kept my hands off women
i worked hours every day
teaching students many for free
sitting on endless committees
to help poor musicians
work that was all my life
and it was wonderful
everybody liked me
i liked myself
until he came
he came to vienna to play
some of his music
at the residence
of the prince archbishop of salzburg
eagerly i went there to seek him out
that night
changed my life
as i wandered through the salon
i played a little game with myself
this man had written
his first concerto at the age of 4
his first symphony at 7
a full-scale opera at 2
did it show
is talent like that
written on the face
which one of them
could he be
mozart is not here
stop it
i am
stop it
i am stopping it
i am im stopping it slowly
there you see ive stopped
now were going back
no

here everything goes backwards
people walk and dance and sing
and even talk backwards
that stupid
why people fart backwards

tihs-ym-tae

tihs-ym-tae

ym my
my
tihs eat my shit
you filthy fiend
you filthy--
shh
my music
theyve started without me
that was mozart
that giggling dirty creature
id just seen crawling on the floor
i think that went well dont you
indeed
the viennese know good music
dont you think
certainly
your grace
ah mozart
why
why what sir
why do i have to be humiliated
in front of my guests
by one of my own servants
the more license i allow you
the more you take
if his grace is not satisfied
he can dismiss me
i wish you to return immediately
to salzburg
your father is waiting for you there
no your grace
i would prefer you dismissed me
it obvious i dont satisfy
i have no intention of dismissing you
you will remain in my service
and learn your place
on the page it looked
nothing
the beginning simple almost comic
just a pulse
bassoons basset horns
like a rusty squeezebox
and then suddenly
high above it
an oboe
a single note hanging there
unwavering
until
a clarinet took it over
sweetened it into a phrase
of such delight
this was no composition
by a performing monkey
this was a music i had never heard
filled with such longing
such unfulfillable longing
it seemed to me i was hearing
the voice of god
excuse me
but why
why would god choose an obscene child
to be his instrument
it was not to be believed
this piece had to be an accident
it had to be
it better be
how good is he this mozart
he remarkable majesty i heard an
extraordinary opera of his last month
idomeneo king of crete
that
a tiresome piece i heard it too
tiresome
a young man trying to impress
beyond his abilities
too much spice
too many notes
majesty
it was the most promising work
ive heard in years
then we should make
some effort to acquire him
we could use a good german composer
in vienna surely
im sure he could be tempted
with the right offer say
an opera in german
for our national theater
excellent sire
but not german i beg your majesty
italian is the proper language
for opera
all educated people agree on that
mm-hm
what do you think chamberlain
in my opinion it time
we had a piece in our own language
plain german for plain people
kapellmeister
majesty
i must agree with herr direttore
german is
scusate
too brute for singing
mm-hm
court composer
what do you think
i think it an interesting notion
to keep mozart in vienna
it should infuriate the archbishop
if that is your majesty
intention
you are cattivo court composer
i want to meet this young man
arrange a pleasant welcome for him
well there it is
grazie signore
this is a beautiful wig for you
it looks so marvelous and i love it
the other one
here is the other one
i think you will love it
here the third one so here we go
how do you like it
theyre all so beautiful
why dont i have three heads
this is funny
three heads
gentlemen
good morning
morning your majesty
what do you have for me today
your majesty herr mozart
yes what about him
he here
well there it is good
i hope you wont find it improper
but ive written a march in his honor
what a charming idea
court composer may i see
just a
just a trifle of course
may i try it
majesty
let have some fun
delightful court composer
may i play it when he comes in
you do me too much honor
bring in herr mozart
but slowly
i need a minute to practice
good continue
g majesty
excellent
good majesty
continue very good
very good majesty
tempo up
lightly then strongly
it a march majesty
again
bravo majesty
gentlemen please
a little less enthusiasm i beg you
mozart
majesty
no please it not a holy relic
you know we have met before
in this very room
you dont recall you were only 6
he was giving a delightful concert
as he got off the stool he fell
my sister antoinette helped him up
know what he did
he jumped into her arms and said
will you marry me yes or no
you know all these gentlemen
the baron van swieten
im a great admirer of yours
thank you
kapellmeister bonno
signore
my pleasure
the director of opera
count orsini-rosenberg
sir yes the honor is mine
absolutely
here is our
illustrious court composer
maestro salieri
at last such immense joy
i know your work well
you know i composed some variations
on a melody of yours
really which one
mio caro adone
im flattered
a funny tune
but it yielded good things
and now he has returned
the compliment
herr salieri composed
this little march for you
really
grazie signore
well there it is
down to business were going
to commission an opera from you
what do you say
majesty
did we vote in the end
for german or italian
sire if you remember
we did finally incline to italian
did we
i dont think it was really decided
your majesty
oh
german please let it be german
why so
because ive already found
the most wonderful libretto
have i seen it
i dont think you have herr direktor
it quite new
ill show it to you immediately
i think youd better
well
tell us about it
tell us the story
well it quite amusing majesty
it set--
the whole thing is set in a
yes where
in a harem majesty in a seraglio
you mean in turkey
yes exactly
then why especially
does it have to be in german
it doesnt especially it could be
in turkish if you really want
no my dear fellow the language
is not finally the point
do you really think that subject
is appropriate for a national theater
why not it charming
i mean i wont actually show
concubines exposing their
it not indecent
it highly moral majesty
it full of proper german virtues
excuse me majesty but what
do you think these could be
being a foreigner id love to learn
well tell him mozart
name us a german virtue
love sire
oh love
of course in italy
we know nothing about love
no i dont think you do
watching italian opera
all those male sopranos screeching
stupid fat couples rolling their eyes
about that not love it rubbish
majesty you choose the language
ill set it to the finest music
ever offered a monarch
well there it is
let it be german
this is yours
keep it
it already here in my head
what on one hearing only
i think so sire yes
show us
the rest is just the same isnt it
that doesnt really work does it
did you try
shouldnt it be a bit more
or this
this yes
better what do you think
all i ever wanted
was to sing to god
he gave me that longing
and then made me mute why
tell me that
if he didnt want me
to praise him with music
why implant the desire
like a lust in my body
and then deny me the talent
madame cavalieri is here
for her lesson sir
maestro
well
how do you like it
it turkish
my hairdresser said everything
this year going to be turkish
does he
what else did he tell you today
come come give me some gossip
well i heard you met herr mozart
news travels fast in vienna
and he been commissioned
to write an opera is it true
yes
is there a part in it for me
no
how do you know
do you know where it set my dear
where
in a harem
what that
a brothel
oh
come
let begin
what does he look like
mozart
you might be disappointed
why
looks and talent dont always
go together katerina
looks dont concern me maestro
only talent interests
a woman of taste
shall we continue
there she was
i dont know where they met
or how there she stood
on stage for all to see
showing off like
the greedy songbird she was
ten minutes of ghastly scales
arpeggios
whizzing up and down
like fireworks at a fairground
understand i was
in love with the girl
or at least in lust
and i swear to you
i never laid a finger on her
all the same i couldnt bear
to think of anyone else touching her
least of all the creature
brava madame
you are an ornament to our stage
your majesty
well herr mozart a good effort
well decidedly that
an excellent effort
you have shown us something
quite new tonight
it is new
it is isnt it sire
yes indeed
so then you liked it
you really liked it sire
well of course i did it very good
of course now and then
just now and then
it seemed a touch
what do you mean sire
well i mean occasionally
it seems to have
how shall one say
how shall one say direktor
too many notes majesty
exactly very well put
too many notes
i dont understand
there are just as many notes
as i required neither more nor less
my dear fellow there are in fact
only so many notes
the ear can hear in an evening
i think im right in saying that
arent i court composer
yes on the whole yes majesty
this is absurd
young man dont take it too hard
your work is ingenious
it quality work
and there are simply too many notes
just cut a few and itll be perfect
which few did you have in mind
wolfgang
wolfgang my dear
wolfgang
majesty this is frau weber
she my landlady
enchanted madame
sire such an honor
this is my dear daughter constanze
she the fiancée of herr mozart

how charming please
well

well
we havent exactly received
my father consent yet
not entirely not altogether

my advice is for you to marry
this charming young lady
and stay with us in vienna
you see
i told him that
but he wont listen to me
your majesty
you give such wonderful
such royal advice may i

on the floor
no she fine
oh im so relieved
dear mozart
my sincere congratulations
did you like it then
how could i not
it the best music
in vienna today dont you agree
she must be dazzling in bed

in that department
no other reason why
youd marry someone like that
come in
excuse me
wolfie mom isnt feeling very well
can we go home
yes
no no no
you cant take him away now
this is his night
wont you introduce us wolfgang
excuse us fräulein
good night signore
at that moment i knew
beyond any doubt
hed had her
the creature had had my darling girl
it was incomprehensible
what was god up to
was it possible i was being tested
was god expecting me
to offer forgiveness
in the face of every offense
no matter how painful
it very possible
but why him
why choose mozart
to teach me lessons in humility
my heart was filling up
with such hatred
for that little man
for the first time in my life
i began to know
really
violent thoughts
every day
sometimes for hours i would pray
lord
please
send him away
back to salzburg
for his sake
as well as mine
no i wont have him back
but your grace--
your son is an unprincipled
spoiled conceited brat
yes sir
that is the truth
but dont blame him
the fault is mine entirely
i was too indulgent with him
please your grace
give him one more chance
you have leave to try
god bless your grace
i thank your grace
i thank you
i write to you with
urgent news im coming to vienna
take no further steps
towards marriage until we meet
as you honor the father who has
devoted his life to yours
do as i bid and await my coming
i now join you
in the holy bonds of matrimony
those whom god hath joined together
let no man put asunder
beloved father
you say vienna is the musicians city
to conquer here is to conquer europe
with my wife i can do it
one day when im wealthy
youll live with us
and well be so happy
good morning
this is my niece princess elizabeth
your highness
she asked me to recommend
a music instructor
ive come up with an excellent idea
your majesty
it would be such a tremendous honor
i was thinking of herr mozart
what is your view
it an interesting idea
majesty but
yes
my concern is to protect you
from any hint of favoritism
mm-hm
favoritism
what is this
what is what
why must i submit samples of my work
to a committee to teach a girl
because his majesty wishes it
is the emperor angry with me
quite the contrary
then why not appoint me to the post
you are not
the only composer in vienna
no but im the best
mozart
a little modesty
might suit you better
who is on this committee
kapellmeister bonno count
orsini-rosenberg and salieri
naturally the italians
of course always the italians
theyre all musical idiots
and you want them to judge my music
young man
the issue is quite simple
if you want this position
you must submit your stuff
along with all your colleagues
must i
mm-hm
well i wont
how are we supposed to live
do you want me to beg on the streets
dont be stupid
all they want to see is your work
shit
what wrong with that
shut up just shut up
one royal pupil
and all of vienna will come flocking
theyll come anyway
no they wont
they love me here
i know how things work in this city
you know everything dont you
yes
excuse me sir
a lady insists on talking to you
who
she didnt say
but she says it urgent
excuse me my dear
your excellency
how can i help you
frau mozart
ive come on behalf of my husband
i brought samples of his work so he
can be considered for the appointment
how charming
but why did he not come himself
well he terribly busy sir
i understand
i will look at them the moment i can
it will be an honor
please give him my warmest regards
would it be too much trouble
to ask you to look at them now
while i wait
im afraid im not at leisure
this precise moment
leave them with me
i assure you they will be safe
i really cannot do that sir
you see he doesnt know im here
then he didnt send you
no sir this was my own idea
i see
sir were desperate
we really need this job
my husband spends far more
than he can ever earn
i dont mean that he lazy
because he works all day long
it just that he not practical
money simply slips through
his fingers it ridiculous
let me offer you some refreshment
do you know what these are
capezzoli di venere
nipples of venus
theyre roman chestnuts
in brandied sugar try one go on
theyre quite surprising
theyre wonderful
thank you very much your excellency
dont keep calling me that
keeps me at such a distance
i wasnt born a court composer
you know
im from a small town
just like your husband
are you sure you cant
leave this and come back again
it very tempting sir
but it impossible im afraid
hed be frantic
if he knew they were missing
you see theyre all originals
originals
yes sir he doesnt make copies
these
are originals
mm-hm
astounding
it was actually--
it was beyond belief
these were first and only
drafts of music
but they showed no corrections
of any kind not one
he had simply written down music
already finished in his head
page after page of it
as if he were just taking dictation
and music
finished as no music
is ever finished
displace one note
and there would be diminishment
displace one phrase
and the structure would fall
it was clear to me
that sound i had heard
in the archbishop palace
had been no accident
here again
was the very voice of god
i was staring through the cage
of those meticulous ink strokes
at an absolute beauty
is it not good
it is miraculous
yes he very proud of his work
so you will help us
i dine with the emperor
tomorrow evening
one word from me and the post is his
thank you your excellency
thank you
come back tonight
tonight
alone
what for
some service
deserves service in return
no
what do you mean
isnt it obvious
it a post all vienna seeks
if you wish it for your husband
come tonight
im a married woman sir
then dont
it up to you
and not to be vague
that is the price
there is no god of mercy father
just a god of torture
evening came
i sat there not knowing
whether she would return or not
i prayed as i had
never prayed before
dear god
enter me now
fill me with one piece of true music
one piece with your breath in it
so i know that you love me
show me one sign of your favor
and i will show mine to mozart
i will get him the royal position
enter me
please
please
yes
that lady is back sir
show her in
well
im here
my husband has gone to a concert
he didnt think i would enjoy it
well where shall we go
should we stay here
well
do you still want to look at these
or dont we need to bother anymore
suppose we dont really
show this woman out
stanzi
stanzi
what is it
what the matter tell me
tell me
i love you
i love you
from now on we are enemies
you and i
because you choose
for your instrument
a boastful lustful
smutty infantile boy
and give me for reward only the
ability to recognize the incarnation
because you are unjust
unfair
unkind
i will block you
i swear it
i will hinder and harm
your creature on earth
as far as i am able
i dont like to talk
against a fellow musician
of course not
i have to tell you
mozart is not entirely to be trusted
alone with young ladies
really
one of my own pupils
a very young singer
maria theresa paradis
told me she was
well
well what
molested majesty
twice in the course of
the same lesson
there is a herr mozart
waiting for you in the salon
whom did they choose
herr zummer
herr zummer
but the man a fool
he a total mediocrity
no no he has yet
to achieve mediocrity
i cant lose this post
i simply cant
excellency please
let go to the palace
you can talk to the emperor
and tell him that herr zummer
is an awful choice
he could do musical harm
to the princess
between us no one in the world
could do musical harm to the princess
look
i must have pupils
without pupils i cant manage
you dont mean
youre living in poverty
no but im broke
well how is this possible
i hear your concerts are
quite successful
theyre stupendously successful
you cant get a seat
but no one will hire me
they want to hear me play
but they wont let me teach
their daughters as if i was a fiend
seriously
is there any chance
you could manage a loan
only for six months
eight at the most
you expect your fortunes to change
in six or eight months
as a matter of fact i do
i am working on something that will
explode like a bomb all over europe
ill be the richest man in vienna
ill pay you back double anything

patriotic feelings of some kind
two thou--
two hundred florins

really i cant say
i dont think you should become known
in vienna as a debtor mozart
however
i know a distinguished
gentleman i can recommend and
he has a daughter
quiet quiet
herr mozart
welcome pay no attention
theyre impossible
i treat them just like
my own children
which of them do you wish me to teach
that funny
youre a funny fellow
this is the instrument
i hope it to your satisfaction
of course itll be
to his satisfaction
come were going to listen
to some music come
good boy
now
please play me something
just to give me an idea
anything will do
just go ahead
just as if we werent here
part of music getting used
to an audience right herr mozart
perhaps it would be better
if we were left alone
were both a little shy
play
i said play
michael please
perhaps if i play first
it might encourage the fräulein
why dont you let me try
stop it stop
he always howls when he hears music
weve got to break him of that habit
weve got to break them
of their habit

youre a good girl

thank you sir
i think i found out
about the money sir
yes what
he kept seven snuffboxes in here
i could swear they were all gold
and now look
there only one left
where does he work
in there sir
gentlemen ive just
heard some news
that may interest you
what
mozart is writing a new opera
an italian opera
italian
that not all
he has chosen for his subject figaro
the marriage of figaro
he setting that play to music
yes
what is this marriage of figaro
it a french play kapellmeister
it has been banned by the emperor
youre absolutely sure
herr mozart
gentlemen sit down
mozart
are you aware that i have declared
the french play figaro
unsuitable for our theater
yes sire
yet we hear youre making an
opera from it is this true
who told you this majesty
it is not your place to ask questions
is it true
yes i
i admit it is
would you tell me why
majesty it is only a comedy
what you think is scarcely the point
it what his majesty thinks
that counts
but your majesty--
mozart
i am a tolerant man
i do not censor things lightly
when i do i have good reason
figaro is a bad play
it stirs up hatred between classes
in france it has caused
only bitterness
my sister antoinette is beginning
to be frightened of her own people
i swear there nothing
like that in the piece
ive taken out everything that could
give offense i hate politics
im afraid youre rather innocent
in these dangerous times i cannot
afford to provoke our people
simply over a theater piece
majesty this is just a frolic
a piece about love
love again
and it new
it entirely new
the people will go mad for it
i have scenes
the end of act ii for example
it starts as a duet
a husband and wife quarreling
suddenly the scheming maid comes in
it a very funny situation
duet turns into trio
then the husband valet comes in
trio turns into quartet
then a gardener
quartet becomes quintet
and so on on and on
sextet septet octet
how long do you think
i can sustain that
i have no idea
guess
guess your majesty
imagine the longest time
it could be sustained then double it
well
six
seven minutes
eight minutes
twenty sire twenty minutes
twenty minutes of continuous music
no recitatives
sire only opera can do this
in a play if more than one person
speaks at once
it just noise
but with opera with music
you can have 20 individuals
all talking at the same time
it not noise
it a perfect harmony
mozart music is not the issue here
no one doubts your talent it your
literary judgment that in question
even without the politics
it would remain a vulgar farce
why waste your spirit on such rubbish
surely you can choose more
elevated themes
elevated
what does that mean elevated
i am fed to the teeth with these
elevated things old dead legends
why must we go on forever
writing of gods and legends
because they do
they go on forever
the eternal in us
opera is here to ennoble us mozart
you and me
just the same as his majesty
bello veramente
bello bello bello
come on now be honest
youd rather listen to your hairdresser
than hercules horatius or orpheus
people so lofty they sound
as if they shit marble
what
govern your tongue mozart
how dare you
forgive me majesty
im a vulgar man
but i assure you my music is not
you are passionate mozart
but you do not persuade
sire the whole opera is finished
do you know how much work
went into it
his majesty has been
more than patient signore
how can i persuade if i cant show it
that will do herr mozart
just let me tell you how it begins
may i just do that majesty
show you how it begins just that
please
look
there a servant on his knees
do you know why
not from oppression
he measuring a space
do you know what for
his bed his wedding bed
to see if it will fit
cinque
late
dieci
late
on the beat
venti
good
trenta
yes
early
well mozart is already rehearsing
in that case gentlemen i think
i think we should help
mozart all we can
and protect him against
the emperor anger
what anger
about the ballet
what ballet
excuse me
but didnt his majesty specifically
forbid the ballet in his opera
mozart
herr mozart
yes
a word with you
certainly herr direktor
now herr mozart
five minutes please
five minutes
yes
do you not know that his majesty has
expressly forbidden ballet in operas
it not a ballet it a dance
exactly a dance
surely his majesty didnt mean
no dancing when it in the story
it dangerous to interpret his
edicts give me your score please
thank you
what are you doing herr direktor
taking out what you should
never have put in
please please
i have no one else to turn to
what is it
it unbelievable
the direktor has torn up
a huge section of my music
they say i have to rewrite the opera
but it perfect as it is
i cant
rewrite what perfect
please
cant you talk to him
please
why bother
he no friend of yours
i could kill him
i mean really kill him
i threw the entire score into
the fire he made me so angry
you burned the score
no my wife took it out in time
thank god
it unfair that a man like that
should have power over our work
but there are those
who have power over him
i think ill take this up
with the emperor
excellency
would you
with all my heart mozart
thank you
please herr mozart
please it not a holy relic
i dont need to tell you i said
nothing whatever to the emperor
i went to the theater to tell
mozart something anything
when suddenly
in the middle of the third act
to my astonishment the emperor
who never attended rehearsals
suddenly appeared
what is this
i dont understand
is it modern
majesty
the herr direktor
he has removed un balletto
that would have occurred
at this place
why
it is your regulation sire
no ballet in your opera
salieri
do you like this
it not a question
of liking majesty
your own law decrees it im afraid
well look at them
no this is nonsense
let me see the scene with the music
but sire
oblige me
yes majesty
can we see the scene
with the music please
certainly certainly herr direktor
bring the palace set back in please
the restored third act
was bold brilliant
the fourth
was astounding
i saw a woman
disguised in her maid clothes
hear her husband speak the first
tender words he has
offered her in years
simply because he thinks
she is someone else
i heard the music of true forgiveness
filling the theater
conferring on all who sat there
perfect absolution
god was singing through
this little man
to all the world
unstoppable
making my defeat more bitter
with every passing bar
and then do you know what happened
a miracle
with that yawn
i saw my defeat
turn into a victory
mozart was lucky
the emperor yawned only once
three yawns
and the opera
would fail the same night
two yawns within a week at most
with one yawn the composer
could still get
nine performances nine
that all it had withdrawn
i know i know
it outrageous
still if the public
doesnt like one work
one has to accept
the fact gracefully
but what is it that they dont like
i can speak for the emperor
you make too many demands
on the royal ear
the poor man cant concentrate for
more than an hour you gave him four
what did you think of it yourself
did you like it at all
i thought it was marvelous
of course
it the best opera yet written
i know it
why didnt they come
i think you overestimate
our dear viennese friend
you didnt give them a bang
at the end of songs
to let them know when to clap
i know i know
maybe you should give me
some lessons in that
i wouldnt presume
nevertheless
at the risk of imposing
id like you to see my new piece
it would be an honor for me
no the honor would be all mine
grazie wolfgang
grazie a lei signor antonio
i believe
i believe
it is the best opera
yet written my friends
salieri
you are the brightest star
in the musical firmament
you do honor to vienna and to me
herr mozart
it was good of you to come
how could i not
bravo maestro
did my work please you
i never knew that music
like that was possible
you flatter me
no no
one hears such sounds
salieri
everybody here and weve got
guests bravo ive got some more
you remember my good
friend schikaneder come in
dont be shy
this is a very nice girl and this--
wolfie
yes my love
these gentlemen are from salzburg
salzburg
we were just talking about salzburg
wolfie
your father is dead
so rose the dreadful ghost
from his next and blackest opera
there on the stage
stood the figure of a dead commander
i knew
only i understood
that the horrifying apparition
was leopold
raised from the dead
wolfgang had actually
summoned up his own father
to accuse his son
before all the world
it was
terrifying and wonderful to watch
and now
the madness began in me
the madness of a man
splitting in half
through my influence i saw to it
don giovanni was played
only five times in vienna
but in secret
i went to every one of those five
worshiping sound
i alone seemed to hear
and as i stood there
understanding how
that bitter old man was
still possessing his poor son
even from beyond the grave
i began to see a way
a terrible way
i could finally triumph
over god
herr mozart
i have come to commission
work from you
what work
a mass for the dead
what dead
who is dead
a man who deserved a requiem mass
and never got one
who are you
i am only a messenger
do you accept
you will be well paid
do you accept
work fast
and be sure tell no one what you do
you will see me again soon
wolfie
my plan was so simple
that it terrified me
first i must get the death mass
and then
i must achieve his death
what
his funeral
imagine it
the cathedral
all vienna sitting there
his coffin
mozart little coffin in the middle
and then
in that silence
music
a divine music
bursts out over them all
a great mass of death
requiem mass for wolfgang mozart
composed by his devoted friend
antonio salieri
what sublimity
what depth
what passion in the music
salieri has been touched
by god at last
and god forced to listen
powerless to stop it
i for once in the end
laughing at him
the only thing that worried me
was the actual killing
how does one do that
how does one kill a man
it one thing
to dream about it
very different when you
when you have to do it
with your own hands
come in
don giovanni
ive come to dinner
dinner are you mad
im a nobleman
i only ever dine
with people of my own height
stop it
be careful
be careful
hold tight
im a famous
horseman
and were a famous horsy
give me a hoof my darling
and ill give you my heart
take me to your stable
and nevermore well part
kill me
kill me
were going to make a soprano stew
were going to make a soprano stew
and when you make a soprano stew
shut up
im sick to death of that tune
give me some hay my darling
and ill give you my heart
leporello some hay
we hope
youre contented
with what
weve presented
and love our dove of peace
and love
our dove of peace
so
what did you think
it was wonderful
he liked the little people
it all in good fun
i liked the horse
i tell you if you played
don giovanni here
you wouldve had
a wonderful success
you belong here
not at the snobby court
you could do anything you like
the more fantastic the better
fantasy
you write a proper part for me
a couple of catchy songs
i guarantee you a triumph deluxe
what do you say
how much will you pay him
ah
well i see you brought
your manager with you
well madame
how about half the receipts
half the receipts
stanzi

how much will you pay him now
down payment
down payment

whoops i have to go
stay here youll enjoy this next one
you wont do this
why not half the house
when
we need money now he pays
you now or you dont do it
i dont trust that man
i dont like what he did
with your opera it was common

i want it here in my hand
ill put it here in your hand
shut up
you wont put a thing in my hand
until i see some money
it embarrassing cant you think of
anyone who can do something for him
im afraid mozart
is a lost cause baron
he has succeeded in alienating
practically the whole of vienna
he never pays his debts
i cant think of anyone
to whom id dare recommend him
herr mozart what a surprise
what can i do for you
is my pupil still interested
in learning the art of music
your pupil is married
and living in mannheim young man
really
perhaps your dear wife might care
to profit from my instruction
what is it mozart
what the matter with you
well
since it appears no one
is eager to hire my services
could you favor me
with a little money instead
what for
if a man cannot earn he must borrow
that hardly the way to go about it
you are right sir you are right
but you see i am endowed
with talent and you with money
if i offer mine
you should offer yours
im sorry no
please

your merciful god
he destroyed his own beloved
rather than let a mediocrity
share in the smallest part
of his glory
he killed mozart
and kept me alive to torture
thirty-two years of torture
thirty-two years of slowly
watching myself become extinct
my music
growing fainter
all the time fainter
till no one plays it at all
and his
good morning professor
time for the water closet
then we have your favorite breakfast
sugar rolls he loves those
fresh sugar rolls
i will speak for you father
i speak for
all mediocrities in the world
i am their champion
i am their patron saint
mediocrities everywhere
i absolve you
i absolve you
i absolve you
i absolve you
i absolve you all
