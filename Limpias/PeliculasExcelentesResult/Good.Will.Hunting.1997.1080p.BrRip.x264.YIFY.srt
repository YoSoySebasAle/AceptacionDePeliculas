grown considerably
well by no stretch
of my imagination
do i believe youve all come
here to hear me lecture
rather to ascertain
the identity
of the mystery math magician
so without further
adieu come forward
silent rogue and
receive thy prize
well im sorry to disappoint
my spectators but
it seems there will be
no unmasking here today
however uh my colleagues
and i have conferred
and there is a problem
on the board right now
that took us more than
two years to prove
so let this be said
the gauntlet has
been thrown down
but the faculty have answered
and answered with vigour
hey when the arraignment
next week

just history
it must have been a
survey course then
-yeah it was it was surveys
-right
you should check it out
it a good course
itd be a good class
howd you like that course
you know frankly
i found that class you

elementary
-you know i dont doubt that it was
-yeah

it was just between
recess and lunch
clark why dont you go away

im just havin fun with my new friend
that all
are we gonna have a problem
no no no no there
no problem here
i was just hoping you
might give me some insight
into the evolution of the market
economy in the southern colonies
my contention is that prior
to the revolutionary war
the economic
modalities especially
in the southern colonies
could most aptly be
characterized as
-agrarian pre-capitalist
-let me tell you somethin
of course that
your contention
youre a first-year
grad student
you just got finished readin
some marxian historian
pete garrison probably
youre gonna be convinced
of that till next month
when you get to james lemon
then youre gonna
be talkin about
how the economies of
virginia and pennsylvania
were entrepreneurial and
capitalist way back in 740
that gonna last
until next year
youre gonna be in here
regurgitatin gordon wood
talkin about you know
the pre-revolutionary utopia
and the capital-forming effects
of military mobilization
well as a matter
of fact i wont
because wood drastically
underestimates the impact of
wood drastically underestimates the
impact of social distinctions
predicated upon wealth
especially inherited wealth
you got that from vickers work
in essex county page 98 right
i read that too
were you gonna plagiarize
the whole thing for us
do you have any thoughts
of your own on this matter
or is that your thing
you come into a bar
you read some obscure passage
then pretend pawn
it off as your own
as your own idea just
to impress some girls
embarrass my friend
see the sad thing about a
guy like you is in 50 years
youre gonna start doin
some thinkin on your own
youre gonna come
up with the fact
that there are two
certainties in life
one dont do that
and two you dropped 50 grand
on a fuckin education
you couldve got for $50 in late
charges at the public library
yeah but i will have a degree
and youll be
servin my kids fries
at a drive through on
our way to a skiing trip
maybe
but at least i
wont be unoriginal
if you have a problem with that
we could step outside
we could figure it out
no man there no problem
it cool
-it cool
-yeah
cool
damn right it cool
how do you like me now

the government
if that act is deemed a
defence against tyranny
a defence of liberty

pulpit 887 said
-887 this is the 20th century

i am afforded the right to
speak in my own defence sir
by the constitution
of the united states

ive spoken to the judge
and he agreed to release you
under my supervision
-really
-yeah
-under two conditions
-what are those
first condition is that you
meet with me every week
what for
go over the proof
youre working on
get into some
more advanced
combinatorial mathematics
finite math
sounds like a real hoot
and the second
condition is that
that you see a therapist
im responsible to submit
reports on those meetings
if you fail
to meet with any of
those conditions
you will have to serve time
all right ill do the math
but im not gonna meet
with any fuckin therapist
it better than spending
that time in jail isnt it
i read your book and mike
was havin the same problems
that chad
the stockbroker was havin
absolutely right
right on the button
good for you will very nice
thank you
will
the pressures and
im not judging them
im not labelling them
but they are destroying
your potential
no more shenanigans
no more tomfoolery
no more ballyhoo
youre right
god i know
youre not gonna get off that easily
come on will
a bit more
well i mean i do

a problem with it
i dont care if you
putt from the rough
what are you
putting from the rough
what on earth are

a difficult theorem
could be like a symphony
it very erotic
you go somewhere else
i cant handle this
-wow
-thank you henry
ah henry
hi gerry
you know something
i cant do this pro

i called mel weintraub
this morning to see
oh what the use
what do you want to do
-well there someone
-who is he
he used to be my uh
my room-mate in college
trust
very important
in a relationship it also very
important in a clinical situation
why is trust the most
important thing
in making a breakthrough
with a client
maureen stop the oral fixation
for a moment and join us
vinnie
um
because uh
trust is uh
trust is life
wow
that very deep
thank you vinnie
next time get the
notes from your brother
if a patient doesnt feel
safe enough trust you
then they wont be
honest with you
then there really no point
for them being in therapy
i mean hey if they
dont trust you
youre never gonna get
them to sleep with you
that should be the goal
of any good therapist
nail em while
theyre vulnerable
that my motto
oh good everyone back
welcome back everybody

hut somewhere in india
he had no formal education
-he had no access to any scientific work
-coffee
-you sir
-just a little
but he came across
this old math book
and from the simple text
he was able to
extrapolate theories
that had baffled
mathematicians for years
yes continued fractions
he wrote uh
well he mailed it to
hardy at cambridge
yeah cambridge yeah
and hardy immediately recognized
the brilliance of his work
and brought him over to england
and then they worked
together for years
creating some of the most
exciting math theory ever done
this this ramanujan
his his genius was
unparalleled sean
well this boy just like that
but he he
a bit defensive
i need someone who can
get through to him
like me

i think for me

i know youve been
thinking about it
-oh no i havent
-yes you have
no i really havent
yes you have youre hoping
to get good night kiss

i was hopin to get
a good night laid
but ill settle for
like a kiss you know
-how very noble of you
-thank you
no i was i was
hopin for a kiss
well why dont we just
get it out of the way now
-right now
-yeah
come on
i think i got some
of your pickle
you again huh
come with me
so what this
a taster choice
moment between guys
this is really nice
you got a thing for swans
is this like a fetish
is it something like
maybe we need to
devote some time to
thought about what you
said to me the other day
about my painting
stayed up half the
night thinking about it
something occurred to me
i fell into a deep
peaceful sleep
and havent thought
about you since
you know what occurred to me
no
youre just a kid
you dont have the faintest
idea what youre talking about
why thank you
it all right
youve never been out of boston
nope
so if i asked you about art
youd probably
give me the skinny
on every art book ever written
michelangelo
you know a lot about him
life work
political aspirations
him and the pope
sexual orientation
the whole works right
i bet you cant tell me
what it smells like
in the sistine chapel
you never actually stood there
and looked up at that
beautiful ceiling
seeing that
if i ask you about women
youll probably give me a syllabus
of your personal favourites
you may have even
been laid a few times
but you cant tell
me what it feels like
to wake up next to a woman
and feel truly happy
youre a tough kid
i ask you about
war youd probably
throw shakespeare at me right
once more into the
breach dear friends
but youve never been near one
youve never held your best
friend head in your lap
and watch him gasp his last
breath lookin to you for help
if i asked you about love
youd probably
quote me a sonnet
but youve never
looked at a woman
and been totally vulnerable
known someone that could
level you with her eyes
feelin like god put an
angel on earth just for you
who could rescue you
from the depths of hell
and you wouldnt know what
it like to be her angel
to have that love for
her be there forever
through anything
through cancer
and you wouldnt
know about sleepin
sittin up in a hospital room
for two months
holding her hand
because the doctors
could see in your eyes
that the terms visiting
hours dont apply to you
you dont know about real loss
cause that only
occurs when you love
something more than
you love yourself
i doubt youve ever dared
to love anybody that much
i look at you
i dont see an
intelligent confident man
i see a cocky
scared shitless kid
but youre a genius will
no one denies that
no one could possibly
understand the depths of you
but you presume
to know everything
about me because you
saw a painting of mine
you ripped my
fuckin life apart
youre an orphan right
do you think id
know the first thing
about how hard your
life has been
how you feel who you are
because i read oliver twist
does that encapsulate you
personally
i dont give a shit about all
that because you know what
i cant learn
anything from you
i cant read in
some fuckin book
unless you wanna talk about you
who you are
and im fascinated
im in
but you dont wanna do
that do you sport
youre terrified of
what you might say
your move chief
hello
hello
hello
professor valenti are
you calling me again
freak
-oh god
-christ who did you call
no one i forgot the number
you fuckin retarded
you went all the way
out there in the rain
and you didnt bring the number
no it was your
mother 900 number
i just ran out of quarters
why dont we get off on mothers
i just got off yours
that pretty funny morgan
that a fuckin nickel bitch
keep antagonizing me
watch what happens
all right then morgan
-watch what happens
-all right then morgan
watch what happens
keep fuckin with me
no smoking
what do you mean
he didnt talk
you were in there for an hour
he just sat there
counting the seconds
until the session was over
pretty impressive actually
why would he do that
to prove to me he doesnt
have to talk to me
if he doesnt want to
what is this some
kind of staring contest
between two kids from
the old neighbourhood
yeah it is
and i cant talk first
we know your theory alexander
but the boy found a
simple geometrical picture
a tree structure wont work
look now he joining
the two vertices
but i can do the sum
it how you group
the terms alexander
but gerry if we do the
whole thing this way then
hey look look
i wrote it down
it simpler this way
sometimes people get lucky
youre a brilliant man
you know i was on
this plane once
and im sittin there and
the captain gets on he
does his whole you know
well be cruisin
at 35000 feet
but then he puts the mike down
he forgets to turn it off
so he turns to the copilot
he like you know
all i could use right
now is a fuckin
blow job and a cup of coffee
so the stewardess
fuckin goes bombin
up from the back of the plane
to tell him the
microphone still on
this guy in the back
of the plane like
hey hon dont
forget the coffee
you ever been on a plane
no but it a fuckin joke
it works better if i tell
it in the first person
yeah it does
i have been laid you know
really
good for you
big time
big time huh
i went on a date last week
-howd it go
-it was good
goin out again
i dont know
why not
havent called her
christ youre an amateur
-i know what im doin
-oh yeah
dont worry about me
i know what im doin
yeah but this girl was
like you know beautiful
she smart she fun
she different from most
of the girls ive been with
so call her up romeo
why so i can realize
she not that smart
that she fuckin boring
you know i mean you dont
this girl like
fuckin perfect right now
i dont wanna ruin that
maybe youre perfect right now
maybe you dont wanna ruin that
but i think that a
super philosophy will
that way you can go
through your entire life
without ever having to
really know anybody
my wife used to fart
when she was nervous
she had all sorts of
wonderful idiosyncrasies
you know she used
to fart in her sleep
just thought id
share that with you
one night it was so
loud it woke the dog up
she woke up and gone
like was that you
i said yeah i didnt
have the heart to tell her
oh god
-she woke herself up
-yes
oh christ
but will she
been dead two years
and that the shit i remember
it wonderful stuff you know
little things like that
yeah but those are the
things i miss the most
those little idiosyncrasies
that only i knew about
that what made her my wife
boy and she had
the goods on me too
she knew all my
little peccadilloes
people call these
things imperfections
but theyre not
that the good stuff
and then we get to choose
who we let into our
weird little worlds
youre not perfect sport
and let me save
you the suspense
this girl you met
she isnt perfect either
but the question
is whether or not
youre perfect for each other
that the whole deal
that what intimacy
is all about
now you can know everything
in the world sport
but the only way youre
findin out that one
is by givin it a shot
you certainly wont learn
from an old fucker like me
even if i did know i wouldnt
tell a pissant like you
yeah why not
you told me every other fuckin thing
jesus christ
fuckin talk more than any
shrink i ever seen in my life
i teach the shit i didnt
say i knew how to do it
yeah
you ever think about
gettin remarried
my wife dead
hence the word remarried
she dead
yeah well i think that
a super philosophy sean
i mean that way
you can actually
go through the rest
of your life
without ever really
knowing anybody
time up
-hold it open
-okay
thanks
g minor seventh
saddest of all chords

you ever hear of gerald lambeau
in 905 there were
hundreds of professors
renown for their
study of the universe
but it was a 26-year-old
swiss patent clerk
doing physics in his spare
time who changed the world
can you imagine if einstein
would have given that up
just to get drunk with his
buddies in vienna every night
we all would have
lost something
tim would never
have heard of him
pretty dramatic gerry
no it isnt sean
this boy has that gift
he just doesnt
got the direction
but we can give that to him
hey gerry
in the 960s there
was a young man
graduated from
university of michigan
did some brilliant
work in mathematics
specifically bounded
harmonic functions
then he went on to berkeley
he was assistant professor
showed amazing potential
then he moved to montana and
he blew the competition away

it is actually important

-it really important
-all right
-to me okay
all right
why dont we just
hang out here all day
yes why dont we
all right mr nosey parker
seeing as youre intent
on breaking my balls
let me ask you a question
all right
do you have a
photographic memory
i dont know i just kind
of remember you know
i mean how do you
remember your phone number
you just do
have you studied
organic chemistry
a little bit
oh just for fun
yeah for kicks
yeah it so much fun
studying organic chemistry
are you mad
have you completely
lost your mind
nobody studies it for fun
it not a necessity
especially for someone like you
-someone like me
-yeah
someone who divides their
time fairly evenly
between batting cages and bars
i would hardly say
it was a necessity
you know there are very
smart people here at harvard
even they have to study
because this is really hard
and yet
you do it so easily
i dont understand
i dont understand
how your mind works
did you play the piano
i want to talk about this
no im trying to explain it to you
do you play the piano
yeah a bit
all right so when you look at a
piano you see mozart
i see chopsticks
all right well
beethoven okay
he looked at a piano
and it just made sense to him
he could just play
so what are you saying
you play the piano
not a lick i look at a piano
i see a bunch of keys three
pedals and a box of wood
but beethoven mozart
they saw it they
could just play
i couldnt paint you a picture
i probably cant hit
the ball out of fenway
and i cant play the piano
but you can do my o-chem
paper in under an hour
right well i mean when
it came to stuff like that
i could always just play
that the best
i can explain it
come here
i have to tell you something
i have to tell you something
well
it not fair
what not fair what
ive been here for four years
and ive only just found you
well you found me
are you awake
no
yes you are
what
i want you to come to
california with me

oh yeah
yeah but how do you know
i dont know
i just know
yeah but how do you know
i know because
i feel it
because that a really
serious thing youre saying
i i know
you could be in
california next week
and you might find out something
about me you dont like
maybe you wish you
hadnt said that
but you know it such a serious
thing you cant take it back
now im stuck in california
with someone that doesnt
really want to be with me
just wish they had a take-back
a what
what a take-back
i dont want a take-back
i just want you to come
to california with me
well i cant go to
california with you so

im not sayin i dont love you
then why
why wont you come
what are you so scared of

world where no one challenges you
and youre scared shit
just to do anything that
dont tell me about my world
dont tell me about my world
i mean you just want to have
your little fling
with the guy from the
other side of town
then youre gonna
go off to stanford
youre gonna marry
some rich prick
who your parents
will approve of
and just sit around with the
other trust fund babies
and talk about how you
went slummin too once
why are you saying this
what is your obsession
with this money
my father died when i was 3
and i inherited this money
you dont think
every day i wake up
and i wish i could give it back
that i would give
it back in a second
if it meant i could have
one more day with him
but i cant
and that my life
and i deal with it
so dont put your shit on me
when youre the
one that afraid
im afraid what am i afraid of
what the fuck am i afraid of
youre afraid of me
youre afraid that i
wont love you back
you know what im afraid too
but fuck it i want
to give it a shot
at least im honest with you
im not honest with you
no what about your 2 brothers
all right
no youre not going
youre not leaving
what do you want to know
that i dont have 2 brothers
that im a fuckin orphan
-you dont want to hear that
-i didnt know that
you dont want to hear
that i got fuckin
cigarettes put out on me
when i was a little kid
-i didnt know that
-that this isnt fuckin surgery
the mother fucker stabbed me
you dont want to hear
that shit skylar

that you dont love me
because if you say that
then i wont call you
and i wont be in your life
i dont love you
most people never get to see
how brilliant they can be
they dont find teachers
that believe in them
they get convinced
theyre stupid
i hope you appreciate
what he doing
because ive seen how much
he enjoys working with you
not against you
hello will
tom can you get us some coffee
sure
now let see
good
this is correct
i see you used maclaurin here
yeah i dont know what
you call it but
this cant be right
this would be very embarrassing
-did you ever consider
-im pretty sure it right
hey look
can we do this at sean office
from now on because i
got to knock off
work to come here
and the commute is killin me
-yeah sure
-did you think of the possibility
-that right
it right
just take it home with you
what happened at
the mcneil meeting
i couldnt go i had a date
so i sent my chief negotiator
on your own time you can
do whatever you like will
but when i set up a meeting
with my associates
and you dont show up
it reflects poorly on me
-then dont set up any more meetings
-i wont
ill cancel em
ill give you a job myself
i just wanted you to
see what was out there
maybe i dont want
to spend the rest
of my fuckin life
explainin shit to people
i think you could show
me some appreciation
a little appreciation
do you know how
easy this is for me
do you have any fuckin
idea how easy this is
this is a fuckin joke
im sorry you cant do this
i really am
because i wouldnt have
to fuckin sit here
and watch you fumble
around and fuck it up
then youd have more
time to sit around
and get drunk
instead wouldnt you
youre right
this is probably a
total waste of my time
youre right will
i cant do this proof
but you can and when it comes
to that it only about
just a handful of
people in the world
who can tell the difference
between you and me
-but im one of them
-sorry
yeah so am i
most days i wish
i never met you
because then i could
sleep at night
i didnt have to walk
around with the knowledge
that there was someone
like you out there
i didnt have to watch
you throw it all away
bill hold it
did you hear that
morgan
if youre watchin pornos
in my mom room again
im gonna give you
a fuckin beatin
what up fellas
morgan why dont you jerk
off in your own fuckin house
that fuckin filthy
i dont have a vcr
in my house
come on not in my glove
i didnt use the glove
that my little league glove
what do you want me to do
i mean what wrong with you
youll hump a baseball glove
i just used it for clean-up
stop jerkin off in
my mother room
is there another vcr
in the house
it just sad bro
so why do you
think i should work
for the national
security agency
well youd be working
on the cutting edge
youd be exposed to
the kind of technology
you wouldnt see anywhere else
because weve classified it
super-string theory chaos math
-advanced algorithms
-code breaking
that one aspect of what we do
oh come on that
is what you do
you guys handle 80% of
the intelligence workload
youre seven times
the size of the cia
we dont like to brag
about that will
but youre exactly right
so the way i see it
the question isnt
why should you work
for the nsa
the question is
why shouldnt you
why shouldnt i
work for the nsa
that a tough one
but ill take a shot
say im workin at the nsa
and somebody puts
a code on my desk
something no one else can break
maybe i take a shot at
it and maybe i break it
im real happy with myself
because i did my job well
but maybe that code
was the location
of some rebel army in north
africa or middle east
once they have that location
they bomb the village where
the rebels are hidin
fifteen hundred people
that i never met
never had no problem
with get killed
now the politicians are saying
end in the marines
to secure the area
cause they dont give a shit
it wont be their kid
over there gettin shot
just like it wasnt them
when their number got called
cause they were in
the national guard
itll be some kid from
southie over there
takin shrapnel in the ass
he comes back to find the
plant he used to work at
got exported to the
country he got back from
and the guy who put the shrapnel
in his ass got his old job
cause hell work for 5 cents
a day and no bathroom breaks
meanwhile he realizes
the only reason
he was over there in
the first place
was so we could
install a government
that would sell us
oil at a good price
of course the oil
companies used a skirmish
over there to scare up
domestic oil prices
a cute little ancillary
benefit for them
but it aint helpin my
buddy at 250 a gallon
theyre takin their sweet time
bringin the oil of course
maybe they even took the liberty
to hire an alcoholic skipper
who likes to drink martinis
and fuckin play slalom
with the icebergs
it aint too long till he
hits one spills the oil
and kills all the sea life
in the north atlantic
so now my buddy out of work
he cant afford to drive
so he walkin to the
fuckin job interviews
which sucks because
the shrapnel in his ass
is givin him
chronic haemorrhoids
meanwhile he starvin
cause every time he tries
to get a bite to eat
the only blue plate
special theyre servin
is north atlantic scrod
with quaker state
so what did i think
im holdin out for
somethin better
i figure fuck it
while im at it why
not just shoot my buddy
take his job give it
to his sworn enemy
hike up gas prices bomb a
village club a baby seal
hit the hash pipe and
join the national guard
i can be elected president
you feel like
youre alone will
what
do you have a soul mate
do i have a define that
somebody who challenges you
uh chuckie
no chuckie family hed lie
down in fuckin traffic for you
im talking about someone
who opens up things for you
touches your soul
-i got i got
-who

that great theyre all dead
not to me theyre not
you dont have a lot
of dialogue with them
you cant give
back to them will
not without some serious
smelling salts and a heater
that what im saying
youll never have that kind
of relationship in a world
where youre always afraid
to take the first step
because all you see is
every negative thing
ten miles down the road
you gonna take the
professor side on this
dont give me a line of shit
no
i didnt want the job
it not about the job
i dont care if you
work for the government
but you can do
anything you want
you are bound by nothing
what are you passionate about

entire life layin brick

and that honourable
im sure that why
you took that job
i mean for the honour of it
i just have a little
question here
you could be a janitor anywhere
why did you work at
the most prestigious
technical college in
the whole fuckin world
why did you sneak
around at night
and finish other
people formulas
that only one or two
people in the world
could do and then lie about it
cause i dont see a lot
of honour in that will

-i know what im doing with the boy
i dont care if you have
a rapport with the boy
i dont care if you have a few
laughs even at my expense
but dont you dare undermine
what im trying to do here
undermine
this boy is at a
fragile point right now
i do understand he is at a fragile point
okay he got problems
what problems does
he have sean
that he better off as a janitor
that he is better off in jail
better hanging out with a
bunch of retarded gorillas
why do you think he
does that gerry
you have any fuckin clue why
he can handle the problems
he can handle the work
he obviously handled you
gerry listen listen to me
why is he hiding
why doesnt he trust anybody
because the first thing
that happened to him
he was abandoned by the people
who were supposed to
love him the most
come on dont give
me that freudian crap
oh no listen gerry
why does he hang out with those
retarded gorillas
as you call them
because any one of them
if he asked them to
would take a fucking
bat to your head okay
-that called loyalty
-yeah that very touching
and who he handling
he pushes people away
before they have a
chance to leave him
it a defence
mechanism all right
for 20 years he been
alone because of that
if you push him right now
it gonna be the same
thing all over again
and im not gonna let
that happen to him
-dont you do that sean
-what
dont you do that dont
infect him with the idea
that it okay to quit that
it okay to be a failure
because it not okay sean
and if youre angry at
me for being successful
for being what you
could have been
-im not angry at you
-oh yes youre angry at me sean
you resent me
but im not gonna apologize
for any success ive had
youre angry at me for doing
what you could have done
but ask yourself
sean ask yourself
ask yourself if you want
will to feel that way
if you want him to
feel like a failure
you arrogant shit
that why i dont come
to the goddamn reunions
cause i cant stand
that look in your eye
you know that condescending
embarrassed look
oh come on sean
you think im a failure
i know who i am
im proud of what i do
it was a conscious choice
i didnt fuck up
and you and your cronies think
im some sort of pity case
you and your kiss-ass chorus
following you around going the
field medal the field medal
why are you still so
fuckin afraid of failure
it about my medal isnt it
oh god i could go home and get it for you
you can have it
oh please dont you know what
shove the medal up your
fuckin ass all right
cause i dont give a
shit about your medal
because i knew you before
you were a mathematical god
when you were
pimple-faced and homesick
and didnt know what side
of the bed to piss on
yeah you were
smarter than me then
and youre smarter than me now
so dont blame me for how your
life turned out it not my fault
i dont blame you
it not about you
you mathematical dick
it about the boy
he a good kid and i
wont see you fuck him up
like youre tryin to
fuck up me right now
i wont see you make him
feel like a failure too
he wont be a failure
but if you push him gerry
if you ride him
i am what i am today
because i was pushed
