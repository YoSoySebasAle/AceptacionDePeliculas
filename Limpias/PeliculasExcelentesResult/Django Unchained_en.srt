in the dark
state your business
or prepare to get winged
calm yourselves gentlemen
i mean you no harm
im simply a fellow weary traveler

go by the name of the speck brothers
might that be you
-who wants to know
-well i do

at the greenville auction
-so what
-so i wish to parley with you
speak english
im sorry
please forgive me
it is a second language
now amongst your inventory
ive been led to believe
is a specimen im keen to acquire
hello you poor devils
is there one amongst you
who was formerly a resident
of the carrucan plantation
im from the carrucan plantation
who said that
what your name
django
then you are exactly the one
im looking for
do you know who
the brittle brothers are
who are they
big john
ellis
roger
sometime they call him little raj
they was overseers
at the carrucan plantation
not anymore
tell me if you were to see any
of these three gentlemen again
-would you recognize them
-hey
-stop talking to him like that
-like what
like that
my good man
im simply trying to ascertain--
speak english goddamn it
everybody calm down
im simply a customer trying to
conduct a transaction
i dont care no sale now off with you
dont be ridiculous
of course theyre for sale
move it
my good man did you simply get
carried away with your dramatic gesture
or are you pointing your weapon
at me with lethal intention
last chance fancy pants
oh very well
im sorry to put a bullet in your beast
i didnt want you to do anything rash
before you had a moment
to come to your senses
you goddamn son of a bitch
you shot roscoe
well
and you killed ace
i only shot your brother
once he threatened to shoot me
and i do believe i have--
one two three four
--five witnesses
who can attest to that fact
-damn leg busted
-no doubt
now if you could keep your caterwauling
down to a minimum
id like to finish my line of inquiry
with young django
god-fucking-damn it
as i was saying
if you were to see the brittle brothers
again you could recognize them
yeah
sold american
so mr speck
mr speck
how much for young django here
that iron is nasty business
oh could you hold this for a moment
thank you
django get up on that horse
also if i were you
id take that winter coat
the dear departed speck left behind
nigger
dont you touch my brother coat
goddamn it
one hundred 0
and 5
for young django here
and since he wont be
needing it anymore
id like to purchase
your brother nag
also mr speck
im afraid i will require a bill of sale
do you have one
you go to hell dentist
i thought not
no worries i come prepared
thank you
this will serve nicely as a bill of sale
now as to you poor devils
so as i see it
when it comes to the subject
of what to do next
you gentlemen have two choices
one
once im gone you could lift
that beast off the remaining speck
then carry him to the nearest town
which would be at least 37 miles
back the way you came
or two
you could unshackle yourselves
take that rifle
put a bullet in his head
bury the two of them deep
and then make your way to a more
enlightened area of this country
choice is yours
oh and on the off chance there are any
astronomy aficionados amongst you
the north star is that one
ta-ta
now wait a minute fellas
let talk about this
you gotta be reasonable
in a situation like this
im not a bad guy
im just doing my job
blueberry didnt i
give you my last apple
tell you what boys
take me to the doc in el paso
ill get you your freedom
no no please
all right now
id like you to take two of these
tonight
and then in the morning
that a nigger on a horse
what everybody staring at
they aint never seen no nigger
on a horse before
good morning innkeeper
two beers for two weary travelers
it still a bit early
we wont be open for another hour
by then well be serving breakfast
what the hell
you think youre doing boy
get that nigger out of here
help help
innkeeper
remember get the sheriff
not the marshal
sheriff help
alas
now we must act
as our own bartender
sit down my boy
what kind of dentist are you
despite that cart
i havent practiced dentistry in five years
but these days
i practice a new profession
bounty hunter
do you know what a bounty hunter is
no
well
the way the slave trade
deals in human lives for cash
a bounty hunter deals in corpses
hat
the state places a bounty
on a man head
i track that man i find that man
i kill that man
after ive killed him i transport
that man corpse back to the authorities
sometimes that easier said
than done
i show that corpse to the authorities
proving indeed i truly have killed him
at which point the authorities
pay me the bounty
so like slavery
it a flesh-for-cash business
what a bounty
it like a reward
you kill people
and they give you a reward
certain people yeah
bad people
badder they are bigger the reward
which brings me to you
and i must admit im at a bit of
a quandary when it comes to you
on one hand i despise slavery
on the other hand i need your help
if youre not in a position to refuse
all the better
so for the time being im gonna make
this slavery malarkey work to my benefit
still having said that
i feel guilty
so i would like the two of us
to enter into an agreement
im looking for the brittle brothers
however at this endeavor
im at a slight disadvantage
insofar as i dont know
what they look like
but you do dont you
i know what they look like all right
good
so here my agreement
you travel with me until we find them
where we going
i hear at least two of them are overseeing
in gatlinburg but i dont know where
that means we visit every plantation
in gatlinburg till we find them
and when we find them
you point them out and i kill them
you do that
i agree to give you your freedom
$25 per brittle brother
that $75
and as if on cue
here comes the sheriff
okay boys fun over
come on out
all right folks calm down
go about your business
these jokers will be gone soon
now why yall wanna come into my town
and start trouble
and scare all these nice people
you aint got nothing better to do
than to come into bill sharp town
and show your ass
whatd you just do to our sheriff
now you can get the marshal
marshal marshal
-should we wait inside
-can we just leave
after you
move that buckboard a long ways
across the street from the saloon
i want six men six rifles behind it
i want two men
two rifles up on this roof
two men two rifles on that roof
all the barrels aimed at that front door
somebody get poor bill
out of the goddamn street
you in the saloon
we got 00 rifles aimed at
every way out of that building
you got one chance
to get out of this alive
you and your nigger come out right now
and i mean right now
is this the marshal i have the pleasure
of addressing
yes it is
this is us marshal gill tatum
na wunderbar marshal
i have relieved myself of all weapons
and just as you have instructed
i am ready to step outside
with my hands raised
above my head
i trust as a representative
of the criminal justice system
of the united states of america
i shant be shot down in the street
by either you or your deputies
before ive had my day in court
you mean like you did our sheriff
shot him down like a dog in the street
yes that exactly what i mean
do i have your word as a lawman
not to shoot me down
like a dog in the street
well much as wed all enjoy
seeing something like that
aint nobody gonna cheat
the hangman in my town
fair enough marshal here we come
theyre a little tense out there
so dont make any quick movements
and let me do the talking
come ahead
-you unarmed
-yes indeed we are
marshal tatum
may i address you and your deputies
and apparently the entire town
of daughtrey
as to the incident that just occurred
go on
thank you
my name is dr king schultz
like yourself marshal
im a servant of the court
the man lying dead in the dirt
who the good people of daughtrey
saw fit to elect as their sheriff
who went by the name of bill sharp
is actually a wanted outlaw
by the name of willard peck
with a price on his head of $200
now that $200 dead or alive
the hell you say
im aware this is probably
disconcerting news
but im willing to wager
this man was elected sheriff
sometime in the past two years
-yeah
-i know this because three years ago
he was rustling cattle from the
bc corrigan cattle company
of lubbock texas
now this is a warrant
made out by circuit court judge
henry allen laudermilk
of austin texas
youre encouraged to wire him
hell back up who i am
and who your
dear departed sheriff was
in other words marshal

of the criminal justice system
of the united states
the man to my left is django freeman
he my deputy
in my pocket is a warrant
signed by circuit court judge henry
allen laudermilk of austin texas
for the arrest and capture
dead or alive
of john brittle roger brittle
and ellis brittle
they were going by the name shaffer
you know them by the name of shaffer
but the butchers real name was brittle
these are wanted men
the law wants them for murder
now i reiterate
the warrant states dead or alive
so when mr freeman and myself
executed these men on sight
we were operating
within our legal boundaries
i realize passions are high
but i must warn you
the penalty for taking deadly force
against an officer of the court
in the performance of his duty is
youll be hung by the neck
until youre dead
now may i please remove the warrant
from my pocket so you may examine it
gimme

how you know broomhilda
first masters was german
broomhilda a german name
if they named her
it stands to reason theyd be german
lots of gals where youre from
named broomhilda
broomhilda is the name
of a character
in the most popular
of all the german legends
there a story about broomhilda
oh yes there is
do you know it
oh every german knows that story
would you like me to tell you
well broomhilda was a princess
she was a daughter of wotan
god of all gods
anyway her father is really mad at her
what she do
i cant exactly remember
she disobeys him in some way
so he puts her on top of the mountain
broomhilda on a mountain
it a german legend there going to be
a mountain in there somewhere
and he puts a fire-breathing dragon
there to guard the mountain
and he surrounds her
in a circle of hellfire
and there broomhilda shall remain
unless a hero arises
brave enough to save her
does a fella arise
yes django as a matter of fact
he does
a fella named siegfried
does siegfried save her
quite spectacularly so
he scales the mountain
because he not afraid of it
he slays the dragon
because he not afraid of him
and he walks through hellfire
because broomhilda worth it
i know how he feel
i think im just starting to realize that
now look django
i dont doubt that one day
youll save your lady love
but i cant let you go to greenville
in a good conscience
a slave auction town in mississippi
isnt the place for you to visit
free or not it just too dangerous
but let me ask you a question
how do you like
the bounty hunting business
kill white folks and they pay you for it
what not to like
now i have to admit
we make a good team
i thought you was mad at me
for killing big john and little raj
yeah you were a tad overzealous
but normally that a good thing
howd you like to partner up
for the winter
what you mean partner up
you work with me
through the winter till the snow melts
i give you a third of my bounties
so we make some money this winter
and when the snow melts
ill take you to greenville myself
and well find
where they sent your wife
why you care what happen to me
why you care if i find my wife
frankly
ive never given anybody
their freedom before
and now that i have
i feel vaguely responsible for you
plus when a german meets a real-life
siegfried that kind of a big deal
as a german im obliged to help you
on your quest to rescue
your beloved broomhilda
you got her
what happened to mr i wanna
shoot white folks for money
his son with him
well good
hell have a loved one with him
maybe even share a last word
that better than most of them get
damn sight better than he deserves
put down the rifle
dont worry im not mad at you

broomhilda von shaft
age 27
r on right cheek
calvin candie
he owns the fourth biggest cotton
plantation in mississippi candyland
candyland
-oh youve heard of it
-aint no slave aint heard of candyland
well apparently
that where your wife is
and that the repellant gentleman
who owns her
let hope she works
in the house not the field
oh no she aint no field nigger
she-she pretty
and she talk good too
but when they tore her back up
and then they burned
that runaway r on her cheek
they goddamned her
she aint no field nigger but aint good
enough for the house no more
-they gonna try to make her a comfort girl
-what a comfort--
not while i got freedom
not while i got my gun
so do we offer to buy her
so
say
a man wants to buy a horse
needs to buy a horse
he walks up to the farmer farm
knocks on the door
and asks the farmer to buy his horse
you know what the farmer says
the farmer says no
well i say fuck that farmer
and im stealing that horse
fair enough
but now youre a horse thief
and they hang horse thieves
the horse goes back to its original owner
because the horse is his property
we need her and we need
a bill of sale
if we aint gonna buy her
how we gonna get her
may i offer an alternative
plan of action
go ahead
so
the man walks up to the farmer farm
he knocks on the farmer door
and asks not to buy the horse
but the farm
and makes an offer so ridiculous
the farmer is forced to say yes
-we gonna offer to buy candyland
-no it far too big
but apparently this farmer
aint all about the farm
how much do you know
about mandingo fighting
what
can you convincingly masquerade
as someone
who is an expert
on mandingo fighting
why
because my character is that of
a big money buyer from düsseldorf
here in greenville to buy my way
into the mandingo fight game
and your character is a mandingo expert
i hired to help me do it
they call that one-eyed charly

i am a seasoned slaver you are--
well you are a neophyte
im simply trying to ascertain
if this cowboy here
is taking advantage of you
with all due respect
monsieur candie
i didnt seek you out for your advice
i sought you out to purchase a fighting
nigger at above top-dollar market price
i was under the impression
when you granted me an audience
it would be to discuss business
well we werent talking business yet
we were discussing my curiosity
thank you
roscoe coco go outside and play
sheba you stay right there
i know you didnt mean me
german
now according to moguy
if i do business with you
im doing business with both yall
he does the eyeballing
you the billfold
well you dont make it sound
too flattering but more or less yeah
so
bright boy moguy tells me
you looked over my african flesh
and you was none too impressed
huh
not for top dollar
then we got nothing more
to talk about
you wanna buy a beat-ass
nigger from me
those are the beat-ass niggers
i wanna sell
he dont wanna buy the niggers
you wanna sell
he wants the nigger
you dont wanna sell
well i dont sell the niggers
i dont wanna sell
well you wont sell your best
you wont even sell your second best
but your third best
you dont want to sell him either
but if i made you an offer so ridiculous
youd be forced to consider it
who knows what could happen
and what do you consider ridiculous
for a truly talented specimen
the right nigger
how much would you say django
twelve thousand dollars
well gentlemen
you had my curiosity
but now you have my attention
willie willie

wont you take a ride with us
here in the victoria
oh thank you very much
you can tie your horse up back there
django
where i part company from many
of my phrenologist colleagues
is i believe there is a level
above bright
above talented above loyal
that a nigger can aspire to
say one nigger that just pops up
in 0000
the exceptional nigger
bright day huh bright boy
the sun is up
it shining on all of us
have a seat doc
thank you quite an honor
-the honor is all ours
-thank you
but i do believe that given time
exceptional niggers
like bright boy here
become if not frequent
more frequent
right boy
you are that  in 0000
the name of the game is keep up
not catch up nigger
-touch your guns you die
-everybody calm down
now i saw the whole thing
no harm done
-are you kidding me this nigger just--
-i said no harm done
now take your hand off your pistol
butch that means you too
everybody stop antagonizing
my guest
hoot get back up on your horse
he broke my collarbone
for god sake
somebody please help hoot here
back up on his goddamn horse

indeed
may we stop for a moment
so i may put a word in my man ear
im expecting to fall in love once i see
the specimens at candyland
so before that moment
it would be good if i could have
a confidential strategy meeting
with my confidant
what the hell you doing
i confirmed that broomhilda
at candyland
-youre sure it her
-he didnt call her by name
but she a young lady whip marks
on her back and speaks german
while it not wise to assume
in this instance i think it pretty safe
point being
dont get so carried away
with your retribution
you lose sight of why were here
-you think i lost sight of that
-yes i do stop antagonizing candie
youre going to blow this whole charade
or more than likely get us both killed
and i for one dont intend to die
in chickasaw county mississippi usa
im not antagonizing him
im intriguing him
youre yelling abuse
at these poor slaves
i recall the man
who had me kill another man
in front of his son
and he didnt bat a eye
you remember that
yeah of course i remember
what you said was that
this is my world
and in my world you gotta get dirty
so that what im doing
im getting dirty
well youre paraphrasing a tad
but that was the general gist
see you at candyland

dartagnan

hildi this is dr schultz
it a pleasure to meet you broomhilda
ive heard a lot of good things
about you
well it not every nigger
speaks german dont you know
as i look at you now broomhilda
i can see all the passions you inspire
are completely justified
the doctor here speaks german
and ive been informed you do as well
go ahead girl speak a little german
astonishing
-and i shall bring y--
-much obliged
dont be afraid
pardon
hey little troublemaker
you silver-tongued devil you
-hurry up
-these ready miss cora
no they drinking tonight
go get the jug with the red stuff
monsieur candie like
-get your big pretty ass out the way
-you know you like it
that because you knows what i like
come on with these biscuits girl
look monsieur candie they were
all fine specimens no doubt about it
but the best three by far
were samson
-what that other one name
-goldie
goldie
and eskimo joe
by the way
why is he called eskimo joe
you never know how these
nigger nicknames get started
his name was joe maybe one day
he said he was cold who knows
well regardless samson your best
we all know that
you will never sell him
and i can see why he a champion
all three are champions
samson the champion
them other two pretty good
-calvin what this nigger you let--
-it all right
you have to understand
monsieur candie
while admittedly a neophyte
in the nigger fight game
i do have a little bit of a background
in the european traveling circus
is that right
hence i have big ideas
when it comes to presentation
i need something more
than just a big nigger
yeah he needs to have panache
-need to have what what
-panache
-a sense of showmanship
-showmanship yes
i want to be able to bill him
as the black hercules
-the black hercules isnt that clever
-more like nigger-les
i said and i quote
i would pay top dollar for
the right nigger
now im not saying that eskimo joe
is the wrong nigger per se
but is he right as rain
oh dr schultz i will have you know
there is no one in the nigger fight game
that appreciates
the value of showmanship
-more than monsieur calvin j candie
-nobody
but one must not forget the most
important thing in the nigger fight game
and that is a nigger
that can win fights
now that should be your first second
third fourth and fifth concern
after you have that
and you know you have that
then you can start to implement
a grand design
in other words first thing is first
first things first
i see you two getting on
famously
oh monsieur candie
you cannot imagine what it like not to
hear your native tongue in four years
well hell i cant imagine
two weeks in boston
two weeks in boston
monsieur candie you a mess
two weeks in boston
i cant express the joy i felt
conversing in my mother tongue
and hildi is a charming
conversation companion
well be careful now dr schultz
you might have caught
a little dose of nigger love
nigger love a powerful emotion boy
it like a pool of black tar
once it catches your ass you caught
yes sir you stuck
i dont know doctor
you can lay on all
the german sweet talk you want
but it looks like this pony
got big eyes for django
well naturally
it is the soaring eagle
that attracts her attention
not the plucked chicken
dr schultz
dont be so down on yourself
you are quite the dapper
european gentleman
to clean these dishes put your elbow
in these dishes you hear
you know that nigger dont you
-who
-who
dont who me bitch
you know who im talking about
at the table
i dont know him
you dont know him
-no
-no what
no sir
you wouldnt lie to me now
would you
okay
yeah if you say so
eskimo joe a quality nigger
no doubt about it
but if it was my money
i wouldnt pay no $2000 for him
what would your price be
well if i was inclined
to be generous
and i dont know why i would be
inclined to be generous
maybe
dr schultz
let me reclarify how this
whole negotiation came about
it wasnt me who came to you
to sell a nigger
sure wasnt
-you approached me to buy one
-sure was
that $9000 bright boy
been bandying about
aint too far off if i wanted
to sell eskimo joe for that
-i could do so any day of the week
-any day
but like you said in greenville doctor
i dont wanna sell him
it was only your ridiculous offer
of $2000
that made me even consider it
you know monsieur candie you do
possess the power of persuasion
why not
monsieur candie you have a deal
eskimo joe $2000
hooray doctor hooray
and a wise decision that is
however that is a tremendous
amount of money
and the way you have your mr moguy
i have a lawyer
persnickety man named tuttle
and i would need my mr tuttle
to draw up a legal contract
before id feel comfortable exchanging
that amount of money for flesh
not to mention having eskimo joe
examined by a physician of my choosing
-naturally
-so say i return in about
five days time
five days
with my mr tuttle
and then my mr tuttle
and your mr moguy
can hash out the finer details
between themselves
i say splendid doctor splendid
gentlemen
may i propose a toast
to eskimo joe
or shall we call him
the black hercules
to the black hercules
the black hercules
to the black hercules
you was right doctor
that name do have pan-ass
hildi top my drink off
so hildi how you like serving
at the big table in the big house huh
when monsieur candie talk to you
you answers
i like it a lot monsieur candie
better than sizzling in that hot box
or dragging your ass
through a bramble bush
maybe not as much fun as getting to
pleasure all them mandingos huh
-she like them niggers sure do
-like samson
no sir
you know monsieur candie
the doctor here might be interested
in seeing hildi peeled back
seeing as how they dont have
many niggers where he come from
dr schultz
when you was alone with hildi
did you just speak german
or did you take her clothes off
-no we just talked and--
-oh so you havent seen her back
i havent--
no no no stephen right
you might find this interesting
hildi take off your dress
show dr schultz your back here
go on
calvin i just got her all dressed up
and looking nice
but lara lee
dr schultz is from düsseldorf
they dont got niggers there
he is a man of medicine
it would fascinate him
the niggers endurance for pain
these niggers are tough dr schultz
no doubt about it
hildi got something like four lashes
lara lee just get one
shed lose her goddamn mind
-look at that doctor it like a painting
-calvin

but that 2000
that made you real friendly
now didnt it
yes it did
his wife huh
if it had been a snake
it would have bit me
those lying
goddamn time-wasting
sons of bitches
sons of bitches
--out of new orleans so i have quite
a bit of practice with theater types
oh there you are
i was beginning to think that you
and that old crow run off together
thatd be a hell of a note wouldnt it
lara lee i was just looking
out the big window
billy crash is out there
dealing with some shady slaver
trying to sell a passel of ponies
be a dear go give them gals an eyeball
-of course brother
-thank you darling
yeah business never sleeps
apropos before your exit
we were discussing the possibility
of my purchasing broomhilda
yes yes we were doctor
and we will again in a moment
who your little friend
this is ben
he a old joe that lived around here
for a long time
and i do mean a long damn time
old ben here took care of my daddy
and my daddy daddy
till he up and keeled over one day
old ben took care of me
growing up the son of a huge
plantation owner in mississippi
puts a white man in contact
with a whole lot of black faces
i spent my whole life here
right here in candyland
surrounded by black faces
now seeing them every day
day in day out
i only had one question
why dont they kill us
now right out there on that porch
three times a week for 50 years
old ben here would shave my daddy
with a straight razor
now if i was old ben i would have
cut my daddy goddamn throat
and it wouldnt have taken me
no 50 years to do it neither
but he never did
why not
you see the science of phrenology
is crucial to understanding
the separation of our two species
in the skull of the african here
the area associated
with submissiveness
is larger than any human or any other
subhuman species on planet earth
if you examine
this piece of skull here
you will notice three distinct dimples
here here and here
now
if i was holding the skull
of an isaac newton or galileo
these three dimples would be found
in the area most associated with
creativity
but this is the skull of old ben
and in the skull of old ben
unburdened by genius
these three dimples exist in the area
of the skull most associated with
servility
now bright boy
i will admit you are pretty clever
but if i took this hammer here
and i bashed in your skull with it
you would have the same
three dimples in the same place
as old ben
hey now lay your palms
flat on that tabletop
if you lift those palms
off that turtle shell tabletop
mr pooch is gonna let loose
with both barrels of that sawed-off
there have been a lot of lies
around this dinner table tonight
but that you can believe
mr moguy would you collect the pistol
hanging off these boys hips here
-thank you ever so much
-doctor
where were we
jackass
yes
i do believe you were just getting ready
to make me a proposition
to buy broomhilda
am i right
right
bring out hildi
get over there yonder
sit your ass in that goddamn chair
-lay your hand flat on that tabletop
-now shut your mouth
dr schultz
in greenville you yourself said
that for the right nigger
youd be willing to pay what some
may consider is a ridiculous amount
to which me myself said
what is your definition of ridiculous
to which you said $2000
now considering yall have ridden
a whole lot of miles
went through a whole lot of trouble
and done spread a whole lot of bull
to purchase this lovely lady right here
it would appear that broomhilda is
in fact the right nigger
and if yall want to leave candyland
with broomhilda
the price is $2000
and i take it you prefer the take it
or leave it style of negotiation
yes i do doctor
you see under the laws
of chickasaw county
broomhilda here is my property
and i can choose to do with my property
whatever i so desire
and if yall think my price
for this nigger here is too steep
what im gonna desire to do is
take this goddamn hammer here
and beat her ass to death with it
right in front of both yall
easy big fella
then we can examine the three dimples
inside broomhilda skull
now what it gonna be doc
what it gonna be
may i lift the hands off the tabletop
in order to remove my billfold
yes you may
that 2
sold
to the man with the exceptional beard
and his unexceptional nigger
-mr moguy
-yes calvin
will you make these gentlemen
a receipt for $2000 please
twelve thousand dollars
it was a pleasure doing business
with yall
now gentlemen
if you care to join me in the parlor
we will be serving white cake
well done calvin
excuse me
excuse me maam
could you please
stop playing beethoven
take your hands off the harp
doctor
-doctor you cant go in there
-stephen stephen
-he aint got no business going in there
-let it be
he just a little upset that all
ill handle this
white cake
i dont go in for sweets thank you
you brooding about me
getting the best of you huh
actually i was thinking of that
poor devil you fed to the dogs today
dartagnan
and i was wondering what dumas
would make of all this
come again
alexandre dumas
he wrote the three musketeers
yes of course doctor
i figured you must be an admirer
you named your slave
after his novel lead character
now if alexandre dumas
had been there today
i wonder what he would have
made of it
you doubt hed approve huh
yes his approval would be
a dubious proposition at best
soft-hearted frenchie
alexandre dumas is black
-are these broomhilda papers
-yes they are
-may i
-of course
thank you
that is her bill of sale
her ownership history
and of course
her freedom papers doctor
would you have ink and pen for me
-right over there on that little table
-thank you
thank you
broomhilda von shaft
consider yourself a free woman
mr candie
normally i would say
auf wiedersehen
but since what auf wiedersehen
actually means is till i see you again
and since i never wish
to see you again to you sir
i say goodbye
let go
come on
one more moment doctor
what
it a custom here in the south
once a business deal is concluded
that the two parties shake hands
-it implies good faith
-im not from the south
but you are
in my house doctor
so im afraid i must insist
insist
on what that i shake your hand
oh then im afraid i must insist
in the opposite direction
-you know what i think you are
-what you think i am no i dont
i think you are a bad loser
and i think youre an abysmal winner
nevertheless
here in chickasaw county
a deal aint done
until the two parties
have shook hands
even after all that paper signing
dont mean shit
you dont shake my hand
if i dont shake your hand
youre gonna throw away $2000
i dont think so
mr pooch
if she tries to leave here before this
nigger-loving german shakes my hand

to shake your hand
i insist
if you insist
