
forget it it too risky
im through doing that shit
you always say that
the same thing every time
im through never again
too dangerous
i know that what i always say
im always right too
you forget about it in a day or two
the days of me
forgetting are over
the days of me remembering
have just begun
you know when you go on like this
what you sound like
i sound like a sensible
fuckin man
you sound like a duck
quack quack quack
take heart cause youre never
gonna have to hear it again
since im never gonna do it again
youre never gonna have to
hear me quack
after tonight
correct
i got all tonight to quack
can i get anyone more coffee
oh yes
thank you
youre welcome
i mean
the way it is now
youre takin the same risk
as when you rob a bank
takin more of a risk
banks are easier
federal banks aint supposed
to stop you in any way
during a robbery
theyre insured why should
they give a fuck i dont even
need a gun in a federal bank
heard about this one bloke
he walks into a bank
with a portable phone
he gives the phone to a teller
the bloke on the other end says
we got this guy little girl
if you dont give him all your
money were gonna kill her
did it work
fuckin right it worked
that what im talkin about
knucklehead walks into a bank
with a telephone not a pistol
not a shotgun a fuckin phone
cleans the place out
they dont lift a fuckin finger
did they hurt the little girl
there probably never was a little girl
the point of the story isnt a little girl
the point of the story is they
robbed a bank with a telephone
you want to rob banks
im not saying i wanna rob banks
im illustrating if we did
itd be easier than what
weve been doing
no more liquor stores
whatve we been talkin about
yeah no more liquor stores
besides it aint the giggle it used to be
there too many foreigners
own liquor stores
vietnamese koreans
dont even speak fuckin english
you tell em empty out
the register they dont know
what youre talkin about
they make it too personal
we keep on one of these gook
fuckers gonna make us kill him
im not gonna kill anybody
i dont want to either
but theyll probably put us in
a situation where it us or them
and if it not the gooks
it these old fuckin jews
whove owned the store
for 5 fucking generations
you got grandpa irving sitting
behind the counter with
a fucking magnum in his hand
try walkin into one of those places
with nothing but a phone
see how far that gets you
forget it
were out of it
well what then day jobs
not in this life
what then
garcon coffee
this place
garcon
means boy
this place
a coffee shop
what wrong with that
nobody ever robs restaurants
why not
bars liquor stores
gas stations;
you get your head blown off
stickin up one of them
restaurants on the other hand
you catch with their pants down
theyre not expectin to get robbed
not as expectin anyway
i bet you could cut down
on the hero factor in a place like this
correct
same as banks
these places are insured
manager
he dont give a fuck
theyre just trying to get you out
before you start pluggin the diners
waitresses fuckin forget it
no way theyre takin a bullet
for the register
busboys some wetback gettin
paid $50 an hour
really give a fuck youre
stealin from the owner
customers sittin there
with food in their mouths
they dont know what goin on
one minute
theyre havin a denver omelet the next
someone is stickin a gun in their face
see i got the idea
the last liquor store
we stuck up remember
all the customers kept comin in
yeah
you got the idea
of takin their wallets
now that was a good idea
thank you
made more from the wallets
than we did from the register
yes we did
a lot of people
come to restaurants
a lot of wallets
pretty smart huh
pretty smart
im ready let do it
right now right here
come on
all right same as
last time remember
youre crowd control
ill handle the employees
i love you pumpkin
i love you honey bunny
everybody be cool
this is a robbery
any of you fucking pricks move
and ill execute every motherfuckin
last one of you

okay so tell me again
about the hash bars
okay what you want to know
hash is legal there right
yeah it legal
but it aint 00% legal
you just cant walk into a restaurant
roll a joint and start puffin away
i mean they want you
to smoke in your home
or certain designated places
those are hash bars
yeah
it breaks down like this
it legal to buy it
it legal to own it
and if youre the proprietor
of a hash bar it legal to sell it
it illegal to carry it
but-but that doesnt matter
cause get a load of this
if you get stopped by a cop
in amsterdam it illegal
for them to search you
i mean that a right the cops
in amsterdam dont have
oh man im goin
that all there is to it
im fuckin goin
i know baby
youd dig it the most
but you know what the funniest
thing about europe is
what
it the little differences
i mean they got the same shit
over there that they got here
but it just there
it a little different
example
you can walk into a movie theater
in amsterdam and buy a beer
and i dont mean just like no paper cup
im talkin about a glass of beer
and in paris you can buy
a beer in mcdonald
you know what they call
a quarter pounder
with cheese in paris
they dont call it
a quarter pounder with cheese
they got the metric system
they wouldnt know what the fuck
a quarter-pounder is
what do they call it
they call it a royale with cheese
royale with cheese
that right
what do they call a big mac
big mac a big mac
but they call it le big mac
imitating french accent
le big mac laughs
what do they call a whopper
i dont know i didnt
go into burger king
you know what they put on french fries
in holland instead of ketchup
what
mayonnaise
chuckles
goddamn
i seen em do it man
they fuckin drown em in that shit
yuck
we should have shotguns
for this kind of deal
how many up there
three or four
that countin our guy
not sure
so that means that it could be
up to five guys up there
it possible
we should have fuckin shotguns
what her name
mia
mia how did marsellus
and her meet
i dont know
however people meet people
she used to be a actress
oh really
she do anything
id have seen
i think her biggest deal
was she starred in a pilot
pilot what a pilot
well you know
the shows on tv
i dont watch tv
yeah but you are aware
that there is an invention
called television
and on this invention
they show shows right
yeah
the way they pick tv shows
is they make one show
that show called a pilot
then they show that one show
to the people who pick shows
and on the strength of that
one show they decide if
they wanna make more shows
some get chosen and
become television programs
some dont become nothin
she starred in one of the ones
that became nothing
you remember
antwan rockamora
half-black half-samoan
used to call him tony rocky horror
yeah maybe fat right
i wouldnt go so far as to
call the brother fat
he got a weight problem
i mean what a nigger
gonna do he samoan
i think i know who you mean
what about him
marsellus fucked him up good
word round the campfire
is it was on account of
marsellus wallace wife
elevator bell rings
so what hed do fuck her
no no no no no
nothin that bad
well then what then
he gave her a foot massage
a foot massage
that it
mm-hmm
then whatd marsellus do
sent a couple cats over to his place
they took him out on his patio
threw his ass over the balcony
nigger fell four stories
he had a little garden down
at the bottom enclosed in glass
like a greenhouse
nigger fell through that
since then he kind of developed
a speech impediment
that a damn shame
hmm
but still you play with
matches you get burned
what do you mean
you dont be givin
marsellus wallace new bride
a foot massage
you dont think he overreacted
antwan didnt expect marsellus
to react the way he did but
he had to expect a reaction
it was a foot massage
a foot massage is nothin
i give my mother a foot massage
it laying your hands
in a familiar way
on marsellus new wife
i mean is it as bad as eatin
her pussy out no but it
the same fuckin ballpark
whoa stop right there
eatin the bitch out
and givin the bitch
a foot massage aint even
the same fucking thing
it not
it the same ballpark
aint no fuckin ballpark neither
now look maybe your method
of massage differs from mine
but touchin his wife feet
and sticking your tongue
in the holiest of holies
aint the same fuckin ballpark;
it aint the same league;
it aint the same fuckin sport
foot massages dont mean shit
have you ever given
a foot massage
scoffs
dont be tellin me
about foot massages
im the foot fuckin master
you given a lot of them
shit yeah got my technique
down and everything
i dont be ticklin or nothin
would you give a guy
a foot massage
fuck you
chuckles
you give em a lot
fuck you
you know im kind of tired
i could use a foot massage
yo yo yo man
you best back off
im gettin a little pissed here
this is the door
yeah it is
what time you got
722 in the am
no it aint quite time yet
come on let hang back
now look just cause
i wouldnt give no man a foot
massage dont make it right
for marsellus to throw
antwan off a building into
a glass motherfuckin house
fuckin up the way
the nigger talks;
that shit aint right
motherfucker do that shit to me
he better paralyze my ass
cause i kill the motherfucker
i aint sayin it right but you sayin
a foot massage dont mean nothin
im sayin it does
now look ive given a million
ladies a million foot massages
and they all meant somethin
we act like they dont but they do
that what so fuckin cool about them
there a sensuous thing goin on
where you dont talk about it
but you know it and she knows it
fuckin marsellus knew it
and antwan shouldve fuckin
better known better
that his fuckin wife man
this aint a man with a sense
of humor about this shit
you know what im sayin
it an interestin point
come on
let get into character

ezekiel 257
the path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish
and the tyranny of evil men
blessed is he who
in the name of charity and goodwill
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness
for he is truly
his brother keeper
and the finder of lost children
and i will strike down upon
thee with great vengeance
and furious anger
those who attempt to poison
and destroy my brothers
and you will know
my name is the lord
when i lay my vengeance
upon thee
screams

ace of spades
i heard you did a pilot
that was my 5 minutes
what was it
it was a show about a team
of female secret agents
called fox force five
what
fox force five
fox as in were a bunch
of foxy chicks
force as in were a force
to be reckoned with
and five as in there
one-two-three-four-five of us
there was a blond one
sommerset oneal
she was the leader
the japanese fox
was a kung fu master
the black girl
was a demolition expert
french fox speciality
was sex
what was your speciality
knives
the character i played
raven mccoy
her background was
she grew up raised
by circus performers
according to the show
she was the deadliest woman
in the world with a knife
and she knew
a zillion old jokes
her grandfather
an old vaudevillian taught her
and if we would have got picked up
they wouldve worked in a gimmick
where every show
i wouldve told another joke
you know any of them old jokes
well i only got
the chance to say one
cause we only did one show
tell me
it corny
dont be that way
tell me
no you wouldnt like it
and id be embarrassed
youd be embarr—
you told 50 million people

fuckin good milk shake

i dont know if it was worth five dollars
but it pretty fuckin good
continues
dont you hate that
hate what
uncomfortable silences
why do we feel it necessary
to yak about bullshit
in order to be comfortable
i dont know
that a good question
that when you know
you found somebody
really special
when you can just
shut the fuck up for a minute
and comfortably share silence
well i dont think were quite
there yet but dont feel bad
we just met each other
ill tell you what
im gonna go to the bathroom
and powder my nose
you sit here
and think of something to say
ill do that
okay
wolf whistle
people applauding
sniffing
i said goddamn
goddamn
goddamn
woman
i need some hair spray
since i first met you
mmmm
dont you just love it when you
come back from the bathroom to
find your food waiting for you
were lucky
we got anything at all
i dont think buddy holly
much of a waiter
maybe we shouldve sat
in marilyn monroe section
which one
there two monroes
no there not
that is marilyn monroe
that is mamie van doren
i dont see jayne mansfield
so she must have the night off
pretty smart
yeah i got my moments
so did you think of somethin to say
actually i did
however
you seem like
a really nice person and i—
i dont want to offend you
oooh
this doesnt sound like the usual
mindless boring
gettin-to-know-you chitchat
this sounds like you
actually have somethin to say
well well i do i do
inhales but you have to
promise not to be offended
no no
you cant promise somethin like that
i have no idea what youre
gonna ask me
you can ask me what youre gonna
ask me and my natural response
could be to get offended
then through no fault of my own
i would have broken my promise
let just forget it
that an impossibility
trying to forget anything
as intriguing as this would be
an exercise in futility
is that a fact
and besides
isnt it more uh exciting
when you dont have permission
all right all right
well here goes
what did you think about
what happened to antwan
who antwan
tony rocky horror you know him
he fell out of a window
hmm hmm
well that is one way to say it
another way to say it would be
that he was thrown out
another way would be
he was thrown out by marsellus
yet even another way is to say
he was thrown out of a window
by marsellus because of you
is that a fact
no
no it not a fact
it just what i heard
that just what i heard
who told you
they
they talk a lot
dont they
chuckles
they certainly do
they certainly do
dont be shy vincent
what else did they say
im— im not shy
um—
did it involve the f word
no no no no no
they just said that antwan
had given you a foot massage
and
and— and nothin
that it
you heard marsellus
threw tony rocky horror
out of a fourth-story window
for giving me a foot massage
mm-hmm
and you believe that
chuckles
well at the time i was told
it sounded reasonable
marsellus throwing tony out
of a fourth-story window
for massaging my feet
seemed reasonable
no it seemed excessive
but that doesnt mean it didnt happen
i understand that marsellus
is very protective of you
a husband being protective
of his wife is one thing
a husband almost killing
another man for touching
his wife feet is something else
but did it happen
only thing antwan ever touched of mine
was my hand when he shook it
at my wedding
really
truth is nobody knows
why marsellus threw tony
out that window
except marsellus and tony
when you little scamps get together
youre worse than a sewing circle
ladies and gentlemen
now the moment youve
all been waiting for
the world-famous
jackrabbit slim twist contest
applause

one lucky couple
will win this handsome trophy
that marilyn here is holding
now who will be

and now the young monsieur
and madame have rung
the chapel bell
cest la vie say the old folks
it goes to show you never can tell
they furnished off an apartment
with a two-room roebucks sale
the coolerador was crammed
with tv dinners and ginger ale
but when pierre found work
the little money comin
worked out well
cest la vie say the old folks
it goes to show you never can tell
they had a hi-fi phono
and boy did they let it blast
seven hundred little records
all rock rhythm and jazz
but when the sun went down
the rapid tempo of the music fell
cest la vie say the old folks
it goes to show you never can tell
they had a teenage wedding
and the old folks wished them well
you could see that pierre
did truly love the mademoiselle

man on television
one more thing and well start for—
butch stop watching tv
for a second
yeah
youve got a special visitor
tv stand up stand up
now do you remember when
i told you your daddy died
in a pow camp
well this here is captain koons
he was in the pow camp
with daddy
hello little man
boy i sure heard
a bunch about you
see i was a good friend
of your dad
we were in that hanoi
pit of hell together
over five years
hopefully
youll never have to
experience this yourself
but when two men
are in a situation like me
and your dad were
for as long as we were
you take on certain
responsibilities of the other
if itd been me whod—
not made it
major coolidged be talking
right now to my son jim
but the way it turned out
im talking to you
butch
i got something for ya
this watch i got here
was first purchased
by your great-grandfather
during the first world war
it was bought
in a little general store
in knoxville tennessee
made by the first company
to ever make wristwatches
up til then people just
carried pocket watches
it was bought by
private doughboy
erine coolidge
on the day he set sail
for paris
this was your
great-grandfather war watch
and he wore it every day
he was in that war and
when hed done his duty
he went home to your
great-grandmother
took the watch off
put it in an old coffee can
and in that can it stayed
until your granddad
dane coolidge was called
upon by his country
to go overseas and fight
the germans once again
this time they called it
world war ii
your great-grandfather
gave this watch to your
granddad for good luck
unfortunately dane luck wasnt
as good as his old man
dane was a marine
and he was killed
along with all
the other marines at
the battle of wake island
your granddad
was facing death
he knew it
none of those boys had
any illusions about ever
leaving that island alive
so three days before
the japanese took the island
your granddad asked a gunner
on an air force transport
name of winocki—
a man hed never met before
in his life—
to deliver to his infant son
who hed never seen in the flesh
his gold watch
three days later
your granddad was dead
but winocki kept his word
after the war was over
he paid a visit to your grandmother
delivering to your infant father
his dad gold watch
this watch
this watch was on your
daddy wrist when he was
shot down over hanoi
he was captured put in
a vietnamese prison camp
he knew if the gooks
ever saw the watch
itd be confiscated
taken away
the way your dad looked at it
this watch was your birthright
hed be damned if any slope
gonna put their greasy yellow
hands on his boy birthright
so he hid it in one place
he knew he could hide
something— his ass
five long years
he wore this watch up his ass
then he died of dysentery—
he give me the watch
i hid this uncomfortable
hunk of metal up my ass
two years
then
after seven years
i was sent home to my family and
now
little man
i give the watch to you

faster than ive ever seen
a victorious boxer leave the ring
do you think he knew
wilson was dead
my guess would be yes
i could see the frenzy in his
eyes give way to the realization
of what he was doing
i think any man wouldve
left the ring that fast
do you feel this tragedy
is gonna affect
the world of boxing
a tragedy like this cant help

i have a bit of a tummy
like madonna when she did
lucky star
it not the same thing
i didnt know there was
such a difference between
a pot belly and a tummy
the difference is huge
kissing
would you like it
if i had a pot belly
no
pot bellies make a man
look either oafish
or like a gorilla
but on a woman
a pot belly very sexy
the rest of you is normal—
normal face normal legs
normal hips normal ass—
but with a big
perfectly round pot belly
if i had one
id wear a t-shirt
two sizes too small
to accentuate it
you think men
would find that attractive
i dont give a damn
what men find attractive
it unfortunate what we find pleasing
to the touch and pleasing to the eye
is seldom the same
sighs
if you had a pot belly
i would punch you in it
youd punch me in the belly
right in the belly
ohh id smother you
id drop it right on your face

i was led to believe if she
comes home and finds us here
she wouldnt appreciate it much

that gives us 40 minutes
to get the fuck outta dodge
which if you do

how do you take it
lotsa cream lotsa sugar
about the car is there anything
i need to know does it stall

let go back to the kitchen
exhales
here you go
mr wolf
thank you jimmie
mmm
okay first thing
you two
take the body
stick it in the trunk
this looks to be
a pretty domesticated house
that would lead me to believe
you got cleansers and shit
yeah under the sink
good what i need you
two fellas to do is take
those cleaning products
and clean the inside
of the car— im talkin
fast fast fast
go in the back seat
scoop up all those little
pieces of brain and skull
get it out of there
wipe down the upholstery
it dont need
to be spick-and-span
you dont need to eat off it
just give it a good once-over
what you need to take care of
are the really messy parts
the pools of blood
that have collected
you gotta soak that shit up
we need to raid
your linen closet
i need blankets
i need comforters
quilts bedspreads
the thicker the better
the darker the better
no whites cant use em
well need to camouflage
the front seat and back seat
and floorboards
with quilts and blankets
so if a cop starts stickin
his big snout in the car
the subterfuge wont last
but at a glance the car
will appear to be normal
jimmie lead the way

you see that young lady
respect
alarm deactivates
respect for one elders
shows character
i have character
because you are a character doesnt
mean that you have character
chuckles
tires screeching
wanna share a cab
id go for some breakfast
feel like havin breakfast with me
phone dialing
cool
i dont know why i just thought
hed be european or something
yeah he about as european
as fuckin english bob
i know that now
but was he cool
or what
thank you
totally fuckin cool
in control
didnt even really get
pissed when you were fuckin
with him; i was amazed
chuckles
want some bacon
no man
i dont eat pork
are you jewish
i aint jewish; i just dont
dig on swine that all
why not
pigs are filthy animals
i dont eat filthy animals
yeah but bacon tastes good
pork chops taste good
sewer rat may taste
like pumpkin pie
but id never know
cause i wouldnt eat
the filthy motherfuckers
pigs sleep and root in shit
that a filthy animal
i aint eatin nothin
aint got sense enough to
disregard its own feces
how about a dog
dog eats its own feces
i dont eat dog either
yeah but do you consider
a dog to be a filthy animal
i wouldnt go so far
as to call a dog filthy
but theyre definitely dirty
but a dog got personality
personality goes a long way
ah so by that rationale
if a pig had a better personality
he would cease to be a filthy animal
is that true
wed have to be talkin about
one charming motherfuckin pig
i mean hed have to be
0 times more charming than
that arnold on green acres

act of god
and what an act of god
when um god makes
the impossible possible
but this morning
i dont think qualifies
hey vincent
see that shit dont matter
youre judging this shit
the wrong way
it could be god stopped
the bullets changed coke to
pepsi found my car keys
you dont judge shit
like this based on merit
now whether or not
what we experienced
was an according-to-hoyle
miracle is insignificant
but what is significant is
i felt the touch of god
god got involved
but why
well that what
fuckin with me
i dont know why
but i cant go back to sleep
youre serious
youre really thinkin about quittin
for life
most definitely
yeah

well that what i been
sitting here contemplating
first im gonna deliver
this case to marsellus
then basically im just
gonna walk the earth

walk from place to place
meet people get in adventures

what
your life im givin you
that money so i dont
have to kill your ass
you read the bible
ringo
not regularly no
well there this passage
i got memorized
ezekiel 257
the path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish
and the tyranny of evil men
blessed is he who in the name of charity
and good will
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness
for he is truly his
brother keeper and the
finder of lost children
and i will strike down upon
thee with great vengeance
and furious anger
those who attempt to poison
and destroy my brothers
and you will know
i am the lord
when i lay my vengeance
upon you
i been sayin that shit
for years
and if you heard it
that meant your ass
i never gave much thought
to what it meant
i just thought it was some
coldblooded shit to say
to a motherfucker
before i popped a cap
in his ass
but i saw some shit this morning
made me think twice
see now im thinkin
maybe it means
youre the evil man
and im the righteous man
and mr 9-millimeter here
he the shepherd
protecting my righteous ass
in the valley of darkness
or it could mean
youre the righteous man
and im the shepherd
and it the world
that evil and selfish
yeah id like that
but that shit aint the truth
the truth is
youre the weak
and im the tyranny
of evil men
but im tryin ringo
im tryin real hard
to be the shepherd
go
i think we should be
leaving now
yeah that probably
a good idea
