with lonnegan
hell swat you like a fly

i ever saw
he had you down as a big-timer
what happened
i conned a senator from
florida on a stock deal
a real lop-ear thought he was
gonna take over general electric
some chanteuse woke him though
and he put the feds on me
you mean you blew it
luther didnt tell me
you had a big mouth
he didnt tell me
you was a screw-up either
you played any
big cons since then
oh i lammed around
a bunch of bohunk towns
one kick ahead of the g-men
would be still if billie
hadnt set me up here
dont kid yourself friend
i still know how
are you going to stay
for breakfast
or do you already
know how to eat
i picked something up
along the way
is lonnegan after you too
i dont know
i aint seen anybody
you never do kid
doyle
yeah
we just talked to chicago
they got one of the grifters last night
a nigger
how about the other one
theyre still
looking for him
who did combs put on it
he gave it to riley and cole
they staked out the other
guy place last night
but he never showed
they figure maybe
he skipped town
do you want to
keep after him
you see that fella in the
red sweater over there
his name danny mccoy
works a few of the protection
rackets for carnello
when he waiting for
something better to happen
danny and i have known each
other since we were six
take a good look
at that face floyd
because if he ever finds out i can
be beat by one lousy grifter
ill have to kill him
and every other hood
who wants to muscle in
on my chicago operation
you follow
yes sir
good lad
hey you feeling all right
this morning henry
yeah fine
would you mind opening up the
round a little early today
we got some business
coming in before hours
sure
check the main gearing will you
man o war started rattling yesterday
and threw a kid on its head
great little countess
that billie
she runs a spiffy house
up there too
you uh plan to spend
the rest of your life here
i could do a lot worse
listen gondorff am i gonna learn
to play the big con or not
what your hurry
i wanna play for lonnegan
you know anything
about the guy
yeah he croaked luther
anything else i got to know
all right
he runs a numbers racket
on the south side
he owns a packinghouse
a few banks--
yeah and half the politicians
in new york and chicago
not a fix in this world gonna
cool him out if he blows on you
ill get him anyway
why
cause i dont know enough
about killin to kill him
you cant do it alone
you know
it takes a mob of guys and enough
money to make them look good
i know plenty of guys
it not like playing winos
you cant outrun a--
i never played for no winos
youve gotta keep his con
even after you take his money
he cant know you took him
youre scared of him
right down
to my socks buster
youre talkin about a guy
who would kill a grifter
over a chunk of money that
wouldnt support him for two days
youre going to go for him
i just dont want a hothead
looking to get even
coming back
halfway through saying
it aint enough cause
it all were gonna get
can you get a mob together
after what happened
to luther
i dont think i can get more
than 200 300 guys
luther said you learn fast
i hope he right
lonnegan gets most of his
income from the numbers
even though he been
putting more money
into his
savings-and-loan business
you think he moving out of the racket
no
he owns most of
the stock that traded
but my guess is he just trying to
build himself a respectable image
he came out of five points
but he been telling everybody
he was born in forest hills
he knows the market though
i dont think we can take him
on a stocks deal
twist
what about the numbers
tipsters say it run out of a
packinghouse on 4th by a guy named combs
lonnegan comes out every three
weeks to check on it but
he stays away from the day-to-day
stuff in case it raided
these are two of combs favorite
torpedoes riley and cole
you ever seen em
no
theyre the ones who hit luther
they also got the numbers
runner you conned
a guy named mottola
found him in a quarry
with a knife in his eye
lonnegan had seven or eight
people rubbed on his way up
his pattern has been
to get close to a racket boss
learn the operation
then move in on it
he done it to gorman
odonnell buchalman
he took the numbers
from sharkey
all four of these guys
are dead
he vindictive as hell henry
kills for pride
doesnt add up hed let
hooker get away from him
you see anything
kid you let us know
if they put you on the spot we got
to fold the con you got that
yeah you sure it got to be
one of these two guys
no theyre just
the only ones we know of
time
set me up five more beers
will you danny
you the owner here
that right
lt snyder bunco
that a joliet badge
snyder
dont cut much up here
looking for a guy on the lam
from a counterfeiting rap
thought he mightve
come in here
dont think so
i know everyone in the place
and i always bounce
the lamsters
all right if
i look around in here
no but youre welcome
to a free beer before you go
i dont really
need your permission
i dont know what to do
with this guy henry
he an irishman
who doesnt drink
doesnt smoke and
doesnt chase dames
he a grand knight
in the knights of columbus
and he only goes
out to play faro
sometimes plays
5 to 20 hours at a time
just him against the house
roulette craps
he wont touch em
the croupier at gilman says he
never plays anything he cant win
sports
likes to be seen
with fighters sometimes
but doesnt go to
the fights or bet on them
jesus does he do anything
where he not alone
just poker
and he cheats
pretty good at it too
where does he play
the porters say he runs a braced
game on the century limited
when he comes out
here from new york
$00 minimum straight poker
and a lot of high rollers ride
that train just to play him
that sounds good jj
which way are the rooms
who told you this guy was in here
nobody i just know what
kind of woman he likes
im gonna check all the
joy houses till i find him
well maybe i could help you
if you tell me his name
i doubt it
which way are the rooms
right through there
but i wouldnt go in there
if i were you
what are you gonna do
call the cops
i dont have to
youd be busting in on the chief
of police just up the hall
well play it out here
and a huge duke is too simple
with no fix were gonna need a
con with a sure-fire blow-off
i think we ought to play
this guy on the payoff
it the tightest game
we got
it not all over
the papers yet
lonnegan is a fast egg jj
he not going to sit still
for a standard play
so what does that leave us
we cant con
the payoff to a banker
well use the wire
havent known a poker player yet
didnt wanna beat the ponies
the wire been
out of date for 0 years
that why he wont know it
im not sure i know it
itll take two of us
working the inside
any objections
to hooker as second man
all right
well give lonnegan the hook
on the train and play him here

well there word
he gonna run a con
on the south side here
weve got a year-old
florida warrant on him
but it a thin beef
he can beat it in court
unless we catch him cold
all we want you to do
is pick up hooker for us
why dont you
pick him up yourself
because if word gets out
that the feds are in on it
gondorff will fold up
the whole thing
wouldnt that be too bad
then youd have to move out
of this nice office
youve got here
dont crack wise
with me flatfoot
i spent too much time
in dumps like this
eating gondorff dust
while you guys in
the bunco squads get rich
tipping him off
that not gonna
happen this time
were not gonna tell
the police were here
you keep your mouth shut
and do a job

all youve got
to do is tell us
when he gonna
play his chump
we come in at the sting
make the pinch

ill chance it
okay if that the way
you want it
we might even provide you
with a little company
on your way up the river
that wife of luther coleman
snyder what was her name
alva
that it alva coleman
pretty fair grifter
in her time
snyder given us
quite a folder on her
nothing major by itself
but uh
put them all together it could
add up to a lot of years
you stink mister
dont be a sap
it not her i want
if youre too dumb
to save yourself
there no sense
dragging her down with you
it over hooker
you can save me
a lot of trouble
but im gonna
get henry gondorff
whether you
help me out or not
will you wait till
the chump is played
hell yes
we dont care about the mark
he deserves what he gets
i mean completely played
you come in before we beat him
and ill kill him
