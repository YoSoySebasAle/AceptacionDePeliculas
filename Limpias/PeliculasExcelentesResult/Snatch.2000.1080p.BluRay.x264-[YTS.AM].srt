
my name is turkish
funny name for an englishman
i know
my parents to be were on the same plane
when it crashed that how they met
they named me after
the name of the plane
not many people are
named after a plane crash
that tommy
he tells people
he was named after a gun
but i know he was really named after
a famous 9th century ballet dancer
known him for as long as i can
remember he my partner
doesnt mean we hold hands
or take walks
what it really means is i try to keep him
out of as much trouble as he inflicts on me
i give him a hard time
keeps him in check
but really he like my brother
what do i know about diamonds
im a boxing promoter
i was a happy boxing promoter
until a week ago and then
what do i know about diamonds
dont they come from antwerp
himy would you listen to this
do we have a choice
a lot of it wasnt
meant to be taken literally
it a nice story adam and eve
it bound with moral fiber
but asking a grown man
to believe it
what is it
well what is it
what you want i
should do drop my pants
okay go through
it a nice story
it just that just a story
catholic religion is based
on a mistranslation
enough already ruben
will you say something
listen to this are you
busy ill tell you the whole story
the septuagint scholars mistranslated
the hebrew word for young woman
into the greek word
for virgin
it was an easy mistake
to make
because there was only a subtle
difference in the spelling
so they came up
with a prophecy
behold the virgin shall
conceive and bear us a son
you understand this it was the word
virgin that caught people attention
it not every day a virgin
conceives and bears a son
but leave that for a
couple of hundred years to stew
and next thing you know you have
the holy catholic church
oy vay what are you saying
im saying just
because it written
doesnt make it so
gives them hope it not really
important whether it fact or fiction
people like to believe
i dont want to hear any more
anyway who is it
that were seeing
michael
hello

your plane leave

when you get to london
if you want a gun
call this number
boris
boris
he can get you anything
you need
is he allowed
to do that
it an unlicensed boxing match
it not a tickling competition
these lads are out
to hurt each other
what happening with
those sausages charlie

look at it how am i supposed
to run this thing from that
were gonna need
a proper office
i want a new one tommy
youre going to buy it for me
why me
well you know
about caravans
how that
you spent a summer in one which
means you know more than me
and i dont want to have me
pants pulled down over the price
what wrong with this one
oh nothing tommy
it tiptop
it just im not sure
about the color
it all arranged
you just got to pick it up
here an address

what happening with
them sausages charlie

youre a sensitive boy
tommy
fuck me hold tight
what that

no tommy there a gun
in your trousers
what a gun doing in your trousers
it for protection
protection from what
zee germans
what to stop it blowing your
bollocks off every time you sit down
where did you get it
boris the blade
you mean boris the sneaky
fucking russian
heavy isnt it
heavy is good
heavy is reliable
if it doesnt work
you can always hit him with it
boris the blade
or boris the bullet-dodger
as bent as the soviet sickle and
hard as the hammer that crosses it
apparently it just impossible
to kill the bastard
back to my partner tommy
tommy runs the other business
the slot machines
which keeps rain off our heads
and gloves on gorgeous hands
however tommy a little preoccupied
with protection at present
all right ill take it
there a reason for tommy
newfound enthusiasm for firearms
sooner or later in the unlicensed boxing
world you have to deal with that reason
brick top
if that not worth a bet
i dont know what is
he doesnt look bad does he
no he looks great
hell do you proud governor
you reckon that what people
should do for me gary do me proud
it what you deserve
mr pulford
pull your tongue out
of my arsehole gary
dogs do that
youre not a dog are you gary
no no im not
however
you do have all the
characteristics of a dog gary
all except loyalty
it rumored that his favorite means
of dispatch involves a stun gun
a plastic bag a roll of tape
and a pack of hungry pigs
youre a ruthless little cunt
liam ill give you that
but i got no time
for grouses
feed him to the pigs
errol
what the fuck are you
two looking at
if you got to deal with him you just
make sure you dont end up owing him
because then youre in his debt
which means youre in his pocket
and once youre in that
you aint ever coming out
i hear he a
good fighter so ill use him
ill be doing you a favor boy
what he means is
im doing him a favor
because everybody knows nobody
takes a dive in my fights unlike his
here errol i dont think
he likes me
you dont like me
do you boy
dont know what you mean
i do know i cant wait to get
out of here fuck me it stinks
i like my fights to finish prompt so we
can get out before the authorities find out
play your cards right
and ill sort you out
you can sort me out
by showing me out
it hard to make a living in the
boxing world so every now and then
you gotta do something that might
not agree with your principles
basically you have to forget
you got any
are they lancashire pigs
who the fuck is talking
to you boy
oh yeah tommy
brick top loves tommy
dont let me down
you dont want to let
me down do you boy
see you ringside
boris
franky-fucking-four fingers
has a diamond the size
of a fist
i have told you it in the
briefcase connected to his arm
i sent him to you
to buy a gun
what more do you want me
to do hit him for you
but dont you hit him either
americans cant know
it was russian
it will come back to me
so what should i do
boris youre my brother
so think like my brother
get somebody else
to steal that stone
i dont want it getting
back to me
and dont have him killed
it will raise suspicion
so dont use idiots

of days before he goes to new york

on tommy mind
if gorgeous doesnt wake up

and i like to look after me
ma it a fair deal take it
mickey youre lucky we arent worm
food after your last performance

a hack with two roof lights
right and she terrible partial
to the periwinkle blue boys
have i made myself
clear boys

to confer with my colleague
did you understand a single
word of what he just said
ill tell you what
im gonna do
fucker
ill bet you for it
youll what
hell bet you for it
what like tommy did last time
do me a favor
ill do you a favor
you have first bet
if i win i get a caravan
and the boys get
a pair of them shoes
if i lose
oh fuck it
ill do the fight for free
now the last thing i
really want to do is bet a pikey
however i dont really
have much of a choice
somehow ive got to get
him to fight but if i lose
well i dont even want
to think about losing
okay i reckon
the hare gets fucked
what proper fucked
you got that london
were on
okay ill fucking tell you
get those off me
ill tell you
who robbed your bookies
periwinkle blue
bye boys
who proper
fucked now then
there something
very wrong with this
it was us that wanted
to buy a caravan off of him
well why didnt you bust a
cap in his ass then tommy
mind you youd do more
damage if you threw it at him
what you saying
i cant shoot
oh no tommy i wasnt
saying you cant shoot
i know you cant shoot
what i was saying is that six-pound
piece of shit stuck in your trousers there
would do more damage
if you fed it to him
you saying the
gun dont work
you tried it
whoops
i want to see that
sneaky fucking russian
what has he got a tea
cozy on his head for
to keep his head warm
what happened to him
he got shot in the face lincoln
i thought that was obvious
whatd you do that for did
you mistake him for a rabbit
what do you want me to do about it
sort it out
im not a fucking witch doctor
but you are a bad boy yardie
and bad boy yardies are supposed
to know how to get rid of bodies
i create the bodies
i dont erase the bodies
looks like
were in governor
goody gumdrops
get us a cup of tea
would you errol
grab hold of his legs
what do you think im gonna
grab him by his fucking ears
hope this is not
a bad moment
do you know who i am
i do
good that will save me
some time then
well i dont
youre always gonna have problems
lifting a body in one piece
apparently the best thing to do
is cut up a corpse into six pieces
and pile it all together
would someone
mind telling me
who are you
and when you got your six
pieces you gotta get rid of them
because it no good leaving it in the deep
freeze for your mum to discover now is it
then i hear the best thing
to do is feed them to pigs
you gotta starve the pigs
for a few days
then the sight of a chopped-up body
will look like curry to a pisshead
you gotta shave
the heads of your victims
and pull the teeth out
for the sake of the
piggies digestion
you could do this afterwards
of course
but you dont want to sieving
through pigshit now do you
they will go
through bone like butter
you need at least 6 pigs to
finish the job in one sitting
so be wary of any man
who keeps a pig farm
they will go through a body
that weighs 200 pounds
in about eight minutes
that means that a single pig
can consume two pounds
of uncooked flesh
every minute
hence the expression
as greedy as a pig
well thank you for that
that a great weight off me mind
now i mean if you wouldnt mind
telling me who the fuck you are
apart from someone who feeds
people to pigs of course
do you know what
nemesis means
a righteous infliction
of retribution
manifested by an
appropriate agent
personified in this case
by a horrible cunt
me
gentlemen
why cant you find
me franky doug
avi what do you want me to
do im not a bounty hunter
what about tony
you know bullet-tooth tony
who bullet-tooth-
tony
you silly fuck
he a liability
hell find you moses and the
burning bush if you pay him to
you are gonna die tony
he got shot six times
had the bullets molded into gold
i shoot you you go down
yeah he got two in his teeth that
dad did for him so he loves dad
why dont you fucking die
he the best chance
you got of finding franky
six times
in one sitting
youre in trouble now
well that sounds promising
what are we waiting for
bonjour

that so fucking important
mr pulford why do you
think weve got a dead man
missing an arm in our office

and i will get you a stone the size
of a fucking home i kid you not

question errol

wanker the lads cant lift him
forty-eight hours
after that it your family

might not think youre so fucking funny
not when theyre putting out
flames on their children backs
now get up and have
a fucking fight
three rounds and youre
a vegetable arent you pikey
im in charge here no
fucking about no eye-gouging
do your worst
let get it on
what the fuck going on

give me that fucking shooter
and hey presto

so what do you do
something very silly
you freeze and your life
doesnt flash before you
because youre too
fucking scared to think
you just freeze
and pull a stupid face
but the pikey didnt why
because he had plans
on running the car over
it had previously occurred to me
that the gypsy had taken the
demise of his mother rather lightly
for every action
there is a reaction
and a pikey reaction
is quite a fucking thing
pete talk to me
if you want your friend to hear you
talk a lot louder than that
give me that
fucking shooter
ill give you your shooter
you cunt
that is when i thought the
pikey had money riding on himself
that the reason the bastard never
goes down when he supposed to
weve been tucked up
while he been cleaning up
were worse off now than
when we started
the next day we went
to the campsite
but the gypsies had
disappeared during the night
which was probably a good thing
considering theyd just buried
2 people somewhere in the area
where is he
he aint fucking here
that for sure
we cant ask a man to fight for
us if we cant find him can we
you wont find a pikey that doesnt
want to be found tommy
he could be in a campsite
in kampu-fucking-chea by now
bollocks come on
what you doing here
what it got to do with you
so what you doing here
im taking the dog for a walk
what the problem
what in the car
seats and a steering wheel
what do you know about gypsies
i know theyre
not to be trusted
all right get your dog
on your way
get the dog tommy
aye
the dog
all right boy come on
come on daisy no daisy
he loves that dog
always playing silly games
stop messing about tommy
and get it in the car tommy
good boy good boy
good boy daisy good boy
could you tell me
why you got a dead man with
an arm missing in your boot
hey george
is that a tea cozy
on his head
oh you love a dog
dont you tommy
tommy persuaded
me to keep the dog
i eventually agreed
as long as he took it to a vet
i couldnt stand
that squeaking anymore
the vet found half an
undigested shoe a squeaky toy
and an 84-karat diamond
lodged in its stomach
it quite amazing what
can happen in a week
still didnt shut it up though
so what do you do
you go see the man that knows
about these sort of things
so what do you think
do you know anyone
whod be interested
i might
