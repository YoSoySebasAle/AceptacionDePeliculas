research facility
have denied the rumor
that a case of missing plutonium
was in fact stolen from their vault
two weeks ago
a libyan terrorist group had claimed
responsibility for the alleged theft
however officials now attribute
the discrepancy to a simple clerical error
the fbi which is investigating
the matter had no comment

with calling a boy
i think it terrible
girls chasing boys
when i was your age
i never chased a boy or called a boy
or sat in a parked car with a boy
then how am i ever supposed
to meet anybody
well itll just happen
like the way i met your father
that was so stupid
grandpa hit him with the car
it was meant to be
anyway
if grandpa hadnt hit him
then none of you would have been born
yeah well

doing in the middle of the street
what was it george
bird-watching
what lorraine

anyway your grandpa hit him
with the car
and brought him into the house
he seemed so helpless
like a little lost puppy
and my heart just went out to him
yeah mom we know
youve told us this story a million times
you felt sorry for him
you decided to go with him
to the fish under the sea dance
no no it was the enchantment
under the sea dance
our first date
ill never forget it
it was the night of that terrible
thunderstorm remember george
your father kissed me
for the first time on that dance floor
it was then that i realized
that i was going to spend
the rest of my life with him

good evening
im dr emmett brown
im standing on the parking
lot at twin pines mall
it saturday morning
october 26 985 8 am
and this is temporal experiment
number one
come on einie
hey hey boy get in there
that a boy
in you go sit down
put your seat belt on
that it
ok
please note
that einstein clock
is in precise synchronization
with my control watch
got it
right check doc
good
have a good trip einstein
watch your head
you got that thing hooked up
to the car
watch this
yeah ok
got it
jesus
not me
the car
if my calculations are correct
when this baby hits 88 miles per hour
youre going to see some serious shit
watch this
watch this
what did i tell you
88 miles per hour
the temporal displacement occurred
exactly 20 am and 0 seconds
jesus christ
jesus christ doc
you disintegrated einstein
calm down
i didnt disintegrate anything
the molecular structure of both einstein
and the car are completely intact
then where the hell are they
the appropriate question is
when the hell are they
you see einstein has just become
the world first time traveler
i sent him into the future
one minute into the future to be exact
at precisely 2 am and 0 seconds
we shall catch up
with him and the time machine
wait a minute
wait a minute doc
are you telling me that
you built a time machine
out of a delorean
the way i see it
if youre going to build a time machine
into a car why not do it with style
besides the stainless-steel construction
made the flux dispersal
look out
what what is it hot
it cold damn cold
einstein you little devil
einstein clock is exactly one minute
behind mine and still ticking
he alright
he fine
he completely unaware
that anything happened
as far as he concerned
the trip was instantaneous
that why his watch is
exactly one minute behind mine
he skipped over that minute to instantly
arrive at this moment in time
come here
ill show you how it works
alright
first
you turn the time circuits on
this readout tells
you where youre going
this one tells you where you are
this one tells you where you were
you input your destination time
on this keypad
say you want to see the signing
of the declaration of independence
or witness the birth of christ
here a red-letter date
in the history of science
november 5 955
yes of course
november 5 955
why i dont get it
ok what happened
that was the day i invented
time travel
i remember it vividly
i was standing on the edge of
my toilet hanging a clock
the porcelain was wet
i slipped hit my head on the sink
and when i came to
i had a revelation
a vision a picture in my head
a picture of this
this is what makes time travel possible
the flux capacitor
flux capacitor
it taken almost 30 years and my entire family
fortune to realize the vision of that day
my god has it been that long
things have certainly changed
around here
i remember when this was all farmland
as far as the eye could see
old man peabody owned all of this
he had this crazy idea
about breeding pine trees
this is
this is heavy-duty doc
this is great
does it run on regular
unleaded gasoline
unfortunately no it requires
something with a little more kick
plutonium
plutonium wait a minute
are you
are you telling me that
this sucker is nuclear
hey hey hey
keep rolling
keep rolling there
no no no no
this sucker electrical
but i need a nuclear reaction to generate
the 2 gigawatts of electricity i need
doc you dont just walk into
a store and buy plutonium
did you rip that off
of course
from a group of libyan nationalists
they wanted me to build them a bomb
so i took their plutonium and in turn gave them
a shoddy bomb casing full of used pinball machine parts
come on let get you a radiation suit
jesus
we must prepare to reload
it safe now
everything lead-lined
dont lose those tapes now
i need that as a record
let put this back here
there we go
almost forgot my luggage
who knows if they got
cotton underwear in the future
im allergic to all synthetics poducts

25 years in the future
ive always dreamed of seeing
the future looking beyond my years
seeing the progress of mankind

i know how that happened
you told me the whole story
you were standing on your toilet
and you were hanging a clock
and you fell and you hit
your head on the sink
that when you came up with
the idea for the flux capacitor
which is what makes
time travel possible
there something wrong with the starter
so i hid it here
after i fell off my toilet
i drew this
the flux capacitor
it works
it works
i finally invent something that works
you bet your ass it works
somehow weve got to sneak
this back to my laboratory
weve got to get you home
ok doc this is it
never mind that
never mind that now
why that me
look at me
im an old man
good evening
im dr emmett brown
im standing on the parking
lot at twin pines mall
thank god ive still got my hair
what on earth is this thing
im wearing
this is a radiation suit
radiation suit
of course
because of all the fallout
from the atomic wars
this is truly amazing
a portable television studio
no wonder your president has to be an actor
he gotta look good on television
this is it
this is the part coming up doc
no no no this sucker electrical
but i need a nuclear reaction
to generate the 2 gigawatts
what did i just say
this sucker electrical
but i need a nuclear reaction
to generate the 2 gigawatts
2 gigawatts
2 gigawatts
great scott
what the hell is a gigawatt
how could i have been so careless
2 gigawatts
tom how am i going
to generate that kind of power
it cant be done can it
doc look
all we need is a little plutonium
im sure that in 985
plutonium is available
in every corner drugstore
but in 955 it a little hard
to come by
marty im sorry
but im afraid youre stuck here
doc stuck here i cant i cant be
stuck here i got a life in 985
i got a girl
is she pretty
doc she beautiful
she crazy about me
look at this
look what she wrote here doc
i mean that says it all
doc youre my only hope
marty im sorry but the only
power source capable of generating
2 gigawatts of electricity
is a bolt of lightning
what did you say
a bolt of lightning
unfortunately you never know when
or where it ever going to strike
we do now
this is it
this is the answer
it says here
that a bolt of lightning
is going to strike the clock tower
at precisely 004 pm
next saturday night
if we could somehow
harness this lightning
channel it into the flux capacitor
it just might work
next saturday night
were sending you back to the future
ok alright
saturday good saturday good
i can spend a week in 955
i can hang out
you can show me around
marty that is completely out
of the question
you must not leave this house
you must not see anybody
or talk to anybody
anything you do can have serious
repercussions on future events
do you understand
yeah sure ok
marty
have you interacted with anybody
else today besides me
yeah well i mightve sort
of bumped into my parents
great scott
let me see that photograph
again of your brother
just as i thought
this proves my theory
look at your brother
his head gone
it like it been erased
erased from existence
they really cleaned this place up
looks brand-new
now remember
according to my theory you interfered
with your parents first meeting
if they dont meet
they wont fall in love
they wont get married
and they wont have kids
that why your older brother
disappearing from that photograph
your sister will follow and unless
you repair the damage youll be next
sounds pretty heavy
weight has nothing to do with it
which one your pop
that him
ok ok you guys
very funny
you guys are being real mature
maybe you were adopted
ok real mature guys
ok pick up my books
mcfly
that strickland
jesus didnt that guy ever have hair
shape up man
youre a slacker
do you want to be a slacker
for the rest of your life
no
what did your mother
ever see in that kid
i dont know doc
come on
i guess she felt sorry for him
because her dad hit him with the car
hit me with the car
that the florence
nightingale effect
it happens in hospitals when nurses
fall in love with their patients
go to it kid
hey george buddy
i have been looking all over for you
you remember me the guy who
saved your life the other day
yeah
good
there somebody
id like you to meet
lorraine
calvin
id like you to meet my good friend
george mcfly
hi
it really a pleasure to meet you
how your head
good fine
ive been so worried about you
ever since you ran off the other night
are you ok
yeah
im sorry
i have to go
come on
isnt he a dreamboat
doc she didnt even look at him
this is more serious than i thought
apparently your mother is amorously
infatuated with you instead of your father
wait wait a minute doc
are you trying to tell me that my mother
has got the hots for me
precisely
this is heavy
there that word again heavy
why are things so heavy in the future
is there a problem with the
earth gravitational pull
what
the only way were going to get those two to
successfully mate is if theyre alone together
so youve got to get your father
and mother to interact
some some sort of social
what you mean like a date
right
what kind of date
i dont know
what do kids do in the 50s
what theyre your parents
you must know them
what are their common interests
what do they like to do together
nothing
look
there a rhythmic ceremonial
ritual coming up
of course the enchantment
under the sea dance
theyre supposed to go to this
that where they kiss for the first time
alright kid
you stick to your father like glue
and make sure he takes
her to that dance
george buddy
remember that girl
i introduced you to
lorraine
what are you writing
stories
science fiction stories about
visitors
coming down to earth
from other planets
get out of town
i didnt know you did
anything creative
well let me read some
no no no no
i never i never let
anybody read my stories
why not
well what if they didnt like them
what if they told me i was no good
i guess that would be pretty
hard for somebody to understand
no
no not hard at all
so anyway george
about lorraine
she really likes you
she told me to tell you
that she wants you to ask her
to the enchantment
under the sea dance
really
oh yeah
all you got to do is go
over there and ask her
what right here right now
in the cafeteria
what if she said no
i dont know if i could take
that kind of a rejection
besides
i think shed rather go
with somebody else
who
biff
dont kid around
come on
im gonna leave
you want
you know you want
you know you want me
to give it to you
shut your filthy mouth

doc
hi marty
i didnt hear you come in
fascinating device
this video unit
listen doc
you know there is something i havent told you
about the night we made that tape
please marty dont tell me
no man should know too much
about his own destiny
you dont understand
i do understand
if i know too much about
my own future
i can endanger my own existence
just as youve endangered yours
youre right
now
let me show you my plan
for sending you home
please excuse the crudity of this model
i didnt have time to build
it to scale or paint it
it good
thank you thank you
ok now
we run some industrial strength electrical
cable from the top of the clock tower
down suspending it over the street
between these two lamp posts
meanwhile weve outfitted the time
vehicle with this big pole and hook
which runs directly into
the flux capacitor
at the calculated moment
you start off
from down the street driving directly toward
the cable accelerating to 88 miles per hour
according to the flyer at precisely
004 pm this saturday night
lightning will strike the clock tower
electrifying the cable
just as the connecting hook makes contact
thereby sending 2 gigawatts
into the flux capacitor
and sending you back to 985
alright now
watch this
you wind up the car and release it
ill simulate the lightning
ready
set
release
youre instilling me with
a lot of confidence doc
dont worry
ill take care of the lightning
you take care of your pop
by the way what happened today
did he ask her out
i think so
what did she say
it your mom
she tracked you down
quick
let cover the time machine
hi cal
marty
mom
lorraine
how did you know i was here
i followed you
this is my doc
my uncle
doc brown
hi
hi
marty listen
this may seem a little forward
but i was kind of wondering if you
if if youd ask me to the
enchantment under
the sea dance on saturday
you mean
you mean nobody asked you
no
not yet
what about
what about george
george mcfly
he kind of cute and all but not
well
i think a man should be strong
so he can stand up for himself
and protect the woman he loves
dont you
yeah
i still dont understand
how am i supposed to go
to the dance with her
if she already going
to the dance with you
well because george
she wants to go with you
she just doesnt know it yet
that why we got to show her that you
george mcfly are a fighter
youre somebody who
gonna stand up for yourself
somebody who gonna protect her
yeah but ive never picked
a fight in my entire life
look youre not going
to be picking a fight dad
dad dad daddy-o
youre coming to her rescue right
ok let go over the plan again
855 where are you going to be
im going to be at the dance
right
and where am i going to be
youre gonna be in the car with her
right ok
so right around 900
she going to get very
angry with me
why is she going
to get angry with you
well because george
nice girls get angry
when guys take advantage of them
you mean youre going
to go touch her on her
no no george
look
it just an act right
ok so 900 youre strolling
through the parking lot
you see us struggling in the car
you walk up
you open the door and you say
your line george
hey you get your damn hands off her
you really think i ought to swear
yes definitely
god damn it george swear
ok so now
you come up
you punch me in the stomach
im out for the count right
and you and lorraine live
happily ever after
you make it sound so easy
i just
i wish i wasnt so scared
george there is nothing to be scared of
all it takes is a little self-confidence
you know if you put your mind to it
you can accomplish anything
hill valley area weather
this saturday night
mostly clear
with some scattered clouds
lows tonight in the upper 40s
are you sure about this storm
since when can weathermen
predict the weather
let alone the future
you know marty im going
to be very sad to see you go
youve really made
a difference in my life
youve given me something
to shoot for
just knowing that im going
to be around to see 985
that im going to succeed in this
that im going to have a chance
to travel through time
it going to be really hard waiting
30 years before i can talk to you
about everything that happened
in the past few days
im really going to miss you marty
im really going to miss you
doc about the future
no
marty
weve already agreed that having information
about the future can be extremely dangerous
even if your intentions are good
it can backfire drastically
whatever youve got to tell me
ill find out through the
natural course of time
dear dr brown
on the night that i go back in time
you will be
shot by terrorists
please take whatever
precautions are necessary
to prevent this terrible disaster
your friend
marty
evening dr brown
what with the wire
oh just
a little weather experiment
what you got under here
no
dont touch that
some new specialized
weather sensing equipment

just a second

the same time
itll be like you never left
now
i painted a white line
on the street way over there
that where youll start from
ive calculated the precise distance
taking into account
the acceleration speed
and wind resistance retroactive
from the moment the lightning strikes
which will be in exactly
7 minutes and 22 seconds
when this alarm goes off
you hit the gas
right
well
i guess that everything
thanks
thank you
see you in about 30 years
i hope so
dont worry
as long as you hit that wire
with the connecting hook at
precisely 88 miles an hour
the instant the lightning strikes
the tower
everything will be fine
right
what the meaning of this
youll find out in 30 years
it about the future isnt it
it information about the future
