mama named me after
the great civil war hero
general nathan bedford forrest
she said we was related to him
in some way
and what he did was
he started up this club called
the ku klux klan
theyd all dress up in theirrobes
and their bed sheets
and act like a bunch of ghosts
or spooks or something
theyd even put bed sheets
on their horses and ride around
and anyway that how i got my name

was to remind me that sometimes
we all do things that

explaining things
so i could understand them
we lived about a quarter mile
off route 7
about a half mile from
the town of greenbow alabama
that in the county of greenbow
our house had been in mama family
since her grandpa grandpa grandpa
had come across the ocean
about 000 years ago
something like that
since it was just me and mama
and we had all these empty rooms
mama decided to let those rooms out
mostly to people passing through
like from oh mobile
montgomery places like that
that how me and mama got money
mama was a real smart lady

her mama had gone up to heaven
when she was five
and her daddy was
some kind of a farmer

he had the police say jenny didnt
have to stay in that house no more
she went to live with her grandma
just over on creekmore avenue
which made me happy
cause she was so close
some nights jenny would sneak out
and come on over to my house
just cause she said she was scared
scared of what i dont know
but i think it was her grandma dog
he was a mean dog
anyway jenny and me was best friends

all cheering
forrest now maybe it just me
but college was very confusing times
federal troops enforcing a court order
integrated the university
of alabama today
two negroes were admitted
but only after governor george wallace
had carried out his symbolic threat
to stand in the school house door
katzenbach governor wallace
i take it from that statement that
earl what going on
coons are trying to get into school
coons
when raccoons try to get
on our back porch
mama just chase them off with a broom
not raccoons you idiot niggers
and they want to go to school with us
with us they do
reporter shortly after governor
wallace had carried out his promise
to block the doorway
president kennedy
ordered the secretary of defense
then to use military force
here by videotape
is the encounter by general graham
commander of the national guard
and governor wallace
because these national guardsmen
are here today
as federal soldiers for alabamans
they live within our borders
they are all our brothers
we are winning in this fight
because we are awakening
the american people
to the dangers that we have spoken
about so many times
just so evident today the trend towards
military dictatorship in this country
reporter and so at day end
the university of alabama
in tuscaloosa had been desegregated
and students jimmy hood
and vivian malone
had been signed up
for summer classes
maam you dropped your book
maam
huntley governor wallace did what
he promised to do
by being on the tuscaloosa campus
he kept the mob from gathering
say wasnt that gump
nah that couldnt be
it sure as hell was
forrest a few years later
that angry little man
at the school house door
thought it would be a good idea
and ran for president
gunshots firing
but somebody thought that it wasnt
but he didnt die
my bus is here
is it the number nine
no it the number four
it was nice talking to you
i remember when that happened
when wallace got shot
i was in college
did you go to a girls college
or to a girls-and-boys-together college
it was co-ed
cause jenny went to a college
i couldnt go to
it was a college just for girls
but id go and visit her
every chance i got
jenny exclaims

reporter president kennedy met
with the collegiate
all-american football team
at the oval office today

louise he here
forrest now when i got home
i had no idea
but mama had had all sorts of visitors
weve had all sorts of visitors forrest
everybody wants you
to use their ping-pong stuff
one man even left a check for $25000
if youd be agreeable to saying
you liked using their paddle
oh but mama
i only like using my own paddle
hi miss louise
hey forrest
i know that i know that
but it $25000 forrest
i thought maybe you could hold it
for a while see if it grows on you
oh you look good forrest
that mama she sure was right
you look real good
it funny how things work out
i didnt stay home for long
because id made a promise to bubba
and i always try to keep my promise
so i went on down to bayou la batre
to meet bubba family
and make their introduction
are you crazy or just plain stupid
stupid is as stupid does mrs blue
i guess
and of course
i paid my respect to bubba himself
hey bubba it me forrest gump
i remember everything you said
and i got it all figured out
im taking the $24562
and 47 cents that i got
or that left after a new hair cut
and a new suit
and i took mama out
to a real fancy dinner
and i bought a bus ticket
and three dr peppers
tell me something
shrimper are you stupid
or something
stupid is as stupid does sir
well that what left after me saying
when i was in china
on the all-america ping-pong team
i just loved playing ping-pong with
my flex-o-light ping-pong paddle
which everybody knows isnt true
but mama says it just a little white lie
so it wouldnt hurt nobody
so anyway im putting all that on gas
ropes and new nets
and a brand-new shrimping boat
now bubba had told me everything
he knew about shrimping
but you know what i found out
shrimping is tough
i only caught five
a couple more
you could have yourself a cocktail
chuckling
hey you ever think
about naming this old boat
it bad luck
to have a boat without a name
id never named a boat before
but there was only one i could think of
the most beautiful name
in the wide world
getdown tonight playing
now i hadnt heard from jenny
in a long while
but i thought about her a lot
and i hoped that whatever
she was doing made her happy
i thought about jenny all the time
laughs
hey
lieutenant dan
what are you doing here
well thought id try out my sea legs
but you aint got no legs
lieutenant dan
yes i know that
you wrote me a letter you idiot
well well captain forrest gump

that where were going
to find those shrimp my boy
that where well find them
still no shrimp lieutenant dan
okay so i was wrong
how are we going to find them
well maybe you should
just pray for shrimp
singing gospel music
forrest
so i went to church every sunday
sometimes lieutenant dan came too
though i think
he left the praying up to me
no shrimp
where the hell this god of yours
it funny lieutenant dan said that
cause right then god showed up
dan youll never sink this boat
now me i was scared
but lieutenant dan he was mad
come on
you call this a storm
come on you son of a bitch
it time for a showdown you and me
im right here come and get me
cackling
youll never sink this boat
hurricane carmen
came through here yesterday
destroying nearly everything in its path
and as in other towns
up and down the coast
bayou la batre
entire shrimping industry
has fallen victim to carmen
and has been left in utter ruin
speaking with local officials
this reporter has learned
in fact only one shrimping boat
actually survived the storm
louise louise there forrest
forrest after that
shrimping was easy
since people still needed
them shrimps for shrimp cocktails
and barbecues and all
and we were the only boat left standing
bubba-gump shrimp what they got
we got a whole bunch of boats
2 jennys
a big old warehouse we even have
hats that say bubba-gump on them
bubba-gump shrimp
it a household name
hold on there boy
are you telling me youre the owner of
the bubba-gump shrimp corporation
yes sir we got more money
than davy crockett
laughing
boy i heard some whoppers in my time
but that tops them all
we was sitting next to a millionaire
well i thought it was a very lovely story
and you tell it so well
with such enthusiasm
would you like to see
what lieutenant dan looks like
well yes i would
that him right there
and let me tell you something
about lieutenant dan
forrest
i never thanked you for saving my life
forrest he never actually said so
but i think he made his peace with god
gunshots firing
for the second time in 7 days
president ford escaped
possible assassination today
margo base to jenny
base to jenny
jenny  go margo
forrest has a phone call
yeah well youll have to tell them
to call him back
he is indisposed at the moment
his mama sick
where mama
she upstairs
hi forrest
doctor ill see you tomorrow
all right
we sure got you straightened out
didnt we boy
what the matter mama
im dying forrest
come on in sit down over here
why are you dying mama
it my time
it just my time
now dont you be afraid sweetheart
death is just a part of life
something were all destined to do
i didnt know it
but i was destined to be your mama
i did the best i could
you did good mama
well i happen to believe
you make your own destiny
you have to do the best
with what god gave you
what my destiny mama
youre going to have
to figure that out for yourself
life is a box of chocolates forrest
you never know
what youre going to get
mama always had a way of explaining
things so i could understand them
i will miss you forrest
she had got the cancer
and died on a tuesday
i bought her a new hat
with little flowers on it
and that all i have to say about that
didnt you say you were waiting
for the number seven bus
therell be another one along shortly
now because i had been a football star
and a war hero
and a national celebrity
and a shrimping boat captain
and a college graduate
the city fathers of greenbow alabama
decided to get together
and offered me a fine job
so i never went back to work
for lieutenant dan
though he did take care
of my bubba-gump money
he got me invested
in some kind of fruit company
and so then i got a call from him saying
we dont have to worry about money
no more and i said
that good one less thing
singing gospel music
now mama said there only
so much fortune a man really needs
and the rest is just for showing off
so i gave a whole bunch of it
to the foursquare gospel church
and i gave a whole bunch to the
bayou la batre fishing hospital
and even though bubba was dead
and lieutenant dan said i was nuts
i gave bubba mama bubba share
you know what
she didnt have to work
in nobody kitchen no more
that smells wonderful
and cause i was a gazillionaire
and i liked doing it so much
i cut that grass for free
but at night time
when there was nothing to do
and the house was all empty
id always think of jenny
and then she was there
hello forrest
hello jenny
jenny came back and stayed with me
maybe it was because
she had nowhere else to go
or maybe it was because she was
so tired cause she went to bed
and slept and slept
like she hadnt slept in years
it was wonderful having her home
every day wed take a walk and
id jabber on like a monkey in a tree
and shed listen about ping-ponging
and shrimping
and mama making a trip up to heaven
i did all the talking
jenny most of the time was real quiet
how could you do this
crying
sometimes i guess there
just arent enough rocks
i never really knew why she came back
but i didnt care
it was like olden times
we was like peas and carrots again
every day id pick pretty flowers
and put them in her room for her
and she gave me the best gift anyone
could ever get in the wide world
new shoes
they make them just for running
and she even showed me how to dance
and well we was like family
jenny and me
and it was the happiest time in my life
man on tvand this fourth is
witnessing one of the
largest fireworks displays
in the nation
you done watching it
here in new york harbor
im going to bed
with a spectacular display
of tall ships earlier
the statue of liberty
will you marry me
id make a good husband jenny
you would forrest
but you wont marry me
you dont want to marry me
why dont you love me jenny
im not a smart man
but i know what love is
jenny
forrest i do love you
where are you running off to
im not running
that day for no particular reason
i decided to go for a little run
so i ran to the end of the road
and when i got there
i thought maybe id run
to the end of town
reporter president carter suffering
from heat exhaustion
fell into the arms of
forrest and when i got there
i thought maybe id just
run across greenbow county
and i figured since id run this far
maybe id just run across
the great state of alabama
and that what i did
i ran clear across alabama
for no particular reason
i just kept on going
i ran clear to the ocean
and when i got there
i figured since id gone this far
might as well turn around
and just keep on going
and when i got to another ocean
i figured since id gone this far
i might as well just turn back
and keep right on going
when i got tired i slept
when i got hungry i ate
when i had to go you know
i went
and so you just ran
yeah
running on empty playing
forrest id think a lot about mama
and bubba and lieutenant dan
but most of all i thought about jenny
i thought about her a lot
for more than two years now
a man named forrest gump
a gardener from greenbow alabama
stopping only to sleep
has been running across america
charles cooper brings us this report
for the fourth time
on his journey across america
forrest gump
the gardener from greenbow alabama
is about to cross
the mississippi river again today
ill be damned forrest
sir why are you running
why are you running
are you doing this for world peace
are you doing this for the homeless
are you running for women rights
or for the environment
or for animals
forrest they just couldnt believe
that somebody would do all that running
for no particular reason
reporter why are you doing this
i just felt like running
i just felt like running
it you i cant believe it really you
now for some reason what i was doing
seemed to make sense to people
i mean it was like an alarm
went off in my head you know
i said
here a guy that got his act together
here somebody
who got it all figured out
here somebody who has the answer
ill follow you anywhere mr gump
so i got company
and after that i got more company
and then even more people joined in
somebody later told me
it gave people hope
now now i dont know
anything about that
but some of those people
asked me if i could help them out
hey man hey listen i was wondering
if you might help me huh
listen im in the
bumper sticker business
and ive been trying
to think up a good slogan
and since you have been such a big
inspiration to the people around here
i thought you might
be able to help me jump into
whoa man you just ran through
a big pile of dog shit
it happens
what shit
sometimes
and some years later
i heard that that fellow
did come up with
a bumper sticker slogan
and he made a lot of money off of it
another time i was running along
somebody who had lost all his money
in the t-shirt business
he wanted to put my face on a t-shirt
but he couldnt draw that well
and he didnt have a camera
here use this one
nobody likes that color anyway
forrest have a nice day
well some years later
i found out that that man
did come up with an idea for a t-shirt
he made a lot of money off of it
anyway like i was saying
i had a lot of company
my mama always said
you got to put the past behind you
before you can move on
and i think that what
my running was all about
i had run for three years two months
4 days and 6 hours
quiet quiet
he going to say something
im pretty tired
think ill go home now
now what are we supposed to do
and just like that
my running days was over
so i went home to alabama
reporter moments ago at 225 pm
as president reagan was leaving the
gunshots firing
five or six gunshots were fired
by an unknown would-be assassin
the president was shot in the chest
and the assailant
i picked up the mail
and one day out of the blue clear sky
i got a letter from jenny
wondering if i could come down
to savannah and see her
and that what im doing here
she saw me on tv running

number nine bus to richmond street
and get off and go one block left
