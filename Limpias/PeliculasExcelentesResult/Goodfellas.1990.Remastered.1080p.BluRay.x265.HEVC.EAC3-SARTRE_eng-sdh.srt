stammering
he still alive you fucking piece of shit
die you motherfucker look at me
henry as far back as i can remember
i always wanted to be a gangster
to me
being a gangster was better than
being president of the united states
even before i first wandered
into the cabstand for an after-school job
i knew i wanted to be a part of them
it was there that i knew i belonged
to me it meant being somebody
in a neighbourhood full of nobodies
they werent like anybody else
they did whatever they wanted
they double-parked in front of a hydrant
nobody ever gave them a ticket
in the summer
when they played cards all night
nobody ever called the cops
men chattering
man tony stacks how are you
henry tuddy cicero
could this be the canarsie kid
how are you
good
henry tuddy
tuddy ran the cabstand
and the bella vista pizzeria
and other places for his brother paul
who was the boss of the neighborhood
laughing
paulie might have moved slow
but it was only because paulie
didnt have to move for anybody
it your fault
you started it
i started it it your fault
henry at first my parents loved
that i found a job
across the street from the house
my father who was irish
was sent to work at the age of
he liked that i got myself a job
he always used to say
that american kids were spoiled lazy
bye dad
bye
see you mikey
bye henry
henry mother henry watch how you cross
bring back milk
henry my mother was happy after
she found out that the ciceros
came from the same part of sicily
as she did to my mother
that was the answer to all her prayers
i was the luckiest kid in the world
i could go anywhere i could do anything
i knew everybody and everybody knew me
wiseguys would pull up
and tuddy would toss me their keys
and let me park their cadillacs
here i am this little kid
i cant even see over the steering wheel
and im parking cadillacs
but it wasnt too long
before my parents changed
their minds about my job at the cabstand
for your mother and sister
henry for them the cabstand was
supposed to be a part-time job but for me
it was definitely full-time
that all i wanted to do
people like my father could never
understand but i was a part of something
i belonged i was treated like a grown-up
tell him 59
henry every day i was learning to score
a dollar here a dollar there
i was living in a fantasy
men chattering
did you have a good day at school
henry my father was always pissed off
pissed that he made such lousy money
pissed that my kid brother michael
was in a wheelchair
he was pissed that there were seven of us
living in such a tiny house
tell me about this
it a letter from school
it says you havent been there in months
in months
henry mother screaming
youre a bum
want to grow up to be a burn
henry after a while he was mostly pissed
because i hung around the cabstand
he knew what went on at that cabstand
every once in a while id have to take
a beating but by then i didnt care
the way i saw it
everybody takes a beating sometime
i cant make any more deliveries
what youll fuck everything up
my dad says hell kill me look
come on with me
man is that him kid
henry no
man how about him
no
that the guy
get him
excuse me
scumbag
come here you piece of shit
know this kid
yeah
tuddy know where he lives
yeah
tuddy you deliver mail to his house
mailman yeah
tuddy from now on any letter from that
school to his house comes directly here
understand
mailman yeah
tuddy another letter from that school
goes to that kid house
in the fucking oven youll go head first
henry that was it no more letters from
truant officers no letters from school
in fact no more letters from anybody
finally after a few weeks my mother
went to the post office to complain
how could i go to school after that
and pledge allegiance to the flag
and sit through good government bullshit
paulie hated phones
he wouldnt have one in his house
mickey called want me to call him back
all right make the call
henry he got all his calls second hand
then youd have to call the people back
from an outside phone
got a nickel get him on the phone
henry there were guys that all they did
all day was take care of paulie calls
chattering
for a guy who moved all day long
paulie didnt talk to six people
if there was a union problem
or say a beef in the numbers
only the top guys could meet
with paulie to discuss the problem
everything was one-on-one
paulie hated conferences
he didnt want anybody hearing what he said
and he didnt want anybody listening
to what he was being told
hundreds of guys depended on paulie
he got a piece of everything they made
it was a tribute like in the old country
except they were doing it in america
all they got from paulie was protection
from other guys looking to rip them off
that what it all about that what
the fbi could never understand
what paulie and the organization does
is offer protection for people
who cant go to the cops that it
that all it is theyre like
the police department for wiseguys
glass shattering
people looked at me differently
and they knew i was with somebody
i didnt have to wait in line at the bakery
on sunday mornings for fresh bread
the owner knew who i was with
and hed come from around the counter
no matter how many were waiting
i was taken care of first
our neighbours didnt park
in our driveway anymore
even though we didnt have a car at 3
i was making more money than most
of the grown-ups around
i had more money than i could spend
i had it all
one day some neighborhood kids carried
my mother groceries all the way home
you know why
it was out of respect
hi mom what do you think
look at my shoes arent they great
my god
you look like a gangster
they shot me help
man yelling
tuddy henry shut the door
henry that was the first time
i had ever seen anyone shot
cant have that in here jesus christ
i cant have that in this joint
henry i remember feeling bad about the guy
but i also remember feeling
that maybe tuddy was right
i knew paulie didnt want
anybody dying in the building
youre a real jerk you wasted
eight fucking aprons on this guy
what the hell wrong with you
i got to toughen this kid up
henry it was a glorious time
and wiseguys were all over the place
it was before apalachin and before crazy joe
decided to take on a boss and start a war
it was when i met the world
and it was when i first met jimmy conway
he couldnt have been more than 28 or 29
at the time
but he was already a legend
hed walk in the door and everybody
who worked the room just went wild
hed give the doorman $00
just for opening the door
hed give hundreds to the dealers
and the guys who ran the games
the bartender got $00
just for keeping the ice cubes cold
the irishman is here
to take all you guineas money
want a drink
give me a 7 and 7
id like you to meet the kid henry
how you doing

henry jimmy was one of the most
feared guys in the city
he was first locked up at
and he was doing hits
for mob bosses when he was 6
see hits never bothered jimmy it was business
but what jimmy really loved to do
what he really loved to do was steal
he actually enjoyed it
jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted
for the bad guys in the movies
give me your wallet
you might know who we are
but we know who you are understand
henry he was one of
the city biggest hijackers
of booze cigarettes razor blades

what was coming in and moving out
if any truckers or airlines gave us trouble
paulie had the union people scare them
with a strike it was beautiful
it was a bigger moneymaker than numbers

every five minutes
if he was such a grown-up
why doesnt he get you two an apartment

what kind of people are these
what do you want me to do

did you know what they were like
your father never stayed out all night
without calling

you dont know how i feel
how do you feel now you dont know
where he is or who he with

leave him out of this he suffered enough
he hasnt digested a decent meal in six weeks
door slams
car approaches
dog barking
karen mother
where were you why didnt you call
we were worried to death
a married man does not stay out like this
normal people dont act like this
henry laughing
tommy what wrong with you
youre not normal she right
what wrong with you
what kind of person are you
what is the matter with you
what kind of people are they
karen we werent married to nine-to-five guys
but the first time i realized how different
was when mickey had a hostess party
karen where you from
lawrence
on the island it nice
im from miami you ever been there
it okay but it like you died
and woke up in jew heaven
angie stop picking at that thing
id like to smack his face
the red-haired guy looks like a farmer
the guy hands are all over me
so i told him keep your fucking hands
off me or ill cut them off
women laughing
she means it
you dont know how lucky he is
i just mention this to vinnie
how can you mention it vinnie would kill him
if i dont hell kill the miserable bastard
then vinnie will be there for life
you think you got problems
what about jeannie kid
he was in an argument a $0 card game
he pulls out a gun
the gun goes off some kid gets killed
when the grandmother hears it
and finds out he jailed she has a heart
attack and drops dead right on the spot
now jeannie has a husband and son
in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor
woman  jeannie drinks
woman 2 maybe she depressed
give me a break she drunk
as soon as something happens
you make them out to be saints
karen they had bad skin and wore too
much makeup they didnt look very good
they looked beat-up and the stuff they wore
was thrown together and cheap
a lot of pantsuits and double-knits
she spends her life in a nightgown
the woman is no angel believe me
karen they talked about their rotten kids
and about beating them
with broom handles and belts
and that the kids still didnt pay any attention
when henry picked me up i was dizzy
i dont know if i could live like that
god forbid what would happen
if you had to go to prison
henry karen
henry laughing
mickey said that jeannie husband--
do you know why jeannie husband
went to the can
because of jeannie
he wanted to get away from her
let me tell you something
nobody goes to jail unless they want to
unless they make themselves get caught
they dont have things organized
i know what im doing
ive got things organized with these guys
you know who goes to jail nigger
stickup men know why they get caught
because they fall asleep
in the getaway car karen
come on dont worry so much sweetie come here
karen after a while it got to be all normal
none of it seemed like crime
it was more like henry was enterprising
and that he and the guys made bucks
hustling while other guys
were sitting on their asses waiting for handouts
our husbands werent brain surgeons
they were blue-collar guys
the only way they could make real extra
money was to go out and cut corners
where the strong box you varmint
dont fucking move dont move
here your hat you fuck
man see you at the diner
tommy im riding shotgun
jimmy did you see him give it right over
tommy back to the hideout to split up the loot
yee-ha
karen we were all so very close
there were never any outsiders around
absolutely never
being together all the time made
everything seem all the more normal
man hello mrs hill police
im detective deacy this is detective
silvestri we have a search warrant
would you read and sign it
anywhere
silvestri yeah anywhere
deacy thisll take a while
we have to go through everything
you boys want some coffee
deacy no coffee now thanks
karen be careful
well just go about our business
karen there was always a little harassment
they wanted to talk to henry about this or that
theyd make me sign their subpoenas or warrants
but mostly they just wanted a handout
a few bucks to keep things quiet
no matter what they found
whistling
i always asked if they wanted coffee
some wives like mickey conway
used to curse at them and spit on the floor
she used to spit on her own floor
that never made any sense to me
it was better to be polite and call the lawyer
singing toot toot tootsie goodbye
guests singing happy birthday
karen we always did everything together
and we always were in the same crowd
anniversaries christenings
we only went to each other houses
the women played cards
when kids were born mickey and jimmy
were the first at the hospital
when we went to the islands
or vegas for vacation
we went together
no outsiders ever it got to be normal
it got to where i was proud
that i had the kind of husband
who was willing to risk his neck
just to get us the little extras
karen but i got mom to watch
the babies tomorrow night
cant do it karen karen why not

henry for most of the guys
killings were accepted
murder was the only way everybody stayed in line
you got out of line you got whacked
everybody knew the rules
sometimes even if people didnt
get out of line they got whacked
hits became a habit guys would get
into arguments over nothing
before you knew it one was dead
they were shooting each other all the time
shooting people was a normal thing
it was no big deal
we had a serious problem with billy batts
this was really a touchy thing
tommy killed a made guy
batts was part of the gambino crew
and was considered untouchable
before you touched a made guy
you had to have a good reason
you had to have a sit-down
and youd better get an okay
or youd be the one who got whacked
saturday night was for wives
but friday night at the copa
was for the girlfriends

now take me to jail
henry in prison dinner was always a big thing
we had a pasta course
and then we had a meat or a fish
paulie did the prep work
he was doing a year for contempt
and had this wonderful system
for doing the garlic
he used a razor
and he used to slice it so thin
that it used to liquefy in the pan
with just a little oil
it was a very good system
vinnie was in charge of the tomato sauce
man get the smell
vinnie three kinds of meat in the meatballs
veal beef and pork
man good but you gotta have the pork
that the flavor
henry i felt he used too many onions
but it was still a very good sauce
vinnie dont put too many onions in the sauce
vinnie i didnt put too much onions in paul
put three small onions that all i did
man three onions how many cans
of tomatoes you put in there
vinnie i put two big cans
man you dont need three onions
henry johnny dio did the meat
we had no broiler
so johnny did everything in pans
it used to smell up the joint something awful
and the hacks used to die
but he still cooked a great steak
how do you like yours vinnie medium rare
medium rare an aristocrat
henry you know when you think
of prison you get pictures in your mind
of all those old movies
with rows of guys behind bars
it wasnt like that for wiseguys
it really wasnt that bad
excepting that i missed jimmy
who was doing his time in atlanta
dio give me two steaks
while youre in there all right
henry everyone else in the joint was doing
real time mixed together living like pigs
but we lived alone we owned the joint
dio we batted them sons of bitches
you couldnt recognize them
good they deserved it
henry even the hacks we couldnt bribe
would never rat on the guys we did
dio had respect people loved one another

henry jimmy was cutting every link
between himself and the robbery
but it had nothing to do with me
i gave jimmy the tip and he gave me
some christmas money
from then on i kept my mouth shut
i knew jimmy he had the cash it was his
he kicked some money upstairs to paulie
but that was it
it made him sick to turn the money over
to the guys who stole it
hed rather whack them anyway what did i care
i wasnt asking for anything
and jimmy was making nice money
through my pittsburgh connections
still months after the robbery
they were finding bodies all over
when they found carbone in the meat truck
he was frozen so stiff
it took them two days
to thaw him out for the autopsy
still i never saw jimmy so happy
he was like a kid we had money
coming in through my pittsburgh people
and even after a while
the lufthansa thing began to calm down
what made jimmy so happy that morning
was that this was the day
that tommy was being made
jimmy was so excited
youd think he was being made
he must have made four calls to tommy house
they had a signal set up so hed know
the minute the ceremony was over
ma where are you
tommy mother here i am
youre home
home im leaving
you look lovely
i look good huh
you look wonderful be careful congratulations
i love you dont paint
any more religious pictures please
god be with you
bye ma
henry we always called each other goodfellas
youd say to somebody
youll like this guy he all right
he a goodfella one of us
you understand
we were goodfellas wiseguys
but jimmy and i could never be made
because we had irish blood
it didnt matter my mother was sicilian
to become a member of a crew
youve got to be 00% italian
so they can trace your relatives
back to the old country
it the highest honor they can give you
it means you belong to a family and a crew
it means nobody can fuck around with you
it also means you could
fuck around with anybody
just as long as they arent also a member
it like a license to steal
a license to do anything
tommy how many years ago since you were made
vinnie im an old-timer 30 years ago
tommy thirty years
brings back a lot of memories
pike peak was a pimple then wasnt it
henry as far as jimmy was concerned
with tommy being made
it was like we were all being made
we would now have one of our own as a member
tommy oh no--
who this
vinnie on phone this is vinnie
vinnie what happened
did we get straightened out
no we had a problem
we tried to do everything we could
what do you mean
you know what i mean he gone
and we couldnt do nothing about it
that it
what do you mean
he gone
that it
i knew it i cant fucking believe it
crying
what happened
they fucking whacked him
henry fuck
are you all right
henry it was revenge for billy batts
and a lot of other things
vinnie and that that
henry there was nothing we could do about it
batts was a made man and tommy wasnt
we had to sit still and take it
it was among the italians
it was real greaseball shit
they even shot tommy in the face
so his mother couldnt give him
an open coffin at the funeral
henry i was gonna be busy all day
i had to drop off some guns at jimmy
to match some silencers he had
i had to pick up my brother at the hospital
and drive him home
i had to pick up
some new pittsburgh stuff for lois
to fly down to some customers i had near atlanta
right away i knew he didnt want them
and id be stuck for the money
i only bought them because
he wanted them and now he didnt
what good are these none of them fit
what the matter with you
im not paying for it
henry i didnt say a thing jimmy was
so pissed off he didnt even say goodbye
stop the drugs theyre making
your mind into mush
you hear me
ill take them back
henry my pittsburgh guys always wanted guns
since i would see them in the afternoon
to pick up a delivery
i was pretty sure id get my money back
tires screeching

henry if youre part of a crew nobody
ever tells you theyre going to kill you
it doesnt happen that way
there arent any arguments
or curses like in the movies
your murderers come with smiles
they come as your friends
people who cared for you all your life
they always seem to come when youre
weakest and most in need of their help
so i met jimmy in a crowded place we both knew
i got there 5 minutes early
and jimmy was already there
he took the booth near the window
so he could see everyone who drove up
he wanted to make sure i wasnt tailed
he was jumpy he hadnt touched a thing
on the surface
everything was supposed to be fine
we were supposed to be discussing my case
but i had a feeling jimmy was trying
to sense if id rat on him to save my neck
i been telling you your whole life
dont talk on the phone
now you understand
it going to be okay
you got a good chance to beat the case
you know that kid from the city
we were talking about you know
the kid turned out to be a rat as soon as
he got pinched he ratted on everybody
i know where he is he hiding now
know what im saying
would you have a problem going
with anthony to take care of that
mm-mm
no not at all
that way they got nothing
henry jimmy had never asked me
to whack somebody before
but now he asking me to go to florida
and do a hit with anthony
that when i knew i would never
have come back from florida alive
whenever you move me
i asked once and ill tell you again
i dont want to go any place cold
you dont have a choice in that matter
come on whoever fucking controls it
just no place cold do that for me
im trying to--
he bronchial that why
if he legitimately bronchial
well consider that
id like to go some place not cold
can i ask you some questions
what about my parents
what about them
am i going to see them
am i going to talk to them
dont i have some kind of contact with them
no
wait a minute wait a minute
you mean to tell me that
god forbid something happens to my
parents they get sick i cant see them
maybe something can be worked out
if theyre sick
if there extraordinary circumstances--
i cant do this i cant do this henry
i cant leave my parents
excuse me karen i told you before
im not going to do this
unless you and the kids come with me
i cant do it without you
so you do whatever but that it
you need henry not me right
that right
frankly i dont care whether you go or not
if itll make him a better witness
id like you to be with him
they want henry not me
henryll be in the protection program
they cant get to him
they can only get to him
by getting to you or your kids
if he goes into the program youre in danger--
i dont know anything
dont give me
the babe-in-the-woods routine
ive listened to those wiretaps
and ive heard you talk about cocaine
conversation after conversation
you talked to henry on the phone
it doesnt matter whether he goes to jail
or stays on the streets and beats the case
he a dead man
he knows it and you know it
what about the kids and school
karen will they get left back
i mean what goes on
tuddy go to wall street and get real crooks
whoever sold you those suits
had a sense of humor
what it comes down to is
were your only salvation
well save your life and his life
and well keep you out of jail
this morning you told the jury
about your background
henry it was easy for us to disappear
my house was in my mother-in-law name
my cars were registered to my wife
my social security cards
and driver licenses were phonies
i never voted or paid taxes
my birth certificate and arrest sheet was
all youd ever have to know i was alive
attorney do you see him here in this courtroom
yes
attorney
will you please point him out for the jury
let the record reflect that mr hill
identified the defendant james conway
do you also know a man named paul cicero
do you see him in the courtroom
yes
attorney can you point him out for the jury
let the record reflect that mr hill
identified the defendant paul cicero
your honor i have a document
henry the hardest thing was leaving the life
i still love the life
we were treated like movie stars with muscle
we had it all just for the asking
our wives mothers kids everybody rode along
i had paper bags filled with jewelry
stashed in the kitchen
i had a sugar bowl full of coke next to the bed
people call them rats because rats do
anything to survive isnt that right
attorney objection
judge objection sustained
i know nothing about being a rat
you know everything about it
attorney objection your honor
in view of the violence
henry anything i wanted was a phone call away
free cars keys to a dozen hideout flats
all over the city
id bet $20000 $30000 over a weekend
then blow the winnings in a week
or go to the sharks to pay the bookies
it didnt matter
it didnt mean anything when i was broke
i would go out and rob some more
we ran everything
we paid off cops we paid off lawyers
we paid offjudges
everybody had their hands out
everything was for the taking
and now it all over
that the hardest part
today everything is different
there no action
i have to wait around like everyone else
cant even get decent food
after i got here i ordered spaghetti
with marinara sauce
and i got egg noodles and ketchup
im an average nobody
i get to live the rest of my life like a schnook
sdh
