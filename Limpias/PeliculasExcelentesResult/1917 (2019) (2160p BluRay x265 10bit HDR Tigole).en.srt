id like to keep it that way
sanders tells me
youre good with maps
that true
good enough sir
so
we are here
the 2nd devons
are advancing here
how long will it take you
to get there
i dont understand sir
sir that land
is held by the germans
germans have gone
dont get your hopes up
it appears to be
a strategic withdrawal
they seem to have
created a new line
nine miles back here
by the looks of it
colonel mackenzie
is in command of the 2nd
he sent word yesterday morning
he was going after
the retreating germans
he is convinced
he has them on the run
that if he can
break their lines now
he will turn the tide
he is wrong
colonel mackenzie
has not seen these aerials
of the enemy new line
come around here gentlemen
three miles deep
field fortifications defenses
artillery the like of which
weve never seen before
the 2nd are due
to attack the line
shortly after dawn tomorrow
they have no idea
what theyre in for
and we cant warn them
as a parting gift the enemy
cut all our telephone lines
your orders are to get
to the 2nd at croisilles wood
one mile southeast
of the town of écoust
deliver this
to colonel mackenzie
it is a direct order to call
off tomorrow morning attack
if you dont
it will be a massacre
we will lose two battalions
600 men
your brother among them
you think you can
get there in time
yes sir
any questions
no sir
good
over to you lieutenant
supplies gentlemen
map torches grenades and
uh a couple of little treats
leave immediately
take this trench west
up on sauchiehall street
then northwest on
paradise alley at the front
continue along the front line
until you find the yorks
give this note
to major stevenson
he holding the line at the
shortest span of no-man-land
youll cross there
itll be daylight sir
theyll see us
there no need to be concerned
you should meet no resistance
sir is is it just us
down to gehenna
or up to the throne
he travels the fastest
who travels alone
wouldnt you say lieutenant
yes sir i would
good luck
blake let talk about this
for a minute
why
blake
we just need to think about it
there nothing to think about
it my big brother
we should at least
wait until it dark
erinmore said
to leave immediately
erinmore
never seen no-man-land
we wont make it ten yards
if we just wait
you heard him
he said the boche have gone
is that why he gave us grenades
oy
watch where youre going
sorry
all im saying is that we wait
yes you would say that cause
it not your brother is it
look the last time i was told
the germans were gone
it didnt end well
you dont know blake
you werent there
excuse me excuse me
excuse me
youre going up the
down trench you bloody idiot
orders of the general sir
all right
say the boche have gone
nine miles will take us
what six hours
eight at the very most
so weve got time to wait
until the sun sets
it enemy territory
otherwise well be wide open
weve got no idea
what were walking into
blake if were not
clever about this
no one will get to your brother
i will
were here
this is the front line
now we need to find the yorks
sorry mate

what you lost your medal
heads down boys
come on lads keep digging
stay low
for god sake careful there
youre stepping on the dead
that our sergeant
be better washing them out of
this dugout with a bloody hose
do you know where the yorks are
the next bend
youll be standing
on top of half of them
shot to hell two nights ago
yorks
yes corp
where major stevenson
he was killed
couple of nights ago corporal
lieutenant leslie has command
where can we find him
next dugout
here
sir
lieutenant leslie sir
what is it
we have a message
from general erinmore
are you our relief
no sir
well when the fucking hell
are they due
we dont know sir but weve
got orders to cross here
that is the german front line
we know sir
if youll just take the letter
settle a bet
what day is it
friday
friday well well well
none of us was right
this idiot thought
it was tuesday
sorry sir
are they out of
their fucking minds
one slow night the brass think
the hun have just gone home
do you think theyre wrong sir
we lost an officer
and three men two nights ago
they were shot to bits
patching up wire
we dragged two of them
back here neednt bothered
sir the general is sure
the enemy have withdrawn
there are aerials
of the new line that
shut up
we fought and died
over every inch
of this fucking place
now they suddenly give us miles
it a trap
but chin up there a medal
in it for sure
nothing like a scrap of ribbon
to cheer up a widow
all right
where the nearest
way through sir
our wire a mess but there is
a path through of sorts
rushworth let him look
straight ahead to the left
past the dead horses
there a gap
directly behind them
useful because if it dark
you follow the stench
when you get to the second wire
look out for the bowing chap
there a small break
just beside him
the german line is
50-odd yards after that
watch out for the craters;
theyre deeper than they look
you fall in
there no getting out
this way
wake up kilgour
bloody waste of space
any cover sir
anywhere to jump off from
no the sap trench
was blown to hell weeks ago
it was full of bodies anyway
your best bet
is to pop over here
if you do get shot try to
make it back to the wire
we wont come after you
not till it dark
and if by some fucking miracle
you do make it
send up a flare
dont have any sir
well get him one kilgour
make yourself useful
yes sir
through this holy unction
may the lord
pardon you your faults
and whatever sins
thou has committed
i do hate losing these
to the hun
so when they start
shooting at you
could you be so kind
as to throw it back
there a good chap
cheerio
you sure
yes
age before beauty
you all right
look for cover
sap trench
stay still
theyre ours
keep going were halfway
there a gap in the wire

i never thought
it would be this
so do you want to go back

we should make it

i think they wanted us
to go that way
they wanted to bury us
you bastard rats
hey
did you hear that story
about wilko
how he lost his ear
im not in the mood
keep your eyes on the trees
top of the ridge
bet he told you it was shrapnel
what was it then
well you know his girl
a hairdresser right
and he was moaning about
the lack of bathing facilities
when he wrote to her
remember those
rancid jakes at arras
yeah
anyway she sends him over
this hair oil
smells sweet
like golden syrup
wilko loves the smell
but he doesnt want
to cart it around in his pack
so he slathers it all over
his barnet goes to sleep
and in the middle of the night
he wakes up
and a rat is sitting
on his shoulder
licking the oil off his head
wilko panics and he jumps up
and when he does the rat bites
clean through his fucking ear
and runs off with it
no
oh he made a hell of a fuss
yelling screaming
the best of it was he put
so much bloody oil on himself
that he couldnt wash it off
he was like a magnet
the rats left us alone
but they couldnt get
enough of him
poor bastard
heading back home
i wonder what they saw
watch the ridgelines
well that your medal
sorted then
what do you mean

rescuing a comrade
from certain death

bottle of wine

taken it home with you
you shouldve given it
to your family

take it home

any difference to anyone
