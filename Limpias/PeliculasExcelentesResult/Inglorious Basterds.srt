
chapter one
once upon a time
in nazi-occupied france
speaking french
go back inside and shut the door
julie get me some water
for my wash up
then get inside with your sisters
speaking french
ready papa
speaking french
thank you my darling
now you go inside
with your sisters
dont run
men speaking german
speaking french
is this the property
of perrier lapadite
i am perrier lapadite
it is a pleasure to meet
you monsieur lapadite
i am colonel hans landa of the ss
what can i do for you
i was hoping you could invite
me inside your home
and we may have a discussion
certainly after you
colonel landa this is my family
colonel hans landa of the ss
mademoiselle
at your service
the rumours i have
heard in the village
about your family are all true
each one of your daughters is
more lovely than the last
thank you
please
have a seat
suzanne would you be so good as
to get the colonel some wine
but no
merci beaucoup monsieur
lapadite but no wine
this being a dairy farm one would
be safe in assuming you have milk
yes
then milk is what i prefer
very well
julie would you mind
closing the window
thank you
monsieur to both your
family and your cows
i say bravo
thank you
please join me at your table
very well
monsieur lapadite
what we have to discuss would
be better discussed in private
youll notice i left
my men outdoors
if it wouldnt offend
them could you
ask your lovely ladies
to step outside
you are right
charlotte would you
take the girls outside
the colonel and i need
to have a few words
monsieur lapadite
i regret to inform you ive
exhausted the extent of my french
to continue to speak
it so inadequately
would only serve to embarrass me
however ive been led to believe
you speak english quite well
yes
well it just so happens i do as
well this being your house
i ask your permission
to switch to english
for the remainder of
the conversation
by all means
while im very familiar
with you and your family
i have no way of knowing if you
are familiar with who i am
are you aware of my existence
yes
this is good
now are you aware of the job ive
been ordered to carry
out in france
yes
please tell me what youve heard
ive heard
that the führer has
put you in charge
of rounding up the
jews left in france
who are either hiding
or passing for gentile
the führer couldnt have
said it better himself
but the meaning of your visit
pleasant though it is
is mysterious to me
the germans looked
through my house
nine months ago for hiding jews
and found nothing
im aware of that
ive read the reports
of this area
but like any enterprise
when under new management
there is always a slight
duplication of efforts
most of it being a
complete waste of
time but needs to be
done nevertheless
i just have a few questions
monsieur lapadite
if you can assist me with answers
my department can close
the file on your family
now
before the occupation there were
four jewish families in this area
all dairy farmers like yourself
doleracs rollins the loveitts
and the dreyfuses
is that correct
to my knowledge
those were the jewish families
among the dairy farmers
herr colonel would it disturb
you if i smoked my pipe
please monsieur lapadite
this is your house make
yourself comfortable
now according to these papers
all the jewish families in this
area have been accounted for
except the dreyfuses
somewhere in the last year it
would appear theyve vanished
which leads me to
the conclusion that
theyve either made
good their escape
or someone is very
successfully hiding them
what have you heard about the
dreyfuses monsieur lapadite
only rumours
i love rumours
facts could be so misleading
where rumours true or
false are often revealing
so monsieur lapadite
what rumours have you heard
regarding the dreyfuses
again this is just a rumour
but we heard the dreyfuses had
made their way into spain
so the rumours youve
heard have been of escape
agrees in french
yes
having never met the dreyfuses
would you confirm for me
the exact members of the
household and their names
there were five of them
the father jacob
wife miram
and her brother bob
how old is bob
thirty 3
continue
and the children
amos
and shosanna
ages of the children
amos was nine or 0
and shosanna
and shosanna was
8 or 9 im not really sure
well i guess that should do it
however before i go could i have
another glass of
your delicious milk
but of course
monsieur lapadite
are you aware of the nickname the
people of france have given me
i have no interest in such things
but you are aware of
what they call me
im aware
what are you aware of
thanking in french
that they call you
the jew hunter
precisely
i understand your trepidation
in repeating it
heydrich apparently
hates the moniker
the good people of prague
have bestowed on him
actually why he
would hate the name
the hangman is baffling to me
it would appear he has done
everything in his
power to earn it
now i on the other hand
love my unofficial title
precisely because ive earned it
the feature that makes me such an
effective hunter of the jews is
as opposed to most
german soldiers
i can think like a jew
where they can only
think like a german
more precisely a german soldier
now if one were to
determine what attribute
the german people
share with a beast
it would be the cunning and the
predatory instinct of a hawk
but if one were to determine what
attributes the jews
share with a beast
it would be that of the rat
the führer and
goebbels propaganda
have said pretty
much the same thing
but where our conclusions differ
is i dont consider the
comparison an insult
consider for a moment the
world a rat lives in
it a hostile world indeed
if a rat were to scamper through
your front door right now
would you greet it with hostility
i suppose i would
has a rat ever done
anything to you to
create this animosity
you feel toward them
rats spread disease
they bite people
rats were the cause of the bubonic
plague but that some time ago
i propose to you any disease
a rat could spread
a squirrel could equally carry
would you agree
agrees in french
yet i assume you dont share the
same animosity with squirrels
that you do with rats do you
no
yet theyre both
rodents are they not
and except for the tail they even
rather look alike dont they
it an interesting
thought herr colonel
however interesting as
the thought may be
it makes not one bit of
difference to how you feel
if a rat were to walk in here
right now as im talking
would you greet it with a
saucer of your delicious milk
probably not
i didnt think so
you dont like them
you dont really know why
you dont like them
all you know is you
find them repulsive
consequently a german
soldier conducts a search
of a house suspected
of hiding jews
where does the hawk look
he looks in the barn he looks in
the attic he looks in the cellar
he looks everywhere he would hide
but there are so
many places it would
never occur to a hawk to hide
however the reason the führer has
brought me off my alps in austria
and placed me in
french cow country
today is because it
does occur to me
because im aware what tremendous
feats human beings are capable of
once they abandon dignity
may i smoke my pipe as well
please herr colonel
make yourself at home
now my job dictates
that i must have my
men enter your home
and conduct a thorough search
before i can officially cross
your family name off my list
and if there are any
irregularities to
be found rest assured
they will be
that is unless you have
something to tell me
that makes the conducting
of a search unnecessary
i might add also
that any information
that makes the
performance of my duty
easier will not be
met with punishment
actually quite the contrary
it will be met with reward
and that reward will be
your family will cease to
be harassed in any way
by the german military
during the rest
of our occupation of your country
youre sheltering enemies
of the state are you not
yes
youre sheltering them underneath
your floorboards arent you
yes
point out to me the areas
where theyre hiding
since i havent heard
any disturbance
i assume while theyre listening
they dont speak english
yes
im going to switch
back to french now
and i want you to
follow my masquerade
is that clear
yes
speaking french
monsieur lapadite
i thank you for the milk
and your hospitality
i do believe our
business here is done
ah ladies
i thank you for your time
we shant be bothering
your family any longer
so monsieur
mademoiselle
i bid farewell to you and say
adieu
it the girl
goodbye shosanna
chapter two
inglourious basterds
ten-hut
my name is lieutenant aldo raine
and im putting together a special
team and i need
me eight soldiers
eight jewish american soldiers
now you all mightve
heard rumours
about the armada happening soon
well well be leaving
a little earlier
were going to be dropped into
france dressed as civilians
once were in enemy territory
as a bushwhacking guerrilla army
were going to be doing one
thing and one thing only
killing nazis
i dont know about you all
but i sure as hell
didnt come down
from the goddamn smoky mountains
cross 5000 miles of water fight
my way through half of sicily
and jump out of a
fucking aeroplane to
teach the nazis
lessons in humanity
nazi aint got no humanity
theyre the foot soldiers of a
jew-hating mass-murdering maniac
and they need to be destroyed
that why any and every son of a
bitch we find wearing
a nazi uniform
theyre going to die
now im the direct descendent
of the mountain man jim bridger
that means i got a
little indian in me
and our battle plan will be
that of an apache resistance
we will be cruel to the germans
and through our cruelty
they will know who we are
and they will find the
evidence of our cruelty
in the disembowelled dismembered
and disfigured bodies of their
brothers we leave behind us
and the german wont be
able to help themselves
but imagine the cruelty their
brothers endured at our hands
and our boot heels and
the edge of our knives
and the german will
be sickened by us
and the german will talk about us
and the german will fear us
and when the german closes
their eyes at night
and theyre tortured by their
subconscious for the
evil they have done
it will be with thoughts of us
that they are tortured with
sound good
yes sir
yes sir
that what i like to hear
but i got a word of warning for
all you would-be warriors
when you join my command
you take on debit
a debit you owe me personally
each and every man under my
command owes me 00 nazi scalps
and i want my scalps
and all you all will
get me 00 nazi scalps
taken from the heads
of 00 dead nazis
or you will die trying
shouting in german
no no no no no no no
how much more of these
jew swine must i endure
they butcher my men
like they were flies
do you know the latest
rumour theyve conjured up
in their fear-induced delirium
the one
that beats my boys with a bat
the one they call
the bear jew
is a golem
speaking german
my führer this is
just soldiers gossip
no one really believes
the bear jew is a golem
why not
they seem to be able to elude
capture like an apparition
they seem to be able to
appear and disappear at will
you want to prove theyre
flesh and blood
then bring them to me
i will hang them naked by their
heels from the eiffel tower
and then throw their
bodies in the sewers
for the rats of paris to feast
kliest
kliest speaking
german on intercom
yes my führer
i have an order i
want relayed to all
german soldiers
stationed in france
the jew degenerate known
as the bear jew
henceforth is never to be
referred to as the bear jew again
kliest speaking german
yes my führer
do you still wish to
see private butz
who and what is a private butz
he the soldier you
wanted to see personally
his squad was ambushed by
lieutenant raine jews
he was its only survivor
indeed i do want to see him
thank you for reminding me
send him in
butz speaking german
sergeant rachtmann ludwig and i
were the only ones left
alive after the ambush
while one man guarded us
the rest removed the hair
hey hirschberg
send that kraut sarge over
you go
sergeant werner rachtman
lieutenant aldo raine
pleased to meet you
you know what sit
down means werner
yes
then sit down
how is your english werner
because if need be
we got a couple
of fellows who can translate
wicki here
an austrian-jew got
the fuck out of
munich while the getting was good
became american got drafted come
back to give you all what for
another one up there you
might be familiar with
sergeant hugo stiglitz
heard of him
everybody in the german army
has heard of hugo stiglitz
the reason for hugo
stiglitz celebrity
among german soldiers is simple
as a german-enlisted man he
killed 3 gestapo officers
instead of putting him
up against a wall
the high command decided
to send him back to berlin
to be made an example of
needless to say once the
basterds heard about him
he never got there
sergeant hugo stiglitz
lieutenant aldo raine
these are the basterds
ever heard of us
we just want to say were
a big fan of your work
when it comes to killing nazis
i think you show great talent
and i pride myself for having
an eye for that kind of talent
but your status as a nazi
killer is still amateur
we all come here to see
if you want to go pro
can i assume you know who we are
youre aldo the apache
werner if you heard of us
you probably heard we aint in
the prisoner-taking business
we in the killing nazi business
and cousin business
is a-booming
oh yeah
now that leaves two ways
we can play this out
either kill you or let you go
whether or not youre going
to leave this ditch alive
depends entirely on you
up the road a piece
there an orchard
besides you we know
there another kraut
patrol fucking around
here somewhere
if that patrol were to
have any crack shots
that orchard would be a
goddamn sniper delight
so if you ever want to eat a
sauerkraut sandwich again
you got to show me on this
here map where they are
you got to tell me how many they
are and you got to tell me
what kind of artillery
theyre carrying with them
you cant expect me to
divulge information
that would put german
lives in danger
well now werner
that where youre
wrong because that
exactly what i expect
i need to know about
germans hiding in trees
and you need to tell me and
you need to tell me right now
now just take that
finger of yours
and point out on this here map
where this party is being held
how many is coming and what
they brought to play with
i respectfully refuse sir
hear that
yes
that sergeant donny donowitz
you might know him
better by his nickname
the bear jew
now if you heard of
aldo the apache you
got to have heard
about the bear jew
i heard of the bear jew
what did you hear
beats german soldiers with a club
he bashes their brains in with
a baseball bat what he does
and werner im going to ask
you one last goddamn time
and if you still
respectfully refuse
im calling the bear jew over
he going to take
that big bat of his
and he going to beat
your ass to death with it
now take your
wiener-schnitzel-licking finger
and point out on this map
what i want to know
fuck you
and your jew dogs
actually werner were all
tickled to hear you say that
quite frankly watching
donny beat nazis to death
is the closest we ever get to
going to the movies donny
yeah
got us a german here who
wants to die for country
oblige him
did you get that for killing jews
bravery
yeah
oh no
oh no
donny
yeah donny
about now id be shitting
my pants if i was you
teddy fucking williams
knocks it out of the park
fenway park is on its feet
for teddy fucking ballgame
he went yard on that one on
to fucking lansdowne street

damn it hirschberg
donny bring that other
one over here alive
get the fuck up batter
up youre on deck
two hits i hit you

english
speaking german
wicki

both speaking german

map the german position
speaking german

speaking german
how did you survive this ordeal
they let me go
now when you report
what happened here
you cant tell them
you told us what
you told us theyll shoot you
theyre going to want to know why
you so special we let you live
so tell them we let
you live so you
could spread the word
through the ranks
what going to happen
to every nazi we find
speaking german
you are not to tell anybody
anything not one word of detail
your outfit was ambushed
and you got away
not one word more
yes my führer
did they mark you like they
did the other survivors
yes my führer
now that youve
survived the war when
you get home what
you going to do
speaking german
i will hug my mother like
ive never hugged her before
he going to hug his mother
well aint that nice
ask if he going to
take off his uniform
wicki speaking german
butz speaking german
not only shall i remove it
but i intend to burn it
he going to burn it
yeah that what we
thought we dont like that
see we like our
nazis in uniforms
that way you can spot them
just like that
speaking german
but you take off
that uniform aint
nobody going to know you a nazi
and that dont sit well with us
speaking german
so im going to give you a little
something you cant take off
you know lieutenant youre
getting pretty good at that
you know how you get to
carnegie hall dont you
practise

a thousand rounds
of ammo in a bird nest
against three hundred
enemy soldiers
what a bird nest
a bird nest is what a sniper
would call a bell tower

three hundred and
sixty degree view
very advantageous for marksmen
how many did you kill
sixty-eight
the first day
a hundred and fifty
the second day
thirty-two the third day
on the fourth day
they exited the city
naturally my war story received
a lot of attention in germany
that why they all recognise me
they call me the
german sergeant york

about your exploits
well that just what
joseph goebbels thought
so he did and called
it nation pride

joseph thinks this movie will be
proven to be his masterpiece
and i will be the
german van johnson

speaking french
emmanuelle there is
somebody i want you to meet
emmanuelle mimieux
id like to introduce
you to the minister
of propaganda
the leader of the entire
german film industry
and now that im an actor
my boss dr joseph goebbels
speaking german
your reputation precedes
you fräulein mimieux
speaking french
and normally this is herr
goebbels french interpreter
mademoiselle francesca mondino
hello
speaking french
hello
and youve met the major
speaking german
actually i didnt
introduce myself
major dieter hellstrom
of the gestapo
at your service mademoiselle
please allow me
have a seat please
try the champagne
mademoiselle it quite good
speaking german
i must say fräulein i should
be rather annoyed with you
translating in french
i arrive in france
and i wish to have
lunch with my star
translating in french
little do i know
he become the toast of paris
and now he must find time for me
translating in french
people wait in line
hours days to see me
for the führer
and private zoller i wait
so finally im granted an
audience with the young private
translator speaking french
and he spends the entire lunch
speaking of you and your cinema
so fräulein mimieux let
get down to business
speaking german
herr minister doctor goebbels
i havent informed her yet
unless the girl a simpleton im
sure she figured it out by now
after all she does
operate a cinema
francesca tell her
speaking french
what they are trying to tell you
emmanuelle is private zoller
has spent the last
hour at lunch trying
to convince monsieur goebbels
to abandon previous plans for
private zoller film premiere
and change the venue
to your cinema
what
speaking french
i wanted to inform her
shit i apologise private
of course you did
speaking german
what the issue
the private wanted to inform
the mademoiselle himself
nonsense
until i ask my questions
he has nothing to inform
let the record state
i have not agreed
to switch cinemas for my premiere
duly noted
you have opera boxes
translator speaking french
yes
how many
two
translates in german
more would be better
goebbels speaking german
how many seats in your auditorium
three hundred and fifty
translating in german
that almost four hundred
less than the ritz
but dr goebbels
that not such a terrible thing
you said yourself you
didnt want to indulge
every two-faced
french bourgeois
taking up space currying favour
with less seats it makes
the event more exclusive
youre not trying to fill the
house theyre fighting for seats
besides to hell with the french
this is a german night a german
event a german celebration
this night is for you me
for the german military
the high command
their family and friends
the only people who should
be allowed in the room
are people who will be moved
by the exploits on the screen
i see your public
speaking has improved
it appears ive created a monster
a strangely persuasive monster
when the war is over
politics await
well private
though it is true im inclined
to indulge you anything
i must watch a film
in this young lady
cinema before i can
say yes or no
so young lady you
are to close your
cinema for a private
screening tonight
translating in french
what german films do you have
ah landa you are here
fredrick speaking french
emmanuelle this is colonel
hans landa of the ss
hell be running the
security for the premiere
speaking french
charmed mademoiselle
au revoir shosanna
speaking german
and now i must get the reich
minister to his next appointment
slave driver
french slave driver
hans speaking german
actually in my role as
security chief of this joyous
german occasion im
afraid i must
have a word with
mademoiselle mimieux
fredrick speaking german
what sort of discussion
hans speaking german
that sounded suspiciously
like a private
questioning the
order of a colonel
or am i just being sensitive
fredrick speaking german
nothing could be further
from the truth colonel
your authority is beyond question
but your reputation
does precede you
should mademoiselle mimieux
or myself be concerned
goebbels speaking german
hans the boy means no harm
he simply smitten
and he correct your
reputation does precede you
hans speaking german
no need for concern
you two as security
chief i simply need
to have a chat
with the possible new
venue property owner
speaking french
have you tried the strudel here
no no
it not so terrible
so how is it the young private and
yourself came to be acquainted
yes two strudels one for myself
and one for the mademoiselle
for me a cup of espresso and
for the mademoiselle
a glass of milk
so mademoiselle you were
beginning to explain
up until a couple
of days ago i had
no knowledge of private zoller
or his exploits
to me
the private was simply
just a patron of
my cinema we spoke
a few times but
mademoiselle let
me interrupt you
this is a simple formality
no reason for you to feel anxious
i apologise i forgot
to order the cream
one moment
wait for the cream
so emmanuelle may i
call you emmanuelle
yes
so emmanuelle
explain to me
how does it happen
that a young lady
such as yourself comes
to own a cinema
after you
verdict
like i said not so terrible
you were explaining the origin
of your cinema ownership
the cinema originally belonged
to my aunt and uncle
what are their names
jean-pierre and ada mimieux
where are they now
my uncle was killed
during blitzkrieg
pity
continue
aunt ada passed away
from fever last spring
regrettable
it come to my
attention you have a
negro in your employ
is that true
yes
he is a frenchman
his name is marcel
he worked with my aunt and uncle
since they opened the cinema
he the only other one
who works with me
doing what
projectionist
is he any good
the best
actually one could see where that
might be a good trade for them
can you operate the projectors
of course i can
knowing the reich
minister as i do
im quite positive
he wouldnt want the success or
failure of his
illustrious evening
dependant on the
prowess of a negro
so
if it comes to pass
we hold this event
at your venue
talented no doubt as
your negro may be
you will
operate the projectors
is that acceptable
yes
cigarette
they are not french
they are german
i did have something else
i wanted to ask you
but right now for the life of
me i cant remember what it is
oh well must not
have been important
til tonight
goebbels speaking german
i must say i appreciate the
modesty of this cinema
your cinema has real
respect almost church like
not to say we couldnt
spruce the place up a bit
maybe ill go to the louvre
pick up a few greek nudes
and scatter them about the lobby
so emmanuelle how did
you like lucky kids
translator speaking french
shosanna speaking french
i quite like lilian harvey
goebbels speaking german
lilian harvey
never mention that name
again in my presence
speaking french
hey
what the fuck are
we supposed to do
it looks like were supposed
to have a nazi premiere
like i said what the fuck
are we supposed to do
well i need to talk
with you about that
im confused what are
we talking about
filling the cinema with nazis and
burning it down to the ground
im not talking about that
you are talking about that
no were talking about
that right now
if we can keep this place from
burning down by ourselves
we can burn it down by ourselves
yes shosanna we could do that
and with madame mimieux 350
nitrate film print collection
we wouldnt even
need explosives
would we
you mean we wouldnt need
any more explosives
at that time 35 millimetre
nitrate film was so flammable
that you couldnt even bring
a reel onto a streetcar
hey you cant bring those
here on a public vehicle
theyre films aint they
yes
then theyre flammable
go on hop off
because nitrate film burns
three times faster than paper
shosanna has a collection
of over 350 nitrate film prints
speaking french
i am going to burn down
the cinema on nazi night
and if im going to
burn down the cinema
which i am
we both know youre not going
to let me do it by myself
because you love me
and i love you
and youre the only person
on this earth i can trust
but that not all
were going to do
does the film-making equipment
in the attic still work
i know the film camera does
how about the sound recorder
quite well actually
i recorded a new
guitarist i met in
a cafe last week it works superb
why do we need
film-making equipment
because marcel my sweet
were going to make a film
just for the nazis
chapter four
operation kino
right this way lieutenant
lieutenant archie
hicox reporting sir
general ed fenech at ease hicox
drink
if you offer me a
scotch and plain water
i could drink a scotch
and plain water
that-a-boy lieutenant make it
yourself like a good
chap will you
the bar is in the globe
something for yourself sir
whiskey straight no junk in it
it says here that you
speak german fluently
like a katzenjammer kid
and your occupation
before the war
im a film critic
list your accomplishments
well sir such as they are
i write reviews and articles for a
publication called
films and film-makers
and ive had two books published
impressive dont be modest
lieutenant what are their titles
the first book was called
art of the eyes the
heart and the mind
a study of german
cinema in the 20s
and the second one was called
twenty-four frame da vinci
it a sub textual film
criticism study of
the work of german
director gw pabst
what should we drink to sir
well
down with hitler
all the way down sir
yes
are you familiar with german
cinema under the third reich
yes obviously i
havent seen any of
the films made in the
last three years
but im familiar with it
explain it to me
pardon sir
well this little
escapade of ours requires
a knowledge of the
german film industry
under the third reich explain
to me ufa under goebbels
goebbels considers the
films he making
to be the beginning of a
new era in german cinema
an alternative to
what he considers
the jewish-german intellectual
cinema of the 20s
and the jewish-controlled
dogma of hollywood
how he doing
frightfully sorry
sir once again
you say he wants to take on
the jews at their own game
well compared to
say louis b mayer
how he doing
quite well actually
since goebbels has taken over
film attendance has
steadily risen in
germany over the last eight years
but louis b mayer wouldnt be
goebbels proper opposite number
i believe goebbels sees himself
closer to david o selznick
brief him
lieutenant hicox at
this point and time
id like to brief you
on operation kino
three days from now
joseph goebbels is
throwing a gala premiere
of one of his new movies in paris
what film sir
the motion picture is
called nation pride
in attendance at this
joyous germatic occasion
will be goebbels göring bormann
and most of the
german high command
including all high
ranking officers
of both the ss and the gestapo
as well as luminaries of the
nazi propaganda film industry
the master race at play
basically we have all our
rotten eggs in one basket
the objective of operation kino
blow up the basket
and like the snows of yesteryear
gone from this earth
jolly good sir
an american secret service outfit
that lives deep behind enemy lines
will be your assist
the germans call
them the basterds
the basterds never heard of them
whole point of the secret service
old boy you not hearing of them
but the jerries have
heard of them because
these yanks have
been them the devil
youll be dropped
into france about
24 kilometres outside of paris
the basterds will
be waiting for you
first thing youll go to a
little village called nadine
in nadine there a tavern
called la louisiane
there youll rendezvous
with our double
agent shell take it from there
she the one who is going to
get you into the premiere
itll be you her and two
german-born members
of the basterds
she also made all the other
arrangements youre going to need
how will i know her
i suspect that wont be
too much trouble for you
your contact is bridget
von hammersmark
bridget von hammersmark
the german movie star
is working for england
yes for the last two years now
one could even say that operation
kino was her brainchild
indeed
got the gist
i think so sir paris
when it sizzles
the village of nadine
you didnt say the goddamn
rendezvous is in a
fucking basement
i didnt know
you said it was in a tavern
it is a tavern
yeah in a basement
you know fighting in a basement
offers a lot of difficulties
number one being youre
fighting in a basement
what if we go in there and
she not even there
we wait
dont worry she a british
spy shell make the rendezvous
stiglitz right
that right sir
i hear youre pretty
good with that
you know were not looking
for trouble right now
simply making contact with our
agent should be uneventful
however the off chance im
wrong things prove eventful
i need to know we can
all remain calm
i dont look calm to you
well now that you put it
like that i guess you do
this jerry of yours stiglitz not
exactly the loquacious
type is he
is that the kind of man you
need loquacious type
fair point lieutenant
so you all get in trouble in
there what are we supposed to do
make bets on how it all comes out
if we get into trouble
we can handle it
but if trouble does happen
we need you to make damn sure
no germans or french for that
matter escape from that basement
if frau von hammersmark cover is
compromised the mission is kaput
speaking of frau von
hammersmark whose
idea was it for the
death-trap rendezvous
she chose the spot
isnt that just dandy
look she not a military
strategist she just an actress
you dont got to be
stonewall jackson to
know you dont want to
fight in a basement
she wasnt picking
a place to fight
she was picking a place
isolated and without germans
speaking german
so im male
im a fictional literary
character from the past
im american and
that controversial
no it not controversial at all
the nationality of the
author has nothing to
do with the nationality
of the character
the character is the character
hamlet is not british
he is danish
so yes this character
was born in america
well then
mathilda
schnapps schnapps

officer gave him and
his mates the night

to max
speaking german
there some new development
the cinema venue has changed
why
no one knows but that should
not be a real problem
the cinema it been changed to is
considerably smaller
than the ritz
so whatever explosives
you brought for the
ritz should be doubly
effective here
now the next piece
of information
is colossal
try not to overreact
the führer
speaking german
i was just thinking
could you sign an autograph
to my son on his birthday
of course id love to wilhelm
this handsome staff sergeant
just became a father today
congratulations
thank you
do you know the name
of this progeny yet
i most certainly do fräulein
his name is maximilian
maximilian wonderful name
thank you lieutenant
nothing but the best
for little maximilian
thanking in german
max may not know who
you are now but
he will i will show him
all of your movies
good
he will grow up with
your films and
this napkin on his wall
i propose a toast to the
greatest actress in germany
there is no dietrich there is no
riefenstahl only von hammersmark
cheers
cheers
cheers
once again
speaking german
frau hammersmark what
brings you to france
none of your business
staff sergeant
you might not have worn
out your welcome with
the fräulein with your
drunken boorish behaviour
but you have worn out
your welcome with me
might i remind you
staff sergeant
you are an enlisted man
this is an officer table
i suggest you stop
pestering the fräulein
and rejoin your table
excuse me captain but your
accent is very unusual
where are you from
you must be either completely
drunk or mad to dare
to speak to a superior officer
with such impertinentness
staff sergeant
im making you and you
responsible for him
i suggest you take
hold of your friend
or hell spend max
first birthday
in jail for public drunkenness
speaking german
might i inquire
like our young newly
christened father here
i too have an acute
ear for accents
and like him
i too find yours odd
from where do you hail captain
major this is highly
i wasnt speaking to
you lieutenant munich
or you either
lieutenant frankfurt
i was speaking to captain
i-dont-know-what
i was born in a village that rests
in the shadow of the piz palü
the mountain
yes
in that village we
all speak like this
have you seen the
riefenstahl film
yes
then you saw me
you remember the
skiing torch scene
yes
in that scene was
myself my father
my sister and my two brothers
my brother is so handsome
the director pabst
gave him a close-up
herr major if my word
means anything
i can vouch for everything the
young captain has just said
he does hail from the
bottom of the piz palü
he was in the film and his brother
is far more handsome than he
you should rejoin your friends
may i join you
by all means
wunderbar
so that the source of
your bizarre accent
that extraordinary
what are you doing here
aside from having a drink
with the lovely fräulein
well that pleasure
requires no explanation
i mean in country
youre obviously not stationed in
france or id know who you are
you know every german in france
worth knowing
well there lies the problem
we never claimed to
be worth knowing
all levity aside what
are you doing in france
attending minister goebbels film
premiere as the fräulein escort
you are the fräulein
hammersmark escort
someone has to carry her lighter
the captain is my date but
all three are my guests
we are old friends
who go back a long time
actually longer than an
actress would care to admit
well in that case
let me raise my glass to the
three luckiest men in the room
ill drink to that
speaking german
queen christina
mata hari
i must say
that game theyre playing
looks like a good bit of fun
i didnt join them because
youre quite right captain
an officer should not
fraternise with enlisted men
but
seeing as we are all officers
and sophisticated lady
friends of officers
what say we play the game
yes great one game
wunderbar
soldiers
the cards
thank you
so gentlemen
the object of the game is to
write the name of a famous
person on your card
real or fictitious
doesnt matter
for instance you could write
confucius or doctor fu manchu
eric more pens
and they must be famous
not aunt frida
when you finish writing put the
card face down on the table
and move it to the
person on your right
thanks
the person to your left
moves his card to you
you pick up the card
without looking at it
lick the back
and stick it on your forehead
write
write
ill start give you the idea
am i german
no
no
am i american
no
no
wait a minute he goes to
obviously he wasnt
born in america
so i visited america aye
yes
was this visit fortuitous
not for you
my native land is it what
one would call exotic
von hammersmark and
hicox speaking german
yes
yes
that could be either a reference
to the jungle or the orient
im going to let my
first instinct take
over and ask am i
from the jungle
yes
yes
now gentlemen around
this time you could
ask whether youre
real or fictitious
i however think that too
easy so i wont ask that yet
okay
my native land is the jungle
i visited america
but my visit was not
fortuitous to me
but the implication is that
it was to somebody else
when i went
from the jungle to america
did i go by boat
yes
yes
did i go against my will
yes
yes
on this boat ride
was i in chains
yes
when i arrived in america
was i displayed in chains
yes
yes
am i the story of the
negro in america
hicox speaking german
no
well then i must be king kong
bravo
impressive
now since i answered
correctly you
all need to finish your drinks
cheers
now who is next
well major
i dont mean to be rude but the
four of us are very good friends
and we havent seen each
other in quite a while
so major
i am afraid
you are intruding
i beg to differ captain
it only if the
fräulein considers
my presence an intrusion
that i become an intruder
how about it fräulein von
hammersmark am i intruding
speaking german
i didnt think so
it simply the captain
is immune to my charms
i am just joking
just joking of
course im intruding
allow me to refill your
glasses gentlemen
and i will bid you and
the fräulein adieu
eric has a bottle of
thirty-three-year-old whiskey
from the scottish highlands
what do you say gentlemen
youre most gracious major
eric the thirty-three
and new glasses
you dont want to contaminate
the thirty-three
with the swill you were drinking
how many glasses
five
not for me
i like scotch scotch
doesnt like me
nor i ill stay with bubbly
three glasses
speaking german
eric speaking german
frau von hammersmark
speaking french
thank you
speaking german
a thousand year german reich
a thousand year reich
a thousand year reich
i must say i grow weary
of these monkeyshines
did you hear that
that was the sound of my walther
pointed right at your testicles
speaking german
why do you have your walther
pointed at my testicles
because youve just given
yourself away captain
youre no more german
than that scotch
both speaking german
well major
shut up slut
you were saying
i was saying that makes two of us
ive had a gun pointed at your
balls since you sat down
that makes three of us
and at this range im a
real fredrick zoller
looks like we have a bit of
a sticky situation here
what going to happen major
youre going to stand up and
walk out that door with us
no no no no no
no i dont think so
im afraid you and i
we both know captain
no matter what happens to
anybody else in this room
the two of us arent
going anywhere
too bad about sergeant wilhelm
and his famous friends
if any of you expect to live
youll have to shoot them too
looks like little max
will grow up an orphan
how sad
well if this is it old boy
i hope you dont mind if i
go out speaking the king
by all means captain
there a special
rung in hell reserved
for people who waste good scotch
seeing as i may be rapping
on the door momentarily
i must say damn good stuff sir

act and the gestapo major saw it

men to a rendezvous
in a basement with
a bunch of nazis

there was either a
trap set by me or a
tragic coincidence
it couldnt be both
howd the shooting start
the englishman gave himself away
howd he do that
he ordered three glasses
we order three glasses
that the german three
the other looks odd
germans would and did notice it
okay let pretend
there were no germans
and everything went exactly
the way it was supposed to
what was the next step
tuxedos
to get them into the premiere
wearing military uniforms
with all the military there
wouldve been suicide
but going as members of
the german film industry
they wear tuxedos and fit
in with everybody else
i arranged for the tailor to
fit three tuxedos tonight
howd you intend to get
them in that premiere
hand me my purse
lieutenant hicox was
going as my escort
the other two were going as a
german cameraman
and his assistant
you still get us in that premiere
you speak german better
than your friends no
have i been shot yes
i dont see me tripping the light
fantastique up a red
carpet anytime soon
least of all by tomorrow night
however there something
you dont know
thereve been two
recent developments
regarding operation kino
one the venue has
been changed from
the ritz to a much smaller venue
enormous change at the last
minute that not very germatic
why the hell is goebbels doing
stuff so damn peculiar
it probably has something to do
with the second development
which is
der führer is attending
the premiere
speaking german
ive been rethinking
my position
in regards to your paris
premiere of nation pride
as the weeks have gone on
and the americans
are on the beach
i do find myself thinking
more and more
about this private zoller
this boy has done something
tremendous for us
and im beginning to think
my participation in this
event could be meaningful
fuck a duck
what are you thinking
im thinking getting a whack
at planting old uncle adolf
makes this horse a
different colour
what is that supposed to mean
it means you getting
us in that premiere
im probably going to
end up losing this leg
bye-bye acting career
fun while it lasted
how do you expect me to
walk the red carpet
doggy doc going to dig
that slug out your gam
he going to wrap
it up in a cast
and you got a good how i broke
my leg mountain climbing story
that german aint it you all
like climbing
mountains dont you
i dont i like smoking drinking
and ordering in restaurants
but i see your point
we fill you up with morphine
till it coming out your ears
and just limp your little
ass up that rouge carpet
i know this is a silly
question before i ask it
but can you americans speak any
other language than english
we both speak a little italian
with an atrocious
accent no doubt
but that doesnt exactly
kill us in the crib
germans dont have a
good ear for italian
so you mumble italian and brazen
through it is that the plan
that about it
that sounds good
it sounds like shit what else
are we going to do go home
no that sounds good
if you dont blow it with that
i can get you in the building
who does what
well i speak the most italian
so ill be your escort
donowitz speaks second most so
hell be your italian cameraman
omar third most hell
be donny assistant
i dont speak italian
like i said third best just
keep your fucking mouth shut
in fact why dont you start
practising right now
speaking german
youve moved up in the world
look at you lieutenant
first class
and with your record of
insubordination truly remarkable
and that one name is
wilhelm wicki
he an austrian-born jew who
immigrated to the united states
when things began turning
sour for the israelites
they are the two german-born
members of the basterds
theyve been known to don german
uniforms to ambush squads
speaking german
what brings you all
the way out here
speaking german
but that doesnt look like this
this is odd
it would appear
somebody missing
somebody fashionable
everybody out
speaking german
to max with love
bridget von hammersmark
chapter five
revenge of the giant face
night of nation pride premiere
speaking french
remember in english
yes
action
but how do we get it developed
only a suicidal idiot like us
would develop that footage
and suppose someone would
develop the footage
how do we get a 35mm
print with a soundtrack
speaking french
we find somebody who
can develop and
process a 35mm print
with a soundtrack
and we make them do it
or we kill them
speaking french
bring that fucker over here put
his head down on that table
you either do what the
fuck we tell you
or ill bury this axe in
your collaborating skull
man speaking french
im not a collaborator
marcel do his wife and
children know you
yes
then after we kill this
dog for the germans
well go and silence them
speaking german

the most difficult thing
for a star of your status
speaking italian
0023 and 0024

difficult to find goodbye
all saying goodbye in italian
speaking german
speaking italian
speaking french

first projector

okay the big sniper
battle in the film

of the third reel
our film comes in
on the fourth reel
somewhere towards the end
of the third reel
go down and lock the
doors of the auditorium

screen and wait for my cue
then burn it down
speaking german
take your seats
the show is about to begin
everybody please take your seats
the show is about to begin
speaking german
well see you later
hans speaking german
not so fast
a glass of champagne
to toast nation pride
my fräulein may i have a
word with you in private
certainly
speaking italian
excuse us
usher continues
announcing in german
speaking german
have a seat my fräulein
may i
mademoiselle mimieux allowed me
to set up camp in her
office for the time being
let me see your foot
i beg your pardon
put your foot in my lap
hans you embarrass me
could you please reach into the
right pocket of my coat
and give me what
you find in there
may i
speaking french
what that american
expression if
the shoe fits you must wear it
speaking german
what now colonel
speaking german
the guy in the white
smoking jacket
fucking shithead
faggot fuck fuck you
bunch of shithead fuck
fuck you too
goddamn nazi farts sons of
bitches get your hands off me
you fucking bratwurst-smelling
god damn you get off
speaking german
clever
speaking german
i informed the führer that the
audience has taken their seats
he should arrive any minute
thank you hans
you jerry-banging
limburg-smelling
speaking german
let go
as stanley said to livingstone
lieutenant aldo raine i presume
hans landa
youve had a nice long run aldo
alas youre now in
the hands of the ss
my hands to be exact
and theyve been waiting a
long time to touch you
caught you flinching
touch me again kraut-burger
utivich
is that you lieutenant
yeah
do you know what
happened to donny
omar
the woman
no i do not
tell me aldo if i were
sitting where youre sitting
would you show me mercy
nope
what is that english expression
about shoes and feet
looks like the shoe
is on the other
foot yeah i was
just thinking that
speaking german
you may leave us
but stay alert outside
so youre aldo the apache
so youre the jew hunter
im a detective
a damn good detective
finding people is my speciality
so naturally i worked for
the nazis finding people
and yes some of them
were jews but jew hunter
just a name that stuck
well you do have to
admit it is catchy
do you control the nicknames
your enemies bestow on you
aldo the apache and
the little man
what do you mean the little man
germans nickname for you
the germans nickname for
me is the little man
and as if to make my
point im a little
surprised how tall you
were in real life
i mean youre a little fellow
but not circus-midget little
as your reputation would suggest
where my men
where bridget von hammersmark
well let just say she
got what she deserved
and when you purchase friends
like bridget von hammersmark
you get what you pay for
now as far as your
paesanos sergeant
donowitz and private omar
how you know our names
lieutenant aldo
if you dont think i
wouldnt interrogate
every single one of your
swastika-marked survivors
we simply arent operating on the
level of mutual respect i assumed
no i guess not
well back to the whereabouts
of your two italian saboteurs
as of this moment
both omar and donowitz
should be sitting
in the very seats we left them in
double-zero 23 and double-zero
24 if my memory serves
explosives still around their
ankles still ready to explode
and your mission some would
call a terrorist plot
as of this moment is still a go
that a pretty exciting story
what next eliza on ice
however
all i have to do is pick
up this phone right here
inform the cinema and
your plan is kaput
if theyre still
here and if theyre
still alive and
that one big if
there aint no way
youre going to take
them boys without
setting off them bombs
i have no doubt
and yes some germans will die
yes it will ruin the evening
and yes goebbels will be
very very very mad at you
for what youve done
to his big night
but you wont get hitler
you wont get goebbels
you wont get göring and
you wont get bormann
and you need all
four to end the war
but if i dont pick up
this phone right here
you may very well get all four
and if you get all
four you end the war
tonight
so gentlemen
let discuss the prospect
of ending the war tonight
so the way i see it
since hitler death or possible
rescue rests solely
on my reaction
if i do nothing
it as if im causing
his death even
more than yourselves
wouldnt you agree
i guess so
how about you utivich
i guess so too
gentlemen i have no intention
of killing hitler and
killing goebbels
and killing göring
and killing bormann
not to mention winning the war
single-handedly for the allies
only later to find myself standing
before a jewish tribunal
if you want to win
the war tonight
we have to make a deal
what kind of deal
the kind you wouldnt have
the authority to make
however im sure this mission of
yours has a commanding officer
a general
im betting for
oss would be my guess
that a bingo
is that the way you say
it that a bingo
you just say bingo
bingo how fun
but i digress where were
we yeah make a deal
over there is a very
capable two-way
radio and sitting behind it
is a more than capable radio
operator named hermann
get me someone on the
other end of that radio
with the power of the
pen to authorise my
let call it the terms of
my conditional surrender
if that tastes better going down
you know where im from
yeah where is that exactly
maynardville tennessee
ive done my share of bootlegging
up there if you engage
in what the federal
government calls illegal activity
but what we call just a man trying
to make a living for his family
selling moonshine liquor it
behoves oneself to keep his wits
long story short we hear a
story too good to be true
it aint
sitting in your chair i would
probably say the same thing
and 999999 times out of a
million you would be correct
but in the pages of history
every once in a while
fate reaches out and
extends its hand
what shall the history books read
speaking german
i implore you we must
destroy that tower
sarge that tower
the tower stands
speaking german
gum
psst psst
speaking italian
speaking french
it time
i should go lock
the auditorium and
take my place behind the screen
so when the military history
of this night is written
it will be recorded that i
was part of operation kino
from the very beginning
as a double agent
anything ive done in my
guise as an ss colonel
was sanctioned by the
oss as a necessary evil
to establish my cover
with the germans
and it was my placement of
lieutenant raine dynamite
in hitler and goebbels opera
box that assured their demise
speaking german
i informed the führer that the
audience has taken their seats
he should arrive any minute
thank you hans
by the way that last
part is actually true
i want my full
military pension and
benefits under my proper rank
i want to receive the
congressional medal of honour
for my invaluable assistance in
the toppling of the third reich
in fact i want all the
members of operation kino
to receive the congressional
medal of honour
full citizenship for myself
well that goes without saying
and i would like the
united states of america
to purchase property for
me on nantucket island
as a reward for all the
countless lives ive saved
by bringing the tyranny of
the national socialist party
to a swifter-than-imagined end
do you have all that sir
i look forward to seeing you
face to face as well sir
lieutenant raine right here
yes sir
colonel landa will
put you and private
utivich in a truck as prisoners
then he and his radio
operator will get
in the truck and
drive to our lines
upon crossing our
lines colonel landa
and his man will surrender to you
you will then take over
driving of the truck
and bring them straight to me for
debriefing is that
clear lieutenant
yes sir
over and out
speaking german
herr dr goebbels excuse me
could i go out for a moment
perfectly understandable my boy
you go now and well
see you after the show
speaking german
speaking french
who is it
fredrick
shit
are you the manager of this
cinema i want my money back
that actor in the movie stinks
what are you doing here
i came to visit you
cant you see how busy i am
then allow me to lend an assist
fredrick it not funny
you cant be here
this is your premiere you need
to be out there with them
normally you would be right
and for all the
other films i do
i intend to endure evenings like
tonight in the proper spirit
however the fact remains
this film is based on
my military exploits
and in this case my exploits
consisted of killing many men
consequently the part of the
film that playing now
i dont like watching this part
i am sorry fredrick but
so i thought
id come up here and
do what i do best
annoy you
and from the look on your face it
would appear i havent
lost my touch
are you so used to the
nazis kissing your ass
youve forgotten what
the word no means
no you cant be here
now go away
fredrick you hurt me
well it nice to know
you can feel something
even if it just physical pain
im not a man you
say go away to
there over three hundred
dead bodies in italy
that if they could
would testify to that
after what ive done for you
you disrespect me at your peril
lock the door
what
lock the door
we dont have much time
time for what
forget it
no no no wait
you want me to lock the door
for the fifty-seventh time yes
when i kill that guy you got
30 feet to get to that guard
can you do it
i have to
champagne
speaking german
extraordinary my dear
simply extraordinary
this is your finest film yet
thank you my führer
thank you
who wants to send a
message to germany
i have a message for germany
that you are all going to die
speaking german
enough stop it
turn off the projector
and i want you to
look deep into the
face of the jew who
going to do it
speaking german
i dont know what going on
that does not belong in my movie
marcel burn it down
yes shosanna
my name is shosanna dreyfus
and this is the face
of jewish vengeance
speaking german
these are the american
lines colonel sir
excellent hermann
hermann uncuff them
im officially surrendering myself
over to you lieutenant raine
were your prisoners
how about my knife
thank you very much colonel
utivich cuff the colonel
hands behind his back
is that really necessary
im a slave to appearances
scalp hermann
are you mad
what have you done
i made a deal with your
general for that man life
yeah they made that
deal but they dont
give a fuck about
him they need you
youll be shot for this
nah i dont think
so more like chewed
out ive been chewed out before
you know utivich and myself heard
that deal you made with the brass
end the war tonight
id make that deal
how about you utivich
you make that deal
id make that deal
i dont blame you damn good deal
and that pretty little nest
you feathered for yourself
well if youre willing to
barbecue the whole high command
i suppose that worth
certain considerations
but i do have one question
when you get to your little
place on nantucket island
i imagine you are going
to take off that
handsome-looking ss
uniform of yours
aint you
that what i thought
now that i cant abide
how about you utivich
can you abide it
not one damn bit sir
i mean if i had my way
youd wear that
goddamn uniform for
the rest of your
pecker-sucking life
but im aware that
aint practical
i mean at some point youre
going to have to take it off
so
im going to give you a little
something you cant take off
you know something utivich
i think this just might
be my masterpiece
