
war began between germany
and france on august 3rd 94
five weeks later
the german army had smashed its way
to within 8 miles of paris
there the battered french rallied
their forces at the marne river
and in a series of
unexpected counterattacks
drove the germans back
the front was stabilised
then shortly afterwards
developed into a continuous
line of heavily fortified trenches
zigzagging their way 500 miles
from the english channel
to the swiss frontier
by 96 after two grisly years
of trench warfare
the battle lines had changed very little
successful attacks were
measured in hundreds of yards
and paid for in lives
by hundreds of thousands
general bollard sir
hello george how are you
paul wonderful seeing you again
well this is splendid
superb
i try to create a pleasant atmosphere
in which to work
youve succeeded marvellously i wish
i had your taste in carpets and pictures
youre much too kind george
sit down george
i havent done very much
the place is much the same
as it was when i moved in
paul ive come to see you
about something big
it top-secret it must go no further
than your chief of staff and not to him
unless you can trust his discretion
of course
a group of armies is forming
on this front for an offensive very soon
headquarters is determined to make
a breakthrough why are you smiling
im sorry i thought for a moment
i knew what you were going to say
please go on
i never knew you were a mind-reader
what did you think i was about to say
something about the ant hill
you are a mind-reader
well it is a key position
it in my sector
to be perfectly honest
ive heard some talk
you know there nothing really
secret around headquarters
well what do you think
it the key to the german position
in this sector
theyve held onto it for a year now
and it looks as if
theyll hold onto it for another year
paul i have formal orders to take
the ant hill no later than the 0th
that the day after tomorrow
that comes pretty close to being
ridiculous dont you think
i dont imagine i would be here
if i really thought that
paul if there one man in this army
who can do this for me it you
it out of the question george
absolutely out of the question
my division was cut to pieces
what left of it is in no position
to hold the ant hill let alone take it
im sorry but that the truth
well paul there was something else
i wanted to tell you
but you may misunderstand
my motives in mentioning it
what was it
youd be bound to misunderstand
however as your friend
maybe i should tell you
what are you trying to say george
paul
the talk around headquarters is that you
are being considered for the 2th corps
the 2th corps
yes and with that another star
ive pushed it all i can
the 2th corps needs a fighting
general and youre overdue another star
we both know that your record is good
enough for you to refuse this assignment
on the grounds youve stated
no one would question your opinion
theyd simply get
someone else to do the job
so you shouldnt let this
influence your opinion paul
oh im sorry have a cognac
no thanks not before dinner
george im responsible
for the lives of 8000 men
what is my ambition against that
what is my reputation
in comparison to that
my men come first of all george
and those men know it too
i know that they do
you see george those men
know i would never let them down
that goes without saying
the life of one soldier means more to me
than all the stars and declarations
and honours in france
so
you think this attack is absolutely beyond
the ability of your men at this time
i didnt say that george
nothing is beyond those men
once their fighting spirit is aroused
paul i dont want to push you
into it if you think it ill-advised
dont worry george
you couldnt do that if you tried
of course artillery would
make an enormous difference
what artillery support can you give me
ill see
what about replacements
well see what we can do
but i feel sure you can get along
with what you have
we might just do it
paul i knew that i was right
to come to you
you are the man to take the ant hill
now as for that star is concerned
that had nothing
to do with my decision
if anything itd sway me the other way
i realise that perfectly
now when do you see this coming on
no later than the day after tomorrow
we just might do it
hello there soldier
ready to kill more germans
yes sir
what your name soldier
sir private ferol company a
are you married
no sir
well ill bet your mother proud of you
yes sir
well carry on private
and good luck to you
yes sir thank you sir
hello there soldier
ready to kill more germans
yes sir
working over your rifle i see that
the way it a soldier best friend
you be good to it
and itll always be good to you
well good luck to you soldier
carry on
thank you sir
hello there soldier
ready to kill more germans
is everything all right soldier
all right yes sir im all right
ah-ha good fella
are you married soldier
married me married
yes have you got a wife
a wife have i got a wife
sir he a bit shell-shocked
i beg your pardon sergeant
there is no such thing as shell shock
have you got a wife soldier
my wife my wife
yes i have a wife im never going to
see her again im going to be killed
get a grip on yourself
youre acting like a coward
i am a coward
snap out of it soldier
sergeant arrange for the immediate
transfer of this baby out of my regiment
i wont have other brave men
contaminated by him
yes sir
carry on sergeant
you were right sir this sort of thing
can spread if it isnt checked
you know general im convinced
that these tours of yours
have an incalculable effect
upon the morale of these men
in think the fighting spirit
of the 70st derives from it
no major that spirit
was just born in them
the general is coming sir
always a pleasure to see you colonel
im honoured general
well quite a neat little
spot you have here
ill reserve comment on
the neatness sir but it is little
pretty shy on seating accommodation
more than enough for me
never got the habit of sitting
like to be on my feet
keep on the move
i can vouch for that colonel
i can hardly get the general behind a desk
long enough to sign an order
that the way i am dax
i cant understand these armchair officers
fellas trying to fight a war from behind
a desk waving papers at the enemy
worrying whether a mouse is
going to run up their pants leg
if i had the choice between mice and
mausers id take the mice every time
youll never make me believe that colonel
seriously though
if a man a ninny let him put on
a dress and hide under the bed
but if he wants to be a soldier
then by heavens he got to be one
he got to fight and he cant do that
unless he where the fighting is
that my credo
i think i have to agree with you
presenting your case so convincingly sir
you never fail to live up to it sir
i imagine youd like a look around
would you
yes colonel
here something to see the ant hill
it as good a view as you can get
without actually being there
that wont be long now will it
hm yeah
well ive seen much more formidable
objectives much much worse
not something we can grab and run
away with but certainly pregnable
sounds kind of odd though doesnt it
why
like something to do with giving birth
oh yes quite
youre right on your toes this morning
even sharper than usual
we mustnt forget the colonel was perhaps
the foremost criminal lawyer
in all france
gentlemen youre both much too kind
tell me colonel how did your relief
come off last night
we drew some artillery 29 casualties sir
yes noticed it on the road in
utterly inexcusable stupid
all swarmed together like flies
waiting for someone to swat them
they never learn they get in a tight spot
under heavy fire gang up every time
herd instinct i suppose
kind of a lower animal sort of thing
a human sort of thing it seems to me
dont you make a distinction major
yes very regrettable of course
very yes indeed
major would you be kind enough
to excuse us for a few minutes
yes sir of course
colonel
well colonel what do you think of it
what do i think of what sir
the ant hill
colonel your regiment is going
to take the ant hill tomorrow
you know the condition of my men sir
men will have to be killed
possibly a lot of them
they absorb bullets and shrapnel
making it possible
for others to get through
what support will we have
i have none to give you
what sort of casualties
do you anticipate sir
say 5% killed by our own barrage
that a very generous allowance
0% more in getting
through no-man-land
and 20% more getting through the wire
that leaves 65%
with the worst part of the job over
let say another 25%
in actually taking the ant hill
were still left with a force
more than adequate to hold it
youre saying that more than
half my men will be killed
yes it a terrible price to pay colonel
but we will have the ant hill
but will we sir
im depending on you colonel
all france is depending on you
am i amusing you colonel
im not a bull general i dont need a flag
waving in front of me to get me to charge
i dont like a comparison of the flag of
france to a bullfighter cape
i meant no disrespect to our flag
patriotism may be old-fashioned
but show me a patriot
and ill show you an honest man
everyone always thought so
samuel johnson had something else
to say about patriotism
and what was that may i ask
nothing really
what do you mean nothing really
sir nothing really important
colonel when i ask a question
it always important
now who was this man
samuel johnson sir
what did he have to say about patriotism
that it was the last refuge of a scoundrel
sir im sorry i meant nothing personal
youre tired dax youre very tired
it you who are exhausted not your men
and it my fault ive given you
one impossible task after another
you need rest
i havent said
you never would so you arent
going to have any say-so about it colonel
as from now im ordering you
on indefinite furlough
general you cant take me away
from my men you cant do that to me sir
not to you dax for you
for your good and the good of your men
the good of my men sir
if a commanding officer lacks confidence
what can we expect of his men
naturally i dont want to relieve you
but i must have your enthusiastic support
not once have you said
that your men can take the ant hill
well take the ant hill
if any soldiers in the world can take it
well take the ant hill
and when you do your men will
be relieved and get a long rest
corporal paris and private lejeune
reporting sir
you took your time about it
we prepared as quick as we could sir
we had to alert the sentries
all right you men at ease
this is a reconnaissance patrol
german wire
machine-gun posts
identification of bodies
there will only be the three of us
were to avoid a fight if we can
we go out to the left and we come
back through post six on the right
is everything all clear at post six
all the sentries have been warned
number six will send up flares
at 0-minute intervals starting at 0400
i wanted them every five minutes
i told them that sir
the sergeant says
every five minutes is too much
he says it certain to draw artillery
quite a strategist this sergeant
what his name
i dont know sir
all right you men wait outside
ill join you in a minute
would you mind telling us the password
sir
calais
yes sir
he fortifying himself
it smelled like heaven
i can always tell when he had a few
he gets sarcastic
at least he could have
passed it around the pig
what he got against you anyway
we went to school together
before the war
he thinks i dont have enough
respect for him he right
if you gentlemen are ready
colonel
everything clear and understood
yes sir
the lane through our wire in front here
machine gun pointing at the opening
good luck men
thank you sir
all right men let go
what that
i dont know
lejeune move out and look
that over well cover you
split up a night patrol
move out lejeune
i dont like this let get outta here
we havent given him enough time
if we wait any longer theyll get us too
weve gotta wait for him
he must be dead where is he
well
surprised lieutenant
yes i am happily surprised
i thought youd been killed
you didnt wait to find out did you
look here what do you mean
i mean you ran like a rabbit
after you killed lejeune
killed lejeune
what are you talking about
i dont think i like your tone
youre speaking to an officer
remember that
well i must be mistaken then sir
an officer wouldnt do that
a man wouldnt do it only a thing would
a sneaky booze-guzzling
yellow-bellied rat
with a bottle for a brain
and a streak of spit
that enough corporal
youve got yourself into a mess
i have have i
youve got yourself in a worse one
first general insubordination
second threatening your superior officer
third refusing to obey an order
and inciting others to do the same
how do you think those charges
will look on paper
not half as bad as these
endangering the lives of your men
through recklessness drunk on duty
wanton murder of one of your own men
and cowardice in the face of the enemy
phillip have you ever tried to bring
charges against an officer
it my word against yours you know
whose word do you think
theyre gonna believe
let me put it another way whose word
do you think theyre going to accept
now ill tell you what im willing to do
s0 far all i have written in this report
is that you and lejeune
were killed while out on patrol
ill fix this to read
that you made your way back
after becoming separated
during the skirmish
thatll end the matter
you killed lejeune
you know that dont you
im sorry it was an accident
id give anything in the world if it
hadnt happened and that the truth
honestly i know you dont like me but
what kind of a man do you think i am
oh good morning colonel
at ease men
ive been waiting for your report
lieutenant
well i think we found out a thing or two
everything go well
no sir private lejeune was killed
how did it happen
it all right here in the report sir
let have it
it isnt quite finished yet sir
that all corporal
you did a good night work
should feel very proud of yourself
go get some sleep
yes sir
how did you lose lejeune
machine-gun fire sir
he coughed almost got us all killed
finish that report
and get it to me immediately
yes sir
the artillery starts at 055
the st battalion will move out at 0530
when the leading elements
have cleared the german wires
the second wave consisting of-
the 2nd and 3rd battalions minus
two companies in reserve will move out
in no case later than 0540
that it gentlemen
are there any questions
sir is 5 minutes of artillery
preparation all that we can expect
the feeling is that any more than that will
give them too much time to get organised
what weather supposed
to be like tomorrow sir
too good
no chance of rain or fog
the forecast is for sun all day
if perhaps i should say
when we take the ant hill
how long do we have to hold it
before we can expect any support
general mireau who will be
personally observing the attack
has promised support from
the 72nd by sundown tomorrow
which means of course
that well have to hold all day
are there any more questions
well gentlemen good luck im sure
youll come through as you always do
let get some sleep
im not afraid of dying tomorrow
only of getting killed
that as clear as mud
which would you rather be done in by
a bayonet or a machine gun
a machine gun
that just my point theyre both
pieces of steel ripping into you
only the machine gun is quicker
cleaner and less painful
what does that prove
it proves that most of us are more afraid
of getting hurt than of getting killed
look at bernard he panics when it comes
to gas gas doesnt bother me a bit
he seen photos of gas cases -
doesnt mean anything to me
but ill tell you something id hate
like the devil to be without my tin hat
but i dont mind
not having a tin hat for my tail
why because i know a wound in the
head would hurt more than one in the tail
the tail is just meat
but the head is all bone
speak for yourself
tell me this
aside from the bayonet
what are you most afraid of
high explosives
exactly it the same with me
because i know that it can chew
you up worse than anything else
look it what im trying to tell you
if youre really afraid of dying
youd be living in a funk
all the rest of your life
because you know
youve got to go someday anyday
and if it death youre afraid of why
should you care about what kills you
youre too smart for me professor
all i know is nobody wants to die
through to division sir
through to polygon
everything quiet
all units report themselves ready
zero minus two
may i offer you gentlemen some cognac
thank you sir
after you sir
to france
minus 5 4 3
0 9 8 7
6 5 4 3
2  zero
sergeant where b company
i dont know sir
where in heaven name are they
on the left
where are the rest zero plus one
and theyre still in the trenches
now theyre advancing
miserable cowards
theyre not advancing
the barrage is getting away from them
theyre still in the trenches
yes sir
captain nichols
yes sir
order the 75s to commence
firing on our own positions
captain do you fail to comprehend
the meaning of my order
no sir but i respectfully ask to
captain do you fail to comprehend
the meaning of my order
no sir
then carry it out captain
yes sir
hello polygon this is division
batteries  and 2 commence firing
on coordinates 32-58-78
batteries  and 2 to commence
firing on coordinates 32-58-78 over
general the battery commander reports
those are our own positions
he says it must be a mistake
confirm the order captain
the order is confirmed
battery commander respectfully reports
he cannot execute such an order
unless it is in writing
and signed by the general over
battery commander respectfully reports
he cannot execute
such an order unless it is in writing
and signed by the general
give me that phone
general mireau speaking
battery commander speaking
the troops are mutinying
refusing to advance
fire as ordered until further notice
with all respect you have no right
to order me to shoot down my own men
unless you are willing to take
full and undivided responsibility for it
captain rousseau
will you obey my order
i must have a written order before
i can execute such a command sir
supposing youre killed where will i be
in front of a firing squad
tomorrow morning that where youll be
hand over your command and report
yourself under arrest to my headquarters
roget lieutenant roget
why are your men still in here
it impossible sir major vignon is dead
get these men out of the trenches
come on let get ready for another try
get these men outta here
i tried three times
all right let give it another try
come on let give it another try
it impossible sir
all the men are falling back
sir i respectfully
submit to the colonel
pardon me your remarks to me
were very unfair sir
it just impossible
it just impossible
according to reports
the attack has failed all along the line
the men are falling back
to our own trenches
major saint-auban arrange for the
immediate relief of the 70st regiment
have them sent to the château de iaigle
have colonel dax report to me
major couderc assemble
a general court martial
have it ready to meet at 3 oclock
tomorrow afternoon
if those little sweethearts wont face
german bullets theyll face french ones
i ordered an attack
your troops refused to attack
the troops did attack sir
but they could make no headway
because they didnt try i saw it myself
half of your men never left the trenches
a third of my men were pinned down
because the fire was so intense
dont quibble over fractions colonel
the fact remains that a good part of
your men never left their own trenches
colonel dax im going to have 0 men
from each company in your regiment
tried under penalty of death
for cowardice
penalty of death
for cowardice
they have skimmed milk in their veins
instead of blood
it the reddest milk ive ever seen
my trenches
that enough
im not gonna mince words
colonel dax
if you continue in this manner
i shall have to place you under arrest
i believe the colonel has a point
even though he makes it bluntly
this is not a trial
but it does bear certain aspects of one
colonel dax technically is cast in the role
of the defence
in view of the gravity of the charges
a court of law would grant him all
possible latitude in presenting his case
latitude is one thing
insubordination another
i am merely offering an opinion please
do not feel constrained to accept it
im perfectly willing to accept it
general broulard
im sorry sir i certainly
didnt intend to be insubordinate
my only aim is
to remind you of the heroism
these men have shown
on every occasion in the past
were not talking about the past
were talking about the present
dont you see sir theyre not cowards
if some didnt leave the trenches
it must have been
because it was impossible
they were ordered to attack
it was their duty to obey that order
we cant leave it up to the men to decide
when an order is possible or not
if it was impossible the only proof would
be their dead bodies lying in the trenches
theyre scum colonel
the whole rotten regiment
a pack of sneaking
whining tail-dragging curs
do you really believe that sir
yes i do that exactly what i believe
and what more
it an incontestable fact
then why not shoot the entire regiment
im perfectly serious
now colonel
youre missing the point entirely
we dont want to slaughter the french
army all we want to do is set an example
if it an example you want take me
take you
yes sir if it an example you want
one man will do as well as a 00
the logical choice is the officer
most responsible for the attack
now colonel i think youre overwrought
this is not a question of officers
paul we dont want to overdo this thing
suppose we just make it a dozen
i was talking of 00 men
now were down to 2
let not haggle over this thing anymore
let get it settled once and for all
so that we can all live with it
well perhaps i was a bit too anxious
to see properjustice meted out
ive spent my entire life in the army
ive always tried
to be true to my principles
that the only mistake
i can ever be accused of
ill settle for this have the company
commanders select one man
from each company
in the first wave three in all
that very reasonable of you paul
the court martial will meet at the chateau
at three oclock this afternoon
will that be convenient for you
i wont be there paul
you wont be there
i think it best that you handle this matter
probably so
general mireau if possible id like to
be appointed counsellor for the accused
ill take the matter under consideration
we can permit that paul
consider it settled colonel
thank you sir
noon straight up i hope
you can stay for lunch colonel
george im afraid
the colonel wont have time
dont deny it paul
youve been hiding this man
keeping him for your own
i think that was very selfish of you
thank you for your courtesy
general
but im afraid there isnt much time
between now and three oclock
of course colonel i shall look forward
to the pleasure of seeing you again
yes captain
they ordered me to report
to you here captain rousseau
yes of course
i wanted to speak to you
about some of your shells falling short
i havent time to go into it now
report back to your command
until further orders
bad stuff demoralises the men
i quite agree with you
the best solution is to shelve him
to another outfit
a court of inquiry
ought to roast him a bit first
in cases like this shells falling short
i always try to avoid an inquiry
it gets around among the men
and makes a bad impression
shelving would be the best discipline
in my opinion
well perhaps youre right
would you excuse me for a moment
a regimental matter
i want to mention to the colonel
ill join you in the dining room
splendid in a moment
thatll be captain sancy
captain renoir and lieutenant roget
yes sir
to meet me at regimental
headquarters in half an hour
yes sir
colonel dax
yes general
id like a word with you
certainly sir
best be sensible about this
sensible sir
listen to me dax give up
this fancy talk with me you understand
colonel broulard seems
to think youre funny i dont
i want you to drop this affair
i beg your pardon sir is that an order
colonel dax when this mess
is cleaned up ill break you
ill find an excuse and
break through the ranks ill ruin you
itll be just what you deserve showing so
little loyalty to your commanding officer
that all colonel
general mireau feels that the attack
on the ant hill yesterday morning
failed because of an inadequate effort
on the part of the st battalion
each of you is to select one man from
your company place him under arrest
and have him ready to appear
before a general court martial
no later than 500 hours this afternoon
the charge is cowardice
in the face of the enemy
you have your orders gentlemen
let carry them out
lieutenant roget killed lejeune
on that patrol
and then blackmailed me into
keeping quiet about the whole thing
that why he picked me
i understand your feelings
but that has nothing to do
with these charges youre being tried for
dont you believe me sir
yes i do
but who else will
youve got no witnesses
besides such charges against an officer
would only antagonise the court
when this is over im going
into the story of that patrol again
sir in my case captain renoir
had the sergeant draw lots
i was picked purely by chance
youre lucky look at me
i was just picked because captain sancy
said i was a social undesirable
me a social undesirable
i didnt act like a coward
neither did i
gentlemen you must understand that
the reason you were picked is immaterial
whatever the reason
youre on trial for your lives
stick to the stories youve told me dont
let the prosecutor shake you out of it
youll be soldiers in
the presence of superior officers
so act like what you are soldiers
and brave ones at that
ive been in the room youll be sitting in
the afternoon sun will be in your faces
so dont let it seem as if youre dropping
your eyes in a hangdog manner
when you answer questions
look the judges in the eye
dont whine plead or
make speeches that my job
simple statements short but make them
so they can be heard all over the room
try not to repeat yourselves
ill do that for you when i sum up
we havent much time
the court martial begins in an hour
and ive got notes to look at
good luck
thank you sir
the court martial is open
the prisoners may be seated
this is a general court martial so we shall
dispense with unnecessary formalities
these men are charged with
cowardice in the face of the enemy
and will be tried for that offence
mr prosecutor
call the accused private ferol
mr president will the prosecutor
question the witnesses
without even reading the indictment
please dont take up
the court time with technicalities
the indictment is lengthy
and there no point in reading it
the defence has a right
to know the exact
the indictment is that the accused
showed cowardice
in the face of the enemy
during the attack on the ant hill
proceed mr prosecutor
call the accused private ferol
private ferol
yes sir
were you in the first wave
during the attack on the ant hill
yes sir
did you refuse to advance
no sir
did you advance
yes sir
how far did you advance
to about the middle of no-man-land sir
then what did you do
there were machine-gun bullets
answer the question what did you do
well i saw that me and meyer
i didnt ask you what you saw
the court has no concern
with your visual experiences
my what sir
the prisoner will reply to the question
yes sir what question was it
you advanced to the middle of
no-man-land what did you do then
then sir
did you go back or forward
i went back sir
in other words private ferol
you retreated
yes sir
that all
the accused may return to his seat
just a minute
mr president id like
to question the witness if i may
proceed colonel
thank you
private when you reached no-man-land
were you alone with private meyer
yes sir
what happened to
the rest of your company
i dont know sir
i guess they had been killed or wounded
you found yourself in the middle of
no-man-land alone with private meyer
yes sir
why didnt you attack
the ant hill single-handed
why didnt you storm the ant hill alone
just me and meyer youre kidding sir
yes im kidding private ferol
thank you that all
i dont see the point
of this line of questioning
im attempting to indicate sir
the utter absurdity
of the line of questioning
used by the prosecutor
mr prosecutor
so you freely admit private ferol
that you retreated
yes sir me and meyer both
i knew we should have took ant hill
but we came on back
that all
the accused may return to his seat
private arnaud
did you advance
yes sir
until i was ordered back
to the trenches by captain renoir
how far did you advance
into the wire sir
the enemy wire i suppose
no sir it was our wire
you mean to tell me that you didnt
advance any further than our wire
no sir i didnt
how far would you say that was
how many metres
i advanced as far as i could
how many metres
not many
not many
now private arnaud
before you were ordered back did you
urge your fellow soldiers forward
most of them were dead or wounded
before they got three steps
beyond the trenches
reply to the question
i didnt urge them on no sir
thank you
private arnaud
at ease please
aside from your sad failure
to give throat to spirited battle cries
did your behaviour differ from
that of other men in your company
objection
that a matter of conjecture
sustained
did any men in your company
get beyond our wire
no sir
is it true that youve
been designated a coward
simply and purely because you drew
a slip of paper marked x
yes sir
i dont see that that significant
it accepted practice in the french army
to pick examples by lot
and since this entire company
advanced only a few metres
picking by lot
was eminently fair in this case
id like to point out that this soldier
has distinguished himself
in some of the bloodiest battles
of the war
with court permission
ill read citations for bravery
that he already earned
on two occasions
first citations in the orders in the army
for bravery
that immaterial colonel
the accused is not being tried for former
bravery but for his recent cowardice
medals are no defence
may i call witnesses to his character
you may not
but you may call witnesses to the effect
that he reached the german wire
mr president no one
in the entire regiment
got anywhere near the german wire
including myself
call the next accused
if youre through colonel
thank you
the prisoner may return to his seat
s0 you never even left the trenches
no sir
that all
corporal paris why didnt
you leave the trenches
major vignon was shot and he fell back
on top of me sir and knocked me cold
were you lying unconscious in
the trenches during the entire attack
yes sir
that all
have you any witnesses to that
no sir i guess everybody
was too busy to notice me
and there were so many others
lying dead anyway
but you have no witnesses
no sir
i only have a rather large cut
on my head sir
that could have been self-inflicted later
thank you you may stand down
mr prosecutor
you can make your plea now
gentlemen of the court
this case speaks for itself
all of us witnessed
the regrettable attack yesterday morning
and i submit that that attack
was a stain on the flag of france
a blot on the honour of every man
woman and child in the french nation
it is to us that the sad
distressing repellent duty falls
gentlemen i ask this court
to find the accused guilty
and impose the penalties prescribed
by the code of military justice
thank you mr prosecutor
colonel would you like
to make your plea
gentlemen of the court
there are times when im ashamed
to be a member of the human race
and this is one such occasion
it impossible for me to summarise
the case for the defence
since the court never allowed me
a reasonable opportunity
to present my case
are you protesting
the authenticity of this court
yes sir i protest against being
prevented from introducing evidence
that i consider vital to the defence
the prosecution presented no witnesses
there has never been a written indictment
of charges made against the defendants
and lastly i protest against the fact
that no stenographic records
of this trial have been kept
the attack yesterday morning
is no stain on the honour of france
and certainly no disgrace
to the fighting men of this nation
but this court martial
is such a stain and such a disgrace
the case made against these men
is a mockery of all human justice
gentlemen of the court
to find these men guilty
will be a crime to haunt each of you
till the day you die
i cant believe that
the noblest impulse of man
his compassion for another
can be completely dead here
therefore i humbly beg you
show mercy to these men
the accused will be escorted back to
the guardroom the hearing is closed
the court will now retire to deliberate
there will be a guard of six men
under arms rifles loaded bayonets fixed
two men to each prisoner
any sign of trouble
the prisoners will be instantly covered
if the trouble doesnt subside at once
the prisoner will be shot on the spot
everything must all go off without a hitch
and with the least possible delay
it shouldnt be hurried
but there must be no fumbling around
ive been put in charge
and made personally responsible
for any lack of order or for any mistakes
but you can take it from me that i shall
pass on any blame and with interest
to any one of you who fails in his duties
execution will take place at seven oclock
according to the verdict
of the court martial
detail attention dismissed
this is compliments of general mireau
duck
well tell him thanks
dont blame me soldier
are we supposed to eat
this with our fingers
the guard says you cant
have any knives or forks
is this supposed to be our last meal
or something
it isnt supposed to be our last meal
it is our last meal
this duck is terrific
do you suppose they put
anything in the food
first they poison us then they shoot us
i think they put something in it
like what
like uh something
to make us groggy or something
what would be wrong
with that if they did
maybe nothing for you
but im gonna get out of this somehow
and i dont wanna be drugged
how are you gonna get out
chew your way through that stone wall
i dont know colonel dax
hell see us through
listen we gotta get outta here
theyre gonna kill us in a few hours
if we dont
have you got an idea
no but there gotta be a way
how many guards
do you think theyve got out there
they may have a couple of squads
that what it sounded like this morning
maybe theyre some of our friends
that the 3rd battalion
anyway right now we have no friends
why kid yourself
were not gonna get out of this
maybe youre not but i am
ill guarantee you of that
see that cockroach
tomorrow morning
well be dead and itll be alive
itll have more contact
with my wife and child than i will
ill be nothing and itll be alive
now youve got the edge on him
good evening my sons im father dupré
is there any news
im afraid i bring you very bad news
you must prepare yourselves
for the worst
colonel dax asked me to tell you
oh mercy no
he been in telephone contact
with army headquarters
but unable to speak to general broulard
or for that matter to anyone in authority
the same way at division
no one wants to be found
how much time do we have
you have plenty of time yet
certainly more than enough
to prepare yourselves
in nomine patris et filii
et spiritus sancti
amen
father will you take this letter
for me please
of course my son
it to my wife she wont understand
this and i tried to explain it to her
ill see that she gets it
do you want me to hear your confession
well father to tell you the truth
im not very religious
i know youre trying to help
and i appreciate it
but if i started praying now
id feel like a hypocrite
that an error my son god is
always ready to listen to your prayers
all right father
will you please hear my confession now
yes
have faith in your creator my son
death comes to us all
the father the son and the holy ghost
that really deep
death comes to us all
that really is deep
say ferol what the matter
afraid your luck isnt going to hold out
well look this is my religion
o great bottle forgive me my sins
for now i lay me down to sleep
may i drink you first thank you amen
i understand your anguish my son
but you must not let it harden your heart
may i tell you something father
back in my home town
there was a certain little café
with an amusing sign over the bar
it read do not be afraid to ask for credit
for our way of refusing is very polite
come on arnaud sit down youre drunk
oh paris leave me alone
get out of here with
your sanctimonious pat answers
what are you hanging around here for
to torture us
no to help you with all my power
your power you have no power
god has power
does he what a laugh
you can be saved
saved ill be saved
cut it out arnaud
arnaud
arnaud
father get a doctor quick
that should keep him quiet long enough
that a nasty skull fracture though
he may not live out the night
what are we supposed to do with him
my advice is to tie him to a stretcher
so he wont slip
when you tilt him vertically
surely they wont execute
a man in that condition
im sorry father
the sentence will be carried out
ive already checked with the general
if he still alive in the morning
pinch his cheeks a couple of times
before you take him out on the field
it may make him open his eyes
the general wants him to be conscious
yes
lieutenant roget reporting sir
come in
sergeant boulanger
said you wanted to see me sir
yes lieutenant
looks as if we have a pretty unpleasant
thing on our hands in a few hours
you mean the execution sir
yes i mean the execution
yes sir it very unfortunate
very unfortunate
that just how i feel about it
none of us are happy about it sir
how did you happen
to pick corporal paris
well i had to pick somebody sir
that right you did
of course you had no personal motive
in picking paris did you
oh no sir
you picked him because
he was a coward didnt you
did you or didnt you
oh yes sir i did
like you say somebody had to be picked
it was quite a problem sir
yes i had the same kind of problem
i have to pick someone
to be in charge of
the firing squad tomorrow
do you have any objections
to taking the job
me sir
yes you
what the matter dont you feel well
no yeah i feel all right sir
it just that i
would you like me to open a window
no sir
well it just that ive never been
in charge of a firing squad before sir
oh there nothing to it first you help
the sergeant tie the men to the posts
of course you offer the men blindfolds
and if they want them you tie them on
you take your position with the firing
squad raise your sword ready aim fire
then you draw your revolver out
you walk forward
and put a bullet through each man head
sir i request that i be
excused from this duty
request denied
colonel
youve got the job it all yours
that all lieutenant
colonel if you could
that all lieutenant
yes
excuse me sir colonel dax
yes
my name is rousseau sir
captain of artillery
what is it captain
i have something to tell you sir that may
have a great bearing on the court martial
come in captain
colonel good evening
good evening sir
good evening come and sit down
thank you sir
im really sorry to intrude
on you in this way
not at all im always delighted
to see you colonel dax
will you have a cigar
no thank you sir
well i
i think youll find it delicious
i apologise for not inviting you
to join the party downstairs tonight
but im afraid that it a dress affair
thank you sir but i must confess
that this is not entirely a social visit
oh come dax let not go
over all that ground again
i must admit that judging
from the casualties
the efforts of your regiment
must have been considerable
how can you understand that
and allow these men to be shot tomorrow
colonel youre choosing to take
a rather simple view of this
the attack was impossible from the start
the general staff
must have known that
colonel dax we think were doing
a good job running the war
you must be aware of the fact
that the general staff is subject
to all kinds of unfair pressures
from newspapers and politicians
maybe the attack against
the ant hill was impossible
perhaps it was an error of judgement
on our part on the other hand
if your men had been a little more daring
they might have taken it who knows
in any case
why should we have to bear any more
criticism for the failure than we have to
aside from the inescapable fact
that a good many of your men
never left the trenches
there the question of the troops morale
dont forget that
the troops morale
certainly
these executions will be
a tonic for the division
there are few things more fundamentally
encouraging and stimulating
than seeing someone else die
i never thought of that sir
you see colonel troops are like children
just as a child wants his father to
be firm troops crave discipline
one way to maintain discipline
is to shoot a man now and then
may i ask do you sincerely believe
all the things youve just said
it been a pleasure discussing this with
you but id better get back to my guests
forgive me for having
kept you from your party
by the way sir
have you heard that general mireau
ordered his own battery
commander captain rousseau
to open fire on his own positions
during the attack
of course the captain refused
without a written order
but general mireau demanded that
he commence firing on our own trenches
rousseau refused
without an order in writing
but again he was ordered and again
he refused all in front of witnesses
do you actually believe
this fantastic story
here are copies of the sworn statements
from all the principals involved
battery commander rousseau
captain nichols the artillery spotter
the telephone clerk and uh
my own deposition
what has all this got to do with the charge
against the condemned prisoners
a general in a tantrum
over the failure of an impossible attack
orders his artillery to
fire on his own men
now the same officer on the same day
orders a court martial in which
three of his men are sentenced to be shot
general what would your newspapers
and your politicians do with that
colonel dax
are you trying to blackmail me
sir that an ugly word
but you are in a difficult position
too much has happened someone
got to be hurt the only question is who
general mireau assault
on the ant hill failed
his order to fire on
his own troops was refused
but his attempt to murder three innocent
men to protect his own reputation
will be prevented by the general staff
will you pardon me colonel dax
ive been rude to my guests too long
detail halt
order arms
fall out
courage my sons the worst is over

george
this sort of thing is always rather grim
but this one had a kind of splendour to it
i have never seen an affair
of this sort handled any better
the men died wonderfully
there always that chance
that one of them will do something
that would leave a bad taste
this time you couldnt ask for better
yes
yes colonel
you wanted to see me sir
oh yes yes
come in colonel and sit down
colonel dax your men died very well
would you like some coffee colonel
no thank you sir
by the way ive been told
that you ordered your artillery
to fire on your own men
during the attack on the ant hill
i did what who told you that
colonel dax came to me
last night with the story
colonel dax ive always known
that you were a disloyal officer
but i never dreamed that you
would stoop to anything so low as this
general i have sworn statements from
captain nichols your artillery spotter
captain rousseau the battery commander
who refused your order
i think it infamous absolutely infamous
then there no truth at all in the charge
made by colonel dax
i dont see how you can even ask me that
you cannot imagine
how glad i am to hear that paul
im certain that
youll come through it all right
ill come through what
therell have to be an inquiry
an inquiry
it wont amount to much
those things never do
the public forgets
public
you have the right to clear your name
you cannot allow such violent insinuations
against your character to go undenied
so that it
youre making me the goat -
the only completely innocent man
in this whole affair
i have only one last thing
to say to you george
the man you stabbed in the back
is a soldier
well it had to be done
france cannot afford to have
fools guiding her military destiny
im grateful to you for bringing
the matter to my attention
colonel dax how would you like
general mireau job
his what sir
his job
let me get this straight sir
youre offering me
general mireau command
come colonel dax
dont overdo the surprise
youve been after the job from the start
we all know that my boy
i may be many things sir
but im not your boy
well i certainly didnt mean to imply
any biological relationship
im not your boy in any sense
are you trying to provoke me colonel
why should i want to do that
exactly it would be a pity to lose
your promotion before you get it
a promotion you have
so very carefully planned for
sir would you like me to suggest
what you can do with that promotion
colonel dax
you will apologise at once or else
youll be placed under arrest
i apologise for not being
entirely honest with you
i apologise for not
revealing my true feelings
i apologise for not telling you sooner that
you are a degenerate sadistic old man
and you can go to hell before
i apologise to you now or ever again
colonel dax
youre a disappointment to me
you have spoiled the keenness of
your mind by wallowing in sentimentality
you really did want to save those men
and you were not angling
for mireau command
youre an idealist and i pity you
as i would the village idiot
were fighting a war
a war weve got to win
those men didnt fight so they were shot
you bring charges against general
mireau so i insist that he answer them
wherein have i done wrong
because you dont know
the answer to that question
i pity you
thank you
gentlemen we have a little
special entertainment for you
sort of a little
diversion as it were
as my wife always says what
is life without a little diversion
now gentlemen i give you
our latest acquisition from the enemy
from germany the land of the hun
gentlemen a little pearl washed
ashore by the tide of the war
