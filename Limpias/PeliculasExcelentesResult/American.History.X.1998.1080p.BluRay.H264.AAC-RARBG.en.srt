we got a whole file on skinheads
these all part of the same gang
venice beach gang
where my buddy
he doing a stretch at ya
this guy cc
mm-hm
that him
yeah that him right there
this morning we have a guest coming in
and there he is
morning
morning sir
good to see you pal
morning
gentlemen this here is dr bob sweeney
he principal over at venice beach high
he been doing outreach work with gangs
both in and out of the can
three years ago
a local kid named derek vinyard
was sent up for murdering two crips
who were trying to jack his car
bob taught vinyard back in high school
and he followed the case closely
he was a skinhead right
he was more like the skinhead
the protégé of cameron alexander
who
cameron alexander
here you go have a look-see
cameron alexander well
he a venice beach landmark
he probably the biggest distributor
of white-power literature and videos
in la county
he promotes white-power bands
he writes reviews
and uh in his spare time
this guy even writes hate columns
does he have a record
he pretty clean
been trying to pin something to him
but it doesnt work
trust me he behind all of it
he runs everything out of his house
down by the beach
no white gangs in venice beach
before cameron alexander
and derek vinyard hooked up
alexander found in derek
his shining prince
essentially he used derek
to recruit a slew of insecure
frustrated and impressionable kids
this kid vinyard well
he got a lot of baggage
as youll see in this tape
that weve gotten courtesy of nbc
la county firefighter dennis vinyard
was shot and killed battling a blaze
at a suspected compton drug den
were at the vinyard home right now
and lieutenant vinyard oldest son
derek has agreed to talk with us
derek if you could come down here
please for just a second
look i know this is tough
but um how do you feel right now
how do you think i feel
i think it typical
typical how
this country becoming a haven
for criminals so what do you expect
decent hardworking americans
like my dad
are getting rubbed out
by social parasites
parasites
blacks browns yellow whatever
i dont understand
youre saying your father murder
was race-related
yeah it race-related
every problem in this country
is race-related not just crime
immigration aids welfare those are
problems of the black community
the hispanic community
asian community not white problems
arent those issues
that deal more with poverty
no theyre not products of their
environments either that crap
minorities dont give two shits
about this country
they come here to exploit it
not to embrace it
millions of white european-americans
came here and flourished
within a generation what the fuck
is the matter with these people
they have to go around shooting at firemen
what does this have to do with your father
my father was murdered doing his job
putting out a fire
in a nigger neighborhood
he shouldnt have given
a shit about
he got shot by a fucking drug dealer
who probably collects a welfare check
that enough
im sorry
derek vinyard was released
from chino earlier this morning
after serving three and some-odd years
i think this is something
we gotta keep an eye on
if something happens to him
things could get very ugly
down by the beach
just keep it low
venice beach didnt always look like this
it used to be a great neighborhood
the boardwalk always been a dump
but when my dad moved us out here
venice was a nice quiet place
to grow up
over the years though
it just gone to hell
the gangs are like a plague
they moved west from inglewood
and south central
and basically took over

aw jesus fucking christ
have a little self-respect
all right listen up
we need to open our eyes
there over 2 million illegal immigrants
bedding down in this state tonight
this state spent $3 billion last year
on services for people who had
no right to be here in the first place
three billion dollars
four hundred million dollars just to lock up
a bunch of illegal immigrant criminals
who only got into this country
because the ins decided
it not worth the effort
to screen for convicted felons
who gives a shit
our government doesnt give a shit
our border policy is a joke
so is anybody surprised that south
of the border theyre laughing at us
laughing at our laws
yeah
every night these parasites
stream across the border
like some fucking piñata exploded
ha-ha-ha
dont laugh
there nothing funny going on here
this is about your life and mine
it about decent hardworking americans
falling through the cracks
and getting the shaft
the government cares about
the constitutional rights of a bunch of
people who arent citizens of this country
on the statue of liberty it says give me
your tired your hungry your poor
well it americans who are
tired and hungry and poor
and i say until you take care of that
close the fucking book
because were losing
were losing our right
to pursue our destiny
were losing our freedom
so that a bunch of fucking foreigners
can come in and exploit our country
and this isnt something
that going on far away
this isnt happening in places
we cant do anything about it
it happening right here right in our
neighborhood right in that building
archie miller ran that grocery store
since we were kids here
dave worked there mike worked there
he went under and now some fucking
korean owns it who fired these guys
and is making a killing because
he hired 40 fucking border-jumpers
i see this shit going on and i dont see
anybody doing anything about it
and it fucking pisses me off
so look around you
this isnt our neighborhood
it a battlefield
were on a battlefield tonight
make a decision
are we gonna stand on the sidelines
quietly standing there
while our country gets raped
fuck that
are we gonna ante up
and do something
fuck yeah
hell yeah
youre goddamn right we are
come here
dont you know it against the law
to hire border-jumpers you nip bastard
fuck that fuck that
sweetheart no you dont need this
were not gonna hurt you
please please no
you fucking spic
you know what
i think this bitch is hungry
this bitch stinks
get me cleaning products
smells like fish and chips
and guacamole
here we go
yeah that it
get the fuck up
get down
have some fucking beans
you goddamn beaner
yeah
take my job
you donkey bitch
get some of that in there
throw it on throw it on
hey that a great color on you
you can get a white woman job
bitch
a little better than this one huh
yeah
white
you can move up in the world huh
asshole
let go were out of here
everybody out let go now now
all right let go let go
let go
come on let go let go let go
let go
no green card no fucking work
comprendes
come on come on
go go go
were fucking done come on
dad was gone
but things were almost normal again
derek had a good job
mom was starting to live a little
everyone was feeling so good
that we just didnt see it coming
maybe we should have
the irony is that most of the stores
that were destroyed during the riots
were owned by black people
that stupid though
why trash your own neighborhood
well that my point
it an irrational act
it like an expression of rage
by people who feel neglected
and turned away by the system
exactly
i mean it like we had in watts
or the riots in chicago in 68—
i dont buy that for a minute
calling a riot an irrational expression
of rage that such a cop-out
it opportunism at its worst
a bunch of people
grabbing any excuse they can find
to go and loot a store
the fact these people ripped off stores
in their own communities
reflects that these people
have no respect for the law
and certainly no concept of community
or civic responsibility
wait a minute white people commit
crimes against white people too
but theyre not offing each other
in record numbers all over america
look at the statistics for chrissakes
one in every three black males is in
some phase of the correctional system
is that a coincidence or do these people
have a racial commitment to crime
not only that theyre proud of it
maybe it says something about prejudice
in the judicial system
if you wanna talk about
criminal statistics
you might wanna take a look at
the social inequalities that produce them
yap yap you know what
that exactly what i hate
youre taking one thing
and calling it something else
and alleviating the responsibility that
these people have for their own actions
it like saying
it not a riot it rage
it not crime it poverty
it just nonsense it bullshit it
exactly what happened in this trial too
because the media twisted things around
so people focused on these cops
whether theyd get convicted
and whether rodney king
civil rights had been violated
everybody lost sight
of rodney king himself
the guy a multiple felon
by his own admission
he high as a goddamn kite driving
20 miles an hour down the highway
he gets pulled over by a bunch of cops
and he attacks them
he attacked police officers
bottom line and he walked
and there some yahoo with a video
camera who turned it on halfway through
so all we see is them hitting him
exactly powell and koon winding up
and cracking him with billy clubs
and briseno kicking him
in the back of the skull
and people are going
oh this poor guy
poor guy who attacked 4 cops
and those cops end up on the stand
defending themselves
for using absolutely standard
textbook self-defense procedures
i dont think the tape showed that at all
you didnt think so
and what youre an authority ma
murray what do you think
i did think that the police used
their clubs rather excessively
who are you to say what excessive
i think it was totally appropriate
theyre in a better position
to make that call than you are
in fact we as society grant cops a certain
amount of authority to make those calls
because we acknowledge that their job
is difficult and dangerous
you know unfortunately very few
people like respect that authority
look who talking about respect here
mr junior-kkk
what
davina
you wanna go to college davina
you should learn to listen
i didnt say i respected laws
i acknowledge a cop authority
i dont respect laws that let monkeys
like rodney king on the street
second i am not as you well know
a member of a low-rent disorganized
bunch of rednecks like the fucking kkk
please so take your head
out of your ass
youve gotten off the point
i had a point that wasnt the point
do you have one what is your point
all right think about this
if danny had been
walking across the street
and rodney king had plowed into him—
can we just drop this rodney king thing
mm-hm
who would like some dessert
were having a discussion
were having a nice discussion right
if rodney king had been hopped up
on chivas regal and pcp
and killed danny
youd sing a different tune
i didnt see him hit anybody
and neither did you
he didnt happen to kill anybody
thank god
keep it down okay ally sleeping
if he had though come on think about it
if that monkey had run some kid over
everybody would have a different
opinion of this matter
theyd be focused on rodney king
and not on these officers

all on this one book
native son i dont know that

what i read
honey they dont teach
tom clancy at school

so what is it what is this native son
what is it
it this book about this black guy

honey a few new books doesnt
qualify as affirmative black action
read the book ace the guy test
just dont swallow everything
he feeds you whole
just because you see it on the news
but like what
all this stuff about making everything
equal it not that simple
now you got this book native son
what happened to the other books
in the course
theyre not any good anymore because
mr two-phds says they arent
are you gonna trade in great books
for black books does that make sense
you gotta question these things derek
you gotta look at the whole picture
were talking about books here
but im also talking about my job
i got two black guys on my squad now
who got their job
over a couple of white guys
who actually scored higher on the test
that make sense huh
yeah sure everything equal now
but i got two guys watching my back
responsible for my life
who arent as good as two others
they got the job because they were black
not because they were the best
that sucks

i saw a car cruising by the house last
night when i pulled out of there with seth
if you get home before me
look around the street all right
make sure there nothing going on
oh man this is bad

derek no
get out of my way
all right all right
get out of my way
let him go
oh no no no no
oh jesus
no
oh no no no
oh jesus
god what did i do
oh god
oh god
so i guess this is where
i tell you what i learned
my conclusion right
well my conclusion is
hate is baggage
life too short
to be pissed off all the time
it just not worth it
derek says it always good
to end a paper with a quote
he says someone else
has already said it best
so if you cant top it
steal from them and go out strong
so i picked a guy i thought youd like
we are not enemies but friends
we must not be enemies
though passion may have strained
it must not break
our bonds of affection
the mystic chords of memory
will swell when again touched
as surely they will be
by the better angels of our nature
