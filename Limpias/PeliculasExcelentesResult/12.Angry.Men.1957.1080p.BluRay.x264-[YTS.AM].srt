you did a wonderful job wonderful
you did it you did it
to continue youve listened to a long and complex case murder in the first degree
premeditated murder is the most serious charge tried in our criminal courts
youve listened to the testimony had the law interpreted as it applies in this case
lt now your duty to sit down and try and separate the facts from the fancy
one man is dead another man life is at stake
lf there a reasonable doubt in your minds as to the guilt of the accused -
a reasonable doubt then you must bring me a verdict of not guilty
lf there no reasonable doubt then you must in good conscience
find the accused guilty
however you decide your verdict must be unanimous
ln the event that you find the accused guilty
the bench will not entertain a recommendation for mercy
the death sentence is mandatory in this case
you are faced with a grave responsibility thank you gentlemen
the alternate jurors are excused
the jury will now retire
wanna piece of gum no thanks

what the difference lt reasonable to sit in order
let it be that twelve we go around one two
what was your impression of the prosecuting attorney
l beg pardon l thought he was really sharp
the way he handled all those points one by one in logical sequence
l was very impressed l think he he did an expert job
a lot of drive too you know real drive
ok fellas can we hold it down a minute fellas
say wed like to get started

and well we can vote on it right now
l think it customary to take a preliminary vote
yeah let vote who knows maybe we can all get outta here
ok then l think that you know that we have a first-degree murder charge here
and if we vote the accused guilty weve got to send him to the chair
um that mandatory

eight nine ten eleven
ok that eleven guilty
those voting not guilty
one right
eleven guilty one not guilty well now we know where we are

so what do we do now
l guess we talk boy oh boy
you really think he innocent
l dont know you sat in court with the rest of us
you heard what we did the kid a dangerous killer
he 8 years old well that old enough
he stabbed his own father four inches into the chest
they proved it a dozen different ways in court
would you like me to list em for you no
then what do you want l just want to talk
what there to talk about eleven of us think he guilty
no one had to think about it twice except you
l want to ask you something do you believe his story
l dont know maybe l dont so how come you voted not guilty
there were eleven votes for guilty
lt not easy to raise my hand and send a boy off to die without talking about it first
well now who says it easy no one
what just because l voted fast l honestly think the guy is guilty
couldnt change my mind if you talked for 00 years
lm not trying to change your mind lt just that
this is somebody life we cant decide in five minutes
supposing were wrong supposing this building fell on my head
you can suppose anything that right
what the difference how long it takes supposin we take five minutes so what
let take an hour the ball game doesnt start till eight oclock
who got something to say lm willing to sit for an hour
great l heard a good story last night that not why were sitting here
all right then you tell me what are we sitting here for
l dont know maybe no reason
look this kid been kicked around all of his life
you know born in a slum mother dead since he was nine
he lived for a year and a half in an orphanage
when his father was serving a jail term for forgery
that not a very happy beginning
he a wild angry kid that all he ever been and you know why
cos he been hit on the head by somebody once a day every day
he had a pretty miserable 8 years l think we owe him a few words that all
l dont mind telling you this mister we dont owe him a thing he got a fair trial
what do you think that trial cost he lucky he got it know what l mean
look were all grown-ups in here we heard the facts didnt we
youre not gonna tell me were supposed to believe this kid knowing what he is
lve lived among them all my life
you cant believe a word they say you know that l mean theyre born liars
only an ignorant man can believe that now listen
do you think you were born with a monopoly on the truth
certain things should be pointed out to this man
lt not sunday we dont need a sermon we have a job to do now let do it
rice pops lt a product l work on at the agency
the breakfast with the built-in bounce
l wrote that line very catchy
say do you mind lm sorry l have this habit of doodling
lt keeps me thinking clearly we have work to do
there no point staying here for ever ok
perhaps if the gentleman down there who is disagreeing with us could tell us why
tell us what youre thinking we might be able to show you where youre mixed up
maybe this is an idea lt seems to me that it up to us to convince this gentleman
that he wrong and were right maybe if we each took a couple of minutes just to
well it was just a quick idea no no no that a good one
supposing we go once around the table
l guess youre first
lt hard to put into words
l just think he guilty
l thought it was obvious from the word go nobody proved otherwise
nobody has to prove otherwise the burden of proof on the prosecution
the defendant doesnt even have to open his mouth that in the constitution
sure l know that what l meant was
well l just think he guilty l mean somebody saw him do it
ok here what l think and l have no personal feelings about this
l just wanna talk about facts
number one
the old man lived downstairs under the room where the killing took place
at 0 minutes after 2 on the night of the killing he heard loud noises
said it sounded like a fight
and he heard the kid yell out lm gonna kill ya
a second later he heard a body hit the floor
ran to the door opened it up saw the kid run down the stairs and out of the house
called the police they found the old man with the knife in his chest
the coroner fixed the time of death around midnight
now these are facts you cant refute facts the kid is guilty
lm just as sentimental as the next fella l know he only 8
but he still gotta pay for what he did lm with you
ok are you finished yeah
lt is obvious to me that the boy entire story was flimsy
he claimed he was at the movies
yet he couldnt remember the names of the films he saw or who played in them
that right and no one saw him at the theatre
and the woman across the street if her testimony dont prove it nothing does
that right she actually saw the killing fellas please let go in order
just a minute here a woman
here a woman who lying in bed she cant sleep she dyin with the heat
she looks out the window and right across the street
she sees the kid stick the knife into his father
the time is 20 on the nose everything fits
she known the kid all his life
his window is opposite hers across the el tracks she swore she saw him do it
through the windows of a passing el train
this el train had no passengers on it lt was just being moved downtown
the lights were out and they proved in court that at night
you can look through the windows and see what happening on the other side
they proved it ld like to ask you something
you dont believe the boy how come you believe the woman
she one of them too isnt she
youre a pretty smart fella arent ya ok gentlemen now gentlemen
come on sit down sit down what he so wise about lm telling ya
come on now were not gonna get anywhere fighting
whose turn is it next oh his number five
may l can l pass
well that your privilege
how about the next gentleman
oh well l dont know
l started to be convinced you know very early in the case
you see l was looking for a motive
that very important because if you dont have a motive where your case right
anyway that testimony from those people across the hall from the kid apartment
that was very powerful didnt they say something about a fight an argument
between the old man and his son around about seven oclock that night
l could be wrong but lt was eight oclock not seven
they heard an argument then they heard the father hit the boy twice
finally they saw the boy run angry out of the house what does that prove
lt dont prove anything lt just part of the picture
you said it provided a motive so did the prosecution
that wasnt a very strong motive
this boy has been hit so many times that violence is practically
lt a normal state of affairs with him
l just cant see two slaps in the face provoking him into committing murder
lt may have been two too many everyone has a breaking point
anything else
no ok how about you
l dont know lt all been said
you can talk here for ever lt still the same thing
this kid is five for 0 well look at his record
when he was 0 he was in children court he threw a rock at a teacher
when he was 5 he was in reform school he stole a car
he been arrested for muggin he was picked up twice for knife fightin
they say he real handy with a knife oh this is a very fine boy
ever since he was five his father beat him up regularly he used his fists
so would l a kid like that
lt these kids the way they are nowadays
when l was a kid l used to call my father ir
that right ever hear a kid call his father that any more
fathers dont seem to think it important any more
you got any kids three
l got one
he 22 years old
when he was nine years old he ran away from a fight
l saw it l was so embarrassed l almost threw up
l said lm gonna make a man out of you if l have to break you in two tryin
well l made a man out of him
when he was 6 we had a fight
hit me in the jaw he was a big kid
l havent seen him for two years
kids
you work your heart out
well let get goin l think were missing the point
this boy the product of a broken home and a filthy neighbourhood
we cant help that were here to decide his innocence or guilt
not to go into the reasons why he grew up the way he did
he was born in a slum slums are breeding grounds for criminals
lt no secret that children from slums are potential menaces to society l think
you can say that again the kids who crawl out of these places are real trash
l dont want any part of them listen l lve lived in a slum all my life
wait a minute please l
lve played in back yards that were filled with garbage
maybe you can still smell it on me listen sonny
come on now there nothing personal
come on fella he didnt mean you let not be so sensitive
this sensitivity l can understand
ok look let stop the arguing were only wasting time
your turn down there let go
l didnt expect a turn l thought you were all gonna to try to convince me
that was the idea l forgot he right
he the one keeping us in here let hear what he got to say
wait we decided to do this a certain way l think we ought to stick to it
oh stop being a kid will ya
what do you mean a kid what do you think l mean k-l-d kid
just because lm trying to keep this organised
here you take on the responsibility lll just keep my mouth shut
why are you gettin so hot calm down dont tell me to calm down
you want to take the chair take the chair
did you ever see such a thing
you think it funny forget it fella lt unimportant
unimportant here you try it
nobody wants to change youre doing a beautiful job
yeah youre doin great just great fella you stay in there and pitch
all right let hear from somebody
well if you want me to tell you how l feel about it it all right with me
boy l dont care what you do all right l dont have anything brilliant
l only know as much as you do
according to the testimony the boy looks guilty maybe he is
l sat there in court for six days listening while the evidence built up
everybody sounded so positive
l began to get a peculiar feeling about this trial l mean nothing is that positive
there are questions ld have liked to ask maybe they wouldnt mean anything but
l felt that the defence wasnt conducting a thorough enough cross-examination
he let too many things go by little things
what little things when they dont ask questions
it because they know the answers already
lt also possible for a lawyer to be just plain stupid isnt it l mean it possible
you sound like you met my brother-in-law once
l kept putting myself in the kid place ld have asked for another lawyer l think
l mean if l was on trial for my life
ld want my lawyer to tear the prosecution witnesses to shreds or at least try to
look there was one alleged eyewitness to this killing
someone else claims he heard the killing saw the boy run out after
and there was circumstantial evidence
but those two witnesses were the entire case for the prosecution
supposing theyre wrong
what do you mean what the point of having witnesses at all
could they be wrong those people were under oath
theyre only people people make mistakes could they be wrong
well no l dont think so do you know so
nobody can know a thing like that this isnt an exact science
that right it isnt
ok let get to the point
what about the switch knife they found in the old man chest
some people havent talked yet shouldnt we go in order
theyll get a chance to talk be quiet a second will ya
what about the knife this fine upright boy admitted buying the night of the killing
let talk about it all right let get it in here and look at it
ld like to see it again mr foreman why do we have to see it again
the gentleman has a right to see exhibits in evidence
say could you bring us the knife the knife sure
the knife and the way it was bought is strong evidence dont you think
l do good let take the facts one at a time
one the boy admitted leaving the house at eight oclock at night
after being slapped by his father
no he didnt say lapped he said punched there a difference
after being hit several times by his father
two he went directly to a local junk shop where he bought one of those
switch knives switchblade knives
this wasnt an ordinary knife lt had a very unusual carved handle and blade
the storekeeper said it was the only one of its kind he had ever had in stock
three he met some friends of his in front of a tavern about 845 am l right so far
yes you are you bet he is
he talked with his friends for an hour leaving them at 945
during this time they saw the switch knife
four they identified the death weapon in court as that very same knife
five he arrived home at about ten oclock
this is where the stories offered by the state and the boy diverge slightly
he claims that he went to a movie at about 30
returning home at 370 to find his father dead and himself arrested
he also claims that the two detectives threw him down a half a flight of stairs
what happened to the knife he claims it fell through a hole in his pocket
on the way to the movies sometime between 30 and 30
and that he never saw it again now there is a tale gentlemen
l think it clear the boy never went to the movies that night
no one in the house saw him go out no one at the theatre identified him
he couldnt even remember the names of the pictures he saw
what actually happened is this
the boy stayed home had another fight with his father
stabbed him to death and left the house at 0 minutes after 2
he even wiped the knife clean of fingerprints
are you trying to tell me that this knife fell through a hole in the boy pocket
someone picked it up went to the boy house
and stabbed his father with it just to test its sharpness
no but it possible the boy lost his knife
and somebody else stabbed his father with a similar knife
take a look at this knife
lt a very unusual knife
lve never seen one like it neither had the storekeeper who sold it to the boy
arent you asking us to accept an incredible coincidence
lm just saying a coincidence is possible and l say it not possible
where did that come from
lt the same knife what do you think youre doin
where did you get it l went out walking last night
through the boy neighbourhood
l bought that at a pawn shop two blocks from the boy house lt cost six dollars
lt against the law to buy or sell switchblade knives
that right l broke the law you pulled a real bright trick
now supposing you tell me what it proves
maybe there are ten knives like that maybe there are
what does it mean you found a knife like it what that the discovery of the age
you think somebody else did the stabbing with exactly the same kind of knife
the odds are a million to one lt possible
but not very probable ok fellas let take our seats
there no point standing around all over the place
lt interesting that hed find a knife exactly like the boy
what interesting about it lnteresting l just thought it was interesting
eleven of us still think he guilty
right youre not gonna change anybody mind
lf you wanna hang this jury go ahead
the kidll be tried again and found guilty as sure as he born
youre probably right
so what are you gonna do we can be here all night
lt only one night a boy may die
well why dont we just set up house here
someone send for a pinochle deck
and well just sweat the whole thing out right here
l dont think he oughta joke about it what do you want me to do about it
l dont see what the knife has got to do with anything
somebody saw the kid stab his father what more do we need
you guys can talk the ears right off my head
l got three garages going to pot so let get done and get outta here
the knife was important to the district attorney he spent a day
he a 5th assistant or something what does he know
let hold it down these side arguments are only slowin us up
well what about it youre the only one
l have a proposition to make to all of you lm going to call for another vote
l want you eleven men to
vote by secret written ballot
lll abstain lf there are eleven votes for guilty l wont stand alone
well take in a guilty verdict to the judge right now
but if anyone votes not guilty well stay here and talk it out
that it lf you want to try it lm ready all right let do it the hard way
that sounds fair everyone agreed anyone doesnt agree
ok pass these along
guilty
guilty
guilty
guilty
guilty
guilty
guilty
guilty
guilty
not guilty
guilty
boy how do you like that and another chap flips his wings
all right who was it come on l wanna know
excuse me this was a secret ballot we all agreed on that no
lf the gentleman wants it to remain secret
secret what do you mean there are no secrets in a jury room l know who it was
brother you really are somethin you vote guilty like the rest of us
then some golden-voiced preacher tears your heart out -
some underprivileged kid couldnt help becoming a murderer -
and you change your vote lf that isnt the most sickening
why dont you drop a quarter in his collection box
oh now just wait a listen you cant talk to me like that who do you think you are
calm down calm down lt doesnt matter
he very excitable sit down excitable you bet lm excitable
were tryin to put a guilty man in the chair where he belongs
someone starts tellin us fairy tales and were listenin
what made you change your vote he didnt change his vote l did
oh fine l knew it
would you like me to tell you why no l wouldnt like you to tell me why
ld like to anyway if you dont mind do we have to listen to this
the man wants to talk thank you
this gentleman has been standing alone against us
he doesnt say the boy is not guilty
he just isnt sure lt not easy to stand alone against the ridicule of others
so he gambled for support and l gave it to him l respect his motives
the boy on trial is probably guilty but l want to hear more
the vote is ten to two lm talking you have no right to leave this room
he cant hear you he never will let sit down
shall we continue well l think we ought to take a break
you know one man inside and l think we ought to wait for him
looks like were really hung up here huh
l mean that thing with the old man that was pretty unexpected
wish l could figure out some way we could break it up
you know in advertising l told you l worked in an agency
some pretty strange people work there well not strange really
l guess it just they have peculiar ways of expressing themselves
l suppose it the same in your business too huh
what do you do lm a watchmaker
really l imagine the finest watchmakers in the world come from europe
anyway in an agency when we reach a point like this
lm telling him in an ad agency when a point like this is reached in a meeting
there always some character ready with an idea see
lt kills me lt the weirdest thing
the way they sometimes precede their idea with a phrase
like some account exec will get up and hell say
ok here an idea let run it up the flagpole and see if anyone salutes it
l mean it idiotic but it funny
l got a little excited back there
l didnt mean to get nasty
glad youre not one of those who lets these emotional appeals influence him
l dont know what the matter with that fan
are you a salesman lm an architect
you know what the soft sell is
well youve got it believe me
lve got a different technique
laughs drinks jokes tricks you know
yeah
hit em where they live that my motto
l made 27 grand last year sellin marmalade
that not bad l mean you know considerin marmalade
what are you gettin out of this kicks
or did somebody bump you on the head once and you havent gotten over it
maybe you know you do-gooders are all alike
youre always blowin your stacks over some guy that fanned
but what are you wastin our time for
why dont you donate five dollars to the cause maybe itll make you feel better
this kid is guilty pal
lt as plain as the nose on your face so why dont we stop wastin our time here
were gonna all get sore throats if we keep it up
what difference does it make if you get it here or at the ball game
no difference pal
no difference at all
nice bunch of guys huh theyre about the same as anyone else
boy what a murderous day
do you think well be much longer l dont know
he guilty for sure not a doubt in the whole world
we shouldve we shouldve been done already
oh l dont mind you know
beats workin
you think he not guilty huh l dont know lt possible
well l dont know you but lm bettin youve never been wronger in your life
youre wastin your time you ought to wrap it up
supposing you were the one who was on trial
well lm not used to supposin lm just a workin man
my boss does the supposin but
lll try one
supposin you talk us all out of this and
the kid really did knife his father huh
are you ready
sorry blue eyes
well where else ok fellas let take our seats
looks like well be here for dinner ok now let get down to business
who wants to start l will
ok go you down there
the old man who lived downstairs says he heard the kid yell lm gonna kill ya
a second later he heard the body hit the floor
he ran to the door and saw the kid run out of the house what that mean to you
l wonder how clearly he heard the boy voice through the ceiling
he didnt the window was open so was the one upstairs lt was a hot night
lt was another apartment lt not easy to identify a shouting voice
he identified it in court
the lady across the street looked right in the open window and saw the stabbing
lsnt that enough for you no it isnt
boy how do you like this guy lt like talkin into a dead phone
she said she saw it through the windows of a moving el train
there were six cars on the train she saw it through the last two
she remembered insignificant details how can you argue with that
has anybody here any idea how long it would take an el
this isnt a game
did you see him
the nerve the absolute nerve
forget it lt not important this isnt a game
who does he think he is forget it now
any idea how long it takes an el train at medium speed to pass a given point
what has that to do with it guess
l wouldnt have any idea what do you think
l dont know ten twelve seconds a pretty good guess anyone else
sounds right to me what the guessing game for
what do you say ten seconds
all right what are you getting at this
lt takes a six-car el train ten seconds to pass a given point
say the given point is the open window of the room where the killing took place
you can reach out and almost touch the el tracks right
now let me ask you this has anyone here ever lived near the el tracks
l just finished painting an apartment that overlooked an el line lt took three days
what was it like noisy oh brother no matter we were punchy
l lived in an apartment near the el line once
when the window open the train noise is almost unbearable
you can hardly hear yourself think will you get to the point
l will now let take two pieces of testimony and try to put them together
first the old man in the apartment downstairs
he says he heard the boy say lm gonna kill you
and a split second later heard a body hit the floor
one second later right
second the woman across the street
swore positively she looked out of the window and saw the killing
through the last two cars of a passing el train the last two cars
what are you givin us here now just a minute
weve agreed that it takes ten seconds for a train to pass a given point
since the woman saw the killing through the last two cars
we can assume that the body hit the floor just as the train went by
therefore the train had been roaring by the old man window
a full ten seconds before the body hit the floor
the old man lm gonna kill you body hitting the floor a second later -
would have had to hear the boy words with the el roaring past his nose
lt not possible he heard it of course he heard it
do you think so he said he yelled at the top of his voice
he couldnt have identified the voice with the el roaring by
lt was a matter of seconds nobody can be that accurate
testimony that could put a boy into the electric chair should be that accurate
l dont think he could have heard it maybe he didnt with all that el noise
what are you people talkin about lt stands to reason he couldnt have
why lie what he got to gain attention maybe
you keep comin in with bright sayings send em to a paper they pay $3 apiece
what are you talkin to him like that for
a guy who talks like that to an old man really oughta get stepped on
you oughta have more respect mister
you say stuff like that to him again lm gonna lay you out
you go ahead you say anything you like
why do you think the old man might lie
lt was just that l looked at him for a very long time
the seam of his jacket was split under the shoulder
did you notice that l mean to come into court like that
he was a very old man in a torn jacket
and he walked very slowly to the stand
he was dragging his left leg and trying to hide it
because he was ashamed
l think l know this man better than anyone here
this is a quiet frightened
insignificant old man who
who has been nothing all his life
who has never had recognition or his name in the newspapers
nobody knows him nobody quotes him
nobody seeks his advice after 75 years
gentlemen that a very sad thing to mean nothing
a man like this needs to be quoted to be listened to
to be quoted just once very important to him
lt would be so hard for him to recede into the background
wait a minute are you tellin us hed lie just so he could be important once
no he wouldnt really lie
but perhaps he made himself believe he heard those words
and recognised the boy face
that the most fantastic story ever
how can you make up a thing like that what do you know about it
does anybody want a cough drop lll take one
l still dont see how anybody can think he not guilty
there something else ld like to talk about for a minute thanks
weve proved the old man couldnt have heard the boy say lm gonna kill you
you didnt prove it at all wait supposing he really did hear it
this phrase how many times have all of us used it probably thousands
l could kill you for that junior do that again and lll kill you rocky kill him
lt doesnt mean wed really kill anybody the phrase was lm gonna kill you
the kid yelled it at the top of his lungs
dont tell me he didnt mean it anybody says it like that they mean it
gee l dont know
l was arguing with the guy l work next to at the bank a few weeks ago
he called me an idiot so l yelled at him
this guy is trying to make you believe what isnt so
the kid said hed kill him and he did
do you really think the boyd shout it out so the whole neighbourhood could hear
he much too bright for that bright he a common ignorant slob
he dont even speak good english
he doesnt even speak good english
mr foreman ld like to change my vote to not guilty
you what you heard me
are you sure yeah lm sure
the vote is nine to three in favour of guilty
well if this isnt the livin end
what are you basin it on stories this guy made up
you oughta write for one of those kooky detective magazines make a fortune
for cryin out loud the kid own lawyer knew he didnt stand a chance
right from the beginning his own lawyer knew and you could see it
boy oh boy lm telling ya this guy here is really somethin
the kid had a lawyer didnt he he presented his case not you
how come you say so much lawyers arent infallible
baltimore please he was court-appointed
what that supposed to mean a lot
he didnt want the case or he resented being appointed
lt the kind of case that brings no money no glory not much chance of winning
that not a very promising situation for a young lawyer
hed really have to believe in his client to put up a good case obviously he didnt
of course he didnt
who the heck could
except maybe some guy mother or somebody
oh look will you look at the time come on
pardon me l have made some notes here
and l would like please to say something
l have been listening very carefully and
it seems to me that this man has some very good points to make
from what was presented at the trial the boy looks guilty on the surface
but maybe if we go deeper come on will ya
there is a question l would like to ask
let us assume that the boy really did commit the murder
now this happened at 0 minutes after 2
now how was he caught by the police
he came back home at three oclock or so
and he was captured by two detectives in the hallway of his house
now my question is if he really had killed his father
why would he come back home three hours later
wouldnt he be afraid of being caught
he came home for his knife lt not nice to leave knives in people chests
yeah especially relatives
l dont see anything funny about it
the boy knew the knife could be identified
he had to get it before the police did lf he knew the knife could be identified
why did he leave it there in the first place
l think we can assume the boy ran out in a state of panic having just killed his father
he calmed down and realised hed left his knife there
this then depends on your definition of panic
he would have had to be calm enough to wipe off any fingerprints left on the knife
now where did this panic start and where did it end
you voted guilty what side are you on
l dont believe l have to be loyal to one side or the other
lm simply asking questions this is just off the top of my head but
lf ld done the stabbing ld take a chance and go back for the knife
lll bet he figured nobodyd seen him running out
and the body wouldnt be discovered till the next day
after all it was the middle of the night he figured itd be found the next day
pardon this is my whole point
the woman across the street testified that the moment after she saw the killing
that is a moment after the train went by
she screamed and then went to telephone the police
now the boy certainly must have heard the scream
so he knew that somebody saw something
l just dont think that he would have gone back
two things one he may not have heard the scream perhaps it wasnt very loud
two if he did he may not have connected it with his own acts
he lived in a neighbourhood where screams were commonplace
there your answer maybe maybe the boy did kill his father
didnt hear the scream did run out in a panic
calmed down later and came back for the knife risking being caught by the police
maybe those things happened but maybe they didnt
there enough doubt to wonder if he was there at all at the time of the killing
what do you mean didnt the old man see him running out of the house
he twisting the facts
did or didnt the old man see the kid running out of the house at 20
well did or didnt he he says he did
says he did boy how do you like that
witnesses can make mistakes sure when you want them to
or when he wants them to keep the yelling down
maybe we need a little yelling these guys keep going off every which way
did hear the scream didnt hear it what difference does it make
youre talking about little details and forgetting the important stuff
l call for another vote lm talking here
another vote called for
now let take our seats
l never saw so much time spent on nothin
lt only takes a second
ok l guess the fastest way is to find out who voting not guilty
all those voting not guilty please raise your hands
still the same one two three not guilty nine guilty
so now where are we we can yakety-yak till next tuesday where it getting us
pardon l vote not guilty
what are you talkin about l mean were all goin crazy in here or somethin
the kid is guilty why dont you listen to the facts
tell them will ya this is gettin to be a joke
the vote is eight to four in favour of guilty
what is this love your underprivileged brother week
l want you to tell me why you changed your vote give me reasons
l dont have to defend my decision to you there is a reasonable doubt in my mind
reasonable doubt nothing but words look at this
the kid you just decided isnt guilty was seen ramming this into his father
what about this mr reasonable doubt that not the knife remember
oh brilliant lm tellin you this is the craziest
l mean what are we supposed to believe youre pullin stories out of thin air
a guy like this if he sittin ringside at the dempsey-firpo fight
hed be trying to tell you that
look now what about the old man
are we supposed to believe he didnt see the kid tearin down the steps
5 seconds after the killing
he just sayin so to be important right
what the point of it all hold it
the baltimore rooter is heard from again
and pop-ups are fallin for base hits hold on a second look
did the old man say he ran to the door what the difference
he got there didnt he he said he ran at least l think he did
l dont remember but l dont see how he could have run
he said he wentfrom his bedroom to the front door lsnt that enough
where was the bedroom down the hall
dont you remember that no
l want to see a diagram of the apartment why dont we have him on trial again
youre the only one wants to see exhibits
l want to see this one too ld like to stop wastin time
lf were gonna wade through that nonsense about the body
no but ld like to know if an old man who drags one foot cos he had a stroke
can get from his bedroom to his front door in 5 seconds
he said 20 he said 5
20 what are you tryin to distort he said 5
how does he know how long 5 seconds is you cant judge that
he said 5 he was positive about it
he was an old man he was confused
how could he be positive about anything
l dont see what youre going to prove the man said he saw the boy running out
let see if the details bear him out as the body hit the floor
he said he heard footsteps upstairs running to the front door
heard the upstairs door open the footsteps start down
he said he got to his own door in at most 5 seconds lf the killer ran immediately
maybe he didnt the old man said he did
you oughta be at that hair-splitters convention
why dont you stop making smart remarks
my friend for your three dollars a day you have to listen to everything
here the apartment the old man was directly beneath and exactly the same
here are the el tracks the bedroom living room kitchen bathroom hall stairs
the old man was in this bedroom here
he says he crossed to the door walked down the hall opened the door
just in time to see the boy running down the stairs am l right
that the story for the 9th time
5 seconds after the body hit the floor correct
now let see lt was
lt 2 feet from the bed to the door the hall is 43 feet
he would have had to walk 2 feet open the bedroom door
walk 43 feet down and open the front door all in 5 seconds
could he have done it sure
he walks slowly he needed help into the witness chair
you make it sound like a long walk for an old man who had a stroke it is
what are you doin lm gonna try it
what do you mean why didnt his lawyer bring it up
maybe he just didnt think of it do you think he an idiot lt obvious
did you think of it lt dont matter he didnt bring it up
because he knew itd hurt his case
or because it would have meant bullying and badgering a helpless old man
that doesnt sit well with a jury most lawyers avoid it
what kind of a bum is he that what lm asking
pass me that chair those two chairs are the old man bed
l just paced off 2 feet this is the bedroom door
that crazy you cant re-create a thing like that
the hall was 43 feet lll pace from that wall and back again
this is insane what are you wasting everybody time for
according to you itll only take 5 seconds we can spare that
come on knock it off
ok ok ok killer
yeah
will you stand there and mark the front door lt was chain-locked remember
who got a watch with a second hand l have
stamp your foot thatll be the body falling you can time me from there
what are we gonna do play charades what are we waiting for
l wanna wait till the second hand reaches 60
aw come on
come on speed it up he can walk twice as fast as that
lf you want me to walk faster than that l will
lock door stop right
what the time
exactly 4 seconds
this is what l think happened the old man heard the fight a few hours earlier
when he in bed he heard the body hit the floor
heard the woman scream got to his front door as fast as he could
heard somebody running and assumed it was the boy
l think that possible assumed
brother lve seen all kinds of dishonesty in my day
but this little display takes the cake
you all come in here with your hearts bleedin about slum kids and injustice
you listen to some fairy tales you start getting through to these old ladies
youre not getting through to me lve had enough
what the matter with you guys you all know he guilty he got to burn
hell slip through our fingers slip through our fingers
are you his executioner lm one of em
perhaps youd like to pull the switch for this kid you bet l would
l feel sorry for you what it must feel like to wanna pull the switch
ever since you walked in youve acted like a self-appointed public avenger
you want to see this boy die because you want it not because of the facts
youre a sadist you
let me go lll kill him lll kill him
you dont really mean youll kill me do you
anything wrong l heard some noise no everything all right
were just friendly little argument
were through with that diagram you can take it if you want here you are
what are you lookin at
somebody has to start off again l beg pardon
l beg pardon what are you so polite about
for the same reason youre not lt the way l was brought up
this fighting that not why we are here to fight
we have a responsibility
this l have always thought is a remarkable thing about democracy
that we are
what is the word
notified that we are notified by mail to come down to this place
to decide on the guilt or innocence of a man we we have never heard of before
we have nothing to gain or lose by by our verdict
this is one of the reasons why we are strong
we should not make it a personal thing
lf nobody else has an idea l might have a cutie here
let throw it out and see if the cat licks it up
the cat licks it up yeah the boy
look how dark it gettin out there l bet were gonna have a storm now
boy oh boy lt really hot huh
pardon me but dont you ever sweat no l dont
listen l l was wonderin if
maybe maybe we should take another vote
great maybe we can follow this one up with a little dancing and refreshments
mr foreman well that ok with me
anyone doesnt wanna vote hey come on
sorry l think we ought to have an open ballot
call out our votes you know let see who stands where

six to six lm telling you some of you people in here must be out of your minds
a kid like that
l dont think the kind of boy he is has anything to do with it
facts determine the case dont give me that
lm sick and tired of facts you can twist em any way you like
that exactly the point this gentleman has been making
you keep shouting at the top of your lungs
ld like to be a few years younger that man gets on my
my it hot in here want a drink of water
no no thanks thanks
lt gonna rain well howd you figure that out killer
how come you changed your vote lt just seemed there was room for doubt
you havent got a leg to stand on l dont feel that way
a lot of details never came out yeah well good luck
come on youre like everybody else you think too much you get mixed up
you know what l mean l dont think you have any right to
loudmouth
look at that come down will ya
you know this reminds me of a storm we had last
was it november l dont know something
lt was quite a storm we had lt was right in the middle of a game
we were behind seven to six wed just started to move the ball made a tackle
lt was gonna cut right in slash through slashed right in cut right through
and
we had this kid slattery
he was an ox a real ox
l wish l had another one just like him
l forgot to tell you lm the assistant head coach at andrew j mccorkle high school
that out in queens
and anyway were starting to move along real nice
you know their whole line is just just comin apart
and it starts to come down cats and dogs just like this
just whoosh you know right down
well it was murder you know
l swear l l nearly bawled just we couldnt go nowhere
hey what is it with this fan here how come
must have been on the same switch with the lights
well things are lookin up here huh
yeah
boy that better
hey two points
you guys ever go to the garden
that a damn stupid thing to do
oh lm sorry l
you know
pardon me
well how do you like it even-steven pretty surprising isnt it
yes
that business before when that tall guy whatshisname was tryin to bait me
that doesnt prove anything lm a pretty excitable person
where does he come off calling me a public avenger a sadist
anyone in his right mind would blow his stack
he was just tryin to bait me
he did an excellent job
l think were going nowhere here
lm ready to walk into court and declare a hung jury
there no point in this thing going on l go for that too
let the kid take his chance with 2 other guys
the judge wont accept a hung jury we havent been here long
well let find out l am not in favour of that
this kid wouldnt stand a chance with another jury and you know it
come on were hung nobody gonna change his vote
still no room for reasonable doubt no
pardon maybe you dont fully understand the term reasonable doubt
what do you mean l dont understand
how do you like this guy lm tellin you theyre all alike
they come over here and before they can take a breath
theyre telling us how to run the show
boy the arrogance of this guy all right
let stop the arguing for about two minutes in here
now who got something constructive to say
ld like to go over something if you gentlemen dont mind
an important point for the prosecution was
the fact that after the boy claimed he was at the movies when the killing took place
he couldnt remember the names of the movies or who starred in them
this gentleman has made that point that correct
lt the only alibi the boy offered and he couldnt back it up with any details
ln the boy place do you think you could remember details
after an upsetting experience such as being slapped by your father
l think so if there were any special details to remember
the boy couldnt remember the movies because he wasnt there
according to the police testimony the boy was questioned in the kitchen
while the body of his father was lying in the bedroom
do you think you could remember details
l do under great emotional stress
under great emotional stress he remembered them correctly in court
yes his lawyer took great pains to bring that out
he had three months to the day of the trial in which to memorise them
lt not difficult for a lawyer to find out what played on a particular night
lll take the testimony from right after the murder
when he couldnt remember a thing about the movies great emotional stress or not
ld like to ask you a personal question go ahead
where were you last night l was home all night
how about the night before that what is this
lt all right l left the office at 830 and went straight home and to bed
and the night before that that was tuesday night
the bridge tournament l played bridge monday night
when you get to new year eve 954 let me know
monday night monday night my wife and l went to the movies
what did you see the scarlet circle a whodunit
what was the second feature the
lll tell you in a minute the
remarkable mrs
something
mrs bainbridge the remarkable mrs bainbridge
l saw that lt called the amazing mrs bainbridge
yes the amazing mrs bainbridge
who was in the amazing mrs bainbridge
barbara long l think it was
a dark very pretty girl
ling or long something like that who else
ld never heard of them before
lt was a very inexpensive second feature with unknown
and you werent under an emotional stress were you
no
l wasnt
l think the point is made big point
you can talk till your tongue is draggin on the floor the boy is guilty
know what l mean my friend
you got those cough drops theyre all gone my friend
oh boy look at that rain there goes your ball game
lt only a shower
besides they got the infield covered
say could l see that knife a second please
well were still tied up six to six who got a suggestion
lt 5 after 6 let get some dinner why dont we wait till 7 oclock
ok with me
there something ld like to say lt been bothering me a little
and as long as were stuck
there was this whole business about the stab wound and how it was made
the downward angle of it you know dont start with that again
theyve been over it and over it l know but l dont go along with it
the boy was five feet seven inches tall his father was six two
that a difference of seven inches
lt very awkward to stab down into the chest of someone over half a foot taller
give me that
lll give you a demonstration somebody get up
watch this l dont wanna have to do it again
lll make myself about six or seven inches shorter
that about right maybe a little more ok a little more
now nobody hurt
right right nobody hurt
now this is the way ld stab a man who was taller than l was
look at the angle down and in
and this is the way it was done now tell me lm wrong
down and in there no argument hold on a minute
will you give me that
boy l hate these things
did you ever see a knife fight no
anybody here ever see a knife fight
well l have you know on my back stoop the lot across the street back yard
switchblades came with the neighbourhood
funny l never thought of it before l guess you try to forget
how do you use a switchblade well youd never use it like this
see youd lose too much time switching hands
here how underhand
anyone who ever used one wouldnt handle it any other way
are you sure lm sure
lt why theyre made to open like that the boy was pretty handy with a knife
you think he could have made the wound that killed his father
no not with the experience he got all his life handling these things
l feel hed have gone for him underhand how do you know
were you there when he was killed no neither was anybody else
what are you giving us this mumbo jumbo for l dont believe it
l dont think you can tell what wound he might have made
simply because he knew how to handle a knife
what do you think l dont know
what do you mean you dont know l dont know
how about you l dont know about the rest of em
but lm gettin tired of this yakety-yakkin lt gettin us nowhere
so l guess lll have to break it up lm changin my vote to not guilty
youre what you heard me lve had enough
youve had enough that no answer listen you just take care of yourself
you know he right
that not an answer
what kind of a man are you
you have sat here and voted guilty with everyone else
because there are some baseball tickets burning a hole in your pocket
now you have changed your vote because you say youre sick of all the talking
now listen buddy who tells you that you have the right
to play like this with a man life dont you care
now wait a minute you cant talk like that to me
l can talk like that to you lf you want to vote not guilty
do it because you are convinced he is not guilty not because youve had enough
and if you think he is guilty then vote that way
or dont you have the guts to do what you think is right
now listen guilty or not guilty
l told you not guilty why
look l dont have to you do have to say it why
l l dont think he guilty
l want another vote ok that another vote called for
l guess the quickest way is a show of hands anyone object
ok all those voting not guilty raise your hands
one two three
four five six seven
eight
nine
all those voting guilty raise your hands
one two three
well the vote nine to three in favour of acquittal
l dont understand you people
all these picky little points you keep bringing up they dont mean nothing
you saw this kid just like l did
dont tell me you believe that phoney story about losing the knife
and about being at the movies
look you know how these people lie lt born in them
what the heck l dont have to tell you they dont know what the truth is
and they dont need any real big reason to kill someone either
no sir they get drunk theyre real big drinkers all of em
you know that and bang someone lying in the gutter
nobody blaming em that the way they are by nature
you know what l mean violent where are you going
human life dont mean as much to them as it does to us
theyre lushing it up and fighting all the time
and if somebody gets killed somebody gets killed they dont care
sure there some good things about em too lm the first one to say that
lve known a couple who were ok but that the exception
most of em it like they have no feelings they can do anything
what going on here
lm trying to tell you youre making a big mistake you people
this kid is a liar l know it l know all about them
listen to me theyre no good
there not a one of em who any good
l mean what happening in here
l speak my piece and you
listen to me
l were were
this kid on trial here his type well dont you know about them
there a there a danger here
these people are dangerous
theyre wild
listen to me listen to me
l have now sit down and dont open your mouth again
some of the time l tell you
lt always difficult to keep personal prejudice out of a thing like this
wherever you run into it prejudice always obscures the truth
l dont really know what the truth is
l dont suppose anybody will ever really know
nine of us now seem to feel that the defendant is innocent
but were just gambling on probabilities we may be wrong
we may be trying to let a guilty man go free l dont know nobody really can
but we have a reasonable doubt
and that something that very valuable in our system
no jury can declare a man guilty unless it sure
we nine cant understand how you three are still so sure
maybe you can tell us lll try
youve made some excellent points but l still believe the boy is guilty
l have two reasons one the evidence given by the woman across the street
who actually saw the murder committed
that the most important testimony
and two the fact that she described the stabbing
by saying she saw the boy raise his arm over his head
and stab down into the father chest
she saw him do it the wrong way that absolutely right
let talk about this woman for a moment
she said she went to bed about eleven oclock that night
her bed was next to the window and she could look out
and see directly into the boy room across the street
she tossed and turned for over an hour
finally she turned toward the window at about 0 minutes after 2
and as she looked out she saw the killing through the windows of a passing el train
she said the lights went out after the killing
but that she got a good look at the boy in the act of stabbing his father
as far as l can see it this is unshakeable testimony
well that the whole case what do you think
how about you
l dont know so much evidence to sift this is a pretty complicated business
frankly l dont see how you can vote for acquittal
lt not so easy to arrange the evidence throw out all the other evidence
the woman saw him do it what else do you want
well maybe let vote on it
ok there another vote called for anyone object
all right lm changing my vote
he guilty anybody else the vote is eight to four
why is this such a personal triumph for you this one vote
ok l say were a hung jury l say we take it in to the judge
how about it l wanna hear arguments
you youre the leader of the cause what about it
let go over it again weve been over it again
the boy in the grey flannel suit is bouncin back and forth like a tennis ball
there no point in getting nasty you keep trying to turn this into a contest
ok
maybe we can talk about setting some kind of time limit
yeah once around for the deal huh
lt a quarter after six someone before mentioned seven oclock
that a point at which we might begin to discuss whether were a hung jury or not
dont you feel well l feel perfectly well thank you
l was saying seven oclock would be a reasonable time
the reason l asked that was because you were rubbing your nose like
oh lm sorry for interrupting
but you made a gesture that reminded me of something
lm trying to settle something here well l think this is important
thank you now then lm sure youll pardon me for this
but l was wondering why you rub your nose like that
come on will you
at this point l happen to be talking to the gentleman sitting next to you
now why were you rubbing your nose like that
lf it any of your business l was rubbing it because it bothers me a little
oh lm sorry ls it ls it because of your eyeglasses
lt is now could we get on to something else
your eyeglasses made those two deep impressions on the sides of your nose
l hadnt noticed that before that must be annoying
lt is very annoying
l wouldnt know about that lve never worn eyeglasses 20l20
listen will you come on already with the optometrist bit
the woman who testified that she saw the killing
had those same marks on the sides of her nose
holy smoke he right
please just give me a minute and lll be finished
l dont know if anyone else noticed that about her
l didnt think of it then but lve been going over her face in my mind
she had those same marks she kept rubbing them in court
he right she did do that a lot
this woman was about 45 years old
she was making a tremendous effort to look 375
for her first public appearance heavy make-up dyed hair
brand-new clothes that should have been worn by a younger woman
no glasses well women do that see if you can get a mental picture of her
what do you mean no glasses how do you know whether she wore glasses
just cos she was rubbin her nose she had those marks l saw em
so what do you think that means lm sick of your yellin
come on forget it
hey listen listen he right l saw them too l was the closest one to her
she had these things on the side of her nose
what point are you makin
she had dyed hair marks on her nose what does that mean
could those marks be made by anything other than eyeglasses
no they couldnt
l didnt see any marks
l did strange but l didnt think about it before
why didnt the lawyer say something
there are twelve people in here concentrating on this case
eleven of us didnt think of it either what about the district attorney
you think hed pull that have her testify without her glasses
ever see a woman who didnt want to wear them because they spoil her looks
ok she had marks on her nose lm givin you that
from glasses right she didnt wanna wear em out of the house
so peopled think she gorgeous
but when she saw this kid killin his father she was in the house alone
that all
do you wear glasses when you go to bed
no l dont
no one wears eyeglasses to bed
lt logical to assume that she wasnt wearing them in bed
how do you know l dont know lm guessing
lm also guessing that she didnt put them on when she looked out of the window
she testified the killing took place just as she looked out
the lights went off she didnt have time to put them on
here another guess she honestly thought she saw the boy kill his father
l say she only saw a blur how do you know what she saw
how does he know all that how do you know what glasses she wore
maybe they were sunglasses maybe she was far-sighted what do you know
l only know the woman eyesight is in question now
she had to be able to identify a person 60 feet away at night without glasses
you cant send someone off to die on evidence like that
aw dont give me that
might she not have made a mistake no
lt not possible no it not possible
ls it possible
not guilty
do you think he guilty
l think he guilty
do you
no
lm convinced not guilty
what the matter with you l have a reasonable doubt now
lt eleven to one what about all the other evidence
what about all that stuff the the knife the whole business
well you said we could throw out all the other evidence
well what do we do now
youre alone
l dont care whether lm alone or not lt my right
lt your right
well what do you want l say he guilty
we want to hear your arguments l gave you my arguments
were not convinced we want to hear them again
we have as much time as it takes
everything every single thing that took place in that courtroom says he guilty
what do you think lm an idiot or somethin
take that stuff about the old man who lived there and heard everything
or this business about the knife they found another one exactly like it
the old man saw him right there on the stairs
what the difference how many seconds it was
every single thing the knife fallin through a hole in his pocket
you cant prove he didnt get to the door
sure you can take all the time hobble around the room but you cant prove it
and what about this business of the el and the movies
there a phoney deal if l ever heard one
lll bet you $5000 ld remember the movies l saw
lm tellin you everything that gone on has been twisted and turned
this business with the glasses how do you know she didnt have em on
this woman testified in open court
and what about hearin the kid yell huh
lm tellin ya lve got all the facts here
here
well that it that the whole case
