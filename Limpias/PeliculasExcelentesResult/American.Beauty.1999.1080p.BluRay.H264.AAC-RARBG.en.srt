and in a way im dead already

jerking off in the shower

shears matches her gardening clogs
that not an accident
hush bitsy

that our next door neighbor jim
and that his lover jim

to flourish like this

i get exhausted just watching her
she wasnt always like this
she used to be happy
we used to be happy
my daughter jane only child
janie a pretty typical teenager
angry insecure confused
i wish i could tell her
that all going to pass
but i dont want to lie to her
jane honey
are you trying to look unattractive
yes
congratulations
youve succeeded admirably
lester could you make me a little
later im not quite late enough
nice going dad
both my wife and daughter
think im this gigantic loser
and theyre right
i have lost something
im not exactly sure what it is
but i know i didnt always
feel this sedated
but you know what
it never too late to get it back
hello this is lester burnham
from media monthly magazine
im calling for mr tamblin please
well were all under a deadline here
there some information
about your product launch
that isnt even covered
in your press release and
yeah ok can i ask you a question
who is tamblin does he exist
cause he doesnt
ever seem to come in
yeah ok ill leave my number
it 555-099
lester burnham thank you
hey les
you got a minute
for you brad i got five
so im sure you can understand
our need to cut corners around here
sure times are tight
you got to free up some cash
you got to spend money
to make money right
exactly
like the time when mr flournoy
used the company mastercard
to pay for that hooker
then she used the card and stayed
at the st regis for three months
that unsubstantiated gossip
that $50000
that someone salary
who gonna get fired
because craig has to
pay women to fuck him
jesus calm down
nobody getting fired yet
that why were having everyone
write out a job description
mapping out in detail
how they contribute
that way management can
assess who valuable
and who expendable
it just business
ive been writing for this magazine
for 4 years youve been here a month
im one of the good guys les
im trying to level with you
this is your one chance
to save your job
there no decision
just write the damn thing
you dont think it weird
and kind of fascist
possibly but you dont want
to be unemployed
let sell our souls and work for satan
because it more convenient
could you be a little bit
more dramatic please
so we finally got new neighbors
if the lomans had let me represent them
instead of the real estate king
that house would never have sat
on the market for six months
they were still mad at you
for cutting down their sycamore
their sycamore come on
a substantial portion of the root
structure was on our property
how can you call it their sycamore
i wouldnt have the heart to cut down
something if it wasnt partially mine
mom do we always have to listen
to this elevator music
no no we dont
as soon as youve prepared a nutritious
yet savory meal that im about to eat
you can listen to whatever you like
so janie how was school
it was ok
just ok
no dad it was spectacular
well you want to know how things
went at my job today
theyve hired this efficiency expert
this really friendly guy named brad
how perfect is that
he there to make it seem like
theyre justified in firing somebody
because they couldnt just
come right out and say that
that would just be too honest
so theyve asked us you couldnt
possibly care less could you
well what do you expect
you cant all of a sudden be my best
friend just because you had a bad day
i mean hello youve barely
even spoken to me for months
what youre mother of the year
you treat her like an employee
what

janie what happened
we used to be pals
i will sell this house today
welcome im carolyn burnham
this living room is very dramatic
wait till you see
the native stone fireplace
a simple cream
could really lighten things up
you could even put in a skylight
well why dont we go into the kitchen
it a dream come true for any cook
just filled with positive energy
youll be surprised how much a ceiling
fan can cut down on your energy costs
you know you could have some really
fun backyard get-togethers out here
the ad said this pool
was lagoon-like
nothing lagoon-like about it
except for maybe the bugs
there arent even any plants out here
what do you call this
is this not this a plant
if you have a problem with the plants
i can call my landscape architect
solved
i think lagoon i think waterfall
i think tropical

they just have their own lives
what makes you so sure she wants us
to be there did she ask

it started when i was about 2
id go to dinner with my parents
every thursday night red lobster
and every guy there
would stare at me when i walked in
and i knew what they were thinking
just like i knew guys at school
thought about me when theyjerked off
vomit
no i liked it
and i still like it
if people i dont even know
look at me and want to fuck me
it means i really have a shot
at being a model which is great
because there nothing worse in life
than being ordinary

because everything
that was meant to happen does
eventually

so what up
i need a urine sample

i just took a whiz
yeah i suppose
you know
well good night son
ive been waiting for you
youve been working out havent you
i could tell
i was hoping youd give me a bath
im very very dirty
what are you doing
nothing
you were masturbating
i was not
yes you were
all right so shoot me
i was whacking off
that right i was choking the bishop
chafing the carrot
you know saying hi to my monster
that disgusting
excuse me
but some of us still have blood
pumping through our veins
so do i
really
im the only one who seems
to be doing anything about it
lester i refuse to live like this
this is not a marriage
this hasnt been a marriage for years
but you were happy
as long as i kept my mouth shut
guess what ive changed and the
new me whacks off when he feels horny
cause youre obviously not gonna
help me out in that department
i see you think youre the only one
who sexually frustrated
im not well
then come on baby im ready
dont you mess with me mister
i will divorce you so fast
itll make your head spin
on what grounds
im not a drunk
i dont fuck other women
i dont mistreat you
ive never hit you
i dont even try to touch you
since you made it abundantly clear
just how unnecessary
you consider me to be
but i did support you
when you got your license
and some people might think that
entitles me to half of what yours
so turn out the light
when you come back to bed ok
it a great thing when you realize
you still have the ability
to surprise yourself
makes you wonder what else you can do
that youve forgotten about
hey guys
lester i didnt know you ran
i just started
good for you
i figured you might be able to give me
some pointers i need to shape up fast
are you looking to just lose weight
or do you want to have increased
strength and flexibility as well
i want to look good naked
what is this
fucking gay pride parade
hey ricky
my life is passing before my eyes and
those two have barely broken a sweat
sorry hi lester burnham
i live next door we havent met
colonel frank fitts us marine corps
oh well
welcome to the neighborhood sir
ricky
i was thinking about
the movie we talked about
re-animator
yeah
you want to borrow it
it up in my room
ok
come on
can you hold this for a sec
sure
i dont think my dad would come in
while someone else is here
but you never know
what is this
urine
i have to take a drug test every
six months just to make sure im clean
are you kidding
you just smoked with me last night
it not mine
one of my clients is a nurse
in a pediatrician office
i cut her a deal
she keeps me in clean piss
you like pink floyd
i like a lot of music
man i havent listened
to this album in years
how much do you want
i dont know it been a while
how much is an ounce
this is totally decent
and it 300
this shit is top-of-the-line
it called g-3 it genetically
engineered by the us government
it extremely potent but
a completely mellow high no paranoia
is that what we smoked last night
this is all i ever smoke
how much
two grand
jesus
things have changed since 973
you dont have to pay now
i know youre good for it
thanks
there a card in there
with my beeper number
beep me any time day or night
and i only accept cash
now i know how you can afford
all this equipment
when i was your age i flipped burgers
all summer just to buy an 8-track
that sucks
no actually it was great
all i did was party and get laid
i had my whole life ahead of me
my dad thinks i pay for all this
with catering jobs
never underestimate the power of denial
what the hell do you think youre doing
mom mad bench presses
im going to whale on my pecs
and then im going to do my back
i see youre smoking pot now
im so glad
i think using illegal
psychotropic substances
is a very positive example
to set for our daughter
youre one to talk you bloodless
money-grubbing freak
lester you have such hostility in you
do you mind
im trying to work out here
unless you want to spot me
lester you will not get away with this
you can be sure of that
that what
you think
my job consists
of basically masking my contempt
for the assholes in charge
and at least once a day
retiring to the men room
so i can jerk off
while i fantasize about a life
that doesnt so closely resemble hell
well you obviously have
no interest in saving yourself
brad for 4 years ive been a whore
for the advertising industry
the only way i could save myself now
is if i start firebombing
whatever management wants you gone
by the end of the day
what sort of severance package
is management prepared to offer me
considering the information i have
about our editorial director
buying pussy with company money
which i think would interest the irs
since it technically constitutes fraud
im sure that some of our advertisers
and rival publications
might like to know about it as well
not to mention craig wife
what do you want
one year salary with benefits
that not going to happen
what do you say i throw in a little
sexual harassment charge to boot
against who
against you
can you prove that you
didnt offer to save my job
if i let you blow me
man you are one twisted fuck
nope
im just an ordinary guy
with nothing to lose
yeah
carolyn
buddy
i am so sorry to have kept you waiting
christy left for new york this morning
let just say things were
a little hectic around the house
what she doing in new york
she moving there
yes we are splitting up
buddy im so sorry
yes
according to her
im too focused on my career
as if being driven to succeed
is some sort of a character flaw
she certainly did take advantage of
the lifestyle my success afforded her
it for the best
when i saw you two at the party the
other night you seemed perfectly happy
call me crazy
but it is my philosophy
that in order to be successful
one must project an image
of success at all times
what are you doing
i was filming this dead bird
why
because it beautiful
i think maybe you forgot
your medication today mental-boy
hi jane
look i want you to stop filming me
ok
well whatever this is boring
let go
do you need a ride
are you crazy
i dont want to end up hacked to pieces
in a dumpster somewhere
it ok ill walk but thanks
see he doesnt want to go anyway
come on let go
come on jane
i think im gonna walk too
what jane that
like almost a mile
god i love it

thank you
smile youre at mr smiley
thatll be $498 please
would you like some smiley sauce
no no
actually id like
to fill out an application
there no jobs for manager
it just for counter
good
im looking for the least possible
amount of responsibility
i dont think youd fit in here
i have fast-food experience
yeah like 20 years ago
im sure there have been amazing
technological advances in the industry
but surely you must have
some sort of training program
it seems unfair to presume
i wont be able to learn
that was exactly what i needed
the royal treatment so to speak
i was so stressed out
know what i do when i feel like that
what
i fire a gun
really
yeah i go to this little
firing range downtown
and i just pop off a few rounds
ive never fired a gun before
well youve got to try it
nothing makes you feel more powerful
well almost nothing
so do you like your new house
i like it
the people who used to live there fed
stray cats so they were always around
and it drove my mother nuts
and then she cut down their tree
is that a funeral
yeah
have you ever known
anybody who died
no have you
no
but i did see this homeless woman
who froze to death once
just lying there on the sidewalk
she looked really sad
i got that homeless woman
on videotape
why would you film that
because it was amazing
what amazing about it
when you see something like that
it like god is looking right at you
just for a second
and if youre careful
you can look right back
and what do you see
beauty
mom i want you to meet somebody
mom
yes
i want you to meet somebody
this is jane
hi
oh my
i apologize for the way
things look around here
this is where my dad hides out
i take it he got a thing for guns
you got to see this one thing
my dad would kill me
if he knew i was in here
did you steal his keys
no one of my clients is a locksmith
he was short on cash one night
so i let him pay me in trade
turn it over
oh my god
it like official state china
of the third reich
there a whole subculture of people
who collect this nazi shit
but my dad just has this one thing
what wrong
nothing
no youre scared of me
no im not
you want to see the most beautiful thing
ive ever filmed
it was one of those days
where it a minute away from snowing
and there this electricity
in the air
you can almost hear it
right
and this bag was just
dancing with me
like a little kid
begging me to play with it
for 5 minutes
that the day i realized
that there was this
entire life behind things
and this incredibly benevolent force
that wanted me to know that
there was no reason to be afraid
ever
video a poor excuse i know
but it helps me remember
i need to remember
sometimes there is so much
beauty in the world
i feel like i cant take it
and my heart
is just going to cave in
oh my god what time is it
sorry im late
that quite all right dear
your father and i were just
discussing his day at work
why dont you tell our daughter
about it honey
janie today i quit my job
then i told my boss to go fuck himself
and blackmailed him for almost $60000
pass the asparagus
your father seems to think this kind
of behavior is something to be proud of
your mother seems to prefer
i go through life like a prisoner
while she keeps my dick
in a jar under the sink
how dare you speak to me
that way in front of her
i marvel that you can be
so contemptuous of me
on the same day
that you lose your job

of being the sole breadwinner now

can quit his job

disinvesting problems of power
and removing their ability
to make us afraid
this is the secret
to me-centered living
only by taking full responsibility
for your actions and their solutions
will you ever break free from
the constant cycle of victimhood
you are only a victim if you choose
to be a victim we all have the power

i have ever seen

than being ordinary
i refuse to be a victim
i refuse to be a victim
i refuse to be a victim
lester l have something
i have to say to you

lucky man

thanks
how jane
what do you mean
i mean
how her life
is she happy
is she miserable
id really like to know and shed die
before shed ever tell me about it
she she is really happy
she thinks she in love
good for her
how are you
it been a long time
since anybody asked me that
im great
ive got to go to the bathroom
im great
man oh man
man oh man oh man
oh my god
i had always heard your entire life
flashes in front of your eyes
the second before you die
first of all
that one second
isnt a second at all
it stretches on forever
like an ocean of time
for me it was lying on my back
at boy scout camp
watching falling stars
and yellow leaves from the
maple trees that lined our street
or my grandmother hands and the way
her skin seemed like paper
and the first time
i saw my cousin tony
brand-new firebird
and janie
and carolyn
i guess i could be pretty pissed off
about what happened to me
but it hard to stay mad when
there so much beauty in the world
sometimes i feel like im seeing it
all at once and it too much
my heart fills up like a balloon
that about to burst
and then i remember to relax
and stop trying to hold on to it
and then it flows
through me like rain
and i cant feel anything but gratitude
for every single moment
of my stupid little life
you have no idea
what im talking about im sure
but dont worry
you will someday
