for valentine day 2004
today is a holiday invented
by greeting-card companies
to make people feel like crap
i ditched work today
took a train out to montauk
i dont know why
im not an impulsive person
i guess i just woke up
in a funk this morning
i gotta get my car fixed
hi cindy it joel
listen i dont feel
very well today
no food poisoning i think
it goddamn freezing
on this beach
montauk in february
brilliant joel
pages ripped out
dont remember doing that
it appears this is
my first entry in two years
sand is overrated
it just tiny little rocks
if only i could meet
someone new
i guess my chances
of that happening
are somewhat diminished
since im incapable of making eye contact
with a woman i dont know
maybe i should get back together
with naomi she was nice
nice is good
she loved me
why do i fall in love
with every woman i see
who shows me
the least bit of attention
hi
im sorry
i just said hi
hi hello
okay if i sit closer
how far are you going

at barnes and noble

that it

book slave there
for five years now
jesus
i would have thought
i would remember you
it might be the hair
what might
it changes a lot the color
that why you might
not recognize me
it called blue ruin
right
the color
snappy name huh
i like it
this company makes a whole line
of colors with equally snappy names
youve got red menace
yellow fever green revolution
that would be a job
coming up with those names
you think there could
possibly be a job like that
i mean how many hair colors
could there be 5 maybe
someone got that job
agent orange
i came up with that one
i apply my personality
in a paste
i doubt that very much
well you dont know me
so you dont know do you
im sorry
i was just trying to be nice
yeah i got it
my name clementine

look our files are
confidential mr barish
so i cant show you evidence
suffice it to say
that miss kruczynski

we provide that possibility
we provide that possibility
what the hell is that
im the nicest guy
she ever went out with
fuck
rob give it a rest
it okay
it all right
carrie i am making a birdhouse
what can i say you know
clementine just like that
she impulsive
she decided to erase you
almost as a lark
a lark
why did you do that
dont wait
dont wait
im sorry doctor
he just barged right in here
okay i want it done
i told him pre-valentine day
is our busy time
that okay mary
but there are people waiting
mr barish
if youd like to come inside
if youd take care of mrs woo
yes of course
goodbye mrs woo
the first thing we need
you to do mr barish
is to go home and collect
everything you own
that has some association
with clementine
anything
well use these items
to create a map of clementine
in your brain okay
well need photos
clothing gifts books
she may have bought you
cds you may have bought
together journal entries
we want to empty your home
we want to empty your life
of clementine
and after the mapping is done
our technicians will do the erasing
in your home tonight
that way when
you awake in the morning
youll find yourself
in your own bed
as if nothing had happened
a new life awaiting you
wake up buddy
im sorry mrs sobel
you cant have the procedure
done three times in one month
it just not our policy here
how are you today
mr barish
hello im right here
i know it an emergency
well do everything we can
we can fit you in on march
maybe you could talk
to the doctor and
all right so let make
an appointment
what day would you like
to come in this week
mr barish
he really busy this afternoon
maybe tomorrow would be better
around 25
can you do that
february is very busy for us
because of valentine day
this is stan fink one of our most
experienced and skilled technicians
hell be handling
your case tonight
great to meet you mr barish
my name is joel barish
and im here to erase
clementine kruczynski
very good
now tell me about clementine
i was living with this woman
naomi
a couple years ago
and my friends rob and carrie
invited us to this party
at the beach
i dont like parties
naomi couldnt go but i went
and i met clementine
im sorry
well start with your
most recent memories
and work backwards from there
more or less
there an emotional core
to each of our memories
and when you eradicate
that core
it starts its
degradation process
by the time you wake up
in the morning
all the memories weve targeted
will have withered and disappeared
as in a dream upon waking
is there any risk
of brain damage
technically speaking
the procedure is brain damage
but it on a par with
a night of heavy drinking
nothing youll miss
comfortable
what were doing here
mr barish
is actually creating a map
of your brain
okay let get started
if we want to get this procedure
underway tonight
we have some work to do
i want you to react to these
objects mr barish if you will
there a good story
behind that
actually mr barish ill get
a much better emotional read-out
if you refrain from any sort of
verbal description of the items
just please try to focus
on the memories
im sorry
healthy activity up there again
healthy read-outs
very good
here another object
next item
potato head
next item
just focus on the memories
patrick do me a favor
patrick
do me a favor will you
can you check the voltage regulator
what have we got there
voltage looks fine
really
im not wiping
as clean as i like here
technically
the procedure is brain damage
but it on a par with
a night of heavy drinking
check the connections please
there you are
what am i
i dont understand
what im looking at
why am i standing here
oh my god déjà vu
this is so
we should get started
if we want to get the procedure
underway tonight
we have some work to do
im in my head already
arent i
i suppose so
this is about right
this is what it would look like
very good
well dispose of these mementos
when were done here
that way you wont
be confused later
by their unexplainable
presence in your home
there we go patrick
patrick
patrick

because we have
a lot of equipment

of a stale smell

even of their blunders
that nietzsche right

it by pope alexander

alexander pope
oh yeah shit
it just that i told myself
not to say pope alexander
and sound like a dope
and then i go ahead and say it
it no big deal
youre such a sweetheart
the quote goes how happy
is the blameless vestal lot
the world forgetting
by the world forgot
eternal sunshine
of the spotless mind
each prayer accepted
and each wish resigned
i want to be a great
big huge elephant
with a huge trunk like that

looking for my own peace of mind
dont assign me yours
i remember that speech
really well
i had you pegged didnt i
had the whole human race pegged

i still thought you were
going to save my life
even after that
i know
it would be different
if we could just
give it another go-round
remember me
try your best
maybe we can
just tell me what you remember
and well take it from there
i liked you immediately
you didnt come on to me at all
i liked that
i was so tongue-tied
around you at first
but i wanted you to think

to you even then
i thought

orange sweatshirt
that i would come to know so well
and even hate eventually
but at the time i thought
how cool an orange sweatshirt
hi there

over here by yourself
and i thought thank god
someone normal who doesnt know
how to interact at these things
i dont ever know what to say

a piece of your chicken
and then you just took it
without waiting for an answer
it was so intimate
like we were already lovers

i take it youre not
coming back
i wouldnt come back
if i was you
do you swear you didnt know
i swear
so you didnt do the erasing
of course not god no
and you never even suspected
we were together
once maybe
i was coming back from a job
and you were at his car
and i saw you two talking
so i waved to you
and you giggled
how did i look
you looked happy
happy with a secret
and after that
i never saw you two together
again like that
so i just figured
i was imagining things
i really like you mary svevo
you know that
thanks
let me get my toothbrush
where are you clem
im worried
i feel like youre mad at me
and i dont know what i did
what did i do
i love you so much
ill do anything to make you happy
just tell me what you want me
to do and ill do it
im going to stop by this morning
just to make sure youre okay
i had a really nice time
last night
nice
i had the best fucking night of
my entire fucking life last night
that better
this is weird
to all patients
of dr howard mierzwiak
my name is mary svevo
weve met but
you dont remember me
i worked for a company you hired
to have part of your memory erased
ive since decided
that this is a horrible
to correct this im sending
everyone file back to them
my name is
clementine kruczynski
im here to erase joel barish
what is this
i dont know
he boring
is that enough reason
to erase someone
ive been thinking how i was before and
how i am now and he changed me
i feel like
im always pissy now
i dont like myself when im with him
i dont like myself anymore
i cant stand
to even look at him
that pathetic wimpy
apologetic smile
that sort of wounded puppy shit
what are you doing
im not doing anything
the bloom is certainly
off the rose at this point
are you screwing with me
no
you are screwing with me
joel im not
you clearly are
let just take a minute and
patrick get the fuck
away from me
can we talk about it
no get the fuck away
hey clementine
nice to see you
i mean she smart i think
but not educated
i couldnt talk to her
about books
she more of
a magazine-reading girl
her vocabulary leaves
something to be desired
the truth is
i was embarrassed in public
hi
because she would pronounce
library li-berry
look what i found
i think if there a truly seductive
quality about clementine
it that her personality promises
to take you out of the mundane
made me look skinny
an amazing burning meteorite
will carry you to another world
where things are exciting
but what you quickly learn is
that it really an elaborate ruse
im sorry i yelled at you
it okay
i really like you i hate that
i said mean things about you
let me turn this off okay
that only fair
the whole thing with the hair
it all bullshit
i really like your hair
thank you
i do
you want a drink or something
do you have any whiskey
i didnt think her sex
was motivated
i saw it clearly the last night
we were together it wasnt sexy
it was just sad
sorry i thought there was more
the only way clem thinks
she can get people to like her
is to fuck them
or at least dangle the possibility
of getting fucked in front of them
i think she so
desperate and insecure
that shell sooner or later
go around fucking everybody
i dont do that
i wouldnt think that about you
because i dont
i know
it hurts me that you said that
because i dont do that
im so sorry
im sorry about all this
im going to go
im a little confused
i dont really think
i can be here
bye
i really thought
i knew her so well
it was nice meeting you and all
what a loss to spend
that much time with someone
only to find out
that she a stranger
wait
what
i dont know just wait
what do you want joel
i want you to wait for a while
okay
really
im not a concept just a fucked-up girl
looking for my peace of mind
im not perfect
i cant see anything
that i dont like about you
but you will
right now i cant
you will think of things
and ill get bored with you
and feel trapped
because that
what happens with me
okay
okay
okay
