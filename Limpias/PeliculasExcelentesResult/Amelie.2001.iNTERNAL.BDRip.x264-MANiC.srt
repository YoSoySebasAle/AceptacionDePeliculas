on september 3 973
a blue fly capable of flapping
70 beats a minute
landed on st vincent street
in montmartre
at that moment
on a restaurant terrace nearby
the wind magically
made two glasses dance unseen
on a tablecloth
meanwhile in a 5th-floor flat
on avenue trudaine paris 9
returning from
his best friend funeral
eugéne colére erased him
from his address book
at the same moment
a sperm with one x chromosome
belonging to raphael poulain
made a dash for an egg
in his wife amandine
nine months later
amélie poulain was born
amelie from montmartre
her father an ex-army doctor
works at a spa at enghien les bains
tight lips hard heart
raphael poulain dislikes
peeing next to someone else
he also dislikes
catching scornful glances
at his sandals
clingy wet swimming trunks
raphael poulain likes
peeling large strips of wallpaper
lining up and shining his shoes
emptying his toolbox
cleaning it out
and putting everything back
amélie mother
a schoolmistress from grugeon
has always had shaky nerves
facial twitch weak nerves
she dislikes puckered fingers
in the bath
having her hands touched by strangers
pillow marks on her cheek in the morning
amandine poulain likes figure
skaters costumes on tv
polishing the parquet
emptying her handbag
cleaning it out
and putting everything back
amélie is six
like all little girls
shed like to be hugged by her daddy
but he never touches her
except for a monthly checkup
the thrill of this rare contact
makes her heart beat like a drum
as a result he thinks
she has a heart defect
declared unfit for school
amélie is taught by her mother
the hens brood here henceforth
four hens brood
very good
hens fourth
no
deprived of playmates
slung between a neurotic and an iceberg
amélie retreats into her imagination
in this world lps are made like pancakes
the neighbor comatose wife
has chosen to get
all her life sleep in one go
after this
i can stay awake day and night
amélie has one friend blubber
alas the home environment
has made blubber suicidal
blubber suicide attempts
destroy mother nerves
a decision is made
enough
to comfort amélie
her mother gives her a used instamatic
little girl look what you did
a neighbor fools her
into thinking her camera causes accidents
having taken pictures all afternoon
amélie is petrified
she stares at the tv
racked by the guilt
of causing a huge fire
two derailments
a jumbo jet crash
a few days later
realizing shed been had
amélie gets her revenge
what
one day tragedy strikes
amandine takes amélie to notre dame
to pray for a baby brother
minutes later heaven sends
alas not a baby boy
but marguerite a tourist from quebec
bent on ending her life
amandine dies instantly
after her mother death
amélie lives alone with her father
his unsociable tendencies increase
he obsessed with building
a miniature shrine
to house his wife ashes
days months and years go by
in such a dead world
amélie prefers to dream
shell earn enough to leave home
five years later
she a waitress in montmartre
at the two windmills
it august 29th
in 48 hours
her life will change forever
but she doesnt know it yet
she lives quietly among
her coworkers and regulars
suzanne the owner
limps a little but never spills a drink
a former bareback artiste she likes
athletes who cry with disappointment
she dislikes seeing men
humiliated in front of their kids
georgette the tobacconist
is a hypochondriac
migraines one day sciatica the next
she hates the words fruit of thy womb
gina works with amélie
her grandma was a healer
she likes cracking bones
she brings a kir to hipolito
a failed writer
he likes seeing bullfighters gored on tv
scowling at them is joseph
gina rejected lover
he always jealously spying on her
all he likes is popping bubble wrap
here philoméne an air hostess
amélie keeps her cat when she away
philoméne likes
the sound of the cat bowl on the tiles
the cat likes overhearing
children stories
no thanks maam
i never work sundays
on weekends amélie often takes
a train to see her father
why not use your retirement
to do what
travel
youve never been away
when we were young
your mother and i longed to travel
we couldnt because of your heart
i know
so now
now
some fridays amélie sees a movie
i like looking back
at people faces in the dark
i like noticing details
that no one else sees
but i hate it in old movies
when drivers dont watch the road
you know youre
a very beautiful woman ellie
why stan
a very very beautiful woman
amélie has no boyfriend
she tried once or twice
but the results were a letdown
instead she cultivates
a taste for small pleasures
dipping her hand into sacks of grain
cracking crème brulée with a teaspoon
and skipping stones at st martin canal
they call him the glass man
he was born with bones
as brittle as crystal
all his furniture is padded
a handshake could crush his fingers
he stayed inside for twenty years
time has changed nothing
amélie still seeks solitude
she amuses herself with silly questions
about the world below
such as how many couples
are having an orgasm now
fifteen
finally on august 30 997
comes the event
that changes her life forever
lady di princess of wales
died in a car crash last night
with her companion dodi al-fayed
only the discoverer
of tutankhamen tomb
would know how she felt
upon finding this treasure
hidden by a little boy 40 years ago
on august 3st at 400 am
amélie had a dazzling idea
wherever he was
she would find the box owner
and give him back his treasure
if he was touched
shed become a regular do-gooder
if not too bad
the girl from the fifth floor
we dont see much of you
would you know of a boy
who lived in my flat in the fifties
a boy have a glass of port
no thanks
come in close the door
boys ive known so many
theyre cute
until they discover
snowballs and chestnuts
ive known so many boys
when did you come here
in 64
youll have heard the story
no
im amazed sit down
my husband worked for ladybird insurance
it no secret
he slept with his secretary
they used every hotel around
not cheap ones either
the bimbo liked spreading her legs
but only on satin
so he swiped from the till
a little at first then 50 million
off they flew to panama
drink up
on january 20970
my doorbell rang
your husband been killed
in a car crash in south america
my life stopped there
black lion died of heartbreak
poor creature
see how lovingly he stares at his master
ill read you his letters
dont go
you can spare 5 minutes
he wrote this from the army camp
darling mado
that me madeleine
i cant sleep cant eat
knowing that my only reason
to live is far away in paris
and i wont see her until next friday
when my sweet little weasel
appears at the station
in her blue dress
in brackets
the one you think is too transparent
did anyone ever write you like that
im nobody little weasel
my name is madeleine wells
madeleine like mary magdalene
she wept right
wells as in water
talk about being born to cry
about your question

a fig and three nuts as usual
who lived in my flat in the fifties
what was their name

in 950 i was two
the mental age of a cretin
the cretin is lucien
he no genius but amélie likes him
she likes the way
he handles each endive
like a precious object
to be treated with care
it his way of showing
his love of good work
look at him
like he nursing a baby bird
dont ask him for currants

how could i live
never to know the joy that you give
when im in your arms
im under your charms
how could i live
without you
groping under the photo booth
is nino quincampoix
when amélie lacked playmates
nino had too many
five miles apart they both dreamed
of having a brother and sister
to be with all the time
hi dad

ive had him for years
your mother hated him
so he lived in the tool shed
there let reconcile them
there how about that
dad if you found a precious relic
from your childhood
how would you feel
happy sad nostalgic
this gnome isnt a relic
he was a retirement gift
from my old regiment

like a secret treasure
i should varnish him before the autumn
ill make some tea

but my name is raymond dufayel
amélie poulain im a waitress at
the two windmills i know
and right now
your bredoteau basket is empty
because it not do it to

i love that painting
it the luncheon of the boating party
by renoir
ive painted one each year
for twenty years
the hardest part is the looks
i sometimes feel like
they deliberately change
their mood behind my back
they look quite happy
they should be
theyre eating hare with morels
and waffles with jam for the kids
now where that piece of paper
youve noticed my video camera
a gift from my sister-in-law
i put it there
so i dont need to wind up my clocks
after all these years
the only person i still cant capture
is the girl with the glass of water
she in the middle yet she outside
maybe she just different
in what way
i dont know
when she was little
she rarely played with other kids
maybe never
dominique
dominique bretodeau 27 rue mouffetard
it for you
every tuesday morning
dominique bretodeau buys a chicken
he roasts it with potatoes
after carving the legs and wings
he loves picking the hot carcass
with his fingers
starting with the oysters
but not today
bretodeau wont buy a chicken
hell go no further
than this phone booth here
in a flash it all came back
bahamontes winning the tour de france
aunt josette slips
and most of all the tragic day
the day he won all the marbles
the pinch bretodeau
bretodeau does he know what it is
cognac please
amazing what just happened
it must be my guardian angel
the phone booth was calling me
same here
the microwave calling me

life funny
to a kid time always drags
suddenly youre fifty
all that left of your childhood
fits in a rusty little box
you got kids miss
i have a daughter about your age
we havent spoken for years
i heard she had a child a boy
his name is lucas
it time i looked them up
before im in a box myself
dont you think
amélie has a strange feeling
of absolute harmony
it a perfect moment
soft light
a scent in the air
the quiet murmur of the city
she breathes deeply
life is simple and clear
a surge of love an urge
to help mankind comes over her
let me help you
step down here we go
the drum major widow
she worn his coat since the day he died
the horse head has lost an ear
that the florist laughing
he has crinkly eyes
in the bakery window lollipops
smell that
theyre giving out melon slices
sugarplum ice cream
were passing the park butcher
ham 79 francs spareribs 45
now the cheese shop
picadors are 290 cabecaus 2350
a baby watching a dog
that watching the chickens
now were at the kiosk by the metro
ill leave you here bye
she cant relate to other people
she was always a lonely child
on a sparkling evening in july
while on the beaches holiday hordes
relax in the new-found sun
and paris sweltering denizens
gaze at the star bursts
of the traditional fireworks
amélie poulain
godmother of outcasts
madonna of the unloved
finally succumbed to exhaustion
in paris stricken streets
a countless throng of mourners
lined her funeral route in silence
with the measureless grief
of newly orphaned children
what a strange destiny
for one who gave her all
yet took such joy
in life simple pleasures
global humanitarian
relief initiative
like don quixote she pitted herself
against the grinding windmills
of all life miseries
winter in switzerland
it was a losing battle
that claimed her life too soon
at barely 23 amélie poulain
let her young tired body merge
with the ebb and flow of universal woe
as she went she felt a stab of regret
for letting her father die
without trying to give his stifled life
the breath of air she had given
to so many others
wait
wait
wait
wait wait wait
wait wait
pages full of dual id photos
torn up and discarded by their owners
carefully reassembled by some oddball
some family album
a pack of gaulaises
just a second
it so smoky in here
where are they
i cant see a thing
more to the left more
you need change
forget it
a mauresque for the young man
one kir one mauresque
and two mint sodas
was that prenuptial or post-smooching
are you a congenital schmuck
prenuptial
dont worry
youll find your mr right one day
all women want to sleep
on a man shoulder
all men snore after a few drinks
and i have a musical ear
i had my nasal cavities fixed
i see youre a born romantic
i see youve never known true love
i did it shortened my leg
i thought you fell off a horse
i did
i was in love with a trapeze artist
stupid me they always
drop you at the last minute
he dropped me just before my act
it floored me
plus the horse
with me under it
the mauresque
still true love does exist
i know
after 30 years behind a bar
im an expert
ill even give you the recipe
take two regulars
mix them together and let them stew
it never fails
excuse me
excuse me
ill go
havent you hurt enough people
gina can defend herself
i dont mean gina
i mean georgette
look
she craves your attention
but all you can see is gina
poor girl
the things she does
to catch your eye
you really must be blind
im off on a date bye
whoever her new one is
he cant be worse
than that nut with his tape recorder
joseph not so nutty
he just in pain
come on
they split up two months ago
to keep on coming here
he must be a masochist
dont say you havent noticed
noticed what
well he always sits here right
at number 8
sit down
sit down georgette
what can you see
my cigarette counter
nothing missing
well no
make an effort
i cant see what
think about it good night
letter arrives 30 years late
a mailbag found by climbers
on a glacier on mont blanc
was part of a cargo lost
in a plane crash in the late 960s
so sad
a young pretty princess for once
it ok if she old and ugly
sure look at mother teresa
is he still chasing gina
no he has somebody else
anyone i know
funny about this glacier
somebody at the two windmills
not you
not suzanne
no
yes
there he is again
how strange
and here
him again
lyon station
and here
march 5 austerlitz
always the same blank face
always neutral
twelve times
i counted
it very odd
why keep taking your picture
all over town
and throw them away
good one too
it like a ritual
he probably terrified of growing old
it his only consolation
he dead
he scared of being forgotten
he wants to remind people of his face
like faxing his portrait
from the afterlife
a dead man scared of being forgotten
these guys here have it made
theyre long dead
but theyll never be forgotten
the girl with the glass
maybe her thoughts are with somebody else
somebody in the picture
more likely a boy she saw somewhere
and felt an affinity with
you mean shed rather imagine herself
relating to an absent person
than build relationships
with those around her
maybe she tries hard
to fix other people messy lives
what about her
her own messy life
wholl fix that
it better to help people
than a garden gnome
the trucker had 28 grams
of alcohol in his blood
makes me sick
talk about employing irresponsible morons
your keys
hold on mello
speed kills nowadays
model yourself on lucien
no radar will ever catch him
while he working
shame on you mr collignon
it not his fault
true mrs couchoix
it not his fault he cant sleep
it lady di
guess what i found in the truck
a lingerie catalog
hed pasted lady di face
over the model
what today five asparagus
or more local history
nothing
keys cut while you wait
the migraine better
yes but my sciatica
kept me awake all night
it ages since i saw you looking so good
oh yeah
a woman without love wilts
like a flower without sun
strange weather today
what so funny
youre only the 00th one to say it
we pass the time of day
to forget how time passes
we do it to keep from taking crap
i write crap that nobody publishes
another rejection
my 30th
isnt your cousin a book critic
forget it
critics are like leeches
sucking the blood of writers
is your book
a love story
it about a guy who keeps a journal
not about his past
but about disasters in his future
so he gets depressed and does nothing
basically it about a loafer
ill dedicate the manuscript to you
so youll write off his tab
his scribbles for my nibbles
that sponsorship
what took you so long
look at the time
somebody peed in his mother
foot cream
tooth paste
without you today emotions
would be the scurf of yesterday
without you today emotion
would be the scurf of yesterday
without you today emotions
would be the scurf of yesterday

sells leeks all day long
and paints turnips all night
the boy a useless vegetable
with a prompter
in each cellar window
whispering comebacks
shy people would have the last laugh
at least youll never be a vegetable
even artichokes have hearts
youll never be a vegetable
even artichokes have hearts
darling mado i miss you

this camp was the mistake of my life
depriving me of my beloved
for five long weeks
i think of you endlessly

instead of giving notice
i dream of better times ahead
an orange-colored day

and drive home every night

psychiatric helpline
where & when
one hour later on boulevard st martin
amélie walks into a party goods
and costume shop
at the same time a man leaves
his home on rue lecourbe
26 minutes later
amélie is at east station
simultaneously the man
in red shoes parks outside
the time is exactly 40
at this precise moment
only amélie has the key
to the riddle of the mystery man
how it going mrs wells
not so bad when it not raining
this is for you
me
dear mrs wells

that was lost in a plane crash
on october 2th 969 on mont blanc
we are forwarding
the enclosed letter to your address
with our apologies
for the uncustomary delay

when youll forgive me
and join me here
one orange-colored day
your everloving adrien
another package for you
you heard about the concierge
she got a letter
from her husband 40 years late
that a lot isnt it
im not big on still life mr dufayel
then work on your lean layer
fat over lean always
i heard therell soon be a new star
youre into stars now

put them in a satellite
and shoot it into space

what eating him
i smile too much
hed rather you frowned
with other men yes
nino is late
amélie can only see two explanations
he didnt get the photo
2 before he could assemble it
a gang of bank robbers took him hostage
the cops gave chase
they got away but he caused a crash
when he came to hed lost his memory
an ex-con picked him up
mistook him for a fugitive
and shipped him to istanbul
there he met some afghan raiders
who took him to steal
some russian warheads
but their truck hit a mine in tajikistan
he survived took to the hills
and became a mujaheddin
amélie refuses to get upset for a guy
wholl eat borscht all his life
in a hat like a tea cozy
what can i get you
coffee please
today menu
he understood
he going to put down his spoon
dip his finger in the sugar
turn around slowly and speak to me
is this you
yes it you
more coffee
no thanks
so it this man here with his hand up
is she in love with him
i think it time she took a real risk
she might she devising a stratagem
she fond of stratagems
in fact she cowardly
that why i cant capture her look
dufayel attempts to meddle
are intolerable
if amélie chooses to live in a dream
and remain an introverted young woman
she has an absolute right
to mess up her life
what are you doing
tell me lucien
for deliveries do you keep
keys to all the apartments
one of your booths is out of order
it seems to be jammed

photo booth
east station tuesday 5 pm

the mystery man wasnt a ghost
or a man scared of aging
but simply the repairman
a normal technician doing his work
he keeps spying on me
it making me sick
405 blatant female conspiracy

cram it failure
failed writer failed life
i love the word fail
failure is human destiny
it gasbag time
failure teaches us
that life is but a draft
a long rehearsal
for a show that will never play
i bet he stole that
i do have some original ideas
but people always steal them
same as your women
meaning
youd better get used to it
speak for yourself you
what going on
nothing much
georgette went out joseph got mad
went out
like gina

the guy with the plastic bag
i saw their little game
the note in the coat pocket
back he comes and hey presto
out they go
im worried for amélie because i like you
what do you mean
by and large
the men i like are mentally unsound
id like to know more about you
ask me
one swallow doesnt make
a swallow
a summer
practice makes
perfect
curiosity
killed the cat
haste
makes waste
rolling stone
gathers no moss
it a sin
to steal a pin
absence makes
the heart grow fonder
not bad
you collect them
at home we say a man
who knows proverbs cant be all bad
pretty girl from the fifth floor
listen to this
you believe in miracles
not today
youre in for a surprise
what if i told you
that a team of climbers
on mont blanc had found
hard proof that my husband loved me
lucien i need some yeast
for miss amélie
she baking her famous plum cake
collignon go
ill be right back
ill be back
go into the bedroom miss poulain
so little amélie
your bones arent made of glass
you can take life knocks
if you let this chance go by
eventually your heart will become
as dry and brittle as my skeleton
so
go get him for pete sake
without you today emotions
would be the scurf of yesterday
