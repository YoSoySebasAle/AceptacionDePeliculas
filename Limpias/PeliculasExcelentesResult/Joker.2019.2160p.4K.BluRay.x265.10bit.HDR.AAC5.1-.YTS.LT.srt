of every newspaper
big man what the good word
hey
hey arthur
i heard what happened
sorry mate
yeah
it doesnt seem fair
getting fired like that
did you really bring a gun
to the children hospital
artie
what the fuck
would you do that for
is that part of
your new act arthur
if your dancing
doesnt do the trick
youre just gonna
shoot yourself
why dont you
ask randall about it
it was his gun
what
i still owe you for that
dont i
what the fuck
are you talking about
stop talking
out of your ass art
oh no
i forgot to punch out
and turns to sorrow
king of all hear me call
hear my name carnival
and as our city
tries to make sense
of the brutal triple murder
on the subway last week
were joined by thomas wayne
happy look
thomas wayne on tv
yes mother
thanks for
having me on chuck
theyre asking him about
those horrible subway murders
thank you thomas
i know
this is a difficult time
for you
why him
looks like he gained weight
yes all three worked
for wayne investments
good decent educated
although i didnt know
any of them personally
like all wayne employees
past and present
theyre family
did you hear that
i told you were family
there now seems to be
a groundswell of anti-rich
sentiment in the city
it almost as if
our less fortunate residents
are taking the side
of the killer
yes and it a shame
it one of the reasons why
im considering a run for mayor
gotham lost its way
what about the eyewitness report
of the suspect being
a man in a clown mask
well
it makes total sense to me
what kind of coward would do
something that cold-blooded
someone who hides behind a mask
someone who is envious
of those more fortunate
than themselves
yet theyre too scared
to show their own face
and until those kind of people
change for the better
those of us who have
made something of our lives
will always look
at those who havent
as nothing but clowns
thomas wayne thank you
for coming in this morning
it not funny
i heard this song on the radio
the other day
and the guy was singing
that his name was carnival
arthur
which is crazy
because that
my clown name at work
and until a little while ago
it was like nobody ever saw me
even i didnt know
if i really existed
arthur i have
some bad news for you
you dont listen do you
i dont think
you ever really hear me
you just ask
the same questions every week
how your job are you
having any negative thoughts
all i have are
negative thoughts
but you dont listen anyway
i said for my whole life
i didnt know
if i even really existed
but i do
and people are
starting to notice
theyve cut our funding
were closing down
our offices next week
the city has cut funding
across the board
social services is part of that
this is the last time
well be meeting
okay
they dont give a shit
about people like you arthur
and they really
dont give a shit
about people like me either
fuck
how am i supposed to
get my medication now
who do i talk to
im sorry arthur
i think i think most women
look at sex like buying a car
you know like can i see
myself in this long-term
is it safe
is it reliable
could it kill me
most guys we look at sex
like parking a car
were like there a spot
there another spot
that would work
oh i have to pay
never mind
handicapped
i hope no one sees this
all right that my time
thank you very much guys
one more time
for sam morril yall
all right now

himself as
a lifelong gotham resident

for cooler heads to prevail
city services
have been affected
and some businesses have decided
to remain closed
amid the unrest

that been building
in the city for weeks

protesters
many dressed as clowns

several planned demonstrations
taking on the city elite
including a massive rally
outside
tomorrow night

thomas wayne
that what this whole
thing is about
the whole system

many of gotham residents
as clowns

the way of an apology

there something wrong
with those people
i am here to help them
im gonna
lift them out of poverty
help make their lives better

i got nothing left to lose
nothing can hurt me anymore
my life is nothing but a comedy
well let me get this straight
you think that killing
those guys is funny
i do
and im tired
of pretending it not
comedy is subjective murray
isnt that what they say
all of you
the system that knows so much
you decide
what right or wrong
the same way that you decide
what funny or not
get him off
well okay
i think i might understand
that you did this to
start a movement
to become a symbol
come on murray
do i look like the kind of clown
that could start a movement
i killed those guys
because they were awful
everybody is awful these days
it enough to
make anyone crazy
okay so that it
youre crazy
that your defense
for killing three young men
no
they couldnt carry a tune
to save their lives
oh why is everybody
so upset about these guys
if it was me
dying on the sidewalk
youd walk right over me
i pass you every day
and you dont notice me
but these guys what
because thomas wayne
went and cried about them on tv
you have a problem
with thomas wayne too
yes i do
have you seen what it like
out there murray
do you ever actually
leave the studio
everybody just yells
and screams at each other
nobody civil anymore
nobody thinks what it like
to be the other guy
you think men like
thomas wayne ever think
what it like to be
someone like me
to be somebody but themselves
they dont
they think that
well just sit there
and take it
like good little boys
that we wont werewolf
and go wild
you finished
i mean it so much
self-pity arthur
you sound like
youre making excuses
for killing those young men
not everybody
and ill tell you this
not everyone is awful
youre awful murray
me im awful
oh yeah how am i awful
playing my video
inviting me on this show
you just wanted to
make fun of me
youre just like
the rest of them

what you did what it led to
there are riots out there
two policemen are
in critical condition
and youre laughing
youre laughing
someone was killed today
because of what you did
i know
how about another joke murray
no i think weve had
enough of your jokes
what do you get
i dont think so
when you cross
a mentally-ill loner
with a society that abandons him
and treats him like trash
call the police gene
ill tell you what you get
call the police
you get
what you fucking deserve
good night
and always remember that
breaking news
popular tv talk show host
murray franklin
was shot dead tonight on the
live telecast of his program
the man who was
introduced by franklin
as joker is
currently under arrest
police led the suspect
handcuffed out of the studio
merely just a punchline
to a joke
you get what you
deserve
looting and rioting
have intensified here
rioting
throughout the city
with a society
that abandons him
and treats him like trash
this mob of clowns
many wearing clown masks
if it was me
dying on the sidewalk
youd walk right over me
to all of
those who have been
ignored by the system
and always remember
that life
and as you see
gotham is burning
in the white room
with black curtains near the station
black roof country no gold pavements
tired starlings
silver horses ran down moonbeams
in your dark eyes
dawnlight smiles on you leaving
my contentment
ill wait in this place
where the sun never shines
wait in this place
where the shadows run from themselves
stop laughing
you freak this isnt funny
yeah the whole
fucking city on fire
cause of what you did
all units
fire reported north of alley
code four for medical
i know

what you fucking deserve

just thinking of a joke
do you want to tell it to me
you wouldnt get it
that life
that life
and as funny as it may seem
some people get their kicks
stompin on a dream
but i dont let it
let it get me down
cause this fine old world
it keeps spinnin around
ive been a puppet a pauper a pirate
a poet a pawn and a king
ive been up and down and over and out
and i know one thing
each time i find myself flat on my face
i pick myself up
and get back in the race
that life
that life
that life
and i cant deny it
many times i thought of cuttin out
but my heart wont buy it
but if there nothing shakin
come here this july
im gonna roll myself up in a big ball
and die
my my
isnt it rich

me here at last on the ground
you in mid-air
send in the clowns
isnt it bliss
dont you approve
one who keeps tearing around
one who cant move
where are the clowns

just when i stopped
opening doors
finally knowing
the one that i wanted was yours
making my entrance again
with my usual flair
sure of my lines
no one is there
dont you love farce
my fault i fear
i thought that youd
want what i want
