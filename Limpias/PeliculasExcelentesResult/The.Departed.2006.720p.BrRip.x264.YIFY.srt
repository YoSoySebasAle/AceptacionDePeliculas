
i dont wanna be a product
of my environment
i want my environment
to be a product of me
years ago we had the church
that was only a way
of saying we had each other
but now i dont know
it a funny thing
it put hate in your heart
the knights of columbus were
real head-breakers
true guineas
they took over their piece of the city
twenty years after an irishman couldnt get
a fucking job
we had the presidency
may he rest in peace
that what the niggers dont realize
if i got one thing
against the black chappies it this
no one gives it to you
you have to take it
vin dont make me have
to come down here again for this
wont happen again mr c
carmen developing
into a fine young lady
you should be proud
you get your period yet carmen
you johnny sullivan kid
you live with your grandmother
yeah
vin get him a couple loaves of bread
couple half-gallons of milk
do you like bologna and cheese
give him some cold cuts
throw some mayo in
you like comic books
you do good in school
yeah
that good i did too
they call that a paradox
just keep it buy yourself some makeup
you ever wanna earn a little extra money
you come by l street
you know where i am on l street
good
good boy
thanks
to you o lord we commend the soul
of alphonsus your servant
in the sight of this world
he is now dead
forgive whatever sins he committed
through human weakness
amen
the church wants you in your place
kneel stand kneel stand
if you go for that sort of thing
i dont know what to do for you
a man makes his own way
no one gives it to you
you have to take it
james joyce
smart colin
guineas from the north end
down providence
tried to tell me what to do
and something maybe happened to them
maybe like that
jeez she fell funny
francis you really should see somebody
when you decide to be something
you can be it
that what they dont tell you
in the church
when i was your age they would say
we could become cops or criminals
today what im saying to you is this
when youre facing a loaded gun
what the difference
that my boy
terminal ballistics is the study
of a projectile
as it hits a target
and the destruction that it causes
take for instance what you carry
9mm hollow-point
when the hollow-point hits the skull
what happens is it mushrooms
when it mushrooms it peels back
so you may have six eight
ten little particles
of the bullet that are like razor blades
sir yes sir
tearing their internal organs
their liver their lungs their heart
bringing tissue bone blood
brain matter and that called a blowback
fuck you fucking queers
firemen getting pussy for the first time
in the history of fire or pussy
hey go save a kitten in a tree
you fucking homos
pencils
begin
what are you looking at
forget it
your father was a janitor
his son only a cop
those fucking firefighters are
a bunch of homos
they are
so she tells me you never finish anything
you finish the police course

your mother must be a wonderful woman

they put into computers
that could put a cruise missile
up the ass of a camel
from a couple hundred miles away
these pieces of plastic are worth
about 00 grand apiece
we got a guy working
for the company two months
walks out the door with

informants available to us and the bureau
without asking for too many details

i look at you and i think
what could i use you for
get rid of this
french
put it downstairs here
go ahead thank you
maybe we could work something out

we have to do it by phone
i wont do it
if i have to wear a wire
no wires understand
you dont know what this is like

with the chinese in 20-odd years
and costello is selling them
military technology
microprocessors chips computer parts
anybody says anything about
anything like that
you let us know
so who did the two guys
from providence
jimmy pappas
what happened to jimmy pappas
jimmy had a rough month

cui gives a shit
it got a frigging bow on it
i think you are a cop my son
where your license
what license
i dont see none there no such thing
as a license of course
but you you definitely need
to have fucking one
if youre not being run by us
youre being run by someone else
that means youre bringing
undesirable elements
into mr costello area
i was going for my fucking cigarettes
hey

i handpicked this group
youre my a team now our prim
hi captain
this crazy fuck
knocked jimmy bags teeth out
so

it wasnt for no reason frank
he reached into his coat
i dont know if he a bookie
or what he doing
well you do know
what a bookie does dont you
yeah yeah he pays you
queenan compartmentalizing
everything in siu

we think we might have a problem
we think costello got a rat
in the state police
really

do we have direct access
to queenan undercovers

if your father were alive
and saw you here sitting with me
let say hed have a word with me
about this
in fact hed kill seven guys
just to cut my throat
and he could do it
which is maybe something
you dont know about william costigan sr
so he never i mean never
no no no
he kept his own counsel
he never wanted money
you cant do anything
with a man like that
your uncle jackie

ever
wake the fuck up
there was a cop leaving when i came in
how did you know he was a cop
bad haircut no dress sense and a slight
you know air of scumbag entitlement

that part of what i do
i normally dont see cadets
whove been kicked out of the academy

so do they all come in here
and cry your cops
sometimes they do yeah sure
sometimes they cry yeah
if theyve had trouble at home
if theyve had to use their weapons
use their weapons
let me tell you something
they signed up to use their weapons
most of them all right
but they watch enough tv
so they know they have to weep
after they use their weapons
there is no one more full of shit
than a cop
except for a cop on tv
i looked at your file
i see that you have a record of assault
yeah
so what was it like for you in jail
what you wanna hear about the showers

of privacy of self-reliance that he has
and what do you do

i know this location is not the best
but we had very little time to set up
you guys know anything about this

sullivan team will id the bad guys
and listen in on the phones
our unit will not take action
i repeat not take action until a man
that captain queenan has inside

good mr costello
i wanna tell you at least two
of these gents have machine guns
he from the chinese government

im concerned about a chinaman
who thinks it wise
to come to a business transaction
with automatic weapons
for his own good tell bruce lee
and the karate kids
none of us are carrying
automatic weapons
because here in this country
it dont add inches to your dick
you get a life sentence for it
if we had some homeland security money
like some douche bags i could mention
any calls
they turned off their cellphones
search randomly for calls
made from the area
eight hundred and seven phones
are live in this area
then narrow the area
what you see there for service
is what youre gonna get
why did they turn their phones off
wait there still one phone up
where
the buyers are there
you know direct contact with your guys
would have its advantages
not to my guy
this is unbelievable
who put the cameras in this place
oh who the fuck are you
im the guy who does his job
you must be the other guy
if these chinks wanna nuke taiwan
any time in this century
theyd better shape up
and show me  million dollars
what we generally do in this country
is one guy
brings the items
and the other guy
pays him
no tickee
no laundry
go ahead fitz
cars are moving
but did you see anybody come out
