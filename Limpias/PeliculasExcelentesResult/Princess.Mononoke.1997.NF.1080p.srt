
in ancient times
the land lay covered in forests
where from ages long past
dwelt the spirits of the gods
yakul
ashitaka
the wise woman wants everybody back
to the village at once
we just came from ji-san
ji-san
yes in the forest
something wrong
-the birds have gone
-the animals too
ill go check with ji-san
you three hurry back home
something there
ji-san did you see it too
i did it isnt human
the wise woman calling everybody
back to the village
there look
it some kind of demon
a demon
run yakul
it headed for the village
ive got to stop it
ashitaka
that thing is cursed
dont let it touch you
yakul
calm your fury o mighty lord
whatever you may be god or demon
please leave us in peace
-the monster
-come on
go back
leave our village alone
stop please
get up
-he killed it
-ashitaka
-fetch the wise woman
-dont put the fire out yet
ashitaka
kaya dont touch it
this wound is evil
ashitaka is hurt
where is the wise woman
you must keep away from him all of you
everyone stay back
what shall we do
take this and pour it
over his wound child slowly
all right
o nameless god
of rage and hate
i bow before you
where you have fallen we will raise
a mound and perform rites
pass on in peace
and bear us no hatred
disgusting little creatures
soon all of you will feel my hate
and suffer as i have suffered
im afraid this is very bad
the stones tell me the boar god
came from far to the west
he had some kind of poison inside him
driving him mad a poisonous hatred
that consumed his heart and flesh
and turned him into a demon monster
prince ashitaka
yes
show everyone your right arm
hii-sama
my prince are you prepared to learn
what fate the stones have foretold you
yes
i was prepared the very moment
that i let my arrow fly
the infection will spread
cause you great pain and kill you
is there no way we can stop it
the prince got that wound by defending
our village and saving our lives
do we just sit here
and watch him die
you cannot alter
your fate my prince
however you can rise
to meet it if you choose
look at this
this iron ball was found
in the boar body
it shattered his bones
and burned its way deep inside him
this is what turned him into a demon
there is evil at work in the land
to the west prince ashitaka
it your fate to go there and see what
you can see with eyes unclouded by hate
you may find a way to lift the curse
you understand
yes
we are the last of the emishi
it 500 years since the emperor
destroyed our tribe
and drove the remnants
of our people to the east
some managed to survive here
for all these years
but our tribe blood has grown thinner
and weaker with each generation
now our last prince must cut his hair
and leave us never to return
sometimes i think the gods
are laughing at us
our laws forbid us
from watching you go ashitaka farewell
ashitaka
kaya what are you doing here
you know it forbidden
do you think i care about that
i came to give you this
so you wont forget your little sister
your crystal dagger
kaya i cant take this
please keep it with you
brother to protect you
please i want you to have it
so you wont forget
kaya you know
i could never forget you
a battle
move in
look up there on the hill
his head is mine
stop
my arm what happening to me
hurry stop him before he gets away
let me pass im warning you
a demon
the mark is getting bigger
are you selling soup
or donkey piss
there he is now
will this be enough
what are you trying to pull
this isnt money
give me back my rice you little thief
excuse me but might i inspect that
but this is a lump of pure gold
you silly woman
if it money you want ill pay for the
rice and take this nugget off your hands
my good people is there a money changer
who could tell us how much this is worth
no all right
now im just a monk
but id say three bags of rice at least
that right maybe even more
hey wait a minute
give me my gold
hey you cant just rush off now
dont you even think of thanking me
it was my pleasure
in fact i should be thanking you really
you see i was caught in that battle
i saw what you did to those samurai
you fight like a demon
whered you learn to fight like that
i see you noticed were being followed
that what we get for waving gold
theyll wait till were asleep
then slit our throats
what to you say we give em a little
demonstration of how fast we can run
so the demon monster
turned out to be a giant boar
i followed its trail westward
through the mountains but then--
you lost it that life
see this place here
when i came here last a few years back
this was a lovely little village
but then there must have been
a flood or a landslide everybody dead
these days there are
angry ghosts all around us
dead from wars
sickness starvation and nobody cares
so you say youre under a curse
so what so the whole damn world
ah this is good
i was wrong to fight in that village
two men are dead because of me
samurai thugs
you win some you lose some
hand me your bowl
my point is everybody dies
some now some later
beautiful bowl
ive seen one other like it
have you ever heard of the emishi people
theyre said to ride red elks
they also use stone arrowheads
just like you
of course they were all
wiped out 500 years ago
dont worry
i wont tell anyone where youre from
anyway ive got
much bigger fish to fry
have you ever come across
anything like this before
never have
it was inside the giant boar
im sure it was that ball that killed him
there a place high in the mountains
far to the west of here
it where
the forest spirit dwells
and it very dangerous for humans
to enter there is certain death
the forest spirit
ive been told the beasts there
are all giants
just as they were in the dawn of time
see ya there my friend
the sooner we get this rice home
the sooner we eat let move
coming this way
wolves
dont let the oxen panic stay calm
take up your positions
keep your powder dry
make sure you wait for them
to come within range
ready and fire
second round fire
that was it
they werent so big
theyre just pups
wait till you see their mother
it moro
come on
we killed her
you forget she is a god
it will take more than that
she certainly did some damage
we move out now
what about the men
she pushed over the cliff
theyre dead
let get the living home
he still breathing
hang on
my name is ashitaka i have travelled
far from lands to the east
are you ancient gods and have i come
to the realm of the forest spirit
go away
a kodama i never thought
id see one of them here
easy there you dont want
to make your injuries worse do you
he a tree spirit he brings good luck
it a sign this forest is healthy
but theyll lead their lord
and master right to us
who do you mean
those wolves i just saw
no i mean a real monster
like a huge enormous deer
where did it go
if yakul not afraid then we have
nothing to worry about here
would you be kind enough to grant us
passage through your forest little one
sir i really think
we should turn around now
no humans have ever made it
through these woods alive
there a lovely trail
back across the river
the current too swift
for us to get across
and your friend injuries
are very bad
hey little fellow are you showing us
the way or just getting us more lost
please sir im really pretty sure
theyre not trying to help us get home
my god
there thousands of them
look at that that must be their mother
a fine old tree
the tracks of those wolves
and the girl with them
this place must be
where the four of them live
sir i think we took a wrong turn
this is a place for gods and demons
i think were safe
well rest a bit
more tracks
whatever made these
made them recently
sir what going on
what just happened there
you went white as a sheet all of a sudden
here
did you see anything just then
-like what
-forget it
hang on just a little longer
youre almost home
thank you

back home just like you said

-where are the others kohroku
-yes is my son with you
im afraid were the only ones
who made it
it never the guards that die
stand aside
that man in the weird costume sir
who do you think it could be
he obviously an outsider
this stranger saved our lives he carried
the rifleman all the way back here
you should be grateful to him
hey watch the arm
sir hold it right there
im very grateful for you bringing
these men back to us stranger
but something doesnt smell right
you got back almost as fast as we did
and through the forbidden forest
with two badly injured men
-and you want me to believe--
-kohroku youre alive
toki
that just great
how are you gonna drive the ox
now all banged up and mangled
but
you scared me half to death
i wish the wolves had eaten you
then maybe
i could have found a real husband
sweetness can we discuss this later
toki save your sweet nothings
for some other time
and as for you gonza
a fine captain of the guard you are
always strutting and throwing
your weight around once the danger over
you never do a lick
of work around here
that unfair and untrue
thanks stranger my husband an idiot
but im glad he safe and sound
oh good i was starting to think id done
something wrong by bringing him back home
say why dont you take the mask off
i bet youre really handsome
gonza
bring the stranger to me later
i would like to thank him personally
kohroku
im happy youre back and i apologize
milady you really shouldnt
tell him things like that
if youre too nice to him
hell walk all over you
i hope youll forgive me too toki
i was responsible
i should never have let it happen
that all right milady
if you hadnt been there
the wolves would have eaten everyone
-so true
-no mistake
get some rest traveller
i will see you this evening
hey youre not handsome
youre gorgeous
here you know they had to fight off
wolves to get this rice through
just dish it out
there he is
where is he
toki was right
-he is handsome
-but he so young
that never stopped you before
quiet out there
we lost some good men today
yeah there lots
of gorgeous men in here honey
ive seen cattle
that looked better
listen stranger come over to our place
you dont want to stay in this old barn
look woman we risked our lives to bring
you the rice so watch your mouth
and who made the iron that paid
for that rice tell me that
yeah were pumping those bellows
while you pigs are in bed
actually if it not too much trouble
i would like to see where you work
you would
well have to work in make-up tonight
lend me your lipstick
-dont forget now
-well be waiting for you
it best not to pay them
any mind you know
lady eboshi spoils them rotten
that why theyre like that
they say that happy women
make a happy village
happy ha
those kind of women workin here
women like that--it a disgrace
they defile the iron
lady eboshi goes around
buying the contract
of every brothel girl she can find
milady has a kind heart that all
you got rice
on your chin old man
it true everything here has turned
upside-down since she showed up
that right she not even afraid
of the gods that woman
you should have seen the way she dealt
with nago am i right
who nago
who nago the gigantic boar god
he used to rule this whole forest
we couldnt even get near the mountains
with him around
nothing to do but sit around
on our backsides for months
see the iron in the sand
under this town had all been dug out
then we tried to get at the iron
under the mountain
but nago wasnt gonna stand for that
before we could dig for the iron
we had to clear away the forest
and that what made the boar angry
he feeling no pain
then one day lady eboshi came along
with her warriors and her rifles
young man what wrong
is something
hurting your arm
no i was just thinking
about the boar god
i was thinking how he must
have died filled with hate
forgive me
for keeping you waiting stranger
that good iron
we were running behind
with tomorrow shipment
let have a rest
you may tell the others
yes maam
some think youre a spy for the wolf girl
or for lord asano and his samurai
there are a lot of people out there
with their eyes on this iron
why are you here
if you dont mind my asking
i believe
youll recognize this
it shattered the bones
of a giant boar
rotted his flesh
and turned him into a monster
i fought with him and for that
i was cursed with this mark on my arm
and soon it will kill me
where is it you come from ive never
seen a red elk like that before
i have come a very long way
i cant tell you more than that
answer milady question
or ill cut you in half
what do you plan to do
what exactly are you here for
to see with eyes
unclouded by hate
eyes unclouded
that explains it
come ill show you all my secrets
is that wise milady
gonza take over for me
this is my garden none
of the townspeople dare to come here
follow me if you wish
to learn my secret
good evening
weve only just finished it milady
it still too heavy
perhaps if you didnt hold it
so delicately
milady if we make them
any lighter theyll fall apart
theyre not for me
theyre for the other women here
thatll be something to see
this is the latest rifle
that ive asked these people to design
the ones we brought here
have turned out to be too heavy
these will kill forest monsters and pierce
the thickest samurai armour
you better watch out there young man
lady eboshi wants to rule the world
im sorry to have to push you all so hard
ill have wine sent down later
thatll be nice
first you transform the boar into a demon
now youre making even deadlier weapons
how much more hatred and pain
do you think we need
yes im the one who shot the boar
and im sorry that you suffer
i truly am
that brainless pig im the one
he should have put a curse on not you
does that right hand of yours
wish to kill me now ashitaka
if it would lift the curse
id let it tear you apart
but even that wouldnt end
the killing now would it
no it wouldnt it would have to kill
all of us to be at peace
milady osa has something to say
forgive me milady you must not
make light of the boy strength
young man like you
i know what rage feels like
and grief and helplessness
but you must not take
your revenge on lady eboshi
she is the only one who saw us
as human beings we are lepers
the world hates and fears us
but she took us in and washed
our rotting flesh and bandaged us
osa
life is suffering it is hard
the world is cursed but still
you find reasons to keep living
im sorry
im making no sense
they just keep coming back
every night theyre out there
planting trees
trying to turn the mountain
into a forest again
stay here help me kill
the forest spirit ashitaka
you would do that
kill the very heart of the forest
without that ancient god
the animals here
would be nothing
but dumb beasts once more
when the forest has been cleared
and the wolves wiped out
this desolate place
will be the richest land in the world
and princess mononoke
will become human
princess mononoke
princess of the spirits of ghouls
beasts and ancient gods
the wolf stole her soul
and now she lives to kill me
the legends say the blood of the great
forest spirit can heal anything
perhaps it could cure my poor lepers
might even be able to lift your curse
milady
how does the action feel to you
smooth as silk the perfect thing
for ruling the world
it still too heavy for the girls
all right

in these stinking animal skins you know
but sir we cant
it a sin to look at it
and you call yourself
the greatest hunter in the west
look weve got a letter
of pardon from the emperor
forgiving us for cutting off the head
of the great forest spirit
the legends tell us
that when day becomes night
the forest spirit
turns into the nightwalker
and at sunrise
it changes back
look see there
it happening
take a look master jigo
what is it
over there
look there must be hundreds of them
those boars are not from this region
they mustve been traveling
for months to get here
that one okkoto
cant be they say he died 00 years ago
it him all right
i know those old tusks
and it looks like he brought
along his whole tribe
he seen us
let get out of here
come on you cowards
move quickly
the bullet wound gone
yakul
youre awake you should thank yakul
he hasnt left your side this whole time
howd you know his name yakul
he told me and he told me about you--
about your village
your people and your forest
the forest spirit brought you back
to life again he wants you to live
i had the strangest dream
there was a golden creature
eat this
chew
we are here to kill the humans
and save the forest
why are there humans here moro
humans are everywhere
these days
go back to your own mountain kill them
there the girl is san my daughter
we will kill them here
we will save this forest
what is that other human
doing here
he was shot and then
the great spirit healed his wound
this man is not our enemy
the forest spirit saved him
saved the life of that loathsome runt
why didnt he save nago
is he not the guardian of the forest why
the forest spirit gives life
and takes life away
life and death are his alone
or have you boars forgotten that
you lie you must have begged
the forest spirit to spare his life
but you did not beg
for nago did you
nago was afraid to die
now i too
carry within my breast
a poisoned human bullet
nago fled and the darkness took him
i remain and contemplate my death
mother please ask
the forest spirit to save you
i have lived long enough san
soon the forest spirit
will let me rest forever
all these years you defended
the forest spirit he must save you
you are not fooling us
nago was beautiful and strong
he would not have run from anything
you wolves must have eaten him
quiet watch what you say
you filthy pig
gods of the mountain
please listen to me
nago died far from here
and i was the one who killed him
he had become some kind of demon
one day he attacked our village
if you want proof
look at my hand where he touched me
i came here to beg the forest spirit
to lift nago curse from me
he healed the bullet wound in my side
but the demon mark remains
first it will tear my soul apart
and then it will kill me
okkoto finally
a boar who will listen to reason
no lord okkoto wait
please you mustnt eat him
you are moro human child arent you
i have heard of you
youre blind
stand back
i will not eat him
it all right san
my lord okkoto what i said
about nago death was the truth
i believe you
and i thank you for it young one
i am only grieved and ashamed
that a demon has come from our tribe
o mighty lord is there a way
to lift nago curse from me
leave this forest for the next time
we meet i will have to kill you
you cannot win against the humans
their guns will destroy you all
look on my tribe moro
we grow small and we grow stupid
we will soon be nothing
but squealing game
that the humans
hunt for their meat
youd risk everything on one last battle
that just what the humans want
i do not ask for the help
of the wolf tribe
even if every one of us dies it will be
a battle the humans will never forget
the forest spirit
come on keep your oxen together
hurry
get ready now
little bit closer

ready--
well i see somebody is going to have
to go play the peacemaker
take our riflemen
and hide behind the cliffs
-there they are
-where
the hunters are ready sir
excellent
well done my boy
go and spread the word
well be moving out presently
greetings jigo
ive got the emperor
breathing down my neck
and youre busy playing war
with lord asano
and youd have nothing to do with him
being here now would you
of course not
whatever made you think that
hell call a truce
if i give him half my iron
is that right
well he a greedy bastard isnt he
but all the same you might as well
let him have his iron
listen the boars are gathering
for battle you know what that means
you made a promise
get me the head of the forest spirit
then we can come back
and destroy lord asano together
watch out milady
there a horseman coming get in
well speak of the devil
a messenger from lord asano
we have guests
mind your manners ladies
yes maam
welcome back milady
whoa wait
wont you even talk to the man
lady eboshi mistress of irontown i bring
a message to you from my lord asano
you have fought valiantly and well
now open your gates
that we may speak with you
hmph we can hear you
just fine from down there
milady took this mountain away
from the gods the boars and beasts
and now that it worth something
you want it
well you wont get it
you ladies need to be taught some respect
respect what that
we havent had any respect
since the day we were born
you want some of our iron
here ya go
they are really something
theyll fight forest gods or samurai
it doesnt matter to them
theyre an amazing bunch your girls
they were wasted in the brothels
impressive for a piece of paper
well you know it gotten me
all the best hunters and trappers around
remember my dear lady
were after a god not just a beast
yes milady what is it
do you have any idea
who this paper has come from
from the emperor himself
-the emperor
-who he
-the mikado
-the mikado
okay you got me there
-thank you
-yes milady
every day that we cut trees
and dig for iron
the forest and its creatures grow weaker
my way
there is no loss of life jigo
listen you owe me
and ive come to collect
when you needed riflemen i sent them
and without them you lose irontown
im sorry
did that sound like a threat
dont tell me
the emperor believes
that wives tale about the great spirit
head granting immortality
im sure i dont know what the emperor
believes im just a humble monk
im just trying to get by
i keep my promises
we have fought the boars before theyre
easier to kill than moro and her cubs
so you can call out that shady bunch
youve got hidden under the cliff jigo
so ive been found out
just one more thing milady
did a stranger come through here
by any chance
he a young man
riding a great big red elk
came and went
a bad-looking bunch
if you ask me
those men are
no ordinary hunters
-theyre killers
-killers
milady at least let
some of us go with you
yes you cant trust these men
theyre strangers
what if it goes wrong
and were stuck here we cant help you
you said yourself were better shots
than the men are
that precisely why i want
you all here in irontown
i can deal with forest gods
it humans im worried about
once the forest spirit is dead
we dont know what will happen
will jigo be satisfied
with the creature head
or will he be after my ironworks as well
jigo riflemen may turn on us
if that happens ill need
every one of you here to fight them
remember you cant trust men
dont worry about her ladyship
ill be right at her side protecting her
-that what were afraid of
-what
even if you were a woman
youd still be an idiot
do you suffer
you know you could always jump boy
end it all
as soon as your strength returns
the mark will spread and destroy you
it feels like i mustve been asleep
for weeks
i had a dream that san
was by my side nursing me
i was hoping youd cry out in your sleep
then i would have bitten
your head off to silence you
it a beautiful forest
are okkoto
and the boars on the move yet
yes the boars are marching
the trees cry out as they die
but you cannot hear them
i listen to the forest pain and feel
the ache of the bullet in my chest
and i dream of the day
when i will finally crunch
that gun woman head in my jaws
moro why cant the humans
and the forest live together
why cant we stop
this fighting now
the humans are gathering
for the final battle
the flames of their guns
will burn us all
and what happens to san
what your plan to let her die with you
typical selfish
you think like a human
san is my daughter
she is of the wolf tribe
when the forest dies so does she
you must set her free
she not a wolf she human
silence boy
how dare you speak
to a god like that
i caught her human parents
defiling my forest
they threw their baby
at my feet as they ran away
instead of eating her
i raised her as my own
now my poor ugly beautiful daughter
is neither human nor wolf
how could you help her
i dont know but at least
we might find a way to live
how will you join forces with san
and fight the humans
no all that would do
is cause more hatred
there is nothing
you can do boy
soon the demon mark
will spread and kill you
leave this place at sunrise
return and i shall kill you
youre feeling all right
im fine thanks to you
and the forest spirit
yakul sorry if i worried you
i guess my legs are still
pretty weak
it so quiet i wonder
where the little kodama went
i can smell the ironworks
thanks for showing us the way
i have another favour to ask
will you please give this
to san for me
let go
it stinks
and it burns my eyes
that what they want theyre trying
to kill our sense of smell
it that damn woman again
she knows were out here
-it a trap and a stupid one
-what
theyre trying to lure
the boars out of the forest
the humans are planning something
then we have to find okkoto
while there still time to stop him
or theyll be killed
okkoto is too stubborn
he wont listen none of them will
they may even know it a trap
the boars are a proud race
the last one left alive
will still be charging blindly forward
why chop the trees down
to make them angry
which makes them stupid
mother i have to go
okkoto blind
i must be his eyes
you understand
do as you must
you know that boy wanted to share
his life with you
i hate him
i hate all humans
from ashitaka for me
pretty
you two stay with san
i must go to the forest spirit
let go
the moro tribe has come to fight with you
where can i find lord okkoto
thank you
it coming from irontown
let go

out of the way

-he a dead man anyway
-cease fire
toki come and look

so it not a ghost
ashitaka

and ambush us while our men were away
-thought wed just roll over
-but we showed them
where lady eboshi
she took every able-bodied man
and went to kill the forest spirit
were cut off here cant

we havent got a lot of time
those samurai bastards
asano mustve just been waiting
for us to leave irontown
now i must find lady eboshi
she off hunting down
the forest spirit
then someone got
to stop her call her back
if youre all done
i want you out of here
the rest of you keep digging
wait what about irontown
that right it our home
what do they expect us to do
abandon irontown
you heard the boy
we havent a moment to lose
send a message to lady eboshi
no messenger would have
a chance of finding her
then send out a hunter
what else are they good for
lady eboshi
is just being used by jigo
when you fought with the boars
were there any wolves with them
did you see san
the wolf girl
i have no idea it was pitch black
when the animals came at us
she was there
i saw her
i was right in the front line
i saw everything everything
-what happened
-im not sure
everything started happening so fast
it was like a nightmare
jigo troops put us in front
as bait to lure the boars in
they didnt tell us
about the land mines under our feet
or the grenades
coming in on top of us
where san
take it easy
im trying to get you out
there a wolf over here
hey hurry
young master

i have got to find lady eboshi
this wolf gonna help me find her

what more important the head
of the forest spirit or saving your town
those darts are poison
that enough now
im not gonna slave any longer
heave
look out
after youve come through the swamp
take cover by the lake until we get there
be careful
those riflemen with milady belong to jigo

come on keep moving
straight ahead today we finish this
sir
yes have you spotted them
okkoto badly wounded
he and the wolf girl are making their way
to the realm of the forest spirit
so theyre going to beg him
for his help are they keep after them
but stay out of sight or youll scare
the forest spirit away
yes sir i understand
that was boar blood
painted on his face wasnt it
a little trade secret
dont want to smell human
were almost at the pool
of the forest spirit
what was that
lord okkoto something wrong
we have to keep moving
something out there
what with so much blood
in the air i cant smell it
i should have known it was you
you did this
because of you the forest will die
youre wrong
weve all been fighting to save it
this is the thanks you give us
you bring bad things
bad things coming
neither human nor animal
what do you mean
neither human nor animal
-theyre coming
-it the end for us
theyre warriors
theyve come back
my warriors they have come back to me
from the land of the dead
forward my warriors
forward to the pool of the forest spirit
no lord okkoto
your warriors havent come back to you
those are humans wearing the skins
of your warriors to hide their scent
it a trick
it just a human trick to get us
to lead them to the forest spirit
come out forest spirit
if you are truly master here
give my warriors the power
to slay the humans and be victorious
stop lord okkoto please
youve got to listen
san theyre all around us
okkoto done for leave him
no i wont let him turn
into a demon like nago did
tell mother that the humans are setting
a trap for the forest spirit
shell know what to do
youll have to hurry
or it could mean the end of all of us
go on now
stay back or you die

lord asano samurai
have attacked irontown
the women are outnumbered
they cant hold them off for long
forget about the forest spirit
your men are already heading back
but they need you to lead them
what proof is there this isnt a lie
lie dont be ridiculous
what reason do i have to lie
so we dont kill the forest gods

no what i want is for the humans
and the forest to live in peace
just whose side is he on anyway
shouldnt we go back
the women are on their own now
they can take care of themselves
there the pool
the creature must be somewhere nearby
