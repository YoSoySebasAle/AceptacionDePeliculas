
first my contours
the outline
not too fast
take time to look at me
see how my arms are placed
my hands
who brought that painting out
from the stock
i shouldnt have
no
did you paint it
yes
a long time ago
what the title
portrait of a lady on fire
where do i go
head straight up to the trees
im marianne
it was a reception room
ive never seen it used
have you been here long
three years
do you like it here
yes
ill let you get dry
sorry i helped myself
i was hungry
is there any wine
yes
may i be curious
what is your young mistress like
i dont know her well
youve been here three years
she only arrived a few weeks ago
where from
the benedictines
has she left holy orders
they brought her home
her sister died
she was the only one due to marry
did disease take her
no
will you manage it
manage what
to paint her
why do you ask
another painter was here
he wasnt able to
what happened
i dont know
im afraid it the only one
she has no dresses yet
and wears her convent clothes
she has blond hair
yes
this will do
do you recognize it
my father painted it
one of his first
it was milan before my marriage
my daughter suitor is milanese
well go there if he likes the portrait
youll leave
i have to tell you
she wore out one painter before you
in a very simple manner
she refused to pose
he never saw her face
why wont she be painted
she refuses this marriage
you must paint her without her knowing
she thinks youre a companion
for walks
she delighted
since she arrived i dont let her out
why not
i wasnt wary enough with her sister
she thinks ill watch over her
and you observe her
is painting her that way feasible
more than being a companion
the portrait arrived here before me
when i first entered this room
i found myself facing my image
hanging on the wall
she was waiting for me
she waiting to go out
come in
tell me what happened to your mistress
how did she die
we were walking by the cliffs
she was behind me and vanished
i saw her broken body below
did you see her fall
no
i think she jumped
why do you think that
she didnt cry out
ive dreamt of that for years
dying
running
one must show the ear
and study its cartilage closely
even if covered with hair
it must be
of a warm and transparent hue
except for the hole
which is always strong
its tone even in light
must yield to the cheek
which is more prominent
did you bring a book
yes
may i borrow it
ill fetch it
thank you
it odd you sleep here
miss
miss
she waiting
is she downstairs
i must cover you up
it windy
id like to bathe
on a calmer day
yes
how long will you stay
six more days
do you swim
i dont know
it too dangerous if you dont
i meant i dont know if i can swim
how was your day
difficult
she always stays ahead of me
and walks alone on the beach
have you started painting
not yet
i havent even seen her smile
have you tried to be funny
is it unfinished
my sister was embroidering it
do you think she wanted to die
youre the first person
unafraid to ask that
apart from you
not out loud but yes
in her last letter she apologized
for no reason
what could she be apologizing for
for leaving me her fate
you make it sound terrible
what do you know of my marriage
youre to wed
a milanese gentleman that all
that all i know too
you see why it worries me
put that way yes
i put it the way it is
youd rather have stayed
in the convent
it a life that has advantages
there a library
you can sing or hear music
and equality is a pleasant feeling
i found the convent unjust
i left after my first communion
they punished me
for drawing in my notebooks margins
you draw
yes a little
what about you
when will you marry
i dont know if i will
you dont have to
no
ill take over my father business
you can choose
that why you dont understand me
i understand you
how are your days
we return late
and i have little light to work
ill keep here here tomorrow afternoon
youll be free to make progress
perhaps you could allow her
to go out alone
fear not she isnt sad but angry
you think i dont know her anger
i know it well
yes i know it too
where did you learn italian
in milan
you know milan
i cant wait to go back
i havent gone back in 20 years
tell her milan is beautiful
and that life will be sweeter
she doesnt talk much to me
im not marrying her
to the local gentry
im trying
to take her elsewhere
shell be less bored there
and you too
indeed why not
ill leave for the coast
at the same time as you
if you dont have to return to paris
i have a friend
whod like her portrait done
thank you
it wont be easy
my friend is particularly ugly
she very ugly
youve made me laugh
it ages since that happened
i didnt do anything
youre here
it takes two to be funny
marianne
do you have tobacco
yes
your mother will let you
go out alone tomorrow
youll be free
being free is being alone
you dont think so
ill tell you tomorrow
ill go to mass
to receive communion
i want to hear music
organ music is pretty but bleak
it all i know
youve never heard an orchestra
no
have you
tell me about it
it not easy to relate music
what is it
a piece that i love
is it merry
not merry but it lively
it about a coming storm
the insects sense it
they become agitated
then the storm brakes
with lightning and the wind
i cant remember it
youll hear the rest
milan is a city of music
then i cant wait for milan
im saying there will be good things
youre saying that now and then
ill be consoled
how was mass
you look cheerful
i sang a lot
are you leaving me already
yes
will you come out tomorrow
yes
in solitude
i felt the liberty you spoke of
but i also felt your absence
the portrait is finished
are you happy with it
i think so
let go to see it
may i ask a favour
go on
id like to show her first
and tell her the truth myself
i understand
she very fond of you
how do you know
she talks about you
héloïse
i must tell you something
im a painter
i came here to paint you
ive finished your portrait
i see now why you praised
the charms of exile
you felt guilty
are you leaving
later today with your mother
then i shall bathe today
well can you swim
i still dont know if i can
did you see me
you can float
let go back
it explains all your looks
youre saying nothing
is that me
yes
is that how you see me
it not only me
what do you mean not only you
there are rules conventions ideas
you mean there no life
no presence
your presence is made up
of fleeting moments that may lack truth
not everything is fleeting
some feelings are deep
the fact it isnt close to me
that i can understand
but i find it sad
it isnt close to you
how do you know
it isnt close to me
i didnt know you were an art critic
i didnt know you were a painter
ill fetch my mother
it wasnt good enough ill start again
youre joking
im sorry
it wasnt satisfactory
youre incompetent then
you can leave
she staying
ill pose for her
really
yes
why
what does it change for you
nothing
ill be away five days
when i return it will be finished
and i decide not you
understood
say goodbye like when you were little
sit down
turn your chest towards me
a little more
turn your head slightly
rest your arm here
not like that may i
take your hand
the other way
like this
are you comfortable
yes
can you hold this position
yes
look at me
the heat will do you good
the cherrystones hold it in
thank you
i usually have one ready
but i havent had my monthlies
more than once
three times
is this the first time
yes
do you want a child
no
i was waiting for madam to leave
to see to it
i cant
a little more
i cant go on
no
it mustnt be in flower
it ready
will it be enough
well see
has it happened to you
yes
youve known love
yes
what is it like
it hard to say
i mean how does it feel
i cant make you smile
i feel i do it
and then it vanishes
anger always comes to the fore
definitely with you
i didnt mean to hurt you
you havent hurt me
i have i can tell
when youre moved
you do this with your hand
really
yes
and when youre embarrassed
you bite your lips
and when youre annoyed
you dont blink
you know it all
forgive me
id hate to be in your place
were in the same place
exactly the same place
come here
come
step closer
look
if you look at me
who do i look at
when you dont know what to say
you touch your forehead
when you lose control
you raise your eyebrows
and when youre troubled
you breathe through your mouth
i didnt touch
i win
i win
you touched it
try to concentrate
your turn
youre cheating
im not cheating i play fast
go on
two
two cards
two
two sixes
i win
you win yes
your turn
no go on
go on
uncover your throat
more
you have my future husband in mind
do you paint nude models too
women yes
why not men
im not allowed to
why not
because im a woman
is it a matter of modesty
it mostly to prevent us
from doing great art
without any notion of male anatomy
the major subjects escape us
how do you manage
i do it in secret
it tolerated
what do you tell your models
to amuse them
are you bored
no
im interested in you
your complexion is remarkable today
youre very elegant
you pose beautifully
youre pretty
that what i tell them
then striking the lyre
to accompany his words he sang
oh gods of the underworld
to which all mortals descend
i am here to seek my wife
a viper that she trod on
poisoned her
and robbed her of her youth
i beseech you
unravel the thread
of eurydice early demise
all will be yours
we all end up here
this is our final abode
you reign over the human race
after living out her fair span of years
she will be yours
if the fates refuse my wife this favour
i am determined not to return
you may delight in both our deaths
he convincing
very
i hope they say yes
then for the first time
tears wet the cheeks of the eumenides
won over by his words
neither the king bride
nor the ruler of hades
could resist his prayer
they sent for eurydice
she was there among the recent spirits
and approached limping from her wound
she was returned to orpheus on condition
that he would not look back
until outside
or the favour would be void
in deep silence
they took a sloping path
steep and dark
shrouded in thick mist
they were nearing the surface
approaching the threshold when
fearing losing eurydice
and impatient to see her
her loving spouse turned
and she was instantly drawn back
she reached out for his embrace
and wished to hold him
her poor hands
clutched only the empty air
dying a second time
she did not complain
his sole fault was loving her
that horrible
poor woman why did he turn
he was told not to but did
for no reason
there are reasons
you think so
read it again
they were nearing the surface
approaching the threshold
when fearing losing eurydice
and impatient to see her
her loving spouse turned
no he cant look at her
for fear of losing her
that no reason
he was told not to do that
he madly in love he cant resist
i think sophie has a point
he could resist
his reasons arent serious
perhaps he makes a choice
what choice
he chooses the memory of her
that why he turns
he doesnt make the lover choice
but the poet
she spoke a last farewell
that scarcely reached his ears
and fell back into the abyss
perhaps she was the one
who said
turn around
she says im still pregnant
and to come back in two days
ill come with you
what about héloïse
she isnt well she doesnt want dinner
i thought you had been scared off
you were right
i am scared
do all lovers feel
theyre inventing something
i know the gestures
i imagined it all waiting for you
you dreamt of me
no
i thought of you
you dont want to come anymore
im coming
get up
wait
that good
lie down
lift your legs
there
thank you
deep breaths
look
go to bed
ill watch over her
i dont want to go to bed
sophie
are you asleep
no
can you get up
help her
get your things
were going to paint
sophie
come here
sit down
come closer
lie down
look at her
arch your back a little
sophie
straighten your head
yes
stop that
what
what youre doing
be serious
keep still
i bought it from a woman at the feast
it a plant
she said it makes you fly
have you ever tried it
never
do you want to
now
she said it makes time last longer
your eyes
you have to drink
this time i like it
perhaps because i know you better
perhaps ive changed
perhaps
you didnt destroy the last one for me
you did it for you
id like to destroy this one too
why
through it i give you to another
it terrible
now you possess me a little
you bear me a grudge
i dont
you do
you know you do
youre not on my side now
you blame me for what comes next
my marriage
you dont support me
youre right
go on
say what burdens your heart
i believed you braver
i believed you braver too
that it then
you find me docile
worse
you imagine im collusive
you imagine my pleasure
it a way of avoiding hope
imagine me happy or unhappy
if that reassures you
but do not imagine me guilty
youd prefer me to resist
yes
are you asking me to
answer me
no
have you seen héloïse
no she isnt in her room
weve had news
madam returns tomorrow
very well
will you be ready
yes
forgive me
forgive me
your mother returns tomorrow
come here
with me
when do we know it finished
at one point we stop
finished
who is that for
for me
you can reproduce that image
to infinity
yes
after a while
youll see her
when you think of me
ill have no image of you
do you want an image of me
yes
which one
that one
give me your book
give me a figure
your eyes are closing
dont go to sleep
i feel something new
what
regret
dont regret
remember
ill remember when you fell asleep
in the kitchen
ill remember
your dark look
when i beat you at cards
ill remember
the first time you laughed
you took your time being funny
that true
i wasted time
i wasted time too
ill remember
the first time i wanted to kiss you
when was that
you didnt notice
at the feast around the bonfire
i wanted to yes
but that wasnt the first time
tell me
no you tell me
when you asked if i had known love
i could tell the answer was yes
and that it was now
i remember
good morning
good morning
theyre here
very good
for you
thank you
héloïse
come with me
in a minute
no now
i have a gift for you
ill say goodbye here
goodbye
have a safe journey
turn around
youve made me look so sad
you were
im not anymore
i saw her again a first time
are you standing guard
im observing reactions
do you want mine
this orpheus is excellent
your father is in shape
it my painting
i submitted it in his name
usually he portrayed before he turns
or after as eurydice dies
here they seem to be saying goodbye
i saw her one last time
she didnt see me
