00:00:13,907 --> 00:00:15,784
<i>In the summer of 1953,</i>

2
00:00:15,867 --> 00:00:18,912
<i>it was announced
that an atomic bomb of foreign origin</i>

3
00:00:18,995 --> 00:00:22,624
<i>had been exploded somewhere
outside of the United States.</i>

4
00:00:22,707 --> 00:00:26,294
<i>Shortly thereafter, it was indicated
that this atomic reaction,</i>

5
00:00:26,378 --> 00:00:28,296
<i>according to scientific reports,</i>

6
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,175
<i>had originated in a remote area
in North Pacific waters,</i>

7
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,262
<i>somewhere between the northern tip
of the Japanese islands</i>

8
00:00:35,345 --> 00:00:37,264
<i>and the arctic circle.</i>

9
00:00:37,347 --> 00:00:39,849
<i>This is the story of that explosion.</i>

10
00:03:36,109 --> 00:03:38,027
Oh!

11
00:03:41,156 --> 00:03:43,992
Professor Montel.
I'm McCleary of the <i>Herald Tribune.</i>

12
00:03:44,075 --> 00:03:45,994
Oh, yes. How do you do?

13
00:03:46,077 --> 00:03:49,581
I understand that you're going
to Vienna to address the,

14
00:03:49,664 --> 00:03:52,000
Central European Federation
of Advanced Scientists.

15
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,710
That is correct.

16
00:03:53,793 --> 00:03:57,005
I will read a paper on the emission
of neutrons and collision of nuclei.

17
00:03:57,088 --> 00:03:58,506
Thank you, Professor.

18
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,776
Will any of the American Atomic
Energy Commission be present?

19
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,051
I doubt it.

20
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,310
Will you excuse me, gentlemen?

21
00:04:30,038 --> 00:04:32,791
<i>Oui.</i>

22
00:04:42,675 --> 00:04:43,718
Professor. Excuse me.

23
00:04:43,802 --> 00:04:46,020
There's one or two points
I'd like to get clarified.

24
00:04:51,643 --> 00:04:55,647
You will have to excuse me, gentlemen.
The plane is waiting.

25
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,108
Who's the girl?

26
00:05:02,821 --> 00:05:06,407
<i>This is the BBC
with the latest news bulletin.</i>

27
00:05:06,491 --> 00:05:10,578
<i>Professor Montel, famous nuclear physicist
and atomic scientist,</i>

28
00:05:10,662 --> 00:05:13,790
<i>has vanished while en route
to attend a conference in Vienna.</i>

29
00:05:13,873 --> 00:05:17,418
<i>Professor Montel's disappearance
is a complete mystery to the police.</i>

30
00:05:17,502 --> 00:05:21,005
<i>Authoritative sources reveal today
that the former Nobel Prize winner</i>

31
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:25,134
<i>is the fifth noted scientist believed
to have vanished behind the iron curtain.</i>

32
00:05:25,218 --> 00:05:28,805
<i>Professor Montel was last seen
at the International Airport in Vienna.</i>

33
00:05:28,888 --> 00:05:31,099
<i>Speculation as to the whereabouts</i>

34
00:05:31,182 --> 00:05:33,434
<i>of Professor Montel continues.</i>

35
00:05:33,518 --> 00:05:36,771
<i>Ten days have elapsed
since the distinguished scientist vanished,</i>

36
00:05:36,855 --> 00:05:40,441
<i>and so far police have been unable
to offer any explanation.</i>

37
00:05:43,403 --> 00:05:45,864
<i>Authorities are now convinced</i>

38
00:05:45,947 --> 00:05:48,533
<i>that Professor Montel was not kidnapped</i>

39
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:51,411
<i>and that his disappearance
was part of a prearranged plan.</i>

40
00:05:51,494 --> 00:05:54,455
<i>Airport officials in Vienna
reveal that the scientist</i>

41
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:57,083
<i>carried a diplomatic passport.</i>

42
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,627
<i>The search for Professor Montel</i>

43
00:05:59,711 --> 00:06:01,021

44
00:06:01,045 --> 00:06:04,233
<i>It is interesting to note that while the
story has been given front-page space</i>

45
00:06:04,257 --> 00:06:07,468
<i>in newspapers in the United States

Pravda, <i>the official mouthpiece</i>
<i>of the Soviet Union,</i>

47
00:06:10,555 --> 00:06:12,807
<i>has, as yet, failed to take note on it.</i>

48
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:43,296
- Corporal Lee Stockwell?
- Right.

49
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:48,134
- Mr. R.♪. MacDougall?
- That's right.

50
00:06:49,928 --> 00:06:52,180
- Mr. Franklin Meredith.
- That's correct.

51
00:06:52,263 --> 00:06:54,223
Jones!

52
00:06:54,307 --> 00:06:57,101
I'm afraid you're mistaken.
My name's MacDougall.

53
00:06:57,185 --> 00:07:00,688
You're a dead ringer for an officer
I used to know in the submarine service.

54
00:07:00,772 --> 00:07:02,690
Sorry.

55
00:07:11,783 --> 00:07:14,035
Mr. MacDougall?

56
00:07:14,118 --> 00:07:16,037
Yeah.

57
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,122
My name is Eddy.

58
00:07:19,874 --> 00:07:21,793
Your instructions.

59
00:07:27,799 --> 00:07:31,803
There is a taxi waiting for you.
The driver knows the address.

60
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:34,138
Taxi number 63.

61
00:07:34,222 --> 00:07:36,391
Number 63.

62
00:07:36,474 --> 00:07:38,393
Okay.

63
00:08:00,248 --> 00:08:02,166
This is it.

64
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:07,296
- You better wait for me.
- No, I go now.

65
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,483
Wait a minute. What if I need you again?
Where can I find you?

66
00:08:09,507 --> 00:08:11,676
- What's your name?
- Eddy.

67
00:08:39,662 --> 00:08:41,581
Mr. MacDougall?

68
00:08:42,665 --> 00:08:45,543
- Yeah.
- Come in, please, and follow me.

69
00:08:55,344 --> 00:08:57,346
Watch your step, please.

70
00:09:11,569 --> 00:09:15,364
- Now don't tell me your name is Eddy too.
- "Eddy" is the password.

71
00:09:15,448 --> 00:09:17,533
I'm Hokada Fujimori, Commander Jones.

72
00:09:17,617 --> 00:09:19,619
I'm very pleased to meet you.

73
00:09:19,702 --> 00:09:24,582
Thanks. For a minute there, I thought
this was something out of <i>Inner Sanctum.</i>

74
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:29,796
You've lost a little weight.

75
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:32,965
I'm on a diet.

76
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:36,844
I'll bet Captain Taylor
put a little fat on?

77
00:09:36,928 --> 00:09:40,932
- Where is he?
- I'm sorry to tell you, your friend is dead.

78
00:09:43,434 --> 00:09:44,268
Dead?

79
00:09:44,352 --> 00:09:48,231
His plane crashed returning
from an arctic expedition.

80
00:09:48,314 --> 00:09:50,316
No one survived.

81
00:09:55,738 --> 00:09:58,074
He never did like to fly.

82
00:10:00,326 --> 00:10:03,704
Why did he want me to come here?
What was the 5,000 for?

83
00:10:03,788 --> 00:10:04,997
It's an advance payment

84
00:10:05,081 --> 00:10:08,042
for a job Captain Taylor
was certain you would do for us.

85
00:10:08,126 --> 00:10:10,086
- Advance?
- Yes.

86
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:12,171
- When do I start?
- Without questions?

87
00:10:12,255 --> 00:10:16,134
Why talk? If Taylor lined me up
for the job, it must be kosher.

88
00:10:16,217 --> 00:10:18,970
Some people might not
exactly call it kosher.

89
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:21,055
In here, please.

90
00:10:33,192 --> 00:10:35,862
Gentlemen, Commander Jones.

91
00:10:35,945 --> 00:10:37,905
- Mr. McAuliff.
- How do you do, sir?

92
00:10:37,989 --> 00:10:39,907
- Colonel Schuman.
- How are you?

93
00:10:39,991 --> 00:10:42,243
- Mr. Aylesworth.
- How do you do?

94
00:10:42,326 --> 00:10:44,704
And Professor Montel.

95
00:10:56,632 --> 00:10:59,510
- Montel, the scientist?
- Yes.

96
00:10:59,594 --> 00:11:02,513
Everybody and his brother
is gunning for you, Professor.

97
00:11:02,597 --> 00:11:04,932
They say you skipped
behind the iron curtain.

98
00:11:05,016 --> 00:11:07,852
As you can see, only a wooden door.

99
00:11:08,895 --> 00:11:11,230
- Glad you're here.
- Thank you, sir.

100
00:11:12,565 --> 00:11:15,568
Well, it's quite a layout you got here.

101
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:20,489
What kind of business
are you gentlemen in?

102
00:11:20,573 --> 00:11:22,575
The business of investigation.

103
00:11:24,035 --> 00:11:26,537
The scientific investigation

104
00:11:26,621 --> 00:11:30,625
of these uninhabited North Pacific islands
that lie in neutral waters

105
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,793
between the free world
and the iron curtain.

106
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:37,298
Our deductions make us believe
that one of these islands...

107
00:11:37,381 --> 00:11:39,717
we don't know which one, Mr. Jones...

108
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,970
has been prepared as an arsenal
for atomic weapons.

109
00:11:43,054 --> 00:11:45,181
Your friend Captain Taylor
volunteered

110
00:11:45,264 --> 00:11:47,516
to undertake a photographic mission
to find out.

111
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,518
- Volunteered?
- Yes.

112
00:11:49,602 --> 00:11:51,520
- For free?
- For free.

113
00:11:51,604 --> 00:11:53,606
Is that when he had the accident?

114
00:11:53,689 --> 00:11:55,900
It was no accident.
His plane was shot down.

115
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:58,236
This photograph we have just printed

116
00:11:58,319 --> 00:12:01,656
came from the camera
of his salvaged plane.

117
00:12:03,658 --> 00:12:06,786
Thirty years in the navy,
and he gets killed for a picture.

118
00:12:06,869 --> 00:12:09,330
For free.

119
00:12:09,413 --> 00:12:14,210
Each man has his own reason
for living, Mr. Jones,

120
00:12:14,293 --> 00:12:17,296
and his own price for dying.

121
00:12:19,006 --> 00:12:21,926
This was Captain Taylor's price.

122
00:12:23,427 --> 00:12:27,098
There's nothing there, Professor.
It's a washout.

123
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:30,726
I wouldn't be too certain.
Extend these lines.

124
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:33,896
They could be atomic vault constructions.

125
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,774
And over here could also be part
of a concrete runway.

126
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:39,735
Look. Look, before we go any further,

127
00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:42,405
exactly what country do you men represent?

128
00:12:42,488 --> 00:12:46,534
We represent many countries,
as private individuals.

129
00:12:46,617 --> 00:12:49,704
We are scientists,
former statesmen, businessmen.

130
00:12:49,787 --> 00:12:52,748
All volunteers acting independently

131
00:12:52,832 --> 00:12:56,335
for a common cause
against a common enemy.

132
00:12:56,419 --> 00:12:58,337
As private individuals,

133
00:12:58,421 --> 00:13:01,674
we can conduct this investigation
on a scientific basis

134
00:13:01,757 --> 00:13:04,927
without violating any neutral waters.

135
00:13:05,011 --> 00:13:07,638
And if what we suspect is verified,

136
00:13:07,722 --> 00:13:11,058
we can then make our findings public.

137
00:13:11,142 --> 00:13:12,935
And what good will that do?

138
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:15,313
Don't you think the truth
is worth knowing?

139
00:13:15,396 --> 00:13:18,441
Don't you believe that factual proof
will establish, once and for all,

140
00:13:18,524 --> 00:13:21,569
both the identity and the intention
of the aggressor?

141
00:13:21,652 --> 00:13:25,448
Who knows?
But where do I fit into the picture?

142
00:13:25,531 --> 00:13:29,493
We want you to command a ship
for an inspection tour of these islands.

143
00:13:29,577 --> 00:13:31,912
- What kind of a ship?
- A submarine.

144
00:13:31,996 --> 00:13:34,749
We know that four times
during World War I I,

145
00:13:34,832 --> 00:13:37,585
you commanded a submarine
reconnaissance patrol

146
00:13:37,668 --> 00:13:39,628
in this very area.

147
00:13:39,712 --> 00:13:43,424
As I recall, you were extremely
successful in these waters

148
00:13:43,507 --> 00:13:45,426
when you fought my country.

149
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:49,472
This time the enemy is different,
Mr. Jones, but the waters are the same.

150
00:13:49,555 --> 00:13:52,058
You received already $5,000.

151
00:13:52,141 --> 00:13:55,102
20,000 in United States currency

152
00:13:55,186 --> 00:13:59,148
will be deposited to your account
in any bank you elect

153
00:13:59,231 --> 00:14:01,942
to chauffeur Professor Montel
to this island.

154
00:14:02,026 --> 00:14:06,489
And another 25,000 bonus
when you bring him back safely

155
00:14:06,572 --> 00:14:09,075
with all the information he seeks.

156
00:14:11,619 --> 00:14:14,121
What about the sub?
Did it volunteer too?

157
00:14:14,205 --> 00:14:17,500
One does not pick up a first-class
submarine in the junkyard, Mr. Jones.

158
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,627
We have salvaged a Japanese submarine.

159
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,629
- What class?
- I-203.

160
00:14:21,712 --> 00:14:24,840
Sewer pipe. Had one on my tail once
for six hours. Taylor look her over?

161
00:14:24,924 --> 00:14:26,550
- Yes.
- Start getting her refitted?

162
00:14:26,634 --> 00:14:28,636
- Yes.
- Armed?

163
00:14:28,719 --> 00:14:31,055
Mr. Jones,
the object of this mission

164
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:35,017
is scientific investigation,
not combat.

165
00:14:35,101 --> 00:14:36,268
Professor...

166
00:14:37,353 --> 00:14:39,271
am I in command?

167
00:14:39,355 --> 00:14:42,483
- That's right.
- Then we arm the sub.

168
00:14:42,566 --> 00:14:45,694
That is, if you want me
to get you back in one piece.

169
00:14:45,778 --> 00:14:49,073
Did you also salvage a crew?

170
00:14:49,156 --> 00:14:52,159
We have picked volunteers,
experienced men.

171
00:14:52,243 --> 00:14:54,328
There will be two scientists on board.

172
00:14:54,412 --> 00:14:57,123
Professor Montel and his assistant,
Professor Gerard.

173
00:14:57,206 --> 00:14:59,792
We aren't positive which island it is,

174
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:03,003
but a certain freighter, the <i>Kiang Ching,</i>

175
00:15:03,087 --> 00:15:06,173
has been up to this area
several times before

176
00:15:06,257 --> 00:15:09,135
with cargos of concrete and heavy metals.

177
00:15:09,218 --> 00:15:11,679
She's loading again at Tientsin.

178
00:15:11,762 --> 00:15:14,390
The last time I tailed a freighter,
my price was 650 a month,

179
00:15:14,473 --> 00:15:16,434
and I had to buy my own uniforms.

180
00:15:19,311 --> 00:15:23,816
All right. I want my own key men,
men who've served with me before.

181
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:25,943
You name them, and we'll get them.

182
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:28,654
Like you got me? For cash.

183
00:15:28,737 --> 00:15:30,656
If it's necessary.

184
00:15:30,739 --> 00:15:32,992
As I said before, Mr. Jones,

185
00:15:33,075 --> 00:15:35,786
each man has his own reason for living

186
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:38,205
and his own price for dying.

187
00:15:38,289 --> 00:15:40,583
I hope, for all of us,

188
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:43,586
that it will be a <i>bon voyage.</i>

189
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:02,646
<i>Giovane!</i> Help him with the line.

190
00:16:04,732 --> 00:16:08,402
<i>Giovane!</i> You! You, Carpino,
give him a hand with the torpedo.

191
00:16:10,696 --> 00:16:12,740
How many hands
you think I got, Neuman?

192
00:16:12,823 --> 00:16:16,452
Mr. Neuman to you.

193
00:16:20,206 --> 00:16:22,350
Now, make sure you give me
the reading on that battery.

194
00:16:22,374 --> 00:16:23,209
Right, Skipper.

195
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:26,337
Come on. Come on!

196
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,298
Bring it on, boys.
Bring it around! Come on!

197
00:16:29,381 --> 00:16:32,092
Hey! Come on now.
Easy now. Come on.

198
00:16:32,176 --> 00:16:34,553
Come on. Come on. All right, hold.

199
00:16:34,637 --> 00:16:37,515
All right, boys.
Make it fast to the cleats.

200
00:16:38,516 --> 00:16:41,727
Hey.

201
00:16:48,817 --> 00:16:51,946
- Don't you ever take a bath?
- Shut up.

202
00:16:52,029 --> 00:16:54,865
"Shut up."
Is that the extent of your vocabulary?

203
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:57,451
What'd you ever give up
the wrestling racket for anyway?

204
00:16:57,535 --> 00:17:00,496
I just found out it was phony.

205
00:17:00,579 --> 00:17:02,414
That's the trouble with these...

206
00:17:02,498 --> 00:17:04,684
I say, that's the trouble
with these phony wrestlers, Dugboat.

207
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:07,211
- They never take a bath.
- We do too.

208
00:17:13,092 --> 00:17:15,803
Hey, Joto. Hey, Joto.
The after valve won't turn.

209
00:17:15,886 --> 00:17:17,846
- What?
- The after valve won't turn.

210
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,848
No, no. The other way.

211
00:17:19,932 --> 00:17:23,310
Everything backwards. No wonder you blokes
lost the war, with subs like this.

212
00:17:24,603 --> 00:17:26,522
- Skipper.
- Yeah.

213
00:17:26,605 --> 00:17:29,483
- That guy Welles... any good?
- Best engineer out of Australia.

214
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:32,820
- Wish we had Wilbur.
- Yeah.

215
00:17:32,903 --> 00:17:35,739
With Charlie Wilbur handling
the engines on the <i>Bowfin,</i>

216
00:17:35,823 --> 00:17:37,741
there was nothing to worry about.

217
00:17:37,825 --> 00:17:40,494
Hear he's a three-striper now.

218
00:17:40,578 --> 00:17:42,496
Yeah, so I hear.

219
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,082
Skipper,
that number two scopes don't work.

220
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:47,686
- What's the matter with it?
- Can't get the rust out of it.

221
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,670
- How 'bout number one?
- Didn't check it.

222
00:17:49,753 --> 00:17:51,755
Lift her up, Holter.

223
00:17:56,802 --> 00:17:59,722
The professor topside
wants to see the captain.

224
00:17:59,805 --> 00:18:01,724
Send him down.

225
00:18:01,807 --> 00:18:04,310
He's part of the brass behind this setup.

226
00:18:04,393 --> 00:18:07,220
Now, if he looks familiar,
don't say anything. I'll explain later.

227
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:12,359
- Hello, Professor. Welcome aboard, sir.
- Captain.

228
00:18:12,443 --> 00:18:14,987
Well, we're trying to put
this sewer pipe together

229
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,531
with a little spit and a lot of sweat.

230
00:18:17,615 --> 00:18:20,159
- I guess we'll make it all right.
- Captain Jones.

231
00:18:20,242 --> 00:18:22,661
What's the matter?
Is there something wrong?

232
00:18:22,745 --> 00:18:27,082
I'm sorry to say we cannot permit
one of your crew to make this expedition.

233
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,376
What do you mean?
They were all handpicked.

234
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,378
- We cannot trust this one.
- Who?

235
00:18:31,462 --> 00:18:33,297
The torpedo man, Revnik.

236
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,299
Oh, one of the men you picked.

237
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:38,886
I could have told you that all the time.
A knothead.

238
00:18:38,969 --> 00:18:42,056
Did you screen all my men too?

239
00:18:42,139 --> 00:18:45,559
Very closely, including you.

240
00:18:45,643 --> 00:18:48,354
- Okay. I'll get rid of Revnik right away.
- Good.

241
00:18:48,437 --> 00:18:50,356
Holter, I want...

242
00:19:03,702 --> 00:19:06,330
She the replacement, Doc?

243
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:10,959
Gentlemen, this is Professor Gerard,
my assistant and my right arm.

244
00:19:11,043 --> 00:19:14,129
- Hiya.
- Denise, this is Captain Jones.

245
00:19:14,213 --> 00:19:17,007
- Captain Jones.
- Glad to know you, Professor.

246
00:19:17,091 --> 00:19:20,427
Well, if I'd known about this,
I'd have cut my price.

247
00:19:20,511 --> 00:19:23,389
Boys, these two professors
are going with us as cargo.

248
00:19:23,472 --> 00:19:25,391
- What?
- You heard me.

249
00:19:25,474 --> 00:19:28,519
Have you blown a gasket?
Nobody takes a female along in a pigboat.

250
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:32,022
Look, junior, you gonna give me
that 2,000-year-old navy bilge

251
00:19:32,106 --> 00:19:33,315
that they're bad luck?

252
00:19:33,399 --> 00:19:36,026
Take a look at her.
What's so bad about that?

253
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:39,321
Nothing. Absolutely nothing!

254
00:19:39,405 --> 00:19:42,533
They're all Jonahs. It's traditional.

255
00:19:45,994 --> 00:19:48,497
Look, Skipper, I made up my mind.
Count me out.

256
00:19:50,165 --> 00:19:52,376
Okay.

257
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:54,378
Anybody else?

258
00:19:55,879 --> 00:19:59,675
I'll give you jokers five minutes
to sleep on it, and remember,

259
00:19:59,758 --> 00:20:02,928
if I have to,
I can replace every one of you.

260
00:20:03,011 --> 00:20:05,556
Captain, I do not like it either.

261
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:19,820
Oh, <i>scusami.</i>

262
00:20:21,947 --> 00:20:23,907
Perhaps you are right.

263
00:20:23,991 --> 00:20:27,995
In your estimation,
I am a... a female.

264
00:20:28,078 --> 00:20:30,956
But first I am a scientist
and a good one.

265
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,710
And I am not the only scientist
who is not of your sex.

266
00:20:34,793 --> 00:20:36,837
There are many.

267
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,047
Like Dr. Lise Meitner,

268
00:20:39,131 --> 00:20:43,260
who played an important part
in the development of the atom bomb.

269
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:46,889
Like Madame Curie, who discovered radium.

270
00:20:46,972 --> 00:20:50,392
I have grown up in laboratories.

271
00:20:50,476 --> 00:20:53,187
All my life, I have worked with men.

272
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:55,939
Never have I interfered,

273
00:20:56,023 --> 00:20:58,358
and never have they resented me.

274
00:20:59,902 --> 00:21:04,615
Professor Montel and I have...
have much to accomplish.

275
00:21:04,698 --> 00:21:07,242
Much.

276
00:21:07,326 --> 00:21:09,995
And I shall appreciate it

277
00:21:10,078 --> 00:21:13,707
if you would not let my... my presence

278
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:16,794
be the cause of... of a minor mutiny.

279
00:21:32,601 --> 00:21:34,520
I like you.

280
00:21:35,521 --> 00:21:37,523
I like you all.

281
00:21:39,233 --> 00:21:42,152
And I shall try my best
to make you like me...

282
00:21:45,322 --> 00:21:47,324
as a scientist.

283
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,254
Man, that was quite a mouthful
for a female!

284
00:22:00,337 --> 00:22:03,924
That's no female. That's a scientist!

285
00:22:04,007 --> 00:22:06,677
All right. Come on.
We got a lot of work to do. Let's go.

286
00:22:13,892 --> 00:22:17,437
Hi, Mr. Fujimori, Professor.

287
00:22:17,521 --> 00:22:20,440
- Where's your assistant?
- Are you prepared to sail?

288
00:22:20,524 --> 00:22:23,318
I'll let you know tomorrow
after we make the running dive tests.

289
00:22:23,402 --> 00:22:25,320
There's no tomorrow left for us.

290
00:22:25,404 --> 00:22:27,966
The freighter <i>Kiang Ching</i>
sailed from Tientsin a half hour ago.

291
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:30,343
- You must leave right away.
- What are you talking about?

292
00:22:30,367 --> 00:22:34,621
We only been working for two weeks. We've
got a lot of work left to do on this tub.

293
00:22:34,705 --> 00:22:37,836
- You must leave by dark to overtake her.
- What about the running tests?

294
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:41,336
As an amateur, might I suggest
that we try the running test

295
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,338
while we are running?

296
00:22:43,422 --> 00:22:46,258
Doc, there are about a hundred ways
of losing a submarine.

297
00:22:46,341 --> 00:22:48,302
You've just come up with one of the best.

298
00:22:48,385 --> 00:22:50,387
We haven't even checked
the torpedo tubes yet.

299
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:54,016
You know what that means if we have
to call on fish? It means we're dead.

300
00:22:54,099 --> 00:22:56,101
You've got to leave tonight.

301
00:22:57,603 --> 00:23:00,647
Okay, buster, you're buying this trip.
You want me to chance it?

302
00:23:00,731 --> 00:23:03,525
It's not what we want, Captain Jones.
It's what must be done.

303
00:23:03,609 --> 00:23:07,255
All right. Just as long as the professor
here knows what he's letting himself in for.

304
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:10,008
We've arranged airplane contact to give you
position on the <i>Kiang Ching.</i>

305
00:23:10,032 --> 00:23:12,886
- How'll they contact us, blinker or radio?
- Neither is without risk.

306
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:15,871
We've decided cork drop is safest.

307
00:23:15,954 --> 00:23:18,624
This contains your code,

308
00:23:18,707 --> 00:23:21,209
and this contains
your schedule for contacts.

309
00:23:21,293 --> 00:23:23,670
Oh, just one more thing.

310
00:23:23,754 --> 00:23:28,091
I want a clear-cut directive
detailing my specific authority.

311
00:23:28,175 --> 00:23:30,552
You'll find it all in here, Captain.

312
00:23:30,636 --> 00:23:33,013
At sea, you are in complete command.

313
00:23:33,096 --> 00:23:36,683
On land, Professor Montel is in command.

314
00:23:36,767 --> 00:23:40,145
May I wish you the best of luck?

315
00:23:40,228 --> 00:23:42,147
Thanks.

316
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:13,220
Well, now's as good a time as any,
Mr. Neuman.

317
00:24:13,303 --> 00:24:16,181
- Take her down to periscope depth.
- Yes, sir.

318
00:24:16,264 --> 00:24:18,266
Clear the bridge!

319
00:24:20,978 --> 00:24:23,647
Dive!

320
00:24:36,118 --> 00:24:38,745
Stand right over there.
You'll be all right.

321
00:24:38,829 --> 00:24:42,416
- Thank you.
- Professor Gerard, give me your hand.

322
00:24:42,499 --> 00:24:45,585
Watch that top rung. It's murder.

323
00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:47,587
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

324
00:24:47,671 --> 00:24:49,589
You sit right here.

325
00:24:49,673 --> 00:24:51,675
Captain, trim satisfactory
at periscope depth.

326
00:24:51,758 --> 00:24:53,677
- Very well. Joto.
- Yes, sir?

327
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,489
Give Welles a hand with those starboard
engine blueprint translations, will you?

328
00:24:56,513 --> 00:24:58,432
I'll take care of it, Captain.

329
00:24:58,515 --> 00:25:00,726
Everything's tight
in the forward torpedo room.

330
00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:03,895
We're gonna try her down deep.
Have all stations checked. Let me know.

331
00:25:03,979 --> 00:25:06,273
<i>Ay, ay, Captain.</i>

332
00:25:06,356 --> 00:25:09,693
This is that test we were
talking about today, Professor.

333
00:25:09,776 --> 00:25:12,362
- Now?
- Now.

334
00:25:12,446 --> 00:25:16,116
Don't get nervous. If we crack up,
you won't get a chance to feel it.

335
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:18,118
Take it easy. It'll be all right.

336
00:25:18,201 --> 00:25:20,203
Put her on the bottom, Mr. Neuman.

337
00:25:20,287 --> 00:25:22,289
Two degrees down bubble.

338
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:26,126
- Flood negative.
- Flood negative.

339
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,844
Oh, thanks, Chin Lee.

340
00:25:35,927 --> 00:25:37,929
- Coffee, Professor?
- No, thanks.

341
00:25:38,013 --> 00:25:40,515
- How 'bout you?
- No, thank you.

342
00:25:47,981 --> 00:25:49,983
Two hundred feet, <i>Kapitän.</i>

343
00:26:00,827 --> 00:26:02,829
Better hold on, Professor.

344
00:26:32,692 --> 00:26:35,195
All right. Now let's see
if we can hit the roof.

345
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:38,031
- Take her up, Mr. Neuman.
- Close all main ballast vents.

346
00:26:38,115 --> 00:26:41,368
- Stand by to surface.
- Stand by to surface.

347
00:26:41,451 --> 00:26:43,411
- Surface.
- Surface.

348
00:26:46,832 --> 00:26:50,001
- Blow all main ballasts!
- Blow all main ballasts.

349
00:26:57,592 --> 00:26:59,594
What's with the air banks, Holter?

350
00:27:02,472 --> 00:27:03,515
The air bank's dry.

351
00:27:03,598 --> 00:27:06,143
Open the emergency banks.
Put 'em on the line.

352
00:27:07,686 --> 00:27:08,436
They won't open.

353
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,689
They've got to open.
We've checked everything.

354
00:27:10,772 --> 00:27:13,126
These signs are all fouled up.
I'll have to try every valve.

355
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,651
No, wait a minute.

356
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:18,446
Joto, come to the control room.
Unsnarl these Japanese signs.

357
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:21,992
I can translate it. That one reads,
"Open emergency air bank."

358
00:27:22,075 --> 00:27:25,412
- What?
- "Open emergency air bank."

359
00:27:25,495 --> 00:27:27,664
Go ahead. Try it.

360
00:27:32,377 --> 00:27:34,421
- Air bank's on the line.
- Good. Thanks.

361
00:27:34,504 --> 00:27:36,506
Okay. Put her on the roof.

362
00:27:48,393 --> 00:27:51,479
- Skipper.
- Yeah. Everything all right, Carpino?

363
00:27:51,563 --> 00:27:54,399
Just a few leaks around the
stuffing glands. I marked them.

364
00:27:54,482 --> 00:27:56,568
Okay. Make a full sweep, Ski.

365
00:27:57,485 --> 00:27:59,446
All clear, Skipper.

366
00:27:59,529 --> 00:28:02,115
Rig for red. Up scope.

367
00:28:02,199 --> 00:28:04,117
You better move out, Professor.

368
00:28:04,201 --> 00:28:07,537
This helps get our eyes
used to the dark when we go up.

369
00:28:17,631 --> 00:28:19,633
Open the hatch, Holter.

370
00:28:21,051 --> 00:28:24,221
You did a good job
translating that sign, Doc.

371
00:28:26,556 --> 00:28:28,475
Professor Gerard is MOL.

372
00:28:29,976 --> 00:28:32,896
- MOL?
- Master of Oriental Languages.

373
00:28:32,979 --> 00:28:36,399
Oh? <i>Très bon. Très bon.</i>

374
00:28:36,483 --> 00:28:38,401
Down scope.

375
00:28:41,154 --> 00:28:43,365
Glad to have you aboard, Professor.

376
00:28:45,075 --> 00:28:47,911
Glad to be aboard, Captain.

377
00:29:08,515 --> 00:29:13,019
Captain. The professor wants to know
if it's all right to come up for fresh air.

378
00:29:13,103 --> 00:29:15,522
- Which one?
- The one with the beard.

379
00:29:15,605 --> 00:29:18,775
Oh. Okay.

380
00:29:18,858 --> 00:29:21,861
Come to course 355,
ahead full on both engines.

381
00:29:21,945 --> 00:29:24,364
Ay, ay, Captain.

382
00:29:24,447 --> 00:29:27,450
You won't need your umbrella, Professor.
She's a dry boat.

383
00:29:28,785 --> 00:29:30,745
It's nothing to worry about.

384
00:29:30,829 --> 00:29:34,708
Almost everybody gets a touch
of claustrophobia first time down.

385
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:37,294
It's not claustrophobia, Captain.

386
00:29:37,377 --> 00:29:41,381
It's the realization that, at last,
our mission has begun.

387
00:29:42,674 --> 00:29:45,385
If anyone had told me six months ago

388
00:29:45,468 --> 00:29:48,888
that today I would be on a submarine
headed for arctic waters

389
00:29:48,972 --> 00:29:52,642
in search of a secret atomic base...

390
00:29:52,726 --> 00:29:55,228
- I just can't believe it.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

391
00:29:55,312 --> 00:29:57,314
Well...

392
00:29:57,856 --> 00:30:00,567
what about your assistant, Professor?

393
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:04,487
What makes a girl who looks like that
get mixed up in science?

394
00:30:04,571 --> 00:30:07,407
She comes from a family of scientists.

395
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:09,576
She was a child prodigy.

396
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:11,786
At 14, she entered college.

397
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:15,081
At 18, she studied at Göttingen.

398
00:30:15,165 --> 00:30:17,208
She is really very brilliant.

399
00:30:17,292 --> 00:30:21,504
A child prodigy
with a body by Fisher?

400
00:30:21,588 --> 00:30:26,051
And this is the greatest pigboat
in the whole submarine service.

401
00:30:26,134 --> 00:30:28,428
The USS <i>Bowfin.</i>

402
00:30:28,511 --> 00:30:30,764
It's one we served on together...

403
00:30:30,847 --> 00:30:34,225
me, the chief, Gunner,
Dugboat and the skipper.

404
00:30:34,309 --> 00:30:36,728
Beautiful, aingt she?

405
00:30:36,811 --> 00:30:39,189
Oh, yes. Very beautiful.

406
00:30:39,272 --> 00:30:42,233
You know something else
that's very beautiful?

407
00:30:42,317 --> 00:30:45,111
All my life I've been wanting
to find a girl called Denise.

408
00:30:45,195 --> 00:30:48,281
Oh, Ski,
I'm sure you will find her.

409
00:30:48,365 --> 00:30:50,450
Oh, I found her, all right.

410
00:30:50,533 --> 00:30:54,287
You see, I lost no time at all
in learning your first name.

411
00:30:54,371 --> 00:30:57,707
Yep. Denise. It's always been
my favorite name.

412
00:30:57,791 --> 00:30:59,751
I... I never met a Denise,

413
00:30:59,834 --> 00:31:01,795
but I always knew I would.

414
00:31:01,878 --> 00:31:06,174
You see, from the moment I saw you,
I said, "Lafayette, I'm here."

415
00:31:08,843 --> 00:31:11,846
That's right. I always knew
I'd meet a girl called Denise.

416
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:13,848
ID-E-N-I...

417
00:31:13,932 --> 00:31:15,934
Don't let him kid you, honey.

418
00:31:16,017 --> 00:31:18,937
I just seen him put your name on his arm.

419
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,481
- Look.
- All right, bub. You asked for it!

420
00:31:21,564 --> 00:31:23,650
No!

421
00:31:30,532 --> 00:31:33,076
Come here, you big drunkard!

422
00:31:46,923 --> 00:31:50,176
That's what I mean by Jonahs.
They were beefing over the dame.

423
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,637
Wasn't her fault. He's stiff.

424
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,722
- She okay?
- Yeah.

425
00:31:54,806 --> 00:31:56,808
Just roughed up a little.

426
00:31:56,891 --> 00:31:58,893
Take care of him, Holter.

427
00:31:58,977 --> 00:32:01,396
Oh, here, let me help you, Professor.

428
00:32:01,479 --> 00:32:04,649
- Thank you.
- Let's see.

429
00:32:04,732 --> 00:32:07,068
Boy.

430
00:32:07,152 --> 00:32:09,988
I'm really very sorry about this,
Professor.

431
00:32:10,071 --> 00:32:12,532
That drunk was a last-minute replacement.

432
00:32:12,615 --> 00:32:15,952
- He's all right when he's sober.
- I'm sorry.

433
00:32:16,035 --> 00:32:18,705
This is the last thing I...
I wanted to happen.

434
00:32:18,788 --> 00:32:22,542
It had to break out sooner or later.
Let's have another look here.

435
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:25,712
It's lucky you still got your teeth.

436
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,846
Don't get nervous, Doc.
Nobody's gonna bite you.

437
00:32:34,929 --> 00:32:39,476
Don't you think that the pharmacist
should treat me, if it's necessary?

438
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:42,187
He's got his hands full
with those two lugs.

439
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:46,733
Besides, there's nothing
he can do that I can't, you know.

440
00:32:46,816 --> 00:32:49,319
Oh, my. He got you so greasy.

441
00:32:53,156 --> 00:32:55,408
Okay.

442
00:32:55,492 --> 00:32:57,452
You know what a log is?

443
00:32:57,535 --> 00:32:59,913
- Yes.
- You do?

444
00:32:59,996 --> 00:33:04,250
Well, I'm supposed to keep a detailed
report of everything that happens.

445
00:33:04,334 --> 00:33:07,712
It's for Mr. Fujimori.

446
00:33:07,795 --> 00:33:10,590
How'd it start?

447
00:33:12,717 --> 00:33:15,094
I was working on a new formula

448
00:33:15,178 --> 00:33:18,765
when Ski asked if he
could show me his chest.

449
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,850
- Show you his chest?
- Yes.

450
00:33:20,934 --> 00:33:23,311
Oh.

451
00:33:23,394 --> 00:33:25,396
And then what?

452
00:33:26,856 --> 00:33:29,776
Then he removed his shirt.

453
00:33:29,859 --> 00:33:31,861
No kidding?

454
00:33:31,945 --> 00:33:35,156
- He wanted me to see his tattoo.
- Oh, no.

455
00:33:37,033 --> 00:33:39,285
- It was a beautiful tattoo.
- I'll bet it was.

456
00:33:39,369 --> 00:33:41,287
Beautiful.

457
00:33:41,371 --> 00:33:44,624
- But the intoxicated one rubbed it off.
- Naturally.

458
00:33:44,707 --> 00:33:47,710
Tell me, he make a pass at you?

459
00:33:49,212 --> 00:33:51,422
- A pass?
- Did he try to kiss you?

460
00:33:51,506 --> 00:33:54,133
Yes, he did.

461
00:33:54,217 --> 00:33:57,220
He did? Did you coldcock him?

462
00:33:59,764 --> 00:34:02,058
- What?
- Did you hit him?

463
00:34:02,141 --> 00:34:04,477
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

464
00:34:04,561 --> 00:34:07,981
Hold the phone. Hold the phone.
Now, say that in English.

465
00:34:08,064 --> 00:34:10,066
- I slapped him.
- You did?

466
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:12,318
Tell me,

467
00:34:12,402 --> 00:34:14,612
you hit him after he kissed you?

468
00:34:14,696 --> 00:34:17,532
- Yes.
- Not before?

469
00:34:21,244 --> 00:34:23,705
I do not understand.

470
00:34:23,788 --> 00:34:27,250
Well, you see, Professor, I just want
to make sure my report is factual.

471
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:29,252
- I couldn't put...
- Captain Jones.

472
00:34:29,335 --> 00:34:33,172
Is this report for Mr. Fujimori
or for you?

473
00:34:35,842 --> 00:34:40,013
Now, really, a child prodigy oughta
be able to figure that one out.

474
00:34:40,096 --> 00:34:42,181
Don't you think?

475
00:34:42,265 --> 00:34:44,183
- Yes.
- Yes.

476
00:34:48,438 --> 00:34:50,648
<i>Au revoir,</i> Professor.

477
00:34:59,616 --> 00:35:01,618
Now listen to me.

478
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:05,705
I don't want any more beefs,
you understand?

479
00:35:05,788 --> 00:35:08,249
If I hear of anybody
making a play for that girl,

480
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:11,711
I'll personally shoot him out
through torpedo tube number one.

481
00:35:11,794 --> 00:35:14,964
Captain, is it still a secret
where we're going?

482
00:35:15,048 --> 00:35:18,051
We're tailing a freighter
to an island in the North Pacific.

483
00:35:18,134 --> 00:35:20,053
Gonna sink her?

484
00:35:20,136 --> 00:35:22,889
We're gonna sneak into this island,
take a look and sneak out.

485
00:35:22,972 --> 00:35:24,891
This is a scientific expedition.

486
00:35:24,974 --> 00:35:28,895
- But, Skipper, what are we looking for?
- Four-leaf clovers.

487
00:35:28,978 --> 00:35:31,773
Well, what if the guys on the island
don't like us?

488
00:35:31,856 --> 00:35:35,193
Look, I know you're all
itching for a little action,

489
00:35:35,276 --> 00:35:38,655
but you'll only get it if we
have to defend ourselves, so relax.

490
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,718
<i>Capitaine Jones?</i>

491
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,519
<i>Le Capitaine Jones.</i>

492
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:25,451
<i>Bonne nuit.</i>

493
00:36:25,535 --> 00:36:27,495
<i>Bonne nuit.</i>

494
00:37:20,882 --> 00:37:23,801
Oh, good morning!

495
00:37:23,885 --> 00:37:26,739
- Was the water hot enough, Professor?
- Just wonderful, thank you.

496
00:37:26,763 --> 00:37:30,349
- <i>Voulez-vous "fume" une cigarette?</i>
- What?

497
00:37:30,433 --> 00:37:32,393
- I'm speaking French.
- Oh.

498
00:37:32,477 --> 00:37:34,812
<i>Voulez-vous "fume" une cigarette?</i>

499
00:37:34,896 --> 00:37:38,483
Oh, you mean <i>"Voulez-vous</i>
<i>fumer une cigarette</i>?"

500
00:37:38,566 --> 00:37:41,986
- That's what I said.
- No. <i>Fumer.</i>

501
00:37:42,069 --> 00:37:44,614
- Foo-may.
- No, no, no.

502
00:37:44,697 --> 00:37:47,200
You have to form your lips like this.

503
00:37:47,283 --> 00:37:50,036
<i>Fumer.</i>

504
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:52,038
<i>Fumer.</i>

505
00:37:53,581 --> 00:37:55,917
<i>Fumer.</i>

506
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,795
<i>Fumer.</i>

507
00:37:58,878 --> 00:38:02,757
I think I better go now.

508
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,676
Thank you.

509
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,514
You know, someday I'm gonna
find out what color her eyes are.

510
00:38:10,848 --> 00:38:13,684
Good morning, Captain Jones.
You wanted to see me?

511
00:38:13,768 --> 00:38:16,646
Why did you let me sleep
through that plane contact?

512
00:38:16,729 --> 00:38:21,526
I thought you needed the rest.
You were on duty for almost 20 hours.

513
00:38:21,609 --> 00:38:24,654
Didn't you stop to think
how important that message might be?

514
00:38:24,737 --> 00:38:26,656
Of course.

515
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:30,493
So I made sure that it was not
by decoding it myself.

516
00:38:31,702 --> 00:38:33,996
As you see,

517
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:38,668
it reports only that the <i>Kiang Ching</i>
has made no change in speed or course.

518
00:38:38,751 --> 00:38:40,920
I knew that was of no importance.

519
00:38:41,003 --> 00:38:43,464
Professor, did it ever occur to you

520
00:38:43,548 --> 00:38:46,050
that I might be steering a course to be...

521
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:50,888
You've lost us approximately two hours!

522
00:38:50,972 --> 00:38:53,558
I'm very sorry, Captain.

523
00:38:53,641 --> 00:38:56,811
- And I think I have learned something.
- I hope so.

524
00:39:10,616 --> 00:39:14,245
If you want to listen in on conversations,
use the intercom. It's easier.

525
00:39:14,328 --> 00:39:16,706
That conversation I would
prefer not to have heard.

526
00:39:16,789 --> 00:39:20,126
- But I was waiting to see you.
- Okay, you see me. I'm busy.

527
00:39:20,209 --> 00:39:22,795
Many years have I been
with Professor Montel,

528
00:39:22,879 --> 00:39:25,339
but never before have I heard
anyone speak like you

529
00:39:25,423 --> 00:39:27,425
to the greatest scientist in his field.

530
00:39:27,508 --> 00:39:31,304
Professor Montel's field isn't commanding
a screwball submarine. Mine is.

531
00:39:31,387 --> 00:39:33,389
If such rudeness is necessary,

532
00:39:33,472 --> 00:39:36,475
I hope this will be a very short cruise.

533
00:39:38,477 --> 00:39:41,814
What'd you want to see me about?

534
00:39:51,032 --> 00:39:52,950
- Joto.
<i>- Yes, sir?</i>

535
00:39:53,034 --> 00:39:55,995
In the future, when a message
comes in to this boat, I get it,

536
00:39:56,078 --> 00:39:58,789
no matter who says it's unnecessary,
you understand?

537
00:39:58,873 --> 00:40:00,791
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

538
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:04,545
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!

539
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:10,301
No, no, no, no.

540
00:40:10,384 --> 00:40:12,762
This time, he was right.

541
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:36,619
May we come on the bridge?

542
00:40:36,702 --> 00:40:38,704
Sure. Help yourself.

543
00:40:40,498 --> 00:40:42,792
Contact plane
approaching on schedule!

544
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:44,794
Good enough.

545
00:40:48,965 --> 00:40:50,883
Okay, Charlie.

546
00:40:58,307 --> 00:41:00,601
There it is!

547
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:22,039
Well, this one's for you, Doc.

548
00:41:22,123 --> 00:41:27,086
"Intelligence reports <i>Kiang Ching</i> carrying
unconventional-type 61 -♪ capsule."

549
00:41:27,169 --> 00:41:31,048
Signed, "Fujimori." What's a 61 -♪ capsule?

550
00:41:31,132 --> 00:41:33,092
The charge to explode an A-bomb.

551
00:41:33,175 --> 00:41:36,929
Hey, Skipper. Radar shows
surface object approaching,

552
00:41:37,013 --> 00:41:38,931
bearing 355 degrees.

553
00:41:39,015 --> 00:41:41,934
- Speed?
- Can't tell yet, but he's closing fast.

554
00:41:42,018 --> 00:41:44,729
- Range.
- 3,800 yards.

555
00:41:44,812 --> 00:41:47,606
Maybe the freighter has seen
our signal and comes after us.

556
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:48,690
Rig for red.

557
00:42:18,512 --> 00:42:20,556
A sub's after us.

558
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:23,976
A sub? I thought this was
a scientific expedition.

559
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,103
It is, and we're gonna play it safe.

560
00:42:26,187 --> 00:42:29,523
No use getting a bloody nose
unless we have to.

561
00:42:31,692 --> 00:42:34,153
She's submerged and listening for us.

562
00:42:34,236 --> 00:42:37,615
- That's why she stopped pinging.
- What does this mean?

563
00:42:37,698 --> 00:42:42,161
It means she's saving her torpedoes,
waiting till we surface.

564
00:42:42,244 --> 00:42:44,163
Just one more day, Doc,

565
00:42:44,246 --> 00:42:47,249
and we'd have finished
overhauling those torpedo tubes.

566
00:42:47,333 --> 00:42:49,502
Can you see her scope?

567
00:42:49,585 --> 00:42:51,879
No.

568
00:42:51,962 --> 00:42:53,964
Well, we can play possum too.

569
00:42:55,257 --> 00:42:58,803
- How's the hydrogen?
<i>- Built up to three percent.</i>

570
00:43:00,763 --> 00:43:03,766
Well, we can't chance surfacing here.
We've got to make a run for it.

571
00:43:03,849 --> 00:43:07,269
Professor, I think you'd both
better stay in your quarters.

572
00:43:07,353 --> 00:43:09,271
Down scope.

573
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,543
They're still on our stern, Skipper.

574
00:43:43,514 --> 00:43:47,351
- How's that hydrogen gas?
<i>- Four percent and still building.</i>

575
00:43:56,986 --> 00:44:00,322
Take her up!

576
00:44:09,165 --> 00:44:11,083
Okay, Charlie.

577
00:44:39,862 --> 00:44:42,156
You better keep off the bridge, Professor.

578
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:44,158
I'm not going up.

579
00:44:44,241 --> 00:44:49,079
The skipper'd blow his top if he even
found you here in the control room.

580
00:44:49,163 --> 00:44:52,166
- Sit down, Professor. Grab some air.
- Thank you.

581
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:57,296
Have you identified the submarine?

582
00:44:57,379 --> 00:45:00,007
No. We haven't even seen her yet.

583
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:02,885
They're topside trying to spot her now.

584
00:45:02,968 --> 00:45:05,721
No sign of her yet, Skipper.

585
00:45:05,804 --> 00:45:08,933
Sonar tells us she's not far.
Alert the gun crew.

586
00:45:09,016 --> 00:45:11,977
- What?
- I know. We're not looking for trouble.

587
00:45:12,061 --> 00:45:15,606
But we'd be fools
not to protect ourselves.

588
00:45:15,689 --> 00:45:17,608
Alert for battle stations!

589
00:45:17,691 --> 00:45:20,736
<i>Gun crew stand by to man the deck gun.</i>

590
00:45:23,489 --> 00:45:25,491
What about these torpedoes?

591
00:45:26,992 --> 00:45:30,829
You know those tubes haven't been checked.
Forget the torpedoes!

592
00:45:30,913 --> 00:45:34,041
- Where is she now, Joto?
- Range, 1,500.

593
00:45:34,124 --> 00:45:36,585
Either she's moving out,
or she's gonna surface.

594
00:45:39,672 --> 00:45:41,298
There she is, Skipper!

595
00:45:45,219 --> 00:45:47,137
They're coming out on deck.

596
00:45:47,221 --> 00:45:49,181
Ask them where we are, Charlie.

597
00:45:49,265 --> 00:45:51,517
- Why not man the five-incher now?
- No!

598
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:55,604
The minute they spot a crew near that gun,
they'll throw torpedoes at us.

599
00:46:00,776 --> 00:46:01,777
What are they saying?

600
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:04,530
They want to know who we are
and what we're doing here.

601
00:46:04,613 --> 00:46:08,701
Tell 'em we're a private scientific
expedition headed for the arctic.

602
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:17,209
They insist on boarding us.

603
00:46:17,293 --> 00:46:19,753
Well, keep stalling.
Tell 'em we don't understand.

604
00:46:19,837 --> 00:46:22,256
Ask them to repeat the message.

605
00:46:34,643 --> 00:46:38,188
Put one over our bow.
Keep asking them to repeat, Charlie.

606
00:46:40,899 --> 00:46:44,528
Turn our nose into her. Steer 001.

607
00:46:44,611 --> 00:46:47,573
And get ready to man that gun.

608
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:07,593
Keep clear of the lifeline!

609
00:47:16,143 --> 00:47:18,145
Right full rudder.

610
00:47:51,387 --> 00:47:53,263
Torpedo!

611
00:47:56,642 --> 00:47:58,560
Clear the deck! Clear the deck!

612
00:47:58,644 --> 00:48:00,437
Dive!

613
00:48:17,621 --> 00:48:19,623
Close the hatch!

614
00:48:27,172 --> 00:48:29,675
My hand! My hand!

615
00:48:31,135 --> 00:48:33,637
My hand!

616
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:37,808
- Give me a knife!
- No! No! No!

617
00:48:37,891 --> 00:48:40,018
- My hand!
- No!

618
00:48:40,102 --> 00:48:43,605
Here.

619
00:48:50,446 --> 00:48:52,698
- How is he? How is he?
- It's his thumb.

620
00:48:55,284 --> 00:48:57,244
All right. Get 'em all below.

621
00:48:57,327 --> 00:48:59,632
Hey, you guys! Come on up here!
Give me a hand, quick!

622
00:49:00,706 --> 00:49:02,541
We ship too much water. Can't hold her up.

623
00:49:02,624 --> 00:49:04,644
Get the angle off
and let her settle to the bottom.

624
00:49:04,668 --> 00:49:06,503
All back full.

625
00:49:18,682 --> 00:49:21,185
Enemy torpedo fired.

626
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:30,277
Number two fish
out of their basket.

627
00:49:56,845 --> 00:49:59,306
Secure all running machinery.
Remain silent.

628
00:49:59,389 --> 00:50:01,558
<i>Bilge pump motor's flooded, Skipper.</i>

629
00:50:01,642 --> 00:50:04,245
Form a bucket line.
Dump the water in the engine room bilges.

630
00:50:04,269 --> 00:50:08,357
That tub's laying for us, Skipper.
She's coming real close.

631
00:50:49,898 --> 00:50:51,525
I lost her.

632
00:50:52,442 --> 00:50:54,736
Nothing out of her now. No sound.

633
00:50:58,073 --> 00:51:00,534
What do you think, Skipper?

634
00:51:00,617 --> 00:51:03,954
I think she's pulling
the same trick we are.

635
00:51:21,513 --> 00:51:25,517
Now watch that salt water.
We don't want any chlorine gas in the boat.

636
00:51:38,572 --> 00:51:40,490
Hold it.

637
00:51:41,575 --> 00:51:44,536
Captain, this hot heat is killing us.

638
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:46,538
We got to turn on the fans.

639
00:51:46,622 --> 00:51:51,418
If they heard our fans, you wouldn't have
to worry about the heat killing you, boy.

640
00:51:51,501 --> 00:51:54,588
All right, I'll fill in the picture
for you quick.

641
00:51:54,671 --> 00:51:58,216
We got torpedoes, but our tubes
aren't in condition to fire 'em.

642
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:00,278
And the Red sub's parked
on the bottom like we are,

643
00:52:00,302 --> 00:52:03,138
waiting to pick us up on sonar.

644
00:52:03,221 --> 00:52:06,224
Once she does,
she'll throw more fish at us.

645
00:52:06,308 --> 00:52:11,271
So it's a question of who can hold out
longer without air... the Reds or us.

646
00:52:11,355 --> 00:52:16,109
If we break first, chances are
it'll be our last break.

647
00:52:17,402 --> 00:52:20,572
And we're loaded with hydrogen.

648
00:52:20,656 --> 00:52:23,158
We're liable to explode.

649
00:52:23,241 --> 00:52:25,911
But we got one thing in our favor.

650
00:52:25,994 --> 00:52:28,789
We can save oxygen by shutting up.

651
00:52:30,666 --> 00:52:32,084
That's all.

652
00:53:23,927 --> 00:53:25,887
Nothing?

653
00:53:26,888 --> 00:53:28,807
Nothing.

654
00:53:34,146 --> 00:53:36,148
We gotta save juice.

655
00:53:39,901 --> 00:53:42,154
Shift to red.

656
00:53:46,742 --> 00:53:48,869
Keep your ears open, Ski.

657
00:55:14,246 --> 00:55:18,416
I am sorry, Captain, for being so stupid.

658
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,961
That's all right. Save your breath.

659
00:55:21,044 --> 00:55:23,046
You had to use the knife.

660
00:55:24,339 --> 00:55:28,802
If you didn't close the hatch,
we would all be dead.

661
00:55:31,012 --> 00:55:33,056
You're beat.

662
00:55:33,139 --> 00:55:37,060
You better get back to your bunk
and take it easy. Come on.

663
00:56:50,258 --> 00:56:53,053
I want to tell you how...

664
00:56:53,136 --> 00:56:55,138
Don't talk.

665
00:57:30,548 --> 00:57:32,550
Skipper.

666
00:57:34,803 --> 00:57:36,972
He's in a bad way.

667
00:57:37,055 --> 00:57:41,601
I thought that hypo was gonna do the trick, but
he's suffering from shock and loss of blood.

668
00:57:44,562 --> 00:57:49,025
If he don't get some air right away, you're
gonna have only one professor for cargo.

669
00:57:55,949 --> 00:57:59,869
There's 50 grand in that bunk.

670
00:57:59,953 --> 00:58:02,998
Fifty grand is worth a little air.

671
00:58:07,293 --> 00:58:09,504
Joto, turn on the white lights.

672
00:58:25,311 --> 00:58:28,898
Boys, I'm gonna try a long shot.

673
00:58:28,982 --> 00:58:32,736
If her first couple of torpedoes
miss us, we got a chance.

674
00:58:32,819 --> 00:58:37,574
I'd rather pass out without air than have
a torpedo come plowing through us.

675
00:58:40,535 --> 00:58:44,873
Now when we start the pump,
we're liable to get a spark.

676
00:58:46,416 --> 00:58:49,961
Maybe it'll burn off the hydrogen,
maybe it won't.

677
00:58:50,045 --> 00:58:52,672
If it doesn't,

678
00:58:52,756 --> 00:58:56,176
we'll blow up so fast
you'll never feel it.

679
00:58:58,428 --> 00:59:00,722
Good luck to all of us.

680
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:19,657
- You got everything straight?
- Yes, sir.

681
00:59:35,090 --> 00:59:38,426
Now here's where we find out
if we've lived right.

682
01:00:13,461 --> 01:00:15,548
No more chance of explosion.
Pass the word along.

683
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:17,549
And build up the turns slowly.

684
01:00:17,632 --> 01:00:19,551
- Hold down the noise.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

685
01:00:19,634 --> 01:00:21,803
- All ahead one-third.
- Yes, sir.

686
01:00:21,886 --> 01:00:24,017
Take her up and level her
to 175 feet, Mr. Neuman.

687
01:00:24,097 --> 01:00:25,306
Yes, sir.

688
01:01:23,281 --> 01:01:25,366
She's speeded up, Skipper.

689
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:27,452
Bearing 240 degrees.

690
01:01:27,535 --> 01:01:29,454
Right full rudder! All ahead flank!

691
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:39,505
- Stand by to ram!
- Stand by to ram!

692
01:02:23,258 --> 01:02:27,178
Range 200, bearing 010 degrees.

693
01:02:27,262 --> 01:02:29,973
Left full rudder!
Take her down to 190 feet.

694
01:02:30,056 --> 01:02:32,016
- 190 feet.
- Stand by to ram!

695
01:03:15,518 --> 01:03:18,146
All back, emergency!
Blow all main ballasts!

696
01:03:59,312 --> 01:04:00,855
Captain!

697
01:04:04,776 --> 01:04:06,194
Captain!

698
01:04:42,522 --> 01:04:46,109
There you are.
Are you sure you're all right, Doc?

699
01:04:46,192 --> 01:04:48,820
- Yes, thank you.
- All right.

700
01:04:48,903 --> 01:04:51,697
Now take a good deep breath of fresh air.

701
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:14,679
Feel all right, Dugboat?

702
01:05:14,762 --> 01:05:18,266
Yeah. For a quiet scientific expedition,
I couldn't feel better.

703
01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:21,936
You look awful. Let me see your tongue.

704
01:06:14,614 --> 01:06:16,532
It all real cool, man.

705
01:06:22,330 --> 01:06:24,248
This are the end, Jackson.

706
01:06:56,364 --> 01:07:00,243
I'm learning French. You know,
like Chin Lee learned that American song.

707
01:07:00,326 --> 01:07:03,329
You're wasting your time, junior.

708
01:07:14,757 --> 01:07:17,176
- Hi.
- Hello.

709
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:20,388
Say, if that music disturbs you,
I could have it turned off.

710
01:07:20,471 --> 01:07:22,598
Oh, no. I... I love music.

711
01:07:22,682 --> 01:07:25,226
Oh. That?

712
01:07:25,309 --> 01:07:27,228
Well, how's the hand, Professor?

713
01:07:27,311 --> 01:07:29,313
Wonderful, Captain, as you see.

714
01:07:29,397 --> 01:07:31,107
Good. Glad to hear it.

715
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:33,901
- And how are you, Professor?
- I'm fine, thank you.

716
01:07:33,985 --> 01:07:36,487
- Swell. You know, when I...
<i>- Captain Jones!</i>

717
01:07:36,571 --> 01:07:38,465
<i>Come topside, please.
Freighter in sight of land.</i>

718
01:07:38,489 --> 01:07:39,615
Excuse me.

719
01:08:33,628 --> 01:08:35,796
<i>Bonne chance.</i>

720
01:09:04,325 --> 01:09:06,619
I don't understand.

721
01:09:06,702 --> 01:09:09,080
Our intelligence report
cannot be this wrong.

722
01:09:09,163 --> 01:09:11,666
All we are getting is a normal count.

723
01:09:11,749 --> 01:09:14,919
- You ought to be happy.
- Don't misunderstand.

724
01:09:15,002 --> 01:09:18,190
Nothing would please me more than
to know that our suspicions are unfounded.

725
01:09:18,214 --> 01:09:20,132
Then let's move out.

726
01:09:20,216 --> 01:09:24,720
There's nothing here but this two-bit
garrison and some beat-up storage tanks.

727
01:09:24,804 --> 01:09:27,682
It's a great pity I cannot talk to them.

728
01:09:27,765 --> 01:09:30,976
We are worlds apart.
But, after all, they are human.

729
01:09:43,989 --> 01:09:46,283
- Let's go.
- But Neuman.

730
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:48,327
Forget it. Shot right through the head.

731
01:09:48,411 --> 01:09:50,746
Let's get out of here.

732
01:09:54,625 --> 01:09:56,711
Ski, try to knock out that light!

733
01:10:50,222 --> 01:10:52,141
All right, come on! Let's get outta here!

734
01:10:54,602 --> 01:10:56,520
You yellow dogs!

735
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:51,909
Come on, Ski. Give me a hand.
Let's get him in the boat.

736
01:11:51,992 --> 01:11:54,954
You wanted to talk to one of these <i>humans.</i>
I got one for you.

737
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,842
Wet down your coats.

738
01:12:40,082 --> 01:12:42,626
Well, they must be combing
the whole area for us,

739
01:12:42,710 --> 01:12:45,170
but so far, nothing?

740
01:12:45,254 --> 01:12:47,172
Not even a seagull.

741
01:12:47,256 --> 01:12:51,468
Hey, Dugboat, you sure this jelly I'm
rubbing on my chest won't eat off my tattoo?

742
01:12:51,552 --> 01:12:53,697
What are you worried about?
You can always get another.

743
01:12:53,721 --> 01:12:57,641
Are you nuts?
That's my "piece be resistance."

744
01:12:57,725 --> 01:12:59,852
- Your piece be what?
- That's French.

745
01:12:59,935 --> 01:13:01,854
I been practicing, "nessie-pas?"

746
01:13:01,937 --> 01:13:05,357
You need more practice.

747
01:13:05,441 --> 01:13:09,320
<i>Captain Jones. Professor Montel
wants to see you in sick bay.</i>

748
01:13:14,825 --> 01:13:17,703
- Want more coffee?
- No. No, thank you, Chin Lee. Thank you.

749
01:13:17,786 --> 01:13:20,915
This is wonderful.

750
01:13:20,998 --> 01:13:23,334
- You want to see me, Professor?
- Yes.

751
01:13:23,417 --> 01:13:25,628
Denise has just translated his orders.

752
01:13:25,711 --> 01:13:30,841
His name is Sin. He's a pilot en route
to Kevlock Island for special duty.

753
01:13:30,925 --> 01:13:31,550
So what?

754
01:13:31,634 --> 01:13:34,261
Kevlock must be the island
Captain Taylor photographed.

755
01:13:34,345 --> 01:13:36,263
Well, how do you figure that?

756
01:13:36,347 --> 01:13:41,310
An air force pilot would hardly be assigned
to duty on an island without an airstrip.

757
01:13:41,393 --> 01:13:46,398
And as you know, Kevlock is the only island
indicated by name in this entire chain.

758
01:13:46,482 --> 01:13:49,902
It appears to be due north
of our present position.

759
01:13:50,945 --> 01:13:52,905
And what do you suggest we do about it?

760
01:13:52,988 --> 01:13:55,741
It seems to me our course is obvious.

761
01:13:55,824 --> 01:13:59,203
- Not in my book, Doc.
- What do you mean?

762
01:13:59,286 --> 01:14:03,791
I mean you said once that each man's
got his own reason for living

763
01:14:03,874 --> 01:14:06,377
and his own price for dying.

764
01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:08,587
Well, my reason for living is 50 grand.

765
01:14:08,671 --> 01:14:10,547
I'm not sticking my neck out again.

766
01:14:10,631 --> 01:14:14,301
- Is one neck that important, Captain?
- It is when it's mine.

767
01:14:14,385 --> 01:14:15,803
What kind of man are you?

768
01:14:15,886 --> 01:14:18,430
Hold it. Hold it.

769
01:14:18,514 --> 01:14:21,642
Let's not gang up
with a lot of double-talk.

770
01:14:21,725 --> 01:14:23,644
I'm a businessman.

771
01:14:23,727 --> 01:14:27,648
Maybe to a couple of flag-wavers like you,
I'm a mercenary. All right.

772
01:14:27,731 --> 01:14:30,609
But I lived up to my part of the contract.

773
01:14:30,693 --> 01:14:32,903
The deal was to tail
the freighter to the island,

774
01:14:32,987 --> 01:14:34,947
put you ashore and get you back to Tokyo.

775
01:14:35,030 --> 01:14:38,075
Nobody said anything
about a second island.

776
01:14:38,158 --> 01:14:41,912
So as far as I'm concerned,
mission completed. We're going home.

777
01:14:41,996 --> 01:14:43,956
Any objections?

778
01:14:47,543 --> 01:14:49,753
Yes.

779
01:14:49,837 --> 01:14:52,673
I hate to use authority,

780
01:14:52,756 --> 01:14:55,342
but if I have to, I will.

781
01:14:55,426 --> 01:14:57,511
I didn't want it to come to this.

782
01:14:58,846 --> 01:15:01,432
But as long as you have
mentioned the contract,

783
01:15:01,515 --> 01:15:03,517
study it closely, Captain.

784
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,854
You will find a paragraph stating that I,

785
01:15:06,937 --> 01:15:09,189
and I alone,

786
01:15:09,273 --> 01:15:12,693
shall determine when
the mission is finished.

787
01:15:12,776 --> 01:15:14,945
And in my book, Captain,

788
01:15:15,029 --> 01:15:19,450
the mission will be finished
after I am taken to Kevlock,

789
01:15:19,533 --> 01:15:22,453
given the chance to examine the island

790
01:15:22,536 --> 01:15:24,580
and returned to Tokyo.

791
01:15:31,045 --> 01:15:32,963
- Joto.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

792
01:15:33,047 --> 01:15:35,007
- Head due north.
<i>- Did you say north?</i>

793
01:15:35,090 --> 01:15:38,260
You heard me.
Set a new course for Kevlock Island.

794
01:15:38,343 --> 01:15:40,554
- It's on your chart.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

795
01:16:46,078 --> 01:16:48,080
Okay, Doc, let's go.

796
01:16:51,708 --> 01:16:54,461
What's the matter?

797
01:16:54,545 --> 01:16:56,463
My knee.

798
01:16:56,547 --> 01:16:59,174
- I thought you said it was okay this morning.
- It was.

799
01:16:59,258 --> 01:17:02,362
- I'll manage in a few moments.
- Not a chance. You'd just be in the way.

800
01:17:02,386 --> 01:17:04,864
- It will improve by tomorrow. I'm sure of it.
- Sorry, Doc.

801
01:17:04,888 --> 01:17:07,888
We're not hanging around these waters
that long. This is a powder keg.

802
01:17:20,612 --> 01:17:24,158
Wait. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What's
going on? What are you talking about?

803
01:17:26,827 --> 01:17:28,745
Captain Jones,

804
01:17:28,829 --> 01:17:31,999
my assistant will accompany you.

805
01:17:32,082 --> 01:17:32,916
What?

806
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,294
She has sufficient training
to compute figures,

807
01:17:35,377 --> 01:17:38,213
determine strength and identify elements

808
01:17:38,297 --> 01:17:40,257
if there are any on this island.

809
01:17:40,340 --> 01:17:42,259
You mean you'd... you'd let her go?

810
01:17:42,342 --> 01:17:44,136
With the exception of me,

811
01:17:44,219 --> 01:17:47,264
Professor Gerard
is the only member of this expedition

812
01:17:47,347 --> 01:17:49,308
capable of performing this task.

813
01:17:49,391 --> 01:17:52,728
- Oh, you're both crazy.
- You will take her ashore

814
01:17:52,811 --> 01:17:56,523
and follow her instructions
as you would have followed mine.

815
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:59,026
She is not going, and that's final.

816
01:17:59,109 --> 01:18:03,614
You still cannot take an order,
can you, Captain Jones?

817
01:18:03,697 --> 01:18:05,616
And what's behind that crack?

818
01:18:05,699 --> 01:18:07,659
Exactly what you think is behind it.

819
01:18:31,058 --> 01:18:33,018
Ski, you stay here. Keep your eyes open.

820
01:18:33,101 --> 01:18:35,020
What about her?
I could carry her equipment.

821
01:18:35,103 --> 01:18:37,231
She can take care of her own equipment.

822
01:19:40,961 --> 01:19:42,838
Take a look down there.

823
01:19:43,714 --> 01:19:45,841
Looks like a bunch of doors.

824
01:19:52,014 --> 01:19:54,725
I'm afraid we have found
what we are looking for.

825
01:20:15,162 --> 01:20:18,790
A Geiger counter reaction like this
can mean only one thing.

826
01:20:18,874 --> 01:20:21,668
These figures...

827
01:20:33,388 --> 01:20:35,599
What are they saying?

828
01:20:35,682 --> 01:20:39,394
They are looking for Lumfong,
a missing soldier.

829
01:20:44,858 --> 01:20:47,611
We gotta stay put
till they move out. Come on.

830
01:21:07,297 --> 01:21:11,134
What did you mean when you said
I still can't take an order?

831
01:21:11,218 --> 01:21:13,178
Your record, Captain.

832
01:21:13,261 --> 01:21:16,306
In the war you were a very good officer,
except for one thing.

833
01:21:16,390 --> 01:21:19,142
Go on. I'm fascinated.

834
01:21:19,226 --> 01:21:23,855
You could give orders,
but you couldn't take them.

835
01:21:25,065 --> 01:21:27,150
Now look, I...

836
01:21:27,234 --> 01:21:29,236
I know what you're talking about.

837
01:21:29,319 --> 01:21:31,696
But if you want to know
what makes a guy tick,

838
01:21:31,780 --> 01:21:33,657
you've got to look beyond the record.

839
01:21:33,740 --> 01:21:36,052
Those Philippine guerrillas
were cut off and surrounded.

840
01:21:36,076 --> 01:21:38,161
They had to have ammunition and supplies.

841
01:21:38,245 --> 01:21:41,289
I couldn't just sit there
on my can and let 'em die.

842
01:21:41,373 --> 01:21:43,166
I knew the waters were mined,

843
01:21:43,250 --> 01:21:46,670
but I figured I could get in,
get out without a scratch.

844
01:21:46,753 --> 01:21:48,755
So I wrote my own orders.

845
01:21:50,298 --> 01:21:53,927
I lost my sub and 26 men.

846
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:58,181
And if I had to, I'd do it again.

847
01:22:19,161 --> 01:22:20,662
I'm sorry...

848
01:22:21,788 --> 01:22:23,790
very sorry.

849
01:22:25,125 --> 01:22:27,836
It was wrong of me even to mention it.

850
01:22:29,296 --> 01:22:31,590
Forget it. It's all over.

851
01:22:42,309 --> 01:22:44,728
- You all right?
- Fine.

852
01:22:49,441 --> 01:22:53,653
When this is over, if we get back,

853
01:22:53,737 --> 01:22:55,697
what gives with you?

854
01:22:55,780 --> 01:23:00,285
- Gives?
- I mean, what are you gonna do?

855
01:23:00,368 --> 01:23:03,246
Go back to Paris, I suppose?

856
01:23:03,330 --> 01:23:05,624
- Paris is my home.
- Yeah.

857
01:23:08,001 --> 01:23:09,920
And you?

858
01:23:10,003 --> 01:23:13,006
When this is over, what gives with you?

859
01:23:13,089 --> 01:23:15,008
I don't know.

860
01:23:17,719 --> 01:23:20,263
Have you ever been in Paris?

861
01:23:20,347 --> 01:23:22,349
No, never.

862
01:23:23,517 --> 01:23:25,977
You would love it.

863
01:23:26,061 --> 01:23:28,355
Americans always do.

864
01:23:35,695 --> 01:23:38,198
Well, we can't stay here.

865
01:23:38,281 --> 01:23:41,409
If they hold us up till morning,
we might never get back.

866
01:23:42,786 --> 01:23:45,914
I'm gonna see if there's
another way out of here. Come on.

867
01:23:53,463 --> 01:23:56,007
You stay here. I'll be right back.

868
01:24:03,223 --> 01:24:05,141
Here.

869
01:24:05,225 --> 01:24:08,770
You won't need this, but sometimes
the sight of it's a comfort.

870
01:24:08,853 --> 01:24:10,855
I'll be back in a minute.

871
01:25:09,039 --> 01:25:10,957
Lumfong!

872
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:22,302
Lumfong!

873
01:26:14,562 --> 01:26:16,398
Denise!

874
01:26:18,983 --> 01:26:21,945
Give me that. Come on.
Let's get out of here.

875
01:26:26,157 --> 01:26:28,159
Come on.

876
01:26:38,378 --> 01:26:40,380
Hurry up. Come on.

877
01:26:51,391 --> 01:26:52,684
Come on.

878
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:56,020
Let's go.

879
01:27:32,932 --> 01:27:36,019
This confirms our worst fears.

880
01:27:36,102 --> 01:27:38,521
The atomic reaction is unmistakable.

881
01:27:38,605 --> 01:27:40,523
I don't get it.

882
01:27:40,607 --> 01:27:43,943
I mean, I can't figure out
why that bomber was on the runway.

883
01:27:44,027 --> 01:27:47,906
What would a B-29
be doing on a Red air base?

884
01:27:48,907 --> 01:27:50,909
It just doesn't make sense.

885
01:27:52,076 --> 01:27:54,204
Say, didn't you tell me
that that Red officer

886
01:27:54,287 --> 01:27:56,348
we picked up on the other island
was in the air force?

887
01:27:56,372 --> 01:27:57,582
Yes. A major.

888
01:27:57,665 --> 01:27:59,685
- Were you ever able to question him?
- Impossible.

889
01:27:59,709 --> 01:28:02,378
- I tried, but he would not say a word.
- Oh.

890
01:28:02,462 --> 01:28:04,380
Oh, thanks.

891
01:28:04,464 --> 01:28:06,725
Hey, did you talk to that
Chinese prisoner, Chin Lee?

892
01:28:13,181 --> 01:28:15,183
He has not seen the prisoner.

893
01:28:15,266 --> 01:28:18,061
The prisoner has not seen him.

894
01:28:18,144 --> 01:28:22,607
Holter, dig up that portable microphone
and plant it in the torpedo room.

895
01:28:22,690 --> 01:28:26,128
Then get the prisoner and lock him in there.
Make sure he doesn't see the microphone.

896
01:28:26,152 --> 01:28:28,071
- Right.
- Give him a hand, Ski.

897
01:28:28,154 --> 01:28:30,740
Come on. Let's get into some dry clothes.
We got work to do.

898
01:28:30,824 --> 01:28:33,743
- You have a plan?
- I'm gonna find out what this is all about.

899
01:28:33,827 --> 01:28:36,454
Come on, Chin Lee.
We got a job for you. Let's go.

900
01:28:39,958 --> 01:28:41,918
- You guys got everything set?
- Yep.

901
01:28:42,001 --> 01:28:43,920
Okay.

902
01:28:44,003 --> 01:28:47,298
Now, you're sure Chin Lee understands
exactly what he's supposed to say?

903
01:28:51,010 --> 01:28:54,430
- What'd he say?
- He says he would do anything for you.

904
01:28:58,852 --> 01:29:01,271
He wants you to strike him in the face

905
01:29:01,354 --> 01:29:03,398
to make it look more real.

906
01:29:06,109 --> 01:29:09,028
Holter.

907
01:29:10,196 --> 01:29:12,323
He wants you to do it.

908
01:29:13,366 --> 01:29:15,910
He says it will not hurt if you do it.

909
01:29:26,421 --> 01:29:29,173
You all right, boy? You okay?

910
01:29:30,174 --> 01:29:34,679
What's he saying?

911
01:29:35,722 --> 01:29:36,973
He says...

912
01:29:38,141 --> 01:29:42,520
the prisoner is very intelligent
and must be fooled.

913
01:29:49,110 --> 01:29:52,447
He wants you to hit him... harder.

914
01:30:00,246 --> 01:30:02,206
I'm sorry, pal.

915
01:30:09,505 --> 01:30:11,758
All right, get him out. Let's go.

916
01:30:18,806 --> 01:30:21,267
Here. Come on. Take 'em.

917
01:31:53,317 --> 01:31:55,236
This is incredible.

918
01:31:55,319 --> 01:31:57,780
What's it all about, Skipper?

919
01:31:57,864 --> 01:32:00,867
This is the screwball plot of all time.

920
01:32:00,950 --> 01:32:05,329
They're gonna drop an atomic bomb
on Korea or Manchuria and blame it on us.

921
01:32:07,874 --> 01:32:11,085
They're taking off tomorrow at dawn
in that made-over bomber.

922
01:32:22,847 --> 01:32:24,891
He found him out!

923
01:34:22,091 --> 01:34:24,093
Now listen to me.

924
01:34:27,180 --> 01:34:30,099
I'm shoving off for the island alone.

925
01:34:30,183 --> 01:34:34,020
I'll park myself right here,
around the mouth of this cave.

926
01:34:34,103 --> 01:34:37,398
You'll submerge half a mile
beyond the runway, right around here,

927
01:34:37,481 --> 01:34:40,276
so you'll be able to spot my signal.

928
01:34:40,359 --> 01:34:43,863
Now a heavy load of fuel's
gonna bring that bomber out low.

929
01:34:43,946 --> 01:34:47,450
So when I give you the signal...
two short, two long, two short...

930
01:34:47,533 --> 01:34:49,577
that'll mean the plane's taking off.

931
01:34:49,660 --> 01:34:53,039
That'll give you just time
enough to surface and fire.

932
01:34:55,124 --> 01:34:57,877
I want every gun in action.

933
01:34:57,960 --> 01:35:00,338
That means everybody.

934
01:35:00,421 --> 01:35:04,133
That plane has to be
knocked out of the sky.

935
01:35:04,217 --> 01:35:07,345
Now the minute you hit it,
crash dive to the bottom and stay there,

936
01:35:07,428 --> 01:35:11,265
because everything's gonna break loose
when that bomber hits.

937
01:35:11,349 --> 01:35:14,685
There's a cove at the north end,
right here. That's where I'll hide.

938
01:35:14,769 --> 01:35:17,372
Tomorrow night at 10:00 sharp,
I'll give you three short blinkers.

939
01:35:17,396 --> 01:35:19,315
Pick me up.

940
01:35:19,398 --> 01:35:23,569
If I don't show up,
shove off, head for home.

941
01:35:24,987 --> 01:35:26,989
Any questions?

942
01:35:28,282 --> 01:35:30,409
I forbid this insanity.

943
01:35:30,493 --> 01:35:33,537
Forbid all you want to, Professor.
That plane is not gonna make it.

944
01:35:33,621 --> 01:35:36,582
It is dreadful enough to bring back
the terrifying report

945
01:35:36,666 --> 01:35:39,835
that our suspicions are confirmed.

946
01:35:39,919 --> 01:35:44,382
But we cannot take it upon ourselves
to commit an act of war,

947
01:35:44,465 --> 01:35:46,842
no matter how we feel.

948
01:35:46,926 --> 01:35:49,387
We are civilians!

949
01:35:49,470 --> 01:35:52,598
I am responsible for this expedition.

950
01:35:52,682 --> 01:35:55,726
I order you to take this submarine
back to Tokyo!

951
01:35:55,810 --> 01:35:57,728
I don't care about you
and your expedition.

952
01:35:57,812 --> 01:36:00,707
There's an enemy bomber out there
made up to look like an American bomber.

953
01:36:00,731 --> 01:36:04,360
It's gonna drop the biggest egg in history,
and we're gonna take the rap for it.

954
01:36:04,443 --> 01:36:06,696
I don't like that.

955
01:36:06,779 --> 01:36:08,990
So from now on, Professor,

956
01:36:09,073 --> 01:36:11,409
this is my expedition.

957
01:36:24,046 --> 01:36:25,965
Skipper!

958
01:36:26,048 --> 01:36:27,967
The boat's gone!

959
01:36:28,050 --> 01:36:30,219
- What?
- The boat's gone. Montel took it.

960
01:36:30,303 --> 01:36:32,930
- Well, why didn't you stop him?
- We didn't get the chance.

961
01:36:33,014 --> 01:36:35,826
He was on deck with her. Before we knew
what happened, he was in the boat and gone.

962
01:36:35,850 --> 01:36:37,768
- Where's the girl?
- On the bridge.

963
01:36:44,150 --> 01:36:46,235
Please. He doesn't want you to stop him.

964
01:36:46,319 --> 01:36:48,738
Why didn't you stop him?
All you had to do was yell.

965
01:36:48,821 --> 01:36:51,699
He knows your plan.
He'll carry it out. That's his orders.

966
01:36:51,782 --> 01:36:54,261
That's the trouble with you geniuses...
full of big ideas.

967
01:36:54,327 --> 01:36:56,370
Now you're fouling up the whole works.

968
01:36:56,454 --> 01:36:59,749
- You know that island's crawling with soldiers.
- He knows that too.

969
01:36:59,832 --> 01:37:03,711
Then why'd you let a nice old guy like that
take a shortcut to the cemetery?

970
01:37:03,794 --> 01:37:05,796
He's no ordinary two-bit professor,
you know.

971
01:37:05,880 --> 01:37:08,007
He's Montel, top man in his field.

972
01:37:08,090 --> 01:37:11,028
But he's old and helpless... doesn't
know his way outside of a test tube.

973
01:37:11,052 --> 01:37:13,155
You oughta know that.
You work close enough with him.

974
01:37:13,179 --> 01:37:15,097
- What kind of a woman are you?
- Stop!

975
01:37:15,181 --> 01:37:17,183
- Haven't you got any feelings?
- Stop!

976
01:37:17,266 --> 01:37:19,185
He's my father.

977
01:37:20,978 --> 01:37:22,980
What?

978
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:26,359
My father.

979
01:37:27,693 --> 01:37:30,529
Oh, I'm sorry, Denise.

980
01:37:30,613 --> 01:37:32,698
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

981
01:37:32,782 --> 01:37:36,702
He said it was his place to go...

982
01:37:38,329 --> 01:37:40,331
not yours.

983
01:37:42,875 --> 01:37:44,877
I'm sorry.

984
01:37:54,261 --> 01:37:56,305
She's sure got a lot of guts.

985
01:37:56,389 --> 01:37:58,808
Only thing I can't figure out
is why the big mystery?

986
01:37:58,891 --> 01:38:01,018
Why didn't she let us know
he's her old man?

987
01:38:01,102 --> 01:38:05,272
Well, that's what you have to pay
for having a famous father.

988
01:38:05,356 --> 01:38:07,858
She's been on a spot all her life.

989
01:38:07,942 --> 01:38:11,487
Wanted to make good
on her own, and she did.

990
01:38:11,570 --> 01:38:13,906
And he was proud because she did.

991
01:38:22,665 --> 01:38:24,625
Any sign of him at all?

992
01:38:28,129 --> 01:38:30,923
No, not yet.

993
01:38:35,511 --> 01:38:37,471
There he is.

994
01:38:38,931 --> 01:38:40,933
And there's his signal.

995
01:38:43,352 --> 01:38:46,105
Battle surface! Gun action! Down scope!

996
01:38:46,188 --> 01:38:48,107
- You'd better get below.
- Please.

997
01:38:48,190 --> 01:38:49,191
Okay.

998
01:39:05,374 --> 01:39:07,710
All right, Ski. Let's go.

999
01:39:11,297 --> 01:39:14,133
Come on, Willie. Joto, get up here.

1000
01:39:27,646 --> 01:39:29,648
Hurry it up. Hurry it up.

1001
01:39:36,197 --> 01:39:37,865
Fire!

1002
01:40:58,904 --> 01:41:00,531
You all right?

1003
01:41:01,574 --> 01:41:04,243
- Oh.
- The bomb must have gone off under us.

1004
01:41:04,326 --> 01:41:06,245
Bring her back on course.

1005
01:41:06,328 --> 01:41:08,247
Take her up to periscope depth.

1006
01:41:08,330 --> 01:41:10,332
Periscope depth.

1007
01:41:14,253 --> 01:41:17,298
All compartments,
report damage and casualties.

1008
01:41:49,622 --> 01:41:52,124
The bomber didn't crash in the ocean.

1009
01:41:54,752 --> 01:41:56,879
It hit the island.

1010
01:42:38,295 --> 01:42:40,297
Head for home.

1011
01:42:48,013 --> 01:42:51,558
<i>Each man
has his own reason for living, Mr. Jones,</i>

1012
01:42:51,642 --> 01:42:54,019
<i>and his own price for dying.</i>
