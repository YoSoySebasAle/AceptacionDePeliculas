1
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,892
Yes, that's right. The whole court is in turmoil.

2
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,067
Couldn't have happened at a more inconvenient time.

3
00:01:52,155 --> 00:01:54,549
No, Dan doesn't know.

4
00:01:54,636 --> 00:01:57,160
That's why I'm calling you. I've got to get through to him right away.

5
00:01:57,247 --> 00:01:59,380
Just a moment.

6
00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:01,904
Excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice. This is the file you asked for.

7
00:02:03,427 --> 00:02:06,778
Thank God I caught you, Christine. Any idea where he went?

8
00:02:06,865 --> 00:02:08,432
What makes you think I'd know where he is?

9
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:09,868
Dan?

10
00:02:11,827 --> 00:02:13,002
Dan?

11
00:02:14,482 --> 00:02:16,223
No, he's not here.

12
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,876
I just walked through the door, CJ.

13
00:02:17,963 --> 00:02:19,878
Where have you been?

14
00:02:19,965 --> 00:02:21,837
Europe, as usual.

15
00:02:21,924 --> 00:02:23,926
Stanley left some instructions that involve Dan.

16
00:02:24,013 --> 00:02:25,710
And I've gotta find him.

17
00:02:25,797 --> 00:02:27,930
He surprised the hell out of me in Brussels.

18
00:02:28,017 --> 00:02:30,106
He sent me a postcard.

19
00:02:32,717 --> 00:02:36,721
The only part I can make out is "Dear Christine."

20
00:02:36,808 --> 00:02:40,029
At least I think that's "Dear." You know what his handwriting is like.

21
00:02:40,116 --> 00:02:43,815
Then there's something here about climbing a mountain.

22
00:02:43,902 --> 00:02:45,469
Did he happen to mention which mountain?

23
00:02:46,731 --> 00:02:48,777
See that peak straight ahead?

24
00:02:48,864 --> 00:02:50,822
That's where we'll be tomorrow at this time.

25
00:02:52,563 --> 00:02:55,436
Grab a couple of lungs full of this.

26
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:59,614
Pity the poor bastards in the cities who
don't get to taste real air anymore.

27
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:01,137
Can we take a rest?

28
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:02,704
Another 30 minutes.

29
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,358
I know a great place for lunch.

30
00:03:11,365 --> 00:03:13,149
Just hold on, I'm looking for it.

31
00:03:15,238 --> 00:03:16,892
"D. Snow." Would that be it?

32
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:19,024
CJ: That's it.

33
00:03:19,111 --> 00:03:22,332
Mr. Snow is a justice of the United States Supreme Court.

34
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:23,812
Do you have a number there where we could call you back?

35
00:03:23,899 --> 00:03:25,553
I do. I do indeed.

36
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,992
Area code 202, 252-3271.

37

Dan Snow here. Is that you, CJ?

47
00:04:43,021 --> 00:04:45,807
We need you back here, Dan.

48
00:04:45,894 --> 00:04:48,331
Couldn't hear that. Say it again, will you, CJ?

49
00:04:49,506 --> 00:04:51,247
Stanley Morehead died this morning.

50
00:04:54,859 --> 00:04:56,426
Are you still there, Dan?

51

I say Stanley Morehead died this morning.

00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:02,345
I'm still here. I heard you.

00:05:02,432 --> 00:05:04,042

Tell Alice I'm sorry.

00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:11,093
How fast can you get back here?

57
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,094

Hello? Hello Jeff?

You want me to try getting him again?

64
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,935
No, that's okay. We'll be getting downhill.

When Stanley left instructions that he wanted me to, uh,

73
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:08,455
what do you call it... Say a few words.

74
00:06:08,977 --> 00:06:09,978
I was surprised.

75
00:06:12,937 --> 00:06:17,246
Mr. Justice Morehead and I disagreed on a lot of things in our lifetimes,

76
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,727
and I guess it's only natural that we keep right on disagreeing.

77
00:06:24,253 --> 00:06:26,864
I know seven other men who could do this better,

78
00:06:26,951 --> 00:06:28,213
but I'm not about to file a dissenting opinion.

79
00:06:31,608 --> 00:06:35,830
Stanley Morehead was a gentleman of honest mind.

80
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:38,833
You can't say that about many men in this city

81
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,313
in this century.

82
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:45,709
Stanley and I were like a pair of flying buttresses.

83
00:06:45,796 --> 00:06:48,451
Leaning against opposite sides of a Gothic cathedral

84
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:50,018
we helped keep the roof from caving in.

85
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,848
If we'd both been on the same side all the time,

86
00:06:53,935 --> 00:06:56,590
we might have pushed the building over.

87
00:06:56,677 --> 00:06:58,200
You don't have to agree with a man in order to respect him.

88
00:07:03,335 --> 00:07:05,816
Stanley and I had one argument over and over again.

89
00:07:05,903 --> 00:07:06,861
I never won. I never could win.

90
00:07:08,732 --> 00:07:10,908
He used to ask me,

91
00:07:10,995 --> 00:07:16,000
"What in God's name is the practical use of mountain climbing?"

92
00:07:16,087 --> 00:07:18,873
One time I said to him,

93
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,399
"Well, on a mountaintop, maybe you're a little bit closer to God."

94
00:07:23,486 --> 00:07:25,836
He laughed and said, "Dan, what the hell do you know about God?"

95
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:32,190
I do know this.

96
00:07:32,277 --> 00:07:34,976
Mr. Justice Stanley Morehead is not in any box

97
00:07:35,063 --> 00:07:38,022
about to be covered by earth.

98
00:07:38,109 --> 00:07:40,721
He's at the top of a mountain higher than I have ever climbed.

00:07:50,687 --> 00:07:52,472

Of course you can come in. What the hell do you think you're here for?

When I was appointed to the Ninth Circuit,

362

00:30:47,933 --> 00:30:50,457
have been certified by the Chief Justice filed with the clerk

532
00:30:51,545 --> 00:30:54,156
and will not be announced orally.

533
00:30:54,243 --> 00:30:57,464
Probably the peak of every lawyer's career

534
00:30:57,551 --> 00:31:01,337
is that moment when he is presented and accredited to plead

535
00:31:01,424 --> 00:31:04,384
before the highest court in the land.

536
00:31:04,471 --> 00:31:08,779
Only lawyers ever plead in that hallowed chamber.

537
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:13,915
But today, all eyes are focused on the court's newest newcomer

538
00:31:14,002 --> 00:31:17,484
who has just received confirmation from the Senate of the United States.

539
00:31:19,051 --> 00:31:23,446
Court watchers will be fascinated in the weeks and months ahead

540
00:31:23,533 --> 00:31:26,362
by the figure in the leather chair farthest to the left

541

of the Chief Justice.

542
00:31:28,451 --> 00:31:30,105
How will this feminine presence

543

545
00:31:36,155 --> 00:31:37,678

551
00:31:54,956 --> 00:31:58,220
in its infinite and scholarly wisdom,

552
00:31:58,307 --> 00:32:02,442
to uphold exalted standards of morality

553
00:32:02,529 --> 00:32:06,663
which this lofty court so fervently advocates.

554
00:32:07,664 --> 00:32:11,625
And how rare it is to find judicial minds

555
00:32:11,712 --> 00:32:16,456
so attuned to the higher reaches of the spirit.

Madam Justice?

569
00:33:04,591 --> 00:33:07,724
I get the impression that the state of Nebraska

570
00:33:07,811 --> 00:33:10,423
would like to see this film confiscated, burned,

571
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:13,948
and the ashes sent into space. Is that the idea?

572
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:16,037
If the court so recommended.

573
00:33:16,124 --> 00:33:18,213
Is it your contention that the Constitution

574
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,346
gives this court any such power?

575
00:33:20,433 --> 00:33:23,566
This court is the judge of its own power.

576

Until we actually examine the film in question, I think that...

May it please the court.

578
00:33:28,702 --> 00:33:31,357
I respectfully submit that my client's rights under the First Amendment...

579
00:33:31,444 --> 00:33:33,968
Thee First Amendment doesn't give anybody the right

Crap's got the right to be crap.

711
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,155
Drop the legal language, Dan.

712
00:40:20,592 --> 00:40:22,202
Are you as Chief Justice

713
00:40:23,508 --> 00:40:26,511
suggesting that I disqualify myself from voting on Maloney?

714
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,298
No. I'm merely suggesting that, uh...

715
00:40:31,385 --> 00:40:32,517
It's been suggested.

716
00:40:34,954 --> 00:40:37,130
Where are you going?

717
00:40:37,217 --> 00:40:39,001
I've got a present for Madam Justice.

718
00:40:39,088 --> 00:40:40,176
Not roses.

719
00:40:41,743 --> 00:40:45,399
And have a look at US v. Albertson, 1954.

720
00:40:45,486 --> 00:40:48,489
It's in volume 348, US. Maybe 349.

721
00:40:52,188 --> 00:40:53,929
Is she in?

722
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:56,192
Oh, yes, sir, Mr. Justice Snow.

723
00:40:56,758 --> 00:40:58,151
[INTERCOM BUZZING]

724
00:40:58,238 --> 00:41:01,807
Uh, just hold on a second. Yes?

725
00:41:01,894 --> 00:41:04,157
ROBINSON: Madam Justice, Mr. Justice Snow would like to see you.

726
00:41:05,245 --> 00:41:07,116
He would. When?

727
00:41:07,203 --> 00:41:08,161
He's here.

728
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,559
Just check those references. I'll get back to you. Thank you.

729
00:41:17,953 --> 00:41:21,217
Tell Mr. Justice Snow I'll be happy to see him in a minute.

730
00:41:21,304 --> 00:41:22,654
She'll be happy to see you in a moment, Mr. Justice.

731
00:41:22,741 --> 00:41:23,568
Thank you.

732
00:41:52,422 --> 00:41:54,294
Ask Mr. Justice Snow to come in, Mr. Robinson.

733
00:41:56,905 --> 00:41:58,167
You may go in, Mr. Justice.

734
00:41:58,254 --> 00:41:59,342
Thank you.

735
00:42:04,347 --> 00:42:08,264
No, no. Please, please. Don't get up, don't get up.

736
00:42:08,351 --> 00:42:12,181
You' d stand, Mr. Justice, if I came to call on you in chambers.

737
00:42:12,268 --> 00:42:14,444
Oh, I wouldn't be too sure about that. [CHUCKLES]

738
00:42:16,316 --> 00:42:18,666
I can't tell you how grateful I am to you for seeing me like this.

739
00:42:18,753 --> 00:42:20,973
On no notice whatsoever.

740
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,017
It's my honor. Is it?

741
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,238
Well, I suppose it is.

742
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,675
Say ...

743
00:42:27,762 --> 00:42:28,807
That's quite a desk.

744
00:42:28,894 --> 00:42:30,722
And so neat.

745
00:42:30,809 --> 00:42:32,680
Do aircraft land here frequently?

746
00:42:35,248 --> 00:42:36,815
What is it that you wanted to see me about?

747
00:42:37,685 --> 00:42:38,643
Nothing earthshaking.

748
00:42:40,949 --> 00:42:43,561
By George, I was a little startled to see

749
00:42:43,648 --> 00:42:46,302
that you've got a male law clerk out there.

750
00:42:46,389 --> 00:42:49,349
Mr. Robinson? He's not my law clerk. He's my secretary.

751
00:42:49,436 --> 00:42:52,526
Well. Well, well, well.

752
00:42:52,613 --> 00:42:53,875
What a generous gesture.

753
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,443
Letting men into a field

754
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:58,532
previously dominated by the other sex.

755
00:42:59,968 --> 00:43:01,317
I'm glad you're in favor of men's lib.

756
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:03,624
Say, let's relax.

757
00:43:04,451 --> 00:43:05,800
Do you feel like relaxing?

758
00:43:12,981 --> 00:43:14,896
Madam Justice,

759
00:43:14,983 --> 00:43:17,159
I hope you aren't finding our national capital too dull

760
00:43:17,246 --> 00:43:18,857
after the grandeur of Disneyland.

761
00:43:20,641 --> 00:43:22,425
You don't think much of California, do you?

762
00:43:23,252 --> 00:43:24,123
I try not to think of it at all.

763
00:43:25,907 --> 00:43:28,431
Why don't you try climbing some our mountains?

764
00:43:28,518 --> 00:43:31,043
Oh, I have, I have. I admire your mountains.

765
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:32,610
It 's your valleys that make me nervous.

766
00:43:35,917 --> 00:43:37,527
Now, Madam Justice,

767
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,226
I would like your opinion on a point of law

768
00:43:40,313 --> 00:43:43,446
concerning that great American art form, the motion picture.

769
00:43:47,363 --> 00:43:48,451
Help yourself.

770
00:43:49,061 --> 00:43:49,888
Oh, thank you.

771
00:43:52,151 --> 00:43:54,849
Now, I was wondering if by any chance

772
00:43:54,936 --> 00:43:57,025
you'd seen a film called, um...

773
00:43:58,461 --> 00:43:59,637
The Naked Nymphomaniac.

774
00:44:01,464 --> 00:44:02,422
That's the one.

775
00:44:04,554 --> 00:44:06,426
Now you probably didn't even notice I wasn't there.

776
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:08,733
I noticed.

777
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:09,777
Oh, you did? Mmm.

778
00:44:10,735 --> 00:44:11,823
Well...

779
00:44:12,562 --> 00:44:13,520
Well...

780
00:44:15,043 --> 00:44:17,045
I wonder if you found anything,

781
00:44:18,177 --> 00:44:19,961
uh, unpleasant in the picture.

782
00:44:21,571 --> 00:44:23,225
First of all,

783
00:44:23,312 --> 00:44:25,793
I see no reason to overturn the lower court.

784
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,101
Anyone who'd seen that film would
realize that The Naked Nymphomaniac

785
00:44:29,188 --> 00:44:31,103
is a total offense against the public sensibility.

786
00:44:32,539 --> 00:44:35,716
It's sickening, degrading, disgusting.

787
00:44:35,803 --> 00:44:37,936
My, my, my, my, my, my.

788
00:44:39,459 --> 00:44:40,503
As bad as all that?

789
00:44:43,985 --> 00:44:45,813
Now, I wonder if you can put your finger

790
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,207
on exactly what it was that offended you?

791
00:44:48,294 --> 00:44:51,819
Was it the title? Some particular word in the title.

792
00:44:51,906 --> 00:44:53,516
"Naked", is that it?

793
00:44:53,603 --> 00:44:55,040
What if they called it

794
00:44:55,127 --> 00:44:59,609
The Fully-Clothed Nymphomaniac?

795
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,960
Or maybe it was the other word that bothered you.

796
00:45:02,047 --> 00:45:05,311
"Nym-pho-maniac."

797
00:45:05,398 --> 00:45:07,835
Supposing they called it The Naked Methodist,

798
00:45:07,922 --> 00:45:10,011
or Naked Daughter of the American Revolution?

799
00:45:11,143 --> 00:45:13,449
Are you finished?

800
00:45:13,536 --> 00:45:17,671
Madam Justice, I am a long way from being finished,

801
00:45:17,758 --> 00:45:20,282
but I' ll pause briefly in case there's something you'd like to say.

802
00:45:21,675 --> 00:45:22,589
Thank you.

803
00:45:30,379 --> 00:45:32,120
Let me ask you something.

804
00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:35,558
Would you call a female governor a governess?

805
00:45:36,908 --> 00:45:39,040
Is a woman composer a composeress?

806
00:45:39,127 --> 00:45:41,782
No. And her sex is entirely beside the point.

807
00:45:41,869 --> 00:45:43,828
And a justice of the Supreme Court

808
00:45:43,915 --> 00:45:46,091
is a justice, not "Madam Justess."

809
00:45:50,138 --> 00:45:54,447
Now, Mr. Justice, I submit that we are failing in our duty on this court

810
00:45:54,534 --> 00:45:57,145
if we don't try to stop the avalanche of prurient slop...

811
00:45:57,232 --> 00:45:58,973
Madam, if you'll... I'm not finished.

812
00:46:00,714 --> 00:46:03,586
Which is about to bury us.

813
00:46:03,673 --> 00:46:06,024
Are we doing our job if we permit anything?

814
00:46:06,111 --> 00:46:07,677
What are we permitting?

815
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,244
Violence in the streets.

816
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:11,029
Kids on drugs.

817
00:46:11,116 --> 00:46:13,074
Filth. Pornography.

818
00:46:13,161 --> 00:46:15,294
Who slaps the labels on? You? Me?

819
00:46:15,381 --> 00:46:17,600
Somebody better. No, thank you, ma'am.

820
00:46:17,687 --> 00:46:20,386
I think it's unconstitutional to set myself up as a censor.

821
00:46:20,473 --> 00:46:23,476
Refusing to look at something is censorship.

822
00:46:23,563 --> 00:46:25,695
Hell, I don't look at television, that doesn't make it illegal.

823
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,741
That's not the point.

824
00:46:27,828 --> 00:46:31,310
Seeing that film is material to making a judgment.

825
00:46:31,397 --> 00:46:34,617
If you' d spent 10 minutes in that screening room. Five minutes.

826
00:46:34,704 --> 00:46:37,620
You would see how obscene, how outrageous...

827
00:46:37,707 --> 00:46:41,276
Censorship is an outrage.

828
00:46:41,363 --> 00:46:44,149
What about a training film for terrorists?

829
00:46:44,236 --> 00:46:46,978
A free lecture. How To Make a Nuclear Bomb in Your Basement.

830
00:46:48,022 --> 00:46:49,502
Do you condone inciting to violence?

831
00:46:49,589 --> 00:46:51,156
No, ma'am.

832
00:46:51,243 --> 00:46:52,374
What about inciting to decadence?

833
00:46:52,897 --> 00:46:54,289
Define decay.

834
00:46:54,376 --> 00:46:55,682
That's what we're here for.

835
00:46:55,769 --> 00:46:56,988
Not me.

836
00:46:57,075 --> 00:46:59,381
We'd better try.

837
00:46:59,468 --> 00:47:03,908
The people of this country have only
one absolute protection against chaos.

838
00:47:03,995 --> 00:47:06,127
The law.

839
00:47:06,214 --> 00:47:08,521
And you and I were appointed to this court for only one reason,

840
00:47:08,608 --> 00:47:11,263
to uphold and sustain that law.

841
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:14,657
Watch out. You can't turn the law into a straitjacket.

842
00:47:14,744 --> 00:47:16,834
The law's gotta be a suit of clothes a man can wear.

843
00:47:16,921 --> 00:47:19,184
It's gotta fit easy, be comfortable.

844
00:47:19,271 --> 00:47:22,927
Law shouldn't strap a man in at the throat, or the brain, or the crotch.

845
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:25,886
That's vivid.

846
00:47:25,973 --> 00:47:27,583
Do you know what you're doing?

847
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:28,976
You're making Maloney more important than the law.

848
00:47:29,063 --> 00:47:30,717
He is more important than the law!

849
00:47:30,804 --> 00:47:34,242
This court doesn't try men. We put their trials on trial.

850
00:47:34,329 --> 00:47:37,071
That's it. We're constantly examining the witness who isn't there.

851
00:47:37,158 --> 00:47:40,770
All we ever get to see are lawyers, cold records, cold briefs.

852
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:43,034
Where's the human being? Where's the pain? We've gotta touch flesh.

853
00:47:44,644 --> 00:47:46,428
I'll tell you where the pain is.

854
00:47:46,515 --> 00:47:49,170
It 's in the people who get hurt.

855
00:47:49,257 --> 00:47:51,564
The innocent little kid who sits in the dark theater while Maloney's filth

856
00:47:51,651 --> 00:47:53,305
pours over him.

857
00:47:53,392 --> 00:47:54,697
That's where the pain is.

858
00:47:54,784 --> 00:47:55,960
You're on the right track.

859
00:47:57,744 --> 00:48:00,181
You're beginning to look at people.

860
00:48:00,268 --> 00:48:02,923
And when you let a little more humanity into your thinking,

861
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:04,403
you might make a damn good justice.

862
00:48:05,056 --> 00:48:06,448
But I won't bet on it.

863
00:48:10,322 --> 00:48:11,540
You're just being sweet to me because I'm a woman.

864
00:48:22,725 --> 00:48:24,118
Do I have any appointments this afternoon?

865
00:48:24,205 --> 00:48:25,641
3:15. Miller, securi...

866
00:48:25,728 --> 00:48:26,860
Cancel it.

867
00:48:36,304 --> 00:48:38,393
Mrs. Stowe just called.

868
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,221
Call her back, tell her I can't talk to her.

869
00:48:40,308 --> 00:48:41,570
And blow your nose, please.

870
00:48:43,398 --> 00:48:45,096
I don't wanna talk to anybody. I gotta work, I gotta concentrate.

871
00:48:45,183 --> 00:48:45,923
Yes, sir.

872
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,279
He says he doesn't want to...

873
00:48:54,366 --> 00:48:56,629
I wouldn't dream of disturbing Justice Snow.

874
00:48:56,716 --> 00:48:59,414
I'm looking for Herbert G. Maloney.

875
00:48:59,501 --> 00:49:01,721
Film producer. Oh...

876
00:49:02,417 --> 00:49:03,636
There you are, Mr. Maloney.

877
00:49:03,723 --> 00:49:05,029
What?

878
00:49:05,116 --> 00:49:06,900
A respected colleague of mine,

879
00:49:06,987 --> 00:49:09,337
Mr. Justice Snow, feels that this court

880
00:49:09,424 --> 00:49:11,949
is doing you a great injustice

881
00:49:12,036 --> 00:49:13,689
by not meeting you face-to-face.

882
00:49:13,776 --> 00:49:15,735
We ought to hear your voice,

883
00:49:15,822 --> 00:49:17,650
bask in your personality.

884
00:49:17,737 --> 00:49:18,868
What was the expression he used?

885
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,870
Oh, yes, we should "touch flesh."

886
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,351
Mason, call the guard.

887
00:49:23,438 --> 00:49:25,092
Don't go, Mason.

888
00:49:25,179 --> 00:49:26,224
This might be quite educational for all of us.

889
00:49:27,921 --> 00:49:29,270
Would you care to take the witness stand,

890
00:49:29,357 --> 00:49:30,402
Mr. Maloney?

891
00:49:35,494 --> 00:49:36,843
Going to swear me in?

892
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:37,670
Going to lie to me?

893
00:49:39,759 --> 00:49:42,022
Maybe you better swear me in.

894
00:49:42,109 --> 00:49:44,633
I, Herbert G.
Maloney, do solemnly swear the testimony I am about to give

895
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,113
to be the truth, the whole truth,

896
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:46,766
and nothing but the truth, so help me Loomis.

897
00:49:56,384 --> 00:49:58,299
Let's get right to the point, Mr. Maloney.

898
00:49:58,386 --> 00:50:00,345
Are you aware that you broke a law?

899
00:50:00,432 --> 00:50:02,216
No, ma'am.

900
00:50:02,303 --> 00:50:04,305
You didn't realize that the State of Nebraska

901
00:50:04,392 --> 00:50:06,481
has statutes prohibiting pornography?

902
00:50:06,568 --> 00:50:09,441
Doesn't the First Amendment apply to guys like me?

903
00:50:09,528 --> 00:50:12,574
Isn't it an umbrella that's supposed to keep all of us from getting wet?

904
00:50:12,661 --> 00:50:15,708
Or is there a hole in it over Nebraska?

905
00:50:15,795 --> 00:50:17,710
But the people of Nebraska have the freedom

906
00:50:17,797 --> 00:50:21,018
to protect themselves against your abuse of their freedom.

907
00:50:21,105 --> 00:50:22,497
That's what this case is all about.

908
00:50:23,411 --> 00:50:26,545
Look, lady, I'm a businessman,

909
00:50:26,632 --> 00:50:28,329
a n d I don't see where the government's got any business

910
00:50:28,416 --> 00:50:30,114
telling me how to run my business.

911
00:50:31,289 --> 00:50:33,552
Oh, I'm relieved.

912
00:50:33,639 --> 00:50:35,641
For a while, I thought you might be thinking of yourself as an artist.

913
00:50:36,816 --> 00:50:39,601
I do recall the word "art"

914
00:50:39,688 --> 00:50:41,212
plastered across your film.

915
00:50:43,866 --> 00:50:45,303
Tell me, Mr. Maloney,

916
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:47,044
do you honestly believe

917
00:50:47,131 --> 00:50:50,090
The Naked Nymphomaniac is art?

918
00:50:50,177 --> 00:50:53,311
Sure, why not? Who's to say it isn't? What's art anyway?

919
00:50:53,398 --> 00:50:55,008
Artists don't even know, let alone lawyers.

920
00:50:56,966 --> 00:50:59,099
Exactly what was your motivation

921
00:50:59,186 --> 00:51:00,927
in filming The Naked Nymphomaniac?

922
00:51:01,014 --> 00:51:03,060
Money.

923
00:51:03,147 --> 00:51:04,757
You can't have much pursuit of happiness in this country

924
00:51:04,844 --> 00:51:06,280
unless you pursue a little money.

925
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:09,457
Anything unconstitutional about that?

926
00:51:09,544 --> 00:51:12,025
Does the Constitution give you the right to do anything for money?

927
00:51:12,112 --> 00:51:14,027
Does it give you the right to shove me into bankruptcy?

928
00:51:15,376 --> 00:51:18,162
The lawmakers of Nebraska want to stop the pollution

929
00:51:18,249 --> 00:51:19,989
of the minds and morals of the public.

930
00:51:20,642 --> 00:51:23,167
By films like yours.

931
00:51:23,254 --> 00:51:25,430
My colleague on this bench, Mr. Justice Snow...

932
00:51:25,517 --> 00:51:27,736
Fine man. Know him very well.

933
00:51:27,823 --> 00:51:30,261
He feels very strongly about profit-pursuing

934
00:51:30,348 --> 00:51:32,001
conglomerates which pollute the air.

935
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,612
Air is different. You've got to breathe.

936
00:51:33,699 --> 00:51:35,831
You don't have to go to the movies.

937
00:51:35,918 --> 00:51:39,270
State and local governments have a right to set community standards.

938
00:51:39,357 --> 00:51:41,794
People can say, "I don't want this kind of thing in my neighborhood."

939
00:51:41,881 --> 00:51:43,883
Is it okay for people to say,

940
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:47,104
"We don't want any Baptists in our neighborhood, damn it"?

941
00:51:47,191 --> 00:51:51,151
Your film, it's called an exploitation film, is that correct?

942
00:51:51,238 --> 00:51:53,240
Right, and you're keeping me from exploiting it.

943
00:51:53,327 --> 00:51:55,155
Aren't you exploiting women,

944
00:51:55,242 --> 00:51:57,766
the act of love?

945
00:51:57,853 --> 00:52:00,247
Giving a distorted picture of sex to young people?

946
00:52:00,334 --> 00:52:01,509
Who am I hurting?

947
00:52:01,596 --> 00:52:03,990
I'm not talking about bodily harm.

948
00:52:04,077 --> 00:52:06,906
Has anyone died from seeing The Naked Nymphomaniac?

949
00:52:06,993 --> 00:52:08,299
What about injury to the spirit?

950
00:52:08,386 --> 00:52:10,692
Doesn't your celluloid poison

951
00:52:10,779 --> 00:52:14,218
attack all human dignity and decency and beauty?

952
00:52:14,305 --> 00:52:16,611
I don't think you like my picture.

953
00:52:16,698 --> 00:52:20,006
I think somebody had better set some standards,

954
00:52:20,093 --> 00:52:24,141
some voice had better say, "This far and no farther."

955
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:28,014
You're talking like a woman, not a justice.

956
00:52:28,101 --> 00:52:30,234
You 're talking like a justice, not a witness. Sit down, Maloney.

957
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,413
Have you been to New York lately?

958
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,807
Times Square, 44th, 45th Street?

959
00:52:39,808 --> 00:52:42,028
It used to be a decent place to visit.

960
00:52:42,115 --> 00:52:44,117
Unforgettable music, powerful plays.

961
00:52:47,338 --> 00:52:49,775
Today, right around the corner on 8th Avenue,

962
00:52:49,862 --> 00:52:51,733
your picture's probably playing

963
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:53,909
alongside a lot of other pornography and filth.

964
00:52:53,996 --> 00:52:56,173
Watch out, lady.

965
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:59,001
Scratch me, put me out of business, and who else gets scratched?

966
00:52:59,088 --> 00:53:01,439
The same end of the eraser can wipe out

967
00:53:01,526 --> 00:53:04,181
your unforgettable music and your powerful plays.

968
00:53:04,833 --> 00:53:06,531
You're sharp, Maloney.

969
00:53:06,618 --> 00:53:08,707
You pull every sleeve inside out.

970
00:53:08,794 --> 00:53:11,100
You want the liberty to dirty up my liberty,

971
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:13,712
my security against

972
00:53:13,799 --> 00:53:17,455
the profiteering two-legged cockroaches of this world,

973
00:53:17,542 --> 00:53:21,894
my right to live in a sweet and decent
society and not some kind of sewer.

974
00:53:21,981 --> 00:53:26,290
Even in New York you have to clean up
after your dog shits on the sidewalk,

975
00:53:26,377 --> 00:53:28,596
and it's a perversion of the Constitution

976
00:53:28,683 --> 00:53:30,294
to shove our faces into excrement

977
00:53:30,381 --> 00:53:32,078
masquerading as art.

978
00:53:32,905 --> 00:53:36,169
I'm glad I met you, Mr. Maloney.

979
00:53:36,256 --> 00:53:38,650
I feel I have a much better understanding of you...

980
00:53:38,737 --> 00:53:41,609
And Justice Snow.

981
00:53:41,696 --> 00:53:44,569
He may want the absolute freedom to go straight to hell,

982
00:53:44,656 --> 00:53:47,136
that's his right.

983
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:50,139
But he has no right to force the rest of
the country to take the trip with him.

984
00:53:50,705 --> 00:53:51,967
You may step down.

985
00:53:54,709 --> 00:53:57,234
Yeah, you make a pretty good trial lawyer.

986
00:53:57,321 --> 00:53:58,670
Too bad you had to gave it up.

987
00:53:58,757 --> 00:54:01,716
You make a very good actor.

988
00:54:01,803 --> 00:54:04,328
I may always have the feeling there's a
pornographic producer under your robes.

989
00:54:07,331 --> 00:54:09,768
It makes me sick to my stomach

990
00:54:09,855 --> 00:54:12,074
to h ave to defend a principle as noble as the First Amendment

991
00:54:12,161 --> 00:54:15,774
on the basis of that can of film you found so offensive,

992
00:54:15,861 --> 00:54:18,820
but by God, as long as I have tongue and tonsils,

993
00:54:18,907 --> 00:54:21,649
and the ability to talk, I'll defend everybody's right to speak,

994
00:54:21,736 --> 00:54:24,391
and every man's right to be wrong.

995
00:54:24,478 --> 00:54:26,611
I yield to you as the authority on that, Mr. Justice.

996
00:54:30,441 --> 00:54:32,617
She's dangerous.

997
00:54:32,704 --> 00:54:34,401
That woman is positively dangerous.

998
00:54:36,795 --> 00:54:38,971
The men on this court have got to stick together, Mason.

999
00:54:39,058 --> 00:54:41,060
After all, there are only eight of us left

1000
00:54:41,147 --> 00:54:42,540
against all of her.

1001
00:54:44,846 --> 00:54:46,413
Should we smile a little?

1002
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,634
Good God, no. Who would trust a happy justice?

1003
00:54:49,721 --> 00:54:53,551
Should the lady be standing while the five of us are sitting?

1004
00:54:53,638 --> 00:54:55,553
This is where the newest member of the court is supposed to be, I think.

1005
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,076
Ready, everybody?

1006
00:54:57,163 --> 00:54:59,861
Now, please don't look directly into the camera.

1007
00:54:59,948 --> 00:55:01,950
And I think if you seem to be looking out into space?

1008
00:55:02,603 --> 00:55:04,213
Into the future?

1009
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:06,955
I can't see that far. I didn't bring my glasses.

1010
00:55:07,042 --> 00:55:09,131
You'll need more than glasses.

1011
00:55:09,218 --> 00:55:11,786
My wife always hates these pictures. She says we all look stuffed.

1012
00:55:11,873 --> 00:55:14,615
Why don't we take a snapshot of our convictions?

1013
00:55:14,702 --> 00:55:17,270
It would have to be a moving picture, if convictions mean anything.

1014
00:55:17,357 --> 00:55:19,316
My convictions don't move.

1015
00:55:19,403 --> 00:55:20,447
Neither did the dinosaurs.

1016
00:55:23,407 --> 00:55:25,060
Come on, tear that one up.

1017
00:55:25,147 --> 00:55:27,585
Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

1018
00:55:27,672 --> 00:55:30,065
Would somebody suggest to our great dissenter

1019
00:55:30,152 --> 00:55:32,416
that he curb his celebrated sense of humor?

1020
00:55:32,503 --> 00:55:34,592
He 'll need all his wits to keep on

1021
00:55:34,679 --> 00:55:37,072
writing minority opinions.

1022
00:55:37,159 --> 00:55:40,119
Well, a man's got to decide whether to
be on the right side or the winning side.

1023
00:55:40,206 --> 00:55:42,339
Once in a while, they are the same.

1024
00:55:42,426 --> 00:55:45,254
This court isn't going to reverse the Seventh Circuit on Omnitech.

1025
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:47,387
DAN: We sure as hell won't if we don't even hear it.

1026
00:55:47,474 --> 00:55:49,650
Come on, gentlemen. Hold that for the conference room.

1027
00:55:49,737 --> 00:55:51,913
You can wreck the whole business establishment,

1028
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,219
Mr. Justice Snow,

1029
00:55:53,306 --> 00:55:56,091
with your damn socialist ideas!

1030
00:55:56,178 --> 00:55:59,617
I'm about as much of a socialist as Donald Duck and you know it,

1031
00:55:59,704 --> 00:56:01,401
you brainwashed Brahman!

1032
00:56:01,488 --> 00:56:03,534
Come on, come on. Harold, sit down.

1033
00:56:05,318 --> 00:56:07,102
Come on, now. Dan, behave yourself.

1034
00:56:07,189 --> 00:56:08,408
Here we go.

1035
00:56:10,497 --> 00:56:11,803
Destroy that negative.

1036
00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:13,108
Yes, sir.

1037
00:56:15,241 --> 00:56:16,329
Harold, try to remember what you did with your face last year.

1038
00:56:18,026 --> 00:56:18,940
You looked pretty good.

1039
00:56:19,027 --> 00:56:20,507
I did?

1040
00:56:20,594 --> 00:56:23,292
Just look trustworthy.

1041
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,686
Somebody in Washington better look that way.

1042
00:56:25,773 --> 00:56:27,949
Is Justice Snow implying

1043
00:56:28,036 --> 00:56:31,779
that no body in this city, or this country, is honest except him?

1044
00:56:32,867 --> 00:56:34,782
Oh, to hell with the picture.

1045
00:56:34,869 --> 00:56:36,523
CJ: Dan, where are you going? We've got to finish this!

1046
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:38,220
Paste me in from last year.

1047
00:56:40,962 --> 00:56:42,224
CJ: All right, Richard, we'll try again tomorrow.

1048
00:56:42,311 --> 00:56:43,487
RICHARD: Yes, sir.

1049
00:57:10,601 --> 00:57:11,819
It's been a pleasure.

1050
00:57:11,906 --> 00:57:12,690
Good afternoon, sir.

1051
00:57:25,311 --> 00:57:26,399
Where are you going? Not to Europe again?

1052
00:57:27,661 --> 00:57:28,706
Much farther than that.

1053
00:57:29,707 --> 00:57:31,970
The Virgin.

1054
00:57:32,057 --> 00:57:33,537
Yes, you can take those two. I'll bring these myself.

1055
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:37,932
I thought I'd be gone before you came home.

1056
00:57:38,019 --> 00:57:40,892
Usually, that's not very difficult.

1057
00:57:40,979 --> 00:57:43,503
I left a note for you on the dining room table.

1058
00:57:43,590 --> 00:57:45,200
I don't want to read any notes.

1059

01:08:55,522 --> 01:08:56,828
No, I just got in here. Same as you.

1232
01:08:56,915 --> 01:08:58,395
I meant today.

1233
01:08:59,004 --> 01:09:01,006
Oh, today. Well, I, um,

1234
01:09:01,093 --> 01:09:03,008
I'm not sure. I don't keep track.

1235
01:09:03,095 --> 01:09:05,315
Do you know what that do es to your blood sugar? What do you care?

1236
01:09:05,402 --> 01:09:07,882
A person can't make valid judgments with low blood sugar.

1237
01:09:07,969 --> 01:09:09,623
Is that any place in the Constitution?

1238
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:11,582
Well... Good evening.

1239
01:09:11,669 --> 01:09:13,888
I'm not hungry. Just bring me a cup of coffee.

1240
01:09:13,975 --> 01:09:16,108
I think you are hungry and you just don't know it.

1241
01:09:16,195 --> 01:09:17,327
I'm not hungry and I know it.

1242
01:09:17,414 --> 01:09:19,155
I'll order something for you.

1243
01:09:19,242 --> 01:09:20,895
[SPEAKING CANTONESE]

1244
01:09:22,897 --> 01:09:25,987
You're not telling her to put poison in my food, are you?

1245
01:09:26,074 --> 01:09:27,293
I don't know how to say poison.

1246
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:29,774
[CONTINUES IN CANTONESE]

1247
01:09:38,739 --> 01:09:41,568
I appreciate your concern about my insides.

1248
01:09:41,655 --> 01:09:43,353
Do me a favor, will you? Put your hand over your eyes?

1249
01:09:43,744 --> 01:09:44,963
Why?

1250
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:46,138
A test.

1251
01:09:48,662 --> 01:09:49,750
What's on the wall? Wallpaper.

1252
01:09:50,273 --> 01:09:51,448
Uh, what color?

1253
01:09:51,535 --> 01:09:52,927
Gold. Any pattern?

1254
01:09:53,014 --> 01:09:54,712
Yes. What is it?

1255
01:09:54,799 --> 01:09:56,279
Cherry blossoms with bluebirds.

1256
01:10:00,718 --> 01:10:02,110
How the hell did you know that?

1257
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:04,243
I saw it when we came in!

1258
01:10:04,330 --> 01:10:06,724
You go around looking at wallpaper everyplace?

1259
01:10:06,811 --> 01:10:08,421
My God, that's what's wrong with you!

1260
01:10:08,508 --> 01:10:10,510
Your brains are full of wallpaper.

1261
01:10:10,597 --> 01:10:12,120
W e ll, your brain is full of...

1262
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:13,557
Watch that. Watch...

1263
01:10:15,254 --> 01:10:16,255
People... People here...

1264
01:10:18,649 --> 01:10:23,131
I was going to say momentum engines and Omnitech.

1265
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:26,091
Omnitechmay be the most importance case of this decade.

1266
01:10:26,178 --> 01:10:28,398
When one tiny group of stockholders tries to

1267
01:10:28,485 --> 01:10:29,616
undermine a great corporation...

1268
01:10:29,703 --> 01:10:31,531
Big. Huge. Not necessarily great.

1269
01:10:34,578 --> 01:10:37,624
How come the president of Omnitech didn't show up at his own trial?

1270
01:10:37,711 --> 01:10:40,366
Don Richards doesn't want the courts to put him out of business!

1271
01:10:40,453 --> 01:10:42,281
Rule against Omnitech, and down goes the whole corporate system.

1272
01:10:42,368 --> 01:10:43,848
Only the abuses.

1273
01:10:43,935 --> 01:10:45,850
In your isolated opinion.

1274
01:10:45,937 --> 01:10:49,680
Not so isolated. W e have statutes that define the abuses.

1275
01:10:49,767 --> 01:10:51,638
If we try to extend our jurisdiction... All I'm asking is what's fair.

1276
01:10:51,725 --> 01:10:52,900
...into legislative area.

1277
01:10:52,987 --> 01:10:55,120
Don't you see? Omnitech must win.

1278
01:10:55,207 --> 01:10:57,427
Oh, you think that, do you? Y es!

1279
01:10:57,514 --> 01:10:59,994
Well it seems to me anything can happen, no matter how great the odds.

1280
01:11:00,081 --> 01:11:02,475
That's what makes this country so wonderful.

1281
01:11:02,562 --> 01:11:04,651
I absolutely agree with you.

1282
01:11:06,610 --> 01:11:09,482
But do you know what I believe more than anything else?
You said it on the bench!

1283
01:11:09,569 --> 01:11:11,789
You said, "The noblest purpose of this high court

1284
01:11:13,225 --> 01:11:15,575
"is to keep the government off the backs of the people."

1285
01:11:15,662 --> 01:11:17,360
People, yes. Not the large...

1286
01:11:17,447 --> 01:11:19,187
Aren't corporations people?

1287
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:20,711
Owned by people, run by people. ...not the large.

1288
01:11:20,798 --> 01:11:22,843
Not the large... For the benefit of people?

1289
01:11:22,930 --> 01:11:25,281
Not the large...

1290
01:11:25,368 --> 01:11:27,065
And they may be destroyed by people
on the high court who seem to have

1291
01:11:27,152 --> 01:11:29,197
forgotten some of their earlier and wiser opinions.

1292
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:31,069
Ah, the hell with this!

1293
01:11:33,637 --> 01:11:35,203
You haven't eaten your dim sum.

1294
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:37,205
To hell with my dim sum!

1295
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:39,817
What about your blood sugar?

1296
01:11:39,904 --> 01:11:42,428
To hell with my blood sugar.
All I wanted anyhow was a cup of coffee and a fork.

1297
01:11:42,515 --> 01:11:43,821
Is something wrong, sir? Yes. Everything.

1298
01:11:43,908 --> 01:11:45,388
Give me a check!

1299
01:11:45,475 --> 01:11:47,041
I 'll take the check.

1300
01:11:47,128 --> 01:11:49,827
Yes, you do that. You'll feel much better about it.

1301
01:11:49,914 --> 01:11:51,568
And don't worry about me. I'll be just fine. I'll take a cab.

1302
01:11:51,872 --> 01:11:52,830
Good.

1303
01:11:55,223 --> 01:11:56,747
It's nothing personal.

1304
01:11:56,834 --> 01:11:59,576
He's just very upset.

1305
01:11:59,663 --> 01:12:00,794
He's been working too hard.

1306
01:12:15,505 --> 01:12:16,810
I don't have any money for a cab.

1307
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:31,972
Good night, Madam Justice.

1308
01:13:32,059 --> 01:13:34,410
Would you see that these are delivered to Justice Snow in the morning?

1309
01:13:34,497 --> 01:13:35,498
Justice Snow's still here.

1310
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:38,022
I don't think so.

1311
01:13:38,109 --> 01:13:39,066
He 's in the court, ma'am.

1312
01:13:40,154 --> 01:13:41,329
This late?

1313
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:42,243
And it is, ma'am.

1314
01:13:45,508 --> 01:13:46,639
Okay. Thank you.

1315
01:14:24,590 --> 01:14:25,678
How long have you been here?

1316
01:14:26,810 --> 01:14:28,246
Since October.

1317
01:14:31,292 --> 01:14:33,469
I'm not sure the lady has enough seniority

1318
01:14:33,556 --> 01:14:35,427
to haunt these chambers at, uh,

1319
01:14:37,037 --> 01:14:39,692
1:20 in the morning.

1320
01:14:39,779 --> 01:14:41,433
What the hell are you doing here so late?

1321
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:42,826
Studying for finals.

1322
01:14:46,177 --> 01:14:47,352
What about you?

1323
01:14:49,659 --> 01:14:52,488
Well, I used to think I lived in Georgetown,

1324
01:14:52,575 --> 01:14:53,793
but I guess this is more my permanent residence.

1325
01:14:58,102 --> 01:15:01,845
I brought you these. A few opinions of mine from the lower court.

1326
01:15:03,368 --> 01:15:04,935
I'll read them. Thank you.

1327
01:15:05,022 --> 01:15:05,892
You're welcome.

1328
01:15:07,415 --> 01:15:08,765
May I ask you a question?

1329
01:15:11,202 --> 01:15:12,246
Sure.

1330
01:15:15,902 --> 01:15:17,600
Other than my blood sugar

1331
01:15:17,687 --> 01:15:19,123
and my bad table manners,

1332
01:15:20,907 --> 01:15:23,344
exactly how repulsive do you think I am?

1333
01:15:24,781 --> 01:15:26,522
Do you want my opinion as a justice of the Supreme Court?

1334
01:15:26,609 --> 01:15:28,088
No, no, no.

1335
01:15:28,175 --> 01:15:29,307
As a woman.

1336
01:15:33,093 --> 01:15:34,355
You want to take the Fifth?

1337
01:15:35,095 --> 01:15:36,357
Maybe one of us had better.

1338
01:15:42,015 --> 01:15:43,669
My car runs now.

1339
01:15:43,756 --> 01:15:45,149
Would you like a lift home?

1340
01:15:45,584 --> 01:15:48,021
No.

1341
01:15:48,108 --> 01:15:50,154
Pretty cool around the Snow household these days.

1342
01:15:51,024 --> 01:15:52,460
I heard that.

1343
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:54,724
I'm sorry.

1344
01:15:54,811 --> 01:15:56,247
It's your fault, you know.

1345
01:15:57,117 --> 01:16:00,294
My fault?

1346
01:16:00,381 --> 01:16:03,646
I think my wife thinks that I spend so
much time being furious at you that I don't

1347
01:16:03,733 --> 01:16:05,648
have enough energy left to be furious with her.

1348
01:16:07,214 --> 01:16:09,347
And I have a hunch

1349
01:16:13,177 --> 01:16:14,700
she thinks I consider you attractive.

1350
01:16:16,963 --> 01:16:20,010
There's certainly no evidence to support that contention.

1351
01:16:20,097 --> 01:16:23,970
Oh, I wouldn't be too sure about that.

1352
01:16:24,057 --> 01:16:26,712
I hope you assured Mrs. Snow that the mere fact one of your

1353
01:16:26,799 --> 01:16:28,366
colleagues happens to be a woman...

1354
01:16:28,453 --> 01:16:29,976
That's no mere fact.

1355
01:16:30,063 --> 01:16:31,674
That's an overwhelming fact.

1356
01:16:31,761 --> 01:16:33,980
But I've never been prejudiced by sex.

1357
01:16:34,067 --> 01:16:35,112
Entertained, yes. Prejudiced, never.

1358
01:16:36,330 --> 01:16:38,289
Yes, yes, yes.

1359
01:16:38,376 --> 01:16:41,161
This is a dandy. I remember it well.

1360
01:16:41,248 --> 01:16:43,033
I don't agree with a word of it, but it's well-written.

1361
01:16:45,557 --> 01:16:48,342
How can you be so goddamned logical

1362
01:16:48,429 --> 01:16:49,387
and so goddamned wrong?

1363
01:16:52,085 --> 01:16:54,914
What's so wrong about encouraging the economy?

1364
01:16:55,001 --> 01:16:57,264
I've heard you talk over and over again

1365
01:16:57,351 --> 01:17:00,267
about improving the quality of life on this planet

1366
01:17:00,354 --> 01:17:01,486
and I agree with you, Dan.

1367
01:17:03,531 --> 01:17:04,750
Justice Snow.

1368
01:17:04,837 --> 01:17:05,969
Dan is fine.

1369
01:17:08,449 --> 01:17:09,799
Look what these great companies have done for us.

1370
01:17:09,886 --> 01:17:11,104
Large companies.

1371
01:17:11,191 --> 01:17:12,889
Large. Large.

1372
01:17:12,976 --> 01:17:15,108
Are we going to throw those benefits away?

1373
01:17:15,195 --> 01:17:17,197
Should I take my weekly wash down
to the banks of the Potomac River and

1374
01:17:17,284 --> 01:17:18,372
and beat it with rocks?

1375
01:17:18,459 --> 01:17:19,591
Won't get it very clean.

1376
01:17:21,549 --> 01:17:24,204
If we reverse the Seventh Circuit on Omnitech...

1377
01:17:24,291 --> 01:17:26,511
If it's so damn important,

1378
01:17:26,598 --> 01:17:29,906
why doesn't Donald Richards stand trial?

1379
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:32,125
What do you want to know?

1380
01:17:32,212 --> 01:17:34,084
You're not Donald Richards,

1381
01:17:34,171 --> 01:17:35,346
and he's the one with the answers.

1382
01:17:46,009 --> 01:17:48,054
Swear me in.

1383
01:17:48,141 --> 01:17:49,882
Oh, you want to play that game again.

1384
01:17:50,622 --> 01:17:52,885
All right. You're sworn.

1385
01:17:52,972 --> 01:17:55,322
I am delighted, Mr. Donald Richards,

1386
01:17:55,409 --> 01:17:57,455
to have you here at last.

1387
01:17:57,542 --> 01:17:58,935
In the flesh, so to speak.

1388
01:18:01,067 --> 01:18:04,027
Would you state your occupation, please?

1389
01:18:04,114 --> 01:18:07,726
I'm president and chairman of the board of Omnitech International.

1390
01:18:07,813 --> 01:18:10,468
Why did you refuse to testify in the suit against your company?

1391
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:13,601
I never received a subpoena.

1392
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:16,648
They have to know where you are to serve it.

1393
01:18:16,735 --> 01:18:20,260
But you deliberately made yourself unavailable, remained in hiding.

1394
01:18:22,915 --> 01:18:24,569
Doesn't an American citizen

1395
01:18:24,656 --> 01:18:25,788
have a right to privacy?

1396
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:28,312
Tell me something, sir.

1397
01:18:28,399 --> 01:18:31,576
I'll bet you have a share or two of stock in Omnitech?

1398
01:18:32,925 --> 01:18:34,971
I'm the majority stockholder.

1399
01:18:35,058 --> 01:18:37,451
Yes. I kind of thought you were.

1400
01:18:37,538 --> 01:18:40,237
Now, what about all those little stockholders

1401
01:18:40,324 --> 01:18:43,544
who got wind of the appalling notion

1402
01:18:43,631 --> 01:18:48,636
that you, Mr. Richards, grabbed up an earthshaking idea and strangled it.

1403
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:51,074
You know what I find appalling?

1404
01:18:51,161 --> 01:18:53,119
That you have the arrogance to pass

1405
01:18:53,206 --> 01:18:55,426
judgment on something you don't know anything about.

1406
01:18:55,513 --> 01:18:57,820
Bu t you do, Mr. Richards?

1407
01:18:57,907 --> 01:19:00,431
When we test something, like the momentum engine,

1408
01:19:00,518 --> 01:19:02,781
and we find out it doesn't work,

1409
01:19:02,868 --> 01:19:06,306
we drop it and spend our time and money on something that will work.

1410
01:19:06,393 --> 01:19:09,570
What about the experts who say it does work?

1411
01:19:09,657 --> 01:19:12,399
You think I would deliberately dump an idea

1412
01:19:12,486 --> 01:19:14,837
that could make millions for my stockholders?

1413
01:19:14,924 --> 01:19:17,317
But you've got billions committed

1414
01:19:17,404 --> 01:19:19,929
to the internal combustion engine.

1415
01:19:20,016 --> 01:19:24,150
Omnitech makes spark plugs, you wanna go on making spark plugs.

1416
01:19:24,237 --> 01:19:27,632
There's money in carburetors. You wanna go on making carburetors.

1417
01:19:27,719 --> 01:19:30,722
You've got vested interests in 16 oil companies.

1418
01:19:30,809 --> 01:19:33,899
You wanna go on selling gas.

1419
01:19:33,986 --> 01:19:37,033
You have one noble purpose, Mr.
Richards, to keep things the way they are.

1420
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:41,951
An idea doesn't just turn into a reality.

1421
01:19:42,038 --> 01:19:44,040
Something's gotta make it happen.

1422
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:46,912
It takes money to build factories,

1423
01:19:46,999 --> 01:19:49,088
grind out a product, advertise it, sell it.

1424
01:19:49,175 --> 01:19:52,526
Did you ever hear of a box of cereal

1425
01:19:52,613 --> 01:19:54,702
or a tube of toothpaste going out and giving birth to itself?

1426
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:57,140
Do you know what it takes?

1427
01:19:57,227 --> 01:20:00,056
Capital. Capital. You're damn right.

1428
01:20:00,143 --> 01:20:02,710
And I'm not going to commit my corporation

1429
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:05,191
to the expenditure of millions of dollars on an idea

1430
01:20:05,278 --> 01:20:06,932
that just doesn't work.

1431
01:20:07,019 --> 01:20:08,673
That you say doesn't work.

1432
01:20:09,065 --> 01:20:10,762
Look.

1433
01:20:10,849 --> 01:20:13,112
Thomas Edison dreamed up the electric light bulb.

1434
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:15,462
The government gave him a patent.

1435
01:20:15,549 --> 01:20:17,551
So that he could profit from his invention.

1436
01:20:17,638 --> 01:20:20,728
Fine! But the light itself belongs to everybody,

1437
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:23,688
and nobody... Nobody has a right

1438
01:20:23,775 --> 01:20:26,560
to turn on the darkness.

1439
01:20:26,647 --> 01:20:30,695
You dare accuse me, my company, my companies, of practices

1440
01:20:30,782 --> 01:20:32,305
that belong in the Dark Ages?

1441
01:20:32,392 --> 01:20:35,265
Then let there be light!

1442
01:20:35,352 --> 01:20:36,657
Come out of the dark, Donald Richards!

You know what I think? I think you're dead, Donald Richards.

1447
01:20:47,233 --> 01:20:51,455
I think you've been dead for a long time. 8, maybe 10 years.

1448
01:20:51,542 --> 01:20:53,674
It 's been that long since anyone has seen you.

1449
01:20:53,761 --> 01:20:57,026
And if you are dead, who is running Omnitech?

1450
01:20:57,113 --> 01:20:59,419
Who actually holds all that power?

1451
01:20:59,506 --> 01:21:01,726

who are compounding your suppression of the momentum engine

1455
01:21:08,907 --> 01:21:10,561
by hiding behind a dead man?

1456
01:21:11,475 --> 01:21:13,477
Why would anybody want to do that?

1457
01:21:13,564 --> 01:21:16,088
Hell of a lot of reasons. Dodge inheritance taxes,

1458
01:21:16,175 --> 01:21:18,177
avoid a power struggle.

1459
01:21:18,264 --> 01:21:20,484
Hang on to government contracts.

1460
01:21:20,571 --> 01:21:24,270
Omnitech is a phantom government hiding behind a dead man.

We can't see it. We didn't elect it.

It doesn't exist. It never dies!

1463

lasted about five minutes.

01:28:59,116 --> 01:29:00,900
I w ent to California for the day.

1579
01:29:00,987 --> 01:29:01,988
Couldn't take it, huh?

1580
01:29:03,642 --> 01:29:04,948
I'm resigning from the court.

1581
01:29:06,123 --> 01:29:07,777
Why would you do a damn fool thing like that?

1582
01:29:09,256 --> 01:29:12,869
I found out that Jack, my husband,

1583
01:29:12,956 --> 01:29:15,959
and our law firm were involved with Omnitech.

1584
01:29:18,614 --> 01:29:20,572
Good morning, Dan. Morning.

1585
01:29:20,659 --> 01:29:23,009
Dr. Fogger, Madam Justice Loomis.

1586
01:29:23,096 --> 01:29:24,446
Oh. Oh, well... How do you do?

1587
01:29:24,533 --> 01:29:26,056
Hello. It's a pleasure.

1588
01:29:26,143 --> 01:29:28,319
Somebody swiped my telephone, Doctor.

1589
01:29:28,406 --> 01:29:30,713
No, no, no. We took it out, Dan. We want you to rest.

1590
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:33,063
How do you expect me to rest without a telephone?

1591
01:29:33,150 --> 01:29:35,065
That logic will get you nowhere.

1592
01:29:35,152 --> 01:29:38,068
Would you please stop trying to change the hospital rules?

1593
01:29:39,548 --> 01:29:41,767
The First Amendment to the Constitution does not apply in hospitals.

1594
01:29:43,813 --> 01:29:44,640
It should.

1595
01:29:51,821 --> 01:29:52,952
[DOORBELL RINGING]

1596
01:30:00,264 --> 01:30:01,831
[DOORBELL CONTINUES]

1597
01:30:19,326 --> 01:30:21,111
What the hell are you doing here?

1598
01:30:21,198 --> 01:30:22,242
Official business of the federal government.

1599
01:30:23,635 --> 01:30:24,680
May I come in?

1600
01:30:27,247 --> 01:30:28,640
Oh, did I get you in the middle of something?

1601
01:30:28,727 --> 01:30:29,859
I'm sorry.

1602
01:30:31,948 --> 01:30:34,516
What did you do, just get up and walk out?

1603
01:30:34,603 --> 01:30:37,388
Yes, ma'am. This is very nice.

1604
01:30:37,475 --> 01:30:39,738
They told me you're still under observation.

1605
01:30:39,825 --> 01:30:41,566
It's bigger than my place. They don't even know what happened to you.

1606
01:30:41,653 --> 01:30:43,089
Well, they'll have to figure it out without me.

1607
01:30:43,176 --> 01:30:44,874
I can't give them any more of my time.

1608
01:30:44,961 --> 01:30:46,136
Dan, if it was a coronary...

1609
01:30:46,223 --> 01:30:47,920
Coronary?

1610
01:30:48,007 --> 01:30:50,662
My heart wouldn't dare attack me.

1611
01:30:50,749 --> 01:30:53,056
Now what's all this crap about quitting?

1612
01:30:53,491 --> 01:30:54,710
Do you mind?

1613
01:31:01,151 --> 01:31:03,153
Why don't you lie down?

1614
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:05,372
That's okay. I'll be all right in a minute. Put your feet up.

1615
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:06,635
Can I get you a pillow?

1616
01:31:06,722 --> 01:31:07,897
Sure, why not?

1617
01:31:25,958 --> 01:31:27,307
Are you asleep?

1618
01:31:27,394 --> 01:31:28,395
Yes.

1619
01:31:32,399 --> 01:31:33,444
Here.

1620
01:31:39,755 --> 01:31:41,060
You want to tell me what's wrong?

1621
01:31:42,627 --> 01:31:45,151
Are you well enough to talk?

1622
01:31:45,238 --> 01:31:46,370
I'm even well enough to listen.

1623
01:31:49,765 --> 01:31:51,593
The other night,

1624
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:53,246
you made an outrageous statement.

1625
01:31:54,596 --> 01:31:56,162
You said you didn't think Donald Richards was still alive.

1626
01:32:02,995 --> 01:32:04,823
I got this out of a sealed Loomis and Loomis file in Santa Ana.

1627
01:32:08,523 --> 01:32:10,089
It's Donald Richards' death certificate.

1628
01:32:10,176 --> 01:32:11,351
Holy God.

1629
01:32:13,223 --> 01:32:14,137
Anybody else see this?

1630
01:32:14,224 --> 01:32:15,138
No.

1631
01:32:17,706 --> 01:32:19,098
This makes Omnitecha whole new ballgame.

1632
01:32:21,318 --> 01:32:22,972
God, are we going to shake up the brothers!

1633
01:32:24,887 --> 01:32:27,019
Get your clothes on.

1634
01:32:27,106 --> 01:32:27,716
W e can still make that morning conference.

1635
01:32:28,194 --> 01:32:29,761
I'm not going.

1636
01:32:30,022 --> 01:32:31,241
What?

1637
01:32:31,328 --> 01:32:33,069
I told you.

1638
01:32:33,156 --> 01:32:35,593
I'm resigning from the court.

1639
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:37,160
That's idiotic. It doesn't make any sense.

1640
01:32:37,987 --> 01:32:40,380
My husband knew.

1641
01:32:40,467 --> 01:32:44,950
Jack knew that Donald Richards died in Costa Rica in 1973.

1642
01:32:45,037 --> 01:32:46,386
And he was part of the conspiracy to cover it up.

1643
01:32:46,473 --> 01:32:48,345
Did you know?

1644
01:32:48,432 --> 01:32:50,303
Did your husband ever tell you anything about it?

1645
01:32:50,390 --> 01:32:52,654
No. Of course not.

1646
01:32:52,741 --> 01:32:54,960
Then there's no reason to resign.

1647
01:32:55,047 --> 01:32:56,527
Get some clothes on. Let's get down there.

1648
01:32:59,269 --> 01:33:02,054
If there's the slightest doubt in anybody's mind that I belong there,

1649
01:33:03,229 --> 01:33:05,318
I don't want to be there.

1650
01:33:05,405 --> 01:33:07,973
Lady, that is extremely noble,

1651
01:33:08,060 --> 01:33:09,105
but goddamned wrong.

1652
01:33:14,197 --> 01:33:16,591
What do you think I should do, Dan? What's protocol?

1653
01:33:16,678 --> 01:33:18,157
Should I write the President?

1654
01:33:18,244 --> 01:33:19,419
You don't write anybody. Keep your robes on.

1655
01:33:19,506 --> 01:33:20,986
Let the mud fly. It won't stick to you.

1656
01:33:21,073 --> 01:33:23,728
Quitting the court without good reason

1657
01:33:23,815 --> 01:33:26,252
is spitting in the face of the government that put you there.

1658
01:33:26,339 --> 01:33:28,864
Without good reason? I've got good reason.

1659
01:33:28,951 --> 01:33:30,996
Because of something your husband did that you know nothing about?

1660
01:33:31,083 --> 01:33:32,215
When you're married to somebody you become...

1661
01:33:32,302 --> 01:33:34,304
You're a member of the high court...

1662
01:33:34,391 --> 01:33:36,480
You don't dissociate yourself from somebody that you're married to.

1663
01:33:36,567 --> 01:33:38,656
...by God, something happens.

1664
01:33:38,743 --> 01:33:41,528
"In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,

1665
01:33:41,616 --> 01:33:42,617
"this corrupt ion shall put on incorruption."

1666
01:33:43,835 --> 01:33:45,228
St. Paul vs. The Corinthians.

1667
01:33:46,229 --> 01:33:47,491
Etal.

1668
01:33:47,578 --> 01:33:48,710
Interesting case.

1669
01:33:52,104 --> 01:33:54,716
But what if an incorrupt person finds out that she's corrupt?

1670
01:33:56,631 --> 01:33:57,719
That's applesauce and you know it.

1671
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:03,028
I thought you'd be happy to have me off the court.

1672
01:34:03,115 --> 01:34:04,595
That was before you were on the court.

1673
01:34:13,473 --> 01:34:15,040
I never thought I'd ever kiss a Supreme Court Justice.

1674
01:34:16,433 --> 01:34:18,653
You didn't kiss me. I kissed you.

1675
01:34:22,004 --> 01:34:23,396
Make you a deal.

1676
01:34:23,483 --> 01:34:25,355
You don't resign, I don't die.

1677
01:34:27,531 --> 01:34:29,098
Let me think about that.

1678
01:34:38,585 --> 01:34:41,066
Don't we want the working entrance?

1679
01:34:41,153 --> 01:34:42,372
Not this morning. Right up the front steps.

1680
01:34:43,939 --> 01:34:46,855
Can't wait to get into that conference room.

1681
01:34:46,942 --> 01:34:49,814
You really think we can go in there and I can pick up where I left off?

1682
01:34:49,901 --> 01:34:51,947
Hell no. Every day is different.

1683
01:34:52,034 --> 01:34:53,862
You're different. I'm different.

1684
01:34:53,949 --> 01:34:56,125
Every morning, a fresh beginning. Fresh start.

1685
01:34:57,779 --> 01:34:59,737
First Monday in October. Always.

1686
01:34:59,824 --> 01:35:00,956
CABBIE: Hey!

1687
01:35:01,565 --> 01:35:02,914
What about the meter?

1688
01:35:04,133 --> 01:35:06,004
I don't have any money.

1689
01:35:06,091 --> 01:35:07,484
You liberals never do.

1690
01:35:09,704 --> 01:35:10,574
$4.25.

1691
01:35:12,445 --> 01:35:14,056
Here. Keep the change.

1692
01:35:14,143 --> 01:35:15,144
Thanks, Your Honor.

1693
01:35:20,976 --> 01:35:23,718
You know what's on the calendar right after Omnitech, don't you?

1694
01:35:23,805 --> 01:35:27,199
First Atheist Church vs. The City of Waco, Texas.

1695
01:35:27,286 --> 01:35:28,635
You ain't going to miss that one, are you?

1696
01:35:28,723 --> 01:35:30,855
Obviously, community standards should prevail.

1697
01:35:30,942 --> 01:35:32,117
What about religious freedom?

1698
01:35:32,204 --> 01:35:33,466
Atheism is a religion?

1699
01:35:33,553 --> 01:35:35,730
God, yes. Oh, Dan!

1700
01:35:35,817 --> 01:35:37,949
What about Cook County Diocese vs. John Doe?

1701
01:35:38,036 --> 01:35:39,342
What about Smith v. US?

1702
01:35:39,429 --> 01:35:40,865
Miller vs. Moon.

1703
01:35:40,952 --> 01:35:42,301
Dalton v. Utah.

1704
01:35:42,388 --> 01:35:43,563
Oh, we're going to have a battle on that one.

1705
01:35:43,650 --> 01:35:45,304
You can count on it.

1706
01:35:45,391 --> 01:35:47,002
You shouldn't be climbing these steps! Why not?

1707
01:35:47,089 --> 01:35:48,481
This is my mountain, our mountain.

1708
01:35:50,266 --> 01:35:52,137
You know something?

1709
01:35:52,224 --> 01:35:53,748
You and I make each other possible.

1710
01:35:53,835 --> 01:35:54,792
Damn right, we do.
