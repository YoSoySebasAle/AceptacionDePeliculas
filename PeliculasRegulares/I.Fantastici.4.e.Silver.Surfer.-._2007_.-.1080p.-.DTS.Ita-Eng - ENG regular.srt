1
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,988
<i>Last night, the FAA was forced
to ground all aircraft, leaving thousands stranded...</i>

2
00:03:32,071 --> 00:03:34,866
<i>...when electronic failures
and mysterious power outages...</i>

3
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:38,703
<i>...crippled the western United States.
But the big story today...</i>

4
00:03:38,786 --> 00:03:41,831
<i>...the much-anticipated wedding
of fantastic couple...</i>

5
00:03:41,914 --> 00:03:46,460
<i>...Reed Richards and Susan Storm
will take place this Saturday.</i>

6
00:03:49,547 --> 00:03:52,383
Unbelievable. Bizarre anomalies...

7
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:56,345
...are occurring all over the world,
defying every law of physics...

8
00:03:56,429 --> 00:03:59,891
...and all the media care about
is what china pattern we picked.

9
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:04,770
What did you pick? The blue ones
with them little flowers? I like them.

10
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:06,647
Excuse me, would you mind?

11
00:04:06,731 --> 00:04:09,775
- It's happening again, isn't it?
- Yeah, sure.

12
00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:13,279
No. We're not postponing
anything, not this time.

13
00:04:13,362 --> 00:04:18,034
This will be the wedding you dreamed of.
I won't let anything get in the way.

14
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:23,164
Not even the mysterious transformation
of matter at the subatomic level.

15
00:04:23,706 --> 00:04:27,293
That's the most romantic thing
you've ever said to me.

16
00:04:27,877 --> 00:04:30,546
Which is really pathetic,
when you think about it.

17
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,925
Dr. Richards, I'm very sorry,
but we're overbooked.

18
00:04:34,008 --> 00:04:37,803
- We do have seats available in coach.
- Okay, here we go.

19
00:04:37,887 --> 00:04:39,263
- Smile!
- Awesome!

20
00:04:39,347 --> 00:04:40,806
Look, Mom!

21
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,809
- Let me get one more.
- That should be fine.

22
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,106
That's my seat.

23
00:04:50,566 --> 00:04:51,901
Sorry.

24
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:06,958
Excuse me.

25
00:05:18,135 --> 00:05:22,264
What if we get an endorsement
from an airline? Get us a private jet?

26
00:05:22,348 --> 00:05:25,101
I think we have enough
endorsement deals.

27
00:05:26,394 --> 00:05:31,190
That's funny. Seriously, Reed, it could
help subsidize your little inventions.

28
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,401
- No, thanks.
- Excuse me.

29
00:05:34,235 --> 00:05:37,738
- Consider it. Talk to you later.
- Where are you going?

30
00:05:37,822 --> 00:05:39,115
I don't fly coach.

31
00:05:56,507 --> 00:05:58,134
I hope it rains.

32
00:05:58,801 --> 00:06:01,220
<i>The snowfall came with no warning...</i>

33
00:06:01,303 --> 00:06:03,889
<i>...and covered the pyramids
in 2 inches of snow.</i>

34
00:06:03,973 --> 00:06:07,184
<i>In Japan, some suggest
the solidification of the bay...</i>

35
00:06:07,268 --> 00:06:09,520
<i>was due to underwater
volcanic activity...</i>

36
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:12,565
...though no such activity
has been reported in the area.

37
00:06:12,648 --> 00:06:14,692
<i>Scientists have ruled out
global warming.</i> ..

38
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:19,030
<i>...As the cause of the climatic events
being reported around the globe.</i>

39
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:22,033
<i>With scientists unable
to explain the events...</i>

40
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:25,453
<i>...some are wondering
if the hand of God is at work.</i>

41
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:29,457
<i>In other news, Reed Richards
and Susan Storm's wedding...</i>

42
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,333
<i>...has Manhattan all abuzz.</i>

43
00:06:31,417 --> 00:06:35,087
<i>The guest list includes
many of New York's power elite.</i>

44
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,090
Hey, honey.

45
00:06:38,257 --> 00:06:41,927
The city's charging us for three
squad cars they say we destroyed...

46
00:06:42,011 --> 00:06:46,766
...during that armored-car robbery.
I only remember two cars getting thrown.

47
00:06:48,476 --> 00:06:49,643
Reed.

48
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:54,273
All right. I'm putting it away.

49
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:56,192
You were saying?

50
00:06:56,275 --> 00:06:59,820
I have a fitting in half an hour.
The musicians after that.

51
00:06:59,904 --> 00:07:04,909
I haven't picked out the place settings
or the flowers. There's too much to do.

52
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:09,246
Don't worry about it. Between
the two of us, we'll get it all done.

53
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,457
And what were you doing
when I walked in?

54
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,251
- Inputting my to-do list.
- Really?

55
00:07:14,627 --> 00:07:16,587
- Scout's honor.
- Hey, guys.

56
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,590
New uniforms showed up.
What do you think?

57
00:07:21,884 --> 00:07:24,970
I think there's no way
we're wearing that.

58
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:28,599
What do you have against capitalism?

59
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:32,353
What's this?

60
00:07:32,436 --> 00:07:34,605
- Just a little hobby of mine.
- Yeah?

61
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:38,609
Would it make a good toy,
or is it something science-y?

62
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:40,402
A little of both.

63
00:07:44,281 --> 00:07:46,867
I'm both impressed
and disgusted at that.

64
00:07:46,951 --> 00:07:49,411
Yeah. Sue says I'm addicted to it.

65
00:07:49,787 --> 00:07:51,622
I wonder why she'd say that.

66
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:53,207
Hey, Johnny.

67
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:58,963
Keep it quiet, but I've cross-referenced
and analyzed the global disturbances.

68
00:08:00,381 --> 00:08:04,301
They're caused by cosmic radiation, not
unlike the kind which gave us our powers.

69
00:08:04,426 --> 00:08:06,762
Wow, that's really boring.

70
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:11,934
Listen, I have a very important
wedding issue we need to talk about.

71
00:08:12,017 --> 00:08:13,602
Yeah, of course.

72
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:15,688
Your bachelor party.

73
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,732
No. Seriously, Johnny.

74
00:08:18,816 --> 00:08:23,237
John. Focus-testing showed Johnny
skewed a little young.

75
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:28,159
Seriously, Johnny, no bachelor party.
It's just not my kind of thing.

76
00:08:28,826 --> 00:08:33,372
Then do it for Ben. It means a lot
to the big guy. You'll break his heart.

77
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:35,833
He does have some
sort of rock like heart.

78
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,877
I have too much to do
before the wedding.

79
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,796
I think Sue might have
a problem with it.

80
00:08:41,547 --> 00:08:44,091
You know what Sue
would have a problem with?

81
00:08:44,216 --> 00:08:47,094
If somebody told her
you were investigating...

82
00:08:47,178 --> 00:08:49,430
...global disturbances
and cosmic radiation...

83
00:08:49,513 --> 00:08:54,351
...instead of focusing on the wedding,
like you promised.

84
00:09:05,613 --> 00:09:07,615
- A bachelor party could be fun.
- Yes!

85
00:09:07,698 --> 00:09:09,700
But no exotic dancers.

86
00:09:56,372 --> 00:09:59,250
- This is it?
- I don't know anybody here.

87
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:02,795
I would have invited your friends,
but you don't have any.

88
00:10:02,878 --> 00:10:04,213
Hey!

89
00:10:04,588 --> 00:10:06,548
Johnny, we had a deal.

90
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:09,510
They're not exotic dancers.

91
00:10:10,552 --> 00:10:12,221
They're just hot.

92
00:10:15,266 --> 00:10:19,103
You're Mr. Fantastic, aren't you?
That's so awesome.

93
00:10:23,232 --> 00:10:25,234
Wow, you're really cute.

94
00:10:25,442 --> 00:10:28,112
I'll need a pitcher with
the biggest handle you've got.

95
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:29,780
No problem.

96
00:10:45,671 --> 00:10:48,590
Good evening,
and welcome to the Baxter...

97
00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:54,013
Could I help you?
No, you can't use that elev...

98
00:11:00,144 --> 00:11:02,688
Ms. Storm will be with your shortly.

99
00:11:05,274 --> 00:11:06,567
Hello?

100
00:11:07,151 --> 00:11:08,819
Thanks, Roberta.

101
00:11:11,363 --> 00:11:12,614
May I help you?

102
00:11:12,698 --> 00:11:16,910
- We're here to see Dr. Richards.
- He's not here. Can I help you?

103
00:11:16,994 --> 00:11:19,830
Yes. You can take me
to see Dr. Richards.

104
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:23,000
Okay.

105
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:32,551
Sorry.

106
00:11:34,303 --> 00:11:38,807
When the universe began, it was
no bigger than a marble. Then, bang!

107
00:11:39,558 --> 00:11:42,519
It exploded.
And in a trillionth of a second...

108
00:11:42,603 --> 00:11:46,065
...it expanded exponentially into
what became the universe we know.

109
00:11:46,148 --> 00:11:49,276
Wow, you're really smart.

110
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,112
Thanks, Candy.
That means a lot to me.

111
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:55,115
I love this song. Wanna dance?

112
00:11:55,199 --> 00:11:56,658
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

113
00:11:56,742 --> 00:11:58,869
- Honestly.
- Come on, you'll be great.

114
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:01,622
I don't want to embarrass you guys.

115
00:12:11,673 --> 00:12:14,510
Just loosen up. Have some fun.

116
00:12:16,095 --> 00:12:17,429
That's it.

117
00:12:17,513 --> 00:12:18,680
Yeah.

118
00:12:21,266 --> 00:12:22,768
That's it.

119
00:12:32,653 --> 00:12:36,198
- Guy really knows how to loosen up.
- You're not kidding.

120
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,348
There he is.

121
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:02,516
Yes.

122
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,852
Unfortunately.

123
00:13:10,941 --> 00:13:12,359
For him.

124
00:13:15,696 --> 00:13:17,114
Shall we?

125
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:24,872
I think it might be clobbering time.

126
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:27,624
Sue. What are you...?

127
00:13:31,253 --> 00:13:32,796
General Hager.

128
00:13:33,714 --> 00:13:35,841
Let's talk somewhere private.

129
00:13:35,924 --> 00:13:39,636
Unless you need to do Jell-O shots
off someone's stomach.

130
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,891
I was explaining to the girls
about how the big bang led to...

131
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:48,061
This was Johnny's idea.
I just went along.

132
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,441
How does Reed know the general?

133
00:13:52,524 --> 00:13:56,153
A few years back, the guy was pushing
a new missile-defense system.

134
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:58,363
Reed testified that the
technology wouldn't work.

135
00:13:58,447 --> 00:14:01,783
I'm here on direct orders from
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

136
00:14:01,867 --> 00:14:06,079
Personally, I don't like sharing
sensitive information with a civilian.

137
00:14:06,163 --> 00:14:09,750
Especially one who enjoys
the public spotlight so much.

138
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,920
Always a pleasure
to see you too, general.

139
00:14:13,921 --> 00:14:15,380
What can I do for you?

140
00:14:15,464 --> 00:14:18,675
As you may know, there've
been unusual occurrences.

141
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:22,596
Officially, we've downplayed their
significance, but we're concerned...

142
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:27,601
...these anomalies might pose a
credible threat to our national security.

143
00:14:28,185 --> 00:14:32,022
These were taken by one of our
spy satellites three days ago.

144
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:37,945
- What is it?
- We hoped Dr. Richards could tell us.

145
00:14:38,737 --> 00:14:41,907
I'm afraid I've never
seen anything like it. Ben?

146
00:14:43,742 --> 00:14:47,829
I would say that it was a meteor,
but the trail's all wrong.

147
00:14:47,913 --> 00:14:50,207
It's giving off its own energy.

148
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,875
Take a look at this.

149
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:56,088
These have been appearing in
remote areas throughout the world.

150
00:14:56,171 --> 00:14:59,800
Field personnel estimate its diameter
to be 200 meters.

151
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:05,222
To find out what this is about, we need
a way to locate and intercept that object.

152
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:09,685
A sensor could be tied into
the Baxter Building's satellite grid.

153
00:15:09,768 --> 00:15:12,271
We can pinpoint the location
of the object.

154
00:15:12,354 --> 00:15:16,858
- Good. You'll build the sensor for us...
- I'm afraid I can't.

155
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:19,486
What?

156
00:15:20,904 --> 00:15:24,908
I'm getting married this Saturday.
I just don't have the time.

157
00:15:26,868 --> 00:15:30,247
Richards, your country
needs your help.

158
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,543
Call Professor Jeff Wagner.

159
00:15:34,626 --> 00:15:37,337
He's head of the
Physics Department at Brown.

160
00:15:37,421 --> 00:15:39,506
I expected more, Richards.

161
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:42,634
Even from you.

162
00:15:56,023 --> 00:15:58,775
John Storm,
Fantastic Four Incorporated.

163
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:01,987
- Ever done any modeling?
- Not interested.

164
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:05,198
- You got an amazing complexion.
- Not interested.

165
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:10,912
Wow, and you just walked away.

166
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:13,874
I was definitely still talking.

167
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:17,836
I can't believe you just turned down
a science project.

168
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:21,465
They can build a sensor without me.

169
00:16:21,923 --> 00:16:24,593
The most important thing right now
is our wedding.

170
00:16:24,676 --> 00:16:26,803
No postponements. No interruptions.

171
00:16:26,887 --> 00:16:28,430
Thank you.

172
00:16:28,513 --> 00:16:31,808
And, look, about what you saw
back at the bar...

173
00:16:31,892 --> 00:16:34,770
Don't worry about it. I know you.

174
00:16:36,521 --> 00:16:38,357
I'm glad you had fun.

175
00:16:39,191 --> 00:16:40,567
Thank you.

176
00:16:41,485 --> 00:16:42,944
Besides...

177
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:47,699
...it was nothing compared to what
I did at my bachelorette party.

178
00:16:48,742 --> 00:16:50,410
Talk about wild.

179
00:16:52,537 --> 00:16:53,664
Wild?

180
00:17:04,132 --> 00:17:05,425
Come on.

181
00:17:37,749 --> 00:17:40,127
Hey, what are you doing up here?

182
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:43,505
Nothing. Just needed some air.

183
00:17:43,922 --> 00:17:47,509
You're making that thing
for the general, aren't you?

184
00:17:47,592 --> 00:17:50,095
I'm guessing Susie
doesn't know anything about it.

185
00:17:50,178 --> 00:17:52,889
Don't worry, my lips are sealed.

186
00:17:53,974 --> 00:17:56,643
That is, they would be if I had any.

187
00:17:57,185 --> 00:17:59,229
Look, don't tell Johnny.

188
00:18:00,731 --> 00:18:03,400
- Don't tell Johnny what?
- Great.

189
00:18:03,859 --> 00:18:06,403
- Are you building that thing?
- No.

190
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:09,156
If Sue finds out, you'll get
an invisible kick in the nuts.

191
00:18:09,239 --> 00:18:12,242
- Hey, hey. We're keeping this quiet.
- I know.

192
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:14,077
Don't worry.

193
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:18,915
It's the wedding of the century.
Reed Richards and Susan Storm...

194
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:22,586
<i>...Mr. Fantastic
and the Invisible Woman...</i>

195
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:26,965
<i>...will try again to tie the knot today
in a ceremony in New York.</i>

196
00:18:37,392 --> 00:18:40,896
- Look at these parasites.
- I know, it's unbelievable.

197
00:18:40,979 --> 00:18:42,814
Have they no shame?

198
00:18:45,734 --> 00:18:48,278
Hey! Hey, listen! Listen, everybody!

199
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:52,616
This is a very special day for my sister,
probably the most important of her life.

200
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:56,536
So I just want to say to you guys,
please respect our privacy.

201
00:18:56,912 --> 00:18:58,580
Come on, Johnny.

202
00:18:59,206 --> 00:19:02,584
Just kidding. We're auctioning off
the exclusive wedding photos...

203
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:07,005
...to the highest bidder, so go online
and place your bids. Thank you.

204
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,757
Johnny, are you planning...?

205
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,384
So, what's it take to date
the Human Torch?

206
00:19:11,468 --> 00:19:15,722
- Fireproof lingerie and a lot of aloe.
- Thank you.

207
00:19:30,278 --> 00:19:32,489
- Are you all right?
- How are you?

208
00:19:35,951 --> 00:19:37,661
Invitation, sir?

209
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:39,621
I should be on that list.

210
00:19:39,704 --> 00:19:41,540
- Name?
- Stan Lee.

211
00:19:41,665 --> 00:19:43,208
Yeah, nice try, buddy.

212
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,293
- No, really. I'm Stan Lee.
- Nice try.

213
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:51,842
This isn't how I imagined it.

214
00:19:52,384 --> 00:19:53,969
It never is.

215
00:19:54,052 --> 00:19:57,764
No, Alicia, it just doesn't feel right.

216
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:01,351
Sweetie...

217
00:20:02,978 --> 00:20:07,107
...I think even superheroes are allowed
to have wedding-day jitters.

218
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:10,902
It's more than that.
Is my life always gonna be a circus?

219
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:14,781
Do we really want to raise kids
in all this?

220
00:20:14,906 --> 00:20:17,367
Face it, we're not exactly normal.

221
00:20:18,702 --> 00:20:20,579
Ben and I aren't normal...

222
00:20:20,662 --> 00:20:24,374
...but we don't let it
get in the way of us being happy.

223
00:20:26,376 --> 00:20:28,044
Do you love Reed?

224
00:20:29,045 --> 00:20:31,590
More than I've ever loved anyone.

225
00:20:33,091 --> 00:20:35,677
Then you have nothing
to worry about.

226
00:20:38,346 --> 00:20:39,764
Thank you.

227
00:20:49,274 --> 00:20:50,525
Okay.

228
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:53,987
- Oh, great.
- What?

229
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,238
I've got a zit.

230
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:58,408
- Can't you put makeup on it?
- No, no, I got it.

231
00:20:59,367 --> 00:21:00,952
Crisis averted.

232
00:21:01,036 --> 00:21:04,915
Now all I have to do is concentrate
on the area for the next eight hours.

233
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:12,505
Reed, come on. You're gonna miss
your own wedding.

234
00:21:12,589 --> 00:21:14,090
Just a minute.

235
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:16,927
Almost done.

236
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:23,475
General, I'm putting
the sensor online now.

237
00:21:31,274 --> 00:21:35,403
There. If there's a surge in cosmic
radiation anywhere, you'll know.

238
00:21:35,487 --> 00:21:38,740
<i>Let's hope so. We've gotten
reports of two more craters.</i>

239
00:21:38,823 --> 00:21:40,450
♪ <i>Here comes the bride</i>

240
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:43,203
All right. Just linking it to my PDA.

241
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:46,456
- Reed.
- And that's it.

242
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,876
Good, that's great.
Now shave and put on your tux.

243
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,337
You're getting married
and you look like a bum.

244
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,838
Absolutely.

245
00:21:56,216 --> 00:21:57,384
What?

246
00:22:00,804 --> 00:22:02,639
I'm getting married.

247
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,561
Oh, jeez.

248
00:22:09,813 --> 00:22:11,648
I'm getting married.

249
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:16,152
I heard of getting cold feet...

250
00:22:21,825 --> 00:22:23,034
Okay.

251
00:22:24,077 --> 00:22:25,578
Hey, Johnny.

252
00:22:27,747 --> 00:22:31,418
Does that amaze anyone else?
How did she know it was me?

253
00:22:31,501 --> 00:22:34,295
To be honest,
you kind of smell like ash.

254
00:22:35,005 --> 00:22:37,841
- You're late.
- Let's not make today about me.

255
00:22:37,924 --> 00:22:39,592
It's Reed and Sue's big day.

256
00:22:39,676 --> 00:22:42,429
Let's give them the attention
for a change.

257
00:22:42,512 --> 00:22:44,180
Don't do that.

258
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,851
- Okay, you're perfect.
- You're perfect.

259
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,107
I'll see you upstairs.

260
00:22:55,275 --> 00:22:56,776
Bye, Johnny.

261
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:02,824
So seems like you and Alicia are
doing well. Annoyingly so, in fact.

262
00:23:03,241 --> 00:23:05,326
Yeah, I'm a lucky guy.

263
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,953
Yeah, you are.

264
00:23:07,954 --> 00:23:09,998
Question for you, though:

265
00:23:10,248 --> 00:23:11,958
How do you guys... 5'

266
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:18,757
- None of your business!
- Okay, I'm just concerned.

267
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,968
I'd hate to find out
she was killed in a rock slide.

268
00:23:22,052 --> 00:23:23,803
I'll show you a rock slide!

269
00:23:43,448 --> 00:23:45,325
What are you?

270
00:23:56,002 --> 00:23:57,378
Thank you.

271
00:23:59,798 --> 00:24:01,049
Johnny?

272
00:24:02,133 --> 00:24:04,177
You shouldn't tease him so much.

273
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,762
It was a joke.

274
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:10,100
I don't know, I think it bothers you
to see him really happy and in love.

275
00:24:10,183 --> 00:24:12,102
I think you're jealous.

276
00:24:12,477 --> 00:24:16,272
You think I'm jealous?
Have you seen the women I've dated?

277
00:24:16,648 --> 00:24:17,774
No.

278
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,696
You can only fool yourself
but for so long, Torch.

279
00:24:25,782 --> 00:24:28,701
Hey. It's the bride of stretchy man.

280
00:24:28,785 --> 00:24:31,704
- Don't start.
- Don't listen to him. You look gorgeous.

281
00:24:31,788 --> 00:24:33,540
We'll see you out there, sweetie.

282
00:24:33,623 --> 00:24:36,626
- Come on. We're on.
- Okay. Okay.

283
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:44,008
You don't look completely
ridiculous in that dress.

284
00:24:44,342 --> 00:24:48,054
Is that obnoxious-brother talk
for "You look kind of nice"?

285
00:24:49,264 --> 00:24:51,057
You look beautiful.

286
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,436
Thank you.

287
00:25:10,577 --> 00:25:12,495
Dad would be proud.

288
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:16,249
Yeah.

289
00:25:41,608 --> 00:25:43,610
Reed, shut your cell phone off.

290
00:25:43,693 --> 00:25:45,528
Actually, this is a...

291
00:26:25,944 --> 00:26:29,322
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today to...

292
00:26:31,491 --> 00:26:34,661
<i>Sue and Reed,
congratulations on your wedding!</i>

293
00:26:36,788 --> 00:26:38,790
Where was I? Oh, yeah.

294
00:26:38,957 --> 00:26:43,211
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
here today to join this couple...

295
00:26:43,294 --> 00:26:45,880
...Reed Richards and Susan Storm,
together...

296
00:26:49,717 --> 00:26:52,720
...in the bond of holy...

297
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:56,599
...matrimony.

298
00:26:57,058 --> 00:26:59,602
I can't believe you
brought that to our wedding.

299
00:26:59,686 --> 00:27:01,813
I know, but there's a good reason.

300
00:27:01,896 --> 00:27:04,941
- We have to do this quickly.
- That's romantic.

301
00:27:05,775 --> 00:27:08,194
- Should I continue?
- Yes, please.

302
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:13,408
- There are many kinds of love.
- Could you skip to the end, please?

303
00:27:13,491 --> 00:27:15,493
- Reed.
- Excuse me?

304
00:27:25,086 --> 00:27:27,422
- What happened?
- What's going on?

305
00:27:39,684 --> 00:27:43,104
We've lost power!
We're going down! We're going down!

306
00:27:43,938 --> 00:27:45,523
It's too late.

307
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:55,575
- Pull up!
- I'm trying! I'm trying!

308
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:14,135
Ben!

309
00:28:27,357 --> 00:28:29,692
- Johnny.
- This is Dolce.

310
00:28:33,613 --> 00:28:35,031
Flame on!

311
00:28:51,089 --> 00:28:52,757
Man, he's fast.

312
00:29:05,103 --> 00:29:06,646
That is cool.

313
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:20,827
- Hey, taxi!
- Oh, man!

314
00:29:36,259 --> 00:29:37,677
Showoff.

315
00:30:07,915 --> 00:30:09,709
Time to end this.

316
00:30:14,255 --> 00:30:15,798
Can we talk?

317
00:30:25,766 --> 00:30:28,144
Okay, you win.

318
00:30:37,111 --> 00:30:39,280
Flame on! Come on!

319
00:30:39,864 --> 00:30:41,365
Flame on!

320
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,848
Hey.

321
00:31:18,444 --> 00:31:20,655
Your herald summons you.

322
00:31:21,322 --> 00:31:23,407
Another world awaits.

323
00:31:24,992 --> 00:31:26,953
Let it be done quickly.

324
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:37,046
It looked like a man, but completely
covered in silver, and it flew this, like...

325
00:31:37,547 --> 00:31:40,049
...surfboard-type thing.
I know that sounds crazy.

326
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:42,134
Oh, no, not at all.

327
00:31:42,426 --> 00:31:46,222
Did you follow the shiny man to
Lollipop Land or the Rainbow Junction?

328
00:31:46,305 --> 00:31:49,850
- I know what I saw.
- Thank you. It's all right, Johnny.

329
00:31:50,351 --> 00:31:54,897
Whatever this thing is, it has the ability
to convert matter and energy.

330
00:31:54,981 --> 00:31:56,816
So it caused the anomalies?

331
00:31:56,941 --> 00:31:59,944
It seems to radiate cosmic energy
when it exerts itself...

332
00:32:00,027 --> 00:32:04,448
...randomly affecting matter.
Evidently, this entity, this...

333
00:32:06,158 --> 00:32:07,994
...Silver Surfer...

334
00:32:08,995 --> 00:32:12,582
...didn't want to be detected.
It destroyed the sensor.

335
00:32:12,873 --> 00:32:16,085
- It knew it was being monitored?
- And traced it back here.

336
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:19,338
We're dealing with something
highly resourceful.

337
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:23,593
Are you feeling okay?

338
00:32:23,676 --> 00:32:26,554
Yeah. I just... I gotta walk this off.

339
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:33,436
We must destroy it
before it attacks again.

340
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,439
Richards, find me
another way to track it.

341
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:44,780
Sue, I am so sorry.

342
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:48,200
I didn't tell you, because I
didn't want you to worry.

343
00:32:48,284 --> 00:32:51,454
I'm not mad you built the sensor.
You did the right thing.

344
00:32:51,537 --> 00:32:52,997
Oh, great.

345
00:32:56,167 --> 00:32:57,835
I wasn't finished.

346
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,507
Okay. Sorry. Please continue.

347
00:33:03,591 --> 00:33:06,218
This proves what I've been saying.

348
00:33:06,302 --> 00:33:07,637
Could you drop the force field?

349
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,722
We can't even... Sorry.

350
00:33:10,723 --> 00:33:13,309
Even our wedding
turns into World War lll.

351
00:33:13,392 --> 00:33:17,563
I know. But once we are married,
everything will be back to normal.

352
00:33:17,647 --> 00:33:21,567
We will never have normal lives
as long as we do what we do.

353
00:33:21,901 --> 00:33:25,071
How could we possibly
raise a family like this?

354
00:33:28,449 --> 00:33:30,701
I'm gonna go check on Johnny.

355
00:33:44,382 --> 00:33:45,675
Johnny?

356
00:33:52,848 --> 00:33:54,975
Hey, are you all right, pal?

357
00:33:56,769 --> 00:33:58,604
Are you all right?

358
00:34:01,232 --> 00:34:02,566
Johnny?

359
00:34:03,109 --> 00:34:05,403
Johnny, are you okay?

360
00:34:05,486 --> 00:34:09,907
I don't know. I've been feeling really
strange since my run-in with surfer boy.

361
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:12,618
Maybe we should get you checked out.

362
00:34:13,911 --> 00:34:16,414
- Why did you do that?
- I didn't do anything!

363
00:34:16,497 --> 00:34:18,624
Stop, drop and roll!
Stop, drop and roll!

364
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:22,253
Oh, my God, Sue! Just...

365
00:34:23,003 --> 00:34:25,589
Just hang on! I'll get you, okay?

366
00:34:26,674 --> 00:34:27,967
Flame on!

367
00:34:29,218 --> 00:34:30,761
Hey, watch it.

368
00:34:35,516 --> 00:34:36,767
Reed!

369
00:34:36,851 --> 00:34:39,145
Reed! Reed!

370
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:40,521
Help!
- 'Sue?

371
00:34:40,604 --> 00:34:42,148
I'm on fire!

372
00:34:42,898 --> 00:34:45,985
- Sue! What's going on?
- I'm on fire!

373
00:34:46,068 --> 00:34:48,195
- You're on fire!
- You think?

374
00:34:48,279 --> 00:34:50,489
- Hold on!
- Pull me in!

375
00:34:53,534 --> 00:34:55,619
Hey, it's the Human Torch!

376
00:34:56,162 --> 00:34:57,204
Johnny!

377
00:34:57,288 --> 00:34:59,874
- I'm not Johnny!
- Sue, how did this happen?

378
00:34:59,957 --> 00:35:02,585
I touched Johnny, and then this.

379
00:35:02,668 --> 00:35:04,670
- Where is Johnny?
- Here.

380
00:35:05,504 --> 00:35:07,173
Try it again.

381
00:35:12,011 --> 00:35:13,929
- Nice.
- There you go.

382
00:35:14,013 --> 00:35:15,973
Hey, get out of there.

383
00:35:16,223 --> 00:35:18,017
Sue, your clothes.

384
00:35:19,852 --> 00:35:22,313
Why does this always happen to me?

385
00:35:23,481 --> 00:35:25,691
All of Sue's results are normal.

386
00:35:25,775 --> 00:35:27,526
But Johnny's...

387
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:29,361
Johnny's are what?

388
00:35:29,779 --> 00:35:34,700
Your encounter with the Surfer put your
molecules in a constant state of flux.

389
00:35:37,453 --> 00:35:38,913
Is that bad?

390
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:42,625
It caused you to temporarily
switch powers with Sue.

391
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:45,628
- I'd like to run more tests and...
- Want a volunteer?

392
00:35:45,711 --> 00:35:46,921
- No, no, hey!
- No, no, no!

393
00:35:47,004 --> 00:35:49,381
No, no, hey! This is serious!

394
00:35:50,216 --> 00:35:51,801
I just wanted to give him a hug.

395
00:35:51,884 --> 00:35:53,969
We don't know the extent
of his condition.

396
00:35:54,053 --> 00:35:55,805
It could be progressive.

397
00:35:55,888 --> 00:35:57,973
- It could be fun.
- No, Ben!

398
00:35:58,057 --> 00:35:59,225
Ben!

399
00:35:59,975 --> 00:36:03,145
Hey. Hey, it's me! I'm back!

400
00:36:12,279 --> 00:36:14,240
Oh, my God!

401
00:36:15,616 --> 00:36:18,327
Come on!
We just said this is serious!

402
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,162
Oh, yeah, serious.

403
00:36:22,248 --> 00:36:24,375
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

404
00:36:26,794 --> 00:36:29,171
- Hey, not bad.
- Incredible.

405
00:36:29,255 --> 00:36:32,424
- You better be able to fix this!
- I'm right on it.

406
00:36:33,509 --> 00:36:36,345
- Ben, stop it!
- I see why you like that.

407
00:36:37,596 --> 00:36:39,431
Oh, no, no, no.

408
00:36:42,393 --> 00:36:43,435
Crap.

409
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:46,689
That's not funny. What am I
supposed to do in the meantime?

410
00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:49,441
Just try to keep
your distance from us.

411
00:36:51,819 --> 00:36:56,031
You and me are gonna be spending
a whole lot of time together, pal!

412
00:37:05,666 --> 00:37:09,086
<i>My inside sources tell me
unlucky bride-to-be Sue Storm...</i>

413
00:37:09,169 --> 00:37:12,047
<i>...turned in visible
and is staying that</i> way...

414
00:37:12,131 --> 00:37:14,717
<i>...after yesterday's
embarrassing fiasco.</i>

415
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,721
<i>Next, the Invisible Woman's
greatest fashion blunders...</i>

416
00:37:18,804 --> 00:37:23,225
<i>...and an impromptu dance routine
from former scientist Reed Richards.</i>

417
00:37:24,351 --> 00:37:27,521
Why do you keep watching this?
Just ignore it.

418
00:37:27,605 --> 00:37:30,900
I can't ignore it, Reed.
There's no getting away from it!

419
00:37:30,983 --> 00:37:33,110
- I believe there is.
- How?

420
00:37:34,987 --> 00:37:37,114
See? No answer.

421
00:37:41,076 --> 00:37:42,786
Yes, there is.

422
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:45,748
What if, after this crisis is over...

423
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:50,961
...we leave it all behind?
- What are you talking about?

424
00:37:51,045 --> 00:37:53,464
We move out of the Baxter Building.

425
00:37:53,547 --> 00:37:55,841
I'll take a teaching position
somewhere.

426
00:37:55,925 --> 00:37:57,927
Get back to my research.

427
00:37:58,218 --> 00:38:02,681
The two of us will live our lives
and raise a family, like normal people.

428
00:38:03,057 --> 00:38:04,725
You would do that?

429
00:38:05,142 --> 00:38:08,729
Nothing is more important to me
than our future together.

430
00:38:09,897 --> 00:38:11,523
Oh, thank you.

431
00:38:17,863 --> 00:38:19,990
What about Ben and Johnny?

432
00:38:20,282 --> 00:38:22,034
They'll understand.

433
00:38:22,368 --> 00:38:25,663
Besides, Johnny's always
been more of a solo act.

434
00:38:26,246 --> 00:38:28,332
Let's not mention it to them yet.

435
00:38:28,415 --> 00:38:32,711
Johnny's got enough to worry about
as it is, with his power problems.

436
00:39:31,353 --> 00:39:33,689
You've been busy, my friend.

437
00:39:33,772 --> 00:39:36,108
Your talents are impressive.

438
00:39:39,236 --> 00:39:41,905
Can you understand what I'm saying?

439
00:39:44,533 --> 00:39:47,286
Together, we could be unstoppable.

440
00:39:48,203 --> 00:39:50,914
Anything would be ours for the taking.

441
00:39:51,874 --> 00:39:54,460
All that you know is at an end.

442
00:39:55,878 --> 00:39:58,088
What do you mean by that?

443
00:39:58,172 --> 00:40:01,091
Wait! I said, wait!

444
00:40:25,699 --> 00:40:29,369
They're breaking up the team.
Reed and Sue, I overheard them.

445
00:40:29,453 --> 00:40:31,705
They want a nice, normal,
boring-ass life.

446
00:40:31,789 --> 00:40:34,083
- No more Fantastic Four.
- Well...

447
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:37,044
...what do we do?
Keep going, just the two of us?

448
00:40:37,127 --> 00:40:39,963
And call ourselves what?
The Dynamic Duo?

449
00:40:40,464 --> 00:40:42,424
When were they gonna tell us?

450
00:40:42,508 --> 00:40:44,885
They'll tell you when they're ready.

451
00:40:44,968 --> 00:40:47,221
It's their decision, not yours.

452
00:40:47,304 --> 00:40:50,933
You can't be mad at them
for doing what makes them happy.

453
00:40:52,309 --> 00:40:53,602
Guys.

454
00:40:54,436 --> 00:40:56,188
We've got a serious problem.

455
00:40:56,647 --> 00:41:01,110
I cross-referenced the Surfer's radiation
through every astronomical database.

456
00:41:01,193 --> 00:41:04,613
Altair 7, Rigel 3, Vega 6.

457
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:07,741
- He's been to all these planets?
- And now they're lifeless.

458
00:41:07,825 --> 00:41:10,285
Barren. Some even shattered.

459
00:41:10,369 --> 00:41:14,414
Everywhere the Surfer goes,
eight days later, the planet dies.

460
00:41:17,209 --> 00:41:19,253
How are we gonna stop him?

461
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:22,047
We don't even know where he is.

462
00:41:24,341 --> 00:41:26,343
What about the craters?

463
00:41:31,723 --> 00:41:33,976
They appear in a numerical sequence.

464
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:36,895
The last crater was formed
in Greenland...

465
00:41:37,729 --> 00:41:40,023
...so the next in the sequence
should be...

466
00:41:40,107 --> 00:41:43,110
...latitude 51 degrees,
30 minutes north...

467
00:41:43,193 --> 00:41:47,656
...longitude zero degrees,
seven minutes west.

468
00:42:00,377 --> 00:42:03,422
When he surfaces, move the fight
away from the crowd.

469
00:42:03,505 --> 00:42:06,717
He's too fast to contain.
When I see silver, I'm hitting him!

470
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,803
You can't do that. We stick to the plan
and work as a team.

471
00:42:09,887 --> 00:42:11,722
Oh, we're a team now?
News to me.

472
00:42:11,805 --> 00:42:14,725
- What are you talking about?
- You know what.

473
00:42:14,808 --> 00:42:15,934
We were gonna tell you.

474
00:42:16,018 --> 00:42:20,272
- When? When you moved our stuff out?
- Johnny, this isn't a good time.

475
00:42:20,355 --> 00:42:22,733
Kid's got a point, Reed.
You should have told us.

476
00:42:22,816 --> 00:42:25,319
That's enough!
We'll talk about this later.

477
00:42:25,402 --> 00:42:28,363
What the hell is wrong
with you people?

478
00:42:34,786 --> 00:42:36,496
It's a whirlpool!

479
00:42:36,788 --> 00:42:38,165
Oh, my God.

480
00:42:45,422 --> 00:42:46,965
What is that?

481
00:43:03,565 --> 00:43:05,317
Get out! Get out!

482
00:43:25,379 --> 00:43:27,047
Don't let go!

483
00:43:38,225 --> 00:43:40,143
- Move!
- Come on! Go!

484
00:43:56,994 --> 00:43:58,370
No, Johnny!

485
00:44:18,056 --> 00:44:20,767
Guys? What are you doing?

486
00:44:28,567 --> 00:44:30,569
Ben! Lift it higher!

487
00:44:30,652 --> 00:44:31,987
I'll try.

488
00:45:03,935 --> 00:45:05,103
Sue!

489
00:45:11,651 --> 00:45:14,488
Stay back,
before you get somebody killed.

490
00:45:17,407 --> 00:45:19,201
Oh, my God.

491
00:45:39,888 --> 00:45:41,556
What the hell was that?

492
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,309
We'll make adjustments.
Next time, we'll be ready.

493
00:45:44,393 --> 00:45:47,646
Next time? There's no next time.

494
00:45:48,563 --> 00:45:51,900
You can't handle this alone.
I'm bringing in help.

495
00:45:51,983 --> 00:45:56,071
Bringing in soldiers and weaponry
will put innocent people in danger.

496
00:45:56,154 --> 00:45:58,448
No more than you already have.

497
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:04,913
Victor?

498
00:46:05,497 --> 00:46:08,083
What's the matter?
Afraid of ghosts?

499
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,003
- Look out!
- Don't move!

500
00:46:12,337 --> 00:46:16,216
Since you're a ghost,
you won't mind if I break your neck.

501
00:46:16,299 --> 00:46:18,009
- Let him go.
- You know who that is?

502
00:46:18,093 --> 00:46:21,012
Victor von Doom.
He's here under my orders.

503
00:46:27,853 --> 00:46:29,521
Ben, let him go.

504
00:46:32,649 --> 00:46:34,526
How is this possible?

505
00:46:36,695 --> 00:46:38,530
How are you still alive?

506
00:46:38,613 --> 00:46:41,575
No thanks to you four,
that's for certain.

507
00:46:42,159 --> 00:46:46,288
Von Doom's made contact with the
alien. He's got valuable information.

508
00:46:46,371 --> 00:46:49,541
Information that might just
help save the planet.

509
00:46:49,833 --> 00:46:51,626
Now let's be clear about this...

510
00:46:51,877 --> 00:46:54,546
...shall we? I hate you.

511
00:46:57,257 --> 00:46:58,717
All of you.

512
00:46:59,801 --> 00:47:04,389
But the world's at stake and we
need to work together to survive.

513
00:47:05,307 --> 00:47:09,478
General, we know firsthand, you trust
Victor and you're gonna regret it.

514
00:47:09,561 --> 00:47:13,815
So far, the only one I've regretted
trusting here is you, Richards.

515
00:47:15,734 --> 00:47:17,819
Reed, don't agree to this.

516
00:47:23,575 --> 00:47:25,118
Let's see what he's got.

517
00:47:25,744 --> 00:47:28,830
I made a detailed recording
of our little encounter.

518
00:47:29,498 --> 00:47:32,042
<i>All that you know is at an end.</i>

519
00:47:35,045 --> 00:47:36,338
Well?

520
00:47:36,421 --> 00:47:39,633
I like the part where
he knocks you on your ass.

521
00:47:42,594 --> 00:47:46,264
Look at where the energy levels surge
when he attacks me.

522
00:47:48,517 --> 00:47:50,602
There? See what happened?

523
00:47:53,313 --> 00:47:57,150
The energy was channeled through him,
but it originated from his board.

524
00:47:57,234 --> 00:48:01,821
If we can separate him from the board,
we can cutoff his power completely.

525
00:48:02,447 --> 00:48:04,533
- That's what we have to do.
- How?

526
00:48:04,616 --> 00:48:08,078
If I knew that,
I wouldn't need you people, would I?

527
00:48:10,288 --> 00:48:13,041
You two should
get started right away.

528
00:48:18,797 --> 00:48:22,217
I'm glad we have the opportunity
to collaborate again.

529
00:48:23,426 --> 00:48:26,263
I'll try to talk slowly
so you can keep up.

530
00:48:33,353 --> 00:48:35,355
How can we be working
on the same side as Victor?

531
00:48:35,438 --> 00:48:39,651
You got me. Things were simpler
when I could just whale on the guy.

532
00:48:40,402 --> 00:48:42,445
What's he doing? A fire.

533
00:48:42,821 --> 00:48:44,322
Look at that.

534
00:48:48,118 --> 00:48:49,786
I'll pay for that.

535
00:48:51,288 --> 00:48:54,833
I'll tell you, Ben, I'm starting
to feel like a complete screw-up.

536
00:48:54,916 --> 00:48:57,711
Hey, hey, you're not
a complete screw-up.

537
00:48:58,003 --> 00:48:59,004
Thank you.

538
00:48:59,087 --> 00:49:03,592
Look, kid, it's out of our hands.
It's up to the eggheads now.

539
00:49:04,175 --> 00:49:08,096
You think Reed's right about
the whole end-of-the-world thing?

540
00:49:08,722 --> 00:49:11,975
He's never been wrong
about this kind of thing before.

541
00:49:12,058 --> 00:49:15,228
You know, I'm not exactly
a deep kind of guy.

542
00:49:15,312 --> 00:49:16,521
Really?

543
00:49:18,231 --> 00:49:20,900
But if Reed's right, and this is it...

544
00:49:24,404 --> 00:49:27,407
...how do you want
to spend your last few minutes?

545
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:30,285
Part of me would like
to go out fighting.

546
00:49:32,829 --> 00:49:34,539
But the truth is...

547
00:49:34,789 --> 00:49:38,710
...I'd like to spend my last
couple of minutes holding Alicia.

548
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:42,631
That sounds pretty good.

549
00:49:42,922 --> 00:49:46,718
I mean, not the "holding Alicia" thing.
She's your girlfriend, not mine.

550
00:49:46,801 --> 00:49:49,471
Want nothing to do with her.
Not to say she's not attractive.

551
00:49:49,554 --> 00:49:53,016
She's very attractive.
She's so attractive.

552
00:49:53,391 --> 00:49:57,354
Even with the... I can't think of
a guy that wouldn't want to...

553
00:49:59,189 --> 00:50:00,899
What I meant...

554
00:50:01,399 --> 00:50:04,110
...was that it's nice
to have somebody.

555
00:50:06,237 --> 00:50:08,865
Well, you got me, pal.

556
00:50:24,631 --> 00:50:26,132
How's it going?

557
00:50:26,216 --> 00:50:28,051
I can't find a link.

558
00:50:28,551 --> 00:50:30,762
- It'll be all right.
- No, it won't!

559
00:50:30,845 --> 00:50:34,057
The whole world's
counting on me, and I just...

560
00:50:34,891 --> 00:50:37,560
Reed, you're gonna find the answer.

561
00:50:37,644 --> 00:50:39,354
- You always do.
- Thanks, Sue.

562
00:50:39,437 --> 00:50:41,314
- You just need to relax.
- Yeah, right.

563
00:50:41,398 --> 00:50:44,526
You do. Reed, you need to relax.

564
00:50:45,902 --> 00:50:47,612
Take a deep breath.

565
00:50:48,738 --> 00:50:49,948
Slower.

566
00:50:50,615 --> 00:50:52,200
There you go.

567
00:50:53,618 --> 00:50:55,453
Come on. Again.

568
00:50:57,956 --> 00:51:01,876
See? I can already
feel your pulse slowing down.

569
00:51:04,379 --> 00:51:07,132
- Do you remember that time...?
- A pulse.

570
00:51:09,759 --> 00:51:11,386
A tachyon pulse.

571
00:51:12,095 --> 00:51:13,513
I love you.

572
00:51:14,431 --> 00:51:15,890
I'm glad I could help.

573
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:39,038
So exactly how does this thing work?

574
00:51:39,122 --> 00:51:42,208
When we activate the field,
it'll separate him from his board...

575
00:51:42,292 --> 00:51:45,503
...making him powerless.
- Like a fish in a net.

576
00:51:46,004 --> 00:51:47,505
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

577
00:51:47,922 --> 00:51:51,217
- In theory, anyway.
- How long until it's operational?

578
00:51:51,301 --> 00:51:53,344
- Three hours.
- Three hours.

579
00:51:53,595 --> 00:51:56,890
I can only go so fast,
since I'm working by myself.

580
00:51:56,973 --> 00:52:00,685
- What do you need to make this happen?
- There are a couple of things.

581
00:52:00,769 --> 00:52:04,022
Do your field engineers
have a beryllium casing?

582
00:52:14,199 --> 00:52:15,992
What are you doing?

583
00:52:17,243 --> 00:52:20,288
- Don't you knock?
- You're supposed to be helping Reed.

584
00:52:20,371 --> 00:52:21,790
Tell him not to worry.

585
00:52:21,873 --> 00:52:26,211
I'll be there to hold his hand
and finish his little project for him.

586
00:52:29,881 --> 00:52:32,300
- Anything else?
- How'd you do it?

587
00:52:35,303 --> 00:52:37,222
How did you come back?

588
00:52:40,475 --> 00:52:42,560
It scares you, doesn't it?

589
00:52:45,146 --> 00:52:46,981
The things I can do.

590
00:52:47,607 --> 00:52:50,109
Did you know I could create
a force field inside someone's body...

591
00:52:50,193 --> 00:52:52,904
...and expand it until they explode?

592
00:52:53,238 --> 00:52:55,281
Give it your best shot.

593
00:52:59,577 --> 00:53:01,621
Just get back to the lab.

594
00:53:09,045 --> 00:53:10,672
Mr. Storm?

595
00:53:11,005 --> 00:53:14,551
We're heading to intercept the Surfer
in 10 minutes, with or without you.

596
00:53:14,634 --> 00:53:19,264
Were you waiting outside the bathroom
to try and catch me in a towel?

597
00:53:26,479 --> 00:53:28,773
That was a joke. I was joking.

598
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,610
Why are you so down on me?
You don't even know me.

599
00:53:32,694 --> 00:53:36,197
I know you very well.
I read your personality profile.

600
00:53:36,531 --> 00:53:39,075
Confident. Reckless. Irresponsible.

601
00:53:39,158 --> 00:53:41,828
Self-obsessed,
bordering on narcissism.

602
00:53:42,996 --> 00:53:44,205
Okay, so you do know me.

603
00:53:44,289 --> 00:53:47,792
All I've seen is a guy
that almost got his team killed.

604
00:53:48,918 --> 00:53:50,003
Okay.

605
00:53:51,087 --> 00:53:53,756
I've been a little off my game lately.

606
00:53:54,257 --> 00:53:56,092
This is not a game.

607
00:54:09,397 --> 00:54:12,692
- Sir, he's in position north of here.
- Good.

608
00:54:12,775 --> 00:54:15,778
- General, give us a one-mile perimeter.
- Forget it, Richards.

609
00:54:15,862 --> 00:54:19,032
You had your shot and you blew it.
This is a military operation now.

610
00:54:19,115 --> 00:54:22,660
Jam the signal, get out of the way,
and let us do our job.

611
00:54:22,744 --> 00:54:25,914
- You don't understand.
- No, you don't understand.

612
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:29,000
So let me make it clear for you
and your pack of freaks.

613
00:54:29,083 --> 00:54:32,003
I'm the quarterback.
You're on my team.

614
00:54:32,587 --> 00:54:33,963
Got it?

615
00:54:34,797 --> 00:54:39,344
But I guess you never played football
in high school, did you, Richards?

616
00:54:40,386 --> 00:54:42,680
No, you're right, I didn't.

617
00:54:42,764 --> 00:54:46,184
I stayed in and studied,
like a good little nerd.

618
00:54:47,477 --> 00:54:49,604
And fifteen years later...

619
00:54:49,938 --> 00:54:52,815
...I'm one of the greatest minds
of the 21st century.

620
00:54:52,899 --> 00:54:55,944
I'm engaged to the hottest girl
on the planet.

621
00:54:56,027 --> 00:54:59,072
And the jock who played quarterback
in high school...

622
00:54:59,155 --> 00:55:02,367
...is right in front of me,
asking me for my help.

623
00:55:02,784 --> 00:55:05,703
And I say he's not gonna
get a damn thing...

624
00:55:06,245 --> 00:55:08,915
...unless he does exactly
what I tell him to...

625
00:55:08,998 --> 00:55:12,710
...and starts treating my friends
and me with some respect.

626
00:55:21,761 --> 00:55:23,721
Give him what he wants.

627
00:55:25,974 --> 00:55:27,976
I am so hot for you right now.

628
00:55:28,059 --> 00:55:30,520
- Me too.
- Be careful, Johnny.

629
00:55:30,937 --> 00:55:33,189
All right, let's go to work.

630
00:55:43,866 --> 00:55:45,326
This is it.

631
00:55:45,743 --> 00:55:50,164
You have your coordinates. Set up
your posts and rendezvous back here.

632
00:56:02,093 --> 00:56:03,970
First squad, move out!

633
00:56:35,501 --> 00:56:41,049
Hey. You scared me there, Smokey.
Look at you. You're cute.

634
00:56:48,306 --> 00:56:51,309
Yeah, that's right.
Keep running, Boo Boo.

635
00:56:52,643 --> 00:56:54,562
Overgrown furball.

636
00:56:55,813 --> 00:56:58,733
<i>- What's our status?
- Yeah. I'm good to go.</i>

637
00:56:58,816 --> 00:57:00,902
- Same here.
- Almost there.

638
00:57:12,705 --> 00:57:13,998
Guys?

639
00:57:14,457 --> 00:57:17,043
<i>- We have a problem.
- What's wrong?</i>

640
00:57:17,126 --> 00:57:18,628
He's here.

641
00:57:19,879 --> 00:57:22,048
<i>Get out of there, right now!</i>

642
00:57:44,529 --> 00:57:47,073
Why are you destroying our planet?

643
00:57:48,074 --> 00:57:49,826
I have no choice.

644
00:57:50,451 --> 00:57:51,953
- Sue!
- Wait!

645
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:57,959
What do you mean,
you don't have a choice?

646
00:57:58,042 --> 00:58:00,044
There's always a choice.

647
00:58:01,212 --> 00:58:02,755
Not always.

648
00:58:04,549 --> 00:58:07,009
Why are you trying to destroy us?

649
00:58:07,426 --> 00:58:10,138
I am not the Destroyer.

650
00:58:11,139 --> 00:58:13,933
Come on, Richards.
Jam the damn signal.

651
00:58:14,016 --> 00:58:16,561
Maybe he needs a little persuasion.

652
00:58:17,895 --> 00:58:20,565
<i>- Fire one over the top.
- Roger, out.</i>

653
00:58:34,954 --> 00:58:36,080
- Open fire.
- Open fire.

654
00:58:36,164 --> 00:58:38,416
Open fire! Repeat, open fire!

655
00:58:46,757 --> 00:58:48,593
Fall back! Fall back!

656
00:58:51,929 --> 00:58:53,931
- Let me just...
- No, wait!

657
00:58:55,683 --> 00:58:56,893
Reed.

658
00:58:58,144 --> 00:58:59,645
Come on, Sue.

659
00:59:00,938 --> 00:59:02,732
All right, it's up.

660
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:04,317
Reed.

661
00:59:04,734 --> 00:59:06,110
Got him.

662
00:59:31,636 --> 00:59:34,472
Not so tough now, are you?

663
00:59:43,105 --> 00:59:44,941
Victor! Stay back!

664
00:59:46,484 --> 00:59:48,402
You're the quarterback.

665
01:00:05,753 --> 01:00:08,172
Eyes on!
Keep your weapons trained!

666
01:00:09,131 --> 01:00:11,092
- Perimeter secure!
- Move him out.

667
01:00:17,348 --> 01:00:20,476
- Open the gate!
- Get him to the debriefing room.

668
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:34,907
- We had an agreement.
- Calm down.

669
01:00:34,991 --> 01:00:36,909
The enemy has been captured.

670
01:00:36,993 --> 01:00:38,953
- Where is he?
- Contained.

671
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:40,913
General?

672
01:00:42,707 --> 01:00:44,166
Mr. Sherman.

673
01:00:46,544 --> 01:00:48,879
If you'll excuse us,
we have work to do.

674
01:00:48,963 --> 01:00:52,383
- I want to be there for the questioning.
- Not gonna happen.

675
01:00:52,466 --> 01:00:55,511
Make sure our guests remain here,
comfortably.

676
01:00:56,137 --> 01:00:57,555
Yes, sir.

677
01:00:59,807 --> 01:01:01,767
General, what about the board?

678
01:01:01,851 --> 01:01:05,479
It's in a chamber which
continuously scrambles the signal.

679
01:01:23,372 --> 01:01:25,374
There are certain things
I'm not permitted to do...

680
01:01:25,458 --> 01:01:28,669
...because they're considered
human-rights violations.

681
01:01:28,753 --> 01:01:31,339
Fortunately, you're not human.

682
01:01:38,262 --> 01:01:39,930
Are we prisoners?

683
01:01:40,181 --> 01:01:41,974
How did that happen?

684
01:01:42,808 --> 01:01:45,811
Apparently, they don't want us
interfering with their methods.

685
01:01:45,895 --> 01:01:48,272
I can't imagine what
they're doing to him.

686
01:01:48,356 --> 01:01:51,525
- I say he gets what he deserves.
- How can you say that?

687
01:01:51,609 --> 01:01:54,528
I'm just saying maybe
the general's right about this.

688
01:01:54,612 --> 01:01:57,698
The guy was about to destroy
the planet. He said so himself.

689
01:01:57,823 --> 01:02:02,578
It doesn't make sense. He protected me
from the missile. Why would he do that?

690
01:02:02,953 --> 01:02:04,121
Maybe he thinks you're cute.

691
01:02:04,205 --> 01:02:07,750
There's more going on.
He said he wasn't the Destroyer.

692
01:02:08,292 --> 01:02:09,919
Maybe he lied?

693
01:02:13,297 --> 01:02:16,258
We need to get inside there
and talk to him.

694
01:02:16,926 --> 01:02:18,719
But under the radar.

695
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:26,394
Is there any way
we could get some DVDs...

696
01:02:26,477 --> 01:02:28,479
...or popcorn or something?

697
01:02:28,562 --> 01:02:30,272
- I'll call it in.
- Great.

698
01:02:30,356 --> 01:02:32,024
Thank you. Semper fi.

699
01:02:32,108 --> 01:02:34,819
That's the Marine Corps.
We're the Army.

700
01:02:35,319 --> 01:02:37,571
Right, I know it's the Army.

701

<i>Captain Raye. Access granted.</i>

702
01:03:02,430 --> 01:03:03,681
General.

703
01:03:04,014 --> 01:03:06,434
Von Doom wants to speak with you.

704
01:03:07,059 --> 01:03:10,187
You should really be
a little more cooperative.

705
01:03:10,354 --> 01:03:13,065
Mr. Sherman, let's take a break.

706
01:03:31,375 --> 01:03:33,210
I know you are there.

707
01:03:45,556 --> 01:03:47,266
What's your name?

708
01:03:49,518 --> 01:03:51,812
Come on, you must have a name.

709
01:03:52,229 --> 01:03:53,772
I'm Susan.

710
01:03:58,486 --> 01:04:02,907
You said you weren't the one trying
to destroy our world. Then who is?

711
01:04:03,699 --> 01:04:06,202
- The one I serve.
- Who do you serve?

712
01:04:08,704 --> 01:04:13,751
I'm trying to help you, but to do that,
you have to tell me the truth.

713
01:04:14,502 --> 01:04:15,711
Please.

714
01:04:26,764 --> 01:04:30,559
It is known by many names.
My people called it...

715
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:33,103
...Galactus...

716
01:04:33,729 --> 01:04:35,856
...the Devourer of Worlds.

717
01:04:39,068 --> 01:04:41,987
It must feed on energy to survive.

718
01:04:43,072 --> 01:04:44,615
Both thermal...

719
01:04:45,241 --> 01:04:46,325
...and organic.

720
01:04:46,408 --> 01:04:48,118
How can you serve this thing?

721
01:04:48,202 --> 01:04:49,537
Because I must.

722
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:54,667
Doesn't it bother you, all the worlds and
innocent people you've helped destroy?

723
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:57,670
My service spares my world...

724
01:04:59,171 --> 01:05:01,257
...and the one I love.

725
01:05:03,801 --> 01:05:06,136
Why did you try to protect me?

726
01:05:07,346 --> 01:05:08,722
Because“.

727
01:05:09,932 --> 01:05:12,518
...You remind me of her.

728
01:05:27,658 --> 01:05:29,994
Could you stop the Destroyer
if you wanted to?

729
01:05:30,077 --> 01:05:33,914
It is not I who draws the Destroyer here.
It is the beacon.

730
01:05:34,248 --> 01:05:35,916
What's the beacon?

731
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,918
The source of my power.

732
01:05:38,419 --> 01:05:39,878
Your board?

733
01:05:43,841 --> 01:05:46,969
Take joy in the last few hours
you have left...

734
01:05:47,928 --> 01:05:49,930
...for he is nearly here.

735
01:06:07,031 --> 01:06:10,576
Well? I helped deliver
the alien to you, as promised.

736
01:06:10,909 --> 01:06:14,038
Now it's time to keep
your end of the bargain.

737
01:06:14,747 --> 01:06:17,416
You can do your tests on the board...

738
01:06:18,334 --> 01:06:21,754
...but under armed guard
and in my presence only.

739
01:06:22,338 --> 01:06:23,839
Absolutely.

740
01:06:31,221 --> 01:06:33,641
<i>General Hager. Access granted.</i>

741
01:06:57,373 --> 01:06:58,999
The board draws it here.

742
01:06:59,083 --> 01:07:01,126
How do you fight something
that eats planets?

743
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:04,004
We have to get to the board
and lead it away from here.

744
01:07:04,088 --> 01:07:07,508
Well, do you think the general
will go for that?

745
01:07:07,591 --> 01:07:08,884
He'll have no choice.

746
01:07:12,137 --> 01:07:13,931
Thank you, general.

747
01:07:14,598 --> 01:07:16,350
But I'm afraid...

748
01:07:16,809 --> 01:07:18,602
...the truth is...

749
01:07:18,686 --> 01:07:21,105
...sometimes Reed is right.

750
01:07:24,817 --> 01:07:26,068
What...?

751
01:07:38,831 --> 01:07:40,624
Hey, you. Come here.

752
01:07:41,375 --> 01:07:43,252
Let me ask you something.

753
01:08:45,397 --> 01:08:46,648
Nice.

754
01:08:51,737 --> 01:08:52,905
Crap.

755
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:01,038
Ben!

756
01:09:05,375 --> 01:09:07,377
Okay, that one hurt.

757
01:09:08,128 --> 01:09:10,756
- Where's Reed?
- Back here.

758
01:09:21,975 --> 01:09:23,310
My bad.

759
01:09:31,151 --> 01:09:32,402
Reed.

760
01:09:37,032 --> 01:09:39,576
Victor. We've gotta get it back.

761
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:42,830
We need to get the Surfer.
He understands its power.

762
01:09:42,913 --> 01:09:47,584
Even if we break him out of this place,
how are we gonna catch up to Victor?

763
01:09:48,335 --> 01:09:49,962
Leave that to me.

764
01:10:19,491 --> 01:10:21,910
- Halt!
- Stay where you are!

765
01:10:25,205 --> 01:10:28,375
Pal, this is the luckiest day
of your life.

766
01:10:31,795 --> 01:10:35,382
What the hell is going on?
Where is General Hager?

767
01:10:35,465 --> 01:10:36,592
He's dead.

768
01:10:36,675 --> 01:10:39,428
And if we don't get him out of here,
we'll all be.

769
01:10:39,511 --> 01:10:40,846
Frankie...

770
01:10:43,181 --> 01:10:47,060
...the world is literally at stake here.
You have to trust us.

771
01:10:49,229 --> 01:10:50,522
Please.

772
01:10:53,692 --> 01:10:56,570
We need to get to the roof.
It should be here by now.

773
01:10:56,653 --> 01:10:58,488
What should be here?

774
01:11:07,748 --> 01:11:09,374
Holy crap!

775
01:11:10,125 --> 01:11:11,376
Reed.

776
01:11:11,877 --> 01:11:15,213
This is by far the coolest thing
you have ever done.

777
01:11:24,431 --> 01:11:26,183
- Hemi?
- Of course.

778
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:30,270
Okay, Ben, you get inside.
Johnny, you fly behind us.

779
01:11:30,354 --> 01:11:33,774
- You gotta let me fly this.
- I'm the best pilot. I should drive.

780
01:11:33,857 --> 01:11:36,068
- Guys.
- You're lucky if it can carry you.

781
01:11:36,151 --> 01:11:38,236
- I can fly circles around you.
- Guys!

782
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:41,073
- Reed.
- Shut up! And move it!

783
01:11:41,865 --> 01:11:43,492
I'm driving.

784
01:11:46,536 --> 01:11:47,829
Flame on!

785
01:11:54,795 --> 01:11:59,424
Okay. We're now officially enemies
of the United States of America.

786
01:11:59,508 --> 01:12:02,386
Victor is out there somewhere
with unlimited power.

787
01:12:02,469 --> 01:12:05,097
And we've got a giant
intergalactic force...

788
01:12:05,263 --> 01:12:10,018
...that's about to destroy our planet in
less than 24 hours. Did I miss anything?

789
01:12:10,894 --> 01:12:14,648
I've locked on Victor's energy trail.
He's headed over Southeast China.

790
01:12:14,731 --> 01:12:16,066
Hang on.

791
01:12:20,153 --> 01:12:21,989
Norrin Radd.

792
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:27,911
- What?
- I was once called Norrin Radd.

793
01:12:28,870 --> 01:12:31,915
Norrin, we'll need your help
to save our world.

794
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:33,667
Do you understand?

795
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,800
What the hell was that?

796
01:12:42,676 --> 01:12:47,222
Victor, the board is drawing the
Destroyer here. You have to give it up.

797
01:12:47,305 --> 01:12:50,058
You know, I've never
been the giving type, Reed.

798
01:12:50,142 --> 01:12:51,560
Hold on!

799
01:13:05,949 --> 01:13:07,159
We're sitting ducks!

800
01:13:07,242 --> 01:13:08,827
We're gonna have to split up!

801
01:13:08,910 --> 01:13:11,038
- What?
- This ought to be fun!

802
01:13:11,496 --> 01:13:13,457
Stay close to me, Sue!

803
01:13:40,984 --> 01:13:43,153
He's really pissing me off!

804
01:13:48,867 --> 01:13:50,994
Surf's up, metalhead!

805
01:13:53,789 --> 01:13:58,835
Victor, only the Surfer can stop the
Destroyer. But he needs his board.

806
01:13:58,919 --> 01:14:01,588
- Come and get it, Richards.
- Victor.

807
01:14:05,717 --> 01:14:08,637
Let's all go for a spin!

808
01:14:47,843 --> 01:14:49,094
Norrin!

809
01:14:51,555 --> 01:14:52,764
Catch.

810
01:15:07,445 --> 01:15:08,738
Sue!

811
01:15:13,743 --> 01:15:15,287
Oh, my God.

812
01:15:15,370 --> 01:15:16,746
Sue.Sue.

813
01:15:17,372 --> 01:15:19,916
- Oh, God.
- Johnny, don't touch her!

814
01:15:23,253 --> 01:15:25,005
Oh, God. Oh, God.

815
01:15:25,088 --> 01:15:27,090
You need to find a way
to get the board.

816
01:15:27,215 --> 01:15:29,092
- Sue, I...
- Okay.

817
01:15:38,018 --> 01:15:39,477
He is here.

818
01:15:47,527 --> 01:15:48,862
Reed?

819
01:15:50,113 --> 01:15:51,489
Reed.

820
01:15:52,908 --> 01:15:56,369
Victor's gotta have a pulse emitter
linking him to his board.

821
01:15:56,453 --> 01:16:00,040
We take it out,
we can separate him from his board.

822
01:16:00,123 --> 01:16:01,166
He's too strong for me.

823
01:16:01,249 --> 01:16:03,877
I could whale on him if I get close...

824
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:07,172
...but he could see me coming
from a mile away.

825
01:16:08,131 --> 01:16:10,091
It would take all of us.

826
01:16:11,635 --> 01:16:13,637
Or maybe just one of us.

827
01:16:17,849 --> 01:16:20,602
We don't know
what it could do to you.

828
01:16:21,144 --> 01:16:23,396
Let's not make this about me.

829
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:47,170
To quote a friend of mine...

830
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:49,464
...it's clobbering time.

831
01:17:45,854 --> 01:17:48,523
You ain't going down fighting, kid.

832
01:17:49,441 --> 01:17:51,067
Not without me.

833
01:19:28,832 --> 01:19:30,583
You've gotta go.

834
01:20:00,989 --> 01:20:03,283
Treasure each moment with her.

835
01:20:03,867 --> 01:20:06,077
And tell her she was right.

836
01:20:06,870 --> 01:20:09,539
We do have a choice.

837
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:38,610
Thought you could use a hand.

838
01:20:42,614 --> 01:20:44,491
Oh, my God.

839
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:15,939
Why isn't it working?

840
01:21:17,106 --> 01:21:18,942
We were too late.

841
01:21:27,492 --> 01:21:29,661
I will no longer serve.

842
01:21:31,621 --> 01:21:35,750
This is the end for us both.

843
01:22:58,374 --> 01:22:59,542
Hi.

844
01:23:02,378 --> 01:23:03,379
Hi.

845
01:23:07,967 --> 01:23:09,594
What did I miss?

846
01:23:18,686 --> 01:23:20,521
Hey! Hey!

847
01:23:20,605 --> 01:23:22,899
- He did it.
- Great job, kid.

848
01:23:24,901 --> 01:23:28,112
Hey, wait. I'm not changing.

849
01:23:28,196 --> 01:23:30,031
Hey, that's right.

850
01:23:30,698 --> 01:23:31,991
Great.

851
01:23:32,909 --> 01:23:35,953
Okay, now you're making
me uncomfortable.

852
01:23:55,765 --> 01:23:57,767
So I guess this is it.

853
01:23:58,601 --> 01:24:00,812
We all go our separate ways.

854
01:24:01,479 --> 01:24:02,647
No.

855
01:24:03,815 --> 01:24:05,191
- No?
- No.

856
01:24:05,650 --> 01:24:07,151
- No?
- If not for the team...

857
01:24:07,235 --> 01:24:08,820
...the whole world would be gone.

858
01:24:08,903 --> 01:24:13,533
We can't run away from our
responsibilities. This is who we are.

859
01:24:13,616 --> 01:24:16,786
- That's what I've been saying.
- What about having a normal life?

860
01:24:16,869 --> 01:24:18,705
- A family?
- Who says you have to be normal...

861
01:24:18,788 --> 01:24:20,623
...to have a family?

862
01:24:22,208 --> 01:24:26,462
So are you up for another media-circus
wedding? Fifth time's a charm.

863
01:24:27,213 --> 01:24:28,464
No.

864
01:24:30,883 --> 01:24:32,719
I got a better idea.

865
01:24:44,313 --> 01:24:49,235
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
today to join Reed Richards...

866
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:52,447
...and Sue Storm together in holy...

867
01:24:52,530 --> 01:24:54,949
...matrimony.

868
01:24:55,491 --> 01:24:58,369
- What is it?
- Venice is sinking into the Adriatic.

869
01:24:58,453 --> 01:25:00,538
Oh, boy. That's a biggie.

870
01:25:00,621 --> 01:25:02,790
Could we just skip to the end?

871
01:25:02,874 --> 01:25:06,753
- Yeah. The love these two share...
- No, the very end.

872
01:25:07,044 --> 01:25:09,505
Yeah, great. You have the rings?

873
01:25:18,264 --> 01:25:19,432
Oh, yeah.

874
01:25:19,515 --> 01:25:23,352
I now pronounce you man and wife,
and you may kiss the bride.

875
01:25:29,859 --> 01:25:32,445
- Okay. We should get out of here.
- Yeah.

876
01:25:32,528 --> 01:25:34,405
- Gotta go, hon.
- Okay.

877
01:25:39,368 --> 01:25:41,537
I have to throw the bouquet.

878
01:25:41,621 --> 01:25:43,039
Ready?

879
01:25:52,298 --> 01:25:54,133
Heads up, Johnny.

880
01:26:04,769 --> 01:26:06,020
Sorry.

881
01:26:07,730 --> 01:26:09,023
Reflex.

882
