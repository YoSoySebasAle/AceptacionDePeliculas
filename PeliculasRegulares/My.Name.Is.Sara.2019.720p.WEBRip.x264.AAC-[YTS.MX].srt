1
00:00:21,096 --> 00:00:22,210
SEPTEMBER, 1942

2
00:00:22,211 --> 00:00:23,904
THE 2ND WORLD WAR HAS BEEN FIGHTED FOR THREE YEARS.

3
00:00:23,905 --> 00:00:26,341
AFTER TAKING WESTERN EUROPE,

4
00:00:26,342 --> 00:00:28,728
THE GERMAN ARMY ADDRESSED TO POLAND AND UKRAINE,

5
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:31,074
TOWARDS THE SOVIET UNION.

6
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,166
RIO KORCHYK

7
00:00:54,167 --> 00:00:55,943
EAST POLAND, NEAR THE UKRAINE BORDER

8
00:00:55,944 --> 00:00:58,118
Nazi Germany controlled the region for 15 months,

9
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:00,156
FOLLOWING THE PLAN TO EXTERMINE THE LOCAL JEWISH POPULATION.

10
00:01:00,157 --> 00:01:05,439
THE FEW THAT ESCAPED FROM EXECUTION WANTED FOR SHELTER IN FORESTS,

11
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,684
JOINING THE RESISTANCE, OR TRYING TO SURVIVE ALONE.

12
00:01:11,888 --> 00:01:14,020
BASED ON A REAL STORY

13
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,431
Come this way!

14
00:01:38,977 --> 00:01:40,280
We have to cross.

15
00:01:41,482 --> 00:01:44,351
We won't make it in time. It's too deep for me.

16
00:01:44,984 --> 00:01:48,035
The father said that if we get caught, we have to pray the Shem .

17
00:01:48,036 --> 00:01:49,620
Don't catch us, Moishe.

18
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:53,487
In a few hours, they will all be dead! The mother, the father, the boys ...

19
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,326
Stop! Stop this!

20
00:01:57,318 --> 00:01:58,422
Get yourself together.

21
00:01:58,423 --> 00:01:59,870
Go to the left!

22
00:02:05,986 --> 00:02:07,580
These mice are hidden around here.

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,430
They are still here in the forest.

24
00:02:16,223 --> 00:02:18,536
Come on, single line.

25
00:02:21,591 --> 00:02:23,500
Shem�, Israel...

26
00:02:28,422 --> 00:02:29,918
Look in the bushes and trees.

27
00:02:51,529 --> 00:02:53,481
We have to be at her house before dawn.

28
00:03:10,073 --> 00:03:11,074
Are you okay?

29
00:03:17,682 --> 00:03:19,057
Sara, say something!

30
00:03:20,013 --> 00:03:21,014
Sara!

31
00:03:21,711 --> 00:03:22,712
Say something!

32
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:42,276
MY NAME SARA

33
00:03:49,387 --> 00:03:51,680
-We have to go. -Is that what she told you?

34
00:03:52,308 --> 00:03:55,517
No, but she is very nervous. I'm sure it will deliver.

35
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:01,485
It is obvious that I am a Jew, but you are not.

36
00:04:01,486 --> 00:04:03,994
You will have more chances without me.

37
00:04:08,938 --> 00:04:12,764
What are you going to do when you need to cross another river?

38
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,417
Let's go.

39
00:04:20,832 --> 00:04:22,622
Let's wait until night.

40
00:04:33,062 --> 00:04:34,063
You are right.

41
00:04:40,384 --> 00:04:41,861
I'm sorry, my brother.

42
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:16,588
-Richard, just a little more and it's good. -Okay, I got it!

43
00:06:18,631 --> 00:06:19,632
Ukrainians.

44
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:44,646
I `m looking for work.

45
00:06:48,869 --> 00:06:50,494
Aren't you from here?

46
00:06:50,927 --> 00:06:51,928
N�o.

47
00:06:57,529 --> 00:06:59,361
- Jewish? -No.

48
00:07:07,141 --> 00:07:08,142
Hope there.

49
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:52,635
I will take you to my brother's house.

50
00:07:55,343 --> 00:07:59,829
They have two children and just fired the baby.

51
00:08:43,542 --> 00:08:45,000
She's looking for work.

52
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,289
You have no documents.

53
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:48,770
What's your name?

54
00:08:49,588 --> 00:08:51,464
-Mania. -Mania for qu ?

55
00:08:51,997 --> 00:08:52,998
Romanchuck.

56
00:08:53,975 --> 00:08:56,060
-Where are you from? -From Korets.

57
00:08:59,545 --> 00:09:01,381
-There are many Jews there. -I'm not!

58
00:09:01,382 --> 00:09:02,425
Get out of the car!

59
00:09:14,191 --> 00:09:15,256
She has a Jewish ear.

60
00:09:18,572 --> 00:09:20,072
Make the sign of the cross.

61
00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:29,766
-How old is? -14.

62
00:09:30,675 --> 00:09:32,156
Why aren't you with your family?

63
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,053
My mother died when I was 11 years old.

64
00:09:38,705 --> 00:09:41,788
Last year, my father married a woman from Bogdanovka.

65
00:09:42,646 --> 00:09:46,778
She hit me for no reason and told him lies about me.

66
00:09:47,764 --> 00:09:49,778
In May, she had a baby.

67
00:09:50,781 --> 00:09:53,281
And it only got worse. All.

68
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,083
Will you stay with her or not?

69
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:09,576
Without pay.

70
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:12,308
Just food and a roof for sleeping.

71
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:56,744
You're lucky to have shown up on Sunday.

72
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,681
pork.

73
00:11:19,729 --> 00:11:21,729
Do you love pork or are you just hungry?

74
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:32,680
Both.

75
00:11:34,466 --> 00:11:35,966
Too bad it was the last one.

76
00:11:53,385 --> 00:11:57,853
Forgive me, Jesus, for your beloved son.

77
00:11:58,711 --> 00:12:02,441
-For the bad I did today. -Mania!

78
00:12:03,822 --> 00:12:04,823
Come here.

79
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:13,660
... for the harm I did today.

80
00:12:14,897 --> 00:12:18,699
What I did to the world, to myself ...

81
00:12:19,894 --> 00:12:21,089
And to Ti.

82
00:12:22,564 --> 00:12:23,692
I...

83
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:39,770
So that before sleeping ...

84
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,754
So that before sleeping ...

85
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,573
At peace I can be.

86
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:45,854
At peace I can be.

87
00:12:51,026 --> 00:12:52,043
Now, go to bed.

88
00:13:03,374 --> 00:13:04,533
A Mania tamb m.

89
00:13:40,926 --> 00:13:42,331
Go to sleep in the barn.

90
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:29,319
I carry.

91
00:15:35,063 --> 00:15:36,064
Mania!

92
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:40,904
Go clean up.

93
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:51,019
The Germans took our animals last month.

94
00:15:51,813 --> 00:15:53,713
I got up early to work, thank God.

95
00:15:54,447 --> 00:15:56,747
And I hid the best animals in the forest.

96
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,609
The rest, I had to leave it to those motherfuckers.

97
00:16:43,956 --> 00:16:46,158
Mania, Mania, hi me!

98
00:17:00,942 --> 00:17:03,984
He will take you to Korets to get your documents.

99
00:17:07,813 --> 00:17:08,814
It's all right.

100
00:17:16,814 --> 00:17:18,929
We will take all day.

101
00:17:20,811 --> 00:17:22,018
I'm sorry.

102
00:17:23,171 --> 00:17:24,402
I left in a hurry.

103
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,221
What are you going to say to your father?

104
00:17:30,657 --> 00:17:31,658
No be.

105
00:17:33,098 --> 00:17:35,213
-I'm worried. -With what?

106
00:17:35,214 --> 00:17:36,427
He will be angry.

107
00:17:37,774 --> 00:17:40,649
You can start an argument and don't let me go back with you.

108
00:17:50,164 --> 00:17:51,264
Keep walking!

109
00:17:58,206 --> 00:17:59,207
Go ahead!

110
00:18:07,132 --> 00:18:08,133
Do you know her?

111
00:18:09,397 --> 00:18:10,594
Of course not.

112
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,410
But this is horrible.

113
00:18:16,198 --> 00:18:17,204
May God help them.

114
00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:19,769
Don't spend your prayers on it.

115
00:18:22,188 --> 00:18:23,304
Don't you have a fan?

116
00:18:24,972 --> 00:18:25,973
F�?

117
00:18:27,788 --> 00:18:30,079
My fan died with my first wife and daughter.

118
00:18:31,084 --> 00:18:33,689
What kind of girl abandons her own family?

119
00:18:35,938 --> 00:18:37,438
Get up!

120
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,292
I don't have a family.

121
00:18:40,354 --> 00:18:42,146
My mother was everything to me.

122
00:18:51,341 --> 00:18:52,841
What am I doing here?

123
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,718
We will go another day.

124
00:19:27,463 --> 00:19:28,652
What are you doing?

125
00:19:28,653 --> 00:19:31,476
waste of time. I can't waste my days.

126
00:19:31,477 --> 00:19:34,385
-Not a waste of time, go back there. - Shut up!

127
00:19:35,104 --> 00:19:36,213
I won't talk about it.

128
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,414
How will I manage to keep my quota if almost all my animals have been taken?

129
00:20:51,688 --> 00:20:54,895
Go cry to him and see if he cares.

130
00:21:09,236 --> 00:21:12,771
Starting next week, bring four more bags of meat.

131
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,890
Just because I asked a question?

132
00:21:16,271 --> 00:21:19,236
You are not that important. Everyone must bring.

133
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:22,782
Now, get out of here!

134
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,401
V�o.

135
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:51,499
Maybe we'll make some money today.

136
00:21:53,138 --> 00:21:55,234
The soldiers' pockets over there are full.

137
00:21:56,177 --> 00:21:58,972
Your son is so big.

138
00:22:00,331 --> 00:22:01,652
And he is already a pest.

139
00:22:05,747 --> 00:22:06,932
Our new girl.

140
00:22:09,019 --> 00:22:10,532
Much pleasure.

141
00:22:11,271 --> 00:22:12,953
I'm Vira Ivanenko.

142
00:22:15,053 --> 00:22:16,441
Sou Mania Romanchuck.

143
00:22:17,457 --> 00:22:18,979
Where are you from, Mania?

144
00:22:20,064 --> 00:22:21,065
Choir.

145
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:26,260
Be welcome.

146
00:22:26,582 --> 00:22:30,522
We always need smart young people. Please.

147
00:22:31,698 --> 00:22:32,699
Thanks.

148
00:22:42,739 --> 00:22:43,740
How much?

149
00:22:46,443 --> 00:22:48,230
For my dear soldier, I'm 20.

150
00:22:49,615 --> 00:22:50,616
Eight.

151
00:22:51,861 --> 00:22:52,862
Ten.

152
00:22:53,881 --> 00:22:56,006
-I'll give you ten ... -It won't give you anything!

153
00:22:57,498 --> 00:23:00,608
Do you think you can bribe us, you filthy Ukrainian?

154
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,083
You can have everything.

155
00:23:08,494 --> 00:23:09,502
But you can ask.

156
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:12,661
My wife makes the best bread in town!

157
00:23:13,361 --> 00:23:14,917
And we won't be here next week.

158
00:23:14,918 --> 00:23:16,510
You can no longer prove it.

159
00:23:31,196 --> 00:23:32,197
Ten.

160
00:23:43,105 --> 00:23:44,106
Thanks.

161
00:23:47,066 --> 00:23:49,479
I need to see Katya's baby before she leaves.

162
00:23:50,979 --> 00:23:52,285
We are still working.

163
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,717
She's my best friend!

164
00:24:00,431 --> 00:24:01,438
Yes 15 minutes.

165
00:24:17,326 --> 00:24:18,384
Go find her!

166
00:25:28,175 --> 00:25:29,385
Get out of here!

167
00:25:30,115 --> 00:25:31,116
No.

168
00:25:33,229 --> 00:25:34,538
Damn it, Grisha!

169
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,266
Voc is expert.

170
00:25:51,941 --> 00:25:53,560
I realized as soon as Ivan brought you.

171
00:25:58,275 --> 00:26:00,775
My friend Marina just left.

172
00:26:01,197 --> 00:26:05,180
She was here with her aunt who lived in Korets

173
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:07,056
and knew his family.

174
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:10,460
They'll be back next week.

175
00:26:12,507 --> 00:26:13,738
What an end!

176
00:26:50,426 --> 00:26:53,426
THOSE WHO OFFER HELP TO JEWS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IMMEDIATELY

177
00:27:18,859 --> 00:27:20,192
There are six more bases.

178
00:27:23,468 --> 00:27:25,941
Six bases for the end of this war drug.

179
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:35,256
Did you hear about the peasant girl in Morasivka?

180
00:27:39,642 --> 00:27:42,228
She took a coat left by a Jew.

181
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:45,712
And found nine diamonds inside the fabric.

182
00:27:47,736 --> 00:27:51,531
It is nothing compared to how much these parasites stole from us.

183
00:28:22,151 --> 00:28:23,731
You can't go to church like that.

184
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,770
I don't use it anymore.

185
00:28:30,521 --> 00:28:32,698
You can unsheath the bar.

186
00:29:01,666 --> 00:29:03,355
This man respects nothing.

187
00:29:09,589 --> 00:29:12,058
Even on Sundays, he gets dirty as a pig.

188
00:29:36,544 --> 00:29:40,521
Christ, our true God,

189
00:29:40,522 --> 00:29:44,580
through the prayers of His Most Holy Mother,

190
00:29:44,581 --> 00:29:49,172
of our venerable fathers and bearers of the word of God

191
00:29:49,173 --> 00:29:52,509
and of all the saints,

192
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:57,283
have mercy and save us,

193
00:29:57,716 --> 00:30:01,642
being kind and forgiving!

194
00:30:02,061 --> 00:30:05,794
Am�m!

195
00:30:05,795 --> 00:30:10,609
Gl ria a ti

196
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:16,098
God.

197
00:30:16,626 --> 00:30:19,348
Receive the Eucharist, the servant of God ...

198
00:30:19,664 --> 00:30:21,264
-Olga. -Olga,

199
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:24,861
for the forgiveness of your sins and eternal life.

200
00:30:28,861 --> 00:30:31,830
Receive the Eucharist, the servant of God ...

201
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:33,578
-Nadya. -Nadya,

202
00:30:33,579 --> 00:30:37,048
for the forgiveness of your sins and eternal life.

203
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:43,827
Receive the Eucharist, the servant of God ...

204
00:30:43,828 --> 00:30:44,964
Mania.

205
00:30:47,056 --> 00:30:48,057
Mania,

206
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:52,856
for the forgiveness of your sins and eternal life.

207
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:24,760
Who are you?

208
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:26,855
Lydia.

209
00:31:35,111 --> 00:31:36,207
Are you Jewish?

210
00:31:40,063 --> 00:31:41,392
I'm just hungry.

211
00:31:47,825 --> 00:31:48,826
Wait up there.

212
00:32:08,361 --> 00:32:09,362
Thanks.

213
00:32:21,146 --> 00:32:22,230
Where are you from?

214
00:32:23,913 --> 00:32:24,914
Rivne.

215
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,089
But I can't go back.

216
00:32:33,416 --> 00:32:35,814
I am looking for a place to stay.

217
00:32:38,337 --> 00:32:40,933
-I have gold coins. -Don't show it!

218
00:32:41,563 --> 00:32:42,604
For no one.

219
00:32:45,301 --> 00:32:46,680
You will know that you are Jewish.

220
00:32:48,867 --> 00:32:50,102
I'm not Jewish.

221
00:32:52,791 --> 00:32:54,094
Make the sign of the cross.

222
00:32:56,491 --> 00:32:58,891
So, from right to left.

223
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:01,688
Sim.

224
00:33:03,305 --> 00:33:04,607
Do you know how to pray the Hail Mary?

225
00:33:08,372 --> 00:33:09,669
Need to know.

226
00:33:11,788 --> 00:33:13,085
Repeat with me.

227
00:33:15,188 --> 00:33:17,750
Mother of God and Virgin, rejoice.

228
00:33:18,887 --> 00:33:24,616
Mother of God and Virgin, rejoice.

229
00:33:24,617 --> 00:33:27,213
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you.

230
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:31,133
Hail Mary, full of grace ...

231
00:33:32,956 --> 00:33:36,666
the Lord is with you.

232
00:33:37,938 --> 00:33:40,430
Blessed are you among women,

233
00:33:40,431 --> 00:33:42,835
and blessed is the fruit of your womb ...

234
00:33:43,991 --> 00:33:47,740
Blessed or ...

235
00:33:52,416 --> 00:33:55,791
If you want to live, you need to learn.

236
00:33:56,510 --> 00:34:00,469
Everything will be fine! Nobody thinks I'm Jewish.

237
00:34:00,787 --> 00:34:02,865
-Nobody! -You can't stay here.

238
00:34:13,529 --> 00:34:14,944
My name is Mirarra Dubner.

239
00:34:21,756 --> 00:34:23,143
I'm Mania Romanchuck.

240
00:35:22,943 --> 00:35:25,045
Do you have time to see her?

241
00:35:28,141 --> 00:35:30,433
Just say hello. We didn't come for visits.

242
00:35:40,486 --> 00:35:41,487
Marina!

243
00:35:42,668 --> 00:35:43,846
That's Mania.

244
00:35:45,007 --> 00:35:46,309
Thanks for coming.

245
00:35:47,388 --> 00:35:48,472
Tia Katy!

246
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:51,940
Tia Katy!

247
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,799
This is Korets' Mania Romanchuck.

248
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,481
N�o.

249
00:36:04,368 --> 00:36:07,684
She was only seven when she left, it changed a lot.

250
00:36:10,885 --> 00:36:12,796
-You don't remember ... -Speak louder!

251
00:36:20,173 --> 00:36:21,216
Don't you remember?

252
00:36:21,217 --> 00:36:23,577
He gave me a doll dress when I turned five.

253
00:36:27,105 --> 00:36:30,702
No dress. No dress!

254
00:36:35,407 --> 00:36:38,157
-I was much smaller. -No!

255
00:36:39,763 --> 00:36:42,386
It only gets worse every day.

256
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,598
You can no longer be alone.

257
00:36:47,761 --> 00:36:50,803
I thought she was going to recognize you.

258
00:37:58,746 --> 00:38:00,454
Shem�, Israel.

259
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:05,002
Adonai to our Gd, Adonai to One.

260
00:38:06,065 --> 00:38:09,356
Shem , Israel, Adonai is our God, Adonai is One.

261
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,489
How long did I sleep?

262
00:38:26,943 --> 00:38:28,059
No be.

263
00:38:28,817 --> 00:38:33,067
-Let's play hide and seek! -Hide and seek!

264
00:38:34,235 --> 00:38:35,236
It's all right.

265
00:38:35,974 --> 00:38:36,975
They will hide.

266
00:38:37,419 --> 00:38:41,456
One, two, three ...

267
00:38:52,598 --> 00:38:53,599
Soon.

268
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,310
It's cold at night.

269
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:07,331
You can sleep in the house.

270
00:39:23,238 --> 00:39:24,294
Mania.

271
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:28,559
What were you talking about in your sleep?

272
00:39:40,324 --> 00:39:43,337
I don't know. It looks Chinese.

273
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:51,004
DECEMBER, 1942

274
00:41:41,813 --> 00:41:43,354
Infiltration worsened.

275
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:47,292
Tomorrow I will go to the locksmith shop to buy some tiles.

276
00:41:49,419 --> 00:41:50,753
You should take the boys.

277
00:41:51,731 --> 00:41:53,522
You know how they like it there.

278
00:42:43,194 --> 00:42:47,736
The Germans surrounded Stalingrad. It will be over soon.

279
00:42:50,955 --> 00:42:53,288
So the old locksmith has a radio.

280
00:43:03,587 --> 00:43:04,588
You'll see.

281
00:43:05,491 --> 00:43:07,536
The Germans will find it and kill him.

282
00:43:11,151 --> 00:43:14,663
Maybe krauts aren't as smart as we think.

283
00:43:37,367 --> 00:43:39,404
Everyone out of the house!

284
00:43:41,357 --> 00:43:42,358
Vista-se!

285
00:43:43,872 --> 00:43:45,662
Or let's fire it!

286
00:43:49,361 --> 00:43:51,236
I said get out!

287
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:54,480
R�pido!

288
00:43:54,481 --> 00:43:56,234
Quick, bitch!

289
00:44:05,798 --> 00:44:07,817
They cry like little girls.

290
00:44:10,393 --> 00:44:14,420
If they spend a month with me, I become real partisans.

291
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:17,857
Come in! Go, go! Come on!

292
00:44:22,547 --> 00:44:25,512
-Cad the meat? -We only have plantations.

293
00:44:25,513 --> 00:44:27,972
Don't lie to me, you tramp.

294
00:44:27,973 --> 00:44:31,348
We store potatoes and carrots in bags. 40 kilos.

295
00:44:31,349 --> 00:44:32,456
They can take ...

296
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:43,983
This one-eyed Jew would only love to dig a hole in your head!

297
00:44:43,984 --> 00:44:45,032
I got it!

298
00:44:45,723 --> 00:44:49,391
We're wasting time. You're going to join your dog.

299
00:44:49,392 --> 00:44:50,478
It's true!

300
00:44:51,943 --> 00:44:52,944
Shoot him.

301
00:44:55,238 --> 00:44:56,239
I'll take you!

302
00:44:57,790 --> 00:44:59,403
I knew it!

303
00:45:06,821 --> 00:45:09,475
You two, follow me.

304
00:45:33,193 --> 00:45:34,887
Lying pig!

305
00:45:42,741 --> 00:45:45,529
Leave that bag of shit a . We'll be back.

306
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:46,577
Let's go.

307
00:45:50,262 --> 00:45:52,512
Thank God that we are not German.

308
00:45:53,109 --> 00:45:56,826
They would have left you with nothing. Let's go.

309
00:46:01,704 --> 00:46:03,162
Stay together.

310
00:46:15,121 --> 00:46:16,921
-In between. -I'm going.

311
00:46:27,006 --> 00:46:28,508
Did you have to open your mouth?

312
00:46:30,252 --> 00:46:31,965
I thought they were going to kill him.

313
00:46:32,677 --> 00:46:34,921
We do not welcome you for this.

314
00:46:39,244 --> 00:46:40,724
N o iam mat -lo.

315
00:46:41,352 --> 00:46:43,462
They want to come back for more food.

316
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,899
I can't even look at you.

317
00:47:38,975 --> 00:47:40,956
It was a less painful death.

318
00:47:59,609 --> 00:48:01,622
I don't like rabbits.

319
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,120
Learn to like it.

320
00:48:07,479 --> 00:48:08,781
N�o d�!

321
00:48:11,306 --> 00:48:12,600
Complain to Mania.

322
00:48:22,469 --> 00:48:23,479
o Ivan.

323
00:48:24,113 --> 00:48:25,674
He can barely stand.

324
00:48:32,096 --> 00:48:33,751
Irm�oz�o!

325
00:48:33,752 --> 00:48:35,516
I found gold!

326
00:48:40,207 --> 00:48:43,750
But he does not forget his own blood.

327
00:48:43,751 --> 00:48:46,684
-Where did you get this? - Where's your vodka?

328
00:48:47,307 --> 00:48:48,898
Show hospitality!

329
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,053
Who took this from?

330
00:49:08,594 --> 00:49:11,666
From the most beautiful Jewish girl you've ever seen.

331
00:49:18,563 --> 00:49:21,654
It wasn't easy to get into it, but ...

332
00:49:22,354 --> 00:49:24,895
It was the best fuck of my life.

333
00:49:24,896 --> 00:49:25,984
Boys, get out!

334
00:49:25,985 --> 00:49:27,028
Get out!

335
00:49:34,684 --> 00:49:38,800
Will you come to my house to talk like that in front of my children?

336
00:49:40,995 --> 00:49:43,387
Sorry for not leaving a little for you.

337
00:49:44,089 --> 00:49:45,098
But she...

338
00:49:49,854 --> 00:49:53,188
She kept screaming!

339
00:49:58,489 --> 00:50:00,063
You son of a bitch!

340
00:50:01,892 --> 00:50:04,572
Skirt! Skirt!

341
00:51:00,529 --> 00:51:01,530
With license.

342
00:51:26,778 --> 00:51:28,086
Do you know what's going on?

343
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:30,720
I think so.

344
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:34,630
It happens every month.

345
00:51:35,462 --> 00:51:36,564
Are you in pain?

346
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:39,821
A little.

347
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:43,326
This will help.

348
00:51:49,643 --> 00:51:51,592
When it gets better, we need more kindling.

349
00:52:32,458 --> 00:52:33,459
Got me.

350
00:52:38,466 --> 00:52:40,739
We've been looking for this for weeks.

351
00:52:50,646 --> 00:52:53,437
The idiot pilot was unable to locate our signal,

352
00:52:54,222 --> 00:52:55,822
so he just left it here and left.

353
00:53:00,521 --> 00:53:01,930
I'm sorry for your dog.

354
00:53:04,694 --> 00:53:06,194
Why did they shoot her?

355
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:08,568
Because he's a tramp.

356
00:53:09,797 --> 00:53:11,199
No one supports it.

357
00:53:20,974 --> 00:53:23,214
I don't care. I want to go with you.

358
00:53:25,377 --> 00:53:26,972
He wouldn't.

359
00:53:27,733 --> 00:53:28,735
Ask him.

360
00:53:36,434 --> 00:53:39,725
They say he is leaving to form another partisan group.

361
00:53:41,257 --> 00:53:42,556
You can join them.

362
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:53,100
Have you killed Germans?

363
00:53:58,799 --> 00:53:59,800
How many?

364
00:54:05,581 --> 00:54:06,611
Not enough.

365
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:12,316
The eye patch man, is he a Jew?

366
00:54:14,192 --> 00:54:15,193
The bear?

367
00:54:16,685 --> 00:54:18,464
His real name is Kapinski.

368
00:54:20,104 --> 00:54:22,604
I don't think it will last very long.

369
00:54:23,463 --> 00:54:24,465
Why no?

370
00:54:25,474 --> 00:54:27,202
He is full of hate.

371
00:54:29,313 --> 00:54:30,719
It takes many risks.

372
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:36,977
Are you also a Jew?

373
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:39,436
Do you need to be a Jew to hate Germans?

374
00:54:40,406 --> 00:54:43,182
It is not easy to kill another human being.

375
00:54:47,927 --> 00:54:49,022
Must be yes.

376
00:54:50,013 --> 00:54:53,659
If not, why is the forest full of bodies?

377
00:54:57,952 --> 00:54:59,958
The rest of the staff are looking for the weapons.

378
00:55:00,283 --> 00:55:01,284
You better go.

379
00:55:05,809 --> 00:55:09,309
JANEIRO, 1943 ANO NOVO "MALANKA"

380
00:55:11,547 --> 00:55:13,874
Welcome!

381
00:55:32,192 --> 00:55:34,868
Whatever happened between you two,

382
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:37,224
already in the past!

383
00:55:38,747 --> 00:55:42,474
You don't know what he did, what he said in front of my kids!

384
00:55:42,475 --> 00:55:44,230
Not me amount.

385
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:47,146
Voc�s s�o irm�os!

386
00:55:47,726 --> 00:55:49,030
Pavlo!

387
00:55:49,371 --> 00:55:51,690
Malanka! New Year!

388
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:54,616
Please, for me!

389
00:57:04,895 --> 00:57:06,787
With the war around us,

390
00:57:09,958 --> 00:57:14,458
we know that this new year will bring us a lot of pain and suffering.

391
00:57:15,537 --> 00:57:17,137
So, this toast

392
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:21,246
whether to savor the special moments.

393
00:57:21,872 --> 00:57:22,982
Of joy

394
00:57:26,344 --> 00:57:27,345
and pleasure.

395
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:34,271
Sa�de!

396
00:57:58,341 --> 00:58:01,054
Let's get some fresh air, you and me.

397
00:58:13,687 --> 00:58:14,688
Sit down.

398
00:58:20,965 --> 00:58:22,567
Did you see them together?

399
00:58:23,963 --> 00:58:24,964
She is...

400
00:58:26,151 --> 00:58:27,161
And my nephew?

401
00:58:30,188 --> 00:58:31,189
N�o.

402
00:58:33,772 --> 00:58:37,735
If you lie to me, I'll hang you by the feet and cut your neck.

403
00:58:38,167 --> 00:58:39,479
I never saw them together.

404
00:58:40,753 --> 00:58:43,142
Swear by your mother's soul?

405
00:58:43,646 --> 00:58:44,854
I swear!

406
00:59:11,529 --> 00:59:14,612
Is that how Queen Malanka is treated?

407
00:59:15,197 --> 00:59:17,112
With insults from drunks?

408
00:59:17,616 --> 00:59:20,502
Will show respect to my friends

409
00:59:20,976 --> 00:59:22,996
if you know what is best for you.

410
00:59:26,136 --> 00:59:27,764
And where is the Jew?

411
00:59:28,236 --> 00:59:30,478
Where's the Jew? Where's the Jew?

412
00:59:30,479 --> 00:59:32,502
Where's the Jew? Where's the Jew?

413
00:59:32,503 --> 00:59:34,729
Where's the Jew? Where's the Jew?

414
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:36,857
Where's the Jew? Where's the Jew?

415
00:59:36,858 --> 00:59:39,149
Where's the Jew? Where's the Jew?

416
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:41,516
-Where is the Jew? -Here it is!

417
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:25,124
-Let's go! -Let's go!

418
01:01:07,007 --> 01:01:09,609
Bless these grains with good health.

419
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,097
And prosperity.

420
01:01:14,104 --> 01:01:16,386
Happy New Year!

421
01:01:47,835 --> 01:01:49,857
He asked me about you and Grisha,

422
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:52,166
when we were at his parents' house.

423
01:01:55,982 --> 01:01:57,172
What did he want to know?

424
01:01:59,354 --> 01:02:00,972
If I had seen you with him.

425
01:02:03,788 --> 01:02:04,862
What did you say?

426
01:02:05,813 --> 01:02:06,901
That I hadn't seen.

427
01:02:13,331 --> 01:02:14,640
Wouldn't you lie to me?

428
01:02:18,959 --> 01:02:19,962
Never?

429
01:02:24,821 --> 01:02:25,828
Everybody mind.

430
01:02:27,908 --> 01:02:30,600
-To Grisha? -Mostly him.

431
01:02:42,807 --> 01:02:44,998
What are your sins, girl?

432
01:02:48,089 --> 01:02:49,158
You can say.

433
01:02:52,994 --> 01:02:53,996
I...

434
01:02:56,643 --> 01:03:00,027
lied to the man who took me in and ...

435
01:03:00,028 --> 01:03:01,115
E?

436
01:03:02,113 --> 01:03:03,114
What else?

437
01:03:06,091 --> 01:03:07,192
Is that it?

438
01:03:09,056 --> 01:03:10,057
And I...

439
01:03:22,370 --> 01:03:26,623
When we confess, we must open our hearts.

440
01:03:26,931 --> 01:03:28,045
Completely.

441
01:03:37,884 --> 01:03:44,570
Yours is the kingdom, the power and the glory.

442
01:03:44,907 --> 01:03:47,524
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

443
01:03:47,525 --> 01:03:49,803
Now and forever.

444
01:03:59,408 --> 01:04:02,950
KORETS SEPTEMBER 3, 1942

445
01:04:08,715 --> 01:04:09,721
Everything is ready, sir.

446
01:04:12,058 --> 01:04:14,375
Intimate. We will eat manh .

447
01:04:16,234 --> 01:04:18,009
-Remember what you need to do? -L remember.

448
01:04:18,903 --> 01:04:20,725
Just go at night.

449
01:04:21,085 --> 01:04:22,872
Stay away from the roads.

450
01:04:24,002 --> 01:04:25,515
And, if caught ...

451
01:04:26,598 --> 01:04:28,352
Do not forget to say the Shem .

452
01:04:31,979 --> 01:04:33,687
Take care of your little sister.

453
01:04:39,811 --> 01:04:43,952
After you pass the fence, don't forget to rip the stars out.

454
01:04:43,953 --> 01:04:47,933
And don't take it out, but hide it where no one can find it.

455
01:04:47,934 --> 01:04:48,977
Understood?

456
01:04:49,283 --> 01:04:51,200
I will not, I will stay with you.

457
01:04:51,201 --> 01:04:54,459
If the lady refuses to receive you,

458
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:56,334
remind her that we made a deal.

459
01:04:57,134 --> 01:05:00,431
-I'm not going ... -Your father gave her a lot of money.

460
01:05:04,006 --> 01:05:05,516
You need to survive.

461
01:05:07,228 --> 01:05:08,849
It will be our revenge.

462
01:05:12,139 --> 01:05:13,220
Mam�e...

463
01:05:19,612 --> 01:05:22,609
Do whatever it takes. Can you promise me?

464
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:25,080
Traffic!

465
01:05:29,604 --> 01:05:30,729
I promise.

466
01:06:24,737 --> 01:06:25,738
Skirt!

467
01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:50,201
Don't think badly of me.

468
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:54,951
She must have talked about me.

469
01:06:57,572 --> 01:06:58,961
About the girl before you.

470
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:01,768
N�o...

471
01:07:05,747 --> 01:07:07,221
So why are you afraid of me?

472
01:07:09,890 --> 01:07:11,083
I'm not afraid.

473
01:07:12,063 --> 01:07:13,077
�timo.

474
01:07:16,175 --> 01:07:17,795
Don't let it hit you.

475
01:07:22,469 --> 01:07:24,071
She is jealous because you ...

476
01:07:25,563 --> 01:07:26,965
She's prettier than she is.

477
01:07:32,962 --> 01:07:33,968
N souo sou, n o.

478
01:07:49,919 --> 01:07:51,012
I think.

479
01:08:07,771 --> 01:08:11,274
APRIL, 1943

480
01:08:15,413 --> 01:08:17,568
Which animal am I thinking of?

481
01:08:17,569 --> 01:08:18,683
A cow!

482
01:08:19,594 --> 01:08:21,479
-No. -An owl.

483
01:08:22,210 --> 01:08:25,281
-Owl is not an animal. - yes!

484
01:08:25,282 --> 01:08:27,883
-Mania ... -Danylo, close his eyes!

485
01:08:39,505 --> 01:08:43,287
I hid Jews

486
01:09:18,659 --> 01:09:19,776
Are you okay?

487
01:09:31,271 --> 01:09:32,871
This will lower the fever.

488
01:09:37,863 --> 01:09:39,570
What did you think when you saw them ...

489
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:43,661
hanging?

490
01:09:49,813 --> 01:09:51,410
It was like a terrible nightmare.

491
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:55,339
It didn't seem real.

492
01:10:04,386 --> 01:10:08,244
I do everything to protect my children.

493
01:10:10,869 --> 01:10:11,870
All.

494
01:10:19,138 --> 01:10:20,284
I'm not Jewish.

495
01:10:26,073 --> 01:10:29,198
I'm leaving in the morning if that's what you want.

496
01:10:36,097 --> 01:10:37,688
Pavlo would be furious.

497
01:10:43,335 --> 01:10:45,359
And the boys would be very sad.

498
01:10:52,416 --> 01:10:54,002
Did he try anything with you?

499
01:11:00,759 --> 01:11:01,760
N�o.

500
01:11:07,354 --> 01:11:08,355
My mother

501
01:11:10,290 --> 01:11:12,193
said i should marry him

502
01:11:13,109 --> 01:11:14,487
when I turned 15.

503
01:11:16,366 --> 01:11:17,756
My dad died,

504
01:11:17,757 --> 01:11:19,387
we were starving,

505
01:11:22,076 --> 01:11:23,954
and he had a farm.

506
01:11:31,210 --> 01:11:32,876
You don't know anything about me.

507
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:42,729
I know you're as strong as he is.

508
01:11:45,543 --> 01:11:47,524
No way.

509
01:11:49,288 --> 01:11:53,038
Partisans are made men,

510
01:11:53,646 --> 01:11:54,877
hardened.

511
01:11:56,641 --> 01:11:58,837
We are not girls like you.

512
01:12:01,055 --> 01:12:05,386
Do you think you could kill another human being?

513
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:10,073
You wouldn't be able to do that.

514
01:12:17,934 --> 01:12:19,901
You don't know what I'm capable of.

515
01:12:25,436 --> 01:12:28,561
You're Jewish, aren't you?

516
01:12:38,852 --> 01:12:43,748
How well do you know our prayers and rituals?

517
01:12:47,767 --> 01:12:51,211
My best friend begged me to stay in religion class

518
01:12:51,625 --> 01:12:53,029
when the British arrived.

519
01:12:53,932 --> 01:12:56,523
We've been sitting together since we were six.

520
01:13:00,816 --> 01:13:04,379
-Your friend to Mania ... -Romanchuck.

521
01:13:07,357 --> 01:13:13,023
Do you realize the danger it is bringing to this family?

522
01:13:14,146 --> 01:13:16,062
For those two little boys?

523
01:13:18,221 --> 01:13:20,528
So I need to join the resistance.

524
01:13:25,941 --> 01:13:28,288
You wouldn't survive, girl.

525
01:13:33,396 --> 01:13:34,397
It would survive, yes.

526
01:13:36,633 --> 01:13:37,658
I need to survive.

527
01:13:44,419 --> 01:13:45,898
I promised my mother.

528
01:13:51,619 --> 01:13:54,453
God bless you. You too, my son.

529
01:13:55,674 --> 01:13:58,387
-God bless you. - Stepan's birthday.

530
01:13:59,103 --> 01:14:00,398
How old are you?

531
01:14:01,019 --> 01:14:02,845
Let me guess. 12?

532
01:14:03,227 --> 01:14:04,565
I have four.

533
01:14:04,566 --> 01:14:05,795
Assurance?

534
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:09,749
May God bless you, Stepan,

535
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:13,880
with lots of health, a long life and happiness.

536
01:14:16,313 --> 01:14:17,395
God bless you.

537
01:14:21,825 --> 01:14:23,222
God bless you.

538
01:14:36,637 --> 01:14:37,922
-Mania. -Mania!

539
01:14:38,454 --> 01:14:39,901
-Between! -Between!

540
01:14:39,902 --> 01:14:41,172
I don't know how to swim.

541
01:14:41,604 --> 01:14:42,791
I hold you!

542
01:14:47,263 --> 01:14:48,264
Can go.

543
01:14:52,662 --> 01:14:54,563
Mania, come on!

544
01:14:57,851 --> 01:14:59,173
Between!

545
01:15:02,485 --> 01:15:03,867
Between!

546
01:15:10,563 --> 01:15:13,281
Relax, relax.

547
01:15:14,229 --> 01:15:15,741
Trust me, relax.

548
01:15:19,786 --> 01:15:21,006
Relax.

549
01:15:22,779 --> 01:15:24,071
Trust me.

550
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:31,087
Everyone out!

551
01:15:38,778 --> 01:15:41,200
No! No, please!

552
01:15:41,201 --> 01:15:42,922
Wait! This ...

553
01:15:43,374 --> 01:15:46,022
I need the hoes to finish plowing. Please!

554
01:15:48,535 --> 01:15:52,553
If you get close again, you'll be shot!

555
01:16:05,271 --> 01:16:06,272
Sir.

556
01:16:07,181 --> 01:16:08,399
If you're hungry,

557
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:11,387
has fresh bread, cheese and ...

558
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:14,950
A bottle of homemade vodka.

559
01:16:15,731 --> 01:16:16,929
I know I know.

560
01:16:17,521 --> 01:16:21,526
-I know you can't have ... -Are you trying to bribe me?

561
01:16:22,894 --> 01:16:26,114
You miserable bum.

562
01:16:32,939 --> 01:16:34,247
Put it in my car.

563
01:16:47,628 --> 01:16:49,229
Leave the cow!

564
01:16:51,506 --> 01:16:53,414
-Thank you sir! -Let's go.

565
01:16:54,031 --> 01:16:55,032
Thank you.

566
01:16:55,732 --> 01:16:56,733
Thank you sir.

567
01:17:19,237 --> 01:17:20,760
This is crazy!

568
01:17:20,761 --> 01:17:22,745
Ask Ivan's horses!

569
01:17:22,746 --> 01:17:25,050
I won't ask for his help for anything.

570
01:17:25,748 --> 01:17:28,415
Why didn't the Germans take his animals?

571
01:17:29,409 --> 01:17:30,508
He was warned.

572
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:33,408
But he didn't have time to warn his brother.

573
01:17:33,409 --> 01:17:34,452
That's enough!

574
01:17:36,518 --> 01:17:38,122
Mania, hit it.

575
01:17:42,563 --> 01:17:43,564
Stronger!

576
01:17:45,863 --> 01:17:46,947
Stronger!

577
01:17:52,675 --> 01:17:54,077
Let's go!

578
01:17:55,778 --> 01:17:56,861
Let's go!

579
01:17:57,287 --> 01:17:59,398
-Lula, come on! -Come on, Lula!

580
01:17:59,399 --> 01:18:00,910
-Let's go! -That!

581
01:18:00,911 --> 01:18:03,923
Let's go! Come on!

582
01:18:03,924 --> 01:18:05,020
Spirit!

583
01:18:21,321 --> 01:18:22,322
Let's get to work.

584
01:18:24,598 --> 01:18:25,599
That!

585
01:18:41,938 --> 01:18:43,762
Please let's go!

586
01:18:46,081 --> 01:18:47,090
Come come.

587
01:18:50,791 --> 01:18:51,792
Let's go!

588
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:00,812
Get up, come on.

589
01:19:37,896 --> 01:19:40,008
I was an idiot!

590
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:51,184
It will never work.

591
01:20:30,285 --> 01:20:31,387
Mania!

592
01:20:31,388 --> 01:20:32,491
�gua.

593
01:20:36,188 --> 01:20:37,189
It's late.

594
01:20:38,811 --> 01:20:40,410
I'll take them to bed.

595
01:20:41,724 --> 01:20:43,016
We're not done yet!

596
01:20:50,827 --> 01:20:52,317
Are you coming back?

597
01:21:09,282 --> 01:21:15,457
Sleep, baby, sing a song

598
01:21:17,146 --> 01:21:23,382
And I would sleep peacefully with my voice

599
01:21:24,743 --> 01:21:26,809
But

600
01:21:27,855 --> 01:21:33,184
the stones roll, baby

601
01:21:34,721 --> 01:21:38,690
And to the ship

602
01:21:39,931 --> 01:21:43,062
My feet will guide

603
01:21:44,944 --> 01:21:51,069
-I'll protect you.

604
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:58,347
In a new adventure

605
01:21:59,568 --> 01:22:02,135
The wind

606
01:22:02,692 --> 01:22:08,138
Blow and lightly rock you

607
01:22:09,612 --> 01:22:14,568
A lullaby

608
01:22:15,649 --> 01:22:18,430
-For your sleep ... -Don't be afraid.

609
01:22:18,431 --> 01:22:19,687
I won't hurt you.

610
01:23:09,229 --> 01:23:10,550
Before we plant,

611
01:23:13,499 --> 01:23:14,566
for luck,

612
01:23:16,612 --> 01:23:18,382
Grisha should come

613
01:23:19,566 --> 01:23:21,050
and eat you right here.

614
01:23:27,729 --> 01:23:29,162
You pig.

615
01:23:29,163 --> 01:23:31,276
Your taper!

616
01:23:34,323 --> 01:23:35,324
Come on, let's go.

617
01:24:04,618 --> 01:24:08,372
AUGUST, 1943

618
01:24:30,926 --> 01:24:32,967
At least your family is good for something.

619
01:24:35,182 --> 01:24:36,883
It serves many things.

620
01:26:28,010 --> 01:26:29,013
Who made this?

621
01:26:30,251 --> 01:26:31,316
Who was?

622
01:26:33,567 --> 01:26:34,570
Pavlo!

623
01:26:34,877 --> 01:26:37,599
Did you think it was some kind of joke?

624
01:26:38,408 --> 01:26:41,030
Are you crazy? What are you talking about?

625
01:26:44,150 --> 01:26:47,489
It's the kind of shit you would do.

626
01:26:48,271 --> 01:26:50,188
It was him. He did that.

627
01:26:50,963 --> 01:26:51,964
Whatever it is.

628
01:26:58,338 --> 01:26:59,634
Was it you?

629
01:27:02,134 --> 01:27:04,516
Stop there, you little bitch!

630
01:27:07,135 --> 01:27:08,219
Do you want to die?

631
01:27:10,242 --> 01:27:11,409
Control yourself.

632
01:27:14,438 --> 01:27:16,200
What are you going to do with it?

633
01:27:16,830 --> 01:27:18,044
What do you want me to do?

634
01:27:19,688 --> 01:27:20,985
Get rid of it.

635
01:27:22,539 --> 01:27:23,540
N�o.

636
01:27:25,688 --> 01:27:28,127
-Get in the car! -Go away now.

637
01:27:28,944 --> 01:27:30,645
We will not have our help!

638
01:27:32,290 --> 01:27:36,103
What I would expect from a man who doesn't control

639
01:27:36,418 --> 01:27:38,099
not even his wife?

640
01:27:59,467 --> 01:28:00,473
What was this?

641
01:28:10,409 --> 01:28:11,410
Partisans.

642
01:28:12,663 --> 01:28:13,664
Look.

643
01:28:17,355 --> 01:28:18,371
They are close.

644
01:28:20,025 --> 01:28:22,727
I hope they killed the Germans who stole us.

645
01:28:23,313 --> 01:28:24,724
They also stole from us.

646
01:28:42,753 --> 01:28:43,754
That night,

647
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:48,403
in the barn ...

648
01:29:21,527 --> 01:29:24,502
-You and you, come from behind! -Let's go!

649
01:29:28,854 --> 01:29:30,167
Get out of the house!

650
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:32,246
-What happened? -Shut up!

651
01:29:33,181 --> 01:29:36,199
-My children! -Proceed!

652
01:29:37,172 --> 01:29:38,824
C'mon C'mon!

653
01:29:41,188 --> 01:29:42,846
Let's get going.

654
01:29:43,162 --> 01:29:44,163
Or.

655
01:29:45,541 --> 01:29:46,875
Go up.

656
01:30:17,941 --> 01:30:19,447
C'mon C'mon!

657
01:30:25,838 --> 01:30:26,847
Spirit!

658
01:30:37,526 --> 01:30:39,650
Mom! Dad!

659
01:31:15,135 --> 01:31:18,908
Last night, an army base was attacked.

660
01:31:18,909 --> 01:31:21,272
And two of our soldiers were killed.

661
01:31:35,725 --> 01:31:37,575
OF hrer, Adolf Hitler,

662
01:31:37,576 --> 01:31:41,683
decreed that, in all occupied territories,

663
01:31:41,684 --> 01:31:47,547
to every German soldier killed by partisan bandits ...

664
01:31:54,563 --> 01:31:57,573
ten civilians are to be executed.

665
01:33:08,155 --> 01:33:09,156
Come on.

666
01:33:11,549 --> 01:33:12,550
Colonel?

667
01:33:14,976 --> 01:33:15,979
He's released.

668
01:33:42,130 --> 01:33:43,422
Prepare!

669
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:49,501
To point!

670
01:33:52,444 --> 01:33:53,445
Fire!

671
01:34:25,303 --> 01:34:27,478
Leave us where they are!

672
01:34:28,305 --> 01:34:30,716
V ov -seize them!

673
01:34:45,438 --> 01:34:48,718
JUNE, 1944

674
01:35:06,798 --> 01:35:09,460
Do you miss your brothers and sisters?

675
01:35:10,662 --> 01:35:14,172
I have no brothers or sisters. I already told you.

676
01:35:15,454 --> 01:35:16,918
But do you miss them?

677
01:35:17,911 --> 01:35:19,313
No, I don't.

678
01:35:21,883 --> 01:35:23,341
What do you miss?

679
01:35:30,271 --> 01:35:31,604
I don't miss anything.

680
01:35:50,178 --> 01:35:51,978
I didn't mean to say that inside.

681
01:35:52,797 --> 01:35:54,375
She asks a lot of questions.

682
01:35:56,354 --> 01:35:57,355
What is it?

683
01:36:00,698 --> 01:36:03,041
The Americans and Britons arrived in France.

684
01:36:03,763 --> 01:36:05,806
And the Russian army is approaching.

685
01:36:06,274 --> 01:36:07,358
Do you know what that means?

686
01:36:10,581 --> 01:36:11,582
Sim.

687
01:36:14,765 --> 01:36:15,956
There's something that ...

688
01:36:17,872 --> 01:36:19,219
I never asked you about that.

689
01:36:25,921 --> 01:36:28,427
That day in the country, you and Ivan ...

690
01:36:30,961 --> 01:36:33,271
Was it because of what he did to the Jewish girl?

691
01:36:40,379 --> 01:36:41,380
Sim.

692
01:38:45,407 --> 01:38:47,830
German soldiers! Hundreds!

693
01:38:47,831 --> 01:38:49,622
They will attack the Russian base.

694
01:38:50,532 --> 01:38:51,919
We have to go to the basement.

695
01:39:07,545 --> 01:39:08,742
Faster!

696
01:39:36,399 --> 01:39:39,447
Shem , Israel, Adonai is our God, Adonai is One.

697
01:39:40,606 --> 01:39:43,898
Shem , Israel, Adonai is our God, Adonai is One.

698
01:39:46,147 --> 01:39:49,355
Shem , Israel, Adonai is our God, Adonai is One.

699
01:39:50,753 --> 01:39:54,180
Shem , Israel, Adonai is our God, Adonai is One.

700
01:40:14,386 --> 01:40:15,387
It's all right.

701
01:40:55,655 --> 01:40:56,668
I'm Sara.

702
01:40:58,522 --> 01:41:00,437
My name is Sara G ralnik.

703
01:41:03,323 --> 01:41:04,638
I have to go home.

704
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:09,401
Para Korets?

705
01:41:14,863 --> 01:41:16,163
Has anyone survived there?

706
01:41:19,313 --> 01:41:20,509
Maybe my brother.

707
01:41:25,126 --> 01:41:26,151
No sure.

708
01:41:28,316 --> 01:41:31,745
Russians are worse animals than Germans.

709
01:41:35,913 --> 01:41:36,954
I will be fine.

710
01:41:49,918 --> 01:41:51,025
Goodbye, Danylo.

711
01:41:51,026 --> 01:41:53,631
So you have brothers?

712
01:41:55,155 --> 01:41:56,159
Have.

713
01:42:05,313 --> 01:42:06,384
Goodbye, Stepan.

714
01:42:06,896 --> 01:42:08,388
Are you coming back?

715
01:42:09,001 --> 01:42:10,002
Perhaps.

716
01:43:41,266 --> 01:43:42,347
Turn here!

717
01:43:42,852 --> 01:43:45,010
Fascists have not been here for a long time!

718
01:43:46,833 --> 01:43:49,118
They are already halfway to Germany.

719
01:43:52,914 --> 01:43:53,915
No!

720
01:43:54,615 --> 01:43:55,616
We hope!

721
01:43:56,235 --> 01:43:58,918
-Where are you going? -To Berlin!

722
01:43:59,847 --> 01:44:01,299
Please wait!

723
01:44:02,897 --> 01:44:04,180
Need help!

724
01:44:05,343 --> 01:44:06,630
Don't leave me!

725
01:44:12,677 --> 01:44:14,275
Kapinski!

726
01:44:16,793 --> 01:44:18,285
I'm Jewish!

727
01:44:19,356 --> 01:44:21,745
-What are you doing? -Stop the car.

728
01:45:06,936 --> 01:45:10,215
AFTER RETURNING TO KORETS,

729
01:45:10,216 --> 01:45:13,546
SARA KNEW HIS BROTHER MOISHE HAD BEEN BETRAYED,

730
01:45:13,547 --> 01:45:16,803
DELIVER TO THE GERMAN AUTHORITIES AND EXECUTED.

731
01:45:17,544 --> 01:45:22,586
SHE MARRIED A JEWISH SURVIVOR AND MIGRATED TO THE USA IN 1949,

732
01:45:22,587 --> 01:45:27,629
WHERE THE LEGACY OF HIS FAMILY CONTINUED, CREATING THREE CHILDREN AND FOUR GRANDCHILDREN.

733
01:46:02,861 --> 01:46:06,396
MY NAME SARA
