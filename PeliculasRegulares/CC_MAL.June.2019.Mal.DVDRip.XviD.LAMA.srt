1
00:00:36,335 --> 00:00:40,039
Hey, Mom?
What's up, I'm working.

2
00:00:40,072 --> 00:00:43,242
Get out. Art!
You just won five bucks!

3
00:00:43,274 --> 00:00:45,445
You finally got a real job?

4
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:46,880
Sound design is a real job.

5
00:00:46,912 --> 00:00:50,082
You re actually a
professional sound designer?

6
00:00:50,115 --> 00:00:53,085
Not exactly, I'm still
doing foley. But I'm

7
00:00:53,118 --> 00:00:53,753
getting paid this time!

8
00:00:53,786 --> 00:00:55,353
I'm so proud of you!

9
00:00:55,387 --> 00:00:57,590
It's going in the church
bulletin. What's it called?

10
00:00:57,622 --> 00:01:00,559
It's an indie movie, it probably

11
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:02,061
won't come to theatres near you.

12
00:01:02,094 --> 00:01:04,597
You probably won't see it.
You know what, I've actually

13
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:08,700
really gotta finish this. So I'll call
you back later okay love you, bye!

14
00:01:32,606 --> 00:01:36,037
<b>JUNE, ADRIFT</b>

15
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,360
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

16
00:01:46,671 --> 00:01:49,774
Hurry Barkley.
You will be late for class.

17
00:01:49,808 --> 00:01:52,512
Thanks, Babcia.

18
00:02:07,793 --> 00:02:11,831
You want me to clock
you in, it's gonna cost ya!

19
00:02:36,254 --> 00:02:38,723
Rachel, you
didn't have to do that!

20
00:02:38,757 --> 00:02:40,325
It wasn't any trouble.

21
00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:43,528
To pack up my classroom?
You already had to pack up yours!

22
00:02:43,562 --> 00:02:46,699
I wanted to make sure
you didn't have any excuses

23
00:02:46,731 --> 00:02:48,867
not to go on
your date with Mark.

24
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:50,436
You set me up
on a date with Mark?

25
00:02:50,468 --> 00:02:53,705
No, I can't, I couldn't,
he's so cute!

26
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:55,106
It'll be great.

27
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,742
I still have to find a
summer home for that'stupid turtle.

28
00:02:57,776 --> 00:02:59,812
I sent your class turtle
home with Benny Schwartzman.

29
00:02:59,844 --> 00:03:02,215
And there's this
UPS package on my desk

30
00:03:02,247 --> 00:03:03,415
that I still need to mail.

31
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:05,151
I saw it! Already mailed it.

32
00:03:05,183 --> 00:03:10,522
My god. Really?
That is amazing. Rach,

33
00:03:10,556 --> 00:03:14,393
st... I mean, but wait, don't... I
ught that you liked Mark?

34
00:03:14,425 --> 00:03:19,264
I couldn't possibly date
anyone ht now. I'm way too busy.

35
00:03:33,444 --> 00:03:37,449
I don't know what my mom is
elling people, but I have a job!

36
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:39,318
Have you eaten yet today?

37
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,621
and I don't need her friends
to me up on pity dates, you know?

38
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,890
Do you have something
I can put water in?

39
00:03:44,923 --> 00:03:48,360
On top of the fridge.
Contrary to popular belief,

40
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,296
am not the ideal match for all
sement-dwelling mouth-breathers.

41
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,766
Do you ever open your mail?

42
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:57,503
Yeah, I've been busy this week.

43
00:03:57,536 --> 00:03:59,572
This is from December.
From your parents?

44
00:03:59,604 --> 00:04:01,373
I'm getting to it,
it's on my to-do list.

45
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,676
She was trying to hook me up
with an unemployed

46
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:06,945
thirty six year old who still
hasn't finished undergrad.

47
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:10,650
Em, sorry about your day.

48
00:04:14,652 --> 00:04:16,555
Merry Christmas
friends and family!

49
00:04:16,588 --> 00:04:19,891
This year has brought us many
blessings. Arthur and I are

50
00:04:19,925 --> 00:04:25,398
nning for our 60 day summer
ise to Australia. Anchors away!

51
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,498
Hannah and her wonderful
husband Brandon

52
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:33,305
have secured political asylum
for 112 more Sudanese refugees.

53
00:04:33,338 --> 00:04:36,809
So proud of you two.
A little birdy told us

54
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:40,812
Kent and Amy are
expecting some good news!

55
00:04:40,846 --> 00:04:46,552
Congratulations you guys.
Meanwhile, Emma is still

56
00:04:46,584 --> 00:04:51,356
trying to do the LA thing!
We re all pullin for ya, but

57
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:55,360
remember, we still haven't
packed up your bedroom.

58
00:04:56,629 --> 00:05:05,772
You have options. They included
you in the letter this year.

59
00:05:16,682 --> 00:05:18,318
You suck.

60
00:05:22,987 --> 00:05:24,857
This is Kasia, I call
your mother five times.

61
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:27,993
I cannot stay open for this.
Come pick up her order now.

62
00:05:38,336 --> 00:05:40,740
Shit.

63
00:05:44,976 --> 00:05:46,611
So hot right now.

64
00:05:46,644 --> 00:05:47,879
What did I say?

65
00:05:47,913 --> 00:05:53,018
No talking.
So hot! So hot!

66
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,420
Shut the door!

67
00:05:54,452 --> 00:05:55,587
Get the keys!

68
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,722
They re not here! Help me look!

69
00:05:57,755 --> 00:05:59,824
Dude, I'm looking for my pants!

70
00:06:04,696 --> 00:06:06,465
Fuuu...

71
00:06:06,497 --> 00:06:08,567
Hey, so, what
are you up to tomorrow?

72
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,703
I'm totally free;
tomorrow's my only day off.

73
00:06:10,735 --> 00:06:12,337
Sweet, I need
you to cover my shift.

74
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,072
Wait, I ve never
worked in lumber before!

75
00:06:14,105 --> 00:06:18,810
That's fine, you're mexican,
you can do it, right? Lo siento.

76
00:06:36,995 --> 00:06:40,600
You missed dinner.

77
00:06:47,572 --> 00:06:50,875
You are better than this.

78
00:06:50,908 --> 00:06:53,545
I'm sorry.

79
00:07:09,161 --> 00:07:12,131
Hey, mom, you know it is
three in the morning here, right?

80
00:07:12,163 --> 00:07:13,665
I know you weren't sleeping.

81
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,067
True.

82
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,836
Well, I hate to lose
it because it's the'source

83
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:19,138
of some of my best material,
but it's time.

84
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,505
Time for what, mom?

85
00:07:20,538 --> 00:07:23,175
It's time to throw out the boat.

86
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:24,743
What?

87
00:07:24,776 --> 00:07:26,011
We re leaving tomorrow for
our trip so I'm clearing out the

88
00:07:26,043 --> 00:07:28,746
garage for the July renters.
Plus. You promised me

89
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:30,748
if you didn't fix it by the time
you were twenty five

90
00:07:30,781 --> 00:07:32,116
I could get rid of it.

91
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:35,086
Wait... I really want
to finish it though.

92
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,889
You re never
gonna get around to it.

93
00:07:36,922 --> 00:07:39,024
Seriously, I will finish it
the next time I am out there.

94
00:07:39,057 --> 00:07:41,894
Emma, I don't want to have
that boat in my garage for another

95
00:07:41,927 --> 00:07:44,930
eight years. It's going out by
the bins for next Tuesday's

96
00:07:44,963 --> 00:07:46,632
trash pickup. End of story.

97
00:07:46,665 --> 00:07:47,900
Okay.

98
00:07:47,932 --> 00:07:48,666
Love you!

99
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:50,870
Love you too, mom.

100
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,238
Where is my shirt?

101
00:08:27,271 --> 00:08:30,909
Where is the shirt? Every time,

102
00:08:30,942 --> 00:08:33,111
I cannot find it.
I am looking for it,

103
00:08:33,144 --> 00:08:35,114
it was here, now it's not here!

104
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:38,783
In the kitchen.
Looking for... Thank you!

105
00:08:38,817 --> 00:08:45,224
You could have said...
you did it for me! Love you!

106
00:08:47,692 --> 00:08:49,627
English! In this house!
She is graduating!

107
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,695
Glue it!

108
00:08:50,729 --> 00:08:54,066
I'm taking the flag!
I am taking the flag!

109
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:06,110
I made this for you. For today.

110
00:09:06,144 --> 00:09:08,748
Babcia!

111
00:09:19,024 --> 00:09:22,160
Barkley, hurry up in there,
your mother needs to get ready.

112
00:09:22,193 --> 00:09:23,695
We leave for commencement
in thirty minutes!

113
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,230
I dropped out.

114
00:09:26,264 --> 00:09:28,834
What? I cannot hear you,
your mother needs to peepee.

115
00:09:28,866 --> 00:09:30,802
Tata, I dropped out.

116
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:36,975
What? What.
Barkley, open the door.

117
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,010
Barkley, you're
trying my patience!

118
00:09:39,043 --> 00:09:42,180
Okay, I'm not angry,
I just want to talk,

119
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:46,251
okay, okay, okay, just
open the damn door!

120
00:09:46,283 --> 00:09:50,623
What is going on,
Barkley, we are leaving soon.

121
00:09:50,655 --> 00:09:51,789
She's not graduating!

122
00:09:51,822 --> 00:09:53,158
She's not graduating?

123
00:09:53,191 --> 00:09:54,826
I left school, Mama.

124
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,860
What?

125
00:09:55,894 --> 00:09:57,129
She is graduating!

126
00:09:57,162 --> 00:10:00,199
That's not how it works!
I left three months ago!

127
00:10:00,231 --> 00:10:03,302
Where have you been going
every day for that time!

128
00:10:03,335 --> 00:10:04,670
Ace hardware?

129
00:10:04,702 --> 00:10:07,005
Open the goddamn door, come
out here and tell it to my face!

130
00:10:07,038 --> 00:10:08,606
How could you do it to us?

131
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,774
I'm not happy!

132
00:10:09,807 --> 00:10:13,144
Who gives shit! You
don't work to be happy,

133
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:16,148
you work to feed your family,
to put roof over your head!

134
00:10:16,181 --> 00:10:19,852
Jesus, you love engineering,
you were on the top in your class!

135
00:10:19,884 --> 00:10:21,653
Just because you
re good at something

136
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,656
doesn't mean you
like it, I hated it!

137
00:10:23,688 --> 00:10:28,092
Okay, so just tell me,
what are you going to do?

138
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,226
I don't know!

139
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:33,665
She doesn't know.
What a beautiful plan!

140
00:10:33,698 --> 00:10:36,200
Sleep with strange men,
don't worry about it,

141
00:10:36,234 --> 00:10:40,205
just have fun, that's all
that's important!

142
00:10:42,807 --> 00:10:46,879
I'm getting the'screwdriver!
Open... open it!

143
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:54,019
I didn't know you
made the decision to sell.

144
00:10:54,052 --> 00:10:55,788
Yeah, it
seemed like the right time.

145
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,691
With you and Chris outta the
house it's time to downsize.

146
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:02,094
Okay, well, I can get
a plane ticket right away,

147
00:11:02,126 --> 00:11:04,362
so I can come help you
fix up the place for buyers.

148
00:11:04,395 --> 00:11:08,000
Honey, I ve been working
on the place for months. It's all done.

149
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:11,036
Okay, well, I
can help you pack up.

150
00:11:11,068 --> 00:11:12,170
I got it.

151
00:11:12,203 --> 00:11:13,572
How about I...

152
00:11:13,605 --> 00:11:16,341
Honey, it is under
control. Do not rearrange your plans

153
00:11:16,374 --> 00:11:21,312
on my account. You do you
this summer. Okay? I love you.

154
00:11:21,346 --> 00:11:22,648
Love you.

155
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:25,718

156
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:16,335
Hey, why so tense, doll?
