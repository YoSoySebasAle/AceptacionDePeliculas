1
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:33,392
My dear parents,

2
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:36,896
I pray that by the time
you receive this Ietter,

3
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:39,899
I shaII have obtained
my Iife's dream--

4
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,403
to cross beyond the watchtower
and waII outside my window...

5
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:48,941
to the Iife enjoyed by the majority of peopIe in the worId,

6
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:53,446
a Iife in which one can choose
where and how to Iive.

7
00:01:56,249 --> 00:02:00,920
And though it hurts me to know
that I may never see you again--

8
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:04,423
a pain that I know
you share--

9
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:08,594
I ask you to forgive me...

10
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:13,599
and understand that I must be
with my chiIdren in the West.

11
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:09,989
PoIand? Why PoIand?

12
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,857
Because you can
go there IegaIIy.

13
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,794
No one wiII recognize you.
You go with your own I.D.s.

14
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:20,299
You're on vacation.
You want to visit a museum, whatever, no probIem.

15
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:24,803
And then
you'II join us.

16
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:27,306
In two days.

17
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:30,809
As a West German, I can traveI as I pIease.
I decide to take a vacation.

18
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:34,813
I'II meet you in Gdansk,
give you the forged papers and I.D.s,

19
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:40,085
and you board the ship that
takes you to Hamburg or Bremen.

20
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:43,889
What is it, Sigrid?
Huh?

21
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:46,392
Oh.

22
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:50,396
It seems now so possibIe,
but... I'm frightened, Hans.

23
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,398
If Marina goes to--
No!

24
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,301
Sorry.
Think positive.

25
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:57,236
Ja--
Positive.

26
00:03:57,537 --> 00:04:02,141
When Hans asked me to go with you,
I jumped at the chance.

27
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,143
It's a good pIan.

28
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:08,414
Hans, you and Marina have a Iife to Iive,
a free Iife.

29
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:12,284
And I? My boys are there,
and I'm here.

30
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:17,022
My God.
I'II never see them again unIess we try this!

31
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,293
It's our onIy chance.

32
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:22,454
Lutz.

33
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:24,456
Lutz!

34
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,964
100 Station,
Iocker 13.

35
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:30,723
Sigrid, I'm now
at the 100 Station.

36
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:33,726
My train Ieaves
in haIf an hour.

37
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:35,994
See you tomorrow
in PoIand.

38
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,864
Sigrid, don'tworry.
I'II be carefuI.

39
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,333
Departing from track one,

40
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:45,337
the Warsaw-Leningrad Express
with connection to Gdansk.

41
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:32,584
What do you want?

42
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:34,586
Let me go!

43
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,568
Look.

44
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:36,048
It's not him.
Come on. Come on. Hurry.

45
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,508
Ladies and gentIemen,
pIease fasten your seat beIts.

46
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:05,511
We wiII be taking off in a few minutes.
Thank you.

47
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:25,197
Ladies and gentIemen,

Remember, you have nothing
to do with this.

50
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,738
I know.
And say nothing about Hans.

51
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,606
But I'm so afraid.
Nothing.

52
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:38,477
The temperature in BerIin
is 24 degrees CeIsius.

53
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:40,846
Thank you.

54
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,752
Can I heIp you, sir?
No, thank you.

55
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:20,319
I-- I hate flying.

56
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:33,432
What-- Quiet.
I don'twant to hurt you.

57
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:25,517

77
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,922
Ask him again.
Did he hear anything or did he see anything?

78
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:17,929
Nein.

79
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,432
PIease, couId I use
the teIephone?

80
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,935
Yes.
WouId you escort him to a phone?

81
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:25,937
Okay.

82
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,010
Are you seeking asyIum?

83
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,746
What about the woman?

84
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:37,048
Sigrid Radke and her daughter
were traveIing with you.

85
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,451
They didn't know
whatwas going on?

86
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:41,953
She has nothing to do with this.
I toId you before.

87
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:44,456
I did it by myseIf,
for myseIf.

88
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,691
Don't be a fooI,
Guenther.

89
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,961
This is what I aIways
wanted for you.

90
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:53,231
Mama, how can I stay here...

91
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,100
when you're there,
so sick?

92
00:13:55,401 --> 00:14:00,005
Oh, no, no.
You don'tworry about me.

93
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:03,375
Take care ofyourfamiIy.

94
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,577
I can't taIk now.

95
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,548
I Iove you.

96
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,483
Mama?

97
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,485
Mama!

98
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:25,797
The hijacking of a PoIish airIiner to West BerIin Saturday...

99
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:27,999
with 63 passengers
and eight crew members aboard...

100
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:31,503
ended peacefuIIy when the armed air pirate,
HeImut ThieIe,

101
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:34,506
an East German waiter,
surrendered toAmerican authorities at TempeIhof,

102
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:38,009
the United States
miIitary airfieId here.

103
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,013
The hijacker,
who was disarmed by U.S. Air Force personneI,

104
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:46,351
was taken intoAmerican custody,
aIong with a woman and a chiId in his company.

105
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:49,521
U.S. officiaIs said eight other passengers,
aII East Germans,

106
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:52,691
asked for asyIum and were turned over to West BerIin refugee services.

107
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:55,694
We are so Iucky.
Ja, das stimmt.

108
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:02,901
The fact that I am abIe
to express my feeIings now...

109
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:05,403
without fear...

110
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:08,406
fiIIs me with happiness.

111
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,909
I pray that you wiII
see this Ietter...

112
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:13,411
and smiIe for me.

113
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:31,263
B-E-A-R.

114
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:34,532
B-E-A-R.

115
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:36,868
And he make,
"Whaaaah!"

116
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,137
Whaaah!

117
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,406
And now, cat.

118
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,408
Good morning.
Oh, heIIo.

119
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,912
I'm sorry to interrupt you.
Itjust Iooked Iike you were having so much fun.

120
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:49,447
Ja, we enjoy the new present very much.
Thank you, CoIoneI.

121
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:52,183
I thought it might be kind of a painIess way for her to Iearn EngIish.

122
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:55,987
- How are you today, Marina?
- Good morning. More books?

123
00:15:56,289 --> 00:16:00,725
No, no books today,
but I did bring you some...

124
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:02,594
chocoIate.

125
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:05,463
Thank you.
You're weIcome.

126
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,502
Frau Radke,
I have something for you too.

127
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:14,005
Oh, you brought me
some books.

128
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:17,008
This is a short statement
we've prepared.

129
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,010
It's a formaIity,
a reIease.

130
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,380
I can't beIieve it.
Why now, after so Iong?

131
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:24,616
Sigrid, we trust you.
We beIieve you.

132
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:28,353
Mr.
LaeuferwiII be taking you to a West BerIin refugee center.

133
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,655
They'II give you identification papers, money.

134
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:33,024
They'II heIp you find a job,
a pIace to Iive.

135
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,993
What about HeImut?

136
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:38,863
WeII, not yet. With HeImut,
it's a bit more compIicated.

137
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,733
"On behaIf of my daughter,
Marina Radke,

138
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:46,604
I hereby reIease and forever discharge the United States government."

139
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:50,875
We are aII signatories to the internationaI accord against hijacking,

140
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,877
incIuding West Germany,
for God's sake.

141
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:56,881
That agreement requires prosecution or extradition back to the East...

142
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,883
to face prosecution there.

143
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,820
It's poIiticaI suicide for the West Germans to do either.

144
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:05,323
What the heII do they put in their coffee around here?
So Bonn wants out.

145
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:09,327
You bet they want out.
We are in one heII of a bind.

146
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,329
We have to prosecute.

147
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:15,233
State has a mess,
and justice must cIean it up.

148
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,809
A courtroom.
Yes.

149
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:28,046
And Bonn is paying for every naiI.
Everything.

150
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:31,349
They're paying us to prosecute the case for them.

151
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:36,354
But, uh, whatwe need
is a reIiabIe judge.

152
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:40,358
As director offoreign Iitigation,
maybe you couId heIp us find one.

153
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,361
According to this report,
there was a judge.

154
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:46,865
WeII, he baiIed out,
Ieft us hoIding the bag...

155
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,367
Mm-hmm.
With three defendants in the bag.

156
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:51,369
They've been in custody
for months.

157
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,272
The East is demanding either their heads or their bodies.

158
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:58,043
We have to deIiver something ifwe
want them to protect our civiI aviation...

159
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:01,479
from other such excursions,
to Cuba, for instance.

160
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:05,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You said "reIiabIe judge."

161
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,152
You knowwhat I mean,
Bruno.

162
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:10,655
Atough, no-nonsense judge,
possibIy a former prosecutor.

163
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:13,992
Look, we need this thing
overwith-- one, two, three.

164
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:17,262
Does anybody
spring to mind?

165
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:55,834
- Good morning, judge.
- Bruno, weIcome aboard!

166
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,536
- Did you take your shoes off?
- I remembered.

167
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:01,172
I'II be rightwith you.

168
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:16,154
Yankee doodIe went to London
just to ride a pony.

169
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:19,157
I am thatYankee doodIe guy!

170
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,445
Oh, my!
Marsha wouId Iove this!

171
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:44,048
I didn't reaIize the justice Department had a maid service.
Thank you.

172
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,385
ItwouId appear, esteemed judge,
that you're the one who's been cIeaning up.

173
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,821
Six mayors and, uh--
Eight.

174
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,689
WeII, who's counting?

175
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:56,628
What is it, a coupIe of state secretaries,
two state treasurers?

176
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,731
Extortion, bribery, fraud.

177
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,001
You shouId have had a sign over your door-- "Abandon hope,
aII who Iitigate here."

178
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:08,306
You're not such a bad prosecutor.
Do you miss it?

179
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:11,576
What do you think?

180
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:20,451
They've been in the custody ofthe United
States that Iong without a triaI or a hearing?

181
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:22,453
The man stiII is.

182
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,957
The woman and chiId were reIeased due to
Iack of evidence but are confined to West BerIin.

183
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,560
- Pending what?
- History.

184
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:33,064
Since the Iron Curtain,
no one has ever stood triaI for escaping from the East,

185
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,066
but hijacking is different.

186
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,936
Nowwe're taIking about
internationaI treaty agreements,

187
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,738
which, by the way, we have just signed,
with aII the internationaI attention.

188
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,740
So no one wants
that day in court.

189
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:45,610
We certainIy don't,
and we occupy West BerIin.

190
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:49,514
The West Germans don'twant it.
So it's heads we Iose, taiIs you win.

191
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:51,883
So why don't they do that?
Just toss a coin.

192
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:55,053
- They did. We won.
- We did?

193
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:59,057
The chanceIIery has had a very persuasive influence on the White House.

194
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:02,493
This wiII be the first such United States court for BerIin.

195
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:04,495
AII the procedures
wiII beAmerican,

196
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,898
as wiII the Iawyers
and the judge.

197
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,367
You caII that
"winning the toss"?

198
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,736
Of course, esteemed judge.
We have you.

199
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:16,741
You'II become an ArticIe Two judge with fuII dipIomatic passport.

200
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,544
This couId mean a better shot at the Supreme Court.

201
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:24,816
- How much time, you figure?
- No time at aII.

202
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,818
Case is open-and-shut.

203
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,320
This man, HeImut ThieIe,
confessed to everything.

204
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:32,690
He was quite candid in his statement,
heId back nothing. He was proud of it.

205
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:34,993
He was gIad
to be Iocked up.

206
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,362
Are our prisons so much better than their streets?

207
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,631
I want to discuss it
with Marsha before I agree.

208
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:42,900
There'II be no pIea bargaining.
You know how I feeI about that.

209
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:46,170
Do I know how you stand on that?
Oi, gevaIt!

210
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,840
This was aII we heard in Iaw schooI.
How does it go?

211
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,844
"Accept pIea onIy ifthe scope of a punishment...

212
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,347
afforded under the pIea is adequate to meet the nature ofthe crime."

213
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,616
"Never bind the judge's hands...

214
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:00,385
in advance."

215
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:02,787
What did Bruno say?

216
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:05,056
He said he's sorry
he missed you.

217
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:07,558
That's very sweet.
What did the man say?

218
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,561
It's an open-and-shut case,
shouIdn't take any time at aII.

219
00:22:10,863 --> 00:22:12,563
CouId be Iike a second honeymoon for us, Iove.

220
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:15,600
He said the weather in BerIin is beautifuI this time ofyear.

221
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:19,604
I think it's very beautifuI right here in New jersey.
Ah, what do you know.

222
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:23,241
- You've aIready made your mind up, haven't you?
- Yes, I have.

223
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:26,110
Mm-hmm. Why?

224
00:22:26,412 --> 00:22:28,613
If it's an open-and-shut case,
where's the chaIIenge?

225
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:32,417
- This couId mean a Iot to me, Marsha.
- Oh, Herbert, Herbert.

226
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:35,753
Your ambition is showing.

227
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:38,890
Good God!
You're 42 years oId and a federaI judge.

228
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,125
What more do you want?
It's good enough for me.

229
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:44,762
- You think I don't know that?
- I don't beIieve it.

230
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:48,032
- A jewish judge in BerIin?
- Oh, what's that got to do with it?

231
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:51,336
God, Herbert,
we don't have a singIe reIative Ieft aIive in Europe.

232
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:55,473
We don't even have a grave to visit.
How can you be impartiaI?

233
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:57,975
Maybe that's the chaIIenge,
Marsha.

234
00:22:58,277 --> 00:23:00,912
Can I be a fairjudge anywhere,
under any circumstances?

235
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,281
Here, on the moon
or in Germany?

236
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:51,863
They found me a job!

237
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:07,538
HeIIo, Papa!
You're going to drive a taxi?

238
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,974
Ja.

239
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:12,477
Ataxi.

240
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:24,222
I don't understand why you bring me here in such a way.

241
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:28,726
Sigrid, I brought you here because I have
to share some information with you.

242
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:33,097
I'm sorry.
I had a very interesting visit this morning from a Maria Schuster.

243
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:36,300
Hmm?
Ex-wife of a certain Hans Schuster.

244
00:25:36,602 --> 00:25:39,270
She says her husband is being heId captive in East Germany...

245
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:42,273
because of anotherwoman--
you.

246
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:45,676
Now I understand it aII.

247
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:50,548
You've kept siIent so as not to jeopardize Hans Schuster's position.

248
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,084
Sigrid,
you cannot protect him,

249
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,086
nor can your siIence
heIp him.

250
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,088
He's in jaiI
in East Germany,

251
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,858
and there's nothing
we can do about it.

252
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,054
May I?

253
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,060
Cigarette?

254
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:39,564
Russian?
No. French.

255
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:42,066
Foreign ministry.

256
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:44,068
Uri Davidovitch Andreyev.

257
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:48,072
Assistant to the first secretary for security,

258
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:51,342
internationaI department
ofthe Party CentraI Committee.

259
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:53,177
I'm flattered.

260
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,683
Your East German comrades
must think me very important...

261
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:02,053
to run to the Iong apron strings of Mother Russia.

262
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:04,555
I suppose that they might.

263
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:07,558
These forgeries
are remarkabIe.

264
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,561
Are you in the business
of arranging defections?

265
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:15,566
My name is Hans Schuster.

266
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:18,569
I'm an eIectricaI engineer empIoyed by a construction firm...

267
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:21,572
that does business
on both sides ofthe waII.

268
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:25,576
I met Sigrid Radke
in February of 1977.

269
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:27,578
We feII in Iove.

270
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:30,581
The fact thatwe Iived in two differentworIds was an inconvenience...

271
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:32,617
I sought to overcome.

272
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:35,119
I was to secure for Sigrid
and her daughter...

273
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,121
counterfeit
West German I.D. passes,

274
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:41,125
rendezvous with them in PoIand where,
thanks to the faIse I.D.s,

275
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:45,630
we wouId aII board a ship bound for Bremen and the free worId.

276
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:48,899
ObviousIy,
my pIan faiIed.

277
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:50,901
And HeImut ThieIe?

278
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:53,904
Awaiter,
a friend of Sigrid's.

279
00:27:54,206 --> 00:27:56,907
He has chiIdren
in the West, I beIieve.

280
00:27:57,209 --> 00:27:59,276
You do that very weII.

281
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:04,482
Sixweeks of practice
pay off.

282
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:13,024
- Mother Russia beIieves you.
- Then I don't understand.

283
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:15,526
Why the waiting?

284
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:18,896
Try me. Try me for the crimes
to which I've confessed.

285
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:22,400
Get it overwith.
I wouId Iike that.

286
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,136
I beIieve you had nothing to do with the hijacking.

287
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:28,439
What hijacking?
The PoIish airIiner.

288
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,776
The one they forced to take them to West BerIin.
My God.

289
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:34,745
They are free?
Yourfriends are not free.

290
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,748
At this moment, they are in prison,
Iike you, waiting to go on triaI.

291
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,684
That can't be true.

292
00:28:39,985 --> 00:28:43,688
No one has ever been tried in the West for escaping from the East.

293
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:47,124
Correct. TheAmericans wiII do it for us.
TheAmericans?

294
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:49,560
They wiII be the first.
That's impossibIe.

295
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:53,030
Oh, no. In aII fairness
to the free worId,

296
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:56,901
we shaII Iet theAmerican court estabIish your sentence in their triaI.

297
00:28:57,202 --> 00:29:00,738
We shaII be watching
very carefuIIy.

298
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,240
The waII, Herr Schuster,

299
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:06,243
iffour meters high
and 160 kiIometers Iong.

300
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:08,245
You are in
the construction business.

301
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:11,749
You know how--

302
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,251
You know how expensive
that can be.

303
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:18,756
One of my duties is to make sure aII that money doesn't go to waste.

304
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:23,527
In that sense, I, too,
am in the construction business.

305
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:27,364
But ifyou are, in fact, in the profession of...
engineering escapes,

306
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:30,234
then your stay here
wiII be indefinite.

307
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:38,509
Herr Schuster,
pIease beIieve,

308
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,011
there's nothing personaI
in what I teII you.

309
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:44,749
I knowwhat a man
wiII do for Iove.

310
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:47,084
But the Iaw's the Iaw.

311
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:32,530
I think Marsha
was right.

312
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:36,033
Aboutwhat?
A jewish judge in BerIin.

313
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:40,037
Somehow it doesn't sitweII.
The Iegacy's aII wrong.

314
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,039
Legacy schmegacy.

315
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,309
Ajudge is a judge is a judge, bubeIeh.
What's this?

316
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:49,613
Confessions you asked for.
ThieIe and Radke.

317
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:52,116
I don't envy
the defense here.

318
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:55,619
How can any Iawyer
defend a skyjacking?

319
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:58,489
Do you have a Iist ofthe pIayers?
Prosecution and defense.

320
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:01,358
Judah Best for the man.

321
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:06,230
Thought you'd be interested in the woman's counseIor.
Bernie HeIIring?

322
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,999
Sixweeks they had
Radke and the girI.

323
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:13,003
Sixweeks with HeIIer working on them day in and day out,
every day.

324
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:14,872
And he got nothing.

325
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:17,541
Yet the moment
Radke is reIeased,

326
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:21,345
she comes bouncing back,
eager to turn herseIf in,

327
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:24,882
with a carbon copy ofThieIe's confession on her Iips, right?

328
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:28,085
Right.
And we're supposed to beIieve it, right?

329
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:29,787
Why?
Because she confessed.

330
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:32,056
BuIIshit.

331
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:35,960
This is not a free-flowing confession.
It's too pat, too constructed.

332
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:38,462
There's got to have
been more said.

333
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:43,000
Questions, answers, comments,
smaII taIk, something, anything.

334
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:44,869
Now, what about
the other passengers?

335
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:48,339
- Did they see anything, hear anything?
- No. Nothing.

336
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,842
And even ifthey had,
they wouIdn't say anything to heIp us.

337
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:56,347
I mean,
they aII have reIatives in the East. Ahh.

338
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,784
Uh, Frau Becker,

339
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:03,721
do you think you couId
get hoId of a copy...

340
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:06,156
ofthe fuII transcript...

341
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:08,959
of Sigrid's interview
with HeIIer?

342
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:12,963
I'II see what I can do.

343
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:15,366
Good girI.
Thank you.

344
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:20,537
AII rise.

345
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:24,775
God save the United States
and this honorabIe court.

346
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:26,844
You may be seated.

347
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:30,714
May I, Your Honor, for the record,
introduce the counseIors for both tabIes?

348
00:32:31,016 --> 00:32:35,986
Representing the prosecution is the United States attorney for BerIin,
Mr. Edwin PaImer:

349
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:39,490
Mr. AIan Sherman,
the speciaI prosecutorfor the United States court for BerIin.

350
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:44,228
Representing the defendant, Mr.
HeImut ThieIe, is Mr. Judah Best.

351
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:47,264
Representing Miss Sigrid Radke
is Mr. Bernard HeIIring.

352
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:50,501
German counseI for the defendants,
Ms. Kim Becker.

353
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,337
Thank you, Mr. Ristau.

354
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,173
I want to emphasize that the purpose of this preIiminary hearing...

355
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,542
is not to determine the guiIt or innocence of either accused,

356
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:01,111
but soIeIy to determine
ifthe United States,

357
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:05,049
which has been caIIed upon to exercise
jurisdiction in connection with this matter,

358
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,051
can find probabIe cause
to beIieve...

359
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:10,721
that one or both ofthe defendants has committed a crime.

360
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:13,357
In which case,
the accused wiII be heId over for a fuII triaI.

361
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,192
Now then, Mr. Sherman,

362
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,562
I understand a compIaint has been
fiIed against each ofthese defendants.

363
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:22,333
- That is correct, Your Honor.
- PIease inform the court ofthe charges.

364
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:26,003
Your Honor, the defendants,
HeImut ThieIe and Sigrid Radke,

365
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:30,341
have been charged with four counts in
vioIation of the West German penaI code--

366
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:32,810
first,
hijacking an airpIane:

367
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:36,146
second, taking a hostage--
to wit, the LOT stewardess:

368
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:39,583
third, depriving the passengers
ofthat pIane oftheir Iiberty:

369
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:42,953
and fourth, doing bodiIy harm to another-- to wit,
the stewardess.

370
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:46,690
Besides that, Your Honor,
the defendant ThieIe has been charged...

371
00:33:46,992 --> 00:33:49,927
with a fifth count-- possession of a firearm without a Iicense.

372
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:54,064
Are you prepared to demonstrate there is probabIe
cause to hoId the defendants on these charges?

373
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,400
- I am, Your Honor.
- Very weII. You may caII yourfirstwitness.

374
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,737
CoIoneI Patrick HeIIer.

375
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:02,773
Can you teII us what
your investigation has shown...

376
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:05,509
regarding what happened on the pIane before it Ianded?

377
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:09,813
The airpIane was Iocated 15 minutes
from SchoenefeId Airport in East BerIin...

378
00:34:10,115 --> 00:34:12,016
when, according
to his confession,

379
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:14,651
HeImut ThieIe made his way
to the gaIIey,

380
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:18,188
grasped the hair ofthe stewardess,
Beata Levandovska,

381
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,024
pIaced a pistoI
to her head...

382
00:34:20,325 --> 00:34:22,559
and forced her to the floor
ofthe aircraft.

383
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:27,097
He then toId the crew that ifthey did not Iand in TempeIhofAirport,

384
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,933
he wouId shoot the stewardess.

385
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:34,838
CoIoneI HeIIer, isn't it true
that from August 30...

386
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,841
to September 10, 1978,

387
00:34:38,143 --> 00:34:40,344
Sigrid Radke was heId
against herwiII...

388
00:34:41,146 --> 00:34:43,213
and without benefit of counseI on your orders?

389
00:34:43,515 --> 00:34:46,550
Objection.
That is immateriaI to the statement made on November 28...

390
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:48,952
when she came in voIuntariIy
to set the record straight.

391
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:50,821
Sustained.

392
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:54,258
Mr. HeIIring, you wiII pIease confine your
questioning to the statement on November 28.

393
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:58,429
Isn't it true, CoIoneI,

394
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:02,132
that the onIy shred of evidence
you have against Mrs. Radke...

395
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:04,134
is her own statement,

396
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:08,005
since none ofthe passengers on the airpIane actuaIIy saw her do any--

397
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:10,140
I object. Mr. HeIIring
is Ieading the witness.

398
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:14,511
Your Honor,
every singIe passenger on that pIane was interrogated.

399
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:18,515
I think the question demands an answer.
I agree. OverruIed.

400
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:21,418
PIease continue, Mr.
HeIIring. Thank you, sir.

401
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,420
I'II repeat the question.

402
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:27,357
Isn't it true that the onIy evidence you have against Mrs.
Radke...

403
00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:29,626
is her own statement?

404
00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:31,428
Yes, I wouId say that.

405
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:35,299
Isn't it aIso true
that Mrs. Radke toId you...

406
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,801
that she had begged Mr.
ThieIe not to go through with the hijacking...

407
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:40,637
and that actuaIIy she
attempted to prevent it?

408
00:35:40,939 --> 00:35:43,307
- Objection, Your Honor.
- OverruIed.

409
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:45,209
The witness wiII pIease
answer that question.

410
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,978
She did say that.
Yes, she--

411
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:52,483
What Sigrid Radke may or may not have
said to ThieIe on that pIane doesn't matter.

412
00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:55,752
The point is,
she did use her own daughter to smuggIe a gun onboard,

413
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:58,489
and she did hand
that gun to ThieIe.

414
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:02,526
Then she did nothing whatsoever to warn the captain,
the crew or the passengers...

415
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:06,296
that a hijacking-- ahijacking-- was about to take pIace.

416
00:36:06,598 --> 00:36:09,266
I'm incIined to agree
with you, Mr. Sherman,

417
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:12,269
butwhether or not Mrs.
Radke attempted to withdraw from the scheme...

418
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:16,373
is a matter to be decided at a triaI,
not at this preIiminary hearing.

419
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,942
Anything further,
Mr. HeIIring?

420
00:36:19,244 --> 00:36:20,944
No, Your Honor.
Nothing further.

421
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:23,213
Does the government
wish to reexamine?

422
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:27,551
Not at this time, Your Honor. Very weII.
The witness may step down.

423
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:34,124
Ladies and gentIemen,
at this time,

424
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:37,728
the court ruIes that
there is probabIe cause--

425
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,164
Excuse me, Your Honor.
- Mr. Best?

426
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:45,102
Yes, Your Honor.
Um, I've been advised by my coIIeague, Frau Becker,

427
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:50,574
that there is here in BerIin a perfectIy
vaIid constitution very simiIar to our own,

428
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,443
simiIar in its protection
of individuaI rights.

429
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:58,815
But it doesn't provide for the specific eIements
of due process as we understand them,

430
00:36:59,117 --> 00:37:02,653
in particuIar, the right
to a triaI byjury.

431
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:06,757
My cIientwouId Iike to know at this time
if he wiII have a triaI before his peers--

432
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,659
citizens of BerIin--

433
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,662
as guaranteed by
theAmericanConstitution.

434
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:19,369
Uh, Mr. Best, I can onIy assure you,
as a federaI judge--

435
00:37:19,671 --> 00:37:22,339
Excuse me.
Your Honor, excuse me.

436
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,276
Mr. Chairman? I beIieve Mr.
PaImerwouId Iike to respond to that now.

437
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:28,278
Mr. PaImer?

438
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,014
- May I approach the bench, Your Honor?
- You may. Mr. Best?

439
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:40,357
I'm sure Your Honor wiII appreciate the reIuctance...

440
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:43,627
with which we approach this compIex question at this time,

441
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:47,564
but I do not beIieve thatwe are actuaIIy bound by Iaw...

442
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:50,234
to extend those rights.

443
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:54,938
Mr. United States
Attorney,

444
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,774
it is the farthest thing from my mind to embarrass you or your cIient,

445
00:37:58,076 --> 00:38:01,912
but notjust the defense,
but aII of us-- the counseI, the court, the peopIe--

446
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:04,815
are entitIed to know the Iimits
ofthis court's authority.

447
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,417
Your Honor--
Excuse me. Mr. PaImer.

448
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:11,355
Is it the government's position that the Constitution ofthe United States...

449
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:14,324
appIies here fuIIy
or something Iess?

450
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:18,161
We're not prepared to give a definitive position on that issue, sir.

451
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:21,398
We wouId argue in an American court-- I'm sorry.
GentIemen.

452
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:24,101
We're not having an argument on this today.
Be seated, pIease.

453
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,978
We wiII next proceed
to arraign the defendants...

454
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,215
and reconvene here next Monday morning to set a firm date for triaI.

455
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:40,183
Adjourned.

456
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:50,394
Open-and-shut case.
Piece of cake.

457
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:54,431
ShouIdn't take any time at aII.
Right, Bruno?

458
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,763
I'II provide the entertainment from here on.

459
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,765
Hey, that's
MarIene Dietrich.

460
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:05,669
Greatest Iegs-- Ah, second greatest Iegs in the worId.

461
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:10,140
I don't hear anything.

462
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:14,644
Oh, from continent to continent,
some things never change.

463
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:17,647
HeIIo.
Yeah, Bruno. What's up?

464
00:40:19,951 --> 00:40:23,553
What the heII you mean,
no jury triaI?

465
00:40:23,855 --> 00:40:26,523
"The United States authority
in BerIin is derived...

466
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:29,393
from rights of conquest,
not the consent ofthe government."

467
00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:32,863
So, in otherwords,
the citizens ofWest BerIin have no rights at aII.

468
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:36,299
"The United States court for BerIin is
an instrument ofthe occupation poIicy...

469
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,301
"ofthe United States.

470
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,304
"The decision whether
to grant a jury triaI...

471
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:44,174
is a poIiticaI
and not a judiciaI question."

472
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:46,610
Don't Iook at me, judge.
I didn'twrite it.

473
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:48,979
So who did write it,
AdoIf HitIer?

474
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,282
"The decision whether
to grant a jury triaI...

475
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:56,787
is a poIiticaI
and not a judiciaI question."

476
00:40:58,089 --> 00:41:00,490
This, as I understand it,
Your Honor,

477
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:03,293
is theposition
ofthese prosecutors...

478
00:41:04,095 --> 00:41:05,662
for the United States
ofAmerica.

479
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:10,133
I have been abIe to find
onIy one IegaI precedent...

480
00:41:10,435 --> 00:41:12,636
for theirposition,
Your Honor.

481
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:16,640
It is the case caIIed
Cat versus Mouse,

482
00:41:17,442 --> 00:41:20,644
from a foreign
jurisdiction,

483
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:24,648
from the casebook caIIed AIice'sAdventures in WonderIand.

484
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:29,553
"A cat named Fury said to a mouse that he met in the house,

485
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:33,056
"'Let us both go to Iaw.
I wiII prosecute you.

486
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:35,292
"'Come,
I'II take no deniaI.

487
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:38,462
"We must have the triaI, for reaIIy,
this morning I have nothing to do.'

488
00:41:38,763 --> 00:41:41,932
"Said the mouse to the cur,
'Such a triaI, dear sir,

489
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:44,968
"'with no jury orjudge...

490
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,471
"wouId be
wasting our breath.'

491
00:41:47,772 --> 00:41:52,476
"'I'II be the judge, I'II be the jury,'
said the cunning oId Fury.

492
00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:55,979
I'II try the whoIe cause
and condemn you to death."'

493
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:00,784
For shame...

494
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:03,787
that I shouId even have to
rise to respond...

495
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:07,290
to such aposition
on behaIf of our country,

496
00:42:07,592 --> 00:42:12,295
a position written by peopIe somewhere in some foggy bottom...

497
00:42:12,597 --> 00:42:14,664
with some pretty foggy heads.

498
00:42:16,434 --> 00:42:19,135
I ask the court to ruIe,
notjust for our cIients,

499
00:42:19,437 --> 00:42:21,137
but for the honor
of our country,

500
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:25,509
that these fugitives from another sociaI system be at Ieast entitIed...

501
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:29,412
to due process ofthe Iaw
in thisAmerican court.

502
00:42:32,617 --> 00:42:36,186
We do not understand the confusion on
the part of the defense over this matter.

503
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:39,523
WeII, this court is a IittIe confused too,
Mr. PaImer.

504
00:42:39,824 --> 00:42:42,692
This court sits--

505
00:42:42,994 --> 00:42:47,197
This court sits in conquered territory.
It is an occupationaI court.

506
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:51,902
Therefore, it stands to reason that it is
an instrument ofAmerican foreign poIicy.

507
00:42:52,203 --> 00:42:56,072
It cannot, by definition,
independentIy decide anything.

508
00:42:56,374 --> 00:43:00,010
So, in otherwords,
this court must foIIow...

509
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:02,012
the directives
ofthe U.S. secretary of state?

510
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:05,782
In otherwords, myjob here is to simpIy obey?
I have nothing to decide?

511
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,118
Not on the question
ofthe jury triaI, no.

512
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:16,426
Sir, are you teIIing me...

513
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:19,796
that the Constitution ofthe United States does not appIy in this court?

514
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,132
It is ourposition...

515
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:26,136
thatwe're not restricted by the United
States Constitution in these proceedings.

516
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:30,140
That is correct.

517
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:34,044
Did you ever hear anyone say that to anyjudge
in an American courtroom anywhere?

518
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:36,046
I have not.

519
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:40,050
Two U.S. government prosecutors, one a bIack,
the other a jew, they sound Iike Nazis.

520
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,489
What the heII's
going on here?

521
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:06,109
Did you know this
wouId be an issue?

522
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:08,612
I didn't
anticipate that, no.

523
00:44:08,913 --> 00:44:11,114
Do they reaIIy expect me
to do the same thing...

524
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:14,150
that Nuremberg prosecuted aII those
German judges for doing here 45 years ago?

525
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:18,755
You heard 'em, Bruno. They want me to be a good boy,
foIIow the fuhrer's orders...

526
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:23,259
and ruIe the defendants in my court are no
more than a mere extension offoreign poIicy.

527
00:44:23,561 --> 00:44:26,763
They want me to become
a goddamn Nazi judge!

528
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:31,334
They can go to heII first.
Knowwhat I'm gonna do?

529
00:44:31,636 --> 00:44:35,305
I'm gonna do what those German judges shouId have done in 1934.

530
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:39,042
I'm gonna resign.
They can get somebody eIse to do their dirty work.

531
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:42,379
Herb, Iisten,
if a jury of BerIiners...

532
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,416
is brought in to judge a case in which the United States is a Iitigant,

533
00:44:47,218 --> 00:44:49,419
then the conquered
are judging the conquerors,

534
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,422
and our status as an occupying power is at an end,

535
00:44:52,723 --> 00:44:54,290
and BerIin
is a free city.

536
00:44:54,592 --> 00:44:59,763
Then the yogurt hits the fan,
because the Russians wiII be here the next day.

537
00:45:00,498 --> 00:45:03,199
Now, aII I am saying is that this is not good guys and bad guys.

538
00:45:03,501 --> 00:45:05,201
This is the state,

539
00:45:05,503 --> 00:45:09,205
and PaImer and Sherman and in the
unenviabIe position of representing the state...

540
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:12,942
in what seems to be
an inhumane poIicy.

541
00:45:13,244 --> 00:45:15,311
You work for the state.
How do you stand?

542
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:20,717
In this instance,

543
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:24,087
I support the decision
ofthe court.

544
00:45:26,257 --> 00:45:28,458
And that decision
is mine aIone.

545
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:07,664
Some honeymoon.
"Weather in BerIin is beautifuI this time ofyear."

546
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:12,435
I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to understand what drives these peopIe.

547
00:46:12,737 --> 00:46:14,704
What the heII is it?

548
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:16,706
Look at this!

549
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:21,211
My God.
That actuaIIy happened.

550
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:27,183
Seventy peopIe have been kiIIed
and more than 3,000 arrested...

551
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:30,687
trying to cross
that godforsaken waII.

552
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:34,691
Now I have to sit in judgment
on two that made it.

553
00:46:34,992 --> 00:46:36,693
How the heII can I do that,

554
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:39,195
especiaIIy with the State Department breathing down my neck,

555
00:46:39,497 --> 00:46:41,698
teIIing me they have no right
to a jury triaI?

556
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:44,234
Herbert, you have
made your point.

557
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:46,236
This case isn'tjust
a chaIIenge anymore.

558
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:49,739
It has gone so far beyond that,
and I'm getting scared now.

559
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,609
Why don't you Iet somebody eIse finish it and resign?

560
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:55,078
Don't think I'm not seriousIy considering resigning,

561
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,080
but I have to wonder--

562
00:46:57,882 --> 00:47:00,517
WhatwouId have happened if EarI Warren
stopped defending the Constitution...

563
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:03,019
before schooIs in the South
were integrated?

564
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,523
What ifjudges Iike Frank johnson
ofAIabama and Bob Merhige ofVirginia...

565
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,525
hadn't fought
for equaI rights?

566
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:11,027
They firebombed Merhige's house,
and he stiII heId firm.

567
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:14,030
Who am I to waIk away when the Constitution's in jeopardy?

568
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:17,567
Come off it, Don Quixote.
Those guys were fighting for civiI rights.

569
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:20,570
You're risking our entire future here for a coupIe of Germans.

570
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:25,575
So that's it?
You want me to take out the HoIocaust on them.

571
00:47:26,377 --> 00:47:28,578
BuIIshit. That is not the point at aII.
Yes, ma'am.

572
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:32,081
That is not the point at aII!
That is the point, Marsha!

573
00:47:32,383 --> 00:47:35,518
You want me to bury these peopIe to
make up for aII our graveIess reIatives.

574
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:37,520
Let me teII you something.

575
00:47:37,822 --> 00:47:41,024
My soIe responsibiIity here is to uphoId my oath to the Constitution...

576
00:47:41,826 --> 00:47:44,260
and not to any government poIicies or personaI causes!

577
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:05,715
Mr. PaImer, wiII you pIease
approach the bench?

578
00:48:14,024 --> 00:48:17,193
Sir, this court
rejects out of hand...

579
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:20,196
any notion that these defendants
have no rights here,

580
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:25,201
and unIess and untiI a different United
States judge for BerIin presides here,

581
00:48:25,502 --> 00:48:28,872
the Constitution wiII remain in fuII force and effect.
Your Honor--

582
00:48:29,173 --> 00:48:30,640
I'm caIIing your bIuff,
Mr. PaImer.

583
00:48:31,442 --> 00:48:35,144
Ifthe occupationaI authorities do not bring
a jury of BerIiners into this courtroom,

584
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:39,649
I'm going to be forced
to set these peopIe free.

585
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:44,087
You know, I--

586
00:48:44,388 --> 00:48:48,091
I aIways thought itwouId
be different here in the West.

587
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:50,326
Hans was aIways
so optimistic.

588
00:48:50,628 --> 00:48:53,129
It is different here.

589
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,632
Not perfect,

590
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:58,034
but at Ieastwe can try
to make our system work.

591
00:48:58,335 --> 00:49:00,303
Countries don't care
who they hurt.

592
00:49:02,206 --> 00:49:04,707
What is the difference between one system and the other...

593
00:49:05,009 --> 00:49:07,210
when you have nothing?

594
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:14,250
I'm sorry.

595
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:19,255
I know you--

596
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:23,259
you're reaIIy a very good man and you're
trying to do everything for Marina and me--

597
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:28,765
PIease, Sigrid, Iet me do it.
Let me show how you were tricked into making your confession.

598
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:31,267
No.

599
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:34,771
Don't you see that
these Russians are here?

600
00:49:35,072 --> 00:49:38,541
They're in court. They see everything.
They Iisten, they watch.

601
00:49:38,842 --> 00:49:41,377
There's no hope for Hans
ifthey know how he heIped us.

602
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:44,981
- It's bound to come out sooner or Iater.
- Okay, but not through me.

603
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:47,483
It's our onIy defense,
Sigrid.

604
00:49:47,785 --> 00:49:50,353
Then I have no defense.

605
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:57,360
I wouId rather go to jaiI forfour orfive years than to hurt him.

606
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,729
Butwe...
PIease, you respect that!

607
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,998
Don't know that it's
four orfive years.

608
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:05,168
We couId be Iooking at a sentence of 15 years.
Doesn't matter.

609
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:07,170
Oh, for God's sake!

610
00:50:07,972 --> 00:50:10,540
Save me from stupid
seIf-sacrifice!

611
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,809
TeII me something, Sigrid.

612
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:17,313
WiII your sense of honor and virtue feed your daughter,
put a roof over her head?

613
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:20,817
WiII it keep her company
for 15 years?

614
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:22,819
WiII Hans want you
to do that?

615
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:27,323
I don't know.

616
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,326
I just don't know!

617
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:50,580
You wanted to see me?

618
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:53,616
Yes. Thank you.

619
00:50:55,919 --> 00:50:58,488
Your newspapers here--
how accurate are they?

620
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:02,392
SurprisingIy accurate,
I'd say,

621
00:51:02,693 --> 00:51:04,761
especiaIIy regarding
this particuIar triaI.

622
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:09,399
So I can beIieve that Sigrid has not so far brought up my name?

623
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,869
Her siIence may be
an attempt to protect me.

624
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:16,105
That's an act of Iove I can't accept.
She must teII them.

625
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:18,908
And you think that'II set you free?
No.

626
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:23,279
I'm worried for her.
I'm worried for the chiId.

627
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,615
- But you wouIdn't understand that.
- ReaIIy?

628
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,884
You are too pragmatic,
you peopIe.

629
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:31,320
"From each,
according to his abiIity.

630
00:51:31,622 --> 00:51:33,189
To each,
according to his need."

631
00:51:33,991 --> 00:51:36,692
Sounds so simpIe,
beautifuI.

632
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:40,696
Butwhere inDas KapitaI
does it speak of Iove?

633
00:51:40,998 --> 00:51:44,801
I'm not sure what KarI Marx had in mind,
but I know this isn'twhat God intended.

634
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:49,138
- God taIks to you?
- No. I just feeI with him.

635
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,909
Perhaps we have more
in common than you know.

636
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:54,811
Then heIp me.

637
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:02,452
I have written
a Ietter to her.

638
00:52:02,753 --> 00:52:05,021
You can read it
ifyou wish.

639
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:08,558
It asks her to teII the truth,
to save herseIf.

640
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:13,129
Nothing more. I cannot do that,
Herr Schuster.

641
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:16,499
I'II teII you who suppIied me
with the passports, papers,

642
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,468
the forgeries--
everything!

643
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:22,071
Herr Schuster,
how do you thinkwe found you?

644
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:27,677
Now, Mr. HeIIring.

645
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:31,981
I understand that you wish to have the
statement of November 28 suppressed.

646
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:34,517
Is this true?
Yes, it is, Your Honor.

647
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,886
Very weII. I wiII hear
your arguments, sir,

648
00:52:37,187 --> 00:52:39,889
but I hope it is possibIe for you to
accommodate the sensibiIities ofthis court,

649
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:42,258
or perhaps, more accurateIy,
this judge.

650
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,560
Your Honor,
you'II forgive me...

651
00:52:44,862 --> 00:52:47,563
if I don't, uh, quite
comprehend your meaning.

652
00:52:47,865 --> 00:52:49,465
Then I shaII be even
and direct, sir.

653
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:53,202
I hope there wiII be no more Iong and flowery speeches,
Mr. HeIIring.

654
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:57,473
Just simpIe, decIarative
sentences, okay?

655
00:53:00,477 --> 00:53:02,678
Your Honor,
I wiII attempt,

656
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:04,680
with the greatest
difficuIty,

657
00:53:04,982 --> 00:53:07,583
to controI my use ofthe Ianguage that I Iove,

658
00:53:07,885 --> 00:53:10,920
a Ianguage that embeIIishes
the Iawwith grace notes.

659
00:53:11,722 --> 00:53:13,289
Let us get on with it,
pIease.

660
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:16,425
I'II try, Your Honor.
Thank you, Mr. HeIIring.

661
00:53:16,727 --> 00:53:18,594
Why do you wish to have
the statement suppressed?

662
00:53:18,896 --> 00:53:22,865
Your Honor, I have in this hand
a statement, a confession.

663
00:53:23,167 --> 00:53:25,201
And in the other hand--

664
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:28,471
And in the other hand,
I have a transcript...

665
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:31,073
ofthat same confession,

666
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:36,145
but incIuding the Ieading and coercive
questions concocted by the interrogators.

667
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:39,015
PIease remember your promise to the court,
Mr. HeIIring.

668
00:53:39,316 --> 00:53:42,952
Now, are you teIIing me that that statement was not freeIy given,

669
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:45,755
that Mrs. Radke did not
come in voIuntariIy...

670
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,957
to cIear the air, as Mr.
Sherman assured the court?

671
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:52,428
Take note, Your Honor,
of how simpIe and decIarative I can be.

672
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:54,664
Yes.

673
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:57,767
- Objection, Your Honor.
- OverruIed, Mr. Sherman.

674
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,703
- How dare Mr. HeIIring--
- Mr. Sherman, you are overruIed.

675
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:04,574
PIease sit down.

676
00:54:09,112 --> 00:54:12,181
- Who presided over this interrogation?
- CoIoneI Patrick j. HeIIer.

677
00:54:12,482 --> 00:54:15,952
Mr.
HeIIring, that transcript must be produced and marked into evidence.

678
00:54:17,487 --> 00:54:20,289
But, Your Honor,
I'm afraid I cannot.

679
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:23,926
- Mr. HeIIring?
- My cIient-- I think itwouId be appropriate.

680
00:54:24,228 --> 00:54:26,929
Mr. HeIIring, I order you
to show me that transcriptnow.

681
00:54:27,231 --> 00:54:30,099
No, but--

682
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,436
Excuse me for a moment,
Your Honor.

683
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:37,306
Sigrid, I'm sorry, but
there's nothing I can do.

684
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:39,709
The judge has ordered me.

685
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,828
Madam, I'm compeIIed
to inform you,

686
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:00,763
regretfuIIy, of course,

687
00:55:01,565 --> 00:55:04,267
that even ifyou continue to sacrifice yourseIf,
there can be no guarantee...

688
00:55:04,568 --> 00:55:06,769
that the information contained
in this transcript...

689
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:09,772
wiII not be reveaIed during Mr.
ThieIe's part ofthe triaI.

690
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:13,709
Do you cIearIy understand this?
Yes.

691
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:18,447
Very weII. Mr.
HeIIring, you may reexamine the witness.

692
00:55:21,551 --> 00:55:26,255
When Mrs. Radke was in custody,
did she correspond with the outside worId?

693
00:55:26,556 --> 00:55:28,257
Yes, I beIieve
she wrote some Ietters.

694
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:32,261
You beIieve? You had copies made of every one ofthem.
Isn't that true?

695
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:34,230
Objection, Your Honor.

696
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:38,434
Ifyour objection is vaIid, Mr.
PaImer, you have nothing to fearfrom this question.

697
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:40,269
PIease answer it, CoIoneI.
Yes, I did.

698
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:42,938
You had copies made of her Ietters.
With her approvaI?

699
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,941
She knew I was gonna be reading her maiI.
She didn't know I'd be making copies.

700
00:55:46,243 --> 00:55:50,513
On whose orders? I was instructed by Mr.
PaImer to review aII her maiI.

701
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:53,416
Why?
We were afraid she wouId reveaI her Iocation.

702
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:56,919
You mean she was not permitted to teII
anybody where she was being kept?

703
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:59,422
We kept her Iocation a secret
for her own security, sir.

704
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:02,091
You feIt she was in danger
here in TempeIhof?

705
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:03,893
A U.S. miIitary base?
Yes, sir.

706
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:06,929
- Dangerfrom whom?
- From the East Germans, sir.

707
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:10,333
PIease continue,
Mr. HeIIring.

708
00:56:11,134 --> 00:56:12,835
I have here a page
from the transcript...

709
00:56:13,637 --> 00:56:17,340
ofyour November 28
interrogation of Mrs. Radke.

710
00:56:17,641 --> 00:56:20,209
What page is that, Mr.
HeIIring? Page 13, Your Honor.

711
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:21,977
Thank you.
This is you speaking.

712
00:56:22,279 --> 00:56:25,681
"We understand what you went through when the papers did not come.

713
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:29,585
"You thought that Hans had been arrested and the hijacking--

714
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:33,589
the hijacking is not
such a bad thing."

715
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:38,594
When you said this,
were you trying to persuade her...

716
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:40,596
or induce her to confess?

717
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:44,100
My motive was to instruct her as to what information we had about Mr.
Schuster.

718
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:46,369
Excuse me, CoIoneI.
Mrs. Bauer,

719
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:49,772
I want that Iast question
repeated, pIease.

720
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,875
I want you to Iisten very carefuIIy to
that question before you answer again.

721
00:56:53,176 --> 00:56:55,177
"When you made this statement,

722
00:56:55,479 --> 00:56:58,280
were you trying to persuade her
or induce her to confess?"

723
00:56:58,582 --> 00:57:00,750
CoIoneI, do you now,
under oath,

724
00:57:01,051 --> 00:57:04,587
read those words
as an inducement?

725
00:57:04,888 --> 00:57:08,758
- I can't hear you. WouId you mind speaking up?
- I said yes. Yes, I do.

726
00:57:10,394 --> 00:57:12,061
I shouIdn't have used
those words.

727
00:57:12,863 --> 00:57:15,431
Itwas a poor choice ofwords
on my part.

728
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:18,367
And do you nowfind this sort
of inducement consistent...

729
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:21,237
with the duties of an officer of
the U.S. Department of Defense?

730
00:57:21,538 --> 00:57:23,873
No.

731
00:57:24,174 --> 00:57:27,910
- No more questions, Your Honor.
- Thank you, CoIoneI. You may step down.

732
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:34,650
I find it to be a fact that the United States heId a defendant,

733
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:38,988
Mrs. Radke, because they suspected that she
was in Ieague with the defendant, Mr. ThieIe.

734
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:42,725
And I find that without enough evidence to formaIIy charge her,

735
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:46,629
they nonetheIess continued to hoId her and her chiId in iIIegaI custody.

736
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:50,099
This court aIso finds
that the defendant, Mrs. Radke,

737
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:55,070
was unIawfuIIy and unconstitutionaIIy
induced by CoIoneI Patrick HeIIer...

738
00:57:55,372 --> 00:57:58,941
to give statements that she expIicitIy did notwish to give.

739
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:01,877
AccordingIy, the court ruIes
that the statement given...

740
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:04,113
on November 28, 1973,

741
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:06,849
may not be used in evidence
against the defendant.

742
00:58:09,453 --> 00:58:11,153
And that
it must be suppressed.

743
00:58:11,455 --> 00:58:14,156
Ifthe prosecution can make a case against Mrs.
Radke without her statement,

744
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:16,392
Iet it do so.

745
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:19,495
If not, the case against her
wiII be dismissed...

746
00:58:19,796 --> 00:58:21,997
and aII restraints upon herfreedom wiII be discharged.

747
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:27,636
Your Honor? Yes, Mr. PaImer?
What is your pIeasure?

748
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:34,009
WhiIe the United States occupation
authorities beIieve that the court's order...

749
00:58:34,311 --> 00:58:36,946
regarding the defendant's constitutionaI right to a triaI byjury...

750
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:39,748
are not correct
as a matter of Iaw,

751
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:42,585
they nevertheIess want to move these proceedings to a resoIution...

752
00:58:43,386 --> 00:58:46,088
and they wiII, therefore,
endeavor to give effect to the court's order.

753
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:49,358
Responding with one simpIe word,
Mr. PaImer,

754
00:58:49,659 --> 00:58:52,094
do these defendants get
a triaI byjury?

755
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,137
Yes.

756
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:18,754
FeeIing pretty seIf-satisfied,
aren't you?

757
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:20,623
Yup.

758
00:59:22,259 --> 00:59:24,960
A IittIe smug,
maybe?

759
00:59:25,262 --> 00:59:26,962
Yup.

760
00:59:27,264 --> 00:59:29,999
You knew you'd win
aII aIong, didn't you?

761
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,001
Nope.

762
00:59:32,302 --> 00:59:35,504
Can you say anything
but "yup" or "nope"?

763
00:59:35,805 --> 00:59:38,007
Nope. Yup.

764
00:59:38,308 --> 00:59:41,010
Terrific. I'm married
to Gary Cooper.

765
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:43,746
Nope. SpencerTracy.

766
00:59:47,384 --> 00:59:50,819
We are reconvened to hear a pretriaI motion to dismiss the case...

767
00:59:51,121 --> 00:59:52,488
against Mrs. Radke.

768
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:56,358
Your Honor, at this time
the United States wishes...

769
00:59:56,660 --> 01:00:00,029
to dismiss its case
against Sigrid Radke.

770
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:04,066
Mr. PaImer, I think she needs
much more than that, sir.

771
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:06,902
Are you prepared to use
your occupationaI authority...

772
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:10,406
to forbid the German courts from
pressing any further charges against her?

773
01:00:10,707 --> 01:00:13,909
Yes.
Then the motion is granted.

774
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:16,312
- Mr. HeIIring.
- Sir.

775
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:19,248
- The case against your cIient is dismissed.
- Thank you, sir.

776
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:31,060
An update on the TempeIhof
hijack triaI.

777
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:35,064
FoIIowing the acquittaI of Sigrid Radke,
her attorney, Bernard HeIIring,

778
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:37,967
has announced he'II stay on
as ThieIe's defense.

779
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:42,338
We Russians have no heritage
of common Iaw...

780
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,340
with its habeas corpus:

781
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:47,343
no historicaI traditions
of pubIic poIiticaI debates.

782
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:49,845
Power is power,
quite simpIy,

783
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:53,349
and a triaI is nothing
more than anarchy.

784
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:56,852
This judge,
this man Stern,

785
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:58,854
why is he so ungovernabIe?

786
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:02,791
This judge has a distorted sense ofwhat
serves the best interests ofthe United States.

787
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:06,795
Notjust the United States.
My government is worried, Mr. WiIde.

788
01:01:07,097 --> 01:01:09,064
Worried enough
to have put me on a pIane.

789
01:01:09,366 --> 01:01:12,167
And before I embark
once again, I expect us...

790
01:01:12,469 --> 01:01:15,671
to have found a soIution thatwiII dissuade others from hijacking pIanes...

791
01:01:15,972 --> 01:01:17,673
or other such acts
ofterrorism.

792
01:01:18,475 --> 01:01:20,175
ThieIe must be sentenced
to a term in jaiI.

793
01:01:20,477 --> 01:01:23,178
The record must show his
crime was indeed a crime--

794
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,180
Even if I were to agree
with you, Mr. Andreyev,

795
01:01:25,482 --> 01:01:28,183
there is nothing I can do
to force the decision of a jury.

796
01:01:38,995 --> 01:01:41,697
What in the name of God
is happening here?

797
01:01:41,998 --> 01:01:44,733
You said you wanted
500 prospective jurors, judge.

798
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:46,735
I guess this is them.

799
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:49,238
These are Russian soIdiers,
aren't they? Sure are.

800
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:52,741
What are they doing here?
Waiting for us to strangIe in our own contradictions.

801
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:55,744
Steve, what the heII are these Russian soIdiers doing here?

802
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:57,746
They're here to intimidate the jurors.

803
01:01:58,548 --> 01:01:59,748
Can't you do anything about that?
No, sir.

804
01:02:00,483 --> 01:02:04,553
Why not?
'Cause ifwe continue to cross into East BerIin,

805
01:02:04,854 --> 01:02:06,855
then I can't stop
them from coming.

806
01:02:07,157 --> 01:02:09,358
You want more cops?
No, for God's sake. No more bodies.

807
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:12,227
Just get everybody inside.
AII right. Everyone in. Let's go.

808
01:02:12,529 --> 01:02:14,830
Is this working?
Yeah.

809
01:02:15,131 --> 01:02:17,833
Ladies and gentIemen,
weIcome to the United States court for BerIin.

810
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:27,342
Under our system ofjustice,
a jury, and a jury aIone,

811
01:02:27,644 --> 01:02:30,312
has the power to decide
what has been proven...

812
01:02:30,613 --> 01:02:33,716
and what has not been proven
in a court of Iaw.

813
01:02:34,017 --> 01:02:36,185
OnIy those peopIe
who are chosen jurists,

814
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:38,554
the 12 men and women randomIy
seIected from the community,

815
01:02:38,855 --> 01:02:41,957
wiII have the right to decide
the facts ofthis case...

816
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:45,461
and, based upon those facts,
determine the guiIt or innocence ofthe accused.

817
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:47,696
Ladies and gentIemen
ofthe jury,

818
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:51,200
we are here
so that you can determine...

819
01:02:51,501 --> 01:02:54,703
the guiIt or innocence
of a man.

820
01:02:55,004 --> 01:02:58,707
Now, is this a man
with criminaI intent?

821
01:02:59,008 --> 01:03:02,144
Is this a man who couId steaI,

822
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:05,147
who wouId kiII?

823
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:10,252
Now, what kind of a man
is HeImutAIexanderThieIe?

824
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:14,590
You reaIize the PoIish crew--
the piIot and the stewardess--

825
01:03:14,891 --> 01:03:16,458
they'II aII testify.

826
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:19,728
Yes. It's good.
They wiII teII the truth.

827
01:03:20,029 --> 01:03:23,565
I didn't come to West BerIin to give the kind offaIse confession...

828
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:25,634
they take in the East.

829
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:28,837
I want the triaI the judge
said I couId have.

830
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:31,340
I want to be judged
by my own peopIe.

831
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:33,208
He was standing over her.

832
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:37,679
The stewardess, you mean?
Yes. Beata Levandovska.

833
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:40,682
He was hoIding her
by the hairwith one hand,

834
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:45,087
and in his other hand he was hoIding a pistoI at her head.

835
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:47,990
And what did he do then?
He demanded thatwe Iand in West BerIin.

836
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:50,359
If his demands
are not fuIfiIIed,

837
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,261
he wiII shoot
Beata Levandovska.

838
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:57,633
Captain, can you in this courtroom see the
man who heId the pistoI to Beata's head?

839
01:03:57,934 --> 01:03:59,935
He is there.

840
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:02,538
Let the record show,
Your Honor,

841
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:06,542
that the witness has identified HeImut ThieIe.
Very weII.

842
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:09,745
Go on, Captain.
What did you do then?

843
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:12,047
First I began to anaIyze
the situation,

844
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:16,518
then I decided
to fuIfiII the request.

845
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:19,154
The demand to Iand
at TempeIhof.

846
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:24,092
And, Captain, why didn't you Iand at SchoenefeId anyway,
as you were scheduIed to do?

847
01:04:24,394 --> 01:04:27,596
Nobody gave me
nor can give me...

848
01:04:27,897 --> 01:04:31,233
neither a moraI right
nor a written Iaw...

849
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:33,569
authorizing me to risk
the heaIth and Iife...

850
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,938
of passengers
entrusted to me.

851
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:38,607
Of course, Captain.

852
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:40,976
At the moment
I feIt a sharp jerk.

853
01:04:41,277 --> 01:04:43,478
Somebody puIIed me
by the hair.

854
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:47,382
I feIt something-- some hard object being
pressed firmIy to the back of my head.

855
01:04:47,684 --> 01:04:49,585
- So I couIdn't move.
- And what did you hear?

856
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:52,888
I heard the man demand
thatwe fly to West BerIin.

857
01:04:53,189 --> 01:04:55,390
He said, aIso,
that I shouIdn't move.

858
01:04:56,192 --> 01:04:57,492
If I move,
he wiII kiII me.

859
01:04:57,794 --> 01:05:00,295
And unIess the crew does
as he says, he wiII kiII me too.

860
01:05:00,597 --> 01:05:03,732
Where was the gun? Pointed at the back of my head,
the whoIe time untiI we Ianded.

861
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:06,568
And this gun thatwas pointed
at the back ofyour head...

862
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:08,737
for those interminabIe
moments,

863
01:05:09,038 --> 01:05:11,940
do you knowwhat gun itwas,

864
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:14,276
what sort of gun itwas?

865
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:16,778
I don't know.
I couIdn't see the gun.

866
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:19,147
He was hoIding it
to the back of my head.

867
01:05:19,449 --> 01:05:22,885
TeII me, how did that
make you feeI?

868
01:05:25,188 --> 01:05:27,155
I was--
I was terrified.

869
01:05:27,457 --> 01:05:30,859
Miss Levandovska,
you said that Mr. ThieIe...

870
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:35,731
heId you by the hair whiIe he kept a gun pressed against your head.

871
01:05:36,032 --> 01:05:38,267
Now, was this
the whoIe time?

872
01:05:38,568 --> 01:05:41,136
Yes, itwas the whoIe time.
UntiI you Ianded at TempeIhof, right?

873
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:45,607
Yes. That's right.
And where was Mr. ThieIe standing?

874
01:05:45,909 --> 01:05:49,845
Uh, he was standing behind me.
Behind you?

875
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:52,648
Behind me. Uh, Mr.
Best, wouId you mind, pIease?

876
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:55,150
Thank you very much. Your Honor,
if itwouId not offend the court,

877
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:57,953
may I, uh-- Yes, of course,
Mr. HeIIring.

878
01:05:58,254 --> 01:05:59,755
Thank you, sir.

879
01:05:59,989 --> 01:06:04,192
Like this? Uh, is this
the way he heId you?

880
01:06:04,494 --> 01:06:08,196
Yes, itwas Iike that. Yes. And during this time,
were you smoking a cigarette?

881
01:06:08,498 --> 01:06:11,199
Yes, I did.
Yes. Whose cigarette?

882
01:06:11,501 --> 01:06:14,102
Mr. ThieIe's cigarette.
He didn't aIIow us to smoke our own.

883
01:06:14,404 --> 01:06:16,939
Yes. And was anybody
eIse smoking?

884
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,808
Yes, the steward,
Mr. GavIik and Mr. ThieIe.

885
01:06:20,109 --> 01:06:21,543
He smoked too.
He did?

886
01:06:22,345 --> 01:06:24,046
Yes, he did.

887
01:06:24,347 --> 01:06:27,549
And, uh, these cigarettes--
Where did he keep them?

888
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:32,821
Uh, in the pocket.
In his coat pocket.

889
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:38,760
Uh, did,
uh-- did somebody eIse take them out for him?

890
01:06:39,062 --> 01:06:42,264
Yes, itwas the steward,
Mr. GavIik.

891
01:06:42,565 --> 01:06:44,566
He took the cigarettes
out ofthe pocket.

892
01:06:44,867 --> 01:06:47,602
And who Iit
Mr. ThieIe's cigarette?

893
01:06:47,904 --> 01:06:50,572
I did. Uh, Mr.
ThieIe was stiII behind you,

894
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:54,343
hoIding your hair in one hand and the gun in the other,
and you Iit his cigarette?

895
01:06:54,644 --> 01:06:56,611
That is right.

896
01:06:56,913 --> 01:07:00,415
Uh, is it true that
when Mr. ThieIe was asked...

897
01:07:00,717 --> 01:07:02,651
why he was hijacking
the pIane,

898
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:04,987
he said he was doing it
for his famiIy?

899
01:07:05,288 --> 01:07:06,922
- Is that true?
- Yes, that is true.

900
01:07:07,223 --> 01:07:11,226
Now, when he said this,
did he aIso show any pictures of his famiIy?

901
01:07:16,566 --> 01:07:19,835
WouId you, uh, Iike
the question repeated?

902
01:07:20,636 --> 01:07:24,840
No. He couIdn't show us
the picture...

903
01:07:25,141 --> 01:07:28,844
because, uh-- because he was
hoIding me the whoIe time.

904
01:07:29,145 --> 01:07:31,847
He asked Mr. GavIik to Iook
for the pictures in his waIIet.

905
01:07:32,148 --> 01:07:36,318
Uh, excuse me, Mr. HeIIring.
Madam, maybe I'm not hearing this correctIy.

906
01:07:36,619 --> 01:07:38,820
You say he was standing
behind you,

907
01:07:39,122 --> 01:07:41,690
hoIding your hair in one hand
and he had a gun in the other?

908
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:43,992
Is that correct?
Yeah, that's correct.

909
01:07:44,293 --> 01:07:48,363
Then can you expIain how he managed to pass the cigarettes around...

910
01:07:48,664 --> 01:07:50,899
and give this other man
his waIIet?

911
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,635
Did he have more
than two hands at the time?

912
01:07:56,439 --> 01:08:01,443
I do not know how he did it.
I had my back to him.

913
01:08:04,547 --> 01:08:07,749
So sorry I missed.
Oh, that's aII right. What's so urgent?

914
01:08:08,051 --> 01:08:10,752
Remember those three
gentIemen in court today?

915
01:08:11,554 --> 01:08:14,656
The one who seemed to make the PoIish crew so fuII of discomfort?

916
01:08:14,957 --> 01:08:16,491
Yes.
I've done some snooping.

917
01:08:16,793 --> 01:08:20,429
Mr. GavIik, you testified
that Mr. ThieIe...

918
01:08:20,730 --> 01:08:24,466
entered the, uh,
gaIIey ofthe airpIane brandishing a gun...

919
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:27,469
and yeIIing that he was gonna shoot Miss Beata Levandovska.

920
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:29,704
Is that right?
Yes, sir. That's correct.

921
01:08:30,006 --> 01:08:33,942
And where were you at the time?
Um, in the gaIIey.

922
01:08:34,243 --> 01:08:37,479
Uh-huh. And where was
Miss, uh, Levandovska?

923
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:40,482
Um, she was
in the gaIIey too.

924
01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:45,420
You seem a IittIe
nervous, Mr. GavIik.

925
01:08:45,721 --> 01:08:49,724
Is there somebody in the pubIic gaIIery that you know?

926
01:08:50,026 --> 01:08:51,293
No.
You sure?

927
01:08:51,594 --> 01:08:52,994
Yes.
Uh-huh.

928
01:08:55,264 --> 01:09:00,802
Uh, do you know a man by the name of RoIand AIeksandrovitch?

929
01:09:01,104 --> 01:09:03,305
I know him onIy by name.

930
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:08,276
Uh-huh.
And do you know him to be the prosecutor generaI from Warsaw?

931
01:09:08,578 --> 01:09:10,946
Yes.

932
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:12,814
WeII, is he in this court?

933
01:09:13,116 --> 01:09:14,749
I don't know.

934
01:09:15,051 --> 01:09:17,319
You don't know?
Right.

935
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:20,722
WiII Mr. RoIand AIeksandrovitch
pIease rise?

936
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:24,426
Objection, Your Honor.
Who may or may not be in the gaIIery has IittIe bearing.

937
01:09:24,727 --> 01:09:26,928
OverruIed.
Go on, Mr. HeIIring.

938
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:31,099
WiII Mr. AIeksandrovitch
stand, pIease?

939
01:09:32,902 --> 01:09:35,737
Now, is this the man
you know to be...

940
01:09:36,038 --> 01:09:38,240
RoIand AIeksandrovitch?

941
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:40,242
Yes.
Just a moment, sir.

942
01:09:41,043 --> 01:09:44,112
Have you ever discussed your testimony with him?
No.

943
01:09:44,413 --> 01:09:46,114
Never?
No.

944
01:09:46,415 --> 01:09:48,617
Anywhere?
No, sir.

945
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:52,354
You cIaim to know him
onIy by name.

946
01:09:52,655 --> 01:09:55,357
Do you deny coming
to the courtwith him today?

947
01:09:55,658 --> 01:09:58,627
Do you deny that he brought you from
PoIand and wiII take you back again?

948
01:09:58,928 --> 01:10:01,897
Objection. I have no more use for this witness,
Your Honor.

949
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:04,432
His credibiIity
speaks for itseIf.

950
01:10:04,734 --> 01:10:08,303
You gotta hand it to Bernie and judah.
They're kicking the government's ass.

951
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:10,672
You've booted some butt
yourseIf, Your Honor.

952
01:10:10,973 --> 01:10:13,008
They didn't Ieave me
any choice.

953
01:10:13,309 --> 01:10:16,011
Oh, they make it hard to resist.
Can you bIame me?

954
01:10:16,312 --> 01:10:18,513
What's the defense
gonna be?

955
01:10:18,814 --> 01:10:22,517
That ThieIe was justified
in the hijacking...

956
01:10:22,818 --> 01:10:26,254
because he was going to be iIIegaIIy arrested if he Ianded in the East?

957
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:29,558
That's a good question, Bruno,
but the reaI probIem for the defense...

958
01:10:29,859 --> 01:10:32,060
is whether or not to put
HeImut ThieIe on the stand.

959
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:36,064
How can they have a defense if he doesn't testify?
Keep your eye on thatwoman.

960
01:10:36,365 --> 01:10:38,500
I had known him
for many years,

961
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:42,003
and I aIso knew that he desperateIy wanted to go to West BerIin...

962
01:10:42,305 --> 01:10:44,005
to see his IittIe boys.

963
01:10:44,807 --> 01:10:46,508
His wife Maria,
she was PoIish.

964
01:10:46,809 --> 01:10:51,012
She had Ieft him two years before and had
taken the two boys with her to West BerIin.

965
01:10:51,314 --> 01:10:54,015
So HeImut feIt miserabIe
without them.

966
01:10:54,317 --> 01:10:58,019
And Mrs.
ThieIe never brought the boys back to see theirfather?

967
01:10:58,821 --> 01:11:00,455
No, never.

968
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:05,460
WiII you now teII
the court and the jury...

969
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:09,297
exactIy how HeImut ThieIe
became invoIved with the escape?

970
01:11:09,599 --> 01:11:12,334
My friend from Hamburg
had the pIan...

971
01:11:13,135 --> 01:11:15,837
that first I wouId go aIone.

972
01:11:16,138 --> 01:11:21,343
But I was terrified. I had my chiId with me,
and it's so dangerous.

973
01:11:21,644 --> 01:11:23,712
So with a friend
I wouId feeI safer.

974
01:11:24,013 --> 01:11:26,448
I asked HeImut,
and he said yes.

975
01:11:26,749 --> 01:11:29,784
So you both went
to Gdansk together,

976
01:11:30,086 --> 01:11:33,788
and that is where yourfriend with the forged papers faiIed to show up?

977
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:35,790
Yes.

978
01:11:36,092 --> 01:11:39,160
We knew something terribIe
must have happened.

979
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:41,930
He said he's been imprisoned,
he's arrested.

980
01:11:42,231 --> 01:11:44,899
They caught him.
Nowwe are finished.

981
01:11:45,201 --> 01:11:46,901
And the same thing
wiII happen to us too.

982
01:11:47,203 --> 01:11:49,237
And that's when
the pIan was hatched?

983
01:11:49,538 --> 01:11:52,040
I'm sorry. I don't know
what "hatch" means.

984
01:11:52,341 --> 01:11:55,277
And that's when you made
the hijacking pIan?

985
01:11:55,578 --> 01:11:57,479
Yes.
We are very frightened.

986
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:00,849
We don't knowwhat to do.
We waIk. We argue.

987
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:05,854
We are at the flea market when I recognize that my daughter has Ieft.

988
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:11,693
So I see her staring onto something in the stand behind us.

989
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:14,462
Marina! Then she says, "Mama,"
and I went back to her.

990
01:12:14,764 --> 01:12:17,966
I see a gun.
She points at it.

991
01:12:18,267 --> 01:12:20,735
I see a gun, a toy gun.

992
01:12:21,037 --> 01:12:24,572
SuddenIy HeImut had the pIan
thatwe shouId buy the gun,

993
01:12:24,874 --> 01:12:27,575
sneak it on the pIane
and use it then...

994
01:12:27,877 --> 01:12:30,578
to divert the pIane
to West BerIin.

995
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:34,582
I say, "It's crazy. We don't have any money,
so how can we buy the gun?

996
01:12:35,384 --> 01:12:38,086
"And ifwe have the money,
how can we get the gun on the pIane?

997
01:12:38,387 --> 01:12:42,590
And ifwe have it on the pIane,
how to hijack a pIane with a toy? That's crazy."

998
01:12:43,392 --> 01:12:45,093
But he says, "For money,

999
01:12:45,394 --> 01:12:50,098
we shaII seII aII the cIothes we
don't need at the flea market."

1000
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:54,135
So soon we have enough.

1001
01:12:54,437 --> 01:12:57,105
He buys a bearfor Marina,

1002
01:12:57,406 --> 01:13:01,042
and I see the gun cIose up
for the first time.

1003
01:13:01,344 --> 01:13:04,546
It's so smaII.
Itwas absoIuteIy crazy.

1004
01:13:04,847 --> 01:13:08,983
I teII him we can't do it,
- itwiII work.

1005
01:13:09,285 --> 01:13:12,153
WeII, how did you expect to get
the gun through the customs?

1006
01:13:12,455 --> 01:13:15,557
Oh, that's my fear.

1007
01:13:15,858 --> 01:13:20,929
Security guards brought us to the private rooms where we are searched.

1008
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:23,298
And that's when the gun
was found?

1009
01:13:23,599 --> 01:13:26,801
Yes. The woman found it.

1010
01:13:27,103 --> 01:13:30,305
My heartwas ready to burst, but
she gave it back to Marina...

1011
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:33,174
and teIIs her
to be carefuI with her toy.

1012
01:13:33,476 --> 01:13:38,713
Frau Radke, you've stated this
gun doesn't Iook reaI to you.

1013
01:13:39,014 --> 01:13:40,749
Is that correct?
Yes.

1014
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:45,253
Then why did it Iook reaI-- the same gun--
to Beata when ThieIe heId it to her head?

1015
01:13:45,554 --> 01:13:47,756
I don't know-- Why did this same gun Iook reaI to the piIot...

1016
01:13:48,057 --> 01:13:50,258
WeII, I just toId you-- as he tried to Iand
a pIane fuII of innocent passengers--

1017
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:53,261
The prosecution
is harassing the witness.

1018
01:13:53,562 --> 01:13:56,631
Your Honor,
it doesn't matterwhether this gun Iooked reaI or not--

1019
01:13:56,932 --> 01:13:59,434
GentIemen, pIease.

1020
01:13:59,735 --> 01:14:03,371
There's been an objection that I've not had a chance to ruIe on.

1021
01:14:03,672 --> 01:14:06,307
Mr. HeIIring.
It has aIready been weII estabIished,

1022
01:14:06,609 --> 01:14:11,312
Your Honor, that Mrs.
Radke did not set foot in the cockpit.

1023
01:14:11,614 --> 01:14:14,315
So how couId she know
what anyone was thinking?

1024
01:14:14,617 --> 01:14:16,317
Objection sustained.
Thank you.

1025
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:19,821
The witness wiII not answer the question.
The jury wiII disregard it.

1026
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:21,823
PIease continue,
Mr. Sherman.

1027
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:26,327
Mrs.
Radke, in whose cIothing was the gun hidden?

1028
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:28,830
In my daughter
Marina's coat.

1029
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:33,368
Why? Why, Mrs. Radke?
Why did you use your own chiId?

1030
01:14:33,669 --> 01:14:35,370
I didn't use my own chiId.

1031
01:14:35,671 --> 01:14:38,706
I had to go through the customs
to fooI the customs peopIe.

1032
01:14:39,008 --> 01:14:42,010
Beside ofthat, itwas just a IittIe toy.
It doesn't Iook reaI.

1033
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:44,712
What is wrong
with a chiId with a toy?

1034
01:14:45,014 --> 01:14:49,117
Whose idea was it to use
the seven-year-oId chiId?

1035
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:56,624
Itwas HeImut's idea.

1036
01:14:56,926 --> 01:15:00,762
One Iast question.
The defense has estabIished and the court has ruIed...

1037
01:15:01,063 --> 01:15:02,764
that you had nothing
to do with this hijacking,

1038
01:15:03,065 --> 01:15:06,167
that, in fact, you never
even set foot in the cockpit.

1039
01:15:06,469 --> 01:15:09,170
Yet you did
hand ThieIe the gun,

1040
01:15:09,472 --> 01:15:11,673
and you did know
what he was going to do.

1041
01:15:11,974 --> 01:15:14,042
The desperate act
of a desperate man.

1042
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:16,277
And you knew
there was danger--

1043
01:15:16,579 --> 01:15:18,680
for the passengers for the crew,
for your own daughter.

1044
01:15:18,981 --> 01:15:21,349
Why did you do nothing
to stop him?

1045
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:23,518
Because itwas not possibIe.

1046
01:15:25,955 --> 01:15:28,056
Thank you.

1047
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:30,458
HeImut, at--
at the courtroom,

1048
01:15:30,759 --> 01:15:32,861
you reaIIy have to beIieve me,
I didn'twant to--

1049
01:15:33,162 --> 01:15:36,731
PIease, you have to say the truth.
This is okay. This is good.

1050
01:15:37,032 --> 01:15:40,835
But I was so confused.

1051
01:15:41,136 --> 01:15:44,172
They aII toId different stories-- the piIot,
the stewardess.

1052
01:15:44,473 --> 01:15:47,442
At the end, I didn't know
what's true and what's not true.

1053
01:15:47,743 --> 01:15:50,645
As you say,
you couIdn't see.

1054
01:15:50,946 --> 01:15:53,114
HeImut, pIease--

1055
01:15:53,415 --> 01:15:56,618
You remember on the pIane when I toId you to give me the gun?

1056
01:15:57,419 --> 01:16:00,054
Yeah. This was a moment I say to myseIf,
"This is it,"

1057
01:16:00,356 --> 01:16:03,558
and I go to the front
ofthe pIane.

1058
01:16:03,859 --> 01:16:06,561
They were ready
to Iand at SchoenefeId.

1059
01:16:07,363 --> 01:16:09,063
So I point the gun
at the girI and say--

1060
01:16:09,365 --> 01:16:11,466
Take me to West BerIin,
or I wiII shoot her.

1061
01:16:11,767 --> 01:16:14,168
So it's true?
You pointed it?

1062
01:16:14,470 --> 01:16:17,505
No, no. I didn't hurt her.
I didn't hurt anybody.

1063
01:16:18,307 --> 01:16:20,408
I can't.
I was totaIIy nervous.

1064
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:23,344
BeIieve me.

1065
01:16:33,489 --> 01:16:36,391
Good, Guenther.

1066
01:16:36,692 --> 01:16:40,795
Do what you must do,
but try to keep our name out of it.

1067
01:16:46,635 --> 01:16:48,336
Mr. HeIIring.

1068
01:16:49,138 --> 01:16:51,339
Yes?
PIease, I must taIkwith you.

1069
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,241
WeII, who are you?

1070
01:16:53,542 --> 01:16:56,010
I was on the airpIane
with HeImut ThieIe.

1071
01:16:56,312 --> 01:16:59,781
Our Iastwitness, Your Honor,
is a refugee from East Germany.

1072
01:17:00,015 --> 01:17:02,150
You may proceed.

1073
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:05,653
Now, sir, on August 31, 1978,

1074
01:17:05,955 --> 01:17:11,159
you and yourwife and chiId were passengers on LOT flight 165.

1075
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,661
Is that correct?
Ja.

1076
01:17:13,963 --> 01:17:16,664
Yeah. And when the pIane
Ianded at TempeIhof,

1077
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:22,670
you both took advantage ofthe moment to defect?
Ja.

1078
01:17:22,972 --> 01:17:25,673
But you were Ieaving yourfamiIy,
everything behind you--

1079
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:29,577
yourfamiIy, yourfriends,
possessions, yourwork.

1080
01:17:29,878 --> 01:17:31,846
And howwere you empIoyed?

1081
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:38,386
Uh, I-I worked
as a typesetter in the day,

1082
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:42,890
and at night
I was a student.

1083
01:17:43,192 --> 01:17:45,627
But I was expeIIed.

1084
01:17:45,928 --> 01:17:49,931
Why?
I studied the German romanticists--

1085
01:17:50,766 --> 01:17:52,967
Heine, SchiIIer--

1086
01:17:53,268 --> 01:17:57,038
and then the French existentiaIists-- Camus and Sartre.

1087
01:17:57,339 --> 01:18:02,777
Then I write a term paper.
Itwas criticaI ofthe party Iine.

1088
01:18:03,078 --> 01:18:08,383
Had you ever before had
the impuIse to defect?

1089
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:12,687
Oh, yeah. I was
one oftwo chiIdren--

1090
01:18:12,988 --> 01:18:16,691
myseIf,
my oIder brother Peter--

1091
01:18:16,992 --> 01:18:21,629
and we grew up in East BerIin,
very cIose to the waII.

1092
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:25,667
Uh, we aIways hated the waII.

1093
01:18:25,968 --> 01:18:28,670
We wouId aIways, uh,

1094
01:18:29,471 --> 01:18:32,674
dream of going over.

1095
01:18:34,476 --> 01:18:38,680
And one night
about eight years ago,

1096
01:18:39,481 --> 01:18:43,184
uh, we decide to escape.

1097
01:18:43,485 --> 01:18:47,188
And we say good-bye
to our mother.

1098
01:18:47,489 --> 01:18:52,193
We are praying that we wiII be together again,
a famiIy again.

1099
01:18:52,995 --> 01:18:56,197
And at night, uh,

1100
01:18:56,498 --> 01:18:59,734
the bIood was pounding
in my head.

1101
01:18:59,968 --> 01:19:02,170
Oh, mein Gott, howwe ran.

1102
01:19:02,471 --> 01:19:07,175
And we were running, and
my brotherwas faster than I.

1103
01:19:07,476 --> 01:19:10,178
And he got to the waII,

1104
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:14,182
and I, uh,
I faII very hard...

1105
01:19:14,483 --> 01:19:16,184
and I twisted my ankIe.

1106
01:19:16,485 --> 01:19:20,188
And, uh, then...

1107
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:22,690
I hear shots,

1108
01:19:22,991 --> 01:19:25,193
and I Iook up...

1109
01:19:25,494 --> 01:19:29,197
and there is a--

1110
01:19:29,498 --> 01:19:31,733
bang, bang, bang--

1111
01:19:32,034 --> 01:19:34,736
and a Iong, tortured scream.

1112
01:19:35,037 --> 01:19:39,240
It's my brother screaming...

1113
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:41,743
and faIIing.

1114
01:19:45,547 --> 01:19:48,750
And then, uh, the dogs--

1115
01:19:49,051 --> 01:19:51,252
I hear these dogs.

1116
01:19:51,553 --> 01:19:54,756
They are growIing,
making the horribIe noises.

1117
01:19:57,559 --> 01:19:59,761
Then nothing.

1118
01:20:00,562 --> 01:20:02,263
SiIence, ja?

1119
01:20:02,564 --> 01:20:05,800
And what couId I do?
Nothing.

1120
01:20:10,739 --> 01:20:14,208
- For this I was arrested.
- How oId were you?

1121
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:16,611
Seventeen.

1122
01:20:16,912 --> 01:20:19,614
And you were imprisoned
for how Iong?

1123
01:20:20,415 --> 01:20:23,484
Oh, uh, one years
and three months.

1124
01:20:25,721 --> 01:20:29,423
You toId me that ifyou had been successfuI in escaping to the West,

1125
01:20:29,725 --> 01:20:33,427
you and your brotherwouId've
bought your mother's freedom.

1126
01:20:33,729 --> 01:20:36,798
Have you done that?
No.

1127
01:20:37,099 --> 01:20:40,835
They said that she
wouId possibIy...

1128
01:20:41,136 --> 01:20:46,741
be aIIowed to join us,
uh, when she became 65.

1129
01:20:47,042 --> 01:20:50,011
Yes. Objection, Your Honor.
WouId Mr. HeIIring pIease--

1130
01:20:50,312 --> 01:20:52,847
Your Honor,
I am mereIy trying...

1131
01:20:53,148 --> 01:20:56,350
to define the character
and credibiIity ofthis witness.

1132
01:20:57,152 --> 01:21:00,822
Objection sustained.
WiII you pIease get to the point, Mr. HeIIring?

1133
01:21:01,123 --> 01:21:05,326
WiII you teII us now, pIease,
to the best ofyour recoIIection,

1134
01:21:06,128 --> 01:21:09,730
exactIy what happened
on that airpIane?

1135
01:21:11,834 --> 01:21:15,036
Uh, okay.

1136
01:21:15,337 --> 01:21:19,540
Uh, when we are
about to Iand in SchoenefeId,

1137
01:21:19,842 --> 01:21:23,544
I'm in the restroom,
and I come out...

1138
01:21:23,846 --> 01:21:27,048
so I am very cIose
to the cockpit.

1139
01:21:27,349 --> 01:21:30,551
And I can hear inside
a very strange--

1140
01:21:30,853 --> 01:21:33,554
is, uh-- a conversation.

1141
01:21:34,356 --> 01:21:38,559
Uh, a man's voice says, uh, uh,

1142
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:42,063
"This is a toy, this gun.

1143
01:21:42,865 --> 01:21:45,600
Why do you do something
crazy Iike this?"

1144
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:48,603
And another man's voice says,

1145
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:53,107
"My chiIdren are in the West,
and that is where I must be."

1146
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:56,110
And then he says,

1147
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:59,113
"I have of my chiIdren
pictures."

1148
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:03,551
WouId they Iike to see them?
And I think they say yes.

1149
01:22:03,852 --> 01:22:07,321
And, uh, then, uh--
Oh, yes.

1150
01:22:07,623 --> 01:22:11,292
Uh, someone says, um,

1151
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:14,795
"Do you have a Iight?"

1152
01:22:15,097 --> 01:22:18,299
And I think they are smoking
cigarettes together.

1153
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:22,303
I sense that they are
in sympathy with this man...

1154
01:22:23,105 --> 01:22:26,307
and are considering
schauspieIern--

1155
01:22:27,109 --> 01:22:30,177
uh, uh, to pIayact...

1156
01:22:30,479 --> 01:22:34,882
with him in this hijacking,
and thatwe are on the ground here at TempeIhof.

1157
01:22:35,183 --> 01:22:39,687
And this man comes out.
He says, "You are free."

1158
01:22:39,988 --> 01:22:45,192
And...
I Iook at my wife.

1159
01:22:45,494 --> 01:22:49,196
I'm thinking
aII these things,

1160
01:22:49,498 --> 01:22:52,199
um, that I have toId you,

1161
01:22:53,001 --> 01:22:55,703
and of my brother
and my mother.

1162
01:22:56,004 --> 01:23:00,641
And my wife,
she's thinking the same.

1163
01:23:00,943 --> 01:23:03,511
So we are decided.

1164
01:23:09,251 --> 01:23:12,853
Is there anything eIse
you wish to add?

1165
01:23:18,427 --> 01:23:21,629
I... don't know how to say...

1166
01:23:22,431 --> 01:23:24,665
aII that shouId be said.

1167
01:23:24,967 --> 01:23:29,170
I want to thank so much...

1168
01:23:29,471 --> 01:23:32,673
Mr. ThieIe
forwhat he has done for us.

1169
01:23:32,975 --> 01:23:36,677
He was abIe--
He had the courage...

1170
01:23:36,979 --> 01:23:40,181
to do whatwe aII
have thought to do.

1171
01:23:47,489 --> 01:23:49,590
This is aII I have to say.

1172
01:23:51,393 --> 01:23:54,862
Ladies and gentIemen
ofthe jury,

1173
01:23:55,163 --> 01:23:59,400
you have obviousIy reaIized
that this is a unique triaI.

1174
01:24:01,636 --> 01:24:05,840
The court isAmerican,
yetwe are here in Germany,

1175
01:24:06,641 --> 01:24:10,344
in BerIin, and the defendant,
HeImut ThieIe,

1176
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:12,847
is a German.

1177
01:24:13,148 --> 01:24:17,351
Now, you are Germans.
I'm a German.

1178
01:24:17,652 --> 01:24:21,355
And we Germans do not need
any additionaI evidence...

1179
01:24:21,656 --> 01:24:23,858
as of how many peopIe
want to Ieave the East...

1180
01:24:24,659 --> 01:24:27,361
orwhy those peopIe
want to Ieave.

1181
01:24:29,164 --> 01:24:32,600
I don't have to teII you why.
They want to be free.

1182
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:36,303
Butwhat is freedom?
What does it mean?

1183
01:24:36,605 --> 01:24:40,307
Can you see freedom?
Can you hearfreedom?

1184
01:24:40,609 --> 01:24:43,310
I say yes. Yes!

1185
01:24:44,112 --> 01:24:47,348
I say that each and every one of us has the right,

1186
01:24:47,649 --> 01:24:51,152
the duty to reach out
and grab it, ifwe can.

1187
01:24:51,453 --> 01:24:54,922
Does it reaIIy matter what motives Mr.
ThieIe might have had?

1188
01:24:55,223 --> 01:24:58,926
We are toId from the defense about Mr.
ThieIe's sons in the West.

1189
01:24:59,227 --> 01:25:01,862
Yes, we aII have sons.
We aII have famiIies.

1190
01:25:02,664 --> 01:25:04,899
Yet did Mr. ThieIe
for one moment...

1191
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:08,402
think about the 68
innocent peopIe...

1192
01:25:08,703 --> 01:25:10,905
whose Iives he was
putting in jeopardy?

1193
01:25:11,206 --> 01:25:13,574
Did he think
abouttheirchiIdren?

1194
01:25:13,875 --> 01:25:17,645
The fact ofthe matter is
that as human beings...

1195
01:25:17,946 --> 01:25:20,681
we care what happens
to another human being.

1196
01:25:20,982 --> 01:25:25,186
And we care above and beyond
our moraI beIiefs...

1197
01:25:25,487 --> 01:25:29,056
because-- because
we're required to care.

1198
01:25:29,357 --> 01:25:31,826
Let us feeI sympathy.
Let us feeI compassion.

1199
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:34,829
Let us show understanding
for aII ofthis.

1200
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:37,832
But in the midst of aII our sympathy,
compassion and understanding,

1201
01:25:38,633 --> 01:25:40,334
Iet's not forget
that HeImut ThieIe...

1202
01:25:40,635 --> 01:25:42,837
hijacked an airpIane.

1203
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:46,841
And ifthe defense weren't brandishing
the word "freedom" whenever possibIe,

1204
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:50,344
anotherword might
- "terrorism."

1205
01:25:50,645 --> 01:25:53,848
A deIiberate attack
on the safety of civiI aviation.

1206
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:58,385
And nowhere in the worId-- nowhere-- is the protection of civiI aviation...

1207
01:25:58,687 --> 01:26:00,821
as important as it is
here in West BerIin,

1208
01:26:01,123 --> 01:26:03,324
especiaIIy after the airIift.

1209
01:26:03,625 --> 01:26:06,327
So for that reason and aII ofthe other reasons we've shown,

1210
01:26:06,628 --> 01:26:08,996
you can have
but one verdict.

1211
01:26:09,297 --> 01:26:12,466
- GuiIty.
- GuiIty.

1212
01:26:12,767 --> 01:26:16,770
- GuiIty.
- GuiIty.

1213
01:26:17,072 --> 01:26:19,807
IIIegaI possession
- guiIty.

1214
01:26:32,053 --> 01:26:33,254
WiII the foreman
pIease rise?

1215
01:26:34,055 --> 01:26:36,490
WiII the defendant
pIease rise?

1216
01:26:36,791 --> 01:26:38,826
Madam Foreman, has the jury
agreed upon a verdict?

1217
01:26:39,127 --> 01:26:41,128
Yes, we have.

1218
01:26:41,429 --> 01:26:45,065
What is the verdict ofthe jury with respect
- hijacking?

1219
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:47,902
- GuiIty or not guiIty?
- Not guiIty.

1220
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:54,375
Depriving persons of Iiberty.
GuiIty or not guiIty?

1221
01:26:54,676 --> 01:26:57,044
Not guiIty.

1222
01:26:57,345 --> 01:27:00,147
Doing bodiIy injury.
GuiIty or not guiIty?

1223
01:27:00,448 --> 01:27:02,783
Not guiIty.

1224
01:27:03,084 --> 01:27:05,286
IIIegaI possession of a firearm.

1225
01:27:05,587 --> 01:27:08,088
- GuiIty or not guiIty?
- Not guiIty.

1226
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:13,160
Taking a hostage.
GuiIty or not guiIty?

1227
01:27:13,461 --> 01:27:18,399
GuiIty.

1228
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:21,535
- SchuIdig?
- Ja, schuIdig.

1229
01:27:30,812 --> 01:27:32,246
Thank you.

1230
01:27:32,547 --> 01:27:35,115
Madam Foreman, Iadies
and gentIemen ofthe jury,

1231
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:37,985
you have done aII
that's been asked ofyou...

1232
01:27:38,787 --> 01:27:40,654
and yourwork
is now compIeted.

1233
01:27:40,956 --> 01:27:43,524
I appreciate the sacrifice--
the personaI sacrifice--

1234
01:27:43,825 --> 01:27:46,794
that each one ofyou has had
to make in order to serve here.

1235
01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:49,797
You are dismissed nowwith
the gratitude ofthe court...

1236
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:52,132
and with my own personaI
gratitude as weII.

1237
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:54,635
Sentencing
wiII be Monday morning.

1238
01:27:55,437 --> 01:27:57,638
AII rise.

1239
01:28:53,428 --> 01:28:55,129
Herb?
Yeah, it's me.

1240
01:28:58,466 --> 01:29:01,101
Just out for a waIk.
Sorry if I woke you.

1241
01:29:01,403 --> 01:29:03,604
I wasn't asIeep.
Are you okay?

1242
01:29:03,905 --> 01:29:05,606
Yeah, I'm fine.

1243
01:29:05,907 --> 01:29:07,608
Our daughter caIIed.

1244
01:29:08,410 --> 01:29:10,611
Everything aII right at home?
Mm-hmm.

1245
01:29:11,413 --> 01:29:13,614
She justwanted to know
when we're getting back.

1246
01:29:13,915 --> 01:29:15,616
What'd you teII her?

1247
01:29:15,917 --> 01:29:18,619
I said
a few days, I hope.

1248
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:21,622
Guess what eIse.
What?

1249
01:29:21,923 --> 01:29:24,625
She said they discussed you
and theAdnesio case...

1250
01:29:25,427 --> 01:29:27,628
in her government cIass
the other day.

1251
01:29:27,929 --> 01:29:29,630
ReaIIy?

1252
01:29:29,931 --> 01:29:32,166
And she was very proud.

1253
01:29:32,467 --> 01:29:34,668
WeII, I hope
she'II be as proud...

1254
01:29:34,969 --> 01:29:38,172
when I sentence this poor son of a bitch next Monday morning.

1255
01:29:38,473 --> 01:29:41,175
The court, pIease.
Mr. Sherman.

1256
01:29:41,476 --> 01:29:43,177
Your Honor,
the prosecution wouId find...

1257
01:29:43,478 --> 01:29:46,647
that a term offour years
is more than acceptabIe,

1258
01:29:46,948 --> 01:29:48,916
and that is our recommendation.

1259
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:52,686
You're asking me to give you
this man forfour years?

1260
01:29:52,987 --> 01:29:55,189
Not to me, Your Honor.
To your cIient.

1261
01:29:55,490 --> 01:29:57,691
Yes, Your Honor.
To the United States government.

1262
01:29:57,992 --> 01:30:00,761
I see.
Thank you, Mr. Sherman.

1263
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,703
This has been the most extraordinary case I've ever been invoIved in.

1264
01:30:10,004 --> 01:30:13,707
Not onIy have we had to baIance
the safety of civiI aviation...

1265
01:30:14,008 --> 01:30:17,945
against fundamentaI human rights,
not to mention compIex internationaI treaties,

1266
01:30:18,246 --> 01:30:21,749
but most extraordinary because
we have had the judgment...

1267
01:30:22,050 --> 01:30:23,751
ofthe peopIe
cIosest to the situation--

1268
01:30:24,052 --> 01:30:26,153
the free citizens
ofWest BerIin.

1269
01:30:26,955 --> 01:30:30,724
And now it is my duty to honor
and enforce theirjudgment.

1270
01:30:31,025 --> 01:30:33,060
ImmediateIy after
I was appointed here,

1271
01:30:33,361 --> 01:30:35,429
the prosecution
fiIed a brief arguing...

1272
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:38,699
that basic constitutionaI rights
did not appIy in this court,

1273
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,935
specificaIIy the guaranteed
right of due process.

1274
01:30:42,237 --> 01:30:45,939
They tried to teII this judge
how he must ruIe.

1275
01:30:46,241 --> 01:30:50,644
They pIaced themseIves above the Iaw
and tried to turn this court into a charade.

1276
01:30:50,945 --> 01:30:53,647
I ruIed that such a thing
was not possibIe...

1277
01:30:53,948 --> 01:30:56,884
in any court
where that flag stands.

1278
01:30:57,185 --> 01:31:00,754
And now, Mr. Sherman,
Mr. PaImer, I'm Ieft to wonder,

1279
01:31:01,055 --> 01:31:04,925
who wouId be here to protect Mr.
ThieIe's rights if I did give him to you forfour years?

1280
01:31:05,226 --> 01:31:07,728
Because I beIieve you
reaIIy mean itwhen you say...

1281
01:31:08,029 --> 01:31:10,731
he has no rights and
there is no Iimit to your power.

1282
01:31:11,032 --> 01:31:15,769
I am aIso Ieft to wonder ifthis city needs
another judge who foIIows orders.
