196
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,655
I'm never gonna end up like

197
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:33,513
that.

198
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,231
She's just trying to show you

199
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:45,759
that she loves you.

200
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,109
Good night.

201
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:25,341
Okay, if we were Thelma and

202
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:26,910
Louise, which one would you be?

203
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:28,712
Thelma, so I could run into

204
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:30,714
Brad Pitt's penis.

205
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:32,048
You can have Michael madsen.

206
00:09:32,641 --> 00:09:33,717
He's kind of cute.

207
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:35,318
No. You thought he's cute?

208
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:36,820
Pompadours are hot.

209
00:09:36,844 --> 00:09:39,022
No, they're not hot.

210
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:41,324
Don't be so boring, Harriet.

211
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:42,726
You used to think pompadours

212
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,893
were hot before you got into

213
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:44,629

we got halfway.

318
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:54,303
And on this historic day,

319
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:56,172
many in the United States are

00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:58,107

00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:00,009
extreme act of terrorism?"

00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:06,415
The president emphasized the

323
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:07,984
need for calm and assured...

324
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,095
It's still too early to

325
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:20,529
estimate casualties, but it

326
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:22,098
could easily total in the

327
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:23,067
millions in the

328
00:15:23,091 --> 00:15:24,934
immediate aftermath and untold

329
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,602
more in the ensuing weeks from

330
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:29,305
radiation exposure.

331
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:54,097
Air's terrible here.

332
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:57,100
Could be wildfire season.

333
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:58,501
Do they have that here?

334
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:01,070
The sky looks a little crazy.

335
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:02,205
I'm just gonna go look for

336
00:16:02,229 --> 00:16:02,606
a phone.

337
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,464
I'll be right back.

338
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:19,588
No phone anywhere, but I found

339
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:21,614
something better.

340
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:30,466
Hi.

341
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,701
I made friends.

342
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:33,769
What's this?

343
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:35,204
Um...

344
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:36,405
That's my work.

345
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:39,308
I'm an inker... for comics.

the female characters in these

348
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:43,179
things have to dress in such

349
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:44,413
skimpy outfits to beat up bad

351
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:46,016
It's essential.

353
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:47,616

354
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,185
Sure.

Thank you.

356
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,586
It just seems like such a

359
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,098
Right.

360
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:03,599
Forgot that part.

361
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:05,101

363
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:07,436

368
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:13,209
Yes, I'm a writer.

369
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:20,516
I'm sorry.

370
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,186
I'm just not feeling great.

371
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,187
Quit being such a

372
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:25,221
psychosomatic pussy.

373
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:26,422
I'm not a psychosomatic

374
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:27,157
pussy, man.

375
00:17:27,181 --> 00:17:28,491
I don't feel good.

376
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:30,326
So, Harriet, reba says that

377
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,061
you might be able to give US

378
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:32,496
a ride.

379
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,730
She did?

380
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:36,332
Just up the road a bit.

381
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:37,800
We really appreciate your

382
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:38,602
kindness.

383
00:17:38,626 --> 00:17:40,503
It would, like, totally cement

384
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:41,837
our faith in humanity.

385
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:44,240
Reba, can I talk to you for

386
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:45,175
a minute?

387
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:46,699
Yeah.

388
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,156
Why did you tell them they

389
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,190
could come with US?

390
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:02,325
They're a little weird, but

391
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:03,492
they're musicians, so it's par

392
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:04,228
for the course.

393
00:18:04,252 --> 00:18:05,528
I do not think this is a good

394
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:05,829
idea.

395
00:18:05,853 --> 00:18:07,196
Okay, it's been a little

396
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,364
while since you had a date.

397
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:09,665
You can thank me when it's over.

398
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:10,633
But only if you come.

399
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:11,600
That's ridiculous.

400
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:12,402
I had a date...

401
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:14,603
Give me the keys.

402
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:15,871
What is that?

403
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:16,805
A taser.

404
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:17,674
A what?

405
00:18:17,698 --> 00:18:19,442
A taser.

406
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:20,609
It's a weapon.

407
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,545
Give me the keys.

408
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:23,812
I'm not giving you the keys.

409
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,181
Dude, what are you doing?

410
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:26,449
I thought only women carried

411
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:26,782
tasers.

412
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:27,450
Shut up!

413
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:28,284
Come on, man.

414
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:29,186
What are you doing?

415
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,419
I'm getting US the hell out

416
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:31,554
of this godforsaken country

417
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:32,821
if these two bitches would just

418
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,223
shut up and give me the keys!

419
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:35,224
He's just being real

420
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:35,724
squirrelly.

421
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:36,492
You're being

422
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:37,361
super-squirrelly.

423
00:18:37,385 --> 00:18:38,461
Just shut up, you guys.

424
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:39,628
In case you haven't noticed,

425
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:40,763
what we're doing is totally

426
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:41,365
illegal.

427
00:18:41,389 --> 00:18:42,565
No, man, what you're doing

428
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:43,766
is totally illegal, all right?

429
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,234
We already agreed that there

430
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:46,235
is no illegal anymore.

431
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:47,204
That's what I meant.

432
00:18:47,228 --> 00:18:48,471
All right, man, but that's no

433
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:49,638
excuse for bad acting to enter

434
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:50,339
the equation.

435
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:51,307
No matter the state of

436
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:51,707
the world.

437
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:52,609
State of the world?

438
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,810
You two... shut up... keys!

439
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:56,212
Do you have to yell, man?

440
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:57,313
Some of US have splitting

441
00:18:57,337 --> 00:18:57,747
headaches.

442
00:18:57,771 --> 00:18:59,282
You're sick, too, aren't you?

443
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:00,249
I'm not sick, man.

444
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:01,151
I have a headache.

445
00:19:01,175 --> 00:19:02,218
I'm warning you guys.

446
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:03,252
She's gonna give you

447
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:03,686
the keys.

448
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,488
No, I'm not.

449
00:19:04,512 --> 00:19:05,554
I'm not fucking around

450
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:05,922
anymore!

451
00:19:05,946 --> 00:19:07,456
Give me the fucking keys!!

452
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,192
Totally squirrelly.

453
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:12,428
It was an accident!

454
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:14,231
Sorry!

455
00:19:14,255 --> 00:19:15,232
You okay?!

456
00:19:15,256 --> 00:19:16,765
What the hell were you

457
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:17,500
doing?!

458
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:18,402
No, no!

459
00:19:18,426 --> 00:19:20,903
Give me the keys! Now!!

460
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:29,812
Hey, look...

461
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,780
I'm real sorry we're stealing

462
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:33,716
your car and everything, but

463
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,718
it's pretty much every man...

464
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:37,653
Every person for himself out

465
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:38,455
there, so...

466
00:19:38,479 --> 00:19:40,923
Let's move!

467
00:19:41,782 --> 00:19:43,826
Lie on the ground and put your

468
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,594
hands behind your head.

469
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:46,695
Count to, like, 100?

470
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,431
And don't move until you're done

471
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:49,932
or we won't be as nice as we've

472
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:51,934
been.

473
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:08,884
36, 37, 38...

474
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:16,325
39, 40, 41, 42...

475
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:21,554
43, 44, 45...

476
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:45,554
We need to find a phone.

477
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,491
Damn it.

478
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:49,692
My phone was in the car.

479
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:51,494
Yeah, mine too.

480
00:20:51,518 --> 00:20:52,429
Let's go.

481
00:20:52,453 --> 00:20:53,996
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

482
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,531
I think there was a gas station

483
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:56,333
back that way.

484
00:20:56,357 --> 00:20:58,534
Yeah, but Austin is that way.

485
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:00,669
It'd be stupid to go back that

486
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:01,505
way now.

487
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:02,738
Stupid?

488
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,274
You know what's stupid?

489
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:06,975
We just got carjacked, almost

490
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,777
tased, and all your clothes

491
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,613
are probably getting worn by

492
00:21:10,637 --> 00:21:13,048
three skinny guys right now.

493
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:18,887
Sorry I missed the first class,

494
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:20,689
professor smarty-pants.

495
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:21,957
You wouldn't believe what

496
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:23,559
happened to me this weekend.

497
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,661
I wasn't quite overcocky.

498
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,597
Overcocky?

499
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:29,065
Yeah.

500
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:30,599
It means a totally fucked-up

501
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:31,335
situation.

502
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:32,435
No, it doesn't.

503
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:33,802
It means when a bunch of dudes

504
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:37,773
come all over a girl's face.

505
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,375
My point exactly.

506
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:45,514
You're weird.

507
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:47,883
You're gonna miss me...

508
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:48,617
Bad.

509
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,085
Come on.

510
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:50,486
I bet the first people who see

511
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,020
US will stop.

512
00:21:51,044 --> 00:21:52,988

Clothes and comics or something.

Great.

527
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:32,828
It will be something for US

528
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,430
to burn later when we freeze

529
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:34,798

It's freezing out here!

This is by far the darkest dark

540
00:23:04,684 --> 00:23:05,794
I've ever seen, and we're

541
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:07,062
probably gonna freeze to death

542
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:08,464

Hey.

546
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,902
Things could still turn around.

547
00:23:14,762 --> 00:23:15,904
Jesus!

548
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:17,573
What are you talking about?

549
00:23:17,597 --> 00:23:19,432
That's crazy.

550
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:27,149
That's not crazy, actually.

551
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:29,852
You want to know what's crazy is

552
00:23:29,876 --> 00:23:32,555
picking up three strange hipster

553
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:34,890
boys at a deserted rest stop.

554
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:35,692
That's crazy.

555
00:23:35,716 --> 00:23:36,792
You know, whatever.

556
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:38,160
We wouldn't have been at that

557
00:23:38,184 --> 00:23:39,795
crappy rest stop if you weren't

558
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:40,530
leaving me.

559
00:23:40,554 --> 00:23:41,864
What are you talking about?

560
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:43,165
I'm not leaving you, I'm just

561
00:23:43,189 --> 00:23:44,467
moving on with my life.

562
00:23:44,491 --> 00:23:45,601
You didn't even talk to me

563
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:45,969
about it.

564
00:23:45,993 --> 00:23:47,670
Yeah, I don't have to consult

565
00:23:47,694 --> 00:23:47,971
you.

566
00:23:47,995 --> 00:23:49,505
That's part of making adult

567
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:51,006
decisions which you know nothing

568
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:51,774
about.

569
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:52,140
What?

570
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:52,742
My god.

571
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:53,942
Of course we end up here in the

572
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:55,077
middle of nowhere because i'm

573
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:56,111
with you and you don't...

574
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:57,145
You don't think about the

575
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:57,846
consequences.

576
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:58,648
You just do shit.

577
00:23:58,672 --> 00:23:59,748
Because thinking has gotten

578
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:02,618
you so far?

579
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:03,719
You're just jealous.

580
00:24:03,743 --> 00:24:04,820
Of what?

581
00:24:04,844 --> 00:24:06,522
What... lame grad school?

582
00:24:06,546 --> 00:24:07,823
Fucking Texas?

583
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:09,458
No, that i'm... I'm moving on

584
00:24:09,482 --> 00:24:10,859
with my life, that I'm actually

585
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:12,160
doing something with myself.

586
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:13,562
Is that what the armchair

587
00:24:13,586 --> 00:24:14,663
shits told you in the crazy

588
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:14,964
place?

589
00:24:14,988 --> 00:24:16,098
Yeah, as a matter of fact,

590
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:16,666
they did.

591
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,567
I don't even know who you are

592
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:20,035
anymore... like, with your

593
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:21,837
stupid post-it notes and your

594
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:23,706
blind denial and all that weird

595
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:26,742
psychoanalyzation.

596
00:24:26,766 --> 00:24:28,711
You are not moving on.

597
00:24:28,735 --> 00:24:30,513
You're just moving.

598
00:24:30,537 --> 00:24:33,849
You are not growing up.

599
00:24:33,873 --> 00:24:35,518
All you're doing is turning

600
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:37,085
your back on what you already

601
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:38,921
have.

602
00:24:38,945 --> 00:24:41,089
Fuck this.

603
00:24:41,113 --> 00:24:42,525
Hey!

604
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,227
Harriet!

605
00:24:44,251 --> 00:24:45,228
Aah!

606
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,670
Hello?

607
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:12,588
Are you okay?

608
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:13,590
Aah!

609
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:18,694
Are you okay or are you hurt,

610
00:25:18,718 --> 00:25:19,028
or...?

611
00:25:19,052 --> 00:25:21,564
No.

612
00:25:21,588 --> 00:25:22,798
No, i'm... I'm okay.

613
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:24,567
I just thought... I thought

614
00:25:24,591 --> 00:25:25,801
I was gonna hit you.

615
00:25:27,594 --> 00:25:29,204
No, I'm okay.

616
00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:30,939
You did great.

617
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:34,076
It's probably both of our lucky

618
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:34,644
days.

619
00:25:34,668 --> 00:25:36,078
My friend and I lost our car,

620
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:37,913
and no one stopped for US, so

621
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:39,715
I-I just had to wave someone

622
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:40,116
down.

623
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,817
It was pretty stupid.

624
00:25:41,841 --> 00:25:42,652
Yep.

625
00:25:45,612 --> 00:25:49,758
I'm Harriet.

626
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:51,651
Sean.

627
00:25:55,655 --> 00:25:57,132
Look, I don't want to intrude

628
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:58,801
or anything, but would you mind

629
00:25:58,825 --> 00:26:00,736
giving US a ride?

630
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,170
Harriet, maybe this isn't

631
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:03,205
such a good idea.

632
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:06,909
Where you going?

633
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:09,678
Somewhere with a phone?

634
00:26:14,607 --> 00:26:17,586
Hello?

635
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:20,055
Hop in.

636
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,915
Gas station up the road a piece.

637
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:54,990
Where you from?

638
00:26:55,014 --> 00:26:57,793
Los Angeles.

639
00:26:57,817 --> 00:26:59,828
No, I mean, where are you

640
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:00,863
really from?

641
00:27:00,887 --> 00:27:02,865
Sean...

642
00:27:02,889 --> 00:27:06,702
Do you live around here?

643
00:27:06,726 --> 00:27:09,271
Where are you girls headed?

644
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:10,906
Austin.

645
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,975
What's in Austin?

646
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:14,409
I'm starting graduate school.

647
00:27:15,235 --> 00:27:18,747
In what... your dreams?

648
00:27:18,771 --> 00:27:22,918
No, in information studies.

649
00:27:22,942 --> 00:27:24,219
It's interdisciplinary.

650
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:25,654
It ain't happening.

651
00:27:25,678 --> 00:27:27,055
We should just get out.

652
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:27,923
This is not okay.

653
00:27:27,947 --> 00:27:28,825
We could just walk.

654
00:27:28,849 --> 00:27:30,025
We are exactly where we're

655
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:30,827
supposed to be.

656
00:27:30,851 --> 00:27:35,363
No secrets!

657
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:36,132
I'm sorry.

658
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:37,933
I didn't... I didn't mean to be

659
00:27:37,957 --> 00:27:38,367
sharp.

660
00:27:38,391 --> 00:27:40,168
I'm just a little stressed with

661
00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:41,403
everything that's been

662
00:27:41,427 --> 00:27:43,071
happening.

663
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:44,673
Well, I guess

664
00:27:44,697 --> 00:27:46,241
since we just got carjacked, we

665
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:47,910
have a little bit of a leg up

666
00:27:47,934 --> 00:27:49,177
on those stress levels.

667
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:55,050
You making fun of me?

668
00:27:55,074 --> 00:27:56,218
No.

669
00:27:56,242 --> 00:27:57,452
No, no.

670
00:27:57,476 --> 00:27:59,454
Why would I do that?

671
00:27:59,478 --> 00:28:00,256
Yeah, no.

672
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,824
She's totally serious.

673
00:28:01,848 --> 00:28:03,358
You girls think this is

674
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:04,727
a time for jokes?

675
00:28:04,751 --> 00:28:06,962
A time for fun and games?

676
00:28:06,986 --> 00:28:09,732
No, this... this is a time

677
00:28:09,756 --> 00:28:11,266
for reckoning.

678
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,801
That's what this is.

679
00:28:12,825 --> 00:28:13,301
Why?

680
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:14,170
Harriet.

681
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:16,972
Isaiah.

682
00:28:16,996 --> 00:28:20,075
"The earth is polluted because

683
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:22,177
of its inhabitants who have

684
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:25,413
transgressed laws, violated

685
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:27,750
statues, broken the ancient

686
00:28:27,774 --> 00:28:28,317
covenant.

687
00:28:28,341 --> 00:28:31,854
Therefore, a curse devours

688
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:34,723
the earth."

689
00:28:34,747 --> 00:28:36,424
He knew it.

690
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:38,426
Forest knew it.

691
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,362
And he was righteous.

692
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:42,230
I never doubted him.

693
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:43,099
Never.

694
00:28:43,123 --> 00:28:47,002
Not once.

695
00:28:47,026 --> 00:28:48,236
Why are...

696
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,205
Just nod your head.

697
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,473
Secrets!

698
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:58,947
Going after the bases, if you

699
00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:00,816
ask me.

700
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,985
Koreans.

701
00:29:03,009 --> 00:29:04,486
North Koreans.

702
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,321
They're the only ones who can

703
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:07,256
do it.

704
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,824
Hey, asshole.

705
00:29:08,848 --> 00:29:09,958
I'm Chinese.

706
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:11,526
Don't you have to report in

707
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,295
somewhere?

708
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:14,062
Yeah, I kept telling everybody

709
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,130
about you people.

710
00:29:16,023 --> 00:29:17,132
No one believed me.

711
00:29:20,326 --> 00:29:21,870
Sean, um...

712
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:23,038
Do not engage.

713
00:29:23,062 --> 00:29:24,039
I can hear you.

714
00:29:24,063 --> 00:29:25,364
I'm right here!

715
00:29:27,133 --> 00:29:28,443
Hey, Sean, do you think you

716
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:29,945
could slow down a little bit?

717
00:29:29,969 --> 00:29:31,279
You think you can pull your

718
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:32,215
sneaky shit on me?

719
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:33,548
You done fucked with the wrong

720
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:35,083
country this time.

721
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:37,485
Now we are gonna bring the pain.

722
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:38,921
Stop the car, you crazy piece

723
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:39,288
of shit!

724
00:29:39,312 --> 00:29:40,522
We are gonna nuke your yellow

725
00:29:40,546 --> 00:29:41,824
asses back into judgment day

726
00:29:41,848 --> 00:29:42,557
for what you've done.

727
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:43,426
You get that right?

728
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,293
You understa that right?

729
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:46,829
Fuck you!

730
00:29:46,853 --> 00:29:47,563
Aah!

731
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:51,333
"Therefore a curse consumes

732
00:29:51,357 --> 00:29:52,367
the earth.

733
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:54,202
Its people must bear the guilt."

734
00:29:55,194 --> 00:29:56,005
Fuck you!

735
00:29:56,029 --> 00:29:57,405
You dickless sack of shit!

736
00:29:57,429 --> 00:29:58,907
We're gonna Bury you!

737
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:04,947
At the entrance to every...

738
00:30:06,906 --> 00:30:08,083
Forest knew it!

739
00:30:08,107 --> 00:30:10,252
He saw it coming, and you will

740
00:30:10,276 --> 00:30:11,820
pay for your sins!

741
00:30:11,844 --> 00:30:13,989
All of you from the west, they

742
00:30:14,013 --> 00:30:16,391
praise the lord, his majesty!

743
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:18,193
"Terror and traps..."

744
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:32,098
Where is everyone?

745
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:07,209
I'm gonna go out on a limb and

746
00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:09,111
say that this is the worst road

747
00:31:09,135 --> 00:31:09,912
trip ever.

748
00:31:10,903 --> 00:31:11,903
Yeah.

749
00:31:18,911 --> 00:31:20,179
Yeah.

750
00:31:22,348 --> 00:31:26,352
It's... terrible, actually.

751
00:31:29,455 --> 00:31:31,366
It's been a complete and utter

752
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,400
waste of time.

753
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:34,402
What? No. I...

754
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:36,895
I didn't mean it that way.

755
00:31:39,065 --> 00:31:40,475
The funny thing is, i'm

756
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:42,110
exactly where I'm supposed

757
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:45,080
to be.

758
00:31:45,104 --> 00:31:46,438
Nowhere.

759
00:31:50,076 --> 00:31:52,244
Wait. Harriet.

760
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,077
Open up.

761
00:33:23,602 --> 00:33:25,747
Harrie.

762
00:33:25,771 --> 00:33:27,349
I got something for you.

763
00:33:29,608 --> 00:33:30,685
Come on, harrie.

764
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:32,387
Got to be better out here

765
00:33:32,411 --> 00:33:34,256
with me than in a gas-station

766
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,116
bathroom.

767
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:45,533
Okay, let me just say something.

768
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:46,701
I know how important this is

769
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:48,036
to you...

770
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:51,063
And I know that it can feel...

771
00:33:56,335 --> 00:33:58,213
I know that it can feel dark

772
00:33:58,237 --> 00:34:00,115
sometimes.

773
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:02,741
But I'm your best friend.

774
00:34:06,212 --> 00:34:07,522
And we're gonna get you

775
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:10,082
to Austin no matter what.

776
00:34:22,361 --> 00:34:23,206
Hey.

777
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:26,274
Enough of this chicklet talk.

778
00:34:26,298 --> 00:34:30,778
Let's get wasted.

779
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:32,214
Okay, but we have to leave

780
00:34:32,238 --> 00:34:33,381
them a few bucks for beer.

781
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:35,317
Please.

782
00:34:35,341 --> 00:34:36,551
This day calls for something

783
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:40,488
a little bit less pussy.

784
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,556
Ha ha ha!

785
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,725
Go back to the candy pile.

786
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:46,528
My god!

787
00:34:46,552 --> 00:34:48,830
There you're also a doctor.

788
00:34:49,756 --> 00:34:50,733
My god!

789
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:51,833
I'm so punk rock!

790
00:34:51,857 --> 00:34:53,101
Go back to the chip pile.

791
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:53,602
My god.

792
00:34:53,626 --> 00:34:54,702
I should really clean that up.

793
00:34:54,726 --> 00:34:56,404
There you're a doctor, but

794
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:58,106
you're a failure 'cause you're

795
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,374
drunk like your father.

796
00:34:59,398 --> 00:35:01,176
Now, you go back to the candy

797
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,777
'cause that is where you turn

798
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:03,811
the light on...

799
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:05,347
Where you turn the light on...

800
00:35:05,371 --> 00:35:05,714
Die...

801
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:07,782
You're drunk.

802
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:09,451
And then you join all your

803
00:35:09,475 --> 00:35:11,219
friends in the afterlife because

804
00:35:11,243 --> 00:35:12,754
you were alive on the chip pile

805
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:14,356
the whole time, and time is

806
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,558
irrelevant.

807
00:35:16,582 --> 00:35:18,593
And that's the plot of loss.

808
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:20,628
Do you ever wonder why

809
00:35:20,652 --> 00:35:22,797
everyone on TV looks so good

810
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:24,699
when everything's going to shit?

811
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:26,368
Like...

812
00:35:26,392 --> 00:35:28,536
Milla jovovich.

813
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,405
She looked hot.

814
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:33,175
♪ Hold on, dear

815
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:35,243
♪ like a barnacle on the ship

816
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:36,378
of fear ♪

817
00:35:36,402 --> 00:35:39,214
♪ I'm out here

818
00:35:39,238 --> 00:35:41,549
♪ like an island on a sea

819
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:43,551
of tears ♪

820
00:35:43,575 --> 00:35:44,919
Hah.

821
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:45,821
Kick.

822
00:35:45,845 --> 00:35:47,489
I should probably wear shorts.

823
00:35:50,516 --> 00:35:51,526
What was that?

824
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,794
I don't know.

825
00:36:00,926 --> 00:36:01,737
I'll go this way.

826
00:36:01,761 --> 00:36:02,804
You go around the other side.

827
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:04,872
Wait. Harriet.

828
00:36:08,734 --> 00:36:09,577
I don't know, Sean.

829
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:10,413
I don't see nothing.

830
00:36:10,437 --> 00:36:12,780
She was here.

831
00:36:12,804 --> 00:36:13,915
The chink was in my car.

832
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:15,450
Sean, this don't feel right.

833
00:36:15,474 --> 00:36:16,818
I think we just need to just get

834
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:17,552
out of here.

835
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:18,387
I left them.

836
00:36:18,411 --> 00:36:19,854
They... they couldn't...

837
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:21,656
Got to get the dog out.

838
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,425
Sean, get in the car.

839
00:36:23,449 --> 00:36:25,617
Get the dog.

840
00:37:26,512 --> 00:37:26,889
Hey.

841
00:37:26,913 --> 00:37:28,290
Did you see something?

842
00:37:28,314 --> 00:37:31,583
Is there someone here?

843
00:37:35,387 --> 00:37:37,965
What's wrong?

844
00:37:38,958 --> 00:37:40,468
Okay, basically there are no

845
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:42,937
working phones in the southwest.

846
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:44,907
Come on.

847
00:37:44,931 --> 00:37:46,674
I don't really like it out here.

848
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:48,943
Let's just go inside, okay?

849
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:50,769
Okay?

850
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:32,010
Let's go.

851
00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:55,443
Let's just say for a second that

852
00:38:55,467 --> 00:38:55,978
there is a god.

853
00:38:56,002 --> 00:38:57,412
Why would he hate fags?

854
00:38:57,436 --> 00:38:58,746
I mean, why would he hate

855
00:38:58,770 --> 00:38:59,415
anyone?

856
00:38:59,439 --> 00:39:00,848
I thought that was the point

857
00:39:00,872 --> 00:39:01,949
of having a devil.

858
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:03,084
I just don't get it.

859
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:04,686
Did I ever tell you about that

860
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,887
friend of mine when I was

861
00:39:05,911 --> 00:39:07,422
little... what was her name?

862
00:39:07,446 --> 00:39:08,590
Lisa something or other.

863
00:39:08,614 --> 00:39:09,691
She was super-religious.

864
00:39:09,715 --> 00:39:11,058
I didn't realize it at the time,

865
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:12,560
but her parents used to take me

866
00:39:12,584 --> 00:39:13,895
to sunday school and mass every

867
00:39:13,919 --> 00:39:15,463
sunday when we were playing, and

868
00:39:15,487 --> 00:39:16,798
years later I get this Christmas

869
00:39:16,822 --> 00:39:18,032
card, and I swear to god the

870
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:19,501
only three words they used in

871
00:39:19,525 --> 00:39:20,768
the entire card were "Jesus,"

872
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:21,769
"savior," and "amen."

873
00:39:21,793 --> 00:39:22,937
How do you make a sentence

874
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:24,005
with those three words?

875
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:25,139
How do you send a card to

876
00:39:25,163 --> 00:39:25,841
somebody...

877
00:39:25,865 --> 00:39:27,675
Come with me to Austin.

878
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:29,076
What?

879
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,446
I am.

880
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,114
No...

881
00:39:33,138 --> 00:39:35,617
Stay with me...

882
00:39:35,641 --> 00:39:36,884
In Austin to live.

883
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:40,145
Yeah, right.

884
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,728
Harriet...

885
00:39:46,752 --> 00:39:48,796
Look, it's safer there, and

886
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,965
you've always said you wanted to

887
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:52,133
get out of L.A.

888
00:39:52,157 --> 00:39:53,968
You know, Austin could be

889
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:56,804
a fresh start.

890
00:39:56,828 --> 00:40:00,165
I don't know, Harriet.

891
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:05,714
Okay.

892
00:40:05,738 --> 00:40:07,849
I bet Austin has a great art

893
00:40:07,873 --> 00:40:10,084
scene, and it's smaller, so it

894
00:40:10,108 --> 00:40:12,487
would be easier to break your

895
00:40:12,511 --> 00:40:14,789
way into.

896
00:40:14,813 --> 00:40:16,491
And, you always say that

897
00:40:16,515 --> 00:40:18,059
you've slept with everyone in

898
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:19,894
Los Angeles, so it'd be a whole

899
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:21,095
new population.

900
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,655
That was a joke.

901
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,007
Los Angeles...

902
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:37,545
Is a wasteland.

903
00:40:37,569 --> 00:40:39,013
There's nothing there anymore.

904
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:40,214
It's not fair to say that

905
00:40:40,238 --> 00:40:41,149
there's nothing there.

906
00:40:41,173 --> 00:40:42,216
No, reba, what I'm trying

907
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,151
to tell you is that...

908
00:40:43,175 --> 00:40:44,719
Shh.

909
00:40:44,743 --> 00:40:45,119
What?

910
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:45,920
It's them!

911
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:46,489
Who?

912
00:40:46,513 --> 00:40:47,813
The hipsters!

913
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,094
Get down!

914
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:54,529
We have to hide!

915
00:40:54,553 --> 00:40:55,063
Where?!

916
00:40:55,087 --> 00:40:58,065
We're in the middle of the road!

917
00:40:59,224 --> 00:41:02,069
Wait, I have an idea.

918
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:04,071
Man, this chick has a ton

919
00:41:04,095 --> 00:41:04,940
of books.

920
00:41:04,964 --> 00:41:06,841
Books are no longer useful

921
00:41:06,865 --> 00:41:08,142
except as fire fuel.

922
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:09,744
That's ridiculous.

923
00:41:09,768 --> 00:41:11,613
Yeah, it really is, man.

924
00:41:12,938 --> 00:41:13,749
God.

925
00:41:13,773 --> 00:41:16,150
I think that I have the runs

926
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:16,952
again.

927
00:41:17,977 --> 00:41:19,687
Just 'cause there's a nuclear

928
00:41:19,711 --> 00:41:20,855
war doesn't mean we can't read.

929
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:25,126
And... we won't.

930
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,661
I mean, what's the point?

931
00:41:26,685 --> 00:41:27,530
I'm sorry.

932
00:41:27,554 --> 00:41:29,096
What's the point... of reading?

933
00:41:29,956 --> 00:41:31,032
I don't know, man.

934
00:41:31,056 --> 00:41:32,767
How about education or

935
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:34,836
entertainment or just trying

936
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,738
to expand your world view

937
00:41:36,762 --> 00:41:38,005
a little bit?

938
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:41,199
How about that?

939
00:41:43,569 --> 00:41:45,671
You're never gonna make it.

940
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:01,629
What if Mexico's just as

941
00:42:01,653 --> 00:42:01,964
fucked?

942
00:42:01,988 --> 00:42:03,030
As long as they didn't

943
00:42:03,054 --> 00:42:04,298
detonate nuclear weapons against

944
00:42:04,322 --> 00:42:05,133
their own people.

945
00:42:05,157 --> 00:42:06,300
You don't know that's what

946
00:42:06,324 --> 00:42:06,901
happened.

947
00:42:06,925 --> 00:42:07,803
It's so obvious.

948
00:42:07,827 --> 00:42:08,804
What about al-qaeda?

949
00:42:08,828 --> 00:42:10,104
What about

950
00:42:10,128 --> 00:42:10,806
al-qaeda?

951
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:12,139
What kind of fucking moron are

952
00:42:12,163 --> 00:42:12,640
you?

953
00:42:12,664 --> 00:42:13,141
Okay.

954
00:42:13,165 --> 00:42:14,909
What terrorist organization

955
00:42:14,933 --> 00:42:16,778
could detonate four bombs within

956
00:42:16,802 --> 00:42:18,613
the u.S. At the exact same time?

957
00:42:18,637 --> 00:42:19,147
Moron?

958
00:42:19,171 --> 00:42:20,648
What government could do that

959
00:42:20,672 --> 00:42:22,049
without US finding out about it

960
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:23,685
right away with four cities that

961
00:42:23,709 --> 00:42:24,919
happen to have key military

962
00:42:24,943 --> 00:42:25,953
bases right by?

963
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:27,188
Just shut up, all right?

964
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:28,756
You sound like a crazy person.

965
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,091
Right, man.

966
00:42:30,115 --> 00:42:31,292
I don't know!

967
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:33,961
Hey!

968
00:42:33,985 --> 00:42:34,796
Shut him up!

969
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:35,296
Stop it!

970
00:42:37,823 --> 00:42:39,667
Aah!

971
00:42:40,992 --> 00:42:43,137
What was that?

972
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:44,039
I don't know.

973
00:42:44,063 --> 00:42:45,239
He's been a fucking baby

974
00:42:45,263 --> 00:42:46,574
ever since I tased him.

975
00:42:46,598 --> 00:42:47,709
You know what, man?

976
00:42:47,733 --> 00:42:48,611
He's sick. Okay?

977
00:42:48,635 --> 00:42:49,744
And I'm not feeling great

978
00:42:49,768 --> 00:42:50,245
myself.

979
00:42:51,703 --> 00:42:52,947
Didn't any of your crazy comic

980
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:54,181
books teach you how to do this

981
00:42:54,205 --> 00:42:54,717
stuff?

982
00:42:54,741 --> 00:42:56,217
I got US this far, didn't I?

983
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:57,152
I'll get US out.

984
00:42:57,176 --> 00:42:58,153
Yeah, you did.

985
00:42:58,177 --> 00:42:59,154
Good for you.

986
00:42:59,178 --> 00:43:01,055
You know, you're not actually

987
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:02,590
looking 100%, either.

988
00:43:02,614 --> 00:43:06,060
Starting to feel a little sweat?

989
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:07,862
It's Texas, dickhead.

990
00:43:07,886 --> 00:43:10,064
Sweating's a recreational sport.

991
00:43:11,156 --> 00:43:12,734
That's cute.

992
00:43:12,758 --> 00:43:14,201
You should put that on

993
00:43:14,225 --> 00:43:16,061
a bumper sticker.

994
00:43:36,748 --> 00:43:38,717
Hi.

995
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:44,398
Remember me?

996
00:43:44,422 --> 00:43:46,091
Yeah.

997
00:43:49,995 --> 00:43:51,205
You haven't seen my friend,

998
00:43:51,229 --> 00:43:52,674
have you?

999
00:43:52,698 --> 00:43:55,643
The blond one... Steve... Alex?

1000
00:43:55,667 --> 00:43:56,878
It doesn't matter.

1001
00:43:56,902 --> 00:43:57,945
His name's Steve.

1002
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:00,381
I-I misplaced him.

1003
00:44:00,405 --> 00:44:03,751
No.

1004
00:44:03,775 --> 00:44:06,120
But I lost my friend, too.

1005
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:08,422
And now I'm just out here all

1006
00:44:08,446 --> 00:44:10,357
by myself...

1007
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:13,360
All alone, just little old me.

1008
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:14,662
Okay.

1009
00:44:14,686 --> 00:44:16,097
Come on.

1010
00:44:16,121 --> 00:44:17,032
You don't really think i'm

1011
00:44:17,056 --> 00:44:18,099
stupid enough to fall for that,

1012
00:44:18,123 --> 00:44:18,901
do you?

1013
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,338
Aah!

1014
00:44:23,362 --> 00:44:24,405
Jesus Christ!

1015
00:44:24,429 --> 00:44:26,207
What the hell is wrong with...

1016
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:31,402
Is he dead?

1017
00:44:41,479 --> 00:44:45,793
Hey, kit?

1018
00:44:45,817 --> 00:44:46,728
Wait, um, wait.

1019
00:44:46,752 --> 00:44:47,429
Can you just wait?

1020
00:44:47,453 --> 00:44:50,431
Sorry.

1021
00:44:50,455 --> 00:44:51,933
I know the bombs are making

1022
00:44:51,957 --> 00:44:53,234
things weird, and I'm still

1023
00:44:53,258 --> 00:44:54,869
trying to figure out what to do

1024
00:44:54,893 --> 00:44:55,403
about that.

1025
00:44:55,427 --> 00:44:56,904
This is gonna sound crazy, but

1026
00:44:56,928 --> 00:44:58,172
I feel like you might be the

1027
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:01,876
person who could hear it, so...

1028
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:02,845
Here goes.

1029
00:45:03,969 --> 00:45:06,280
Um...

1030
00:45:06,304 --> 00:45:08,115
You know, if I was being honest

1031
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:09,951
with myself, I don't have a lot

1032
00:45:09,975 --> 00:45:10,985
going right now.

1033
00:45:11,009 --> 00:45:12,954
I mean, I'm not a loser, but,

1034
00:45:13,445 --> 00:45:16,357
I'm sort of just nothing...

1035
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:19,160
Sort of a walking example

1036
00:45:19,184 --> 00:45:20,494
of unfulfilled potential.

1037
00:45:22,153 --> 00:45:24,331
So, anyway, I applied to grad

1038
00:45:24,355 --> 00:45:26,300
school and didn't get in.

1039
00:45:26,324 --> 00:45:28,002
But regardless, i'm... i'm

1040
00:45:28,026 --> 00:45:29,904
going, and it's the first time

1041
00:45:29,928 --> 00:45:32,006
in my life that...

1042
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:33,440
I haven't just fallen into

1043
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:34,776
whatever's easiest.

1044
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,077
And for better or for worse,

1045
00:45:36,101 --> 00:45:37,344
I'm dragging my friend along

1046
00:45:37,368 --> 00:45:38,946
with me, and... and that may not

1047
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:40,247
mean anything to you, but it

1048
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:43,017
means the world to me, and...

1049
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:44,485
That car right there, that's my

1050
00:45:44,509 --> 00:45:46,320
stuff.

1051
00:45:46,344 --> 00:45:49,256
And...

1052
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,392
Could I just have it back,

1053
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:53,360
please?

1054
00:45:53,384 --> 00:45:55,763
I always wanted to do

1055
00:45:55,787 --> 00:45:57,498
something like that.

1056
00:45:57,522 --> 00:46:00,134
I think that staying motivated

1057
00:46:00,158 --> 00:46:03,004
is more important than ever now,

1058
00:46:03,028 --> 00:46:06,073
and, and I guess things

1059
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:08,943
kind of gotten out of hand.

1060
00:46:08,967 --> 00:46:10,244
Yeah, and, you know, it's no

1061
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:10,879
big deal.

1062
00:46:10,903 --> 00:46:12,179
You know, I always like to say

1063
00:46:12,203 --> 00:46:13,380
that you're exactly where...

1064
00:46:13,404 --> 00:46:14,015
Gotcha!

1065
00:46:14,941 --> 00:46:17,251
Took you long enough.

1066
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:18,385
How about we find that friend

1067
00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:19,453
of yours and have ourselves

1068
00:46:19,477 --> 00:46:20,955
a little fun?

1069
00:46:24,916 --> 00:46:28,195
Harriet, get in the car!

1070
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:30,164
Go, reba, go!

1071
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:31,566
Aah!

1072
00:47:56,007 --> 00:47:58,152
Why did I do that?

1073
00:47:58,176 --> 00:47:58,586
Why?

1074
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:00,254
Hey, just calm down, okay?

1075
00:48:00,278 --> 00:48:01,189
It's okay.

1076
00:48:01,213 --> 00:48:02,589
It's gonna be okay.

1077
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:03,925
My god.

1078
00:48:03,949 --> 00:48:05,192
My mom...

1079
00:48:06,651 --> 00:48:09,230
What am I gonna tell my mom?

1080
00:48:09,254 --> 00:48:10,464
How am I gonna tell her what

1081
00:48:10,488 --> 00:48:13,434
I did?

1082
00:48:13,458 --> 00:48:14,368
What am I gonna...?

1083
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:15,203
Hey, hey.

1084
00:48:15,227 --> 00:48:16,370
It's okay, all right?

1085
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:20,241
It's okay.

1086
00:48:20,265 --> 00:48:21,475
Let's get back to Austin.

1087
00:48:21,499 --> 00:48:22,977
We'll just make everything

1088
00:48:23,001 --> 00:48:25,246
right, okay?

1089
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:26,580
Okay.

1090
00:48:26,604 --> 00:48:28,916
It's gonna be okay.

1091
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,575
Okay.

1092
00:49:40,678 --> 00:49:41,623
Stay indoors.

1093
00:49:41,647 --> 00:49:43,357
Fires raging throughout Houston

1094
00:49:43,381 --> 00:49:44,591
and surrounding areas.

1095
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:47,228
For the unbelievers, they

1096
00:49:47,252 --> 00:49:48,762
will never again have conscious

1097
00:49:48,786 --> 00:49:49,531
existence.

1098
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:12,779
Reba, I have to tell you

1099
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:13,714
something.

1100
00:51:13,738 --> 00:51:14,549
The...

1101
00:51:16,474 --> 00:51:19,153

1102
00:51:19,177 --> 00:51:20,187

Whoa.

1118
00:52:08,426 --> 00:52:10,404
You are just...

1119
00:52:10,428 --> 00:52:12,339
You go for it.

1120
00:52:12,363 --> 00:52:16,343
Hey, Amanda?

1121
00:52:17,435 --> 00:52:20,271
Amanda?

1122
00:52:23,441 --> 00:52:25,219
My god.

1123
00:52:25,243 --> 00:52:25,919
My god.

1124
00:52:25,943 --> 00:52:26,721
You made it!

1125
00:52:26,745 --> 00:52:28,389
I can't believe you're fucking

1126
00:52:28,413 --> 00:52:29,324
here right now.

1127
00:52:29,348 --> 00:52:30,824
You made it out of Los Angeles.

1128
00:52:30,848 --> 00:52:32,526
I can't believe you're standing

1129
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:32,894
here.

1130
00:52:32,918 --> 00:52:34,361
Maybe we should...

1131
00:52:34,385 --> 00:52:35,429
I mean, I was so worried.

1132
00:52:35,453 --> 00:52:36,364
Everyone's gone crazy.

1133
00:52:36,388 --> 00:52:37,431
Everyone went for the water.

1134
00:52:37,455 --> 00:52:38,765
I mean, there's, like, no water

1135
00:52:38,789 --> 00:52:40,334
left anywhere, and you know that

1136
00:52:40,358 --> 00:52:41,602
disaster preparation kit that

1137
00:52:41,626 --> 00:52:42,170
I have?

1138
00:52:42,194 --> 00:52:43,537
It lasted one day because I only

1139
00:52:43,561 --> 00:52:44,905
had five gallons in it, and that

1140
00:52:44,929 --> 00:52:46,373
lasts one day, and that's it.

1141
00:52:46,397 --> 00:52:47,774
We ran out of water, and so I

1142
00:52:47,798 --> 00:52:49,476
thought, "what are we gonna do?

1143
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,712
We're gonna drink beer."

1144
00:52:51,736 --> 00:52:54,215
Aren't I smart?

1145
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:54,948
Aren't I so smart?

1146
00:52:54,972 --> 00:52:55,850
You're smart.

1147
00:52:55,874 --> 00:52:57,851
What are you talking about?

1148
00:52:57,875 --> 00:52:59,586
I mean, they said like

1149
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:00,388
250,000.

1150
00:53:00,412 --> 00:53:01,922
But, baby, that's Houston.

1151
00:53:01,946 --> 00:53:05,292
I know!

1152
00:53:05,316 --> 00:53:07,761
Those poor fucking

1153
00:53:07,785 --> 00:53:08,795
people...

1154
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:11,198
Dying from all the radiation.

1155
00:53:11,222 --> 00:53:13,534
We started this fund, you know.

1156
00:53:13,558 --> 00:53:15,402
Wait. What... what?

1157
00:53:15,426 --> 00:53:17,738
Radiation?

1158
00:53:17,762 --> 00:53:18,739
What happened?

1159
00:53:18,763 --> 00:53:21,832
Was there an accident?

1160
00:53:27,372 --> 00:53:29,916
What...?

1161
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:33,920
You don't know.

1162
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:34,688
My god.

1163
00:53:34,712 --> 00:53:35,290
Reba...

1164
00:53:35,314 --> 00:53:37,791
There was a bomb.

1165
00:53:37,815 --> 00:53:39,360
What?

1166
00:53:39,384 --> 00:53:40,694
My heart is just breaking.

1167
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:41,795
Okay, Amanda, stop.

1168
00:53:41,819 --> 00:53:42,863
She doesn't know about

1169
00:53:42,887 --> 00:53:43,764
the bombs, okay?

1170
00:53:43,788 --> 00:53:44,732
Just stop talking.

1171
00:53:44,756 --> 00:53:45,966
It is not for you to tell,

1172
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:46,534
okay?!

1173
00:53:46,558 --> 00:53:48,269
Will someone please just tell

1174
00:53:48,293 --> 00:53:49,670
me what the fuck is going on?

1175
00:53:49,694 --> 00:53:50,737
One of the bombs went off

1176
00:53:50,761 --> 00:53:53,474
in Los Angeles.

1177
00:53:53,498 --> 00:53:53,975
My god.

1178
00:53:53,999 --> 00:53:55,242
You knew and you haven't even

1179
00:53:55,266 --> 00:53:55,710
told her yet?

1180
00:53:55,734 --> 00:53:56,877
Okay, we've been on the road,

1181
00:53:56,901 --> 00:53:57,811
and I just haven't had a

1182
00:53:57,835 --> 00:53:58,380
chance...

1183
00:53:58,404 --> 00:53:59,380
Wait, so you've been on

1184
00:53:59,404 --> 00:53:59,881
the road.

1185
00:53:59,905 --> 00:54:01,739
Stop it!

1186
00:54:07,612 --> 00:54:09,523
Well, how bad is it?

1187
00:54:09,547 --> 00:54:10,957
I-I mean, I'm sure it's not

1188
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:11,593
that...

1189
00:54:11,617 --> 00:54:13,760
It's a total loss.

1190
00:54:13,784 --> 00:54:15,262
Los Angeles is gone.

1191
00:54:15,286 --> 00:54:15,830
Hey.

1192
00:54:15,854 --> 00:54:17,864
But there has to be survivors.

1193
00:54:17,888 --> 00:54:19,600
No, it's pretty grim.

1194
00:54:19,624 --> 00:54:20,934
You guys are lucky.

1195
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:23,794
You made it out alive.

1196
00:54:27,298 --> 00:54:29,443
Reba...

1197
00:54:29,467 --> 00:54:34,439
I'm so, so sorry about your mom.

1198
00:54:37,508 --> 00:54:39,677
No.

1199
00:54:43,013 --> 00:54:44,782
No.

1200
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:52,699
You knew?

1201
00:54:52,723 --> 00:54:54,559
You...

1202
00:55:01,966 --> 00:55:04,945
Y-Yeah.

1203
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:05,979
Not really.

1204
00:55:06,003 --> 00:55:08,682
I didn't know...

1205
00:55:08,706 --> 00:55:09,750
I didn't know everything.

1206
00:55:09,774 --> 00:55:12,753
I, um...

1207
00:55:12,777 --> 00:55:14,355
I didn't know how to tell you.

1208
00:55:14,379 --> 00:55:15,622
I-I didn't want to hurt you.

1209
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:17,023
I just thought we could get here

1210
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:18,559
and everything would just work

1211
00:55:18,583 --> 00:55:19,593
out, you know, right?

1212
00:55:19,617 --> 00:55:21,828
What is wrong with you?

1213
00:55:21,852 --> 00:55:22,996
I'm really sorry.

1214
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,399
You're... you're sorry?

1215
00:55:25,423 --> 00:55:26,467
About what?

1216
00:55:27,625 --> 00:55:29,870
About not telling me that the

1217
00:55:29,894 --> 00:55:32,038
world is going crazy, or...

1218
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:34,599
Or... what, or that my...

1219
00:55:40,771 --> 00:55:43,684
Or that my... my mom is...?

1220
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:46,920
Hey, it's okay.

1221
00:55:46,944 --> 00:55:47,455
No.

1222
00:55:47,479 --> 00:55:48,655
We're safe and we're here,

1223
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:49,656
so that's a good thing.

1224
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:53,360
Why are we here?

1225
00:55:53,384 --> 00:55:56,062
Why are we here?

1226
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:57,364
Amanda, did you know that

1227
00:55:57,388 --> 00:55:58,565
Harriet didn't get into grad

1228
00:55:58,589 --> 00:55:59,100
school?

1229
00:55:59,124 --> 00:56:01,134
She just let everyone think that

1230
00:56:01,158 --> 00:56:01,936
she did.

1231
00:56:03,461 --> 00:56:04,771
What, you didn't think I knew?

1232
00:56:04,795 --> 00:56:06,072
You thought it was a lie that

1233
00:56:06,096 --> 00:56:07,374
you could keep from me?

1234
00:56:07,398 --> 00:56:08,642
They said I didn't get in

1235
00:56:08,666 --> 00:56:09,910
this semester, but they said

1236
00:56:09,934 --> 00:56:10,977
that if I reapplied...

1237
00:56:11,001 --> 00:56:12,713
Amanda, did you know that

1238
00:56:12,737 --> 00:56:14,114
your sister applied to a

1239
00:56:14,138 --> 00:56:15,882
make-believe grad school from

1240
00:56:15,906 --> 00:56:17,718
a mental institution where she

1241
00:56:17,742 --> 00:56:19,453
hung out for the last couple

1242
00:56:19,477 --> 00:56:20,987
of months after she tried to

1243
00:56:21,011 --> 00:56:22,856
kill herself?

1244
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,525
What?

1245
00:56:24,549 --> 00:56:25,559
Harriet, I didn't...

1246
00:56:25,583 --> 00:56:26,793
You couldn't even get that

1247
00:56:26,817 --> 00:56:29,496
right.

1248
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,831

moment is the most important

00:59:16,754 --> 00:59:18,131
time to not act without

1307
00:59:18,155 --> 00:59:19,966
information, to attack without

1308
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:21,101
certain knowledge.

1309
00:59:21,125 --> 00:59:22,102
Are you crazy?

1310
00:59:22,126 --> 00:59:23,837
We have been summarily attacked

1311
00:59:23,861 --> 00:59:25,205
by the enemy, millions are

1312
00:59:25,229 --> 00:59:26,807
dead, many more will die in

1313
00:59:26,831 --> 00:59:28,274
the next days, weeks, months.

1314
00:59:28,298 --> 00:59:29,710
We are at war.

1315
00:59:29,734 --> 00:59:30,877
What's your answer?

1316
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:32,178
Bomb the world until there's

1317
00:59:32,202 --> 00:59:33,680
nothing left?

1318
00:59:33,704 --> 00:59:35,348
They're scared of terrorists.

1319
00:59:35,372 --> 00:59:37,117
They're stopping everyone and

1320
00:59:37,141 --> 00:59:38,184
rounding them up.

1321
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:39,285
And I quote the

1322
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:40,320
prophet forest.

1323
00:59:40,344 --> 00:59:42,188
The offer of god's love is sent

1324
00:59:42,212 --> 00:59:43,957
forth into all the world, but

1325
00:59:43,981 --> 00:59:45,859
no man of his own volition will

1326
00:59:45,883 --> 00:59:48,786
respond.

1327
00:59:51,188 --> 00:59:55,902
Why is this happening?

1328
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:57,337
Do you... do you have, um,

1329
00:59:57,361 --> 00:59:58,905
a boyfriend or husband that

1330
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:00,006
maybe I should call?

1331
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:02,075
He's gone.

1332
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:04,144
I haven't talked to him.

1333
01:00:04,168 --> 01:00:08,014
I don't know where he is.

1334
01:00:08,038 --> 01:00:10,207
Sorry.

1335
01:00:13,744 --> 01:00:14,955
I can't go home.

1336
01:00:15,914 --> 01:00:17,658
I can't talk to my husband.

1337
01:00:17,682 --> 01:00:23,163
I can't call my doctor.

1338
01:00:23,187 --> 01:00:28,401

Yeah, China.

1430
01:10:04,269 --> 01:10:05,811
Probably not a good idea for a

1431

1453
01:11:11,535 --> 01:11:14,414

1455
01:11:18,609 --> 01:11:19,819
Why'd you shoot her?

1456
01:11:27,684 --> 01:11:29,362
My god, did you see that?

1457
01:11:29,386 --> 01:11:30,363
No, don't you see?

1458
01:11:30,387 --> 01:11:31,864
I-I'm exactly where I'm supposed

1459
01:11:31,888 --> 01:11:35,768
to be.

1460
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:36,737
Harriet.

1461
01:11:46,937 --> 01:11:47,947
God, you're bleeding.

1462
01:11:47,971 --> 01:11:48,681
You're bleeding.

1463
01:11:48,705 --> 01:11:49,615
I don't know what to do.

1464
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:50,083
It's okay.

1465
01:11:50,107 --> 01:11:51,351
You need to stop the bleeding,

1466
01:11:51,375 --> 01:11:51,651
okay?

1467
01:11:51,675 --> 01:11:52,353
No, I can't

1468
01:11:52,377 --> 01:11:53,453

1469
01:11:53,477 --> 01:11:54,054
to apply pressure.

1470
01:11:54,078 --> 01:11:55,321

1471
01:11:55,345 --> 01:11:55,656
through.

1472
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:56,756
You need to stop the bleeding.

1473
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:57,358
I can't.

1474
01:11:57,382 --> 01:11:58,391
You need to take off your

1475
01:11:58,415 --> 01:11:58,692
shirt.

1476
01:11:58,716 --> 01:11:59,725
Yes, you can. You can do it.

1477
01:11:59,749 --> 01:12:00,393
You can do it.

1478
01:12:00,417 --> 01:12:01,361
You just need to stop the

01:12:01,385 --> 01:12:01,727
bleeding.

1480
01:12:01,751 --> 01:12:02,495
No.

1481

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1486
01:12:13,096 --> 01:12:14,507
You were chasing me.

1487
01:12:14,531 --> 01:12:16,041

You never chase.

My god.

1490
01:12:25,509 --> 01:12:26,052
Okay.

1491
01:12:26,076 --> 01:12:27,887
I know exactly what to do.

1492
01:12:30,013 --> 01:12:31,457
615 is medical books.

1493
01:12:31,481 --> 01:12:32,892

1495
01:12:33,983 --> 01:12:35,127

1496

1497
01:12:36,386 --> 01:12:37,397

1498

books.

1499
01:12:37,722 --> 01:12:38,731
You need to keep my torso

1500
01:12:38,755 --> 01:12:39,098
elevated.

1501
01:12:39,122 --> 01:12:39,666
Okay.

1502
01:12:39,690 --> 01:12:41,367
So go get some pillows.

1503
01:12:41,391 --> 01:12:42,402
All right. Okay.

1504
01:12:42,426 --> 01:12:43,503
Okay. You're all right.

up.

1508
01:12:48,798 --> 01:12:50,776
I-i-I'm sorry I made things

1509
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,111
harder for you.

1510
01:12:56,006 --> 01:12:57,617
Please don't leave me, okay?

1511
01:12:57,641 --> 01:12:58,485
Yeah.

1512
01:12:58,509 --> 01:13:00,019
