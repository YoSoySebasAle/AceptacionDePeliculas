00:02:46,597 --> 00:02:52,559
<i>The storm that's been battering
Puerto Rico is heading for Miami.</i>

2
00:02:52,644 --> 00:02:57,184
<i>It's packing winds of 90 miles an hour,
so batten down the hatches, South Florida.</i>

3
00:02:57,274 --> 00:03:00,187
<i>It looks like the mean season
is finally here.</i>

4
00:03:00,277 --> 00:03:05,989
<i>Coach Don Shula welcomed a new crowd
of rookies to the Miami Dolphins' training camp.</i>

5
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,710
- Hi, Mal. How's it going?
- Hey, Jack.

6
00:03:18,796 --> 00:03:21,834
- Hey, welcome back.
- How are you doing, Jim?

7
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,508
Porter, how's it going?

8
00:03:26,637 --> 00:03:29,721
I thought you weren't coming back
until Monday.

9
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,104
I don't think
I'm coming back at all.

10
00:03:42,528 --> 00:03:45,396
Saul, how are you doing?
Mary Lou...

11
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:47,025
- Hi.
- Hi.

12
00:03:58,544 --> 00:04:01,628
- Aren't you gonna say anything?
- I don't want to intrude.

13
00:04:01,713 --> 00:04:03,875
You look terrible.

14
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:08,669
- What are you hacking on?
- A man's pet ocelot mauled his wife.

15
00:04:08,762 --> 00:04:10,253
Sounds good.

16
00:04:11,431 --> 00:04:13,172
Lose something?

17
00:04:13,684 --> 00:04:18,099
A little enthusiasm,
ambition, drive...

18
00:04:18,897 --> 00:04:23,141
Time, mostly. It's a brown, little book.
You know where it is.

19
00:04:23,235 --> 00:04:25,898
- I do not.
- He's leaving again.

20
00:04:25,988 --> 00:04:31,325
- Oh, he liked Colorado.
- I loved it, especially their news.

21
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,869
Terrific.
Nola's finally gonna know how good I am.

22
00:04:34,955 --> 00:04:37,368
That's why I want to quit, Kathy.
Here it is.

23
00:04:37,457 --> 00:04:39,665
- How busy are you?
- Just the man I wanna see.

24
00:04:39,751 --> 00:04:42,038
They found a body shot in the head
over on Baggs Beach.

25
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:43,231
- Not interested.
- He doesn't work today.

26
00:04:43,255 --> 00:04:45,463
- I can tell him, Kathy.
- This could be good.

27
00:04:45,549 --> 00:04:47,506
Try and get out there
while it's still news.

28
00:04:47,593 --> 00:04:50,506
I just got off an aeroplane.
Give it to her. I don't want it.

29
00:04:50,596 --> 00:04:53,555
She's only been
out of school three weeks.

30
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,176
- Three years!
- You don't listen.

31
00:04:55,267 --> 00:04:57,725
- Look, I'm busy.
- I think I'm burned out.

32
00:04:57,811 --> 00:05:00,519
- You're just in a slump.
- It's more than that.

33
00:05:00,606 --> 00:05:02,598
- Is that the weekender piece?
- Yes.

34
00:05:02,691 --> 00:05:06,184
Save it. The storm off Puerto Rico
got upgraded to hurricane.

35
00:05:06,278 --> 00:05:08,941
- Her name's Annie. Get to know her.
- Bill, can I have a minute?

36
00:05:09,031 --> 00:05:12,991
I don't have a minute.
I'll have one later. Here.

37
00:05:14,203 --> 00:05:16,365
- Later.
- I can count on it?

38
00:05:16,455 --> 00:05:20,870
- Hey... Porter's going with you.
- Okay, Bill.

39
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,919
Try and get some good stills
this time, Andy.

40
00:05:30,344 --> 00:05:35,590
- When will you have something, Doc?
- Tuesday, probably.

41
00:05:35,682 --> 00:05:40,473
- Softball game on Sunday. Do you wanna play?
- I don't know. I just got back.

42
00:05:40,562 --> 00:05:43,430
- What's the story?
- Come here.

43
00:05:43,523 --> 00:05:45,185
- How was the trip?
- Not bad.

44
00:05:45,275 --> 00:05:48,018
- I see crime here hasn't improved.
- I hear that.

45
00:05:48,111 --> 00:05:50,899
Jesus, she's just a kid.
Was she raped?

46
00:05:50,989 --> 00:05:52,855
Had all her clothes on.

47
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,784
- Doc, any action?
- Not likely.

48
00:05:56,536 --> 00:06:01,748
- Where's that jogger? Is he the guy to talk to?
- Yeah, Ben Hogan over there.

49
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,811
- Hi, Malcolm Anderson, the "Journal".
- How are you?

50
00:06:03,835 --> 00:06:06,418
You run by here every day?

51
00:06:06,505 --> 00:06:08,792
A couple of times a week.

52
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:13,668
You must really have
sharp eyes...

53
00:06:13,762 --> 00:06:19,008
No, I was running along the beach,
and I just walked up through here...

54
00:06:19,101 --> 00:06:21,263
I almost stepped on her.

55
00:06:21,353 --> 00:06:25,472
If some kid found this, it really could
have messed him up for a couple of years.

56
00:06:25,565 --> 00:06:28,399
- Don't you think?
- Talk to you later.

57
00:06:28,986 --> 00:06:31,774
Yeah, I thought about that.
I've got a couple of kids.

58
00:06:31,863 --> 00:06:37,404
- I need to get your name.
- I'd rather not. I don't want to get involved.

59
00:06:37,494 --> 00:06:40,487
- No problem. Thanks a lot.
- Sure.

60
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,871
- Take it easy, Ray.
- Okay.

61
00:07:08,942 --> 00:07:12,811
Nothing like blood, shit and hot weather
to bring out the flies.

62
00:07:12,904 --> 00:07:15,362
One day,
I'll catch you in a bad mood.

63
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:17,315
That's not good for your health.

64
00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:21,278
- Give it a rest.
- Is this the girl's father?

65
00:07:21,371 --> 00:07:23,078
Mr. Hooks?

66
00:07:23,665 --> 00:07:26,533
Mr. Hooks.
The blue car, sir.

67
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:33,086
- Are you taking him down to make the ID?
- Yeah, the mother's not up to it.

68
00:07:35,886 --> 00:07:37,798
Can I talk to her?

69
00:07:41,224 --> 00:07:42,590
Come here.

70
00:07:43,935 --> 00:07:48,555
Mrs. Hooks? This is Malcolm Anderson
from the "Journal".

71
00:07:48,648 --> 00:07:49,523
How do you do?

72
00:07:49,524 --> 00:07:52,813
I don't think he minds staying
until your husband calls.

73
00:07:52,903 --> 00:07:54,860
- Is that all right?
- Yes.

74
00:07:54,946 --> 00:07:58,656
- I think it'll be a good idea.
- Thanks, Ray.

75
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:15,249
- I have the feeling Sarah's popular.
- She is.

76
00:08:21,306 --> 00:08:24,094
I don't know
what Sarah's gonna want to do.

77
00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:27,685
She'll find something
when she's in high school.

78
00:08:30,273 --> 00:08:33,516
- This is her.
- She really is very pretty.

79
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,023
You must be proud of her.

80
00:08:43,203 --> 00:08:46,696
And that's all we have now.

81
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:59,796
Excuse me.

82
00:09:12,441 --> 00:09:14,558
Hello?

83
00:10:18,381 --> 00:10:21,089
I've been working behind you
at my terminal.

84
00:10:21,176 --> 00:10:23,919
It's good.
It's really good.

85
00:10:24,554 --> 00:10:26,511
It needs an ending, though.

86
00:10:26,598 --> 00:10:31,889
"The tragic vision of Mrs. Hooks,
where snapshots lay..."

87
00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:38,183
- Did you get one of those snapshots? Mal?
- No.

88
00:10:38,276 --> 00:10:40,814
You're kidding me, right?

89
00:10:40,904 --> 00:10:43,487
I didn't think it was necessary.

90
00:10:43,573 --> 00:10:47,317
The whole story works
because of the snapshots.

91
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,151
Sorry.

92
00:10:51,498 --> 00:10:53,706
Okay. There.

93
00:10:55,418 --> 00:10:57,000
Better.

94
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,510
Andy, thank you.
Run it right down, willya?

95
00:11:07,597 --> 00:11:11,591
Do you think this will hold
your interest for a while?

96
00:11:12,644 --> 00:11:17,184
- Okay?
- No. You forgot your name again.

97
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,852
Only five minutes late.

98
00:12:01,526 --> 00:12:04,644
It's not that hard
once you get the hang of it.

99
00:12:04,738 --> 00:12:06,479
You'll see.

100
00:12:08,533 --> 00:12:11,526
All right, that's it for the day.

101
00:12:20,754 --> 00:12:23,246
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

102
00:12:31,306 --> 00:12:32,638
Hello.

103
00:12:33,475 --> 00:12:34,475
Hi.

104
00:12:38,229 --> 00:12:43,691
- Shouldn't you be running across the room?
- If I tripped and fell, I'd be humiliated.

105
00:12:43,777 --> 00:12:46,315
And I'd be hysterical.

106
00:12:50,784 --> 00:12:55,154
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

107
00:13:01,503 --> 00:13:03,711
When did you get in?

108
00:13:03,797 --> 00:13:06,710
Early. I took the red-eye.

109
00:13:07,592 --> 00:13:10,050
- And you went right by the paper.
- To quit.

110
00:13:10,136 --> 00:13:12,628
- But you didn't.
- The timing wasn't right.

111
00:13:12,722 --> 00:13:15,965
- I'm working on it, though.
- You could've called.

112
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:20,645
- I was still home.
- I wanted to get at Nolan right away.

113
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,770
- I'd like to hear about that.
- In a minute.

114
00:13:27,904 --> 00:13:29,941
Your mum...

115
00:13:39,582 --> 00:13:43,542
- Are you sure you don't have doubts?
- What gives you that idea?

116
00:13:43,628 --> 00:13:46,917
I just want you to be sure
about Colorado.

117
00:13:48,216 --> 00:13:53,678
Running the "Greeley Tribune" will never be
like a job at "The New York Times".

118
00:13:53,763 --> 00:13:57,723
I told you I like the town
and the paper.

119
00:13:57,809 --> 00:14:00,096
I even like your parents.

120
00:14:01,813 --> 00:14:06,808
- You didn't tell Nolan you're quitting.
- I had to go cover that murder.

121
00:14:06,901 --> 00:14:09,735
I'll tell him in the morning.
As soon as I walk in the door.

122
00:14:09,821 --> 00:14:12,234
- Really?
- I promise.

123
00:14:33,011 --> 00:14:36,880
It's good work, Mal.
The competition didn't do so well.

124
00:14:36,973 --> 00:14:39,340
Thought about a follow-up?

125
00:14:41,352 --> 00:14:42,718
Yeah.

126
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:51,694
"Fear stalks quiet neighborhood
in wake of teenager's murder."

127
00:14:53,573 --> 00:14:57,943
You haven't been at this long enough
to be as burned out as you think.

128
00:14:58,036 --> 00:15:01,575
I've done it, Bill.
Eight years, I've done it to death.

129
00:15:01,664 --> 00:15:03,951
What the hell does that mean?

130
00:15:06,377 --> 00:15:08,585
What do you want?

131
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:11,955
I don't know.

132
00:15:16,721 --> 00:15:19,384
I used to want Watergate, right?

133
00:15:25,563 --> 00:15:30,228
I don't want my name in the paper
next to pictures of dead bodies any more.

134
00:15:31,569 --> 00:15:34,061
Reporters report...

135
00:15:34,155 --> 00:15:38,320
...which happens to be the one thing
you do really well.

136
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:43,120
I don't want to lose you
to some small-town paper in Colorado.

137
00:15:43,206 --> 00:15:45,823
I appreciate it, Bill.

138
00:15:45,917 --> 00:15:49,581
We're not the manufacturer,
we retail.

139
00:15:49,671 --> 00:15:53,381
News get made somewhere else,
we just sell it.

140
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:32,165
Malcolm?

141
00:16:50,231 --> 00:16:51,893
Honey, wait. Honey...

142
00:16:57,322 --> 00:16:59,063
Wait...

143
00:16:59,949 --> 00:17:04,489
I'm glad you stopped by.
I wanted to talk to you.

144
00:17:05,705 --> 00:17:10,166
Honey, did you get
my other suit out of the cleaners?

145
00:17:11,794 --> 00:17:14,878
Would you listen to me?
I'm serious.

146
00:17:19,344 --> 00:17:20,676
All right.

147
00:17:22,722 --> 00:17:25,089
Is this serious? What?

148
00:17:26,434 --> 00:17:28,300
If we're really gonna move...

149
00:17:28,394 --> 00:17:32,354
...I've gotta tell the school
so they can plan for September.

150
00:17:32,982 --> 00:17:34,644
Tell them.

151
00:17:36,819 --> 00:17:38,310
Really?

152
00:17:39,697 --> 00:17:41,233
Really.

153
00:17:47,205 --> 00:17:49,447
You should be slapped.

154
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:54,581
- You shouldn't scare me like that. I hate that.
- God, what a day.

155
00:18:05,056 --> 00:18:07,469
- Bill, I want to talk to you.
- Malcolm, telephone.

156
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:11,518
- Tell him I'll call him right back.
- I'm not your secretary.

157
00:18:11,604 --> 00:18:13,971
- Five seconds?
- I'll be there.

158
00:18:22,448 --> 00:18:25,065
- Anderson.
<i>- Hello.</i>

159
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:26,741
Yeah, hello.

160
00:18:29,288 --> 00:18:35,250
Listen, I've been reading your stories
about the murder of the young girl.

161
00:18:35,336 --> 00:18:40,377
Well written.
They seem very accurate.

162
00:18:40,466 --> 00:18:45,586
I appreciate the call,
and I am kind of busy right now.

163
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:50,766
<i>- I have a special interest in your stories.</i>
- Why is that?

164
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:55,137
Because it was me.
I killed her.

165
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,937
Who is this?

166
00:19:00,903 --> 00:19:04,487
You don't expect me to answer that,
do you?

167
00:19:04,574 --> 00:19:06,315
It depends on why you called.

168
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:10,403
<i>I get 30 calls every day,
people claiming responsibility for anything.</i>

169
00:19:10,496 --> 00:19:16,709
<i>- What makes you so different?</i>
- I called because I want to help you.

170
00:19:17,795 --> 00:19:20,128
<i>How could you help me?</i>

171
00:19:21,716 --> 00:19:26,051
- Her right, rear pocket.
- Was there something in it?

172
00:19:26,137 --> 00:19:30,222
<i>I hope you're as bright
as I assumed you were.</i>

173
00:19:32,393 --> 00:19:34,134
Listen...

174
00:19:34,228 --> 00:19:38,142
Can you be at your phone
at 3.00?

175
00:19:41,486 --> 00:19:43,102
Hello?

176
00:20:18,272 --> 00:20:19,808
Hey, Ray.

177
00:20:20,566 --> 00:20:23,229
So you guys
decided to hold out on me?

178
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:27,984
What do you want, Mal?
We've got a court appearance. Make it fast.

179
00:20:28,074 --> 00:20:30,908
Did you look through her clothes?
What did you find?

180
00:20:30,993 --> 00:20:32,404
None of your fucking business.

181
00:20:32,495 --> 00:20:35,784
I thought you'd find something
in her right, rear pocket.

182
00:20:35,873 --> 00:20:38,661
We did. Lint.

183
00:20:38,751 --> 00:20:40,413
Take it easy.

184
00:20:41,212 --> 00:20:44,046
Wait a second.
Malcolm, hold on.

185
00:20:44,715 --> 00:20:48,334
- How do you know?
- He called me.

186
00:20:48,427 --> 00:20:50,760
- Who called you?
- The killer.

187
00:20:51,556 --> 00:20:54,094
Shit... Come here.

188
00:20:57,019 --> 00:21:01,104
- He says the killer called him.
- Bullshit.

189
00:21:01,732 --> 00:21:05,191
- What did he say? What did he sound like?
- He said he left something in her pocket.

190
00:21:05,278 --> 00:21:08,316
He didn't sound like anything,
could've been the Red Cross.

191
00:21:08,406 --> 00:21:13,401
- Was he white, black, oriental?
- White, probably. Over 30.

192
00:21:13,494 --> 00:21:16,237
Did he say
he was gonna call again?

193
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,413
What did you find?

194
00:21:20,877 --> 00:21:22,539
- No.
- Take it easy.

195
00:21:22,628 --> 00:21:24,164
Hold on.

196
00:21:24,714 --> 00:21:26,501
- We've gotta tell him what we've got.
- No.

197
00:21:26,591 --> 00:21:28,878
- What do you mean, no?
- He'll just stir it up.

198
00:21:28,968 --> 00:21:32,882
He's got no reason to lie to us.
We'll be okay.

199
00:21:34,932 --> 00:21:37,595
- This is not for publication.
- You know me better than that.

200
00:21:37,685 --> 00:21:40,348
I just want to know
what we're talking about.

201
00:21:42,148 --> 00:21:43,935
It was a note.

202
00:21:44,025 --> 00:21:47,018
- What did it say?
- Raymond...!

203
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:53,194
"Number one".
Don't go crazy on this.

204
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,118
If this is the same guy,
you're gonna want to talk to me.

205
00:21:57,205 --> 00:21:59,492
Now wait a second!
What do you got for us?

206
00:21:59,582 --> 00:22:01,342
- I haven't got anything.
- What do you mean?

207
00:22:01,417 --> 00:22:06,754
- Give me a call when you get outta here.
- Just don't jump to any conclusions, Mal!

208
00:22:25,399 --> 00:22:29,313
- Come on, guys.
- Doesn't anybody have anything better to do?

209
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,996
Anderson.

210
00:22:49,507 --> 00:22:51,874
<i>Afraid I wouldn't call?</i>

211
00:22:52,385 --> 00:22:55,128
- I wasn't certain.
- Certainty, I have learned...

212
00:22:55,221 --> 00:22:58,885
...is something the world
is in very short supply of.

213
00:22:58,975 --> 00:23:02,810
- Did you call and talk to the police?
<i>- Yes.</i>

214
00:23:02,895 --> 00:23:05,262
What did they say?

215
00:23:05,815 --> 00:23:09,399
There was something in her pocket.
Suppose you tell me what it was.

216
00:23:09,485 --> 00:23:12,193
<i>A true skeptic.</i>

217
00:23:13,197 --> 00:23:17,532
<i>Notepaper, folded once.
Two words.</i>

218
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,197
<i>"Number one".</i>

219
00:23:22,498 --> 00:23:27,584
- There's going to be a number two?
- And a three, a four and a five.

220
00:23:29,171 --> 00:23:31,834
- Why?
- It's too early for that.

221
00:23:35,136 --> 00:23:38,504
You're doing this
on some kind of schedule?

222
00:23:38,597 --> 00:23:41,385
Something along those lines.

223
00:23:41,892 --> 00:23:46,683
- And you already know who they are?
- I know what they are.

224
00:23:47,982 --> 00:23:49,723
Three women and two men.

225
00:23:54,113 --> 00:23:58,858
- I just might not print this.
- Then you'll miss a wonderful opportunity.

226
00:23:58,951 --> 00:24:01,910
<i>I'll call someone else.</i>

227
00:24:03,247 --> 00:24:08,618
Look, you're going to be
my conduit to the public.

228
00:24:10,838 --> 00:24:13,546
- Tell me about it.
- Look, that's all for now.

229
00:24:13,632 --> 00:24:16,420
We'll talk again
after number two.

230
00:24:24,602 --> 00:24:28,972
This is the one you've been waiting for, Mal.
Fabulous.

231
00:24:30,107 --> 00:24:34,272
I'm not sure this story
will do us or anybody else any good.

232
00:24:34,362 --> 00:24:38,026
Unfortunately, there's no way
of seeing where this thing could go.

233
00:24:38,115 --> 00:24:41,358
It could take some kind of twist
and we could look negligent.

234
00:24:41,452 --> 00:24:47,289
- The chance of liability?
- He didn't call the paper. He called me.

235
00:24:49,668 --> 00:24:52,206
We have a chance here,
let alone the obligation...

236
00:24:52,296 --> 00:24:57,007
...to do a piece on a sociopath
who's still out there. He's still a threat.

237
00:24:57,093 --> 00:25:01,258
That's our responsibility,
isn't it?

238
00:25:01,347 --> 00:25:05,933
This story is gonna sell
a hell of a lot of newspapers for somebody.

239
00:25:09,146 --> 00:25:13,481
Legally, how far
could our asses be hanging out?

240
00:25:14,652 --> 00:25:19,898
- Did you tell him you'd protect his identity?
- No.

241
00:25:20,616 --> 00:25:24,610
- Did you imply that it was off the record?
- No.

242
00:25:24,703 --> 00:25:26,990
Make them comfortable.

243
00:25:27,998 --> 00:25:32,743
- We have three impatient cops outside.
- Lovely.

244
00:25:32,837 --> 00:25:36,831
- Can we go talk to them?
- I think we'd better.

245
00:25:36,924 --> 00:25:38,506
Thank you.

246
00:25:41,262 --> 00:25:43,629
- How many times has he called?
- Twice.

247
00:25:43,722 --> 00:25:46,965
We want a statement from Anderson
and to look at his notes.

248
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:49,426
You know better than that.
No notes.

249
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,855
We've got a guy who's gonna kill someone.
We'd like your cooperation.

250
00:25:53,941 --> 00:25:57,651
But if we have to,
we'll get a subpoena.

251
00:25:57,736 --> 00:26:00,549
- What happened to freedom of the press?
- You're abusing the privilege.

252
00:26:00,573 --> 00:26:01,967
- That's your opinion.
- That's a fact.

253
00:26:01,991 --> 00:26:05,075
If we don't write about these guys,
you never get them.

254
00:26:05,161 --> 00:26:07,153
We'll take care of our end.

255
00:26:07,246 --> 00:26:11,581
You know we can't be required
to turn over the notes.

256
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:13,158
No, I'll tell you what I know.

257
00:26:13,252 --> 00:26:17,121
If this son of a bitch kills somebody else,
I'll tell the "Post"...

258
00:26:17,214 --> 00:26:19,706
...that you held back information
that could've prevented it.

259
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,463
We didn't say
we weren't going to cooperate.

260
00:26:22,553 --> 00:26:25,671
We want an arrangement
we can all live with.

261
00:26:25,764 --> 00:26:29,474
- How about a tap on Anderson's phone?
- You won't need it.

262
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,973
- We'll give you the tapes.
- Okay.

263
00:26:32,062 --> 00:26:34,054
So, what's the deal here?

264
00:26:34,148 --> 00:26:39,189
You give us whatever you get 24 hours
before the other newspapers and TV stations.

265
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:42,567
No, we've got relationships to maintain.
Six hours.

266
00:26:42,656 --> 00:26:43,737
- 18.
- 10.

267
00:26:43,824 --> 00:26:45,440
Sold.

268
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,642
<i>I just might not print this.</i>

269
00:27:20,736 --> 00:27:26,198
<i>Then you will be missing a wonderful
opportunity. I'll call someone else.</i>

270
00:27:26,283 --> 00:27:32,405
<i>Look, you're going to be
my conduit to the public.</i>

271
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:38,828
There must be some kind of profile here, Doc.
We need something to narrow this guy down.

272
00:27:38,921 --> 00:27:41,504
I'm not a mind-reader,
I'm a shrink.

273
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:45,425
I can't tell anything from one short,
taped conversation.

274
00:27:45,511 --> 00:27:52,511
But isn't there something Anderson could do
to keep him talking longer, draw him out?

275
00:27:55,187 --> 00:27:58,726
I think you're doing
the right things intuitively.

276
00:27:58,816 --> 00:28:03,356
Listen to him.
When he's unclear, ask questions.

277
00:28:03,445 --> 00:28:09,863
I wouldn't be judgmental, and I wouldn't
push him into giving more than he wants to give.

278
00:28:09,952 --> 00:28:11,784
Be patient.

279
00:28:12,329 --> 00:28:14,366
Be a friend.

280
00:28:38,188 --> 00:28:41,101
- What are you guys doing here?
- Give us a break.

281
00:28:41,191 --> 00:28:45,982
- The man you talked to, the killer...
- Did he say when he'd call next?

282
00:28:51,035 --> 00:28:53,652
He didn't say anything
that would narrow it down, guys.

283
00:28:53,746 --> 00:28:58,958
- How long did you talk to him?
- 10 Minutes? How long was it?

284
00:28:59,043 --> 00:29:01,896
- How long was the conversation?
- Neither one was more than a few minutes.

285
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,209
Come on, guys,
everything I know is in the paper.

286
00:29:11,805 --> 00:29:14,718
Are you gonna be able
to live with yourself?

287
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:18,226
Did he say
when he'd call next?

288
00:29:28,697 --> 00:29:32,031
<i>Malcolm Anderson, a journalist
with the "Miami Journal"...</i>

289
00:29:32,117 --> 00:29:35,827
<i>...is the only one to have
been contacted by the killer of Sarah Hooks...</i>

290
00:29:35,913 --> 00:29:38,576
<i>...the young girl found murdered
on Bill Baggs Beach.</i>

291
00:29:38,666 --> 00:29:43,661
<i>Anderson has been contacted twice,
and each of the two conversations were brief...</i>

292
00:29:43,754 --> 00:29:45,370
<i>...lasting only a minute or two.</i>

293
00:29:45,464 --> 00:29:50,255
<i>It is known for sure that he has established
a definite contact with Anderson...</i>

294
00:29:50,344 --> 00:29:53,382
<i>...for reasons that no one
has been able to determine.</i>

295
00:29:53,472 --> 00:29:56,681
<i>Malcolm Anderson seemed reticent
to talk to reporters...</i>

296
00:29:56,767 --> 00:30:00,727
<i>...apparently confused by
all the media attention.</i>

297
00:30:00,813 --> 00:30:02,679
<i>According to
Mr. Anderson's story...</i>

298
00:30:02,773 --> 00:30:06,892
<i>...neither he nor the public
has heard the last of this individual.</i>

299
00:30:06,985 --> 00:30:11,195
<i>Although "News Center 7" went to
great lengths to get him to elaborate...</i>

300
00:30:11,281 --> 00:30:14,570
- I'd like to see what you guys would have said.
<i>- ...he refused to say more.</i>

301
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,902
<i>I'm Jill Beach, "News Center 7".</i>

302
00:30:55,367 --> 00:31:00,908
I'm sorry, honey. Were you awake?
We stopped by for a beer.

303
00:31:04,042 --> 00:31:07,831
- I'm sorry, honey.
- I saw you on the television.

304
00:31:07,921 --> 00:31:09,378
Did you?

305
00:31:10,758 --> 00:31:12,920
What did you think?

306
00:31:13,469 --> 00:31:18,305
I looked like a jerk, didn't I?
I just looked like such a frump!

307
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:22,304
Let's talk about obnoxious.
Did you believe those guys?

308
00:31:22,394 --> 00:31:25,057
I mean, these are my friends!

309
00:31:25,814 --> 00:31:29,478
When you're on "60 Minutes"
do you mind giving me a call?

310
00:31:29,568 --> 00:31:34,814
- I'd like to bring the machine home and tape it.
- You think I ought to do that show.

311
00:31:34,907 --> 00:31:37,024
Why not?
Give 'em a break.

312
00:31:37,117 --> 00:31:41,862
Call Morley in the morning.
I mean, call morning in the Morley.

313
00:31:41,955 --> 00:31:43,867
Come on.

314
00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:50,878
- Honey, will you turn off the television?
- I hated the way I looked.

315
00:31:50,964 --> 00:31:53,331
Honey, the television.

316
00:31:57,429 --> 00:31:59,466
Who moved this thing?

317
00:32:02,518 --> 00:32:04,225
Baby...

318
00:32:07,481 --> 00:32:10,895
You're bad. One beer...

319
00:32:39,012 --> 00:32:42,005
- Anderson.
<i>- Sorry to bother you.</i>

320
00:32:42,099 --> 00:32:46,013
- That's okay.
<i>- I just called to say I love you.</i>

321
00:32:46,728 --> 00:32:48,720
I love you, too.

322
00:32:49,231 --> 00:32:51,097
<i>Bye.</i>

323
00:33:07,958 --> 00:33:11,702
- Anderson.
<i>- How can I love a small-town newspaper man?</i>

324
00:33:26,018 --> 00:33:30,888
What? Christine, honey,
I can't keep this line tied up.

325
00:33:30,981 --> 00:33:34,770
<i>Who's Christine?
Your wife or your girlfriend?</i>

326
00:33:36,445 --> 00:33:39,062
<i>I tested your faith,
didn't I?</i>

327
00:33:39,156 --> 00:33:42,649
You were beginning to worry
that I wasn't going to call you again.

328
00:33:42,743 --> 00:33:44,860
Was that the idea?

329
00:33:44,953 --> 00:33:48,412
It would be nice
if you wanted to talk to me.

330
00:33:48,498 --> 00:33:54,961
But still, your words are the important thing.
And I do like them.

331
00:33:56,048 --> 00:33:57,129
Thank you.

332
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:01,463
Ever tried to describe a smell?

333
00:34:03,055 --> 00:34:04,055
Why?

334
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:11,769
You're gonna smell something
that's gonna test your writing abilities.

335
00:34:11,855 --> 00:34:13,687
It has a sweetness to it...

336
00:34:13,774 --> 00:34:19,691
<i>...and at the same time it reaches into
your body and twists your insides.</i>

337
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,817
<i>But the odd thing is...</i>

338
00:34:21,907 --> 00:34:26,868
<i>...that once you smell it,
you know what it is without having to look.</i>

339
00:34:26,954 --> 00:34:32,200
<i>651 Nautilus. Got that?</i>

340
00:34:32,292 --> 00:34:36,286
If you're gonna get sick,
get sick out here. Got it?

341
00:35:04,992 --> 00:35:09,783
I'd be careful with this guy.
He knows as much about you as you do him.

342
00:35:28,056 --> 00:35:29,718
Malcolm!

343
00:35:39,568 --> 00:35:41,480
One at a time.
One at a time.

344
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:43,106
- Did you talk to the killer?
- Yes.

345
00:35:43,196 --> 00:35:47,987
- What did he say?
- I've got a deadline, just like you do.

346
00:35:48,076 --> 00:35:52,616
Everything I know
will be in tomorrow's "Journal".

347
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,168
Getting better.

348
00:36:20,525 --> 00:36:26,066
- Is your fan mail personal?
- No, but it sure is nice to get some.

349
00:36:29,659 --> 00:36:31,150
Hi.

350
00:36:31,995 --> 00:36:33,702
Hello?

351
00:36:33,789 --> 00:36:36,031
<i>Surprise.</i>

352
00:36:38,877 --> 00:36:41,711
How did you get
my home phone number?

353
00:36:41,797 --> 00:36:45,791
Your phone's not listed,
but Christine Connelly's is.

354
00:36:45,884 --> 00:36:48,922
I got her name
out of your mailbox.

355
00:36:52,933 --> 00:36:57,928
There's a policeman outside my door.
There's gonna be one there 24 hours a day.

356
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:04,021
If I wanted you or your girlfriend,
it'd be so easy.

357
00:37:04,111 --> 00:37:05,943
Don't worry, Malcolm.

358
00:37:06,905 --> 00:37:09,613
I'm supposed to trust you?
You're out of your mind.

359
00:37:09,699 --> 00:37:13,864
Without you, I'm nowhere.

360
00:37:13,954 --> 00:37:16,662
Back to square one.

361
00:37:17,374 --> 00:37:22,961
<i>Besides, we work well together.
I don't want to lose that.</i>

362
00:37:24,047 --> 00:37:25,504
What did you call about?

363
00:37:27,259 --> 00:37:31,924
I have two needs, Malcolm.
The need to talk...

364
00:37:33,014 --> 00:37:35,176
...and the other one...

365
00:37:38,228 --> 00:37:39,844
And...

366
00:37:41,982 --> 00:37:46,977
...it's a lot easier to find a victim
than it is a listener.

367
00:37:49,698 --> 00:37:51,906
What about friends?

368
00:37:54,619 --> 00:37:59,239
I had one friend,
until the plant closed.

369
00:37:59,332 --> 00:38:01,699
What plant was that?

370
00:38:02,586 --> 00:38:05,579
<i>An auto plant in Detroit.</i>

371
00:38:06,339 --> 00:38:12,085
<i>A machine took his hand.
It took three fingers clean off.</i>

372
00:38:13,013 --> 00:38:18,350
That's really awful.
You and he keep in touch?

373
00:38:18,435 --> 00:38:22,304
Oh, Malcolm,
you're so transparent.

374
00:38:24,274 --> 00:38:27,142
I'm just doing my job.
You're the story.

375
00:38:27,235 --> 00:38:33,027
You're trying to make a connection
to someone who can lead the cops to me.

376
00:38:33,116 --> 00:38:38,908
We're friends,
but we're not really friends.

377
00:38:42,584 --> 00:38:45,497
I want to talk about
the old people now.

378
00:38:45,587 --> 00:38:47,874
All right,
why'd you pick them?

379
00:38:47,964 --> 00:38:53,084
<i>They were a match,
a reasonable duplication.</i>

380
00:38:53,178 --> 00:38:57,468
- Was it something you've heard or read about?
<i>- It was just like before.</i>

381
00:38:59,434 --> 00:39:02,302
<i>I caught them on their porch.</i>

382
00:39:02,395 --> 00:39:04,808
I just stared.

383
00:39:06,566 --> 00:39:11,436
And you know,
they couldn't move.

384
00:39:11,529 --> 00:39:16,820
Then, when the gun came out,
they couldn't even speak.

385
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:21,575
Fascinating, isn't it, Malcolm?

386
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:28,578
<i>I got them into the dining room.</i>

387
00:39:28,672 --> 00:39:32,962
<i>I put a pillow
in front of the gun.</i>

388
00:39:33,843 --> 00:39:37,883
Even so, it was much louder
than I expected.

389
00:39:50,652 --> 00:39:55,818
<i>I don't know how long I was in there.
Five minutes, an hour...</i>

390
00:39:56,366 --> 00:39:59,325
When I left,
I was covered with blood.

391
00:39:59,411 --> 00:40:02,119
I walked right down the street.

392
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:05,281
I was invisible.

393
00:40:05,375 --> 00:40:09,039
Nobody seemed to notice me,
nobody cared.

394
00:40:22,809 --> 00:40:24,300
Hello?

395
00:40:36,072 --> 00:40:37,779
Christ, I got a lot.

396
00:40:49,336 --> 00:40:50,417
Appreciate it, Ed.

397
00:40:50,503 --> 00:40:52,210
- Hey, good story.
- Thanks a lot.

398
00:40:52,297 --> 00:40:56,462
I liked it.
Really, I read it twice.

399
00:40:56,551 --> 00:41:00,261
- Nicely done, Mal.
- Is Nolan real busy right now?

400
00:41:20,075 --> 00:41:22,067
Seen this yet?

401
00:41:24,204 --> 00:41:27,788
Jacoby wanted me
to make sure you saw it.

402
00:41:27,874 --> 00:41:29,285
Page 103.

403
00:41:38,468 --> 00:41:43,759
Our illustrious publisher thinks
you may be entering Pulitzer territory.

404
00:41:48,686 --> 00:41:53,647
You jump to another paper, Mal,
I'll punch your heart in.

405
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:19,257
Celebrating with you is making adequate use
of all my remedial skills.

406
00:42:23,179 --> 00:42:26,343
I'm sorry, honey.
I'm out of it.

407
00:42:28,726 --> 00:42:33,642
- Waiting for the phone to ring?
- I can't get my mind off it.

408
00:42:36,317 --> 00:42:38,809
Do you want him to call?

409
00:42:39,529 --> 00:42:43,318
If he quits talking to me,
we might never get him.

410
00:42:44,117 --> 00:42:45,779
We?

411
00:42:51,458 --> 00:42:55,293
I can't get away from this thing
until it's over.

412
00:42:56,045 --> 00:43:00,005
- I gave my notice.
- So did I.

413
00:43:01,926 --> 00:43:04,509
Yeah, postdated.

414
00:43:05,305 --> 00:43:09,720
- What?
- I just don't think you know what you're doing!

415
00:43:09,809 --> 00:43:12,552
Things happen out there,
it's called the news.

416
00:43:12,645 --> 00:43:14,887
I only report it.

417
00:43:16,191 --> 00:43:20,401
Are you reporting it
or participating in it?

418
00:43:22,197 --> 00:43:25,315
It's kind of a unique situation.

419
00:43:27,327 --> 00:43:29,944
What do you want me to do?

420
00:43:35,502 --> 00:43:37,664
We'll get away
from here when we can.

421
00:43:39,631 --> 00:43:41,964
Come on, honey...

422
00:43:49,015 --> 00:43:52,258
- Excuse me, can I get the check?
- Yes, sir.

423
00:44:51,911 --> 00:44:54,619
Too many creepy cab drivers.

424
00:45:07,594 --> 00:45:10,052
When this thing is all over...

425
00:45:10,763 --> 00:45:15,178
...whether you end up
at a twenty-cent weekly in Colorado or...

426
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:18,393
..."The New York Times"...

427
00:45:21,608 --> 00:45:24,772
...part of it stays with you.

428
00:45:32,577 --> 00:45:35,786
I just wish
you'd think about that.

429
00:46:11,949 --> 00:46:15,943
- Hello?
<i>- Is Malcolm Anderson there?</i>

430
00:46:16,496 --> 00:46:20,080
No, I'm sorry, he's still in the shower.
Can I have him call you back?

431
00:46:20,166 --> 00:46:21,828
No.

432
00:46:22,418 --> 00:46:25,707
We've never met,
I'm Malcolm's friend.

433
00:46:25,797 --> 00:46:27,880
<i>You know, the one?</i>

434
00:46:27,965 --> 00:46:30,503
Why are you doing this?

435
00:46:30,593 --> 00:46:33,882
Christine, this is between
Malcolm and me.

436
00:46:33,971 --> 00:46:36,133
Don't call me Christine.

437
00:46:36,224 --> 00:46:41,390
<i>- Can I talk to Malcolm?</i>
- No. Why are you killing innocent people?

438
00:46:41,479 --> 00:46:44,313
- Give me the phone, Chris.
- Malcolm, you can't talk to him.

439
00:46:44,399 --> 00:46:49,110
- What are you doing? Give me the phone.
- Malcolm, he's sick!

440
00:46:52,156 --> 00:46:56,571
- Don't talk to him.
<i>- Malcolm? Are you there?</i>

441
00:46:56,661 --> 00:46:59,324
- Just don't talk to him.
<i>- Are you there, Malcolm?</i>

442
00:46:59,414 --> 00:47:00,996
It's me.

443
00:47:01,666 --> 00:47:04,830
I'm sorry
I couldn't get to the phone.

444
00:47:05,878 --> 00:47:08,291
It doesn't matter.

445
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:14,085
Why don't you just tell her
not to answer the phone?

446
00:47:15,471 --> 00:47:20,762
- I think you'd better call me at the paper.
<i>- You must be anxious to get to work.</i>

447
00:47:20,852 --> 00:47:23,890
<i>- Number four...</i>
- Where?

448
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:26,063
<i>Matheson Hammock.</i>

449
00:47:27,191 --> 00:47:30,059
Malcolm, how long
are you gonna let this go on?

450
00:47:30,153 --> 00:47:32,770
What do you want me to do?
I'm locked into this.

451
00:47:32,864 --> 00:47:38,826
- He won't talk to anybody else!
- It's turned into a collaboration!

452
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:42,488
- That's a real stupid thing to say.
- Stupid?

453
00:47:42,582 --> 00:47:44,790
You just got off the phone
with a maniac.

454
00:47:44,876 --> 00:47:49,496
Did you ever tell that to him?
Do you two ever argue?

455
00:47:49,589 --> 00:47:52,582
Ray? I just got another one.

456
00:48:07,774 --> 00:48:10,892
- How are we doing here?
- Straight back.

457
00:48:14,405 --> 00:48:16,522
They're over there.

458
00:48:29,587 --> 00:48:32,921
Okay. You're okay.

459
00:48:33,007 --> 00:48:34,669
Mommy!

460
00:48:36,177 --> 00:48:38,464
You're okay, baby.

461
00:48:40,014 --> 00:48:42,472
Tony, how are you doing?

462
00:48:42,558 --> 00:48:46,222
- She's all chopped up.
- Take a walk.

463
00:49:16,509 --> 00:49:21,379
<i>We're about to talk to Malcolm Anderson,
a reporter for "The Miami Journal".</i>

464
00:49:21,472 --> 00:49:26,888
<i>Recently, the series of brutal murders
in his city has changed his objectivity...</i>

465
00:49:26,978 --> 00:49:30,187
<i>...because the killer chose to use him
as a liaison...</i>

466
00:49:30,273 --> 00:49:32,640
<i>...between the community,
the police and himself.</i>

467
00:49:32,733 --> 00:49:37,979
<i>A situation has developed where a reporter is
materially involved in the story he's covering.</i>

468
00:49:38,072 --> 00:49:41,315
<i>He's with us at WSVN,
our NBC affiliate in Miami.</i>

469
00:49:41,409 --> 00:49:44,902
<i>- Good morning. Thanks for being with us.</i>
- My pleasure, John.

470
00:49:44,996 --> 00:49:50,583
<i>Tell us when and where
you received that first call.</i>

471
00:49:50,668 --> 00:49:55,459
<i>It was at the "Journal"
a few days after they found the first body.</i>

472
00:49:55,548 --> 00:49:59,132
<i>How did you react
when he told you who he was?</i>

473
00:49:59,218 --> 00:50:02,131
<i>Of course,
I didn't believe him at first.</i>

474
00:50:02,221 --> 00:50:05,259
<i>In my years of reporting,
I've had my share ofpeculiar calls.</i>

475
00:50:05,349 --> 00:50:07,887
<i>But he convinced you?</i>

476
00:50:07,977 --> 00:50:12,096
<i>He did have knowledge of the murder
and the victim no one else could've had.</i>

477
00:50:12,189 --> 00:50:17,025
<i>- How many times have you and he talked?
- Five times, John.</i>

478
00:50:17,111 --> 00:50:21,776
<i>Can we assume that he hasn't said anything
that's been of much help to the police?</i>

479
00:50:23,034 --> 00:50:27,904
<i>It wouldn't be helpful for me to comment
on the progress of the investigation.</i>

480
00:50:27,997 --> 00:50:30,740
<i>After talking to him
as often as you have...</i>

481
00:50:30,833 --> 00:50:34,372
<i>...what's your sense
of the relationship that's developed?</i>

482
00:50:34,462 --> 00:50:38,331
<i>"Relationship" suggests that
there's something in it for both parties.</i>

483
00:50:38,424 --> 00:50:44,591
<i>I'm certainly doing what I can to help,
but this wasn't my idea. He called me.</i>

484
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:51,473
<i>- Has he ever said why he called you?
- Yes, he said, he liked the way I write.</i>

485
00:51:12,208 --> 00:51:15,622
<i>I saw you on TV this morning.
I didn't like it.</i>

486
00:51:15,711 --> 00:51:19,079
- Why?
<i>- You're becoming more important than me.</i>

487
00:51:19,173 --> 00:51:22,166
<i>I'm doing the work,
you get put on TV.</i>

488
00:51:22,259 --> 00:51:25,047
<i>You're getting
too much attention.</i>

489
00:51:25,137 --> 00:51:29,347
<i>I really wish I could come forward
and speak for myself.</i>

490
00:51:29,433 --> 00:51:34,929
<i>Of course, I can't.
I've only been arrested once.</i>

491
00:51:35,022 --> 00:51:38,265
- What year?
<i>- Come on...</i>

492
00:51:38,359 --> 00:51:43,479
<i>I'm already being too generous
on phones that are tapped.</i>

493
00:51:43,572 --> 00:51:46,315
My phone isn't tapped.

494
00:51:47,034 --> 00:51:49,117
Is there any chance
we'll ever meet in person?

495
00:51:49,203 --> 00:51:52,992
<i>So you can bring the cops
and be a real hero?</i>

496
00:51:53,082 --> 00:51:56,541
<i>You anger me, you know that?</i>

497
00:51:57,586 --> 00:51:58,952
Cuban coffee, Phil?

498
00:51:59,046 --> 00:52:02,210
<i>I really wish
I could come forward.</i>

499
00:52:02,299 --> 00:52:05,963
- This is interesting.
<i>- Of course, I can't.</i>

500
00:52:06,679 --> 00:52:08,545
<i>I've only been arrested once.</i>

501
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:11,507
<i>- What year?
- Come on.</i>

502
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:16,766
<i>I'm already being too generous
on phones that are tapped.</i>

503
00:52:17,481 --> 00:52:21,225
<i>My phone isn't tapped.
Is there any chance we'll ever meet in person?</i>

504
00:52:21,318 --> 00:52:22,399
Dumb.

505
00:52:22,486 --> 00:52:25,729
<i>So you can bring the cops
and be a real hero?</i>

506
00:52:25,823 --> 00:52:28,361
Him, you arrest dead.

507
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:34,871
- You've gotta catch him first.
- You get a feel for him.

508
00:52:34,957 --> 00:52:40,874
You figure out what he'll go after next
and then you blow his diseased brains out.

509
00:52:41,756 --> 00:52:44,749
I'm gonna get
some American coffee.

510
00:52:50,014 --> 00:52:52,597
We sent a guy to Michigan.

511
00:52:52,683 --> 00:52:56,393
There's no record of the industrial accident
that he described.

512
00:52:56,479 --> 00:52:59,267
Not at any
of the major assembly plants.

513
00:53:00,024 --> 00:53:03,313
I've got a 50
says he's making all this up.

514
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:12,325
You're not tapping my phone,
right, Ray?

515
00:53:15,081 --> 00:53:16,697
No.

516
00:53:20,044 --> 00:53:22,536
- Good night, Ray.
- Yeah.

517
00:53:42,858 --> 00:53:45,020
Perfect, wide open.

518
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:56,551
Por favor,
I deliver for you the paper.

519
00:54:59,935 --> 00:55:01,221
What happened?

520
00:55:04,273 --> 00:55:08,108
I've been with the cops all night,
and the place is wide open.

521
00:55:08,194 --> 00:55:12,108
Is it too much trouble
to lock the goddamn door?

522
00:55:15,409 --> 00:55:18,902
I didn't even know
you were gone.

523
00:55:24,668 --> 00:55:27,752
- I'm sorry.
- I don't want to be around this any more.

524
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:31,127
- I'm sorry. I mean it, I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

525
00:55:31,217 --> 00:55:32,628
Don't be.

526
00:55:40,809 --> 00:55:45,270
You're living alone and I'm living
with somebody I don't even know.

527
00:55:47,441 --> 00:55:49,649
- It doesn't work.
- What does that mean?

528
00:55:49,735 --> 00:55:53,570
I'm putting a lot of time in the story
and you feel left alone.

529
00:55:53,656 --> 00:55:56,023
That's all there is to it,
right?

530
00:55:56,116 --> 00:55:58,984
You have no idea what it is.

531
00:55:59,078 --> 00:56:03,288
You can't.
You're not paying enough attention.

532
00:56:04,416 --> 00:56:09,753
Chris, I've busted my ass for eight years.
What we've wanted is right here.

533
00:56:10,381 --> 00:56:13,545
Don't you understand that?

534
00:56:13,634 --> 00:56:19,631
Ever since they started the body count,
you've let everything slide.

535
00:56:19,723 --> 00:56:24,593
I've gotten so far away
that leaving's just a formality.

536
00:56:25,271 --> 00:56:30,687
This is the last thing we need right now.
I said I was sorry, okay?

537
00:56:31,610 --> 00:56:33,272
I heard you.

538
00:56:50,254 --> 00:56:53,873
- You want a drag?
- Drag, your ass.

539
00:56:53,966 --> 00:56:56,583
You gotta be closer
than you're saying.

540
00:56:56,677 --> 00:56:59,420
I'd like everyone to think so.

541
00:57:00,431 --> 00:57:03,265
You got a voiceprint, his MO
and you know he's duplicating.

542
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:05,996
You know the part of the country he's from.
You've gotta be getting somewhere.

543
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:10,890
This guy is killing people he's had no
personal contact with, nobody he's mad at.

544
00:57:10,983 --> 00:57:13,896
- It's tough.
- What do you do all day?

545
00:57:13,986 --> 00:57:17,730
We run down 25 or 30 phone calls from people
who think they live in the same room with him.

546
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:18,984
So do I.

547
00:57:19,074 --> 00:57:22,408
When you write enough about somebody,
he starts sounding like everybody.

548
00:57:22,494 --> 00:57:25,532
I didn't expect it to last this long.

549
00:57:25,622 --> 00:57:28,456
As long as he's out there,
he's definitely news.

550
00:57:28,542 --> 00:57:32,001
- Yes, so are you.
- What are you saying to me?

551
00:57:32,087 --> 00:57:35,317
- I never understand what the fuck you're saying!
- What the hell's the matter with you?

552
00:57:35,341 --> 00:57:39,676
- I'm tired of him.
- You're getting in places you don't belong.

553
00:57:40,304 --> 00:57:43,388
- Damnit!
- Hey! Walk away.

554
00:57:43,474 --> 00:57:47,184
Go get him, Wilson.
Catch him so we can all go home!

555
00:57:51,106 --> 00:57:53,849
You're coming apart on me, Mal.

556
00:57:53,942 --> 00:57:57,276
If you come apart, you crash!
Right now we got nothing!

557
00:57:57,363 --> 00:58:02,700
Get this guy before he kills somebody else.
I'm tired of being your contact man.

558
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,208
Son of a bitch.

559
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:21,669
"If you'd like a nice, home-cooked meal
and some quiet conversation...

560
00:58:21,762 --> 00:58:25,881
...I hope to see you soon."

561
00:58:32,106 --> 00:58:38,273
"After the last killing, I read that
the killer worked on an auto assembly line.

562
00:58:38,362 --> 00:58:42,652
I remember a guy from
Kenosha, Wisconsin, or somewhere...

563
00:58:42,741 --> 00:58:44,903
...who was connected
to something like this.

564
00:58:44,993 --> 00:58:47,531
You wrote the killer was duplicating
other murders.

565
00:58:47,621 --> 00:58:50,489
He sounds like the one
I heard about."

566
00:58:50,582 --> 00:58:54,496
There's some kind
of a list there.

567
00:58:59,133 --> 00:59:02,251
"I'll talk to you alone.
No police either.

568
00:59:02,344 --> 00:59:05,115
I live at the Paradise Trailer Park.
If anybody or any cops come with you...

569
00:59:05,139 --> 00:59:07,882
...I'll deny I wrote this."

570
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:13,019
- Here's the address.
- What do you think?

571
00:59:15,482 --> 00:59:17,348
Give it a shot.

572
00:59:22,573 --> 00:59:23,689
Why not?

573
01:00:29,306 --> 01:00:30,422
Excuse me.

574
01:00:38,065 --> 01:00:40,978
- You Mr. Anderson?
- Yeah.

575
01:00:42,945 --> 01:00:46,529
- All alone.
- I think I'm glad you've come.

576
01:00:54,665 --> 01:00:58,784
I've gotta get this thing refitted
down at the VA hospital.

577
01:00:58,877 --> 01:01:01,244
They treat you pretty good
down there.

578
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:07,459
I'm just gonna take a couple of notes.
You don't mind, do you?

579
01:01:09,096 --> 01:01:13,636
I guess, go ahead.
But I don't want my name in the paper.

580
01:01:13,725 --> 01:01:17,685
This guy won't think twice
about wasting me.

581
01:01:17,771 --> 01:01:20,935
I've been wasted enough already.
Gotta hang on to what I got left.

582
01:01:21,024 --> 01:01:25,314
I can give you anonymity,
but the police are gonna want to talk to you.

583
01:01:26,196 --> 01:01:29,280
- Let me think about that.
- I'm a little short on time.

584
01:01:29,366 --> 01:01:33,736
I'm working on a deadline.
So why don't we start with your name?

585
01:01:33,829 --> 01:01:39,951
Listen, I've been led to believe that
you people pay for this kind of information.

586
01:01:40,043 --> 01:01:45,584
- I don't.
- Oh, come on. It won't be much. 20? 10?

587
01:01:45,674 --> 01:01:49,463
Do you have any information for me
or not?

588
01:01:51,138 --> 01:01:56,930
This guy's name was O'Shaughnessy.
I met him downtown.

589
01:01:57,769 --> 01:02:00,978
Down at the Salvation Army.

590
01:02:01,732 --> 01:02:03,974
Kind of a juicer.

591
01:02:04,067 --> 01:02:10,109
He was depressed all the time,
but then he had good reason to be.

592
01:02:10,907 --> 01:02:15,493
About a year ago,
he lost his parents...

593
01:02:15,579 --> 01:02:19,323
...his wife, sister-in-law
and teenage daughter.

594
01:02:19,416 --> 01:02:21,078
What happened?

595
01:02:21,668 --> 01:02:24,285
His brother
went out of his head.

596
01:02:24,379 --> 01:02:28,214
Got his gun in the middle of the day
and killed them all.

597
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:33,045
Put the muzzle right here at the base
of their skulls and blew their heads off.

598
01:02:34,681 --> 01:02:36,923
Sound familiar to you?

599
01:02:42,814 --> 01:02:47,525
You said his last name was O'Shaughnessy?
Do you remember his first name?

600
01:02:47,611 --> 01:02:49,273
Albert, I do believe.

601
01:02:54,785 --> 01:02:58,119
- Where was this?
- Kenosha, Wisconsin.

602
01:02:58,205 --> 01:03:03,917
He worked on a Pacer line.
He used to call them Kenosha Cadillacs.

603
01:03:05,212 --> 01:03:07,704
This guy's from Detroit.

604
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:09,876
Kenosha.

605
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:17,514
I got that right here
in my notes.

606
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:20,967
- Excuse me a minute.
- Here it is.

607
01:03:21,061 --> 01:03:23,644
I gotta take myself a piss.

608
01:03:34,533 --> 01:03:38,493
This is really good.
It's really all I need.

609
01:03:40,122 --> 01:03:43,456
I gotta get your name
for legal reasons.

610
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:49,462
Mike Hilson, spec 4.
Honorably discharged April 1, 1971.

611
01:03:49,548 --> 01:03:55,135
- Is that H-I-L-S-O-N?
- That's right.

612
01:04:12,571 --> 01:04:17,487
Killed me some slopes with this.
It's no good at a distance...

613
01:04:17,576 --> 01:04:22,492
...but when you drop them with the M-16,
this'll stop them wriggling.

614
01:04:23,582 --> 01:04:25,915
Click it if you want.

615
01:04:26,001 --> 01:04:30,416
Firing pin's out because
my nephew likes to play with it.

616
01:04:31,339 --> 01:04:34,628
You don't need to tell me
it's a lousy toy for a kid.

617
01:04:38,805 --> 01:04:41,798
Fucking leg!
Sometimes I wish I was paralyzed all the way.

618
01:04:41,892 --> 01:04:45,886
Then VA'd have to give me
an extra 60 bucks a month.

619
01:04:46,897 --> 01:04:48,980
Thanks, Mike.

620
01:04:51,943 --> 01:04:57,564
If there's anything I can do to help you out
down at the VA, just give me a call.

621
01:04:57,657 --> 01:04:59,523
Thank you very much.

622
01:05:07,667 --> 01:05:11,786
- Take care of yourself.
- Hey, thanks a lot!

623
01:05:35,821 --> 01:05:38,814
We ought to throw you in jail
for obstructing justice.

624
01:05:38,907 --> 01:05:42,025
You should have called me, Mal,
after you put this story to bed.

625
01:05:42,118 --> 01:05:45,407
I had enough for a story,
but not for you.

626
01:05:45,497 --> 01:05:50,288
That's not your decision!
Just give me the guy's address.

627
01:05:50,377 --> 01:05:52,243
- We've got problems.
- What?

628
01:05:52,337 --> 01:05:55,956
American Motors have never employed
an Albert O'Shaughnessy.

629
01:05:56,049 --> 01:05:59,008
The Pentagon says, there was no spec 4
named Michael Hilson...

630
01:05:59,094 --> 01:06:01,928
...discharged from the 1st Division,
April 1, 1971.

631
01:06:02,013 --> 01:06:05,131
- Great.
- I think we've been screwed.

632
01:06:06,226 --> 01:06:08,764
April 1? April Fools'?

633
01:06:11,064 --> 01:06:14,853
You said you wanted to meet him face-to-face.
Remember that?!

634
01:06:16,361 --> 01:06:18,023
What?

635
01:06:23,451 --> 01:06:25,317
<i>I enjoyed our little chat.</i>

636
01:06:25,412 --> 01:06:30,328
<i>I hope we can meet
under more favorable circumstances.</i>

637
01:06:34,045 --> 01:06:36,082
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

638
01:06:36,798 --> 01:06:41,714
<i>But you did want to meet
in person, Malcolm.</i>

639
01:06:41,803 --> 01:06:44,136
<i>You told me that yourself.</i>

640
01:06:45,265 --> 01:06:48,474
<i>Four down, one to go.</i>

641
01:06:55,692 --> 01:06:57,775
Hell of a deal...

642
01:07:27,849 --> 01:07:29,966
We could've had him.

643
01:07:32,604 --> 01:07:34,436
Seal it off.

644
01:07:51,164 --> 01:07:54,498
Okay, people. Help us out.
Let's move it back here.

645
01:07:54,584 --> 01:07:56,701
Move it back now, please.

646
01:08:18,692 --> 01:08:22,106
You're gonna take a public whipping
like no one's ever seen.

647
01:08:22,195 --> 01:08:26,314
I have no idea
how to write this.

648
01:08:31,955 --> 01:08:34,868
- I'd better go.
- Yeah.

649
01:08:34,958 --> 01:08:37,996
When you're finished with their artist,
bring back a copy of the sketch.

650
01:08:38,086 --> 01:08:40,078
I keep working on it.

651
01:08:44,009 --> 01:08:45,716
Anderson.

652
01:08:45,802 --> 01:08:47,759
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>

653
01:08:49,806 --> 01:08:52,719
What the hell
are you trying to prove?

654
01:08:52,809 --> 01:08:56,268
<i>You were getting bigger than me.
I had to bring you down a peg or two.</i>

655
01:08:56,354 --> 01:09:00,815
You did that.
Call somebody else. Your story's gotten old.

656
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:02,482
<i>I'm going to freshen it up.</i>

657
01:09:02,569 --> 01:09:05,528
<i>I had planned on
talking to someone else.</i>

658
01:09:05,613 --> 01:09:08,902
Fine, I'm not writing
one more word about you.

659
01:09:09,784 --> 01:09:14,404
I knew this would happen,
but you're still going to have a part.

660
01:09:14,497 --> 01:09:17,240
No, no part.

661
01:09:18,084 --> 01:09:20,497
<i>Don't be that way, Malcolm.</i>

662
01:09:20,587 --> 01:09:25,378
<i>Remember,
no one's safe, no one's immune.</i>

663
01:09:25,467 --> 01:09:27,584
Are you threatening me?

664
01:09:29,721 --> 01:09:34,762
I study people, too.
Just like a reporter.

665
01:09:34,851 --> 01:09:38,640
Watch their habits,
their routines.

666
01:09:40,315 --> 01:09:42,602
Supposing her car
wouldn't start.

667
01:09:42,692 --> 01:09:46,481
<i>How would she know the wires
had been switched on the distributor cap?</i>

668
01:09:46,571 --> 01:09:51,657
Do you think she'd turn down help
from a substitute teacher?

669
01:09:56,289 --> 01:09:57,621
Hey!

670
01:10:00,919 --> 01:10:02,410
What's the matter with you?

671
01:10:39,290 --> 01:10:43,034
- Would you like me to take a look?
- Oh, sure. Please.

672
01:10:44,212 --> 01:10:46,670
I don't know what's wrong.
It was fine this morning.

673
01:10:46,756 --> 01:10:50,545
This isn't my field,
but sometimes I get lucky.

674
01:11:32,927 --> 01:11:34,634
Shit...

675
01:12:02,081 --> 01:12:04,494
Okay, try it again.

676
01:12:32,237 --> 01:12:35,071
Set up perimeter here.
Come with me.

677
01:12:43,831 --> 01:12:46,699
- Where's Christine Connelly?
- I don't know.

678
01:12:46,793 --> 01:12:50,377
I saw her in the hall talking to someone,
just a few minutes ago.

679
01:12:50,463 --> 01:12:53,376
- Who?
- Hey, man! What are you trying to do?

680
01:12:53,466 --> 01:12:55,879
- You want to get somebody killed?
- What's wrong?

681
01:12:55,969 --> 01:12:59,178
Can anybody walk around
your goddamn school?

682
01:12:59,264 --> 01:13:01,130
Enough!

683
01:13:01,224 --> 01:13:03,637
Did you see them leave, ma'am?

684
01:13:04,269 --> 01:13:05,805
Stay here!

685
01:13:43,057 --> 01:13:44,889
Come on out.

686
01:13:46,436 --> 01:13:51,602
It's okay now.
We're just looking for the bad guys.

687
01:13:53,359 --> 01:13:56,693
Crayons, huh? So that's it?

688
01:14:02,785 --> 01:14:04,822
Sorry, kid.

689
01:14:43,284 --> 01:14:44,946
Mal?

690
01:14:49,415 --> 01:14:54,456
This guy is all flash.
She's okay.

691
01:14:55,004 --> 01:14:57,496
- You think so, Ray?
- Yes.

692
01:14:57,590 --> 01:15:02,756
If he's duplicating those five killings,
he's already accounted for all the women.

693
01:15:03,304 --> 01:15:05,216
She's okay.

694
01:15:20,488 --> 01:15:25,984
Have you ever noticed that the older you get,
the smaller you become?

695
01:15:26,077 --> 01:15:30,162
When I was a little kid...

696
01:15:30,248 --> 01:15:34,663
...the block we lived on
was the whole world to me.

697
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:41,382
I knew everybody.
I was significant, even important.

698
01:15:43,136 --> 01:15:45,423
Are you gonna kill me?

699
01:15:47,723 --> 01:15:52,093
Let's try to keep these things
as abstract as possible, okay?

700
01:15:52,186 --> 01:15:53,722
Apple?

701
01:16:01,779 --> 01:16:05,523
- I want you to understand something.
- What?

702
01:16:05,616 --> 01:16:09,326
You're killing people
because you want to be noticed?

703
01:16:09,412 --> 01:16:12,951
- You want to feel significant?
- Hey, as a teacher...

704
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:15,453
...your range of comprehension
could be improved.

705
01:16:15,543 --> 01:16:17,660
I'm sorry.

706
01:16:22,758 --> 01:16:27,924
For the most part,
good behavior goes unnoticed.

707
01:16:29,515 --> 01:16:33,930
- What do you care?
- I do care!

708
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:39,812
Just tell me what you want understood!
Just tell me what you want...

709
01:16:39,901 --> 01:16:44,191
It's not important!
Nothing is.

710
01:16:45,406 --> 01:16:48,365
All you're concerned
about is dying.

711
01:16:53,331 --> 01:16:59,544
I'm not responsible.
It's not my fault. None of it is.

712
01:17:17,104 --> 01:17:19,266
Just give it a couple
of full rings.

713
01:17:31,494 --> 01:17:33,360
It's Nolan.

714
01:17:39,835 --> 01:17:41,417
Okay.

715
01:17:42,922 --> 01:17:46,916
Some guy who's been following my stories
just walked into the "Journal".

716
01:17:47,009 --> 01:17:49,968
He thinks he knows the killer.
He says, he knows him well.

717
01:17:50,054 --> 01:17:52,387
Tell him we're on our way.

718
01:17:52,473 --> 01:17:57,514
- What if the call comes here?
- He knows where to reach you, Mal.

719
01:17:58,771 --> 01:18:00,558
Ten minutes.

720
01:18:05,444 --> 01:18:09,438
Look, maybe this isn't
the right person.

721
01:18:13,286 --> 01:18:15,403
It seemed weird to me...

722
01:18:15,496 --> 01:18:20,366
...when I read my name in that story
you got from the guy at the trailer.

723
01:18:20,459 --> 01:18:27,459
Those five murders he told you about sound like
a series of murders in Chicago a few years ago.

724
01:18:28,384 --> 01:18:32,219
I was working at a state-funded
halfway house at the time.

725
01:18:32,305 --> 01:18:37,551
For dopers, alcoholics,
mental hospital discharges.

726
01:18:37,643 --> 01:18:44,482
Some character stumbles into my office and
says he's the guy who killed those five people.

727
01:18:46,277 --> 01:18:50,487
He says, he went to the cops
and turned himself in...

728
01:18:50,573 --> 01:18:55,785
...but they chased him out when some
psychiatrist decided that he was somebody...

729
01:18:55,870 --> 01:18:58,578
...who got off
making confessions.

730
01:18:58,664 --> 01:19:00,951
He needed the headlines.

731
01:19:01,626 --> 01:19:03,993
Is that what you thought?

732
01:19:06,422 --> 01:19:09,130
I went down to the precinct with him
and listened to his story.

733
01:19:09,216 --> 01:19:11,629
It sounded straight to me.

734
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:17,966
It turned out, though, that he did have
a history of false confessions.

735
01:19:19,185 --> 01:19:22,678
He was pissed, though.
I mean, he was pissed.

736
01:19:22,772 --> 01:19:27,267
He figured he finally did something,
and somebody else got the credit.

737
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:31,274
After the visit to the police,
he kept coming around?

738
01:19:31,364 --> 01:19:36,860
He calls one more time
after things quiet down.

739
01:19:36,952 --> 01:19:40,866
He wants to thank me
for being so unselfish.

740
01:19:40,956 --> 01:19:46,827
He said if I tried to get
any attention from what he'd done...

741
01:19:46,921 --> 01:19:49,163
...he'd have me killed.

742
01:19:50,758 --> 01:19:54,593
- You got a name on this guy?
- Yeah.

743
01:19:54,679 --> 01:19:57,968
- Alan Delour.
- Sounds like our man.

744
01:20:48,023 --> 01:20:51,061
- Lieutenant, no one up here!
- Okay, it's clear.

745
01:20:51,152 --> 01:20:53,394
<i>There's nobody up there.</i>

746
01:20:53,487 --> 01:20:56,321
<i>Perimeter people, bring it on in.</i>

747
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:06,873
Missed him again.

748
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:10,168
- We'll be there, Ray, around the corner.
- Okay.

749
01:21:12,715 --> 01:21:14,331
Nobody in there all night.

750
01:21:38,115 --> 01:21:39,697
Raymond...

751
01:21:51,504 --> 01:21:54,087
I'm gonna get Mal in here.

752
01:22:00,387 --> 01:22:02,219
<i>This is for Malcolm.</i>

753
01:22:02,306 --> 01:22:05,424
<i>You've gotten this far,
so you know who I am.</i>

754
01:22:05,518 --> 01:22:07,009
Anderson!

755
01:22:11,023 --> 01:22:13,766
- She's not in there.
- No.

756
01:22:13,859 --> 01:22:16,067
But he's our guy.

757
01:22:18,030 --> 01:22:20,693
He left a tape for you, Mal.

758
01:22:20,783 --> 01:22:23,901
What do you think, Malcolm?
Come on!

759
01:22:25,079 --> 01:22:26,079
Upstairs.

760
01:22:41,762 --> 01:22:43,674
We'll be outside.

761
01:22:46,433 --> 01:22:47,719
Come on.

762
01:22:47,810 --> 01:22:49,927
<i>This is for Malcolm.</i>

763
01:22:50,479 --> 01:22:54,769
<i>You've gotten this far,
so you know who I am.</i>

764
01:22:55,693 --> 01:22:57,434
<i>It was time.</i>

765
01:22:58,988 --> 01:23:01,856
<i>I'm not sure what to do now.</i>

766
01:23:01,949 --> 01:23:06,694
<i>How to wrap it all up
so it makes sense.</i>

767
01:23:07,663 --> 01:23:13,910
<i>I'm very sorry about your girlfriend,
but you got so much from all this.</i>

768
01:23:14,003 --> 01:23:16,996
<i>You must've known
there would be a price.</i>

769
01:23:18,924 --> 01:23:22,543
<i>When I've made my mind up how it ends,
I'll call.</i>

770
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:26,296
<i>And please spell my name right.</i>

771
01:23:26,390 --> 01:23:32,011
<i>Alan with one L,
Delour... D-E-L-O-U-R.</i>

772
01:23:34,481 --> 01:23:36,643
<i>Thanks for everything.</i>

773
01:24:25,783 --> 01:24:28,196
Could I have some privacy?

774
01:24:40,381 --> 01:24:43,670
<i>- Malcolm?</i>
- What's the matter? Nobody else to talk to?

775
01:24:45,344 --> 01:24:48,178
Would you like
to talk to Christine?

776
01:24:49,848 --> 01:24:52,090
Is she alive?
Just tell me.

777
01:24:52,184 --> 01:24:56,679
She's right here with me.
We're out in the Glades.

778
01:24:56,772 --> 01:25:01,062
<i>Ellis Hammock,
out near Coopertown.</i>

779
01:25:02,903 --> 01:25:06,192
<i>I'll trade her for you.</i>

780
01:25:06,991 --> 01:25:11,702
And don't bring the police.
They'll just ruin it for all of us.

781
01:25:11,787 --> 01:25:13,528
Bye.

782
01:26:10,846 --> 01:26:12,178
Go!

783
01:26:13,766 --> 01:26:14,973
Up the right flank!

784
01:26:20,522 --> 01:26:23,310
They're here.
We found an empty boat.

785
01:26:47,549 --> 01:26:49,882
Over here! He's running away!

786
01:26:54,014 --> 01:26:58,304
Straight ahead.
We've made contact with the suspect.

787
01:26:58,977 --> 01:27:01,970
You two, circle that side.
You, come with me.

788
01:27:26,630 --> 01:27:29,589
No shooting.
He has a hostage.

789
01:27:34,263 --> 01:27:35,799
Where is she, Alan?

790
01:27:42,020 --> 01:27:46,936
You coward, Anderson!
You couldn't do one thing right for me!

791
01:27:47,025 --> 01:27:50,359
I told you
not to bring anyone with you!

792
01:27:51,238 --> 01:27:53,946
It's over!
You can't get out of here!

793
01:27:54,032 --> 01:27:59,278
I didn't want to! You and me, Malcolm!
That's what I wanted!

794
01:27:59,371 --> 01:28:04,116
You can have that!
Just send her out and I'll come in there!

795
01:28:04,209 --> 01:28:09,170
- You've ruined everything!
- Where is she, Alan?

796
01:28:09,256 --> 01:28:12,090
It's too late!

797
01:28:13,427 --> 01:28:18,547
Goddamn you, Anderson!
Goddamn you to hell!

798
01:28:28,525 --> 01:28:30,482
Alan!

799
01:28:39,995 --> 01:28:41,657
Alan!

800
01:28:44,499 --> 01:28:46,456
Christine!

801
01:29:11,693 --> 01:29:13,525
Where is she?

802
01:29:14,613 --> 01:29:17,481
Mal... Mal, he's dead.

803
01:29:18,617 --> 01:29:20,904
- They found her.
- Where?

804
01:29:20,994 --> 01:29:23,953
She's okay. Straight back.

805
01:29:25,540 --> 01:29:27,452
Get him out of there!

806
01:29:29,336 --> 01:29:31,123
Move him!

807
01:29:32,756 --> 01:29:36,591
Stay here!
I don't want anybody touching him!

808
01:29:38,971 --> 01:29:40,678
Damnit!

809
01:30:46,038 --> 01:30:47,825
Hey, Mal!
Did he rape her?

810
01:31:18,195 --> 01:31:22,735
- Did you let him get away, Lieutenant?
- Listen, sir! Stand back!

811
01:31:24,284 --> 01:31:26,901
- It's over.
- Stand back! Come on!

812
01:31:26,995 --> 01:31:28,987
Did you see the killer?

813
01:32:06,284 --> 01:32:08,446
That stuff stings.

814
01:32:15,252 --> 01:32:17,869
I'd better tie the place down.

815
01:32:21,758 --> 01:32:24,296
I'm gonna get some Aspirin.

816
01:33:37,459 --> 01:33:41,328
You are going to be sorry,
my friend.

817
01:33:42,547 --> 01:33:45,790
- Whose body was that?
- Number five.

818
01:33:45,884 --> 01:33:48,467
A good likeness,
don't you think?

819
01:33:48,553 --> 01:33:50,135
- I need you.
- Shut up.

820
01:33:50,222 --> 01:33:52,839
Shut up?
I can't shut up.

821
01:33:52,933 --> 01:33:57,519
- I still need a story.
- You were the story. That's the problem.

822
01:33:57,604 --> 01:34:01,848
Somewhere along the line,
you stole it away from me.

823
01:34:01,942 --> 01:34:03,934
- Malcolm?
- Don't come in!

824
01:34:06,196 --> 01:34:09,314
He's in here, Christine.
Come on.

825
01:34:15,956 --> 01:34:19,074
Just keep me, Delour,
but let her go.

826
01:34:19,167 --> 01:34:22,706
I don't care about her.
I care about us.

827
01:34:26,258 --> 01:34:32,129
We had a great thing going, Malcolm.
It was really working for both of us, wasn't it?

828
01:34:32,222 --> 01:34:34,430
It still can, Alan.

829
01:34:34,516 --> 01:34:39,386
But then you turned on me.
You wanted to be the star.

830
01:34:39,479 --> 01:34:41,892
You brought in the cops.

831
01:34:41,982 --> 01:34:45,020
- I thought we had an understanding.
- You're still the star, Alan.

832
01:34:45,110 --> 01:34:50,356
You're just talking to stay alive.
God, that makes me hate you.

833
01:34:51,157 --> 01:34:53,444
You're trying to distract me.

834
01:34:53,535 --> 01:34:57,074
Don't you think
I've thought about those things?

835
01:34:58,999 --> 01:35:04,211
At least the others went out
with some dignity.

836
01:35:04,296 --> 01:35:09,007
They didn't beg like you're begging,
Malcolm...

837
01:35:10,885 --> 01:35:15,175
That does disappoint me.

838
01:35:16,808 --> 01:35:22,224
- Don't move!
- I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here.

839
01:35:22,314 --> 01:35:25,603
- Christine?
- What? What do you want?

840
01:35:25,692 --> 01:35:28,776
All right, Alan. All right.

841
01:35:29,779 --> 01:35:33,864
So when they come and find the bodies,
who gets to tell the story?

842
01:35:34,409 --> 01:35:37,902
- They'll find somebody.
- He won't tell it like I can.

843
01:35:37,996 --> 01:35:41,489
Because he won't understand you
like I do.

844
01:35:42,709 --> 01:35:46,123
We'll just wait until the power
comes back on...

845
01:35:46,212 --> 01:35:50,877
...and then we'll record it on video tape.
It'll be on every TV station in the country.

846
01:35:50,967 --> 01:35:52,549
I'll just turn the machine on.

847
01:35:52,636 --> 01:35:54,196
- Don't do anything.
- Listen to me, Alan.

848
01:35:54,220 --> 01:35:57,258
It's a good idea.
It's good for you and it's good for me.

849
01:35:57,349 --> 01:35:59,682
We got the camera right here.

850
01:35:59,768 --> 01:36:02,886
We've got lights,
we've got the equipment. We're all set.

851
01:36:02,979 --> 01:36:07,770
- Don't move!
- I'm not moving. I'm right here.

852
01:36:08,318 --> 01:36:10,105
Now all we have to do...

853
01:36:14,449 --> 01:36:15,985
Malcolm!

854
01:36:16,493 --> 01:36:18,075
Malcolm!

855
01:36:27,837 --> 01:36:29,169
Malcolm!

856
01:36:35,887 --> 01:36:39,130
Malcolm! Stop it!

857
01:36:42,102 --> 01:36:43,968
Stop it!

858
01:36:50,402 --> 01:36:51,984
No!

859
01:37:09,796 --> 01:37:11,332
Malcolm!

860
01:37:14,801 --> 01:37:16,133
Malcolm!

861
01:37:19,889 --> 01:37:21,130
Malcolm!

862
01:37:36,406 --> 01:37:38,443
Call the police.

863
01:37:43,955 --> 01:37:46,197
The line's dead.

864
01:37:51,087 --> 01:37:54,330
You can't shoot me,
my friend.

865
01:37:54,424 --> 01:37:57,292
This is too good a story.

866
01:37:57,385 --> 01:38:01,049
You wouldn't pass up
the 7.00 news.

867
01:38:01,139 --> 01:38:05,258
Television...
You need an audience.

868
01:38:05,351 --> 01:38:07,217
Just like me.

869
01:38:08,313 --> 01:38:11,431
- This story is too big.
- Shoot him!

870
01:38:12,609 --> 01:38:14,976
You won't shoot me, my friend.

871
01:38:16,279 --> 01:38:18,566
I'm safe.

872
01:38:19,866 --> 01:38:21,732
Don't take another step...

873
01:39:09,833 --> 01:39:12,576
You didn't put your name on it.

874
01:39:51,833 --> 01:39:53,825
I love you.

875
01:39:55,837 --> 01:39:57,669
Let's go.
