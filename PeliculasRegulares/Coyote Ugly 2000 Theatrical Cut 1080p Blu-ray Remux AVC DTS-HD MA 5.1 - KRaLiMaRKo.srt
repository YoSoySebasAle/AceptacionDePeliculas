[man] Why don't you
ever realize the truth, Vince?

3
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:51,217
I ate nine pies and a meatball
hero in one hour. That's a record.

4
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,219
It wasn't nine pies.
It was eight.

5
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,556
You left two slices of mushroom
on the last tray.

6
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,059
- Violet?
- You guys, it was six pies.

7
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:03,229
No hero. I had to call the paramedics
to pump your stomach,

8
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:06,566
three years ago. When are you
gonna talk about something else?

9
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,986
When someone comes through
that door and breaks the record,

10
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,739
then we'll stop talking
about the subject.

11
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:15,032
Enjoy your pie, guys.

12
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:19,245
- It's the last one I'll ever serve.
- Aren't you forgetting something?

13
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,831
Quit it, Pete. I'm not doing that.

14
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,377
It's a tradition. Sign the card.

15
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,181
I got it, folks.
I got the first autograph.

16
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:41,601
- Hey, Violet. All right!
- Violet's on her way to the wall.

17
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:47,023
That's 20 years
of girls leaving town.

18
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:52,820
That wall is jinxed.
I won't sit near that wall.

19

than they did.

As you all know,
my best friend, Violet Sanford,

22
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:06,167
has decided...

23
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:10,254
...has decided to leave
South Amboy tomorrow

24
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:14,258
and travel the 42 miles
to New York City.

25
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:17,261
So... OK, come on.
Bring her up here, girls.

26
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:21,516
- Come on, Violet.
- [crowd hooting]

27
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,561
Come on, Vi.
Come on, everyone.

28
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:28,356
Hey, Violet, come on.
Come up here.

29
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,859
- Come on, honey.
- You guys!

30
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:34,987
Now, I think it's only fair
that tonight, on her last night

31
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:37,031
here with us in Jersey...

32
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:41,202

33
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,538

[man whistles] Look at this!

37
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:26,622
Four people killed last night
in New York.

38
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,624
No reason at all.

39
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,294
Police have no leads.
[clicks tongue]

40
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,546
- Tragic.
- Dad, what're you doing?

41
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,090
I guess four out
of seven million ain't so bad.

42
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:39,510
Headline should read,
"Millions Survive Night in New York."

43
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:42,138
Dad, stop. I get the point.
Here. Eat your eggs.

44
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,933
They're not eggs. They're egg whites.
And I'd rather eat the carton.

45
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,227
You lost six pounds
staying on this diet.

46
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:50,563
No fast food. No sausage.

47
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,858
I bought you some Lean Cuisine meals,
I put 'em in the freezer.

48
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:57,528
- My mouth is watering already.
- I lined your vitamins on the counter.

49
00:03:57,613 --> 00:04:01,699
- I don't take vitamins.
- You do now. Just take them.

50
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:05,411
And I put fresh batteries in the
TV remote and set the V.C.R. timer so...

51
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,788
Excuse me.
Am I missing something here?

52
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:12,084
I'm the parent. You're the child
running away to live by herself.

53
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:15,838
- I should be telling you how to live.
- Fine. How should I live?

54
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:19,091
- Simple. Don't go.
- [sighs]

55
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:23,554
I got that lrish Spring you like.
Oh. And Dad, whatever you do...

56
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,849
- Don't do the laundry.
- [muttering] Don't do the laundry.

57
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:29,435
Leave it by the dryer.
I'll do it every Sunday.

58
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,354
Ah, this is interesting.

59
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:35,608
The handrails on the subway system
could lead to an outbreak of plague.

60

Dad. Look.

61
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,657
You said I could be
whatever I wanna be.

62
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:46,118
I never said songwriter
in New York City. That's the exception.

63
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:49,747
You said anything,
and I believed you, so...

64
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,500

67
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:05,846
Violet, I saw how hard it was for your
mother when she didn't make it.

68
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:08,474
But if she was here,
she'd tell me to shut up,

69
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:12,228
wish you luck
and give you a big hug.

70
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:16,232
I'm not gonna give you a big hug,
and I'm not gonna wish you luck, but...

71
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,652
...I am gonna shut up, sit here
with my coffee and pretend to be mad.

72
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,154
Is that OK?

73

This is the last of it.

- Yeah, I got it.

- Good luck.

80

Even if you're not sure.

81

Mr. Sanford.

What do you think?

88
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:58,125
I had a feeling
you were gonna need this.

89

- What are you doing?
- It's just some emergency cash I saved.

Honey, from the looks of this place,
I'd say this is our emergency.

Well, I'm not taking it.

92
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:15,434

What is this?

97
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:30,616
It's just that all our lives,
you know, we always had

98
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,493
one thing in common, you and me.

99
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,704
What are you talking about?

100
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:39,875
It's like we said we wouldn't lose
our virginity until we got married,

101
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,169
and that didn't happen.

102
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:46,841
Then we said wed go to college orjunior
college, or dental hygienist school,

103
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,552
and that didn't happen.

104
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,557
We've never followed through
on a single thing, you know?

105
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,518
And I think that's
what makes us so special.

you were gonna move to New York.

My name is Wendy. I moved to New York
when I was 21 to be a dancer,

raising my daughter all by myself.

that she is a bisexual

130

than any person on this planet.

until I get published?

136
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,781

that would give you grounds

00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:22,408
you must know every band
on the East Coast.

169
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:26,870
The manager... of this club.

170
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,834
Um...

171
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:35,295
- You guys go ahead. I'll catch up.
- Sure thing...

172
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,215
...Mr. O'Donnell.

173
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,093
[clears throat]

174
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:44,263
I don't usually do this, Violet.

175
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:47,099
Um, but I...
l have a feeling about you.

176
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:51,645
So I'm gonna take your tape,
and I'm gonna see what I can do.

177
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:52,855
Thank you.

178
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,859
I can't believe how easy this was.

179
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,695
Neither can I.

180
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,698
Uh, you wanna go for
some coffee or something?

181
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,742
O'Donnell, who do I look like?
Your goddamn maid?

182
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,912
That's Mr. O'Donnell...

183
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,956
...but I'll let it slide this time.

184
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,750
I told you to take your stuff
home and wash it.

185
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:15,586
You got grease caked on the front.

186
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:21,383
Walt, I've warned you about
your attitude. You're fired.

187
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,218
Oh, you better not push me, kid.

188
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:28,223
I can find 100 other little punks like
you who can burn a turkey burger.

189
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,561
Minimum wage punk.

190
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,776
Maybe we should start over. Uh...

191
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:42,029
I'm Kevin O'Donnell...

192
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:45,741
...and I work the grill here
at the Fiji Mermaid Club.

193
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:50,412
I just made a complete fool of myself.

194
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,457
I was gonna tell you.

195
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:58,086
I'm almost sure
I would have told you.

196
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:02,341
I just want you to know
I'm not following you home.

197
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:05,928
I'm just walking myself
26 blocks in the wrong direction.

198
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:09,014
- I asked you to leave me alone.
- Did I mention how sorry I am?

199
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:12,059
Not that it's my fault.
You did throw yourself at me.

200
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:16,855
I didn't. I was pretending to be
innocent so you'd give me a break.

201
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,316
- Can I ask you a question?
- What?

202
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,528
Is there a reason we just walked
in a circle? Are you lost?

203
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,947
I'm not lost.
Somebody just moved my street.

204
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,867
You... You wanna play a game?

205
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,869
I bet I can guess
where you're from.

206
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:33,956
I'm about to get out
my pepper spray.

207
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,958
I reckon you're from a big city.

208
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,835
And there's no sign from here
of a belly button ring

209
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,338
or a tongue piercing.

210
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,215
I gotta go with Chicago.

211
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,218
OK. I've never had anyone
stare at my ass for half an hour,

212
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,262
so I'm gonna say good night.

213
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,430
And I'm hoping
you're gonna say it back.

214
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:55,227
OK. I can take a hint.

215
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,854
I really do know people
in the music business.

216
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:00,399
You just don't give up, do ya?

217
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,943
It was the sweet and innocent thing.
It did me in.

218
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,152
Good night, Kevin.

219
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:09,449
Just for the record, I was only staring
at your ass for the first 15 minutes.

220
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,081

00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,256
- I just want to leave this...
- William Morris. Please hold.

224

- It's a demo. I'm a songwriter.
- William Morris.

00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,677
I'll be right with you.

226
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:34,266
I just want to leave this
for Whitney and Mariah.

227
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,310
I'm sure they're friends of yours.

228
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,729
Look. I'm sure it sounds great
in your shower,

229
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,731
but karaoke ended a half hour ago.

230
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,608
If you'd like to get your songs heard

231
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:45,861
take them to an open mic night
just like everyone else.

232
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:50,657

233

I'll transfer.
You're not getting validated.

- Can I help you?
- Um...

235
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:26,526
Yeah, hi. Uh, I'm sure all your spaces
are filled for tonight.

236
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:30,447
I just wanted to come and check out what
this whole open mic thing was about.

237
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,658
I can squeeze you in in ten minutes.

238
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:36,870
A couple of my regulars, they called in
sick. So, uh, I've got spaces to fill.

239
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:40,582
I need you to sign your name
in here and get yourself ready.

Bathroom's around the corner
if you want to throw up.

242
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:50,342
Next up we have a young lady
named Violet Sanford.

243
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,344
So let's put our hands together

244

Cheer up. You look like somebody
ran over your dog.

Hey, um, how much
is a slice of pie?

Oh, uh...

the best French apple in town.

Hello. A naked girl in army boots?
Easy play to call.

00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,955
Piedmont, North Dakota.

- Are you kidding?

Pizza oven. Permanent burn
from pulling slices for four years.

That could be the saddest thing
I've ever heard.

What's next? You want a urine sample?

316
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,946
Ha, ha. I prefer blood.

317
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:06,783
Look, are you really the owner?
'Cause I've had a rough couple of days.

You start Friday night.

00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:27,429
Be there at 11:00.
That's when we get busy.

- You're giving me a job?
- I'm giving you an audition.

but would you mind telling me
why you're hiring me?

325
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:45,363
Because the average male
is walking around

326

with a toddler inside of his pants.

327
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:50,577
A two-year-old, right there
inside his Dockers.

328
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:54,664
Men have two-year-old children in their
pants? That's why you're hiring me?

329
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:57,792
You look like a kindergarten teacher.
The kids'll love it.

00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:20,117
- OK. Gimme a glass of water.
- OK.

502
00:35:20,202 --> 00:35:22,703
- He just ordered water.
- Yeah.

503
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:25,122
You know what to do.

504
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:28,292
Um...

505
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:32,797
Testing. Um, hey, everybody,
this guy just ordered water.

506
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:35,508
Do we serve water in our bar?

507
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:40,012
[crowd] Hell, no! H2O!
Hell, no! H2O!

508
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:42,473
[man splutters]

509
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,391
Jersey! No!

510
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,644
It's OK! Nobody orders water
in your bar!

511
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:50,731
He can order whatever he wants.
He's the fire marshal.

512
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:54,026
Mike, I'm so sorry. She's new.

513
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:57,947
I'm OK. Let's step outside.

514
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,910
Nice knowing you, Jersey.

515
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,955
Come on, you guys! Let me hear you!

516
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:11,001
You OK?

517
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:13,462
Who am I kidding? I can't do this.

518
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:15,464
Of course you can.
Now cheer up,

519
00:36:15,549 --> 00:36:19,051
because there's a really cute guy
at the bar asking for you.

520
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,178
Somebody's asking for me?

521
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:25,099
He says his name is Mr. O'Donnell.

522
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,978
He's hot.

523
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:39,822
Jersey, the fire marshal
threatened to shut me down.

524
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,949
He let me go with a $250 fine.

525
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,201
- I'm really sorry...
- I'll make you a deal.

526
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:46,537
You figure out a way
to make me 250 tonight,

527
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,831
I'll let you come back tomorrow.

528
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,375
Great.

529
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:56,547
- So much for sweet and innocent.
- So, you found me.

530
00:36:56,631 --> 00:37:00,342
Some guys at work told me
where I could look for Coyotes.

531
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:03,053
Take a good look,
because tonight's my last night.

532
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:04,138
I'm gonna get fired.

533
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:07,391
- Why?
- I have to make $250 in two hours.

534
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,435
It's completely impossible.

535
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,982
Here's nine dollars
just to get you started, OK?

536
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,985
I always like to help
a friend in need.

537
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:23,240
Why are you looking at me like that?

538
00:37:23,325 --> 00:37:26,577
Kevin, I don't want your money.

539
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:32,625
All right, uh, listen up, ladies.

540
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:35,252
The bidding will start at $25

541
00:37:35,337 --> 00:37:37,171
for one night only.

542
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:41,133

544
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:47,723
- No way.
- That's pretty cheap.

545
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,683
Violet, what are you doing?

546
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:52,478
You said you wanted to help,
so... turn around, sir...

547
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:55,356
let 'em take a look at ya.

548
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,066
Why are you doing this to me?

549
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:01,028
It's payback time, Mr. O'Donnell.

550
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,947
Now, turn around.

551
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,575
No, God, no. Don't do this.

552
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,661
Go on, show 'em what you've got.

553
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:10,996
Are you in?
Do you wanna do this?

554
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:13,415
- Ladies. What'll you give me?
- Twenty bucks.

Come on, girls. Do I hear $85?

00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:45,364
Ninety! Ninety-five dollars!

One hundred dollars!

566
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:54,206
That's it. You wanna
come home with Mama?

567
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,710

568
00:38:57,794 --> 00:39:00,004
Oh, yeah!

569
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:02,423
That's my boy.

570
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:05,592
- Oh, yeah. Shake it, shake it.
- $125 back here!

571
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:09,888
$140, right here.
Come on, come on.

572
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:17,855
My goodness, girls, come on.
One fifty and you'll see the butt.

573
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:20,482
Come on, girls.
You can do better than this.

574
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:22,860
One seventy-five.

575
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:24,028

- [Violet] There we go.
- Two hundred dollars!

577
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:34,997
- You've got right here!
- Two hundred and fifty dollars.

578
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:38,208
Sold, for $250!

579
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:44,673
- No!
- Come on up, honey. He's yours.

580
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,094
Damn you!

581
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:52,473
The blonde would have gone $275.

582
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:55,768
Come with me.

583
00:39:55,852 --> 00:40:00,898
You're gonna owe me big-time
for this one. That's $250 even.

584
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:07,488
- [woman] Mmm. Mmm!
- Oh.

587
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:25,547
- Can I ask you something?
- What?

588
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:29,635
What... What does "Coyote Ugly" mean?

589
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:34,098
Did you ever wake up sober
after a one night stand

590
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:37,267
and the person you're next to
is on your arm and they're so ugly

591
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:41,271
you'd rather chew off your arm
than wake them? That's coyote ugly.

592
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:42,606
Let's go, ladies.

593
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,651
Why would you name your bar
after something like that?

594
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:48,445
Well, because Cheers was taken.

595
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,447
Cabs are out front.

596
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:52,783
- You're rich, Jersey.
- See ya.

a passion for long walks, short-haired
hunting dogs and ltalian opera.

Her ex-husband is a CPA.
Her favorite artist is Van Gogh,

and her New Year's resolution
is to lose 15 pounds

603
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,595
and to see Barbra in concert.

604
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,431
OK. I owe you.

605
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:19,017

606
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:22,479
Well, it's 3:30 in the morning.
I want what every man wants.

607
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:26,150
Breakfast.

608
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:29,361
And that's it? I go to breakfast
with you and were even?

609
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:32,489
No. Were not even close to even,
because I danced on a bar,

610
00:41:32,574 --> 00:41:35,993
I took off my shirt,
and I unzipped my pants.

611
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:39,872
OK. Let's make a deal.
Breakfast and lunch.

612
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:43,917
- Breakfast, lunch and two dinners.
- That's four dates!

relationship I've had. Get in the car.

looks like were not gonna go anywhere.

- Hi, Kevin.

- Worth a thousand bucks.
- A comic book.

628
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:42,392
It's not a comic book. This is
the first appearance of The Punisher.

629
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:44,895
This is the holy grail of comic books.

630
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,731
You collect comic books.
That's so cute.

631
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:52,069
It's not cute.
It's very rugged and manly.

632
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:56,240
- It's just a bit geeky. Huh?
- I think it's sweet.

00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:02,996
[Violet] So, do you always eat breakfast
on the hood of your car?

What can I say? I'm a romantic.

635
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:08,168
You think this is romantic?

636
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:11,421
Well, you may not be feeling it now,
but I think one day

637
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:14,508
you'll be on stage singing
a song about this very night.

00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:18,178
Mmm. When We Were Downwind
<i>From a Trash Barge.</i>

Yeah. Catchy title. Hum a few bars.

640
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:26,395
Sorry to disappoint you
but I'm a songwriter, not a singer.

641
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:29,106
When I get on stage, I freeze.

642
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:32,734
What if the fate of the free world
rested on your voice?

643
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:36,238
OK. if the fate of the free world
depended on me singing...

644
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:38,407
...maybe.

645
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:41,285
All I ever really wanted
is to sit in the dark...

646
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:45,080
...and hear someone great
singing my songs.

647
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,082
I wanna be the one
who writes the music.

648
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:53,005
I remember the first time my mother
<i>played me Bridge Over Troubled Water</i>

649
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:56,383
by Simon and Garfunkel.

650
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:59,011
I remember exactly
what she was wearing.

651
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:04,391
I remember exactly how her hair smelled.
I remember exactly how I felt.

652
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:07,352
And every time I hear that song...

653
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:10,981
...I remember exactly
what she was wearing...

654
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,650
...and exactly how her hair smelled...

655
00:44:13,735 --> 00:44:15,861
...and exactly how I felt.

656
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,656
'Cause the great songs last forever.

657
00:44:19,741 --> 00:44:23,910
- So, what's the problem?
- Well...

658
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:26,705
...they tell me the only way
to get my songs heard

659
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,999
is to go out there
and sing 'em myself.

660
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:32,169
So we have to try fix
this little problem straightaway.

661
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:34,171
Hmm. And how do you propose
we do that?

662
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:38,175
Is there any place
you feel comfortable singing?

663
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:41,094
- The shower.
- We'll start there.

664
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,804
I don't care how long it takes,

665
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:45,974
how many hours we have to spend
in that shower. Let's get to it.

666
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:48,143
OK. Before we hit the showers,

667
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:50,979
maybe you could tell me

I'm from all over.
My family moved around a lot.

671
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:01,907
- Your family doesn't live in New York?
- Do you always ask questions?

672
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:04,201
Do you always dodge
this many questions?

673
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:07,454
At least tell me where you got
the moves you pulled tonight.

674

Well, if I told you,
I'd have to kill you.

All right. Put this on.
You're gonna need it.

Why? What are you talking about?

682

You're gonna help me
unload the next bin.

- No. it's not that bad, Vi.

684
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:40,237
- I do it all the time.
- Exactly how many jobs do you have?

685
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:43,031
Tuesday through Saturday,
I'm at the club.

I park cars at the Plaza.

my hands in that fishy bin.

I was gonna split the money with you.
A hundred bucks apiece.

A hundred bucks?

- Thanks, Dan.

$50, $25. Ready?

You smell really bad.

702
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:39,254
Well, so do you. I mean,
I was gonna kiss you goodbye,

703
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:40,964
but, um, I thought I might gag.

- I changed my mind about this kiss.

00:47:29,222 --> 00:47:32,516
I think we should give it a shot.

1009
01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:55,023
- What is that supposed to mean?
- The place is a joke.

1010
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:58,861
They don't come to watch you sing. They
come to watch girls shake it on a bar!

1011
01:09:58,945 --> 01:10:01,321
Would you have me
sing for quarters in the park?

1012
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:04,700
- You'd be singing your own songs.
- I told you I can't do that!

1013
01:10:04,784 --> 01:10:06,159
So stop pushing!

1014
01:10:06,244 --> 01:10:10,372
I'm just asking you to try, but I guess
that's asking a bit too much.

1015
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:13,709
Right. it's so easy to be you, isn't it?

1016
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:17,379
You have no dreams, no hopes,
no chance of getting hurt.

1017
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:20,549
When was the last time
you took a chance on something?

1018
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:23,635
- Some of us don't have that luxury.
- Why is that?

1019
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:31,518
Oh, right. We don't talk about you,
right? it's a big secret.

1020
01:10:31,603 --> 01:10:34,730
Come on, Kevin. Let's play a game.

1021
01:10:34,814 --> 01:10:37,149
I'm gonna guess why you left Australia.

1022
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:40,777
- Doesn't matter.
- You... were in jail.

1023
01:10:40,862 --> 01:10:42,070
No, that's not it.

1024
01:10:42,155 --> 01:10:45,115
You have a wife and four kids in Sydney.
Am I getting warm?

1025
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:49,244
Come on, Kevin. I don't have a lot of
time. Why'd you run away from home?

1026
01:10:49,329 --> 01:10:53,248
I didn't have a home.
Is that what you wanted to hear?

1027
01:10:53,333 --> 01:10:55,959
I don't have a family.

1028
01:10:56,044 --> 01:10:58,879
I mean, that's the big secret.
Are you happy?

1029
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:03,050
Huh? Are you gonna
feel sorry for me now?

1030
01:11:03,134 --> 01:11:07,179
You gonna hold me close while I tell you
I had to change homes every two years?

1031
01:11:08,306 --> 01:11:10,557
I had a bad childhood. Big deal.

1032
01:11:10,642 --> 01:11:13,435
I don't need your sympathy
'cause I'm here

1033

1034
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:18,106
That was my dream.

1035
01:11:18,191 --> 01:11:21,234
And at least I did it
with a little bit of dignity.

1036
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:25,989
And I didn't. That's it?

1037
01:11:26,074 --> 01:11:28,450
Just unbutton the blouse
and unzip the pants,

1038
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:31,078
show a little flesh,
I think you can figure it out.

I told you not to break the rules.

What are you talking about?

1046
01:12:05,113 --> 01:12:07,864
You and your boyfriend
making a scene in my bar.

with a broken nose.

1048
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:14,538
The rules were simple, Jersey.
I've fired girls for a lot less.

1049
01:12:14,622 --> 01:12:17,708
I can't have a boyfriend now?
What kind of stupid shit is that?

Hey! This place is my home.

I'm not willing to risk everything
I have on your personal life.

01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:26,299
- It's business.
- This is not business.

1053
01:12:26,384 --> 01:12:29,344
I worked my ass off for you,
you're supposed to be my friend.

1054
01:12:29,429 --> 01:12:31,304
I never said I was your friend.

1055
01:12:31,389 --> 01:12:34,433
I'm your boss, and you knew
the rules like everybody else.

1056
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:38,437
Will you stop with "the rules"?
It's a bar, for Christ's sake!

Because of me.

1159

Right after you were born,
she told me she wanted to quit...

...and I let her.
