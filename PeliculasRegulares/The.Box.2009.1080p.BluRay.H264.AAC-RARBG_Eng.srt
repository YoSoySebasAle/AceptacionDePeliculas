ARTHUR:
It's the doorbell.

5
00:01:36,384 --> 00:01:39,177
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hm.

What time is it?

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,269
Quarter to 6.

What are you offering?

174
00:15:06,902 --> 00:15:09,904
A financial opportunity.

175
00:15:10,071 --> 00:15:11,989
Let me explain.

176
00:15:13,658 --> 00:15:15,910
In this envelope, there is a key.

177
00:15:16,536 --> 00:15:18,245

178
00:15:19,623 --> 00:15:23,834
This key opens the glass dome
to the button unit.

179

Voilà.

180
00:15:31,218 --> 00:15:36,514
Now, if you push the button,
two things will happen.

181
00:15:36,765 --> 00:15:42,686
First, someone, somewhere in the world,
whom you don't know...

182
00:15:42,854 --> 00:15:44,104
...will die.

183
00:15:46,566 --> 00:15:48,108
Second...

184
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,278
...you will receive a payment...

185
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,698
...of 1 million dollars.

186
00:15:55,951 --> 00:15:57,535
Tax-free.

187
00:16:01,665 --> 00:16:06,544
The payment will be delivered to you
by me...

188
00:16:07,587 --> 00:16:09,296
...in cash.

189
00:16:09,965 --> 00:16:12,758
Just as you see here.

190
00:16:18,598 --> 00:16:20,891
Oh, and Mrs. Lewis, please permit me...

191
00:16:21,476 --> 00:16:26,981
...to present to you this crisp
100-dollar bill as a gift...

192
00:16:27,148 --> 00:16:30,651
...in exchange for your kindness
in allowing me into your home.

193
00:16:36,491 --> 00:16:39,326
NORMA: You're gonna give me
this 100-dollar bill...

194
00:16:40,203 --> 00:16:41,453
...even if I say no?

195
00:16:41,871 --> 00:16:43,831
That is correct.

196
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:48,627
Are you for real?

197
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,839
Oh, I assure you, Mrs. Lewis...

198
00:16:52,007 --> 00:16:55,634
...this offer is quite real.

199
00:16:57,053 --> 00:16:59,513
Well, who do you work for?

200
00:16:59,681 --> 00:17:04,476
Guarantee of payment
comes with three restrictions, I'm afraid.

201
00:17:04,853 --> 00:17:07,855
One, I am not permitted...

202
00:17:08,023 --> 00:17:12,526
...to disclose any information
about the identity of my employers.

203
00:17:12,694 --> 00:17:18,365
Two, you are not permitted
to discuss the details of this with anyone...

204
00:17:18,533 --> 00:17:21,368
...except your husband, of course.

205
00:17:21,536 --> 00:17:25,456
Three, you have 24 hours.

206
00:17:27,542 --> 00:17:31,378
You have until 5:00 tomorrow
to make your decision.

207
00:17:31,546 --> 00:17:33,213
At which point...

208
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:37,801
...I shall return
and retrieve the button unit.

209
00:17:37,969 --> 00:17:39,928
It will be reprogrammed...

210
00:17:40,096 --> 00:17:45,309
...and the offer will be made
to someone else.

211
00:17:47,103 --> 00:17:50,356
It's been a pleasure meeting you,
Mrs. Lewis.

212
00:18:02,744 --> 00:18:05,704
- It's a new prosthesis for her foot.
- You got it.

213

the new GE Silastic polymer...

WENDELL: Nice, pal.
- Thank you.

216
00:18:13,088 --> 00:18:15,923
Hey. What happened to her foot?

217
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,472
When she was 17,
her brother dropped a barbell on her foot.

218
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,059
She thinks one of her toes is broken,
so she goes to the hospital.

219
00:18:27,227 --> 00:18:30,020
The doctor sets her in a chair,
turns the x-ray machine on...

220
00:18:30,188 --> 00:18:32,731
...then goes to check on another
patient down the hall.

221
00:18:33,108 --> 00:18:35,401
And he forgets all about Norma.

222

224
00:18:40,031 --> 00:18:42,658
- That's not good.
- No.

225
00:18:43,118 --> 00:18:46,704
The tissue in four of her toes
was completely destroyed by the radiation.

226
00:18:47,163 --> 00:18:48,956
They had to amputate four of her toes?

227
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:53,001
Yep. Then they had to go in
and get skin from her inner thigh...

228
00:18:53,169 --> 00:18:54,837
...to cover the front of her foot.

229
00:18:55,004 --> 00:18:59,633
This is back in 1958, so they didn't
have the skin-graft techniques they do now.

230
00:18:59,801 --> 00:19:03,929
And she had to sit like this,
the same position...

231
00:19:04,097 --> 00:19:08,225
...full body cast, for a month,
waiting for it to heal.

232
00:19:08,393 --> 00:19:10,477
Jesus. I hope she sued this idiot.

233
00:19:11,229 --> 00:19:13,105
Oh, yeah. Her family sued and they won.

234
00:19:13,273 --> 00:19:16,650
- What was the settlement?
- Ten thousand dollars.

235
00:19:18,194 --> 00:19:20,904

she can start jogging again.

00:56:40,017 --> 00:56:42,727
July 20, 1969...

689
00:56:43,562 --> 00:56:47,023
...we received a transmission
from the Moon telling us:

690
00:56:47,191 --> 00:56:50,235
"The Eagle has landed."

691
00:56:50,403 --> 00:56:54,489
Today's landing, like that one,
represents the realization of a dream...

692
00:56:54,657 --> 00:56:58,368
...that has long excited
mankind's imagination.

693
00:56:58,536 --> 00:57:03,373
And this mission offers the possibility
of a momentous discovery...

694
00:57:03,541 --> 00:57:05,917
...in the history of mankind:

695
00:57:06,085 --> 00:57:09,045
The existence of life
elsewhere in the universe.

696
00:57:10,673 --> 00:57:17,137
If the experiments ofVikings 1 and 2
do not reveal living organisms...

697
00:57:17,304 --> 00:57:19,764
...they will learn other secrets
of the universe.

698
00:57:19,932 --> 00:57:23,643
They will tell us a good many things
about our own planet...

699
00:57:23,811 --> 00:57:27,188
...opening up new possibilities
for exploration...

700
00:57:27,356 --> 00:57:31,526
...and should produce knowledge
that will improve the quality of life...

701
00:57:31,694 --> 00:57:33,695
...right here on Earth.

702
00:57:34,196 --> 00:57:39,409
Our achievements in space represent
not only the height of technological skill...

703
00:57:39,577 --> 00:57:44,289
...they also reflect the best
in our country...

704
00:57:44,457 --> 00:57:48,251
...our character,
the capacity for creativity and sacrifice...

705
00:57:48,419 --> 00:57:51,129
...and a willingness
to reach into the unknown.

On our field trip to the Kennedy Center
in D.C.

709
00:58:05,686 --> 00:58:07,896
Right. And she said
she lives in Richmond?

Yeah, we rode back on the same bus.

Okay. This is her driver's license.

Her name is Sarah Matthews.

She lives in Boston.

Hello, Norma.

01:00:01,886 --> 01:00:03,261
Hello.

719
01:00:03,721 --> 01:00:07,473
Did your husband tell you
where he was going this morning?

720
01:00:08,809 --> 01:00:10,143
No, he didn't.

721
01:00:10,311 --> 01:00:13,938
I hope for your sake
he isn't playing detective again.

722
01:00:14,106 --> 01:00:17,525
Though I assure you, I'll know if he is.

723
01:00:17,693 --> 01:00:19,944
Because of your employees?

724
01:00:20,654 --> 01:00:22,947
Is Dana one of your employees?

As I've told you, I have many employees.

That is correct.

738
01:01:55,374 --> 01:02:00,211
The activities will occasionally
involve NASA employees...

01:02:00,379 --> 01:02:03,423
...but I am not at liberty to disclose
how they will be involved...

...or what they will be doing.

to run that license plate yet?

Yeah, I did.
It's a government-issued license plate.

01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:24,235

This guy's wife, she was shot once
in the chest. Point-blank range.

750
01:02:39,418 --> 01:02:42,253
Whoever shot her
held a gun directly to her chest...

751
01:02:42,421 --> 01:02:45,256
...and fired the bullet
straight through her heart.

Oh, God.

No.

There's no other way.

There's no...

What?

1062

he smiled at us.

- Yeah.

I'm so sorry for what I did to us.

1067
01:42:26,803 --> 01:42:29,638
You didn't do anything. We did it.

1068
01:42:30,223 --> 01:42:31,724
So don't apologize.

we've lived together.

I'm gonna push it.
