1
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:44,820
They're heading for beverley manor.

2
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:47,518
Both of you, wait for me at the
gallows tree, and be ready to travel.

3
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,830
Pablo, get some water and provisions,
and make sure the coast road is clear.

4
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:52,206
Now, let's move fast.

5
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,857
Edward.

6
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,678
The company commanded by colonel judd
will be here within the hour.

7
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:22,702
Everything arranged?

8
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,951
Yes, father. Two of my men
will escort the king.

9
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,363
- Who are they?
- Duncannon and fitzroy, sir.

10
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:29,339
They'll take the coast road
through the forest.

11
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:33,119
Ah, Jacob. Ask the king
to be ready to leave immediately.

12
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:34,415
Yes, sir.

13
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,835
- Are you ready to leave with us?
- I'm staying.

14
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,463
- They'll kill you, father.
- It's a chance I have to take.

15
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,253
- We must gain time.
- Have you forgotten that judd is your...

16
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,588
Edward!

17
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,176
Constance.

18
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,038
You will take your
brother and sister with you.

19
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,848
- And you, sir?
- I have made my plans.

20
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,104
Look after her.

21
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,523
And, whatever you do,
keep to the forest.

22
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,773
And remember that you and Philip
were both reported killed at Preston.

23
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,271
The ironsides need never know
your true identity.

24
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,481
Now, go.

25
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,487
But father, what are your plans?

26
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,202
Don't worry about me, my child.

27
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,281
Goodbye, Philip. Edward.

28
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,412
Oh, but please, father!

29
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,409
What'll happen to you?

30
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,255
I'm waiting for colonel judd.

31
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,253
Our distance, captain?

32
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,256
About a mile, sir.

33
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,701
Our friends are a little early.

34
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,077
Yes, sire.

35
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:14,057
At the halt, by the left,
move column of troops!

36
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,756
Where is Charles Stuart?

37
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,178
Beverley: The king is where you,

38
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,388
and traitors like you,
will never find him.

39
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,050
Hmm.

40
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:00,648
In the name of cromwell,
I arrest you

41
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,691
for conspiracy against the state.

42
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,519
Bring him inside.

43
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,235
Close the doors.

44
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,990
Why did beverley
call judd a traitor?

45
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,248
When you've been in the troop
a little longer, my friend,

46
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,793
you'll learn that our beloved colonel
fights with the hand that pays him best.

47
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,541
Can't say I blame him.

48
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,427
You'd better search the house, Wyatt.

49
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,421
Detail six men to help you.

50
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:36,054
Beautiful. Quite beautiful.

51
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,471
Your daughter, is it not,
colonel beverley?

52
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:41,609
Hmm?

53
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,398
Well, now, are you going to
tell me what I want to know?

54
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,230
If you don't, you'll die.

55
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:49,440
So will she.

56
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,866
Only more slowly.

57
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,449
Tell me where I can find the king,

58
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,747
and you'll both be granted
a free pardon.

59
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm waiting.

60
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,878
What's your answer?

61
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,631
My answer is simple.

62
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,217
I commend you, and the
murdering despot cromwell,

63
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,265
who is your master,
to the bottomless pit of hell,

64
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:13,930
where you will surely go!

65
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,715
Long live the king!

66
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,729
Thank you, Edward beverley.

67
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,190
And you, Philip.

68
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,071
May god be with you always.

69
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:48,089
I want to remind you, gentlemen,
that this district is the core

70
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:51,085
of the strongest royalist resistance
in the country.

71
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,174
It is my duty to stamp it out.

72
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,391
We are to remain here
until the last royalist is hanged.

73
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:01,682
All right, that's all.

74
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,767
Captain Sylvester, our operations
for the following week

75
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,601
will be for troop a

76
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,445
to cover this area here.

77
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:15,025
Troop b here, troop c here,

78
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,322
troop d to remain at
headquarters in reserve.

79
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:20,372
- And Charles Stuart, sir?
- Issue a proclamation.

80
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,498
Cryer: Hear ye!

81
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,873
Hear ye!

82
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,705
Hear ye!

83
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:34,674
To whoever shall bring
information to the state,

84
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:40,013
leading to the apprehension
of the traitor Charles Stuart,

85
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,844
the state offers a reward

86
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,438
of one hundred guineas.

87
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:50,944
And to whoever shall
withhold such information,

88
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,105
the penalty is death.

89
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:58,448
You say you recognised
Charles Stuart?

90
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,327
How?

91
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,952
Well, er... begging your pardon,
your honour,

92
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:06,035
it was the man who was with him
that gave me the, er... inkling,

93
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,835
as you might say.

94
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,172
Calling him "sire"
and "your majesty".

95
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,715
- Lieutenant hawke?
- Sir.

96
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,293
- Take a troop to the coast road.
- Yes, sir.

97
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,803
All right, you can go.

98
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,347
Er... your honour, ah...

99
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,353
Begging your pardon, your honour...
Well?

100
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,857
I performed my duty as a loyal citizen.
Yes.

101
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:33,653
Ah, there's the small question
of the reward.

102
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,946
What about it?

103
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,866
Well, er... when will it
please your honour

104
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,030
to permit me to collect it?

105
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,414
If your information leads us
to Charles Stuart

106
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,584
you're entitled to your reward.

107
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,623
Ah, thank you, your honour.

108
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,626
It'll be presented to you...
In public.

109
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:57,928
Oh, your honour, please,
not in public.

110
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,174
Why not, pray?

111
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,514
Well... the people...

112
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,966
They'd kill me.

113
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,807
Many of them are misguided enough
to retain allegiance to the king.

114
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:10,148
I... I mean the...
The traitor, Charles Stuart.

115
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,271
If they so much as suspect
what I've done,

116
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,268
I shall need protection!

117
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,362
You'll get your protection.

118
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,905
Thank you, your honour.

119
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,865
Captain Sylvester, make arrangements

120
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,490
for this man to be
confined in the village jail.

121
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:26,448
- Indefinitely.
- But... your honour!

122
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,324
No-one'll get at you there.

123
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,035
- Captain Sylvester.
- Sir.

124
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,995
- Please show him out, will you?
- Yes, sir.

125
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,588
Your honour, I...

126
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,463
Take him away!

127
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,589
If our friend's information
should prove false,

128
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,203
- you may hang him.
- It will be a pleasure.

129
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,138
I like a man to be
paid in his own coin.

130
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:49,312
Yes, indeed.
If I had my way with traitors, I'd...

131
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,765
You were saying?

132
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:53,896
It was of no consequence.

133
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,609
Don't confuse a collaborator
with a so-called traitor.

134
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,231
One is a snivelling coward,

135
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,238
seeking to enrich himself
or to save his own skin.

136
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:10,205
The other may find himself
ideologically disposed to change sides.

137
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,243
Do you understand?

138
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,918
Every man has a reason
for switching his allegiance.

139
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,133
Only he can adjust
the rights and wrongs of the matter

140
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,302
to his own conscience.

141
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:23,846
My daughter'll be arriving
in a minute.

142
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,162
She'll be staying here at the manor.
You'd better go and expound

143
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,973
some of your
admirable philosophy to her.

144
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,957
And how is my beautiful Clare?

145
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,672
I'm well, thank you, Tom.

146
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:06,055
- My father?
- Oh, he's... his usual, shall we say?

147
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,595
- I'm worried about him.
- Oh?

148
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,602
His reputation is spreading
over the whole country.

149
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,565
Everywhere he goes, he leaves
a trail of hatred behind him.

150
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,813
- Well, he's waiting for you now, anyway.
- Wait, Tom.

151
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,103
- Yes?
- Where's colonel beverley?

152
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,356
You'd better ask your father.

153
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,190
Aren't you still in his confidence?

154
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:27,114
Oh, yes. I'm very much
the blue-eyed boy.

155
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,575
In fact, it may interest you to know

156
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,782
he now looks upon me
in the role of...

157
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:32,876
Son-in-law.

158
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,867
At least, that's the impression he gives.

159
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,828
- That's a pity.
- Oh. Why?

160
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:40,165
- I don't enjoy disappointing people.
- Not even your father?

161
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,257
Not even my father.

162
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,089
Judd: Clare.

163
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,212
Sylvester, please excuse us.

164
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:02,986
Corporal!

165
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,357
Did you make your journey
to see me,

166
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:09,035
or to ask after the health
of an enemy of the state?

167
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:15,037
Colonel beverley's only crime
was one of loyalty to his king.

168
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:18,578
Oh, very touching tribute
to his memory.

169
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:22,961
His only crime, as you put it, was
sufficient to sign his death warrant.

170
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,967
You didn't lose much time,
did you, father?

171
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,807
My duty lies in
the service of cromwell.

172
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,635
Your duty!

173
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,305
When you first changed sides,

174
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,938
I tried to push your ignoble actions
to the back of my mind.

175
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:42,897
I tried to delude myself

176
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,947
that you had some reason,
other than greed, for what you did.

177
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:49,864
But now...
Now, I see you very clearly.

178
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,571
A traitor, a murderer,

179
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:56,165
cringing to master cromwell for a favour,
or a crumb from his table.

180
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,918
How dare you speak to me like that?

181
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,675
Now, you listen to me
carefully, Clare.

182
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,757
Cromwell has appointed me
officer in charge of the district,

183
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,302
chief intendant of the forest,
and magistrate.

184
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,302
I intend to exercise
those powers to the utmost

185
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:19,556
in the service of the lord protector,
who recognises my ability.

186
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,442
If I have forgotten
that I was once a royalist,

187
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,605
it is because I now believe
in the new order.

188
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,199
And, whether you
believe in it or not,

189
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,152
you will conform.

190
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,406
Do you understand me?

191
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:39,868
Yes, father.

192
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:42,795
I understand you.

193
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,185
Sylvester: Colonel.

194
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,478
We have a very special guest.

195
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,013
Get him to Hampton court.
See to it.

196
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:36,903
- Sylvester: And the other two?
- Shoot them.

197
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,347
Take him away.

198
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,896
Bring the other two to
the stable yard, wait for me.

199
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:43,598
Order a firing squad!

200
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,029
Judd: Jacob, leave them.

201
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,824
Remain where you are.

202
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,706
Officer: By the left, halt!

203
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,750
Right turn!

204
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:14,721
Prepare to load! Load!

205
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,264
Take aim!

206
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,976
Fire!

207
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,544
What's happened?

208
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:45,343
Father's dead.

209
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,763
Oh, no!

210
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,395
Colonel judd? Yes.

211
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,686
And the king's been taken.

212
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,382
As far as the roundheads
are concerned,

213
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,112
they don't even know we exist.

214
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,735
Jacob has been pressed into
the service of colonel judd,

215
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:05,067
so, for the time being,
he can come and go as he pleases.

216
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:08,154
Jacob, you'll bring us
whatever information you can.

217
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:11,582
Disposition of troops,
movement of transport and officials.

218
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,868
We'll hit them, wherever we can,

219
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:16,917
with bullets, fire and steel.

220
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,089
These are not haphazard raids.

221
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,176
They're skilfully designed
and executed.

222
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:57,138
But by whom?

223
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,190
Well?

224
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:07,694
The man you're looking for, sir,
is known as the Scarlet blade,

225
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:11,452
but you won't find anyone
in the district to betray him.

226
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,198
You had better look to yourselves.

227
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:30,588
They are taking more people
for questioning.

228
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:34,217
Officer:
Squad, halt! Stand at ease!

229
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,348
Stay where you are.

230
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:45,482
Whichever of you is present,

231
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:48,522
answer your names,
and stand over by the door.

232
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:50,066
- Parsons?
- Aye.

233
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:51,943
Over by the door.

234
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,611
- Fingle?
- Aye.

235
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,279
By the door.

236
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,536
The gypsy, Pablo?

237
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,543
The gypsy, Pablo!

238
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,789
Take 'em outside.

239
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,795
Officer: Squad! Attention!

240
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:13,722
Forward!

241
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,324
It's all right.

242
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,621
John drury!

243
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,327
Didn't mean to alarm you.

244
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,783
Quick, now, what news of the king?

245
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:43,377
I... I found a directive
from cromwell to my father.

246
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,879
He's to be lodged for
two weeks at Hampton court,

247
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,297
and then moved to the tower.

248
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:48,874
We'll try a rescue then.

249
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:50,864
Meantime, there's work
to be done here,

250
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:52,753
with getting refugees
away to the coast.

251
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,118
But when they reach the forest,
they must have help: Food, water,

252
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:58,054
and a place to rest, if possible.
Now, if you can't do this on your own,

253
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,181
you must find somebody
you can trust to help you.

254
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:04,586
Take this and study it.
It's the place of the next rendezvous.

255
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,213
Twelve men and women will be arriving
at midnight, the day after tomorrow.

256
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:08,632
Two of them are
personal friends of the king,

257
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:10,216
they are trying to arrange
for his asylum in France.

258
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,071
Hide quickly!
He's coming in here.

259
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,370
Clare?

260
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:17,904
My horse went lame. I... 1...

261
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,826
This man assisted me
at the stable.

262
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:23,037
Thank you for your help.

263
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,857
Would you give him
a few pennies for me, Tom?

264
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,087
A few pennies?

265
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:29,544
What did he have to do?
Carry the horse?

266
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,926
Get out.

267
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,346
Which leg was it?

268
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,140
Leg?

269
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,054
I thought you said she was lame.

270
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:43,350
- The near hind leg.
- I see.

271
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:00,363
You know, horses are no more
to be trusted than women.

272
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,036
This one's an old faker.
I'd have her shot if I were you.

273
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,249
Clare?

274
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,927
I would change my coat
for you any day.

275
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:26,310
No, wait. Please, trust me.

276
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:38,951
Who is it?

277
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,795
Good evening, Clare.

278
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:53,131
I've come to escort you
to dinner.

279
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,333
Allow me.

280
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:56,156
I'm not ready yet.
Would you wait outside, please?

281
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,387
No, I'll wait in here,
if you don't mind.

282
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:02,428
Get out, immediately.

283
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:04,514
You're looking very beautiful
tonight, Clare.

284
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,477
- Will you leave?
- No.

285
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,401
- Who are you ringing for?
- My maid.

286
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,778
If you haven't gone
by the time she comes,

287
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:18,399
I'll get her to fetch my father.

288
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:20,453
Do you know something?

289
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,448
I love you even more
when you're angry.

290
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,496
It does something for your complexion.

291
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:30,748
All I want to do is help you,

292
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,379
and I'm giving you no choice.

293
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,296
Let's put our cards on the table.

294
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:38,468
You're aiding royalists
to escape the country,

295
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,075
and you've been doing it
for some time.

296
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,965
I also happen to have
a good memory for faces, Clare.

297
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:46,389
I remember the face of the man
you were talking to in the stable.

298
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,516
Major John drury.

299
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:52,016
You see, we were in the
same company before the war.

300
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:56,312
- What do you propose to do?
- Nothing. Help you.

301
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,739
- And if I refuse your help?
- Then call your father.

302
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,699
You can tell him about me, and...

303
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:03,569
I'll acquaint him about you.

304
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:07,448
I'm sure the news will do
something for his complexion as well.

305
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:12,791
It's all right, Mary.
I needed some fresh perfume.

306
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:14,413
I found it.

307
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:20,214
Is it a bargain?

308
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,931
- In return for your help?
- Nothing.

309
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,478
I'm merely content
to be around you,

310
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,106
watching you like
a guardian angel.

311
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:40,523
What greater love
hath man than this?

312
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:44,819
You know, if you weren't so
overwhelmed by your own charms,

313
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,221
I might grow to like you a little better.

314
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,492
You will.

315
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:50,658
I promise.

316
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,086
Tom, I want you to
understand one thing.

317
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:00,584
If we're to work together,

318
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:02,344
it's for the whole country.

319
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,634
It isn't for us.

320
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,428
Don't change your coat
just for the adventure.

321
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:09,886
You'll be serving
the king and his people.

322
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,725
Do it with your heart.

323
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,810
Now, shall we go to dinner?

324
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:39,794
It looks as if we're in for
a hilarious evening, doesn't it?

325
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:09,380
Judd:
The lord protector, Oliver cromwell.

326
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,839
All: Oliver cromwell.

327
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:31,656
Two of the men they questioned
this morning died under torture.

328
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:34,245
- Indeed.
- Glad I wasn't detailed.

329
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:37,411
Three men were branded.
Another man was tied...

330
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,333
Allow me to compliment you, Wyatt,

331
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:42,504
on your delicate choice
of dinner conversation.

332
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:59,417
I'm captain Blake, from the
Garrison at westerly, sir.

333
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,669
This afternoon, we were attacked,
and the station burned to the ground.

334
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,755
- By whom?
- There were about 30 men, sir, against 12...

335
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,986
I asked by whom were you attacked?!

336
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,963
He's in the grounds.
Call out the guards!

337
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,711
Get after him, every one of you.

338
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,049
Sound the alarm!

339
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,345
The Scarlet blade.

340
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,867
- Well?
- He's got away, sir.

341
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,807
Ten officers and a hundred men
on duty in the grounds,

342
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:39,196
and you let him get away?!

343
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,205
Someone's going to answer for this.

344
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,958
I want a full investigation.
How did he get into the grounds?

345
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,207
How did he slip past the guards?

346
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:47,746
Mmm?

347
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:51,379
I think I can tell you.

348
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:55,299
This man, who calls himself
the Scarlet blade,

349
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:58,094
knows every inch
of this estate. Why?

350
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:01,138
Because he was once a
member of this household.

351
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:02,932
It's quite simple logic.

352
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,847
You still wonder who he is?

353
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:08,726
I think I can show you.

354
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,736
That's your Scarlet blade.

355
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:21,742
The late master of beverley himself
was cromwell's most bitter enemy.

356
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:26,251
He once told me he would fight our
lord protector even from the grave.

357
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:29,170
That's precisely what he is doing.

358
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:30,793
Well, gentlemen?

359
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:33,796
Your logic is indeed
admirable, colonel, but...

360
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:35,089
But what?

361
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:38,255
Beverley's two sons were
reported killed at Preston.

362
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:42,055
I'm aware of that.
They were reported killed.

363
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,803
- Did you see the bodies?
- No, sir.

364
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:46,479
Most of you fought at Preston.

365
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:49,020
Did any of you identify the bodies?

366
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:51,769
By whom were they reported killed?

367
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,275
I can tell you.

368
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,074
By a prisoner of war.

369
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:02,203
I received the news myself,
and recall a certain feeling of elation,

370
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,201
which overruled
any doubt in my mind.

371
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:07,830
Subsequently, that prisoner,
whose name was major John drury,

372
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,331
escaped,

373
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,497
and has been a Thorn
in our sides ever since.

374
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,923
- Well, Sylvester?
- Oh, excellent, colonel.

375
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:19,588
May I compliment you
on the brilliance of your deduction.

376
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:21,673
We now know who
the Scarlet blade is.

377
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,554
This is indeed revelation.

378
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:27,429
However, sir, if I, with your permission,
might ask one small question?

379
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:31,016
- Permission granted.
- How is it going to help us find him?

380
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:34,774
We will resume dinner, gentlemen.

381
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:42,744
May the best man win.

382
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,040
I'd like to know what you're thinking.

383
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:57,542
I'm thinking about the Scarlet blade,

384
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,670
he seems like a lad
after my own heart.

385
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:09,346
If we can enlist
Edward beverley's help,

386
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:12,599
we'll have created a link between
this house and a forest escape route.

387
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:13,729
Go on.

388
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:17,020
There's a secret passage leads
from the house to the forest edge.

389
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:18,863
How did you discover that?

390
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:22,280
The other night, I saw Jacob
enter the passage, so I followed him.

391
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:26,872
Tom, why would an old servant
of the beverley family use it?

392
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:28,699
To meet his master.

393
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:33,583
Wait, you've given me
the germ of an idea.

394
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,872
If you're prepared
to risk Jacob's neck,

395
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:38,341
I think I know how we can
use him to find Edward beverley.

396
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:41,552
- How?
- I'll tell you if my plan works.

397
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:43,676
I've got to go and see your father.

398
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,595
I'm trusting you, Tom.

399
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,972
You'll have to trust me, won't you?

400
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:54,566
Sylvester: And in the forest,
this traditional place of execution,

401
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:56,735
known as the gallows tree.

402
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,273
And if, as I suspect,

403
00:35:58,365 --> 00:36:01,027
Jacob is an accomplice
of the Scarlet blade,

404
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:03,859
then there'll be an attempt at rescue.

405
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:06,448
We shall be waiting for him.

406
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,830
- It's quite ingenious.
- Thank you, colonel.

407
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:13,702
I had a letter today
from the lord protector.

408
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:17,126
In the first paragraph,
he congratulated me

409
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:18,707
upon securing the arrest of the king,

410
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:20,588
but in the second,
he deplored the fact

411
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,886
that the Scarlet blade
was still at large.

412
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:27,345
If your little ruse results
in the capture of this man,

413
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:29,763
I shall bring your name
to cromwell's notice.

414
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,264
- Thank you.
- Hmm.

415
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:34,143
- Like a glass of Sherry?
- Please.

416
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,022
We will dispense with
the formalities of a trial.

417
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:41,946
The old man should be arrested at once,
and notice of his execution posted,

418
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,740
so that the news reaches
Edward beverley in good time.

419
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,819
Execution to take place
at noon tomorrow.

420
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:51,448
Of course, I could be wrong.
Jacob could be quite blameless.

421
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:55,042
In which case, we shall have
hanged an innocent man.

422
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,503
That would be most distressing,
wouldn't it?

423
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:00,965
Still, I fear that is a hazard
we shall have to risk.

424
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,758
Yes, indeed, colonel.

425
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:06,971
But, of course, we could always
console ourselves with the idea that

426
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:09,929
Jacob died in a very good cause,
couldn't we?

427
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,442
I've told you. Listen!

428
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:27,238
It's not only your life
I'm concerned with.

429
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,652
It's the life of the man you serve.

430
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:32,906
Where can I find him?

431
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,418
You know what'll happen, don't you?

432
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:39,233
He'll try to save you,
and get cut to pieces

433
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,373
before he gets within
thirty yards of the tree.

434
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,793
Then they'll hang you anyway.

435
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:48,509
If I wanted to trap Edward beverley,

436
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:51,383
I'd let him walk into the ambush
they're preparing for him.

437
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:55,346
If I let this happen, both he
and all his friends will be caught.

438
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,437
Don't you understand this, Jacob?

439
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:07,528
How can I find him?

440
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,734
Well?

441
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,905
I hope I can trust you.

442
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:17,325
How can I find him?

443
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:21,705
- You've heard of the dragon's tree?
- Yes, I know it.

444
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,586
There's a footpath close by.

445
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,125
Follow it.

446
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,798
It takes you deep into the forest.

447
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,554
You will come to an old oast house.

448
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:33,174
There, you will find Edward beverley.

449
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:38,972
I'll need something
to prove I'm a friend.

450
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,441
This ring.

451
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,611
Master Edward himself
gave it to me.

452
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,198
Take it.

453
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,658
Why do you want
to help us, captain?

454
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:02,002
Let us just say
my heart's in the royalist cause.

455
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,792
Your heart?

456
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,169
Your sword fights for cromwell.

457
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:08,384
How did the two
become disconnected?

458
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,803
My royalist cause
happens to be a lady.

459
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,409
She helped me to see
the error of my ways.

460
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:15,049
- Who is the lady?
- The daughter of colonel judd.

461
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,851
- Judd?
- And don't condemn her because of her father.

462
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:20,267
At least she didn't turn traitor.

463
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,270
It's on account of her
that I came to see you here,

464
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:25,268
and, because of her,
that you can trust me.

465
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,605
As for trusting you,
I shall reserve my judgement.

466
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,156
What is your plan?

467
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:36,867
This is the gallows tree,
and here, the path leading to it.

468
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:49,751
They are coming.
“What about the soldiers?

469
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:52,048
They're waiting for us,
both sides of the gallows tree.

470
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:53,796
Right. Get to work!

471
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:13,592
Officer: Troop, dismount!

472
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,329
It's taking them
a long time getting back.

473
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:25,702
I hope nothing's gone wrong.

474
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:27,951
They had the element
of surprise on their side.

475
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:30,412
Don't blame me if they didn't
take full advantage of it.

476
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,664
Here they are now.

477
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:42,048
Edward!

478
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:45,393
Pablo!

479
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:48,888
This is captain Sylvester.

480
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:52,017
Captain Sylvester,
this is my brother, Philip.

481
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:54,860
- I'm glad to see you alive, Jacob.
- Thanks to you, sir.

482
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:56,717
Philip, tell the men
to make themselves scarce,

483
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:57,981
and double the sentries.

484
00:42:58,076 --> 00:42:59,236
Shall we go in?

485
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:04,236
Clare, this is Edward beverley.

486
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:09,159
I'm afraid our hospitality
is a little rough.

487
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:13,421
I gather some of my father's soldiers
have already experienced it.

488
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:15,589
Let us get to
the point of the meeting.

489
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:22,180
You may know I have been helping to organise
escape routes for royalist refugees.

490
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,757
But there are limits
to what I can do for them.

491
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:26,930
I can direct them to the forest,

492
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:29,228
I can show them the way
to the coast road, but...

493
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,306
Beyond that, they have to
fend for themselves.

494
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:34,810
Some of them have been taken because
they lack arms to defend themselves.

495
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,603
I can supply them with arms,
and occasionally an escort.

496
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:39,488
Good.

497
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:42,817
Now, this is a matter
which concerns us even more.

498
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:45,244
The king is being lodged
at Hampton court.

499
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:48,706
In two weeks, or even less,
he may be moved to the tower.

500
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:50,783
This'll be our last opportunity
to rescue him.

501
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:53,453
He'll have an escort
of at least a hundred men.

502
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:55,584
A well-prepared ambush
will take care of them.

503
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:56,915
Indeed.

504
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:01,378
A party of royalist refugees will be
arriving tonight at twelve o'clock.

505
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,758
They'll be waiting
at the beverley crossroads.

506
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:07,759
Some of them are old men,
women, and children.

507
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:10,220
- Can you find ponies for them?
- Constance?

508
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:14,190
- Well, we've got four broken in.
- That'll have to do.

509
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:17,985
Now I know where to find you.

510
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:23,782
Goodbye, Edward.

511
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:26,736
We must be gone.

512
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:39,965
Edward beverley is being
supplied with information

513
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:42,338
by someone inside these walls.

514
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:45,467
How else could he have
countered the trap I set for him?

515
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,244
What have you got to say,
lieutenant hawke?

516
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:50,010
We didn't stand a chance, sir.
We were attacked by an ambush

517
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,144
that must have been prepared
long before we arrived.

518
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:54,126
- Heard the news, captain Sylvester?
- Yes, sir.

519
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:55,481
Ten men killed!

520
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,771
Fourteen wounded,
and the rest put to flight!

521
00:44:57,904 --> 00:44:59,895
That miserable scoundrel
Jacob proust rescued,

522
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:03,322
and Edward beverley as
far away from capture as ever!

523
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,679
Captain Sylvester, I'm charging you
with the responsibility

524
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:08,319
of seeking this man out,
and bringing him to justice.

525
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,455
Those are your instructions.

526
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:14,033
- I'm placing my trust in you.
- Thank you, sir.

527
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:16,744
I shall endeavour to take
full advantage of it.

528
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:19,880
All right, dismiss.

529
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,719
- Pablo: What is your name, huh?
- Theresa.

530
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:36,180
Theresa?
Ah, that is a beautiful name!

531
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:40,647
My name is Pablo.
You may call me uncle Pablo.

532
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,569
You don't have to be frightened anymore.

533
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:45,732
You are going on a little boat
with big sails,

534
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:48,864
to a land where there will be
no trouble for you anymore...

535
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:51,157
Some of them have been
travelling a long time.

536
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:52,614
They must get some rest.

537
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,036
Philip will take them on
to the coast tomorrow.

538
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:57,743
There'll be an escort
to lead them through the forest.

539
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:59,544
You go ahead. I'll follow.

540
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:07,837
You realise that, one day,
you'll be caught?

541
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,889
I suppose so.

542
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:14,723
These people are prepared
to sacrifice their homes,

543
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:18,347
and risk their lives,
rather than exist under cromwell.

544
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:21,188
One day, they'll return
to a free country.

545
00:46:22,071 --> 00:46:23,686
I'm glad to help them.

546
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:26,773
I suppose you think
these are strange words,

547
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:28,858
coming from colonel judd's daughter.

548
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:33,242
Having met the daughter,
I don't think the words are strange.

549
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:37,575
Until a few days ago,
I had only two thoughts in my mind:

550
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:40,127
To destroy cromwell, and put
the king back on the throne.

551
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,871
And now?

552
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,710
I want to live.

553
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,086
L, also.

554
00:46:54,687 --> 00:46:56,177
I must go.

555
00:46:57,606 --> 00:47:00,222
- It'll all be all right?
- Don't worry.

556
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:43,102
Do come in.

557
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:45,938
What kept you?

558
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:47,569
I had work to do.

559
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:49,112
You know that.

560
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:51,403
With Edward beverley?

561
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,197
Tom, you've no right to be here.

562
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:56,244
I don't like my privacy
intruded upon,

563
00:47:56,332 --> 00:47:58,197
and I don't like you
to question me!

564
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:00,157
I'm risking my neck for you.

565
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:02,243
I think I have
every right to intrude,

566
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:03,794
and to question.

567
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:06,963
And to make love.

568
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,879
- We made a bargain!
- What bargain?

569
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:12,199
You said you would help me.
There were to be no conditions.

570
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:14,009
I once told you what I was.

571
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:17,758
I'm an adventurer, like your father.

572
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:20,807
He changed his coat for money,

573
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:22,684
and I for love.

574
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:26,142
You touch that cord,
and I'll blow your plans to pieces.

575
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:31,651
I don't like the woman I love skulking
in the forest with some vagabond.

576
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:34,449
Tom. “What?

577
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:40,415
Supposing I were to tell you I've
fallen in love with this "vagabond"?

578
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:45,203
Are you insane?

579
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:46,754
No, I'm not insane.

580
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:48,998
I'm telling you the truth.
I've met the man I love.

581
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:51,091
A man you've known but a few hours!

582
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:54,383
And don't protest to me
that love isn't related to time.

583
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:58,007
Oh, I'm the one that's insane
for setting a trap for myself.

584
00:48:58,227 --> 00:49:00,559
- You offered to help.
- Yes, I offered to help.

585
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:03,179
And now, I can sit back
and see the course of history

586
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:04,889
shaped by people
like you and beverley.

587
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,856
Full of noble enterprise,

588
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:10,399
but lacking the common guts to put
their own cause before their feelings.

589
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,969
I wonder how the king would feel, locked
in his rooms at Hampton court palace,

590
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:15,028
if he knew about this.

591
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:17,527
And if your devotion
for the king is so great,

592
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:21,159
then you use Edward beverley
as you will.

593
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:25,034
But I don't like to be used.

594
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:27,961
- I trusted you.
- And I, you.

595
00:49:28,174 --> 00:49:29,584
I still trust you.

596
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,172
Judd: Captain Sylvester!

597
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:40,637
Will you come in here, please?

598
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,688
Major bell, this is captain Sylvester.

599
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:49,733
Major bell has been appointed
my deputy, by the lord protector.

600
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:52,652
I am leaving for London
immediately, to see him.

601
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:55,773
You will, of course, render major bell
full support during my absence.

602
00:49:55,868 --> 00:49:57,233
Good night, gentlemen.

603
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:02,538
I have here a list

604
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,952
of the various raids
carried out by beverley

605
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:07,747
since colonel judd
took command here.

606
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:14,087
Ten days ago, one of the
lord protector's emissaries

607
00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:15,714
was attacked and killed.

608
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,428
Eight days ago, four wagons
carrying arms were ambushed,

609
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:20,928
and the escorting soldiers
were killed.

610
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:24,681
On the same day, a farmhouse, which
served as a barrack for twenty men,

611
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:26,763
was burned to the ground.

612
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:29,849
Four days ago,
a man called Jacob proust,

613
00:50:29,944 --> 00:50:33,107
who was to have been hanged,
was rescued.

614
00:50:33,656 --> 00:50:36,648
I understand you were
in charge of that operation, captain.

615
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:38,900
I was in charge
of the detail, yes.

616
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:40,909
Oh, you weren't present yourself?

617
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:43,737
I had other duties
to perform at the time.

618
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:47,826
Oh, yes, I see. You were engaged in
the purchase of horses at wymington,

619
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:51,107
where I should have thought
you could have relegated that duty

620
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:53,998
to a junior officer, under
the circumstances. Hmm?

621
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:58,753
However, whilst I'm here,
you will personally take charge

622
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:03,223
of every operation I conceive to
secure the capture of Edward beverley.

623
00:51:04,103 --> 00:51:08,437
I already have an idea I wish to
discuss with you in this connection,

624
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,814
but it can wait till the morning.

625
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:13,187
- Is that all?
- That's all.

626
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:25,162
Captain Sylvester, sir.

627
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:27,956
Ah, ask him to come in.

628
00:51:31,714 --> 00:51:34,205
Good morning, captain.
Have you breakfasted?

629
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:36,081
Yes, thank you.

630
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:37,879
Well, be seated.

631
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:43,513
Now, we'll deal with
routine matters in due course.

632
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:46,559
But first, the outlaw beverley.

633
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:50,596
You realise that this man's capture
during colonel judd's absence

634
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:53,853
would reflect very highly
upon all of us?

635
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,650
Particularly yourself.

636
00:51:56,739 --> 00:51:59,321
I have a plan,
which may well prove successful.

637
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:02,775
First of all, I should like to point out
that search parties are useless.

638
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:05,737
This man's too wily a fox to be
caught in his own territory.

639
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:08,618
Search parties will,
nevertheless, continue.

640
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:11,993
Now, I understand that
beverley has a sister.

641
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:16,463
In future, search parties will be
concentrated in the forest area for her.

642
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:20,213
If we succeed in finding this girl,
we've virtually found her brother.

643
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:21,714
A life for a life?

644
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:23,466
Exactly.

645
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:27,217
We'll hold her,
till he gives himself up.

646
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:31,474
And you will be in charge
of this operation, captain.

647
00:52:36,028 --> 00:52:38,440
I'll see to it.

648
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:50,322
I've just had a message
from major drury.

649
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:52,658
They're moving the king
in three days' time.

650
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:54,994
Drury's trying to organise an ambush.

651
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,337
- Can you see Edward for me?
- What'll I tell him?

652
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:00,048
Tell him I'll meet him tonight,
at the oast house.

653
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,592
I can't make it before then.
I think I'm being watched.

654
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:04,632
I'll see what I can do.

655
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:08,799
- Tom!
- Hmm?

656
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:11,018
You will get through
to him, won't you?

657
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:13,228
I'll do my best.

658
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:26,108
Halt!

659
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:28,114
Divide the men into sections.

660
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:30,058
Spread them so they take in
an area of six miles.

661
00:53:30,082 --> 00:53:32,352
Detail two men with me,
and reassemble here in eight hours.

662
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:33,957
That'll be after nightfall, sir.

663
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,844
Not frightened of the dark,
are you, sergeant?

664
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,039
Jenkins!

665
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:39,713
Clare: Tell Edward to make contact
with every available man.

666
00:53:39,842 --> 00:53:43,801
Tomorrow, major drury will return
to give details of the ambush position.

667
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:46,762
The men must be ready to leave
immediately they get the signal.

668
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:49,682
Fifty of his men will be
waiting near Hampton court.

669
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:52,134
- We're badly in need of arms.
- Ssh!

670
00:53:57,484 --> 00:54:00,521
- Who is it?
- Man: Open in the name of cromwell!

671
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,440
Quickly, hide over there.

672
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:10,932
If you're looking for royalists,
there are none here.

673
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:12,617
I'll decide about that.

674
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:15,950
- I'm a loyal citizen.
- I'll decide about that, too.

675
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:28,878
I am the commanding officer
of this Garrison.

676
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:31,218
Do you wish to save your life?

677
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:32,511
On what terms?

678
00:56:32,848 --> 00:56:35,089
Tell me where I can
find your brother.

679
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:36,263
Never!

680
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:39,180
I'm giving you the opportunity
of saving your life.

681
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:40,594
If you refuse to talk,

682
00:56:40,689 --> 00:56:43,351
I'll find him anyway,
and you'll both die.

683
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:45,974
- You'll never find him through me.
- No?

684
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:57,307
But if you give yourself up, how do
you know they're going to release her?

685
00:56:57,331 --> 00:56:59,697
You only have their word for it,
and what is it worth?

686
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:01,281
Someone has betrayed us.

687
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:02,616
Who?

688
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:04,397
The only two people
who know where to find us

689
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:05,627
are captain Sylvester, and...

690
00:57:05,714 --> 00:57:06,954
Clare judd.

691
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:08,789
I am thinking of Sylvester.

692
00:57:08,884 --> 00:57:10,590
And Clare?

693
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:13,092
Pablo. Yes?

694
00:57:13,472 --> 00:57:15,337
You've lived all your life
by instinct,

695
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,201
and that's the way you
judge people. Am I right?

696
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:19,932
- You are right.
- What is your judgement?

697
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:21,931
I can also use my head.

698
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:25,981
And it tells me that this girl,
she has done things for your people.

699
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,974
I believe that she loves you.

700
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:30,982
And in this, my head tells me
what my heart already knows.

701
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:33,605
But this captain Sylvester,

702
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:36,111
when I first see him,
I want to kill him!

703
00:57:36,203 --> 00:57:38,694
- Because of his uniform?
- Because of him!

704
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:43,077
Edward, wait.

705
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:46,828
If you go, all our plans, all our efforts
to save the king go with you.

706
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,961
There will be no-one
to carry on our work.

707
00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:52,166
- Except you.
- I can go in your place.

708
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,000
No-one knows which of us
is Edward beverley.

709
00:57:54,096 --> 00:57:55,176
Sylvester knows.

710
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:57,550
How can he say
without betraying himself?

711
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,173
I haven't as much
to lose as you.

712
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:02,475
Edward, please let me go.

713
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:10,355
Philip, I am not going to
give myself up.

714
00:59:14,426 --> 00:59:17,259
- Clare.
- I was coming to you.

715
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:18,740
You know they've got constance?
Yes.

716
00:59:18,764 --> 00:59:20,755
- Where is she?
- In the cellar.

717
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:23,807
- Be careful. There are guards about.
- Stay here.

718
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:42,242
Psst!

719
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,940
Come on!

720
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:30,748
The courtyard!

721
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:53,597
Keep going!

722
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,886
Colonel judd returns tomorrow.

723
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:37,603
I intend to cheer his homecoming
by the sight of you,

724
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:40,401
hanging by the neck
on beverley green.

725
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:42,070
Take him away.

726
01:01:49,998 --> 01:01:52,080
Whatever you are,

727
01:01:52,209 --> 01:01:54,495
roundhead, cavalier,

728
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:56,205
adventurer...

729
01:01:56,588 --> 01:01:58,749
Whatever you like to call yourself,

730
01:01:58,882 --> 01:02:01,043
you're still an officer in uniform,

731
01:02:01,176 --> 01:02:04,088
and you can't just stand by
and watch this murder.

732
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:07,587
Tom, I beseech you.

733
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:10,082
Go to major bell and ask him
to wait until my father returns.

734
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:13,761
And when your father returns,
what do you suppose he'll do?

735
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:16,396
At least it would give us some time.

736
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:17,835
There might be some way
of saving Edward,

737
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:20,020
if only we had a little time.

738
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:25,276
I think you want him to die.

739
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:27,114
Why should I want him to live?

740
01:02:27,244 --> 01:02:29,451
So that he's free
to take you away from me?

741
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,410
Tom. “What?

742
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:34,322
Did you betray us?

743
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:37,371
Did you?

744
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:39,961
You still love him, don't you?

745
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:43,377
You did betray us.

746
01:02:45,053 --> 01:02:47,260
Oh, how could you be so vile?

747
01:02:48,515 --> 01:02:51,006
I once told you that
I didn't like to be used.

748
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:55,218
Remember?

749
01:03:08,952 --> 01:03:10,943
Clare.

750
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:12,777
This shows the place
of the ambush.

751
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:15,826
Beverley's men should leave tonight.
Can you get that to him?

752
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:17,578
Edward's been taken.

753
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:18,746
No!

754
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:21,123
I'll try to get it to Philip.

755
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:23,016
There... there's something else,
major drury.

756
01:03:23,133 --> 01:03:25,920
- Do you remember captain Sylvester?
- Very well.

757
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:29,089
It was he who betrayed Edward.
He knows about the ambush.

758
01:03:29,264 --> 01:03:31,880
- Has he talked?
- I don't think so.

759
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:34,307
But he will. Where is he now?

760
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:38,391
In his quarters. Round that corner,
the first door you come to.

761
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:41,394
Very well, I'll take care of him.
Guard those plans with your life,

762
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:43,349
and get them to Philip
as quickly as you can.

763
01:04:10,472 --> 01:04:11,928
Drop the knife.

764
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:26,810
- I was just about to knock.
- Indeed?

765
01:04:26,905 --> 01:04:28,236
Sylvester: Guard!

766
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:30,897
Turn out the guard!

767
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,485
Bell: What's happened?

768
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:38,155
Someone tried to kill
captain Sylvester, sir.

769
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:44,748
Major drury won't be
troubling us again, sir.

770
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,587
- He's dead?
- As mutton.

771
01:04:49,469 --> 01:04:51,881
Philip: There'll be twenty cavalry
concealed in these woods.

772
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:53,632
Riflemen over here to the left,

773
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:56,009
and this is the main road
from Hampton court.

774
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:58,724
It's well planned, Clare.
It's going to work.

775
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,935
- It'll never work.
- What do you mean?

776
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:02,887
Sylvester will betray us.

777
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:05,310
- Philip, how many men have you got?
- More than fifty.

778
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:07,893
- Pablo, how about you?
- My people do not fight for a cause.

779
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:10,190
They love no country.
No country loves them.

780
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:12,609
I give Philip my blessing,
and my help. That is all.

781
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:14,361
But you'd fight for a life?
For Edward?

782
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:16,030
That is a different matter.

783
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:19,279
- Have many of the men left?
- Not yet. They're waiting for me to tell them.

784
01:05:19,374 --> 01:05:21,911
Tomorrow morning, your brother
is due to be hanged.

785
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:23,707
We can save him, Philip.

786
01:05:24,379 --> 01:05:25,835
Well, if only that were possible.

787
01:05:25,964 --> 01:05:28,376
Oh, it is. It is possible.

788
01:05:28,675 --> 01:05:31,667
With the help of our men,
and Pablo's, we could save him.

789
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:34,798
The whole district will be
turned out to witness the execution.

790
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:37,547
Our people and Pablo's
could mingle with the crowd.

791
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:38,973
There will be only soldiers.

792
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:41,221
The people have been told
to keep to their houses.

793
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:44,221
- Then we must make a surprise attack.
- And the king?

794
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:45,851
There's no chance for the king.

795
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:48,107
Because Sylvester will talk?
Yes.

796
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:50,150
Or because you're
in love with my brother?

797
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:53,275
- Don't you love him?
- Yes, of course I do.

798
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:57,655
But he wouldn't thank me if I risked
the life of one single man to save him.

799
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:00,870
But the king stands for the
lives and freedom of all his subjects.

800
01:06:00,999 --> 01:06:03,706
Then you're going to
throw away the lives of fifty men,

801
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:07,126
because the cause is lost.
The king's as good as dead.

802
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:08,787
You don't really believe that.

803
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:12,377
If Sylvester betrays us,
he will have to betray himself.

804
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:14,842
I love my brother very much.

805
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:17,633
But I know that he would do
exactly as I intend to do

806
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:19,297
if he were in my place.

807
01:06:19,434 --> 01:06:21,174
You know I'm right.

808
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:00,888
Ready.

809
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:16,234
- Who's the man about to be executed?
- Edward beverley, sir.

810
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:19,152
Stop the execution!

811
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:22,777
- Colonel...
- I'm ordering you to stop this execution.

812
01:07:22,914 --> 01:07:26,281
Your orders were to
apprehend beverley, dead or alive.

813
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:28,583
In my view,
this man is safer dead.

814
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:33,334
You will refrain from expressing your views
in the presence of junior officers.

815
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:35,504
You will be good enough
to wait upon me at the manor.

816
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:36,878
Take the prisoner to the cells.

817
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:38,811
Captain Sylvester,
I want to know the identity

818
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:41,095
of everyone concerned
with Edward beverley.

819
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:43,844
He is to be subjected to
the most extreme forms of persuasion

820
01:07:43,935 --> 01:07:45,471
necessary to loosen his tongue.

821
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:47,723
- See to it.
- Sir.

822
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:53,520
- Release the rope.
- Aye, sir.

823
01:07:54,654 --> 01:07:56,315
Take him away.

824
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:02,325
Guard, dismiss!

825
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:24,384
Tie him up.

826
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:42,691
Major bell, do you realise that we are
not dealing with one isolated criminal,

827
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:46,991
that this man is the leader of a
dangerous royalist underground movement?

828
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:50,824
- I am aware of that, sir.
- Then why, sir, were you not aware

829
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,747
of the necessity to
extract information from him?

830
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:56,587
- It was not necessary.
- No?

831
01:08:57,634 --> 01:08:58,994
It might interest you to know that

832
01:08:59,052 --> 01:09:00,963
there is a plot
to rescue Charles Stuart.

833
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:03,545
Its origin stems from this district.

834
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:05,512
Beverley is undoubtedly
concerned with it,

835
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:07,264
and he is not working alone.

836
01:09:07,477 --> 01:09:11,186
I stated that it was not necessary
to extract information from beverley,

837
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:14,435
because I already know the name
of the principal accomplice.

838
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:15,647
Indeed?

839
01:09:15,735 --> 01:09:17,775
Before you left for London,
you told me that someone

840
01:09:17,862 --> 01:09:21,855
had been supplying beverley with
information from inside these walls.

841
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:25,320
I can now tell you
who this person is,

842
01:09:25,787 --> 01:09:29,200
and, for that reason, I saw
no purpose in delaying the execution.

843
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:31,997
I accuse captain Sylvester.

844
01:09:32,377 --> 01:09:33,787
You have proof?

845
01:09:34,212 --> 01:09:36,077
I have proof.

846
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:59,646
Request captain Sylvester
to see me immediately.

847
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:03,062
If your accusations are correct,

848
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:05,094
Sylvester will know of
the king's imminent removal

849
01:10:05,118 --> 01:10:06,733
from Hampton court to the tower.

850
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:08,749
An attempt to rescue the king
will be made then.

851
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:12,072
Go to London immediately, and warn
them of the possibility of an ambush.

852
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:15,829
I also advise that the king
should not be removed at present.

853
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,785
Carry on.

854
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:32,850
Captain Sylvester,

855
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,928
you are under close arrest.

856
01:10:43,406 --> 01:10:45,772
- You deny nothing?
- Nothing.

857
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:48,358
But, I warn you, colonel.
You bring me to trial,

858
01:10:48,453 --> 01:10:50,739
and [I'll seek clemency
by pleading state's evidence.

859
01:10:50,872 --> 01:10:54,330
No doubt that will be considered,
provided you plead now.

860
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:56,578
I want names.

861
01:10:56,711 --> 01:10:59,418
You may be concerned
with only one for the moment.

862
01:11:02,133 --> 01:11:03,794
That of Clare judd,

863
01:11:03,968 --> 01:11:05,253
your daughter.

864
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:10,384
That's the name of the woman
that inveigled me into this plot.

865
01:11:11,184 --> 01:11:12,640
Clare judd.

866
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:16,803
- Your daughter.
- What are you saying?

867
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:20,352
She managed to ensnare me
under the pretext of love.

868
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:24,064
She used all her feminine wiles
to trap me.

869
01:11:25,490 --> 01:11:27,822
All this will be
part of my defence.

870
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:33,077
Maybe none of it
will be taken into account,

871
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:35,367
but at least you, colonel,

872
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:37,414
being a staunch
advocate of justice,

873
01:11:37,502 --> 01:11:40,222
will have the satisfaction of seeing
justice handed out to everybody.

874
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:43,166
Including your own flesh and blood.

875
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:52,262
Captain Sylvester.

876
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:56,559
No!

877
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:26,873
Judd: Captain Sylvester was
shot while resisting arrest.

878
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:30,001
You will observe that his pistol
is still in his hand.

879
01:12:30,221 --> 01:12:31,677
Get him away.

880
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:44,019
You've been accused of
assisting in the royalist cause.

881
01:12:44,235 --> 01:12:45,975
Is that true? “Yes.

882
01:12:46,112 --> 01:12:47,712
You've been working
with Edward beverley?

883
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:48,815
Yes.

884
01:12:48,906 --> 01:12:51,260
Did you ever stop to think
what would happen to your own father

885
01:12:51,284 --> 01:12:53,491
when your traitorous acts
were disclosed?

886
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:55,739
Did you ever have any
feelings for anyone

887
01:12:55,872 --> 01:12:57,737
other than yourself,
when you turned traitor?

888
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,905
You're the last person
to preach to me!

889
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:02,617
It's only you
I'm concerned with now.

890
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:04,994
Fortunately for both of us,

891
01:13:05,089 --> 01:13:07,751
there's now no danger
of the king's rescue taking place,

892
01:13:08,009 --> 01:13:11,422
and, in a few minutes, there will be
no-one left to denounce you.

893
01:13:12,471 --> 01:13:13,881
Except myself.

894
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:17,256
The king is doomed.

895
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:20,180
Nothing I or anyone else can do
can help him now.

896
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:25,398
I am prepared to die
for what I believe is right.

897
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:28,226
If you refuse to release
Edward beverley,

898
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:30,569
I'll proclaim to the world
what I've done.

899
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:34,698
You would never dare.

900
01:13:37,496 --> 01:13:39,361
You don't know me.

901
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:43,662
You will not only condemn yourself,
you will condemn me.

902
01:13:45,004 --> 01:13:47,996
Whatever your feelings are
towards me,

903
01:13:48,883 --> 01:13:50,748
I am still your father.

904
01:14:11,322 --> 01:14:12,858
Give me your pistol.

905
01:14:14,492 --> 01:14:15,948
Get out.

906
01:14:32,927 --> 01:14:35,134
I've tried to make you talk,

907
01:14:35,262 --> 01:14:37,344
but now... stand up!

908
01:14:38,182 --> 01:14:40,013
Get on your feet.

909
01:15:10,006 --> 01:15:11,712
- Get a horse!
- Edward!

910
01:15:15,219 --> 01:15:16,334
Go on, go on!

911
01:15:57,636 --> 01:16:00,048
They must be almost there by now.

912
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,340
We're too late.

913
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:07,723
Oh, please. Please!

914
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:10,391
We're throwing away our only chance,

915
01:16:10,483 --> 01:16:11,483
our lives...

916
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:13,148
For nothing.

917
01:16:15,196 --> 01:16:16,402
No.

918
01:16:22,328 --> 01:16:23,659
Clare.

919
01:16:49,563 --> 01:16:51,303
Forward!

920
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:52,136
Philip!

921
01:19:07,243 --> 01:19:08,653
Edward.

922
01:19:44,405 --> 01:19:48,148
Children: Pablo! Pablo!
They're coming!

923
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:51,483
Quick, Martha, some old clothes!

924
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:54,453
There are soldiers coming.
Put mud on your faces.

925
01:19:54,748 --> 01:19:57,364
Whoever saw a gypsy
with a clean face, huh?

926
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:59,996
Make haste. Go with Martha.

927
01:20:05,968 --> 01:20:07,333
Get to your work.

928
01:20:08,053 --> 01:20:09,543
Everybody, get to your work!

929
01:20:25,404 --> 01:20:28,692
Put a bold front on it, my friend.
Get to work, huh?

930
01:20:29,867 --> 01:20:31,528
Will they search the camp?

931
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:34,451
Everywhere they think
there may be royalists,

932
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,445
they will search.

933
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:47,437
I advise you gypsies
to keep to the forest.

934
01:22:03,001 --> 01:22:04,616
Forward!

935
01:22:41,999 --> 01:22:46,743
