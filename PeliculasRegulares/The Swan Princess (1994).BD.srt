00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,362
<i>Once upon a time,
there was a king named William</i>

2
00:01:05,363 --> 00:01:08,949
<i>who ruled a large and mighty kingdom.</i>

3
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,576
<i>And yet he was sad,</i>

4
00:01:11,577 --> 00:01:15,957
<i>for he was growing old and had
no child to inherit the throne.</i>

5
00:01:17,834 --> 00:01:22,337
<i>Then, happily, a daughter was born.</i>

6
00:01:22,338 --> 00:01:24,297
<i>A princess.</i>

7
00:01:24,298 --> 00:01:27,802
<i>And she was given the name Odette.</i>

8
00:01:34,726 --> 00:01:39,646
<i>Kings and queens came from all around
to offer their gifts to the child.</i>

9
00:01:39,647 --> 00:01:45,778
<i>Among them was the widow Uberta
and her young son, Prince Derek.</i>

10
00:01:48,197 --> 00:01:53,869
<i>It was then that William and
Uberta happened upon the same idea.</i>

11
00:01:53,870 --> 00:02:00,041
<i>Derek and Odette would be brought together each
summer in hopes that they would fall in love</i>

12
00:02:00,042 --> 00:02:02,503
<i>and join their kingdoms forever.</i>

13
00:02:03,546 --> 00:02:06,631
<i>But unknown to all was another plan,</i>

14
00:02:06,632 --> 00:02:10,719
<i>that of the evil enchanter Rothbart.</i>

15
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,098
<i>Odette's birth was of
little concern to him.</i>

16
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:18,602
<i>For he was preparing to
take William's kingdom</i>

17
00:02:18,603 --> 00:02:21,396
<i>by means of the forbidden arts.</i>

18
00:02:27,195 --> 00:02:31,072
<i>On the eve of his
assault, William attacked,</i>

19
00:02:31,073 --> 00:02:34,327
<i>and Rothbart's powers were
plunged into darkness.</i>

20
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:41,458
<i>Despite calls for his death,</i>

21
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:43,502
<i>the enchanter was only banished.</i>

22
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,922
I'm not finished with you yet, William.

23
00:02:46,923 --> 00:02:50,634
Someday I'll get my power back.

24
00:02:50,635 --> 00:02:56,014
And when I do, everything you
own, everything you love

25
00:02:56,015 --> 00:02:58,017
will be mine.

26
00:03:00,394 --> 00:03:03,481
<i>Many feared King William too kind.</i>

27
00:03:04,524 --> 00:03:08,026
<i>But in time, the threat was forgotten.</i>

28
00:03:08,027 --> 00:03:12,030
<i>And all hopes turned to
that not-too-distant summer,</i>

29
00:03:12,031 --> 00:03:15,660
<i>when Derek and Odette would meet.</i>

30
00:03:18,663 --> 00:03:20,163
Here they come. Oh!

31
00:03:40,351 --> 00:03:44,146
Dear Uberta, as lovely as ever.

32
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,359
Oh. A nest. Heh-heh.

33
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,405
And who might this strapping young man be?

34
00:03:53,406 --> 00:03:56,491
Young Prince Derek, no doubt.

35
00:03:56,492 --> 00:04:00,203
Welcome to our fair kingdom, dear William.

36
00:04:00,204 --> 00:04:03,875
And to you, young princess.

37
00:04:08,963 --> 00:04:10,590
Go on, Derek.

38
00:04:11,716 --> 00:04:13,967
Dear, go on.

39
00:04:13,968 --> 00:04:15,803
- Mother.
- Derek.

40
00:04:18,723 --> 00:04:23,268

What? You're all I ever wanted.
You're beautiful.

121
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:05,962
- Thank you. But what else?
- What else?

122
00:11:05,963 --> 00:11:08,048
Is beauty all that matters to you?

123
00:11:12,594 --> 00:11:14,220
Derek?

124
00:11:14,221 --> 00:11:15,639
What else?

125
00:11:16,473 --> 00:11:19,017
I... Uh...

126
00:11:19,018 --> 00:11:20,893
What else is there?

127
00:11:30,738 --> 00:11:34,491
We tried, Uberta.
No one can say we didn't try.

128
00:11:36,618 --> 00:11:39,329
- Say goodbye, Odette.
- Goodbye.

129
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:42,249
- Goodbye...?
- Prince Derek.

130
00:11:43,542 --> 00:11:45,336
- Mother.
- Derek.

131
00:11:46,337 --> 00:11:47,755
Goodbye, princess.

132
00:11:59,683 --> 00:12:02,643
All these years of planning...

133
00:12:02,644 --> 00:12:04,980
wasted!

134
00:12:15,366 --> 00:12:20,119
"What else is there?" She says,
"Is beauty all that matters?"

135
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,873
And you say, "What else is there?"

136
00:12:23,874 --> 00:12:25,918
It was dumb, I know.

137
00:12:26,794 --> 00:12:31,799
You should write a book: <i>How to Offend
Women in Five Syllables or Less.</i>

138
00:12:32,341 --> 00:12:34,802
Heh-heh. Your turn, Prince Derek.

139
00:12:35,344 --> 00:12:37,304
I didn't know what else to say.

140
00:12:38,347 --> 00:12:42,558
- You lost your queen, Derek.
- That's twice in one day.

141
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:47,063
Think. You must see something
other than Odette's beauty.

142
00:12:47,064 --> 00:12:50,358
Ha! Of course I do, Rogers. She's like...

143
00:12:50,359 --> 00:12:53,528
You know. And how about...?

144
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:55,279
And then...

145
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,156
I mean, right?

146
00:12:58,909 --> 00:13:00,953
I don't know how to say it.

147
00:13:02,204 --> 00:13:07,209
I'll prove it to her.
I'll prove my love. Checkmate.

148
00:13:08,502 --> 00:13:09,710
Huh?

149
00:13:17,386 --> 00:13:19,554
Today's the day, Willie.

150
00:13:19,555 --> 00:13:25,644
Everything you own,
everything you love will be mine.

151
00:13:27,396 --> 00:13:30,565
I just don't understand.

152
00:13:30,566 --> 00:13:33,986
What else did you want him to say?

153
00:13:34,653 --> 00:13:39,407
I need to know that he
loves me for just being me.

154
00:13:39,408 --> 00:13:41,326
Whoa! Whoa.

155
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,084
Stay inside, Odette.

156
00:14:07,311 --> 00:14:08,937
It's King William's captain.

157
00:14:09,396 --> 00:14:10,397
We...

158
00:14:11,773 --> 00:14:16,194
We were attacked. A great animal.

159
00:14:16,195 --> 00:14:19,780
- Odette.
- Derek, wait!

160
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,666
Odette!

161
00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:33,295
Odette?

162
00:14:34,505 --> 00:14:35,756
Odette!

163
00:14:45,015 --> 00:14:46,474
King William.

164
00:14:46,475 --> 00:14:47,558
Derek...

165
00:14:48,602 --> 00:14:50,520
Who did this?

166
00:14:50,521 --> 00:14:55,441
It came so quickly. A great animal.

167
00:14:55,442 --> 00:14:57,026
Where is Odette?

168
00:14:57,027 --> 00:15:02,448
Listen to me, Derek.
It's not what it seems.

169
00:15:02,449 --> 00:15:04,867
It's not what it seems.

170
00:15:04,868 --> 00:15:08,371
What's not? Where is Odette?

171
00:15:08,372 --> 00:15:10,958
Odette is...

172
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:18,632
Odette is... gone.

173
00:15:23,637 --> 00:15:26,098
Odette!

174
00:16:11,935 --> 00:16:16,022
Now, don't let my little
spell make you sad, Odette,

175
00:16:16,023 --> 00:16:18,609
it doesn't even last the whole day.

176
00:16:19,067 --> 00:16:21,403
As soon as the moon comes up...

177
00:16:32,956 --> 00:16:36,459
And that's how it works every night.

178
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:41,673
You have to be on the lake, of course.
And when the moonlight touches your wings...

179
00:16:42,174 --> 00:16:47,762
Now, look, Odette, this sort of thing
doesn't give me any pleasure.

180
00:16:47,763 --> 00:16:50,389
Well, maybe a teensy bit.

181
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:54,894
But what I really want
is your father's kingdom.

182
00:16:54,895 --> 00:16:57,313
Take it, then. You have enough power.

183
00:16:57,314 --> 00:17:00,232
Nah, tried that already.

184
00:17:00,233 --> 00:17:05,572
Once you steal something,
you spend your whole life fighting to keep it.

185
00:17:06,865 --> 00:17:12,579
But if I marry the only
heir to the throne...

186
00:17:13,955 --> 00:17:20,336
we'll rule your father's kingdom together, legally.
King and queen. You know.

187
00:17:20,337 --> 00:17:21,421
Never.

188
00:17:22,506 --> 00:17:24,256
Where are you going?

189
00:17:24,257 --> 00:17:28,845
As soon as moonlight leaves the lake,
you'll turn back into a swan,

190
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,515
no matter where you are.

191
00:17:45,153 --> 00:17:49,073
- The musicians are not happy.
- I know, but I have to practice.

192
00:17:49,074 --> 00:17:51,617
Oh, no complaints here.

193
00:17:51,618 --> 00:17:55,746
I think it's going to be loads of... fun.

194
00:17:55,747 --> 00:17:58,667
The great animal is never gonna
give her up without a fight.

195
00:17:59,084 --> 00:18:01,335
You're not still thinking she's alive?

196
00:18:01,336 --> 00:18:05,089
When I find the great animal,
Rogers, I'll find Odette.

197
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:10,511
Oh, Derek, you've looked everywhere.
She's not coming back.

198
00:18:10,512 --> 00:18:14,223
- The whole kingdom knows that.
- The whole kingdom's wrong.

199
00:18:14,224 --> 00:18:18,311
Odette's alive, and I'm gonna find her.
Ready, Brom?

200
00:18:18,687 --> 00:18:19,855
No peeking.

201
00:18:20,689 --> 00:18:22,983
Animals, assemble!

202
00:18:23,483 --> 00:18:27,486
Lord Rogers, I must object.
We are musicians.

203
00:18:27,487 --> 00:18:30,656
The servants have the day off.
We had to use someone.

204
00:18:30,657 --> 00:18:36,162
- But I'm an artist, not a boar.
- Could have fooled me.

205
00:18:36,163 --> 00:18:38,957

I want you to strike fear into my heart!

213
00:19:10,697 --> 00:19:15,619
Not you, Wesley.
You're a rabbit, for heaven's sake.

214
00:19:18,497 --> 00:19:21,166
Archers. Ready.

215
00:19:22,209 --> 00:19:23,627

217

Uh-huh. Very good, very good.

233
00:20:48,837 --> 00:20:53,674
You scored plenty of
five-pointers, that's for sure.

234
00:20:53,675 --> 00:20:56,635
Sorry, Hans.
Why don't you take a few days off?

235
00:20:56,636 --> 00:21:01,891
Moose are worth two points.
Sixteen hits, a total of 32.

236
00:21:01,892 --> 00:21:06,687
Ten seven-pointers and 14 three-pointers.

237
00:21:06,688 --> 00:21:10,524
For a total of... 298!

238
00:21:10,525 --> 00:21:12,443
Well done, Derek.

239
00:21:12,444 --> 00:21:14,529
Now, Bromley, let's see. For you...

240
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,951
Zero, and zero, and
nothing, and nil, and zip.

241
00:21:22,078 --> 00:21:24,580
And last but not least,

242
00:21:24,581 --> 00:21:29,628
the elusive 100-point white rabbit...

243
00:21:32,255 --> 00:21:36,342
- I believe that's 300, Rogers.
- Good shooting, Brom.

244
00:21:36,343 --> 00:21:40,931
Well? Write it down. Three hundred to 298.

245
00:21:41,306 --> 00:21:45,143
Oh, but wait just a moment, Rogers.

246
00:21:48,188 --> 00:21:49,272
Sorry, Brom.

247
00:21:50,941 --> 00:21:54,777
You're a great marksman, Derek.
One of the best.

248
00:21:54,778 --> 00:21:56,946
But it takes more than good aim.

249
00:21:56,947 --> 00:22:00,866
It takes courage. That's my forte.

250
00:22:00,867 --> 00:22:04,828
Well, then, how about a quick
round of "Catch and Fire"?

251
00:22:06,915 --> 00:22:09,333
Catch and fire? You mean, me?

252
00:22:09,334 --> 00:22:11,126
You're the only one with enough

253
00:22:11,127 --> 00:22:13,922
c-courage.

254
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,552
- Are you sure you're all right?
- Mm-hm.

255
00:22:20,553 --> 00:22:22,722
Fine, I'm fine.

256
00:22:23,974 --> 00:22:26,935
Oh! Too tight. Too tight.

257
00:22:27,268 --> 00:22:30,187
Whoops. So sorry.

258
00:22:30,188 --> 00:22:31,606
Ready?

259
00:22:34,234 --> 00:22:35,193
He's ready.

260
00:22:36,861 --> 00:22:41,240
Remember now, aim for the heart.

261
00:22:41,241 --> 00:22:43,702
Right between the shoulders.

262
00:22:54,713 --> 00:22:56,548
Oh, please, oh, please, oh, please.

263
00:22:59,592 --> 00:23:03,221
Come on, Brom. Hold it steady.

264
00:23:03,763 --> 00:23:07,516
Oh, please, oh, please. Oh, please.

265
00:23:07,517 --> 00:23:08,601
Now!

266
00:23:16,443 --> 00:23:17,694
Whew!

267
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:23,449
Fifty-two out of 52! Well done, Derek!

268
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,909
Extraordinary courage, man.

269
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:30,790
Just think, one inch lower
and that arrow would have...

270
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:42,844
Don't lose hope, Odette.
Wherever you are, I'm gonna find you.

271
00:23:50,602 --> 00:23:52,895
Quiet! I cannot concentrate.

272
00:23:52,896 --> 00:23:58,233
You've come up with some dumb ideas, Jean-Bob,
but this one is a doozy.

273
00:23:58,234 --> 00:24:04,531
Ha! Go ahead and laugh. I'll get her to kiss me.
And when she does...

274
00:24:04,532 --> 00:24:11,413
And when she does, poof. You'll change into a prince.
I know, I know, you've told me.

275
00:24:11,414 --> 00:24:15,334
Why don't you just give her these flowers?
These are pretty.

276
00:24:15,335 --> 00:24:21,924
Ha! What a love-dunce.
I don't want these flowers, I must have those.

277
00:24:21,925 --> 00:24:25,844
When she learns that I have
risked my life for them,

278
00:24:25,845 --> 00:24:28,347
the kissing will not stop.

279
00:24:28,348 --> 00:24:31,975
- And then you'll change into a prince?
- Precisely.

280
00:24:31,976 --> 00:24:37,231
- Mind if I point out a problem?
- I don't take advice from peasants.

281
00:24:37,232 --> 00:24:38,483
Suit yourself.

282
00:24:41,778 --> 00:24:47,992
Flowers, kiss, concentration.
Flowers, kiss, concentration.

283
00:24:49,077 --> 00:24:52,579
Just curious, how are you gonna get back?

284
00:25:05,718 --> 00:25:07,303
Hurry, hurry!

285
00:25:09,681 --> 00:25:13,476
Move up! Move up! No, not that.

286
00:25:14,352 --> 00:25:15,435
Close!

287
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:24,236
Grab me! Grab me! Hold my arm! Hold my leg!

288
00:25:24,237 --> 00:25:26,823
Hold my-- Hold it, hold it, hold it.

289
00:25:28,074 --> 00:25:29,993
Oh, thank you, Odette.

290
00:25:31,452 --> 00:25:33,954
Thank you. Let me have that.

291
00:25:33,955 --> 00:25:36,166
Silence, you savages.

292
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:38,626
Ha-ha! Ungh!

293
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:40,920
Are you all right, Jean-Bob?

294
00:25:41,421 --> 00:25:42,504
Jean-Bob?

295
00:25:42,505 --> 00:25:45,757
<i>Oui, oui, oui,</i> Odette. Yes, I'm all right.

296
00:25:45,758 --> 00:25:49,178
- What in the world were you trying to do?
- He thought that if--

297
00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:54,224
Shush! I wanted to get
those flowers for you.

298
00:25:54,225 --> 00:25:56,560
You're being sneaky again, Jean-Bob.

299
00:25:56,561 --> 00:26:02,232
- What sneaky? You deserve a nice bouquet.
- And you deserve a kiss.

300
00:26:02,233 --> 00:26:03,901
Well, all right.

301
00:26:03,902 --> 00:26:07,905
- You know I'm under a spell.
- But my kiss will break the spell.

302
00:26:07,906 --> 00:26:10,073
Give it up, Jean-Bob.

303
00:26:10,074 --> 00:26:12,910
I can only kiss the man I love.

304
00:26:12,911 --> 00:26:17,164
- And then he--
- Must make a vow of everlasting love.

305
00:26:17,165 --> 00:26:18,916
And prove it to the world.

306
00:26:18,917 --> 00:26:23,837
What do you think I was doing with the flowers
and the alligators going chomp-chomp?

307
00:26:23,838 --> 00:26:27,759
- Speed, make him understand.

- You think he's dead?
- No, it's just his wing, I think.

335
00:28:54,364 --> 00:28:56,573
- Strange-looking bird.
- Ooh!

336
00:28:56,574 --> 00:29:01,579
Poor fellow. He must be in a lot of pain.
You'd better hold him.

337
00:29:02,914 --> 00:29:04,248
- Ooh!
- Ready.

338
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:14,091
Hello. This is your wake-up call.

339
00:29:18,012 --> 00:29:23,266
It takes more than a pair of pond punks
to keep Puffin down. Hiyah!

340
00:29:23,267 --> 00:29:26,103
Wait. I'm your friend.

341
00:29:26,104 --> 00:29:31,608
If you were me friend,
how come you have an arrow in your hand? Huh?

342
00:29:31,609 --> 00:29:35,029
- Yes, the exact kind of arrow I have--
- Heh-heh.

343
00:29:35,988 --> 00:29:37,073
Um...

344
00:29:37,532 --> 00:29:39,783
I took it out while you were laying there.

345
00:29:39,784 --> 00:29:42,953
You mean, you had a chance to
"krkk" and instead you "fft"?

346
00:29:42,954 --> 00:29:44,122
Uh-huh.

347
00:29:44,455 --> 00:29:50,210
Madam, I apologize. Me name is Puffin.
Lieutenant Puffin.

348
00:29:50,211 --> 00:29:55,383
It's a pleasure, Lieutenant Puffin.
I'm Odette, Princess Odette.

349
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:02,390
And these are my best friends in the whole world.
Mr. Lorenzo Trudgealong...

350
00:30:02,765 --> 00:30:06,143
- Friends call me Speed.
- And Jean-Bob.

351
00:30:06,144 --> 00:30:11,982
I have no friends, only servants.
They call me "Your Highness."

352
00:30:11,983 --> 00:30:13,901
Thinks he's a prince.

353
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:19,949
Ahem. I owe you, princess.
And I intend on staying until me debt is paid.

354
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:24,035
I don't think there's much you can do.
He has me under a spell.

355
00:30:24,036 --> 00:30:26,164
What? You mean, a magical...?

356
00:30:40,595 --> 00:30:46,141
Your knight in shining armor has come
to set you free. Heh-heh.

357
00:30:46,142 --> 00:30:48,518
Let me at him. Let me at him. I'll...

358
00:30:50,104 --> 00:30:51,480
Chill.

359
00:30:51,481 --> 00:30:55,901
All it takes is just one little word.

360
00:30:55,902 --> 00:30:58,653
Will you... marry me?

361
00:30:58,654 --> 00:31:01,656
- Every night you ask the same question.
- No, no.

362
00:31:01,657 --> 00:31:05,243
- And every night I give you the same answer.
- Don't!

363
00:31:05,244 --> 00:31:09,998
- I'll die first.
- You're really starting to bug me.

364
00:31:09,999 --> 00:31:15,045
- I should think you'd be used to it by now.
- That's it! Just keep pushing it.

365
00:31:15,046 --> 00:31:18,673
But someday I'm gonna boil over!

366
00:31:18,674 --> 00:31:22,011
Go ahead, then! But I'll never
give you my father's kingdom.

367
00:31:24,764 --> 00:31:28,183
I was hoping you'd say you'd be mine,

368
00:31:28,184 --> 00:31:34,482
but it looks as if you need
another day to think about it.

369
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,360
No.

370
00:32:03,052 --> 00:32:04,220
Princess?

371
00:32:10,518 --> 00:32:15,021
Beautiful. Simply beautiful.

372
00:32:15,022 --> 00:32:20,485
Soon Derek will be married,
and the kingdom will have a king again.

373
00:32:20,486 --> 00:32:25,657
I doubt it. Derek refuses to be king,
unless he finds Odette.

374
00:32:25,658 --> 00:32:30,704
Oh, poppycock. All that will
change at tomorrow night's ball.

375
00:32:30,705 --> 00:32:33,290
They're all coming to the ball. Ha-ha-ha!

376
00:32:33,291 --> 00:32:35,417
Every princess is coming.

377
00:32:37,044 --> 00:32:40,046
Oh, goody, oh, my. Oh, this is wonderful.

378
00:32:40,047 --> 00:32:44,801
You see, Rogers.
One of these is bound to change his mind.

379
00:32:44,802 --> 00:32:48,138
Oh, absolutely... not.

380
00:32:48,139 --> 00:32:52,976
- Do not lose one.
- Oh, no. No. No, no.

381
00:32:52,977 --> 00:32:55,812
Where is Derek?
Oh, never mind, I know where he is,

382
00:32:55,813 --> 00:32:59,149
working on the mystery of the fat animal.

383
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:04,238
- The great animal, Your Highness.
- Big, great. It's large and has fur.

384
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:10,328
<i>Listen, Derek, it's not what it seems.</i>

385
00:33:11,621 --> 00:33:13,748
What did King William mean?

386
00:33:27,803 --> 00:33:34,601
It's not what it seems... Of course.
It's not what it seems.

387
00:33:34,602 --> 00:33:36,979
Now I'll find you, Odette.

388
00:33:38,564 --> 00:33:43,109
They're coming, Derek!
Oh, Derek, where are you going?

389
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:46,988
- To find the great animal.
- Oh, wonderful.

390
00:33:46,989 --> 00:33:49,407
Just make sure you're here tomorrow night.

391
00:33:49,408 --> 00:33:50,326
Tomorrow night?

392
00:33:52,286 --> 00:33:53,328
The ball.

393
00:33:53,329 --> 00:33:55,581
Mother, I can't.

394
00:33:57,249 --> 00:34:00,503
Oh, please, Mother. Don't do the lip thing.

395
00:34:01,504 --> 00:34:04,506
If I leave now,
maybe I can be back in time.

396
00:34:06,175 --> 00:34:07,259
Thank you, darling.

397
00:34:09,011 --> 00:34:11,930
But please, Mother, don't turn it
into one of your beauty pageants.

398
00:34:11,931 --> 00:34:18,604
Oh! No, no, no. It's just a few
friends and their daughters.

399
00:34:19,689 --> 00:34:22,440
I want this to be big.

400
00:34:22,441 --> 00:34:24,901
Every princess must have
her own introduction.

401
00:34:24,902 --> 00:34:28,363
- But you said--
- Forget what I said.

402
00:34:28,364 --> 00:34:30,073
Now, send for the cooks.

403
00:34:30,074 --> 00:34:33,076
And tell the band to start rehearsing.

404
00:34:33,077 --> 00:34:37,455
And I want four footmen
for every carriage. Ha-ha!

405
00:34:37,456 --> 00:34:38,916
Maybe five.

406
00:34:40,793 --> 00:34:45,464
Let me get this straight.
Every night, when the moonlight leaves the lake, you...

407
00:34:48,509 --> 00:34:49,551
Right.

408
00:34:49,552 --> 00:34:54,473
The following night, if I want to turn back into a human,
I have to be on the lake.

409
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:59,227
Hmph. All she needs is a little moonlight.
Me, I have to be smooched.

410
00:34:59,228 --> 00:35:04,733
No fear. You fly to your prince,
we bring him back to the lake,

411
00:35:04,734 --> 00:35:08,570
the moon comes up,
you change into a princess, and:

412
00:35:10,114 --> 00:35:11,656
Happily ever after.

413
00:35:11,657 --> 00:35:14,743
- How will I find him?
- You don't know where he is?

414
00:35:14,744 --> 00:35:16,745
I don't even know where I am.

415
00:35:16,746 --> 00:35:20,415
- I bet he does.
- Oh, that's a great idea.

416
00:35:20,416 --> 00:35:25,253
Just say, "Monsieur Rothbart, I'd like to leave now.
Do you have a map or something?"

417
00:35:25,254 --> 00:35:26,921
Ah! That's it.

418
00:35:26,922 --> 00:35:28,089
A map.

419
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:30,633

Ouch.

Whenever I have to do something quick,
I always bring a turtle.

Speed gets the hand-off.

00:37:41,348 --> 00:37:42,266

There's Derek's kingdom. When do we leave?

477
00:39:11,063 --> 00:39:14,191
- It's a mouse.
- The great animal.

478
00:39:14,566 --> 00:39:18,611
Ha-ha. A tad small, wouldn't you say?

479
00:39:18,612 --> 00:39:22,866
Yeah, until it changes into this.

480
00:39:24,284 --> 00:39:27,120
An animal that can change its shape.

481
00:39:27,121 --> 00:39:29,664
A harmless creature approaches,

482
00:39:29,665 --> 00:39:33,210
then suddenly it's too late.

483
00:39:33,877 --> 00:39:38,048
- You mean, it could be anything?
- Anything.

484
00:39:44,304 --> 00:39:48,182
Odette, I apologize for
the way I've been acting.

485
00:39:48,183 --> 00:39:49,642
It's all right, Jean-Bob.

486
00:39:49,643 --> 00:39:56,232
No, no. This Derek is very important to you,
and all I can do is think of myself.

487
00:39:56,233 --> 00:39:57,900
Everyone does that.

488
00:39:57,901 --> 00:40:01,487
Please, Odette, don't make this more difficult
than it already is.

489
00:40:01,488 --> 00:40:05,742
- Accept my apology, please.
- Okay. I accept.

490
00:40:05,743 --> 00:40:08,703
Good. Now we can kiss and make up.

491
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:10,079
Jean-Bob.

492
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,956
What? What did I say? What? What?

493
00:40:11,957 --> 00:40:13,375
Ten-hut.

494
00:40:14,043 --> 00:40:16,294
It is zero hour, troops.

495
00:40:16,295 --> 00:40:19,714
- Odette, prepare for takeoff.
- Right.

496
00:40:19,715 --> 00:40:23,843
The rest of you have your assignments.
Is everyone ready?

497
00:40:23,844 --> 00:40:25,970
Ready for action, sir.

498
00:40:25,971 --> 00:40:27,555
How about you, Jean-Bob?

499
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,601
Jean-Bob?

500
00:40:33,145 --> 00:40:37,523
- Highness.
<i>- Oui,</i> I am ready.

501
00:40:37,524 --> 00:40:38,525
Take off!

502
00:40:40,486 --> 00:40:43,696
Good luck. Have a nice flight.

503
00:40:43,697 --> 00:40:50,369
Remember, if anything happens to her,
I'll have you whipped, flogged,

504
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:51,704
put on the rack,

505
00:40:51,705 --> 00:40:57,461
and then have your back
legs fried in butter!

506
00:41:08,847 --> 00:41:12,391
He's in here, Brom. I can feel it.

507
00:41:12,392 --> 00:41:15,436
How will you know the great
animal when you see it?

508
00:41:15,437 --> 00:41:16,730
I'll know.

509
00:41:17,439 --> 00:41:18,816
Better stay close.

510
00:41:19,817 --> 00:41:21,318
If you say so.

511
00:41:34,998 --> 00:41:38,001
Derek? Derek, where are you?

512
00:41:38,669 --> 00:41:41,338
- Shh, shh.
- Oh. Sorry. Heh.

513
00:42:10,951 --> 00:42:12,202
Derek?

514
00:42:13,912 --> 00:42:15,873
Oh! Oh! Oh! Derek!

515
00:42:17,666 --> 00:42:19,834
We'd better keep an eye out for hunters.

516
00:42:21,545 --> 00:42:23,462
At ease, Odette.

517
00:42:23,463 --> 00:42:27,425
I can smell a human a mile away.

518
00:42:27,426 --> 00:42:31,470
- Ah! Where did that come from?
- Derek!

519
00:42:31,471 --> 00:42:34,850
Ah! Derek. He's here.

520
00:42:35,893 --> 00:42:40,313
You will not lose control.
You will follow the plan as outlined.

521
00:42:40,314 --> 00:42:43,442
Acknowledge. Acknowle-- Ah!

522
00:42:44,693 --> 00:42:45,819
Odette!

523
00:43:09,468 --> 00:43:10,302
Odette?

524
00:43:17,976 --> 00:43:23,398
I've got you now. Heh-heh.
Don't give me that innocent look.

525
00:43:23,857 --> 00:43:26,944
Change! Go ahead, change.

526
00:43:27,736 --> 00:43:29,613
I'm not afraid of you.

527
00:43:45,879 --> 00:43:47,297
Ah! Derek.

528
00:43:52,844 --> 00:43:56,847
A swan? A swan.

529
00:43:56,848 --> 00:44:00,894
Of course. It's not what it seems.

530
00:44:02,479 --> 00:44:04,815
Just a little closer.

531
00:44:05,607 --> 00:44:08,944
Come on. Come on.

532
00:44:10,112 --> 00:44:10,946
Derek.

533
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:13,949
This one's for Odette.

534
00:44:14,491 --> 00:44:16,410
Ah! Odette!

535
00:44:23,041 --> 00:44:25,961
Whew! Hoo. Oh, that was close.

536
00:44:27,087 --> 00:44:29,798
It's working, here he comes.

537
00:44:30,924 --> 00:44:33,677
Hey! Slow down. You're going to lose him.

538
00:44:36,805 --> 00:44:39,640
Slow down.

539
00:44:39,641 --> 00:44:42,519
- He's too close.
- Too close?

540
00:44:43,353 --> 00:44:45,772
He can't even see us anymore, let alone--

541
00:44:46,106 --> 00:44:48,275
Ah! Speed up, girl.

542
00:44:49,401 --> 00:44:52,028
- That boy of yours can move.
- I told you.

543
00:44:52,029 --> 00:44:54,155
He's faster than you thought.

544
00:44:54,156 --> 00:44:57,993
Don't worry, Odette. I've been taught
what to do in this situation.

545
00:44:58,368 --> 00:44:59,202
Well?

546
00:45:00,203 --> 00:45:01,038
Puffin!

547
00:45:01,705 --> 00:45:02,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

548
00:45:02,831 --> 00:45:06,876
When the archer has you in his sights,
fly into the sun and use its light.

549
00:45:06,877 --> 00:45:08,378
Follow me!

550
00:45:14,676 --> 00:45:19,389
What did I tell you, Odette?
All we have to do is stay in the sun.

551
00:45:29,232 --> 00:45:32,152
All right, don't panic. Don't panic. Uh...

552
00:45:34,071 --> 00:45:36,698
- Puffin! Into the trees.
- Odette! Hurry!

553
00:45:42,621 --> 00:45:47,124
We'd better think of something quick,
or else we're dead ducks.

554
00:45:47,125 --> 00:45:52,756
Remember what the possum said:
When there's no escape, you have to play dead.

555
00:45:54,091 --> 00:45:58,387
Heh-heh. Gives it the right touch, yes?
Wait till I give you a...

556
00:46:20,909 --> 00:46:24,829
Ha-ha! That'll put some
distance between us.

557
00:46:28,166 --> 00:46:30,167
No sign of them yet.

558
00:46:30,168 --> 00:46:35,507
- I hope that pudgy Puffin knows what he's doing.
- Incoming.

559
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:44,850
Ha-ha! There they are.

560
00:46:52,566 --> 00:46:54,693
It's almost time, Odette. Look.

561
00:46:58,405 --> 00:47:01,198
- I can't do it.
- Well, you have to.

562
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:03,034
He'll kill me, Puffin.

563
00:47:04,161 --> 00:47:07,539
You don't do it now,
you've lost your chance for life.

564
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:09,875
All right.

565
00:47:11,626 --> 00:47:13,044
- I'll do it.
- Go.

566
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,634
What?

567
00:47:21,052 --> 00:47:23,138
All right, come on, come on.

568
00:47:30,395 --> 00:47:31,563
Got ya.

569
00:47:55,712 --> 00:47:56,796
Hello, Derek.

570
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:09,517
Oh, Derek, I've missed you so.

571
00:48:09,518 --> 00:48:12,186
No one believed me. But I knew.

572
00:48:12,187 --> 00:48:15,272
- You can't stay.
- Can't stay?

573
00:48:15,273 --> 00:48:17,942
No, I'll never let you
out of my sight again.

574
00:48:17,943 --> 00:48:20,319
- Listen to me, Derek.
- Odette.

575
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:23,447
- Oh, no.
- Who is it? What's going on?

576
00:48:23,448 --> 00:48:25,282
- It's him.
- Who?

577
00:48:25,283 --> 00:48:27,868
- He has me under a spell.
- Who does?

578
00:48:27,869 --> 00:48:29,119
Odette!

579
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:33,832
- Let him come. I'll--
- No. He has great power, you must go.

580
00:48:33,833 --> 00:48:36,418
- Then you're coming with me.
- I can't.

581
00:48:36,419 --> 00:48:39,088
When the moon sets,
I'll turn back into a swan.

582
00:48:39,089 --> 00:48:42,758
Please, Derek, you have to trust me. Go.

583
00:48:42,759 --> 00:48:45,261
There must be some way to break the spell.

584
00:48:45,262 --> 00:48:49,515
Oh, there is. You must make
a vow of everlasting love.

585
00:48:49,516 --> 00:48:51,725
I make it. It's all I've ever wanted.

586
00:48:51,726 --> 00:48:55,312
- You must prove it to the world.
- How? How?

587
00:48:55,313 --> 00:48:56,647
I don't know.

588
00:48:56,648 --> 00:48:59,192
- Odette?
- Go!

589
00:49:00,569 --> 00:49:04,822
The ball.
Tomorrow night, come to the castle.

590
00:49:04,823 --> 00:49:10,119
Before the whole world,
I will make a vow of everlasting love.

591
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:14,540
- Odette!
- I'm coming! Go.

592
00:49:14,541 --> 00:49:18,544
- Tomorrow night.
- Yes, tomorrow night.

593
00:49:18,545 --> 00:49:19,629
Now go.

594
00:49:22,757 --> 00:49:26,969
Odette! Didn't you hear me calling?

595
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:29,388
I... I...

596
00:49:29,389 --> 00:49:32,892
I thought I heard voices.

597
00:49:34,102 --> 00:49:37,396
- Odette, Odette.
- Voices?

598
00:49:37,397 --> 00:49:41,066
- Yes, voices.
- Well, I...

599
00:49:41,067 --> 00:49:42,318
You what?

600
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:45,487
I've decided to become your queen.

601
00:49:46,823 --> 00:49:50,200
No. You mean...?

602
00:49:50,201 --> 00:49:54,413
Ha-ha. Odette, you've made me so happy.

603
00:49:54,414 --> 00:49:56,373
I'll be a good king, you'll see.

604
00:49:56,374 --> 00:50:01,212
I'll wear nice clothes,
and I'm gonna get my beard trimmed.

605
00:50:02,422 --> 00:50:05,967
Oh, you've made me so happy, Odette.

606
00:50:08,595 --> 00:50:14,768
By the way, you wouldn't happen to know
who this belongs to, would you?

607
00:50:17,187 --> 00:50:20,064
"Come to the ball.

608
00:50:20,065 --> 00:50:24,527
I will make a vow of everlasting love."

609
00:50:27,864 --> 00:50:31,368
Thought you could fool Rothbart, did you?

610
00:50:32,952 --> 00:50:37,499
I will never be yours, you creature!

611
00:50:37,957 --> 00:50:42,544
- I will marry Prince Derek. And you cannot stop me.
- Oh...

612
00:50:42,545 --> 00:50:45,048
I hate to tell you this, Odette.

613
00:50:45,799 --> 00:50:50,886
But you won't be able to attend
the big ball tomorrow night.

614
00:50:50,887 --> 00:50:55,391
If you want to stop me,
you'll have to kill me.

615
00:50:55,392 --> 00:50:58,560
No. I don't think so.

616
00:50:58,561 --> 00:51:01,814
You see, you've forgotten
one very important thing.

617
00:51:01,815 --> 00:51:07,236
Tomorrow night... there is no moon.

618
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:30,927
No matter what they do,
I'm always one step ahead.

619
00:51:31,386 --> 00:51:35,432
On the other hand,
Prince Derek's vow could ruin everything.

620
00:51:36,641 --> 00:51:41,395
- I'm going to have to deal with him. But how?
- Hmm.

621
00:51:41,396 --> 00:51:47,026
The vow. I'll get Derek to offer
his vow to the wrong princess.

622
00:51:48,528 --> 00:51:52,699
That's it. Ha-ha.
I'll make you look like Odette.

623
00:51:53,158 --> 00:51:57,411
Well, that's gonna take a lot of
work, but it'll be worth it.

624
00:51:57,412 --> 00:52:03,876
Because when he makes his vow to
the wrong girl, Odette will die.

625
00:52:03,877 --> 00:52:07,838
Then I'll finish Derek off myself.

626
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:14,846
Oh, I love it. I mean,

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Ha-ha.

661
00:54:52,962 --> 00:54:55,547
- Mother, have you se--?
- Oh, Derek.

662
00:54:55,548 --> 00:54:58,008
- What are these?
- Roses.

663
00:54:58,009 --> 00:55:00,302
- They're red.
- Of course they're red.

664
00:55:00,303 --> 00:55:03,096
But, Mom, I don't want red roses.

665
00:55:03,097 --> 00:55:05,641
I want white, like a swan.

666
00:55:05,642 --> 00:55:07,643
- Have you seen Bromley?
- No.

667
00:55:07,644 --> 00:55:09,978
Has anyone seen Bromley?

668
00:55:09,979 --> 00:55:11,897
Would you feed this to a swan?

669
00:55:11,898 --> 00:55:13,691
I...

670
00:55:14,233 --> 00:55:17,653
Take it back.
For something light, something fresh.

671
00:55:19,113 --> 00:55:22,324
- No, no, no, Rogers, hold it.
- What's wrong?

672
00:55:22,325 --> 00:55:26,495
Tonight the music must be played <i>rubato.</i>

673
00:55:26,496 --> 00:55:29,748
Soft and graceful, like a swan.

674
00:55:29,749 --> 00:55:31,249
A swan?

675
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:35,379
- You ever seen a swan, Rogers?
- Of course I've seen a swan.

676
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:39,175
If you could play a swan,
what would it sound like?

677
00:55:42,428 --> 00:55:45,306
Soft and graceful, Rogers.

678
00:55:46,307 --> 00:55:50,310
- Where is Bromley?
- No one has seen him, Derek.

679
00:55:50,311 --> 00:55:53,146
You're kidding. Who's gonna be my best man?

680
00:55:53,147 --> 00:55:55,191
Best...? You mean...?

681
00:55:56,526 --> 00:55:59,319
You... Oh, Derek.

682
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:02,114
There you go, Rogers. That's the stuff.

683
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,494
Come on, Mother.

684
00:56:11,416 --> 00:56:14,502
Don't be so secretive, Derek.
Tell me who she is.

685
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:25,179
It hurts me to lock you up, Odette.

686
00:56:25,638 --> 00:56:27,849
Hurts me deep.

687
00:56:28,516 --> 00:56:33,145
But then, a king's day is
full of tough decisions.

688
00:56:33,146 --> 00:56:34,772
You understand.

689
00:56:35,898 --> 00:56:38,984
Oh... Now you're mad at me again.

690
00:56:38,985 --> 00:56:44,072
Doggone it, I can't do nothing right.
Head full of pudding.

691
00:56:44,073 --> 00:56:45,116
That's me.

693
00:56:53,041 --> 00:56:59,255
Hmm. I know. If you can't attend the ball,
then I'll bring the ball to you.

694
00:56:59,672 --> 00:57:00,797
Let's see.

No, please. I beg you. Please!

698

Poor fella. He got lost in the woods.

Help. Help! Don't go.

700
00:57:30,078 --> 00:57:36,834
Oh, I'd love to stay, but if I don't
leave now, I'll be late. That's tacky.

701
00:57:38,961 --> 00:57:43,132
Don't give me that look.
Had to be sneaky, didn't you?

702
00:57:43,591 --> 00:57:46,551
Had to drag your weakling prince into it.

- An idea. A substantial idea.

- A large, colossal idea!
- Sounds big.

725
01:00:00,853 --> 01:00:05,732
I got it! Water leaks
into the dungeon, right?

726
01:00:05,733 --> 01:00:09,445
Well, if there's a leak,
there must be a hole.

727
01:00:09,904 --> 01:00:12,489
We'll find the hole, make it bigger and...

Who's going to jump into this moat?

732

- He's got to be a good swimmer.
- I should say so.

733
01:00:34,136 --> 01:00:36,137

01:00:38,182 --> 01:00:41,518
And it wouldn't hurt if he was green,
for camouflage purposes.

01:11:28,332 --> 01:11:33,544
It's you! You have no power here.

844
01:11:33,545 --> 01:11:37,424
I made a vow. A vow of everlasting love.

845
01:11:40,427 --> 01:11:46,808
You made a vow, all right.
A vow of everlasting... death!

846
01:11:49,603 --> 01:11:52,064
No! Odette!

847
01:11:56,485 --> 01:12:01,239
You should have left her to me.
Now Odette will die.

848
01:12:02,366 --> 01:12:03,533
Odette!

849
01:12:07,287 --> 01:12:08,287
Odette!

850
01:12:12,751 --> 01:12:16,338
<i>- She's fading fast, little prince.</i>
- No!

851
01:12:24,513 --> 01:12:26,014
Something's gone wrong.

852
01:12:38,110 --> 01:12:43,615
<i>If you hurry, little prince,
I'll let you see her one last time.</i>

853
01:12:58,547 --> 01:12:59,673
There she is.

854
01:13:02,718 --> 01:13:04,885
I don't think she's gonna make it.

855
01:13:04,886 --> 01:13:07,388
This way, Odette.

856
01:13:07,389 --> 01:13:10,058
Keep coming, girl. Come on, now.

857
01:13:37,461 --> 01:13:38,336
Odette?

858
01:13:43,050 --> 01:13:44,718
Oh, what have I done to you?

859
01:13:46,094 --> 01:13:48,929
Forgive me, Odette.

860
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:50,348
Forgive me.

861
01:13:51,641 --> 01:13:52,809
Derek?

862
01:13:54,519 --> 01:13:57,647
Yes, Odette. I'm here.

863
01:13:58,899 --> 01:14:02,402
Derek, I feel so weak.

864
01:14:03,278 --> 01:14:05,113
I think I'm...

865
01:14:05,781 --> 01:14:11,912
No, you'll live, Odette.
The vow I made was for you.

866
01:14:12,829 --> 01:14:13,914
I know.

867
01:14:15,791 --> 01:14:17,876
I love you, Derek.

868
01:14:20,378 --> 01:14:21,505
Odette?

869
01:14:22,422 --> 01:14:23,381
Odette.

870
01:14:24,883 --> 01:14:25,842
Odette.

871
01:14:26,718 --> 01:14:31,181
I made the vow for her. Do you hear?!

872
01:14:32,641 --> 01:14:36,769
The vow I made was for her!

873
01:14:36,770 --> 01:14:38,522
No need to shout.

874
01:14:39,689 --> 01:14:41,273
Don't let her die.

875
01:14:41,274 --> 01:14:45,069
- Is that a threat?
- Don't you dare let her die.

876
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:47,738
Ooh, it is a threat.

877
01:14:47,739 --> 01:14:51,827
You're the only one with the power.
Now, do it!

878
01:14:53,245 --> 01:14:57,331
Only if you defeat me.

879
01:15:05,048 --> 01:15:06,591
The great animal.

880
01:15:08,426 --> 01:15:10,345
I'm betting on the animal.

881
01:15:10,929 --> 01:15:13,098
No!

882
01:15:19,563 --> 01:15:21,731
I won't let her die.

883
01:15:41,501 --> 01:15:43,837
The bow. Derek's bow.

884
01:15:44,504 --> 01:15:48,091
- Swim to the bottom of the lake and get the bow.
- Ah!

885
01:16:30,425 --> 01:16:33,093
Throw it, throw it, throw it.

886
01:16:38,141 --> 01:16:40,769
Wake up. Wake up. Hello!

887
01:16:41,978 --> 01:16:43,104
Goodbye.

888
01:16:46,066 --> 01:16:47,775
- Help, please.
- Brom?

889
01:16:47,776 --> 01:16:49,110
Please, oh, please, oh, please.

890
01:17:16,012 --> 01:17:17,305
Forgive me, Odette.

891
01:17:18,765 --> 01:17:20,683
Forgive me.

892
01:17:20,684 --> 01:17:23,603
I only wanted to break the spell.

893
01:17:25,438 --> 01:17:27,065
To prove my love.

894
01:17:30,610 --> 01:17:34,823
I love you. Your kindness and courage.

895
01:17:36,074 --> 01:17:37,450
I always have.

896
01:17:42,622 --> 01:17:45,250
- Derek?
- Odette?

897
01:17:46,501 --> 01:17:48,044
Oh, Derek.

898
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:55,302
Well, there you have it.
Everlasting love.

899
01:18:34,257 --> 01:18:39,136
Well, Rogers, old man.
I suppose you owe me an apology.

900
01:18:39,137 --> 01:18:45,059
After all, if it weren't for me,
the great animal would still be alive.

901
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:49,813
- Dear me, no.
- What?

902
01:18:49,814 --> 01:18:54,068
The great animal. It's alive!

903
01:18:55,528 --> 01:18:58,781
- Uberta.
- Rogers.

904
01:19:03,620 --> 01:19:07,247
I don't care if everyone
else does have the day off.

905
01:19:07,248 --> 01:19:09,792
The prince wants a fighting air force,

906
01:19:09,793 --> 01:19:13,962
and it's my job to get you birds in shape.

907
01:19:13,963 --> 01:19:18,510
You're in Puffin's army now.
General Puffin.

908
01:19:24,182 --> 01:19:27,976
I am ready for my kiss, mademoiselle.

909
01:19:27,977 --> 01:19:31,772
Now, don't be too disappointed, Jean-Bob,
if nothing happens.

910
01:19:31,773 --> 01:19:36,653
Finally, after all these years,
I shall return to my throne.

911
01:19:37,028 --> 01:19:41,532
- Don't forget to write.
- You still don't believe me, do you?

912
01:19:41,533 --> 01:19:44,284
The only thing you're gonna turn is red.

913
01:19:45,745 --> 01:19:49,416
Well, I am ready, Odette.

914
01:19:58,842 --> 01:20:04,097
Voilà! Well, Speed,
what do you have to say now?

915
01:20:04,639 --> 01:20:05,597
Uh...

916
01:20:05,598 --> 01:20:07,891
That's what I thought.

917
01:20:07,892 --> 01:20:10,102
And now, if you don't mind,

918
01:20:10,103 --> 01:20:12,689
I've got some schmoozing to do.

919
01:20:19,446 --> 01:20:26,411
- Would you like a kiss too, Speed?
- Nah, heh, I'm happy as a turtle.

920
01:20:30,331 --> 01:20:33,626
Ha-ha! The ladies still fall for me.

921
01:20:47,724 --> 01:20:51,561
Will you love me, Derek,
till the day I die?

922
01:20:52,270 --> 01:20:55,482
No. Much longer than that, Odette.

923
01:20:56,858 --> 01:20:57,983
