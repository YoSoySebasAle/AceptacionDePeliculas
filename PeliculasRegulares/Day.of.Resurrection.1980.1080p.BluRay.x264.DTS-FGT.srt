1
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:23,688
December, 1983.

2
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:41,122
The Nereid,
a British atomic submarine

3
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:51,090
Tokyo Bay, Japan

4
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,790
I'm pregnant.

5
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:42,548
I'm pregnant.

6
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:47,762
But it's of no matter to you.

7
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:54,061
Farewell.

8
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:25,503
In the fall of 1982,
mankind died out...

9
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:29,716
Leaving only 863 people
alive on Antarctica.

10
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:35,096
How could this have happened?

11
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:46,438
Virus - Resurrection Day

12
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:16,896
In 1981...

13
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,442
All genetic engineering
experiments...

14
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:24,029
...to create new viruses...

15
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:28,075
...were banned internationally.

16
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:31,416
However, one year later...

17
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:37,964
February, 1982

18
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:43,302
Leipzig - East Germany

19
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:49,430
Military Biological
Research Center

70
00:10:50,427 --> 00:10:52,766
Herr professor!

71
00:11:04,842 --> 00:11:09,558
Close that or the coffee gets cold.
I've got to drive 60 kilometers today.

72
00:11:09,558 --> 00:11:13,890
I'm sorry, professor.
It's pretty bad weather.

73
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:16,190
I have no choice.
My sister is sick.

74
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:21,174
I am sorry. Please drive carefully.
Thank you.

20
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:22,761
March, 1982

21
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:27,721
University of Maryland,
United States

22
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:38,357
Biological Research Center

23
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:15,758
April, 1982

24
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:19,720
Soviet Union -
Republic of Kazakhstan

25
00:23:57,645 --> 00:24:00,728
Italy - Milan

26
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,307
Italian flu rages
through the country

27
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:41,594
government authorities
are concerned

28
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:49,106
Italian flu - is it a new virus?

29
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:55,199
May, 1982

30
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:59,119
South Pole - Showa Station

31
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:15,343
Leader, it's a message
from the capital.

32
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:22,176
"We hope to have the Italian flu
under control soon.

33
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:25,104
Please calm down
and continue your observations.”

34
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:27,856
A superficial response,
as usual.

35
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,023
Doesn't calm me down.

36
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:31,894
Let's pin it up
in the cafeteria.

37
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,521
It should make
everyone feel better.

38
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,034
Yes, sir.

39
00:25:58,182 --> 00:26:00,343
It's that Australian group
from next door.

40
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:28,211
Let me speak.

41
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:12,078
Can an unknown disease
like that...

42
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,378
Really exist?

43
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:15,789
How should I know?

44
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,626
All I know is that
the whole world's in a panic.

45
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,587
Matsuo! Connect the electricity!

46
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,846
Roger!

47
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,011
You amaze me.

48
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:28,515
Doesn't it bother you at all?

49
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,320
Hey.

50
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,525
He's got a girlfriend.

51
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:42,073
She's my wife's friend.
She's really beautiful.

52
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:44,318
What do you think?

53
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:48,822
Huh?

54
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,202
I won't say anything bad.

55
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:52,785
Why don't you ask about her
by telegraph sometime?

56
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:57,581
We broke up.

57
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,760
Broke up?

58
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:02,757
She probably couldn't
put up with me.

59
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,421
- But you...
- Matsuo!

60
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,723
- Let's do this.
- Hey!

61
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:28,529
I'm pregnant.

62
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:36,120
The child will be born
while you're at the South Pole.

63
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:45,723
I'm lying.

64
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:50,092
But even if it were true...

65
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,599
It's of no importance to you.

66
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,265
No matter what happened to me...

67
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:58,396
You'd still go, right?

68
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:04,617
That's right.

69
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,699
Earthquakes
and the South Pole...

70
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,990
Are all you care about, right?

71
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:17,411
Let's break up...

72
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:18,506
After all.

73
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:20,038
You and I.

74
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,966
Banzai!

75
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,139
I didn't think you'd come.

76
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:43,653
As far as the child goes...

77
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,444
I told you it was a lie.

78
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:49,451
Either way...

79
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,236
it doesn't matter to you.

80
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:55,498
I'm sorry.

81
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,792
I hadn't planned
to say something like this.

82
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,620
In truth...

83
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,876
I wanted to see you off
with a smile.

84
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,083
Go in good health.

85
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:06,922
Farewell.

86
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,473
June, 1982 - Tokyo

87
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,645
- Move aside!
- It's an emergency!

88
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,822
- Out of our way!
- Let us through!

89
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,028
- It's an emergency!
- Let us through!

90
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:13,329
Excuse Me!

91
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:33,589
Miss Noriko?

92
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:36,592
Miss Yoshiko.

93
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:38,101
What's wrong?

94
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,146
You're so pale!

95
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:40,971
Nothing's wrong.

96
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,230
I'm just a little tired.

97
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,642
Akira, what's wrong?

98
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:46,695
Do you have a cold?

99
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:48,406
Vaccinations.

100
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:50,189
It was hard...

101
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:51,448
So early in the morning.

102
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:55,704
Miss Noriko!

103
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,540
Miss Noriko!

104
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,617
Miss Noriko!

105
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,043
You're awake.

106
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:15,430
You stayed with me?

107
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:19,851
What are you saying?

108
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:22,225
More importantly, are you okay?

109
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,226
Yes.

110
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,626
They couldn't save it?

111
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,086
The baby.

112
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,921
Recently, I've been so busy...

113
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:53,968
I overexerted myself.

114
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,759
Did Mr. Yoshizumi...

115
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:57,888
...know about it?

116
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,891
I did something cruel.

117
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:07,649
I thought I could
raise her myself.

118
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:28,120
White House - the Oval Office

119
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,593
July, 1982

120
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:39,310
Martial law is instituted
in all of Japan

121
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:03,483
When did this start?

122
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:05,058
He was coughing last night...

123
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:07,144
But he suddenly
went limp this morning.

124
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:10,897
You, take him to a room quickly!

125
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:12,357
We have to examine him now.

126
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,492
Take a lung biopsy.
His heart is weak, too.

127
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:15,579
Will he be okay?!

128
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:16,698
We must take him now!

129
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:19,030
But doctor, my husband
is in the hospital...

130
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,956
And I have a 101 degree fever.

131
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:23,709
All the hospitals are full,
and I've been waiting!

132
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:24,796
Please calm down.

133
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,704
After the flu test,
he'll get better.

134
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,209
- Come on.
- This way.

135
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:29,836
Okay, next patient.

136
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:34,723
Doctor!

137
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:36,850
I'm fine.

138
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:38,852
I'm okay.

139
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,052
Please rest a bit.

140
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,264
I'll take over for you.

141
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:43,722
- Okay, please take over.
- Yes, sir.

142
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:50,697
Doctor.

143
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,900
Please hang in there!

144
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:54,736
Thank you.

145
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,033
Shall I get you some tea?

146
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,079
I'm fine.

147
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,653
You've got to have something!

148
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:00,207
We have milk, too.

149
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:01,739
- Get me some water.
- Yes, sir.

150
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,704
Did you hear today's news?

151
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:11,750
The death toll
has passed 30 million.

152
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,304
That many?

153
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:17,638
The mortality rate...

154
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,215
Is 459%!

155
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:22,094
They say it may keep growing!

156
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:24,815
Doctor...

157
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:28,642
How long will this continue?

158
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:29,695
I don't know.

159
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,941
But we must do
everything we can.

160
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,987
Everything must end sometime.

161
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:45,082
The question is,
how will it end?

162
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:19,902
August, 1982

163
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:41,176
It's no use!

164
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,517
How many days
since we lost contact?

165
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,562
This is the eighth day.

166
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:50,435
It seems to be
a terrible situation.

167
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:51,816
I don't believe it!

168
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:53,935
How could Japan be ruined...

169
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,444
...in just three months?!

170
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:56,775
How could that be?!

171
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,529
Tatsuno, that voice!

172
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:07,574
Are you calling us?

173
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:52,160
It's no use, he's pushing
down the Mike button!

174
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:53,703
He doesn't know how to use it.

175
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:18,830
He must have...

176
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:21,841
...gone on to heaven.

177
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:23,470
You asshole!

178
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,392
Mr. Tatsuno!

179
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:34,439
Asshole!

180
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:51,639
September, 1982

181
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:57,987
New York - 7.4 million dead

182
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:07,246
London - 6.9 million dead

183
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:18,591
Paris - 2.3 million dead

184
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:32,472
Rome - 2.9 million dead

185
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:44,234
Moscow - 7.8 million dead

186
00:52:48,374 --> 00:52:54,335
Tokyo, 10 million dead

187
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:37,767
Miss Yoshiko.

188
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:41,194
Miss Yoshiko.

189
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,022
Akira!

190
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:01,107
You're here!

191
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:04,482
You're alive.

192
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:11,735
I'm sorry.

193
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:13,025
You were lonely, right?

194
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:18,708
Akira...

195
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:23,581
Do you want to come with me
to where Papa is?

196
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,120
What about Mama?

197
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:28,798
Your Mama...

198
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,131
Can't come with us.

199
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:35,134
That's why
I'll take you to Papa.

200
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:40,018
Papa will be happy!

201
00:56:48,614 --> 00:56:49,614
Are you cold?

202
00:57:03,629 --> 00:57:05,210
Please...

203
00:57:05,297 --> 00:57:06,582
...drink this.

204
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:07,673
What is it?

205
00:57:09,885 --> 00:57:11,750
It will stop you
from being cold.

206
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:27,266
What's wrong?

207
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:29,820
It's nothing.

208
00:57:34,743 --> 00:57:35,743
Akira...

209
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:37,947
Try calling your Papa.

210
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:40,245
Papa.

211
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:44,249
Louder.

212
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:46,413
Papa!

213
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:49,170
One more time.

214
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,040
Papa!

215
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:56,049
Papa!

216
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:11,203
Is that you, Tatsuno?

217
00:59:20,432 --> 00:59:21,432
Tatsuno!

218
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:34,817
Hey!

219
00:59:35,447 --> 00:59:36,857
Tatsuno's gone somewhere.

220
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:38,028
- What?!
- Stay here.

221
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:51,497
Tatsuno!

222
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,506
Tatsuno!

223
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:10,731
Tatsuno!

224
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:13,856
Tatsuno!

225
01:00:13,902 --> 01:00:15,858
Tatsuno!

226
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:20,026
Tatsuno!

227
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:24,109
Tatsuno!

228
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:33,410
Yoshizumi!

229
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:36,966
Hey!

230
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:39,211
Yoshizumi!

231
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:42,638
Yoshizumi!

232
01:00:43,557 --> 01:00:44,888
You can't go any further!

233
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:47,971
Let's search again
once the blizzard has ended!

234
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:49,061
Let me go!

235
01:00:49,104 --> 01:00:50,560
Yoshizumi!

236
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:53,722
Tatsuno has gone to join
his wife and child.

238
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:56,599
If I could,
I'd do the same thing!

239
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:00,395
Tatsuno!

240
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:01,779
Yoshizumi!

241
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:06,702
Soviet Union's Mirny Station

242
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:12,540
Chile's Frei Montalva Station

243
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:40,277
Frances D'Urville Station

244
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:50,212
November, 1982

245
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:03,649
Dawn already?

246
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:05,981
Want me to drive?

247
01:12:06,072 --> 01:12:08,438
I'm alright. Please sleep.

248
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:09,651
I can't.

249
01:12:10,535 --> 01:12:13,242
Only five days left
until the Antarctic conference.

250
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:15,987
Until we reach Palmer station...

251
01:12:16,082 --> 01:12:17,538
...we'll have to keep this pace.

252
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:20,916
Will all 11 countries...

253
01:12:20,962 --> 01:12:22,577
...be at the antarctic conference?

254
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:25,709
They should be.

255
01:12:26,717 --> 01:12:28,503
It's a meeting
to decide the fate...

256
01:12:28,553 --> 01:12:30,043
...of the survivors, after all.

257
01:12:30,805 --> 01:12:31,920
We can't be late.

258
01:12:55,705 --> 01:12:57,161
Wait a second.

259
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:00,292
Hit it again!

260
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:15,056
It's no use!

261
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:17,556
I'm sorry.

262
01:13:17,643 --> 01:13:18,883
It's not your fault.

263
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,885
What should we do?

264
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:21,938
There's no time!

265
01:13:22,857 --> 01:13:23,857
Shall we walk?

266
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:26,067
Walk?

267
01:13:26,152 --> 01:13:28,564
We're still 620 miles
away from Palmer station!

268
01:13:28,613 --> 01:13:30,899
Even I couldn't be so reckless.

269
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:32,605
But since we've come this far...

270
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:34,691
...Norway's station
should be close.

271
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:36,325
We should be fine
if we go there.

272
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:34,255
She's pregnant!

273
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:01,843
Yoshizumi...

274
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:02,927
Yes?

275
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:05,177
Can you stay here
with that woman?

276
01:18:05,222 --> 01:18:06,222
Huh?

277
01:18:06,307 --> 01:18:08,298
I have to get
to the conference on time.

278
01:18:09,059 --> 01:18:10,094
So there's no way...

279
01:18:10,144 --> 01:18:13,557
I can take a woman
about to give birth along with me.

280
01:18:15,232 --> 01:18:17,814
Since you're single,
please take care of her.

281
01:18:19,904 --> 01:18:20,984
I understand.

282
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:24,863
I'll figure something out.

283
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:29,781
To give birth at the South Pole
in such times as these.

284
01:18:31,165 --> 01:18:33,326
I hope she's born alright.

285
01:34:25,118 --> 01:34:28,986
One year later, virus MM-88
continued to occupy Earth.

286
01:34:29,038 --> 01:34:32,906
Mankind remained holed up
on the icy continent.

287
02:06:17,612 --> 02:06:20,479
United States - Potomac River

288
02:16:28,055 --> 02:16:31,218
Life is wonderful.

289
02:16:34,019 --> 02:16:38,137
Life is...

290
02:16:38,232 --> 02:16:39,642
...wonderful.

291
02:16:41,735 --> 02:16:44,147
Wonderful.

292
02:20:01,059 --> 02:20:04,972
The world died again.

293
02:20:05,022 --> 02:20:08,981
Several years later...

294
02:23:31,853 --> 02:23:35,892
What are you doing...

295
02:23:36,566 --> 02:23:39,228
...alone in a place like that?

296
02:23:44,699 --> 02:23:47,315
You won't answer me?

297
02:23:47,369 --> 02:23:50,611
Then, keep sleeping
there forever.

298
02:23:59,673 --> 02:24:01,629
Where are you going?

299
02:24:06,179 --> 02:24:10,764
My friends and child
are south of here.

300
02:24:11,893 --> 02:24:15,101
Child? Is it yours?

301
02:24:16,064 --> 02:24:19,727
No, but I love him very much.

302
02:24:23,905 --> 02:24:27,568
It's no use.
There's no one left.

303
02:24:30,662 --> 02:24:35,622
But I'm heading south anyway.
