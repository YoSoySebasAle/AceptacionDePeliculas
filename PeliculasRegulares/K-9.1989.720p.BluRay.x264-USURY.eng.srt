1
00:02:19,224 --> 00:02:22,557
Great. You think that's funny, chiphead?

2
00:02:22,644 --> 00:02:27,105
You know, I could pull your battery
and kill you. so don't get cocky.

3
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:37,145
- 2707 to Control.
- Control, 2707.

4
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:40,195
Message check. I'm waitin'
for a friendly named Freddie.

5
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:43,737
He's a no-show.
Is there any call-ins from him?

6
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:47,034
Control, 2707. No messages.

7
00:02:47,126 --> 00:02:50,209
All right, ten-four. I have a request
to open a phone channel.

8
00:02:50,294 --> 00:02:53,082
Patch me through to 5553312, please.

9
00:02:55,298 --> 00:02:59,167
Calling your girlfriend to say you'll
be late is nonessential communication.

10
00:02:59,261 --> 00:03:02,096
You should know that
by now, 2707. Clear.

11
00:03:04,308 --> 00:03:07,973
Clear. Ten-four.
Thanks for nothing, ControI.

12
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,857
Ah, this is great

13
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,859
Agh! Goddamn it.

14
00:03:27,455 --> 00:03:29,661
Lovers' lane.

15
00:03:30,332 --> 00:03:32,325
Hi! Police.

16
00:03:32,418 --> 00:03:35,123
This is an emergency.
I have to use your phone.

17
00:03:35,213 --> 00:03:39,080
Sorry about the upholstery. Just pretend
I'm not here, OK? I'll be a second.

18
00:03:39,176 --> 00:03:41,214
$100 bottle of champagne!

19
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:45,586
She's worth it.
Aw, damn, the machine's on, you know?

20
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,305
You have one? I hate them.

21
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,974
You got a Kleenex? Ah, forget it.
That's all right. This'll come off.

22
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,640
Ah. Hi, Tracy. Yeah, it's Dooley.

23
00:03:55,732 --> 00:03:58,602
I'm just calling to let you know
I'm gonna be a little late.

24
00:03:58,693 --> 00:03:59,689
What's that?

25
00:04:04,323 --> 00:04:05,568
I gotta go, honey.

26
00:04:20,547 --> 00:04:23,713
Well, it's not the Eyewitness News team.

27
00:04:35,436 --> 00:04:37,178
I think someone's mad at me.

28
00:04:43,276 --> 00:04:45,767
Definitely, someone is mad at me.

29
00:04:53,995 --> 00:04:56,320
- Whoo!
- Hey, Dooley!

30
00:04:56,414 --> 00:04:58,951
Got a ride home tonight?

31
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,078
- Byers, I need a car.
- Can I ask you something?

32
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:08,714
- Later. Please, I need a car. Mine blew up.
- Just one question. One question.

33
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,966
How many cops use their day off
tryin' to get their asses shot off?

34
00:05:12,054 --> 00:05:14,723
- I was set up!
- How many?

35
00:05:14,806 --> 00:05:18,672
Look, I got him, OK?
I'm this close, Rog. I got Lyman.

36
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:21,519
- Give me a number. I'll write it down.
- 50 million.

37
00:05:21,603 --> 00:05:25,186
Lyman's moving 50 million.
This is the big one, Rog, and I got him.

38
00:05:25,274 --> 00:05:27,729
Mike, you don't have dick on Lyman.
What you've got

39
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:30,735
is a wet suit,
a bad attitude and a blown-up car.

40
00:05:30,822 --> 00:05:33,147
Right. That's what I told you. I need a car.

41
00:05:33,241 --> 00:05:35,910
You want a car, take a partner.
It's a two-for-one deaI.

42
00:05:35,993 --> 00:05:38,151
- No, I'm not takin' a partner.
- Take Davis.

43
00:05:38,245 --> 00:05:41,115
- Davis hates me.
- OK, uh... spencer. How about spencer?

44
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:43,875
- I hate spencer.
- You know the roster. Pick somebody.

45
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:46,628
- Lydecker. He's a good man.
- Lydecker's dead.

46
00:05:47,045 --> 00:05:49,916
That's why I like him.
Doesn't slow me down.

47
00:05:50,006 --> 00:05:53,126
Rog. 50 million. 50 million and Lyman.

48
00:05:53,218 --> 00:05:57,594
50 million? Listen, smartass. How do you
know that there's a shipment comin' in?

49
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,380
High-tuned cop sense.
You remember that, Rog.

50
00:06:03,144 --> 00:06:05,302
That's what you used to have, remember?

51
00:06:05,396 --> 00:06:08,182
Before you became
a paper-pushin' pansy.

52
00:06:09,066 --> 00:06:12,482
Paper-pushin' pansy. I like it.
Can you say it five times reaI quick?

53
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,810
- Paper-pushin' pansy...
- You're pathetic.

54
00:06:14,904 --> 00:06:17,193
You're jealous because
I made lieutenant first.

55
00:06:17,282 --> 00:06:20,982
You're right. You're right.
I'm green with envy because

56
00:06:21,077 --> 00:06:24,861
I'd love to spend my days here with my
lips locked to the commissioner's butt!

57
00:06:24,956 --> 00:06:27,447
- Screw you, Dooley!
- Right now, Roger. Come on!

58
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:29,700
- Don't push me!
- Take your best shot!

59
00:06:33,173 --> 00:06:36,622
You did. You hit me.

60
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:39,466
I don't believe you hit me.

61
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:43,880
- Do I get the car?
- You'll take a partner?

62
00:06:43,973 --> 00:06:44,970
- No.
- No car.

63
00:06:45,057 --> 00:06:47,217
OK. Fine.

64
00:06:47,311 --> 00:06:49,598
I don't need your help.

65
00:06:49,688 --> 00:06:51,680
I'll take Lyman alone.

66
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,502
Honey?

67
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,462
Sweetheart!

68
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,342
Shit.

69
00:07:34,145 --> 00:07:36,138
Trace.

70
00:07:36,898 --> 00:07:39,603
Trace, I know you're mad.
You have every right to be.

71
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:42,777
I know tonight
was supposed to be speciaI.

72
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:46,563
I mean, the wine, the garlic chicken,
which is my favourite,

73
00:07:46,657 --> 00:07:50,405
scalloped potatoes, the peas...

74
00:07:50,494 --> 00:07:53,697
The peas. Even though I hate peas.

75
00:07:53,789 --> 00:07:57,657
They're good for me
and that shows me that you care, honey.

76
00:07:57,752 --> 00:08:01,335
I know I'm three hours late.
I am. And, uh...

77
00:08:01,421 --> 00:08:03,415
- Well, what can I say?
- Hi.

78
00:08:03,508 --> 00:08:05,299
- Hi.
- Hi.

79
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:07,625
- Hi.
- This is Chad, Mike.

80
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:10,127
- Chad?
- Yes, Chad.

81
00:08:10,221 --> 00:08:12,594
- A friend from work. Works for Pan Am.
- Uh-huh.

82
00:08:12,682 --> 00:08:15,007
One of those, uh,
baggage-handler kinda guys?

83
00:08:15,102 --> 00:08:17,806
No, more like
one of those pilot kinda guys.

84
00:08:17,896 --> 00:08:21,679
Honey, you're a book editor.
How did you meet smilin' Jack here?

85
00:08:21,774 --> 00:08:24,348
Well, he, um...
has also written three best sellers.

86
00:08:24,443 --> 00:08:29,235
- Books? Manuals? Instructions?
- Look, I've got an early flight tomorrow.

87
00:08:29,322 --> 00:08:31,316
- Maybe I...
- Thanks for the movie, Chad.

88
00:08:31,407 --> 00:08:35,073
Any time. We'll have dinner when I get
back from Hong Kong. The three of us.

89
00:08:35,161 --> 00:08:37,451
- Wow. What a night that'll be.
- Good night.

90
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:40,873
- Good night.
- Good night, Chad.

91
00:08:41,585 --> 00:08:44,787
- You're dating? That was a date?
- He's a friend. We went to the movies.

92
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,788
- Do me a favour.
- Mike.

93
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:51,589
Do me a favour. When you go to the
movies, go to the movies with ugly guys.

94
00:08:51,677 --> 00:08:53,753
Ugly guys with shitty jobs.

95
00:08:53,847 --> 00:08:57,097
- You have a shitty job.
- That's right. See what I mean?

96
00:08:57,182 --> 00:09:01,512
So we're perfect for each other.
Why didn't you wait for me?

97
00:09:01,603 --> 00:09:04,722
Because if I lived my life
around your schedule, I'd go nuts.

98
00:09:04,815 --> 00:09:07,221
I'd be a clock-tower sniper in a month.

99
00:09:07,316 --> 00:09:09,523
It's hard enough,
knowing that making a bust

100
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:12,066
is more important to you
than making time for me.

101
00:09:12,154 --> 00:09:16,448
Now, I love you, Mike, but I can't
count on you, so I do what I have to do.

102
00:09:17,785 --> 00:09:20,988
Eat your peas. They're good for you.

103
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,578
- You know, I'm onto something big.
- You always are.

104
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,908
It's Lyman. I think I got him scared.

105
00:09:27,627 --> 00:09:30,379
- He tried to kill me tonight.
- Just what I wanted to hear.

106
00:09:30,463 --> 00:09:32,954
- I feeI so much better now
- Look, look.

107
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:35,505
What do you want me to say, honey?
I'll say it.

108
00:09:35,594 --> 00:09:38,594
It's not what you say.
I know what's important to you.

109
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,055
It's not me. It's the next bust or the next
shipment or south American cheeseball.

110
00:09:43,142 --> 00:09:47,887
Now, I know that. And I either have to deaI
with that or find some other way to live.

111
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:52,855
All right. Look.
If you hate it so much, just move out.

112
00:09:52,943 --> 00:09:55,944
Just take your shoes and move out.

113
00:09:56,446 --> 00:09:58,735
I own this house. You moved in with me.

114
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,443
That's right. That's right.

115
00:10:04,662 --> 00:10:09,904
I was wondering how I could afford
such a nice place. It's really... so tasteful.

116
00:10:10,001 --> 00:10:12,706
- It's very nice. You did a very nice job.
- Mike...

117
00:10:12,794 --> 00:10:16,296
Forget it for now. I know
verbal skills aren't your strong point.

118
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:19,217
- What are my strong points?
- No, not those either.

119
00:10:19,303 --> 00:10:21,293
- You're a liar.
- You're a bragger.

120
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:31,350
Hello. Dooley.

121
00:10:34,691 --> 00:10:36,731
Got an address on Freddie, huh?

122
00:10:36,818 --> 00:10:38,810
No, give it to me.

123
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:41,896
Uh-huh.

124
00:10:43,574 --> 00:10:46,742
No, no. No black-and-whites.
I don't wanna scare him.

125
00:10:48,412 --> 00:10:50,903
Uh-huh.

126
00:10:50,998 --> 00:10:53,122
No, no.

127
00:10:56,212 --> 00:10:59,626
Oh, damn it. I missed it.

128
00:11:02,091 --> 00:11:04,084
God, I'm old.

129
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,436
- Ernie. " Que pasa?
- Bitch of a night.

130
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:26,695
- Why ain't you in bed with your old lady?
- Why aren't you?

131
00:11:26,782 --> 00:11:28,905
- Your pizza, man.
- Cheese and mushroom?

132
00:11:28,992 --> 00:11:31,779
- Like always.
- Here. seven, right?

133
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,946
- Yeah.
- How about a napkin?

134
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:36,031
How about a tip?

135
00:11:41,128 --> 00:11:43,121
Cold damn pizza.

136
00:11:46,676 --> 00:11:48,668
Gotta get a microwave in here.

137
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:56,175
You just ran a stop sign!

138
00:12:25,753 --> 00:12:27,746
Good morning.

139
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:54,313
- Hey! Freddie, my man!
- This can't be happening.

140
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:57,193
- This can't be happening!
- You thought I was dead, huh?

141
00:12:57,284 --> 00:12:59,656
Surprised to see me?
You set me up, Freddie.

142
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:02,449
- I didn't do anything!
- Then what are you running from?

143
00:13:02,539 --> 00:13:04,781
I need the exercise.

144
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:07,544
Exercise? I can help you there, Freddie.

145
00:13:07,627 --> 00:13:10,960
You know, this whole jogging thing,
I just don't get it.

146
00:13:11,046 --> 00:13:13,964
- Dooley, what the hell are you doing?
- But if you don't run,

147
00:13:14,049 --> 00:13:16,007
you miss the precious aerobic benefits.

148
00:13:16,093 --> 00:13:18,964
Make a right hand signal for me,
will you? Thank you.

149
00:13:19,053 --> 00:13:21,012
- Freddie, listen.
- What are you doin'?

150
00:13:21,098 --> 00:13:23,554
- Names, Freddie. I need names.
- I don't know!

151
00:13:23,642 --> 00:13:25,967
- You are like Edwin Moses.
- Ah, come on.

152
00:13:26,061 --> 00:13:28,765
- Great hurdler. You know that?
- Come on, buddy!

153
00:13:28,855 --> 00:13:30,977
- No, no, no!
- To be the best, you gotta go!

154
00:13:31,065 --> 00:13:33,603
- Dooley!
- Come on, buddy. Up, up.

155
00:13:33,693 --> 00:13:37,442
- OK, OK. They were dealers.
- Dealers? Watch that pole!

156
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,523
Don't wanna piss off AT&T!

157
00:13:40,282 --> 00:13:42,191
Don't do it!

158
00:13:42,285 --> 00:13:45,735
- Whoo! Names, Freddie.
- I don't know!

159
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:48,153
- Was it Lyman?
- I don't know, I swear to you.

160
00:13:48,247 --> 00:13:52,827
Benny the Mule. He was the trigger man.
Jesus, Dooley, what are you doin'?

161
00:13:53,837 --> 00:13:56,505
Oh, you got those slim Italian shoes, huh?

162
00:13:57,924 --> 00:14:00,841
I think we qualify for a carpool.

163
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:04,047
Dooley, you're gonna kill me!
What are you doin'?

164
00:14:04,138 --> 00:14:06,842
All right! You busted
a big shipment of their coke.

165
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:09,768
Now I wanna know,
are they movin' some more stuff in?

166
00:14:09,851 --> 00:14:13,350
- They're movin' a lot more in, aren't they?
- What?

167
00:14:13,438 --> 00:14:16,724
Huh? Come on,
give it to me straight, Freddie.

168
00:14:16,816 --> 00:14:20,020
- Come on. I want it straight.
- All right. All right.

169
00:14:21,112 --> 00:14:24,197
We had a meeting at a warehouse.

170
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:28,361
Fifth and Presidio.
Transworld shipping, something like that.

171
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:31,369
Better be right, buddy,
because I'm gonna tell you,

172
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:34,705
I don't wanna waste
my afternoon searchin'.

173
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:37,283
- You'll waste a lifetime searching it.
- Yeah?

174
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:41,460
It's huge. You could hide
the Goodyear Blimp in there.

175
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,252
- Better have a hell of a nose.
- Yeah, yeah, right.

176
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:47,592
- I guess I'll have to.
- Hey, what am I supposed to do?

177
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,967
Drive slow, don't pass.

178
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,266
San Diego Police Department.

179
00:14:57,356 --> 00:15:00,061
Put your weapons down,
put your hands behind your head,

180
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:03,483
and come out of the building
through the front door.

181
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,609
This is Sergeant Young
of the San Diego Police Department.

182
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,786
... weapons down,
hands behind your head,

183
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:20,078
and come out of the building
through the front door.

184
00:15:27,758 --> 00:15:31,376
- What's the deal?
- We busted a buy down the block.

185
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,472
They took off, we grabbed one of 'em,
the other two - in there.

186
00:15:34,557 --> 00:15:36,550
- Brannigan up there?
- Yeah.

187
00:15:42,689 --> 00:15:45,014
Hey, Brannigan. Brannigan!

188
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,445
- Brannigan. Come here. I need a favour.
- I'm busy, Dooley.

189
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:53,402
- I need one of your land sharks here.
- Hey, they got a gig.

190
00:15:53,491 --> 00:15:56,778
Hey, I only need it for a couple of hours.
Come on, gimme the dog.

191
00:15:56,871 --> 00:15:59,823
- I can't spare a handler.
- No handler? I'll do it myself.

192
00:15:59,913 --> 00:16:03,497
- These dogs won't listen to you.
- That's just because they don't know me.

193
00:16:03,584 --> 00:16:07,628
They don't have to know you. You're
a maniac. They don't trust maniacs.

194
00:16:07,713 --> 00:16:10,085
- Forget it.
- I got this sweet bust goin' down.

195
00:16:10,173 --> 00:16:12,380
But I need to jump on it right now.
I need the dog.

196
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:16,050
You think you have problems?
I gotta take my wife and kids on vacation.

197
00:16:16,138 --> 00:16:19,091
- I got a plane to catch in three hours.
- Plane?

198
00:16:19,181 --> 00:16:21,886
Yeah. But I won't catch it
cos I gotta wait for the SWAT.

199
00:16:21,976 --> 00:16:25,060
- If I get you on the plane, I get the dog?
- My wife's gonna...

200
00:16:25,146 --> 00:16:28,349
Can I have the dog if I get you
on the plane? You're airborne.

201
00:16:28,442 --> 00:16:31,857
- I'll get you on. Get me the dog.
- If you do, you can marry the damn dog.

202
00:16:31,944 --> 00:16:34,352
- You got it.
- Goddamn lunatic.

203
00:16:34,447 --> 00:16:37,150
Who's this guy? Who've we got here?

204
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,482
Ow!

205
00:16:39,576 --> 00:16:42,196
Nice hairnet. steaI that from your mom?

206
00:16:42,287 --> 00:16:46,035
- Pinche, cabron.
- Now, now, now. Be nice.

207
00:16:46,124 --> 00:16:49,410
Gold card! Haven't we had a good year!

208
00:17:11,105 --> 00:17:13,727
- Hey, we're closed.
- I don't care. I need a car.

209
00:17:13,815 --> 00:17:17,020
Fine. Take the convertible. $79.95 a day.

210
00:17:17,111 --> 00:17:20,361
- The sign says $19.95.
- Sorry. We're all out of those.

211
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:22,525
- You got 20 of 'em out there!
- Reserved.

212
00:17:22,617 --> 00:17:24,943
- For who?
- Not you.

213
00:17:25,036 --> 00:17:28,121
- All right. Gimme the next cheapest one.
- $79.95.

214
00:17:28,206 --> 00:17:31,160
- OK, fine. Come on.
- Doesn't include tax and mileage.

215
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:35,958
That's all right. Put them on the bill.
I don't care. And I want some insurance.

216
00:17:36,046 --> 00:17:38,502
- Insurance?
- Oh, yeah, I want the whole ball.

217
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:43,382
I want collision, liability, medical, flood,
fire, theft. You got earthquake insurance?

218
00:17:43,471 --> 00:17:46,673
- Whole life.
- Whole life is fine. Put that on there.

219
00:17:48,184 --> 00:17:51,100
- OK. What's that come to?
- $267.90.

220
00:17:51,187 --> 00:17:54,518
Round it to $300. Put it on the gold card.

221
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:56,148
Yes, sir!

222
00:17:59,693 --> 00:18:02,445
- Hey, this is a beautiful car.
- Yes, sir. Top of the line.

223
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:04,522
I'm a top-of-the-line kinda guy!

224
00:18:04,615 --> 00:18:07,782
I'll put you on our preferred-customer list.
Yes, definitely!

225
00:18:07,868 --> 00:18:10,785
- Great!
- I think you're a Golden Key man.

226
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,697
- Love it.
- Absolutely.

227
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:15,576
So you can rent one
of these suckers anywhere by phone!

228
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:18,158
And they come with
discount tickets to SeaWorld!

229
00:18:18,253 --> 00:18:22,416
- Thanks.
- A pleasure doing business! Need a map?

230
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,262
Hit the floor! Now!

231
00:18:39,397 --> 00:18:41,853
What do you think this is?
Look what you did!

232
00:18:47,698 --> 00:18:49,773
Narcotics? Party of 12.

233
00:18:55,078 --> 00:18:58,033
Sure you wanna do this?
Do you know what you're gettin' into?

234
00:18:58,124 --> 00:19:01,456
I watched you work for years.
You don't have to be a Harvard graduate.

235
00:19:01,544 --> 00:19:04,876
- They're just dogs.
- Right.

236
00:19:04,964 --> 00:19:08,247
- Where the hell is this dog? Mexico?
- They wouldn't take him.

237
00:19:08,341 --> 00:19:10,464
- What's wrong with him?
- Nothing.

238
00:19:10,551 --> 00:19:13,304
- Come on, Brannigan.
- He's got a few personality quirks.

239
00:19:13,387 --> 00:19:15,760
- You should relate to that.
- Wait a minute.

240
00:19:15,848 --> 00:19:18,932
- He's not a retard, is he?
- This dog's seen more action

241
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:21,224
than me and you put together.

242
00:19:21,313 --> 00:19:23,351
In fact, he's a little stressed out.

243
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,808
- What do you mean by that?
- Just that he's peculiar from time to time.

244
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:27,932
Peculiar?

245
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:32,194
- How come he's back here?
- He's not reaI sociable.

246
00:19:32,655 --> 00:19:35,111
- Put this on.
- What's with the stuff?

247
00:19:35,199 --> 00:19:38,404
- It ain't a fashion statement.
- Hey, I don't need this stuff.

248
00:19:38,495 --> 00:19:40,821
It's procedure.
Everybody wears it. Put it on.

249
00:19:40,914 --> 00:19:42,872
You know, this is a waste of time.

250
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:46,825
Just let the dog sniff me, I'll give him
some yummies, and we're outta here.

251
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,956
Put it on. Tell me,
do you know anything about animals?

252
00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:52,585
- What's there to know?
- Did you have a pet?

253
00:19:52,675 --> 00:19:54,584
- Yeah, plenty of pets.
- What kind?

254
00:19:54,677 --> 00:19:56,053
- Plenty.
- Like what?

255
00:19:56,137 --> 00:19:58,094
- You know. Pets.
- Like what?

256
00:19:58,181 --> 00:20:01,135
- Fish. I had fish.
- Aw, come on. Fish? Come on. Let's go.

257
00:20:01,225 --> 00:20:03,217
It's a pet. It's a companion.

258
00:20:04,144 --> 00:20:07,477
- The most loyal animal I ever knew.
- Hey. You ready?

259
00:20:07,564 --> 00:20:10,518
- Siamese fighting fish.
- All right. Let's go.

260
00:20:11,651 --> 00:20:15,863
- I feeI like the Michelin Man.
- I don't know. It's kinda... you.

261
00:20:16,323 --> 00:20:18,315
Get over here.

262
00:20:19,743 --> 00:20:21,451
- "Jerry Lee"?
- The killer.

263
00:20:21,536 --> 00:20:24,986
Wait a minute. What is this?
You think I'm gonna fence the dog?

264
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,781
Tell me, Brannigan. How come,
if everyone has to wear one of these suits,

265
00:20:28,876 --> 00:20:30,869
you're not wearing one?

266
00:20:31,796 --> 00:20:33,788
Cos I ain't goin' in there.

267
00:20:43,348 --> 00:20:45,720
- Where the hell is he?
- He's in there.

268
00:20:45,807 --> 00:20:48,345
- I'm gettin' a full-sized dog, aren't I?
- Oh, yeah.

269
00:20:48,436 --> 00:20:50,429
Jerry Lee, you got company.
Up and at 'em.

270
00:20:52,523 --> 00:20:57,186
Jerry Lee, you got a visitor. Come on.
Up and at 'em, Jerry Lee. Come on.

271
00:21:07,663 --> 00:21:09,701
Are you sure this dog
can track down drugs?

272
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:12,114
- Yeah.
- I don't know, Brannigan.

273
00:21:12,209 --> 00:21:14,615
- Looks like he's on 'em.
- Just give him a command.

274
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,960
- He'll jump to it.
- Ah, come on.

275
00:21:18,048 --> 00:21:19,125
Sure.

276
00:21:20,131 --> 00:21:22,254
Hey, pup. Kill!

277
00:21:25,471 --> 00:21:28,471
- "Here, boy" might have worked better.
- I'm hip!

278
00:21:28,556 --> 00:21:31,676
- He's always cranky when he wakes up.
- I know!

279
00:21:32,394 --> 00:21:35,063
- What do we do now?
- Breakfast.

280
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:39,347
Yeah, breakfast. Great idea.

281
00:21:39,608 --> 00:21:41,897
Yeah, there he is. Best nose on the force.

282
00:21:41,986 --> 00:21:46,398
He could stick that snout in the wind now
and lead you to a stash in Tijuana.

283
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:50,784
- I gotta be upfront. I got a bad feelin'.
- Hey, tough shit. That's all I got.

284
00:21:50,869 --> 00:21:53,076
No, you got a lot of dogs.
I want one of those.

285
00:21:53,163 --> 00:21:55,833
Do things outside the rules,
you take what you can get.

286
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:58,917
- Now, take reaI good care of him.
- Don't worry about your dog.

287
00:21:59,003 --> 00:22:01,838
- It ain't him I'm worried about.
- Is he eatin' chilli?

288
00:22:01,922 --> 00:22:05,125
- What kinda animal eats chilli?
- Hey, different strokes!

289
00:22:05,342 --> 00:22:07,667
- Do I have to wear this suit all day?
- Yeah.

290
00:22:07,761 --> 00:22:12,008
- Come on. I can't drive in this thing.
- Just hang it up on your way out.

291
00:22:14,143 --> 00:22:16,265
Come on, Jerry Lee.

292
00:22:16,352 --> 00:22:18,345
Come on! Come on!

293
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:25,816
- Hey, Dooley. Good luck.
- Thanks.

294
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,503
All right, come on.

295
00:22:48,592 --> 00:22:51,758
Let's go. In the car. Hup! Come on.

296
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,096
All right. Get in the back.

297
00:23:05,732 --> 00:23:07,939
Jump in the back seat. Now.

298
00:23:08,651 --> 00:23:10,644
Move.

299
00:23:12,988 --> 00:23:14,981
Don't test me, because I'm gonna win.

300
00:23:17,076 --> 00:23:19,068
All right.

301
00:23:22,456 --> 00:23:24,995
It's OK. Fine. OK.

302
00:23:45,895 --> 00:23:48,386
You better do exactly what I tell you to do.

303
00:23:48,481 --> 00:23:50,686
Otherwise I'm gonna kick your butt.

304
00:23:54,361 --> 00:23:57,315
Brannigan's doing
a number on me. I can smell it.

305
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:19,208
All right. Listen up, here!

306
00:24:19,302 --> 00:24:22,137
San Diego PD, Narcotics division.

307
00:24:22,221 --> 00:24:24,926
I want everyone
to stay right where you are.

308
00:24:25,016 --> 00:24:28,715
Listen! Hold it right...
stop! You, stop. Right here.

309
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:33,139
San Diego Police Department, Narcotics.
Lift me up. I wanna talk to these people.

310
00:24:33,232 --> 00:24:35,556
Come on!

311
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:41,565
San Diego PD, Narcotics division.

312
00:24:42,658 --> 00:24:46,700
Now, there are drugs in this warehouse.
I know it, and you know it.

313
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,113
This dog's gonna find them,

314
00:24:50,623 --> 00:24:54,916
unless you cheeseballs wanna save me
some time and tell me where it is.

315
00:24:57,003 --> 00:25:00,123
No? All right. Suit yourself.

316
00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:03,172
Bring me down.

317
00:25:10,099 --> 00:25:13,100
All right. I want you all to pay attention.

318
00:25:13,436 --> 00:25:16,970
This is a highly trained,
vicious K-9 police dog.

319
00:25:17,064 --> 00:25:20,978
So don't get in his way. This dog is
programmed to viciously attack

320
00:25:21,068 --> 00:25:25,147
anyone who may pose a threat
or an obstacle to this detail.

321
00:25:26,489 --> 00:25:28,482
Jerry Lee, come.

322
00:25:29,951 --> 00:25:31,944
Jerry Lee. Come!

323
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:50,002
All right. Go.

324
00:25:52,096 --> 00:25:54,053
Search.

325
00:25:54,141 --> 00:25:56,466
Sniff! Sniff.

326
00:26:09,238 --> 00:26:11,860
Just find the damn dope.

327
00:26:13,492 --> 00:26:16,065
"Find the damn dope"?
That's the command?

328
00:26:16,161 --> 00:26:18,036
Just stay there!

329
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,945
Detective Dooley!

330
00:27:03,498 --> 00:27:05,870
- Lyman.
- Who's the bitch?

331
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:09,292
Watch your profanity around my dog.

332
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:15,419
Is that the way you talk to those
high-society friends of yours, Lyman?

333
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,501
Hey, nice ride you got there.

334
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,593
Black is hard to keep clean.

335
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:24,387
I didn't expect to see you today.

336
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,469
But you know what? It works out great.

337
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:30,725
Know why? Now I don't have to drive all
the way across town to hauI your ass in.

338
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:32,892
- Hey, is that a CD player?
- Dooley.

339
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,474
What is it about me
that gets you so passionate?

340
00:27:35,569 --> 00:27:37,609
Not your looks. I think it's your job.

341
00:27:37,696 --> 00:27:40,270
Knowing your frontier approach
to law enforcement,

342
00:27:40,366 --> 00:27:43,071
I don't assume
that you have a search warrant.

343
00:27:43,576 --> 00:27:45,570
The dog ate it.

344
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:51,156
- Hang round his tail and wait for an hour.
- Get outta here, before I call a real cop.

345
00:27:54,128 --> 00:27:56,536
Why don't you call your lawyer, Lyman?

346
00:28:00,176 --> 00:28:02,335
There are drugs in this warehouse.

347
00:28:03,804 --> 00:28:08,715
He went right for this door. That'll give me
a warrant that'll hold up in any court.

348
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:13,471
Agh! Ay, me va a morder tu perro.
Quitame el pinche perro.

349
00:28:14,188 --> 00:28:16,644
It was just one joint, man!

350
00:28:16,732 --> 00:28:19,900
- Just one joint.
- One joint?

351
00:28:19,986 --> 00:28:23,604
Are you gonna haul this drug lord in
or do we just execute him on the spot?

352
00:28:23,698 --> 00:28:26,402
- This thing isn't over.
- I'm afraid it is.

353
00:28:26,492 --> 00:28:30,620
I'll get a restraining order and you won't
be able to come within five miles of me.

354
00:28:30,705 --> 00:28:33,243
You get whatever you want.
It's not gonna stop me.

355
00:28:33,331 --> 00:28:35,371
Jerry Lee, come.

356
00:28:38,295 --> 00:28:40,621
Jerry Lee!

357
00:28:40,714 --> 00:28:43,169
Come on!

358
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,882
Buenos nachos.

359
00:28:48,305 --> 00:28:51,388
One joint! You found one lousy joint!

360
00:28:51,473 --> 00:28:55,423
You're small-time, you know that? I need
a real dog, is what I need. Benji!

361
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:59,732
I'm taking... I got one more stop,
and then I'm taking you back. One joint!

362
00:29:10,326 --> 00:29:12,318
Police dog.

363
00:29:12,411 --> 00:29:15,495
You just stay put.
This is a job for a real cop.

364
00:29:38,353 --> 00:29:40,345
Yeah? What for ya?

365
00:29:41,064 --> 00:29:43,056
Me?

366
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:48,395
Health inspector.
Looks pretty good. I like it.

367
00:29:48,904 --> 00:29:51,310
Yep. Looks pretty good.

368
00:29:52,531 --> 00:29:54,857
Well, I guess it's that time of day, huh?

369
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:59,328
Feels like happy hour to me. Know what?
I'm gonna buy all the boys a drink here.

370
00:29:59,413 --> 00:30:02,035
- Uh-huh.
- And give me, uh...

371
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:04,580
whatever you got that's,
uh, you know, diet.

372
00:30:04,668 --> 00:30:07,420
- Shooters?
- Shooters for the boys?

373
00:30:08,422 --> 00:30:10,663
Give 'em some shooters!

374
00:30:10,757 --> 00:30:13,711
Afternoon shooters, boy, I like those.

375
00:30:13,803 --> 00:30:18,049
Ah, you got that, uh, pickled pigs' feet.
That looks pretty good.

376
00:30:20,643 --> 00:30:23,478
So how you guys doin' today?
Have a good day?

377
00:30:23,895 --> 00:30:25,602
Lookin' good.

378
00:30:29,024 --> 00:30:32,394
Thank you. Hey! Cheers, huh?

379
00:30:36,198 --> 00:30:42,616
Mm! I'll tell ya, on a hot day,
there's nothing like a... warm diet pop.

380
00:30:44,121 --> 00:30:46,114
Give 'em another round here!

381
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:49,664
Ah!

382
00:30:50,086 --> 00:30:52,493
You know, maybe you guys
can help me out here.

383
00:30:54,423 --> 00:30:57,792
I'm lookin' for a buddy I used to play
chequers with. We were tight.

384
00:30:57,885 --> 00:31:01,419
We used to come in here, a long time ago,
before you guys were here.

385
00:31:01,514 --> 00:31:04,300
I miss that crazy
son of a bitch, you know?

386
00:31:04,391 --> 00:31:07,641
I was thinkin' about him the other day.
Oh, what was his name?

387
00:31:07,726 --> 00:31:10,764
He had a funny nickname,
kinda like, uh...

388
00:31:10,854 --> 00:31:13,345
Like Kermit the Frog, but not. You know?

389
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,977
It was like... Benny... Benny the Mule.

390
00:31:17,071 --> 00:31:20,025
- Why do you wanna know about him?
- Cos he's a cop.

391
00:31:21,532 --> 00:31:24,901
I usually don't get a second shot
at somebody like you.

392
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,245
Agh!

393
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:30,912
You know, you made a big mistake.
This ain't a good place to be a cop.

394
00:31:31,001 --> 00:31:33,955
If I caught you at a bad time,
I can always come back later.

395
00:31:35,297 --> 00:31:37,788
Yeah, you know, Dooley,
I could shoot you.

396
00:31:37,881 --> 00:31:41,664
That'd be too easy on you
and it wouldn't be any fun for me.

397
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:44,512
No, I think I'll just
beat the shit outta you!

398
00:31:47,641 --> 00:31:49,799
What the hell is that?

399
00:31:49,892 --> 00:31:52,099
That's... Officer Lewis.

400
00:31:53,104 --> 00:31:55,678
San Diego K-9. You're all under arrest.

401
00:31:56,733 --> 00:32:00,314
So line up against the wall,
hands above your head, and spread 'em.

402
00:32:00,402 --> 00:32:02,608
Hey, we give up.

403
00:32:03,113 --> 00:32:06,446
I'm not kiddin'. Hey, listen, I'm tellin' ya.

404
00:32:06,533 --> 00:32:09,071
One command outta me,
he'll rip your throats out.

405
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:13,241
- Line up against that wall!
- I'm scared shitless. Aren't you, guys?

406
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,459
Get outta here!

407
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:20,995
You're a hard guy, huh?

408
00:33:28,486 --> 00:33:30,443
Could you call off your dog?

409
00:33:30,528 --> 00:33:34,311
- I'm sorry. What?
- Could you call off your dog?

410
00:33:36,325 --> 00:33:39,493
Hm. Well, I don't know, Benny.
That depends on you.

411
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:42,415
Listen, that hit was nothin' personaI.
It was just a job.

412
00:33:42,499 --> 00:33:46,450
- Who contracted the hit, Benny?
- I don't know. I nev... I never saw the guy.

413
00:33:46,545 --> 00:33:49,214
No? Come on,
don't get cute with me, Benny.

414
00:33:49,297 --> 00:33:52,168
- This dog hasn't eaten since yesterday.
- It's the truth.

415
00:33:52,257 --> 00:33:54,499
I don't know any names.
He never gave me any.

416
00:33:54,593 --> 00:33:58,721
Did he mention anything about, like,
a shipment of drugs comin' in?

417
00:33:58,806 --> 00:34:01,925
- He say anything about that?
- I don't know nothin'.

418
00:34:03,268 --> 00:34:06,056
- Bite his dick off.
- No! No! Wait! No! Whoa!

419
00:34:06,146 --> 00:34:08,816
I know, OK? There is a shipment. I forgot.

420
00:34:09,984 --> 00:34:14,276
But it ain't goin' near the streets. It's all
goin' to one buyer. I don't know who it is.

421
00:34:14,362 --> 00:34:16,651
- Lunchtime!
- No, I know! All right, I know!

422
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:19,491
I know who it is. I know who it is.

423
00:34:19,575 --> 00:34:21,449
It's... it's a dude named Gilliam.

424
00:34:21,536 --> 00:34:24,406
Big-timer. He's comin' in tomorrow.
HoteI del Coronado.

425
00:34:24,497 --> 00:34:27,451
He's lookin' to score large. That's it.

426
00:34:27,542 --> 00:34:30,624
- You sure?
- I boost a couple of cars now and then.

427
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:34,126
And before I became a shooter,
I was in a couple of gay biker snuff films.

428
00:34:34,214 --> 00:34:37,797
- What do you want from me?!
- You should be disgusted with yourself.

429
00:34:37,883 --> 00:34:39,877
OK, Jerry. Come!

430
00:34:45,267 --> 00:34:47,425
Arrest this guy for attempted murder,

431
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:50,472
and the rest of them
for cruelty to animals.

432
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:06,693
You did all right. It was OK.

433
00:35:07,911 --> 00:35:09,905
That wasn't too bad.

434
00:35:10,665 --> 00:35:13,619
But I want you to know that
I am the officer in charge here.

435
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:16,082
MichaeI Dooley, not Jerry Lee.

436
00:35:16,169 --> 00:35:20,298
Don't you ever,
ever pull anything like that again

437
00:35:20,383 --> 00:35:23,004
without talkin' to me first!

438
00:35:23,094 --> 00:35:25,668
You lost it in there. You lost control!

439
00:35:25,763 --> 00:35:28,965
We coulda gotten killed!
I needed you back here.

440
00:35:29,057 --> 00:35:31,808
What if they ran out?
You coulda got 'em here.

441
00:35:32,895 --> 00:35:34,886
You understand?

442
00:35:43,779 --> 00:35:45,772
Get in the back seat!

443
00:35:56,709 --> 00:36:00,160
You stink.
This car stinks, do you know that?

444
00:36:02,006 --> 00:36:06,833
If we're gonna spend time together,
I've gotta deodorise your mangy little ass.

445
00:36:06,927 --> 00:36:09,299
Tracy's gonna kick you and me both out.

446
00:36:10,304 --> 00:36:13,175
She's kind of a neat person.
You'll like her.

447
00:36:16,311 --> 00:36:20,724
OK. It's time you joined
the civilised world, buddy.

448
00:36:20,815 --> 00:36:24,563
Now, what we have here is dry shampoo.
We can do it right here on the spot.

449
00:36:24,652 --> 00:36:26,728
We got some doggy deodorant here.

450
00:36:26,819 --> 00:36:33,736
"Your dog will smell like cedar chips
all day long, just like the champions. "

451
00:36:33,827 --> 00:36:36,863
Come on, get out of the car. We'll do it.

452
00:36:36,955 --> 00:36:39,872
Come on. I'm doin' you a favour.
You smell like shit.

453
00:36:39,958 --> 00:36:42,662
You lack personal hygiene.
You understand that?

454
00:36:42,751 --> 00:36:46,168
Here. Come on,
this is uptown stuff. Smell this.

455
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:49,128
Now, listen.

456
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,633
Hey! Gimme that!

457
00:36:57,350 --> 00:37:02,390
All right. If that's the way you want it,
that's the way you're gonna have it.

458
00:37:47,938 --> 00:37:49,931
You look good.

459
00:37:54,152 --> 00:37:57,935
Dry him off reaI good, boys.
Buff up that beak! Yeah.

460
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:00,362
Hey, extra dollar for a hot wax, right?

461
00:38:00,741 --> 00:38:03,363
Armor-All him for me!

462
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:07,362
You smell good, but not like cedar chips.

463
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:13,454
Well, that concludes today's lesson
on "Don't screw with MichaeI Dooley. "

464
00:38:13,546 --> 00:38:16,380
Class is dismissed.

465
00:38:39,738 --> 00:38:41,813
That's all right. That was worth it.

466
00:38:59,173 --> 00:39:05,009
So, you wanna tell me why I was talking
to a dead man this afternoon?

467
00:39:05,803 --> 00:39:08,377
We had no way of knowing
that guy wasn't in the car.

468
00:39:08,473 --> 00:39:10,928
Yeah. That's because
you were in a helicopter.

469
00:39:11,018 --> 00:39:13,507
What kind of bullshit is that?

470
00:39:13,602 --> 00:39:18,763
Choppers, machine guns.
Who do you guys think you are? Marines?

471
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:23,977
And you.

472
00:39:24,071 --> 00:39:26,644
Why didn't you come to me?

473
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,982
Haven't I always taken care of you?

474
00:39:29,785 --> 00:39:32,784
And you pay me back
by sending the law to my warehouse.

475
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,863
I didn't tell him nothin'!

476
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:38,583
I don't know how he found out about that.

477
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:41,834
Come on. I'd never roll on you guys.

478
00:39:43,088 --> 00:39:45,295
I'm worried.

479
00:39:45,382 --> 00:39:47,375
This guy Dooley's crazy.

480
00:39:49,761 --> 00:39:52,050
Yeah. Crazy.

481
00:39:53,723 --> 00:39:57,768
Well, I'll tell you something, Freddie.

482
00:39:57,852 --> 00:40:02,181
You wouldn't be in this position
if these pissants had done their job.

483
00:40:03,774 --> 00:40:05,850
You wanna know how to kill a man?

484
00:40:06,694 --> 00:40:09,100
Well, I'll tell you how to kill a man.

485
00:40:09,195 --> 00:40:12,896
You forget this hi-tech stuff.
You get a gun.

486
00:40:14,325 --> 00:40:16,319
And then you find the man,

487
00:40:17,621 --> 00:40:19,614
and you grab him.

488
00:40:20,289 --> 00:40:23,290
And you put the gun to his head,

489
00:40:23,377 --> 00:40:27,042
and you send his brains into outer space.

490
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:35,002
Not bad, huh?

491
00:40:35,095 --> 00:40:37,504
Yeah. It's my nephew's.

492
00:40:38,474 --> 00:40:40,467
It's a toy.

493
00:40:46,606 --> 00:40:48,399
This one's real.

494
00:40:54,073 --> 00:40:59,279
Now, this Dooley's
already into me for one shipment.

495
00:41:01,288 --> 00:41:03,992
I don't want him to get
the next one. You understand?

496
00:41:04,082 --> 00:41:06,288
- He's dead.
- "He's dead, he's dead. "

497
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:08,830
Don't tell me he's dead!

498
00:41:08,919 --> 00:41:10,912
I want it done right this time.

499
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,671
I want it finished with this...

500
00:41:16,468 --> 00:41:18,461
cop.

501
00:41:20,806 --> 00:41:22,799
Clean this up.

502
00:41:42,868 --> 00:41:44,860
Trace?

503
00:41:46,162 --> 00:41:48,202
Honey?

504
00:41:48,289 --> 00:41:50,282
Tracy?

505
00:41:51,292 --> 00:41:53,368
I'm late. I'm late. I know I'm late.

506
00:41:53,462 --> 00:41:56,794
I know I'm late. We missed
the ballet tonight, didn't we? Damn!

507
00:41:56,882 --> 00:42:00,132
And you know how
I love the ballet. Love it!

508
00:42:00,218 --> 00:42:02,625
I... Oh, you got the flowers.

509
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,009
I... I didn't know that.

510
00:42:05,096 --> 00:42:07,765
Yeah, you owe me $45. They came COD.

511
00:42:10,226 --> 00:42:13,013
Did you know you have an animal
growing out of your pants?

512
00:42:13,105 --> 00:42:16,225
Thank you, honey. I also have a dog here.

513
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:20,982
- Why is it among us?
- Oh, that's the reason I'm late.

514
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:24,486
I was racing home, trying
to get here to pick you up for the ballet,

515
00:42:24,573 --> 00:42:26,862
and I passed this window,
and there he was.

516
00:42:26,951 --> 00:42:30,485
Just sitting there,
looking a little lonely, a little helpless.

517
00:42:30,579 --> 00:42:33,070
I had to pick him up, honey. You like him?

518
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:36,156
- He's very sweet.
- He is, isn't he?

519
00:42:36,627 --> 00:42:38,537
- Does he have a name?
- Uh-uh.

520
00:42:40,129 --> 00:42:42,253
I think we should think of one together.

521
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:44,628
- How about...
- Jerry! Jerry's a good name.

522
00:42:44,718 --> 00:42:47,801
- Yeah. Jerry. That's great.
- Does he do any tricks?

523
00:42:47,887 --> 00:42:50,804
No, I haven't had
too much time to work with him.

524
00:42:51,724 --> 00:42:53,681
Can you speak?

525
00:42:53,768 --> 00:42:55,760
Good boy! Can you kiss?

526
00:42:55,853 --> 00:42:57,810
Ooh!

527
00:42:57,897 --> 00:43:00,222
Oh, you're a good puppy dog, huh?

528
00:43:00,316 --> 00:43:03,187
- You're a sweetheart!
- Ass-kisser.

529
00:43:03,277 --> 00:43:05,270
Oh, sure, I taught him those tricks.

530
00:43:05,363 --> 00:43:08,981
Those are nothin', the easy ones.
I've been workin' on tougher things.

531
00:43:09,075 --> 00:43:11,067
You know, like card tricks.

532
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:15,324
Tracy, I'm really sorry about the ballet.
I promise I'll take you later in the season,

533
00:43:15,414 --> 00:43:17,572
like, during the play-offs.

534
00:43:26,091 --> 00:43:28,760
- He's very protective.
- Mm-hm.

535
00:43:30,971 --> 00:43:32,346
Agh!

536
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:34,719
Come here! Come on in the kitchen!

537
00:43:35,975 --> 00:43:37,967
Come on in the kitchen!

538
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,636
Come on in the kitchen.

539
00:43:40,729 --> 00:43:44,347
- Come on, Jerry. Come on.
- OK. Go with Dooley.

540
00:43:44,441 --> 00:43:47,145
Yeah! Yeah!

541
00:43:47,236 --> 00:43:49,441
Let's get somethin' to eat! Yeah!

542
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:51,936
Ooh, yeah!

543
00:43:52,281 --> 00:43:55,484
Look. Let's get one thing straight:
the woman is mine!

544
00:43:55,575 --> 00:43:59,027
We're both members of the animaI
kingdom. You know that, I know that.

545
00:43:59,121 --> 00:44:02,158
And we both know
that this thing is really primal.

546
00:44:02,249 --> 00:44:04,823
If you think you're such a badass,
try that once more

547
00:44:04,919 --> 00:44:07,789
and you're gonna end up
in a pet cemetery.

548
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,168
You remember the movie
Old Yeller? Do you?

549
00:44:10,257 --> 00:44:12,415
Remember when
they shot him at the end?

550
00:44:12,509 --> 00:44:15,959
I didn't cry! Now come on!

551
00:44:16,637 --> 00:44:18,962
Honey, I think he needs to go outside.

552
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:23,766
Nice night. Enjoy the view.

553
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:38,314
- Do you think he's in pain?
- Not yet.

554
00:44:38,408 --> 00:44:41,161
Honey, why... why would he be in pain?

555
00:44:41,244 --> 00:44:44,827
Shut that damn dog up!
some of us are tryin' to sleep!

556
00:44:46,499 --> 00:44:49,073
I'll handle it.

557
00:44:58,177 --> 00:45:00,750
Come on, Jerry. You hungry?

558
00:45:00,846 --> 00:45:02,838
A little late-night snack?

559
00:45:03,473 --> 00:45:06,759
You know, we're a couple
of smart guys, you know that?

560
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:11,219
I like that in a dog. She likes that in a dog.

561
00:45:11,314 --> 00:45:13,472
And she likes you.

562
00:45:13,566 --> 00:45:15,558
But she loves me!

563
00:45:16,485 --> 00:45:19,440
I just need a couple of hours.
You understand?

564
00:45:19,531 --> 00:45:21,856
Here. You hungry?

565
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:23,942
T- bone. 16-ounce.

566
00:45:24,036 --> 00:45:26,443
Mm. Good.

567
00:45:26,537 --> 00:45:28,778
It'll thaw out in a few hours. Have a ball.

568
00:45:37,213 --> 00:45:39,207
I'm back. All right.

569
00:45:39,924 --> 00:45:41,632
Mm.

570
00:45:43,345 --> 00:45:45,385
- Give me that.
- Dooley!

571
00:45:46,015 --> 00:45:49,098
- Mm.
- He sucked that thing frozen!

572
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:51,591
- What?
- Nothin'. Nothin'.

573
00:45:59,985 --> 00:46:02,442
You're trying to piss me off, aren't you?

574
00:46:02,529 --> 00:46:05,200
You're pissing me off!

575
00:46:05,617 --> 00:46:08,022
Come on! Come on!

576
00:46:09,118 --> 00:46:11,692
Come on! Behind you!

577
00:46:17,627 --> 00:46:19,619
Come on! Come here. Ow! Ow!

578
00:46:20,088 --> 00:46:22,543
- My eye! My eye!
- Dooley!

579
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:25,922
- Hi, honey.
- What's going on?

580
00:46:26,009 --> 00:46:29,674
I think he was just a little bit lonely.
He wanted to play.

581
00:46:30,305 --> 00:46:32,630
- We should bring him into the bedroom.
- No!

582
00:46:32,724 --> 00:46:34,883
- I don't think so.
- Come on. What a good boy!

583
00:46:34,976 --> 00:46:38,227
- Oh, he loves it out here! He really does!
- Come on.

584
00:46:39,815 --> 00:46:44,476
You're a sweetheart.
Just a little sweetheart.

585
00:46:48,114 --> 00:46:50,402
Come on, Dooley.

586
00:46:58,457 --> 00:47:00,829
Oh!

587
00:47:05,504 --> 00:47:07,497
Mm. Ouch. Ooh.

588
00:47:08,675 --> 00:47:11,676
Ow, you bit me. Ow.

589
00:47:12,052 --> 00:47:14,758
- Stop that. You can't bite me.
- You love it.

590
00:47:21,354 --> 00:47:24,307
I can't. I can't do it.

591
00:47:25,273 --> 00:47:28,440
- Why?
- He's watchin' me. I can feel his eyes.

592
00:47:30,654 --> 00:47:33,607
Look at him.
He's sitting there evaluating me.

593
00:47:34,491 --> 00:47:36,732
He's not the one you have to impress.

594
00:48:13,111 --> 00:48:13,941
Jesus!

595
00:48:14,904 --> 00:48:18,569
- Want some eggs?
- No, I'll catch a doughnut downtown.

596
00:48:18,657 --> 00:48:20,651
I gotta get goin'. Bye.

597
00:48:20,743 --> 00:48:24,076
- Thank you for a hell of a night.
- My pleasure. I mean that!

598
00:48:24,163 --> 00:48:27,995
Oh... I mean it too. Good morning!

599
00:48:28,083 --> 00:48:31,784
What's the matter? Can't take it? Huh?

600
00:48:31,879 --> 00:48:35,544
Kinda grinds you down in the battle
of wits, you're fighting unarmed?

601
00:48:35,632 --> 00:48:37,873
Well, you're just a bad loser, that's all.

602
00:48:37,967 --> 00:48:42,629
You gotta learn one thing: winning
isn't everything, but losing is nothing.

603
00:48:44,307 --> 00:48:47,177
- Dooley...
- Huh? Yeah?

604
00:48:50,563 --> 00:48:52,556
Yes, ma'am.

605
00:48:56,193 --> 00:48:58,481
- Aw, shit.
- Exactly.

606
00:49:02,324 --> 00:49:05,029
I can't believe
all that came out of one animal.

607
00:49:39,066 --> 00:49:41,521
Hey, notice anything different?

608
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:45,447
Huh? sure you do.

609
00:49:45,531 --> 00:49:50,276
I used to say "Get in the car", "Get outta
the car", "Get in the back seat", "stay".

610
00:49:50,369 --> 00:49:52,361
Commands are out. This is in.

611
00:49:53,162 --> 00:49:57,208
There you go. You don't wanna listen,
I don't wanna talk.

612
00:49:57,961 --> 00:49:59,952
All right? see you later, bub.

613
00:50:08,011 --> 00:50:10,633
- Your champagne, sir.
- What is this?

614
00:50:10,722 --> 00:50:13,925
- I didn't order any champagne.
- I know that, sir. It's a gift.

615
00:50:14,016 --> 00:50:16,175
Take it back.
It must belong to somebody else.

616
00:50:16,269 --> 00:50:18,842
- They said Mr Gilliam.
- I said get it out of here.

617
00:50:18,938 --> 00:50:20,931
I don't want the champagne.

618
00:50:27,446 --> 00:50:29,439
Lunch today?

619
00:50:29,532 --> 00:50:31,856
- Is it expensive?
- Yes.

620
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:35,153
- How about a tall iced tea?
- There's a minimum.

621
00:50:35,244 --> 00:50:37,201
- Why don't you just bring me the...
- OK.

622
00:50:37,289 --> 00:50:39,281
.. menu?

623
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:44,418
Good boy!

624
00:50:44,503 --> 00:50:46,746
What a good dog you are.

625
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,830
Sit!

626
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:51,210
Speak!

627
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:52,926
Sit up.

628
00:50:54,805 --> 00:50:57,260
Go put your ball away.

629
00:51:01,686 --> 00:51:03,680
Gimme some lovin'!

630
00:51:04,231 --> 00:51:07,018
That's... that's... that's great.

631
00:51:07,108 --> 00:51:09,397
That's really... How do you do that?

632
00:51:09,485 --> 00:51:13,104
Well, first of all, you've got
to give the dog a lot of love.

633
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:16,113
- A good, healthy diet.
- Chilli.

634
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:19,237
Exercise is important, too.
You know, the key

635
00:51:19,327 --> 00:51:21,902
is to establish alpha leader
as soon as possible.

636
00:51:21,998 --> 00:51:25,117
- Alpha leader? What's that?
- You gotta show 'em who's boss.

637
00:51:25,208 --> 00:51:28,825
- Imprint on their psyche.
- I've done that. Believe me, I've done that.

638
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:33,297
- What... what... what is it, exactly.
- Most effective is to stare them down.

639
00:51:33,382 --> 00:51:36,336
You look straight at them.
You make them look away first.

640
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:38,420
- I can do that.
- Even if it takes hours.

641
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,635
I can do that. I can do that.

642
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:43,392
- That's it, right?
- After that, you mount them.

643
00:51:43,476 --> 00:51:45,800
- Excuse me?
- You mount them.

644
00:51:46,227 --> 00:51:48,350
- You mount them?
- Uh-huh.

645
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:50,561
- You mean...?
- Yeah.

646
00:51:50,648 --> 00:51:52,641
Mount them?

647
00:51:54,068 --> 00:51:56,227
Mount them. Lucky dog.

648
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:02,276
Mount them?

649
00:52:07,873 --> 00:52:10,031
Jesus!

650
00:52:10,125 --> 00:52:12,877
- What are you doin' here?
- Sir? Excuse me.

651
00:52:12,961 --> 00:52:15,203
- No dogs in the hotel.
- What about her?

652
00:52:15,297 --> 00:52:18,797
- What about her?
- She has a dog. What do you call that?

653
00:52:18,884 --> 00:52:21,719
The hotel owner's daughter.
And the dog has to go.

654
00:52:22,096 --> 00:52:24,883
- Well, this is my seeing Eye dog.
- You're blind?

655
00:52:24,973 --> 00:52:27,973
- Yes.
- Were you blind when you walked in?

656
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:30,051
Yes, definitely.

657
00:52:30,771 --> 00:52:34,518
I'm so sorry. Would you like me
to read you the menu?

658
00:52:34,608 --> 00:52:36,600
No, I can handle it.

659
00:52:38,819 --> 00:52:40,813
Thank you.

660
00:52:45,993 --> 00:52:48,116
Is that my tea?

661
00:52:48,203 --> 00:52:51,987
You just ripped the mirror off
of my classic 1965 Mustang.

662
00:52:55,293 --> 00:52:57,998
I don't believe it. I just don't believe it.

663
00:53:07,347 --> 00:53:09,588
If you don't get down...
I don't care where we are...

664
00:53:09,682 --> 00:53:13,181
I'm gonna pull my revolver out
and shoot you.

665
00:53:14,937 --> 00:53:17,724
I am the alpha leader.

666
00:53:18,858 --> 00:53:20,849
I don't wanna have to mount you.

667
00:53:22,652 --> 00:53:24,728
That'll do it.

668
00:53:31,285 --> 00:53:33,990
Jerry Lee! Excuse me. I'm blind.

669
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,653
I'm blind. I'm blind. I'm blind.

670
00:53:36,749 --> 00:53:40,616
Excuse me. I'm blind! I'm blind.

671
00:54:09,529 --> 00:54:10,989
Shit!

672
00:54:11,866 --> 00:54:15,069
I don't know why you California people
insist on meeting outside.

673
00:54:15,161 --> 00:54:17,532
If I wanted a tan,
I woulda gone to the Bahamas.

674
00:54:17,619 --> 00:54:20,157
I like California. It's been good to me.

675
00:54:20,248 --> 00:54:23,451
- Tonight is the night.
- Sounds good, but so did the last time.

676
00:54:23,543 --> 00:54:27,790
- Ten million bucks' worth of coke, gone.
- Never again. Nobody'll get this.

677
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,751
- If there's exposure...
- I don't like a nervous partner,

678
00:54:30,841 --> 00:54:34,506
so calm down or I'm gonna blow this
whole deal and sell to somebody else.

679
00:54:34,595 --> 00:54:36,587
Oh...!

680
00:54:37,222 --> 00:54:40,805
Don't threaten me, Mr Lyman.
I'm in the threat business.

681
00:54:43,897 --> 00:54:47,062
Please don't take this the wrong way.

682
00:54:49,444 --> 00:54:53,523
- We need to get details straight.
- Just make sure you hold up your end.

683
00:54:53,613 --> 00:54:57,028
- You just make sure everything's on time.
- I'm not gonna wait for ever.

684
00:54:57,117 --> 00:55:00,983
I'm really sorry. You don't know what's
goin' on here, but you just saved my life.

685
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:03,071
Agh!

686
00:55:04,248 --> 00:55:06,241
I appreciate that.

687
00:55:07,085 --> 00:55:10,121
Ughhh. Very kind of you. Thank you.

688
00:55:28,021 --> 00:55:30,014
Come here!

689
00:55:40,741 --> 00:55:42,734
What do you want? Get back.

690
00:55:43,869 --> 00:55:45,862
Get back! Get away from me.

691
00:55:47,414 --> 00:55:50,164
What are you talkin' about?
Get away from me.

692
00:55:50,833 --> 00:55:53,834
What? There's nothin' in here for you.

693
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,912
This is police stuff here.

694
00:55:57,382 --> 00:55:59,373
Go away. Get away from me.

695
00:56:01,302 --> 00:56:03,295
This is mine!

696
00:56:05,223 --> 00:56:07,299
Let me eat in peace, will you?

697
00:56:07,391 --> 00:56:09,762
What? What? You can't have this!

698
00:56:10,392 --> 00:56:13,015
All right. I'll split it.
I'll split it with you, OK?

699
00:56:13,104 --> 00:56:16,224
What? I said I'd split it with you!
Here! Here! Here! Here!

700
00:56:16,316 --> 00:56:18,604
Take the whole goddamn thing!

701
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:22,397
Jesus! There's all kinds of sugar in that.

702
00:56:23,824 --> 00:56:25,151
Down!

703
00:56:46,052 --> 00:56:47,878
Jesus!

704
00:57:06,572 --> 00:57:09,738
You look like
you've been in a skiing accident!

705
00:57:22,212 --> 00:57:24,702
You wanna drive, get a licence!

706
00:57:43,773 --> 00:57:45,149
Yeah!

707
00:58:24,936 --> 00:58:26,930
What?

708
00:58:27,982 --> 00:58:29,974
What?

709
00:58:30,901 --> 00:58:33,024
Wait! I've only got two legs!

710
00:58:55,674 --> 00:58:57,963
Agh!

711
00:59:08,269 --> 00:59:10,974
All right. I'm comin'. I'm comin'!

712
00:59:12,774 --> 00:59:14,434
Don't let that dog psych you out.

713
00:59:14,526 --> 00:59:16,933
I'm comin'! Shut your yap!

714
00:59:17,027 --> 00:59:20,362
I'm comin'. I just want a running start
before I hit the pavement.

715
00:59:35,296 --> 00:59:37,086
Aaarghhh!

716
00:59:47,683 --> 00:59:51,217
Christ! Jesus! I woulda cleared it
if you hadn't barked.

717
00:59:51,311 --> 00:59:53,848
You threw me off!

718
00:59:53,938 --> 00:59:58,148
I suppose you think you're
such a hotshot... because you made it.

719
01:00:16,751 --> 01:00:18,743
You sure about this, huh?

720
01:00:41,566 --> 01:00:45,017
Oh, yeah, he's up here!

721
01:00:45,111 --> 01:00:48,562
Yes, sir! Got a smart puppy there!

722
01:00:48,656 --> 01:00:51,193
What?!

723
01:00:51,283 --> 01:00:54,118
Whaddaya want? There's no one up here!

724
01:00:54,828 --> 01:00:56,488
There's nobody here. What?

725
01:00:56,580 --> 01:00:59,367
I jumped over that damn thing
and no one's up here.

726
01:00:59,458 --> 01:01:03,586
Hey! Get back here when
I'm yellin' at you! I want you to listen.

727
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:06,920
What are you barkin' at?
Oh no, I got it. You're not barkin'.

728
01:01:07,215 --> 01:01:10,333
No, no. I can tell the difference
between a bark and a laugh!

729
01:01:10,426 --> 01:01:13,676
This is a dog joke. Ha, ha, ha, ha

730
01:01:13,763 --> 01:01:17,807
Oh, I'm laughin'. How many guys
have you brought up here, huh?

731
01:01:18,309 --> 01:01:20,596
No, you pulled a good one.

732
01:01:20,686 --> 01:01:25,147
I can see you down tonight, talking
to your chums, down at the pound.

733
01:01:25,232 --> 01:01:28,731
Yeah, havin' a good one.
"I pulled one on old Dooley. "

734
01:01:28,818 --> 01:01:30,229
You never give up, do you?

735
01:01:43,459 --> 01:01:46,743
Arghhh!

736
01:01:59,682 --> 01:02:03,726
Now there's a guy who definitely
has a right to remain silent.

737
01:02:05,771 --> 01:02:08,309
What?

738
01:02:08,397 --> 01:02:11,149
What do you want now? Want a medal?

739
01:02:11,234 --> 01:02:13,226
Huh?

740
01:02:15,696 --> 01:02:18,318
All right, all right. You found him.

741
01:02:18,407 --> 01:02:19,783
Good job.

742
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:39,340
Here you go. Halstead Motors.

743
01:02:39,427 --> 01:02:41,420
Got it.

744
01:03:15,794 --> 01:03:18,251
- Hi.
- Welcome to Halstead Motors. You are...?

745
01:03:18,464 --> 01:03:20,421
- Detective Dooley.
- And he is...?

746
01:03:20,507 --> 01:03:22,381
- With me.
- How can I help you?

747
01:03:22,466 --> 01:03:24,507
I got this invoice on one of your autos.

748
01:03:24,594 --> 01:03:27,547
Can you tell me if it's in dealer's stock
or if it's been sold?

749
01:03:27,681 --> 01:03:30,172
I'll have Miss Hewitt
check it out right away.

750
01:03:30,267 --> 01:03:32,258
Thank you.

751
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:43,642
You like this car?

752
01:03:43,736 --> 01:03:47,866
That's only 100,000 bucks.
That's 700,000 in doggie dollars.

753
01:03:55,123 --> 01:03:57,745
What are you doin'?

754
01:03:57,835 --> 01:04:00,040
Huh? Whaddaya got?

755
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:03,754
Find something? Whaddaya got?
You got something in there?

756
01:04:03,841 --> 01:04:07,588
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
That's a $70,000 car there, sport.

757
01:04:07,678 --> 01:04:10,880
Ah. sorry about that, but the dog
has his own mind. You know?

758
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:13,926
No problem. Name's Don. Sales manager.

759
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:17,802
- Michael Dooley. Nice to meet ya.
- BeautifuI dog. How can I help you?

760
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:22,603
- Well, I'm interested in this car.
- Mercedes 560 SL. Nothing more to say.

761
01:04:22,858 --> 01:04:25,016
- Nothing?
- Nothing. Car sells itself.

762
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:29,274
It says you've arrived, Mike. It speaks
of stability, class, family values.

763
01:04:29,364 --> 01:04:32,034
- But I'm single, Don.
- It's a babemobile, Mike.

764
01:04:32,117 --> 01:04:36,494
- I gotta have it. Let's test-drive it.
- Can do, Mike. I'll get the keys.

765
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:41,370
All right, buddy. Let's get this thing
outta here, then you can have it.

766
01:04:41,459 --> 01:04:43,747
- Detective Dooley?
- Yes.

767
01:04:43,836 --> 01:04:46,623
- I'm Jack Halstead, the owner.
- Oh, Jack, yeah.

768
01:04:46,714 --> 01:04:49,252
I was gonna take this baby
out for a test-drive.

769
01:04:49,342 --> 01:04:53,339
- Do you have 70,000 dollars?
- No, but I can do better than that.

770
01:04:53,429 --> 01:04:55,635
I have a brand-new Mercedes,
low mileage.

771
01:04:55,723 --> 01:04:58,593
It was used once,
in an attempted murder.

772
01:04:58,683 --> 01:05:01,138
Oh yes. This one.

773
01:05:01,811 --> 01:05:06,022
This car was reported stolen off the lot
at four o'clock this morning.

774
01:05:06,107 --> 01:05:08,266
Aw, Jack, does that mean
we don't have a deaI?

775
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:10,483
Call your station and confirm it,

776
01:05:10,569 --> 01:05:13,904
but not from my phone
and not from my lot.

777
01:05:18,951 --> 01:05:23,281
All right. I know, I know. I know the car's
dirty. I just don't wanna do it now.

778
01:05:23,373 --> 01:05:25,864
I wanna be there at the exchange.

779
01:05:25,958 --> 01:05:30,170
I want Lyman. Let's go. Come on.

780
01:05:36,009 --> 01:05:38,002
All right, buddy.

781
01:05:38,930 --> 01:05:40,921
I'll be just a minute.

782
01:05:50,982 --> 01:05:53,390
- Hi. Can I help you?
- What have we got here?

783
01:06:39,529 --> 01:06:42,529
Hey, buddy. She's hot, huh?

784
01:06:43,158 --> 01:06:46,074
Yes, sir. Looks and money.

785
01:06:46,161 --> 01:06:49,659
Love it when they shave
their beaks. Don't you?

786
01:06:49,746 --> 01:06:53,280
You know what? This kind loves cops.

787
01:06:53,374 --> 01:06:55,498
Loves 'em.

788
01:06:55,586 --> 01:06:58,540
Boy, can you imagine
what she'd do to you?

789
01:06:58,629 --> 01:07:01,964
Well, that's too bad. You're on duty now.

790
01:07:02,049 --> 01:07:04,375
It's definitely an all-nighter.

791
01:07:07,762 --> 01:07:10,052
You got ten minutes.

792
01:07:42,212 --> 01:07:44,703
- What are you doing?
- Don't lean against my ride.

793
01:07:44,799 --> 01:07:46,256
This is your car? I'm sorry.

794
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:48,547
Don't stand next to it.
Stand next to yours.

795
01:07:48,636 --> 01:07:52,003
That's nice, but this is beautiful.
Where'd you get those glasses?

796
01:07:52,096 --> 01:07:54,089
Did you get those glasses in the mall?

797
01:07:54,182 --> 01:07:58,049
I'd like to get a pair of those.
I need some sunglasses. Is this your car?

798
01:07:58,144 --> 01:08:00,896
- Something's goin' on in there.
- In here?

799
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:03,436
Some big dog is humpin' my Aretha!

800
01:08:03,524 --> 01:08:05,516
No!

801
01:08:06,275 --> 01:08:09,312
- Is that your dog?
- Technically? No.

802
01:08:10,238 --> 01:08:12,564
Let's work something out.
They're almost done.

803
01:08:12,657 --> 01:08:15,575
- Why don't I buy you a tank of gas?
- A tank of gas?

804
01:08:15,659 --> 01:08:18,234
For my Aretha? Get real!
That's a $100 dog!

805
01:08:18,330 --> 01:08:20,702
How about 25 bucks
and a full tank of gas?

806
01:08:20,790 --> 01:08:24,324
I gotta get at least a bill for Lady Ree.
I'm a businessman. You dig?

807
01:08:24,418 --> 01:08:28,498
- I'm a cop. You dig?
- A cop? You're a cop?

808
01:08:28,589 --> 01:08:31,162
- You're kiddin' me.
- Yeah.

809
01:08:31,258 --> 01:08:35,126
- No problem.
- Hey! Uh, here. This is for the little lady.

810
01:08:35,221 --> 01:08:37,212
Thank you, officer.

811
01:08:42,228 --> 01:08:44,219
Jerry Lee. Time's up.

812
01:09:40,699 --> 01:09:43,902
Jerry Lee. Let's go.

813
01:10:04,346 --> 01:10:06,339
Tracy?

814
01:10:08,809 --> 01:10:10,802
Trace?

815
01:10:16,566 --> 01:10:18,808
Honey. Honey?

816
01:10:32,665 --> 01:10:35,914
What are you actin' up about?
You should be mellow. You got laid.

817
01:10:41,839 --> 01:10:44,296
Uh, oops.
I think I have the wrong number.

818
01:10:44,383 --> 01:10:47,219
- Yes, you do.
- Yeah, Tracy, it's Jack.

819
01:10:47,303 --> 01:10:49,758
We've changed the date of the seminar
to the 5th,

820
01:10:49,847 --> 01:10:53,431
so you have more time to prepare
your material. OK? See ya.

821
01:10:55,935 --> 01:11:00,397
I'm calling for
Michael Dooley. This is the third call.

822
01:11:00,483 --> 01:11:03,649
This is Stan Gamboa
from Internal Revenue...

823
01:11:03,736 --> 01:11:06,571
- Yeah, right, stan.
- Set up a time for your audit. Call me.

824
01:11:06,655 --> 01:11:09,407
Yeah, I'll call ya. sure. Fat chance.

825
01:11:12,286 --> 01:11:16,365
Dooley, listen carefully.
I'm with some people right now.

826
01:11:16,456 --> 01:11:18,781
They came to the house.

827
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:21,829
Dooley, you have to do
what they say. Please.

828
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:24,164
Dooley?

829
01:11:29,928 --> 01:11:32,928
Tracy's real smart.
She's behaving.

830
01:11:33,012 --> 01:11:36,014
You gotta be smart too
if you wanna see her again.

831
01:11:36,099 --> 01:11:41,556
That shipment you're chasin', just
let it go. Stay home tonight. Don't leave.

832
01:11:41,647 --> 01:11:44,765
Do your part and you'll have breakfast
with your girl tomorrow.

833
01:11:44,858 --> 01:11:46,934
And don't push this any more.

834
01:12:15,719 --> 01:12:17,962
Wash it, wax it, put a windshield in.

835
01:12:32,610 --> 01:12:34,104
Hi!

836
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:43,245
- Hey.
- It's by invitation only.

837
01:12:43,329 --> 01:12:45,369
- Call the cops.
- You don't belong here.

838
01:12:45,456 --> 01:12:47,780
Call the cops.

839
01:12:52,462 --> 01:12:55,249
Sorry we're late!

840
01:12:57,259 --> 01:12:59,252
Ken!

841
01:13:01,179 --> 01:13:05,391
This is a bitchin' pad, man!
You got a pool in your dining room!

842
01:13:05,475 --> 01:13:07,634
You know, I gotta get one of these.

843
01:13:07,810 --> 01:13:11,973
Hey, I'm sorry Tracy couldn't make it,
but she kinda disappeared on me.

844
01:13:12,064 --> 01:13:15,729
But the invitation did say bring a guest,
so I brought Jerry Lee.

845
01:13:15,818 --> 01:13:19,651
- Why don't you mingle with the guests?
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

846
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:22,147
Ken, come on now. I just got here.

847
01:13:22,242 --> 01:13:25,076
- Please escort this man to the door.
- Freeze!

848
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:29,987
Oh, I'm not gonna shoot you.

849
01:13:30,082 --> 01:13:33,498
You guys are good guys.
He's the bad guy.

850
01:13:33,586 --> 01:13:36,421
Ken, I'd have a seat.
You don't look too good.

851
01:13:36,505 --> 01:13:39,957
Well, I think we'd best all do as he says.

852
01:13:40,050 --> 01:13:42,458
No, Ken, just you. Not "we" - "you".

853
01:13:42,552 --> 01:13:45,089
This poor man is obviously
confused and upset.

854
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:47,849
Upset? Do I look upset to you?

855
01:13:47,932 --> 01:13:50,554
Am I upset? Do I look upset?
I'm not upset.

856
01:13:50,643 --> 01:13:53,643
I'm a party animal! I love parties, Ken!

857
01:13:53,730 --> 01:13:56,221
Come on! What's the grub like?

858
01:13:56,523 --> 01:13:58,647
Hm.

859
01:13:58,735 --> 01:14:01,522
This wine sucks. Is this crystal?

860
01:14:03,405 --> 01:14:05,812
Doesn't have the ring.
Don't think it's crystaI.

861
01:14:06,116 --> 01:14:08,321
I'm pretty disappointed in this man here.

862
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:10,817
For a murderer and
a kidnapper and a drug runner,

863
01:14:10,912 --> 01:14:14,530
I thought you'd have a little better taste.
I mean, where's the brew?

864
01:14:14,625 --> 01:14:17,875
Where's the sounds?
And the lighting in here sucks.

865
01:14:19,463 --> 01:14:22,296
That's better. It's a little more intimate.

866
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:24,337
Sets the mood.

867
01:14:24,424 --> 01:14:28,885
What's that, Ken? Is that an ice sculpture?
Somebody win that? Is this raffled off?

868
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:31,378
Is this something you do
in your part time?

869
01:14:31,473 --> 01:14:34,308
Between the kidnapping
and the drugs and the murders?

870
01:14:34,392 --> 01:14:36,385
You make that yourself, Ken?

871
01:14:37,479 --> 01:14:39,850
Who is that, Ken? Is that you?

872
01:14:39,938 --> 01:14:41,350
No, that's Zeus.

873
01:14:46,111 --> 01:14:48,187
I hate mythology.

874
01:14:48,989 --> 01:14:51,907
Well, Mr Halstead,
surprised to see you here.

875
01:14:51,992 --> 01:14:54,364
Don't be tense. Just relax.

876
01:14:54,453 --> 01:14:57,122
You know, most of you
look like very nice people.

877
01:14:57,206 --> 01:14:59,992
It surprises me that you're here,
mixing with scum.

878
01:15:00,333 --> 01:15:03,203
I mean, the kind of scum
that kidnaps my girlfriend.

879
01:15:03,711 --> 01:15:06,582
You're making a terrible mistake.

880
01:15:06,672 --> 01:15:08,960
Does that look like a mistake to you?

881
01:15:09,050 --> 01:15:13,593
- Does that look like a 9mm mistake?
- Put it down, mister! Drop it, mister!

882
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:17,461
Tell me if it's a mistake to blow
your brains against the wall, Lyman.

883
01:15:17,557 --> 01:15:20,309
- Where is she?!
- Dooley, put the gun down.

884
01:15:20,394 --> 01:15:23,560
- Gimme the gun, Dooley.
- Shame you have to leave so early.

885
01:15:23,646 --> 01:15:27,146
- You really are the life of the party.
- You're goin' down, Lyman.

886
01:15:27,234 --> 01:15:29,558
Perhaps next time
you can bring your lady friend.

887
01:15:29,653 --> 01:15:33,485
- You're goin' down, Lyman.
- See? See? The man is a lunatic.

888
01:15:33,573 --> 01:15:36,776
- Outta control.
- You can arrest me, Lyman! Go ahead!

889
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:39,276
- But you know what?
- I'll have you prosecuted!

890
01:15:39,371 --> 01:15:43,867
I'll make bail in 24 hours, and they'll
have to peel me off you with a crowbar!

891
01:15:43,959 --> 01:15:46,165
You're goin' down, buddy!

892
01:15:46,252 --> 01:15:49,586
I'm gonna have your ass
behind bars permanently!

893
01:15:50,757 --> 01:15:53,960
And get that damn dog off my table.

894
01:15:55,635 --> 01:15:59,004
Just let me outta
this goddamn cage, will ya?

895
01:16:04,519 --> 01:16:06,677
Byers! Byers!

896
01:16:07,565 --> 01:16:10,980
Rog, Rog. Jesus, am I glad you're here,
man. Cut me loose now, will ya?

897
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:15,645
- You blew it. You are out of controI.
- No, I tried to convince Lyman I'm crazy.

898
01:16:15,737 --> 01:16:18,609
- I got news for you: you are crazy.
- Listen to me, Roger.

899
01:16:18,699 --> 01:16:22,946
Lyman's got Tracy. He kidnapped her
to keep me from that shipment.

900
01:16:23,036 --> 01:16:25,907
- I wouldn't lie to you.
- Sure you would. You always do.

901
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:30,245
Not this. I'm tellin' you the truth. I got
an answering-machine tape to prove it.

902
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:34,546
I had to put this move on, to convince
Lyman that I was nuts. I had to con him.

903
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:39,541
Put yourself in his position. He thinks
for the next 24 hours I'm behind bars.

904
01:16:39,635 --> 01:16:43,336
What would you do? You'd move that
shipment of dope before I made bail.

905
01:16:43,431 --> 01:16:46,218
That's what you'd do.
The deal is goin' down tonight.

906
01:16:46,309 --> 01:16:48,681
I gotta be there. You gotta let me out now.

907
01:16:48,769 --> 01:16:54,189
I don't wanna hear it. It's your bullshit
that got Tracy involved in the first place.

908
01:16:54,274 --> 01:16:56,599
From here on in,
this is a coordinated effort.

909
01:16:56,693 --> 01:16:59,647
That means you, me,
and the rest of the department.

910
01:16:59,779 --> 01:17:01,772
Let's go.

911
01:17:14,417 --> 01:17:17,252
- Oh, what is that?!
- God, who let that one go?

912
01:17:17,338 --> 01:17:21,003
- How could you fart in a closed car?
- He did it. He ate chilli today.

913
01:17:21,090 --> 01:17:24,211
- I'm rollin' my window down.
- You gotta let him go.

914
01:17:24,303 --> 01:17:26,460
- Pull over, would you?
- I'm pulling over.

915
01:17:26,555 --> 01:17:29,259
- Get some air in here.
- There he goes again.

916
01:17:29,347 --> 01:17:32,883
I'm sorry. Hey, I'm the one
stuck in the back seat here.

917
01:17:32,977 --> 01:17:34,969
- I'm pullin' over.
- It stinks.

918
01:17:44,404 --> 01:17:46,564
You're gonna lose your badge, go to jail.

919
01:17:46,657 --> 01:17:49,907
Every minute we wait,
there's another chance Tracy'll get hurt.

920
01:17:49,992 --> 01:17:54,701
- I don't care. You're outta control.
- I'm not outta control. It was a planned...

921
01:17:54,789 --> 01:17:57,874
- How long will it take this dog to piss?
- I don't know.

922
01:17:57,958 --> 01:18:00,747
OK, come on. Let's go.
Get him back in here!

923
01:18:00,837 --> 01:18:03,507
I can't find him.
I don't know where he went.

924
01:18:08,636 --> 01:18:12,336
- Get the damn dog.
- I don't know where he is.

925
01:18:12,848 --> 01:18:15,470
Down here a minute ago.
I don't know where he went.

926
01:18:15,559 --> 01:18:19,260
- Where the hell did he go?
- Jerry Lee, shake it off! Let's go!

927
01:18:23,692 --> 01:18:26,645
I really need this.
Waiting for some mutt...

928
01:18:26,736 --> 01:18:29,192
Come here, boy. Hold them.

929
01:18:30,657 --> 01:18:33,230
- What is this?
- He's tense. You rushed him.

930
01:18:33,618 --> 01:18:36,074
Get in the back seat.

931
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:39,205
He's very touchy about that back seat.

932
01:18:39,289 --> 01:18:41,698
You're in deep enough as it is.
Now call him off.

933
01:18:41,793 --> 01:18:45,624
Hey, no way. Once he gets somethin'
into his head, there's nothing I can do.

934
01:18:45,712 --> 01:18:49,377
- Look at him. He's nuts!
- Damn it, Dooley, this is it.

935
01:18:49,466 --> 01:18:52,253
I have no time for
coordinated efforts, understand?

936
01:18:52,344 --> 01:18:54,716
They move that load, and Tracy's dead.

937
01:18:56,682 --> 01:18:58,509
Jerry Lee, come!

938
01:19:00,059 --> 01:19:02,053
Damn it, Dooley!

939
01:19:10,987 --> 01:19:15,944
OK, this is how it works.
The guy moves, he jumps into the clear,

940
01:19:16,033 --> 01:19:19,817
I shoot and...

941
01:19:19,912 --> 01:19:23,860
And I miss and I lose. Great.

942
01:19:23,956 --> 01:19:27,657
It's supposed to make this great big noise,
like applause, if you win.

943
01:19:27,752 --> 01:19:31,121
I can only assume that's true,
because I've never won.

944
01:19:32,965 --> 01:19:35,835
They gotta show up soon.
I mean, the stash is here.

945
01:19:35,926 --> 01:19:38,547
You know, we find them, we'll find her.

946
01:19:38,637 --> 01:19:42,005
I know it's a long shot,
but it's the only shot we got, right?

947
01:19:42,099 --> 01:19:43,807
Right?

948
01:19:48,771 --> 01:19:52,306
You know, I met her on the beach
in La Jolla about four years ago.

949
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,523
I was in a toilet with these binoculars.

950
01:19:54,610 --> 01:19:57,944
I was checkin' out these kids
selling some weed down on the beach.

951
01:19:58,031 --> 01:20:00,107
It was hot that day.

952
01:20:00,198 --> 01:20:02,440
That bathroom smelled like...

953
01:20:02,534 --> 01:20:04,740
well, a lot like you do, you know?

954
01:20:04,828 --> 01:20:09,406
So I'm scopin' out the sand, and bam!
I come across this goddess.

955
01:20:10,542 --> 01:20:15,334
Forget the kids. I'm not watchin'
the kids any more, I'm watchin' her.

956
01:20:15,422 --> 01:20:17,545
She's reading, right?

957
01:20:17,632 --> 01:20:21,298
She stops, she puts the book down,

958
01:20:21,386 --> 01:20:25,336
she reaches into her pocket
and pulls out a chapstick.

959
01:20:25,432 --> 01:20:27,555
And she puts it to her lips.

960
01:20:29,394 --> 01:20:31,303
All right, I'm goin' nuts.

961
01:20:31,396 --> 01:20:35,690
I know it's just a chapstick, but it's the
most erotic thing I've ever seen in my life.

962
01:20:35,776 --> 01:20:39,559
All of a sudden I feel real uncomfortable,
like I'm invading her privacy.

963
01:20:39,653 --> 01:20:43,816
I'm feelin' sleazy, which is really weird
because I usually like that feeling.

964
01:20:43,908 --> 01:20:48,320
So anyway, I get up. I walk toward her,
you know, I go out of the john.

965
01:20:48,411 --> 01:20:52,954
I'm sweatin' like a whore in church.
I got toilet paper draggin' around my feet.

966
01:20:53,042 --> 01:20:57,786
I look like I should be in a straitjacket.
I walk up, look down at her, she looks up.

967
01:20:58,503 --> 01:21:00,497
She pulls these glasses down.

968
01:21:01,841 --> 01:21:07,511
She says to me "I'm reading Journey
to the End of the Night, by Celine. "

969
01:21:07,596 --> 01:21:09,719
"The original French version. "

970
01:21:10,558 --> 01:21:12,550
"Have you read it?"

971
01:21:13,477 --> 01:21:16,097
Have I read it, she asks, right?

972
01:21:16,854 --> 01:21:20,982
I mean, she just naturally assumes
I'm, like, this regular person.

973
01:21:21,068 --> 01:21:24,518
Not some schmo cop. Have I read it?

974
01:21:26,989 --> 01:21:30,239
Well, of course I didn't read it,
but, I mean, you know.

975
01:21:30,327 --> 01:21:32,734
She just, like, looked at me, you know.

976
01:21:34,455 --> 01:21:36,910
God, I loved her for that, you know.

977
01:21:39,167 --> 01:21:41,160
What's the matter?

978
01:21:44,005 --> 01:21:45,998
Hello.

979
01:21:56,809 --> 01:21:59,644
Halstead. Damn.

980
01:21:59,728 --> 01:22:01,721
Left the party too early, buddy.

981
01:22:13,741 --> 01:22:18,699
Oh, bingo. Red Mercedes.
Here we are. We're on, buddy.

982
01:22:29,966 --> 01:22:32,882
Halstead! Pull over to the side of the road!

983
01:22:34,386 --> 01:22:37,173
Come on, Halstead, call it a night!

984
01:23:31,148 --> 01:23:32,642
Arghhh!

985
01:23:39,990 --> 01:23:42,148
I'll be damned.

986
01:23:50,958 --> 01:23:53,793
- I shoulda killed him.
- You shoulda ducked.

987
01:23:55,671 --> 01:23:59,586
I could've taken him out right there.
Then he'd be done. End of story.

988
01:23:59,675 --> 01:24:03,126
Dooley is yours.
The girl is yours. A gift from me.

989
01:24:03,221 --> 01:24:07,680
Make it as messy and painful as you
want, but later. Right now I need you here.

990
01:24:07,766 --> 01:24:11,894
Concentrate. Focus on
the business at hand.

991
01:24:11,978 --> 01:24:14,219
- Halstead is late.
- What's a few minutes?

992
01:24:14,314 --> 01:24:17,931
Halstead is never late.
Sculley, pour me a brandy, will ya?

993
01:24:18,026 --> 01:24:20,019
I'll get it.

994
01:24:27,201 --> 01:24:29,240
How you doin', sweet pants?

995
01:24:30,579 --> 01:24:33,330
I can't wait to bump into your boyfriend.

996
01:24:34,458 --> 01:24:36,616
Hell, I might even pay his bail.

997
01:24:37,127 --> 01:24:40,627
See, I got a present for him.
A Colombian necktie.

998
01:24:41,589 --> 01:24:43,582
Know what that is?

999
01:24:44,174 --> 01:24:47,876
First you slit his throat, then you reach in,
grab his tongue, rip it out,

1000
01:24:47,970 --> 01:24:50,806
and you just leave it
hangin' like a necktie.

1001
01:24:50,889 --> 01:24:53,214
And you and me gonna party, babe.

1002
01:24:54,684 --> 01:24:56,558
Why not?

1003
01:24:58,146 --> 01:25:00,638
Come here.

1004
01:25:01,691 --> 01:25:03,685
Come here.

1005
01:25:05,029 --> 01:25:07,021
Oh, God.

1006
01:25:07,948 --> 01:25:09,941
You bitch!

1007
01:25:11,535 --> 01:25:14,738
Well, it's about time.

1008
01:25:17,499 --> 01:25:18,911
Later.

1009
01:25:42,730 --> 01:25:45,517
- You're late!
- Yeah, traffic's a bitch.

1010
01:25:46,651 --> 01:25:49,023
Hey, bad idea.

1011
01:25:49,112 --> 01:25:51,401
- I press this and the cocaine goes boom.
- Easy.

1012
01:25:51,489 --> 01:25:54,407
I got 20 pounds
of explosives in this truck.

1013
01:25:54,492 --> 01:25:57,529
This little baby here sends a signaI,
we got liftoff.

1014
01:25:57,619 --> 01:26:00,786
It snows in san Diego.

1015
01:26:00,873 --> 01:26:04,076
Look, Lyman, I got somethin' you want,
you got somethin' I want.

1016
01:26:04,167 --> 01:26:08,212
I don't care about you or your drugs
any more. I want the girl and I want out.

1017
01:26:13,718 --> 01:26:16,174
Sculley! Bring the girl.

1018
01:26:24,729 --> 01:26:26,971
It's gonna be all right, honey.

1019
01:26:27,064 --> 01:26:30,230
It's gonna be all right, baby.
We'll be outta here.

1020
01:26:32,153 --> 01:26:35,436
You know what?
I think you're connin' me.

1021
01:26:36,363 --> 01:26:39,282
I think I should have Dillon here
just cut you in half.

1022
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:42,194
Go ahead.

1023
01:26:43,288 --> 01:26:45,279
Go ahead!

1024
01:26:46,666 --> 01:26:49,501
Here comes your helicopter.

1025
01:26:50,294 --> 01:26:52,916
Here comes your 50 million.

1026
01:26:53,005 --> 01:26:57,132
Boy, I'd sure hate to waste that
on a dumb cop and his girlfriend.

1027
01:26:59,302 --> 01:27:01,294
What's it gonna be, Lyman?

1028
01:27:08,561 --> 01:27:10,637
Cut her loose.

1029
01:27:12,690 --> 01:27:14,682
You're a dead man, Dooley.

1030
01:27:14,775 --> 01:27:17,978
I'll find ya. And when I do,
I'm gonna kill ya.

1031
01:27:20,114 --> 01:27:22,107
Walk.

1032
01:27:46,932 --> 01:27:49,220
Jerry, get off him!

1033
01:27:50,726 --> 01:27:52,518
Get off!

1034
01:27:53,479 --> 01:27:55,851
Jerry, off!

1035
01:28:56,746 --> 01:28:59,118
- Jesus!
- We gotta get him outta here.

1036
01:28:59,207 --> 01:29:01,200
Cover him, cover him.

1037
01:29:03,545 --> 01:29:06,117
- Come on.
- It's all right, buddy.

1038
01:29:12,594 --> 01:29:14,587
It's all right, buddy.

1039
01:29:17,891 --> 01:29:19,967
It's OK, buddy. Hang in there.

1040
01:29:55,552 --> 01:29:58,553
Gunshot wound. Can you show me
which way to Emergency?

1041
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:01,390
- Sir, that is a dog.
- Yes, it's a dog and he's been shot.

1042
01:30:01,476 --> 01:30:03,966
- This is a hospital.
- I'm a police officer, lady.

1043
01:30:04,061 --> 01:30:06,848
- You can't bring that dog in here.
- He's bleeding to death.

1044
01:30:06,937 --> 01:30:09,772
- We don't treat animals.
- I don't have time to argue.

1045
01:30:09,858 --> 01:30:11,981
Can you just show me
where the doctors are?

1046
01:30:12,067 --> 01:30:16,813
- If you don't leave right now...
- I'm not leaving, lady. I'm not leaving.

1047
01:30:16,906 --> 01:30:20,026
- There isn't anyone here...
- I just want one of your doctors.

1048
01:30:20,118 --> 01:30:23,984
None of them can help you. sit back
in the reception room and we'll try and...

1049
01:30:24,079 --> 01:30:26,534
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.
Are you a doctor?

1050
01:30:26,623 --> 01:30:29,826
- What the hell is this?
- He says he's a police officer.

1051
01:30:29,919 --> 01:30:32,373
I told him he couldn't
bring the dog in here.

1052
01:30:32,462 --> 01:30:34,620
I have an emergency here.
I need your help.

1053
01:30:34,714 --> 01:30:38,415
- What's your problem?
- It's him. He's been shot in the chest.

1054
01:30:38,510 --> 01:30:41,675
- You need to work on him now.
- There are health regulations.

1055
01:30:41,762 --> 01:30:45,760
I don't care about that. I can't take him
anywhere else. He's not gonna make it.

1056
01:30:45,849 --> 01:30:48,221
Look, either you help him now
or he's gonna die.

1057
01:30:48,310 --> 01:30:51,062
Don't get so excited. It's just a dog.

1058
01:30:51,146 --> 01:30:53,720
He's not "just" a dog.

1059
01:30:54,858 --> 01:30:57,859
He's a cop. And he's not just
any cop. He's my partner.

1060
01:30:59,737 --> 01:31:01,979
Do you know about medicine?

1061
01:31:02,072 --> 01:31:04,231
Do you know how to remove a bullet?

1062
01:31:08,246 --> 01:31:10,368
I can remove the bullet.

1063
01:31:10,831 --> 01:31:14,082
I need some help in here!
Let's move this dog now.

1064
01:31:14,167 --> 01:31:16,161
Let's go. Come on.

1065
01:31:18,922 --> 01:31:22,291
He's gonna be fine.
He's gonna be all right. He's tough.

1066
01:31:22,384 --> 01:31:27,176
Did I tell you what he did in the bar?
He saved my ass in the bar, Jerry Lee.

1067
01:31:27,262 --> 01:31:31,343
I mean, that's his job. His job is
to take a bullet. That's what K-9s are for.

1068
01:31:31,434 --> 01:31:34,684
To take the bullet to save people.
That's exactly what he did.

1069
01:31:34,771 --> 01:31:39,598
He went between me and Lyman.
He took the bullet. That's what they're for.

1070
01:31:40,693 --> 01:31:42,401
He's a goddamn dog, that's all.

1071
01:31:42,485 --> 01:31:46,698
And that's what he did. He went
between me and Lyman. He took the hit.

1072
01:31:49,118 --> 01:31:52,569
He's just... just bleedin'. He bled a lot.

1073
01:32:11,055 --> 01:32:13,926
You know, I've been after Lyman
for two years.

1074
01:32:15,058 --> 01:32:18,095
Two years. And it wasn't worth it.

1075
01:32:20,647 --> 01:32:23,601
It just wasn't worth it.
You could have gotten killed.

1076
01:32:23,692 --> 01:32:26,609
You too, but we didn't.
You're a good cop, Dooley.

1077
01:32:26,695 --> 01:32:29,067
Yeah, yeah, right. Shoot.

1078
01:32:31,450 --> 01:32:33,655
I can't take this any more.

1079
01:33:15,824 --> 01:33:17,816
Jerry Lee?

1080
01:33:26,793 --> 01:33:28,785
Jerry?

1081
01:33:30,463 --> 01:33:32,954
Jerry Lee, can you hear me?

1082
01:33:36,217 --> 01:33:41,213
I wish you could hear me, because there's
a couple of things I wanted to tell you.

1083
01:33:41,307 --> 01:33:43,548
You know, like, uh...

1084
01:33:44,351 --> 01:33:48,562
Like I know our relationship
was a little rocky. OK?

1085
01:33:48,646 --> 01:33:51,563
And I know we didn't exactly
click as partners.

1086
01:33:52,149 --> 01:33:55,352
And the way it looks now,
it doesn't look like we ever will.

1087
01:33:55,444 --> 01:33:58,779
I never had a dog before. I didn't know
what you were supposed to do.

1088
01:33:58,864 --> 01:34:02,363
I should have got a book and read
about it, is what I should have done.

1089
01:34:02,451 --> 01:34:06,116
But I do know now that I shouldn't
have yelled at you. I yelled at you a lot.

1090
01:34:06,205 --> 01:34:09,240
Even though you took the mirror
off my Mustang, you know.

1091
01:34:09,332 --> 01:34:14,373
'65 classic Mustang,
which I love. I love that car.

1092
01:34:14,462 --> 01:34:18,674
But it's OK. It's OK, because I know
I shouldn't have yelled at you.

1093
01:34:18,759 --> 01:34:22,804
You know, and... and I know
it wasn't all your fault.

1094
01:34:22,888 --> 01:34:25,557
I mean, it could have been
partially my fault and...

1095
01:34:25,641 --> 01:34:29,969
OK, it was probably more my fault
than yours, and I feeI bad about that.

1096
01:34:30,061 --> 01:34:32,054
And I'm sorry.

1097
01:34:32,939 --> 01:34:37,352
You know, I mean, I locked you up
in closets all night and yelled at you.

1098
01:34:37,443 --> 01:34:39,436
I put you through a car wash.

1099
01:34:40,904 --> 01:34:45,946
What else? I kicked you outta bed while
I was trying to make love with Tracy.

1100
01:34:46,033 --> 01:34:49,118
That was very insensitive of me.
I know that now.

1101
01:34:49,746 --> 01:34:52,664
And we should have went to Vegas,
is what we should have done.

1102
01:34:52,749 --> 01:34:55,999
If you were around right now,
that's what we'd do - we'd go to Vegas.

1103
01:34:56,086 --> 01:34:59,289
For the weekend, you know.
We'd pick up a couple of broads.

1104
01:34:59,381 --> 01:35:03,045
I'd take Tracy, and we could pick up
that little poodle with the shaved beak.

1105
01:35:03,135 --> 01:35:07,630
She was hot. Ooh, she was sexy.
I'd even let you sleep with us.

1106
01:35:07,721 --> 01:35:12,715
I mean, down at the bottom of the bed,
you know, not in between us again.

1107
01:35:12,810 --> 01:35:16,475
- That was a little rough.
- There you are. Been lookin' for ya.

1108
01:35:16,564 --> 01:35:21,190
- You're not allowed in the recovery room.
- Yeah, I know. I was just, uh...

1109
01:35:21,277 --> 01:35:24,941
- Recovery room?
- Yeah, this is the recovery room.

1110
01:35:25,612 --> 01:35:29,361
- You mean, this is where patients, uh...?
- Come to recover.

1111
01:35:30,993 --> 01:35:33,994
- So the dog is...?
- Gonna be just fine.

1112
01:35:36,707 --> 01:35:38,700
Oh.

1113
01:35:39,418 --> 01:35:42,453
- Can I have just a couple of minutes?
- No problem.

1114
01:35:49,051 --> 01:35:51,009
You asshole.

1115
01:35:52,513 --> 01:35:55,182
Were you listening to everything I said?

1116
01:35:55,266 --> 01:36:00,223
Well, you can just forget all of it, because
I thought I was talkin' to a dead dog!

1117
01:36:00,729 --> 01:36:06,732
I wouldn't take a sneaky, manipulative,
lying flea circus like you anywhere,

1118
01:36:06,818 --> 01:36:09,570
let alone Vegas. Vegas? Forget it.

1119
01:36:09,654 --> 01:36:13,272
The dog - the poodle with
the shaved beak that you love so much?

1120
01:36:13,366 --> 01:36:15,359
Eat your heart out.

1121
01:36:16,411 --> 01:36:18,569
Oh, God.

1122
01:36:18,747 --> 01:36:21,319
You don't deserve to live. You know that?

1123
01:36:28,380 --> 01:36:30,373
But I'm glad you did.
