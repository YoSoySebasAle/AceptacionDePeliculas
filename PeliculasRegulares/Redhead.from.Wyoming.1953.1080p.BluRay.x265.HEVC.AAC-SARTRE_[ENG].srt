1
00:01:07,813 --> 00:01:10,943
<i>When the territories of
the Great West were thrown open...</i>

2
00:01:11,031 --> 00:01:13,683
<i>men of all kinds rushed in.</i>

3
00:01:15,249 --> 00:01:18,903
<i>Most came to settle peaceably,
lured by free land...</i>

4
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,425
<i>gold, cattle.</i>

5
00:01:22,511 --> 00:01:25,121
<i>A man could begin a herd
with a maverick:</i>

6
00:01:25,165 --> 00:01:27,948
<i>An unbranded stray on the public range.</i>

7
00:01:28,035 --> 00:01:31,296
<i>By putting his brand on it,
he owned it.</i>

8
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:34,992
<i>Cattle barons had started
their great herds with mavericks.</i>

9
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:39,211
<i>Now they fought each settler
who tried to do the same.</i>

10
00:01:39,298 --> 00:01:42,385
<i>They fought to keep the settlers
off the public lands...</i>

11
00:01:42,472 --> 00:01:46,168
<i>drive them from their homes...</i>

12
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:53,430
<i>destroy their towns.</i>

13
00:01:53,517 --> 00:01:56,866
<i>Vast ranges became the
battlegrounds of cattle wars.</i>

14
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:04,693
<i>When the Wyoming big ranchers
found guns were not enough...</i>

15
00:02:04,781 --> 00:02:06,781
<i>they used the Maverick Law:</i>

16
00:02:06,867 --> 00:02:09,955
<i>A law through which they appointed
themselves commissioners...</i>

17
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:13,696
<i>with power to rule on the ownership
of every maverick branded.</i>

18
00:02:13,782 --> 00:02:17,261
<i>A commissioner's ruling could
declare the settler a rustler...</i>

19
00:02:17,347 --> 00:02:21,393
<i>outlaw his brand,
make his mavericks illegal to sell.</i>

20
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,132
<i>Of course, there was no shortage
of sharp-witted men...</i>

21
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,438
<i>who were quick
to take advantage of this law.</i>

22
00:02:26,698 --> 00:02:28,612
I know what I'm entitled to!

23
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:31,003
I'm willing to fight for my rights!

24
00:02:31,091 --> 00:02:35,483
And I'm willing to fight for your rights,
but you've got to stand behind me.

25
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,396
You've got to put me
in the Governor's mansion!

26
00:02:38,483 --> 00:02:42,615
You've got to have someone to
represent you, not just Reece Duncan.

27
00:02:42,702 --> 00:02:45,094
Go ahead, Mr Averell.
Don't let me stop you.

28
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,051
What brings you to town?
Your ears burning?

29
00:02:50,225 --> 00:02:52,877
<i>What is this Maverick Law?</i>

30
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:57,835
The Maverick Law was designed to
protect us all against cattle rustling.

31
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:01,183
There is nothing in that law
that says new settlers...

32
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:04,922
can't pick up unbranded cattle
and call them their own.

33
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:09,184
<i>When a Cattle Commission was appointed
to watch over brands and cattle...</i>

34
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,358
<i>that was for our protection too!</i>

35
00:03:11,445 --> 00:03:14,142
I'd like to ask Mr Duncan one question.

36
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:16,839
<i>I'd like to ask him
who paid bribe money...</i>

37
00:03:16,925 --> 00:03:20,405
<i>to the Cattle Commissioners
to outlaw your brands?</i>

38
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:25,014
<i>To see to it that every time you roped
a maverick it was confiscated?</i>

39
00:03:28,494 --> 00:03:33,450
Just hold it still everybody,
real quiet and still.

40
00:03:33,495 --> 00:03:35,669
Put the gun away.

41
00:03:35,756 --> 00:03:39,800
I only aimed to drill his hat, Sheriff.
Just let out some hot air.

42
00:03:46,106 --> 00:03:48,192
Keep it there.

43
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,976
I think Mr Duncan would like
a crack at the governorship himself.

44
00:03:52,063 --> 00:03:54,846
Do you reckon Wyoming
will ever have a Governor...

45
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:57,628
who'll take a shot at a man
who doesn't wear a gun?

46
00:03:57,716 --> 00:04:02,283
No... or anyone who carries it
under cover either.

47
00:04:06,978 --> 00:04:11,631
- This is a big deal, Sheriff. You ought to step out of it.
- Everybody oughta.

48
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:15,936
I'm warning you men, this range is taken.
There's no room for squatters.

49
00:04:16,024 --> 00:04:19,502
- You started from scratch yourself, Duncan.
- That was a long time past.

50
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:21,981
For you! But we're just beginnin'!

51
00:04:22,068 --> 00:04:24,633
And we aim to start with mavericks,
and we aim to stay.

52
00:04:24,721 --> 00:04:27,939
You'll stay just so long
as you stay within the law.

53
00:04:28,026 --> 00:04:32,289
Which means that if I find any one of you
rounding up and branding cattle on my range...

54
00:04:32,376 --> 00:04:34,463
I have the right
to fill you full of lead.

55
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:38,289
Easy, boys, easy.

56
00:04:40,768 --> 00:04:44,987
A couple of you boys
have asked me if I had any ideas.

57
00:04:45,073 --> 00:04:47,682
Well, gentlemen...

58
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,596
here's one of my
biggest ideas right now.

59
00:05:16,818 --> 00:05:20,384
- Hello, Kate. How are you?
- Same as always, Jim.

60
00:05:20,428 --> 00:05:22,950
Measurements and... memory.

61
00:05:23,036 --> 00:05:26,124
Keep the measurements, forget
the memory. I'm gonna make it up to you.

62
00:05:26,211 --> 00:05:31,473
Folks, the newest and latest
scintillating gem to greet our fair town.

63
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,387
Is there anyone here so young who doesn't
recognize the name of Kate Maxwell?

64
00:05:40,258 --> 00:05:42,259
Hello, boys.

65
00:05:42,346 --> 00:05:44,563
Pleased to meet you."

66
00:05:51,825 --> 00:05:56,827
Boys, I never was any good at keeping
secrets from you, but I sure kept this one.

67
00:05:56,913 --> 00:05:59,044
That place of mine
I've been fixing up...

68
00:05:59,131 --> 00:06:01,828
well, it belongs to Kate
from here on in.

69
00:06:01,914 --> 00:06:04,175
There'll be music, high-kick dancing...

70
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:07,959
and the straightest card game in Wyoming.

71
00:06:08,046 --> 00:06:12,264
And you'll have money for it too!
Kate's a cattle buyer now.

72
00:06:12,308 --> 00:06:16,700
<i>She aims to buy up every maverick
you can lay a rope on, so bring 'em on in.</i>

73
00:06:16,786 --> 00:06:19,483
Kate's got her own brand,
and not an outlaw brand.

74
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,787
She'll market your mavericks for you,
and there's nothing...

75
00:06:21,874 --> 00:06:25,571
that Duncan and his
Cattlemen's Association can do about it.

76
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,571
What are you up to this time, Jim?

77
00:06:30,616 --> 00:06:32,920
I told you I was gonna make you rich.

78
00:06:33,007 --> 00:06:37,791
I don't suppose I've got to ask
my lawyer if this is legal?

79
00:06:37,878 --> 00:06:40,792
It's legal, Mr Duncan.
I've looked into it.

80
00:06:40,836 --> 00:06:45,445
Miss Maxwell, you've looked into it too?
It's liable to get you in some hot water.

81
00:06:45,532 --> 00:06:48,707
Why, I soak in hot water
every day, mister.

82
00:06:48,793 --> 00:06:51,664
It's good for the... complexion.

83
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,838
"I'm glad you're used to it...

84
00:06:54,925 --> 00:06:58,056
just in case any of those mavericks
"you take in trade come from my range.

85
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,056
<i>I'm just warning you.</i>

86
00:07:00,144 --> 00:07:03,535
<i>No animal on my property,
branded or not, is a stray.</i>

87
00:07:03,622 --> 00:07:06,319
Whatever you pick up
on the open range is yours.

88
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:09,885
Anything you take from me
has lead coming after it.

89
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,712
Suppose you and me
have a little talk, Mr Averell.

90
00:07:15,798 --> 00:07:19,321
Wait'll you find out
what this is all about.

91
00:07:19,408 --> 00:07:23,540
All right boys, take the coach
and the wagon over to Kate's Place.

92
00:07:33,497 --> 00:07:36,802
Boys, make room for the lady.

93
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:39,237
Oh, Kate, this is Stan Blaine...

94
00:07:39,324 --> 00:07:42,324
Sweetwater's strong arm of the law.

95
00:07:42,412 --> 00:07:44,674
Pleased to meet you, Sheriff.

96
00:07:44,761 --> 00:07:48,240
Why don't you show me the town
some night before you show me the jail?

97
00:07:50,283 --> 00:07:54,111
You talk like you dress...
but you don't feel that way.

98
00:07:56,764 --> 00:07:59,503
- Play along with him.
- Play?

99
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:02,808
He's just a drifter. Doesn't make
any trouble, doesn't want any.

100
00:08:02,894 --> 00:08:06,026
- The job was open, so he took it.
- Drifter?

101
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:09,418
Now, I... am a man with a purpose.

102
00:08:11,896 --> 00:08:14,288
Thank you.

103
00:08:18,202 --> 00:08:20,681
Mind if I give you a hand, miss?

104
00:08:20,768 --> 00:08:22,985
Why I'd be pleasured!

105
00:08:23,072 --> 00:08:25,942
I'll carry you!

106
00:08:28,073 --> 00:08:30,074
This one's a lady.

107
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:32,205
Why, thanks.

108
00:08:44,077 --> 00:08:47,511
Take a look, Kate. It's all yours.

109
00:08:47,598 --> 00:08:50,296
Not bad. In fact, pretty good.

110
00:08:50,383 --> 00:08:52,905
So why are you giving it away?

111
00:08:52,993 --> 00:08:56,905
Well, honey, I've got a sense of obligation.
I owe you something.

112
00:08:56,992 --> 00:08:59,645
Oh, the world must be coming to an end.

113
00:08:59,732 --> 00:09:02,950
Not only is Jim Averell
giving things away...

114
00:09:03,037 --> 00:09:05,559
but he's paying his debts.

115
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:09,473
Listen, Kate. A lot of things
have changed since I last saw you.

116
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,822
Since I last saw you...
running out of Abilene like a jackrabbit...

117
00:09:13,908 --> 00:09:17,736
- leaving me holding the sack.
- Did anybody get rough with you?

118
00:09:17,822 --> 00:09:21,475
Why? Will you go back there
and gun them down?

119
00:09:21,563 --> 00:09:26,041
Sorry, Jim, there's no money in it,
just a poor, underpaid judge.

120
00:09:26,128 --> 00:09:30,303
I guess somebody oughta give me
a necktie party for what I've done to you.

121
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,782
Maybe somebody will.

122
00:09:32,869 --> 00:09:36,739
But you came when I called you.
You didn't waste any time.

123
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,826
Birds of a feather.

124
00:09:38,914 --> 00:09:42,348
But that doesn't mean I'll ever feel
the same way about you.

125
00:09:42,435 --> 00:09:44,827
You will, honey. You will.

126
00:09:44,914 --> 00:09:48,089
Believe me, that last sour deal
is way behind me.

127
00:09:48,175 --> 00:09:51,916
I'm going up... up and up right into
the Governor's mansion.

128
00:09:52,003 --> 00:09:54,744
- To ask a pardon?
- To be the Governor!

129
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:59,440
I'm going to make the whole territory
of Wyoming my own private range.

130
00:09:59,527 --> 00:10:03,266
Think I can't do it? These settlers
would vote me into the White House.

131
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:06,484
I'm the only one around here
who'll promise them anything.

132
00:10:06,528 --> 00:10:10,312
- And what's in your way?
- Reece Duncan.

133
00:10:10,398 --> 00:10:13,225
I got a big front, but he is big.

134
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:19,009
Sounds crazy, but it's true. If Duncan goes,
I can be Governor of Wyoming.

135
00:10:19,095 --> 00:10:22,444
You will, of course,
drop in sometime for a drink.

136
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:26,575
And you'll be with me.
That's what I'm trying to tell you, Kate.

137
00:10:26,662 --> 00:10:29,967
I'm going to make up to you
for everything.

138
00:10:31,402 --> 00:10:33,489
What's this other thing about?

139
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:37,751
Why am I a cattle buyer?

140
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:41,665
You don't have to know anything
about cattle. Don't let that scare you.

141
00:10:41,752 --> 00:10:45,796
I know plenty.
I was riding a cow pony before I could walk.

142
00:10:45,883 --> 00:10:49,492
- What's the deal?
- Duncan again, but you don't have to know the details.

143
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:53,580
You just buy mavericks and sell 'em.
Look.

144
00:10:56,319 --> 00:11:00,973
Here's your brand, registered and legal.
Kate Maxwell.

145
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,453
K-Bar-M.

146
00:11:07,192 --> 00:11:11,019
Honey, it won't be long before people
are calling you "Cattle Kate."

147
00:11:22,456 --> 00:11:26,152
- These three for you, Tex.
- Good! Let's go.

148
00:11:33,849 --> 00:11:36,632
What'll it be, Tex? Chips or cash?

149
00:11:37,806 --> 00:11:41,154
Chips. Watch me double 'em.

150
00:11:49,243 --> 00:11:51,679
That's Duncan's brand, Wally.

151
00:11:51,765 --> 00:11:54,244
<i>Let it go.</i>

152
00:12:08,596 --> 00:12:12,510
Here's a maverick for you, Wally!
It's a clean one.

153
00:12:15,815 --> 00:12:18,467
"For value received, one maverick."

154
00:12:18,554 --> 00:12:21,076
What'll it be?

155
00:12:22,206 --> 00:12:24,164
Chips.

156
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:30,164
Horses comin', Matt.

157
00:12:36,296 --> 00:12:39,775
It's Duncan! I'll head him off.

158
00:13:17,043 --> 00:13:20,261
- What's the matter with you? That's a rustler!
- Matt Jessup?

159
00:13:20,348 --> 00:13:24,132
- I'm missing branded steers.
- The Jessup boys are taking mavericks.

160
00:13:24,219 --> 00:13:26,959
These weren't mavericks.
They carried the Bar-Double-Check.

161
00:13:27,045 --> 00:13:31,785
I don't say you didn't lose 'em.
There've been reports of strange faces.

162
00:13:31,872 --> 00:13:35,874
Sheriff, there's gonna be
a range war here.

163
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,656
I suggest you make up
"your mind whose side you're on.

164
00:13:38,744 --> 00:13:42,395
I have. I'm on the side
of the first man who gets killed.

165
00:13:46,527 --> 00:13:49,832
- I could knock him off right now.
- Why wait? - Naw.

166
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,050
Save us weeks of work and put that
loud-talking Duncan where Averell wants him.

167
00:13:54,137 --> 00:13:57,051
- I said no!
- Why not?

168
00:13:57,137 --> 00:14:00,225
'Cause Averell said
to let him burn a while.

169
00:14:01,878 --> 00:14:04,183
I told him to come after midnight.

170
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:06,400
After midnight? He better.

171
00:14:06,487 --> 00:14:09,532
He does what you say. This afternoon
he could've finished Duncan off easy...

172
00:14:09,618 --> 00:14:12,227
but he let him go because
that's what you wanted.

173
00:14:12,315 --> 00:14:14,707
I don't get it, boss.

174
00:14:14,794 --> 00:14:16,968
Abilene taught me something.

175
00:14:18,448 --> 00:14:20,752
To wait.

176
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:23,056
We set one side against the other.

177
00:14:23,144 --> 00:14:26,188
Prod 'em a little;
first Duncan, then the settlers.

178
00:14:26,274 --> 00:14:28,319
And wait till they kill each other off.

179
00:14:28,405 --> 00:14:30,623
That's the way to get
things done for you.

180
00:14:30,711 --> 00:14:33,406
In fact, that's the way
into the Governor's chair.

181
00:14:33,493 --> 00:14:36,060
How will that help you
to become Governor?

182
00:14:36,146 --> 00:14:40,798
Look, when times are rough, a man can
make himself a reputation overnight...

183
00:14:40,886 --> 00:14:43,713
that'll spread through
the whole territory like wildfire.

184
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,974
That's if he's on the popular side.

185
00:14:46,061 --> 00:14:49,104
And right now I've got these settlers
eating out of my hand.

186
00:14:49,192 --> 00:14:53,063
The way you got it figured,
there won't be any settlers left.

187
00:14:53,149 --> 00:14:55,715
Now, that'd be too bad.

188
00:14:55,802 --> 00:14:58,890
In that case, I'd have to take
the consolation prize...

189
00:14:58,976 --> 00:15:02,411
and all the cattle and
all the land in this valley.

190
00:15:02,499 --> 00:15:07,760
I might become one of the richest, most
important men in the territory of Wyoming.

191
00:15:07,848 --> 00:15:10,066
There's more than one way
to become Governor.

192
00:15:10,152 --> 00:15:14,588
- Does Kate know how you're running the cattle set-up?
- No!

193
00:15:14,674 --> 00:15:19,721
And nobody'll know if you and the boys
keep your mouths shut and do as I tell ya.

194
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,851
Understand?

195
00:15:21,937 --> 00:15:24,068
Yeah, boss.

196
00:15:54,074 --> 00:15:57,987
If I don't stand on 19,
my mind ain't on the cards.

197
00:15:58,075 --> 00:16:00,206
Friend of yours, Kate.

198
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,598
- Take over. I've got to talk to a customer.
- Go ahead.

199
00:16:07,685 --> 00:16:11,294
With Jim, I can at least
keep my eyes on the cards.

200
00:16:21,558 --> 00:16:25,125
Good evening, Sheriff. Drifting?

201
00:16:25,211 --> 00:16:28,081
Mmm! Got a nice, clean shave there.

202
00:16:28,168 --> 00:16:31,168
I bet it was for me.

203
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:35,561
You're keeping the boys busy,
roping by day and gambling at night.

204
00:16:35,648 --> 00:16:37,996
This is a free country.
They work hard for their money...

205
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,301
and they got a right to spend it
the way they want to.

206
00:16:40,388 --> 00:16:42,432
None of my business.

207
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:45,998
Just wonderin' where some of 'em
find time to do any rustling.

208
00:16:46,085 --> 00:16:49,433
Duncan's on the warpath.
Somebody's taking his branded stock.

209
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,695
Oh, he's just talkin'.
He's got to say that to stir up trouble.

210
00:16:53,781 --> 00:16:56,826
No, there's rustling going on.
Got it from the other ranchers.

211
00:16:58,652 --> 00:17:02,174
The cows I buy are clean,
unbranded mavericks.

212
00:17:02,262 --> 00:17:06,524
- You ever see a range war?
- There isn't going to be a range war here.

213
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:07,716
A few rustled cattle--

214
00:17:07,741 --> 00:17:11,481
A few rustled cattle started
the bloodiest killings in Texas.

215
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:16,916
- I was there.
- Oh, so that's where you hail from, Texas.

216
00:17:17,004 --> 00:17:18,612
Mm-hmm.

217
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:22,396
- What brought you here?
- Passin' through.

218
00:17:22,483 --> 00:17:26,918
- Oh, drifting.
- You don't like that.

219
00:17:29,702 --> 00:17:32,746
A man knows where he's going.

220
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:35,138
Take a look at Jim Averell.

221
00:17:35,225 --> 00:17:40,792
- There's a real man!
- I heard him say so.

222
00:17:40,878 --> 00:17:44,227
Kate, you've got a couple more mavericks
in your corral than you had.

223
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,792
- Thanks, Hal.
- Let's have a look.

224
00:17:46,879 --> 00:17:49,228
Is anything wrong with it?

225
00:17:49,314 --> 00:17:51,923
No.

226
00:17:53,358 --> 00:17:56,576
- Don't you ever forget that badge you're wearing?
- No.

227
00:17:56,663 --> 00:17:58,751
Feelin' lucky, Hal?

228
00:17:58,837 --> 00:18:01,664
No, I'd like it in cash. I'm saving.

229
00:18:01,752 --> 00:18:03,883
For any particular reason?

230
00:18:03,969 --> 00:18:08,100
- How'd you know?
- He means it, Kate.

231
00:18:08,144 --> 00:18:10,884
Aw, honey, they all mean it!

232
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:14,363
Here. One free drink
on the house and then get out.

233
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:17,450
I need the space for the free spenders.

234
00:18:19,276 --> 00:18:21,928
Since you're on duty tonight, Sheriff,
how 'bout coming out back...

235
00:18:22,016 --> 00:18:24,104
and letting me show you my stuff?

236
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:28,191
It's a nice moon out tonight.
Bright enough to read a brand.

237
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:33,628
Well, there they are.
Any of them look stolen?

238
00:18:33,715 --> 00:18:35,802
Nice lookin' stock.

239
00:18:35,889 --> 00:18:38,847
- And mavericks every one.
- Lots of 'em too.

240
00:18:38,933 --> 00:18:42,891
- Is that suspicious, doing business on a big scale?
- No.

241
00:18:42,977 --> 00:18:45,716
Every one of those cows
were taken off the free range.

242
00:18:45,761 --> 00:18:47,935
You don't have to spit fire at me.

243
00:18:48,022 --> 00:18:50,718
My word's good enough for everybody
else, it ought to be good enough for you.

244
00:18:50,805 --> 00:18:54,806
- It is.
- Then don't come with rumours of rustling and range wars.

245
00:18:54,893 --> 00:18:59,719
I'm a businesswoman giving the homesteaders
their first look at cash in two years.

246
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:04,502
- I don't want trouble!
- There's trouble in the range. You'll be in it along with us.

247
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:08,416
Not if I'm playing straight
and minding my own business.

248
00:19:08,504 --> 00:19:11,722
My pa minded his own business.

249
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:14,679
We had a small spread
down near Houston.

250
00:19:14,766 --> 00:19:16,940
When the trouble came,
he said he'd stay out of it.

251
00:19:17,027 --> 00:19:19,028
The range war "you were talking about?

252
00:19:19,114 --> 00:19:21,723
I was up in the barn
when the shootin' started.

253
00:19:21,811 --> 00:19:25,724
By the time I got down and ran for my rifle,
Pa was hanging on the corral fence.

254
00:19:25,812 --> 00:19:30,160
Ma was dead, lying in the front yard.

255
00:19:30,247 --> 00:19:33,508
- They killed my three brothers.
- Who killed them?

256
00:19:33,595 --> 00:19:36,247
Folks, neighbours...

257
00:19:36,335 --> 00:19:39,032
people who just got so mad
they started killin'.

258
00:19:39,118 --> 00:19:42,511
- How old were you then?
- Thirteen.

259
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,686
Thirteen? Your whole family?

260
00:19:45,772 --> 00:19:47,860
Is that when you started drifting?

261
00:19:47,903 --> 00:19:51,165
Drifting's not so bad.
A man sees a lot of country.

262
00:19:51,251 --> 00:19:53,382
Not anything he can call his own.

263
00:19:53,469 --> 00:19:56,079
Why own something if you don't need it?

264
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:59,687
What about marriage?

265
00:19:59,775 --> 00:20:02,384
Have you ever thought
about getting married?

266
00:20:02,471 --> 00:20:04,906
Some. You?

267
00:20:04,993 --> 00:20:08,429
<i>Kate, need you inside.</i>

268
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:14,734
We'll talk some more later, huh?

269
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:36,564
Someone's coming. Put that away.
We'll take care of him.

270
00:21:01,831 --> 00:21:06,527
It's the sheriff. Go get Averell.

271
00:21:06,614 --> 00:21:09,354
You were told not to show up
before midnight.

272
00:21:09,441 --> 00:21:11,528
In this business, you show up when
"you've got the goods.

273
00:21:11,615 --> 00:21:16,225
- How much did he see?
- There's no tellin'.

274
00:21:16,311 --> 00:21:18,747
- Get rid of him.
- For good?

275
00:21:18,834 --> 00:21:20,921
<i>Leave him alone.</i>

276
00:21:22,052 --> 00:21:24,965
Ever since that Abilene business...

277
00:21:25,052 --> 00:21:28,661
every time you get called out of a room,
I get an urge to follow you.

278
00:21:28,748 --> 00:21:31,618
- Now, what's this about?
- Nothing, honey.

279
00:21:31,706 --> 00:21:35,229
This drifter was interfering
in something private.

280
00:21:35,315 --> 00:21:39,881
As a drifter or as the sheriff?
And what jail did you boys break out of?

281
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:42,403
Do we take him or not?

282
00:21:42,491 --> 00:21:45,491
You leave him alone,
that's what you'll do!

283
00:21:45,578 --> 00:21:50,493
And I hope you're thinking up a good story,
Jim, because I'm getting awfully mad.

284
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,450
Don't.
You'll only come apologizing later.

285
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,754
He's nobody to be skittish about.

286
00:21:55,842 --> 00:21:58,755
Dump him where he'll have
a long walk back.

287
00:21:58,842 --> 00:22:01,016
How do I know they won't kill him?

288
00:22:01,103 --> 00:22:03,669
I wouldn't trust them
as far as I could throw a steer.

289
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:08,148
They do exactly as I tell them.
Get to it, men.

290
00:22:09,192 --> 00:22:12,322
You like him?

291
00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:16,063
No! There's no money
in that kind of maverick.

292
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:20,716
All right. Who are those men?

293
00:22:20,803 --> 00:22:24,542
It seems they were running
some cattle into your corral.

294
00:22:24,629 --> 00:22:26,803
- Whose cattle?
- Yours.

295
00:22:26,891 --> 00:22:29,282
Anyway, your brand.

296
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,804
There weren't that many here
a few minutes ago!

297
00:22:34,849 --> 00:22:37,414
That's what I'm trying to tell you, Kate.

298
00:22:37,501 --> 00:22:39,241
Look at this.

299
00:22:40,284 --> 00:22:43,415
Here's Reece Duncan's brand.

300
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:47,590
Bar-Double-Check.

301
00:22:47,677 --> 00:22:50,373
Now watch. This is clever.

302
00:22:58,201 --> 00:23:01,071
K-Bar-M.

303
00:23:03,811 --> 00:23:07,855
Katie, somebody's apt
to call you a cattle rustler.

304
00:23:07,942 --> 00:23:12,552
- Why you dirty, low-down-
- It takes money to run for office.

305
00:23:12,595 --> 00:23:16,204
You'll never be Governor.
You'll be crow bait on the end of a rope.

306
00:23:16,292 --> 00:23:19,336
I'm no rustler... but you are.

307
00:23:19,422 --> 00:23:22,597
This is your brand,
registered in your name.

308
00:23:22,684 --> 00:23:25,163
I don't share the business with you.
I gave it to you.

309
00:23:25,249 --> 00:23:29,686
You're the one who's been buying and selling
cattle. How do you get out of that?

310
00:23:29,772 --> 00:23:32,381
Wait till I tell Stan about this...
and Duncan!

311
00:23:32,468 --> 00:23:36,643
What if they don't believe you?
Pretty big risk, isn't it?

312
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:39,818
Jim, what are you up to?

313
00:23:39,905 --> 00:23:42,340
This isn't a big enough
operation for you.

314
00:23:42,427 --> 00:23:45,124
I've told you, we're going to
the Governor's mansion.

315
00:23:45,167 --> 00:23:48,428
It's going to take time
and a lot of money.

316
00:23:48,515 --> 00:23:52,472
And meanwhile,
"you'll keep your pretty mouth shut.

317
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:58,082
When I'm playing for high stakes,
I get awfully upset if anyone talks.

318
00:24:22,826 --> 00:24:24,783
Hi, Sheriff!

319
00:24:24,826 --> 00:24:27,784
Maybe you can teach
Knuckles how to ride. I give up.

320
00:24:27,871 --> 00:24:30,741
Come on, you stumblebum.

321
00:24:30,828 --> 00:24:32,742
- Where's Kate?
- Went riding.

322
00:24:32,829 --> 00:24:36,698
Come on, Knuckles! You're not going
to throw in the towel, are you?

323
00:24:36,786 --> 00:24:40,091
<i>I'll get a decision over you yet!</i>

324
00:24:48,744 --> 00:24:51,615
<i>Hold on tight, Knuckles!</i>

325
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:58,659
Come on, ya bum.

326
00:24:58,745 --> 00:25:01,399
Hi, everybody.

327
00:25:05,096 --> 00:25:08,096
You look like you came off second best.

328
00:25:08,184 --> 00:25:11,011
- Third!
- Bet you brought him in, though, whoever he was.

329
00:25:11,097 --> 00:25:13,315
- No, he's still kinda loose.
- But you will!

330
00:25:13,402 --> 00:25:18,142
- I aim to.
- You had a lot of stock in here last night. - Some.

331
00:25:18,229 --> 00:25:21,012
- How many head when we looked at them?
- Why?

332
00:25:21,098 --> 00:25:23,534
How many head this morning
before you got them out in such a hurry?

333
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:25,839
Putting together that question
and that tin badge...

334
00:25:25,926 --> 00:25:27,970
it looks like I'm accused
of being a rustler.

335
00:25:28,013 --> 00:25:32,319
Two minutes after you left last night,
some cattle came headin' for the corral.

336
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,536
Driven by my boys, of course!

337
00:25:34,623 --> 00:25:37,841
- Too dark to see that.
- But you did see them put cattle into my corral!

338
00:25:37,928 --> 00:25:42,015
- No, I got busy.
- So you've taken such a personal dislike to me...

339
00:25:42,103 --> 00:25:44,234
that without seeing anything,
without any proof...

340
00:25:44,321 --> 00:25:47,582
- you're willing to believe that I'm a rustler!
- I haven't taken a dislike to ya.

341
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:49,843
Sheriff, I go by actions,
not by words...

342
00:25:49,931 --> 00:25:52,104
and what I feel when you talk to me-

343
00:25:52,192 --> 00:25:57,105
- Why, I just feel as homely as a mud fence!
- Homely? You're the most-

344
00:26:02,281 --> 00:26:04,410
Women!

345
00:26:13,761 --> 00:26:18,111
- What did he say?
- I gave him a line. He won't be any trouble.

346
00:26:18,197 --> 00:26:22,111
That's why he has that job.
That's why I gave it to him.

347
00:26:22,198 --> 00:26:25,764
I took one look at him when he first
came into town and I said to myself...

348
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:28,591
"That's the kind of sheriff
I need: A drifter."

349
00:26:28,677 --> 00:26:32,505
I've got to hand it to you.
This time you're playing it smart, Jim.

350
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,114
It's nice to hear you say so...

351
00:26:35,157 --> 00:26:38,244
except I know you'd like
to see me break my neck.

352
00:26:38,332 --> 00:26:41,289
That would be nice.

353
00:26:41,332 --> 00:26:45,637
Oh, Katie, you're just ungrateful.
Makes me very unhappy.

354
00:26:45,724 --> 00:26:49,856
I don't like the way you operate.
You don't think of anyone but yourself.

355
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:52,073
What about the homesteaders
in this thing?

356
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,291
How long will it be before Duncan
starts taking it out on them?

357
00:26:55,378 --> 00:26:59,031
- What makes you think he'd do a thing like that?
- You're hoping he will.

358
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:02,988
- Why, Kate!
- You want trouble. You want a range war.

359
00:27:03,075 --> 00:27:07,032
You want so much killing that they'd
have to send troops in to keep the peace.

360
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,250
What an imagination!

361
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:12,077
Duncan killed, arrested,
or any way out of the running.

362
00:27:12,164 --> 00:27:16,339
And the homesteaders just about wiped
out and ready to listen to anybody.

363
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:18,513
And who steps up to lead them?

364
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,905
- Jim Averell, the poor man's hope.
- It's a good phrase.

365
00:27:22,992 --> 00:27:26,601
I don't want any part of this.
I'm getting out of here.

366
00:27:26,689 --> 00:27:29,559
You can't, Kate.

367
00:27:29,646 --> 00:27:31,602
How far could you get?

368
00:27:31,689 --> 00:27:34,647
It won't take Duncan long
to trace his cattle to your corral...

369
00:27:34,734 --> 00:27:37,126
and the sheriff to wire ahead.

370
00:27:37,213 --> 00:27:41,300
They don't just arrest you
for cattle rustling.

371
00:27:41,343 --> 00:27:43,822
Jim!

372
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:47,563
This act you're putting on about
not being interested in the sheriff.

373
00:27:47,649 --> 00:27:51,693
- Now you're imagining things.
- I hope so.

374
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:55,216
I'm jealous, honey.
Can't get angry with me for that.

375
00:27:55,303 --> 00:27:59,738
Sure, I want to be up there where
I know I belong, but I want you with me.

376
00:27:59,826 --> 00:28:02,130
I'm doing all of this for you, Katie.

377
00:28:02,217 --> 00:28:04,652
I'll prove that to you yet.

378
00:28:04,739 --> 00:28:07,914
But these things need time.

379
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,350
Yes, that's what we need... time.

380
00:28:27,397 --> 00:28:30,483
Get some of the boys
and fix that north line fence.

381
00:28:30,571 --> 00:28:32,919
We gotta keep the herds closer in.

382
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:36,050
Jiminy! Look what's coming.

383
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,747
<i>Good morning, Mr Duncan.</i>

384
00:28:44,834 --> 00:28:47,183
What brings you out in broad daylight?

385
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,835
I wouldn't mind sitting
in the shade for a while.

386
00:28:49,922 --> 00:28:52,049
I'd like to be polite, but
I have a lot of work to do.

387
00:28:52,375 --> 00:28:54,070
My business won't take long.

388
00:29:09,969 --> 00:29:13,361
Not much here to interest a woman.
It's a man's place.

389
00:29:13,449 --> 00:29:16,667
- Oh, that would interest a woman.
- Well, it hasn't.

390
00:29:16,753 --> 00:29:19,667
No wife? No womenfolk?

391
00:29:19,754 --> 00:29:23,539
- I'd have thought otherwise.
- I live alone.

392
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:25,843
Maybe that's why "you're so successful.

393
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:30,757
- Everything goes into one big ambition.
- "So far."

394
00:29:30,844 --> 00:29:33,757
Miss Maxwell, you said you had
something to talk to me about.

395
00:29:33,844 --> 00:29:35,888
I have: You.

396
00:29:35,975 --> 00:29:38,715
I think you're making a big mistake.

397
00:29:38,802 --> 00:29:43,846
No, it's your settler friends who are making
the mistake with your encouragement.

398
00:29:43,933 --> 00:29:47,717
Oh, now, Mr Duncan, "you're a fair man.

399
00:29:47,804 --> 00:29:51,631
Why don't you admit you started the
whole trouble by blacklisting their brands?

400
00:29:51,674 --> 00:29:55,066
If you came here thinking that by
being sweet to me and nice to look at...

401
00:29:55,152 --> 00:29:58,500
- I would become a more reasonable man-
- You are a reasonable man.

402
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:01,806
You've just never been
approached in the right way.

403
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:08,416
Miss Maxwell...

404
00:30:08,503 --> 00:30:12,243
I came to this territory as a boy,
a ragged trail hand...

405
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:15,461
without a penny in my pocket
and my boots open at the toes.

406
00:30:15,548 --> 00:30:20,026
In 10 years I owned or controlled most of this
valley. If you think I'm going to sit back now-

407
00:30:20,113 --> 00:30:23,419
Don't holler at me, Mr Duncan.

408
00:30:23,506 --> 00:30:27,768
If I made the mistake of thinking that
"you knew how to play for big stakes...

409
00:30:27,855 --> 00:30:29,725
I apologize.

410
00:30:29,812 --> 00:30:32,725
<i>I was wrong.</i>

411
00:30:32,813 --> 00:30:35,552
- What do you mean?
- I said I was wrong.

412
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,118
I thought you wanted to control
more than just this valley.

413
00:30:39,205 --> 00:30:41,205
Why don't you read the cards,
Mr Duncan?

414
00:30:41,292 --> 00:30:43,728
Before long, the settlers
will outnumber the cattlemen.

415
00:30:43,814 --> 00:30:46,293
It has to be that way.
There's nothing that can stop it.

416
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,859
Cooperate. Give them a chance
to earn an honest living...

417
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:52,643
and you'll be the most popular man
in the whole territory.

418
00:30:52,729 --> 00:30:56,469
They'll put you in
the Governor's mansion...

419
00:30:56,557 --> 00:30:59,209
not Jim Averell.

420
00:30:59,296 --> 00:31:03,557
What happened, Miss Maxwell?
You have an argument with him?

421
00:31:06,341 --> 00:31:10,863
Let's just say that I want
to be on the winning side.

422
00:31:10,951 --> 00:31:13,124
Suppose this turns out
to be the winning side?

423
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:16,125
What's in it for you?

424
00:31:16,168 --> 00:31:20,865
The winning side will be the one I tell
the settlers to throw their weight to.

425
00:31:20,952 --> 00:31:25,344
And I think I'll let you
fix the reward.

426
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:28,040
You sound like
a natural-born politician.

427
00:31:28,127 --> 00:31:30,388
It's all in knowing how to deal.

428
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:33,520
""Mr Duncan!"

429
00:31:33,607 --> 00:31:35,911
Mr Duncan!

430
00:31:35,999 --> 00:31:38,608
We caught the Jessup brothers
running off with some of our stock.

431
00:31:38,695 --> 00:31:42,695
We got 'em holed up the other side
of town in Pitchfork Canyon.

432
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:47,175
You expect me to throw in
with a bunch of outlaws?

433
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:23,833
I'll give you an example
of how a man gets rich.

434
00:32:23,921 --> 00:32:26,400
See that section there?

435
00:32:26,443 --> 00:32:30,053
If I buy that up, I'll control six others
around it because of the water on it.

436
00:32:30,139 --> 00:32:32,400
"It's all in knowing how.

437
00:32:32,487 --> 00:32:35,400
- You hear shooting?
- Yeah. It's over near Duncan's place.

438
00:32:35,488 --> 00:32:37,402
Let's go!

439
00:32:49,404 --> 00:32:51,492
I'm out of shells, Matt.

440
00:32:53,231 --> 00:32:56,145
Looks like we're gonna lose this one.

441
00:33:04,581 --> 00:33:07,191
Blast 'em outta there!

442
00:33:09,582 --> 00:33:11,583
Hold your fire!

443
00:33:11,669 --> 00:33:14,844
Better get down. You don't want
one of your own friends to shoot you.

444
00:33:14,931 --> 00:33:17,626
Drop it.

445
00:33:17,714 --> 00:33:19,714
I said drop it!

446
00:33:19,802 --> 00:33:23,107
You'd better learn to take orders
once in a while, Mr Duncan.

447
00:33:23,193 --> 00:33:25,889
Now start moving!

448
00:33:27,976 --> 00:33:30,151
Stop firin', men.

449
00:33:32,413 --> 00:33:35,022
I keep underratin' you, Miss Maxwell.

450
00:33:35,108 --> 00:33:37,717
I've got to stop that.

451
00:33:37,804 --> 00:33:39,805
Hal! Matt!

452
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:43,633
<i>Come out reaching!</i>

453
00:33:51,417 --> 00:33:53,809
Looks interesting.

454
00:33:53,895 --> 00:33:56,374
Keep me covered.

455
00:33:59,113 --> 00:34:01,505
- What's the story?
- They was rustling our cattle.

456
00:34:01,592 --> 00:34:05,201
- A lie! We found mavericks.
- They're not mavericks when they're on my land.

457
00:34:05,246 --> 00:34:08,116
- We didn't set foot on your land.
- He was comin' from that way.

458
00:34:08,203 --> 00:34:10,507
Were those mavericks part of
Duncan's stock or weren't they?

459
00:34:10,594 --> 00:34:12,638
- "Where's your proof?"
- I don't need proof.

460
00:34:12,725 --> 00:34:16,900
Them Jaspers were comin' from our herd,
and I know rustling when I see it.

461
00:34:16,986 --> 00:34:20,639
All you know is gunfighting. But if that's
what you want, you can have it now.

462
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:24,466
- But you'll have a dead boss.
- Simmer down, Wade.

463
00:34:24,553 --> 00:34:26,684
What do you want, Miss Maxwell?

464
00:34:26,771 --> 00:34:28,902
Have you still got your horses?

465
00:34:28,988 --> 00:34:32,902
All right, get on 'em and hightail it.

466
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:35,251
Don't move... anyone.

467
00:34:38,556 --> 00:34:39,556
What's this all about?

468
00:34:39,643 --> 00:34:42,730
Why, it's Mr Averell!
Glad to see you, Mr Averell.

469
00:34:42,818 --> 00:34:45,906
Miss Maxwell and I were talking
about you just a while ago.

470
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:47,950
That's nice. What did you say?

471
00:34:47,993 --> 00:34:52,255
Miss Maxwell did most of the talkin';
but I can see she didn't mean a word...

472
00:34:52,342 --> 00:34:56,777
saying she might tell the settlers
to throw in with me against you.

473
00:35:01,821 --> 00:35:05,605
You birds stick together all the way.

474
00:35:09,345 --> 00:35:12,954
I'll send this back to him.

475
00:35:13,042 --> 00:35:15,954
You won't want to be seeing him again.

476
00:35:18,521 --> 00:35:21,000
Evenin', boys. Myra?

477
00:35:22,042 --> 00:35:24,130
We're short-handed.

478
00:35:24,218 --> 00:35:27,696
What am I? A marriage bureau?

479
00:35:27,783 --> 00:35:30,305
Every time I get a dancer trained,
I lose her.

480
00:35:30,393 --> 00:35:32,392
You're sure going to lose this one.

481
00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:35,654
You know what you're doing, Myra?

482
00:35:35,742 --> 00:35:39,393
I want to see a preacher in this, Hal,
or I'm gonna get after you with a.44.

483
00:35:39,481 --> 00:35:42,220
We're gettin' married as soon as
I get more maverick money.

484
00:35:42,308 --> 00:35:45,265
See that you hide it from him
when he celebrates.

485
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:56,658
- Been here long?
- Settin'.

486
00:35:56,746 --> 00:35:59,182
Can I "set" with you?

487
00:35:59,268 --> 00:36:01,312
Set.

488
00:36:03,486 --> 00:36:06,139
- What do you think?
- Nice team.

489
00:36:08,313 --> 00:36:11,139
- Is there going to be trouble hereabouts?
- Mm-hmm.

490
00:36:11,227 --> 00:36:13,575
- Killing?
- Can't tell.

491
00:36:13,661 --> 00:36:16,271
There's something queer going on.

492
00:36:16,358 --> 00:36:19,706
Got another report of
strange faces in the hills.

493
00:36:19,794 --> 00:36:24,403
Got another complaint from
Duncan about losing cows.

494
00:36:24,489 --> 00:36:29,230
- What'd you see him about today?
- I was trying to make peace.

495
00:36:29,317 --> 00:36:32,622
- How?
- I wanted him to look at this whole thing sensibly.

496
00:36:32,708 --> 00:36:35,101
He thinks he's being sensible right now.

497
00:36:35,187 --> 00:36:39,536
- I thought maybe a woman's approach-
- A woman's approach?

498
00:36:39,624 --> 00:36:42,537
A gun in the back?

499
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:46,798
- So you know the whole story?
- I know you didn't do peace any good today.

500
00:36:46,886 --> 00:36:51,060
What did you expect me to do? Let him
shoot down the Jessup boys or hang them?

501
00:36:51,146 --> 00:36:55,147
Listen, Jim Averell brought you
out here and set you up in business.

502
00:36:55,235 --> 00:36:59,193
- Everything you do is tied in with him. Duncan hates Averell.
- No, you've-

503
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,455
When you held that gun in his back,
it was being held by Jim Averell...

504
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:04,759
who's lying to the settlers,
cattlemen, and...

505
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:08,150
- for all I know, lying to you.
- That's what I want to talk to you about.

506
00:37:08,238 --> 00:37:10,238
Those men are building for a fight...

507
00:37:10,326 --> 00:37:13,804
and it won't take but one wrong move
to touch it off, set the range on fire!

508
00:37:13,892 --> 00:37:16,414
Will you listen to me?
I'm not Jim Averell's woman.

509
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:19,936
I choose my own man, whoever he is
or whatever he is, kingpin or drifter.

510
00:38:01,945 --> 00:38:06,032
It's a little early to tell anything yet.
He's a bit low.

511
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:08,424
- Any news?
- We lost him in the dark.

512
00:38:08,511 --> 00:38:11,208
- Spent the whole night combing the hills.
- It's a waste of time!

513
00:38:11,294 --> 00:38:13,685
I know where to go for the bushwhacker.

514
00:38:13,772 --> 00:38:16,990
Duncan or one of his boys shot my brother.
Now it's my turn.

515
00:38:17,078 --> 00:38:19,296
And then it's Duncan's turn,
and whose turn after that?

516
00:38:19,382 --> 00:38:22,079
It's the way feuds get started,
and there's no telling where it will end.

517
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:26,253
I believe in law and order myself, Sheriff,
but there's also a thing called justice.

518
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,557
And I'm dealing some out.

519
00:38:28,645 --> 00:38:32,168
The law didn't appoint you to do that,
Matt. Don't make me put you in jail.

520
00:38:32,254 --> 00:38:34,907
Stan, you're holding with Duncan.
The boys ain't gonna like it.

521
00:38:34,994 --> 00:38:39,039
You just sit down and cool off.
Don't try to jump a gun. It never works.

522
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:45,257
<i>Matt can always get another gun, and
Duncan always gives us another reason.</i>

523
00:38:45,344 --> 00:38:49,735
There's a war ahead, Sheriff.
You figure to stop it all by yourself?

524
00:38:49,822 --> 00:38:53,345
- Not if some folks want it.
- I say wipe out Duncan and his whole outfit.

525
00:38:53,433 --> 00:38:56,519
- It's the only thing that makes sense.
- "You talk too much."

526
00:38:56,606 --> 00:39:00,911
It seems to me that all men
want to do is fight...

527
00:39:00,998 --> 00:39:05,304
even when they talk about peace...
like you!

528
00:39:05,392 --> 00:39:08,306
It's with a gun in their hands!

529
00:39:08,392 --> 00:39:12,914
It's high time women took a hand
in running this world.

530
00:39:13,002 --> 00:39:16,437
Duncan and his men run
the Cattle Association.

531
00:39:16,525 --> 00:39:19,873
The homesteaders are mad
because he keeps them out in the cold.

532
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,221
Very well.
Let's form an association of our own!

533
00:39:23,308 --> 00:39:27,308
Sure!
Our own outfit to do business for us!

534
00:39:30,005 --> 00:39:33,180
That's for being the brainiest woman
I've ever met.

535
00:39:34,615 --> 00:39:38,267
Boys, Kate just had a great idea.

536
00:39:38,354 --> 00:39:42,659
It's the answer to everything. We'll form
our own stockmen's corporation.

537
00:39:42,746 --> 00:39:47,095
We'll register our brands with it,
find buyers who'll deal with us.

538
00:39:47,181 --> 00:39:50,965
If the courts try to stop us, we'll have
an organization to fight back with.

539
00:39:51,052 --> 00:39:54,922
Jim, please. You're not a cattle raiser.
This has nothing to do with you.

540
00:39:55,009 --> 00:39:58,532
Of course, this will all take money.
And it'll need leadership.

541
00:39:58,575 --> 00:40:00,576
I'm going to advance you the money.

542
00:40:00,663 --> 00:40:03,489
I want all you people
in this territory to know...

543
00:40:03,576 --> 00:40:07,054
that Jim Averell is with you...
all the way.

544
00:40:07,142 --> 00:40:09,794
Get the boys together.

545
00:40:09,881 --> 00:40:12,797
Better pick your side, Sheriff.

546
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,883
Smartest girl I ever knew.

547
00:40:21,015 --> 00:40:24,016
You make good partners,
"you and Averell.

548
00:40:24,103 --> 00:40:26,189
What one thinks of
is good for the other.

549
00:40:26,277 --> 00:40:30,016
I didn't want him to be part of this.
He took it out of my hands.

550
00:40:30,103 --> 00:40:33,148
Played right into Duncan's.

551
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:51,238
This is what we needed for a long time.

552
00:40:58,891 --> 00:41:03,501
Kramer, you and Tiny Peterson
start bringing 'em in from the north range.

553
00:41:03,588 --> 00:41:07,110
O'Conners, Stubbs,
handle the west range.

554
00:41:07,197 --> 00:41:11,024
Andrews, Elliot, Lamont-

555
00:41:22,506 --> 00:41:25,941
Hey, Matt, you wouldn't want the men
to ride out in the sun...

556
00:41:26,027 --> 00:41:28,289
without something to line their throats,
would you?

557
00:41:28,376 --> 00:41:32,116
- Where's Averell?
- I don't know. He left ahead of us.

558
00:41:32,202 --> 00:41:35,377
Kinda slow for a man
so anxious to help.

559
00:41:35,465 --> 00:41:38,160
<i>All right, men,
we got plenty of work ahead.</i>

560
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:45,988
- Got it?
- Couldn't you wait?

561
00:41:46,075 --> 00:41:48,988
Sure.

562
00:41:49,075 --> 00:41:52,554
But not the boys.
They like to be paid as they go along.

563
00:41:54,729 --> 00:41:59,207
It seems to me you go to an awful lot
of trouble just to start a shootin' war.

564
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:03,166
We could do the same thing by nightfall
by riding out and throwing a little lead.

565
00:42:03,252 --> 00:42:07,644
Mm-hmm. That's why it's a good idea
for you to do exactly as I say...

566
00:42:07,731 --> 00:42:10,471
no more, no less.

567
00:42:20,213 --> 00:42:23,474
- Good coffee.
- Makes the best coffee in the whole dang world.

568
00:42:23,561 --> 00:42:26,040
Learned it from Kate.
There's someone who can cook.

569
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:29,693
Tell him some more.
I need all the recommendations I can get.

570
00:42:29,779 --> 00:42:31,649
Here comes Averell with the tally book.

571
00:42:37,434 --> 00:42:39,998
Where have you been?
We've been waiting for the tally book.

572
00:42:40,086 --> 00:42:43,782
The horse threw his shoe.
We had to stop at the blacksmith's.

573
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:57,655
What's the matter, Sheriff?
Don't you believe me?

574
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:00,524
Just looking at the white stuff.

575
00:43:00,612 --> 00:43:03,089
What about it?

576
00:43:03,177 --> 00:43:06,786
You come by way of Salt Lick Canyon.
Long way around, wasn't it?

577
00:43:06,873 --> 00:43:09,613
I said, what about it?

578
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,352
Nothing about it. Relax.

579
00:43:12,439 --> 00:43:15,397
Here comes the first bunch!

580
00:43:21,876 --> 00:43:24,616
- Duncan showed up yet?
- He'll be here.

581
00:43:24,703 --> 00:43:27,095
Sandy, you just standin' around?

582
00:43:27,182 --> 00:43:31,009
- "I need an extra man to look for strays."
- I work for Jim Averell.

583
00:43:31,096 --> 00:43:33,313
You'll work in this camp
or you don't eat.

584
00:43:33,357 --> 00:43:36,401
There's no grub to spare for gunslingers.

585
00:43:39,706 --> 00:43:40,837
I'll help you, Matt.

586
00:43:40,923 --> 00:43:43,185
I said a man to look for strays!

587
00:43:43,272 --> 00:43:45,663
Oh, I was cuttin' cattle
long before I cut cards!

588
00:43:45,751 --> 00:43:47,794
Get me a horse, something alive!

589
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:49,838
Tom!

590
00:43:57,318 --> 00:43:58,274
Thank you.

591
00:43:58,362 --> 00:44:01,232
I wouldn't get on that critter, Kate.
It ain't safe!

592
00:44:15,974 --> 00:44:18,365
Kate!

593
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:31,586
Bet she'd be real handy on a homestead.

594
00:45:30,293 --> 00:45:34,468
- Round-up could be finished before Duncan shows up.
- Not likely.

595
00:45:34,511 --> 00:45:36,903
Trouble is, I hold with the settlers
instead of him.

596
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:39,730
- Makes it pretty hard being sheriff.
- It'll get harder all the time.

597
00:45:39,817 --> 00:45:43,861
- Duncan's not the kind who gives up.
- Maybe I am.

598
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:46,861
I didn't figure on this kind of thing
when I took this job.

599
00:45:46,949 --> 00:45:49,340
I didn't figure on being Duncan's man...

600
00:45:49,428 --> 00:45:52,037
running around arresting homesteaders.

601
00:45:52,123 --> 00:45:57,341
Seems to me the best thing I can do
is turn in my badge and move on.

602
00:45:57,429 --> 00:46:00,038
- Where would you go?
- Yonder.

603
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:03,517
Yonder! Always yonder.

604
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:06,517
That's no life for a man.

605
00:46:06,604 --> 00:46:09,518
Haven't you ever thought about
sending down roots?

606
00:46:09,604 --> 00:46:13,345
- Staying in one place for a while?
- Reckon so...

607
00:46:15,084 --> 00:46:17,823
when I find what I want.

608
00:46:17,911 --> 00:46:20,607
What do you want?

609
00:46:26,608 --> 00:46:30,566
When Duncan hears how many
mavericks we rounded up...

610
00:46:33,827 --> 00:46:36,784
he's gonna get a real bellyache.

611
00:46:49,178 --> 00:46:50,961
<i>Bar-VRanch, one calf.</i>

612
00:46:53,005 --> 00:46:55,441
Duncan's comin' up Loma Pass!

613
00:46:57,702 --> 00:47:00,702
Get your girls into that tent,
and get in with 'em. Stay under cover.

614
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:03,094
- But I want to be out here.
- Get into the tent!

615
00:47:03,181 --> 00:47:06,442
<i>Off your horses, boys, and into place.
You know what to do.</i>

616
00:47:06,529 --> 00:47:08,312
Get every horse outta camp!

617
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,704
If there's any trouble,
they'll only be in the way.

618
00:47:10,791 --> 00:47:14,052
Step lively, everybody!
He's on the other side of the hill.

619
00:47:23,315 --> 00:47:25,576
Wade, hold the men up here.

620
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:41,492
I don't know how far you thought
"you'd go with this fool idea, Averell...

621
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:43,841
but it comes to an end right now.

622
00:47:44,799 --> 00:47:46,016
Where's that sheriff?

623
00:47:49,016 --> 00:47:51,320
Here's a complaint
signed by Judge Crawford...

624
00:47:51,408 --> 00:47:54,495
to the effect that these men
are defying the Maverick Law.

625
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,670
<i>Serve it.</i>

626
00:48:00,888 --> 00:48:03,931
Seems all regular and in order.

627
00:48:04,019 --> 00:48:08,150
Well, Sheriff, I just happen to have
a Federal injunction...

628
00:48:08,238 --> 00:48:11,411
enjoining these men from interfering
with this round-up...

629
00:48:11,498 --> 00:48:13,542
in any manner, shape or form.

630
00:48:13,629 --> 00:48:16,369
Will you serve it, please?

631
00:48:21,457 --> 00:48:23,413
Looks like a stand-off.

632
00:48:25,632 --> 00:48:29,589
That Jim Averell!
Did anybody ever outsmart him?

633
00:48:29,676 --> 00:48:33,763
If Duncan doesn't win by brains,
he'll win another way.

634
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:36,503
Here it comes. Keep back.

635
00:48:38,068 --> 00:48:40,547
That's a pretty clever trick,
Mr Averell.

636
00:48:40,634 --> 00:48:43,331
<i>I'm surprised at myself
not figurin'on that.</i>

637
00:48:43,417 --> 00:48:46,113
I've had it in my pocket
for a couple of days...

638
00:48:46,201 --> 00:48:48,114
<i>just waiting for you to show up.</i>

639
00:48:48,201 --> 00:48:52,159
Cancelling out my court order doesn't
cancel out my rights as a rancher.

640
00:48:52,247 --> 00:48:55,072
You don't know of any way
to stop me from stayin' here...

641
00:48:55,116 --> 00:48:59,509
- and keeping an eye peeled for my own stock?
- I wouldn't wanna stop ya.

642
00:48:59,595 --> 00:49:03,901
Get a little nervous, though,
lookin' at all that artillery.

643
00:49:06,118 --> 00:49:08,379
That's why we brought it here.

644
00:49:08,466 --> 00:49:11,467
You won't need it here.

645
00:49:11,554 --> 00:49:14,467
Pick 'em up.

646
00:49:14,554 --> 00:49:17,554
Duncan, tell your boys
to drop their guns off over in Kate's wagon.

647
00:49:17,642 --> 00:49:19,555
I've got an idea they wouldn't do that.

648
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:22,295
I'm tellin' ya they will.

649
00:49:22,382 --> 00:49:24,295
Never had so many deputies before.

650
00:49:28,775 --> 00:49:32,036
<i>Look over there.</i>

651
00:49:32,123 --> 00:49:34,167
<i>I've got more, but you can't see 'em.</i>

652
00:49:34,254 --> 00:49:36,863
Gentlemen, peace is declared.

653
00:49:36,949 --> 00:49:38,516
What about them?

654
00:49:38,602 --> 00:49:43,777
All right, everybody! Over at Kate's wagon,
and drop off your hardware.

655
00:49:43,865 --> 00:49:46,952
<i>You deputies too!</i>

656
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,171
All right, men,
drop your guns in the wagon.

657
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:15,218
Hey, Duncan?

658
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:19,175
Cut out a bunch of your cows a while ago.
You want the calves branded?

659
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:21,872
I'll take that as a favour.

660
00:50:25,307 --> 00:50:26,177
Where's its mother?

661
00:50:26,264 --> 00:50:28,916
Got separated somehow.

662
00:50:29,004 --> 00:50:31,613
- How do you know this one doesn't belong to me?
- We don't...

663
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:35,614
Half for you and half for us.

664
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:39,180
- Can you think of anything better?
- That's fair enough.

665
00:50:42,484 --> 00:50:45,093
- Acts just like you when you won't listen to reason.
- Oh?

666
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:47,747
If you'd settle down
and talk things over...

667
00:50:47,833 --> 00:50:52,052
- you might find there's room enough here for all of us.
- Could be.

668
00:50:53,617 --> 00:50:57,095
You're the prettiest little maverick
I ever did see!

669
00:50:57,183 --> 00:50:59,272
How 'bout lettin' me
put my brand on ya?

670
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:01,489
Thanks. I'm wearing one already.

671
00:51:01,576 --> 00:51:05,360
You gotta get used to sudden changes.

672
00:51:08,012 --> 00:51:10,055
Hey!"

673
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:23,798
Get outta here!

674
00:51:23,884 --> 00:51:26,493
Stop it! Stop it!

675
00:51:46,932 --> 00:51:48,193
What's the idea?

676
00:52:04,762 --> 00:52:07,198
Stampede! Stampede!

677
00:52:10,286 --> 00:52:12,415
Mount up and head 'em off!

678
00:52:41,203 --> 00:52:42,943
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

679
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:07,599
Whoa! Whoa!

680
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:11,210
Whoa! Whoa!

681
00:53:12,819 --> 00:53:15,341
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

682
00:53:27,257 --> 00:53:29,213
Duncan!

683
00:53:29,301 --> 00:53:32,213
Get your men together and clear out.
We've had enough trouble here.

684
00:53:32,301 --> 00:53:34,432
Nobody talks to me like that.

685
00:53:34,519 --> 00:53:37,476
That's a Federal court order
talking to you like that.

686
00:53:37,562 --> 00:53:40,129
You better go.

687
00:53:40,216 --> 00:53:43,389
Call the men in.
Tell them I've gone back to the ranch.

688
00:53:45,608 --> 00:53:48,913
- Can you finish this round-up in one more day?
- There's a chance.

689
00:53:48,999 --> 00:53:51,522
Well, then, get movin'.

690
00:54:15,396 --> 00:54:18,005
Well, there's the last one.

691
00:54:18,093 --> 00:54:20,527
Round-up's over.

692
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:27,834
- How's the round-up?
- It's over. Your men standing by?

693
00:54:27,921 --> 00:54:31,225
Yeah. When do we move?
Averell will give us the word.

694
00:54:59,709 --> 00:55:03,145
Hi, Maverick.
How goes it with law and order?

695
00:55:03,231 --> 00:55:06,232
- Not much change.
- There never is any change with you.

696
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:09,668
Don't you ever sing or dance,
or feel like kickin' up your heels?

697
00:55:09,754 --> 00:55:11,885
Come on. Dance with me.

698
00:55:11,972 --> 00:55:14,016
I wish I knew what to think about you.

699
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:16,930
If I ride off, it'll be too late.

700
00:55:17,016 --> 00:55:19,496
Still talking about going away?

701
00:55:19,583 --> 00:55:23,322
About ready to turn in
my badge and saddle up.

702
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:27,063
What's holding you back?

703
00:55:27,106 --> 00:55:29,150
Nothin', I reckon.

704
00:55:29,237 --> 00:55:33,194
I hope it turns out
to be as green as you think-

705
00:55:33,238 --> 00:55:37,238
the grass on... the other side of the fence."

706
00:55:37,325 --> 00:55:39,935
Hold still, everybody!

707
00:55:40,022 --> 00:55:42,848
Just stay like that and
there won't be any trouble.

708
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:51,762
I'm takin' you to
the marshal at Rawlins.

709
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:54,850
- What for?
- For rustling cattle...

710
00:55:54,937 --> 00:55:58,112
- and murdering my foreman, Wade Burrows.
- That's ridiculous!

711
00:55:58,199 --> 00:56:00,286
- What are you trying to start here?
- Keep out of this, Averell.

712
00:56:00,373 --> 00:56:04,200
I'm in this all the way,
and you better have plenty of evidence.

713
00:56:04,287 --> 00:56:08,462
There's enough evidence
to hang her six times over.

714
00:56:08,549 --> 00:56:10,941
Come out to the corral.

715
00:56:15,811 --> 00:56:18,289
<i>Found him out on the range
near my north section...</i>

716
00:56:18,376 --> 00:56:22,944
<i>stretched out near a brandin'fire
with two holes in his back.</i>

717
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:25,205
They never gave him a chance.

718
00:56:25,291 --> 00:56:28,509
Wade Burrows was a troublemaker.
It just caught up with him.

719
00:56:28,596 --> 00:56:32,858
- What's the connection with Kate?
- I'll show you right now.

720
00:56:32,946 --> 00:56:35,728
Every time I complained to you
about losin' branded cattle...

721
00:56:35,816 --> 00:56:41,034
"you'd talk about strange faces in the hills,
and rustlers nobody ever sees.

722
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,121
I'll show ya some rustlers.

723
00:56:47,252 --> 00:56:50,991
That's my brand, the Bar-Double-Check.

724
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:54,166
<i>When we picked up Wade,
there was a brandin'iron under him.</i>

725
00:56:54,254 --> 00:56:56,167
<i>I reckon the killers forgot that.</i>

726
00:56:56,254 --> 00:56:59,342
Here's the iron.

727
00:56:59,428 --> 00:57:01,603
And here's what it does.

728
00:57:04,516 --> 00:57:06,908
<i>K- Bar-M.</i>

729
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:12,126
I'm takin' you in on suspicion
of rustlin' and murder.

730
00:57:12,213 --> 00:57:16,475
The sheriff's office is still filled, Duncan.
Don't try to do my job.

731
00:57:16,561 --> 00:57:19,693
- This woman is goin' to jail!
- "But I'll do the takin'."

732
00:57:19,779 --> 00:57:23,389
I trust you, Duncan, but you got
a vigilante look in your eye.

733
00:57:23,475 --> 00:57:26,911
He'd put a rope around her neck
as soon as they got out of sight.

734
00:57:26,998 --> 00:57:29,304
Don't worry, honey.
I'll get you the best...

735
00:57:29,391 --> 00:57:32,523
legal representation in
the territory of Wyoming.

736
00:57:32,609 --> 00:57:34,522
By the time these charges are heard...

737
00:57:34,609 --> 00:57:37,436
<i>Mr Duncan'll have to eat a lot of words.</i>

738
00:57:37,479 --> 00:57:41,176
- Am I right, boys?
- "You bet."

739
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:45,394
Your deputies must be tired
after the round-up...

740
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:48,655
so I know you'll be glad
if I post some of my men at the jail...

741
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:51,177
to see she doesn't get away.

742
00:57:56,092 --> 00:57:59,962
There'll be more in jail when I found out
which of ya have been takin' orders from her.

743
00:58:03,224 --> 00:58:06,355
You haven't said a word
for the last 15 minutes.

744
00:58:06,442 --> 00:58:09,399
You used to find it easy to talk.
Why not now?

745
00:58:09,485 --> 00:58:12,617
Talking to you never helped me before.

746
00:58:12,703 --> 00:58:14,747
What's the truth, Kate?

747
00:58:14,834 --> 00:58:17,226
Is Averell playin' you,
or are you both playin' me?

748
00:58:17,313 --> 00:58:21,618
Things were bad enough in this town
before you came. They're twice as bad now.

749
00:58:21,705 --> 00:58:24,357
You think I'm a murderer and a rustler?

750
00:58:24,445 --> 00:58:27,706
I don't know what to think.

751
00:58:27,793 --> 00:58:30,707
What's between you and Averell?

752
00:58:34,056 --> 00:58:36,230
Too much.

753
00:58:54,625 --> 00:58:56,712
Keep your eyes peeled for trouble.

754
00:58:56,799 --> 00:59:00,670
Want these gents barbecued
or slow-fried?

755
00:59:00,756 --> 00:59:04,236
Don't get the idea
"you're deputies, boys.

756
00:59:04,322 --> 00:59:08,236
Anything happens to her,
"you'll pay for it.

757
00:59:17,063 --> 00:59:18,977
You might as well catch 40 winks.

758
00:59:19,064 --> 00:59:22,587
- Tomorrow could be a big day.
- I'll stay here.

759
00:59:22,674 --> 00:59:27,022
- You can't help her. She's locked up.
- I'll stay here!

760
00:59:33,936 --> 00:59:36,720
Kinda wondered why he wasn't around.

761
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:38,895
<i>I wouldn't put it past Reece Duncan...</i>

762
00:59:38,982 --> 00:59:41,808
<i>to kill one of his own men
and pin it on us.</i>

763
00:59:41,895 --> 00:59:44,896
What his second move will be,
I can only guess.

764
00:59:44,983 --> 00:59:47,765
L-I'm too busy thinking about Kate...

765
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:50,114
sitting over in that jail.

766
00:59:52,898 --> 00:59:56,289
Seems to me we got nothing to go
on but her own word that she's innocent.

767
00:59:59,073 --> 01:00:02,812
- We brought in 300 unbranded mavericks...
- How did it work?

768
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:06,248
Fine. She was so surprised
she couldn't say a word.

769
01:00:06,335 --> 01:00:08,249
<i>Go back and tell 'em to get set.</i>

770
01:00:08,335 --> 01:00:11,945
<i>You'll see the signal as soon
as it's light enough to see smoke.</i>

771
01:00:12,031 --> 01:00:15,118
There isn't much hay over there.
You'd better drag over another bale.

772
01:00:15,206 --> 01:00:18,250
Go on.

773
01:00:18,336 --> 01:00:22,860
I say Kate had nothin' to do with it.
She's innocent as a newborn babe!

774
01:00:22,946 --> 01:00:26,425
All right. If nobody'll back me up
to bust her outta that jail...

775
01:00:26,469 --> 01:00:29,557
- I'll do it myself.
- I don't think you'll have time.

776
01:00:29,644 --> 01:00:32,252
Boys, I just got some pretty bad news.

777
01:00:32,339 --> 01:00:35,557
Sandy tells me Duncan's calling in
every man he's got.

778
01:00:35,644 --> 01:00:40,080
He's getting set for a fight,
and he'll find a good reason to start one.

779
01:00:40,167 --> 01:00:42,472
I'm going out there
and try and talk him out of it.

780
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:46,909
- I never heard of Duncan bein' talked out of anything.
- Maybe so.

781
01:00:46,995 --> 01:00:51,953
At least it'll give you men a chance
to get organized for a battle.

782
01:01:27,872 --> 01:01:30,569
See that nothin' happens to her.

783
01:01:34,221 --> 01:01:39,091
As miserable a collection of faces
as ever I seen off a reward poster.

784
01:01:39,178 --> 01:01:42,657
What kind of records did you gents have
before you went to work for Duncan?

785
01:01:42,744 --> 01:01:45,832
Smart aleck! Don't pay him no heed.

786
01:01:47,921 --> 01:01:51,921
All right, men! Come and get it!

787
01:01:52,008 --> 01:01:55,747
That's real cordial, but kinda sudden.

788
01:01:55,835 --> 01:01:58,053
<i>See who's outside.</i>

789
01:01:58,096 --> 01:02:00,270
How do you like that?
They got suspicions.

790
01:02:00,357 --> 01:02:02,793
I've got a good mind
to spill this stuff on the floor.

791
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:14,012
Quiet outside, but I'm kinda dry inside.
Gimme some of that!

792
01:02:14,099 --> 01:02:18,317
Just a minute.
I kinda changed my mind about you fellas.

793
01:02:18,404 --> 01:02:21,144
- Gimme some of that beer, sonny.
- Sonny?

794
01:02:21,231 --> 01:02:24,319
I'm gonna like this!

795
01:02:31,233 --> 01:02:33,842
Nice work, Knuckles. Pick him up.

796
01:02:33,928 --> 01:02:36,364
You got me covered.

797
01:02:40,364 --> 01:02:42,670
Hey, ain't this somethin'? Ajailbreak!
We're bustin' ya outta here.

798
01:02:42,757 --> 01:02:44,931
- Who organized it?
- We did. The sheriff's outta town.

799
01:02:44,974 --> 01:02:46,931
Jim's ridin' up to Duncan's ranch.

800
01:02:46,974 --> 01:02:51,279
Jim found out Duncan's gettin' ready
for a fight. He's gonna try and stop him.

801
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:55,021
- Don't you believe it!
- In ya go!

802
01:02:55,107 --> 01:02:58,239
He doesn't want to stop a war.
He wants to start one.

803
01:02:58,325 --> 01:03:00,848
Boys, I think it's about time
"you knew the truth.

804
01:03:00,934 --> 01:03:03,109
I've been covering up
for Jim Averell in one of...

805
01:03:03,195 --> 01:03:06,109
the slickest rustling schemes
Wyoming ever saw.

806
01:03:06,197 --> 01:03:09,110
And the idea back of the whole thing
is to start you...

807
01:03:09,197 --> 01:03:11,676
<i>and the big cattle raisers
to killing each other off.</i>

808
01:03:11,762 --> 01:03:14,894
I told you she mightn't be innocent.

809
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:17,459
You didn't finish.
We're still listenin'.

810
01:03:17,546 --> 01:03:19,938
Jim's got a bunch of gunslingers
up in the hills.

811
01:03:20,025 --> 01:03:24,243
And one of them, or Sandy, killed Wade
Burrows to pin the whole thing on me...

812
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:26,504
<i>and start this big range war
that he wants.</i>

813
01:03:26,591 --> 01:03:29,896
He sure did pin it on ya. How many times
that brandin' iron been used?

814
01:03:29,984 --> 01:03:34,462
I don't know, but the important thing is
he wants to start a range war.

815
01:03:34,549 --> 01:03:38,506
Boys, I know Jim Averell and you don't.
He wants to be Governor.

816
01:03:38,594 --> 01:03:41,942
He doesn't care how many people he
walks over to get to the Governor's chair...

817
01:03:41,986 --> 01:03:44,116
<i>or how many he kills to stay there.</i>

818
01:03:44,203 --> 01:03:46,291
I don't believe anything she says,
good or bad.

819
01:03:46,377 --> 01:03:49,987
- Shut up!
- Boys, you've got to believe me.

820
01:03:50,074 --> 01:03:52,161
He's got this whole thing worked out!

821
01:03:52,204 --> 01:03:56,858
- What's he doing at Duncan's?
- Duncan's as big a sucker as any of us.

822
01:03:56,944 --> 01:04:00,599
Jim made him want to fight,
and he's gone up there to push him into it.

823
01:04:00,686 --> 01:04:03,208
I wish somebody would get over
to that case of rifles...

824
01:04:03,295 --> 01:04:06,556
<i>and start protecting me
from what's coming.</i>

825
01:04:25,429 --> 01:04:28,865
- What do you want?
- I'll talk to you inside.

826
01:04:33,604 --> 01:04:36,953
If you came here to talk for Kate Maxwell,
"you're wastin' your time.

827
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:39,518
Kate doesn't need anybody
to talk for her.

828
01:04:39,606 --> 01:04:43,041
- She's probably out of jail by now.
- I don't think so.

829
01:04:43,084 --> 01:04:46,998
- I left five of my men there.
- Hope they're alive.

830
01:04:47,085 --> 01:04:49,390
Duncan, the settlers are talking fight.

831
01:04:49,477 --> 01:04:51,478
They're gonna end this
by wiping you out.

832
01:04:51,564 --> 01:04:53,695
Wantin' to won't make it easy.

833
01:04:53,782 --> 01:04:56,348
I'd hate to be around
when she sends them out here.

834
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:59,305
They'll smoke you and your men out,
and knock you over like rabbits.

835
01:04:59,348 --> 01:05:04,916
Maybe, unless I crack down on them first
with a few ideas of my own.

836
01:05:05,002 --> 01:05:06,481
Ned!

837
01:05:08,482 --> 01:05:11,482
- Call the men in.
- Right.

838
01:05:12,612 --> 01:05:17,049
I suppose your story's pretty straight,
Mr Averell.

839
01:05:17,135 --> 01:05:21,093
- Now I'd like to know how straight you are.
- Use your head.

840
01:05:21,179 --> 01:05:23,093
Why are we fighting each other?

841
01:05:23,179 --> 01:05:25,833
Neither of us really have
anything in common with these settlers.

842
01:05:25,919 --> 01:05:28,876
We live in a different world.
We live a different life.

843
01:05:28,964 --> 01:05:32,138
When the chips are down,
whose side do you think I'll be on?

844
01:05:32,224 --> 01:05:34,052
Theirs or ours?

845
01:05:34,138 --> 01:05:37,052
You're a real high-minded citizen
to be looking for the governorship.

846
01:05:37,139 --> 01:05:40,009
- I'm for Jim Averell.
- I see that.

847
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:44,227
- So after all your big talk, "you're double-crossin' 'em.
- That's not a nice word.

848
01:05:44,314 --> 01:05:47,227
How do I know you're not
double-crossin' me?

849
01:05:47,314 --> 01:05:50,272
You don't. It's a big chance, isn't it?

850
01:05:50,315 --> 01:05:52,576
Which reminds me.
While we're here talking...

851
01:05:52,663 --> 01:05:56,577
- we're giving them more time to get organized.
- That time's about up.

852
01:05:56,664 --> 01:05:59,186
They want a fight,
I'll bring it to them.

853
01:06:03,056 --> 01:06:05,535
You're comin' along, Mr Averell.

854
01:06:05,579 --> 01:06:09,710
If anything goes wrong,
I'll have you right under my guns.

855
01:06:16,364 --> 01:06:19,930
Ned, get all the hands in from the range.

856
01:06:20,017 --> 01:06:23,062
Saddle up. We're ridin'.

857
01:06:29,888 --> 01:06:32,671
- All set.
- All right. Come on.

858
01:06:32,758 --> 01:06:35,194
<i>Get on the horses, boys. Let's go.</i>

859
01:06:58,633 --> 01:07:01,373
- If you try to stop me now, Sheriff-
- I'm not gonna stop ya.

860
01:07:01,459 --> 01:07:04,416
I'm gonna join ya like Averell's done.

861
01:07:04,503 --> 01:07:07,330
How have you managed to keep
"your outlaw friends under cover so long?

862
01:07:07,418 --> 01:07:09,852
- What outlaws?
- Wanna tell him?

863
01:07:09,939 --> 01:07:12,984
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- The outlaws working for him.

864
01:07:13,071 --> 01:07:16,637
- The ones that killed your foreman and stole your cattle.
- That's a lie!

865
01:07:16,724 --> 01:07:19,594
- If it isn't Averell-
- No use arguing now.

866
01:07:19,682 --> 01:07:22,594
We'll find out.

867
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:33,858
If there's going to be a fight with Duncan's men,
we know we're going into it with clean hands.

868
01:07:33,945 --> 01:07:37,945
But let's keep it clean all the way.
The first shot must come from him.

869
01:07:38,032 --> 01:07:41,163
And if it does, well,
"you boys know how to fight back.

870
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:43,294
- Here they come!
- Now, remember:

871
01:07:43,338 --> 01:07:45,642
Duncan's boys must be
the first to start.

872
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:56,253
Duncan, you've got about a minute
to make up your mind.

873
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:58,905
Throw in with the settlers,
and I think we can prove our friend here...

874
01:07:58,992 --> 01:08:01,471
has been double-crossing
every one of us.

875
01:08:01,559 --> 01:08:04,602
Start battlin', and the outlaws
will wipe out the town.

876
01:08:04,646 --> 01:08:08,168
Seems to me a man of your position,
with all you have at stake...

877
01:08:08,255 --> 01:08:12,387
isn't going to let your thinking be done
for you by a $50-a-month sheriff...

878
01:08:12,473 --> 01:08:15,474
a saddle bum who rode
in here from nowhere.

879
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:18,563
What's your play, Sheriff?

880
01:08:26,216 --> 01:08:28,304
You didn't spend much time in jail.

881
01:08:28,390 --> 01:08:31,347
Couldn't afford it. Too many chores.

882
01:08:31,434 --> 01:08:35,304
"Glad everybody's in good humour.

883
01:08:35,391 --> 01:08:38,566
- What's it going to be, Stan?
- We're gonna have a party.

884
01:08:38,653 --> 01:08:41,045
A mite different from
the one Mr Averell planned on...

885
01:08:41,131 --> 01:08:44,263
but he's gonna be the host.

886
01:08:44,349 --> 01:08:46,742
- Get off.
- What for?

887
01:08:46,828 --> 01:08:49,567
The man spoke to ya.

888
01:08:53,742 --> 01:08:58,613
Some odd characters in the hills are waiting
for him to tell them we're killing each other.

889
01:08:58,657 --> 01:09:00,831
All right, tell them.

890
01:09:00,918 --> 01:09:03,092
I don't know what you mean.

891
01:09:03,179 --> 01:09:05,614
The smoke signal, Mr Averell.

892
01:09:05,701 --> 01:09:09,050
You're supposed to light that stack of hay as
soon as we start throwin' lead at each other.

893
01:09:09,137 --> 01:09:12,963
<i>Then they come riding in
to take over the town.</i>

894
01:09:13,051 --> 01:09:17,313
- "Light it."
- The wind'll sweep the fire into every building in town.

895
01:09:17,399 --> 01:09:22,705
Hal, get over in the hotel
and keep a bead on him.

896
01:09:22,793 --> 01:09:24,792
If he tries to move anywhere...

897
01:09:24,879 --> 01:09:27,967
- "let him have it."
- Right.

898
01:09:31,576 --> 01:09:33,664
Now light it.

899
01:09:46,318 --> 01:09:49,014
Light it, Jim!

900
01:10:03,799 --> 01:10:05,713
Let's draw 'em in close, boys.

901
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,844
- Let 'em think we're in a free-for-all, and make it good!
-

902
01:10:18,976 --> 01:10:20,977
What are we waitin' for?

903
01:10:22,368 --> 01:10:24,456
All right. Come on!

904
01:10:36,807 --> 01:10:39,416
Rise and shine, Governor!

905
01:10:51,418 --> 01:10:55,070
- Listen to that battle.
- This is where we split up.

906
01:10:55,158 --> 01:10:58,463
Let's ride!

907
01:11:02,811 --> 01:11:05,420
I left five men guardin' you.

908
01:11:05,507 --> 01:11:09,030
Nobody hurt them.
Their pride maybe, but that's all.

909
01:11:09,116 --> 01:11:13,074
You think I'm crooked and no-account.
You'd put more trust in a lead dollar.

910
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:16,553
- Who killed Wade Burrows?
- Do you think if I had anything to do with that...

911
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:20,424
I'd have left that branding iron under him
like a signed confession?

912
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:22,859
Now you're saying that
Averell tried to frame you.

913
01:11:22,946 --> 01:11:25,771
Why should he? You're working together.

914
01:11:25,859 --> 01:11:29,382
If I talk from now till Christmas,
"you'd still only believe what you want.

915
01:11:29,469 --> 01:11:32,513
All right, go ahead.
Believe what you want.

916
01:11:32,601 --> 01:11:37,253
- But make up your mind quickly. There's a fight comin' on.
- ""

917
01:11:51,735 --> 01:11:55,604
You ain't playin' fair, Jim.
You left us no chance for fun.

918
01:11:55,692 --> 01:11:57,605
They're partners, all right!

919
01:11:57,692 --> 01:12:01,476
- I kept trying not to believe it.
- Well?

920
01:12:01,562 --> 01:12:04,824
I've been with ya
since we rode into town.

921
01:12:04,911 --> 01:12:07,564
You-You boys better put up your guns.

922
01:12:07,651 --> 01:12:11,085
- Why?
- Well, I, uh-l-

923
01:12:16,086 --> 01:12:21,261
Well, look here!
Captured ourselves a sheriff!

924
01:12:21,349 --> 01:12:23,435
You boys had a nice little scheme.

925
01:12:23,523 --> 01:12:25,697
Don't talk! Don't shoot! It's a trap.

926
01:12:25,784 --> 01:12:29,350
Not the kind of scheme that'd give
anybody a chance, but I'm givin' you one:

927
01:12:29,393 --> 01:12:32,655
<i>A fair trial if you drop your guns.</i>

928
01:12:38,831 --> 01:12:41,092
- We're covered.
- That's it, boys.

929
01:12:41,179 --> 01:12:43,136
There's a bead on every one of ya.

930
01:12:45,571 --> 01:12:47,223
Let's go!

931
01:13:22,795 --> 01:13:27,448
Get that guy in the hotel window.
He's got me pinned down.

932
01:14:50,552 --> 01:14:53,510
You stay inside!

933
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:04,641
Jim, grab on!

934
01:16:37,616 --> 01:16:39,442
Leaving?

935
01:16:40,573 --> 01:16:42,835
Pointing a gun at me again, Kate?

936
01:16:42,922 --> 01:16:46,227
I ought to kill you,
but I'd rather see you hang.

937
01:16:46,313 --> 01:16:51,010
- Now, Kate!
- You lying, sneaking, murdering-

938
01:16:51,096 --> 01:16:54,837
They'll be piling in here in a minute, Kate.
You gotta let me go.

939
01:16:54,924 --> 01:16:57,577
Why? For what you've done to me?

940
01:16:59,969 --> 01:17:02,273
For what I used to mean to you.

941
01:17:02,318 --> 01:17:04,666
That was an idea I had.

942
01:17:04,752 --> 01:17:07,101
But you were never like the idea.

943
01:17:08,145 --> 01:17:10,884
Well, uh, the good times we had.

944
01:17:10,972 --> 01:17:13,058
We had good times.

945
01:17:13,146 --> 01:17:15,668
<i>Think about them, Kate.</i>

946
01:17:15,755 --> 01:17:18,668
<i>What are you gonna gain if I die?</i>

947
01:17:18,755 --> 01:17:23,104
You'll never see me again!
You got Stan Blaine, and-

948
01:17:25,626 --> 01:17:28,191
Did I kill him, Kate,
when I had a chance?

949
01:17:28,279 --> 01:17:33,279
<i>When you asked me not to,
Kate, did I kill him?</i>

950
01:17:33,367 --> 01:17:35,889
There's another reason
"you gotta let me go.

951
01:17:37,932 --> 01:17:41,237
Look, Kate. Look at this.

952
01:17:42,846 --> 01:17:46,021
How can I believe anything you've said?
The last time-

953
01:18:12,245 --> 01:18:15,418
- Let's listen to him, boys.
- Thank you.

954
01:18:15,505 --> 01:18:18,115
I think we can
give credit for this to...

955
01:18:18,202 --> 01:18:21,245
<i>Cattle Kate! I've come to realize...</i>

956
01:18:21,333 --> 01:18:25,725
that I've got to consider
"your interests as well as mine.

957
01:18:25,768 --> 01:18:29,987
<i>If you want to make a friend of me,
think of my interests as well as yours.</i>

958
01:18:30,074 --> 01:18:34,943
<i>"The West is gettin'smaller, friends, and I
reckon we've gotta learn to live together.</i>

959
01:18:34,987 --> 01:18:39,814
<i>Now, I'm not the kind of man that'll throw
away the things that I worked hard for.</i>

960
01:18:39,901 --> 01:18:42,032
- Who gave you that?
- He did.

961
01:18:42,075 --> 01:18:45,425
- Where is he?
- Saddling up.

962
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:56,383
Where to, Maverick?

963
01:18:56,469 --> 01:19:01,339
Could be California,
maybe Oregon Territory.

964
01:19:01,427 --> 01:19:05,124
- Do you still think I was Jim Averell's woman?
- That's how it looked.

965
01:19:05,211 --> 01:19:09,298
Because I cried?
Sure, I cried, but not because I love Jim.

966
01:19:09,386 --> 01:19:12,256
I cried because when I found you
I realized I was all the things...

967
01:19:12,343 --> 01:19:15,083
I never wanted to be, and because-

968
01:19:15,170 --> 01:19:19,431
Oh, what do you know about women
