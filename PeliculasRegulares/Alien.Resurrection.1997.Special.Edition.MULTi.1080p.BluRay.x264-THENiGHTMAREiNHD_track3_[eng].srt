1
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:09,624
My mommy always said
there were no monsters.

2
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,709
No real ones.

3
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:16,923
But there are.

4
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,675
We've seen
no additional defects.

5
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:26,182
She's perfect.
Mm-hmm.

6
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,960
Careful.

7
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,588
Two centimeters.

8
00:04:57,673 --> 00:05:02,301
Okay.

9
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:04,303
Yeah.

10
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:06,389
Ready with that amnio.

11
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,479
Oh.
And...

12
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,069
there it is.

13
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:25,991
No.

14
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,627
Be careful.

15
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,219
Jesus.

16
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:50,057
Clamp.

17
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:56,230
What about her?
Can we keep her alive?

18
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,232
How's the host?

19
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,943
Doing well.

20
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:07,575
Sew her back up.

21
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,497
Excellent work, everybody.

22
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,852
And how is
our Number 8 today?

23
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:00,437
Appears to be
in good health.

24
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:03,566
Hmm?
How good?
Excellent,

25
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,528
as in completely off
our projected charts.

26
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:10,573
Look at the scar tissue.

27
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:17,246
See the recession?
This is from three days ago?

28
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,000
Exactly.
Oh, this is good.

29
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,085
This is very good.

30
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:28,340
You're gonna make us all
very proud.

31
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:46,025
No.

32
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,027
Don't. I'm all right.

33
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,280
Now try this.

34
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:01,498
- Hand.
- Close.

35
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,584
Glove.

36
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:15,554
Number 8?

37
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,514
Fruit.

38
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:20,726
Good. Cherries.
It's unprecedented.

39
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,062
Totally.
She's operating...

40
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:26,982
at a completely adult capacity.

41
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,612
What about her memories?
There are gaps.

42
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,907
- And some degree ofsynaptic dissonance.
- - You know this.

43
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,909
- She's freaked.
- Come on.

44
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,619
It has connective difficulties,

45
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,872
caused by a biochemical imbalance,
causing emotional autism.

46
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,540
Certain reactions—
All right,
wait a second!

47
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:47,753
It has memories.
Why does it have memories?

48
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,130
Well, I'm guessing, but...
inherited memories,

49
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:53,050
passed down generationally
at a genetic level...

50
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,886
by the aliens, like its strength.

51
00:09:55,971 --> 00:10:00,140
Plus a, uh,
highly evolved form of instinct.

52
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:03,602
An unexpected benefit
from the genetic crossing.

53
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:06,146
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.
I see.

54
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,774
Stupid me.
Ofcourse.

55
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,944
An unexpected benefit
ofthe genetic process.

56
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,196
Oh! And I didn't
even think ofthat!

57
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:18,075
Let's try this one.

58
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:23,914
Ripley?

59
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,001
Ripley.

60
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,587
Ripley, what is it?

61
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,718
Ripley? Ripley?

62
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,516
You're not thinking
termination?

63
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,518
Oh, boy,
am I thinking termination.

64
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,520
General,
we do not perceive this
to be a problem.

65
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,315
Ellen Ripley died trying to
wipe this species out.

66
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,734
For all intents and purposes,
she succeeded.

67
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,236
I'm not anxious to see her
taking up her old hobbies.

68
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,822
That won't happen.
We won't tell her.

69
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:00,075
Oh, I see.
And that's supposed
to comfort me?

70
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,204
Identification, please.

71
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,252
Please try again.

72
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,671
Thankyou, General Perez.

73
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:16,008
Bottom line is,
she looks at me funny
one time,

74
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,010
I'm putting her down.

75
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,387
Okay, as far as I'm concerned,
Number 8...

76
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:24,183
is a meat... by-product.

77
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,189
Her Majesty here
is the real payoff.

78
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,566
When does she start producing?
Days.

79
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,610
Less maybe.

80
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:39,114
We need the cargo.
I told you,
it's on its way.

81
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,321
Fork.

82
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:23,826
- Fuck.
- It's-It's "fork."

83
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:30,040
How did you—

84
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,794
How did... we get you?

85
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,380
Yes.

86
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:43,429
Hard work.
We used blood samples...

87
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,556
from Fiori Sixteen on ice,

88
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,933
where you died.

89
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:51,103
We've remade you.
We cloned you.

90
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,189
Fiori Sixteen.

91
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,861
Does that ring a bell?

92
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,572
Are you remembering something?

93
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,076
- Does it grow?
- Yeah.

94
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,037
Very rapidly.

95
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,915
It's a queen.

96
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:16,170
How did you know that?

97
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,673
She'll breed.
You'll die.

98
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,343
Everyone in the company
will die.

99
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,345
In the— In the-
In the company?

100
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:29,725
Weyland-Yutani.
Ripley 8's
former employers.

101
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,978
Terran growth conglomerate.
They had...

102
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,314
defense contracts
under the military.

103
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:38,859
Oh, they went under
decades ago, Gediman.
Way before your time.

104
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,903
Bought out by Wal-Mart.

105
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:45,115
Fortunes ofwar.

106
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:48,535
I thinkyou will find
that, uh,

107
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:52,080
things have changed
a great deal since your time.

108
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,500
I doubt that.

109
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,502
We're not flying
blind here, you know.

110
00:13:56,586 --> 00:14:00,589
It's United Systems Military,
not some greedy corporation.

111
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,257
Oh.

112
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,092
Well, it won't
make any difference.

113
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:08,639
You're still gonna die.

114
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,768
How do you feel about that?

115
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,359
I wish you could understand
what we're trying to do here.

116
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:24,196
The potential for this species
goes way beyond
urban pacification.

117
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,532
New alloys, new vaccines.

118
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:29,326
Nothing like this we've ever seen
on any world before.

119
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,870
You should be very proud.

120
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:33,872
Oh.

121
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:35,582
I am.

122
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,418
And the animal itself-

123
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,712
wondrous.

124
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:44,883
The potential, unbelievable,
once we've tamed them.

125
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,513
Roll over. Play dead.

126
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,390
Heel?
Mm-hmm.

127
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:54,059
You can't teach it tricks.

128
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:58,146
Why not?
We're teaching you.

129
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:17,833
Hey, son, I'll give you
my authorization code.

130
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,336
It's E-A-T-M-E.

131
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,672
I'm sorry, sir.
Could you repeat that?

132
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,674
Little prick.

133
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,967
You know,

134
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,970
no matter how many times
you see it,

135
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:34,474
the sight ofa woman
all strapped up
in a chair like thatjust—

136
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:38,604
What?

137
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,939
Just bring us in on
a 3-0 descent, would ya?

138
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,109
And ride the parallel.
Darlin', it is done.

139
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,445
Good girl.

140
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:49,781
You, uh, want
anything there, trigger?

141
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:52,951
Hmm. Yeah.
How 'bout a cup ofcoffee?

142
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:55,412
Anything else,
while your mouth's warm,
I mean?

143
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:58,373
Little milk.

144
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,128
Hey, don't cut thrust
till about 600 meters,

145
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,714
and we'll give 'em
a little scare.

146
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,424
Vriess. Call.

147
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,551
Lock down.
We're gonna dock.

148
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,286
- Hey, Call?
- Yep?

149
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:41,083
What has two thumbs,
one eye,

150
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,753
a pink tongue...

151
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:48,298
and screws like a god?

152
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,593
What?

153
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:02,479
Two thumbs, one eye,
a pink tongue...

154
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:06,233
and screws like a god?

155
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:09,277
What?

156
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:28,046
Time to enjoy some of
the general's hospitality, Christie.

157
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,591
Great.
Army food.

158
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:35,554
Yeah. It'll do
till we get the family wagon
up to spec, I reckon.

159
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,349
Yeah.
That is ifthe natives
are friendly.

160
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:42,352
How's that?

161
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:44,062
Good.

162
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:46,606
We expecting any,
uh, trouble?

163
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:50,736
Nah. From Perez, I doubt it.
But you never know.
We've been there before.

164
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,670
What is wrong with you?

165
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,756
Just a little target practice.

166
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,176
Vriess isn't complaining.

167
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,721
Goddamn it!

168
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,932
Johner, you son ofa bitch!

169
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:24,186
Come on, man.
You didn't feel a thing.

170
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:31,443
You are an inbred motherfucker,
you know that?

171
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,493
I'll take the knife
back now.

172
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:45,415
Whoa.

173
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,251
Call, forget it.

174
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:52,339
He's been sucking down
too much home brew.

175
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:55,717
The knife.

176
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:01,348
Son ofa bitch!

177
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:06,937
Don't push me, little Call.
You hang with us for a while,

178
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:09,689
you'll find out
I am not the man
with whom to fuck!

179
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,703
It's about time
we start associating
with a better class of people.

180
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,878
I am Father.

181
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:15,881
Welcome to the U.S.M. Auriga.

182
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:19,634
Step forward for
contraband and weapons search.

183
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,721
Please report
any infectious diseases...

184
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,681
to the medical officers.

185
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:28,894
Levels 7 through 1 2
are off-limits to civilians.

186
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,479
Thankyou foryour cooperation.

187
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,481
Go.

188
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,820
Get your hands up,
please, sir.
What?

189
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:41,197
Could you get
your hands up, please?

190
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,959
There are no weapons
allowed on board, sir.

191
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,547
My own recipe.

192
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:00,800
Way more dangerous.

193
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,933
Nice welcome, Perez.
What the hell is this?

194
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:11,603
What, are you afraid
the six of us are gonna hijack
your damn ship or what?

195
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:15,273
Just a minor concern
that one ofyour
asshole crew members...

196
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:17,817
is gonna get drunk
and put a bullet
through the hull.

197
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:20,111
We happen to be
in space, Elgyn.

198
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:22,697
No shit. Howyou been?

199
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:33,458
Wanna check the chair?

200
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:42,384
Elgyn, these were very,
very hard to come by.

201
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,469
So was our cargo.

202
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:49,140
- You're, uh, not about to plead
poverty on me, are you, General?
- No.

203
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:52,310
Just saying very few people
deal in cash nowadays.

204
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:55,021
Just the ones don't like
to keep business records.

205
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:57,732
- Yourself, for example.
- Drink, Elgyn?

206
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,734
Constantly.

207
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:06,992
Now, I'm gonna take
a wild guess here, General,

208
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:10,704
but I'm thinking whatever
you got going on here,

209
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:14,582
it, uh, ain't exactly approved
by Congress.

210
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:18,336
Who's the...

211
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:21,047
new fillyyou got
on board, Elgyn?

212
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:25,468
Call. Little girl
playing pirates.

213
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,762
She makes an impression.

214
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:31,683
She is severely fuckable,
ain't she?

215
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:42,318
Mighty handy
with a monkey wrench too,
I might add.

216
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:46,072
I think Vriess
has got a bit ofa light
in his eye for her.

217
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:49,242
Fine little ass like that'd
make a man walk.
You know what I mean?

218
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:57,375
Mind you, uh, I think
she'sjust a tad curious...

219
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,170
about, uh,
this little transaction ofours.

220
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:02,172
I mean, I can't say as I blame her.

221
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:04,674
It's awfully cloak-and-dagger stuff.

222
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:07,302
It's a military operation.

223
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,472
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

224
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:13,475
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but, uh,

225
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,685
I was under the impression
that, uh,

226
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:20,273
most army medical labs
don't have to operate
outside of regulated space.

227
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:23,568
- What do you want, Elgyn?
What can I do foryou?
- Me?

228
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:27,072
- Yeah.
- Oh, two days bed and board.

229
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:30,200
You know,
Vriess might wanna snag a part
here or there, whatever.

230
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:32,243
I mean, uh, if it's not imposing.

231
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,204
I don't see any problem.

232
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:37,123
Couple ofconditions
though.
Ah.

233
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,792
Conditions?

234
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,338
Not you...

235
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,340
nor any ofyour...

236
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,592
formidable crew members...

237
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,552
will go anywhere near...

238
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:51,930
restricted areas.

239
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:54,140
Rule number two:

240
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,769
No trouble.

241
00:23:57,895 --> 00:24:00,271
Good behavior.
Good behavior.

242
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:05,860
- No fights.
- No fights.

243
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,698
Mi casa es su casa.

244
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:39,519
Please direct cargo
to med lab center, area "G."

245
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,231
Follow the lit path.

246
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,275
Do not deviate.

247
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:59,205
Cargo status: stable.

248
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:02,000
Life-forms intact.

249
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,544
Stasis uninterrupted.

250
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:21,644
Med lab center
is off-limits to civilians.

251
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:23,688
Thankyou.

252
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,761
Oh.
Hey. Chill.

253
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:40,181
Oh, please.
 You know I can't lay offthe tall ones.

254
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,518
Howyou doin'?
How about a little
one-on-one?

255
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,561
What do you say?

256
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,277
You got some moves
on you, girl.

257
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,279
Oh, man.

258
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:05,999
Mm-hmm.

259
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:21,139
Well, now, ifyou don't
wanna play basketball,
I know some other indoor sports.

260
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,362
Come on, now.
Give me the ball.

261
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:50,418
Okay, I got a new game.

262
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,836
Tag!

263
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:09,687
Ripley? Ripley.

264
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,904
You've had enough fun.

265
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,035
What the hell are you?

266
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,547
Something ofa predator,
isn't she?

267
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:40,551
Yes, she continues
to make us all very proud.

268
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:59,589
We're coming up on just
one minute and 30 seconds left...

269
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:01,591
to order this one-of-a-kind
collector's item.

270
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:05,595
Jesus Christ,Johner,
what do you put in this shit,
battery acid?

271
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,639
Just for color.

272
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:19,478
So, we're a fast learner.

273
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,773
Now here's a fine item.
 This is a really good show, man.

274
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:25,651
It's from the Gut Cutter's
Celebration Collection,

275
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:28,696
makers of premier
knives and edge ware.

276
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,615
The knife features
a stainless steel blade,

277
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:35,036
perfect for any use
in hunting or in the home.

278
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,040
The pro handle
is made from authentic
antique plywood...

279
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:41,709
and stained in brilliant colors
for an uncanny charm.

280
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:45,379
Hey, man, that shit
is not easy to come by!

281
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,631
Why don't you take
a walk outside?

282
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:50,009
...to a cutting edge
that will rip through anything—

283
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:54,263
Great!

284
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,891
- I'm so sorry.
- Now I smell like this shit!

285
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:58,934
Ifbitches
can't handle this shit,

286
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:00,936
bitches should stay away
from this shit!

287
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:03,022
Go to bed. Fucking bitch.

288
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,507
Identification, please.

289
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:42,395
Please try again.

290
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:48,526
Thankyou, General Perez.

291
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,396
Well?

292
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,109
You gonna kill me,
orwhat?

293
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:34,780
There's no point,
is there?

294
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:37,324
They've taken it
out ofyou.

295
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:40,411
Where is it?
Is it on the ship?

296
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:44,415
You mean my baby.

297
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:48,669
I don't get it.
Ifthey took it out,

298
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,380
why are they
keeping you alive?

299
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:55,593
Well, they're curious.
I'm the latest thing.

300
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,312
Look.

301
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:08,314
I can make it all stop.

302
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:12,443
The pain, this nightmare.
That's all I can offeryou.

303
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,495
What makes you think...

304
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:24,788
I would let you do that?

305
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,711
Who are you?

306
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:34,882
Ripley, Ellen,
Lieutenant First Class,

307
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,301
number 36706.

308
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:42,598
Ellen Ripley died
200 years ago.

309
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:46,143
You're not her.

310
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,688
I'm not her.

311
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:58,280
Who am I?

312
00:35:58,365 --> 00:36:02,451
You're a thing, a construct.
They grew you in a fucking lab.

313
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,746
And now they brought it
out ofyou.

314
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,874
Not all the way out.

315
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:18,968
I can feel it...
behind my eyes.

316
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:22,638
I can hear it moving.

317
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:30,437
You gotta help me stop this thing
before it gets loose.

318
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:35,734
It's too late.

319
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:38,279
You can't stop it.

320
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:40,364
It's inevitable.

321
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,494
Not as long as I'm around.

322
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:49,039
You'll never get out of here alive.

323
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:52,710
I don't care.

324
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:54,712
Really?

325
00:36:57,424 --> 00:37:00,092
I can make it stop.

326
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:09,310
Go on. Get out of here.

327
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,395
They're looking foryou.

328
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:26,952
I think you're gonna find
that this was very ill-advised.

329
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,622
Where are her friends?
They're in
the mess hall, sir.

330
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:32,875
Well, you find them, now.
Quietly.

331
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,710
What the hell
is going on here?

332
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,254
Smells like
a double-cross, boss.

333
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,216
Where's the other one?
With the chair?

334
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,261
Don't ever touch me.

335
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:45,471
Ever.

336
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:48,015
You wanna tell us what this is?

337
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:50,142
You wanna tell me
who you're workin' for.
What?

338
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:53,354
- Wren, they got nothing
to do with this.
- To do with what?

339
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:56,357
Do you know what
the penalties for
terrorist activity are?

340
00:37:56,441 --> 00:38:00,277
No goddamn terrorists
on my crew. Call, there
something you wanna tell me?

341
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:04,239
Look. I don't care whether
you knew or not. You brought
a terrorist on board a military vessel.

342
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:07,660
And as far as I am concerned,
you all die with her!

343
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:11,580
Do you understand?

344
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,377
Yeah.

345
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:18,462
I understand.

346
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,091
Christie.

347
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:27,513
Down!

348
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:31,016
Freeze!

349
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:42,444
Stop! Drop your weapons!

350
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:46,365
And you!
Drop that piece ofshit,
or I blow his head off!

351
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,867
- Can't do that, man.
- Drop it now!

352
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:51,537
- Can't do that.
They're attached to me.
- I'm not fucking with you!

353
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:54,790
You're all under arrest
for a code eight,
which is concealed weapons,

354
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,959
and a code 1 2, which is murder!

355
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:59,002
Release Dr. Wren!
Kiss my ass.

356
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:01,171
Put down yourweapons
and assume the fucking—

357
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,387
Everybody okay?

358
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:12,766
Real easy, soldier boy.

359
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:15,352
Security.
Get up!

360
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:19,022
There is a serious problem
in the mess hall.

361
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:21,191
You lie to me now,
little girl,

362
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:26,655
I will cut your throat
and leave you here to die,
you understand me?

363
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:30,325
This is security, Section 2.
We do not read you.
Hello? Goddamn it! Hello?

364
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,411
We do not copyyou.
Please repeat.

365
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:34,496
Hello?
Please repeat.

366
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:10,634
Gediman!

367
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:14,304
He's conducting
illegal experiments.
He is breeding some sort of-

368
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:18,559
Ice the goddamn mole!
Listen to me!
He is breeding an alien species.

369
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:20,602
More than dangerous.
Ifthose things get loose,

370
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:23,355
it's gonna make
the Lacerta plague look like
a fucking square dance!

371
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:26,859
Shut up!

372
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:28,819
Listen.

373
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:32,406
Your attention, please.

374
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:36,326
Security breach, med lab,
Level 1 5.

375
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:34,301
Go. Let's get back to the Betty.
Doctor and soldier boy here
can see us to the door.

376
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:36,553
- What about Vriess?
- Fuck Vriess.

377
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:49,900
Your attention, please.

378
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:53,278

- Move it! Now!

382
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:05,791
- Go! Go now!
- Evacuation.

383
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:18,470
This is not a drill.

384
00:43:27,689 --> 00:43:30,232
- Evacuation.
- Move it! Go! Get on board!

385
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,151
Your attention, please.

386
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:34,861
Nonhuman presence detected,

387
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:38,699

Level 38, Level 39.

390
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,419
Evacuation.

391
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:53,547
Proceed to lifeboats.

392
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,674
This is not a drill.

393
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,801
Thankyou foryour cooperation.

394
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,163
I'll give you holes,
you slimy bastard!

395
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,211
Move it! Let's go!

396
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:16,922
Final lifeboat ready for launch.
Get aboard!

397
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,387
Go!

398
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:26,932
Complete evacuation now.

399
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,692
Grenade.

400
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:34,040
Alert. Alert.

401
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:36,167
Evacuation incomplete.

402
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:41,548
Civilian presence detected
in area "H." Warning.

403
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:45,468
Main vessel
declared uninhabitable.

404
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:55,103
Elgyn, come on.
Let's move, man.

405
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:57,147
Yeah.

406
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:20,063
Elgyn? Elgyn, where are you?

407
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:31,574
Elgyn, where are you?

408
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,997
Elgyn?

409
00:49:14,577 --> 00:49:16,578
Elgyn!

410
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:19,706
- God. Elgyn?
- Elgyn?

411
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,208
Elgyn!

412
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:25,003
Elgyn!

413
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:27,672
Easy, Hillard!
Christie, give me a hand here!

414
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,382
Get him up!
Give me a hand here!

415
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:32,969
Come on! Let's get him up!
Move out ofthe way!

416
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:34,971
No!
Ah, shit.

417
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:37,807
What the fuck did this?
What's in this place?

418
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,191
- Call, get down!
- What the fuck is that?

419
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:48,860
Don't shoot!
It's in front ofthe hull!

420
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,739
What is that?

421
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:56,493
Come on, man.
Time to go. Time to go!
Get back!

422
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:59,454
Damn!

423
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:02,707
Call, time to go!
Come on, Call!

424
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:06,419
Get the goddamn door open!

425
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:10,090
We can't open it!
We can't open the door!

426
00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:18,640
- We gotta go back!
- I'm not going back!
You go back!

427
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:47,752
What the fuck?

428
00:50:47,837 --> 00:50:49,921
Was it everything
you hoped for?

429
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:54,217
Leave him alone!

430
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:06,271
What do we do now, man?

431
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:10,400
Same thing we're doin'.
Get the hell outta here!
What ifthere's more?

432
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:15,572
I say we stay here, man.
Let the army guys deal.

433
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:17,740
Where the fuck
are the army guys?

434
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:20,160
They're dead!

435
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:22,203
Well, then we don't need
this asshole anymore.

436
00:51:22,288 --> 00:51:24,205
- Step back!
- No, you step back!

437
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:26,791
- Stop it!
- You got no authority here!

438
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:32,463
Doctor, that thing
that killed my partner,

439
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:36,092
that's your pet
science project?
Yes.

440
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:39,512
- Let me do him right now, man!
- I should let him do you right now!

441
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:42,140
How many more are there?

442
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:45,560
How many more are there?
Twelve.

443
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:51,941
Twelve?
Twelve.

444
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,571
Twelve.

445
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:58,740
There'll be more.

446
00:52:00,326 --> 00:52:02,911
So,

447
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:05,455
who do I have to fuck
to get offthis boat?

448
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:11,628
I can get you off.
Maybe not the boat, but-

449
00:52:12,922 --> 00:52:16,007
Let's get out of here.
No, wait a second here.

450
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:18,092
She was the host
for these monsters.

451
00:52:18,177 --> 00:52:20,595
Wren cloned her because
she had one inside her.

452
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:23,223
She's not human.

453
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:27,310
She was part of his experiment,
and she will turn on us
in a second.

454
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:29,312
I don't give a shit
what she is.

455
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:32,106
She's too much ofa risk.
We have to leave her.

456
00:52:32,191 --> 00:52:35,526
- She comes.
- We can't trust her!

457
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:37,195
I don't trust anyone.

458
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:44,452
Ifwe're gonna survive this mess,
we all stick together.

459
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:46,537
Agreed?

460
00:52:57,466 --> 00:53:01,636
Hillard, we gotta go.
It's not over.
We gotta get to the Betty.

461
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:32,875
Make a nice souvenir.

462
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:43,720
I can't believe
you did that.

463
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:46,180
Did what?
Killed one of'em.

464
00:53:46,307 --> 00:53:49,309
It's like killing
your own kind.
It was in my way.

465
00:54:12,124 --> 00:54:14,876
Oh, man!

466
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:22,133
Who were you expecting, Santa Claus?

467
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:25,136
Thought you were toast
for certain, man.

468
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,847
Shit. Where's Elgyn?

469
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:33,436
Oh, shit.

470
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,105
Hey, man, what if
we get to the Betty
and they're all over it?

471
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:39,650
- All the activity's been in the aft sector
by the barracks. Why would they move?
- They won't.

472
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:41,652
Ifthey send anyone out,

473
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:43,988
it'll be, uh, here,

474
00:54:45,157 --> 00:54:47,325
where the meat is.

475
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:51,621
Yeah. Well, I say
ifwe wanna make any decent time,
I say we ditch the cripple.

476
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:57,126
- No offense, man.
- None taken.

477
00:54:57,211 --> 00:55:00,296
Nobody is left behind.
Not even you,Johner.

478
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:05,301
- What's the quickest way out of here?
- After the cooling tower,

479
00:55:05,386 --> 00:55:06,969
there's a freight elevator.

480
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:10,473
It runs from the top
ofthe ship down to
Engineering Level 1 deck.

481
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:14,769
- Take us straight to the dock.
- Sounds reasonable. Let's do it.

482
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:17,105
We're moving.

483
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,566
- What?
- The ship is moving.

484
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:22,360
I can feel it.

485
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:25,822
The ship has stealth run.
There's no wayyou can tell.

486
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,950
She's right.

487
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:31,828
The ship's been go since the attack.

488
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:34,914
That's a standard
emergency procedure.
That's right.

489
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:38,418
Any serious problem,
and the ship autopilots
back to home base.

490
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:40,753
And you were planning
on letting us know this?

491
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:42,588
Nobody asked.

492
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:46,008
What's home base?

493
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:49,387
Earth.

494
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:51,848
Oh, great.

495
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:54,809
- Bastard.
- Earth?

496
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:56,853
I'd rather stay here
with the things, man.

497
00:55:56,937 --> 00:55:59,147
How long until we get to Earth?

498
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,940
Three hours almost.

499
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:03,151
We gotta blow the ship.

500
00:56:03,235 --> 00:56:05,987
Call, you're not blowing this ship.

501
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:08,364
Not while we're on it, okay?

502
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:12,577
We get out ofthis shit,
you do as you please,
all right?

503
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:17,665
Earth, man.
What a shit-hole.

504
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:27,758
It's clear.

505
00:56:33,849 --> 00:56:35,850
Hey, Ripley.

506
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:43,149
I heard you, like,
ran into these things before.

507
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:47,653
That's right.
Wow, man.

508
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:51,073
So, like, what did you do?

509
00:56:53,994 --> 00:56:55,995
I died.

510
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,273
Not that way!

511
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:30,738
Ripley.

512
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:39,330
Ripley, come on.

513
00:57:42,751 --> 00:57:45,586
Ripley, we got no time
for sightseeing here.

514
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:52,468
Ripley, don't.

515
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:53,130
Hel—

516
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:57,593
Kill... me.

517
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:10,106
Kill me.

518
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:53,083
Don't do it, Ripley.

519
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:03,803
Don't do what?

520
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:18,526
What's the big deal, man?

521
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:20,694
Fuckin' waste ofammo.

522
01:02:20,779 --> 01:02:22,780
Let's go.

523
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,492
Must be a chick thing.

524
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:39,982
Am I dreaming, or is this not
the shit we brought with us?

525
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:42,443
Yeah, it's the same shit.

526
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:46,363
Stinks in here, man.
Let's keep moving.

527
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:22,524
Get away from me!
Get away from me!

528
01:04:22,651 --> 01:04:24,568
Drop the rod, man.
Get away from me!

529
01:04:24,653 --> 01:04:27,237
- Do it!
- Get away from me.

530
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:31,617
Get away from me.

531
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:35,245
Who are you people?

532
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:38,499
- What's happening here?
- Calm down.

533
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:42,586
What's happening here is
we're getting the fuck off
this ghost ship, okay?

534
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:45,506
Ship? What ship?

535
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:49,593
Where am I?

536
01:04:49,678 --> 01:04:53,222
I was in cryo, right?
On my way to Xarem, right?

537
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:55,849
Work crew for the nickel
refinery, right?

538
01:04:55,934 --> 01:04:58,811
I wake up.
I know I don't understand.

539
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:05,484
Oh, God. Uh, I s- I saw—
I saw horrible things.

540
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:09,405
Look, you're coming with us.
It's too dangerous foryou here.

541
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:21,667
Leave him.

542
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:24,545
Fuckyou.
We're not leaving him here.

543
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:28,507
He's got one inside of him.

544
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:30,592
I can smell it.

545
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:34,304
Inside me?

546
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:39,435
Inside me?
What's inside me?
Hey, man.

547
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:42,062
I don't want one ofthose things
birthing anywhere near my ass.

548
01:05:42,147 --> 01:05:43,480
It's a bad risk.

549
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:48,610
- What's inside me?
- Look, we can'tjust leave him here.

550
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:51,071
- I thought you came here
to stop 'em from spreadin'.
- What's inside me?

551
01:05:51,156 --> 01:05:54,283
- There's gotta be a process.
Can't you stop it?
- Got no time for that.

552
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:57,036
- I can't do it here.
The lab is out oforder.
- What's inside me?

553
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,288
I could do him.
Back ofthe head.

554
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:01,749
Painless.
It might be the best way.

555
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:04,334
- What's inside me?
- No, there's got
to be another way.

556
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:07,671
What ifwe freeze him?
What's in-fuckin'-side me?

557
01:06:07,756 --> 01:06:08,922
A parasite!

558
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:13,343
Foreign element.

559
01:06:18,892 --> 01:06:21,393
There's a monster in your chest.

560
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:25,439
These guys
hijacked your ship,

561
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:27,483
and they sold
your cryo tube...

562
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:30,444
to this... human,

563
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:33,864
and he put an alien inside ofyou.

564
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:35,908
It's a really nasty one.

565
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:40,996
And in a few hours,
it's gonna burst its way
through your rib cage...

566
01:06:41,081 --> 01:06:43,624
and you're gonna die.

567
01:06:49,089 --> 01:06:50,798
Any questions?

568
01:06:58,014 --> 01:06:59,932
Who are you?

569
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:03,644
I'm the monster's mother.

570
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:09,817
Look, he comes with us,
we freeze him on the Betty,

571
01:07:09,901 --> 01:07:12,277
- then the doctor
can remove it later.
- Fine with me.

572
01:07:12,362 --> 01:07:14,696
Since when were you
in goddamn charge?

573
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:18,117
- Since you were born without balls!
- Ease off, people.

574
01:07:27,335 --> 01:07:31,171
All right.
You come with us.
You might even live.

575
01:07:31,256 --> 01:07:34,091
Get twitchy on me,
and you'll be shot.

576
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:37,636
Let's move out.

577
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:51,483
It's a mess down there!
Is this the only way?

578
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:54,778
Vriess, we gotta lose
the chair.

579
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:58,740
I know.

580
01:07:58,825 --> 01:08:00,909
Kawlang maneuver,
all right?

581
01:08:01,035 --> 01:08:04,163
Yeah,just like old times.
Yeah.

582
01:08:09,127 --> 01:08:11,461
Must be the cooling tanks.

583
01:08:11,546 --> 01:08:14,131
Somebody must have
opened the valves.

584
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:16,884
The nasties couldn't have
done this, could they?

585
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:31,356
We're at the bottom
ofthe ship.

586
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:34,568
We have to go through
the kitchen, maybe 90 feet,

587
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:37,196
to the freight elevator
on the other side.

588
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:41,450
- I don't like it.
- What's to like?

589
01:08:43,328 --> 01:08:44,953
This sucks!

590
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:48,624
- Wren, are you sure
about the distance?
- Yes.

591
01:08:50,043 --> 01:08:52,461
- You ready to get wet, partner?
- Yeah.

592
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:04,973
Hey, uh, do your weapons
fire underwater?

593
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:09,102
- Yeah, they're disposables.
They can take it.
- Disposables?

594
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:15,943
Hey, I heard about those. Yeah.

595
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:20,948
- How many rounds?
- Twenty.

596
01:09:21,032 --> 01:09:24,576
Split points give you a good hole,
even at the smaller caliber.

597
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:27,746
Oh. Hey, that's cool.

598
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:31,291
Yeah. They're big with hitters
'cause you, uh, throw 'em away
after thejob.

599
01:09:31,376 --> 01:09:34,503
Nobody likes to throw away
a weapon they're attached to.
You know what I mean?

600
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:36,255
Yeah.

601
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:39,424
Guess I don't have to tell everyone
to take a deep breath.

602
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:47,516
Hey, Christie,
do me a favor.

603
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,519
When we hit the surface
on the other side,

604
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:53,272
no backstroke, okay?

605
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:27,694
Jesus Christ!

606
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:42,626
They set a goddamn trap.

607
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:44,628
It's a goddamn ambush!

608
01:14:50,695 --> 01:14:52,320
Distephano!

609
01:15:11,966 --> 01:15:14,759
It won't break.
Give me yourweapon.

610
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:19,514
You really are way too trusting.

611
01:15:19,599 --> 01:15:33,236
No!

612
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:43,872
You killed her!
You bastard!

613
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:51,671
I'll get you!

614
01:15:52,423 --> 01:15:54,424
Father, lock the door.

615
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:13,151
Christie! Climb! Climb!

616
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:14,778
I'm doin' it, man!
Come on!

617
01:16:14,862 --> 01:16:17,113
Come on!

618
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:19,991
It'sjammed!
Move it!

619
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:22,994
It'sjammed!

620
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:57,237
Get off my foot, bitch!

621
01:17:05,371 --> 01:17:07,372
Get off me!

622
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:11,918
Johner!

623
01:17:12,002 --> 01:17:14,129
Get off me!
Get off me!

624
01:17:14,213 --> 01:17:17,757
Aaah!Johner!

625
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,513
Die, motherfucker!

626
01:17:25,599 --> 01:17:28,143
Do it, man!

627
01:17:29,353 --> 01:17:30,854
Hey!

628
01:17:44,535 --> 01:17:46,995
Real nice party, ain't it?

629
01:18:15,024 --> 01:18:18,777
Christie! Christie!

630
01:18:20,154 --> 01:18:23,031
Christie! No!

631
01:18:23,115 --> 01:18:27,494
Christie!

632
01:18:27,578 --> 01:18:31,080
What are you doing?
Don't do it!

633
01:18:31,165 --> 01:18:34,667
Don't!
We can make it!

634
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:37,170
No!

635
01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:42,383
Damn!

636
01:19:30,182 --> 01:19:31,724
This way.

637
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:37,063
Come on!

638
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:44,153
Baby, am I glad to see you.

639
01:19:44,238 --> 01:19:47,156
I was sure that asshole got you.
Are you hurt?

640
01:19:47,241 --> 01:19:49,409
I'm fine.

641
01:19:49,493 --> 01:19:52,871
You got body armor on?
Yeah. Come on.

642
01:19:52,955 --> 01:19:55,456
You took it in the chest.
I saw it.

643
01:20:17,563 --> 01:20:19,272
You're a robot?

644
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:24,319
Son ofa bitch!
Our little Call
isjust full ofsurprises.

645
01:20:24,403 --> 01:20:28,531
I should have known.
No human being is that humane.

646
01:20:28,616 --> 01:20:31,117
I thought synthetics
were supposed to be
all logical and shit.

647
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:33,786
You'rejust
a big old psycho, girl.

648
01:20:33,871 --> 01:20:37,081
- You're a robot?
- You're a second gen, aren't you?

649
01:20:38,626 --> 01:20:40,877
You're an Auton.

650
01:20:40,961 --> 01:20:45,214
Robots designed
by robots, right?
Hah!

651
01:20:45,299 --> 01:20:47,342
Oh, yeah. That's right.
I remember.

652
01:20:47,426 --> 01:20:50,136
Now, they were
supposed to revitalize
the synthetic industry.

653
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:52,138
Instead, they buried it.

654
01:20:52,222 --> 01:20:55,808
They didn't like
being told what to do.

655
01:20:55,893 --> 01:20:58,144
Government ordered
a recall.

656
01:20:58,228 --> 01:21:00,480
Now, I heard—
I had— I had heard...

657
01:21:00,564 --> 01:21:03,483
that only a few-
just a few-
had gotten out intact.

658
01:21:03,567 --> 01:21:06,736
Man, I never, never thought
that I would see one!

659
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:11,074
Great. She's a toaster oven.

660
01:21:11,158 --> 01:21:13,868
Can we leave now?

661
01:21:13,953 --> 01:21:16,996
How long before we land?

662
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:20,083
- Just under two hours.
- Hey, Vriess.

663
01:21:20,167 --> 01:21:22,293
You got a socket wrench?
Maybe shejust needs
an oil change.

664
01:21:22,419 --> 01:21:26,255
I'm sorry. Access denied.
I can't believe I almost fucked it.

665
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:28,091
Yeah, like you
never fucked a robot!

666
01:21:28,217 --> 01:21:31,678
You know, ifWren gets in the computer,
he could really screw us.

667
01:21:31,804 --> 01:21:34,681
We gotta find a terminal.
 No, there's no console on this level.

668
01:21:34,807 --> 01:21:37,266
We'd have to go back.
Well, we can't go back.

669
01:21:37,351 --> 01:21:39,978
- And I don't know
any ofWren's access codes.
- Help me.

670
01:21:42,022 --> 01:21:44,023
Call.

671
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:46,818
No. I can't.

672
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:49,112
Right. You're the new model droid.

673
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:52,824
You can access
the mainframe by remote.
No, I can't.

674
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:55,410
I burned my modem.
We all did.

675
01:21:55,494 --> 01:21:59,205
Call, you can still patch in manually.
You know that.

676
01:21:59,289 --> 01:22:02,959
There's ports
in the chapel, up there.

677
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:06,170
Call.

678
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:15,221
You're programmed
for that?
Don't make me do this.

679
01:22:15,305 --> 01:22:17,056
Don't make me make you.

680
01:22:17,141 --> 01:22:20,977
I don't want to go in there.

681
01:22:21,061 --> 01:22:23,855
It's like my insides are liquid.
It's not real.

682
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:26,065
Get over it.

683
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:28,234
You can blow the ship
before it reaches Earth...

684
01:22:28,318 --> 01:22:30,194
and kill them all.

685
01:22:40,664 --> 01:22:43,332
Just give us time
to get out first.

686
01:22:46,045 --> 01:22:48,546
Damn it.
Anything?

687
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:50,381
Hold on.

688
01:22:54,762 --> 01:22:57,930
Breach in Sector 7,
Sector 3.

689
01:22:59,058 --> 01:23:01,100
Sector 9 unstable.

690
01:23:02,186 --> 01:23:05,021
Engines operating at 41 %.

691
01:23:05,105 --> 01:23:08,107
Eighty-six minutes
until Earth dock.

692
01:23:08,192 --> 01:23:10,568
We burned too much energy.

693
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:13,946
I can't make critical mass.
I can't blow it.

694
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:16,115
Then crash it.

695
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:21,329
Yeah.

696
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:32,673
I'm okay. I'm okay.

697
01:23:34,301 --> 01:23:36,302
Really.

698
01:23:36,386 --> 01:23:38,805
I feel good.

699
01:23:38,889 --> 01:23:42,100
Ground level recalibrated.

700
01:23:42,184 --> 01:23:45,686
New destination:
7-6-0-4-0-3.

701
01:23:45,771 --> 01:23:48,231
Uninhabited quadrant.

702
01:23:48,315 --> 01:23:51,192
Braking systems off-lined.
Acceleration increase.

703
01:23:53,612 --> 01:23:57,198
Time until impact now
43 minutes, 8 seconds.

704
01:23:58,742 --> 01:24:01,285
Try to clear us a path
to the Betty...

705
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:04,205
and start her up.

706
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:06,290
Okay.

707
01:24:33,694 --> 01:24:35,820
Please wait.

708
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:44,370
Emergency override
in console 45V, Level 1 .

709
01:24:48,417 --> 01:24:51,544
It's Wren.
He's almost at the Betty.

710
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:07,393
Father, locate
the power drain. Report.

711
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:13,191
Father? Father!

712
01:25:18,447 --> 01:25:21,032
Father's dead, asshole.

713
01:25:24,286 --> 01:25:26,204
Intruder on Level 1 .

714
01:25:26,288 --> 01:25:30,333
All aliens,
please proceed to Level 1 .

715
01:25:30,417 --> 01:25:32,710
You got a mean streak.

716
01:25:37,174 --> 01:25:39,800
Damn it.
Let me see.

717
01:25:39,885 --> 01:25:42,178
- Don't touch me.
- Come on.

718
01:25:43,847 --> 01:25:46,265
You must think
this is pretty funny.

719
01:25:47,601 --> 01:25:50,645
I'm finding a lot ofthings
funny lately,

720
01:25:50,729 --> 01:25:52,772
but I don't think they are.

721
01:25:59,905 --> 01:26:02,740
Why do you go on living?

722
01:26:05,327 --> 01:26:07,745
How can you stand
being what you are?

723
01:26:09,122 --> 01:26:11,082
Not much choice.

724
01:26:15,379 --> 01:26:17,797
At least there's
a part ofyou that's human.

725
01:26:17,881 --> 01:26:22,134
I'm just— Look at me.

726
01:26:23,262 --> 01:26:25,304
I'm disgusting.

727
01:26:27,224 --> 01:26:29,642
Why did you come here?

728
01:26:29,726 --> 01:26:31,811
To kill you,
remember?

729
01:26:31,895 --> 01:26:34,188
Before the recall,

730
01:26:34,273 --> 01:26:36,274
I accessed the mainframe.

731
01:26:37,276 --> 01:26:40,611
Every dirty little covert op
the government ever
dreamed of is in there.

732
01:26:40,696 --> 01:26:44,407
And this-you, the aliens,

733
01:26:44,491 --> 01:26:48,494
even the crew from the Betty-
I knew ifthey succeeded,
it would be the end ofthem.

734
01:26:49,579 --> 01:26:51,664
Why do you care
what happens to them?

735
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:54,625
Because I'm programmed to.

736
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:57,753
You're programmed
to be an asshole?

737
01:26:58,797 --> 01:27:02,008
You're the new asshole model
they're putting out?

738
01:27:02,092 --> 01:27:03,509
Come on.

739
01:27:05,721 --> 01:27:08,389
I couldn't watch 'em do it.

740
01:27:08,473 --> 01:27:11,559
I couldn't let 'em
annihilate themselves.

741
01:27:11,643 --> 01:27:13,769
Do you understand that?

742
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:19,400
I did once.

743
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:22,153
I tried to save...
people.

744
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:25,906
It didn't work out.

745
01:27:25,991 --> 01:27:28,326
There was this girl.

746
01:27:30,829 --> 01:27:32,788
She had bad dreams.

747
01:27:33,999 --> 01:27:36,000
I tried to help her.

748
01:27:37,169 --> 01:27:39,170
She died.

749
01:27:40,297 --> 01:27:42,882
Now I can't even
remember her name.

750
01:27:47,763 --> 01:27:49,680
I guess we're almost there.

751
01:27:49,765 --> 01:27:51,807
Right.

752
01:27:52,976 --> 01:27:54,977
Do you dream?

753
01:27:55,062 --> 01:27:59,607
I— Well, we have
neuroprocessors that- Yes.

754
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:03,110
When I sleep,
I dream about them— it.

755
01:28:03,195 --> 01:28:07,490
Every night.
All around me, in me.

756
01:28:07,574 --> 01:28:10,910
I used to be
afraid to dream,
but I'm not anymore.

757
01:28:10,994 --> 01:28:13,579
Why?

758
01:28:13,663 --> 01:28:15,664
Because no matter
how bad the dreams get,

759
01:28:15,749 --> 01:28:17,875
when I wake up,
it's always worse.

760
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:25,591
It's not so far now!
God, I'm so tired.

761
01:28:25,675 --> 01:28:27,593
Sleep when you die, man.

762
01:28:39,189 --> 01:28:41,398
Oh, no. This is bad, right?

763
01:28:41,483 --> 01:28:45,361
- I think we're near the nest.
- Well, then we'll go another way.

764
01:28:45,487 --> 01:28:48,280
We don't have time.
We got nearly 90 minutes.

765
01:28:48,365 --> 01:28:50,407
- Not anymore.
- What are you saying?

766
01:28:50,492 --> 01:28:54,453
- What did you do, robot?
- Let's go. Come on.

767
01:28:54,538 --> 01:28:58,874
Hey! You want to die here
with your little brothers
and sisters, that's cool!

768
01:28:58,959 --> 01:29:01,377
But I plan to live past today!

769
01:29:01,461 --> 01:29:03,963
Ifthis little hunk of plastic
is pulling any shit,

770
01:29:04,047 --> 01:29:06,048
I'm gonna kill her!

771
01:29:07,092 --> 01:29:10,219
Kill you!
Does that compute?

772
01:29:10,303 --> 01:29:12,388
Or do I have to
drawyou a schematic?

773
01:29:12,514 --> 01:29:15,141
Hey!

774
01:29:17,644 --> 01:29:20,938
You want another souvenir?

775
01:29:26,653 --> 01:29:29,780
- How far are the docks?
- A h-hundred yards.

776
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:46,213
Ripley.

777
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:49,425
Come on.

778
01:29:49,509 --> 01:29:51,802
Ripley, we have to go.

779
01:29:53,388 --> 01:29:55,389
I hear them.

780
01:29:55,473 --> 01:29:58,184
I hear them.
They're so close.

781
01:29:58,268 --> 01:30:00,186
Ripley.
It's the queen.

782
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:03,439
She's in pain.

783
01:30:05,233 --> 01:30:07,776
Ripley!

784
01:30:08,987 --> 01:30:11,238
Ripley!

785
01:30:11,323 --> 01:30:13,324
Wait!

786
01:30:34,804 --> 01:30:36,555
Oh, my God.

787
01:30:49,319 --> 01:30:51,237
We gotta be moving.

788
01:30:51,321 --> 01:30:54,907
The best thing you can do
is pray for a quick death.

789
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:57,743
Come on. Come on.

790
01:30:57,827 --> 01:30:59,745
It's not right.

791
01:30:59,829 --> 01:31:02,206
I've been saying that all day.

792
01:31:59,514 --> 01:32:01,515
It's up to you now, Call.

793
01:32:01,599 --> 01:32:04,310
I need you to patch into
the ship again and open the hatch.

794
01:32:15,613 --> 01:32:18,449
Johner, we should put Purvis
in the freezer now.

795
01:32:18,533 --> 01:32:20,451
All right, little buddy.

796
01:32:21,786 --> 01:32:24,121
Nap time.

797
01:32:28,293 --> 01:32:30,878
Oh!

798
01:32:30,962 --> 01:32:33,088
Nobody moves,
or I put a cap...

799
01:32:33,173 --> 01:32:35,299
right where
this little droid's brain is.

800
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:38,177
Distephano, take the weapons.

801
01:32:38,261 --> 01:32:40,637
Begging your pardon, sir,
but fuckyou!

802
01:32:40,722 --> 01:32:44,475
Oh, fine. Then I kill her,
and you kill me,

803
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:47,561
and we all die,
and nobody goes home!

804
01:32:47,645 --> 01:32:50,481
Now drop the weapon.

805
01:32:54,736 --> 01:32:56,904
Then this little
synthetic bitch...

806
01:32:56,988 --> 01:32:59,323
is gonna plug into the Auriga,

807
01:32:59,407 --> 01:33:01,700
and she is gonna take us
right back to home base,

808
01:33:01,785 --> 01:33:04,244
according to the standard
emergency procedures.

809
01:33:04,329 --> 01:33:07,581
- No, she's not.
- Are you crazy?

810
01:33:07,665 --> 01:33:09,708
You still want to bring
those things back to Earth?

811
01:33:09,793 --> 01:33:13,462
- Haven't you been paying
any attention today?
- Ah, the intellectual speaks.

812
01:33:14,172 --> 01:33:15,964
Stay there!
Listen, ifyou don't—

813
01:33:16,049 --> 01:33:18,133
Don't you ever shut up?

814
01:33:30,397 --> 01:33:33,524
Why does nobody listen to me?

815
01:34:15,608 --> 01:34:19,611
I told you.
At first, everything was normal.

816
01:34:19,696 --> 01:34:22,739
The queen laid her eggs.
But then she started to change.

817
01:34:22,824 --> 01:34:25,534
She added a second cycle cell.

818
01:34:28,746 --> 01:34:30,747
So,

819
01:34:34,919 --> 01:34:38,297
this time there is no host.

820
01:34:38,381 --> 01:34:40,883
There are no eggs.

821
01:34:40,967 --> 01:34:44,678
There is only herwomb...

822
01:34:44,762 --> 01:34:47,556
and the creature inside.

823
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:50,517
That is Ripley's gift to her:

824
01:34:50,602 --> 01:34:54,354
a human reproductive system.

825
01:34:54,439 --> 01:34:57,733
She is giving birth
foryou, Ripley,

826
01:34:57,817 --> 01:35:01,445
and now she is perfect!

827
01:36:27,448 --> 01:36:30,784
You are...

828
01:36:30,868 --> 01:36:33,787
a beautiful,

829
01:36:33,871 --> 01:36:36,790
beautiful butterfly.

830
01:37:03,693 --> 01:37:06,278
No.

831
01:37:10,867 --> 01:37:12,326
No. No.

832
01:38:07,048 --> 01:38:09,633
Ah, look. Look.

833
01:38:09,717 --> 01:38:13,512
Beautiful, beautiful
little baby.

834
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:18,308
Look. It thinks
you're its mother.

835
01:38:20,853 --> 01:38:23,355
Come on.

836
01:38:23,439 --> 01:38:25,607
Come on.

837
01:38:28,986 --> 01:38:33,281
Yeah.

838
01:38:34,409 --> 01:38:37,452
Come on.

839
01:38:53,761 --> 01:38:56,054
Civilian vessel on line.

840
01:38:56,139 --> 01:38:58,306
Emergency departure
authorized.

841
01:39:02,270 --> 01:39:06,815
All right. She's hot.
I'll open the Auriga's air locks,
pull the holding clamps on your mark.

842
01:39:06,899 --> 01:39:09,568
Right. I-I just need
to find, uh, the, uh—

843
01:39:09,652 --> 01:39:12,362
th-the vertical thrust lock.

844
01:39:17,618 --> 01:39:20,495
Are you sure you guys
can fly this thing?
Yes!

845
01:39:34,927 --> 01:39:38,263
Launch status is go.
No!

846
01:39:40,057 --> 01:39:41,933
Ripley.

847
01:40:09,962 --> 01:40:12,714
- Hey.
- I thought you were dead.

848
01:40:12,799 --> 01:40:16,384
Yeah, I get that a lot.
Why are we still here?

849
01:40:16,469 --> 01:40:21,306
Uh, I'm just, uh, finding
the, uh, manual override.

850
01:40:21,390 --> 01:40:23,391
- For Christ's sake.
- Hey, Ripley.

851
01:40:23,476 --> 01:40:25,769
Good memory. Excuse me.

852
01:40:25,853 --> 01:40:27,270
Ripley's back, man.
Is that it?

853
01:40:27,355 --> 01:40:29,564
Nope.

854
01:40:29,649 --> 01:40:31,817
You can't fly one of
these things too, can you?

855
01:40:31,901 --> 01:40:35,028
Are you kidding?
This piece ofshit
is even older than I am.

856
01:40:35,112 --> 01:40:38,573
Goddamn it.
We've still got breach. The hatch.

857
01:40:38,658 --> 01:40:41,701
- I closed it.
- Fixed the goddamn hatch
a hundred times, man!

858
01:40:41,786 --> 01:40:44,496
I'll get it. I'll get it.

859
01:41:05,685 --> 01:41:08,520
Approaching Earth's atmosphere.

860
01:41:08,604 --> 01:41:12,941
Window ofdeparture
now 46 seconds.

861
01:41:14,443 --> 01:41:17,237
Call, we have to go.

862
01:41:17,321 --> 01:41:19,823
Call.

863
01:41:22,451 --> 01:41:24,703
We've gotta get out of here.

864
01:41:29,125 --> 01:41:33,044
Window ofdeparture
now 20 seconds.

865
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:40,302
Grab on to something, Call.
We're outta here.

866
01:41:55,651 --> 01:41:56,818
Come on, baby.

867
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:12,500
This thing is gonna fall apart.

868
01:42:13,502 --> 01:42:16,171
Pressure's unstable!

869
01:42:20,426 --> 01:42:23,803
Go help Call turn on
the auxiliary pump!

870
01:42:50,790 --> 01:42:52,290
Distephano?

871
01:43:13,813 --> 01:43:16,481
Come on! Step on it!

872
01:43:16,565 --> 01:43:19,275
Hey, I'm not the mechanic
here, Ironsides!

873
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:21,277
I mostlyjust hurt people!

874
01:43:22,321 --> 01:43:24,447
Shit. Call!

875
01:43:25,992 --> 01:43:28,785
Call, get back up here!

876
01:43:29,954 --> 01:43:32,414
Call! Call!

877
01:43:33,457 --> 01:43:37,127
Ripley!
Hey, Ripley!

878
01:43:41,924 --> 01:43:44,384
Johner, where are you,
you son ofa bitch?

879
01:43:44,468 --> 01:43:47,721
- Get on it, bastard!
- What am I supposed to do?

880
01:43:47,805 --> 01:43:49,764
Grab the sticks.

881
01:44:03,446 --> 01:44:05,113
Put her down.

882
01:44:24,759 --> 01:44:26,760
Oh.

883
01:45:42,878 --> 01:45:45,588
Ripley!

884
01:46:03,899 --> 01:46:06,860
Oh, no!

885
01:46:06,944 --> 01:46:09,487
Oh, no!

886
01:46:12,116 --> 01:46:14,450
I'm sorry.

887
01:46:17,121 --> 01:46:20,165
No!

888
01:46:44,648 --> 01:46:47,859
U.S.M. Auriga
will impact in five seconds.

889
01:46:47,943 --> 01:46:51,070
Four. Three.

890
01:46:51,155 --> 01:46:53,573
Two. One.

891
01:46:53,657 --> 01:46:54,782
Thankyou.

892
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:21,809
- What's burnin'?
- Us!

893
01:47:24,396 --> 01:47:28,358
Shit! You're right!

894
01:48:47,271 --> 01:48:49,355
So this is Earth, huh?

895
01:48:51,567 --> 01:48:53,568
This is Earth.

896
01:48:57,114 --> 01:48:59,157
This is
my first time here.

897
01:49:03,454 --> 01:49:07,832
I suppose the military will be
sniffing around here pretty soon.

898
01:49:07,916 --> 01:49:10,001
Bet you're not
too anxious to see them.

899
01:49:10,919 --> 01:49:12,837
Not really.

900
01:49:13,881 --> 01:49:16,966
You know,
a person could get pretty lost
around here ifthey wanted to.

901
01:49:19,136 --> 01:49:21,721
What do you think?

902
01:49:21,805 --> 01:49:23,931
What should we do?

903
01:49:25,309 --> 01:49:27,310
I don't know.

904
01:49:28,604 --> 01:49:30,813
I'm a stranger here myself.

905
01:56:05,542 --> 01:56:06,542
