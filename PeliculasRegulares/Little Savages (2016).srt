1
00:00:05,347 --> 00:00:08,871
<i>It's another
sunny day in Indiana, folks!</i>

2
00:00:08,931 --> 00:00:12,520
<i>It's 90 degrees and climbing.</i>

3
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:14,019
<i>So throw your kids in a lake,</i>

4
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:16,396
<i>because it's going
to be a hot one!</i>

5
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,378
<i>All right, now we're going
to try to beat the heat</i>

6
00:00:18,402 --> 00:00:20,421
<i>with another cool off.</i>

7
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:50,988
<i>Is science your life?</i>

8
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:54,156
<i>If you just nodded your head,</i>

9
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:56,077
<i>then you belong at our camp.</i>

10
00:00:56,131 --> 00:00:57,997
<i>Join us this summer
for some scierrific fun.</i>

11
00:01:06,531 --> 00:01:07,720
Hey, where's your brother?

12
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,563
You're going to look up
from that tiny little screen

13
00:01:11,587 --> 00:01:13,387
and your entire summer
is going to be gone.

14
00:01:13,442 --> 00:01:15,013
Why don't you just
throw me in a lake'?

15
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,515
What'?

16
00:01:19,042 --> 00:01:20,647
Go find your brother.

17
00:01:28,034 --> 00:01:29,834
<i>You want to make
your summer worthwhile?</i>

18
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:30,916
<i>Then sign up now!</i>

19
00:01:30,978 --> 00:01:32,681
<i>Yay!</i>

20
00:01:34,818 --> 00:01:37,481
Come on, we got to go.

21
00:01:37,507 --> 00:01:39,274
Let go of me.
I can walk on my own.

22
00:01:41,538 --> 00:01:44,011
I caught him watching that commercial
for the crazy science camp.

23
00:01:44,035 --> 00:01:45,771
It's not a commercial.
It's an advertisement.

24
00:01:45,795 --> 00:01:47,882
What's the difference? Did you
at least find a bathroom?

25
00:01:47,906 --> 00:01:49,096
No, I got sidetracked.

26
00:01:49,154 --> 00:01:52,482
Albie, do you remember the last
time you tried to hold it too long?

27
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:53,670
Mom, I'm fine.

28
00:02:02,115 --> 00:02:05,901
Hey, maybe I can go here
instead of science camp.

29
00:02:05,922 --> 00:02:07,876
Oh, honey, I'm sorry

30
00:02:07,938 --> 00:02:09,898
that science camp didn't
work out for this summer.

31
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:12,203
What am I going to do with that
chemistry set that Dad gave me'?

32
00:02:12,227 --> 00:02:14,954
Yeah, it's really too bad that he
can't go to his dorky science camp.

33
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,876
You know I'm committing
social suicide, right'?

34
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,348
Hashtag life stinks.

35
00:02:18,402 --> 00:02:20,170
Hey, now, you guys
are going to feel differently

36
00:02:20,194 --> 00:02:21,322
when we get to Aunt Jackie's.

37
00:02:21,346 --> 00:02:22,601
Hashtag doubtful.

38
00:03:13,122 --> 00:03:15,271
<i>Oh, shakafaka!</i>

39
00:03:15,331 --> 00:03:17,251
<i>That's one for the record books,
I'll tell you.</i>

40
00:03:17,314 --> 00:03:19,034
<i>And we'll come back
with a lift/e more music</i>

41
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:21,934
<i>after this quick
commercial break.</i>

42
00:03:21,986 --> 00:03:23,721
<i>Is science your life?</i>

43
00:03:23,778 --> 00:03:25,927
<i>If you just nodded your...</i>

44
00:03:25,986 --> 00:03:27,525
You belong at our camp.

45
00:03:27,586 --> 00:03:29,288
Oh, brother.

46
00:04:06,978 --> 00:04:10,851
Hi! Hey! Hey! Hi!

47
00:04:10,915 --> 00:04:12,901
Hey, I'm so glad to...

48
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:14,054
Look at this.

49
00:04:14,114 --> 00:04:15,685
It's doing it on its own.

50
00:04:16,962 --> 00:04:19,462
Please tell me we don't have
to be seen in public with her.

51
00:04:19,522 --> 00:04:21,508
Oh, Tiffany, please. Cut it out.

52
00:04:21,538 --> 00:04:22,564
Oh, yeah.

53
00:04:22,626 --> 00:04:24,329
Watch this. Watch me go.

54
00:04:24,386 --> 00:04:26,667
Yeah! Yeah! Come on.

55
00:04:28,962 --> 00:04:30,151
Watch this. Oh, yeah!

56
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,775
I can do the robot. Oh, yeah!

57
00:04:32,834 --> 00:04:34,602
<i>Oh, yeah! Watch!</i>

58
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:36,557
Come here, come here, come here.

59
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,083
Get over here.
Give me some sugar!

60
00:04:38,147 --> 00:04:40,580
Hey. No, seriously, kid.
You got any candy?

61
00:04:40,642 --> 00:04:41,930
You smell like Werthefis.

62
00:04:41,987 --> 00:04:43,492
So you're saying I'm old'?
Maybe.

63
00:04:43,555 --> 00:04:46,348
You know, I
used to look like her.

64
00:04:46,402 --> 00:04:48,322
Anyway, you are going to be
my new test subject

65
00:04:48,386 --> 00:04:51,529
for my comedy routine because
I can tell you are hilarious.

66
00:04:51,587 --> 00:04:53,965
Lookin' what-what'?

67
00:04:54,018 --> 00:04:55,044
Harassing him already?

68
00:04:55,106 --> 00:04:56,394
Of course!

69
00:04:56,643 --> 00:04:58,280
Hi. Good. Good ride.

70
00:04:58,338 --> 00:05:00,458
Thank you so much for letting
them come stay with you.

71
00:05:00,514 --> 00:05:02,663
Are you kidding? I'm so
excited to have them.

72
00:05:02,722 --> 00:05:04,075
Oh, my gosh. Are you excited?

73
00:05:04,323 --> 00:05:04,999
These look heavy.

74
00:05:05,058 --> 00:05:07,207
They're very heavy.
Okay, be careful then.

75
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:08,422
Thanks.

76
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,450
Okay, well...

77
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,421
So Luke and I,
we got this last-minute call

78
00:05:12,482 --> 00:05:15,592
to go do some
seismology research in the...

79
00:05:15,843 --> 00:05:17,894
Blah, blah, blah. You
lost me at seismology.

80
00:05:17,922 --> 00:05:19,242
My niece and nephew are here.

81
00:05:19,298 --> 00:05:20,651
It's really exciting.

82
00:05:20,706 --> 00:05:23,652
They're here! They're... kids!

83
00:05:23,682 --> 00:05:26,060
Kids...

84
00:05:26,114 --> 00:05:27,914
Well, you know, they
shouldn't be much trouble.

85
00:05:27,938 --> 00:05:29,957
I mean, Tiffany is 16.

86
00:05:30,018 --> 00:05:32,299
Well, she can't be any worse
than you were at that age.

87
00:05:32,354 --> 00:05:35,682
What'? No. I was a great child.
Shh, shh, shh, no.

88
00:05:35,746 --> 00:05:37,547
Acceptance is good.

89
00:05:37,602 --> 00:05:39,043
<i>You were a brat.</i>

90
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:40,546
Oh, come on.

91
00:05:40,803 --> 00:05:42,887
Which one is my room'?

92
00:05:42,946 --> 00:05:44,386
Tiffany, your manners.

93
00:05:45,634 --> 00:05:48,613
Just take whichever
room you like.

94
00:05:50,403 --> 00:05:52,072
Oh, she's driving me
absolutely crazy.

95
00:05:52,323 --> 00:05:54,756
Oh, let me tell you about Albie.

96
00:05:54,786 --> 00:05:56,554
Okay. Okay, he's very sensitive.

97
00:05:56,578 --> 00:05:58,477
Okay'? He has
a lot of allergies,

98
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,714
so he should probably just
stay inside most of the time.

99
00:06:00,738 --> 00:06:03,237
Or you'll be dealing
with a lot of problems

100
00:06:03,298 --> 00:06:05,830
<i>like drainage and mucus.
That's a little graphic.</i>

101
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,941
<i>Yeah. Where does
it</i> all <i>come from'?</i>

102
00:06:08,002 --> 00:06:09,922
He also has some trouble
making friends.

103
00:06:09,986 --> 00:06:11,110
So he likes to be alone.

104
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,661
<i>Yeah, he can be
a little awkward.</i>

105
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:18,699
He stays to himself a lot,

106
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:19,780
and that's fine.

107
00:06:19,842 --> 00:06:23,115
Don't worry if he doesn't
really engage with you.

108
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,090
He's Brilliant. How do you do?

109
00:06:25,122 --> 00:06:26,595
<i>He loves science</i>

110
00:06:26,658 --> 00:06:29,452
<i>and really learning
anything in a book.</i>

111
00:06:29,506 --> 00:06:31,241
<i>He's great.</i>

112
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:34,856
Okay, I think fresh air
will do him some good.

113
00:06:34,914 --> 00:06:36,834
No, he should really
probably just stay inside.

114
00:06:36,898 --> 00:06:38,054
No, he should go outside.

115
00:06:38,114 --> 00:06:39,914
Yeah, you should go outside.

116
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,574
Yep, that's it.
I'm kicking you out.

117
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:43,304
Go, go. But...

118
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:45,380
Tiffany? Albie'?

119
00:06:45,442 --> 00:06:46,442
I'm leaving.

120
00:06:47,234 --> 00:06:48,653
Goodbye.

121
00:06:48,706 --> 00:06:50,212
Bye. Bye.

122
00:06:50,274 --> 00:06:51,562
Be good.

123
00:06:51,618 --> 00:06:52,970
I'll see you
in a few weeks, okay'?

124
00:06:52,994 --> 00:06:54,914
Have fun.

125
00:06:56,866 --> 00:06:58,786
The bond between
a mother and her son,

126
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,236
it's just, I don't know.

127
00:07:00,482 --> 00:07:03,080
Okay, you be good, too.

128
00:07:03,138 --> 00:07:05,800
Okay.

129
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,462
Can't guarantee anything.

130
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,290
Bye. Bye.

131
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,582
<i>Yeah, they're safe with me.</i>

132
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,912
Have fun in the Grenadines.

133
00:07:22,018 --> 00:07:23,938
Whoa, it's warm up here.

134
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:27,405
<i>You've been carrying all those
books around in that bag?</i>

135
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,859
Honey, you're going
to get a hunchback.

136
00:07:29,922 --> 00:07:34,156
Master, tonight is time
we bring the creation to life.

137
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,010
Wow, looks like you've got
the tools to do it, too.

138
00:07:36,034 --> 00:07:38,085
This is pretty cool.

139
00:07:38,146 --> 00:07:41,190
There's that smile
I've been looking for.

140
00:07:41,218 --> 00:07:43,138
Hey, I got something
you might like.

141
00:07:45,186 --> 00:07:48,678
A book by Dr. Whittmore.
Did you know him'?

142
00:07:48,738 --> 00:07:51,749
Well, yeah, I know everyone in this town.

143
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,310
I think a
fairy just got its wings.

144
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,203
It's just Tiffany texting.

145
00:07:56,258 --> 00:07:57,513
Mmm.

146
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:00,648
Apparently my friend Abella's
stepmom's uncle's new wife

147
00:08:00,674 --> 00:08:01,612
has a boat on the lake.

148
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,172
And she asked me to come with.

149
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:05,002
You have a friend named Abella'?

150
00:08:05,057 --> 00:08:06,214
Oh, I love that name.

151
00:08:06,274 --> 00:08:08,325
Yeah.

152
00:08:08,386 --> 00:08:09,674
Oh, Abella is here.

153
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:12,043
Later. Oh, peace out.

154
00:08:12,098 --> 00:08:15,458
So what are you going to do
your first day of vacation'?

155
00:08:15,522 --> 00:08:17,540
This book looks informative.

156
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,490
Did you know that
that copy is signed

157
00:08:19,554 --> 00:08:21,322
by Dr. Whittmore himself?

158
00:08:21,377 --> 00:08:24,139
He gave it to our family
along, longtime ago.

159
00:08:24,194 --> 00:08:26,922
But can't let you
read it just yet.

160
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:28,516
Why not'?

161
00:08:28,578 --> 00:08:30,051
We have to rehearse.

162
00:08:30,114 --> 00:08:31,107
Huh?

163
00:08:31,138 --> 00:08:33,037
Yeah.

164
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,563
We have an audition
in 20 minutes.

165
00:08:40,322 --> 00:08:43,912

Amazing.

173
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:14,026
Did you write that'?

174
00:09:14,082 --> 00:09:16,427
No. Oh.

00:09:16,482 --> 00:09:20,203
"Many mumbling mice"

176
00:09:20,258 --> 00:09:23,880
"are making merry music

177
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,127
You're on in 10, Mr. Savage.

178
00:09:25,186 --> 00:09:26,441
Thank you, Ted.

179
00:09:26,498 --> 00:09:27,753
It's Cheryl.

180
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,545
Really? Mm-hmm.

181
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,167
Oh.

182
00:09:32,226 --> 00:09:35,172
Next up, Eday Savage.

183
00:09:35,202 --> 00:09:36,202
Oh, French.

184
00:09:36,257 --> 00:09:37,611
Eddie Savage.

185
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:38,666
Eddie Savage?

186
00:09:38,882 --> 00:09:39,908
That's not French at all.

187
00:09:42,754 --> 00:09:45,220
Hi.

188
00:09:45,282 --> 00:09:47,715
Ladies and gentlemen of Culver,

189
00:09:47,777 --> 00:09:50,123
I will now magically
right before your eyes

190
00:09:50,178 --> 00:09:53,451
bake a cake.

191
00:10:01,506 --> 00:10:03,274
Well, that's disgusting.

192
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,843
Oh, that's... that had
better be gluten-free.

193
00:10:33,857 --> 00:10:35,527
Now...

194
00:10:37,442 --> 00:10:39,362
Ladies and gentlemen... No.

195
00:10:39,426 --> 00:10:40,615
Luive you...

196
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:41,798
No, no, don't.

197
00:10:41,858 --> 00:10:43,462
Cake!

198
00:10:46,082 --> 00:10:47,687
Why would you even?

199
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,229
Ta-da!

200
00:10:55,106 --> 00:10:56,776
Next!

201
00:10:56,801 --> 00:10:58,058
You might want to clean that up.

202
00:10:58,082 --> 00:10:59,786
Okay, so first thing
we got to do is sign in,

203
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,731
and then were going
to scope out the competition.

204
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,627
Hello there,

205
00:11:03,682 --> 00:11:05,351
ventriloquist boy.

206
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,526
Oh, yes. What is he, like six'?

207
00:11:07,586 --> 00:11:09,256
Dude, we got this.

208
00:11:10,689 --> 00:11:12,392
<i>Wow, look at her.</i>

209
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:15,975
In her little baton
twirling, sequined dress.

210
00:11:17,442 --> 00:11:18,980
That's our competition.

211
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,745
What the frick
is going on, Garrison?

212
00:11:28,802 --> 00:11:30,373
<i>It's a summer competition.</i>

213
00:11:30,401 --> 00:11:32,518
It's the auditions.
Oh, one time,

214
00:11:32,577 --> 00:11:34,148
I was at a Denny's
with my family.

215
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,050
We just got up in the
middle of the restaurant,

216
00:11:36,098 --> 00:11:37,517
started singing
the national anthem.

217
00:11:37,569 --> 00:11:39,489
It was Presidents' Day.
I was feeling patriotic.

218
00:11:39,554 --> 00:11:41,954
And when I was done,
standing ovation.

219
00:11:42,017 --> 00:11:43,109
Nice. Yeah.

220
00:11:45,346 --> 00:11:47,911
You know, I'm thinking about
going into the talent show.

221
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,803
Check this out. What
would your talent be'?

222
00:11:51,138 --> 00:11:52,807
Hey.

223
00:11:52,866 --> 00:11:54,820
Hey, your ball'?
Your ball went in there'?

224
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:57,381
Oh, let's see. Oh, right there.

225
00:11:57,442 --> 00:11:58,730
Boo!

226
00:12:04,482 --> 00:12:06,184
Right'? Right'?

227
00:12:06,242 --> 00:12:08,195
Oh, <i>I</i> get it. Whoo!

228
00:12:08,226 --> 00:12:09,285
I get it. I get it.

229
00:12:09,346 --> 00:12:12,805
You'd be going as a ghost
who stuffs kids in trash cans.

230
00:12:15,714 --> 00:12:16,969
What'?

231
00:12:22,082 --> 00:12:24,265
Okay. Sorry I ruined it.

232
00:12:24,321 --> 00:12:26,122
What are you talking about'?

233
00:12:26,177 --> 00:12:28,840
That was... That was hilarious.

234
00:12:28,898 --> 00:12:30,852
It was, you know...
We were okay.

235
00:12:30,914 --> 00:12:32,394
Hey, I got to go
to the grocery store.

236
00:12:32,642 --> 00:12:34,180
So you want to hang here

237
00:12:34,242 --> 00:12:36,042
and you know,
meet me by the boat

238
00:12:36,098 --> 00:12:37,571
in say, half an hour?

239
00:12:38,018 --> 00:12:40,483
I don't know.
What don't you know?

240
00:12:40,546 --> 00:12:42,250
You got to get out there.
You got to make friends.

241
00:12:42,274 --> 00:12:43,692
You got to be a man about town.

242
00:12:43,746 --> 00:12:45,769
Hey, if you see Tiffany you
tell her to meet me by the boat

243
00:12:45,793 --> 00:12:47,561
by five o'clock, okay'?
No later.

244
00:12:47,618 --> 00:12:49,931
Five o'clock. Have fun.

245
00:12:54,946 --> 00:12:57,859
Yeah, I know, right'?

246
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,592
Oh, man. Oh!

247
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,766
So you here for the whole summer?
I don't know.

248
00:13:01,826 --> 00:13:03,786
Yeah, my dad won't tell me
why we came back out here.

249
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,447
I remember when
you used to live here.

250
00:13:05,506 --> 00:13:06,506
You were tiny.

251
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,363
That's 'cause I was six.

252
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:20,963
Huh, look what we have here.

253
00:13:21,026 --> 00:13:22,630
A little... Dweeb.

254
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,195
No one says "dweeb" anymore.

255
00:13:24,258 --> 00:13:25,960
What are you doing here, dweeb'?

256
00:13:26,017 --> 00:13:27,937
Technically, I'm more
of a bookworm.

257
00:13:28,002 --> 00:13:29,507
"Dweeb" is vintage, all right'?

258
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:30,661
It's totally in.

259
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:32,359
Your mom is vintage.
Okay, shut up.

260
00:13:32,417 --> 00:13:33,858
No one plays your mom anymore.

261
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:35,306
Come on, I asked you a question.

262
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:36,268
What are you doing here?

263
00:13:36,321 --> 00:13:37,511
I was auditioning.

264
00:13:37,569 --> 00:13:39,523
He's auditioning.

265
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:41,452
I know what he
was auditioning for.

266
00:13:41,473 --> 00:13:43,787
He was auditioning
for a-a-a dweeb!

267
00:13:48,226 --> 00:13:49,830
What...

268
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:53,571
A science book?

269
00:13:53,634 --> 00:13:55,755
This kid's got a science book
in the middle of summer.

270
00:13:55,809 --> 00:13:58,341
I mean, how much of a loser
do you got to be'?

271
00:13:58,401 --> 00:14:00,300
You know, this kid from the...

272
00:14:00,354 --> 00:14:01,707
You know what I'm saying?

273
00:14:01,954 --> 00:14:03,874
Right'? Right'? Whoa!

274
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:06,372
Oh, you didn't.

275
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:09,739
If you do not leave him be,
I will cast a spell on you

276
00:14:09,794 --> 00:14:10,950
<i>that will tum you purple</i>

277
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,483
<i>and then green</i>

278
00:14:12,545 --> 00:14:14,412
and I will put hair on your back

279
00:14:14,465 --> 00:14:16,385
<i>and boils on your face.</i>

280
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:19,527
An evil mutant plague shall be cast
upon you and your entire family.

281
00:14:19,586 --> 00:14:21,124
I'm not touching him.

282
00:14:24,194 --> 00:14:26,594
Is this how you saw this going?

283
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:29,287
No. Can I admit something?

284
00:14:29,346 --> 00:14:30,851
If you must.

285
00:14:30,914 --> 00:14:32,933
I don't really know magic.

286
00:14:32,994 --> 00:14:34,248
Good to know.

287
00:14:36,258 --> 00:14:37,763
<i>Whoa!</i>

288
00:14:46,818 --> 00:14:48,618
What's up, Aaron?

289
00:14:48,673 --> 00:14:50,408
The lake is pretty clean.

290
00:14:55,393 --> 00:14:56,964
I love summer.

291
00:14:57,026 --> 00:14:58,052
I hate it.

292
00:14:58,113 --> 00:14:59,913
I just want to leave.

293
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,836
Hey, there are two things
you should know.

294
00:15:01,857 --> 00:15:03,974
Number one, never let
anyone see you cry in public.

295
00:15:04,033 --> 00:15:05,539
And the second thing'?

296
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:08,296
Well, look at the bright side.

297
00:15:08,354 --> 00:15:10,220
Now we get to have our revenge.

298
00:15:10,274 --> 00:15:11,433
And how are we
going to do that'?

299
00:15:11,457 --> 00:15:13,257
Well, my cousins, the Savages.

300
00:15:13,314 --> 00:15:14,602
Who?

301
00:15:14,658 --> 00:15:16,490
They live
on the outskirts of town

302
00:15:16,513 --> 00:15:18,084
beyond the junkyard.

303
00:15:18,146 --> 00:15:20,907
Some say they
were born of Vikings,

304
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,526
raised by wolves
and trained samurai...

305
00:15:23,585 --> 00:15:24,706
Can I stop you right there'?

306
00:15:24,737 --> 00:15:27,083
Samurai haven't
been around since 1871.

307
00:15:27,138 --> 00:15:28,970
Oh, did I say samurai?

308
00:15:28,993 --> 00:15:31,274
I meant covert ninjas.

309
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:32,519
Ch-ch-ch-ch-chow!

310
00:15:32,577 --> 00:15:35,404
I'll pass. I just want
to be left alone.

311
00:15:38,177 --> 00:15:41,866
We shall be avenged!

312
00:15:43,329 --> 00:15:44,966
He's not on Facebook.

313
00:15:45,026 --> 00:15:46,280
Are you for reals'? I know.

314
00:15:46,338 --> 00:15:47,778
I was like, "I can't believe"

315
00:15:47,841 --> 00:15:49,129
"you don't have the Internet."

316
00:15:49,186 --> 00:15:50,408
And he says,

317
00:15:50,465 --> 00:15:51,687
"I have the Internet."

318
00:15:51,746 --> 00:15:52,935
"I just don't have Facebook."

319
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,394
I'm confused.
It doesn't make sense.

320
00:15:55,457 --> 00:15:57,705
How am I ever supposed to figure
out his relationship status'?

321
00:15:57,729 --> 00:16:00,643
That's what I'm saying.
Excuse me.

322
00:16:00,706 --> 00:16:01,928
Oh, my aunt is here.

323
00:16:01,954 --> 00:16:03,045
Great. Later.

324
00:16:03,105 --> 00:16:04,164
Bye. Bye.

325
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:09,162
Do you two not own a watch'?

326
00:16:09,186 --> 00:16:11,237
Huh'? Seriously,
you're like 20 minutes late.

327
00:16:11,297 --> 00:16:14,920
Uh, no. Only old
people wear watches.

328
00:16:14,946 --> 00:16:16,331
Oops.

329
00:16:16,354 --> 00:16:17,794
Oh. Oh, Well...

330
00:16:17,857 --> 00:16:19,276
lucky for me

331
00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:21,512
I don't own a watch.

332
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:22,824
Oops.

333
00:16:23,074 --> 00:16:24,297
Aunt Jackie, Abella just wrote.

334
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:25,417
Can I have dinner with her'?

335
00:16:25,441 --> 00:16:26,947
Yeah, yeah.

336
00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:29,443
Please, go have dinner with her.

337
00:16:29,506 --> 00:16:31,110
Thanks, bye. Bye.

338
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:36,069
I'll miss you.

339
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:38,955
So it looks like it's just
me and you for dinner.

340
00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:40,068
What you say, Albie'?

341
00:16:40,322 --> 00:16:42,438
Sure. Sure, okay.

342
00:16:42,497 --> 00:16:45,672
Hey, I see finally decided
to go for a swim.

343
00:16:45,729 --> 00:16:47,748
Proud of you.

344
00:16:48,002 --> 00:16:49,028
It wasn't by choice.

345
00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:51,555
Oh, well then I take it back.

346
00:16:51,617 --> 00:16:52,938
Clutz.

347
00:17:03,585 --> 00:17:05,484
<i>Well-known philanthropist.</i>

348
00:17:05,537 --> 00:17:08,167
<i>We all knew Mr. Whittmore
was a bit of an eccentric.</i>

349
00:17:08,225 --> 00:17:09,546
<i>He once said in an interview</i>

350
00:17:09,601 --> 00:17:11,685
<i>that he never really fit in.</i>

351
00:17:11,746 --> 00:17:13,929
<i>Interesting news
in regards to his will</i>

352
00:17:13,985 --> 00:17:16,811
<i>is surfacing now,
a year after his passing.</i>

353
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:17,860
<i>Thank you, Daisy.</i>

354
00:17:17,921 --> 00:17:19,875
<i>We'll have more
as that story develops.</i>

355
00:17:19,937 --> 00:17:21,607
Why do you think it took so long

356
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,651
to release Mr. Whittmore's
final statement?

357
00:17:23,714 --> 00:17:25,830
I don't know the logistics
behind it all,

358
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,803
but the news that Mr. Whittmore
has hidden a treasure chest

359
00:17:28,866 --> 00:17:30,765
containing a sizable amount
of his estate

360
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:32,290
has officially been released.

361
00:17:32,354 --> 00:17:33,707
Do you think it was a final ploy

362
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:36,227
to increase tourism in this
town he loved and called home?

363
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:39,051
Culver doesn't need any more
tourists during the summer.

364
00:17:39,105 --> 00:17:40,011
We do fine already.

365
00:17:40,065 --> 00:17:43,273
But it is buried here in Culver.
Yes.

366
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:44,802
And Mr. Whittmore hid clues

367
00:17:44,865 --> 00:17:46,698
to help one
lucky individual find it'?

368
00:17:46,754 --> 00:17:48,194
That's right.

369
00:17:48,257 --> 00:17:50,723
Well, I think we can expect
our little town

370
00:17:50,785 --> 00:17:52,902
to get a bit busier
over the next few days.

371
00:17:52,961 --> 00:17:54,249
I'm Daisy Larson,

372
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:55,561
Channel 11 News.

373
00:17:56,641 --> 00:17:59,304
Now, Mr. Whittmore was known
for being an inventor,

374
00:17:59,361 --> 00:18:01,958
but he was actually a very
accomplished businessman.

375
00:18:02,018 --> 00:18:04,167
In fact, he gave loans
to other businessmen

376
00:18:04,225 --> 00:18:06,092
hoping to better the community.

377
00:18:06,145 --> 00:18:08,775
Have you ever been
to Whittmore's root beer stand'?

378
00:18:08,834 --> 00:18:10,274
No. No'?

379
00:18:10,337 --> 00:18:12,040
Well, Mr. Whittmore

380
00:18:12,066 --> 00:18:13,833
gave a man named Fritz Bronson

381
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:16,716
a sizable loan
to start the root beer stand.

382
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,926
With your contributions

383
00:18:17,986 --> 00:18:19,623
I'd like to open
a root beer stand

384
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:23,555
where patrons can enjoy a nice
cold beverage during the summer.

385
00:18:23,586 --> 00:18:27,175
That sounds like the best
idea I've ever heard.

386
00:18:27,234 --> 00:18:29,482
<i>He just loved the idea
of seeing the community flourish.</i>

387
00:18:29,537 --> 00:18:31,851
He wanted that to be his legacy.

388
00:18:44,801 --> 00:18:48,228
All right.

389
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:50,188
The root beer stand
was very popular.

390
00:18:50,241 --> 00:18:52,522
But Fritz was always looking
for a way to make more money.

391
00:18:52,577 --> 00:18:55,883
So he wanted to sell the root
beer stand to turn a profit.

392
00:18:55,937 --> 00:18:58,698
But Dr. Whittmore didn't want
something that the community enjoyed

393
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,554
to go away,

394
00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:02,595
so he bought it from Fritz.

395
00:19:02,657 --> 00:19:04,457
I've never had root beer.

396
00:19:04,481 --> 00:19:06,500
You've never had root beer.

397
00:19:06,529 --> 00:19:08,516
Okay, I don't even know
what to say to that.

398
00:19:08,577 --> 00:19:09,636
I'm going to take you.

399
00:19:09,697 --> 00:19:11,203
I think I'm allergic.

400
00:19:11,265 --> 00:19:14,408
Maybe you will meet some new
friends and they can take you.

401
00:19:15,361 --> 00:19:17,260
I don't think people
like me here.

402
00:19:17,313 --> 00:19:19,233
Why would you say that'?

403
00:19:19,265 --> 00:19:22,757
This boy kind of threw me
in the lake.

404
00:19:31,202 --> 00:19:32,620
That's the guy.

405
00:19:34,305 --> 00:19:36,521
<i>Oh, Billy Bronson.</i>

406
00:19:47,266 --> 00:19:49,993
It's pretty late. Sorry,
I lost track of time.

407
00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:52,361
I don't think you should be
hanging out with kids like Billy.

408
00:19:52,385 --> 00:19:54,889
Okay. Tiffany, if you don't learn
to function without that thing,

409
00:19:54,913 --> 00:19:56,484
your brain is going
to turn into mush.

410
00:19:56,545 --> 00:19:58,412
Tiffany. Yeah.

411
00:19:58,465 --> 00:19:59,978
Why would you want
to hang outwith people

412
00:20:00,002 --> 00:20:02,402
who think it's cool to throw
kids in the lake'? Jackie!

413
00:20:02,465 --> 00:20:04,266
You whiny little tattletale.

414
00:20:04,321 --> 00:20:05,513
<i>Billy just said
they were having fun.</i>

415
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:06,890
That is your brother.

416
00:20:06,945 --> 00:20:08,745
Just leave me alone, okay'?

417
00:20:08,801 --> 00:20:10,089
I don't even want to be here.

418
00:20:10,145 --> 00:20:12,743
You know, just because
Mom and Dad are too busy for us

419
00:20:12,801 --> 00:20:13,897
doesn't mean they
just dump us here.

420
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,940
Okay, that's unfair.
Life is unfair.

421
00:20:22,273 --> 00:20:23,659
They're not too busy.

422
00:20:27,489 --> 00:20:29,475
Maybe we all
just need some sleep.

423
00:20:29,537 --> 00:20:31,108
<i>Come on.</i>

424
00:20:52,129 --> 00:20:53,002
Get dressed.

425
00:20:53,057 --> 00:20:55,240
Grandma needs an oil change.

426
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:56,715
My pontoon boat,

427
00:20:56,769 --> 00:20:57,991
I named her Grandma

428
00:20:58,017 --> 00:20:59,141
after my grandma.

429
00:20:59,201 --> 00:21:00,555
She needs an oil change.

430
00:21:00,609 --> 00:21:01,701
Get dressed.

431
00:21:21,793 --> 00:21:23,154
Yeah. What was I
telling you, man'?

432
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:26,409
They just ran off.
It was so great.

433
00:21:26,433 --> 00:21:29,543
And I was like,
that's not his hand.

434
00:21:29,601 --> 00:21:31,718
<i>Walk away. Walk away.</i>

435
00:21:31,777 --> 00:21:34,090
<i>I was like, whoa.</i>

436
00:21:34,113 --> 00:21:35,302
Oh, man.

437
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:36,998
I need you to tune this up.

438
00:21:37,057 --> 00:21:38,217
Yeah, I need it in tip top shape

439
00:21:38,241 --> 00:21:40,260
for this weekend's
Wave Runner competition.

440
00:21:40,321 --> 00:21:41,961
Yeah, we've got a heavy
workload this week,

441
00:21:41,985 --> 00:21:43,145
but I can take
a look at it for you.

442
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:44,970
Well, you take
a look at it then.

443
00:21:45,025 --> 00:21:46,630
In the meantime,
we'll be out there

444
00:21:46,689 --> 00:21:48,169
smashing it up
in my new Master craft.

445
00:21:48,193 --> 00:21:49,895
Oh, yeah, the green one,
number 25.

446
00:21:49,953 --> 00:21:51,393
It's the green one behind you.

447
00:21:51,457 --> 00:21:52,417
It's so fast.

448
00:21:52,481 --> 00:21:53,419
Yeah, it's nice.

449
00:21:53,473 --> 00:21:54,565
How fast is it, Harley?

450
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:57,703
It's like a cheetah
on a treadmill. Just...

451
00:21:59,681 --> 00:22:01,548
Oh, I totally know.

452
00:22:01,601 --> 00:22:03,206
Well, let me incline real quick.

453
00:22:03,265 --> 00:22:04,454
You know?

454
00:22:04,513 --> 00:22:07,372
It's like that, bro.
It's like that, bro.

455
00:22:10,081 --> 00:22:11,783
That makes no sense.

456
00:22:11,809 --> 00:22:14,537
What was that'?

457
00:22:14,561 --> 00:22:15,783
<i>He said something.</i>

458
00:22:15,841 --> 00:22:17,412
Are you challenging me, bro'?

459
00:22:17,441 --> 00:22:19,492
Because I see you
in your competition

460
00:22:19,554 --> 00:22:22,532
coming in third, fourth.

461
00:22:22,593 --> 00:22:25,001
I had a messed up ankle, but I could
take you any day of the week.

462
00:22:25,025 --> 00:22:26,563
<i>Oh-ho! Did you hear that?</i>

463
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,196
Any day of the week.

464
00:22:28,257 --> 00:22:29,926
<i>Okay, we can
go out there right now.</i>

465
00:22:29,985 --> 00:22:31,687
Yeah? Yeah.

466
00:22:31,745 --> 00:22:33,163
Yeah? Go ahead.

467
00:22:36,641 --> 00:22:37,732
I can't. I'm working.

468
00:22:37,793 --> 00:22:39,692
You can't because
you know you'd lose.

469
00:22:46,177 --> 00:22:47,050
That's a crow.

470
00:22:47,105 --> 00:22:49,025
It's a chicken-crow, bro.

471
00:22:51,457 --> 00:22:53,803
Billy, anytime after hours.

472
00:22:53,857 --> 00:22:56,323
Yeah, well, after you
tune up my Wave Runner.

473
00:22:58,305 --> 00:23:01,961
Yeah.

474
00:23:02,017 --> 00:23:03,719
I was going to get the yellow.

475
00:23:03,777 --> 00:23:05,577
You were going to get it yellow?
Yeah, yellow.

476
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:06,855
I like green, Billy. Yeah.

477
00:23:06,913 --> 00:23:08,550
You always make good decisions.

478
00:23:11,073 --> 00:23:12,426
I'll be here about 30 minutes

479
00:23:12,481 --> 00:23:16,169
so why don't you go outside and play'?

480
00:23:16,225 --> 00:23:17,830
Do you even know
what "go play" means?

481
00:23:17,889 --> 00:23:19,395
It means get out of here.
Go be a kid.

482
00:23:19,457 --> 00:23:20,711
Go.

483
00:23:44,641 --> 00:23:46,246
Here it is.

484
00:23:46,305 --> 00:23:48,172
Oh, okay.

485
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:49,830
It fell off.

486
00:23:51,105 --> 00:23:53,288
Shazam.

487
00:23:53,345 --> 00:23:54,345
Yes!

488
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:56,419
Oh.

489
00:23:56,481 --> 00:23:59,078
No, I didn't like it.

490
00:24:00,257 --> 00:24:01,348
Okay.

491
00:24:01,377 --> 00:24:02,566
You know, but I mean,

492
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:04,044
you put in some effort.

493
00:24:04,097 --> 00:24:06,181
So. Well, there's that.

494
00:24:06,241 --> 00:24:07,943
Extra point. That's something.

495
00:24:09,985 --> 00:24:12,200
Trespasser! Let's get him!

496
00:24:12,257 --> 00:24:13,894
Hey, hey, hey. It's okay.

497
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,622
I know him.

498
00:24:15,681 --> 00:24:16,969
Let him prove himself.

499
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,577
So you do any tricks'?

500
00:24:20,641 --> 00:24:23,336
I don't have a bike
like you guys.

501
00:24:23,393 --> 00:24:24,964
He doesn't have a bike.

502
00:24:25,025 --> 00:24:28,233
Eddie, get him
Old Man Kettle's bike.

503
00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:30,341
Oh.

504
00:24:30,401 --> 00:24:31,820
Not sure if he could handle.

505
00:24:31,873 --> 00:24:34,121
Old Man Kettle's bike.

506
00:24:34,177 --> 00:24:37,483
Wait, is this the kid that cried
when he got tossed in the lake?

507
00:24:37,537 --> 00:24:38,563
That's him.

508
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:39,879
<i>Oh, where are my manners?</i>

509
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:42,436
Albie, this is Winnie

510
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,166
and Vinny. Hi.

511
00:24:44,225 --> 00:24:46,341
They're my cousins.

512
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,452
Who was Old Man Kettle'?

513
00:24:48,513 --> 00:24:51,077
He's Culver's only homeless person.
Yeah.

514
00:24:51,136 --> 00:24:53,220
<i>He ditched his bike
on the side of the road</i>

515
00:24:53,281 --> 00:24:54,787
before he disappeared.

516
00:24:54,849 --> 00:24:56,322
Guess who found the bike.

517
00:24:56,385 --> 00:24:57,771
Him?

518
00:24:57,825 --> 00:24:58,851
Mm-mm.

519
00:24:58,913 --> 00:25:00,867
I did.

520
00:25:00,929 --> 00:25:01,929
She did. He did.

521
00:25:03,105 --> 00:25:04,578
We did.

522
00:25:04,641 --> 00:25:05,994
Sometimes I see her thoughts.

523
00:25:06,241 --> 00:25:08,161
Yeah, and sometimes it's creepy.

524
00:25:08,193 --> 00:25:10,113
Old Man Kettle
didn't have any teeth.

525
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:12,556
Legend has it he lost them

526
00:25:12,608 --> 00:25:13,608
riding his bike.

527
00:25:14,593 --> 00:25:16,513
She's a tough ride.

528
00:25:16,577 --> 00:25:18,214
Why don't you go get it for him'?
Yeah.

529
00:25:18,273 --> 00:25:20,837
Oh, yeah.

530
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:23,974
I've always wondered why he keeps
wearing that top hat and cape.

531
00:25:24,033 --> 00:25:25,637
He goes through phases.

532
00:25:25,696 --> 00:25:28,708
Yeah, last month, he thought he was
a professional baseball player.

533
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:30,406
Now he thinks he's a magician.

534
00:25:30,465 --> 00:25:33,411
And next month, he's probably going
to think he's a sumo wrestler.

535
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:40,907
Well, if you're up for a race,

536
00:25:40,961 --> 00:25:42,761
<i>I'm sure Old Man Kettle
wouldn't mind</i>

537
00:25:42,817 --> 00:25:44,836
you borrowing his bike.

538
00:25:44,896 --> 00:25:47,690
And I was a professional
baseball player.

539
00:25:47,745 --> 00:25:49,545
Um, I don't think
I'm going to ride that.

540
00:25:49,601 --> 00:25:51,074
If you want to hang
with the Savages,

541
00:25:51,137 --> 00:25:52,425
you kind of have to race us.

542
00:25:52,481 --> 00:25:54,696
Are you here to bike
or be a sissy?

543
00:25:54,752 --> 00:25:56,171
No.

544
00:25:56,225 --> 00:25:57,829
Hey, you allergic
to bikes, too'?

545
00:26:00,193 --> 00:26:01,546
<i>There you go.</i>

546
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,521
<i>Come on, race Winnie.</i>

547
00:26:03,585 --> 00:26:04,971
She's a girl.

548
00:26:05,025 --> 00:26:07,371
Hey. That's debatable.

549
00:26:07,425 --> 00:26:09,292
Yeah. All right, I'll do it.

550
00:26:09,345 --> 00:26:10,818
That a boy.

551
00:26:10,849 --> 00:26:12,551
All right, so...

552
00:26:12,609 --> 00:26:14,660
down the hill,
through the dirt track,

553
00:26:14,721 --> 00:26:16,041
and hang a left
at the graveyard.

554
00:26:16,097 --> 00:26:17,417
First person back wins.

555
00:26:17,473 --> 00:26:17,986
I got this.

556
00:26:18,241 --> 00:26:20,195
Did he say graveyard?

557
00:26:20,257 --> 00:26:21,578
Dead people live there.

558
00:26:21,632 --> 00:26:24,066
Woo... Ready...

559
00:26:24,129 --> 00:26:26,049
set... go!

560
00:26:28,257 --> 00:26:29,446
Let's go.

561
00:26:30,849 --> 00:26:32,387
<i>I bet 20 bucks on Winnie.</i>

562
00:26:59,776 --> 00:27:01,696
He's like an expert on that.

563
00:27:17,089 --> 00:27:18,115
Ah!

564
00:27:18,177 --> 00:27:19,235
Oh!

565
00:27:19,297 --> 00:27:20,297
My'

566
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,692
You okay?

567
00:27:26,753 --> 00:27:28,586
Old Man Kettle's bike is a hog.

568
00:27:28,641 --> 00:27:29,830
You were flying.

569
00:27:29,888 --> 00:27:31,591
Did that hurt'?

570
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:32,904
It was amazing.

571
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:34,626
Albie is a champ.

572
00:27:34,688 --> 00:27:36,707
I want a rematch.

573
00:27:36,961 --> 00:27:38,118
You could have won.

574
00:27:38,176 --> 00:27:39,176
I know.

575
00:27:40,801 --> 00:27:42,154
Welcome to the Savages.

576
00:27:44,353 --> 00:27:45,858
You okay'? I'm good.

577
00:27:47,649 --> 00:27:51,435
All righty, so we changed
the oil on the pontoon.

578
00:27:51,489 --> 00:27:53,988
Okay. And we did a routine
maintenance check.

579
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:55,911
And it turns out it had bad gas.

580
00:27:56,161 --> 00:27:58,213
Oh, poor Grandma.

581
00:27:58,273 --> 00:27:59,561
That happens when you get older.

582
00:27:59,585 --> 00:28:02,247
Ba-dam-bam! Hmm?

583
00:28:05,153 --> 00:28:06,758
Hey, how much do I owe you'?

584
00:28:06,817 --> 00:28:08,803
I already fixed you.
You're good to go.

585
00:28:08,865 --> 00:28:11,014
No extra charge? No,
consider it on the house.

586
00:28:11,072 --> 00:28:13,026
Todd, you're the best.
Thank you.

587
00:28:13,088 --> 00:28:14,594
Of course. Hello.

588
00:28:14,656 --> 00:28:16,456
Hey, Todd. Winnie fell
off her bike.

589
00:28:16,513 --> 00:28:19,274
Oh, Oh. I didn't fall. I flew.

590
00:28:19,329 --> 00:28:20,617
All right, thank you.

591
00:28:20,672 --> 00:28:21,833
Here, let me help you with that.

592
00:28:21,857 --> 00:28:23,461
Here, let's see it.

593
00:28:25,153 --> 00:28:26,244
Are you a nurse?

594
00:28:26,305 --> 00:28:28,389
No, no.

595
00:28:28,448 --> 00:28:29,889
I'm more of a comedian.

596
00:28:29,953 --> 00:28:32,201
Oh. OW.

597
00:28:32,225 --> 00:28:33,665
You know what'?

598
00:28:33,729 --> 00:28:35,881
That looks bad. I don't think
this is going to do the trick.

599
00:28:35,905 --> 00:28:36,712
I'll tell you what.

600
00:28:36,801 --> 00:28:39,081
Why don't you all
come back to my house,

601
00:28:39,137 --> 00:28:41,003
and I can clean up your knee

602
00:28:41,057 --> 00:28:43,589
and I can feed you all dinner.

603
00:28:43,649 --> 00:28:45,515
Truth is, I make a mean lasagna.

604
00:28:45,536 --> 00:28:47,107
Score!

605
00:28:47,169 --> 00:28:49,384
I love people who feed me.

606
00:28:49,441 --> 00:28:51,176
Thank you.

607
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,826
Hey. Good morning.

608
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,646
Could you tell Billy
to come in for appetizers?

609
00:29:12,705 --> 00:29:14,440
Where is he'?

610
00:29:14,465 --> 00:29:16,385
Outback.

611
00:29:16,448 --> 00:29:19,110
Aw, geez.

612
00:29:29,857 --> 00:29:32,650
Billy!

613
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:33,578
What are you doing?

614
00:29:33,632 --> 00:29:36,011
What is that, yoga'?

615
00:29:36,033 --> 00:29:37,473
Dinner! Let's go!

616
00:29:37,537 --> 00:29:39,435
Oh, here I come, Dad.

617
00:29:39,488 --> 00:29:41,158
I'll be right there.

618
00:29:45,793 --> 00:29:48,041
Dinner already?

619
00:29:48,065 --> 00:29:49,865
I've only done
five turnarounds, Dad.

620
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,583
What's the kid doing?
He's out there like this.

621
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,665
He looks like... who rides
a jet ski on their back'?

622
00:29:54,689 --> 00:29:55,911
It's summer.

623
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:57,383
It's what they do.

624
00:29:57,409 --> 00:29:59,428
Like a repulsive seal.

625
00:29:59,489 --> 00:30:00,711
What are you doing?

626
00:30:00,961 --> 00:30:02,249
It's cheese time, Mr. Fritz.

627
00:30:02,305 --> 00:30:03,331
Oh, it is cheese time'?

628
00:30:03,392 --> 00:30:07,943
It's cheese time. Can
you make a quesadilla'?

629
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,768
Yes. Okay, go do it.

630
00:30:09,825 --> 00:30:11,723
<i>So I met with the mayor today.</i>

631
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:14,096
Did you'? Mm-hmm, and I'm finally
going to be able to prove

632
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:17,320
once and for all that that
root beer stand is mine.

633
00:30:17,377 --> 00:30:20,901
Why'? Why can't we
just go back to Chicago?

634
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:23,553
Billy, use your dome, okay'?

635
00:30:23,616 --> 00:30:26,595
The Whittmore treasure hunt
is about to begin any day now.

636
00:30:26,657 --> 00:30:29,221
And I know that he hid
a clue in that root beer stand.

637
00:30:29,281 --> 00:30:30,502
He did love that thing.

638
00:30:30,753 --> 00:30:33,153
Who likes root beer'? You
drink root beer'? Yeah.

639
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,690
You do. Mm-hmm.

640
00:30:34,753 --> 00:30:35,877
Who else drinks root beer'?

641
00:30:35,936 --> 00:30:37,126
<i>Every-everyone, really.</i>

642
00:30:37,185 --> 00:30:39,749
The community absolutely
loves it there, Fritz.

643
00:30:41,696 --> 00:30:42,755
They love it.

644
00:30:44,193 --> 00:30:45,577
Here's what
we're going to do, okay'?

645
00:30:45,601 --> 00:30:47,305
Okay. You and your friends
are going to start

646
00:30:47,329 --> 00:30:48,617
digging around there, okay'?
Okay.

647
00:30:48,641 --> 00:30:50,245
Once the first clue is released.

648
00:30:50,305 --> 00:30:52,040
We'll just make it look
like you found it.

649
00:30:52,096 --> 00:30:55,752
Wait, so that means you
know where the treasure is'?

650
00:30:55,809 --> 00:30:57,089
Do I know where
the treasure is'?

651
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:58,691
Yeah, do you know where it is'?

652
00:30:58,753 --> 00:31:00,869
No. Where? It's buried.

653
00:31:00,896 --> 00:31:02,402
Guess where it's buried. Where?

654
00:31:02,433 --> 00:31:04,866
Deep in a seashell in the ocean.

655
00:31:04,928 --> 00:31:06,882
And there's a big man
with a gray beard

656
00:31:06,945 --> 00:31:08,549
<i>named Neptune,
and he's holding it.</i>

657
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:10,213
<i>Isn't that exciting?</i>

658
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,753
Billy, grow up.
You believe in unicorns'?

659
00:31:11,777 --> 00:31:13,609
I don't know where it is!

660
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:16,295
What are you, five?

661
00:31:16,352 --> 00:31:18,152
How much sun did you get today'?

662
00:31:19,265 --> 00:31:22,124
Uh, I don't know.

663
00:31:22,145 --> 00:31:24,610
You're wearing
lime green shorts.

664
00:31:24,673 --> 00:31:25,961
When you wear lime shorts,

665
00:31:26,016 --> 00:31:27,653
what do you look like?

666
00:31:27,713 --> 00:31:30,757
What did I tell you'?

667
00:31:30,785 --> 00:31:32,869
Sn-snowcone.

668
00:31:33,121 --> 00:31:34,343
You look like a snow cone.

669
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,379
What are you doing? You want
to be a human snow cone?

670
00:31:37,441 --> 00:31:38,881
Now, why do you
have to do that'?

671
00:31:38,944 --> 00:31:40,169
I don't want to be a snow cone.

672
00:31:40,193 --> 00:31:41,514
Kid looks like a snow cone.

673
00:31:41,761 --> 00:31:43,812
Fritz. He wears lime green.

674
00:31:46,945 --> 00:31:48,614
This is a nice house.

675
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,666
Kind of old.

676
00:31:49,729 --> 00:31:51,529
I think it was built
in the 1800s.

677
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,801
Yikes. What'?

678
00:31:56,832 --> 00:32:00,292
You didn't tell me you had
an older sister. Oh, sorry.

679
00:32:00,353 --> 00:32:03,397
It's just... Look.

680
00:32:03,425 --> 00:32:04,811
Hey, can I help?

681
00:32:06,913 --> 00:32:08,266
Uh, I'm good.

682
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:11,202
See what I mean'?

683
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:13,185
Hormones.

684
00:32:13,441 --> 00:32:14,663
<i>Is that a kind of food?</i>

685
00:32:14,689 --> 00:32:15,627
'Cause I'll eat it.

686
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,830
Okay, here we go.

687
00:32:17,888 --> 00:32:21,510
Now, where does spaghetti
go to dance'?

688
00:32:21,536 --> 00:32:23,336
At the meatball.

689
00:32:27,008 --> 00:32:28,514
Oh, I know, I know.

690
00:32:28,577 --> 00:32:30,377
It's just torturelini.

691
00:32:31,936 --> 00:32:33,158
Oh, my ride is here. Bye.

692
00:32:33,216 --> 00:32:34,792
I thought you were going
to have dinner with us.

693
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:37,031
Uh, mmm, delicious.

694
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:37,961
Thanks for dinner.

695
00:32:38,016 --> 00:32:40,003
Teenagers.

696
00:32:41,665 --> 00:32:43,367
Okay, who's going
to say the blessing?

697
00:32:43,424 --> 00:32:44,232
I Will!

698
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,543
You're on.

699
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,432
Dear God,

700
00:32:47,489 --> 00:32:48,994
Please bless the lasagna,

701
00:32:49,057 --> 00:32:50,057
<i>my brother Todd,</i>

702
00:32:50,113 --> 00:32:51,979
<i>sister Winnie, cousin Eddie,</i>

703
00:32:52,033 --> 00:32:53,506
<i>and Albie and all his allergies,</i>

704
00:32:53,761 --> 00:32:55,681
<i>the nice older lady
that's feeding us,</i>

705
00:32:55,744 --> 00:32:57,163
and Old Man Kettle.

706
00:32:57,216 --> 00:32:59,170
He's probably dead
in a ditch somewhere.

707
00:32:59,232 --> 00:33:00,935
But if not, please let him know

708
00:33:00,992 --> 00:33:03,687
we have his bike and we're taking
really good care of it for him.

709
00:33:03,745 --> 00:33:05,447
Amen.

710
00:33:05,504 --> 00:33:06,628
Amen.

711
00:33:06,689 --> 00:33:09,700
Okay, thank you, Vinny,

712
00:33:09,761 --> 00:33:12,139
said the nice older lady.

713
00:33:12,193 --> 00:33:13,481
I'm happy-

714
00:33:13,505 --> 00:33:15,850
Yeah, well, I'm glad someone is.

715
00:33:15,904 --> 00:33:17,824
Mayor Coleman, what did he say'?

716
00:33:17,888 --> 00:33:19,307
Please, please.

717
00:33:19,361 --> 00:33:22,820
Straight from the will
of Mr. Whittmore.

718
00:33:22,849 --> 00:33:25,129
It says that I, the mayor,

719
00:33:25,185 --> 00:33:28,644
Richard Coleman,
am to read the first clue

720
00:33:28,704 --> 00:33:30,952
on the first year anniversary

721
00:33:31,201 --> 00:33:32,674
of Mr. Whittmore's passing.

722
00:33:32,736 --> 00:33:35,333
The first clue is as follows.

723
00:33:35,393 --> 00:33:38,950
"The truly great are remembered
by their compassion

724
00:33:39,008 --> 00:33:40,928
"and generosity to others,

725
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,433
"not by their accomplishments

726
00:33:42,496 --> 00:33:44,199
"and awards they receive

727
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:46,821
"in their image." Thank you.

728
00:33:46,849 --> 00:33:48,616
Mayor Coleman, what do
you think that means?

729
00:33:48,673 --> 00:33:49,829
That will be all for now.

730
00:33:49,889 --> 00:33:50,952
Are there any other clues'?

731
00:33:50,976 --> 00:33:52,613
That will be all
for now. Thank you.

732
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:24,643
Chug, chug, chug!

733
00:34:30,144 --> 00:34:31,399
Oh! Oh, my gosh.

734
00:34:31,456 --> 00:34:32,897
You enjoy nothing.

735
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,439
What did you do'?

736
00:34:42,496 --> 00:34:44,362
You're such an idiot.

737
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,762
<i>Oh, really? Yeah, that's right.</i>

738
00:34:48,193 --> 00:34:52,099
All right, you got it'?

739
00:34:52,128 --> 00:34:54,726
They released
the first clue last night.

740
00:34:54,752 --> 00:34:56,390
I think we should get to work.

741
00:34:56,641 --> 00:34:58,824
When I was reading
Mr. Whittmore's book last night,

742
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,779
I saw this really weird symbol

743
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:02,917
that seems like it has to do
with the treasure.

744
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:06,762
How is that going to help us
with our revenge on Billy'?

745
00:35:06,816 --> 00:35:07,842
Yeah.

746
00:35:09,473 --> 00:35:10,727
I don't get girls.

747
00:35:10,752 --> 00:35:12,040
I really don't know either.

748
00:35:12,097 --> 00:35:13,097
Tell me about it.

749
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:14,441
When I look at myself
in the mirror,

750
00:35:14,465 --> 00:35:16,483
I'm like, "I don't get you."

751
00:35:16,512 --> 00:35:18,182
Yeah. I'm going to
go talk to her.

752
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,186
Whoa, only a fool
rushes into relationships.

753
00:35:21,248 --> 00:35:23,809
If you want more relationship
advice, just come to me at any time

754
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,377
except for Sunday, Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

755
00:35:26,401 --> 00:35:27,874
I'm free on Saturdays.

756
00:35:27,936 --> 00:35:29,322
How is he related to us'?

757
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,598
No idea. Anytime, my friend.

758
00:35:30,656 --> 00:35:33,515
He's already going
through another phase.

759
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:38,631
The green one. Yeah.

760
00:35:38,881 --> 00:35:40,386
So fast. Such a cool boat.

761
00:35:40,448 --> 00:35:43,241
<i>Have a great day. Enjoy!</i>

762
00:35:43,296 --> 00:35:45,282
Ha, Tiffany,
it looks like your brother

763
00:35:45,345 --> 00:35:48,650
needs his diaper changed.

764
00:35:48,704 --> 00:35:51,782
Albie, why don't you go
back over with your friends?

765
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,445
Okay?

766
00:35:53,504 --> 00:35:54,945
Hey, congratulations, little guy.
Go.

767
00:35:54,976 --> 00:35:56,577
You became friends
with the untouchables.

768
00:35:56,609 --> 00:35:58,213
Dude, you shouldn't
congratulate someone

769
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,528
for becoming friends with them.

770
00:35:59,584 --> 00:36:01,189
Here's my fries.

771
00:36:01,248 --> 00:36:02,536
<i>Ra-ra-ra-ra-ra.</i>

772
00:36:02,592 --> 00:36:04,807
I will destroy
all of our friends.

773
00:36:04,864 --> 00:36:06,402
<i>Dude, it's sarcasm.</i>

774
00:36:06,432 --> 00:36:08,069
All right'?
It's the latest rage.

775
00:36:08,129 --> 00:36:09,155
Well, what is sarcasm?

776
00:36:09,216 --> 00:36:10,121
Is that like a shop,

777
00:36:10,176 --> 00:36:11,911
because my mom
buys all my clothes.

778
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:13,474
Go away.

779
00:36:13,537 --> 00:36:15,785
Go.

780
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,826
I mean, what-what
is wrong with that kid'?

781
00:36:17,888 --> 00:36:19,426
She hates me, too.

782
00:36:19,488 --> 00:36:22,467
Vinny, the book. Get the book.

783
00:36:22,529 --> 00:36:24,395
<i>Oh, right. Speaking of revenge,</i>

784
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:27,013
here's a funny way
to make that feeling

785
00:36:27,072 --> 00:36:29,899
that you feel inside
of you right now disappear,

786
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,174
go <i>away.</i>

787
00:36:31,232 --> 00:36:32,705
<i>Vanish.</i>

788
00:36:32,768 --> 00:36:36,195
Through revenge on the Bronsons.

789
00:36:36,256 --> 00:36:37,478
Here's the plan.

790
00:36:39,105 --> 00:36:41,418
We kill them with the
mustard and ketchup.

791
00:36:41,472 --> 00:36:43,339
How... no, no.

792
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,640
Just spritz it all over them
to make them humiliated.

793
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:48,391
How can you not see that'?
I've written it out perfectly.

794
00:36:48,449 --> 00:36:50,689
How would you even kill someone
with mustard and ketchup?

795
00:36:53,761 --> 00:36:56,325
I mean, you guys did put
a single eyes.

796
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:01,991
Hey. Hi.

797
00:37:02,048 --> 00:37:03,488
What are you doing?

798
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,247
I had an idea for a song lyric.

799
00:37:06,304 --> 00:37:06,915
So you're a singer.

800
00:37:06,976 --> 00:37:10,217
No.

801
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,192
Okay.

802
00:37:12,256 --> 00:37:15,366
I-I am a singer.

803
00:37:15,424 --> 00:37:17,770
And funny, too. I..

804
00:37:17,824 --> 00:37:22,145
Cool, you should try out for
the talent show competition.

805
00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:23,845
I thought
the additions were over.

806
00:37:23,904 --> 00:37:25,704
Well, they're going
until the end of the day,

807
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,746
so maybe you should try out.

808
00:37:29,056 --> 00:37:30,377
Maybe I will.

809
00:37:31,553 --> 00:37:33,255
Hey, Billy. Todd.

810
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,001
Todd just went down there, yes.

811
00:37:36,064 --> 00:37:37,482
By Tiffany.

812
00:37:37,536 --> 00:37:40,068
Right down there.

813
00:37:40,128 --> 00:37:42,312
And-and if you want to go to
the festival with anybody...

814
00:37:42,336 --> 00:37:43,754
Yeah, with me'?

815
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,063
That... that would be great.

816
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,750
Oh, no.

817
00:37:47,808 --> 00:37:49,129
You see, Todd, Tiffany is...

818
00:37:49,185 --> 00:37:52,360
Tiffany is like a...
Like a... like a

819
00:37:52,417 --> 00:37:54,632
"it" girl.

820
00:37:54,688 --> 00:37:57,831
And you're just a it...

821
00:37:58,081 --> 00:38:00,001
Boy? Go Billy!

822
00:38:00,064 --> 00:38:01,930
Oh, yeah, so that head
injury, like, I had...

823
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,336
I was playing football.
I got a head injury.

824
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,997
You're completely
out of it, Harley.

825
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,312
What'? You're
completely out of it.

826
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:08,256
No, no. You just zone out.

827
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,055
No, I...

828
00:38:10,112 --> 00:38:12,032
Huh'? What'?

829
00:38:12,064 --> 00:38:13,064
Are you... What'?

830
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,888
We shouldn't even be here.
What'? What'?

831
00:38:14,944 --> 00:38:17,290
And besides, <i>What?</i>

832
00:38:17,312 --> 00:38:20,171
I got two tickets to the
Shades concert this Wednesday.

833
00:38:20,192 --> 00:38:22,658
Front row seats. Sorry, doofus!

834
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,001
Hey, watch your language.
This is a lady.

835
00:38:25,056 --> 00:38:26,952
Oh, yeah'? What are you
going to do about it, huh'?

836
00:38:26,976 --> 00:38:28,547
Ha ha, you hear that, Harley?

837
00:38:28,801 --> 00:38:29,477
<i>What?</i>

838
00:38:29,536 --> 00:38:31,435
You know,

839
00:38:31,681 --> 00:38:33,732
I could make one phone call

840
00:38:33,792 --> 00:38:35,712
and you could be
someone of the past, gone.

841
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,892
Poof. Who are you
going to call'?

842
00:38:37,952 --> 00:38:39,687
The...

843
00:38:39,744 --> 00:38:41,414
History Channel?

844
00:38:42,816 --> 00:38:44,453
Someone stole
a town statue. Come on!

845
00:38:49,024 --> 00:38:50,497
<i>Billy!</i>

846
00:38:51,328 --> 00:38:52,933
I will get you, Billy.

847
00:38:54,016 --> 00:38:55,237
Hey.

848
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,819
Hey, wait, this is...

849
00:38:59,873 --> 00:39:01,127
This is the clue. This is...

850
00:39:01,184 --> 00:39:03,498
Listen, I found the clue.

851
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,458
I found it!

852
00:39:04,512 --> 00:39:05,931
Come on, let's go! Come on!

853
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,476
Let's go! Now!

854
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,426
All right. It's got to be
somewhere around here.

855
00:39:15,488 --> 00:39:17,921
Do you guys think the cops
have any idea who stole this'?

856
00:39:17,984 --> 00:39:19,305
Wait, you guys stole it'?

857
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,608
I thought you said
you guys were borrowing it.

858
00:39:21,632 --> 00:39:23,138
Whoa, whoa, it's not stealing

859
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,488
if we plan to return it.

860
00:39:24,544 --> 00:39:26,824
Yeah. Yeah.

861
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,445
Just try not to get your
fingerprints all over it, guys.

862
00:39:29,504 --> 00:39:30,758
Oh, what'?

863
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:32,715
I watch OS! And Oops.

864
00:39:32,768 --> 00:39:35,081
We never getaway.

865
00:39:35,136 --> 00:39:36,555
That has
nothing to do with this.

866
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:39,270
Tiffany is just mad because
she never has this much fun.

867
00:39:39,328 --> 00:39:41,195
I mean,
have you seen her brother?

868
00:39:41,216 --> 00:39:42,754
He's all like...

869
00:39:42,816 --> 00:39:44,355
Yeah, he's all...

870
00:39:46,272 --> 00:39:47,974
That's a... That's a sheep.

871
00:39:48,032 --> 00:39:49,669
Don't look freaked out, Tiffany.

872
00:39:49,728 --> 00:39:51,816
Just think about all the money
that we're going to split.

873
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,312
Hey, who said anything about
splitting the money with the girls?

874
00:39:54,336 --> 00:39:55,591
Shht! Hey, hey...

875
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,586
Shht, shht!

876
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,310
Hey, hey, hey.

877
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,579
I found something.

878
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,302
Look what I found.
What is that'?

879
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,379
<i>Hoo! What is that?</i>

880
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,819
<i>I don't know but this
has made us more friends.</i>

881
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,607
Are those numbers?

882
00:40:09,664 --> 00:40:12,042
Hey!

883
00:40:12,096 --> 00:40:13,155
Hey, Dad.

884
00:40:13,216 --> 00:40:14,984
<i>We were...</i>

885
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,288
We're just...
What are you rats doing?

886
00:40:18,912 --> 00:40:21,258
We were... We were just...

887
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,673
Well, well, well.

888
00:40:24,736 --> 00:40:27,431
Looks like my son does have
some brains after all.

889
00:40:27,488 --> 00:40:28,488
Hey, hey.

890
00:40:28,544 --> 00:40:29,898
Partner. Yeah.

891
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:32,680
Who knew my kid had a brain?
Well, I do.

892
00:40:32,736 --> 00:40:34,024
What's the deal with the statue?

893
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,480
I don't know. It's a statue.

894
00:40:36,544 --> 00:40:38,693
Actually, I did...
I found this ring.

895
00:40:38,752 --> 00:40:40,651
I think it's Mr. Whittmore's.

896
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,828
It has numbers on it.

897
00:40:41,888 --> 00:40:44,233
You know what that looks
like to me'? Huh'?

898
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:46,208
A whole lot of nothing.

899
00:40:46,272 --> 00:40:47,713
But you know what'?

900
00:40:47,776 --> 00:40:49,511
Between the five brain cells
you have here

901
00:40:49,568 --> 00:40:50,888
I think you'll figure it out.

902
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:52,297
We will.

903
00:40:52,352 --> 00:40:53,923
Yeah, or end up in jail.

904
00:40:56,032 --> 00:40:58,182
Excuse me'?

905
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,811
Who's this'?

906
00:40:59,872 --> 00:41:02,120
Who'? Her'? She's...

907
00:41:02,176 --> 00:41:03,497
A friend.

908
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,627
Come here.

909
00:41:08,896 --> 00:41:11,296
What have I told
you about pretty girls?

910
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:15,424
Don't trust them.

911
00:41:15,487 --> 00:41:17,190
And watch your credit cards.

912
00:41:17,216 --> 00:41:19,681
Okay.

913
00:41:19,744 --> 00:41:21,893
Noodle. Noodle.

914
00:41:21,952 --> 00:41:24,866
Use sunscreen today'? <i>Yeah.</i>

915
00:41:24,928 --> 00:41:26,117
Use sunscreen.

916
00:41:26,176 --> 00:41:27,878
All right. Nice to meet you.

917
00:41:30,656 --> 00:41:32,740
Listen. It says
when the heavens open up,

918
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,405
it reveals a truth

919
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:36,581
even through the mark'?

920
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,554
I think it has something to do with
the sun reflecting off the water.

921
00:41:40,928 --> 00:41:42,249
Guys, look.

922
00:41:42,304 --> 00:41:43,941
It's Mr. Whittmore's
floating dock.

923
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:47,241
Hey, you think that's it, Albie'?
Maybe.

924
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:49,762
<i>Wait, guys. Catch it for me.
Catch it for me.</i>

925
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,744
I think I can get it. All
right, there you go.

926
00:41:51,776 --> 00:41:53,314
I think I've got it.

927
00:41:53,376 --> 00:41:54,598
Careful. We've got it.

928
00:41:55,712 --> 00:41:57,665
<i>There you go, okay.</i>

929
00:41:57,727 --> 00:41:59,462
Vinny, Vinny.
I'm getting on, too.

930
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,124
Okay, now Eddie. There you go.

931
00:42:01,184 --> 00:42:03,170
<i>All right, I got it. Go for if.</i>

932
00:42:03,232 --> 00:42:05,797
Ask Albie. Albie, what are we
supposed to be looking for'?

933
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,395
This box, I think. I don't know.

934
00:42:07,456 --> 00:42:08,929
Just something.

935
00:42:10,592 --> 00:42:11,880
That's so pretty!

936
00:42:13,984 --> 00:42:16,712
Winnie! Winnie!
Where did she go'?

937
00:42:16,768 --> 00:42:18,754
Winnie! Winnie! She jumped in.

938
00:42:18,816 --> 00:42:21,380
<i>Winnie! Winnie!</i>

939
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,247
Winnie!

940
00:42:22,304 --> 00:42:23,363
Winnie.

941
00:42:28,928 --> 00:42:31,722
How long was that'? How long
did I hold my breath for'?

942
00:42:31,776 --> 00:42:33,795
Really?

943
00:42:35,616 --> 00:42:36,260
Okay. Whoa.

944
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,563
Yes!

945
00:42:38,624 --> 00:42:40,391
Cannonball! Oh!

946
00:42:41,664 --> 00:42:42,886
Come on, Todd!

947
00:42:42,944 --> 00:42:44,712
All right, the more the merrier!
Here we go!

948
00:42:48,224 --> 00:42:49,991
Come on, Albie.
What's the hold up'?

949
00:42:50,048 --> 00:42:52,001
Yeah.

950
00:42:52,064 --> 00:42:54,726
I'm allergic to algae
and certain breeds of trout.

951
00:42:54,752 --> 00:42:56,771
Okay, hold on.

952
00:42:56,832 --> 00:42:59,080
I think I just kicked a fish.

953
00:42:59,136 --> 00:43:00,641
I just ate an hour ago.

954
00:43:00,704 --> 00:43:03,683
And I read something about how
you should let your food digest.

955
00:43:06,304 --> 00:43:07,362
Yay!

956
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,972
I'm fine. I think I'm fine.

957
00:43:16,032 --> 00:43:17,254
I'm fine.

958
00:43:17,311 --> 00:43:18,730
Wait, there's something here.

959
00:43:27,552 --> 00:43:28,993
Where did Albie go'?

960
00:43:29,056 --> 00:43:30,056
Albie'? Albie'?

961
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,511
Guys, guys, look.
I found something.

962
00:43:34,432 --> 00:43:35,432
What is it'?

963
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,404
There we go. Okay.

964
00:43:42,464 --> 00:43:44,134
All right, what is it'?

965
00:43:44,191 --> 00:43:46,024
It's a box. I just found
it under the dock.

966
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,912
<i>Guys, this could be it.</i>

967
00:43:47,936 --> 00:43:49,540
Like a movie. Open it up.

968
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,749
Let's see what's inside the
box, inside the boxie.

969
00:43:51,808 --> 00:43:54,373
It's another box. What'?

970
00:43:54,432 --> 00:43:55,938
Is that real gold? Looks to be.

971
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,676
<i>Is there any way?</i>

972
00:44:00,736 --> 00:44:02,373
Wait.

973
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,330
Wait, there's something here.

974
00:44:04,384 --> 00:44:07,265
It... I can't read it.
I can't make it out.

975
00:44:07,327 --> 00:44:09,859
Don't worry. We'll find
out a way to open it.

976
00:44:12,672 --> 00:44:14,592
Hello, Culver, Daisy Larson here

977
00:44:14,655 --> 00:44:17,536
reporting to you live
from the Lake Fest Talent Show.

978
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,848
Five minutes to show time!

979
00:44:19,872 --> 00:44:21,509
Hey, come on, guys. Have a seat.

980
00:44:21,568 --> 00:44:22,790
Get in, get in.

981
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,040
Come on.

982
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:27,370
Okay, here we go.

983
00:44:27,424 --> 00:44:29,323
It's exciting.

984
00:44:29,376 --> 00:44:31,427
Albie.

985
00:44:32,704 --> 00:44:33,704
What'?

986
00:44:34,207 --> 00:44:35,528
Come here.

987
00:44:38,688 --> 00:44:40,488
What'?

988
00:44:40,544 --> 00:44:41,896
Do you know how to
open the case yet'?

989
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,458
No, I'm not going to pull it out

990
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,636
in front of all these people,
but I'm working on it.

991
00:44:45,696 --> 00:44:47,562
Pssssstttt, be gone!

992
00:44:47,616 --> 00:44:50,497
Mr. Savage, I would
think that a talented...

993
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,546
Scratch that, a classic
performer like yourself

994
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,365
would adhere
to the time-honored tradition

995
00:44:55,424 --> 00:44:59,210
of keeping the show
behind the curtain

996
00:44:59,264 --> 00:45:02,537
until it's ready to begin.
Sorry, Mr. Riggs.

997
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:10,210
Mr. Hanson, are you
Marilyn or Madonna,

998
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:12,138
because that mole
is inexplicable.

999
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:13,578
I told you.

1000
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,892
Hi. Are you nervous?

1001
00:45:17,952 --> 00:45:19,141
Yeah, kind of.

1002
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,902
Good.

1003
00:45:20,928 --> 00:45:22,182
I mean, you should be.

1004
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,837
Because if you're bad today,

1005
00:45:24,895 --> 00:45:26,663
you know we can't
hang out anymore, right'?

1006
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,332
Why'? You should know, Tiffany.

1007
00:45:31,392 --> 00:45:32,614
Image is everything.

1008
00:45:32,671 --> 00:45:35,999
But look on the bright side.

1009
00:45:36,063 --> 00:45:37,417
If you do suck,

1010
00:45:37,471 --> 00:45:39,010
at least you have
your little brother

1011
00:45:39,072 --> 00:45:42,051
and all of his friends
you can hang outwith.

1012
00:45:42,112 --> 00:45:43,433
I'll take that back.

1013
00:45:45,311 --> 00:45:47,231
And you should probably
fix your hair.

1014
00:45:47,296 --> 00:45:49,828
It looks a little...

1015
00:45:49,888 --> 00:45:51,754
Well, good luck.

1016
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:07,816
Greetings! Greetings, Culver.

1017
00:46:07,872 --> 00:46:10,567
Welcome to the talent show.

1018
00:46:10,623 --> 00:46:13,929
My name is Ryan Riggs.

1019
00:46:13,984 --> 00:46:17,640
Thank you. Lam the
director of the show.

1020
00:46:17,695 --> 00:46:19,365
And before we begin,

1021
00:46:19,424 --> 00:46:21,322
I would just like
to start off by saying

1022
00:46:21,375 --> 00:46:24,136
a little something
that I prepared.

1023
00:46:25,567 --> 00:46:28,873
The magic doesn't begin

1024
00:46:28,928 --> 00:46:30,760
until the audience has arrived.

1025
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,033
That's you. You're the magic.

1026
00:46:37,792 --> 00:46:39,046
Okay, all right.

1027
00:46:39,071 --> 00:46:41,930
First up, we have...

1028
00:46:41,984 --> 00:46:44,450
Eddie Savage. If we could
have a big round of applause

1029
00:46:44,512 --> 00:46:45,636
for Eddie Savage.

1030
00:46:45,664 --> 00:46:48,261
Eddie!

1031
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,306
Yeah!

1032
00:46:50,335 --> 00:46:52,168
Don't mess this up for me.

1033
00:46:52,224 --> 00:46:53,828
I won't, sir.

1034
00:46:53,888 --> 00:46:55,176
Okay.

1035
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:58,887
Ladies and gentlemen of Culver,

1036
00:46:58,944 --> 00:47:01,126
my first magic trick,

1037
00:47:01,184 --> 00:47:03,683
I'm going to cook a chicken

1038
00:47:03,744 --> 00:47:05,446
inside of my hat.

1039
00:47:05,504 --> 00:47:08,166
<i>Oh, okay. That's a new one.</i>

1040
00:47:14,016 --> 00:47:16,100
Just need to tenderize
the meat a little bit.

1041
00:47:26,911 --> 00:47:31,233
Now, with the wave
of my magic wand,

1042
00:47:31,296 --> 00:47:35,050
I will turn this raw chicken

1043
00:47:35,103 --> 00:47:36,544
into a cooked chicken.

1044
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,087
<i>Eww!</i>

1045
00:47:46,144 --> 00:47:47,562
<i>Come on!</i>

1046
00:47:47,616 --> 00:47:48,937
Yeah.

1047
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:52,581
Well, that was
such a good attempt.

1048
00:47:52,608 --> 00:47:55,237
Yay! Whoo! Such
great effort, yeah!

1049
00:47:55,296 --> 00:47:56,682
Let me try that again.

1050
00:47:56,704 --> 00:47:59,683
I probably didn't
tenderize it enough.

1051
00:47:59,744 --> 00:48:01,282
Okay.

1052
00:48:03,168 --> 00:48:06,278
Happy, laugh.

1053
00:48:06,335 --> 00:48:07,972
He is so funny.

1054
00:48:08,032 --> 00:48:10,694
Wow. Oh, wow.

1055
00:48:10,752 --> 00:48:16,328
Let's have another round of applause
for Eddie Savage and his chicken.

1056
00:48:17,759 --> 00:48:19,397
Yeah.

1057
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:22,728
Oh. That's a little harsh.

1058
00:48:22,784 --> 00:48:26,570
All right, next up we have...
Cheryl.

1059
00:48:26,591 --> 00:48:28,490
We have...

1060
00:48:28,544 --> 00:48:30,279
Tiffany Peterson.

1061
00:48:30,335 --> 00:48:32,255
A big hand for Tiffany Peterson.

1062
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,760

Tiffany!

1096
00:50:33,888 --> 00:50:35,077
It's opening.

1097
00:50:35,104 --> 00:50:37,024
What'? It's opening!

1098
00:50:39,071 --> 00:50:42,825
We found the key! Wha'?

1099
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,542
I am not surprised.

1100
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:46,723
Is that the Whittmore key'?

1101
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:52,487
Tiffany, we've got to go.

1102
00:50:52,511 --> 00:50:54,977
Um, yeah, okay.

1103
00:50:55,039 --> 00:50:56,905
Seriously, like, everybody
is waiting on you.

1104
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:58,565
Oh, my gosh.

1105
00:50:58,623 --> 00:51:00,135
My brother is blowing up
Twitter right now.

1106
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:01,600
Okay, whatever.
We have to go now.

1107
00:51:01,663 --> 00:51:02,689
Seriously. But...

1108
00:51:02,752 --> 00:51:04,454
Hey, what's your name, kid'?

1109
00:51:04,512 --> 00:51:05,800
Albie Peterson.

1110
00:51:05,824 --> 00:51:07,329
And what's that
you've got there'?

1111
00:51:07,392 --> 00:51:08,810
The key
to Mr. Whittmore's treasure.

1112
00:51:08,864 --> 00:51:10,217
How did you find it'?

1113
00:51:10,272 --> 00:51:11,461
I figured out the clues.

1114
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:13,352
Well, was it difficult'?

1115
00:51:13,375 --> 00:51:15,841
No, not if you're smart like me.

1116
00:51:15,903 --> 00:51:17,344
Well, you heard
it here first, folks.

1117
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:19,143
Albie Peterson has found the key

1118
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:21,731
to the mysterious
Whittmore treasure.

1119
00:51:21,792 --> 00:51:24,105
How are you going
to find the treasure?

1120
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:25,927
I'll figure it out.

1121
00:51:25,984 --> 00:51:29,639
Oh, things are about
to get real.

1122
00:51:32,415 --> 00:51:33,895
Why are you writing
that down, Cheryl?

1123
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,040
That's just weird.

1124
00:51:35,103 --> 00:51:36,674
Don't write everything I say.

1125
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:41,380
Mr. Mayor, read it and weep.

1126
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:43,174
I've got court papers here

1127
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:44,966
that say that
your little treasure hunt

1128
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:46,943
is going to have
to come to a stop.

1129
00:51:47,008 --> 00:51:48,994
Oh, you sail'?

1130
00:51:49,024 --> 00:51:50,594
Yes, I do.

1131
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,192
<i>Oh, very nice.</i>

1132
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,673
Oh, do you have boat insurance?

1133
00:51:53,728 --> 00:51:55,910
Boat insurance, who doesn't
have boat insurance?

1134
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,316
Ringo Fink, here's my card.

1135
00:51:57,375 --> 00:51:59,208
Premiums are at an
all-time high right now,

1136
00:51:59,263 --> 00:52:01,544
but I'd be happy to hook you up.

1137
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:04,099
We all live in a yellow
submarine after all.

1138
00:52:04,159 --> 00:52:05,218
I don't understand.

1139
00:52:05,279 --> 00:52:06,720
You don't understand?

1140
00:52:06,751 --> 00:52:07,843
Well, understand this, sir.

1141
00:52:07,903 --> 00:52:09,027
Your little treasure hunt'?

1142
00:52:09,088 --> 00:52:11,521
Yeah, there's a land dispute
that goes back about three years

1143
00:52:11,583 --> 00:52:13,482
between my client,
Fritz Bronson,

1144
00:52:13,536 --> 00:52:14,496
and a Mr. Whittmore.

1145
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,359
Why was it never settled?

1146
00:52:16,416 --> 00:52:18,343
I resent your tone, sir,
if you're trying to imply

1147
00:52:18,367 --> 00:52:20,353
that I have not done my due
diligence as a lawyer.

1148
00:52:20,415 --> 00:52:22,215
Jurisprudence... Please, please.

1149
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:23,745
Get the point, Mr. Fink.

1150
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,597
I'll get to the point,
Mr. Mayor.

1151
00:52:26,655 --> 00:52:28,292
If this little treasure of yours

1152
00:52:28,351 --> 00:52:30,271
is found on land
that is owned by my client

1153
00:52:30,304 --> 00:52:31,809
or Mr. Whittmore,

1154
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:33,606
well then, sir,
we have a problem

1155
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,917
because...

1156
00:52:34,975 --> 00:52:37,158
We're going to have to put
a stop to the whole thing

1157
00:52:37,215 --> 00:52:38,656
until we can all come together.

1158
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:40,007
Do you like movies?

1159
00:52:40,064 --> 00:52:41,417
Do you like comedies?

1160
00:52:41,472 --> 00:52:42,760
Well, this one is not funny.

1161
00:52:42,815 --> 00:52:44,583
It's a scary movie.

1162
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:47,618
Push pause. Push pause.

1163
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:49,414
No treasure, pause.

1164
00:52:49,471 --> 00:52:51,337
Huh'? Huh'?

1165
00:52:51,391 --> 00:52:53,377
We can shoot some hoops
some other time.

1166
00:52:55,103 --> 00:52:57,733
Can you stop us from
looking for the clues'?

1167
00:52:57,759 --> 00:53:00,192
No, but we could get
into a lot of trouble

1168
00:53:00,255 --> 00:53:02,820
for stepping foot
on any of Whittmore's land.

1169
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:06,436
Bronson is just upset that Billy
didn't find the key first.

1170
00:53:06,495 --> 00:53:07,935
What about the missing statue?

1171
00:53:08,191 --> 00:53:09,703
Aren't they going to
find out who took it'?

1172
00:53:09,727 --> 00:53:12,673
It is a little bit strange,
isn't it'?

1173
00:53:12,735 --> 00:53:15,048
Why would Mr. Bronson want
to stop the treasure hunt'?

1174
00:53:15,103 --> 00:53:17,504
Well, after Mr. Bronson

1175
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,324
sold Mr. Whittmore
the root beer stand,

1176
00:53:20,384 --> 00:53:22,632
those two never
really got along.

1177
00:53:22,687 --> 00:53:23,942
What happened?

1178
00:53:23,999 --> 00:53:27,360
Well, after loaning
Mr. Bronson the money

1179
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:28,744
<i>to build the root bee! Stand,</i>

1180
00:53:28,799 --> 00:53:31,843
<i>Mr. Whittmore hired him
as a financial advisor.</i>

1181
00:53:31,904 --> 00:53:33,671
<i>Months later, he found out
that Mr. Bronson</i>

1182
00:53:33,727 --> 00:53:36,040
<i>had started stealing
from the company.</i>

1183
00:53:36,096 --> 00:53:37,994
I cannot tell you
how disappointed I am

1184
00:53:38,047 --> 00:53:39,047
in you, Fritz.

1185
00:53:39,071 --> 00:53:41,319
I almost can't look
at you, Fritz.

1186
00:53:41,375 --> 00:53:42,536
Do you know why are you here?

1187
00:53:42,751 --> 00:53:45,097
<i>Uh,</i> no. <i>Oh, I think you do.</i>

1188
00:53:45,151 --> 00:53:47,202
I think you do.

1189
00:53:48,735 --> 00:53:49,761
Does that look familiar?

1190
00:53:50,591 --> 00:53:52,774
Not really. I...

1191
00:53:52,831 --> 00:53:55,526
These signatures,
these initials?

1192
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:57,253
No.

1193
00:53:57,279 --> 00:53:58,408
The accounting ledger that shows

1194
00:53:58,432 --> 00:53:59,632
that you stole money from me'?

1195
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:01,633
It says Frank. That's not Fritz.

1196
00:54:03,135 --> 00:54:06,016
That's the worst lie I think
I've ever heard in my life.

1197
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,367
Hey, I...

1198
00:54:07,391 --> 00:54:09,028
Get out of my sight.

1199
00:54:13,727 --> 00:54:15,975
You had so much potential.

1200
00:54:26,367 --> 00:54:27,873
Sorry.

1201
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:31,813
Everybody makes mistakes.

1202
00:54:31,871 --> 00:54:33,312
We do. We do.

1203
00:54:33,375 --> 00:54:36,867
I'm going to help you
make it right.

1204
00:54:36,927 --> 00:54:39,655
<i>Instead of firing
Fritz and taking him to court,</i>

1205
00:54:39,712 --> 00:54:41,665
<i>Mr. Whittmore forgave him.</i>

1206
00:54:41,727 --> 00:54:43,714
<i>But there was one condition.</i>

1207
00:54:43,775 --> 00:54:45,193
What was that'?

1208
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:48,073
That Mr. Bronson donate
his entire Christmas bonus

1209
00:54:48,127 --> 00:54:50,593
<i>to a charity in town.
Thank you, Santa.</i>

1210
00:54:50,655 --> 00:54:52,390
<i>Mr. Whittmore was
sad when he found out</i>

1211
00:54:52,447 --> 00:54:54,727
<i>that Fritz had not carried through
with his request.</i>

1212
00:54:54,751 --> 00:54:56,770
Lam so majorly
disappointed in you.

1213
00:54:56,831 --> 00:54:57,890
<i>And he fired him.</i>

1214
00:54:57,952 --> 00:55:00,745
Well, you know what happens now.

1215
00:55:00,767 --> 00:55:02,022
You're fired.

1216
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:04,840
Man, I... I don't want the job.

1217
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:12,294
So why did he come back'?

1218
00:55:12,352 --> 00:55:15,974
Well, to get his greedy little
hands on the Whittmore treasure.

1219
00:55:16,031 --> 00:55:17,385
I hate that man.

1220
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:19,818
Hey, we don't hate
people, okay, guys'?

1221
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,818
We just get...

1222
00:55:22,847 --> 00:55:25,761
excruciatingly
disappointed in them.

1223
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:27,911
We're going to find that treasure,
and I'll tell you why.

1224
00:55:27,935 --> 00:55:30,281
Mr. Whittmore didn't want
Mr. Bronson to have it.

1225
00:55:34,495 --> 00:55:36,448
Yeah, and then
he wanted to go fishing.

1226
00:55:36,511 --> 00:55:39,075
Can you believe it'?

1227
00:55:39,135 --> 00:55:40,488
Nope.

1228
00:55:40,511 --> 00:55:42,944
<i>Nice.</i>

1229
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:45,353
Yeah.

1230
00:55:48,543 --> 00:55:50,529
Well, you're awkwardly
quiet tonight.

1231
00:55:52,671 --> 00:55:55,585
But I thought you said we were
going to go to a concert tonight.

1232
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,804
Yeah, I know. I just...

1233
00:55:56,863 --> 00:55:58,566
I thought we could have
some alone time.

1234
00:55:58,623 --> 00:56:00,675
And I don't want to hear
that suck music anymore.

1235
00:56:04,063 --> 00:56:05,285
Billy, take me home.

1236
00:56:06,975 --> 00:56:08,131
What'?

1237
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:09,729
Take me home, Billy.

1238
00:56:09,791 --> 00:56:12,552
What'? C-come on! Tiffany?

1239
00:56:12,607 --> 00:56:15,040
Okay, I think you're cool.

1240
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:16,838
You know, I know
there's really not...

1241
00:56:16,863 --> 00:56:18,947
an adjective
that can describe me.

1242
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:20,705
I can think of a few.

1243
00:56:22,335 --> 00:56:23,491
I know what you're thinking.

1244
00:56:27,327 --> 00:56:29,062
Kissable.

1245
00:56:30,815 --> 00:56:31,907
Hmm?

1246
00:56:49,439 --> 00:56:50,912
What the...

1247
00:56:53,087 --> 00:56:55,684
Sorry. Oh, you think
that's funny'?

1248
00:56:55,743 --> 00:56:57,892
Okay, we'll see how funny
it is when you walk home.

1249
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,620
Okay. Gosh.

1250
00:57:12,063 --> 00:57:13,929
Perfect.

1251
00:57:13,951 --> 00:57:15,173
Just perfect.

1252
00:57:20,191 --> 00:57:21,096
Um.

1253
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:23,104
Hi.

1254
00:57:23,167 --> 00:57:24,167
Hey.

1255
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:28,578
Can I get a ride'?

1256
00:57:30,015 --> 00:57:30,920
A ride'?

1257
00:57:30,975 --> 00:57:32,645
Yeah.

1258
00:57:32,703 --> 00:57:35,617
In your car. Yeah, of course.

1259
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:37,992
Thanks. To Jackie's. Jackie's'?

1260
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:40,230
Uh-huh, yeah, so...

1261
00:57:40,287 --> 00:57:41,892
Thanks. Sorry.

1262
00:57:41,919 --> 00:57:43,272
Mm-hmm. Yeah, this way, okay.

1263
00:57:43,326 --> 00:57:44,680
Yep.

1264
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,812
Your hair is good.

1265
00:58:07,871 --> 00:58:09,606
What'?

1266
00:58:17,663 --> 00:58:19,201
Your face is pretty.

1267
00:58:21,151 --> 00:58:23,399
Um...

1268
00:58:26,463 --> 00:58:28,864
It's a night nice.

1269
00:58:28,927 --> 00:58:30,978
Huh'? I'm sorry.

1270
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:32,938
It's a... It's a nice night.

1271
00:58:32,991 --> 00:58:34,694
Oh.

1272
00:58:34,751 --> 00:58:35,875
I guess so.

1273
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:54,341
Thanks for giving me
a ride, Todd.

1274
00:58:54,399 --> 00:58:57,061
It was my pleasure.

1275
00:58:57,119 --> 00:58:58,243
Okay.

1276
00:58:59,999 --> 00:59:01,701
Um, uh...

1277
00:59:01,727 --> 00:59:04,324
Uh, Tiffany!

1278
00:59:04,351 --> 00:59:06,370
Yeah.

1279
00:59:06,399 --> 00:59:09,377
You are far more extraordinary
than people give you credit for.

1280
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:12,959
Just thought you should know.

1281
00:59:14,911 --> 00:59:16,384
<i>Night.</i>

1282
00:59:16,446 --> 00:59:18,017
Night.

1283
00:59:33,726 --> 00:59:35,429
Whew.

1284
00:59:41,087 --> 00:59:42,087
Can I come in'?

1285
00:59:43,455 --> 00:59:44,961
Sure.

1286
00:59:46,718 --> 00:59:48,999
So how does it feel

1287
00:59:49,023 --> 00:59:51,489
to be a celebrity?

1288
00:59:51,551 --> 00:59:52,708
You should know.

1289
00:59:54,687 --> 00:59:56,553
Did you like my song'?

1290
00:59:56,607 --> 00:59:58,212
You were amazing.

1291
01:00:00,479 --> 01:00:02,083
Hey, did you find
the next clue'?

1292
01:00:02,143 --> 01:00:06,343
No, but this chapter,
it's on geography.

1293
01:00:06,399 --> 01:00:08,712
It talks about the geographic
coordinates system.

1294
01:00:11,166 --> 01:00:12,934
Every location on Earth
can be located

1295
01:00:12,990 --> 01:00:14,529
using a set of numbers.

1296
01:00:14,591 --> 01:00:16,511
I think Whittmore
hid the treasure

1297
01:00:16,574 --> 01:00:18,244
using the coordinates system.

1298
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:21,413
I just have to locate
the numbers.

1299
01:00:21,471 --> 01:00:23,206
Billy Bronson stole
the town statue.

1300
01:00:23,263 --> 01:00:24,736
What'?

1301
01:00:24,991 --> 01:00:25,991
I was there.

1302
01:00:26,047 --> 01:00:27,269
It's in his garage.

1303
01:00:27,327 --> 01:00:28,833
This is huge!

1304
01:00:28,895 --> 01:00:30,150
Shh, Aunt Jackie is sleeping.

1305
01:00:30,207 --> 01:00:31,396
Come on.

1306
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:35,779
Maybe the coordinates
are in the statute.

1307
01:00:35,807 --> 01:00:38,088
Well, on the statue's ring, actually.

1308
01:00:38,111 --> 01:00:40,615
The statue was wearing this ring
that had a set of numbers on it.

1309
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:41,959
It was wearing a ring'?

1310
01:00:42,015 --> 01:00:43,586
I know it sounds silly.

1311
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:45,546
But Billy actually noticed it

1312
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:47,552
and thought the numbers
might be significant.

1313
01:00:47,583 --> 01:00:49,482
So he...

1314
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:51,401
He put the ring on his necklace.

1315
01:00:51,455 --> 01:00:52,993
Billy wears a necklace?

1316
01:00:53,054 --> 01:00:54,408
What's with men and jewelry?

1317
01:00:54,431 --> 01:00:56,001
And I get teased
for being a dork'?

1318
01:00:56,063 --> 01:00:59,685
Albie, we have to get
that necklace back.

1319
01:00:59,743 --> 01:01:01,663
We need to find
the treasure, not Billy.

1320
01:01:02,623 --> 01:01:04,522
We'd better call the Savages.

1321
01:01:07,519 --> 01:01:08,577
Where are we'?

1322
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:10,406
They... they told me
to meet them here.

1323
01:01:10,463 --> 01:01:11,751
We've got to be discreet.

1324
01:01:14,143 --> 01:01:15,845
Come on.

1325
01:01:15,902 --> 01:01:17,092
Come on!

1326
01:01:17,151 --> 01:01:18,788
You're fine.

1327
01:01:18,847 --> 01:01:20,003
I just did my nails.

1328
01:01:20,063 --> 01:01:21,187
You're fine.

1329
01:01:21,246 --> 01:01:23,145
The things I do for you, Albie.

1330
01:01:23,199 --> 01:01:24,258
<i>My goodness.</i>

1331
01:01:24,511 --> 01:01:26,562
<i>- Is this thing even safe?
- Yep.</i>

1332
01:01:26,623 --> 01:01:29,350
Let the meeting begin.

1333
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:36,708
Oh, stop with the smoochy-poo.

1334
01:01:39,935 --> 01:01:41,506
I would like to welcome you,

1335
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:43,679
our newest member, Tiffany...

1336
01:01:45,631 --> 01:01:47,584
<i>who's been giving us
important information.</i>

1337
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,673
We are now back on track

1338
01:01:48,734 --> 01:01:50,786
to uncovering
the Whittmore treasure.

1339
01:01:50,847 --> 01:01:53,542
<i>Tiffany, hand out
the packets I prepared.</i>

1340
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:55,847
Thank you.

1341
01:01:55,870 --> 01:01:57,769
And one for you.

1342
01:01:57,823 --> 01:01:59,111
How professional.

1343
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:01,087
Um, uh, excuse me.

1344
01:02:01,151 --> 01:02:02,373
What's this'?

1345
01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:04,263
I don't do well with puzzles.

1346
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:06,272
Yeah. It goes like this.

1347
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:08,004
So basically, you're telling me

1348
01:02:08,063 --> 01:02:09,351
that we need to find a ring

1349
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:11,520
with numbers on it
in order to find the treasure.

1350
01:02:11,582 --> 01:02:14,529
Yep. Now, where's the
part about revenge?

1351
01:02:14,591 --> 01:02:16,031
Page 23.

1352
01:02:16,095 --> 01:02:18,408
Oh. Oh.

1353
01:02:18,463 --> 01:02:20,230
That's the response
I was looking for.

1354
01:02:20,287 --> 01:02:21,287
I like this page.

1355
01:02:22,783 --> 01:02:25,282
Movie night on the boat.

1356
01:02:25,343 --> 01:02:28,289
I love seeing movies on the boat.
I drew that.

1357
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:30,053
Tomorrow night,
Tiffany will call Billy

1358
01:02:30,111 --> 01:02:31,879
<i>and apologize for being a brat.</i>

1359
01:02:31,934 --> 01:02:33,801
Billy'? Hey.

1360
01:02:33,854 --> 01:02:35,240
I just wanted to say I'm sorry

1361
01:02:35,295 --> 01:02:37,062
for being such a brat
the other night.

1362
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:39,432
And didn't know if maybe

1363
01:02:39,487 --> 01:02:41,832
you wanted to go see
a movie on the boat tonight?

1364
01:02:43,614 --> 01:02:45,698
All right, right there.

1365
01:02:50,271 --> 01:02:52,803
<i>She?! look if
he's wearing the necklace</i>

1366
01:02:52,831 --> 01:02:54,151
<i>or not wearing the necklace.</i>

1367
01:02:56,927 --> 01:02:59,175
Sparkly Whale,
come in, Sparkly Whale.

1368
01:02:59,230 --> 01:03:00,671
This is the Great Houdini.

1369
01:03:00,734 --> 01:03:02,087
Sparkly Whale'?

1370
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:05,416
That's your code name, remember?
No, no, no.

1371
01:03:05,438 --> 01:03:08,265
Sparkly Whale is definitely
not going to work for me.

1372
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:09,318
Ow.

1373
01:03:09,343 --> 01:03:11,045
You okay'? Oh. Yeah.

1374
01:03:11,071 --> 01:03:13,254
Sorry, my back.
I'm just stretching.

1375
01:03:13,311 --> 01:03:15,395
Oh, yeah, that happens to me.
It hurts.

1376
01:03:18,719 --> 01:03:20,803
<i>In case the
necklace is not on him,</i>

1377
01:03:20,863 --> 01:03:22,565
<i>Winnie and Vinny
will create a diversion</i>

1378
01:03:22,591 --> 01:03:24,610
<i>to get Billy's house keys.</i>

1379
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:26,471
Oh, come on, wife.

1380
01:03:26,527 --> 01:03:27,527
I'm coming!

1381
01:03:27,551 --> 01:03:28,839
<i>Come on!</i>

1382
01:03:28,894 --> 01:03:31,360
What should I do'?

1383
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:35,297
Excuse me. Could you guys move?

1384
01:03:35,358 --> 01:03:37,159
Oh, deary me.

1385
01:03:37,214 --> 01:03:39,527
What was that,
young whippersnapper'?

1386
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:41,351
I can't see the screen.

1387
01:03:41,406 --> 01:03:44,068
Oh, what... What did he say'?

1388
01:03:44,094 --> 01:03:46,113
I can't hear without my glasses.
I need my glasses.

1389
01:03:46,143 --> 01:03:48,740
Your glasses are on your... Oh!
I can't see.

1390
01:03:48,798 --> 01:03:51,941
<i>While Vinny and
Winnie are distracting Billy,</i>

1391
01:03:51,999 --> 01:03:53,799
<i>Tiffany will grab the keys.</i>

1392
01:03:53,854 --> 01:03:55,328
They're staying.

1393
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:57,737
Tiffany, are you prepared to do

1394
01:03:57,790 --> 01:03:59,623
<i>what you need to do
to distract Billy?</i>

1395
01:03:59,679 --> 01:04:01,119
What are you implying?

1396
01:04:08,831 --> 01:04:09,769
Wow.

1397
01:04:09,822 --> 01:04:11,721
Eww. There's got
to be another way.

1398
01:04:13,662 --> 01:04:14,917
<i>Once Tiffany has the keys,</i>

1399
01:04:14,943 --> 01:04:15,903
<i>she'll text us.</i>

1400
01:04:15,966 --> 01:04:17,636
<i>Eddie and I will hop
on our Whaler</i>

1401
01:04:17,694 --> 01:04:18,818
<i>to make our way to the boat.</i>

1402
01:04:18,910 --> 01:04:21,791
Excuse me just one second.
Oh, yeah, fine.

1403
01:04:26,015 --> 01:04:28,001
Hold on. This actually
sounds kind of dangerous.

1404
01:04:28,062 --> 01:04:30,016
And your point being?

1405
01:04:30,047 --> 01:04:31,814
Albie is not allergic to danger.

1406
01:04:31,871 --> 01:04:34,882
He's allergic to metaphorical algae.

1407
01:04:34,943 --> 01:04:37,125
<i>Eddie and I will
go lo the Bronson estate</i>

1408
01:04:37,183 --> 01:04:38,569
<i>on the other side of the lake</i>

1409
01:04:38,622 --> 01:04:39,622
<i>and break in.</i>

1410
01:04:41,567 --> 01:04:43,553
There's a security guard. Hide.

1411
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:01,954
You know if this works
you'll be a genius, right'?

1412
01:05:02,014 --> 01:05:03,487
I already am.

1413
01:05:03,518 --> 01:05:04,839
That's my brother.

1414
01:05:21,118 --> 01:05:24,512
Shh.

1415
01:05:24,575 --> 01:05:25,961
Magic.

1416
01:05:27,903 --> 01:05:30,500
This way.

1417
01:05:30,558 --> 01:05:31,846
It's the maid. Go!

1418
01:05:48,798 --> 01:05:51,657
You should stay here.

1419
01:05:51,711 --> 01:05:52,900
I'll check the bathroom.

1420
01:05:56,255 --> 01:05:57,281
What's this'?

1421
01:05:57,342 --> 01:05:58,728
Ugh.

1422
01:06:04,094 --> 01:06:05,218
Yes.

1423
01:06:05,278 --> 01:06:06,468
Finally.

1424
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,461
What the heck?

1425
01:06:07,711 --> 01:06:09,096
You would need this.

1426
01:06:09,150 --> 01:06:11,845
Mr. Billy.

1427
01:06:11,903 --> 01:06:13,954
I got pizza, your favorite.

1428
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:16,450
What do we do'?

1429
01:06:17,534 --> 01:06:18,560
I don't know.

1430
01:06:18,623 --> 01:06:19,623
I got the necklace.

1431
01:06:19,647 --> 01:06:21,633
Mr. Billy'?

1432
01:06:21,694 --> 01:06:23,113
Are you up here?

1433
01:06:23,166 --> 01:06:24,672
Shh, be quiet.

1434
01:06:24,734 --> 01:06:26,305
Maybe she'll leave.

1435
01:06:30,463 --> 01:06:32,863
What if she comes up here?

1436
01:06:32,927 --> 01:06:34,345
<i>Mr. Billy,</i>

1437
01:06:34,591 --> 01:06:36,675
<i>you never tum down pizza.
Are you okay?</i>

1438
01:06:36,734 --> 01:06:40,422
I'll be down in a minute.

1439
01:06:40,478 --> 01:06:41,537
What was that'?

1440
01:06:42,718 --> 01:06:45,381
Okay, Mr. Billy.

1441
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:48,457
Now just get out of here.
Come on.

1442
01:06:48,510 --> 01:06:49,634
Right.

1443
01:06:52,222 --> 01:06:55,845
Other way, other way.

1444
01:07:02,654 --> 01:07:04,007
I'll get you kids!

1445
01:07:09,759 --> 01:07:11,199
Stop, you kids!

1446
01:07:11,262 --> 01:07:12,517
Slow down!

1447
01:07:12,574 --> 01:07:14,920
Get back here, kids!

1448
01:07:14,975 --> 01:07:16,099
<i>Shut if down!</i>

1449
01:07:17,439 --> 01:07:20,068
Now.

1450
01:07:20,127 --> 01:07:24,644
Yeah, I don't think this
plan was very well thought through.

1451
01:07:24,702 --> 01:07:25,957
<i>Get off the grass!</i>

1452
01:07:26,014 --> 01:07:28,447
<i>Slow down, kids!</i>

1453
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:29,984
You kids get back here!

1454
01:07:30,239 --> 01:07:32,836
Oh, this is intense.

1455
01:07:32,894 --> 01:07:36,255
It sure is. It sure is, Grandpa.

1456
01:07:40,926 --> 01:07:43,807
Albie, I'll distract him.

1457
01:07:43,838 --> 01:07:44,838
You got the bow.

1458
01:07:49,470 --> 01:07:52,581
Oh, great. Toxicodendron.

1459
01:07:52,638 --> 01:07:55,464
<i>I shouldn't have
let him out of my sight.</i>

1460
01:07:55,487 --> 01:07:58,498
You kids shouldn't have been over at
the Bronson's in the first place.

1461
01:07:58,558 --> 01:08:00,064
It almost worked.

1462
01:08:00,126 --> 01:08:01,926
I gave the performance
of my life.

1463
01:08:03,390 --> 01:08:05,954
When was the last time
you saw Albie'?

1464
01:08:06,014 --> 01:08:07,749
He headed off into the woods

1465
01:08:07,806 --> 01:08:10,054
<i>after I lost the security guard.</i>

1466
01:08:10,110 --> 01:08:12,510
I waited for him, but...

1467
01:08:12,575 --> 01:08:13,699
he never came back.

1468
01:08:16,702 --> 01:08:18,569
I shouldn't have let him
out of my sight.

1469
01:08:28,991 --> 01:08:31,685
Can I... Can you just drop
me off at the marina'?

1470
01:08:31,742 --> 01:08:37,121
Look who it is. Johnny Bigshot.

1471
01:08:37,150 --> 01:08:40,358
What do you say you and I
have a little chat, huh'?

1472
01:08:44,703 --> 01:08:46,121
Wait a minute. Give me that.

1473
01:08:46,175 --> 01:08:47,175
Hey, that's mine.

1474
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:49,609
I could have you
arrested for this.

1475
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:50,630
That's stealing.

1476
01:08:52,254 --> 01:08:54,273
<i>You don'! Look too good, buddy.</i>

1477
01:08:54,334 --> 01:08:57,029
Holding onto that key has...

1478
01:08:57,087 --> 01:08:59,073
not been very good
for you, has it'?

1479
01:08:59,103 --> 01:09:01,983
Mr. Whittmore wanted me
to have the treasure.

1480
01:09:02,046 --> 01:09:05,668
I can make your life
very uncomfortable.

1481
01:09:05,694 --> 01:09:07,331
You hear me, short stuff'?

1482
01:09:11,166 --> 01:09:13,152
<i>Fire! Excuse me'?</i>

1483
01:09:13,214 --> 01:09:14,403
There's a fire!

1484
01:09:14,462 --> 01:09:16,165
"What" hey!

1485
01:09:16,222 --> 01:09:17,761
Hey, what did you do'?

1486
01:09:17,822 --> 01:09:20,135
Stop smoking.
It isn't good for you.

1487
01:09:20,190 --> 01:09:22,056
It makes your teeth rot.

1488
01:09:22,110 --> 01:09:23,780
<i>You come here, you little rat.</i>

1489
01:09:23,838 --> 01:09:25,758
Hey! Ah!

1490
01:09:25,822 --> 01:09:28,550
Ah, I just burned
my nuts. Dammit!

1491
01:09:28,606 --> 01:09:30,756
Don't worry. Albie is
stronger than he looks.

1492
01:09:30,814 --> 01:09:32,419
Last year
before his spelling bee,

1493
01:09:32,478 --> 01:09:33,700
he got stung by a bee.

1494
01:09:33,758 --> 01:09:35,363
Ironic, right'?

1495
01:09:35,422 --> 01:09:37,157
O0. He still won, too.

1496
01:09:37,214 --> 01:09:38,632
If you ever want to feel stupid,

1497
01:09:38,879 --> 01:09:41,159
watch a six-year-old
spell "anesthetic" correctly.

1498
01:09:41,214 --> 01:09:42,720
<i>Really? Mm-hmm. Yep.</i>

1499
01:09:42,782 --> 01:09:44,166
Okay, you guys,
I can't wait anymore.

1500
01:09:44,190 --> 01:09:46,279
Okay, I'm going to go look for him.
Yeah, I'll go, too.

1501
01:09:46,303 --> 01:09:47,591
Okay, be careful.

1502
01:09:48,958 --> 01:09:50,529
Albie?

1503
01:09:50,558 --> 01:09:51,747
Albie! I got him. I got him.

1504
01:09:51,807 --> 01:09:52,898
Get him. There we go, okay.

1505
01:09:52,958 --> 01:09:53,958
Go, go, 9°-

1506
01:10:00,062 --> 01:10:01,446
How long is this
going to take, lady'?

1507
01:10:01,470 --> 01:10:03,586
I got people to sue.

1508
01:10:03,839 --> 01:10:07,047
Mr. Fink, it is
a very busy morning.

1509
01:10:07,102 --> 01:10:10,146
The treasure hunt
was just recently released.

1510
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:11,777
Released?

1511
01:10:11,806 --> 01:10:13,956
What is she
talking about, released?

1512
01:10:13,982 --> 01:10:15,783
Exciting, isn't it'?

1513
01:10:15,838 --> 01:10:17,704
<i>What is this?</i>

1514
01:10:17,758 --> 01:10:19,591
I'll be on my way.

1515
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:23,073
Hey, uh, we can shoot some
hoops later if you like.

1516
01:10:23,135 --> 01:10:25,219
I'll see you in court.

1517
01:10:25,246 --> 01:10:28,127
The basketball court.

1518
01:10:44,670 --> 01:10:46,754
Hey.

1519
01:10:46,814 --> 01:10:48,255
Boy genius.

1520
01:10:48,286 --> 01:10:49,607
How you feeling?

1521
01:10:49,663 --> 01:10:53,285
Jackie? Shh, it's okay.

1522
01:10:53,342 --> 01:10:54,913
Just get some rest.

1523
01:10:54,974 --> 01:10:57,157
We're here for you and
we're not going anywhere.

1524
01:10:58,590 --> 01:11:01,056
The key. Don't worry.

1525
01:11:01,118 --> 01:11:03,038
We're keeping it safe.

1526
01:11:03,103 --> 01:11:06,791
Hey, I see you met a lot of
great friends out there.

1527
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:09,792
I read about this one guy who
died and came back to life.

1528
01:11:09,854 --> 01:11:11,753
He said that heaven
was like a marshmallow.

1529
01:11:11,999 --> 01:11:13,919
It was all puffy and sweet.

1530
01:11:13,982 --> 01:11:16,165
Like me.

1531
01:11:16,222 --> 01:11:18,852
How is he'? He'll be fine.

1532
01:11:18,910 --> 01:11:21,093
Okay. Wait, what
about the treasure?

1533
01:11:21,150 --> 01:11:23,234
The Bronsons still have
the coordinates.

1534
01:11:39,998 --> 01:11:41,831
Here we go.

1535
01:11:43,134 --> 01:11:44,804
What are you doing here, Billy'?

1536
01:11:44,862 --> 01:11:46,435
What are you doing here, Billy'?

1537
01:11:49,086 --> 01:11:51,999
Shh!

1538
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:53,961
We got a little bit
of a situation.

1539
01:11:54,014 --> 01:11:55,880
You guys have the key.

1540
01:11:55,934 --> 01:11:57,702
We have the coordinates.

1541
01:11:57,758 --> 01:11:59,493
And without both, well...

1542
01:11:59,550 --> 01:12:01,219
we're both screwed.

1543
01:12:01,278 --> 01:12:04,104
What are you getting at, Billy'?

1544
01:12:04,126 --> 01:12:07,040
Todd? Sweet Todd?

1545
01:12:07,102 --> 01:12:08,804
Where did that edge come from'?

1546
01:12:08,862 --> 01:12:09,800
What's your point'?

1547
01:12:09,854 --> 01:12:12,036
He has one.

1548
01:12:12,094 --> 01:12:13,632
Right'? Yeah.

1549
01:12:13,694 --> 01:12:14,982
There is a 50/50 chance.

1550
01:12:15,038 --> 01:12:16,708
Oh, those odds,
I like those odds.

1551
01:12:16,766 --> 01:12:19,647
Of course I have
a point, idiots!

1552
01:12:20,574 --> 01:12:22,723
Garrison?

1553
01:12:24,254 --> 01:12:26,174
What's this'?
What, can't you read?

1554
01:12:26,206 --> 01:12:29,479
Yeah, didn't you...
Didn't you go to...

1555
01:12:29,534 --> 01:12:32,644
"The read" reading...
The reading school?

1556
01:12:32,670 --> 01:12:34,275
Didn't you 90...

1557
01:12:34,334 --> 01:12:35,775
Nice.

1558
01:12:37,502 --> 01:12:38,593
Let's go.

1559
01:12:38,654 --> 01:12:41,513
Catch you later. Hmm.

1560
01:12:41,566 --> 01:12:42,755
Albie should see this.

1561
01:12:42,814 --> 01:12:44,320
All right, come on, guys.

1562
01:12:47,742 --> 01:12:49,958
<i>Harleyk!</i>

1563
01:12:51,262 --> 01:12:52,423
Excuse me, Aunt Jackie. Yeah.

1564
01:12:54,398 --> 01:12:55,686
Albie, look.

1565
01:12:56,990 --> 01:12:58,049
What is it'?

1566
01:12:58,110 --> 01:12:59,779
Well, it's a challenge.

1567
01:12:59,806 --> 01:13:00,995
Read it.

1568
01:13:02,462 --> 01:13:04,328
"You are amicably invited to..."

1569
01:13:04,382 --> 01:13:05,473
I hate to interrupt,

1570
01:13:05,534 --> 01:13:06,625
but I love challenges.

1571
01:13:06,654 --> 01:13:07,654
Let's do it!

1572
01:13:07,678 --> 01:13:09,184
You guys, look.

1573
01:13:09,246 --> 01:13:10,599
I hate to be
the voice of reason,

1574
01:13:10,622 --> 01:13:12,325
but these people
are shady, okay'?

1575
01:13:12,382 --> 01:13:13,670
They're not to be trusted.

1576
01:13:13,918 --> 01:13:15,075
Keep reading.

1577
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:18,849
"Bring your four best men."

1578
01:13:18,878 --> 01:13:20,002
Or women.

1579
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:22,048
"We'll meet at sunrise."

1580
01:13:22,110 --> 01:13:24,739
"The loser will relinquish their
half of the Whittmore puzzle."

1581
01:13:24,798 --> 01:13:26,184
<i>The key.</i>

1582
01:13:26,430 --> 01:13:27,783
"Sincerely, the Bronsons."

1583
01:13:27,838 --> 01:13:29,475
The Bronsons, sincere?

1584
01:13:29,534 --> 01:13:30,534
See, now that's a joke.

1585
01:13:30,558 --> 01:13:32,478
It sounds fair.

1586
01:13:32,542 --> 01:13:34,561
Yeah, if they played by the rules.
Yeah.

1587
01:13:34,622 --> 01:13:36,193
What you think
we should do, Albie'?

1588
01:13:36,254 --> 01:13:38,338
I think...

1589
01:13:38,398 --> 01:13:40,231
we'd better get training.

1590
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:43,936
Go, go! You call that fast'?

1591
01:13:43,998 --> 01:13:45,222
I know you can do
better than that!

1592
01:13:45,246 --> 01:13:46,246
Come on, Eddie. Okay.

1593
01:13:46,270 --> 01:13:47,775
Go, go, go!

1594
01:13:50,814 --> 01:13:52,003
Move!

1595
01:13:54,782 --> 01:13:57,281
Now try hardier.

1596
01:13:57,342 --> 01:13:59,491
Go, go, go.

1597
01:13:59,550 --> 01:14:01,252
I want 10 more! Come on! Go!

1598
01:14:01,310 --> 01:14:02,565
Beat the tide!

1599
01:14:02,622 --> 01:14:04,805
Come on! I know you can
go faster than that!

1600
01:14:04,830 --> 01:14:06,151
Beat the tide!

1601
01:14:06,174 --> 01:14:07,811
I'm not even going anywhere.

1602
01:14:07,870 --> 01:14:09,059
Bigger strokes! Come on!

1603
01:14:09,118 --> 01:14:09,925
You can beat it!

1604
01:14:09,982 --> 01:14:10,982
Distract!

1605
01:14:11,038 --> 01:14:12,740
Flirt! Work it.

1606
01:14:12,798 --> 01:14:15,046
Whoever reaches me first
gets free ice cream.

1607
01:14:15,102 --> 01:14:16,707
Come on, Eddie. Come on!

1608
01:14:25,342 --> 01:14:28,103
Oh, Tiffany wins.

1609
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:35,561
I never thought
the day would come

1610
01:14:35,614 --> 01:14:37,447
that I would be standing
in front of you,

1611
01:14:37,502 --> 01:14:38,822
<i>all grown up,</i>

1612
01:14:38,878 --> 01:14:41,410
telling you you're ready.

1613
01:14:42,238 --> 01:14:43,330
<i>Whoa!</i>

1614
01:14:44,862 --> 01:14:46,216
Eddie. Eddie?

1615
01:14:46,238 --> 01:14:47,296
You okay'? Eddie.

1616
01:14:56,766 --> 01:14:58,119
Good morning, Culver.

1617
01:14:58,174 --> 01:15:00,073
I'm Daisy Larson
reporting to you live

1618
01:15:00,125 --> 01:15:01,631
from the marina.

1619
01:15:01,693 --> 01:15:03,396
And welcome back to my co-host,

1620
01:15:03,454 --> 01:15:04,960
Jack Gallagher.

1621
01:15:05,022 --> 01:15:07,652
I'm back from my
vacation in Australia.

1622
01:15:07,710 --> 01:15:09,183
And all I have to say

1623
01:15:09,246 --> 01:15:10,632
is things got interesting.

1624
01:15:10,685 --> 01:15:12,672
We're excited
to bring you live coverage

1625
01:15:12,734 --> 01:15:14,152
of a competition challenge

1626
01:15:14,206 --> 01:15:16,803
between local boy,
Billy Bronson,

1627
01:15:16,830 --> 01:15:19,111
and visitor to Culver,
Albie Peterson.

1628
01:15:19,134 --> 01:15:22,047
Oh, it looks like the challenge
is about to begin.

1629
01:15:22,110 --> 01:15:26,082
The challenges are both
physical and intellectual.

1630
01:15:26,142 --> 01:15:28,390
The course is laid out for you.

1631
01:15:28,446 --> 01:15:30,530
If you see
an orange flag like this,

1632
01:15:30,590 --> 01:15:32,674
that is the start of a course.

1633
01:15:32,702 --> 01:15:35,561
There will be
an official at each course.

1634
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:39,171
There will be
absolutely no cheating.

1635
01:15:40,574 --> 01:15:41,796
The losing team

1636
01:15:41,854 --> 01:15:43,687
will relinquish
all of its findings

1637
01:15:43,742 --> 01:15:45,182
in regards
to the Whittmore treasure

1638
01:15:45,245 --> 01:15:46,664
<i>to the opposing team.</i>

1639
01:15:46,718 --> 01:15:47,809
Are you ready?

1640
01:15:47,870 --> 01:15:50,784
Bring it on!

1641
01:15:50,846 --> 01:15:54,752
Ready, set, go!

1642
01:15:57,534 --> 01:15:59,749
All right, all right.
Row, Row, Row, Row.

1643
01:16:01,565 --> 01:16:03,268
Winnie, calm down!

1644
01:16:03,294 --> 01:16:05,247
You stay on the right.
You stay on the left.

1645
01:16:05,309 --> 01:16:07,263
<i>Hey, Todd! You must like ladies.</i>

1646
01:16:07,325 --> 01:16:08,896
Because you got three of them.

1647
01:16:10,910 --> 01:16:13,889
Winnie! Winnie, sit down!

1648
01:16:13,949 --> 01:16:16,644
Okay, get this girl
away from me.

1649
01:16:16,702 --> 01:16:18,622
<i>Winnie, sit dawn.
You're going to tip the boat.</i>

1650
01:16:18,654 --> 01:16:19,908
Gather away from me!

1651
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:21,380
We're getting her out of here.

1652
01:16:21,406 --> 01:16:24,679
You!

1653
01:16:24,734 --> 01:16:26,436
I will get you for that!

1654
01:16:29,309 --> 01:16:31,972
Both teams must start
a fire using their supplies.

1655
01:16:32,030 --> 01:16:33,351
The quicker they start it,

1656
01:16:33,598 --> 01:16:35,071
the higher the points received.

1657
01:16:35,102 --> 01:16:36,804
Okay, this is how
we're going to do it.

1658
01:16:48,478 --> 01:16:49,667
<i>Eddie! Try it, try it.</i>

1659
01:16:58,686 --> 01:17:00,869
Hey, um...

1660
01:17:00,894 --> 01:17:02,148
All right, all right.

1661
01:17:02,398 --> 01:17:03,686
Go, go, go.

1662
01:17:03,742 --> 01:17:04,996
Go, go, go, come on.

1663
01:17:06,558 --> 01:17:07,682
I got something.

1664
01:17:07,742 --> 01:17:09,412
It's a big one. Good job, Eddie.

1665
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:10,594
Come on, Eddie. Come on.

1666
01:17:10,622 --> 01:17:12,008
Get it, get it!

1667
01:17:12,062 --> 01:17:13,218
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

1668
01:17:13,246 --> 01:17:15,145
Aw, seaweed? Really?

1669
01:17:15,198 --> 01:17:17,314
You get the
fish, I'll get the chips.

1670
01:17:17,342 --> 01:17:18,401
You know what I'm saying?

1671
01:17:18,430 --> 01:17:19,684
You know?

1672
01:17:26,014 --> 01:17:27,814
Shh!

1673
01:17:29,278 --> 01:17:30,751
Billy's team is in the lead.

1674
01:17:30,814 --> 01:17:32,832
Do Albie and the Savages
have what it takes

1675
01:17:32,894 --> 01:17:33,894
to get ahead?

1676
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:37,539
Aw, it's trivia.

1677
01:17:37,598 --> 01:17:39,911
Trivia? Aw, this is the worst.

1678
01:17:39,966 --> 01:17:41,886
This is the worst part
of the competition for me.

1679
01:17:42,973 --> 01:17:43,716
What is it'?

1680
01:17:43,774 --> 01:17:45,923
Oh, trivia. Trivia, I got this.

1681
01:17:45,982 --> 01:17:48,230
A meemall that can flee?

1682
01:17:48,478 --> 01:17:49,122
A mammal.

1683
01:17:49,150 --> 01:17:51,048
Fly.

1684
01:17:56,830 --> 01:17:59,110
Oh, this is a really hard test.

1685
01:17:59,166 --> 01:18:01,544
Next up is an impromptu
talent competition.

1686
01:18:01,598 --> 01:18:05,090
Mr. Riggs, you will be choosing
the winner of this competition?

1687
01:18:05,150 --> 01:18:06,983
Thank you, Daisy.

1688
01:18:07,006 --> 01:18:09,025
It's an honor just to be here.

1689
01:18:09,053 --> 01:18:12,513
If anyone truly

1690
01:18:12,574 --> 01:18:14,658
knows talent,

1691
01:18:14,718 --> 01:18:17,828
especially talent
that you have to

1692
01:18:17,885 --> 01:18:20,766
perform at random,

1693
01:18:20,830 --> 01:18:22,816
without months of
preparation or rehearsal,

1694
01:18:23,070 --> 01:18:24,674
well then, it's me.

1695
01:18:24,734 --> 01:18:27,112
By God's grace, it is me.

1696
01:18:29,982 --> 01:18:31,106
Thanks.

1697
01:18:33,182 --> 01:18:34,949
Talent competition.
We got this in the bag.

1698
01:18:35,006 --> 01:18:36,130
Can I do it'?

1699
01:18:36,189 --> 01:18:38,405
Please? Actually, I
think Tiffany should.

1700
01:18:38,461 --> 01:18:39,902
No, Eddie has got this.

1701
01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:41,602
All right.

1702
01:18:45,566 --> 01:18:47,334
Okay, so let's go.

1703
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:49,158
No one knows this about me.

1704
01:18:49,213 --> 01:18:52,421
But I am simply
dazzled by mimes.

1705
01:18:52,478 --> 01:18:54,758
Mimes. Yes, mi... mi...

1706
01:19:24,029 --> 01:19:25,448
All right, let's see.

1707
01:19:25,470 --> 01:19:27,369
Okay.

1708
01:19:28,573 --> 01:19:29,992
Oh. Magic.

1709
01:19:30,238 --> 01:19:31,329
Yeah. I love magic.

1710
01:19:34,685 --> 01:19:36,518
An empty hat.

1711
01:19:36,542 --> 01:19:39,074
That's an empty hat. Empty
hat, perfectly empty.

1712
01:19:50,494 --> 01:19:52,065
Okay. Please work.

1713
01:19:56,702 --> 01:19:58,339
A cheeseburger?

1714
01:19:58,366 --> 01:20:00,417
How did he do that'?

1715
01:20:00,478 --> 01:20:02,245
Way to go!

1716
01:20:02,302 --> 01:20:05,510
A cheeseburger!

1717
01:20:05,758 --> 01:20:09,599
Wow, how did he do it'?

1718
01:20:09,661 --> 01:20:10,087
Magic.

1719
01:20:10,142 --> 01:20:12,739
Did somebody see
my cheeseburger?

1720
01:20:12,766 --> 01:20:15,810
I always eat a cheeseburger
when I do the news.

1721
01:20:15,869 --> 01:20:16,961
Let's go, let's go!

1722
01:20:16,989 --> 01:20:18,626
Go, go!

1723
01:20:18,686 --> 01:20:21,632
It's all going to come down
to the scores.

1724
01:20:21,693 --> 01:20:23,167
The Bronsons are in the lead.

1725
01:20:23,197 --> 01:20:24,321
The question is

1726
01:20:24,382 --> 01:20:27,077
can Albie and the Savages
regain some points

1727
01:20:27,133 --> 01:20:28,290
in the next competition?

1728
01:20:28,349 --> 01:20:30,848
The final leg of the competition

1729
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:32,776
is the Wave Runner race.

1730
01:20:32,830 --> 01:20:35,208
The first person to circle
around the buoy

1731
01:20:35,262 --> 01:20:36,866
and cross the finish line

1732
01:20:36,893 --> 01:20:38,792
wins.

1733
01:20:38,813 --> 01:20:40,068
You got this, Todd.

1734
01:20:42,430 --> 01:20:44,470
I'm going to show you what
a real winner looks like.

1735
01:21:04,541 --> 01:21:06,440
You got this. Come on!

1736
01:21:06,493 --> 01:21:09,123
Whoo! Come on!

1737
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:20,255
Come on!

1738
01:21:20,318 --> 01:21:22,304
Come on! Oh, he's
almost going to lose.

1739
01:21:22,558 --> 01:21:24,096
He's almost going to lose.

1740
01:21:31,934 --> 01:21:34,247
Yes!

1741
01:21:34,301 --> 01:21:36,102
<i>Go To do'!</i>

1742
01:21:39,934 --> 01:21:41,374
Oh. Good job, Billy.

1743
01:21:44,349 --> 01:21:45,986
All right.

1744
01:21:51,646 --> 01:21:52,867
Hey, he's wet.

1745
01:21:52,925 --> 01:21:54,562
Billy, I'm sorry.

1746
01:21:54,622 --> 01:21:55,843
It's okay.

1747
01:21:55,902 --> 01:21:57,156
I didn't... You know, I just...

1748
01:21:57,214 --> 01:21:58,214
I'm not... It was...

1749
01:22:01,021 --> 01:22:02,047
It was a close one.

1750
01:22:02,110 --> 01:22:03,266
The tallies are in.

1751
01:22:03,326 --> 01:22:04,482
The Mayor has the results.

1752
01:22:04,509 --> 01:22:05,535
Let's see who won.

1753
01:22:06,462 --> 01:22:08,099
And the winner is...

1754
01:22:10,046 --> 01:22:11,268
Please let it be us.

1755
01:22:12,893 --> 01:22:16,483
Billy Bronson.

1756
01:22:16,541 --> 01:22:17,862
<i>We did if!</i>

1757
01:22:17,918 --> 01:22:18,918
<i>We did if!</i>

1758
01:22:21,118 --> 01:22:22,078
I smell something fishy.

1759
01:22:22,141 --> 01:22:23,200
And it's not the lake.

1760
01:22:25,181 --> 01:22:26,582
Going to collect
the winning ticket.

1761
01:22:26,622 --> 01:22:28,542
Dad'? Ha!

1762
01:22:28,798 --> 01:22:32,158
Looks like I'll be taking that
key off your hands after all.

1763
01:22:33,630 --> 01:22:34,851
Not so fast, Mr. Bronson.

1764
01:22:34,910 --> 01:22:36,099
Upon further examination

1765
01:22:36,158 --> 01:22:38,406
into who rightfully
owned the land,

1766
01:22:38,430 --> 01:22:40,612
I came across this
in Mr. Whittmore's will.

1767
01:22:40,670 --> 01:22:42,789
Hold on, Mayor. This treasure
hunt has gone on long enough.

1768
01:22:42,813 --> 01:22:44,384
Come on. End it.

1769
01:22:44,446 --> 01:22:45,798
Well, why would he
announce the winner

1770
01:22:45,822 --> 01:22:47,622
and just, like,
take it back in two seconds?

1771
01:22:47,678 --> 01:22:49,248
In the will, it states

1772
01:22:49,310 --> 01:22:52,104
"if any dispute
between parties exists,"

1773
01:22:52,157 --> 01:22:54,852
"the judgment of who
found the treasure first"

1774
01:22:54,910 --> 01:22:57,026
"should be based
on sportsmanship."

1775
01:22:57,053 --> 01:22:59,170
Okay, what does it...
I'm sporty.

1776
01:22:59,229 --> 01:23:00,550
You guys are sporty, right'?

1777
01:23:00,605 --> 01:23:02,079
Sporty, yeah. Yeah!

1778
01:23:02,142 --> 01:23:03,615
<i>Yeah!</i>

1779
01:23:03,677 --> 01:23:04,677
They're sporty.

1780
01:23:06,942 --> 01:23:11,230
Absolutely no cheating.

1781
01:23:11,293 --> 01:23:14,152
I-I-I don't even know
how that got in there.

1782
01:23:14,206 --> 01:23:15,232
I knew it. I knew it.

1783
01:23:15,293 --> 01:23:17,312
<i>Dude, the official
gave it to us, remember?</i>

1784
01:23:17,373 --> 01:23:19,359
Like halfway through,
we were all confused.

1785
01:23:19,422 --> 01:23:21,702
We were like,
ah, this is difficult.

1786
01:23:21,757 --> 01:23:22,946
<i>And he was like, “Here, man.“</i>

1787
01:23:23,006 --> 01:23:24,162
<i>"“Here's a lighter." Stop.</i>

1788
01:23:24,222 --> 01:23:25,793
And we were like,
"We don't know how."

1789
01:23:25,853 --> 01:23:27,686
And he was like, "I know how."

1790
01:23:27,741 --> 01:23:29,346
So he helped us with everything.

1791
01:23:29,405 --> 01:23:30,529
And then we did it.

1792
01:23:30,590 --> 01:23:31,590
And we're wi...

1793
01:23:33,150 --> 01:23:34,694
But Mayor, cheating
is the American way.

1794
01:23:34,718 --> 01:23:36,387
You watch baseball?

1795
01:23:36,413 --> 01:23:37,413
The good guys win.

1796
01:23:39,005 --> 01:23:40,359
Are we the... Are we the bad...

1797
01:23:40,382 --> 01:23:42,466
Are we the bad guys'?

1798
01:23:42,718 --> 01:23:46,242
Albie and his team are the
true winners. Mayor...

1799
01:23:51,005 --> 01:23:52,358
Mayor, what you talking about'?

1800
01:23:52,414 --> 01:23:54,246
The coordinates, please.

1801
01:23:55,902 --> 01:23:57,669
Give them the coordinates.

1802
01:23:57,725 --> 01:23:58,751
Did you wear sunscreen?

1803
01:23:58,813 --> 01:24:00,516
Dad, do something.

1804
01:24:00,542 --> 01:24:02,244
This kid never wears sunscreen.

1805
01:24:09,053 --> 01:24:10,242
Thank you.

1806
01:24:14,525 --> 01:24:15,584
Wait a minute, no.

1807
01:24:15,646 --> 01:24:17,664
So how do you
decipher it, Albie'?

1808
01:24:17,726 --> 01:24:18,882
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

1809
01:24:18,942 --> 01:24:20,677
I need a map of Culver.

1810
01:24:20,733 --> 01:24:22,600
There you are.

1811
01:24:22,653 --> 01:24:24,639
Good luck. Thank you.

1812
01:24:24,669 --> 01:24:26,568
Dad, fix this.

1813
01:24:26,589 --> 01:24:28,291
You're giving it
to the snot noses.

1814
01:24:28,349 --> 01:24:30,400
Tell me, Mr. Bronson.

1815
01:24:30,462 --> 01:24:32,645
If we were to take a look
in your garage,

1816
01:24:32,669 --> 01:24:34,753
what would we find there
besides your Mustang?

1817
01:24:34,813 --> 01:24:36,166
<i>My wife's pantyhose.</i>

1818
01:24:36,189 --> 01:24:38,721
A weed wanker,
a washing machine.

1819
01:24:38,781 --> 01:24:40,680
I told you it was a stupid idea.

1820
01:24:40,733 --> 01:24:42,632
Basic stuff, power
tools, you know.

1821
01:24:42,653 --> 01:24:44,552
We received an anonymous text.

1822
01:24:44,606 --> 01:24:46,246
Yeah, I don't... I can't
see what that is.

1823
01:24:49,054 --> 01:24:51,203
Sir, you're under arrest
for stealing the town statue.

1824
01:24:51,261 --> 01:24:52,385
They were borrowing it.

1825
01:24:52,445 --> 01:24:54,311
No, we didn't steal...
No, it was my kid.

1826
01:24:54,365 --> 01:24:55,838
No, when he
doesn't wear sunscreen

1827
01:24:55,901 --> 01:24:57,734
he doesn't think so straight.

1828
01:24:57,757 --> 01:24:58,914
Come on. Come on.

1829
01:24:58,973 --> 01:25:03,043
He did it. I did it.

1830
01:25:03,069 --> 01:25:04,739
Well, it looks like
your new boyfriend

1831
01:25:04,797 --> 01:25:05,987
just got arrested.

1832
01:25:06,238 --> 01:25:08,289
I'm definitely changing
my relationship status

1833
01:25:08,350 --> 01:25:10,117
to "It's complicated."

1834
01:25:15,037 --> 01:25:17,220
Roll it out, roll it out. I
want to see where it is.

1835
01:25:20,382 --> 01:25:22,019
According to the coordinates,

1836
01:25:22,077 --> 01:25:23,550
the treasure is hidden at

1837
01:25:23,614 --> 01:25:25,119
the town playground.

1838
01:25:25,182 --> 01:25:27,364
Of course.
I love that twirly slide.

1839
01:25:27,421 --> 01:25:28,742
I love the swings.

1840
01:25:28,797 --> 01:25:29,989
I'm more of a monkey bar
guy myself.

1841
01:25:30,013 --> 01:25:31,334
Let's go.

1842
01:25:37,437 --> 01:25:38,626
Spread out. Search the area.

1843
01:25:41,437 --> 01:25:43,107
Hey, whoa.

1844
01:25:43,166 --> 01:25:44,901
Don't go past the shovels.

1845
01:25:44,957 --> 01:25:48,001
Is it in the grass
or in the mulch?

1846
01:25:48,062 --> 01:25:49,600
Well, he said it was
on the playground,

1847
01:25:49,661 --> 01:25:52,062
so I'm going to trust the genius.
Probably true.

1848
01:25:52,318 --> 01:25:54,664
Boundaries, people.

1849
01:25:54,717 --> 01:25:55,717
Boundaries.

1850
01:25:57,501 --> 01:26:00,328
Where would you
bury the treasure?

1851
01:26:00,381 --> 01:26:01,381
I don't know.

1852
01:26:02,622 --> 01:26:04,062
Eddie, quit playing.

1853
01:26:04,125 --> 01:26:05,222
We got to find the treasure.

1854
01:26:05,246 --> 01:26:07,461
Okay, I'm going
to cast a spell on my hat.

1855
01:26:07,709 --> 01:26:09,893
Wherever it lands, that is where the
treasure is going to be, okay'?

1856
01:26:09,917 --> 01:26:11,074
<i>Go! if.</i>

1857
01:26:20,893 --> 01:26:22,246
There, dig there.

1858
01:26:22,301 --> 01:26:24,680
I think it actually worked.

1859
01:26:24,733 --> 01:26:26,566
Wait, it worked?

1860
01:26:26,622 --> 01:26:28,007
It actually worked?

1861
01:26:29,437 --> 01:26:30,856
I think there's actually
something here.

1862
01:26:30,877 --> 01:26:32,230
Get the shovels. Todd, Todd.

1863
01:26:32,285 --> 01:26:33,922
<i>Todd, shovel.</i>

1864
01:26:33,981 --> 01:26:35,848
Yes, ma'am.

1865
01:26:35,901 --> 01:26:37,571
Here you go, little man.

1866
01:26:42,845 --> 01:26:45,671
I think it's my destiny
to do the news.

1867
01:26:45,725 --> 01:26:48,071
The news chooses us, little man.

1868
01:26:48,125 --> 01:26:51,137
The news chooses us.

1869
01:26:51,197 --> 01:26:52,834
May I'? Sure.

1870
01:26:52,894 --> 01:26:53,920
Thank you.

1871
01:26:55,037 --> 01:26:56,096
Good evening, Culver.

1872
01:26:56,157 --> 01:26:57,892
I'm Vinny Savage reporting live

1873
01:26:57,950 --> 01:27:00,099
from the site where the
Whittmore treasure is hidden.

1874
01:27:00,157 --> 01:27:01,794
Come on.

1875
01:27:01,853 --> 01:27:02,912
<i>Look, there's something.</i>

1876
01:27:02,973 --> 01:27:04,578
How do you feel? Awesome.

1877
01:27:04,605 --> 01:27:07,617
How do you feel? Proud.

1878
01:27:07,677 --> 01:27:08,677
Come on.

1879
01:27:10,174 --> 01:27:12,705
How do you feel? I feel dirty.

1880
01:27:14,429 --> 01:27:15,847
This is kind of a big deal.

1881
01:27:20,093 --> 01:27:21,599
I see something. There it is.

1882
01:27:29,757 --> 01:27:31,459
Here we go.

1883
01:27:39,293 --> 01:27:40,482
What's wrong, Albie'?

1884
01:27:42,877 --> 01:27:44,230
It doesn't feel right.

1885
01:27:44,285 --> 01:27:46,052
Well, what doesn't
feel right, honey?

1886
01:27:46,109 --> 01:27:48,160
Opening it alone.

1887
01:27:48,222 --> 01:27:50,022
Aw. Aw.

1888
01:27:50,077 --> 01:27:52,325
Hey, guys. I'm needed.

1889
01:27:52,349 --> 01:27:52,830
Thank you.

1890
01:27:52,893 --> 01:27:54,944
All right. Ready?

1891
01:27:55,198 --> 01:27:56,198
Come on, Vinny.

1892
01:27:59,069 --> 01:28:00,069
It's a mirror.

1893
01:28:02,461 --> 01:28:04,229
It's just a mirror.

1894
01:28:04,285 --> 01:28:05,791
Wait, lookit.

1895
01:28:05,853 --> 01:28:07,359
"Take a look, for what you see"

1896
01:28:07,389 --> 01:28:09,767
"is truly your greatest
treasure."

1897
01:28:12,925 --> 01:28:15,042
<i>H's us.</i>

1898
01:28:16,957 --> 01:28:18,398
<i>We're the treasure.</i>

1899
01:28:18,461 --> 01:28:20,163
Well, it's a nice box.

1900
01:28:22,685 --> 01:28:24,289
May I see this'?

1901
01:28:24,350 --> 01:28:25,474
Yeah. Thank you.

1902
01:28:27,485 --> 01:28:28,925
Hi.

1903
01:28:30,973 --> 01:28:33,668
My heart is truly warm
with emotion.

1904
01:28:33,725 --> 01:28:35,525
Here I thought
we would find gold

1905
01:28:35,549 --> 01:28:37,698
or diamonds or toys

1906
01:28:37,725 --> 01:28:39,645
or even candy, but...

1907
01:28:39,710 --> 01:28:41,412
the treasure is ourselves.

1908
01:28:41,437 --> 01:28:43,521
How poignant.

1909
01:28:43,581 --> 01:28:45,414
It was an honor
doing the news with you.

1910
01:28:45,470 --> 01:28:47,107
Thank you. Good job, kid.

1911
01:28:47,165 --> 01:28:48,165
Am I fired'?

1912
01:28:48,221 --> 01:28:50,175
Look.

1913
01:28:50,237 --> 01:28:51,459
Guys, guys, look.

1914
01:28:51,517 --> 01:28:52,838
It says, "Look underneath."

1915
01:28:54,173 --> 01:28:55,395
No, wait, that's this, guys.

1916
01:28:55,453 --> 01:28:56,708
Look. Keep digging?

1917
01:28:56,765 --> 01:28:57,791
What'? The lift'?

1918
01:28:57,853 --> 01:28:59,074
Yeah. Pull it.

1919
01:29:02,621 --> 01:29:03,745
That's a treasure.

1920
01:29:03,773 --> 01:29:05,672
Cash money. Cha-ching.

1921
01:29:05,693 --> 01:29:07,941
Wait, there's more.

1922
01:29:08,189 --> 01:29:10,338
It's the deed
to Whittmore's estate.

1923
01:29:10,397 --> 01:29:11,456
We get a mansion?

1924
01:29:11,517 --> 01:29:12,990
Whoa.

1925
01:29:13,053 --> 01:29:16,414
What are you going to do now'?
You're one rich little boy.

1926
01:29:16,477 --> 01:29:18,179
I was already rich.

1927
01:29:20,093 --> 01:29:22,722
Well, I don't know
about you, Culver,

1928
01:29:22,781 --> 01:29:25,029
but I think this kid
is onto something.

1929
01:29:25,085 --> 01:29:27,682
I'm Daisy Larson,
Channel 11 News.

1930
01:29:44,125 --> 01:29:45,282
Hey, you, listen up.

1931
01:29:45,341 --> 01:29:46,596
I will be back in an hour.

1932
01:29:46,653 --> 01:29:48,374
Okay'? I don't want
to be late for the show.

1933
01:29:48,477 --> 01:29:50,856
I wouldn't miss it.
Thanks for bringing me here.

1934
01:29:50,909 --> 01:29:52,098
Yeah. Anytime.

1935
01:29:53,757 --> 01:29:55,841
See you.

1936
01:29:55,901 --> 01:29:57,636
<i>Well, hang on, no.</i>

1937
01:29:57,693 --> 01:29:59,460
<i>You need to move
the boat to the middle</i>

1938
01:29:59,517 --> 01:30:01,477
because otherwise it's going
to be touching his hand

1939
01:30:01,501 --> 01:30:04,295
when he is riding. It's
going to irritate his hand.

1940
01:30:04,349 --> 01:30:05,925
<i>It's going to be scratching
all up on his hand.</i>

1941
01:30:05,949 --> 01:30:07,935
You can't take it off.
It's a present.

1942
01:30:07,965 --> 01:30:11,206
Well, still, he's going
to ride it... He's here.

1943
01:30:11,261 --> 01:30:12,734
<i>Well, hi, hi.</i>

1944
01:30:12,797 --> 01:30:14,848
We figured
you could buy your own,

1945
01:30:14,909 --> 01:30:17,287
but I think she belongs to you.

1946
01:30:18,269 --> 01:30:19,269
Ta-da!

1947
01:30:19,293 --> 01:30:20,231
Wow.

1948
01:30:20,285 --> 01:30:22,085
I've never had a bike before.

1949
01:30:22,109 --> 01:30:24,008
This is great.

1950
01:30:24,029 --> 01:30:24,640
Thanks.

1951
01:30:24,701 --> 01:30:27,015
Is that Old Man Kettle's bike?
Mm-hmm.

1952
01:30:27,037 --> 01:30:28,357
You guys up for a rematch?

1953
01:30:28,381 --> 01:30:29,407
Let's do it.

1954
01:30:29,469 --> 01:30:32,196
But I'm not going easy
on you this time.

1955
01:30:36,541 --> 01:30:37,763
<i>Ley's frail.</i>

1956
01:30:37,821 --> 01:30:40,320
All right, down the hill,

1957
01:30:40,381 --> 01:30:42,913
through the dirt track and
hang a left at the graveyard.

1958
01:30:42,973 --> 01:30:44,839
That's where dead people are.

1959
01:30:46,461 --> 01:30:48,032
First one back wins.

1960
01:30:48,093 --> 01:30:49,348
Graveyard?

1961
01:30:49,373 --> 01:30:52,930
Ready, set, go!

1962
01:32:24,221 --> 01:32:26,120
Recently, a disgruntled
audience member

1963
01:32:26,172 --> 01:32:28,224
tried to check a tomato
at my face.

1964
01:32:28,285 --> 01:32:30,718
And I'm telling you,
I am off carbs.

1965
01:32:30,749 --> 01:32:32,029
I'm only accepting a porterhouse

1966
01:32:32,061 --> 01:32:33,349
or a nice Chéteaubriand.

1967
01:32:35,709 --> 01:32:38,437
So my niece and nephew
are in from the big city.

1968
01:32:38,493 --> 01:32:40,709
And apparently,
my doll collection

1969
01:32:40,733 --> 01:32:42,370
is not cool.

1970
01:32:42,429 --> 01:32:44,808
Yeah, they've officially
declared me

1971
01:32:44,861 --> 01:32:46,466
one of the town elders.

1972
01:32:48,508 --> 01:32:51,008
You know how you give
directions in a small town'?

1973
01:32:51,037 --> 01:32:52,357
Now, this is how
we do it, right'?

1974
01:32:52,381 --> 01:32:54,782
We don't say, "Get on the 405 S."

1975
01:32:54,845 --> 01:32:56,285
"Take the 10 E." No, no.

1976
01:32:56,349 --> 01:32:58,727
Too many numbers.
Too complicated.

1977
01:32:58,781 --> 01:33:02,087
We say, "You're going to go past
the cornfield on your left."

1978
01:33:02,141 --> 01:33:04,008
"And when you get to the
end of that cornfield,"

1979
01:33:04,029 --> 01:33:06,626
"there's going to be some cows
agrazing on your right."

1980
01:33:06,685 --> 01:33:08,639
<i>“And there's a fork in the road.</i>

1981
01:33:08,701 --> 01:33:11,045
"Don't go to the left. Don't go
to the left. Go to the right."

1982
01:33:11,069 --> 01:33:12,989
"You go in the lake,
you've gone too far."

1983
01:33:14,524 --> 01:33:16,925
So, you guys,
you know it's a small town

1984
01:33:16,989 --> 01:33:20,000
when on Halloween, you just
need one bag of candy.

1985
01:33:20,061 --> 01:33:23,902
And you have the luxury of eating
half of it yourself.

1986
01:33:23,933 --> 01:33:26,726
<i>Thank you, thank you.</i>
