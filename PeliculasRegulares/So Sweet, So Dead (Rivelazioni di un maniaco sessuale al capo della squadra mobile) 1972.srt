1
00:00:04,317 --> 00:00:06,433
Shoot lots of closeups.

2
00:00:18,317 --> 00:00:22,356
- Found anything yet?
- Just a collection of compacts.

3
00:00:55,797 --> 00:00:58,027
- Here, inspector.
- Thanks.

4
00:00:58,117 --> 00:01:00,551
No fingerprints, inspector.

5
00:01:04,437 --> 00:01:06,029
Naturally...

6
00:01:06,597 --> 00:01:09,236
- And no other leads?
- No.

7
00:01:09,317 --> 00:01:12,548
Here's the permission
to remove the body.

8
00:01:12,637 --> 00:01:16,755
- So early?
- The examining magistrate's in a hurry.

9
00:01:16,837 --> 00:01:18,555
Alright.

10
00:01:22,037 --> 00:01:24,028
The hearse is here,
inspector.

11
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:26,392
- Inspector...
- Just carry on.

12
00:01:28,757 --> 00:01:32,227
- Are you finished here?
- Yes, couldn't find anything.

13
00:02:01,957 --> 00:02:06,269
SO SWEET, SO DEAD

14
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:29,632
They were slashed with a blade...
a very sharp one.

15
00:03:29,717 --> 00:03:31,992
In the area of the mouth
and the chin...

16
00:03:34,237 --> 00:03:38,549
... there are marks of a hand,
like a vice.

17
00:03:38,637 --> 00:03:41,913
l believe the deed
happened like this:

18
00:03:41,997 --> 00:03:44,670
He must have
grabbed her like this...

19
00:03:45,437 --> 00:03:48,986
<i>- ... and then the mortal cut.
- And the other injuries?</i>

20
00:03:51,517 --> 00:03:56,147
A series of uncontrolled stabs.
But not to the living person...

21
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:58,546
... but to
the dead body.

22
00:03:58,637 --> 00:04:01,276
To stab someone like that
you must hate him...

23
00:04:01,357 --> 00:04:02,676
... or be a maniac.

24
00:04:02,757 --> 00:04:07,114
Photos were found next to the woman,
showing her in the arms of a man.

25
00:04:07,197 --> 00:04:08,755
A lover, presumably.

26
00:04:08,837 --> 00:04:12,591
- His face was made unrecognizable.
- It's possible.

27
00:04:12,677 --> 00:04:15,874
As soon as you're finished, doctor,
I'd like to have your report.

28
00:04:15,957 --> 00:04:18,710
Certainly, inspector.
In full detail.

29
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:21,395
Shall we go?

30
00:04:32,117 --> 00:04:34,836
l examined the photos
left beside the body.

31
00:04:34,917 --> 00:04:38,466
If we figure out
why the man's face was erased...

32
00:04:38,557 --> 00:04:42,232
<i>- ... we might have a lead.
- Why not?</i>

33
00:04:42,317 --> 00:04:47,391
The face was scratched away
with a razor or something similar.

34
00:04:47,477 --> 00:04:52,835
We could blow up the photos to see
if there are any moles or other blemishes.

35
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,635
But then what?

36
00:04:55,277 --> 00:04:57,552
Should we ask every male in town
to strip for us?

37
00:04:57,637 --> 00:05:01,186
I'd take a look around
the environment of the victim.

38
00:05:02,997 --> 00:05:05,591
Right. But unfortunately,
that's a very closed world.

39
00:05:05,677 --> 00:05:07,793
She was the wife
of a general.

40
00:05:07,877 --> 00:05:13,873
You think her friends will tell us
with whom she went to bed?

41
00:05:13,957 --> 00:05:16,266
And what do you
intend to do now?

42
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,791
I'll throw out the net...

43
00:05:18,877 --> 00:05:23,189
... and hope we'll catch
all the right fishes.

44
00:05:24,077 --> 00:05:29,595
You said, at the day in question,
you had some tests done at the hospital.

45
00:05:29,677 --> 00:05:32,908
You're just wasting
your time with me.

46
00:05:32,997 --> 00:05:37,866
l don't go to whores,
and I pity the guys who do. Poor fellas...

47
00:05:37,957 --> 00:05:42,633
Ah yeah! Maybe you hate them.
Isn't that right, Cleopatra?

48
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:46,312
All men should be brothers.
l really don't hate anybody.

49
00:05:46,397 --> 00:05:48,991
And why do you keep saying "murderer"?
Could be a lady.

50
00:05:49,077 --> 00:05:51,796
Yes, sure.
And what would you be?

51
00:05:51,877 --> 00:05:54,869
One who doesn't get on anybody's tits.
On the contrary...

52
00:05:54,957 --> 00:05:59,553
- Her husband, a general, untouchable.
- Be quiet.

53
00:05:59,637 --> 00:06:01,593
- Inspector!
- Inspector, sir!

54
00:06:03,957 --> 00:06:06,266
Those losers.
It's always us.

55
00:06:06,357 --> 00:06:07,915
Yeah, right.

56
00:06:10,197 --> 00:06:12,188
Look who's coming.

57
00:06:12,797 --> 00:06:16,949
- Hey Cleopatra, how's the pharaoh?
- Good one!

58
00:06:17,917 --> 00:06:20,989
- I got rid of the journalists.
- They're always expecting a miracle.

59
00:06:21,077 --> 00:06:24,513
- If they were in our place...
- Found out anything?

60
00:06:24,597 --> 00:06:28,431
No, these folks belong to
a whole different circle.

61
00:06:31,077 --> 00:06:34,274
Well, I think it's no use,
but keep interrogating them.

62
00:06:34,357 --> 00:06:37,110
- I'm going home.
- Alright, inspector.

63
00:06:37,877 --> 00:06:40,391
- Call me if you need me.
- Sure thing.

64
00:06:43,157 --> 00:06:46,308
Aw, the asshole's taking off...
And we're supposed to spend the night here?

65
00:06:46,397 --> 00:06:50,993
- Are you paying for the business I lose?
- Calm down, calm down!

66
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,511
Now we'll type up
a nice report.

67
00:06:53,597 --> 00:06:58,034
After that you may all go back
to your honorable jobs.

68
00:07:00,357 --> 00:07:02,109
His job
ain't too shabby either...

69
00:07:02,197 --> 00:07:04,552
What's bothering you?

70
00:07:04,637 --> 00:07:06,912
Try to stay calm.

71
00:07:06,997 --> 00:07:08,589
Relax...

72
00:07:09,277 --> 00:07:11,347
... and stop worrying
so much.

73
00:07:11,917 --> 00:07:16,274
Yes, it's easy to say that.
This is worse than the mob.

74
00:07:17,077 --> 00:07:19,033
Just unbelievable.

75
00:07:19,117 --> 00:07:22,792
- No trace of her lover.
- What did you expect?

76
00:07:23,397 --> 00:07:28,346
And who should name him?
The betrayed husband? The parents?

77
00:07:28,437 --> 00:07:30,473
Think of the scandal.

78
00:07:30,557 --> 00:07:34,072
The problems are always
for those left behind.

79
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,073
Like me, for instance.

80
00:07:37,717 --> 00:07:40,550
The papers are attacking us,
and the commissioner gave me hell.

81
00:07:40,637 --> 00:07:43,071
"Bring me some proof,
and do it quick!

82
00:07:44,077 --> 00:07:47,308
Try harder, Capuana.
But be very careful!

83
00:07:47,397 --> 00:07:49,991
Don't step on anybody's feet,
I'm begging you."

84
00:07:50,077 --> 00:07:53,990
- That's the motto.
- Do it. Make him happy.

85
00:07:54,077 --> 00:07:57,706
- What can it cost you?
- And how should I do that?

86
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:00,029
Every step I take
is wrong.

87
00:08:00,117 --> 00:08:03,189
Today, everything's different.
l can't question people anymore.

88
00:08:03,277 --> 00:08:05,393
That's the
magistrate's job now.

89
00:08:05,477 --> 00:08:08,514
If you catch one,
he won't spill the beans...

90
00:08:09,077 --> 00:08:11,591
... or shows up
with his lawyer in tow.

91
00:08:11,677 --> 00:08:15,386
If they don't say anything,
there's nothing I can do.

92
00:08:15,477 --> 00:08:18,116
Whoever the murderer is...

93
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:21,075
... how's it possible
he didn't leave any traces behind?

94
00:08:21,157 --> 00:08:23,717
He's very smart
and cunning.

95
00:08:23,797 --> 00:08:27,346
But these photos of the naked victims
and their lovers...

96
00:08:28,317 --> 00:08:32,629
... they have some purpose.
They're our lead, our only one.

97
00:08:33,277 --> 00:08:36,030
Do you think
he's from around?

98
00:08:37,797 --> 00:08:39,594
l think so, yes.

99
00:08:40,277 --> 00:08:42,586
He acted very skillfully.

100
00:09:55,077 --> 00:09:57,386
Didn't you say we have
to leave here earlier?

101
00:09:57,477 --> 00:09:59,274
Unfortunately, yes.

102
00:10:03,117 --> 00:10:05,472
You know how it is
with my husband.

103
00:10:05,557 --> 00:10:09,869
When he organizes a bridge evening,
he's furious when I'm late.

104
00:10:21,557 --> 00:10:23,866
l better get going then.

105
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,391
But you should
hurry too, Serena.

106
00:10:27,077 --> 00:10:29,545
First I have to make myself
presentable, Gianni.

107
00:10:29,637 --> 00:10:31,832
To me,
you already are.

108
00:10:31,917 --> 00:10:34,556
Did you know that you look best
when you're naked?

109
00:10:34,637 --> 00:10:37,709
- Didn't anybody tell you yet?
- What's this?

110
00:10:37,797 --> 00:10:41,790
An interrogation?
You want me to confess?

111
00:10:41,877 --> 00:10:44,232
l won't fall for that.

112
00:10:44,317 --> 00:10:46,353
So you have been
told that before.

113
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:50,032
You don't seem to object,
do you?

114
00:10:53,557 --> 00:10:55,513
Just keep playing
with me.

115
00:10:59,197 --> 00:11:01,153
- I'll see you soon.
- Yes.

116
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,067
No! No!

117
00:12:39,237 --> 00:12:41,387
No! No!

118
00:14:39,157 --> 00:14:41,876
ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN
FOUND MASSACRED AT THE BEACH.

119
00:14:41,957 --> 00:14:44,425
ALL POLICEMEN OF THE TOWN
ARE LOOKING FOR LEADS...

120
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:46,155
... THAT MIGHT
CONVICT THE KILLER.

121
00:14:48,157 --> 00:14:50,751
Your panic
is absolutely unjustified.

122
00:14:51,397 --> 00:14:54,389
No one could recognize you
in that photo.

123
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:57,708
I advice you as your lawyer
to stay calm.

124
00:14:58,637 --> 00:15:02,471
- Let them do their work.
- But somebody knows about Serena and me.

125
00:15:02,557 --> 00:15:04,070
So what?

126
00:15:05,077 --> 00:15:07,307
That inspector
is clever.

127
00:15:08,197 --> 00:15:11,587
He cares about his position
and his career.

128
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:16,034
Stay calm.
He knows he has to move very carefully.

129
00:15:16,117 --> 00:15:20,235
- With the most guarded discretion.
- But maybe he'll get the wrong ideas.

130
00:15:20,317 --> 00:15:22,467
With a butchered woman,
the first suspect...

131
00:15:22,557 --> 00:15:25,708
<i>- ... will be the lover or the husband.
- Yes, yes, that's right.</i>

132
00:15:25,797 --> 00:15:28,550
But not in our circles.

133
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:30,946
The first victim
was the wife of a general.

134
00:15:31,037 --> 00:15:35,553
And the second one, your poor Serena,
she had an important name.

135
00:15:35,637 --> 00:15:40,028
- One of the really important people.
- And now? What should I do?

136
00:15:40,637 --> 00:15:43,515
Go on living
like nothing happened.

137
00:15:43,597 --> 00:15:46,191
And if the inspector
does show up one day...

138
00:15:46,277 --> 00:15:47,949
... you call me
right away.

139
00:15:49,317 --> 00:15:50,830
Hello daddy.

140
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,873
I'm sorry.
l thought you were alone.

141
00:15:52,957 --> 00:15:54,709
We're finished. I was about to leave.
How are you?

142
00:15:54,797 --> 00:15:56,753
- Fine, thanks.
- Is there a problem?

143
00:15:56,837 --> 00:15:59,431
No problem.
We can discuss it later. Bye.

144
00:15:59,517 --> 00:16:00,393
Bye.

145
00:16:06,197 --> 00:16:07,869
Don't take off, okay?

146
00:16:07,957 --> 00:16:11,233
Go play tennis.
Don't forget the bridge evenings.

147
00:16:11,317 --> 00:16:14,195
Business as usual.
And try to stay calm.

148
00:16:14,277 --> 00:16:18,190
Alright, I'll do my best.
But it's not gonna be easy...

149
00:16:23,597 --> 00:16:26,555
This second murder
is a carbon copy of the first one.

150
00:16:26,637 --> 00:16:28,787
The murder weapon
was the same, too.

151
00:16:28,877 --> 00:16:31,550
Everything matches
the Fioravanti case.

152
00:16:31,637 --> 00:16:36,028
- Even the method used in killing her.
- And the photos with the lover.

153
00:16:36,117 --> 00:16:38,631
How did
the husband react?

154
00:16:38,717 --> 00:16:40,753
He's in a state
of collapse.

155
00:16:40,837 --> 00:16:43,351
He didn't suspect his wife
to be a whore.

156
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:46,907
But are you sure he had nothing to do
with the murder of his wife?

157
00:16:46,997 --> 00:16:50,307
Maybe he's just pretending.
Maybe he was out for revenge.

158
00:16:50,397 --> 00:16:53,514
We checked his alibi.
It's all in order.

159
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:56,065
We're also keeping an eye
on her lover.

160
00:16:56,157 --> 00:16:57,795
We know he consulted
his lawyer...

161
00:16:57,877 --> 00:17:00,914
... but nothing else,
no misstep.

162
00:17:00,997 --> 00:17:04,148
It sure would be odd if he'd taken
photographs of himseIf and his mistress...

163
00:17:04,237 --> 00:17:06,512
... and then put them
next to her corpse.

164
00:17:06,597 --> 00:17:09,748
- Even if his face was erased.
- Sure.

165
00:17:12,397 --> 00:17:13,876
That's Gastone.

166
00:17:13,957 --> 00:17:16,152
The one who prepares
the cadavers.

167
00:17:16,237 --> 00:17:20,276
He always laughs like that
when he approves of his own work.

168
00:17:20,357 --> 00:17:23,030
Come. Have a look.

169
00:17:37,517 --> 00:17:40,156
- Come in! Come in, professor!
- Hello Gastone.

170
00:17:40,237 --> 00:17:42,193
You can't see the cut
on her throat anymore!

171
00:17:42,277 --> 00:17:47,067
And also the other injuries!
Look! You too, inspector!

172
00:17:48,237 --> 00:17:51,752
- Look! She's beautiful!
- Gastone is an artist.

173
00:17:52,437 --> 00:17:54,428
A real artist.

174
00:17:55,397 --> 00:17:58,195
With wax and make-up
he makes miracles.

175
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,552
He loves his work.

176
00:18:00,637 --> 00:18:04,789
Now dress her, put her in the coffin,
and set it up in the mortuary.

177
00:18:04,877 --> 00:18:08,153
- Her parents will be here in an hour.
- Okay.

178
00:18:26,557 --> 00:18:30,914
How beautiful you are.
Almost prettier than when you were living.

179
00:21:16,037 --> 00:21:17,595
Stop!

180
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:21,272
- Rewind it a little.
- Why? What did you see, Capuana?

181
00:21:21,357 --> 00:21:24,190
These are only people
we already know.

182
00:21:24,277 --> 00:21:26,393
All of them unsuspicious.

183
00:21:26,477 --> 00:21:28,115
Go ahead!

184
00:21:37,877 --> 00:21:39,435
Stop! Keep it there!

185
00:21:40,517 --> 00:21:42,633
It's terrible.

186
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:49,830
Poor Serena, she really
didn't deserve to die like that.

187
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:52,636
- Such a horrible death.
- That's true.

188
00:21:52,717 --> 00:21:55,277
And her husband,
did you see him?

189
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:56,915
A broken man.

190
00:21:56,997 --> 00:22:00,672
Considering all the things the
newspapers write, I'm getting scared, too.

191
00:22:00,757 --> 00:22:02,315
You're scared?

192
00:22:02,917 --> 00:22:05,556
And why
should you be scared?

193
00:22:05,637 --> 00:22:09,152
Because the papers say
the killer is a crazed moral avenger...

194
00:22:09,237 --> 00:22:12,115
... and it seems only logic to me that...
You catch my drift...?

195
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:14,631
l don't know
what's there to catch.

196
00:22:14,717 --> 00:22:17,106
He only kills
unfaithful wives.

197
00:22:17,717 --> 00:22:20,914
You're right, Barbara.
You shouldn't be scared, Franca...

198
00:22:20,997 --> 00:22:22,669
... at least as far
as I'm informed.

199
00:22:22,757 --> 00:22:26,147
l don't think that's funny.
First Floriana...

200
00:22:26,237 --> 00:22:30,116
... then Serena, and now what?
Who's next?

201
00:22:30,197 --> 00:22:34,748
Nonsense, don't let this get into your head.
Don't meet trouble halfway.

202
00:22:34,837 --> 00:22:39,308
It's about time.
Can't we change the subject?

203
00:22:39,397 --> 00:22:41,149
Good, let's talk
about men.

204
00:22:41,237 --> 00:22:43,626
It's not really worth the risk.
Don't you think?

205
00:22:43,717 --> 00:22:46,231
- Do you?
- Don't you as well?

206
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:52,075
The husband's ruled out,
and so is the lover.

207
00:22:54,237 --> 00:22:58,230
All in all, Capuana,
we have absolutely nothing.

208
00:22:58,317 --> 00:22:59,511
Oh well...

209
00:23:00,077 --> 00:23:02,671
That's the way it is,
commissioner.

210
00:23:03,237 --> 00:23:05,876
l have checked
and re-checked.

211
00:23:07,797 --> 00:23:11,790
l could still arrest the husband
if you think it's of any use.

212
00:23:11,877 --> 00:23:15,472
For Heaven's sake!
Anybody, just not the husband.

213
00:23:15,557 --> 00:23:18,071
You know
he's in the public eye.

214
00:23:18,157 --> 00:23:21,991
You see this phone?
It hasn't stop ringing since yesterday.

215
00:23:22,077 --> 00:23:26,229
Many recommendations.
Some real exquisite ones among them.

216
00:23:26,317 --> 00:23:28,194
- You have any proof against him?
- No.

217
00:23:28,277 --> 00:23:31,667
- Then leave him alone.
- No, no proofs.

218
00:23:31,757 --> 00:23:34,510
He only thought about politics,
and she about love.

219
00:23:34,597 --> 00:23:39,671
The unfortunate truth is that we're sitting
on a barrel of dynamite, my dear Capuana.

220
00:23:39,757 --> 00:23:42,908
One false move
and we all fry.

221
00:23:44,477 --> 00:23:48,470
And to be honest:
l find it pleasant to live in this town.

222
00:23:48,557 --> 00:23:51,390
- And you, my friend?
- Same here.

223
00:23:52,357 --> 00:23:57,192
But I think there's as much rotten
in small towns as there is in big cities.

224
00:23:57,717 --> 00:24:00,629
Wherever they transfer me,
l know what to expect.

225
00:24:00,717 --> 00:24:02,833
Do you have a plan?

226
00:24:04,197 --> 00:24:07,075
No. The killer knows
the habits of his victims...

227
00:24:07,157 --> 00:24:10,627
... so he knows his way around
the rich parts of the town.

228
00:24:12,877 --> 00:24:15,232
- That's where I have to look for him.
- But be careful.

229
00:24:15,317 --> 00:24:18,514
l don't want you to venture
into even higher circles.

230
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:48,511
No... not here...

231
00:24:49,957 --> 00:24:51,675
Please.

232
00:24:53,037 --> 00:24:55,187
I'm scared, darling.

233
00:25:00,357 --> 00:25:02,746
l don't like this place.

234
00:25:05,117 --> 00:25:08,712
It's dangerous... all alone out here.
I'm begging you.

235
00:25:11,717 --> 00:25:15,915
But what are you afraid of, my love?
You don't think I'm the killer, do you?

236
00:25:15,997 --> 00:25:20,309
What are you saying?
But why out here in the open?

237
00:25:21,717 --> 00:25:24,834
It's not easy to find an apartment.
And I don't want to go to your place.

238
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:28,466
If it's about money,
don't worry about it.

239
00:25:29,717 --> 00:25:33,392
Come on,
I'm begging you, let's go.

240
00:25:33,477 --> 00:25:36,310
- But Renata...
- I'm begging you.

241
00:25:40,357 --> 00:25:42,109
- It's you, inspector?
- Don't worry...

242
00:25:42,197 --> 00:25:45,394
... I'm not here in an
official capacity, Mr. Gastone.

243
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:50,073
l was passing by your house and thought
l might have a chat with Gastone...

244
00:25:50,157 --> 00:25:52,625
... the right hand
of Casali.

245
00:25:53,397 --> 00:25:55,035
How long have you been working
with the professor?

246
00:25:55,117 --> 00:25:58,792
- Two years. Ever since I got here.
- Ah, very nice.

247
00:25:58,877 --> 00:26:01,516
- Please, do come in.
- Thank you.

248
00:26:02,517 --> 00:26:04,508
Very cozy in here.

249
00:26:05,557 --> 00:26:07,434
Yes, please have a seat.

250
00:26:10,517 --> 00:26:12,109
Smoke?

251
00:26:16,677 --> 00:26:19,794
- You were saying?
- I didn't say anything.

252
00:26:21,517 --> 00:26:23,030
Ah yes...

253
00:26:23,837 --> 00:26:26,795
- Do you like your work?
- I sure do.

254
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:28,947
Otherwise
l wouldn't do it.

255
00:26:29,037 --> 00:26:32,632
As you wouldn't do yours
if you didn't like it.

256
00:26:33,197 --> 00:26:34,869
Well said.

257
00:26:36,237 --> 00:26:38,797
And what do you do
when you're not working?

258
00:26:38,877 --> 00:26:41,311
l rarely go out.

259
00:26:41,917 --> 00:26:43,908
l take care
of my flowers.

260
00:26:45,317 --> 00:26:48,787
A nice place.
Very well kept.

261
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,706
You live alone?

262
00:26:56,037 --> 00:26:59,029
You want to know
why I'm not married?

263
00:27:01,117 --> 00:27:04,075
Oh, no, that's none
of my business.

264
00:27:04,157 --> 00:27:05,909
It's lovely here.

265
00:27:06,837 --> 00:27:08,668
Nice and bright
in here.

266
00:27:09,397 --> 00:27:12,434
- And what's over there?
- The bathroom and the kitchen.

267
00:27:12,517 --> 00:27:14,075
l only have two rooms.

268
00:27:14,157 --> 00:27:19,311
It's not easy for a man of my profession
to find a woman, you know?

269
00:27:20,637 --> 00:27:23,947
Sooner or later
they find out...

270
00:27:25,597 --> 00:27:27,667
... about the corpses.

271
00:27:27,757 --> 00:27:31,511
And then it's over
before it even started.

272
00:27:35,437 --> 00:27:37,428
And what is this?

273
00:27:37,517 --> 00:27:39,951
It's a small photo lab.

274
00:27:42,597 --> 00:27:45,236
Well, this is not
a search.

275
00:27:45,317 --> 00:27:47,512
l will go now.

276
00:27:48,317 --> 00:27:51,229
Do you want
to have a look at it?

277
00:27:51,317 --> 00:27:54,036
- If you don't mind.
- I don't.

278
00:27:54,117 --> 00:27:55,709
Please.

279
00:28:00,997 --> 00:28:04,148
- I have to tell you something, inspector.
- Go on.

280
00:28:04,237 --> 00:28:06,831
This might sound absurd...

281
00:28:06,917 --> 00:28:11,149
... but if you didn't know them,
would you think they're dead?

282
00:28:11,237 --> 00:28:13,705
Look, how beautiful
they are.

283
00:28:15,357 --> 00:28:19,987
More beautiful than alive.
Death cleansed them.

284
00:28:20,077 --> 00:28:22,910
No more traces of sin
or human misery.

285
00:28:22,997 --> 00:28:26,512
And all thanks to me.
That's why I love my work.

286
00:28:30,597 --> 00:28:33,634
- You see? Three Minutes.
- Agostini would have made it faster.

287
00:28:33,717 --> 00:28:35,355
Very funny.

288
00:28:36,517 --> 00:28:39,236
Besides, I'm driving slower
when I'm with you.

289
00:28:52,917 --> 00:28:54,509
- You know what?
- You like me.

290
00:28:54,597 --> 00:28:56,394
Yes, but I also like
school these days.

291
00:28:56,477 --> 00:28:59,753
And public gatherings,
talks with teachers, protests, collectives...

292
00:28:59,837 --> 00:29:02,305
l like collectives too,
but only the ones with you.

293
00:29:02,397 --> 00:29:04,831
You reactionary!
You're a spoiled bourgeois.

294
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:07,067
Not even shocking current events
shake you.

295
00:29:07,157 --> 00:29:09,830
You mean the maniac?
Who cares about him?

296
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:12,112
- He's only after the old timers.
- You're right.

297
00:29:12,197 --> 00:29:13,710
But that also affects us.

298
00:29:13,797 --> 00:29:16,470
My parents don't want me
to go out anymore.

299
00:29:17,037 --> 00:29:19,551
I have only five minutes
for you.

300
00:29:19,637 --> 00:29:22,674
You're talking like your father.
You're not a good revolutionary.

301
00:29:22,757 --> 00:29:24,509
I'll stay as long
as you want.

302
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:27,907
But I didn't come here
to talk about politics.

303
00:29:43,677 --> 00:29:45,668
Yes?
What do you want?

304
00:29:45,757 --> 00:29:49,511
You're mistaken.
This is the residence of the lawyer Santangeli.

305
00:29:50,157 --> 00:29:52,193
Why did you hang up?

306
00:29:54,117 --> 00:29:56,836
Was that the guy who always dials
the wrong number?

307
00:29:56,917 --> 00:29:59,351
Who?
I don't know what you mean, Paolo.

308
00:29:59,437 --> 00:30:02,986
You do know what I mean.
Don't try to make me an idiot.

309
00:30:03,077 --> 00:30:06,513
You think I don't know your latest mistress,
even though she lives next door?

310
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:10,112
- I'm taking the same liberties as you do!
- Very well.

311
00:30:10,197 --> 00:30:13,473
That was plain enough.
But we shouldn't forget something:

312
00:30:13,557 --> 00:30:14,751
What?

313
00:30:15,557 --> 00:30:17,787
We have
a reputation to lose.

314
00:30:17,877 --> 00:30:22,314
And with that reputation
our wealth, this house and a daughter.

315
00:30:22,397 --> 00:30:25,070
Are you speaking for me
or for you?

316
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:26,988
For both of us.

317
00:30:27,797 --> 00:30:30,391
Your private life
doesn't interest me.

318
00:30:30,477 --> 00:30:32,866
But I don't want a scandal.

319
00:30:33,757 --> 00:30:35,827
It's strange, this killer...

320
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,829
He's only after...
adulteresses.

321
00:30:38,917 --> 00:30:40,953
So what?
He might rid you of me!

322
00:30:41,037 --> 00:30:45,588
- You would like that, wouldn't you?
- No. Not at this price.

323
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:49,192
Please do me a favor:
Pay another visit to your mother.

324
00:30:49,277 --> 00:30:51,950
Like you do so often these days.
But this time, you actually go.

325
00:30:52,037 --> 00:30:54,187
You thought about everything,
didn't you?

326
00:30:54,277 --> 00:30:58,190
In my opinion, this solution
is acceptable and elegant.

327
00:30:58,277 --> 00:31:01,872
When all this is over,
you can come back here without fear.

328
00:31:01,957 --> 00:31:05,586
Please do as I tell you, Franca.
You're in danger.

329
00:31:15,317 --> 00:31:25,317
Lilly!

330
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:26,033
Lilly!

331
00:32:16,677 --> 00:32:17,826
Hello daddy.

332
00:32:18,877 --> 00:32:20,435
- Everything okay at school?
- Yes.

333
00:32:20,517 --> 00:32:22,109
- Bye.
- Bye.

334
00:32:29,677 --> 00:32:30,712
Good afternoon.

335
00:32:31,717 --> 00:32:34,072
Wonderful flowers,
madam.

336
00:32:34,157 --> 00:32:37,547
- To the envy of my wife.
- Your wife doesn't care about them.

337
00:32:37,637 --> 00:32:39,195
How's your husband?

338
00:32:39,277 --> 00:32:42,235
He doesn't care about anything,
he's not well.

339
00:32:42,317 --> 00:32:46,026
I'll see you in the evening.
At 6 p.m.

340
00:32:47,437 --> 00:32:48,756
The usual place.

341
00:32:49,637 --> 00:32:51,389
Scaredy-cat.

342
00:33:10,077 --> 00:33:12,591
No, inspector,
you're following a wrong path.

343
00:33:12,677 --> 00:33:16,750
Gastone sure is a strange fella,
but harmless.

344
00:33:16,837 --> 00:33:20,227
He has this morbid passion...
for corpses.

345
00:33:20,317 --> 00:33:23,707
He beautifies and photographs them,
but that's all.

346
00:33:24,357 --> 00:33:27,269
l once knew someone
who would smash valuable vases...

347
00:33:27,357 --> 00:33:30,030
<i>- ... just so he could fix them again.
- Listen, Capuana.</i>

348
00:33:30,117 --> 00:33:35,145
l know you're desperately trying to catch
the murderer, who will surely kill again...

349
00:33:35,237 --> 00:33:38,866
<i>- ... but Gastone is not your man.
- How can you be so sure?</i>

350
00:33:38,957 --> 00:33:40,948
Well, I know him very well.

351
00:33:41,037 --> 00:33:44,188
Gastone is not capable
of committing any act of violence.

352
00:33:44,277 --> 00:33:47,986
That's why he always wants
to erase every trace of it.

353
00:33:48,837 --> 00:33:53,353
Professor Casali, I started my career
in Sicily and Sardinia...

354
00:33:53,437 --> 00:33:55,792
... where 2 + 2 = 4.

355
00:33:55,877 --> 00:33:58,266
There, every murder
has a motive.

356
00:33:59,477 --> 00:34:02,514
But what motive is there
for these crimes?

357
00:34:02,597 --> 00:34:03,916
l don't know.

358
00:34:03,997 --> 00:34:07,148
Maybe it's the work
of a homosexual.

359
00:34:07,757 --> 00:34:09,270
A homosexual?

360
00:34:09,837 --> 00:34:11,634
Yes, out of jealousy.

361
00:34:13,237 --> 00:34:15,626
My theory
is supported by the fact...

362
00:34:15,717 --> 00:34:19,232
... that all the lovers' faces
have been erased from the photos.

363
00:34:19,317 --> 00:34:22,070
- That's right.
- Or a betrayed husband.

364
00:34:22,157 --> 00:34:24,227
Just think about it:

365
00:34:24,317 --> 00:34:26,956
He kills two, three, four
unfaithful wives...

366
00:34:27,037 --> 00:34:29,392
... and then his own wife.

367
00:34:30,237 --> 00:34:32,114
Who would suspect him?

368
00:34:33,077 --> 00:34:34,476
No.

369
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:37,625
Or maybe
an impotent man.

370
00:34:38,317 --> 00:34:43,186
Impotent men often have a mortal hate
for women they cannot possess.

371
00:34:43,277 --> 00:34:46,269
In this case
we'd have a huge problem:

372
00:34:46,357 --> 00:34:50,316
How should I find an impotent man?
With a newspaper ad?

373
00:34:51,957 --> 00:34:53,310
l have to go.

374
00:34:53,397 --> 00:34:56,309
l promised my wife
to come home for supper.

375
00:34:56,397 --> 00:34:57,796
At least this one time.

376
00:34:57,877 --> 00:35:00,232
Why don't you come to my place
for dinner some time?

377
00:35:00,317 --> 00:35:02,592
Together with your wife,
of course.

378
00:35:02,677 --> 00:35:07,114
- It would be a pleasure.
- Mine too. As soon as this is over.

379
00:37:34,997 --> 00:37:37,511
It's already late.
l must go.

380
00:37:38,277 --> 00:37:40,108
Oh please...

381
00:37:40,197 --> 00:37:42,392
It's better that way,
my love.

382
00:38:30,797 --> 00:38:33,436
- What's that? You scared me!
- You're home so late?

383
00:38:33,517 --> 00:38:35,906
You've become unbearable.

384
00:38:35,997 --> 00:38:39,387
When you tried to commit suicide
because of me, as you claimed...

385
00:38:39,477 --> 00:38:42,594
... you could at least have done a decent job,
and gone to hell...

386
00:38:42,677 --> 00:38:45,350
... instead of staying here,
ruining my life.

387
00:39:24,197 --> 00:39:26,472
- Will I see you in the garden afterwards?
- Why not?

388
00:39:26,557 --> 00:39:28,991
Mother suffers from insomnia
but she'll take her pills...

389
00:39:29,077 --> 00:39:31,227
... and 15 minutes later
she's fast asleep.

390
00:39:43,837 --> 00:39:48,228
That's it, kids. Your parents don't
want you to come home so late.

391
00:39:48,317 --> 00:39:50,751
The same old story!
Totally exaggerated!

392
00:39:50,837 --> 00:39:54,716
I'm sorry.
l made a promise to your parents.

393
00:39:58,317 --> 00:39:59,716
All because
of that jerk.

394
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:03,392
- Why doesn't he screw instead of killing?
- Right on! He should have group sex.

395
00:40:03,477 --> 00:40:06,708
- I'll take you home.
- Yes, alright.

396
00:40:06,797 --> 00:40:08,071
Good night.

397
00:40:08,717 --> 00:40:10,753
- Good night.
- Good night.

398
00:40:10,837 --> 00:40:12,031
Good night, kids.

399
00:40:12,117 --> 00:40:14,836
- Bye.
- I'm sorry, it's not my fault.

400
00:40:14,917 --> 00:40:16,748
See you.

401
00:40:16,837 --> 00:40:19,351
- Good night.
- Bye.

402
00:40:19,437 --> 00:40:21,348
Bye. See you.

403
00:40:21,437 --> 00:40:24,156
- My best to your mother.
- Alright then?

404
00:40:24,237 --> 00:40:26,956
- At half past ten in the garden.
- Okay.

405
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:30,629
- Yes or no? And don't think about it!
- You know it's yes.

406
00:40:30,717 --> 00:40:32,708
Since day one.

407
00:40:44,357 --> 00:40:46,951
- Isn't that your neighbor?
- Her husband's a cripple...

408
00:40:47,037 --> 00:40:49,676
... and has to go on crutches.
She has a lover...

409
00:40:49,757 --> 00:40:51,031
... they say.
And not the first one.

410
00:40:51,117 --> 00:40:54,871
At least she has the good taste
not to bring him to her house.

411
00:40:59,837 --> 00:41:02,556
- Will you walk me to the gate?
- Sure.

412
00:41:23,597 --> 00:41:24,996
Bye.

413
00:41:25,717 --> 00:41:27,673
- Bye.
- See you tomorrow.

414
00:43:10,357 --> 00:43:14,873
Lilly!

415
00:43:15,637 --> 00:43:17,628
Where are you?

416
00:43:43,317 --> 00:43:48,311
Lilly!

417
00:44:11,717 --> 00:44:15,392
Make sure you get all the details.
Get a wide shot from every angle.

418
00:44:15,477 --> 00:44:17,672
And lots of closeups.

419
00:44:21,637 --> 00:44:24,356
- Hello Casali.
- Good morning, inspector.

420
00:44:27,037 --> 00:44:30,347
The usual photos were left
next to the body, of course.

421
00:44:32,517 --> 00:44:35,190
- An accident, I'd say.
- Me too.

422
00:44:38,277 --> 00:44:41,474
- Search all his papers.
- Yes.

423
00:44:51,477 --> 00:44:53,547
Always the same
technique.

424
00:44:54,557 --> 00:44:57,435
Is there any evidence
of a struggle?

425
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,955
Yes, sure.

426
00:45:00,557 --> 00:45:04,835
She was taken by surprise,
and tried desperately to resist.

427
00:45:06,157 --> 00:45:07,875
Just like the others.

428
00:45:07,957 --> 00:45:10,391
... three murders
in a very short time.

429
00:45:10,477 --> 00:45:14,436
The similar techniques
point to the same killer.

430
00:45:14,517 --> 00:45:17,031
All killings
seem to be unmotivated.

431
00:45:17,117 --> 00:45:18,948
The work of the police
in a case like...

432
00:45:19,637 --> 00:45:21,355
Faster, Paolo!

433
00:45:22,277 --> 00:45:24,188
You're moving too slow.

434
00:45:24,277 --> 00:45:26,347
Move, move!

435
00:45:28,077 --> 00:45:29,795
More force!

436
00:45:32,437 --> 00:45:36,066
With more force!
Spike harder! Bravo!

437
00:45:36,157 --> 00:45:38,113
Move to the net!

438
00:45:38,677 --> 00:45:40,588
Come on, come on!

439
00:45:41,917 --> 00:45:43,714
Move it!

440
00:45:44,597 --> 00:45:45,791
Piero!

441
00:45:46,757 --> 00:45:49,351
- I'm coming! Can I go?
- Go ahead!

442
00:45:49,437 --> 00:45:52,190
Gianni, you take over.
Move to the net! Quick!

443
00:45:52,277 --> 00:45:54,313
Raise the spirit, boys!

444
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:56,390
- Jump, jump!
- Hey!

445
00:45:57,517 --> 00:45:59,951
- Have you been waiting for long?
- A couple minutes.

446
00:46:00,037 --> 00:46:02,710
- Have you heard?
- Read it in the papers.

447
00:46:02,797 --> 00:46:04,833
- It's terrible.
- I saw it all.

448
00:46:04,917 --> 00:46:07,431
- What?
- It was so horrible.

449
00:46:07,517 --> 00:46:09,314
I was about to go back
into the house.

450
00:46:09,397 --> 00:46:13,310
He was standing by the pool.
l saw him stabbing her.

451
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:16,426
It was a man
wearing a mask.

452
00:46:17,477 --> 00:46:20,708
But... you saw him
kill her?

453
00:46:20,797 --> 00:46:24,392
Yes. I was like paralyzed.
l was frightened stiff.

454
00:46:24,477 --> 00:46:28,186
- But did you see the killer?
- Yes.

455
00:46:28,277 --> 00:46:30,711
- Did you recognize him?
- No.

456
00:46:30,797 --> 00:46:33,152
It was too dark.
And he wore a stocking over his head.

457
00:46:33,237 --> 00:46:35,751
- You think he saw you too?
- Yes.

458
00:46:35,837 --> 00:46:38,749
- He turned around to me.
- Come on, let's go.

459
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:47,630
- We should tell your dad about this.
- I'll talk to him.

460
00:46:47,717 --> 00:46:50,311
l told him I'd go study
at Paola's.

461
00:46:50,397 --> 00:46:53,195
- Would you come with me?
- Sure thing.

462
00:47:19,757 --> 00:47:22,908
- You want me to pick you up later?
- No, my house is not far from here. Bye.

463
00:47:22,997 --> 00:47:24,476
See you.

464
00:47:48,637 --> 00:47:51,231
- Which floor?
- Top floor.

465
00:49:30,077 --> 00:49:32,352
You're going away?
What's up?

466
00:49:33,277 --> 00:49:36,633
Grandma called.
She suffered a relapse.

467
00:49:36,717 --> 00:49:38,947
Again?
When will you be back?

468
00:49:39,037 --> 00:49:40,914
l don't know, Bettina.
Depends on her state.

469
00:49:40,997 --> 00:49:43,227
I'll call you as soon as I arrive
to let you know.

470
00:49:43,317 --> 00:49:47,515
- Last time you stayed for a week.
- Yes, let's hope for the best.

471
00:49:47,597 --> 00:49:50,316
l have to go now,
or I'll miss my train.

472
00:49:50,397 --> 00:49:54,754
- I'm taking the sleeping car.
- And daddy? Does he know you're leaving?

473
00:49:54,837 --> 00:49:57,635
Naturally.
He was busy with a client.

474
00:49:57,717 --> 00:50:02,029
But he promised to come
to the station to say goodbye.

475
00:50:02,117 --> 00:50:05,234
- Do you have anything to tell me?
- No.

476
00:50:14,597 --> 00:50:16,235
Have a good trip.

477
00:50:16,317 --> 00:50:19,673
- Send Grandma my love.
- Of course. Goodbye.

478
00:50:26,317 --> 00:50:36,317
The Milan-Brenner express
is now arriving at track 2.

479
00:50:36,957 --> 00:50:46,957
The express from Calabria
is running 40 minutes late.

480
00:50:46,957 --> 00:50:48,629
The express from Calabria
is running 40 minutes late.

481
00:53:13,037 --> 00:53:15,153
DEAD WOMAN
IN THE SLEEPING CAR.

482
00:53:15,237 --> 00:53:20,948
THE MANIAC
HAS KILLED AGAIN.

483
00:53:21,037 --> 00:53:22,106
CITY IN FEAR.

484
00:53:22,197 --> 00:53:24,472
PANIC SPREADS:
EVERYBODY SEES THE KILLER.

485
00:53:24,557 --> 00:53:27,788
POLICE RECEIVES NUMEROUS CALLS.
A STORM OF ANONYMOUS LETTERS.

486
00:53:27,877 --> 00:53:31,074
WILL THE KILLER STRIKE AGAIN?

487
00:53:31,157 --> 00:53:33,876
l preferred to come here
on my own free will.

488
00:53:34,397 --> 00:53:36,786
My daughter
is still in shock.

489
00:53:37,517 --> 00:53:41,226
Unfortunately, she heard it on the radio
that her mother was killed.

490
00:53:41,317 --> 00:53:42,545
Just like the others.

491
00:53:43,997 --> 00:53:46,557
- I understand.
- Thank you.

492
00:53:47,117 --> 00:53:50,632
I'm at your disposal.
What do you want to know?

493
00:53:51,317 --> 00:53:53,194
You're a lawyer.

494
00:53:54,037 --> 00:53:57,427
You know that I have to ask you
some unpleasant questions.

495
00:53:57,517 --> 00:53:59,587
Naturally, inspector.

496
00:53:59,677 --> 00:54:02,350
Please treat me
like everybody else.

497
00:54:02,437 --> 00:54:05,076
There'll be fewer misunderstandings
if we're frank.

498
00:54:05,157 --> 00:54:07,352
Your first question
might be:

499
00:54:07,437 --> 00:54:10,747
"Mr. Santangeli,
did you get on that train?"

500
00:54:10,837 --> 00:54:12,589
Indeed, that's it.

501
00:54:12,677 --> 00:54:14,986
l didn't get on.

502
00:54:15,077 --> 00:54:17,955
l just saw her
at the very last moment.

503
00:54:18,637 --> 00:54:20,593
Franca was standing
by the window.

504
00:54:20,677 --> 00:54:23,555
l barely managed
to reach for her hand...

505
00:54:23,637 --> 00:54:26,231
... and to wish her
a good trip.

506
00:54:27,917 --> 00:54:31,876
Did you see anybody you know
at the station?

507
00:54:32,877 --> 00:54:35,186
But who could tell?

508
00:54:35,277 --> 00:54:39,065
If someone doesn't intend to find an alibi,
he won't pay attention.

509
00:54:39,157 --> 00:54:40,306
No?

510
00:54:40,397 --> 00:54:42,957
Besides,
I don't have a motive.

511
00:54:43,037 --> 00:54:46,313
There's no life insurance,
no inheritance...

512
00:54:46,397 --> 00:54:49,548
And I don't even
use a razor to shave.

513
00:54:49,637 --> 00:54:52,105
But you did forget
an important motive:

514
00:54:52,197 --> 00:54:55,189
The revenge
of a betrayed husband.

515
00:54:55,277 --> 00:54:57,791
You're an old man,
my dear inspector.

516
00:54:57,877 --> 00:55:02,348
We live in different times now.
Franca cheated on me, and I knew about it.

517
00:55:02,437 --> 00:55:05,315
And my wife knew
that I'm unfaithful, too.

518
00:55:05,397 --> 00:55:07,957
We live in a time
where married couples...

519
00:55:08,037 --> 00:55:11,507
... are looking for other couples
with newspaper ads...

520
00:55:11,597 --> 00:55:13,155
... to swap wives.

521
00:55:14,357 --> 00:55:18,509
- Do you find that cynical?
- Where were you after your wife departed?

522
00:55:18,597 --> 00:55:20,713
After the departure
of the train?

523
00:55:20,797 --> 00:55:24,153
Please treat me like everybody else.
Don't beat about the bush.

524
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:28,116
Why don't you ask me: "Where were you
when your wife was murdered?"

525
00:55:28,197 --> 00:55:29,425
Alright.

526
00:55:29,957 --> 00:55:34,428
Then I'll ask
what you wanted to be asked:

527
00:55:35,797 --> 00:55:38,994
"Where were you
when your wife was murdered?"

528
00:55:45,157 --> 00:55:47,671
You should ask that
your commissioner.

529
00:55:47,757 --> 00:55:50,954
I was killing him
at the hunt club...

530
00:55:51,037 --> 00:55:53,426
... in a bridge tournament,
of course.

531
00:55:54,717 --> 00:55:58,676
I guess we're done
with the interview, aren't we?

532
00:55:59,437 --> 00:56:01,667
That's right.
You can go.

533
00:56:14,757 --> 00:56:16,907
You want me to say it again?
I didn't call him in!

534
00:56:16,997 --> 00:56:18,988
He came
on his own accord!

535
00:56:19,077 --> 00:56:21,830
I want to be frank
with you, Capuana.

536
00:56:21,917 --> 00:56:26,149
We've known each other for a long time.
That's why I don't blame you.

537
00:56:26,237 --> 00:56:29,070
But get into your head
that the fuse is burning!

538
00:56:29,157 --> 00:56:31,591
- This could blow us to pieces!
- Damn it!

539
00:56:31,677 --> 00:56:34,430
- The lawyer wasn't at the club!
- I know what I'm doing!

540
00:56:34,517 --> 00:56:37,111
I can't explain my motives
to you!

541
00:56:37,197 --> 00:56:41,475
You better go and find out
who his new mistress is.

542
00:56:41,557 --> 00:56:43,548
And don't cause me
any more problems!

543
00:56:43,637 --> 00:56:46,709
You want me to leave so you can
pass the case on to someone else?

544
00:56:46,797 --> 00:56:48,708
Don't be ridiculous.

545
00:56:48,797 --> 00:56:52,233
You can't give up now.
I know it's a dirty story.

546
00:56:52,317 --> 00:56:54,831
You're the chief of the
criminal investigation division...

547
00:56:54,917 --> 00:56:57,511
... and you have
my utmost trust.

548
00:56:58,397 --> 00:57:01,787
Whenever I think
I found the answer...

549
00:57:01,877 --> 00:57:03,947
... there's still
something missing.

550
00:57:06,157 --> 00:57:09,786
Don't lose heart,
and continue your investigation.

551
00:57:09,877 --> 00:57:13,028
This damn maniac
must make a mistake some day.

552
00:57:13,117 --> 00:57:14,835
Maybe.

553
00:57:15,437 --> 00:57:18,827
But he hasn't made
the slightest mistake yet.

554
00:57:20,797 --> 00:57:24,676
- Without a doubt, he's very intelligent.
- Sure.

555
00:57:24,757 --> 00:57:29,990
He appointed himself the moral avenger
of the upper class.

556
00:57:30,717 --> 00:57:33,231
He knows
all their secrets...

557
00:57:33,317 --> 00:57:37,390
... all their lovers,
and where they meet.

558
00:57:37,477 --> 00:57:40,514
He must be one of them.
That's all we know.

559
00:57:40,597 --> 00:57:43,748
That's not enough, Capuana.
We have to act faster.

560
00:57:43,837 --> 00:57:48,069
We have to catch him quick
if we don't want to get fried.

561
00:58:09,997 --> 00:58:11,874
Goodbye, madam.

562
00:58:23,317 --> 00:58:24,591
No.

563
00:58:25,117 --> 00:58:27,506
Giannina,
you're not happy.

564
00:58:27,597 --> 00:58:30,065
- But you think you are.
- Ah yes...

565
00:58:30,157 --> 00:58:32,227
In fact, you're scared.

566
00:58:33,157 --> 00:58:36,991
- Scared of a man who's threatening you.
- What man?

567
00:58:40,037 --> 00:58:41,993
Your husband, Giannina.

568
00:58:42,797 --> 00:58:46,995
For your own good:
Don't drive him too far.

569
00:58:47,077 --> 00:58:49,386
Cut it out, mom.

570
00:58:50,037 --> 00:58:53,666
Your husband, Renata,
he trusted you.

571
00:58:53,757 --> 00:58:57,830
But now he's in doubt.
He's gone away, or pretends he is.

572
00:58:57,917 --> 00:59:01,910
In any case, you're alone tonight,
and without protection.

573
00:59:02,597 --> 00:59:06,033
Stay here, my dear.
Don't go home.

574
00:59:06,117 --> 00:59:08,187
You live too isolated.

575
00:59:08,277 --> 00:59:10,871
Mom, your cards
are getting on my nerves.

576
00:59:10,957 --> 00:59:13,027
l see it perfectly clear.

577
00:59:15,437 --> 00:59:17,473
Renata loves the danger,
just like me.

578
00:59:17,557 --> 00:59:21,675
After all, it's the danger
that gives an adventure its flavor.

579
01:01:43,557 --> 01:01:44,467
Hello?

580
01:01:45,957 --> 01:01:47,993
- Hi.
- Mauro!

581
01:01:48,077 --> 01:01:50,989
- Is he gone?
- Yes, he left yesterday.

582
01:01:51,077 --> 01:01:54,228
Aren't you in the mood
for a little night stroll?

583
01:01:54,317 --> 01:01:56,626
Why don't you
come over?

584
01:01:57,677 --> 01:02:00,749
I already told you I can't relax there.
Someone might see us.

585
01:02:00,837 --> 01:02:02,634
But who could possibly
see you?

586
01:02:02,717 --> 01:02:05,789
And if your husband
walks in all of a sudden?

587
01:02:06,557 --> 01:02:09,469
No, he's not the type
for surprises.

588
01:02:09,557 --> 01:02:12,435
I'm expecting you, dear.
Come on over.

589
01:02:12,517 --> 01:02:16,396
I'm dying to
make love to you.

590
01:02:16,477 --> 01:02:20,186
- Come on, don't keep me in suspense.
- I want you too.

591
01:02:20,277 --> 01:02:21,505
See you soon.

592
01:06:22,157 --> 01:06:25,308
Renata.

593
01:06:26,437 --> 01:06:28,746
Renata, it's me.
Open the door!

594
01:07:22,757 --> 01:07:29,833
Renata?

595
01:08:43,517 --> 01:08:45,473
You're leaving so early?

596
01:08:46,397 --> 01:08:48,627
I just came home.

597
01:08:53,077 --> 01:08:54,988
You've been up
all night?

598
01:08:56,757 --> 01:08:58,349
Yes...

599
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:03,956
I understand.
Another murder...

600
01:09:04,037 --> 01:09:05,914
Who is it this time?

601
01:09:08,197 --> 01:09:09,915
Here, read it.

602
01:09:18,397 --> 01:09:19,796
Oh my God!

603
01:09:20,357 --> 01:09:22,234
Renata too!

604
01:09:22,317 --> 01:09:24,194
It's horrible!

605
01:09:26,357 --> 01:09:28,587
Now there are five.

606
01:09:33,317 --> 01:09:36,912
Did you read this?
They're attacking the police.

607
01:09:37,477 --> 01:09:40,708
I read it.
And others will follow.

608
01:09:41,557 --> 01:09:44,276
Next they'll claim
we're on the side of the opposition.

609
01:09:44,357 --> 01:09:47,474
Why are they making
a political affair out of this?

610
01:09:47,557 --> 01:09:50,435
Because two of the husbands
are in politics.

611
01:09:50,517 --> 01:09:52,985
And the scandal
hurts them.

612
01:10:07,837 --> 01:10:11,113
Why won't you
just quit all this, darling?

613
01:10:11,197 --> 01:10:15,031
My father offered you
a good position in his firm.

614
01:10:15,717 --> 01:10:17,594
Let them go to hell.

615
01:10:18,237 --> 01:10:22,549
- Why don't you accept his offer?
- You know that's not for me.

616
01:10:23,957 --> 01:10:25,276
I'm a cop.

617
01:10:25,357 --> 01:10:28,474
What would I do
among refrigerators?

618
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:30,070
Yes...

619
01:10:31,397 --> 01:10:36,312
When I was transferred here some years ago,
I thought I had found some peace.

620
01:10:38,477 --> 01:10:40,149
Remember?

621
01:10:43,477 --> 01:10:45,308
A lovely town.

622
01:10:45,397 --> 01:10:47,228
Surrounded by green.

623
01:10:47,317 --> 01:10:49,626
A low crime rate.

624
01:10:49,717 --> 01:10:52,151
Only a few
small-time crooks.

625
01:10:54,397 --> 01:10:59,107
And then suddenly, within two months:
The apocalypse.

626
01:11:05,077 --> 01:11:07,227
Hello? Capuana speaking.

627
01:11:09,117 --> 01:11:10,516
What?

628
01:11:12,797 --> 01:11:14,992
And the address, sergeant?

629
01:11:17,557 --> 01:11:21,311
- Okay, I'll come right away.
- What happened?

630
01:11:21,397 --> 01:11:24,070
The maniac called us.

631
01:11:26,837 --> 01:11:28,714
Maybe we got him.

632
01:11:58,557 --> 01:12:00,070
Open up!

633
01:12:01,237 --> 01:12:03,228
In the name of the law!

634
01:12:06,637 --> 01:12:09,151
In the name of the law,
open up!

635
01:12:10,677 --> 01:12:13,874
- Don't shoot! I'm unarmed.
- Inside!

636
01:12:27,597 --> 01:12:29,394
Why did you call us?

637
01:12:30,797 --> 01:12:32,389
Why?

638
01:12:33,197 --> 01:12:35,552
I'm tired of killing.

639
01:12:38,717 --> 01:12:41,754
You see?
This is my work!

640
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:46,150
All these whores!

641
01:12:50,637 --> 01:12:52,355
Wanna know why I did it?

642
01:12:53,077 --> 01:12:56,149
In the presence of a magistrate,
at the station.

643
01:13:20,277 --> 01:13:21,915
But of course!

644
01:13:21,997 --> 01:13:24,557
I'm the man
you were looking for.

645
01:13:27,717 --> 01:13:31,471
Tell me the truth:
l gave you a hard fight.

646
01:13:33,237 --> 01:13:37,389
If I hadn't turned myself in,
you would have never caught me.

647
01:13:37,477 --> 01:13:39,945
l have a diabolic mind.

648
01:13:42,957 --> 01:13:46,552
Do you know
how I chose my victims?

649
01:13:48,197 --> 01:13:51,428
- Take him away.
- Don't give yourself credit.

650
01:13:54,477 --> 01:13:57,389
You never would have
found me on your own!

651
01:14:02,597 --> 01:14:05,157
He's a publicity seeker.

652
01:14:05,237 --> 01:14:09,230
Maybe it appears so.
But I set the whole thing up.

653
01:14:09,317 --> 01:14:11,547
And I hope
it works out.

654
01:14:12,397 --> 01:14:17,755
I chose someone who is
the exact opposite of the killer.

655
01:14:17,837 --> 01:14:22,353
Hoping the real one will fall for it.
Isn't that right?

656
01:14:23,317 --> 01:14:27,515
Right. If we credit
the murders to a half-wit...

657
01:14:27,597 --> 01:14:31,829
... the killer feels insulted,
and will come out of his hiding.

658
01:14:31,917 --> 01:14:35,068
Yes, this is an
interesting experiment.

659
01:14:35,157 --> 01:14:38,467
- But the magistrate...?
- It will take him a few days...

660
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:41,788
... to discover that he can only
charge the man with misrepresentation.

661
01:14:41,877 --> 01:14:44,675
Meanwhile I hope that
the culprit gives himself away.

662
01:14:44,757 --> 01:14:47,430
Alright, Capuana.
I hope so too.

663
01:14:47,517 --> 01:14:51,271
I just want you
to be very careful.

664
01:14:51,357 --> 01:14:53,552
- Because of the killer?
- No, because of the press.

665
01:14:53,637 --> 01:14:57,186
They're waiting downstairs
for the usual press conference.

666
01:14:57,277 --> 01:15:00,872
- Good luck in the lion's den.
- Yeah, yeah...

667
01:15:00,957 --> 01:15:03,187
But this time
it'll be different.

668
01:15:04,197 --> 01:15:06,347
- Where is the monster now?
- With the magistrate.

669
01:15:06,437 --> 01:15:07,631
What's his name?

670
01:15:07,717 --> 01:15:10,754
It's all on the photos
we gave you.

671
01:15:10,837 --> 01:15:14,546
- What did he say when he was arrested?
- That he's tired of killing.

672
01:15:14,637 --> 01:15:16,832
The he boasted
with his diabolical mind.

673
01:15:16,917 --> 01:15:19,033
Are you sure
he's the culprit?

674
01:15:19,117 --> 01:15:22,792
This is what we found in his house:
A pair of gloves...

675
01:15:22,877 --> 01:15:25,630
... a hat, a knife
and a black mask.

676
01:15:25,717 --> 01:15:27,435
You have
any other proof?

677
01:15:27,517 --> 01:15:32,033
Of course we also recapitulated
his life during the last few months.

678
01:15:32,117 --> 01:15:34,472
But the preliminary arrest
can only be prolonged for two days.

679
01:15:34,557 --> 01:15:37,310
I want to make one thing clear:
This was not an arrest...

680
01:15:37,397 --> 01:15:39,672
... and no arrest warrant
has been issued.

681
01:15:39,757 --> 01:15:42,396
- Meaning what?
- As of now, he's only a witness.

682
01:15:42,477 --> 01:15:45,355
He turned himself in.

683
01:15:46,477 --> 01:15:47,990
What's your opinion?

684
01:15:48,077 --> 01:15:51,626
I'm not the magistrate.
He has to make the decisions.

685
01:15:52,197 --> 01:15:54,233
That would be all,
gentlemen.

686
01:15:54,317 --> 01:15:55,909
Thank you.

687
01:15:55,997 --> 01:15:57,908
Be seeing you soon.

688
01:15:58,477 --> 01:16:01,037
There's something
shady about this.

689
01:16:09,037 --> 01:16:10,390
THE MANIAC WAS CAPTURED!

690
01:16:10,477 --> 01:16:12,468
THE POLICE STORMS
A HOUSE IN THE OUTSKIRTS.

691
01:16:12,557 --> 01:16:14,513
FINDS A KNIFE, GLOVES
AND THE KILLER'S MASK.

692
01:16:14,597 --> 01:16:15,746
THE MAN CONFESSED.

693
01:16:19,437 --> 01:16:20,233
Capuana.

694
01:16:20,317 --> 01:16:23,627
I am the man you think
you have captured.

695
01:16:23,717 --> 01:16:27,312
- Who?
- Don't be any stupider than you are.

696
01:16:28,477 --> 01:16:31,310
- Excuse me, I don't understand.
- Oh, really?

697
01:16:31,397 --> 01:16:34,309
- Who are you?
- You understand very well.

698
01:16:34,397 --> 01:16:36,194
I'm sorry, but...

699
01:16:36,837 --> 01:16:39,192
... I can't give you
my name.

700
01:16:39,277 --> 01:16:41,552
I'm the one
you call the "maniac"...

701
01:16:41,637 --> 01:16:43,912
... instead of the
"moral avenger".

702
01:16:43,997 --> 01:16:47,307
The man you arrested
is just a pathetic moron.

703
01:16:47,397 --> 01:16:50,195
If you know that and conceal it,
you're a fraud.

704
01:16:50,277 --> 01:16:52,507
If you don't know that,
you're even stupider than him.

705
01:16:52,597 --> 01:16:55,395
In any case,
you're totally incapable.

706
01:16:55,477 --> 01:16:57,468
Why should I believe you?

707
01:16:57,557 --> 01:17:00,867
The fact that you're calling me
proves that you're the idiot.

708
01:17:00,957 --> 01:17:03,676
You're the one
who's irrational, inspector.

709
01:17:03,757 --> 01:17:06,829
All you found in this imbecile's house
are some pornographic photos...

710
01:17:06,917 --> 01:17:09,112
... and some clippings
from sex magazines.

711
01:17:09,197 --> 01:17:11,188
l will make you look
like an ass.

712
01:17:11,277 --> 01:17:13,916
You made
a big mistake, Capuana.

713
01:17:13,997 --> 01:17:17,307
And now you'll pay for it,
very dearly.

714
01:17:17,397 --> 01:17:20,389
What mistake?
What mistake?

715
01:17:20,477 --> 01:17:22,274
- You don't understand.
- No.

716
01:17:22,357 --> 01:17:24,746
- Enlighten me.
- Stop joking around.

717
01:17:24,837 --> 01:17:27,067
- You got two minutes.
- You underestimated me.

718
01:17:27,157 --> 01:17:28,510
That was a mistake.

719
01:17:28,597 --> 01:17:32,476
While you're playing with that poor fool,
I will kill again.

720
01:17:32,557 --> 01:17:36,152
I will strike again to make a fool out of you,
the commissioner and the magistrate.

721
01:17:36,237 --> 01:17:39,274
That'll be the end of your career.
But don't hang up.

722
01:17:39,357 --> 01:17:44,067
I have to tell you something important:
I will kill your wife, this very day.

723
01:17:44,157 --> 01:17:46,307
Hey, now you're
speechless.

724
01:17:46,397 --> 01:17:49,673
You don't believe me, huh?
Yes, I will kill your wife.

725
01:17:49,757 --> 01:17:52,146
You got that right:
Your own wife!

726
01:17:54,237 --> 01:17:57,627
Listen,
stop wasting my time.

727
01:17:57,717 --> 01:18:01,312
The maniac only kills
unfaithful women, whores.

728
01:18:01,397 --> 01:18:02,830
Exactly, whores.

729
01:18:02,917 --> 01:18:05,715
You must be the only one in town
who doesn't know your wife deceives you.

730
01:18:05,797 --> 01:18:08,550
I have photos to prove it.
Just like the others.

731
01:18:08,637 --> 01:18:11,868
You didn't expect this, huh?
You'll be disgraced.

732
01:18:11,957 --> 01:18:14,835
You'll have to leave town,
a cuckold and a widower.

733
01:18:14,917 --> 01:18:19,832
And you can't prevent it, Capuana,
because you have no idea where they meet.

734
01:18:19,917 --> 01:18:22,226
Now you're
not laughing anymore, huh?

735
01:18:44,637 --> 01:18:48,073
- Yes, inspector?
- I don't wish to speak to anybody.

736
01:18:48,957 --> 01:18:52,347
- To nobody. Got it?
- Alright, inspector.

737
01:19:28,117 --> 01:19:32,429
All you found in this imbecile's house
are some pornographic photos...

738
01:19:32,517 --> 01:19:34,712
... and some clippings
from sex magazines.

739
01:19:34,797 --> 01:19:37,106
I will make you look
like an ass.

740
01:19:37,197 --> 01:19:39,870
You made
a big mistake, Capuana.

741
01:19:46,997 --> 01:19:49,716
You must be the only one in town
who doesn't know your wife deceives you.

742
01:19:49,797 --> 01:19:52,550
I have photos to prove it.
Just like the others.

743
01:19:52,637 --> 01:19:55,947
You didn't expect this, huh?
You'll be disgraced.

744
01:20:07,677 --> 01:20:11,067
- The Capuana residence. Who's there?
- It's me, Teresa. Is my wife home?

745
01:20:11,157 --> 01:20:14,786
She went out.
She wanted to go to the hairdresser.

746
01:20:14,877 --> 01:20:17,949
- Is there something else I can do for you?
- No, thank you.

747
01:20:24,837 --> 01:20:27,795
You'll have to leave town,
a cuckold and a widower.

748
01:20:27,877 --> 01:20:32,792
And you can't prevent it, Capuana,
because you have no idea where they meet.

749
01:20:32,877 --> 01:20:34,913
Now you're
not laughing anymore, huh?

750
01:20:43,197 --> 01:20:45,074
... clippings
from sex magazines.

751
01:20:45,157 --> 01:20:47,273
I will make you look
like an ass.

752
01:20:47,357 --> 01:20:50,155
You made
a big mistake, Capuana.

753
01:20:50,237 --> 01:20:53,354
And now you'll pay for it,
very dearly.

754
01:21:00,997 --> 01:21:03,636
- Yes, please?
- Capuana here. Is my wife around?

755
01:21:03,717 --> 01:21:06,072
- No, inspector.
- But she wanted to come?

756
01:21:06,157 --> 01:21:09,149
- Yes, but she hasn't arrived yet.
- But she has an appointment?

757
01:21:09,237 --> 01:21:11,910
Yes, she does.
You want me to check the time?

758
01:21:11,997 --> 01:21:14,272
- No, thanks.
- I'm sure she'll be here in time.

759
01:21:14,357 --> 01:21:16,075
- Tell her to call me.
- Okay, inspector.

760
01:21:16,157 --> 01:21:19,194
No problem.
She'll call you once she's here.

761
01:21:21,117 --> 01:21:23,585
Yes, like this...
that's very sensual.

762
01:21:23,677 --> 01:21:27,716
- When is Signora Capuana expected to arrive?
- At 5 p.m.

763
01:21:27,797 --> 01:21:30,357
But she's always late.

764
01:21:30,437 --> 01:21:32,712
- I'm sure she won't be here before 7 p.m.
- Okay.

765
01:21:32,797 --> 01:21:36,710
She comes to get her hair done...
"afterwards".

766
01:21:39,557 --> 01:21:42,310
- Madam, I have magic hands, don't l?
- That's true.

767
01:21:42,397 --> 01:21:44,228
You should see me
with the boys...

768
01:21:44,317 --> 01:21:46,114
... who doesn't know
your wife deceives you.

769
01:21:46,197 --> 01:21:48,950
I have photos to prove it.
Just like the others.

770
01:21:49,037 --> 01:21:52,268
You didn't expect this, huh?
You'll be disgraced.

771
01:21:52,357 --> 01:21:55,315
You'll have to leave town,
a cuckold and a widower.

772
01:21:55,397 --> 01:22:00,232
And you can't prevent it, Capuana,
because you have no idea where they meet.

773
01:22:00,317 --> 01:22:02,547
Now you're
not laughing anymore, huh?

774
01:22:09,517 --> 01:22:12,077
You'll be disgraced.
You'll have to leave town...

775
01:22:12,157 --> 01:22:13,715
... a cuckold
and a widower.

776
01:22:13,797 --> 01:22:18,746
And you can't prevent it, Capuana,
because you have no idea where they meet.

777
01:22:18,837 --> 01:22:21,067
Now you're
not laughing anymore, huh?

778
01:22:42,517 --> 01:22:44,906
You'll be disgraced.
You'll have to leave town...

779
01:22:44,997 --> 01:22:46,669
... a cuckold
and a widower.

780
01:22:46,757 --> 01:22:51,706
And you can't prevent it, Capuana,
because you have no idea where they meet.

781
01:22:51,797 --> 01:22:54,186
Now you're
not laughing anymore, huh?

782
01:25:11,717 --> 01:25:13,753
DEADLY LOVE STORY.
HIM AND HER ON THE RUN.

783
01:25:13,837 --> 01:25:16,749
THE FASCINATING BLONDE FOREIGNER
HAS AN ITALIAN PASSPORT.

784
01:25:16,837 --> 01:25:17,952
HUSBAND NOTIFIED.

785
01:25:18,037 --> 01:25:20,346
THE LOVER WAS A YOUNG
FRENCH INDUSTRIALIST.

786
01:25:20,437 --> 01:25:22,029
HE RECOGNIZED HER!

787
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:26,269
THE TWO YOUNG VICTIMS OF YESTERDAY'S
CAR CRASH WERE A COUPLE.

788
01:25:26,357 --> 01:25:29,906
THE ITALIAN HUSBAND
IDENTIFIED THE YOUNG DEAD WOMAN.

789
01:25:29,997 --> 01:25:33,956
THE ITALIAN HUSBAND
IDENTIFIED THE YOUNG DEAD WOMAN...

790
01:25:34,037 --> 01:25:37,586
... WHO DIED YESTERDAY
IN A CAR CRASH NEAR MONACO.

791
01:27:06,197 --> 01:27:08,711
Hello? What?

792
01:27:08,797 --> 01:27:10,116
Ah, good evening!

793
01:27:10,197 --> 01:27:12,995
Your nephew went away
this afternoon.

794
01:27:13,077 --> 01:27:15,386
Pardon?
I think to the beach house.

795
01:27:15,477 --> 01:27:18,071
Hello?

796
01:27:18,517 --> 01:27:20,906
Hello? Hello?

797
01:27:48,277 --> 01:27:50,791
- Back so soon?
- I forgot some paperwork.

798
01:27:50,877 --> 01:27:53,152
- Where are you going?
- To the beach.

799
01:27:53,237 --> 01:27:54,636
Alone?

800
01:27:55,317 --> 01:27:57,273
- Hello uncle.
- Roberto is taking me...

801
01:27:57,357 --> 01:27:59,552
<i>- ... if you don't mind.
- Of course not.</i>

802
01:27:59,637 --> 01:28:01,628
Providing he's not racing,
as usual.

803
01:28:01,717 --> 01:28:04,515
Don't worry.
When he's with me, he doesn't race.

804
01:28:04,597 --> 01:28:07,350
- Well then... see you later.
- Bye.

805
01:28:08,477 --> 01:28:10,035
Bye.

806
01:29:26,957 --> 01:29:28,310
Hello?

807
01:29:28,917 --> 01:29:31,067
- Who's there?
- Her husband knows everything.

808
01:29:31,157 --> 01:29:33,625
Get out of there,
don't be a fool.

809
01:29:33,717 --> 01:29:36,550
Her husband knows everything...
But who are you?

810
01:29:36,637 --> 01:29:38,389
Hello? Hello?

811
01:33:53,957 --> 01:33:55,754
Freeze, Casali!

812
01:34:08,717 --> 01:34:11,436
Maybe we're dealing
with a sexual maniac.

813
01:34:14,757 --> 01:34:17,351
... and then
the mortal cut.

814
01:35:46,117 --> 01:35:47,630
Nicosia...

815
01:35:48,917 --> 01:35:50,589
... Capuana here.

816
01:35:55,357 --> 01:35:57,587
Give me
the commissioner.
