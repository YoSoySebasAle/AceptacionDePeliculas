1
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:57,427
You should let those cats out
once in a while.

2
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,020
Outside they couldn't survive.

3
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,941
They were bred for degeneracy.

4
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:13,401
Like a whore.

5
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,949
There's harder work.

6
00:03:16,445 --> 00:03:17,571
When?

7
00:03:17,738 --> 00:03:18,910
In a week.

8
00:03:27,873 --> 00:03:31,503
Here is a film
of Colonel Saran Zim, President of Eritrea,

9
00:03:31,585 --> 00:03:34,555
<i>as he steps from the plane, bringing him
to Paris from the Middle East

10
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,304
<i>on the first leg of his tour
of the NATO countries.

11
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,812
<i>Zim was met by French foreign minister,
Pierre Croyez,

12
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,098
<i>and minister of state, Jacques Cassente.

13
00:03:43,347 --> 00:03:45,816
<i>Russian advisers attached to Zim
accompanied him

14
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:47,893
<i>even on this mission to the West.

15
00:03:48,185 --> 00:03:50,813
<i>A strong security force
surrounded the dapper colonel

16
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,482
<i>as he made his way toward the podium.

17
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,167
<i>This is the moment.

18
00:04:07,204 --> 00:04:08,626
<i>An assassins gun fires,

19
00:04:08,664 --> 00:04:10,792
<i>causing panic on the tarmac.

20
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,502
<i>As one of the special police falls,

21
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,633
<i>ministers and officials run for cover.

22
00:04:14,962 --> 00:04:18,091
<i>Another shot kills Zim's bodyguard,
Emilio Rocca.

23
00:04:18,507 --> 00:04:20,601
<i>Lights used to floodlight the area

24
00:04:20,676 --> 00:04:23,054
<i>were spun round to illuminate
a nearby hangar.

25
00:04:23,345 --> 00:04:26,224
<i>From the roof, bursts of fire
from an automatic rifle.

26
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:29,151
<i>Police returning fire,
run to surround the hangar,

27
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,813
<i>leaving Zim and his entourage
mooing for coven.

28
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:34,448
<i>Two more police died in the ensuing battle.

29
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:01,051
<i>While police
were distracted by the rooftop assassin,

30
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:03,139
<i>another shot from the darkness
of the airport

31
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,221
<i>and Salan Zim fails dead.

32
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:06,897
<i>Here is an action replay of the moment,

33
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,729
<i>as Colonel Satan Zim of Eritrea

34
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,310
<i>meets death from an unknown assassin.

35
00:05:11,143 --> 00:05:13,271
<i>Meantime, French police
shot and mortally wounded

36
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:16,358
<i>the young Arab whose fire from the roof
had killed four men.

37
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,234
<i>He carried papers identifying him

38
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:21,241
<i>as Yusef Belabar, a student from Eritrea,

39
00:05:21,278 --> 00:05:24,407
<i>a member of the extreme
left-wing Soldiers of Revolution group.

40
00:05:24,698 --> 00:05:25,915
<i>Already in Eritrea,

41
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,045
<i>government forces have raided
the of fices of 17 left-wing...

42
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:31,251
Do you ever count the dead, Cross?

43
00:05:31,747 --> 00:05:33,374
You're beautiful, Jean,

44
00:05:33,707 --> 00:05:36,085
but sometimes you have
the bad breath of priests.

45
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:38,341
- Did you see the opposition?
- I saw him.

46
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,923
What's Zharkov doing on the plane?

47
00:05:41,423 --> 00:05:43,096
How many times
you been out with me?

48
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,345
Six, maybe seven.

49
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,229
You're good, Jean.
Better than good.

50
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,106
You're smart, you understand.

51
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:51,562
But that still leaves you
a contract button man,

52
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:55,609
necessary only because the CIA
doesn't hold with doing its own killing.

53
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,065
Washington.

54
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,746
Does the boy go into your report?

55
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:05,156
He's the headliner.

56
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,116
Why did he want to kill Zim?

57
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:08,583
Nosy, aren't you?

58
00:06:08,617 --> 00:06:09,960
Good evening, Madame.

59
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,668
<i>Bonsoir, monsieur.

60
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,627
<i>Monsieur.

61
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:17,794
Boy saw Zim as a fascist, a brutal pig,

62
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,712
a tool of American imperialism.

63
00:06:20,462 --> 00:06:22,464
He wanted a crack at him.
I bought him a ticket.

64
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,183
If he had got him?

65
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,352
<i>Mademoiselle, s'il vous plait.

66
00:06:27,052 --> 00:06:29,146
You'd have picked up
your money with no sweat.

67
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:30,438
Merci.

68
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:36,396
If Zim was America's man, why kill him?

69
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,821
For your education?

70
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,452
Zim dead at the hands of the left

71
00:06:43,485 --> 00:06:46,079
serves his government and mine
better than Zim alive.

72
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,790
But it's not his death that's important.

73
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,492
It's who appeared to have
killed him that counts.

74
00:06:52,536 --> 00:06:54,504
<i>One more thing for your education.

75
00:06:54,538 --> 00:06:57,007
<i>The more a man tells you,
the more dangerous you become to him.

76
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,210
<i>And the more dangerous you become,

77
00:06:59,376 --> 00:07:01,344
<i>the shorter the options on your future.

78
00:07:07,217 --> 00:07:09,265
- Your sister still work at Air France?
- Uh-huh.

79
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,517
Is she meeting you?

80
00:07:10,554 --> 00:07:11,976
She doesn't know I'm here.

81
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,642
Sarah's picking me up in a car.
Can I give you a lift?

82
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,730
I thought the rules said
we were strangers from here on in.

83
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:20,321
They bend.

84
00:07:20,814 --> 00:07:22,862
No, thanks. Say hello to Sarah for me.

85
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,159
I will.

86
00:07:59,728 --> 00:08:01,605
- He still in there?
- Upstairs bedroom.

87
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:02,815
See you fellas in the morning, eh?

88
00:08:02,898 --> 00:08:03,899
Right.

89
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:10,535
The President Harding Suite.

90
00:08:10,572 --> 00:08:13,451
Some I know like lo touch
both walls of a room.

91
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:17,422
They need security. Would you believe it?

92
00:08:22,751 --> 00:08:25,755
Harding used to play cards up here
with his oil friends.

93
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,967
I was a bellboy then. I was no more than 10.

94
00:08:29,174 --> 00:08:31,268
People used to tip big in those days.

95
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:33,220
Thank you, sir. Oh, here, kitty.

96
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,764
Leave the cat.

97
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,269
Yes, sir.

98
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,529
You, uh, need anything, sir?

99
00:08:42,771 --> 00:08:44,614
Action, you know?

100
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,693
A little black to change your luck?

101
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,525
You frighten a guy.

102
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:24,230
I woke up and for a moment
I thought you were still away,

103
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,404
and I'd just dreamed you were back.

104
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,197
You smell of me.

105
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,716
Remember the story of Madagascar Ho?

106
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:47,715
A little man who dreamed of Madagascar.

107
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,889
Never got further than the 3rd Avenue El.

108
00:09:54,551 --> 00:09:56,679
We should have run in 1945.

109
00:09:59,681 --> 00:10:00,853
Where?

110
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,232
Today's Saturday, isn't it?

111
00:10:43,308 --> 00:10:45,106
Yes, all day.

112
00:10:46,353 --> 00:10:49,197
Heck still go down to the cottage
on weekends?

113
00:10:49,648 --> 00:10:53,073
Yeah. He and Helen left
Tuesday for a couple of weeks.

114
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,246
They asked us down.

115
00:10:57,447 --> 00:10:58,869
Their boy go, too?

116
00:11:00,617 --> 00:11:04,087
No. He's at UCLA now.
He only comes home once or twice a year.

117
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,879
He sees Heck as being in the enemy camp.

118
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:10,044
He's right.

119
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,923
You're gonna tell him?

120
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,429
I'm gonna tell him today.

121
00:11:19,928 --> 00:11:21,601
McLeod's not gonna have a good morning.

122
00:11:21,805 --> 00:11:22,977
He'll handle it.

123
00:11:23,056 --> 00:11:25,775
He'll feed it into his computer
for the proper reaction.

124
00:11:26,351 --> 00:11:30,231
Maybe we should just go,
you know, like the Arabs, and not...

125
00:11:31,356 --> 00:11:32,778
And not tell McLeod.

126
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,370
You start to run,
everyone wants to know why.

127
00:11:37,404 --> 00:11:39,623
Then they make up the answers
to their own questions.

128
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,869
I thought I just saw someone
in Helen's kitchen.

129
00:11:43,827 --> 00:11:44,874
You did.

130
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,291
Us?

131
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:53,428
You know the Agency.
They like to keep an eye on things.

132
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,666
Mr. McLeod would like to see you.

133
00:12:25,994 --> 00:12:28,372
Sorry. Afraid I must insist.

134
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:48,351
With what were you going to insist,
Mr. Filchock?

135
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,528
We named you well.

136
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,737
You're a perfect Scorpio.

137
00:12:56,984 --> 00:13:00,534
You have a penchant
for intrigue and violence.

138
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:05,034
Don't limit your action. Read palms.

139
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,045
Maybe my character will improve.

140
00:13:09,037 --> 00:13:13,042
Orion boasted he would kill
all the animals on the earth.

141
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,675
So the goddesses Diana and Latona

142
00:13:16,878 --> 00:13:20,052
created the scorpion to slay the hunter.

143
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,807
You and McLeod make two nice goddesses.

144
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:30,233
Tell Diana I've got my day planned.

145
00:13:34,354 --> 00:13:35,947
Cross came back.

146
00:13:38,358 --> 00:13:40,360
You were to kill him in Paris.

147
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,215
Remember everything?

148
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,008
Just in case.

149
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:00,638
I remember.

150
00:16:07,382 --> 00:16:09,885
I can't see him. He's got out and run.

151
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,715
Oh, Jesus!

152
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:45,988
Joy.

153
00:17:46,606 --> 00:17:49,359
Joy, baby. A C-note?

154
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:53,163
My mother's dead, man,
so who do I have to kill?

155
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,885
You know the Lord's Prayer?

156
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,263
McLeod?

157
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,266
McLeod, McLeod.

158
00:18:56,843 --> 00:18:58,345
How bad does he want me?

159
00:18:58,803 --> 00:19:00,055
All the way.

160
00:19:00,221 --> 00:19:01,473
He say why?

161
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,022
Where's your partner?

162
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,062
He's hurt. He's back in the car.

163
00:19:07,103 --> 00:19:08,480
Go! a radio in it?

164
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,902
You ever been in the field?

165
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:19,412
But you've seen the survival kit.
You know what this is?

166
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:23,579
It's the happy pill.
It's the "kiss the mortgage goodbye“ pill.

167
00:19:30,168 --> 00:19:34,298
So long, brother of mine.
You've got 30 seconds to live.

168
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,177
Miami, single.

169
00:19:38,593 --> 00:19:40,641
You got nothing smaller, mister?

170
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:42,852
What's the matter? Business slow?

171
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:55,077
New York, single. What time does it leave?

172
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:56,869
2120.

173
00:19:57,612 --> 00:19:58,989
You're sure?

174
00:19:59,572 --> 00:20:01,870
What? Are you here for laughs? I'm sure.

175
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:05,787
Taxi.

176
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,755
Just drive on ahead.

177
00:20:18,466 --> 00:20:19,638
Thanks.

178
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,147
<i>- Anne.
Who is it?

179
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:29,273
<i>- C'est moi?
- Jean!

180
00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:32,697
Right.

181
00:20:32,897 --> 00:20:34,399
Hello, Cross.

182
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:36,655
Hello, Pick.

183
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,572
I need help.

184
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,291
I need the dust Close the door.

185
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,086
What are you doing in Washington?

186
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,463
Missing my sister.

187
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,626
Sure.

188
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:59,512
She's lecturing.
She'll be back soon. Had breakfast?

189
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:00,721
Mm-hmm.

190
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,848
Here, give me those.

191
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:09,693
White for your sister
and red for your love. Hungry?

192
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:11,395
Coffee only.

193
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:14,189
Where are you living now?

194
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,116
Paris.

195
00:21:17,692 --> 00:21:19,319
Do you still have the same apartment?

196
00:21:20,236 --> 00:21:21,328
Yes.

197
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,712
You bastard!

198
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,477
You're one hell of a letter writer.

199
00:21:44,552 --> 00:21:47,556
One postcard from Damascus in six months.

200
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:49,558
He brought you some flowers.

201
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,853
The red ones are for you.
Oh, hell! The coffee!

202
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:56,857
I know a place that does a good breakfast.

203
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,742
Hello. May I speak to Mitch, please?

204
00:22:03,988 --> 00:22:05,956
There's no Mitch here.
What number are you calling?

205
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:10,625
393-4098.

206
00:22:11,579 --> 00:22:13,422
I'm sorry. You have the wrong number.

207
00:22:14,415 --> 00:22:15,416
Three...

208
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:21,006
And how long are you here for this time?

209
00:22:21,464 --> 00:22:22,807
Well, I...

210
00:22:23,007 --> 00:22:27,228
No, don't tell me. It's too pretty
a day. I don't want it to rain.

211
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,658
<i>Hello. Hello, Cross.

212
00:22:40,775 --> 00:22:43,198
No time, Sarah. McLeod wants me dead.

213
00:22:44,445 --> 00:22:47,540
<i>H! have to go deep,
so you won't hear from me for a while.

214
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,618
<i>Stay close. Contact no one.

215
00:22:50,451 --> 00:22:54,797
When the time comes,
Pick'll get in touch. I love you, Sarah.

216
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,463
<i>Keep that mountain in mind.

217
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:01,050
I love you, Cross.

218
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:14,352
First of all' I'm gonna take you
to the Washington Monument and...

219
00:23:15,101 --> 00:23:16,273
Excuse me, sir.

220
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,483
Of course.

221
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,318
Wait for me outside.

222
00:23:20,189 --> 00:23:23,443
McLeod wants to see you, sir.
Don't give me any trouble, please.

223
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:28,327
No trouble. Just let me get my bag.

224
00:23:28,364 --> 00:23:30,082
I'll get it for you, sir. Which one?

225
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:31,284
There.

226
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:34,921
Where the hell are you going
with that bag? Give me that bag!

227
00:23:48,217 --> 00:23:49,469
Good morning, sir.

228
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,224
<i>Ail you had to do
was keep your heads dawn.

229
00:24:28,591 --> 00:24:31,561
<i>And Cross would have walked
right into this office to file his report.

230
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,439
<i>And what d'you do?
You crawl halfway up his ass!

231
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,025
<i>Who did you think you were following,
some second-hand car dealer

232
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,310
<i>from Oshkosh, Wisconsin?

233
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,066
Cross is the best.

234
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,238
Now he's running free

235
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:45,071
and all I've got
is one operative with a cut head,

236
00:24:45,149 --> 00:24:48,904
<i>another being held by the local police
as a drug-addict homosexual,

237
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,739
and one beat-up car.

238
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,626
Mr. McLeod, you said to check him
in and keep an eye on him and...

239
00:24:56,911 --> 00:24:59,790
Oh, get out.

240
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,379
How is Harris?

241
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,260
Still in a state of shock.

242
00:25:04,293 --> 00:25:06,341
Cross forced a harmless hay fever pill

243
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:09,425
into his mouth' told him it was cyanide
from an SD kit.

244
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:12,595
Beautiful!
- Shall I bail the dummy out?

245
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,350
No, let him sweat.

246
00:25:16,931 --> 00:25:19,309
I can't let this get upstairs, Fil.

247
00:25:20,601 --> 00:25:23,445
If we throw this one,
the chief'll come down hard.

248
00:25:23,646 --> 00:25:25,444
We have to get Cross.

249
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:28,360
I've got every man on it,
but without FBI or locals,

250
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,241
we're carrying a handicap.

251
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:33,452
The Bureau would love
to get their hands on this. Mmm-mmm.

252
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,458
No, no one outside the Agency.

253
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:39,337
Blanket everything.
Every exit. Operate every contact.

254
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,957
I'll put it nationwide. We'll box him in.

255
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:57,639
<i>Flight for Toronto
is 7:15, due in 8:10.

256
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:00,691
<i>Then the big one, Toronto-Vienna.

257
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:04,734
<i>It leaves at 8:25 and it's
a fast-track ab' the way.

258
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:08,487
You'll be there at 5:30 in the morning,
1:30 in the afternoon their time.

259
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:12,954
Put it in your shoe, Jack!
Can't you read the sign? Maintenance!

260
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,037
Too much!

261
00:26:17,116 --> 00:26:19,665
I made the connections
as fast as I could, like you said.

262
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:22,839
There are no through bookings,
nothing traceable.

263
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,591
In Pittsburgh your tickets will be
waiting for you at the National desk,

264
00:26:25,666 --> 00:26:27,668
under the name Father Henderson.

265
00:26:28,252 --> 00:26:32,382
At Chicago go to the United desk.
There you're Father Kitts.

266
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:38,267
At Toronto it's Air Canada,
under the name Father Wieland.

267
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:40,769
And your English is not so good!

268
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,102
Let's get moving.

269
00:26:47,021 --> 00:26:49,194
Tell me, how do you like my place?

270
00:26:49,273 --> 00:26:50,616
Very much.

271
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:54,871
I've 75 students of English Literature,

272
00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:59,580
I teach nine classes a week,
and our new term starts next week.

273
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:01,790
And I love you.

274
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,706
How do you like Paris?

275
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:07,171
Better watch out, Jean.

276
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:10,713
You make one promise
and I'll hold you to it.

277
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:16,051
Okay, Father.

278
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,307
Goodbye, my son. Bless you.

279
00:27:32,024 --> 00:27:34,072
Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye!

280
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:46,706
Hello.

281
00:27:49,625 --> 00:27:51,627
What are we buying for each other?

282
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,598
I'll pay my dues.

283
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,559
How much did my sister tell you?

284
00:27:59,093 --> 00:28:01,095
She said there'd be pain.

285
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,275
Did she talk about Algeria?

286
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:13,116
She said that you were
a lieutenant in the paratroopers.

287
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:27,505
When I think of it, I'm afraid. Aren't you?

288
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,506
I picked you up, remember?

289
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:36,306
I only talked Anne into
sharing an apartment with me

290
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,850
so I'd have an excuse to be around.

291
00:28:55,149 --> 00:28:58,244
<i>We can't all miss, mister. Okay?

292
00:28:58,569 --> 00:29:00,162
Let's give it a search.

293
00:29:15,836 --> 00:29:18,510
Make a move, jockey,
and I'll splash you across the sheets.

294
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,887
It's heroin.

295
00:29:22,176 --> 00:29:24,270
You son of a bitch. Get out of bed.

296
00:29:26,138 --> 00:29:27,981
Pull it in.

297
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,141
Jean!

298
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:56,886
You've two ways to walk, Scorpio.

299
00:29:58,629 --> 00:30:02,759
Down that corridor that's 30 years long...

300
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,055
Or with me.

301
00:30:26,073 --> 00:30:28,326
This is Washington National Airport.

302
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:32,547
The picture shows passengers
boarding this afternoons 5:15 flight,

303
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,253
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

304
00:30:41,088 --> 00:30:42,931
Would you say that was Cross?

305
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,887
Without an element of doubt.

306
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:50,641
Some airports have a television eye service.

307
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:52,020
They keep a video tape running,

308
00:30:52,099 --> 00:30:55,023
which they erase the next day.
I had a hunch.

309
00:30:55,811 --> 00:30:57,233
And it paid.

310
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,569
It should have been fairly easy

311
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,655
to trace the destination of a priest.

312
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:04,575
Normally Washington airport
wouldn't have too many priests

313
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,080
departing around 5:00 or so,

314
00:31:07,281 --> 00:31:10,376
but today was the last day
of a conference of teaching brothers.

315
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:12,374
More than 300 priests departed,

316
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:15,047
in all directions,
between 3:00 and 6:00 p.m.,

317
00:31:15,122 --> 00:31:16,669
Cross amongst them.

318
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:18,292
Brilliant.

319
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:19,506
Oh, I agree.

320
00:31:19,585 --> 00:31:20,632
He had to have help.

321
00:31:20,711 --> 00:31:22,463
No. Messenger boys.

322
00:31:23,422 --> 00:31:27,598
The plan was Cross's.
Would you agree to that, Scorpio?

323
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:29,975
Mm-hmm.

324
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:35,981
Well, our first piece of common ground.

325
00:31:38,729 --> 00:31:40,823
You boys can pack it in for the night.

326
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:49,991
You were supposed
to kill Cross at the Paris job.

327
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,666
No contract.

328
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:58,253
You took the money.

329
00:31:58,999 --> 00:32:00,376
You left the money.

330
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,847
Why?

331
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:12,684
Cross had his contract in first.

332
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,854
I don't play games when the rules are bent.

333
00:32:20,646 --> 00:32:23,195
No one bends them faster than Cross.

334
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,195
Never with me.

335
00:32:27,945 --> 00:32:31,540
I want Cross. And I want him burned.

336
00:32:32,741 --> 00:32:34,414
You know him best.

337
00:32:35,327 --> 00:32:36,579
Find him.

338
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,381
You make too many mistakes.

339
00:32:39,665 --> 00:32:40,757
Like?

340
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:43,927
You confuse what you want
with what I want.

341
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:47,423
Mister, you don't have
too much ground to dance on.

342
00:32:49,383 --> 00:32:51,135
I could drop you for the heroin

343
00:32:51,218 --> 00:32:52,720
or tag you for the Paris killing.

344
00:32:53,512 --> 00:32:55,981
Now, your government
would like more names.

345
00:32:57,808 --> 00:32:59,936
Your second mistake, McLeod.

346
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,692
Cross gave me enough information

347
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,732
on each operation we did together.

348
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:09,366
Not conclusive, but enough
to make a strange reading.

349
00:33:10,112 --> 00:33:12,410
You can't let me go into a public court.

350
00:33:15,784 --> 00:33:17,411
What do you want?

351
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:20,581
I want inside.

352
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,382
Where?

353
00:33:26,962 --> 00:33:28,179
Beirut.

354
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,638
You want Cross's job?

355
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:36,397
If you get Cross, you get his posting.

356
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:38,857
More.

357
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,692
More?

358
00:33:41,101 --> 00:33:42,853
$25,000.

359
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,818
Where's Cross?

360
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,069
More.

361
00:33:50,444 --> 00:33:52,947
You run it right to the edge, don't you?

362
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,457
What?

363
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:57,539
I want to know the reason.

364
00:33:57,701 --> 00:33:59,294
Executive order.

365
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:03,253
You don't question a directive
in the Agency, Scorpio.

366
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:07,842
I'm not in the Agency until I get Cross.

367
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:10,882
The reason?

368
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:14,761
He's a face, a double agent.

369
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:19,057
He sold to the opposition
and he has a lot more to sell.

370
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:22,902
Do you know where Cross is or don't you?

371
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:26,732
I don't. But a man named Zharkov will.

372
00:34:29,149 --> 00:34:30,651
Serge Zharkov.

373
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,246
He's Soviet intelligence
in Cairo, Cross's opposite.

374
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:36,616
You think he'll go to Zharkov?

375
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:41,254
Zharkov will go to him.
But not in the Middle East, in Europe.

376
00:34:41,787 --> 00:34:43,334
Europe is a big place.

377
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,167
I want internal replay on Serge Zharkov.

378
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:48,798
Who else have you got to send
against him but me'?

379
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,338
Where do I send you?

380
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,257
Where Zharkov and Cross have met before.

381
00:34:53,507 --> 00:34:55,225
A place they both know.

382
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,479
A place where Zharkov
could have a safe house.

383
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,515
Ready on Zharkov.

384
00:35:03,225 --> 00:35:04,772
Sergei Zharkov.

385
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:09,315
<i>Born Kiev, 1914. Educated in Leningrad.

386
00:35:09,773 --> 00:35:12,652
<i>Doctor of philosophy
and political history, and economics.

387
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,829
<i>Fought in Spain with the Thalmann Brigade.

388
00:35:16,196 --> 00:35:20,793
<i>Arrested in Moscow, 1939,
and sentenced to six years ham! labor.

389
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:25,165
<i>Rehabilitated in 1943. Assignment, Balkans.

390
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:29,503
<i>Little information
until his posting to Iraq in 1952.

391
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:33,806
<i>Speaks fluent German, Arabic,
French, English, Hebrew.

392
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:38,557
<i>Associated operatives. Karim,

393
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,305
<i>Ludmann,

394
00:35:40,929 --> 00:35:42,306
<i>Zemetkin...

395
00:35:42,389 --> 00:35:44,062
Replay operatives.

396
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:53,234
<i>Associated operatives. Karim,

397
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:55,153
<i>Ludmann,

398
00:35:55,861 --> 00:35:57,238
<i>Zemetkin...

399
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,081
Hold on Zemetkin.

400
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:05,789
Listen' when I came over,
you promised me asylum.

401
00:36:05,871 --> 00:36:07,544
We also promised you questions.

402
00:36:07,581 --> 00:36:08,628
Yes.

403
00:36:08,707 --> 00:36:12,962
And I answered all your questions.
Why am I in the airport?

404
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:19,806
You're going back to Moscow, Zemetkin.

405
00:36:20,552 --> 00:36:22,680
You gave us no more than we already knew.

406
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:25,099
You were cute and well-conditioned.

407
00:36:25,265 --> 00:36:28,018
And all that stuff
about freedom had brass edges.

408
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:32,239
You ran because you were
playing pat-a-cake with state funds.

409
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,158
Okay, we let it ride.

410
00:36:36,276 --> 00:36:38,574
But now we want
a little interest on our investment.

411
00:36:38,987 --> 00:36:40,239
Zharkov.

412
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:46,250
When Zharkov isn't in the Middle East

413
00:36:46,286 --> 00:36:49,165
and he isn't at home, where is he'?

414
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:55,509
Maybe a former picnic ground
not too east and not too west.

415
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:59,258
Somewhere the barriers are down.

416
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:04,393
I don't know such a place.
I would tell you if I knew.

417
00:37:04,638 --> 00:37:08,563
Your plane.
Aeroflot flight 379, direct to Moscow.

418
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,816
Al the other end,
you'll be well and truly met.

419
00:37:11,895 --> 00:37:14,318
<i>6481 to Ilyushin 009. Over.

420
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,150
You're murdering me.

421
00:37:16,233 --> 00:37:20,079
<i>Federal protective
service officer 7463. Over.

422
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:23,499
<i>MAN T. Ready to board
passenger Andrew Zemetkim Oven.

423
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,414
<i>Standing by. Over.

424
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:29,296
<i>MAN T. Dropping lounge
boarding platform in five seconds Oven.

425
00:37:31,331 --> 00:37:32,674
How about Vienna, huh'?

426
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,377
JEAN'S GIRLFRIEND; Vienna?

427
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,179
<i>I'm sorry.
- What about the police?

428
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:38,802
A mistake.

429
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:41,763
The man who had the room
before me forgot to pack everything.

430
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:44,307
Some mistake.

431
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:48,020
How long will you be away'? Can I come?

432
00:37:48,098 --> 00:37:50,772
Impossible. Anyway, you have to teach.

433
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,147
Is it going to be dangerous, Jean?

434
00:37:54,229 --> 00:37:56,027
No. Why should it be?

435
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:02,162
We've already contacted
our people in Vienna.

436
00:38:02,362 --> 00:38:05,491
You'll be given
every facility, total cooperation.

437
00:38:05,699 --> 00:38:07,701
And you can draw expenses.

438
00:38:10,954 --> 00:38:13,127
McLeod's depending on you, Scorpio.

439
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,343
Spain was a long time ago.

440
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:40,920
The best died there.

441
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:46,801
There's a house on the Kurrentgasse,
on the corner. Go there.

442
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:18,878
Where are we going?

443
00:40:18,957 --> 00:40:20,174
Get in.

444
00:40:29,092 --> 00:40:30,469
You don't talk very much.

445
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,387
I have nothing to say.

446
00:42:52,819 --> 00:42:55,447
I see you still have
a flair for the theater, Zharkov.

447
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:58,329
It adds color.

448
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:05,165
These drivers, your people?

449
00:43:05,248 --> 00:43:07,501
Not official. Old comrades.

450
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:11,179
I hear you are running, Cross.

451
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,348
What else do you hear?

452
00:43:13,673 --> 00:43:15,675
McLeod's ordered the wet stuff.

453
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:18,933
There's a gun out for you.

454
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:21,022
When did you know?

455
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:23,900
A week before you did.

456
00:43:24,142 --> 00:43:25,485
Who have you got in your pocket?

457
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:30,737
Actually, I buy from a Bulgarian
who works for the Chinese.

458
00:43:35,028 --> 00:43:36,405
Your place?

459
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:38,699
Yours, if you need it.

460
00:43:39,991 --> 00:43:44,462
No one knows about it,
not my company, not your company.

461
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:48,630
Just friends, a few and trustworthy.

462
00:43:49,292 --> 00:43:50,589
And the rent?

463
00:43:51,336 --> 00:43:52,963
Take it on trust.

464
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,381
Thank you.

465
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:56,846
There will come a time, Cross,

466
00:43:57,342 --> 00:44:00,266
when those who sit above me
will want you delivered.

467
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:06,774
They'll give me so much play
in the rope and then they'll pull it in.

468
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:11,816
And then?

469
00:44:13,441 --> 00:44:15,660
Moscow is nice in the spring.

470
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,743
There's a long winter' I hear.

471
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,368
How are you going to get your wife out?

472
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:25,496
I'll get her out.

473
00:44:26,454 --> 00:44:29,879
Come over. They'll get her out for you.

474
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:32,169
No, Sergei. No Moscow.

475
00:44:32,502 --> 00:44:35,551
I want out, not just a change of sides.

476
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:39,013
Sit down, Cross.

477
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,229
The offer of the hide still goes.

478
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:48,185
And when the rope begins to wind in?

479
00:44:50,103 --> 00:44:51,525
<i>I'll tell you.

480
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:54,070
And you'll know where to find me.

481
00:44:54,774 --> 00:44:56,993
In Vienna, I could find you anywhere.

482
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:03,701
Have you noticed, Cross,
that we are being replaced

483
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:08,422
by young men with bright, stupid faces,

484
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:11,041
a sense of fashion,

485
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:15,463
and a dedication to
nothing more than efficiency?

486
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:20,093
Keepers of machines, pushers of buttons,

487
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,934
hardware men with highly complex toys,

488
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:30,524
and, except for language,
not an iota of difference

489
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:33,651
between the American model
and the Soviet model.

490
00:45:56,711 --> 00:45:58,179
To dinosaurs.

491
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:18,568
Maybe you can kill Cross alone, though I
wouldn't put my little yellow basket on it,

492
00:46:18,858 --> 00:46:21,361
but you're not gonna find him alone,
not out there.

493
00:46:21,736 --> 00:46:23,613
Am I wasting my breath?

494
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:25,870
No, I was listening.

495
00:46:26,574 --> 00:46:30,204
And so far you've said
nothing that lit any candles in the dark.

496
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:34,382
You have no proof
that Cross and Zharkov are in Vienna.

497
00:46:34,499 --> 00:46:36,968
You have no one on your staff
that knows Zharkov.

498
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:40,047
But you did get around
to checking customs,

499
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:43,054
and eight priests arrived by air
in the last three days,

500
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:45,181
two from North America, Mitchell.

501
00:46:46,052 --> 00:46:48,054
It is Mitchell, isn't it'?

502
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:53,106
Well, Mitchell...
Which of the two was Cross?

503
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:58,153
The one on TWA from New York
or the one on Air Canada from Toronto?

504
00:46:59,232 --> 00:47:00,609
No way of telling.

505
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:05,785
Father Wieland was Cross,
Air Canada from Toronto.

506
00:47:06,906 --> 00:47:10,376
Yes, I know horse players that
play hunches and hot flushes.

507
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:12,412
Horse players die broke.

508
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:15,837
If Cross had flown
from Washington to New York,

509
00:47:16,249 --> 00:47:18,217
he would have caught the Pan Am flight,

510
00:47:18,626 --> 00:47:20,674
but there was no priest on that flight.

511
00:47:21,629 --> 00:47:24,724
He wouldn't have waited
seven hours for a TWA flight.

512
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:29,938
Never stand still when you run
and never run in a straight line.

513
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:33,020
That's the first thing Cross taught me.

514
00:47:33,558 --> 00:47:35,526
Cross is an organizer.

515
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:38,446
He plans down to the finest margin of error.

516
00:47:39,272 --> 00:47:42,947
You can't follow his mistakes,
so you follow his skill.

517
00:47:45,236 --> 00:47:50,584
Washington to Pittsburgh or Cleveland.
Two possibles.

518
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:53,378
Cleveland or Pittsburgh to Chicago.

519
00:47:55,705 --> 00:47:57,457
Chicago to Toronto.

520
00:47:59,125 --> 00:48:00,798
Toronto to Vienna.

521
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:03,505
Not more than 20 minutes in any one place,

522
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:06,137
and less than 12 hours in all.

523
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,552
Wieland fits.

524
00:48:28,905 --> 00:48:31,283
All the majesty of Europe.

525
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:33,209
Have you ever been to the Hermitage?

526
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:35,871
Paintings there that seize your breath.

527
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:38,002
Stop being a guide, Sergei.
What have you got for me?

528
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,333
Arrivals.

529
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:57,188
Then they know you are here. I guessed.

530
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,860
You never guess.

531
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:03,281
A defector, Zemetkin, a petty thief.
McLeod had his thumbs on him.

532
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,533
He knew about Vienna.

533
00:49:05,608 --> 00:49:07,076
And the hide?

534
00:49:07,318 --> 00:49:09,537
Only those I trust know that.

535
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:13,121
I could have this one killed.

536
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,164
No.

537
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:20,711
I would offer you coffee, Cross,

538
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:26,388
but the sugar would attract too many flies.

539
00:49:31,217 --> 00:49:33,470
Everyone Cross used to know in Vienna.

540
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:39,685
Everyone Cross used to know
that you know.

541
00:49:40,685 --> 00:49:43,609
We're monitoring
telephone calls to America,

542
00:49:44,063 --> 00:49:46,407
telegrams and radio telegrams.

543
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:49,077
I want the tapes brought here.

544
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:51,530
We've got a watch on all the embassies,

545
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:54,245
but if Cross doesn't move,
he'll be damn near invisible.

546
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:59,421
He'll move. He'll try to get his wife out.

547
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:01,881
He'll need funds and help.

548
00:50:02,081 --> 00:50:03,879
Not if he goes over.

549
00:50:04,083 --> 00:50:05,335
He won't.

550
00:50:05,668 --> 00:50:07,591
McLeod thinks he might.

551
00:50:08,421 --> 00:50:11,721
If he was going over,
he'd be in Moscow, not Vienna.

552
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:16,559
The trouble with McLeod
is that he thinks like McLeod.

553
00:50:17,263 --> 00:50:19,982
You know what a dybbuk is, Mitchell?

554
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,279
Some son of Jewish sprite or ghost.

555
00:50:25,813 --> 00:50:29,693
A spirit that invades another human form.

556
00:50:31,402 --> 00:50:34,702
I'm the dybbuk of Cross's labyrinth mind.

557
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:37,705
I live inside him.

558
00:50:41,454 --> 00:50:42,797
He'll move.

559
00:50:49,003 --> 00:50:50,471
He's in here.

560
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,518
I've assigned Novins and Dor to assist you.

561
00:50:59,597 --> 00:51:01,895
They're both Viennese, both very good men.

562
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:07,689
Of course, as far
as the embassy is concerned,

563
00:51:07,772 --> 00:51:10,616
you don't exist' so don't call for help.

564
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:33,552
Cross.

565
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:37,928
You have some time, Max'?

566
00:51:38,177 --> 00:51:40,396
Until 3:00. But longer if you want.

567
00:51:40,805 --> 00:51:41,931
You hungry?

568
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:44,109
I can hold out if we hurry.

569
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:45,853
Come on!

570
00:52:24,557 --> 00:52:26,150
It's June.

571
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:29,733
Strauss and Strauss and Strauss.

572
00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:32,899
A little Mozart, a little Brahms,

573
00:52:32,982 --> 00:52:36,612
then Strauss and Strauss and Strauss.

574
00:52:38,571 --> 00:52:43,998
Vienna is the only city that puts
on yesterday's clothes for visitors.

575
00:52:46,245 --> 00:52:52,173
Cross, it's been months
since I played any Webern or Berg.

576
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:56,719
And three years since I saw you, Cross.

577
00:52:57,256 --> 00:52:58,678
I'm in trouble, Max.

578
00:52:58,966 --> 00:53:00,013
Can I help?

579
00:53:03,262 --> 00:53:04,935
Maybe you should first ask what.

580
00:53:06,432 --> 00:53:10,062
It would only depress me
or maybe frighten me, Cross.

581
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:12,026
I need a messenger boy, Max.

582
00:53:13,147 --> 00:53:14,364
Waiter!

583
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:17,201
Yes?

584
00:53:18,736 --> 00:53:21,205
Between rehearsals or should I go sick?

585
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,453
- You'll have plenty of time between.
- I see.

586
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:24,959
Could you do the bank today?

587
00:53:24,992 --> 00:53:26,118
The old bank?

588
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,959
There's a teller there by the name
of Karoldy. He'll arrange everything.

589
00:53:28,996 --> 00:53:31,124
He'll give you a key to
a safety deposit box.

590
00:53:31,207 --> 00:53:33,130
In the box are three packages.

591
00:53:33,167 --> 00:53:34,259
Bring them to me.

592
00:53:34,293 --> 00:53:35,340
<i>Okay. '!-

593
00:53:37,338 --> 00:53:38,885
What are you doing this weekend?

594
00:53:39,465 --> 00:53:41,638
I am off Friday till Monday.

595
00:53:41,926 --> 00:53:43,473
Would you like to see Rome?

596
00:53:44,637 --> 00:53:45,763
Rome?

597
00:53:46,472 --> 00:53:49,316
I want someone to meet Sarah,
someone she knows.

598
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:52,563
If I can clear her
in the next few days, will you do it?

599
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:55,148
I need it bad, Max.

600
00:53:56,899 --> 00:53:59,118
Do I take her to Maria's?

601
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:02,038
<i>Danke schon.

602
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:20,674
Nothing.

603
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:23,055
He says he hasn't seen Cross for 20 years.

604
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:26,058
Didn't even know he was still alive.

605
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:27,354
You believe him?

606
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:29,732
Yeah, I'd say so.

607
00:54:31,225 --> 00:54:33,023
Put a marker on him?

608
00:54:33,978 --> 00:54:37,608
Try Stross next. 72, Porkornygasse.

609
00:54:54,081 --> 00:54:55,674
We'll finish the others tomorrow.

610
00:54:55,708 --> 00:54:57,130
You'll be here if anything bites?

611
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,507
I'll be here.

612
00:55:13,392 --> 00:55:14,894
How did you get this?

613
00:55:14,977 --> 00:55:17,275
A man asked for it to be given to you.

614
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:20,650
Man about 50, big, American?

615
00:55:20,733 --> 00:55:22,451
Yes, but he was German.

616
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:23,779
Oh, yeah.

617
00:56:04,193 --> 00:56:06,241
You should have
done it in Paris, Jean.

618
00:56:09,615 --> 00:56:11,663
The price wasn't right.

619
00:56:12,034 --> 00:56:13,536
And now it is?

620
00:56:14,495 --> 00:56:16,623
Yes, now it is.

621
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,338
I could kill you, Jean.

622
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:23,971
Take it, then, Cross.

623
00:56:25,798 --> 00:56:27,641
It won't come around again.

624
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,308
Can we talk?

625
00:56:33,472 --> 00:56:34,644
Sure.

626
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:48,029
McLeod name my sin?

627
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:51,245
He said you sold and had more to sell.

628
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:53,292
And you believe that?

629
00:56:53,492 --> 00:56:56,462
Is it true? I want to know.

630
00:56:57,413 --> 00:57:01,293
For your education? No, it isn't true.

631
00:57:01,667 --> 00:57:02,964
Zharkov.

632
00:57:04,503 --> 00:57:06,005
What about Zharkov?

633
00:57:06,088 --> 00:57:07,886
He is the opposition.

634
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:11,769
I've known Zharkov for almost 30 years.

635
00:57:13,512 --> 00:57:17,142
As an ally, as an enemy
and always as a friend.

636
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:21,229
We're both premature antifascists,

637
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,859
as they used to say in Washington.

638
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:26,818
But Zharkov hasn't sold out
and neither have I.

639
00:57:28,527 --> 00:57:30,655
Then why does McLeod want you dead?

640
00:57:30,696 --> 00:57:32,448
Why don't you ask him that?

641
00:57:32,531 --> 00:57:34,033
I'm asking you.

642
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:38,708
You're looking for God's shining face,
aren't you, Jean?

643
00:57:39,288 --> 00:57:41,131
Something to believe in.

644
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:43,963
Like a young girl
in a white Communion dress.

645
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:50,050
But you've got the soul of a torturer,
so your need is greater.

646
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:53,728
You lied to me, Cross, and you used me.

647
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,393
For that I'm going to kill you.

648
00:57:56,722 --> 00:58:00,943
I never lied to you' Jean.
I used you, but I never lied to you.

649
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:05,235
Not my doing, Cross, I swear.

650
00:58:06,565 --> 00:58:09,239
Don't trust McLeod.
He ordered you dropped twice,

651
00:58:09,485 --> 00:58:11,453
Damascus and Marseilles.

652
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:15,120
That's why I gave you so much
information on each job,

653
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:16,371
something to bargain with.

654
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:18,127
You owe me, Jean.

655
00:58:33,217 --> 00:58:34,389
Where?

656
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:35,929
He's up there.

657
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:41,373
You had him last night and you let him go.

658
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:45,081
That's how it looks in my report
to Washington,

659
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:46,791
unless you've got something to change it.

660
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:50,173
Dor says you didn't even try
to get a shot off.

661
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:54,473
Where the hell do you think you're going?

662
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:59,187
Never put your hands on me.

663
01:00:27,623 --> 01:00:30,923
Cross, I'm off until Tuesday.

664
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:37,805
I want you to call Washington for me.

665
01:00:38,467 --> 01:00:40,515
The number and the message
is in that envelope.

666
01:00:40,594 --> 01:00:41,595
<i>Okay. '!-

667
01:00:41,887 --> 01:00:44,356
Repeat the message exactly as it's written.

668
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:45,562
Yes.

669
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:47,226
Call from a phone box.

670
01:00:48,185 --> 01:00:49,732
You still don't have any questions?

671
01:00:50,646 --> 01:00:53,991
What answers could you have
that would make any difference?

672
01:00:54,608 --> 01:00:56,360
I love you, Cross.

673
01:00:56,819 --> 01:01:01,290
And I you, Max. That's why I must
tell you there could be pain in this.

674
01:01:01,615 --> 01:01:03,993
I have been inoculated.

675
01:01:04,493 --> 01:01:05,870
You know, Cross,

676
01:01:06,036 --> 01:01:10,257
I used to think
that the only music I would ever hear,

677
01:01:10,332 --> 01:01:12,755
no matter what I was really playing,

678
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:15,926
was the music we played each morning

679
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:18,258
when the others went out to work.

680
01:01:19,425 --> 01:01:21,348
Or the music for the selection,

681
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:25,311
when the lucky ones went into the showers.

682
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:30,319
Now I can hear Brahms...

683
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:32,984
And not crying.

684
01:01:34,899 --> 01:01:37,698
But one image has never blurred.

685
01:01:38,986 --> 01:01:44,084
Cross, you coming through
that gate and taking me home.

686
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:11,791
Oh, for...

687
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:50,744
They're pulling in the net. Both sides.

688
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:53,295
They want you delivered, Cross.

689
01:03:54,496 --> 01:03:58,376
I can't go back. You know that.
Not after this kind of a move.

690
01:03:59,209 --> 01:04:01,211
Not even if the Soviets took the leash off.

691
01:04:01,253 --> 01:04:02,675
But your wife...

692
01:04:06,842 --> 01:04:08,685
I'll have her out in two days.

693
01:04:10,763 --> 01:04:12,765
Do you know why McLeod hates you, Cross?

694
01:04:12,806 --> 01:04:15,184
Because you are
one of Donovan's adventurers,

695
01:04:15,267 --> 01:04:17,144
the last of the Knights Templar.

696
01:04:18,103 --> 01:04:19,355
You don't stand up straight.

697
01:04:19,438 --> 01:04:22,487
You have your hands in your pockets,
show no respect.

698
01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:26,533
And tonight you are going
to get drunk with a Russian.

699
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:30,867
And we are going to get drunk, Cross.

700
01:04:32,785 --> 01:04:34,958
What was it you used to say?

701
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:37,373
"Falling down drunk. "

702
01:04:39,666 --> 01:04:43,170
Falling down drunk.
And then we'll get maudlin.

703
01:04:44,088 --> 01:04:46,557
We will sing, I will cry,

704
01:04:47,132 --> 01:04:50,807
and then I will tell you
some very funny stories.

705
01:05:00,729 --> 01:05:04,154
<i>Tell Mother
to take the books back to the library.

706
01:05:04,191 --> 01:05:05,818
<i>They are overdue.

707
01:05:05,984 --> 01:05:09,659
<i>Give her my love
and tell her not to carry things.

708
01:05:13,283 --> 01:05:15,661
Just a man calling his mother, Mitchell?

709
01:05:16,662 --> 01:05:18,835
Only two things don't wash, Mitchell.

710
01:05:19,206 --> 01:05:22,631
He called a public phone in Washington,
and he doesn't have a mother.

711
01:05:24,169 --> 01:05:26,388
His whole family died in the camps.

712
01:05:27,506 --> 01:05:30,806
You didn't crosscheck each one, Mitchell,
and you cost me a day.

713
01:05:32,511 --> 01:05:35,139
You are so damn quick
to write notes to McLeod.

714
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:37,274
Put that in, Mitchell.

715
01:05:41,186 --> 01:05:44,030
I traced it back to a Max Lang.

716
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:48,364
He used a phone booth
in a cafe near the state opera house.

717
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:52,623
You knew that, Mitchell,
but you didn't go there.

718
01:05:52,698 --> 01:05:53,950
Dead end.

719
01:05:54,158 --> 01:05:56,001
It could have been a dead end.

720
01:05:56,410 --> 01:06:00,415
But Lang needed more change.
He asked one of the waiters.

721
01:06:01,248 --> 01:06:03,046
The waiter knows him.

722
01:06:03,792 --> 01:06:05,840
He is a cellist, Mitchell.

723
01:06:07,421 --> 01:06:09,173
And, even more important,

724
01:06:09,548 --> 01:06:12,927
he was in the Resistance
when Cross was liaison.

725
01:06:13,385 --> 01:06:15,638
The whole goddamn things redundant.

726
01:06:16,722 --> 01:06:21,068
There are no more secrets.
At least, none worth stealing.

727
01:06:21,101 --> 01:06:23,195
It's a lower form of life.

728
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:28,780
Its reason of existence is
its reason to exist.

729
01:06:31,445 --> 01:06:33,072
What the hell are you doing?

730
01:06:36,992 --> 01:06:38,494
Jesus, Sergei.

731
01:06:39,077 --> 01:06:40,750
You even hide things from yourself.

732
01:06:42,122 --> 01:06:45,046
Tell me, what keeps you from burning out?

733
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,376
Hmm?

734
01:06:46,877 --> 01:06:51,383
You see before you
the last of a race of giants.

735
01:06:51,423 --> 01:06:54,051
No, no, no. I mean seriously.

736
01:06:54,092 --> 01:06:55,435
Seriously?

737
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:58,939
I still believe. I'm still a communist.

738
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:07,323
Communist? For Christ's sakes!
After what you've seen?

739
01:07:08,732 --> 01:07:12,908
You've seen it turn brutal... inhuman.

740
01:07:12,945 --> 01:07:17,041
No, Cross. I've seen men use it badly.

741
01:07:17,991 --> 01:07:20,744
What about the trials? The purges?

742
01:07:20,786 --> 01:07:25,587
Trials, purges, they are words
you have read somewhere, Cross.

743
01:07:28,126 --> 01:07:30,504
My trial was so grotesque,

744
01:07:31,797 --> 01:07:36,428
my hours of interrogation
so terrible that I was numb.

745
01:07:36,468 --> 01:07:41,269
It was a kind of
frontal lobotomy without anesthetic.

746
01:07:44,643 --> 01:07:46,520
And the labor camps,

747
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:52,574
where men, good communists' old fighters,

748
01:07:54,152 --> 01:07:58,783
men who believed
in the dignity of man above all else,

749
01:07:59,533 --> 01:08:04,631
were used as drought animals
to pull logs on frozen feet.

750
01:08:06,665 --> 01:08:10,966
That this could be the result
of all I had committed my life to.

751
01:08:11,628 --> 01:08:17,385
But, baby, at that moment,
didn't you realize what was happening?

752
01:08:17,467 --> 01:08:21,688
At that moment I tried to
understand what had happened to me.

753
01:08:23,348 --> 01:08:25,350
Most of us there were communists,

754
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:28,108
not Stalinists. That is why we were there.

755
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:31,483
Nothing had happened
to make me renounce myself.

756
01:08:32,524 --> 01:08:37,075
I was still a communist.
Stalin couldn't take it away from me.

757
01:08:38,155 --> 01:08:41,034
And now the dull, gray stupidity

758
01:08:41,074 --> 01:08:43,042
that sends the tanks into Prague

759
01:08:43,785 --> 01:08:46,208
because ii has no imagination,

760
01:08:47,122 --> 01:08:49,500
it can't take it from me either.

761
01:08:51,335 --> 01:08:53,212
I am still a communist.

762
01:08:55,964 --> 01:08:57,841
You're still an idiot.

763
01:08:59,718 --> 01:09:03,598
You still serve that dull, gray stupidity.

764
01:09:08,977 --> 01:09:11,355
And when they pull the wire on me,

765
01:09:12,356 --> 01:09:14,825
I'll deliver you to them, Cross.

766
01:09:17,069 --> 01:09:21,825
Yesterday at 1620,
Sarah Cross received a local phone call,

767
01:09:22,449 --> 01:09:24,702
the same message as the one monitored

768
01:09:24,743 --> 01:09:27,212
in Vienna to someone here in Washington.

769
01:09:27,621 --> 01:09:29,874
We have no trace on that someone.

770
01:09:30,374 --> 01:09:34,845
She left the house at 1705.
Notice the handbag.

771
01:09:35,212 --> 01:09:36,885
It's big enough to carry a package,

772
01:09:37,047 --> 01:09:40,096
say, the size of a book, without it showing.

773
01:09:41,259 --> 01:09:43,136
She went to this storage house.

774
01:09:44,304 --> 01:09:47,399
Cross kept some Middle Eastern
furniture and artifacts there

775
01:09:47,432 --> 01:09:49,776
from the time he sent
his wife home from Cairo.

776
01:09:50,143 --> 01:09:52,612
She signed in, got the keys
and went upstairs.

777
01:09:52,646 --> 01:09:54,774
She was inside six minutes.

778
01:09:55,607 --> 01:09:59,111
She told the inventory clerk
she had to measure a cabinet.

779
01:10:00,779 --> 01:10:02,201
She signed nothing out.

780
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:05,500
She left and drove to
the Library of Congress building.

781
01:10:06,952 --> 01:10:09,375
We got no film inside that building,

782
01:10:09,454 --> 01:10:11,627
but one of our operatives followed her.

783
01:10:12,457 --> 01:10:13,959
The place was crowded with tourists

784
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,502
and it was nearly closing time.

785
01:10:17,295 --> 01:10:20,424
Now, she spoke to no one,

786
01:10:22,467 --> 01:10:26,142
deposited nothing,
simply wandered through the exhibit halls.

787
01:10:26,221 --> 01:10:29,065
However, on her way out she had to pass

788
01:10:29,141 --> 01:10:31,314
through a group on a conducted tour.

789
01:10:31,977 --> 01:10:33,979
No way to check persons on tour.

790
01:10:36,648 --> 01:10:39,618
She exited the building at 1749.

791
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:42,912
Could be a drop.

792
01:10:42,988 --> 01:10:44,615
But did she make her connection?

793
01:10:45,115 --> 01:10:47,038
Probably someone in that tour group.

794
01:10:47,117 --> 01:10:49,540
Or she could have picked something up
just as easily.

795
01:10:49,619 --> 01:10:51,587
Passport, ticket, escape details.

796
01:10:51,663 --> 01:10:53,165
She's due to run.

797
01:10:53,665 --> 01:10:55,713
I want her place searched.

798
01:10:56,793 --> 01:10:59,797
Get Heck Thomas, he lives behind her,

799
01:11:00,505 --> 01:11:03,133
to invite her for drinks, dinner, anything.

800
01:11:03,884 --> 01:11:06,512
Then get a contract thief
to get one of our men in there.

801
01:11:07,053 --> 01:11:09,602
Brief him on what
he might be expected to find.

802
01:11:10,849 --> 01:11:13,022
Make it look like a routine housebreaking.

803
01:11:13,477 --> 01:11:15,525
The thief s gotta leave prints.

804
01:11:17,230 --> 01:11:19,153
We'll give him shelter.

805
01:12:57,455 --> 01:12:58,877
Where is Cross?

806
01:13:05,255 --> 01:13:09,385
Nothing. He had this in his pocket, though.
The phone message.

807
01:13:12,012 --> 01:13:15,642
<i>Cross's handwriting. I'll talk to Lang.

808
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:18,986
He's dead. He wouldn't talk.

809
01:14:51,945 --> 01:14:54,539
The car! Box him in!

810
01:16:05,769 --> 01:16:07,396
You stay up here.

811
01:17:31,771 --> 01:17:33,114
Cross!

812
01:22:44,542 --> 01:22:47,546
I'm tired, Helen,
and I've been very bad company,

813
01:22:47,753 --> 01:22:51,178
so thank you and say good night
to Heck for me, all right'?

814
01:22:51,424 --> 01:22:53,142
Come over for coffee in the morning.

815
01:22:53,551 --> 01:22:54,552
<i>Okay. '!-

816
01:23:57,865 --> 01:23:59,117
I know about music...

817
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:00,827
Hey, honey, we're out of booze again.

818
01:24:01,118 --> 01:24:02,711
There's a couple more
in the kitchen, darling.

819
01:24:02,787 --> 01:24:04,630
No, that's gone too.

820
01:24:05,373 --> 01:24:08,297
Uh, where'd Sarah get to?

821
01:24:08,626 --> 01:24:11,470
She's gone home. She's got the dumps.

822
01:24:11,963 --> 01:24:13,556
- Jesus, no!
- Heck!

823
01:24:28,145 --> 01:24:31,695
She's gone back to her house.
Should I go after her?

824
01:24:31,941 --> 01:24:34,660
No, don't get involved. Call him. Warn him.

825
01:25:07,977 --> 01:25:09,570
I'm going over there.

826
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:36,423
Jesus Christ! What happened in there?

827
01:27:37,793 --> 01:27:38,885
Now.

828
01:27:43,883 --> 01:27:45,681
More of your litter, Mr. Mitchell.

829
01:27:46,343 --> 01:27:48,812
Always with access to my superiors.

830
01:27:49,638 --> 01:27:52,733
I don't like your type in my streets.

831
01:27:53,350 --> 01:27:56,354
I've lost another man
and that bastard thinks it's funny.

832
01:27:57,021 --> 01:27:59,365
You've lost more
than another man, Mitchell.

833
01:27:59,857 --> 01:28:04,078
You've lost Zharkov.
That means we've lost Cross.

834
01:28:06,238 --> 01:28:09,538
It might just be that Cross

835
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:14,164
would be more valuable, more cooperative,

836
01:28:14,413 --> 01:28:16,507
if we helped him without conditions.

837
01:28:18,417 --> 01:28:19,839
We don't think so.

838
01:28:20,711 --> 01:28:24,011
Alex, you don't think. You take orders.

839
01:28:24,715 --> 01:28:26,638
And so do you, Zharkov.

840
01:28:27,802 --> 01:28:29,930
Your orders are the same as mine,

841
01:28:30,805 --> 01:28:33,900
put Cross on tomorrow's flight to Moscow.

842
01:28:35,142 --> 01:28:38,396
Your apparent intimacy with this man
could be interpreted...

843
01:28:38,479 --> 01:28:41,733
You know, Alex, you remind me
of someone I used to know.

844
01:28:41,982 --> 01:28:43,074
Who?

845
01:28:43,901 --> 01:28:46,370
Funny, he never told me his name.

846
01:28:48,572 --> 01:28:50,916
Like you, he was building his career

847
01:28:50,950 --> 01:28:53,578
on a passionate belief in obedience.

848
01:28:53,953 --> 01:28:56,422
He took his revolution from books,

849
01:28:56,872 --> 01:29:00,922
his Marxism from easy-to-swallow,
predigested pap.

850
01:29:02,002 --> 01:29:04,926
He was building socialism in one country

851
01:29:05,464 --> 01:29:08,764
with the bones from a charnel house.

852
01:29:11,762 --> 01:29:14,732
There were a lot of them around in 1939.

853
01:29:35,411 --> 01:29:37,584
I can't give you any more time, Cross.

854
01:29:40,207 --> 01:29:41,379
Two days.

855
01:29:41,876 --> 01:29:43,549
My head on a tray.

856
01:29:47,590 --> 01:29:48,807
Malkin?

857
01:29:51,969 --> 01:29:54,267
Another keen son of a bitch.

858
01:29:54,305 --> 01:29:56,057
Better get dressed.

859
01:30:04,023 --> 01:30:05,775
You know, Sergei...

860
01:30:08,736 --> 01:30:11,159
I might be better than you in a closed room.

861
01:30:11,572 --> 01:30:13,324
Don't even think about it.

862
01:30:17,453 --> 01:30:18,750
For you.

863
01:30:22,291 --> 01:30:27,843
Do me one favor, Cross.
Run, as fast and as far as you can.

864
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:31,517
You've nothing but enemies now.
Both sides.

865
01:30:33,010 --> 01:30:35,854
Don't catalog
the excuses through the alphabet.

866
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:37,523
You got it cleaned up?

867
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:40,940
Morrison's in the hospital,
with our own medical people in attendance.

868
01:30:41,352 --> 01:30:43,354
- It's a bad wound.
- The thief?

869
01:30:43,395 --> 01:30:45,193
He ran. Untraceable so far.

870
01:30:45,272 --> 01:30:47,024
No one's untraceable.

871
01:30:47,066 --> 01:30:48,693
Damp down the police search.

872
01:30:48,734 --> 01:30:50,407
We don't have the means.

873
01:30:50,486 --> 01:30:52,033
Over their heads, we do.

874
01:30:52,071 --> 01:30:53,493
If Milne's found dead,

875
01:30:53,530 --> 01:30:55,123
that'll make for more questions.

876
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:57,247
More questions make for deeper probes.

877
01:30:57,618 --> 01:30:58,835
All right.

878
01:30:59,995 --> 01:31:03,044
All right, but get Morrison
out of Washington. Fly him to Panama.

879
01:31:03,374 --> 01:31:05,047
It is a bad wound.

880
01:31:06,210 --> 01:31:08,633
I won't cry if the goof dies.

881
01:31:36,115 --> 01:31:37,958
Change your mind, my friend?

882
01:31:41,537 --> 01:31:43,585
I've bad news, Cross.

883
01:31:45,416 --> 01:31:49,546
Our sister Sarah has gone to her rest
in the peace of Christ.

884
01:31:50,713 --> 01:31:53,307
With faith and hope of eternal life,

885
01:31:54,091 --> 01:31:57,561
let us commend Sarah
to the loving mercy of our Father.

886
01:31:59,638 --> 01:32:01,891
The hunter home from the hill.

887
01:32:02,182 --> 01:32:06,358
I'd buy a plot here soon, Mr. McLeod.
It's a nice cemetery.

888
01:32:06,437 --> 01:32:08,439
You think I'm responsible for this?

889
01:32:08,856 --> 01:32:10,108
Cross will.

890
01:32:10,190 --> 01:32:11,863
And you think he'll come back?

891
01:32:13,610 --> 01:32:14,953
Don't you?

892
01:32:17,114 --> 01:32:19,208
We have evidence that he's in Moscow.

893
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:24,460
Then burn incense in front of it, McLeod.
And pray.

894
01:32:27,624 --> 01:32:30,844
From our end, the contract is still open.

895
01:32:42,139 --> 01:32:43,857
Why the Bahnhof?

896
01:32:43,932 --> 01:32:47,061
All faces are anonymous in railway stations.

897
01:32:47,519 --> 01:32:49,146
You're sure there will be no trouble?

898
01:32:49,980 --> 01:32:54,486
He's there, packed and ready
to make the trip.

899
01:33:16,673 --> 01:33:19,472
The negatives and prints
are on their way to Moscow.

900
01:33:20,636 --> 01:33:23,355
There is a limited interpretation possible,

901
01:33:23,597 --> 01:33:27,647
but an accompanying report
clarifies the more shadowed areas.

902
01:33:28,185 --> 01:33:30,529
And you are seeing Cross off.

903
01:33:31,522 --> 01:33:36,028
You might try denial, but ii is a weak plea,

904
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:40,831
and at best would leave you
open to charges of incompetence.

905
01:33:49,373 --> 01:33:51,171
I suggest you defect.

906
01:33:56,213 --> 01:34:00,138
Cross, Zharkov getting off
a Soviet Ilyushin aircraft

907
01:34:00,634 --> 01:34:02,386
This photo's reported to have been taken

908
01:34:02,469 --> 01:34:05,188
from the observation roof
of the Moscow airport.

909
01:34:05,722 --> 01:34:08,350
<i>Lab says could be but no hard evidence.

910
01:34:09,601 --> 01:34:14,402
Cross here shaking hands with three VIPS.
Zharkov in the background.

911
01:34:14,481 --> 01:34:16,950
That indicates the three are high-ranking.

912
01:34:17,025 --> 01:34:20,871
No telling who these two are,
but this one in profile could be Stolypin,

913
01:34:21,572 --> 01:34:23,324
head of the Arab section in Moscow.

914
01:34:24,283 --> 01:34:26,206
Notice this maintenance vehicle.

915
01:34:26,577 --> 01:34:27,749
The lab blew it up

916
01:34:27,828 --> 01:34:31,753
and it definitely has the markings
and plate numbers of Moscow.

917
01:34:33,083 --> 01:34:34,801
Now, that's the first hard evidence.

918
01:34:35,502 --> 01:34:38,426
All the rest are blow-ups
to examine everything in detail.

919
01:34:39,798 --> 01:34:43,769
We've combed it out tight,
the results say it probably is Moscow.

920
01:34:44,011 --> 01:34:46,935
But could be Prague or Budapest.

921
01:34:47,681 --> 01:34:48,933
Okay, Torn.

922
01:34:50,392 --> 01:34:52,144
Where's Zharkov now?

923
01:34:52,436 --> 01:34:53,608
Cairo.

924
01:34:53,854 --> 01:34:56,027
Flew directly there from Moscow.

925
01:34:56,648 --> 01:34:59,822
The opposition is chortling
about some coup.

926
01:35:01,570 --> 01:35:03,538
Cross has gone over.

927
01:35:05,115 --> 01:35:07,117
Scorpio still expects him.

928
01:35:09,578 --> 01:35:11,296
The Frenchman's a loser.

929
01:35:20,964 --> 01:35:24,468
You could have had that beautiful
Abyssinian in the pet shop. He was lovely.

930
01:35:24,885 --> 01:35:26,637
I like street cats.

931
01:35:32,392 --> 01:35:34,645
I'm going to call you Sun Tzu.

932
01:35:35,562 --> 01:35:37,530
Who on earth is Sun Tzu?

933
01:35:37,648 --> 01:35:39,992
A great scholar of war. Wasn't he, cat?

934
01:35:40,025 --> 01:35:41,493
I bet he has fleas.

935
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:43,662
It's a sign of his independence.

936
01:35:43,779 --> 01:35:46,623
I wanted to buy you
something lovely and exotic.

937
01:35:46,657 --> 01:35:49,001
You wanted
to buy me something I wanted.

938
01:35:50,035 --> 01:35:52,003
All right, I'll take this one.

939
01:35:52,287 --> 01:35:54,710
Okay, but there's no charge, lady.

940
01:35:54,790 --> 01:35:57,634
If you want 10 give something, there's
a donation box in front of the office.

941
01:35:57,668 --> 01:35:58,715
<i>Okay. '!-

942
01:36:04,716 --> 01:36:06,684
Should we give him anything special to eat?

943
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:09,513
Oh, no, no. You can use anything.
Any scraps from the kitchen.

944
01:36:09,596 --> 01:36:10,688
If he's hungry, he'll eat anything.

945
01:36:10,764 --> 01:36:13,563
Just a word, Mr. Laurier.
A few minutes, please.

946
01:36:17,813 --> 01:36:21,158
McLeod has closed the Cross file.

947
01:36:22,901 --> 01:36:24,653
Is that a polite warning?

948
01:36:25,195 --> 01:36:27,948
No. I'm here on my own.

949
01:36:29,783 --> 01:36:31,251
I'd like your opinion.

950
01:36:31,326 --> 01:36:33,078
You know my opinion.

951
01:36:35,706 --> 01:36:38,960
That airport, could be Moscow.

952
01:36:40,877 --> 01:36:43,050
- Could be'?
- We think it is.

953
01:36:43,171 --> 01:36:45,720
But could be Prague or Budapest.

954
01:36:46,633 --> 01:36:48,556
That's careless geography.

955
01:36:50,721 --> 01:36:54,476
You, uh...
You still think Cross will come back?

956
01:36:57,019 --> 01:36:59,021
If that was Moscow, they'd hardly let him

957
01:36:59,062 --> 01:37:01,565
pose for few photographs and then leave,
would they?

958
01:37:02,774 --> 01:37:04,196
I don't know where ii is,

959
01:37:04,901 --> 01:37:08,155
and I don't know
what the Russians might or might not do.

960
01:37:09,114 --> 01:37:10,832
But I know what Cross will do.

961
01:37:12,326 --> 01:37:14,249
What do you think I should do?

962
01:37:15,162 --> 01:37:18,587
Sit in McLeod's chair and see if it fits.

963
01:37:20,417 --> 01:37:22,294
It will be vacant soon.

964
01:37:28,592 --> 01:37:29,809
<i>We've got a fix on the thief

965
01:37:30,344 --> 01:37:33,939
His name's Paul Milne. He's running scared.

966
01:37:34,264 --> 01:37:36,858
I'd hit him tonight, Cross.
He might be gone by tomorrow.

967
01:37:39,644 --> 01:37:41,396
He's a third-term man,

968
01:37:41,438 --> 01:37:44,112
so he's down for life
without a killing on his sheets.

969
01:37:44,649 --> 01:37:47,778
With that bonus, the law should
be breathing hard down his back,

970
01:37:48,070 --> 01:37:49,822
but there's no heat.

971
01:37:50,113 --> 01:37:52,616
The story is around that the man downtown

972
01:37:52,657 --> 01:37:54,785
has been told to cool it
and doesn't like it.

973
01:37:54,993 --> 01:37:59,339
The grumble goes high up.
You think they could put a fix in?

974
01:37:59,414 --> 01:38:03,669
They might if they had a good reason.
What's this Milne's form like?

975
01:38:04,169 --> 01:38:07,548
Housebreaker, jimmy and soft-shoe stuff.

976
01:38:08,006 --> 01:38:10,350
He's never been caught
with a gun or a blade.

977
01:38:10,967 --> 01:38:14,346
I've asked around,
but nobody says he shot your wife.

978
01:38:16,765 --> 01:38:17,891
But you know where to find him.

979
01:38:45,877 --> 01:38:47,220
What the hell is this?

980
01:38:49,297 --> 01:38:51,550
Who are you guys?

981
01:38:55,429 --> 01:38:58,399
No! Jesus, that's gas!

982
01:38:58,807 --> 01:39:00,275
Who are you?

983
01:39:02,018 --> 01:39:03,190
Match.

984
01:39:04,563 --> 01:39:06,315
Holy mother of God!

985
01:39:09,901 --> 01:39:11,198
The job where the woman was killed.

986
01:39:11,278 --> 01:39:14,157
I didn't kill her! I don't carry a gun.

987
01:39:14,197 --> 01:39:15,289
Who?

988
01:39:15,740 --> 01:39:18,539
I was hired. This guy.
I don't even know his name.

989
01:39:18,702 --> 01:39:20,045
Did he tell you what to look for?

990
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:22,873
Notebook, a small package.

991
01:39:23,206 --> 01:39:25,629
Paper, letters, anything with writing on it.

992
01:39:25,750 --> 01:39:27,172
- Did he shoot her?
- Yes.

993
01:39:28,587 --> 01:39:32,342
The lady comes in sudden
and she's got this gun.

994
01:39:34,384 --> 01:39:37,638
She opened up on him and he blasted her.

995
01:39:38,847 --> 01:39:40,019
Cross.

996
01:39:45,228 --> 01:39:48,072
Give up smoking, thief.
It's bad for your health.

997
01:39:56,740 --> 01:39:58,208
So now you know.

998
01:39:58,325 --> 01:39:59,702
Now I know.

999
01:40:02,162 --> 01:40:04,665
How are you gonna get that guy
if he's as big as you say he is'?

1000
01:40:04,748 --> 01:40:06,216
He ain't gonna be no Lady Godiva.

1001
01:40:14,382 --> 01:40:15,679
Miff Wilson.

1002
01:40:15,759 --> 01:40:17,261
Cross, man, it's gonna cost you.

1003
01:40:17,802 --> 01:40:19,099
I can afford it.

1004
01:40:19,930 --> 01:40:22,649
I've saved enough to buy a mountain
I won't need any more.

1005
01:40:32,776 --> 01:40:37,282
I know you're out there, Cross.
I can feel it.

1006
01:40:58,969 --> 01:41:00,471
- Miff.
- Cross.

1007
01:41:00,512 --> 01:41:01,764
- How are you?
- Great.

1008
01:41:01,805 --> 01:41:03,352
- Got a minute? Let's step outside.
- Sure.

1009
01:41:03,431 --> 01:41:04,432
Sure.

1010
01:41:08,353 --> 01:41:11,482
Miff, remember the job
you did for me in Michigan?

1011
01:41:13,149 --> 01:41:14,822
I want you to take care of someone for me.

1012
01:41:15,443 --> 01:41:17,491
He'll be coming clown the street
in a black Cadillac car.

1013
01:41:23,660 --> 01:41:25,128
Hey, nut.

1014
01:41:25,662 --> 01:41:27,539
What are you doing?

1015
01:41:28,915 --> 01:41:30,337
They're beautiful.

1016
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:33,428
We're going to Paris.

1017
01:41:34,588 --> 01:41:35,635
When?

1018
01:41:35,839 --> 01:41:39,469
Tomorrow. We'll get an apartment.

1019
01:41:39,509 --> 01:41:41,136
You've got an apartment.

1020
01:41:41,177 --> 01:41:42,520
A new one.

1021
01:41:43,179 --> 01:41:46,774
You're crazy. You know that?
Crazy out of your skull.

1022
01:41:49,019 --> 01:41:50,066
No.

1023
01:41:55,275 --> 01:41:56,652
I love you.

1024
01:42:04,492 --> 01:42:06,290
If anything happens to me,

1025
01:42:07,829 --> 01:42:11,754
if I'm stopped at the airport
or anything like that,

1026
01:42:13,168 --> 01:42:17,719
take this to the French Embassy,
to a Gil Mousseau.

1027
01:42:18,048 --> 01:42:20,142
Gil Mousseau.

1028
01:42:20,675 --> 01:42:22,222
And give it to him.

1029
01:42:23,219 --> 01:42:25,062
He'll know what to do.

1030
01:42:25,722 --> 01:42:27,565
No, don't ask now.

1031
01:42:28,141 --> 01:42:30,940
I'll tell you soon. In Paris.

1032
01:42:31,019 --> 01:42:32,737
Are you in trouble, Jean?

1033
01:42:33,730 --> 01:42:36,950
No. That's my insurance policy.

1034
01:42:38,735 --> 01:42:41,488
You know I'm old-fashioned enough
to buy you a ring.

1035
01:42:42,530 --> 01:42:44,908
And I know a place
that makes a good breakfast.

1036
01:42:50,747 --> 01:42:52,169
See you on Monday, Fil.

1037
01:42:52,248 --> 01:42:53,591
Have a good lunch.

1038
01:42:53,667 --> 01:42:57,763
Bloody martini circuit.
Damn town runs on olives and small talk.

1039
01:43:32,997 --> 01:43:34,123
This is it.

1040
01:43:35,041 --> 01:43:36,042
Is this the place?

1041
01:43:36,126 --> 01:43:37,844
- This'll be okay.
- Right on.

1042
01:43:37,961 --> 01:43:39,429
You drive on.

1043
01:44:09,826 --> 01:44:11,828
Stay here, Mr. McLeod. I'll see to it.

1044
01:44:16,875 --> 01:44:18,377
Don't move me.

1045
01:44:19,002 --> 01:44:20,720
Call an ambulance.

1046
01:44:23,673 --> 01:44:25,550
Don't move me.

1047
01:44:40,565 --> 01:44:41,942
Mr. McLeod, sir.

1048
01:44:48,156 --> 01:44:50,079
Quick, quick! Get an ambulance.

1049
01:44:57,957 --> 01:45:00,710
Your flight leaves Dulles airport at 7:50.

1050
01:45:03,087 --> 01:45:04,589
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

1051
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:10,512
I will see you over there.

1052
01:45:10,553 --> 01:45:11,679
Yeah.

1053
01:45:15,350 --> 01:45:16,693
Mr. Laurier.

1054
01:45:18,102 --> 01:45:22,073
You were right, Scorpio.
We should have listened to you.

1055
01:45:24,025 --> 01:45:26,619
Are you going to fulfill your contract now?

1056
01:45:29,405 --> 01:45:30,657
I'm out.

1057
01:45:32,408 --> 01:45:34,331
We still want Cross.

1058
01:45:35,411 --> 01:45:39,917
He'll make contact now
with the opposition, one last big delivery.

1059
01:45:42,210 --> 01:45:45,214
You've shown me no proof
that Cross was a traitor.

1060
01:45:47,006 --> 01:45:48,929
You've got a handful of maybes.

1061
01:45:50,009 --> 01:45:52,853
You can't buy 10 minutes
of my time with that.

1062
01:45:53,096 --> 01:45:56,646
Proof? You want proof?

1063
01:45:57,809 --> 01:46:01,279
What do you think McLeod was?
A psychopath?

1064
01:46:01,354 --> 01:46:03,698
Some sick mind that
went about ordering killings

1065
01:46:03,773 --> 01:46:05,320
to make his days interesting?

1066
01:46:05,483 --> 01:46:10,410
No. He was a professional,
like Cross, but with a difference.

1067
01:46:10,613 --> 01:46:11,956
He was honest.

1068
01:46:12,574 --> 01:46:15,168
He had only two gods, efficiency and duty.

1069
01:46:15,702 --> 01:46:17,295
Cross is a double agent.

1070
01:46:20,373 --> 01:46:24,753
In intelligence all evidence is,
of necessity, circumstantial,

1071
01:46:24,794 --> 01:46:29,470
<i>but Cross had bank accounts
with considerable assets in Zurich,

1072
01:46:29,924 --> 01:46:33,019
under the number 30-98-71.

1073
01:46:33,469 --> 01:46:36,439
You can see it written down there
in his handwriting,

1074
01:46:36,806 --> 01:46:38,524
checked out against a signature

1075
01:46:38,641 --> 01:46:41,485
on his American Express credit card.

1076
01:46:42,103 --> 01:46:45,983
In that account alone, he had $238,000,

1077
01:46:47,191 --> 01:46:49,819
down this year to $124,000.

1078
01:46:52,447 --> 01:46:55,997
By the way, Scorpio,
you can hold the picture on screen

1079
01:46:56,075 --> 01:46:59,545
or close in on it
by using that panel in front of you.

1080
01:47:00,705 --> 01:47:03,584
His next account turned up in Panama,

1081
01:47:04,042 --> 01:47:06,670
this time under the name
Robert Crosthwaite.

1082
01:47:07,337 --> 01:47:10,136
Credit, $19,500.

1083
01:47:10,715 --> 01:47:15,892
He also has a Dallas bank account
under the name Gerald Cross.

1084
01:47:16,679 --> 01:47:21,480
Assets, as of January '73, $60,000.

1085
01:47:21,935 --> 01:47:25,405
I grant you, field work demands
trading with the opposition.

1086
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:27,699
Cross knew men like Zharkov but...

1087
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:31,198
Here he is with Raymond Hussein in Paris,

1088
01:47:31,444 --> 01:47:34,197
a man who he told us he had never met.

1089
01:47:35,365 --> 01:47:37,459
Here with Robert Simmonds in Beirut,

1090
01:47:37,533 --> 01:47:40,036
another name that never
appears in his field reports.

1091
01:47:40,411 --> 01:47:43,540
Cross again in an Arab guerrilla camp
with Salem Demoum.

1092
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:48,341
All these men were responsible
for receiving substantial information leaks

1093
01:47:48,378 --> 01:47:50,472
from unidentified sources,

1094
01:47:50,713 --> 01:47:53,091
leaks that could have come from Cross.

1095
01:47:54,842 --> 01:47:57,061
So when Cross' wife
returned to Washington,

1096
01:47:57,095 --> 01:47:58,768
we put her under surveillance.

1097
01:47:58,846 --> 01:48:02,350
Now, we have reason to believe
that she was being used as a delivery.

1098
01:48:03,518 --> 01:48:07,239
Now, this was filmed by
one of our agents when she left the house

1099
01:48:07,271 --> 01:48:10,150
shortly after the message
you monitored in Vienna,

1100
01:48:10,566 --> 01:48:11,909
was called through to Washington.

1101
01:48:12,610 --> 01:48:14,237
She went to this storage house.

1102
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:16,163
Cross kept some belongings there.

1103
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:19,750
Then she left, went directly
to the Library of Congress building,

1104
01:48:19,993 --> 01:48:21,870
we believe to pass a message.

1105
01:48:22,370 --> 01:48:25,715
It was very crowded there with
tourists. She may have made a drop.

1106
01:48:26,457 --> 01:48:27,834
Our agent couldn't be sure

1107
01:48:27,917 --> 01:48:30,420
because he wasn't allowed
to photograph in the building.

1108
01:48:30,461 --> 01:48:34,182
She left there at 5:49,
just before closing time.

1109
01:48:55,445 --> 01:48:57,163
<i>a' picked you up, remember?

1110
01:48:57,238 --> 01:49:00,037
<i>I only talked Anne into
sharing an apartment with me

1111
01:49:00,116 --> 01:49:01,834
<i>so I had an excuse to be around.

1112
01:49:02,493 --> 01:49:04,370
<i>I picked you up, remember?

1113
01:49:44,327 --> 01:49:46,329
Good night. Bye-bye.

1114
01:50:50,476 --> 01:50:51,568
Jean.

1115
01:50:52,603 --> 01:50:53,604
Jean.

1116
01:51:16,752 --> 01:51:19,221
You'll have to look me in the eye
when you kill me, Jean.

1117
01:51:20,590 --> 01:51:24,220
That won't bother me. Not this time.

1118
01:51:25,261 --> 01:51:27,434
No, you're a one-talent man, Frenchman.

1119
01:51:28,890 --> 01:51:33,066
You took this contract 'cause you wanted
inside, you wanted my job,

1120
01:51:34,937 --> 01:51:37,486
and you needed a McLeod
to carry your sins for you.

1121
01:51:38,357 --> 01:51:40,359
I was finished with you, Cross.

1122
01:51:41,110 --> 01:51:44,455
I was going home tomorrow... With her.

1123
01:51:45,615 --> 01:51:47,117
She was my way out.

1124
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:50,124
I'm sorry about the girl. Truly sorry.

1125
01:51:51,037 --> 01:51:52,914
But I had no part of her plans.

1126
01:51:53,706 --> 01:51:56,004
She was a Czech courier, and very good.

1127
01:52:01,964 --> 01:52:03,932
A lot of hard work went
into collecting this.

1128
01:52:12,058 --> 01:52:13,981
Go ahead, Scorpio. It should be easy.

1129
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:18,568
You'd be doing both of us a favor,

1130
01:52:20,566 --> 01:52:23,194
and there's an outside chance
they might let you live.

1131
01:52:24,237 --> 01:52:26,331
Two for one.

1132
01:52:47,510 --> 01:52:51,936
There's a room just down the hall
from McLeod's office,

1133
01:52:54,767 --> 01:52:57,145
where grown men play a game.

1134
01:52:57,520 --> 01:53:02,196
It's a bit like Monopoly,
only more people get hurt.

1135
01:53:07,321 --> 01:53:11,292
There's no good... And no bad.

1136
01:53:12,952 --> 01:53:14,169
Jesus.

1137
01:53:16,497 --> 01:53:19,922
The object is not to win,

1138
01:53:22,670 --> 01:53:24,468
but not to lose,

1139
01:53:25,589 --> 01:53:29,890
and the only rule is to stay in the game.
