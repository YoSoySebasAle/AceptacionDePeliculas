1
00:13:59,501 --> 00:14:01,962
I'm looking for the M8.

2
00:14:05,466 --> 00:14:09,303
Aye, you've gotta go
straight along that way and-

3
00:14:10,387 --> 00:14:11,963
This is gonna be pure hard to explain.

4
00:14:12,264 --> 00:14:14,632
- Do you know where the Asda is?
- No.

5
00:14:14,933 --> 00:14:17,802
Yeah, I don't even know
what way you're pointin'. What?

6
00:14:18,103 --> 00:14:20,067
See, if you just drive
straight along up there...

7
00:14:20,248 --> 00:14:23,099
- Yes?
- And see the traffic lights up there?

8
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,684
Take a right.

9
00:14:24,985 --> 00:14:26,625
Then you'll go past Ibrox Stadium, right?

10
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:28,354
And go straight through a roundabout.

11
00:14:28,655 --> 00:14:32,859
Then take a left.
So it's right, then just-

12
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,694
And it's there. The motorway is there.

13
00:14:34,995 --> 00:14:36,315
It's back of Asda. You'll see it.

14
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,406
- Back of Asda, see?
- Okay.

15
00:14:38,707 --> 00:14:41,043
- Am I keeping you from something?
- No.

16
00:14:42,085 --> 00:14:43,703
- Where are you going?
- Along here.

17
00:14:44,004 --> 00:14:46,956
- For what? For work?
- No, I need to go meet somebody.

18
00:14:47,257 --> 00:14:48,897
- Oh, you're going to meet someone.
- Aye.

19
00:14:49,051 --> 00:14:50,511
- All right. Thank you.
- Sure.

20
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,409
<i>I'm looking for a post office.</i>

21
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,411
<i>- Post office?
- Yes.</i>

22
00:15:25,712 --> 00:15:26,996
Where are you from?

23
00:15:27,297 --> 00:15:28,297
- Where I am from?
- Yeah.

24
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:30,750
- Albania.
- Oh, are you?

25
00:15:31,051 --> 00:15:32,335
- You have family here?
- Yes.

26
00:15:32,636 --> 00:15:33,795
Oh, you do.

27
00:15:34,096 --> 00:15:37,006
That's the reason I'm saying
you have to go another way...

28
00:15:37,307 --> 00:15:38,925
for another-

29
00:15:39,226 --> 00:15:41,562
It's after the shopping ce-

30
00:16:04,376 --> 00:16:06,119
- Hi.
- Lost?

31
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,121
- Yeah, lost.
- What are you looking for?

32
00:16:08,422 --> 00:16:10,915
- I'm looking for the M8.
- Up to the roundabout-

33
00:16:11,216 --> 00:16:12,667
- Are you walking?
- Yep.

34
00:16:12,968 --> 00:16:14,752
- Where are you walking to?
- Home.

35
00:16:15,053 --> 00:16:17,755
- Oh, you're going home. To your family?
- No, no, just myself.

36
00:16:18,056 --> 00:16:19,882
- Just yourself?
- Aye. It's great.

37
00:16:20,183 --> 00:16:23,303
- Yeah? How?
- I can do whatever I like.

38
00:16:23,604 --> 00:16:26,139
- So where are you coming from?
- Govan. Right there.

39
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,640
- Sorry?
- Govan.

40
00:16:27,941 --> 00:16:30,810
- Govan? Do you work there?
- No, no.

41
00:16:31,111 --> 00:16:33,313
Don't work there. I work for myself.

42
00:16:33,614 --> 00:16:37,117
- Do you want a lift?
- Eh-Aye, why not?

43
00:16:43,957 --> 00:16:46,326
You'll have to tell me how to get there.

44
00:16:46,627 --> 00:16:49,171
- Just follow this road straight up.
- Okay.

45
00:16:50,297 --> 00:16:51,581
Sure.

46
00:16:51,882 --> 00:16:53,833
- So what do you do?
- Electrician.

47
00:16:54,134 --> 00:16:55,636
Oh, you're an electrician.

48
00:16:58,472 --> 00:17:00,840
- It's cold, right?
- It's a wee bit nippy, aye.

49
00:17:01,141 --> 00:17:03,101
Yeah.

50
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:05,261
So what is it youse all doing?

51
00:17:05,562 --> 00:17:07,347
I'm-I'm just, driving-

52
00:17:07,648 --> 00:17:11,976
just... some furniture
for my family and-

53
00:17:12,277 --> 00:17:14,354
- Oh, right?
- Yeah.

54
00:17:14,655 --> 00:17:16,064
So you live alone?

55
00:17:16,365 --> 00:17:17,649
- Yes.
- And you love it?

56
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:20,860
- Aye. it's great.
- What do you love about living alone?

57
00:17:21,161 --> 00:17:23,571
- Nobody to nag you.
- Do I go straight through?

58
00:17:23,872 --> 00:17:27,167
Yeah, just straight through.
Straight through the whole way.

59
00:18:00,158 --> 00:18:03,528
It should be just cart around that street
and stay in the right hand lane.

60
00:18:03,829 --> 00:18:05,988
- What's that?
- That's a tattoo of my name.

61
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:07,448
- Of your name?
- Yeah.

62
00:18:07,749 --> 00:18:08,789
- What's your name?
- Andy.

63
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:10,321
- Andy. Hi.
- Pleased to meet you.

64
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:12,954
- Nice to meet you too.
- Thank you very much.

65
00:18:13,255 --> 00:18:15,081
Andy!

66
00:18:15,382 --> 00:18:16,717
- Want me?
- You coming?

67
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,924
The spot back here, you get-
you put your hand out. Anybody can stop.

68
00:18:25,225 --> 00:18:27,552
There's lonely old guys. Know what I mean?

69
00:18:27,853 --> 00:18:31,139
It was-Hey, might as well check her out,
driving away in a big van.

70
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,609
Sure you can drive this, huh? Huh?

71
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:41,190
- No girlfriend? Really?
- Nah, I don't have a girlfriend at all.

72
00:18:41,491 --> 00:18:43,660
You're very charming.

73
00:18:47,914 --> 00:18:49,416
That's better.

74
00:18:50,834 --> 00:18:53,003
Yeah? Sorted?

75
00:18:54,004 --> 00:18:55,788
- You have a handsome face.
- Aye?

76
00:18:56,089 --> 00:18:58,416
- Yeah.
- Thanks a lot. Cheers.

77
00:18:58,717 --> 00:19:01,043
- Do you think I'm pretty?
- I think you're gorgeous.

78
00:19:01,344 --> 00:19:03,430
- Do you?
- Aye, definitely.

79
00:19:04,097 --> 00:19:05,599
Good.

80
00:19:08,477 --> 00:19:10,261
And a friendly smile as well.

81
00:19:10,562 --> 00:19:12,138
- Do I?
- Aye, right deep.

82
00:19:12,439 --> 00:19:14,474
- What about your smile?
- Aye.

83
00:19:14,775 --> 00:19:15,975
You've a nice smile yourself.

84
00:19:16,276 --> 00:19:18,394
- Cheers.
- Good.

85
00:19:18,695 --> 00:19:20,280
Good.

86
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,150
No, no, no, lads! No!

87
00:22:58,164 --> 00:23:01,001
Mommy!

88
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,635
I thought...

89
00:24:01,936 --> 00:24:03,471
you had your eye on my towel.

90
00:24:03,772 --> 00:24:05,473
No. I wanted to speak to you.

91
00:24:05,774 --> 00:24:08,234
Do you know if there's any good spots
to surf around here?

92
00:24:09,235 --> 00:24:10,644
I'm not a surfer.

93
00:24:10,945 --> 00:24:12,772
Just living in a little tent over there.

94
00:24:13,073 --> 00:24:15,483
- Just hanging around.
- Yeah?

95
00:24:15,784 --> 00:24:18,953
- Reading, swimming.
- You're not from here? Where are you from?

96
00:24:20,663 --> 00:24:23,792
- I'm from Czech Republic.
- Why are you in Scotland?

97
00:24:26,127 --> 00:24:28,370
I just... wanted to get away from it all.

98
00:24:28,671 --> 00:24:30,623
Yeah? Why here?

99
00:24:30,924 --> 00:24:32,416
Because it's-

100
00:24:32,717 --> 00:24:34,219
It's nowhere.

101
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:08,473
Excuse me.

102
00:33:08,774 --> 00:33:10,809
Can I talk to you
before you run away, darling?

103
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:13,366
I wanted to speak to you earlier,
right, but you disappeared.

104
00:33:13,446 --> 00:33:16,064
I thought you went to the ladies'
or somethin'.

105
00:33:16,365 --> 00:33:19,526
Anyway, right,
fuck all that shite. Right?

106
00:33:19,827 --> 00:33:22,529
I really want to buy you a drink, man.
You look absolutely stunning.

107
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,156
And I-

108
00:33:24,457 --> 00:33:27,534
You know what?
I'm all alone. You're all alone.

109
00:33:27,835 --> 00:33:29,745
What do you say? What's one drink?

110
00:33:30,046 --> 00:33:31,330
What's one drink?

111
00:33:31,631 --> 00:33:34,082
- I saw you on the road.
- What, you saw <i>me</i> on the road?

112
00:33:34,383 --> 00:33:36,918
- Earlier, yeah.
- Are you having a laugh with me?

113
00:33:37,219 --> 00:33:39,421
You saw me?
You wanna come get a drink and a dance?

114
00:33:39,722 --> 00:33:42,475
- Are you alone here?
- Yeah, I'm all alone. Right?

115
00:39:09,301 --> 00:39:13,389
The man from the car,
he buy the rose for you.

116

Fuckin' hell, you're gorgeous.

142
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:03,642
- You think so?
- It's your eyes.

143
00:42:04,935 --> 00:42:07,062
Somethin' about your eyes.

144
00:42:08,147 --> 00:42:10,557
Your eyes, your lips.

145
00:42:10,858 --> 00:42:12,860
- That black hair.
- Yeah?

146
00:42:16,029 --> 00:42:17,823
You just look...

147
00:42:19,032 --> 00:42:20,534
amazing.

148
00:45:31,266 --> 00:45:33,018
Hey, you okay?

149
00:45:41,276 --> 00:45:44,363
Want a hand up? Want a hand?

150
00:49:29,212 --> 00:49:31,590
Get out, eh? Get out!

151
00:51:13,274 --> 00:51:14,693
Excuse me.

152
00:51:16,111 --> 00:51:17,228
Excuse me.

153
00:51:17,529 --> 00:51:20,231
I'm a bit lost, really.

154
00:51:20,532 --> 00:51:22,534
Am I headed towards Taynuilt?

155
00:51:23,702 --> 00:51:24,527
Yeah.

156
00:51:24,828 --> 00:51:27,446
I am? Is it far?

157
00:51:27,747 --> 00:51:29,615
It's about 10 minutes away.

158
00:51:29,916 --> 00:51:32,210
Ten minutes?
Are you-Are you headed there?

159
00:51:33,086 --> 00:51:34,537
I'm going to the supermarket.

160
00:51:34,838 --> 00:51:36,673
Is it on the way?

161
00:51:40,218 --> 00:51:41,544
Yeah.

162
00:51:41,845 --> 00:51:44,055
I could drop you off if you'd like.

163
00:51:49,769 --> 00:51:51,813
Yeah?

164
00:52:20,508 --> 00:52:23,261
Here. Let me turn this up for you.

165
00:52:31,853 --> 00:52:33,646
That's better.

166
00:52:48,953 --> 00:52:50,622
You're very quiet.

167
00:52:56,503 --> 00:52:59,089
So why do you shop at night then?

168
00:53:03,343 --> 00:53:05,011
People wind me up.

169
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:08,431
How?

170
00:53:10,683 --> 00:53:12,519
They're ignorant.

171
00:53:16,106 --> 00:53:18,483
What about your friends?

172
00:53:21,736 --> 00:53:23,905
So you don't have any friends?

173
00:53:29,035 --> 00:53:30,286
No.

174
00:53:31,246 --> 00:53:32,997
How about a girlfriend?

175
00:53:39,379 --> 00:53:40,964
How old are you?

176
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:44,092
I'm 26.

177
00:53:45,718 --> 00:53:48,847
When was the last time
you had a girlfriend?

178
00:53:51,391 --> 00:53:53,050
Never had one.

179
00:53:53,351 --> 00:53:55,228
So don't you get lonely then?

180
00:54:02,694 --> 00:54:04,362
You've very nice hands.

181
00:54:09,659 --> 00:54:11,369
You've beautiful hands.

182
00:54:33,308 --> 00:54:35,259
Do you want to look at me?

183
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:38,188
- This isn't Tesco's, is it?
- No.

184
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:46,905
I noticed you looking at me before.

185
00:54:52,577 --> 00:54:53,745
And?

186
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:57,415
I liked it.

187
00:55:02,003 --> 00:55:03,954
You're uncomfortable.

188
00:55:04,255 --> 00:55:06,883
No. Just want to go to Tesco's.

189
00:55:13,181 --> 00:55:15,767
So you never think about it then?

190
00:55:18,603 --> 00:55:20,146
Think about what?

191
00:55:21,522 --> 00:55:23,608
Being with a girl.

192
00:55:29,614 --> 00:55:31,616
When was the last time
you touched someone?

193
00:55:44,462 --> 00:55:46,422
Let me see your hands.

194
00:55:53,471 --> 00:55:54,973
Cold.

195
00:55:58,142 --> 00:55:59,978
I have to get back soon.

196
00:56:11,072 --> 00:56:13,074
How was that?

197
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:15,285
Cold.

198
00:56:18,663 --> 00:56:20,698
Do you want to do it again?

199
00:56:20,999 --> 00:56:22,959
Yeah.

200
00:56:30,925 --> 00:56:33,043
Do you want to touch my neck?

201
00:56:33,344 --> 00:56:34,846
Here.

202
00:56:43,438 --> 00:56:45,565
How was that?

203
00:56:47,233 --> 00:56:48,901
Yeah.

204
00:56:50,486 --> 00:56:52,613
Your hands are very soft.

205
00:57:00,288 --> 00:57:03,166
I have a place about 30 minutes away.

206
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:06,711
Will you come with me there?

207
00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:07,054
Cold.

208
00:58:07,355 --> 00:58:09,690
I won't let that stop us.

209
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:30,962
Come to me.

210
00:58:46,394 --> 00:58:48,137
Dreaming?

211
00:58:48,438 --> 00:58:49,513
Yes.

212
00:58:49,814 --> 00:58:51,265
Dreaming?

213
00:58:51,566 --> 00:58:53,234
Yes, we are.

214
01:09:52,434 --> 01:09:55,437
The bus will be along in a minute.

215
01:10:51,034 --> 01:10:53,415
Do you not think you should
be wearing a jacket, little lass?

216
01:10:53,495 --> 01:10:55,572
The weather's terrible up here.

217
01:10:55,873 --> 01:11:00,085
You'll catch your death of cold if you've
not got a jacket or a hat or something on.

218
01:11:03,297 --> 01:11:05,799
You've not got the right clothes on at all.

219
01:11:13,390 --> 01:11:15,309
You all right there?

220
01:11:17,644 --> 01:11:19,229
Eh?

221
01:11:20,355 --> 01:11:22,024
You okay?

222
01:11:27,196 --> 01:11:28,438
Can I do something for you?

223
01:11:28,739 --> 01:11:30,940
Chase yourself, dafty.

224
01:11:31,241 --> 01:11:34,578
Leave the lassie alone.
She doesn't want anything to do with you.

225
01:11:43,170 --> 01:11:45,297
Do you need any help?

226
01:11:56,266 --> 01:11:57,726
Yes.

227
01:12:04,274 --> 01:12:05,776
Right.

228
01:13:59,139 --> 01:14:01,141
Let me just take your coat.

229
01:14:27,751 --> 01:14:29,753
<i>Spoon, Jar. Jar, spoon.</i>

230
01:14:32,005 --> 01:14:34,290
<i>Spoon, Jar. Jar-
Wonder whether that's working, don't you?</i>

231
01:14:34,591 --> 01:14:35,875
<i>Spoon, Jar. Jar, spoon.</i>

232
01:14:36,176 --> 01:14:37,543
<i>Spoon, Jar. Jar, spoon.</i>

233
01:14:37,844 --> 01:14:39,930
<i>Spoon, Jar.
Spoon, Jar. Jar, spoon.</i>

234
01:14:46,186 --> 01:14:47,813
<i>Stop!</i>

235
01:14:51,274 --> 01:14:53,443
<i>Stop!</i>

236
01:14:54,736 --> 01:14:56,071
<i>Pull it. Pull it.</i>

237
01:16:22,991 --> 01:16:24,701
Night.

238
01:20:41,124 --> 01:20:42,751
You all right?

239
01:20:48,089 --> 01:20:50,759
If you're frightened, let's go.

240
01:20:57,098 --> 01:20:58,433
Come on.

241
01:20:59,768 --> 01:21:01,895
It's all right.

242
01:21:03,188 --> 01:21:04,856
That's it.

243
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:44,521
It's okay. It's okay.

244
01:21:56,950 --> 01:21:58,827
It's okay.

245
01:22:00,161 --> 01:22:01,913
It's okay.

246
01:22:07,210 --> 01:22:09,045
All right.

247
01:22:12,382 --> 01:22:13,958
Okay.

248
01:22:14,259 --> 01:22:15,918
You did it.

249
01:22:16,219 --> 01:22:17,887
You did it.

250
01:26:30,848 --> 01:26:32,183
You all right?

251
01:28:38,851 --> 01:28:41,720
You just off for a ramble
in the woods then? Eh?

252
01:28:42,021 --> 01:28:44,306
- Huh?
- You just off for a ramble in the woods?

253
01:28:44,607 --> 01:28:48,185
Yeah, yeah? Oh, it's...
Watch how you step here. It's a bit,

254
01:28:48,486 --> 01:28:51,229
it's a bit slippery round here,
but-this time of year.

255
01:28:51,530 --> 01:28:55,817
It's all right in summer. Well, it's still
wet in summer, but not as bad as it is now.

256
01:28:56,118 --> 01:28:58,320
But there's plenty of trails around here.

257
01:28:58,621 --> 01:29:00,030
Have you been here before?

258
01:29:00,331 --> 01:29:01,782
No? First time? Yeah?

259
01:29:02,083 --> 01:29:04,159
Oh, you won't get lost.
They're all clearly marked.

260
01:29:04,460 --> 01:29:07,412
But, there's about 2,000 acres
of forest here...

261
01:29:07,713 --> 01:29:11,541
so you shouldn't-you should have,
plenty of places to go in there.

262
01:29:11,842 --> 01:29:13,293
- You on your own?
- Yeah.

263
01:29:13,594 --> 01:29:17,839
Yeah, on your own? Oh, well, it's a nice
place if you want some solitude...

264
01:29:18,140 --> 01:29:21,885
you know, to “gather your thoughts”
and all that, yeah?

265
01:29:22,186 --> 01:29:25,022
- So, enjoy yourself anyway, okay?
- Thank you.
