1
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:06,835
Brought him back from town with
me, he used to work at the Griffin Bank.

2
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:11,256
- Well, that ought to be useful.
- Yeah, helped me do a layout of the town.

3
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,344
Well.

4
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,513
Is this the bank?

5
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,974
- Sheriff's office on down the street.
- Over here, eh?

6
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:24,561
And does this alley go
all the way out of town?

7
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,103
Yeah.

8
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:32,611
Well, you did a good job
Ira. I feel like I live there.

9
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:35,113
After we hit that bank,
they'll be glad you don't Sam.

10
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,156
Sam Ward?

11
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,912
Do we need him anymore?

12
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,874
I'll be going then.

13
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:55,801
All right boys, get your horses.

14
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:02,891
- Oh Ira, did you find the Keliher place?
- Yeah, it's up at the head of Clear Creek.

15
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:07,354
- Oh, seven, eight hour ride maybe.
- You sure that Keliher is there?

16
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,857
- Yeah, he's there all right.
- Good.

17
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,085
I'll just pay him a little social
visit when the job is finished.

18
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,113
Meet you back
at the hideout, eh?

19
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:17,781
- Oh Sam?
- Yeah?

20
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:22,077
- How long going to be?
- Just long enough to kill Logan Keliher.

21
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,210
- Logan.
- Yes?

22
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,505
- Have you seen Sammy?
- He's helping me.

23
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,592
- I think.
- All right.

24
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,346
Here, let me give you a hand.

25
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,611
You seem awfully
anxious to help.

26
00:03:57,279 --> 00:04:01,283
- We're going to town, aren't we?
- Who said anything about we?

27
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,746
- It's a long trip, I could help you drive.
- Yeah?

28
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:09,291
Well, you talk your
mother about it?

29
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:14,713
- She, she doesn't really care.
- But she did say you couldn't go.

30
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:21,011
- Did she say why?
- She thought I'd be a bother to you.

31
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:27,309
- But I won't be, I promise I won't.
- Well, I tell you what. You've...

32
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,853
been a big help to me
getting ready and everything.

33
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,374
Maybe I'll just have a
little talk with your mother.

34
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,775
Thanks Dad.

35
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:40,530
Susan...

36
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:44,785
you know, I don't know if I'm up to making
this long drive all by myself or not and...

37
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,454
Sammy is offered to go.

38
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,666
- Yes, we discussed before.
- He'd be a lot of help.

39
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,312
Thought you have
enough to worry about.

40
00:04:56,922 --> 00:05:01,718
Town is such a treat for a little kid, even
Griffin after living out here all this time.

41
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,932
Looks like I'm outvoted. All
right Sammy, put your jacket on.

42
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,519
We'll be back sometime tomorrow.

43
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,638
Hope you don't mind both
your men being gone overnight.

44
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,732
Somebody has to
hold down the fort.

45
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:20,362
I hope everything
goes all right in town.

46
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:24,741
We don't want move
again, do we Sammy?

47
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,536
Don't worry, we won't.

48
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,460
And what about the money?

49
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,797
- How can you raise...
- I'll manage.

50
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,804
Come on Dad, let's go.

51
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,227
Told you he'd be a lot of help.

52
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:00,777
Now you be a good boy.

53
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:05,865
Let's go.

54
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,161
Come on.

55
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,441
- Like to do something for me?
- Yes sir?

56
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,485
You take this list over to
Fishman's store and ask him to fill it.

57
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,946
- You wait for me there.
- All right Dad.

58
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,911
- Sammy?
- Yes sir?

59
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,872
- You like have a licorice stick?
- Sure would.

60
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,297
Tell me Mr. Fishman
I said it'd be all right.

61
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,714
Sorry mister.

62
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:27,113
- Farmer is in town.
- It's not even Saturday night.

63
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,706
- I'm looking for Goldie.
- Oh, she's upstairs.

64
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,711
Oh, hello Keliher, ain't seen
you in town in some time.

65
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:46,007
- Hello Diggs.
- Well, now that you're here...

66
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,444
maybe you'd like to
have drink with me.

67
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:54,933
- You buying?
- Oh well no, I was kind of hoping you would.

68
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:57,811
I'm sorry old timer.

69
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:01,856
I'm afraid farming hasn't been much
more profitable than buffalo hunting.

70
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,734
Them two bumming
each other for drinks...

71
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,266
it's a good way for both of
them to stay sober, hey Pink?

72
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:15,829
Come on farmer, I'll buy you
a drink. Barkeep, set them up..

73
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,834
- There Diggs, you have mine.
- I'm not too proud.

74
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:25,463
Jeff said he wanted
to buy you a drink.

75
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,468
- I didn't refuse him.
- Then drink it.

76
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,264
Pull in your horns Pink.

77
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,435
Logan is drinking with me.

78
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,440
You will join me?

79
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:48,862
- As long as you saved my hide Goldie.
- Pink doesn't know you as well as I do.

80
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:50,904
Joe.

81
00:08:56,911 --> 00:09:00,457
He's the best gun-hand in Griffin,
SO I hire him, doesn't mean I like him.

82
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,918
- Kind of a pushy kid with him.
- Jeff?

83
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:08,715
When Pink is cold, Jeff sneezes. He'll
learn better, if he lives long enough.

84
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,679
You've been mighty scarce
since you moved here to Griffin.

85
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,558
- Farm keeps a man busy.
- Farming?

86
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,353
Somehow that just
doesn't seem your style.

87
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:26,274
You changed a lot since the
old days down on the border.

88
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,527
Look different without
that 45 strapped to you.

89
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,866
- Have to admit I miss it now and then.
- Got everybody around here fooled.

90
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,499
Remember the last time
we had a drink together?

91
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,037
Del Rio.

92
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,207
You were with the
Texas Rangers then.

93
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:46,211
- I thought you'd come in to shut me down.
- No, no.

94
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:48,338
I had other fish
to fry that night.

95
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:53,927
- Another one?
- This is not exactly a social call Goldie.

96
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,348
I'm flat broke.

97
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:03,061
- Oh?
- I owe the bank $500 on that place of mine.

98
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,105
That's a lot of money Logan.

99
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,649
I know that, that's
why I came to you.

100
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,493
Well, I don't carry that
much money with me.

101
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:11,778
- Wouldn't...
- Goldie...

102
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,447
just tell me, yes or no?

103
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,451
- You wouldn't say it, would you?
- Say what?

104
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:20,954
I haven't forgotten Logan.

105
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:25,125
You did me a good turn once but you'd
never mention when you're in trouble.

106
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,974
I expect to get this back.

107
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,437
I expect you will.

108
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,853
You're too late mister.
The bank is closed.

109
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,856
I know they're closed,
but they're still in there.

110
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,861
We're closed.
Come back tomorrow.

111
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:38,281
I told you, them bankers
sure got it soft, ain't they?

112
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:40,241
Most of us have
got to work till dark.

113
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,920
- Idiot.
- Somebody looked in the window.

114
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:55,298
- All right, get going.
- Sheriff, Sheriff Moore.

115
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,637
Let them draw them off.

116
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,141
They're robbing the bank,
help. They're robbing the bank.

117
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:53,689
Sam.

118
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:06,536
Who wants to ride in the posse?

119
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,292
Logan?

120
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,841
Logan, is that you?

121
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,177
Sam.

122
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:54,727
- Where is he?
- He's not here.

123
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,825
Well.

124
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,579
Let me take a good
look at you Susan girl.

125
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,332
Been a long time, hasn't it?

126
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,197
You haven't changed a bit,
you look even better than ever.

127
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:22,422
- You're wounded.
- Oh, it's nothing, don't worry about it.

128
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:26,717
- Let me bandage it for you.
- Well, all right.

129
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,221
You always were a
good nurse Susan.

130
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,225
A good wife too,
for that matter.

131
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:05,631
- Our boy, our son is with Logan?
- Yes.

132
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:07,675
Six years.

133
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:13,556
- Guess he's not a baby anymore, is he?
- No, he's a big boy now.

134
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,560
I was hoping to see him.

135
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,982
Sam, he doesn't
know you're his father.

136
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:27,195
Well, he will, soon enough.

137
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,113
Try to understand Sam.

138
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:34,494
- Everything is different now.
- Nothing is different Susan, not with me.

139
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,918
SO Logan left you all alone, eh?

140
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:46,047
Well he, he ought to
know better than that.

141
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:50,843
A beautiful woman like you shouldn't
be all by herself like that, it's not safe.

142
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:55,681
- And that's how I lost you, remember?
- You can't really believe that.

143
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,975
Well, it's true, isn't it?

144
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:01,145
A little sweet talk from Logan
when my back was turned and...

145
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,774
well, you just got a
little mixed up honey.

146
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,693
Sam, you went
away to prison, for life.

147
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,780
You knew they weren't
going to keep me there.

148
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:15,618
Couple years and I'd had enough,
came out looking for my wife.

149
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,412
Sam, I'm not your wife.

150
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:22,500
- You knew about the divorce.
- Well now, we won't worry about that.

151
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,877
Look, I understand honey.

152
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:29,173
This, this thing with Logan
was just a, a handy way out...

153
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,634
for you while I was gone.

154
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,178
Logan had nothing to do with it.

155
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:38,891
Sam, our marriage was through when you
first started making your way with a gun.

156
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,479
Logan took you when
I was behind bars.

157
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:45,731
When I couldn't fight for you.

158
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:49,777
Well, I'm out now and
I'm taking you back.

159
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,406
- It's finished between us.
- Is it Susan?

160
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,951
Let's see if it is.

161
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:35,114
Well Logan is...

162
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,783
Logan is got a stronger
hold on you than I figured.

163
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:46,500
- Too bad we don't have more time.
- There'll never be time, not for us.

164
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:50,171
You'll come around
Susan, when Logan is dead.

165
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:56,135
I'll be back, you can
count on that, honey.

166
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:36,550
- He was here.
- Yes.

167
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:41,013
We drove all night,
I'll put him to bed.

168
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:10,918
- He came here to kill you.
- Somehow I never really believed he'd try.

169
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,170
He said he'd be back.

170
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:17,091
We've got to move Logan, we've got to
go some place where he'll never find us.

171
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,592
NO use running.

172
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,555
Besides, I just paid the bank.

173
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,558
We can't stay here now.

174
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:30,604
He's coming back to kill
you and to take Sammy.

175
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,524
He found us here,
he'd find us anywhere.

176
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,493
Best chance is to see he's
caught and sent back to prison.

177
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,830
Can't they get him without you?

178
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,916
Who knows him as well as I do?

179
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,967
I was praying you'd never
have to use that gun again.

180
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,053
I know.

181
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,192
I hope you don't
have to kill him.

182
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,904
Is the last thing I want to do.

183
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,033
Logan.

184
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,913
Don't take any chances.

185
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:33,000
I don't want you to kill him,
but if it has to be you or him...

186
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,336
If it comes to that.

187
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,130
I want you to come back.

188
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,801
Oh, I want you to come back.

189
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,589
You fellas shoot, then
ask questions later, en?

190
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:05,426
- We was certain you was ward.
- I'm sorry to disappoint you.

191
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,345
Say, I've had enough of this
anyway, let's head back for town.

192
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:09,763
What's the matter Leach?

193
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,892
Beginning to wish you were back
at the saloon, throwing out drunks?

194
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,643
You'd better lay off.

195
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:18,480
You must be part of Sheriff
Moore's handpicked posse.

196
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,150
Yeah, we are what are
you doing out here all alone?

197
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,027
Where's the rest of
the posse Tucker?

198
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:27,114
We lost the trail, the sheriff split
us up into bunches to cut sign.

199
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:31,452
This tracking is supposed to
be your long suit, isn't it Diggs?

200
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:35,998
I've tracked a sight of them
but this fella ward is might tricky.

201
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:40,252
- Did you know was Sam Ward we was after?
- Yeah, I knew.

202
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:44,131
- I'd like to come up against him.
- Maybe you'll get a chance.

203
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:48,177
Keliher, you never did say
what you was doing way out here.

204
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,346
I was trailing Sam ward.

205
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:07,404
- That ain't Ward's horse.
- No, I'm riding Ward's horse, he stole mine.

206
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:11,575
Funny thing he just
happened to stop by your place.

207
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:13,786
Isn't funny to me.

208
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,671
Good way to get a
bullet in you Lottie.

209
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:31,756
Something went wrong.

210
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,219
Well, not altogether.

211
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:47,314
- What happened to the others?
- They won't be back.

212
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,399
My man, Ira...

213
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:54,071
- What about him?
- He got killed in the getaway.

214
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,329
I want his share of that money.

215
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:06,208
You sure do come right to
the point, don't you baby eh?

216
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:27,855
Well? How about it?

217
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:33,193
- About what?
- About the money.

218
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:36,321
I want Ira's share,
it's mine now.

219
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:40,284
Well, you might be selling
out too cheap, Lottie girl.

220
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,410
On?

221
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,122
You got something else in mind?

222
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,419
Ah, maybe.

223
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,380
Just how much did you get?

224
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:59,219
Enough for you and me to blow
the town of El Paso wide open.

225
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:01,137
El Paso?

226
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:05,183
El Paso.

227
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,104
Yeah, I think I'd
like that just fine.

228
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:13,033
- Won't take me any time to get ready.
- No, no, no, hold on, hold on.

229
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:16,945
Let's spend a couple of
days getting acquainted, eh?

230
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:21,533
Yeah, you're not a bad
looking woman Lottie.

231
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:26,108
Doll you up a little bit there, why you
could hold your own with most any company.

232
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:31,418
Oh, I bet you know how
to spend money Sam.

233
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:35,923
Well, now I'll tell you.

234
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:41,637
- I never been able to save any.
- You know something?

235
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:46,600
Ira told me I was going to like you
when he talked me into coming up here.

236
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:52,605
Was he right?-

237
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:58,862
Well, you didn't grieve
very long, did you?

238
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,949
About as long as he
would've grieved for me.

239
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,534
Yeah, I like that.

240
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,080
You know, a man will always know
where he stands with you Lottie.

241
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:39,695
Couldn't trail a herd of buffaloes
through this kind of going.

242
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,702
You think there's any
point in looking further?

243
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,284
As long we've gone this far.

244
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:48,453
I say we're wasting
our time, let's turn back.

245
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:50,866
How about you and Jeff Pink?

246
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:54,084
Well, town would look pretty
good to me right about now.

247
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:57,421
Me too, I've had a
bellyful of this riding blind.

248
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,903
I'm afraid I'll have to agree,
we might as well call it quits.

249
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:02,675
Diggs...

250
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,355
you know this country
real well, don't you?

251
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:07,097
Better than most.

252
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:10,726
All right, let's say you're
an outlaw on the run.

253
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:13,645
Where's the one place
you wouldn't go from here?

254
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,479
Right up there.

255
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:18,525
Why not?

256
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,069
Because nothing there
but rocks and rattlesnakes.

257
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,697
Unless maybe you want to
count them murdering Apaches.

258
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,408
They hole up back
in there after a raid.

259
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:29,411
Sounds like just the kind
of a place Ward would pick.

260
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:34,166
- That be just a wild goose chase.
- Then why don't you go back?

261
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:39,755
Because you're too anxious, think
I'll just string along, just in case.

262
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,078
I wish they had gone back.

263
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:14,748
If they have left, there have
been fewer of us to split the money.

264
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:18,001
Worry about the reward
after we catch him.

265
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:21,380
I wasn't thinking
about the reward.

266
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:06,508
I think I'll wear
my hair piled high.

267
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,595
Maybe an ostrich plume.

268
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:14,516
And a red satin dress.

269
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:18,019
Oh yeah, I look good in
red, you like red Sam, eh?

270
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:21,481
- Sam.
- Yeah.

271
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:27,362
Oh, you'll be proud of me.
Red satin, hair up and silk.

272
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:30,240
Nothing but silk
next to my body.

273
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:33,535
- Oh, I love the feel of silk.
- Yeah, so do I.

274
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:38,832
Hold it Sam.

275
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,545
Hey, you took me...

276
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:49,509
by surprise Logan, I didn't have that
much luck when I came looking for you.

277
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:51,803
About the unluckiest
thing you ever did.

278
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:59,769
- Now stay over there.
- It's all right Lottie, it's me he wants.

279
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:02,772
I'll make a deal with you Logan.

280
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,001
You're not exactly in a
position to make a deal.

281
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:06,025
Give me my gun.

282
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,737
We'll settle this between
us right here and now.

283
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:11,615
- No.
- You owe me that much.

284
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:15,452
- I don't owe you anything Sam.
- Give me my gun.

285
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:20,207
Look, one of us will walk out of
here and that'll be the end of it.

286
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:25,587
That be easy for you, you
don't have anything to lose. I do.

287
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,217
Turn around.

288
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,389
Lean your head against the wall.

289
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,351
Let's see them.

290
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:41,353
What about me?

291
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,898
For now you might
stir up a pot of coffee.

292
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,858
Look, I didn't do anything.

293
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,945
I was just waiting here for them
to come back, now that's no crime.

294
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:51,863
We'll let the law decide that.

295
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:56,993
- Watch that arm, I took a slug in it.
- I know, I put it there.

296
00:33:58,078 --> 00:34:01,039
You were in Griffin?
I wish I had seen you.

297
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:04,960
I saw you plain enough after my
first bullet dropped you, now sit down.

298
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,506
Why didn't you shoot me again?

299
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,759
Ah, you felt guilty.

300
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:17,931
Sure, you felt guilty about
stealing my wife and kid.

301
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,223
No.

302
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:20,725
We were friends once Sam.

303
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:24,062
- It's not easy to shoot an old friend.
- Friends?

304
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:29,693
That's a long way back Logan, and
I've got one big advantage over you.

305
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,821
You won't kill me
unless you have to.

306
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:36,491
I won't hesitate one
second about killing you.

307
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:44,040
- So you got him all by yourself.
- Good going Keliher.

308
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:49,713
- Man can't have no privacy anywhere.
- Hey Pink, look what we got here.

309
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,633
Turn around honey,
let's have a look at you.

310
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,468
I said turn around.

311
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,223
Say, you're a looker, eh?

312
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,740
You can keep my share of the
reward fellas, I'll take this instead.

313
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:08,815
- Take your hands off of me.
- Leave her alone.

314
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:11,943
- What is to you?
- I said leave her alone.

315
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:14,696
You giving the orders
from now on Keliher?

316
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:17,115
I'm giving the orders.

317
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:20,744
- How come?
- After all, he took ward.

318
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,664
Yeah, that's right, he did.

319
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,126
All right Jeff, leave her alone.

320
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:33,798
Did you find the money?

321
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:37,469
I didn't even look for it,
figured I have plenty of help.

322
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,014
You found ward easy enough.

323
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:46,227
- I'll make him tell where it is.
- You make me tell?

324
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:56,321
- You won't get it out of him like that.
- I'll bet she knows where is hid.

325
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:59,032
- No.
- She knows, all right.

326
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,647
Just give me a minute with her.

327
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:03,554
What's the matter with you fellas
anyway, talking about torturing people?

328
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,121
The money can't
be that hard to find.

329
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,958
- Well, ain't back there.
- Maybe hid it outside.

330
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:10,752
Let's start looking for it then.

331
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,255
Hey old timer, come here.

332
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,551
You better protect
your interest, eh?

333
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:26,643
They're sure anxious
about that bank money.

334
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,646
Yeah, too anxious.

335
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,150
I'm sure glad
you're along Tucker.

336
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:37,112
I'll do what I can.

337
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,409
You got enough
to feed this bunch?

338
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:45,537
Then start fixing.

339
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,584
I have to get wood.

340
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:55,462
Go ahead.

341
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:04,264
- You wasting time Sam.
- Oh, I'm in no hurry.

342
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,308
My chances are looking
better by the minute.

343
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:10,937
I'd say your chances are mighty slim
unless you say where the money is.

344
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:14,232
- You want them to beat it out of you?
- I'm not worried Logan.

345
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:19,446
As long I got you here to protect
me, from those honest citizens.

346
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:28,288
It's in the fireplace,
the fireplace.

347
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:31,583
- I said I could make her talk.
- Leach...

348
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:37,732
- I see you found it.
- He almost got away.

349
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:39,984
- How much you get?
- I don't know yet.

350
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,445
Come on, we'll give
you a hand with it.

351
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,782
I was hoping that fight out there
would've lasted a little longer.

352
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:49,494
- So I noticed.
- That's sweet bunch you got there.

353
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:53,498
- I didn't pick them.
- Well, maybe you should've boy.

354
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:55,792
More than 20,000.

355
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:59,128
I don't think I've ever seen
that much in one pile before.

356
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,881
This would buy a high
old time back in Griffin.

357
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:04,968
Boys, boys...

358
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:07,265
There's no reason you
shouldn't keep that money.

359
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:11,182
Why sure, let, let me go...

360
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:15,311
and nobody back in Griffin ever need
know that you found me or the money.

361
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,148
That's kind of an
interesting thought.

362
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,776
Yeah, it's worth
considering all right.

363
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:27,156
There's only one thing wrong
with it, we can't trust you.

364
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,660
Now if you were dead,
we'd be home free.

365
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:33,973
We could tell them back in
Griffin that we had to Kill...

366
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:35,790
ward and that we
couldn't find the money.

367
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,298
- What about her?
- She'd tell the whole thing.

368
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:41,379
We'll get rid of her too.

369
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:47,093
Hold on, killing ward is one thing
but I ain't for murdering no woman.

370
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,435
You don't have to
do it, I'll take care of it.

371
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:52,056
I killed many a squaw Indian
fighting, 'Tain't no different.

372
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:55,935
That money is going back to
Griffin, these two are going with it.

373
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:59,397
I don't think you can
stop us, we've got Diggs.

374
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:03,506
Now Jeff here is a little squeamish but when
it comes right down to it, he'll back me.

375
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:08,364
- You might have Tucker on your side.
- Of course I stand behind Keliher.

376
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,995
That's cold blooded
murder you're talking about.

377
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:13,161
Well, I kind of figured
you'd see it that way.

378
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:17,415
Leach, I don't imagine
you're quite so high minded.

379
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:19,625
Sure ain't.

380
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:23,421
You like the odds?

381
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:28,301
We got callers, Apaches.

382
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:38,561
Most likely scouts
for a raiding party.

383
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,741
We can make a mighty
tempting target there.

384
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,534
- Let's get them before they get away.
- No.

385
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,277
You shoot and be a war
party down here no time.

386
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:47,973
We can't just
wait till they hit.

387
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,909
Afraid you're right, turn
this place into a graveyard.

388
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:58,096
I think we better start act like
we don't know they're out there.

389
00:40:58,498 --> 00:41:00,083
And after dark
can try slip away.

390
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,568
You think he's right about
that Apache war party?

391
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:12,011
When you go, leave me here.

392
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:18,393
I'd as soon take my chances with
those Apaches as with this bunch.

393
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:23,314
Not a very good
bet either way Sam.

394
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:55,868
Tie my hands in front here,
will you? I can ride a lot better.

395
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:58,325
Yeah and you can grab a gun
a lot better too, couldn't you?

396
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,226
Why Logan, you know
me better than that.

397
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:04,230
- I'll take my own horse back.
- Oh, I thought was a fair trade.

398
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,774
I didn't, Leach,
give him a hand.

399
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:10,445
Stick with me, I'll
look out for you.

400
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:05,541
Over against that ledge, quick.

401
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:48,436
- What did you see?
- Nothing.

402
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,229
The best thing
you could've seen.

403
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:53,065
They're probably hitting
the cabin about now.

404
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:56,082
I wouldn't have given a plugged
nickel for our chances last night.

405
00:44:56,569 --> 00:45:00,323
How much you think they'll be worth after
them Indians find out they've been tricked?

406
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:04,410
I'm plumb wore out, when
you figuring on stopping?

407
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:07,496
- Well, not here.
- That girl needs some rest.

408
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:11,000
Those Apaches catch up with
us, she'll get a good long rest.

409
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,408
This will have to do.

410
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:39,839
That Keliher,
that Keliher, he...

411
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:43,426
- sure pushes hard, doesn't he?
- Yeah, too hard.

412
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:46,513
You want me to help you
find a place to bed down?

413
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,264
No, thanks. I'll...

414
00:46:50,433 --> 00:46:51,434
All right.

415
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:58,691
All right Sam, bail off.

416
00:47:03,696 --> 00:47:07,867
You better post a lookout, I know
them Apaches, they ain't give up.

417
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:12,538
I'll take the first watch, whoever
is on guard keeps an eye on Ward.

418
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:16,709
You and ward seem
uncommon friendly.

419
00:47:17,877 --> 00:47:22,798
In case you get any ideas, remember
I sleep lighter than a night owl.

420
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:28,637
Stay awake all night if you
want to, tie these horses off.

421
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:52,453
NO, no, no, not now. Later.

422
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:54,663
I'll come to you.

423
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:27,113
You get a strange sense of humor
Sam, then you always did have.

424
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:32,451
NO, no, I was just remembering
that night on the Concho...

425
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:35,413
when we were in the Rangers
together, remember that night?

426
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:40,126
- Yeah, I remember it.
- Yeah, was Comanche country.

427
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,379
Just the two of us
on guard that night.

428
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:47,925
All those shadows out there.
Yeah, we were a little edgy.

429
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:50,469
Oh Captain
Roberts, he, he said...

430
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:55,975
he said, the Comanches never,
never strike at night, remember?

431
00:48:56,976 --> 00:49:01,272
Yeah, yeah well, just when we getting
a little comfort from that thought...

432
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:06,444
those Comanches hit us, boy they came
hollering and veiling in out of the night.

433
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:08,237
Scared us half to death.

434
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:11,031
Yeah, we had quite a
fight on our hands that night.

435
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:14,952
Oh Logan, Logan...

436
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:18,456
in those days I thought more of
you than anybody in the whole world.

437
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:21,834
I would've put my
life in your hands.

438
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,962
Matter of fact, I did.

439
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:31,177
Well, it just goes to show you
how wrong you can be about people.

440
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:35,870
First time I get in a little trouble, first
time I get on the wrong side of the law...

441
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:38,142
you turn against me.

442
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:43,647
Well, I haven't trust
in anybody since.

443
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,279
I didn't turn on you Sam.

444
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:53,449
I even quit the Rangers so
wouldn't have to go after you.

445
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:57,328
You quit the Rangers so you
could go after my wife and kid.

446
00:49:58,037 --> 00:49:59,371
That's not true.

447
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:03,125
Sam, you left that girl broke
and homeless with a baby to raise.

448
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:07,254
Well, that don't give you no
license to go out, stealing them.

449
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:09,965
We didn't even think about
getting married the first I...

450
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,802
felt the responsibility
because you were my friend.

451
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:16,180
A responsibility I
don't think you ever felt.

452
00:50:16,472 --> 00:50:18,933
Logan, everything
that I ever did...

453
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,685
I did for them and their sake.

454
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:24,730
Shooting a man and...

455
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:28,192
going to prison for life is not
exactly the right way to raise a family.

456
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:33,280
Well, I didn't mean to shoot that
man, I mean, not the first one anyway.

457
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:39,870
And then, after I, I broke out well, I had
no choice but to go on making it with my gun.

458
00:50:41,497 --> 00:50:43,499
You didn't have to
come looking for me.

459
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:45,501
<i>Oh yes, I did Logan.</i>

460
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:48,147
That's the one
thing I did have to do.

461
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:50,297
There's something you
better get straight Sam.

462
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:54,218
Susan is my wife
now and I love her.

463
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:59,306
And Sammy is my son, not yours,
was only a baby when you left.

464
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:02,601
All these years, he's had
my love and I've had his.

465
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:06,397
It's not enough just
to plant the seed Sam.

466
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:10,651
The real father is the man who
gives his whole life to a child.

467
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:16,365
I'm the father, Sammy is
my flesh, he's my blood.

468
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,868
And I'm going to kill you
for taking him away from me.

469
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,473
No, not here, over there
where they can't see us.

470
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:06,683
Come on.

471
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:31,852
All right, let's
get ready to ride.

472
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:36,607
On Ward jumping you like that kind of sets
my mind at ease about a couple of things.

473
00:54:36,899 --> 00:54:38,066
Well, now you know.

474
00:54:43,572 --> 00:54:44,572
This yours?

475
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:47,868
- You tricked me, you dirty little...
- No, I didn't, let me got.

476
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:52,316
- You were supposed to be guarding him.
- Stop crowding me or I'll make you wish...

477
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:25,364
- Turned west here.
- He's heading right back the way he came.

478
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:31,161
Not anymore.

479
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:45,384
Hi boys.

480
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:49,096
You must be getting to
like that horse of mine Sam.

481
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:51,029
Nice of you to bring
him back this time.

482
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:53,136
Yeah, well I figured you'd
appreciate that, ain't it?

483
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,893
Brought back a mess
of Apaches to boot.

484
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:59,022
- Thought you preferred those Indians to us.
- No, I changed my mind.

485
00:56:03,986 --> 00:56:06,029
There's a place to
stand them off up ahead.

486
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:38,412
Rifle Sam.

487
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:43,585
What's the matter boy? Don't
like the way I shoot Apaches?

488
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:46,254
Yeah, you shoot Apaches fine.

489
00:57:47,339 --> 00:57:49,091
- We did it.
- We whipped them.

490
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:52,719
- You don't know much about Indians, do you?
- Think they'll be back?

491
00:57:53,345 --> 00:57:55,973
They'll be back all right, it's
a matter of when and how.

492
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:58,433
Keep an eye on him.

493
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:07,256
Why don't we try and get out
of here while we got the chance?

494
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:10,445
Yeah sure, those Apaches
would like that just fine.

495
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:13,156
I'll take my chances right here.

496
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:20,247
Everything all right back here?

497
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:24,876
- Yeah, I guess so, are they gone?
- For now.

498
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:29,673
- Look, I can use a gun if I have to.
- We may need you.

499
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:33,719
- Do we have much chance?
- We'll give them a fight.

500
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,099
- Guess you're safe enough here.
- Logan...

501
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:42,644
I'm sorry about the knife.

502
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:46,898
- That was last night.
- No.

503
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:49,443
I didn't know Sam was
going to try to kill you.

504
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:52,362
You know Sam very well, do you?

505
00:58:56,742 --> 00:58:57,909
I do now.

506
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:03,915
He's just like all
other men, using me.

507
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:07,836
Sure made it sound good though.

508
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:13,508
Promised he'd take me to
El Paso, dress me in silk...

509
00:59:14,843 --> 00:59:16,720
stay at the best hotel.

510
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:21,975
Oh yeah, we had
a lot of fine plans.

511
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:28,482
Now, if I even get out of this alive,
probably wind up going to prison.

512
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:36,490
Maybe not, no one needs
to know about that knife.

513
00:59:43,163 --> 00:59:44,163
Thanks Logan.

514
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:50,462
You know, I've always thought
that all men were the same.

515
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:57,219
But if I get out of this alive
and get another chance, I...

516
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:11,607
Diggs, stay there.

517
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:16,414
Watch that ledge,
I'll try to draw him out.

518
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:42,346
Lottie.

519
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:08,832
I, I feel, I feel sort of
naked without my gun.

520
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:12,210
It won't take long to dress
you when those Apaches hit.

521
01:01:12,878 --> 01:01:16,047
You know Logan, I get the
feeling that you don't trust me.

522
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:18,382
Should 1?

523
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:35,066
We ought to get out of here
while we still got the time.

524
01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:38,278
Well, we ought to.

525
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:40,697
We won't stand a chance in
here when they come back.

526
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:43,200
How much of a chance you
think we'll stand out there?

527
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,582
Leach getting a little edgy?

528
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:54,920
Man ought to learn to face
death without whimpering.

529
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:57,933
Maybe is the waiting
that's getting to him.

530
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:00,153
Well, that's the
hard part all right.

531
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:03,678
But when they do come,
then a man is really alive.

532
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,807
Diggs, you know I get the
feeling you kind of like this.

533
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:11,728
'Tain't that so much, but
life sort of pass this by.

534
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:17,275
Now fighting Indians, well, that
makes us of some use again.

535
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:20,487
It's good to know that
old gun is on my side.

536
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:25,367
Well, you're not a bad fella Keliher,
the way they come nowadays anyway.

537
01:02:26,952 --> 01:02:29,913
Just a mite of education
would straighten you right out.

538
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:34,960
Nobody's gun is ever on anybody's
side out of plain kindness of heart.

539
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:37,629
Man's nature is too
pure cursed for that.

540
01:02:41,341 --> 01:02:43,261
I can't give you an
argument about that just now.

541
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:48,765
Way I see it, everybody is out after
everybody else hide, one way or another.

542
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:55,981
- Who are you looking to skin out Diggs?
- Nobody, unless he stands in my way.

543
01:02:58,483 --> 01:02:59,734
Sort of what I figured.

544
01:04:57,769 --> 01:04:58,895
Tucker.

545
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:16,454
- Now, about that bank money.
- Hey Diggs, I'm glad you brought that up.

546
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:19,916
You know, it's funny I'd all
most forgotten about the money.

547
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:22,937
You know, you didn't have
quite the right attitude when we...

548
01:05:22,961 --> 01:05:24,712
talked about it
back at the cabin.

549
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:27,382
But then, your objection
is been taken care of.

550
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:32,345
Tucker of course, he
was against killing ward.

551
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:35,723
He won't care now.

552
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:41,104
Hey Leach, you haven't
changed your mind, have you?

553
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:44,857
No.

554
01:05:45,316 --> 01:05:48,486
That's it, then. we'll shoot
Ward and split the money.

555
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:51,114
Let's see, there's
five of us left.

556
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:55,910
- Comes to $4,000 a piece.
- Aren't you hurrying things a little bit?

557
01:05:56,828 --> 01:05:58,621
Keliher hasn't agreed
to come in with us.

558
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:02,125
Oh, he'll come along
with it, won't you Keliher?

559
01:06:04,544 --> 01:06:06,463
There's four of us against you.

560
01:06:09,257 --> 01:06:11,551
You're damned if you do
and damned if you don't.

561
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:20,018
All right, 4,000 dollars looks
pretty big to me right now.

562
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:24,564
But we better hang onto ward for a
while longer, came in handy this morning.

563
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:27,984
Oh, we'll leave him here with
them, he'd just be dead weight for us.

564
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:30,195
Not if we run into
those Apaches again.

565
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:34,240
He's right, we'll keep Ward
until we get out of Indian country.

566
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:45,084
- So now the Indians are saving my life, eh?
- In front.

567
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:53,695
All right, get down.
Without the rifle.

568
01:07:57,323 --> 01:07:59,635
Carrying the two of us this horse
will never make it in to Griffin.

569
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:02,299
Griffin? We'd be better off if we
headed in the opposite direction.

570
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:05,495
With that old fox Diggs on our trail,
doesn't matter which direction we hit.

571
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:07,959
- If we make it to Griffin, we'll be safe.
- Safe?

572
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:13,965
Well, that don't
exactly fit into my plan.

573
01:08:14,966 --> 01:08:18,366
You know Logan, you're such a good friend,
aren't you? That you're going to save me...

574
01:08:19,304 --> 01:08:22,765
- for a hanging, eh?
- You made your own bed Sam.

575
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:32,400
- Well, what you going to do? Lynch me?
- No, less you try to get away.

576
01:08:33,026 --> 01:08:34,736
I'm to let you lynch yourself.

577
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:42,451
Now move out.

578
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:45,287
Go on.

579
01:09:03,765 --> 01:09:04,974
Hold up Sam.

580
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,102
You ought to be played
out enough by now.

581
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:12,607
- The rope is sawing my head Off.
- Turn around.

582
01:09:49,143 --> 01:09:51,063
Well, it looks like we're
on the same side again.

583
01:09:51,104 --> 01:09:53,898
The first things
first, for both of us.

584
01:10:03,658 --> 01:10:05,535
We'll never be able
to stand them off here.

585
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,371
Work higher.

586
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:29,989
Sam?

587
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:42,126
I was going to kill you.

588
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,881
You make up your mind to do
something, you sure are bullheaded.

589
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:49,842
How bad is it?

590
01:13:51,636 --> 01:13:53,512
Probably live to get
another chance at me.

591
01:13:57,516 --> 01:13:59,060
I'll get the horse.

592
01:14:01,479 --> 01:14:04,523
- Leave me here.
- No.

593
01:14:06,233 --> 01:14:10,488
- You'd be taking a corpse back.
- You can make it as far as my place.

594
01:14:10,905 --> 01:14:12,949
I'll fix up the wagon and
take you in from there.

595
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:15,534
Talk about being bullheaded.

596
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,095
Logan.

597
01:15:26,105 --> 01:15:27,481
I've got Sam out there.

598
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:33,029
- He's alive?
- Just barely.

599
01:15:37,742 --> 01:15:38,826
I didn't shoot him.

600
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:44,498
- Dad, Dad.
- Boy.

601
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:47,793
Come here.

602
01:15:50,337 --> 01:15:54,425
- Come on boy.
- Sam might tell him.

603
01:16:02,266 --> 01:16:04,477
Let me take a look at you son.

604
01:16:08,606 --> 01:16:12,860
You don't know me, do you son?

605
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:17,531
Are you the man Dad
was after, Sam ward?

606
01:16:20,034 --> 01:16:23,996
- My name is Sam too.
- I know.

607
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:28,375
Is it true you killed 20
men? A kid in town said so.

608
01:16:31,295 --> 01:16:32,463
How many then?

609
01:16:35,549 --> 01:16:36,926
Too many.

610
01:16:38,761 --> 01:16:40,137
You bad hurt mister?

611
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:48,979
- Yeah, I'm bad hurt all right?
- Could I help you?

612
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:53,192
- Could you get me some water?
- Sure.

613
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:25,391
Thank you Sam.

614
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:33,065
Dad, Dad.

615
01:17:39,363 --> 01:17:42,700
- He's hurt Dad.
- Yeah, I know.

616
01:17:44,535 --> 01:17:45,744
Fix a bed in the wagon.

617
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:50,708
Sammy, you help your mother.

618
01:18:06,015 --> 01:18:09,643
- You ready to travel? Come on.
- I'll do it.

619
01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:41,050
You're...

620
01:18:42,635 --> 01:18:44,511
You're doing a good job...

621
01:18:45,596 --> 01:18:49,141
Logan with my...

622
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:54,521
with your son.

623
01:19:06,951 --> 01:19:08,327
Yeah...

624
01:19:11,121 --> 01:19:12,498
with our son.
