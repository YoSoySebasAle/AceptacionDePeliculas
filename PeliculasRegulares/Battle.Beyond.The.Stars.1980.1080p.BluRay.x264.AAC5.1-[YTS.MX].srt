1
00:02:43,287 --> 00:02:45,287
Give me the second field.

2
00:02:45,585 --> 00:02:47,858
<i>- At once, sir.
- Second field, activate.</i>

3
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,642
This is Akir, a planet of stone
with a single green spot.

4
00:02:52,913 --> 00:02:55,592
Let's see it. Field five.

5
00:02:55,671 --> 00:02:57,773
<i>- Fifth field.
- Fifth field.</i>

6
00:02:57,885 --> 00:02:59,370
What about their forms?

7
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,975
Compatible with ours: Oxygen
burners with lateral symmetry.

8
00:03:05,121 --> 00:03:09,121
They have a solar technology,
no known defence capacity.

9
00:03:09,152 --> 00:03:11,175
Interesting. Let's check that.

10
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:14,261
The only craft they have
is an old weather ship.

11
00:03:18,238 --> 00:03:22,309
We've got a few cloud formations. Look
like negative ion over the fertile region.

12
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:26,698
Nothing to worry about.
And as for that cold front...

13
00:03:26,714 --> 00:03:29,121
Hey Gar, I'm picking up something here.

14
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,208
We got visitors!

15
00:03:36,255 --> 00:03:40,553
Hello there! Welcome to the outer
atmosphere of the planet Akir.

16
00:03:42,721 --> 00:03:44,721
Put it through the language translator.

17
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,555
Hello? Could you identify yourself, please?

18
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,576
What is it?

19
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:54,210
<i>Hear me, beings of Akir.</i>

20
00:04:55,106 --> 00:04:58,234
<i>I am Sador of the Malmori.</i>

21
00:04:58,971 --> 00:05:02,641
<i>I have come with my forces to conquer you.</i>

22
00:05:04,043 --> 00:05:07,672
<i>If you resist, I will crush you.</i>

23
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:11,183
I possess a stellar converter,

24
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:14,380
the most powerful weapon in the universe.

25
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,121
You cannot resist me.

26
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:21,420
<i>I want your planet to be my colony.</i>

27
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:26,982
<i>You harvest comes in seven
risings of your red giant.</i>

28
00:05:27,534 --> 00:05:29,534
<i>I will return then</i>

29
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:34,268
and you will accept me as your master.

30
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:39,976
If you do not submit, your planet
and all life on it

31
00:05:40,047 --> 00:05:42,633
<i>will be burned to ash.</i>

32
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,804
Snipers forward.

33
00:05:49,429 --> 00:05:50,406
Snipers!

34
00:05:51,468 --> 00:05:52,531
Forward!

35
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,060
Fire at will.

36
00:06:11,594 --> 00:06:15,999
<i>Merely a demonstration, beings of Akir.</i>

37
00:06:17,222 --> 00:06:20,893
I will return in seven risings.

38
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,883
<i>You are mine.</i>

39
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:38,123
Yago.

40
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:41,954
Pick a fighter to stay
behind and watch them.

41
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:45,336
Full thrust, Umateal.

42
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,905
I have a promise to keep.

43
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,876
No, no. Listen to me. We don't know how.

44
00:07:01,891 --> 00:07:04,196
We live by the Varda.
The Varda is not to fight.

45
00:07:04,228 --> 00:07:05,876
The Akira haven't fought for centuries.

46
00:07:05,907 --> 00:07:08,050
I have fought.

47
00:07:08,143 --> 00:07:10,120
And I am a son of Akir.

48
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,220
And you are an old man.

49
00:07:12,251 --> 00:07:15,462
I have lasted this long by fighting.

50
00:07:15,481 --> 00:07:18,456
We are all going to be killed.
We are defenceless.

51
00:07:19,104 --> 00:07:21,229
To fight creatures of violence

52
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,318
you must use creatures of violence.

53
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,389
- Hire mercenaries?
- We have no wealth to offer them.

54
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,869
The violent fight for many reasons.

55
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,965
Well yes, but then who will protect
us against these mercenaries?

56
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:37,416
For that we have the Varda.

57
00:07:37,447 --> 00:07:38,838
Who will find them?

58
00:07:39,322 --> 00:07:40,359
I will.

59
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:43,076
You? You're a boy...

60
00:07:44,934 --> 00:07:48,200
The Varda teach us that
each form has its function.

61
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:52,004
My brother is the only one
who can fly Zed's ship.

62
00:07:52,073 --> 00:07:53,660
That's a junk pile.

63
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:54,957
Junk pile!

64
00:07:55,314 --> 00:07:57,314
I've taken her up.

65
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:00,946
I think she trusts me.

66
00:08:02,898 --> 00:08:04,898
And your first mission:

67
00:08:04,991 --> 00:08:08,069
Go to the Phoenix Cluster.
Find the station Dr. Hephaestus.

68
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,152
The best weapons man in the system.

69
00:08:10,182 --> 00:08:14,368
Drop my name and he'll be sure to help you,
if he's still operative...

70
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:25,295
I'm turning the boy over to you, Nell.
Take good care of him.

71
00:08:26,713 --> 00:08:28,713
Hello, Nell.

72
00:08:32,447 --> 00:08:33,580
Nell?

73
00:08:38,221 --> 00:08:39,244
Hello, Nell?

74
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,805
Are you there, old girl?

75
00:08:51,905 --> 00:08:55,608
<i>- Nobody calls me that but Zed.
- Sorry.</i>

76
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:59,740
<i>This isn't going to be just another
planetary joy ride, you know.</i>

77
00:08:59,795 --> 00:09:03,982
I know that, Nell. I'll do
my best not to let you down.

78
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:05,578
<i>We'll see.</i>

79
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:08,482
Anyway, I told them you trusted me.

80
00:09:09,451 --> 00:09:12,318
<i>You're okay.
A little wet behind the ears...</i>

81
00:09:12,326 --> 00:09:17,141
The only thing we have to remember is
that if we don't make it, nobody else will.

82
00:09:43,391 --> 00:09:45,856
I've spent my whole life in that city now.

83
00:09:47,118 --> 00:09:48,821
The first time away from home.

84
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,921
<i>I'm your home now, kid.</i>

85
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,635
What do you think it is, Kalo?

86
00:09:56,728 --> 00:10:00,049
Maybe it's some of them trying
to escape to another planet.

87
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,834
What do you think we should do?

88
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,559
We don't have orders about escape attempts.

89
00:10:04,778 --> 00:10:06,005
So...?

90
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,647
So we blow it up...

91
00:10:09,394 --> 00:10:11,775
just to be on the safe side!

92
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,238
<i>Malmori fighter.</i>

93
00:10:22,338 --> 00:10:24,338
<i>Just one, but it's coming full thrust!</i>

94
00:10:32,172 --> 00:10:34,172
Okay, Nell. What do I do?

95
00:10:34,328 --> 00:10:35,461
Nell, what do I do?

96
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,971
<i>Lock in on target.</i>

97
00:10:44,441 --> 00:10:46,441
<i>Weapons activated.</i>

98
00:10:48,094 --> 00:10:49,813
<i>Now!</i>

99
00:10:50,418 --> 00:10:51,722
<i>Blast them!</i>

100
00:10:51,753 --> 00:10:53,213
<i>- I can't.
- What?</i>

101
00:10:53,229 --> 00:10:56,166
I can't! I mean if we blast them,
we're going to tip our hand.

102
00:10:56,229 --> 00:10:59,494
Wait a minute. Wait... Wait a minute.
Can we outrun them?

103
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:02,885
<i>We sure as hell cannot fight them,
not with you in the driver's seat.</i>

104
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:10,667
Right, Kalo, right!

105
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:11,722
Turn...

106
00:11:11,943 --> 00:11:16,099
Turn it! Get me a shot!
Just one clear shot!

107
00:11:16,146 --> 00:11:19,466
I'm trying, I'm trying, but
he won't stand and fight.

108
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:23,847
- Kalo, get me a shot!
- Cut it out! Go back to work.

109
00:11:55,678 --> 00:11:57,678
Why are we slowing down?

110
00:11:59,869 --> 00:12:01,616
We were ordered to watch the planet.

111
00:12:01,647 --> 00:12:03,671
To hell with orders.

112
00:12:03,694 --> 00:12:05,974
I want that ship.

113
00:12:06,751 --> 00:12:10,079
Remember Lobo?
He disobeyed orders

114
00:12:10,145 --> 00:12:12,270
and now Sador is wearing his left foot.

115
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,944
Maybe we better go back.

116
00:12:26,555 --> 00:12:29,836
<i>Showing my backside to those
mutant sons of bitches.</i>

117
00:12:29,855 --> 00:12:32,660
<i>I can't believe it!
You got no backbone, kid.</i>

118
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,042
<i>When Zed was your age...</i>

119
00:12:34,135 --> 00:12:38,470
My job is to find mercenaries.
And I'm not Zed.

120
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,883
<i>You bet! Not even a pale imitation.</i>

121
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:46,416
You know, I thought I did pretty well back there.
I mean, you're still in one piece, aren't you?

122
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:50,979
<i>Sure you did there, but at the contest for running
away, you'll be champion of the universe.</i>

123
00:12:51,777 --> 00:12:54,566
Why don't you...? Why don't...

124
00:12:55,043 --> 00:12:57,520
Just take me to the Hephaestus Station.

125
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:23,961
<i>The station of Dr. Hephaestus, Shad.
There, dead ahead.</i>

126
00:13:58,031 --> 00:14:00,836
This is an emissary from the planet Akir.

127
00:14:18,034 --> 00:14:20,034
Dr. Hephaestus?

128
00:14:36,552 --> 00:14:38,959
Does anybody receive my transmission?

129
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:47,841
I'll have to go in anyway.
Manual controls, Nell.

130
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:49,926
Give me the docking thrusters, please.

131
00:16:56,577 --> 00:16:58,577
Who sent you?

132
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,643
What have you come for?

133
00:17:07,435 --> 00:17:11,028
Oh, audio malfunction, huh?
I'll have to take a look at your banks.

134
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,156
Wait a minute! I'm not an android.

135
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,727
You're warm!

136
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,312
Of course I'm warm.

137
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:21,707
I'm organic. Haven't you
ever seen an organic form?

138
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,716
No! Except my father.

139
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,177
What?

140
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,802
There are only the androids.

141
00:17:32,267 --> 00:17:34,267
I take care of them.

142
00:17:35,445 --> 00:17:36,859
I see. Well...

143
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:42,440
If you would like to let me out of this,
I'll tell you why I'm here. Please.

144
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,635
Unless I can bring back a fighting force
and offer some resistance, we're finished.

145
00:17:46,734 --> 00:17:48,550
Do you think your father will help?

146
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:52,135
Your father isn't the way he was when
your friend Zed knew him, you'll see.

147
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,325
As long as he gives us the weapons.

148
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:55,716
We're here.

149
00:17:57,878 --> 00:18:01,831
You go on alone. It's father's wish.

150
00:18:13,469 --> 00:18:16,297
You are welcome, Shad of the Akira.

151
00:18:18,211 --> 00:18:22,184
Thank you, doctor.
This is quite a surprise.

152
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:25,060
I heard your story in the cargo.

153
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:29,358
When you're in my station,
you're in my presence.

154
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,554
Great. And we won't waste time.
Will you help us, doctor?

155
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:38,701
I am an old man. Older even than Zed.

156
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:44,216
I have seen many wars, large
and small, throughout the galaxies.

157
00:18:45,238 --> 00:18:49,409
Forms must pray on other forms to survive.

158
00:18:50,126 --> 00:18:53,696
That's not what the Varda teach us.
We pray on no one.

159
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,678
Your planet is doomed.
And I have other plans for you.

160
00:18:58,334 --> 00:18:59,955
Other plans?

161
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,435
This station was built for many.

162
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:06,311
It remains a hollow and lonely place.

163
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,440
You've met my daughter.

164
00:19:10,674 --> 00:19:11,526
Yes.

165
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:15,783
Wait a minute.

166
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:23,946
You don't mean that you want me
to breed with your daughter?

167
00:19:24,085 --> 00:19:28,956
<i>It seems a better fate than that
offered by the Malmori, does it not?</i>

168
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:33,704
<i>You would stay here in peace forever.</i>

169
00:19:33,749 --> 00:19:36,979
What about your daughter?
Have you asked what she wants?

170
00:19:37,194 --> 00:19:44,475
Leprus, Skew, escort the
gentleman to Nanelia's room.

171
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:47,021
He's got a lot to think about.

172
00:20:02,293 --> 00:20:03,262
Hi.

173
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:09,535
Father wanted me to talk to you. He means
to keep you here for me. I'm sorry.

174
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:16,326
I do not have time for this.
Don't you have enough toys?

175
00:20:19,768 --> 00:20:23,593
He said you're sure to be killed.
I wouldn't want that.

176
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:27,675
Saunders, prepare the conjugal suite.

177
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:29,978
Fresh bedding, everything.

178
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:33,135
The gentleman will be staying, then, sir?

179
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:35,148
He will.

180
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,070
Nanelia will convince him.

181
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,236
I'm sure she will, sir.

182
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,795
The defence of his planet is hopeless.

183
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:47,159
He will understand that.

184
00:20:47,482 --> 00:20:49,746
I'm sure he will, sir.

185
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:52,860
We will have children here, Saunders.

186
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,186
Noise, excitement, life.

187
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,717
It will be quite a change, sir.

188
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,923
In the colder season, even the grasses
in the meadows changes colour.

189
00:21:03,981 --> 00:21:05,391
Chlorophyll content.

190
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:10,261
Whatever.
They turn bright red, yellow, orange.

191
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:14,256
They change shade and
wave when the wind blows.

192
00:21:14,901 --> 00:21:16,072
Wind?

193
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:18,393
Yes, wind.

194
00:21:18,618 --> 00:21:21,743
It's... It's rather like your
ventilation system in here.

195
00:21:21,845 --> 00:21:26,802
You know, rapid ventilation, but it's
different, bigger than this, but it's wind.

196
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:31,394
I've scanned all these things in our data
banks, but I've never experienced them.

197
00:21:31,433 --> 00:21:37,308
Do you know there's a form in the Black Galaxy whose
children have no immune system till the age of five cycles?

198
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:41,110
That means that at the slightest trace of
infection they would just rot like fallen fruit

199
00:21:41,149 --> 00:21:43,617
I have heard of them. The Huddite.

200
00:21:44,352 --> 00:21:46,094
Who asked you?

201
00:21:46,315 --> 00:21:48,839
When they reach the age of five cycles

202
00:21:48,855 --> 00:21:51,168
all the relatives gather
together in a special room

203
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:56,088
and they watch while the child tears and bites
at his plastoid with its teeth and nails

204
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,592
till it breaks out in the
arms of his parents.

205
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,067
Feels their skin for the first time.

206
00:22:02,074 --> 00:22:04,370
Feels the wetness on their
cheeks for the first time.

207
00:22:04,451 --> 00:22:09,296
It's horrible out there. Forms
preying on other forms. Death...

208
00:22:10,419 --> 00:22:14,499
Most of them never do develop immunities.
They die shortly afterwards.

209
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:19,046
But the Huddite still feel that the
breaking out ceremony is very beautiful.

210
00:22:20,987 --> 00:22:23,615
You really want to go
back there, don't you?

211
00:22:24,045 --> 00:22:26,131
Even if it's certain you'll end?

212
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,951
Oh yes. I'm going back.

213
00:22:33,383 --> 00:22:35,087
Step into the Captor Grid.

214
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:38,874
I must warn you, miss Nanelia. That would
cause the Captor Grid to short circuit.

215
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:40,242
So...

216
00:22:56,228 --> 00:22:58,861
Come with me. You know about computers.
You can help us.

217
00:22:58,955 --> 00:23:01,379
I can't! I can't leave my father.

218
00:23:01,804 --> 00:23:04,562
I wish I had time to stay and
convince you, but it's your life.

219
00:23:05,487 --> 00:23:07,487
Such as it is...

220
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:11,596
Dummy.

221
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,651
<i>What took you so long?</i>

222
00:23:24,674 --> 00:23:28,138
<i>- He wanted me to stay for dinner.
- And how is old Doc Hephaestus?</i>

223
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:31,433
Well, he's not the man he used to be.
Let's get out of here.

224
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,984
<i>Come with me. You can help us.</i>

225
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:18,039
No weapons at all?

226
00:24:18,149 --> 00:24:24,110
No, but I brought an analyser. We can predict
their attack modes and plan a defence.

227
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:29,091
<i>I'd like to exchange data with that thing.
Might be some new wrinkles I should catch up on.</i>

228
00:24:30,272 --> 00:24:31,639
<i>Who's that?</i>

229
00:24:31,665 --> 00:24:33,514
It's just Nell.

230
00:24:33,593 --> 00:24:34,609
Nell?

231
00:24:35,426 --> 00:24:38,668
I'll introduce you later, back on Akir.

232
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,522
<i>Wait for me in the Lambda Zone.</i>

233
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:05,972
Our emissary has returned from Umateal.

234
00:25:07,275 --> 00:25:09,718
They have replied to our ultimatum.

235
00:25:10,767 --> 00:25:11,619
And?

236
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,520
What's this?

237
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,613
It is our emissary, sir.

238
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:30,870
They have powdered him.

239
00:25:35,441 --> 00:25:39,901
They are a proud form.

240
00:25:40,391 --> 00:25:42,977
In an hour they'll be an extinct one.

241
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:48,940
Not a trace of them left,
not even their dust.

242
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:57,373
Think the girl will be all right
crossing through the Lambda Zone?

243
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:01,801
<i>Well in my day that was a pretty wild area, but
it's probably tamed down like everything else.</i>

244
00:26:01,815 --> 00:26:06,010
I suppose. She's a very
interesting form, Nell.

245
00:26:06,048 --> 00:26:08,938
<i>Starboard side, kid. We've got some action.</i>

246
00:26:09,626 --> 00:26:10,548
What is it?

247
00:26:26,531 --> 00:26:29,867
<i>The little ones are Jackers.
They're breaking down his force shield.</i>

248
00:26:29,968 --> 00:26:33,156
<i>- Then what?
- They incinerate him and steal his load.</i>

249
00:26:37,275 --> 00:26:42,447
♪ Sixteen gamblers to carry my coffin ♪

250
00:26:42,496 --> 00:26:45,354
♪ Six purty maidens to sing... ♪

251
00:26:49,819 --> 00:26:52,947
♪ And lay the sod on me ♪

252
00:26:54,005 --> 00:26:59,692
♪ For I'm a poor cowboy
Know I done wrong ♪

253
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,792
<i>This is Space Cowboy. S.O.S.</i>

254
00:27:03,012 --> 00:27:04,074
Mayday.

255
00:27:04,855 --> 00:27:06,457
Help!

256
00:27:06,927 --> 00:27:10,377
<i>- Can we help him, Nell?
- Not without a fight.</i>

257
00:27:13,693 --> 00:27:14,506
<i>Well...</i>

258
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:19,589
You're just lucky I haven't
got any ammunition left.

259
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:28,523
I've never taken life before, Nell.

260
00:27:28,595 --> 00:27:31,961
<i>The Varda says we can
take life to save life.</i>

261
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:36,403
Okay, Nell. Let's do it.

262
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:39,531
Manual controls.

263
00:27:45,267 --> 00:27:47,267
<i>Locking on target.</i>

264
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,710
<i>- Fire. Fire!
- Not from behind.</i>

265
00:27:50,773 --> 00:27:52,773
<i>Step in it, kid. You've
got to follow through.</i>

266
00:27:52,819 --> 00:27:55,172
No, no. Not from behind, no.

267
00:28:01,311 --> 00:28:03,513
Hooray for our side.

268
00:28:04,459 --> 00:28:06,141
You fired without me.

269
00:28:06,343 --> 00:28:08,155
<i>It had to be done.</i>

270
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,854
You're placed under my direct command.
You fired without me.

271
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,821
That which is not organic must not...

272
00:28:13,822 --> 00:28:17,565
<i>...harm that which is. I know, I know.
It's a damn stupid rule.</i>

273
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,094
Jacker to port. Sector three.

274
00:28:54,378 --> 00:28:55,659
I did it.

275
00:28:58,504 --> 00:28:59,699
I...

276
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,448
didn't think, I just did it.

277
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:06,486
<i>You had to, kid. You done fine.</i>

278
00:29:11,045 --> 00:29:12,874
<i>Fighting?</i>

279
00:29:13,302 --> 00:29:17,366
Listen, I've done more fighting
than I've seen old movies.

280
00:29:17,576 --> 00:29:20,653
Which is saying a lot seeing
that's all I do on long hauls.

281
00:29:20,771 --> 00:29:21,700
Well...

282
00:29:23,407 --> 00:29:26,071
I have the greatest
collection of old westerns...

283
00:29:26,137 --> 00:29:28,973
We'll need experienced soldiers.
Would you care to fight with us?

284
00:29:31,089 --> 00:29:35,033
Yeah, you see, you're fighting Sador.

285
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,868
Sador's never lost a war. He never quits.

286
00:29:39,501 --> 00:29:43,126
You fight Sador, you've got a
snowball's chance in hell.

287
00:29:44,212 --> 00:29:45,282
Snowball?

288
00:29:45,329 --> 00:29:49,462
<i>Transmission from the planet Umateal.
The Malmori force has arrived.</i>

289
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:51,663
Put it up on the screen, Nell.

290
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:21,542
Stellar converter...

291
00:30:53,705 --> 00:30:55,275
See what I mean?

292
00:31:00,715 --> 00:31:02,009
Umateal.

293
00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:05,158
That was my customer.

294
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:11,580
How would you like 10.000 Mach Laser 4's
and 40.000 Charge Snides?

295
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:13,522
They're paid for and I haven't
got the fuel to get them home.

296
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,668
You're carrying weapons?

297
00:31:15,715 --> 00:31:18,544
They're hand weapons, the best we make.

298
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:21,442
We're going to need weapons...

299
00:31:22,191 --> 00:31:25,350
but we won't know how to use them.

300
00:31:26,355 --> 00:31:27,347
Yeah.

301
00:31:28,014 --> 00:31:31,934
And we'll probably need someone
to teach us how to use them.

302
00:31:33,226 --> 00:31:36,123
Yes, I can see that.

303
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:39,046
And we did save your life.

304
00:31:43,265 --> 00:31:46,702
Okay. My rig's a hauler, not a fighter, but

305
00:31:46,736 --> 00:31:48,736
I'll set up your ground defences.

306
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,464
Agreed? Put it there.

307
00:31:52,461 --> 00:31:54,874
- I'm not the cavalry.
- Cavalry?

308
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:59,752
I'll show you! You've got
a treat in store for you.

309
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:05,586
As a matter of fact, I'll show
you Custer's Last Stand.

310
00:33:39,389 --> 00:33:41,482
Yes indeed.

311
00:33:42,116 --> 00:33:44,604
A pretty tasty looking morsel.

312
00:33:45,598 --> 00:33:46,928
Who are you?

313
00:33:46,978 --> 00:33:51,274
Your saviours. You were about
to be digested by a Zime.

314
00:33:51,728 --> 00:33:52,861
A Zime?

315
00:33:53,032 --> 00:33:57,134
A creature who consumes living organisms.

316
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:58,687
We're Zimeirs.

317
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:01,373
We cook them down for their protein.

318
00:34:02,951 --> 00:34:06,255
I am Cayman of the Lambda Zone.

319
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:09,083
And these are my crew.

320
00:34:09,138 --> 00:34:10,115
They're burning me.

321
00:34:10,152 --> 00:34:14,457
They're Kelvin. Urim and Thunim.

322
00:34:14,479 --> 00:34:19,213
The Kelvin are a thermal creature.
They communicate in degrees of heat.

323
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,846
And this is Quopeg...

324
00:34:21,908 --> 00:34:23,384
My Kunar.

325
00:34:23,445 --> 00:34:26,719
Well, I'd like to thank you all very much.
Now just get me down.

326
00:34:26,743 --> 00:34:30,961
Now, now, now! Don't be too grateful.

327
00:34:30,993 --> 00:34:37,555
I know a market where a female form like
yours would bring in some heavy dust.

328
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:40,747
You'd do that? You'd sell me?

329
00:34:41,101 --> 00:34:45,814
Well of course! Live or for protein.
I do whatever pays the most.

330
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:51,812
I'm hiring mercenaries for a
great battle on the planet Akir.

331
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:54,966
Is that so?

332
00:34:55,238 --> 00:34:58,335
What could this planet Akir offer me?

333
00:35:00,374 --> 00:35:04,454
They have the richest molybdenum
deposits in the system.

334
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:09,825
Nice try, hot blood, but
I've already seen Akir

335
00:35:10,021 --> 00:35:12,820
and there is absolutely nothing
on that planet that I want.

336
00:35:13,724 --> 00:35:16,448
You're heartless. You're just like Sador!

337
00:35:16,521 --> 00:35:17,654
Sador.

338
00:35:17,718 --> 00:35:21,396
Sador? Sador of the Malmori?

339
00:35:22,269 --> 00:35:24,269
It's who we're fighting against.

340
00:35:25,076 --> 00:35:25,982
Quopeg!

341
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:32,336
So, Sador lives, does he?
Your ship will need some repair.

342
00:35:32,502 --> 00:35:37,525
Quopeg, cut the Zime loose.
We cruise for Akir!

343
00:35:47,475 --> 00:35:51,810
<i>We're being pulled in by something.
Feels like a magnetic net. Look, sector 2.</i>

344
00:35:55,995 --> 00:35:57,980
Damn it. Prepare full thrust.
We'll break loose.

345
00:35:58,034 --> 00:36:00,604
<i>I'm not strong.
Remember the Varda.</i>

346
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,659
What about the Varda?

347
00:36:06,579 --> 00:36:09,143
<i>- Think. What would the Varda say?
- Nell!</i>

348
00:36:09,188 --> 00:36:13,203
<i>To use greater strength against itself.
It's our only hope, kid.</i>

349
00:36:15,554 --> 00:36:19,719
All right, big mouth. Change
course, right into their laps.

350
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:47,487
Okay, what's the big idea?

351
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,286
Don't everybody talk at once.

352
00:37:00,737 --> 00:37:04,901
Listen, if I don't get some answers fast,
I'm going to have to use this thing.

353
00:37:20,948 --> 00:37:22,948
Let me rephrase that.

354
00:37:32,699 --> 00:37:34,739
You are not of a violent form.

355
00:37:36,174 --> 00:37:38,469
We sensed that you did not intend to shoot.

356
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,799
You read my mind?

357
00:37:41,802 --> 00:37:45,712
Among other things. We have
monitored your travels.

358
00:37:45,973 --> 00:37:49,239
You are seeking mercenaries
for an adventure.

359
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,643
We would like to participate.

360
00:37:54,767 --> 00:37:56,767
Well, we can't offer much in payment.

361
00:37:57,239 --> 00:38:01,410
No need. We are self-sufficient.
We are Nestor.

362
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:04,141
All of you?

363
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:07,393
This is but a facet.
These are but facets.

364
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:12,885
There are hundreds of thousands like us at home
and scattered throughout the universe.

365
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:15,083
We are Nestor.

366
00:38:15,176 --> 00:38:16,654
You're clones.

367
00:38:16,972 --> 00:38:21,808
In a manner of speaking.
We share identical consciousness.

368
00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:26,538
What one sees, all see.
What one knows, all know.

369
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,395
And all of you want to help us?

370
00:38:28,466 --> 00:38:30,653
These five facets, yes.

371
00:38:30,718 --> 00:38:33,074
Four of us are required
to operate this ship.

372
00:38:33,121 --> 00:38:35,756
- What about the fifth?
- We always carry a spare.

373
00:38:37,551 --> 00:38:38,821
Thank you.

374
00:38:38,938 --> 00:38:44,095
You see, there is only one
Nestor. One consciousness.

375
00:38:44,223 --> 00:38:47,348
As you might imagine,
this is proving very lonely.

376
00:38:47,493 --> 00:38:51,375
Very dull. We must avoid becoming...

377
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:54,420
We believe you have a phrase for it.

378
00:38:54,483 --> 00:38:57,714
...becoming "bored to death".

379
00:39:03,932 --> 00:39:07,792
Look, Kalo. Females.

380
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:11,276
<i>A bonding approved for procreation.</i>

381
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:15,325
A bonding conceived in the
face of our present crisis.

382
00:39:16,052 --> 00:39:18,347
We're supposed to guard the planet.

383
00:39:19,817 --> 00:39:21,817
Where is it gonna go?

384
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:24,840
Come on, let's do it!

385
00:39:25,131 --> 00:39:27,496
It would make you happy, wouldn't it?

386
00:39:27,595 --> 00:39:30,673
What the hell, they're only Akira.

387
00:39:42,458 --> 00:39:44,090
Everybody scatter!

388
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:52,898
Beam her up, Kalo. Beam her up!

389
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:13,810
<i>In the old days Nascosto was one of the
wildest cities in the Smilax System.</i>

390
00:40:14,038 --> 00:40:19,178
<i>Freebooters, outlaws, adventurers. If you're
looking for mercenaries, that's the place.</i>

391
00:40:19,251 --> 00:40:21,251
Doesn't look like much of a city to me.

392
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:22,929
<i>It's all under the surface.</i>

393
00:40:22,969 --> 00:40:25,211
<i>The weather is a bit touchy up on top.</i>

394
00:40:25,242 --> 00:40:30,312
<i>There are tornadoes and radiation storms every
couple of days. Keeps the tourists away.</i>

395
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:27,969
Who sent you?

396
00:43:29,555 --> 00:43:33,226
I'm on a mission for the people of Akir.

397
00:43:33,979 --> 00:43:36,019
I'm hiring mercenaries.

398
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:39,794
I was told that there would
be many on Nascosto.

399
00:43:41,245 --> 00:43:48,604
You're a little late. There's nothing
left but me and the lower forms.

400
00:43:53,232 --> 00:43:55,006
What happened here?

401
00:43:55,551 --> 00:43:59,051
The other planets in the galaxy
formed a protective association.

402
00:43:59,653 --> 00:44:02,458
They raised an army and cleaned us out.

403
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:05,542
We made them nervous.

404
00:44:07,104 --> 00:44:08,636
But you stayed.

405
00:44:10,733 --> 00:44:12,800
I came back for a rest.

406
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:17,602
There's not a planet in the galaxy
where there isn't a bounty on my head.

407
00:44:18,336 --> 00:44:20,157
What makes you so popular?

408
00:44:21,496 --> 00:44:25,003
I settle disputes, very quickly.

409
00:44:25,053 --> 00:44:28,723
I'm very good at it.
I don't care who I work with.

410
00:44:29,075 --> 00:44:31,710
I've collected a lot of
enemies along the way.

411
00:44:32,824 --> 00:44:34,753
You kill for a pay?

412
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:38,948
I have no home,
no family, no principles.

413
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,240
What else would I kill for?

414
00:44:43,223 --> 00:44:45,223
- Pleasure?
- No.

415
00:44:46,185 --> 00:44:48,185
It's strictly business with me.

416
00:44:49,313 --> 00:44:52,891
Now, what's your pitch?

417
00:44:55,514 --> 00:44:59,142
I'm hiring mercenaries to
protect against an invasion.

418
00:45:01,713 --> 00:45:06,426
But food and shelter is all
we can offer in payment.

419
00:45:06,456 --> 00:45:09,091
All of our wealth is in our culture.

420
00:45:11,647 --> 00:45:15,982
I could buy your planet ten times over
with what I've gathered in this room.

421
00:45:17,466 --> 00:45:23,222
Plutonium, cadmium, Qualine crystals...

422
00:45:25,666 --> 00:45:27,752
I've been very well paid for my work.

423
00:45:32,064 --> 00:45:33,899
I'm sorry to have wasted your time.

424
00:45:33,961 --> 00:45:36,046
No. Wait.

425
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,100
Listen to the rest of it.

426
00:45:40,397 --> 00:45:43,372
I sleep with my back to the wall

427
00:45:43,682 --> 00:45:46,147
when I can sleep.

428
00:45:46,693 --> 00:45:49,115
I eat serpent seven times a week.

429
00:45:52,138 --> 00:45:56,622
There's not a major city in this galaxy where
I can show my face or spend my wealth.

430
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:01,006
Right now your offer looks
very attractive to me.

431
00:46:07,078 --> 00:46:09,078
A meal, a place to hide.

432
00:46:20,906 --> 00:46:22,349
So what do you think of him?

433
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:25,219
<i>He'll fight all right,
but he'll fight alone.</i>

434
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:27,678
I don't care, just so long as he'll fight.

435
00:46:27,748 --> 00:46:30,623
<i>Don't worry, he'll be pointed
in the right direction.</i>

436
00:46:31,116 --> 00:46:32,202
Wait a minute.

437
00:46:33,494 --> 00:46:34,361
What is it?

438
00:46:34,408 --> 00:46:37,845
<i>I don't know, but it's right in my flight path.
It could be a mercenary answering your call.</i>

439
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:39,650
A mercenary in that pea shooter?

440
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:42,563
<i>Listen, kid. In some galaxies,
that would be a big ship.</i>

441
00:46:42,569 --> 00:46:45,889
<i>Thalians aren't much bigger than your
hand, but they're some bad customers.</i>

442
00:46:45,942 --> 00:46:48,102
Well whoever he is, I don't
have time to play with him.

443
00:46:49,215 --> 00:46:50,950
<i>- Put up the force field.
- What?</i>

444
00:46:51,012 --> 00:46:53,012
<i>Put up the force field, hurry!</i>

445
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:56,579
<i>- What the hell is it?
- A challenge.</i>

446
00:46:56,619 --> 00:46:57,267
What?

447
00:46:57,331 --> 00:47:00,970
<i>It seems he don't think this galaxy
is big enough for the both of you.</i>

448
00:47:03,908 --> 00:47:05,774
He's completely outmatched.
He must know that.

449
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,157
<i>Don't lower the force field.
It's too fast for you to hit!</i>

450
00:47:08,227 --> 00:47:10,602
<i>- But he keeps coming at me.
- Ignore it.</i>

451
00:47:10,625 --> 00:47:13,391
<i>It can't hurt to forget about it.
That's what the Varda says.</i>

452
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:14,758
I want a shot at him, Nell.

453
00:47:14,797 --> 00:47:18,317
<i>You shoot down a couple of Jackers and all of
a sudden you're the scourge of outer space.</i>

454
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,212
Will you just shut up
and help me fight him?

455
00:47:20,305 --> 00:47:24,765
<i>Help yourself. You're being sucked in,
can't you see he's just playing with you?</i>

456
00:47:36,657 --> 00:47:38,142
What is it? What's happening?

457
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:39,891
<i>- A blank.
- A what?</i>

458
00:47:39,948 --> 00:47:45,541
<i>Soft light, no heat. I'm not damaged.
I have a transmission.</i>

459
00:47:46,638 --> 00:47:48,638
<i>I am Saint Exmin of the Valkiri.</i>

460
00:47:49,169 --> 00:47:53,255
<i>I have come to coo upon you.
It was a very enjoyable fight.</i>

461
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:54,982
Enjoyable fight?

462
00:47:55,115 --> 00:47:57,474
<i>But then all fighting is enjoyable.</i>

463
00:47:57,518 --> 00:48:00,748
I have heard of your battle with
the Malmori. I wish to join you.

464
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:03,963
Oh yes? What are you going to do?
Shoot blanks at Sador?

465
00:48:04,091 --> 00:48:06,598
The Valkiri are great warriors.

466
00:48:06,644 --> 00:48:10,542
In our youth, we must leave home and fight in
many battles until we have proven ourselves.

467
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:14,744
Well you've proven yourself to be a pain in
the neck, so why don't you just fly off?

468
00:48:14,842 --> 00:48:17,178
But I wish to fight.

469
00:48:17,212 --> 00:48:19,969
My planet is in danger and
you're playing tag with me.

470
00:48:20,032 --> 00:48:23,001
Your ship is like a toy.
You have no firepower.

471
00:48:23,036 --> 00:48:25,331
It's one of the fastest in the universe.

472
00:48:25,554 --> 00:48:28,529
Well the Varda teach us that
swift rain is little rain.

473
00:48:28,846 --> 00:48:30,585
<i>But I want to join.</i>

474
00:48:30,611 --> 00:48:33,751
But we don't want you. We don't
need you and we won't have you.

475
00:48:33,779 --> 00:48:36,571
So go count your coo somewhere else.

476
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,457
<i>You were a little harsh weren't you?</i>

477
00:48:40,778 --> 00:48:42,458
You saw her. She was playing with me.

478
00:48:42,536 --> 00:48:44,746
<i>Yes, and she won.</i>

479
00:48:46,573 --> 00:48:49,293
Would you like me to short
circuit your audio?

480
00:48:54,518 --> 00:48:55,690
<i>Shad to Cowboy.</i>

481
00:48:56,538 --> 00:48:58,833
<i>Chad to Cowboy. Come in, Cowboy.</i>

482
00:48:59,296 --> 00:49:01,116
<i>Cowboy, are you there?</i>

483
00:49:03,728 --> 00:49:06,532
Where've you been, Shad?
You're two Martinis late.

484
00:49:06,996 --> 00:49:09,550
I've got some help.
We'll meet in the Lambda Zone.

485
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:15,305
Is that real smoke you're
putting into your lungs?

486
00:49:15,666 --> 00:49:20,251
Yep. And before you ask, it is the
worst thing in the world for you.

487
00:49:21,247 --> 00:49:23,247
I don't think you should do it.

488
00:49:29,983 --> 00:49:32,302
Space Cowboy, meet Nestor.

489
00:49:35,512 --> 00:49:37,092
Welcome, Nestor.

490
00:49:37,115 --> 00:49:38,795
I'm from Earth. Ever hear of it?

491
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:41,060
<i>No, but we are pleased to meet you.</i>

492
00:49:41,098 --> 00:49:42,941
We? How many've you got in there?

493
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,045
I'll explain it to you later.

494
00:49:50,767 --> 00:49:52,907
<i>Here comes somebody else. Who's that?</i>

495
00:49:55,044 --> 00:49:56,525
Do you want your name used?

496
00:49:58,099 --> 00:49:59,685
My name is Gelt.

497
00:50:00,824 --> 00:50:04,879
Where are you from, Gelt?
I'm from Earth. Know where that is?

498
00:50:06,032 --> 00:50:08,196
I was born in space.

499
00:50:09,634 --> 00:50:10,579
Oh.

500
00:50:10,782 --> 00:50:14,165
Well, put him between us. I'll cover you.

501
00:50:15,687 --> 00:50:17,819
I don't like anyone behind me.

502
00:50:17,854 --> 00:50:20,444
<i>Okay. You keep a scanner on our tail.</i>

503
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,752
I always do.

504
00:50:38,464 --> 00:50:41,362
This is Cayman of the Lambda Zone.

505
00:50:41,878 --> 00:50:43,019
Thank you for...

506
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:48,085
Thank you for joining us.

507
00:50:48,936 --> 00:50:51,061
I'm only in this for Sador.

508
00:50:52,881 --> 00:50:54,881
I want his head.

509
00:50:56,049 --> 00:50:58,795
Oh, well you're welcome to it.

510
00:51:15,132 --> 00:51:16,882
There's someone following us.

511
00:51:22,006 --> 00:51:25,406
Just ignore it. Maybe she'll go away.

512
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,339
Well, you did all right, Shad.

513
00:51:31,485 --> 00:51:33,285
Turning loose for Akir.

514
00:52:25,817 --> 00:52:26,864
A party.

515
00:52:27,294 --> 00:52:28,357
Three.

516
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:29,466
Five.

517
00:52:29,606 --> 00:52:30,536
Six!

518
00:52:30,712 --> 00:52:31,494
Seven!

519
00:52:31,775 --> 00:52:33,775
Tembo, come on up here.

520
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,196
I'm busy.

521
00:52:35,238 --> 00:52:37,703
Forget about her. Something's coming.

522
00:52:39,366 --> 00:52:41,811
- What?
- Something's coming. Seven ships.

523
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:43,335
Seven.

524
00:52:43,401 --> 00:52:45,401
What do you think we should do?

525
00:52:46,258 --> 00:52:47,284
Run away?

526
00:52:47,642 --> 00:52:49,642
Good idea.

527
00:53:03,646 --> 00:53:04,732
Hurry.

528
00:53:08,527 --> 00:53:10,926
Hurry! It's gaining on us.

529
00:53:11,003 --> 00:53:13,143
They can't be! We're at full thrust!

530
00:53:21,934 --> 00:53:23,809
It's gaining on us!

531
00:53:23,847 --> 00:53:25,815
Tekias, turn and give me a shot at it!

532
00:53:25,877 --> 00:53:28,220
That's crazy! We do not know what is.

533
00:53:28,253 --> 00:53:29,448
- Get her off me!
- No!

534
00:53:29,535 --> 00:53:30,176
Get her off!

535
00:53:30,237 --> 00:53:32,276
Get her out of here! Get her out of here!

536
00:53:34,011 --> 00:53:35,566
We're losing speed.

537
00:53:35,637 --> 00:53:37,676
Turn around and face him.

538
00:53:45,613 --> 00:53:46,848
Beautiful.

539
00:53:48,234 --> 00:53:50,529
I love to see a pro at work.

540
00:53:51,366 --> 00:53:52,968
He's had a lot of practice.

541
00:53:52,983 --> 00:53:57,850
Nell, I think we may have bought ourselves
a chance. Let's head for the surface.

542
00:54:21,882 --> 00:54:25,272
Hail the conquering heroes.

543
00:54:26,814 --> 00:54:27,970
I'm sorry.

544
00:54:29,314 --> 00:54:30,650
I think they must be afraid.

545
00:54:30,735 --> 00:54:33,094
Afraid? Of what?

546
00:54:33,126 --> 00:54:37,149
Of you. They're not accustomed
to violence or violent forms.

547
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:38,940
That's a hell of a note.

548
00:54:39,472 --> 00:54:41,925
Welcome to Akir.

549
00:54:44,701 --> 00:54:46,560
Why have you been hiding?

550
00:54:48,206 --> 00:54:53,268
Why are you all afraid? I brought these beings to
save your lives. This is not the way to greet them.

551
00:54:54,534 --> 00:55:00,533
The Varda teach us to trust
first and judge later.

552
00:55:01,575 --> 00:55:03,785
I'm sorry for the reception you got.

553
00:55:06,484 --> 00:55:07,927
Welcome to our city,

554
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:10,999
defenders of Akir.

555
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:21,576
The warning system is operational.

556
00:55:21,786 --> 00:55:25,582
The Malmori should reach us within a
rotation and a half of this planet.

557
00:55:26,646 --> 00:55:29,899
We have only five fighting
ships against 25 of theirs.

558
00:55:30,464 --> 00:55:33,466
Our only hope is to try and knock
out the stellar converter.

559
00:55:33,535 --> 00:55:35,186
Is that possible?

560
00:55:35,262 --> 00:55:36,808
Watch the screen.

561
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:46,815
Like the rest of us, the Malmori ship has to
lower part of its force field in order to fire.

562
00:55:46,888 --> 00:55:50,768
When the stellar converter is about to be
activated the ship is extremely vulnerable.

563
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:54,410
Maximum spread capacity with an
open shield delivery system.

564
00:55:54,437 --> 00:55:59,651
Exactly. They never bring out the converter until
all opposition has been crushed by the fighters.

565
00:56:00,241 --> 00:56:05,580
Our job in the first contact will be to
strip the big ship of its protection.

566
00:56:06,348 --> 00:56:09,918
A vibration from the
sensor to dig the ditches.

567
00:56:09,981 --> 00:56:11,368
Another three degrees.

568
00:56:20,247 --> 00:56:23,129
Trenches, honey. We're gonna have a war.

569
00:56:24,489 --> 00:56:26,349
That's it, right there...

570
00:56:26,363 --> 00:56:30,783
<i>We're gonna create the galaxy's
biggest Malmori cemetery.</i>

571
00:57:11,812 --> 00:57:13,812
Pretty impressive.

572
00:57:15,322 --> 00:57:19,317
I've got some more surprises
for any visitors.

573
00:57:19,627 --> 00:57:21,320
What drink is that?

574
00:57:21,392 --> 00:57:25,165
Scotch and soda.

575
00:57:28,039 --> 00:57:30,476
I could do wonders with that boy.

576
00:57:30,523 --> 00:57:36,101
I would recharge his capacitators,
stimulate his solenoid.

577
00:57:36,147 --> 00:57:41,687
Tingle, dingle, dangle,
prangle his transistors...

578
00:57:45,203 --> 00:57:47,476
You know, sex.

579
00:57:49,023 --> 00:57:51,383
I can't imagine what it must be like.

580
00:57:51,521 --> 00:57:54,107
Stick with me. You'll get an education.

581
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:56,869
Guess so.

582
00:58:02,636 --> 00:58:06,307
<i>Flagship to Rear Guard 1. Do you read me?</i>

583
00:58:08,293 --> 00:58:11,754
<i>Flagship to Rear Guard 1. Do you read me?</i>

584
00:58:13,848 --> 00:58:16,183
<i>Kalo, Tembo, come in.</i>

585
00:58:17,808 --> 00:58:19,808
Could we possibly be out of range?

586
00:58:20,339 --> 00:58:24,113
Not at all, sir. Something must be wrong.

587
00:58:24,137 --> 00:58:28,590
What's wrong is that I have an
army full of genetic mistakes.

588
00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:31,805
Why can't my mutants be
intelligent like Eli?

589
00:58:31,978 --> 00:58:35,306
You can't expect us to
measure up to you, sir.

590
00:58:35,339 --> 00:58:39,334
Don't flatter me. Those two probably
slammed their ship into an asteroid.

591
00:58:39,698 --> 00:58:42,315
Or they may have been shot down.

592
00:58:42,348 --> 00:58:46,582
Shot down? How? Akir has
nothing to put in the air!

593
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:49,845
Somebody came to help them.

594
00:58:50,382 --> 00:58:52,382
Help Akir against me?

595
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:59,640
Nobody could be that stupid.
Not even Kalo and Tembo. Or you!

596
00:59:02,457 --> 00:59:04,862
<i>Do you think you could show me the ropes?</i>

597
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:09,129
Ropes?

598
00:59:09,143 --> 00:59:12,271
Well St. Exmin said...
Well she explained how on her planet...

599
00:59:13,611 --> 00:59:15,579
What do you do here?

600
00:59:15,618 --> 00:59:17,603
I don't understand.

601
00:59:17,657 --> 00:59:19,243
For procreation, I mean.

602
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:22,469
Oh.

603
00:59:23,797 --> 00:59:25,078
Well, it's...

604
00:59:25,445 --> 00:59:29,054
It's very simple, really.
Males and females...

605
00:59:29,085 --> 00:59:32,535
Only two sexes?
In Balandic it takes three.

606
00:59:32,710 --> 00:59:33,554
And Kitsel, they...

607
00:59:33,577 --> 00:59:36,436
Oh no, just two. Just males
and females, that's all.

608
00:59:38,264 --> 00:59:39,701
That's a relief.

609
00:59:41,216 --> 00:59:44,886
Well, maybe I... Maybe I
could show you the ropes.

610
00:59:45,765 --> 00:59:47,851
I've scanned information about mating.

611
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:50,619
Does your species have kissing?

612
00:59:51,526 --> 00:59:54,154
Oh yes, we have that.

613
01:00:07,386 --> 01:00:09,300
I think it's your torque bar.

614
01:00:10,636 --> 01:00:13,917
- My what?
- Your torque bar. It's slipped its groove.

615
01:00:14,623 --> 01:00:16,663
You're going to need a new one.

616
01:00:17,811 --> 01:00:18,811
Yes.

617
01:00:19,429 --> 01:00:21,584
Yes, I think probably you're right.

618
01:00:22,772 --> 01:00:24,389
A new one.

619
01:01:08,987 --> 01:01:11,088
What is that you're heating?

620
01:01:13,786 --> 01:01:15,393
That's a hot dog.

621
01:01:17,446 --> 01:01:20,337
It comes from Earth. Try one.

622
01:01:28,381 --> 01:01:31,561
- You like it?
- There's no dog in this.

623
01:01:32,654 --> 01:01:36,412
Hydrolysed vegetable
protein, soy bean meal,

624
01:01:36,496 --> 01:01:41,778
Niacin, dextrose and
sodium nitrate flavouring.

625
01:01:41,843 --> 01:01:44,873
That's what we call "meat" back home.

626
01:02:01,734 --> 01:02:05,461
Mister, are you a bad man?

627
01:02:07,370 --> 01:02:08,938
That's right.

628
01:02:08,967 --> 01:02:10,967
Why?

629
01:02:11,892 --> 01:02:13,978
I don't think the way you Akira do.

630
01:02:14,936 --> 01:02:17,522
If you think different, you get called bad.

631
01:02:19,191 --> 01:02:21,191
How do you feel?

632
01:02:22,789 --> 01:02:24,274
I don't.

633
01:02:24,382 --> 01:02:28,117
Mister, were you bad when you were little?

634
01:02:31,478 --> 01:02:33,478
I was never that little.

635
01:02:45,987 --> 01:02:49,377
All right, everybody. They're coming.
They've reached our checkpoints. Return to your ships.

636
01:02:49,501 --> 01:02:52,470
See you later, hot blood.

637
01:02:53,938 --> 01:02:56,305
Yeah, see you later, hot blood.

638
01:02:57,749 --> 01:03:00,225
- So long, good luck, partner.
- Thank you.

639
01:03:04,021 --> 01:03:06,911
Prep your thrusters, Nell.
I'm coming aboard.

640
01:03:21,577 --> 01:03:22,671
Loris.

641
01:03:24,686 --> 01:03:28,422
Won't you come with me?
You'd like it on Earth.

642
01:03:29,344 --> 01:03:30,414
Cowboy.

643
01:03:32,472 --> 01:03:36,127
Our outer-space alarm only works
at a distance of 3 millimarks.

644
01:03:37,003 --> 01:03:37,698
What?

645
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:43,905
Sador could see any lift-off.
He would destroy you.

646
01:03:47,046 --> 01:03:48,396
Wonderful.

647
01:03:49,562 --> 01:03:51,562
I like your company.

648
01:03:52,929 --> 01:03:53,983
Thanks.

649
01:03:59,648 --> 01:04:00,640
Well...

650
01:04:01,612 --> 01:04:03,409
Remember the Alamo.

651
01:04:03,463 --> 01:04:05,463
You forgot the ice and soda.

652
01:04:09,372 --> 01:04:10,713
No, no I didn't.

653
01:04:11,262 --> 01:04:14,722
Sir, something is approaching.

654
01:04:15,425 --> 01:04:17,425
It seems to be very small.

655
01:04:21,361 --> 01:04:23,656
Halt and be recognised.

656
01:04:25,219 --> 01:04:27,580
I am St. Exmin of the Valkiri.

657
01:04:30,379 --> 01:04:32,363
I am protector of this planet.

658
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:34,537
I order you to leave it in peace.

659
01:04:36,014 --> 01:04:38,224
Blast her out of space.

660
01:04:38,302 --> 01:04:41,692
Activate the drones. Prepare
to launch the surface attack.

661
01:04:41,747 --> 01:04:43,216
Sonic tank pruned.

662
01:05:40,977 --> 01:05:43,357
<i>All right, Shad, this one's ours.</i>

663
01:06:19,230 --> 01:06:21,120
<i>Attaboy, Shad.</i>

664
01:08:33,801 --> 01:08:35,785
<i>Uh-oh, nuclear missile.</i>

665
01:08:35,839 --> 01:08:38,792
<i>The only chance with these
babies is to outrun them.</i>

666
01:08:42,070 --> 01:08:44,609
<i>It's locked on to us.
You can't knock it out.</i>

667
01:08:45,819 --> 01:08:49,273
All right. Let's head for Sador.

668
01:09:31,756 --> 01:09:32,881
Gelt!

669
01:09:33,490 --> 01:09:36,639
<i>- Gelt, are you all right?
- That remains to be seen, Shad.</i>

670
01:09:37,930 --> 01:09:39,633
Have a nice fight.

671
01:10:01,315 --> 01:10:04,637
First unit! First unit, move out!

672
01:10:04,639 --> 01:10:08,072
Tank unit, stand by.
Repeat, stand by for orders.

673
01:10:08,262 --> 01:10:10,457
Char, check all systems.

674
01:10:10,718 --> 01:10:12,718
Second unit, move out.

675
01:10:13,382 --> 01:10:17,647
All right, boys. The sons of bitches have
landed. Section two. Get to your posts.

676
01:10:17,663 --> 01:10:20,429
Section five, next.
Section three, wait here.

677
01:10:21,456 --> 01:10:24,616
Move it! Kick ass, boys. Kick ass.

678
01:10:25,151 --> 01:10:26,261
Come on, move it.

679
01:10:26,925 --> 01:10:27,769
Move it.

680
01:10:28,269 --> 01:10:29,261
Move it!

681
01:10:53,253 --> 01:10:54,620
Sector two.

682
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:24,124
Retreat! Retreat! Retreat!

683
01:11:25,225 --> 01:11:28,194
Move the tank up. Move up the sonic tank!

684
01:11:49,706 --> 01:11:51,284
What the hell is that?

685
01:11:51,316 --> 01:11:55,566
Some sort of sonic weapon.
We can't defend against it.

686
01:11:55,592 --> 01:11:58,567
Maybe another rockslide'll stop it.
Come on.

687
01:12:05,626 --> 01:12:07,424
Sector three rock slide didn't work.

688
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:09,416
The sonar weapon is jamming the sensor.

689
01:12:09,442 --> 01:12:10,223
Fall back to section five.

690
01:12:10,251 --> 01:12:12,087
- We gotta get back. We'll all be killed, you hear me?
- Fall back to sector five!

691
01:12:12,127 --> 01:12:13,338
We will all be killed.

692
01:12:37,401 --> 01:12:41,589
A sonar tank. They're wearing sound
barriers in case they get in front of it.

693
01:12:41,666 --> 01:12:44,564
Even if we plug our ears,
we can't get any closer.

694
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:47,606
Will you two radiators stand back?
It's hard enough to think.

695
01:12:47,625 --> 01:12:49,774
It seems they're volunteering.

696
01:12:49,851 --> 01:12:50,906
Hell, what can they do?

697
01:12:50,911 --> 01:12:54,473
Well, for one thing, the
Kelvin have no ears.

698
01:13:33,825 --> 01:13:36,311
- They're cold.
- They've used all their energy.

699
01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:39,270
- Get them to the protein tank. Hurry.
- Come on, let's go.

700
01:13:41,129 --> 01:13:42,699
We got them now, boys.

701
01:13:51,368 --> 01:13:52,985
Let's go get them.

702
01:14:39,313 --> 01:14:40,641
What's the matter?

703
01:14:42,438 --> 01:14:45,040
What is it, Nell? What's the matter?

704
01:14:46,217 --> 01:14:49,532
<i>I'm okay now, Shad.
I... I received a transmission.</i>

705
01:14:51,319 --> 01:14:52,171
What is it?

706
01:14:53,798 --> 01:14:56,008
<i>Zed the Corsair has ended.</i>

707
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:04,298
I'm sorry.

708
01:15:05,826 --> 01:15:08,376
<i>He was the last of the great ones.</i>

709
01:15:42,032 --> 01:15:45,250
Shad, did you see me on the monitor?

710
01:15:45,315 --> 01:15:47,525
There was a drone right on my tail.

711
01:15:47,921 --> 01:15:51,788
I pulled out and he
smashed into an asteroid!

712
01:15:54,119 --> 01:15:56,119
Let me tell you something.

713
01:15:57,899 --> 01:15:59,899
This may just be a game to you

714
01:16:01,796 --> 01:16:03,796
but these are my people.

715
01:16:12,153 --> 01:16:15,199
I'm sorry. I forgot about your Varda.

716
01:16:15,226 --> 01:16:19,124
I am from a warrior race.
We exist for battle.

717
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:23,773
Our creed is to live fast, fight well
and have a beautiful ending.

718
01:16:24,005 --> 01:16:26,555
No violent ending is beautiful.

719
01:16:27,524 --> 01:16:30,244
You've never seen a Valkiri go down.

720
01:16:55,352 --> 01:16:56,422
Gelt.

721
01:17:00,446 --> 01:17:02,446
I had to move in.

722
01:17:03,566 --> 01:17:08,666
Half the universe trying to kill me
and I volunteered to be shot at.

723
01:17:08,709 --> 01:17:11,769
Just lie still. We've sent for a healer.

724
01:17:12,172 --> 01:17:14,172
What a place to end up.

725
01:17:15,270 --> 01:17:17,990
A minor planet in a third-rate galaxy.

726
01:17:43,188 --> 01:17:45,816
Have somebody prepare a meal.

727
01:17:45,846 --> 01:17:47,135
A meal?

728
01:17:47,758 --> 01:17:49,844
Full course, then bury it with him.

729
01:17:50,601 --> 01:17:51,835
Bury it?

730
01:17:53,389 --> 01:17:55,389
That was our arrangement.

731
01:17:55,940 --> 01:17:57,940
A meal and a place to hide.

732
01:18:07,703 --> 01:18:10,678
The facet that was left here
has arranged to be captured.

733
01:18:11,634 --> 01:18:15,969
What one sees, all see.
We'll be getting a picture soon.

734
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:23,780
Are you capable of speech?

735
01:18:24,055 --> 01:18:26,055
Yes, quite capable.

736
01:18:26,577 --> 01:18:27,546
Good!

737
01:18:28,703 --> 01:18:30,743
And do you have a high tolerance for pain?

738
01:18:31,555 --> 01:18:33,312
Almost none at all, I'm afraid.

739
01:18:33,351 --> 01:18:35,351
How unfortunate for you.

740
01:18:35,890 --> 01:18:38,100
How many ships do the Akira have

741
01:18:38,753 --> 01:18:41,971
and what are their capabilities?

742
01:18:43,096 --> 01:18:46,666
If I told you that, I would
give you an unfair advantage.

743
01:18:49,675 --> 01:18:52,745
This is my surgeon, Dako.

744
01:18:54,361 --> 01:18:58,042
Dako is expert at inflicting pain

745
01:18:59,654 --> 01:19:02,034
while keeping the patient alive.

746
01:19:03,305 --> 01:19:05,345
It's good to have skills.

747
01:19:05,550 --> 01:19:08,015
You won't give us the information?

748
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:09,675
No.

749
01:19:12,103 --> 01:19:14,103
I think you will.

750
01:19:14,917 --> 01:19:15,933
Dako.

751
01:19:16,933 --> 01:19:18,464
Lord Sador.

752
01:19:37,191 --> 01:19:42,215
It is true we cannot tolerate pain.
That facet has ended.

753
01:19:47,376 --> 01:19:50,102
He's dead, Lord Sador, yet he gave
no indication of terminating.

754
01:19:50,125 --> 01:19:51,306
Just give me the arm.

755
01:19:51,405 --> 01:19:53,405
The arm! Hurry!

756
01:20:12,747 --> 01:20:13,981
It is ready.

757
01:20:22,403 --> 01:20:24,067
You're an artist, Dako.

758
01:20:24,098 --> 01:20:26,051
- Thank you, Lord Sador.
- An artist.

759
01:20:27,885 --> 01:20:30,619
But when we conquer Akir
and we have some time...

760
01:20:31,795 --> 01:20:33,835
you must do something about this.

761
01:20:41,149 --> 01:20:43,444
- What's wrong?
- I don't know, my Lord.

762
01:20:51,103 --> 01:20:51,852
I can't control my arm.

763
01:20:51,884 --> 01:20:56,259
- No! Lord Sador! No!
- I can't stop it!

764
01:21:02,493 --> 01:21:03,415
Drop the...

765
01:21:03,493 --> 01:21:04,907
No!

766
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:09,225
- Cut it! Cut it!
- We must!

767
01:21:09,445 --> 01:21:10,265
Hurry.

768
01:21:10,359 --> 01:21:12,554
- Now!
- Cut it!

769
01:21:12,994 --> 01:21:14,158
Cut the arm.

770
01:21:22,153 --> 01:21:23,681
We have failed.

771
01:21:26,231 --> 01:21:27,674
We've had it.

772
01:21:27,953 --> 01:21:31,351
The Valkiri never admit defeat, ever.

773
01:21:32,705 --> 01:21:34,330
I don't know about the rest.

774
01:21:37,761 --> 01:21:42,181
While life exists, the
possibilities are unlimited.

775
01:21:52,647 --> 01:21:53,811
Shad?

776
01:21:58,531 --> 01:22:00,656
I never should've brought you here.

777
01:22:01,534 --> 01:22:03,394
Your father was right.

778
01:22:03,705 --> 01:22:05,032
I want to go up there with you.

779
01:22:06,856 --> 01:22:08,126
It's my life.

780
01:22:09,176 --> 01:22:11,556
I can risk it if I want to.

781
01:22:12,578 --> 01:22:15,978
Besides, I could help you up there.

782
01:22:20,967 --> 01:22:24,279
You know, I shouldn't say this...

783
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:28,445
But I really want you up there with me.

784
01:22:32,579 --> 01:22:33,931
I'm terrified.

785
01:22:35,754 --> 01:22:36,886
So am I.

786
01:22:38,969 --> 01:22:40,558
We'll be together.

787
01:22:41,637 --> 01:22:42,848
Okay?

788
01:22:45,606 --> 01:22:46,731
Okay.

789
01:22:59,093 --> 01:23:01,788
<i>Terrific. Now I've got
two babies to sit for.</i>

790
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:04,414
Nell, shut up.

791
01:23:17,148 --> 01:23:21,570
Prepare all ships for a full-scale attack.

792
01:23:23,388 --> 01:23:25,473
Make them burn.

793
01:23:26,896 --> 01:23:28,341
Burn!

794
01:25:40,636 --> 01:25:43,781
Nestor is hit. Repeat, Nestor is hit!

795
01:26:01,364 --> 01:26:06,044
Ready the stellar converter.
Fix on the planet Akir.

796
01:26:11,917 --> 01:26:14,268
He's bringing out the stellar converter.

797
01:26:22,359 --> 01:26:23,679
You pretty thing.

798
01:26:48,615 --> 01:26:51,787
Lower the force field and prepare to fire.

799
01:26:51,842 --> 01:26:54,412
- But sir, they...
- Lower the force field!

800
01:27:25,813 --> 01:27:27,422
Fire on the planet.

801
01:27:28,694 --> 01:27:30,262
I said fire.

802
01:27:30,276 --> 01:27:32,571
It won't fire. It has been damaged!

803
01:27:43,711 --> 01:27:46,643
I am St. Exmin of the Valkiri.

804
01:27:46,674 --> 01:27:48,823
It has been a very enjoyable fight.

805
01:28:00,843 --> 01:28:04,838
"Live fast, fight well and
have a beautiful ending."

806
01:28:04,873 --> 01:28:09,771
All drones protect the formation.
Retreat behind the sun.

807
01:28:13,921 --> 01:28:16,014
Rotate engines 180 degrees.

808
01:28:20,788 --> 01:28:21,999
Well, well.

809
01:28:38,553 --> 01:28:41,725
Sador, this is Cayman of the Lambda Zone.

810
01:28:43,208 --> 01:28:47,378
Turn around, you overreached
degenerate and we'll bump heads.

811
01:28:49,623 --> 01:28:51,544
What do you make our force field at?

812
01:28:52,314 --> 01:28:53,757
10/6.

813
01:28:53,895 --> 01:28:55,551
And what do you make his at?

814
01:28:57,016 --> 01:28:59,821
It's an Elitrian Zimer. 10/2.

815
01:29:01,479 --> 01:29:03,751
Of what form are you, Cayman?

816
01:29:03,806 --> 01:29:05,592
I am of the Lazuli.

817
01:29:05,663 --> 01:29:10,444
I thought I had the honour of
making that form extinct long ago.

818
01:29:11,098 --> 01:29:13,308
I won't fail this time.

819
01:29:13,762 --> 01:29:17,433
Here I come, Cayman of the Lambda Zone.

820
01:29:39,014 --> 01:29:42,021
Sador, you son of a bitch.

821
01:29:42,106 --> 01:29:45,904
Here I come. This is Space Cowboy,
from the planet Earth.

822
01:30:24,836 --> 01:30:27,406
♪ String for my baby ♪

823
01:31:07,687 --> 01:31:09,687
About 30 seconds to impact.

824
01:31:31,071 --> 01:31:33,366
He didn't want to fight

825
01:31:34,606 --> 01:31:36,606
but it came anyway.

826
01:31:46,527 --> 01:31:55,784
Lazuli!

827
01:32:17,568 --> 01:32:22,006
I've gotta get him. He'll come back with
more ships. We'll never be done fighting.

828
01:32:22,069 --> 01:32:24,055
<i>I'm no match for his force field, Shad.</i>

829
01:32:24,087 --> 01:32:26,144
I don't care, Nell. I want a shot at him.

830
01:32:27,472 --> 01:32:29,472
If we go for him, he just might open up.

831
01:32:29,768 --> 01:32:30,713
Shad.

832
01:32:32,604 --> 01:32:34,604
Give me full thrust, Nell.

833
01:32:34,752 --> 01:32:38,407
<i>Think of Varda, Shad.
What is the first law of the Varda?</i>

834
01:32:45,849 --> 01:32:47,153
Don't worry. There's four of them.

835
01:32:47,203 --> 01:32:50,963
- Coming up on the left! Look out!
- Coming up on the left! Take me 3 points to the left, Nell.

836
01:32:51,881 --> 01:32:54,672
Roger. Take me two points to the right.
Two points to the right, Nell.

837
01:32:54,704 --> 01:32:56,243
Now drop me two. Drop me two!

838
01:33:01,931 --> 01:33:03,071
Shad, look!

839
01:33:04,509 --> 01:33:06,048
I got you now.

840
01:33:13,487 --> 01:33:14,471
Oh, no.

841
01:33:22,469 --> 01:33:24,469
Shad, are you all right?

842
01:33:27,355 --> 01:33:30,416
- I think so. Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

843
01:33:30,937 --> 01:33:32,937
Nell, what's your status?

844
01:33:34,073 --> 01:33:35,811
Damage report, Nell.

845
01:33:35,971 --> 01:33:38,017
<i>Um, what did you say?</i>

846
01:33:38,095 --> 01:33:39,579
Damage report, Nell.

847
01:33:39,929 --> 01:33:41,929
<i>Who's that?</i>

848
01:33:42,977 --> 01:33:44,977
You'd better check her functions.

849
01:33:46,250 --> 01:33:48,594
Nell, it's Shad. Are you damaged?

850
01:33:50,608 --> 01:33:53,046
<i>Shad? I don't know a Shad.</i>

851
01:33:53,131 --> 01:33:57,296
Her motor functions are intact, but I'm
getting nothing from her memory banks.

852
01:34:00,776 --> 01:34:02,222
<i>Who's that girl?</i>

853
01:34:02,253 --> 01:34:03,901
You'd better switch to manual.

854
01:34:03,922 --> 01:34:05,698
<i>Zed. Is Zed there?</i>

855
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:07,760
I'm switching to manual, Nell.

856
01:34:12,384 --> 01:34:14,266
It is the last one, sir.

857
01:34:16,276 --> 01:34:17,719
What is it?

858
01:34:18,202 --> 01:34:23,077
It's an old corsair. By the way
it moves we must've crippled it.

859
01:34:23,610 --> 01:34:25,905
Bring it in on the tractor beam.

860
01:34:27,173 --> 01:34:30,297
I want them taken aboard alive.

861
01:34:32,946 --> 01:34:36,110
Akir is mine.

862
01:34:50,984 --> 01:34:55,257
Damn it! Damn it, the guns are all locked off.
Nell, can you do anything at all?

863
01:34:55,296 --> 01:34:58,782
<i>I don't know. It's kind of fuzzy.
If I could just remember...</i>

864
01:34:58,836 --> 01:35:00,304
We can't let them take us.

865
01:35:00,342 --> 01:35:03,367
Don't worry. I'll blow the ship first.

866
01:35:06,292 --> 01:35:08,917
<i>The first law of Varda is...</i>

867
01:35:08,966 --> 01:35:12,763
First law of the Varda is to use
greater force against itself.

868
01:35:13,828 --> 01:35:17,359
Nanelia, watch the field sensors.

869
01:35:19,081 --> 01:35:23,161
And then reverse the thrusters.
We're going right for him.

870
01:35:38,275 --> 01:35:39,134
They...

871
01:35:39,783 --> 01:35:41,993
They have reversed thrusters.

872
01:35:43,038 --> 01:35:44,936
Just keep the beam on them.

873
01:35:52,260 --> 01:35:53,829
They'll be able to board us.

874
01:35:53,882 --> 01:35:55,421
It won't make any difference.

875
01:36:02,969 --> 01:36:05,476
There they are, at the forward deck.

876
01:36:05,508 --> 01:36:07,203
Get up there. I want them alive.

877
01:36:07,242 --> 01:36:08,211
Go!

878
01:36:08,641 --> 01:36:09,868
Let's go!

879
01:36:11,754 --> 01:36:14,453
Nell, I'm going to program
you to self-destruct.

880
01:36:14,477 --> 01:36:17,367
Maybe we can blow that converter back on.
Nanelia?

881
01:36:17,618 --> 01:36:18,751
Right, Shad.

882
01:36:18,789 --> 01:36:20,375
<i>We go back a long way, Zed.</i>

883
01:36:20,412 --> 01:36:21,693
Can you do it, Nell?

884
01:36:21,742 --> 01:36:25,515
<i>Sure. Just get yourselves into the
projectile and I'll shoot you out of here.</i>

885
01:36:25,578 --> 01:36:26,836
Projectile?

886
01:36:26,838 --> 01:36:29,383
<i>Don't think I'm gonna destruct
with you still inside here.</i>

887
01:36:29,411 --> 01:36:33,668
Get that hatch open. Now! Now!

888
01:36:33,699 --> 01:36:35,863
Just give us enough time
to get clear, Nell.

889
01:36:35,933 --> 01:36:37,089
And then let them have it.

890
01:36:37,118 --> 01:36:39,118
<i>30 seconds and counting, Zed.</i>

891
01:36:39,494 --> 01:36:42,761
<i>29, 28, 27,</i>

892
01:36:42,784 --> 01:36:46,252
<i>24, 15, 22...</i>

893
01:36:46,297 --> 01:36:48,117
<i>Did I... Did I say 15?</i>

894
01:36:48,149 --> 01:36:50,149
Why don't you just start from 10, Nell?

895
01:36:51,062 --> 01:36:55,140
<i>- So long, Zed.
- So long, Nell.</i>

896
01:36:55,238 --> 01:36:59,749
<i>9, 11, 13,</i>

897
01:36:59,788 --> 01:37:00,288
<i>14...</i>

898
01:37:05,218 --> 01:37:09,014
<i>15, 12, 9,</i>

899
01:37:12,796 --> 01:37:16,999
<i>14, 15, 16...</i>

900
01:37:23,531 --> 01:37:26,562
This is Sador of the Malmori.

901
01:37:27,130 --> 01:37:29,578
I command you to surrender.

902
01:37:30,421 --> 01:37:33,226
<i>I'll surrender, you sorry son of a mutant.</i>

903
01:37:33,843 --> 01:37:36,413
<i>5, 4...</i>

904
01:37:40,856 --> 01:37:43,239
Route it to the converter access.

905
01:37:43,254 --> 01:37:45,902
It's going to blow. We're all gonna die.

906
01:37:45,939 --> 01:37:47,965
That can't be.

907
01:37:48,023 --> 01:37:49,644
I'm going to live forever.

908
01:38:02,442 --> 01:38:04,481
I want to live forever.

909
01:38:20,465 --> 01:38:22,465
We did it.

910
01:38:23,356 --> 01:38:26,902
I can't believe it. We really did it.

911
01:38:31,649 --> 01:38:34,673
But St. Exmin, and Cowboy,

912
01:38:34,701 --> 01:38:36,396
Nanelia,

913
01:38:37,935 --> 01:38:45,161
The Akira believe that no form ends until all
the lives that it has touched are ended.

914
01:38:45,870 --> 01:38:48,590
Until all the good that
it has done is gone.

915
01:38:50,923 --> 01:38:52,963
They are now a part of Akir

916
01:38:54,882 --> 01:38:56,882
and they'll always be with us.
