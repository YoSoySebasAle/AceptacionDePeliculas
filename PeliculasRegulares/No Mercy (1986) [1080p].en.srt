1
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,147
May the force be
with you, spaceman.

2
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,656
Get the fuck out of here.

3
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:46,121
Dude drives a $50,000
wheel and lays a cuter on me.

4
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,032
I can do better than this cleaning
the crap out of cuckoo clocks.

5
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:50,813
Eddie: What the hell am I
supposed to do with this anyway?

6
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,919
Take your family
out to dinner with this?

7
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:55,175
You have the wrong attitude
about this job, Eddie.

8
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,666
You gotta appreciate
the zen aspects of this.

9
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,426
Eddie: Zen aspect?
What's a zen aspect?

10
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,962
Joe, you holding out on me?

11
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,051
No

12
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,536
You doing reefer
for the brothers,

13
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,266
or is the old lady
on her mood cycle again?

14
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,427
Why do you ask
something like that?

15
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:13,144
Because once a month without
fail you get bullshit philosophical on me.

16
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,934
Yeah, well, that's what happens
when you're married, Eddie.

17
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:17,548
Didn't that happen to you
when you were married?

18
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:20,359
No, no, no ways. I'm an
old-fashioned kind of guy.

19
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:23,019
I'd go to the cubs game and get drunk.
Miss the whole thing.

20
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,246
Yeah, maybe that's why
you're not married anymore.

21
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,492
Angles Ryan again.
Third time today.

22
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,331
Fourth you were in the can

23
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,127
Joe: Isn't that
white fang talking to him?

24
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:40,463
Yeah, he got the teeth
on a postal rap.

25
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,402
Yeah, the feds are good
about dental work.

26
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,222
Bring it in, come on.

27
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:49,009
A little more. A little more.
Okay, put it in neutral.

28
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,957
You want the super spray
wax special with the

29
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:52,792
with the non dissolving lacto
rust-o-protector...

30
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,602
Just a regular wash. Thank you.

31
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,569
Want me to do the ashtray?

32
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:02,026
I don't smoke. Get out of here.

33
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,962
Going down, Joe, I know it.

34
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,466
If we get them after the exchange, they're
gonna cop possession without intent.

35
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:23,971
What are you doing?

36
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,471
Joe,

37
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,634
I hope you appreciate the zen
aspects of what I'm about to do.

38
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:32,598
Oh, Jesus.

39
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,438
Police!

40
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,015
Ryan: What the... what the fuck?

41
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,143
What's the matter with you?
What are you doing?

42
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,189
Eddie: Police! Open up!
Open up! Ryan: Oh my god!

43
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:44,698
Chicago police department!

44
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,512
Get the fuck out of here!
What are you, nuts?

45
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,696
Joe, get the bag.

46
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,987
Chicago police department!
You're under arrest!

47
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,030
Get your hands of me.
Put it in there!

48
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,575
Get that out of here!
What's wrong with you?

49
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,038
Eddie: You're gonna destroy my interior!
I'll kill you.

50
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,540
I'll fuck you up now, boy!

51
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,217
Eddie: Let go, Ryan! Let go.
This is it.

52
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:09,089
I give a fuck. Give me the keys!

53
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,973
Fucking, give me the
goddamn keys, Ryan!

54
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:22,947
Get out of the car!

55
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,026
Let's go!
Let's go! Come on! Come on!

56
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,565
Let's go!

57
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,449
Get out of the fucking car.

58
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,465
Get out of the fucking...
Get them up there!

59
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:32,036
You got a piece?

60
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,367
Down! Down! Down!

61
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:35,658
Down!

62
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:37,481
You fucking move,
and you're dead meat!

63
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,671
It's grass. Rich!

64
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,425
Joe: All we got is grass.

65
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,311
Rat shit.

66
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,436
Three frigging days I'm
out there washing cars.

67
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,479
You disrespect
me with this shit?

68
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:07,783
We're sending you up.

69
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,191
Hard time, Ryan.

70
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,814
Come on.
It was less than a pound.

71
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,408
That is a felony, dipshit!

72
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,197
You're a three time loser.

73
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,491
Ryan: Take it easy.
Take it easy.

74
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,398
You guys. What's the matter with you?
You are playing it all wrong.

75
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:21,942
One of you guys is
supposed to be nice.

76
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:25,090
You know. You're both not
supposed to be hard.

77
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,218
Hard? Hard...

78
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,424
Ryan, you don't know
what hard is.

79
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,444
You're going to the joint
with the brothers.

80
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,263
You know what they're gonna
do to your ass?

81
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,482
Come on, hey, 3
little bit of reefer was

82
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,267
sit down!

83
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,852
Take it easy, will you?

84
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:42,811
What you guys wanna make a deal?

85
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,773
That's it? All right.
I'll give you something.

86
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,872
I'll give you something.
Let's see. I got a...

87
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:52,158
Got a record store. They got hot tvs.
They got stereos.

88
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,866
You give me a two bit fence
after making me wash cars?

89
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,684
You know what the fuck
that does to me?

90
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,539
I can think of
bookies and pimps!

91
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,417
You're a jerk! You're doing
hard time for pushing smoke!

92
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:02,873
Six years, minimum!

93
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,797
No, wait, wait a minute, eh!

94
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,839
You guys can't put me away. I got
freckles, for Christ's sakes!

95
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,542
Eh, you want something? I got
something for you! I got a hit!

96
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,599
They want me to kill somebody.

97
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,139
Yeah. You?

98
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,442
Who's the target?

99
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,442
I don't know

100
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:27,924
don't insult our intelligence.

101
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,155
A guy from New Orleans. I swear.

102
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,315
He wants me to whack
some guy out. Real bad.

103
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,899
I'm supposed to
meet him tonight.

104
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:38,298
This guy from New Orleans,
he knows your face?

105
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:43,991
This has gotta be
worth something.

106
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,543
Where's the meeting?

107
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:54,555
Meeting's tonight at
the stockyard inn at 9:00.

108
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:58,307
He's gonna be with a girl.
A real heart stopper.

109
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,810
She's got a tattoo on her shoulder.
That's all I know.

110
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,024
Ryan: Oh! Hello!

111
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,817
My hat! My cigarettes! Hey!

112
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,290
Why don't we check out that
New Orleans guys ourselves?

113
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,576
Come on, I'm tired.
I wanna go home.

114
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,245
What's so great
about going home...

115
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,709
Rust ferry bongo player in
the rack with your old lady?

116
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:31,802
She's not like that.

117
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:32,886
No she's not like that

118
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:35,216
my wife...

119
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,243
Left a type written note on
the refrigerator door saying

120
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,508
she was leaving
so she could breathe.

121
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,789
Yeah, yeah. Last time it was
on the bathroom mirror.

122
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,849
And the time before that was
on the screen door.

123
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:44,763
Get your facts straight,
jillette

124
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,806
I don't believe this

125
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,671
I'm trying to share a valuable,
personal experience with you.

126
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,231
You finger fuck me with details.

127
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,486
Don't drink my coffee
from my cup, jillette!

128
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,949
I swear, I met a
better type of cop in vice.

129
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,608
Crabs, big d and gonorrhea,
that's all I had to worry about.

130
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,332
All I did was use your cup,
stemkowski.

131
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,707
Captain stemkowski!

132
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,792
What the hell are you
so mad about?

133
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,470
I was meditating this morning...

134
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,006
Feeling real good about myself.

135
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,849
What happens?

136
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,559
Car washes happen!

137
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:30,579
They're trying to pass that balloon
robot at office as a work of art!

138
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:33,486
Captain, we gotta talk to you.

139
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:36,774
Why should I talk to you after
that chicken shit stakeout?

140
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,568
What do you want? Overtime?

141
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:40,530
A hundred grand, jillette.

142
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,910
A hundred?

143
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,744
That's what he wants
for that piece of shit.

144
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,438
Guy wants to go to Florida and retire
with a bag of oranges in his lap.

145
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,123
Forget it! Captain?

146
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,295
Come on, let's do it ourselves.

147
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,955
Blow off some steam.
Have some fun.

148
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,345
Aw, you just wanna see
the broad, jillette.

149
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,506
What's wrong with that, Joe?

150
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,678
I don't see any
heart-stoppers here.

151
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,684
These broads still got the price
tag hanging from their nose.

152
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,039
Eddie: Nice, nice.

153
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,547
There he is. He's the dick
Dipper we're looking for.

154
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,004
Joe: Maybe she's his sister.

155
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,386
She's got "born to screw"
tattooed on her forehead.

156
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,137
Don't be bitter. Me, bitter?

157
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,513
- I know the secret to happiness.
- Oh, yeah. What's that?

158
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,092
A girl with freckles
on her tits.

159
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,521
Can I help you?

160
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,363
You got it wrong.

161
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,153
Oh, of course.

162
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:45,829
Sit down.

163
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,124
Outside.

164
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,574
We're just about to order.

165
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:52,878
Outside.

166
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,129
Nice, Eddie. Nice.

167
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,189
You got a hard on for this girl, so
you gotta go and jump on this guy.

168
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,513
You blew it

169
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,038
man comes up to you looking for a Chicago
shooter. What am I supposed to do?

170
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,804
- Swap spit with him, blow in his ear?
- Always works for me.

171
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,721
That's not what your wife says.

172
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:16,607
Huh? I'd be offended if
you didn't owe me money.

173
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:17,983
Oh, you're such a romantic.

174
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,987
Ha-ha. No, no, not me. You're
the romantic one, Eddie.

175
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,682
Hence your problem. Yeah.

176
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:36,494
No. You wired? Huh?

177
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:39,109
Ever since we walked in to the joint,
I thought we were being watched.

178
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,168
He's clean

179
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:04,109
Satisfied?

180
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,156
Okay, nothing personal. Right?

181
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,976
Just want to make sure
you're not cops.

182
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,167
Of course.

183
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,121
Get your car and follow me.

184
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,149
I have a problem in New Orleans
I'd like taken care of.

185
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,366
So why not use local?

186
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,709
The man I want you to do
business with is very connected.

187
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,458
He'd know if I used local.

188
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:06,713
So, why do you want
this guy hit?

189
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,013
Is that important?

190
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,222
Stay out of this, lady.

191
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:11,577
I don't like the way
you say lady.

192
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:12,601
What's this gonna cost?

193
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,353
A lot more than her

194
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,345
drop this guy. He's a loser.

195
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,503
You want me to go to a strange
city and make a hit?

196
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:25,145
I gotta know who the guy is.
What his habits are?

197
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:28,861
Let this broad go down on you, a
couple of times. She runs your life.

198
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,080
You came up here 'cuz you don't have
the fucking guts to hit him yourself.

199
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,445
You don't have the balls to
keep your woman in her place!

200
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,094
I think we can do business

201
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:06,694
I don't know, Eddie.
They're not buying it.

202
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,275
She's giving me attitude,
that's all.

203
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,255
This guy's dying to talk.
Think he's smart.

204
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,944
Give me one hour, will you?

205
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,288
Take her back to her hotel

206
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,976
and what am I
supposed to do with her?

207
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
What do you usually do?

208
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,788
I don't do anything.
I'm married.

209
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,328
Get the car, Joe.
Wait for me in the room.

210
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,126
Where you staying?

211
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:27,711
Ambassador east, the penthouse.

212
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,176
You and I should take a ride.

213
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,472
Fine

214
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,439
She's not what you think,
you know.

215
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,204
She's an exceptional woman.

216
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,504
Yeah, sure.

217
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,698
Eddie: So, who's this guy
you want hit?

218
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,968
The man in question
is very dangerous.

219
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,426
Enjoys violence.

220
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,290
Paul: Michel says some women find
him attractive because of that.

221
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,250
Eddie: What does she have to
do with this?

222
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,279
She belongs to him.

223
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,030
I'm lost. What does that mean?

224
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:36,033
We come from a society which is
very pleasurable to be a man.

225
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:04,666
You have somebody follow us?

226
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,690
No

227
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,106
Shit! Get out of the car.

228
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,780
Eddie: Get out of the car.

229
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,162
Move it!

230
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,123
Fddie: Get out!

231
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,875
Paul: I can't! I can't get out!

232
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,573
This isn't a job for you.

233
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,582
We can handle it

234
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,288
your friend, maybe. But not you.

235
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,550
Go home to your wife.

236
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:22,875
What makes you
think I'm married?

237
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,595
I can tell.
You don't belong here.

238
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,267
I'm waiting for Eddie.

239
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,195
Stop it!

240
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,612
I'm a police officer!
Stop the fucking car! Stop it!

241
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,307
Where you going?

242
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:17,567
It's over

243
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,648
what's over?

244
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,408
Life, my friend.

245
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,652
Hey, hey.

246
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:05,748
I'm a police officer.
All right, now. Hold it.

247
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:06,968
Come on,
get out of the elevator.

248
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:07,481
My partner's
in trouble up there.

249
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:10,151
Out of the elevator.

250
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,973
I want you to make a call, 911 and
get help over here right away!

251
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,407
Get out of the elevator.

252
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,368
Get out of the elevator.
Make the call

253
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:16,668
make the call!

254
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:24,624
Police!

255
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,390
Joe?

256
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:38,815
Joe?

257
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:42,443
Joe?

258
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:52,328
Joe.

259
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:00,625
Joe

260
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:21,024
How you doing?

261
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,895
You okay?

262
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:33,783
Eddie, what happened?

263
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,869
He was waiting for me.
I was late.

264
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,077
He always tried to
prepare me for this.

265
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,763
It's part of being
a cop's wife, right?

266
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,633
He'd want you to have that.

267
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,260
He loved you.

268
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,671
You look like stale piss.

269
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:17,805
What were you and
Collins doing with the victim?

270
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:25,388
He thought we were hit men.

271
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,397
He wanted us to
whack a guy in New Orleans.

272
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,067
Jesus Christ!

273
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:34,907
Who was this guy?

274
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:41,742
Paul deveneux. Sent a bag of ashes
to his family in New Orleans.

275
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,789
Real sweethearts

276
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,520
we figured whoever deveneux wanted
to waste, he got him first, huh?

277
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:52,717
Yeah

278
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:02,018
So, who was this?

279
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:05,176
I don't know.
I never got a name.

280
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,526
That's great, jillette.

281
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,062
What were you two doing? Driving
around in the moonlight?

282
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:19,899
You talk to the cops down there?

283
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:22,955
You tell them about Joe?

284
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,082
Yeah

285
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,579
they say that's our problem.

286
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,461
My problem.

287
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:44,800
It's different down there.
You don't know New Orleans.

288
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,514
They don't even talk like us.

289
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:50,019
I'll make myself understood.

290
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,350
Bitch

291
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:32,140
- Mr. deveneux, will see you now.
- Hey, thanks.

292
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,067
Detective jillette

293
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,690
Allan deveneux.
I'm Paul's cousin.

294
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:47,308
I talked to your
superiors in Chicago.

295
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,038
I don't know what more
I can add.

296
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,414
Bernice, Mr. jillette.

297
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:51,711
Hi

298
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,707
And Susan is Paul's wife.

299
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,734
I know this has been
a very difficult time for you,

300
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,373
but I'd like to
ask a few questions.

301
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,633
Mint julep? No, thanks.

302
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,669
What type of business was
your husband in?

303
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:05,635
Oh, agriculture, oil,
that sort of thing.

304
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,454
Was he having any financial problems?
“We never discussed them.

305
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,269
Was anything troubling him?

306
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,356
No

307
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,108
Did he have any enemies?

308
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,566
Not that I know of

309
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:18,818
I knew very little
about Paul's personal life.

310
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:22,513
You know what he was
doing in Chicago?

311
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:23,906
No

312
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:25,363
He hired me to kill somebody.

313
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,739
Susan has been under
terrible strain,

314
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:32,908
and that kind of inquiry
won't help.

315
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,922
Does Michel mean
anything to you? -No.

316
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,834
She was with him.
Tattoo on her right shoulder.

317
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,923
A tattoo? Huh?

318
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:48,432
I'm gonna miss Paul.
He was a very amusing man.

319
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:52,595
Well, I appreciate your coming down here.
I wish I could help you more.

320
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:55,731
It seems as if your people
don't know a great deal...

321
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:57,506
Apart from a young lady
with a tattoo.

322
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,111
You find that amusing?

323
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,441
No

324
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,948
I need to see the personal
papers of the deceased

325
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,781
phone bills, credit cards,
address books, everything

326
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,117
well, I don't intend to prolong
this grotesque tragedy.

327
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,701
I hope you understand that.

328
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:13,615
Oh, I understand.
Goodbye, Mr. jillette.

329
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:14,919
Good bye.

330
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,796
Now, you should understand me.

331
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:03,957
I don't play tennis,

332
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:04,920
I don't drink mint juleps, and
I don't give a shit about you

333
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,632
your family, your horny
bat shit dead cousin.

334
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,119
I'm looking for the bastard
that gutted my partner and

335
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,599
tied his intestines
around his neck.

336
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:15,010
And with or without your help,
I'm gonna get him.

337
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,983
You've just made
a very big mistake.

338
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:25,692
About you? About you? Huh?
You? No. Not about you.

339
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,126
Man: The place your
mother warned you about!

340
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:51,047
Male and female shows onstage.
Disgusting! You'll love this.

341
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:54,262
And you get in free right now.
Men and women.

342
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,722
They're all real, home grown,
no soy.

343
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,138
See the grisly acts of passion
just as they happened.

344
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,272
Learn the secrets
of the bitches daughter.

345
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,856
See the basement where Angeline
buried her lovers. It's all here.

346
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:06,507
I just came down here
for the weekend,

347
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,193
and I met this local girl.
Name's Michel.

348
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:12,735
Blond, blue eyed, about 5'6.

349
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:16,701
She's got this terrific tattoo right
behind her, her right shoulder.

350
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,912
It's a blue parrot, and I wanna
get one exactly like it.

351
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:22,892
I think she said she got it at your place.
Does that make any sense?

352
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:26,049
You don't do parrots.
You know any place that does?

353
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,084
Okay. Thanks anyway.

354
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:06,015
- Freeze, you motherfucker! Your history.
- Lieutenant hall.

355
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:07,318
We're police.

356
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,360
Shit.

357
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,178
Someone's been on my tail.
Was it you?

358
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:14,325
What'd he look like?

359
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:16,407
I didn't see him.

360
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,347
- You saw somebody you didn't see?
- You're a fucking comedian.

361
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,908
No, you're the comedian.

362
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:24,168
This is my town, jillette. You check
with me before you piss in my streets.

363
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:27,039
Make house calls
like you're somebody.

364
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,705
- Deveneux filed a complaint against you.
- Oh, bullshit.

365
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,448
He's got a witness.
Fucking bullshit!

366
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:34,042
I'm not fucking around with you, boy!
What bullshit

367
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:36,382
you cross me, and [ll
personally grease the pole

368
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,091
that slides you into
a tub of shit.

369
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,539
Somebody guts my partner, and you're
thinking nasty things about me.

370
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:44,749
That really,
fucking breaks me up.

371
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:46,889
I'm sorry about your partner.

372
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:48,294
But I want you
out of here on the

373
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:49,318
first plane in the A.M..

374
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:52,488
Get him out of here.

375
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:09,165
Algiers? Where's that?

376
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,224
You're on a plane tomorrow
morning, jillette.

377
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,586
That's tomorrow

378
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:17,920
across the bridge.

379
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:23,930
Look, you go asking questions
in Algiers...

380
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,349
They'll cut your tongue out
and throw it in the river.

381
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:29,567
Thanks.

382
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:30,734
Not really.

383
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,194
Anybody speak english here?

384
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:01,886
I'm looking for Cara Jones.

385
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,901
Yeah, yeah.

386
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:05,535
Cara Jones.

387
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,412
A black girl.

388
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,190
Where is she?

389
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:45,904
Where is who?

390
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,204
Michel

391
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,321
I don't know no Michel

392
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:08,392
I don't know anything.

393
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:12,646
What? Day or night?

394
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:14,096
Is it day or night?

395
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,060
Night.

396
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:19,101
You see, you do know something.
Don't ever lie to me again.

397
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:35,079
You a tough guy?

398
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:38,547
Tough enough.

399
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:24,632
Hi

400
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,378
Michel here tonight?

401
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:29,681
Who wants to know?

402
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:30,808
A friend.

403
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:32,059
I doubt it

404
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,742
You remember me?

405
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,203
I just read you your rights.

406
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:28,589
You're under arrest, lady.
This is what's gonna happen.

407
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:33,218
You and I are
gonna walk out of this joint.

408
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,300
You're gonna keep
your fat mouth shut.

409
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,600
You got it. Huh?

410
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:38,759
Come on.

411
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,481
Jillette

412
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,313
what? Eddie jillette

413
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:49,523
Eddie jillette. Say it.

414
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,312
Fddie jillette

415
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:54,449
if anything else comes out of
your mouth, you're history.

416
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,200
You shoot, they'll kill you.

417
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:57,827
Think I give a shit about dying?

418
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:17,843
Eddie: Go! Move!

419
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:21,388
Fddie: Run!

420
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,648
Oh, no, tough guy! Don't even think
about it! Move over there! Move! Move!

421
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,694
Eddie: Come on! Move it!

422
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,490
Stop the car!

423
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:39,547
Stop the goddamn car! Get out! Get
out of the car! Get out of the car!

424
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,700
Move it! Get in!

425
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:50,796
Shit!

426
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:56,427
Get your head down.
Keep it down!

427
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:06,346
Ow!

428
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:07,849
No! I'll tell you when to die.

429
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,647
Yeah. Got a light?

430
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,398
Went in right here.

431
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:52,934
Yeah, right.

432
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:26,717
He's gone, man. He's gone.

433
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:31,191
No!

434
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:37,649
Michel, where are you?

435
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:40,110
Not a word,
or you go under. Nothing.

436
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,531
I osado: Call to me.

437
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:47,207
Try him.

438
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:52,998
He thinks you're his prisoner.

439
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:04,808
Jillette!

440
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:07,850
Fddie jillette

441
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:11,853
sure, I know your name.

442
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:18,152
I'll make you a deal.

443
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,105
Fddie jillette

444
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:24,533
let Michel go.

445
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,863
You don't want her. You want me.

446
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:33,037
Come out.

447
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,206
Face me.

448
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,209
Just two of us.

449
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:41,671
You kill me

450
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:43,972
you go home...

451
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:46,677
Safe

452
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:48,136
I guarantee.

453
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:51,936
But

454
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,511
if you make me come after you...

455
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:58,146
You die, for sure...

456
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,570
I tke an animal

457
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:03,151
like your friend.

458
00:45:06,162 --> 00:45:09,905
I cut him open... Eddie jillette

459
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:11,958
like a pig.

460
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,420
I osado!

461
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,549
I osado!

462
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:08,008
Kick. You wanna live,
start kicking.

463
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:50,307
Michel

464
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:53,216
Michel

465
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:03,608
Cara: I swear,
I didn't say nothing.

466
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:05,019
I osado: You talked to him.

467
00:47:06,115 --> 00:47:07,195
No

468
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:08,856
Yes, my friend.

469
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:06,247
Sorry to end your
beauty sleep, lady.

470
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,793
You know where we are?

471
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:12,712
How far did we drift?

472
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:14,095
How should I know?

473
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:08,855
Eddie: Jesus Christ!

474
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:18,539
I can't stand these anymore.
Help me get them off.

475
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:23,161
You're tough.
Why don't you gnaw it off?

476
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:25,167
Give me the key.

477
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:27,169
I can't go anywhere.
Give me the key.

478
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:29,421
I wish I could.
I lost it in the river.

479
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:32,800
I've got to get them off.

480
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:35,260
They won't get off.

481
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:37,367
I have to get them off.
I can't stand it anymore!

482
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,660
- You're just gonna hurt yourself.
- I can't. You gotta them off!

483
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:41,244
I've gotta get away from youl!
I can't stand it anymore. - Hey!

484
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:48,019
Hold it hold it! Hold it!

485
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:51,277
You're gonna hurt yourself!
Now shut up! -Aaah!

486
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:54,905
You're such a fucking...
Damn boat!

487
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:03,076
Stupid idiot.

488
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:04,785
You shut the fuck up!

489
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:09,249
Well, you lead the way, okay?

490
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:11,334
You lead the way
and then after you die...

491
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:14,876
- I have a dead man hanging on my arm!
- I ook! Listen to me.

492
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:17,921
When I die, it's gonna be on
Chicago concrete. You got it?

493
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:20,343
Now, fucking move! Walk!

494
00:50:20,643 --> 00:50:21,643
Let go.

495
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:29,102
Stop! You're hurting me.

496
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:31,437
I wanna know what happened.

497
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:34,399
I wanna know why you and your
boyfriend set up deveneux.

498
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:37,064
I wanna know what you get
for killing a man.

499
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:40,735
Most of all, I wanna know how
you killed my fucking partner!

500
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,413
He runs Algiers.

501
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,119
Runs Algiers?
What the hell is that?

502
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,250
I belong to him.

503
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:51,253
No shit what does that mean?

504
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:53,289
What do you think me?

505
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:56,512
I think it means losado got himself a
two-bit hooker. That's what I think.

506
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,888
I was 13, my mama took me
to losado.

507
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:03,544
He gave her a house
and some money.

508
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:05,691
And I was his. You got that?
I was given to him.

509
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:09,463
Every hooker's got
a hard-luck story.

510
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:14,102
That's a real prizewinner,
that one.

511
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:17,067
If you don't believe me,
you don't matter!

512
00:51:17,366 --> 00:51:21,325
Wrong. I matter a whole lot,
lady.

513
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,282
You're going to jail, and your
boyfriend's gonna stop breathing.

514
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:42,698
Eddie: Hello?

515
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:48,831
Hey?

516
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,462
Hey, hey. Hey! Hey!

517
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:03,719
What are you doing?
Can't you read?

518
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,585
Nothing. Not a crumb.

519
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:47,181
Come on.

520
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:54,102
Michel: Great!

521
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:59,103
What is it?

522
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:01,189
You never had crawfish before?

523
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:03,479
Sure, my mom used to put them
in my lunch.

524
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:43,613
No

525
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,404
Oh, not like that.

526
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:51,611
I ike that

527
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:54,656
see, you take them,
and you break the head off.

528
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:57,704
And suck the juice out of it.

529
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:07,345
Good?

530
00:55:07,596 --> 00:55:08,756
Yeah, it's good.

531
00:55:38,794 --> 00:55:40,534
Do you have a wife?

532
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:42,544
Yeah, ex.

533
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,173
Ran off with some guy.

534
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:50,381
What'd you do?

535
00:55:51,974 --> 00:55:53,464
What do you mean?

536
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:54,847
Well, did you go after him?

537
00:55:57,688 --> 00:56:00,395
Just left me, that's it.
That's all there was

538
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,810
what's so funny?

539
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:08,900
You're a tough guy, a cop.

540
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:12,323
And you didn't do anything?

541
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,360
All right, what happened?

542
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:19,581
She calls me up
and says, "Eddie...

543
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:23,202
"I think

544
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:28,124
"if you and David sat down and had
a beer you'd have like each other"

545
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:31,760
- so you took him out for a beer?
- Yeah, I really nailed him.

546
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:33,261
Stuck him with the tab.

547
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:42,763
You're not from there.
You wouldn't understand.

548
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:53,948
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.
Don't get excited now.

549
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:30,860
It's like rain somewhere.

550
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:36,491
Somewhere pretty.

551
00:57:57,975 --> 00:57:59,455
God, I wish I was far away.

552
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:04,605
Forget.

553
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:07,852
Just forget.

554
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:17,695
Yeah, let's forget.

555
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:24,994
You're good, lady.
You are... really, really good.

556
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:31,372
This how you played it with that dumb,
dead jerk in Chicago? Deveneux?

557
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:33,957
Give some guy a hard-on.

558
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:36,377
Next thing he knows,
he's getting killed for you.

559
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:37,949
What the hell, huh?
What the hell!

560
00:58:37,973 --> 00:58:40,885
A whore's a whore. Goes with the territory.
You don't know me.

561
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:43,550
You don't know anything
about my life.

562
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:45,581
You think you know everything
but you don't know anything

563
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:47,291
I know one thing. I do know one thing!
About my life.

564
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:50,557
Joey Collins is dead
because of you.

565
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:53,819
And you stood there, and you just
fucking watched, didn't you?

566
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:56,321
Didn't you? Didn't you?

567
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:58,902
You don't know what
I've seen in my life.

568
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:01,818
Do you think that was the worst?

569
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:04,613
You think that was the worst?

570
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:07,703
You wanna hear something
about it? Do you?

571
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:17,000
Losado will kill you.

572
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:21,922
That's what I'm gonna watch.

573
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,796
I'm not a whore

574
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:02,640
what?

575
01:00:04,893 --> 01:00:06,383
I'm not a whore

576
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:11,013
never been with anyone
except losado.

577
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:15,941
Yeah, so?

578
01:00:18,824 --> 01:00:20,405
I'm not a whore

579
01:00:39,678 --> 01:00:42,010
Okay. I'm a police officer.

580
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:47,011
You understand me?
Police officer? A cop?

581
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:50,729
This 1s my prisoner.

582
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:53,563
Yeah. Cop.

583
01:00:57,988 --> 01:00:59,788
What are you saying to them?

584
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:01,143
Keep your mouth shut.

585
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:08,654
Do you speak any english at all?

586
01:01:08,957 --> 01:01:11,317
You understand this woman's under arrest.
She's my prisoner.

587
01:01:19,885 --> 01:01:20,885
Don't touch her.

588
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:26,691
Take your fucking hands off!
Don't touch her!

589
01:01:26,725 --> 01:01:28,244
Keep your fucking hands off her!

590
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:30,686
I osado! I osado!

591
01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:34,354
That's right!
This is losado's woman!

592
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:38,441
I osado?

593
01:01:38,737 --> 01:01:40,477
Eddie: Yeah, losado.
You understand that?

594
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:42,091
He'll come here, cut your fucking
hand off and scratch your ass with it

595
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:43,651
if you touch her.

596
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:45,743
I osado?

597
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:46,911
Yeah, losado! Back off!

598
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:01,623
(Speaking in French

599
01:02:01,927 --> 01:02:03,133
they called losado.

600
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:05,710
This his operation?

601
01:02:06,014 --> 01:02:07,014
Yeas

602
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:09,802
he works for him?

603
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:22,602
Deveneux?

604
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:27,782
He smuggles them in and sells
them to deveneux. Is that it?

605
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:32,807
What happened? Deveneux got greedy?
Is that why they whacked him?

606
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:37,833
Why did you help me?
Why did you say losado's name?

607
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:42,829
Tub of shit.

608
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:50,179
Okay.

609
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:52,594
Turn your head.

610
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,310
Come on.

611
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:04,488
Get in!

612
01:03:08,076 --> 01:03:09,076
Eddie: No, you don't!

613
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:44,017
I don't get it.

614
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:50,232
Losado's in business with deveneux.
Smuggles in cheap labor.

615
01:03:53,538 --> 01:03:56,200
So, what were you doing
with deveneux in Chicago?

616
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:58,364
And why did he want
to kill losado?

617
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:03,328
He said it was the only way.

618
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:07,624
Deveneux promised to help me.

619
01:04:10,305 --> 01:04:11,715
Help you do what?

620
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:14,719
Get free from losado.

621
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:19,719
What did you promise him?

622
01:04:21,483 --> 01:04:24,225
I didn't promise him anything.
He was a gentleman.

623
01:04:33,328 --> 01:04:36,320
Jesus Christ, this whole
thing's about you, isn't it?

624
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:50,427
Get out.

625
01:05:24,212 --> 01:05:26,373
Don't move.
Don't even think about it.

626
01:05:34,556 --> 01:05:36,171
Okay, okay, okay... give it up.

627
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:37,576
Yeah... wait! Police officer.

628
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,720
And I'm tinkerbell, asshole.

629
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:39,935
Police officer!

630
01:05:39,978 --> 01:05:41,263
Handcuffs. Keep still.

631
01:05:41,563 --> 01:05:43,053
Jesus Christ!

632
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:49,230
The next time you send one
of your people down here...

633
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:51,090
They'd better be advised
to exhibit a better sense

634
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:53,696
of professionalism and respect.

635
01:05:53,992 --> 01:05:56,387
I don't know how you do things in
Chicago, and I don't intend to find out.

636
01:05:56,411 --> 01:05:58,322
But it doesn't work down here.

637
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:01,863
Cop to cop.

638
01:06:02,167 --> 01:06:05,284
Your boy has drowned in his own
puddle of mud if you get my meaning.

639
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:10,751
I wanna know why he's in
this piss-stained rat cage.

640
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:12,586
They're still
pissed about the war.

641
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:13,886
Listen here, boy!

642
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:15,422
Cop to cop...

643
01:06:15,722 --> 01:06:18,304
I want this man out of here.

644
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:21,808
I want him showered and shaved and
polished up like it's payday...

645
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:24,707
And south street is filled with
ladies that don't know the word "no"

646
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:26,141
you get my meaning?

647
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:32,946
Do it

648
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:55,755
Thanks.

649
01:06:56,054 --> 01:06:57,740
You come down here, you lose your
gun, your star and your pants.

650
01:06:57,764 --> 01:06:59,880
Got the girl.

651
01:07:00,183 --> 01:07:01,903
With you, there's always a girl.

652
01:07:05,063 --> 01:07:06,769
You better get it together,
jillette

653
01:07:07,065 --> 01:07:08,667
because if they have
their way, you're gonna be

654
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:11,478
just another piece of maggot shit,
turning big rocks into little ones.

655
01:07:19,536 --> 01:07:21,242
They got the decks
marked and wired.

656
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:23,494
Life cheats, jillette.

657
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:25,746
Oh, you're a treasure,
stemkowski.

658
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:28,078
That's what your
ex-wife says. -My ex?

659
01:07:34,092 --> 01:07:37,380
If you want out of here, you keep
your mouth shut. -

660
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:45,141
I have Ms. duval's
sworn affidavit

661
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:48,269
that she did in fact meet
Mr. jillette in Chicago.

662
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:51,807
That he presented himself
as an assassin for hire.

663
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:55,443
That he went off
with my cousin Paul.

664
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:59,902
And that detective Collins went
out of the hotel by himself.

665
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:03,443
Since you have no evidence
placing miss duval at the hotel

666
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:06,453
I suggest you drop criminal
proceedings against her.

667
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:09,991
What I understand she's a
witness against a Mr. I osado.

668
01:08:10,295 --> 01:08:12,581
She maintains she
didn't see anything.

669
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:14,996
Ask her

670
01:08:19,304 --> 01:08:20,885
thank you for your summary.

671
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:23,576
The Chicago police department
apologizes for any inconvenience

672
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,306
that we may have caused
this woman.

673
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:28,093
I'm sure you understand that
in murder of a fellow officer

674
01:08:28,396 --> 01:08:32,139
we're willing to go to extraordinary
lengths to pursue the slightest lead.

675
01:08:32,442 --> 01:08:33,711
I just received word
from Chicago

676
01:08:33,735 --> 01:08:36,226
that we apprehended
a prime suspect in this case.

677
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:39,521
And that we need detective jillette
back as soon as possible to identify.

678
01:08:39,824 --> 01:08:43,658
This man came into my home.
He threatened me.

679
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:46,990
He frightened my family.

680
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:48,826
He destroyed my car.

681
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,269
We've already paid for the car.

682
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:54,127
You're missing my point. The
man is dangerously unstable!

683
01:08:54,422 --> 01:08:56,834
He has no business
being a police officer.

684
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:59,875
And I'm gonna see he's put away.

685
01:09:00,178 --> 01:09:03,090
He abducted this woman. He
threatened to kill her. Ask her.

686
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:14,563
What happened between this man and
me doesn't concern you or the law.

687
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:29,328
You sign this please, so I
can get rid of these guys.

688
01:09:29,624 --> 01:09:31,285
My client can't read.

689
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:49,405
Thank you. You're free to go.

690
01:09:50,144 --> 01:09:52,055
Thank you. You're free to go.

691
01:12:18,626 --> 01:12:20,207
Losado: Don't let her out
of your sight.

692
01:13:08,426 --> 01:13:10,667
I don't wanna see
either of you guys.

693
01:14:03,564 --> 01:14:05,646
The plane leaves
in five minutes.

694
01:14:08,527 --> 01:14:11,394
I don't particularly like you,
jillette

695
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:13,759
I don't wanna hold hands, I don't wanna
take long walks in the moonlight...

696
01:14:13,783 --> 01:14:15,364
And I don't wanna swap spit.

697
01:14:21,582 --> 01:14:24,039
I want
that son-of-a-bitch losado.

698
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:43,555
What the hell? Lawrence!

699
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:57,740
Don't forget. I'm very unstable.

700
01:14:59,704 --> 01:15:01,490
I'm a lawyer. I had to say that.

701
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:03,871
Guys like you...

702
01:15:05,918 --> 01:15:09,536
Always think you can walk away
from things like this, don't you?

703
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:12,706
Look, can we talk about this?

704
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:14,945
I don't give a damn about you.
It's losado I want.

705
01:15:14,969 --> 01:15:16,459
I understand that

706
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:17,842
do you fucking understand?

707
01:15:18,139 --> 01:15:21,256
You're right.
I don't understand that.

708
01:15:21,559 --> 01:15:22,139
Get down!

709
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:23,435
Aaargh!

710
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:25,854
Kiss it goodbye.

711
01:15:26,105 --> 01:15:27,185
No!

712
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:28,481
Please, no!

713
01:15:37,074 --> 01:15:39,690
I'll be in Algiers.
You tell losado.

714
01:16:15,613 --> 01:16:18,605
Second floor. If you wanna guest
towels, it's an extra $10.

715
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:20,606
If anybody ask for me...

716
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:21,910
Yeah, I never seen you.

717
01:16:21,952 --> 01:16:23,442
Wrong.

718
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:26,283
If anybody asks for Eddie
jillette, tell them I'm upstairs.

719
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:27,867
Who else is staying here?

720
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:29,657
Well, at the moment, uh...

721
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,996
I'm taking all the rooms.

722
01:16:32,296 --> 01:16:34,787
There's no future in the job.
Go home.

723
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:41,627
It's still $10
for the extra towel. -

724
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:34,641
He's not out there

725
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:37,686
he won't come for you.

726
01:19:37,982 --> 01:19:39,688
He's in the bayou tonight.

727
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:44,901
He'll come for me.

728
01:19:48,075 --> 01:19:50,191
And that's what you want,
isn't it?

729
01:19:53,038 --> 01:19:54,038
Yeas

730
01:19:55,374 --> 01:19:57,581
if you wanna die so bad...

731
01:19:57,876 --> 01:19:59,980
Why don't you put that gun to
your head and pull the trigger?

732
01:20:00,004 --> 01:20:01,039
Go on.

733
01:20:02,298 --> 01:20:03,663
I didn't come here to die

734
01:20:06,135 --> 01:20:07,671
Eddie, go.

735
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:11,931
Go.

736
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:15,841
You can still get out of here.

737
01:20:16,145 --> 01:20:17,851
You can get out right now.

738
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:31,065
I can't leave.

739
01:20:32,244 --> 01:20:33,654
Please, Eddie.

740
01:20:39,418 --> 01:20:41,204
It's all right.

741
01:22:48,088 --> 01:22:50,170
Say it. Say it.

742
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:54,166
Say my name.

743
01:22:57,222 --> 01:22:58,302
Say "Michel".

744
01:23:00,434 --> 01:23:02,174
Michel.

745
01:23:02,478 --> 01:23:03,478
Say it.

746
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:04,562
Michel.

747
01:23:04,605 --> 01:23:05,605
Say it.

748
01:23:05,898 --> 01:23:06,898
Michel,

749
01:23:08,525 --> 01:23:11,483
Michel, Michel, Michel.

750
01:23:50,484 --> 01:23:51,815
Did you love her?

751
01:23:54,488 --> 01:23:55,488
Who?

752
01:23:57,115 --> 01:23:58,150
Your wife?

753
01:24:03,997 --> 01:24:06,864
You ask an awful
lot of questions. -

754
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:07,781
too many?

755
01:24:08,085 --> 01:24:09,085
Maybe.

756
01:24:12,381 --> 01:24:13,541
Did you?

757
01:24:15,717 --> 01:24:17,173
Yes.

758
01:24:20,514 --> 01:24:21,924
Do you still?

759
01:24:24,518 --> 01:24:25,928
Are you a cop?

760
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:29,313
I'm sorry.

761
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:31,930
It's okay.

762
01:24:42,786 --> 01:24:44,617
What are you thinking?

763
01:24:50,627 --> 01:24:53,243
How things fade... finally.

764
01:24:59,303 --> 01:25:00,463
Do they?

765
01:25:02,472 --> 01:25:04,588
Or do you just learn to live
with them?

766
01:26:26,515 --> 01:26:29,097
You know, my mama's house
was old and noisy like this.

767
01:26:31,269 --> 01:26:33,206
I used to think it sounded like voices.

768
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:34,345
Stop.

769
01:26:36,483 --> 01:26:37,723
Right there. Shift your weight.

770
01:26:40,404 --> 01:26:41,684
Okay, take a step to your right.

771
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:45,105
Okay, good. Right there.

772
01:26:48,286 --> 01:26:50,447
What kind of house
did you live in Eddie?

773
01:26:50,747 --> 01:26:52,408
Like, when you were little.

774
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:55,370
No houses. Apartments.
All of them dumps.

775
01:26:55,669 --> 01:26:57,000
Take another step.

776
01:26:58,714 --> 01:27:00,034
When I was little

777
01:27:00,257 --> 01:27:02,748
okay, good.

778
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:07,090
My mama used to put a drop of
perfume in a glass of water.

779
01:27:07,389 --> 01:27:10,347
Then she said, "Michel,
now, drink this right up...

780
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:12,553
It'll make you
feel pretty inside."

781
01:27:12,853 --> 01:27:14,718
That's it, right there. Good.

782
01:28:28,428 --> 01:28:30,168
Don't.

783
01:28:30,472 --> 01:28:31,472
It's him

784
01:28:40,941 --> 01:28:42,647
Michel, listen to me.

785
01:28:44,945 --> 01:28:47,311
I want you to go.

786
01:28:50,784 --> 01:28:52,320
He'll be here soon.

787
01:28:52,619 --> 01:28:55,326
I want you out of here
by the time he comes. -

788
01:28:55,622 --> 01:28:56,622
no, I'm staying with you.

789
01:28:56,873 --> 01:28:58,864
No, you're not. You're leaving.

790
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:04,828
I want you to get as far away from
this stinking shithole as you can.

791
01:29:08,593 --> 01:29:11,614
Whatever went down in Chicago's got nothing
to do with you anymore. It's over.

792
01:29:11,638 --> 01:29:14,505
You're free.

793
01:29:14,808 --> 01:29:18,801
Michel, go on. This is your chance.
Get out of here.

794
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:22,141
Eddie, you have to talk to me. You
have to talk to me right now.

795
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:25,022
Come on, we've got time.
You have to talk to me.

796
01:29:25,318 --> 01:29:27,525
Just talk to me.
Just for a while talk to me.

797
01:29:27,821 --> 01:29:30,528
You want to help me?
Please get out of here. -Hmm.

798
01:29:30,824 --> 01:29:32,689
I won't let him kill you.
Please.

799
01:29:32,993 --> 01:29:35,638
Together, we have a chance. I want a
chance, Eddie. That's all I want.

800
01:29:35,662 --> 01:29:36,702
I love you. I want time...

801
01:29:36,872 --> 01:29:38,112
I don't care about you!

802
01:29:38,415 --> 01:29:39,415
I want you.

803
01:29:43,044 --> 01:29:44,784
Get the fuck out of here!

804
01:32:08,982 --> 01:32:11,314
You couldn't stop this,
could you?

805
01:32:21,953 --> 01:32:23,693
Then what good are you...

806
01:32:24,873 --> 01:32:25,908
My friend?

807
01:36:40,461 --> 01:36:42,122
Losado: He's a dead man, Michel.

808
01:36:46,217 --> 01:36:47,297
For you.

809
01:36:48,219 --> 01:36:49,925
Losado: All for you.

810
01:37:00,398 --> 01:37:03,185
Don't come any closer unless
you're willing to die with him.

811
01:37:14,912 --> 01:37:16,152
I et him live

812
01:37:17,915 --> 01:37:19,315
and I'll come with you,
like before.

813
01:37:20,877 --> 01:37:21,877
For good.

814
01:37:33,181 --> 01:37:35,843
I always give you
what you want, no?

815
01:37:39,812 --> 01:37:40,812
Come.

816
01:37:42,065 --> 01:37:44,351
Show him that you belong to me.

817
01:38:00,917 --> 01:38:01,917
Come.

818
01:38:25,525 --> 01:38:26,525
I osado! I osado!

819
01:38:35,618 --> 01:38:37,859
You'll die, my friend!

820
01:38:39,455 --> 01:38:40,455
You'll die!

821
01:38:42,583 --> 01:38:44,414
Oh, yes. You'll burn, my friend.

822
01:42:12,209 --> 01:42:13,209
You see that, shithead?

823
01:43:38,421 --> 01:43:40,207
I got a one-bedroom apartment.

824
01:43:40,506 --> 01:43:44,090
I don't cook.
I've got a color TV.

825
01:43:44,385 --> 01:43:48,298
I forget to do things. Anniversaries,
birthdays... -

826
01:43:48,597 --> 01:43:50,963
Christmas.

827
01:43:51,267 --> 01:43:52,828
When I'm on a job,
I'm gone for days sometimes.

828
01:43:52,852 --> 01:43:54,934
You understand what I'm saying?

829
01:43:55,229 --> 01:43:57,641
I get drunk.
I yell at the people I love.

830
01:44:03,195 --> 01:44:05,527
So what do you say? Huh?

831
01:44:05,823 --> 01:44:08,815
