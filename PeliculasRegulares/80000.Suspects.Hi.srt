Mainly because your wife asked us not to.

- Mmm... I should have told him...

2276
01:36:29,001 --> 01:36:30,209
...before - as soon as I knew.

2277
01:36:30,334 --> 01:36:33,292
As a friend, it was generous of
you to try and shield him.

2278
01:36:33,417 --> 01:36:34,209
Generous?

2279
01:36:35,292 --> 01:36:37,417
Yes, I'm always generous to my friends.

- Here.

2281
01:36:40,667 --> 01:36:42,501
Officially, it's my job to tell him...

2282
01:36:42,667 --> 01:36:43,917

What's the difference?

2285
01:36:45,876 --> 01:36:48,084
Well, perhaps Father Maguire could do it.

2286
01:36:48,209 --> 01:36:49,501
I'm not trying to get out of it...

2287

- ...give him strength---
- I'll tell him myself.

Well, I expect you'll be going home shortly, Mrs Monks?

2294
01:37:06,459 --> 01:37:07,334
Tonight.

2295
01:37:07,751 --> 01:37:08,792
Oh, as soon as that?

- Not yet.

2299
01:37:16,709 --> 01:37:18,042
He said so.

01:37:19,376 --> 01:37:21,292
- Aren't you sure?
- Yes.

2301
01:37:21,459 --> 01:37:23,167
Just saying it aloud, I suppose.

Well, you deserve your happiness, I must say.

01:37:30,584 --> 01:37:31,459
I don't think so.

Oh, I ran things competently, if
that's what you mean.

2312
01:37:39,459 --> 01:37:41,626
I didn't wink at the man next door.

It's not important, really.

Well, some people think it is.

You mean people like Clifford?

2316
01:37:47,334 --> 01:37:49,251
They didn't have a chance, those two.

01:37:49,709 --> 01:37:52,417
Why is he so surprised that Ruth
does those things?

2318
01:37:52,876 --> 01:37:55,542
Poor Clifford. He's so good, yet so naive.

2319
01:37:56,501 --> 01:37:59,126
His very perfection alone must have driven her away.

2320
01:37:59,209 --> 01:38:00,834
Well, it could have inspired her instead, couldn't it?

She wanted to be treated as a human...

...he tried to make a saint out of her.

2323

And do you think he should justify...

...her infidelity, by calling it "human"?

2325
01:38:09,459 --> 01:38:12,292
Not "justify". Try to understand, and then help.

It stuck out like a sore thumb.

Ruth told me about it one night.

2338
01:38:38,209 --> 01:38:39,501
She was rather tight.

2339

She didn't actually say it happened...

2340
01:38:42,251 --> 01:38:43,084
...but I knew.

2341
01:38:44,626 --> 01:38:45,917
The whole thing meant nothing to her...

2342

...it was just an incident.

Yes, but it was more than an incident
to you, wasn't it?

Oh, at the time, yes. It was a shock to my...

2345

...ego, and an affront to my dignity.

2346
01:38:54,417 --> 01:38:55,584

And then suddenly, everything came into focus.

01:39:03,751 --> 01:39:05,959
That if he'd really wanted Ruth instead of me...

2379
01:40:28,876 --> 01:40:29,709
I should have.

01:40:30,626 --> 01:40:31,334
Why didn't you?

2381
01:40:31,417 --> 01:40:32,084
Why?

2382
01:40:32,292 --> 01:40:34,084
You couldn't have done anything, Clifford.

2383
01:40:34,334 --> 01:40:35,626
Except go and look for her.

2384
01:40:36,126 --> 01:40:37,709

"To tap my virtues."

2399
01:41:09,167 --> 01:41:10,209

Not pity them?

How can you not pity them?

2416
01:41:43,667 --> 01:41:45,376
Do these things make them happy?

No.

I'm afraid the police will want to
publish a photograph of her.

And you might let them have something of hers
for the dogs to get a scent from.
