because boy, he was really
making himself at home.

352
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:28,245
  Can I have my key now?

353
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,780
Well, I guess he wouldn't
be your cousin

354
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,949
because the features
are different.

355
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,651
I'm meeting
with Lepridon today.

356
00:27:33,686 --> 00:27:36,220
I think I'm going
to get the account.

357
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:38,455
  I really don't care.

358
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:42,693
  What do you mean?

359
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:45,596
What's that supposed to mean?
  You don't care?

360
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:47,598
It said it all.

361
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:49,700
  Well, what do you
  want me to do?

362
00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:52,002
You mean you
really don't know?

363
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:57,741
  I'll tell her.

364
00:27:57,777 --> 00:28:01,211
I just don't
believe you anymore.

365
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:06,316
  I'll tell her.

366
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:08,185
  You mean you'll
  tell her

367
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,355
  if you get the
  Lepridon account?

368
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,457
I'll tell her tonight.

369
00:28:26,472 --> 00:28:29,239
  So I said, "Not only
  can I do silkscreens,

370
00:28:29,275 --> 00:28:32,710
but I use my wife's stockings."

371
00:28:36,816 --> 00:28:39,783
  Hi. How are you?
  How you doing?

372
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:50,527
    Bo?

373
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:52,563
On Mr. Wolfman's tab again?

374
00:28:52,598 --> 00:28:53,831
  No, no,
  I'll pay for it.

375
00:28:53,866 --> 00:28:56,600
  I'm sorry, sir.
Only members can buy drinks.

376
00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:59,369
  Bo, put it on my tab,
  will you?

377
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,739
  Excuse me.

378
00:29:01,774 --> 00:29:03,640
  - Hi.
  - Hi, and thank you.

379
00:29:03,676 --> 00:29:05,743
  It's all right.
  I'm Tom Plommer.

380
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:08,278
  - First time at the club?
  - Uh, no.

381
00:29:08,314 --> 00:29:10,848
  Oh, well, that's funny.
  I hardly ever forget a face.

382
00:29:10,883 --> 00:29:12,549
  We haven't met, have we?

383
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:13,617
Yeah.

384
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:15,419
  Oh, boy. I really am
  getting old.

385
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:17,254
  I know you're a friend
  of Willy Wulfman.

386
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:18,722
  I saw you come in together.

387
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:20,691
  Well, don't tell me
  I'm wrong about that too.

388
00:29:20,726 --> 00:29:22,159
No, no, we
came in together.

389
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:23,594
  How are you?
    Hey, Willy.

390
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:24,762
  Just talking about you.

391
00:29:24,797 --> 00:29:27,598
Oh, nothing good, I hope.

392
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:29,600
 You know Brooks Williams,
   obviously.

393
00:29:29,635 --> 00:29:31,268
  Of course I do.

394
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:32,836
  - Wilson. Brooks Wilson.
  - Oh!

395
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:36,874
  I really must be drunk.
How do you like that? Williams?

396
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:38,675
  What do you do,
  Williams? Wilson?

397
00:29:38,711 --> 00:29:41,245
I'm an illustrator.
  He's an illustrator.

398
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,746
  And a damn good talent,
  too.

399
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:44,548
  Been in our
  business long?

400
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:46,483
Oh, long. As long as I have,
  right, Brooks?

401
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:47,684
Sure.
  Sure.

402
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,553
  We graduated Pratt together.

403
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:51,188
  - Oh.
  - Brooks here went free.

404
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:52,890
  He had a free ride
  on the G.I. bill.

405
00:29:52,925 --> 00:29:54,758
I had to work my way through,
  huh?

406
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:56,627
  Oh, yeah.
  The old army days.

407
00:29:56,662 --> 00:29:58,962
  You know, I did a lot
  of illustrations
  in those days.

408
00:29:58,998 --> 00:30:00,531
  Inspirational stuff.

409
00:30:00,566 --> 00:30:02,399
  Boy, that really
  goes back.

410
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:04,234
  A lot of water
  under the bridge.

411
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,736
  - Well, listen--
  - You know, I--

412
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:08,205
It was nice talking to you.
I really got to be pushing on.

413
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,573
  I thought you wanted
  to meet Benny?

414
00:30:09,608 --> 00:30:10,808
  - Right.
  - I'll call you, Brooks.

415
00:30:10,843 --> 00:30:13,510
  - We should get together.
  - So long.

416
00:30:13,546 --> 00:30:15,712
WILLY:
He's a good man
with an airbrush.

417
00:30:15,748 --> 00:30:18,649
Brooks, sorry we're late.
I hope you haven't eaten yet.

418
00:30:18,684 --> 00:30:20,350
  No, no, I haven't.

419
00:30:20,386 --> 00:30:23,821
Brooks, I guess you know Al.
Al is president of the club.

420
00:30:23,856 --> 00:30:25,722
  And this is--
  - Susan.

421
00:30:25,758 --> 00:30:28,458
  Right. Come on in.
  I'm starving. Let's eat.

422
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:32,029
  Boy, was that traffic
  terrible today.

423
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:36,800
  We all missed you.
  Frank came up to fill in,

424
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:38,735
  and we finished the layout
  in about three hours.

425
00:30:38,771 --> 00:30:41,872
I'm sorry I missed that. Bebe
had one of her 24-hour things.

426
00:30:41,907 --> 00:30:43,874
I asked Lester
to call you. Did he?

427
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:45,542
  Yeah, he did.

428
00:30:45,578 --> 00:30:47,711
So the couple comes back
from the little girl's funeral,

429
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:49,947
  and they're standing,
  grief-stricken,

430
00:30:49,982 --> 00:30:52,649
  in the playroom,
  and then the husband

431
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:55,018
  accidentally bumps
  into one of the kid's toys,

432
00:30:55,054 --> 00:30:56,587
  and the damn thing

433
00:30:56,622 --> 00:30:59,022
  starts playing
  the music box theme.

434
00:30:59,058 --> 00:31:01,358
  Naturally, both break up,

435
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:03,727
  but we show it
  before they break up.

436
00:31:03,762 --> 00:31:05,329
  A crying woman
  looks like nothing.

437
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,231
  She's negative,
  you know what I mean?

438
00:31:07,266 --> 00:31:09,566
Yeah, I do.
You got the galleys, Benny?

439
00:31:11,804 --> 00:31:14,271
  Brooks, it's your baby.

440
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:17,341
  Do it your own way,
  your own style,

441
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,276
  have fun with it,

442
00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:22,379
  only don't screw up
  the broad's face.

443
00:31:23,949 --> 00:31:26,316
  I left the galleys
  in the office.

444
00:31:26,352 --> 00:31:27,985
  Well, I'll send them
  over to Edwards.

445
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,453
All right.

446
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:33,290
  Listen, everybody,
  I'm late. I gotta run.

447
00:31:33,325 --> 00:31:35,559
  Al, I'll call you.

448
00:31:35,594 --> 00:31:37,394
    AL: Right.

449
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:39,363
Nice meeting you,
Susan.

450
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,231
  Should I call
  you, Benny?

451
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:43,934
Yeah, give me a call,
Willy.

452
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,338
What month were you born?

453
00:31:48,374 --> 00:31:50,307

  Pisces. I thought so.

455
00:31:52,011 --> 00:31:53,810
What's that supposed to mean?

456
00:31:53,846 --> 00:31:54,978
  Nothing.

457
00:31:55,014 --> 00:31:58,482
Well, it must
mean something.

458
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:00,517
  What did you think
of the new exhibit, Wilson?

459
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:02,786
  Fairly nice stuff,
  huh?

460
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:04,221
Oh, Brooks loved it.

461
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,455
I was just telling
them downstairs,

462
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:07,224
  it's a good thing
all those guys are dead.

463
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,359
Competition is tough enough
  as it is.

464
00:32:09,395 --> 00:32:11,628
  That's a terrible
  thing to say, Willy.

465
00:32:11,664 --> 00:32:13,630
  Can I join the party?

466
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:14,932
  Oh, hi, Plommie.

467
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:16,633

just about dead guys?

470
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:23,373
    What?

00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:24,541
The exhibition
downstairs,

472
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:27,911
  how come it's just
  a show of dead guys?

473
00:32:27,947 --> 00:32:30,914
  Well, we thought that--
  all the old members

474
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,750
  have left such a wealth
  of illustrations--

475
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:35,619
  How about a show
  of just the guys

477
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:40,324
  Was that a...

478
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:41,892
  fun idea, Wilson?

479
00:32:41,927 --> 00:32:43,226
  Is it like a joke?

480
00:32:43,262 --> 00:32:45,762
  It's a serious idea.

481
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:48,231

It's poor
taste, Wilson.

484
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,570
    Yes, it is.

485
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:55,639
  Maybe he was just
  making a kind of joke

486
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:57,841
  and it didn't come off.
Yeah.

487
00:32:57,876 --> 00:33:01,578
  No, no joke.

488
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:04,848

about a thing like that.
