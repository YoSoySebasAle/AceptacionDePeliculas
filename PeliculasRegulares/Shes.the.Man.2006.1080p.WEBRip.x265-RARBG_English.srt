Oh! She shoots,
she scores! Goal!

40
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,990
- What? That's right! Give it!
- Nice kick.

41
00:02:39,073 --> 00:02:40,824
- Very nice kick.
- Give me the ball!

42
00:02:40,907 --> 00:02:42,990
Ow! Justin!

43
00:02:43,073 --> 00:02:46,323
- Drop... Put me down!
- OK. Down like...

44
00:02:46,407 --> 00:02:48,323
Oh, sorry.

45
00:02:48,407 --> 00:02:50,907
- Ooh, goodness.
- Hey!

46
00:02:53,448 --> 00:02:54,865
Mmm.

47
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:56,782
OK, you are
really getting good.

48
00:02:56,865 --> 00:02:58,365
Aw, you too.

49
00:02:58,448 --> 00:03:00,156
I mean, when we
first started going out,

50
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,824
you couldn't kiss at all.

51
00:03:01,907 --> 00:03:05,156
- I meant at soccer.
- Aww. Really?

52
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,615
Absolutely. You're...

53
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:10,448
...probably already better
than half the guys on my team.

54
00:03:10,532 --> 00:03:14,073
Mm, probably more
than half.

55
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,782
What do you mean,
I couldn't kiss at all?

56
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:22,573
Don't worry.
I've taught you well.

57
00:03:25,281 --> 00:03:27,990
I know.

58
00:03:28,073 --> 00:03:31,031
Oww! OK, but
seriously, don't you think

59
00:03:31,115 --> 00:03:33,657
you'd get more playing time
at a school like Michigan?

60
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,532
Yeah, maybe,
but it's always been

61
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,156
about being a Tar Heel
for me.

62
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,865
I'm gonna wear
that Carolina blue.

63
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:41,699
- Yeah.
- Yeah, baby!

64
00:03:41,782 --> 00:03:44,365
OK, what is the lacrosse team
doing on our field?

65
00:03:44,448 --> 00:03:46,532
- The school cut our team.
- Wait, what?

66
00:03:46,615 --> 00:03:49,240
- Not enough girls signed up.
- So they just cut us?

67
00:03:49,323 --> 00:03:51,615
They can't do that.

68
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,532
OK. This is not over.

69
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,699
Hi, girls.
I heard the bad news.

70
00:04:03,782 --> 00:04:06,073
"Bad"? It's a disaster.

71
00:04:06,156 --> 00:04:08,949
- Now college scouts, they won't even get to see us play.
- Yeah.

72
00:04:09,031 --> 00:04:12,740
I know. If there's anything
I can do, just say the word.

73
00:04:12,824 --> 00:04:14,240
As a matter of fact, there is.

74
00:04:14,323 --> 00:04:15,907
We wanna try out
for the boys team.

75
00:04:18,031 --> 00:04:19,782
Uh, anything besides that.

76
00:04:19,865 --> 00:04:22,240
Coach, come on!
You know that we're good enough.

77
00:04:22,323 --> 00:04:26,073
I don't know that
that's a thing that I know.

78
00:04:26,156 --> 00:04:27,281
What?

79
00:04:27,365 --> 00:04:29,073
All we're asking for
is one shot.

80
00:04:29,156 --> 00:04:30,865
- Yeah.
- Girls,

81
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:33,532
we have two weeks
before school starts.

82
00:04:33,615 --> 00:04:38,365
Then we open against Illyria.
A rivalry game. We have to win.

83
00:04:38,448 --> 00:04:40,031
And we can help you win.

84
00:04:40,115 --> 00:04:41,782
Hey, baby.

85
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:42,824
Hey.

86
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,281
What's going on, coach?

87
00:04:44,365 --> 00:04:48,782
Umm, the girls here want
to try out for the team.

88
00:04:50,365 --> 00:04:52,990
- You're not serious.
- All right, all right!

89
00:04:53,073 --> 00:04:55,281
You're all excellent players.

90
00:04:55,365 --> 00:04:58,323
But girls aren't as fast as boys.
- Right.

91
00:04:58,407 --> 00:05:02,073
- What?
- Or as strong. Or as athletic.

92
00:05:02,156 --> 00:05:05,407
This is not me talking.
It's a scientific fact.

93
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:09,281
Girls can't beat boys.
It's as simple as that.

94
00:05:09,365 --> 00:05:11,323
OK. Well, Justin,
you're the team captain.

95
00:05:11,407 --> 00:05:13,657
What do you think about it?

96
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,448
I think the coach said it all.

97
00:05:16,532 --> 00:05:20,115
Yesterday you told me that I was better than half the guys on your team.

98
00:05:20,198 --> 00:05:23,073
What?

99
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,615
I never said that.

100
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,532
What are you talking about?
Why are you lying?!

101
00:05:27,615 --> 00:05:30,156
Viola! End of discussion.

102
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,824
Yeah, tell her, man.

103
00:05:31,907 --> 00:05:34,532
Fine. End of relationship.

104
00:05:34,615 --> 00:05:36,782
Ohhh!

105
00:05:36,865 --> 00:05:40,281
- Come on, let's go.
- Baby, don't be like that. I...

106
00:05:40,365 --> 00:05:41,949
I just don't want
to see you get hurt.

107
00:05:42,031 --> 00:05:44,699
Aww. You are so full of...

108
00:05:44,782 --> 00:05:46,657

It's so good to see you too.

Mm. I'm looking for Sebastian.
Where is he?

OK. Does he have your number?
1-800-BEYOTCH?

And this is why
I don't bring friends over.

130
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:50,573
Mom, not now. I had
a really bad day, so...

131
00:06:50,657 --> 00:06:52,740
This is just the thing
to just perk you up.

132
00:06:52,824 --> 00:06:54,198
- Hold on.
- OK.

133
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:55,573
- Keep your eyes closed.
- OK.

134
00:06:55,657 --> 00:06:57,573
Eyes closed, eyes closed,
closed, closed.

135
00:06:57,657 --> 00:06:59,407
They're closed.

136
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,031
All right. Surprise!

137
00:07:03,615 --> 00:07:07,407
Beautiful gowns
for my darling debutante.

138
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,699
Mom, have I not told you
a thousand times?

139
00:07:09,782 --> 00:07:11,782
I have no interest
in being a debutante.

140
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:13,782
It's totally archaic.

141
00:07:13,865 --> 00:07:15,573
How could I wind up
with a daughter

142
00:07:15,657 --> 00:07:19,115
who only wants to kick a muddy
ball around a field all day?

143
00:07:19,198 --> 00:07:22,782
Well, the world has been set
right, Mom. They cut my team.

144
00:07:22,865 --> 00:07:26,198
- What? No soccer?
- Yeah, that's right. No soccer.

145
00:07:26,281 --> 00:07:27,407
How sad.

146
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,115
Yeah, I can see
you're all torn up.

147
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:32,740
Well, Justin's
gonna love you in this.

148
00:07:32,824 --> 00:07:35,448
Yet another reason not
to wear it. I dumped him.

149
00:07:35,532 --> 00:07:37,907
What? Why?

150
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,115
I don't wanna talk about it.

151
00:07:39,198 --> 00:07:42,115
He's so handsome and rugged

152
00:07:42,198 --> 00:07:45,156
and chiseled and great.

153
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,865
Then why don't
you date him, Mom?

154
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,573
No, I couldn't

155
00:07:52,657 --> 00:07:54,073
- Hey, Sebastian.
- Hey.

156
00:07:54,156 --> 00:07:55,615
- You OK?
- Uh-huh.

157
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:58,657
- Monique was looking for you.
- Mmm.

158
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,615
Why do you even date her,
anyway?

159
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:02,448
She's hot.

160
00:08:02,532 --> 00:08:03,490
It's a guy thing.

161
00:08:03,573 --> 00:08:05,949
Yuck. But she's so awful.

162
00:08:06,031 --> 00:08:07,949
Mmph!

163
00:08:08,031 --> 00:08:10,782
Hey, you know, you
could use the front door.

164
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,156
And Mom can't see me.

165
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,657
She thinks I'm staying at Dad's.
Dad thinks I'm staying at Mom's.

166
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,490
In two days they both think
that I'm going away to school.

167
00:08:18,573 --> 00:08:20,323
That is the beauty of divorce.

168
00:08:20,407 --> 00:08:21,782
Wait, where are you going?

169
00:08:21,865 --> 00:08:23,490
London for a couple of weeks.

170
00:08:23,573 --> 00:08:25,365
As in London, England?

171
00:08:25,448 --> 00:08:28,031
Yeah, my band got a slot
in a music festival there.

172
00:08:28,115 --> 00:08:30,824
OK, what are you
gonna do about school?

173
00:08:30,907 --> 00:08:34,490
Yeah, I was kind of hoping
you could help me with that.

174
00:08:34,573 --> 00:08:36,990
Could you just, like,
pretend to be Mom,

175
00:08:37,073 --> 00:08:38,824
call Illyria,
tell them I'm sick?

176
00:08:38,907 --> 00:08:41,365
Something that sounds like
it would last for two weeks,

177
00:08:41,448 --> 00:08:42,657
like mad cow.

178
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,156
Sebastian, you
just got kicked out

179
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,615
of Cornwall for skipping.
This is not exactly the way

180
00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:49,031
you want to start out.

181
00:08:49,115 --> 00:08:50,699
Hey, I want to be a musician.

182
00:08:50,782 --> 00:08:53,573
Last time I heard, they don't
need to know trigonometry.

183
00:08:53,657 --> 00:08:56,073
Besides, if you want
to chase your dreams,

184
00:08:56,156 --> 00:08:58,699
sometimes you gotta break
the rules, right?

185
00:08:58,782 --> 00:09:01,824
You know the percentage of bands
that make it to the big time?

186
00:09:01,907 --> 00:09:04,365
Probably the same
as female soccer players.

187
00:09:04,448 --> 00:09:07,156
I will see you in two weeks.

188
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,240
- Sebastian.
- Ow!

189
00:09:09,323 --> 00:09:10,699
Sebastian!

190
00:09:10,782 --> 00:09:12,156
Were you talking
with your brother?

191
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,699
No. Yes.

192
00:09:14,782 --> 00:09:18,156
On the phone.
He's at Dad's. Bye, Dad.

193
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,365
Picture this:

194
00:09:19,448 --> 00:09:21,323
We're at the country club,

195
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,990
they call your name,
and you emerge in this.

196
00:09:25,073 --> 00:09:27,824
Ta-da!

197
00:09:27,907 --> 00:09:29,865
Echh. No.

198
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:33,573
Sorry, Mom. I have
a strict no-ruffles policy.

199
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:39,448
Sometimes I just think you just
might as well be your brother.

200
00:09:39,532 --> 00:09:44,115
Hmm. You know what?

201
00:09:44,198 --> 00:09:45,740
If you can't join them,

202
00:09:45,824 --> 00:09:47,907
beat them.

203
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:52,365
You want me to turn
you into your brother?

204
00:09:52,448 --> 00:09:55,031
That's right. I'm going
to Illyria as Sebastian.

205
00:09:55,115 --> 00:09:56,573
I'll make the boys soccer team,

206
00:09:56,657 --> 00:09:58,907
and in 12 days, I'll beat
the Cornwall boys team.

207
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:02,198
- That's right!
- You've taken way too many soccer balls to the head.

208
00:10:02,281 --> 00:10:04,198
You know I can do it, Paul.

209
00:10:04,281 --> 00:10:05,907
Except for the voice
and the mannerisms

210
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:08,240
and the breasts
and the mentality and....

211
00:10:08,323 --> 00:10:09,573
Besides, it doesn't matter.

212
00:10:09,657 --> 00:10:11,448
Nobody at Illyria
has even met Sebastian.

213
00:10:11,532 --> 00:10:13,240
They wouldn't know
the difference.

214
00:10:13,323 --> 00:10:14,573
They'll know he's a girl.

215
00:10:14,657 --> 00:10:16,240
Oh, come on, Paul.

216
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:17,740
Yeah, come on, Paul.

217
00:10:17,824 --> 00:10:19,699
Yeah, come on, Paul.

218
00:10:22,198 --> 00:10:25,615
OK. OK.
I'll see what I can do.

219
00:10:25,699 --> 00:10:27,657

Mom, I told you! I'm going
to Dad's house for two weeks.

239
00:11:28,907 --> 00:11:30,990
No, you didn't.
And you're not going.

240
00:11:31,073 --> 00:11:33,365
We've hardly spent any time
together this summer.

241
00:11:33,448 --> 00:11:35,198
Now, you just go
upstairs and unpack.

242
00:11:35,281 --> 00:11:37,490
OK, Mom, I thought
about what you said.

243
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:41,407
And you know Monique is gonna
be there 24/7 with Sebastian,

244
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,907
so, I don't know,
I was just thinking

245
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,699
that maybe she'd
show me the ropes

246
00:11:45,782 --> 00:11:47,532
on the whole debutante thing.

247
00:11:47,615 --> 00:11:50,990
- This is so exciting!
- Isn't it?!

248
00:11:51,073 --> 00:11:52,490
You're gonna have so much fun.

249
00:11:52,573 --> 00:11:54,740
Now, there's the formal ball.
And the luncheon.

250
00:11:54,824 --> 00:11:57,365
And, oh, did I mention
the fundraiser next week?

251
00:11:57,448 --> 00:11:59,573
It's gonna be a carnival!

252
00:11:59,657 --> 00:12:01,240
Look out!

253
00:12:01,323 --> 00:12:02,907
Your brother promised
to be there,

254
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,031
so remind him when you
see him, all right?

255
00:12:05,115 --> 00:12:09,031
Oh, my little girl.
You're finally gonna be a lady!

256
00:12:33,115 --> 00:12:35,240
Are you sure I can do this?!

257
00:12:35,323 --> 00:12:37,448
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

258
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,031
What's up?

259
00:12:44,115 --> 00:12:45,573
Oh, my God, he knew!

260
00:12:45,657 --> 00:12:48,407
- I wanna go home!
- Relax. He was being friendly!

261
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:51,573
We're not going home! Stop it!
I did not spend all this time...

262
00:12:51,657 --> 00:12:54,115
- It's your fault! Drive home!
- My idea?! You asked me!

263
00:12:54,198 --> 00:12:56,198
- I did your hair and makeup!
- Reverse!

264
00:12:56,281 --> 00:12:58,782
- I want to go!
- That was not easy! You're being a girl!

265
00:12:58,865 --> 00:13:00,907
- We're not going. Go.
- Come on! Drive!

266
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,448
- He was being friendly.
- All right!

267
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:05,490
Now, let's run through it
one more time.

268
00:13:05,573 --> 00:13:06,782
Let me hear the voice.

269
00:13:08,031 --> 00:13:11,573
Hey. What's up? I'm Sebastian.

270
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,699
OK. Now show me the strut.

271
00:13:18,073 --> 00:13:19,323
Now, hawk a loogie.

272
00:13:21,865 --> 00:13:24,240
I'm so proud!

273
00:13:24,323 --> 00:13:26,573
- Get off me!
- Remember,

274
00:13:26,657 --> 00:13:28,949
inside every girl
there's a boy.

275
00:13:29,031 --> 00:13:31,573
That came out wrong.
But you know what I mean.

276
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,990
Vi.

277
00:13:38,323 --> 00:13:39,490

You must be my roommates.

303

Wha... what's your name?

304
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,407
Sebastian Hastings.

305
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,073
Duke Orsino.

306
00:15:25,699 --> 00:15:27,031
Umm, OK.

307
00:15:27,115 --> 00:15:29,532
OK, OK, OK. Umm...

308
00:15:29,615 --> 00:15:31,865
This is Andrew and Toby.
They live next door.

309
00:15:31,949 --> 00:15:34,907
Yeah. Freshman dorm's
that-a-way, twiglet.

310
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,407
Seriously, how old are you?

311
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:39,073
I skipped a couple grades.

312
00:15:39,156 --> 00:15:42,699
I'm brilliant.
Shh.

313
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:51,490
Anyway, do you know
when soccer tryouts start?

314
00:15:51,573 --> 00:15:53,115
Noon. You play?

315
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:57,448
Absolutely. Center forward.
You know it, bro.

316
00:15:57,532 --> 00:16:00,156
So you play
the beautiful game... bro?

317
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,573
Brothers? Brethren?

318
00:16:02,657 --> 00:16:06,115
Yeah, I'm a striker.
Andrew and Toby are halfbacks.

319
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:07,824
Schveet.

320
00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:11,865
OK, why do you have tampons
in your boot?

321
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,407
Um...

322
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,490
I get really bad nose bleeds.

323
00:16:21,573 --> 00:16:23,865
So you stick them up your nose?

324
00:16:25,532 --> 00:16:26,824
Yeah.

325
00:16:26,907 --> 00:16:31,073
What? You've never done that?

326
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,782
Oh, my...
Beckham does it all the time.

327
00:16:33,865 --> 00:16:35,532
- Seriously?
- Yes.

328
00:16:35,615 --> 00:16:37,824
- Look. I'll just show you how to do it.
- Ahh!

329
00:16:37,907 --> 00:16:40,699
Take that off and....

330
00:16:40,782 --> 00:16:43,532
...whatever that is.

331
00:16:43,615 --> 00:16:46,156
And you stick it right in.

332
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,490
It absorbs right up.

333
00:16:49,949 --> 00:16:51,657
Are you kidding me?

334
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,990
That's disgusting.

335
00:16:53,073 --> 00:16:54,990
Oh, my God,
your roommate's a freak.

336
00:16:55,073 --> 00:16:56,657
That's so disgusting.

337
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,699
Let's start the season
how we finished the last.

338
00:17:00,782 --> 00:17:03,365
Sharp!

339
00:17:05,448 --> 00:17:08,407
What are you,
the runt of the family?

340
00:17:17,156 --> 00:17:19,407
OK, shirts and skins.

341
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:23,198
Pardon me, sir.
I have to be a shirt.

342
00:17:23,281 --> 00:17:26,281
- What?
- I'm allergic to the sun.

343
00:17:27,657 --> 00:17:29,365
You're allergic to the sun?

344
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:33,407
Very, very, very
deathly, deathly allergic.

345
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,240
We like to accommodate
here at Illyria.

346
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:39,740
So I'll follow you around with
a parasol. All right, Nancy boy?

347
00:17:42,115 --> 00:17:45,031
You're a shirt.

348
00:17:45,115 --> 00:17:48,031
OK, guys, let's go.

349
00:17:48,115 --> 00:17:50,407
One, two, three!

350
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,865
One, two, three!
One, two, three!

351
00:18:37,198 --> 00:18:38,281
At ease, gentlemen.

352
00:18:42,365 --> 00:18:47,115
I've seen a lot of energy
and commitment out there today.

353
00:18:47,198 --> 00:18:49,448
And that makes a coach proud.

354
00:18:49,532 --> 00:18:53,115
Now, I want to split us up into
first string and second string.

355
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:56,949
You second-stringers,
don't take it too hard.

356
00:18:57,031 --> 00:18:59,782
You're just as much part of this
team as the first-stringers.

357
00:18:59,865 --> 00:19:01,949
Apart from, of course,

358
00:19:02,031 --> 00:19:03,281
playing the game part.

359
00:19:03,365 --> 00:19:05,323
Schuler.

360
00:19:07,407 --> 00:19:09,198
Haims.

361
00:19:11,532 --> 00:19:12,865
Potensky.

362
00:19:14,573 --> 00:19:16,490
Donner.

363
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:20,115
Hastings.

364
00:19:20,198 --> 00:19:22,990
Second string.

365
00:19:23,073 --> 00:19:25,198
The rest of you,
congratulations.

366
00:19:25,281 --> 00:19:26,281
First-stringers.

367
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:27,907
Now, hit the showers.

368
00:19:29,949 --> 00:19:31,990
Shower time.

369
00:19:32,073 --> 00:19:34,198
Shower time?

370
00:19:40,073 --> 00:19:43,990
- Hastings! No shower for you.
- OK.

371
00:19:44,073 --> 00:19:47,865
Principal Gold wants
to see you in his office.

372
00:19:52,907 --> 00:19:57,198
I'm over. It's done. They know.

373
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,240
Sebastian's file.

374
00:20:07,323 --> 00:20:09,824
Sebastian...

375
00:20:09,907 --> 00:20:12,281
Could it be any bigger?

376
00:20:13,281 --> 00:20:15,407
Mr. Hastings.

377
00:20:18,323 --> 00:20:20,323
Horatio Gold...

378
00:20:20,407 --> 00:20:21,990
...headmaster.

379
00:20:22,073 --> 00:20:25,365
So very pleased to meet you.
So very, very pleased.

380
00:20:25,448 --> 00:20:28,490
Hello, sir.
Heard you wanted to see me.

381
00:20:28,573 --> 00:20:31,031
I'd like to say welcome.

382
00:20:31,115 --> 00:20:32,699
♪ Welcome to Illyria ♪

383
00:20:32,782 --> 00:20:35,198

385
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:43,448
I just wanted to have you in
to say welcome.

386
00:20:43,532 --> 00:20:44,907
See how you're doing.

387
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,865
Ah... Yeah,
I'm doing great, you know?

388
00:20:46,949 --> 00:20:49,073
Just...
...busy being a guy.

389
00:20:49,156 --> 00:20:51,115
Being a guy. Yeah.

390
00:20:51,198 --> 00:20:53,407
Well, let's take a look
at your file, Sebastian.

391
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,615
And...

392
00:20:55,699 --> 00:20:59,949
Seems to be... stuck a bit.

393
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:03,073
There we go. All right.

394
00:21:03,156 --> 00:21:05,490
OK. Well...

395
00:21:07,448 --> 00:21:13,115
OK, you're busted.

396
00:21:13,198 --> 00:21:17,198
I know you don't wanna sit here and talk to the headmaster,
but I won't take no for an answer.

397
00:21:17,281 --> 00:21:19,532
Now, have a sit
in the headmaster's chair.

398
00:21:19,615 --> 00:21:21,740
Come on, have a sit.

399
00:21:21,824 --> 00:21:24,657
Sit it.

400
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:29,073
So, Sebastian Hastings.

401
00:21:29,156 --> 00:21:30,323
How do you like campus?

402
00:21:30,407 --> 00:21:31,615
Beautiful.

403
00:21:31,699 --> 00:21:33,281
You've been inspired

404
00:21:33,365 --> 00:21:36,115
by the charcoal black
and candy apple red?

405
00:21:36,198 --> 00:21:37,615
You know it.

406
00:21:37,699 --> 00:21:39,490
Hey!

407
00:21:39,573 --> 00:21:43,448
Don't touch it. Ever. Ever.
Do not do that.

408
00:21:43,532 --> 00:21:47,490
You know, Sebastian, I was
a transfer student myself...

409
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:49,115
...once upon a time.

410
00:21:49,198 --> 00:21:50,990
Back when dinosaurs
roamed the earth.

411
00:21:51,073 --> 00:21:53,156
So I keep
a special interest

412
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,824
in the transfer students
that come to this school.

413
00:21:55,907 --> 00:21:59,448
Act as a...
unofficial big brother.

414
00:21:59,532 --> 00:22:03,824
Don't be surprised if I just pop in unannounced
from time to time just to check up.

415
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:07,198
Yeah, I look forward to it.

416
00:22:07,281 --> 00:22:09,782
Now scoot!

417
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,532
- Ahh!
- Sorry.

418
00:22:15,615 --> 00:22:17,782
- That's OK. Don't worry about it.
- My fault.

419
00:22:17,865 --> 00:22:19,323
What is...?

420
00:22:19,407 --> 00:22:24,198
Ohh. Getting to know
the opposite sex, are we?

421
00:22:24,281 --> 00:22:28,156
Male-female dynamics.
All that sexual tension.

422
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,615
It's all part of the high school
experience. So continue. Please.

423
00:22:31,699 --> 00:22:33,657
But keep it clean, though. OK.

424
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,949
Abstinence is key.
Abstinence is...

425
00:22:36,031 --> 00:22:38,657
The best way to not is to not.

426
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,281
Uh...

427
00:22:40,365 --> 00:22:42,323
Hmm? Yes.

428
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,824
Is he always that friendly?

429
00:22:48,907 --> 00:22:51,365
Are you kidding?
That's him being rude.

430
00:22:51,448 --> 00:22:53,365
Huh.

431
00:22:53,448 --> 00:22:54,699
All right.

432
00:22:54,782 --> 00:22:56,198
Ooh, cute shoes.

433
00:22:56,281 --> 00:22:57,740
You think so? I got them
at Anthropologie.

434
00:22:57,824 --> 00:22:59,407
No way! They have shoes there?

435
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:04,198
- Oh, yeah. Right by the accessories.
- Huh.

436
00:23:04,281 --> 00:23:06,365
Here are your books.

437
00:23:06,448 --> 00:23:08,031
Thanks.

438
00:23:08,115 --> 00:23:09,699
Well, I guess I'm gonna,

439
00:23:09,782 --> 00:23:13,740
you know, go take care of
some guy stuff.

440
00:23:13,824 --> 00:23:15,240
OK.

441
00:23:18,323 --> 00:23:23,323
There you go.
Have a great apple and sandwich.

442
00:23:23,407 --> 00:23:24,740
Hi! I would love a...

443
00:23:24,824 --> 00:23:25,865
- No.
- But...

444
00:23:25,949 --> 00:23:29,448
Hey, dudes. Mind if I join?

445
00:23:30,115 --> 00:23:31,407
Thanks.

446
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,907
So those soccer tryouts
were bogus, huh?

447
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:39,323
I mean, second string? Come on,
that's ridiculous. Am I right? Am I right?

448
00:23:41,365 --> 00:23:44,073
So the game against Cornwall,
that should be interesting.

449
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:45,907
And why would that
be interesting?

450
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,907
Well, my sister goes there,

451
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,907
and she used to date
that tool Justin Drayton.

452
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,740
I know him.

453
00:23:52,824 --> 00:23:55,448
- I made him cry once during a game.
- Wait.

454
00:23:55,532 --> 00:23:57,407
- That was you?
- Absolutely.

455
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,407
- That was so funny.
- Wow.

456
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:01,949
Is your sister hot?

457
00:24:02,031 --> 00:24:05,949
Uhh... I guess so.

458
00:24:06,031 --> 00:24:07,782
She's got a great personality.

459
00:24:07,865 --> 00:24:09,865
- Ahh.
- Eww.

460
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,490
Incoming.

461
00:24:15,907 --> 00:24:19,573
Oh, yeah! Check out the booty
on that blondie.

462
00:24:19,657 --> 00:24:21,990
- Uh-oh.
- Don't talk about her that way.

463
00:24:22,073 --> 00:24:24,115
Oh. Is that your girlfriend?

464
00:24:24,198 --> 00:24:26,907
He wishes.

465
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:29,615
She was dating this
college guy, but he dumped her.

466
00:24:29,699 --> 00:24:32,115
I hear she's a total mess
right now, really vulnerable.

467
00:24:32,198 --> 00:24:34,615
Confidence, self-esteem
is way down.

468
00:24:34,699 --> 00:24:36,281
In man words,
it's time to pounce.

469
00:24:36,365 --> 00:24:37,990
Exactly.

470
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:43,323
I hate that guy.

471
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,240
Did you know bologna
is 38 percent hoof?

472
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:52,490
Thanks, Malcolm.

473
00:24:52,573 --> 00:24:55,448
Uh-oh. Looks like you
got some competition.

474
00:24:55,532 --> 00:24:58,073
- It's just Malcolm.
- Total geek.

475
00:25:00,073 --> 00:25:04,115
She looks so sad.
It's heartbreaking.

476
00:25:04,198 --> 00:25:06,990
It... it's just...
I can relate, you know?

477
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:09,990
I mean, I just got out
of a bad relationship too.

478
00:25:10,073 --> 00:25:13,281
I mean, you think
you know someone.

479
00:25:13,365 --> 00:25:16,990
And you realize it's
all been a big lie.

480
00:25:17,073 --> 00:25:19,156
Every touch.

481
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,657
Every kiss.

482
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:26,323
Plus, you know, you can
never get chicks to shut up.

483
00:25:26,407 --> 00:25:29,365
All right, guys,
catch up with you later.

484
00:25:36,907 --> 00:25:39,782
Empty shower.

485
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,699
Yes!

486
00:25:42,782 --> 00:25:44,699
♪ I get to take a shower ♪

487
00:25:44,782 --> 00:25:47,907
♪ I get to take a shower ♪

488
00:25:50,657 --> 00:25:53,365
Whoo!

489
00:25:56,115 --> 00:25:59,198
Uh... Malcolm Festes,
dorm director.

490
00:25:59,281 --> 00:26:01,407
Shower shoes are to be worn
in the bathroom at all times

491
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:04,031
except when
in the actual shower.

492
00:26:04,115 --> 00:26:06,865
Did you not read
your Dorm Life pamphlet?

493
00:26:06,949 --> 00:26:08,156
It was in your cubby.

494
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,532
Ohh!

495
00:26:10,615 --> 00:26:12,699
Wassup, dawg?

496
00:26:12,782 --> 00:26:15,156
Yeah. OK, homey.

497
00:26:20,198 --> 00:26:22,240
Mm. Later.

498
00:26:22,323 --> 00:26:26,615
Hey. You forgot... this, Coolio.

499
00:26:26,699 --> 00:26:28,824
Word, G-Money.

500
00:26:48,031 --> 00:26:49,115
Ahh!

501
00:26:49,198 --> 00:26:51,990
OK, Hastings, you're up!

502
00:26:53,865 --> 00:26:55,365
Hastings, are you deaf?!

503
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:58,240
Come on, let's go!

504
00:26:58,323 --> 00:27:01,824
Get your butt out there!
Come on!

505
00:27:01,907 --> 00:27:04,115
- Get out!
- Ohh!

506
00:27:04,198 --> 00:27:06,573
Jesus!

507
00:27:10,699 --> 00:27:12,990
Whoa! Ohh!

508
00:27:25,865 --> 00:27:28,573
Come on, baby. Come on.

509
00:27:30,865 --> 00:27:33,532
Ohh!

510
00:27:41,031 --> 00:27:43,365
Rise and shine.

511
00:27:46,115 --> 00:27:47,990
Wait! Let go!

512
00:27:48,073 --> 00:27:49,156
Let go!

513
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,740
Welcome to hell!

514
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:04,490
Gentlemen! Let me present
this year's soccer newbies!

515
00:28:04,573 --> 00:28:06,657
But first, you
must remove your clothes!

516
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,490
Remove their clothes!
Remove their clothes!

517
00:28:09,573 --> 00:28:11,031
Take your clothes off now!

518
00:28:11,115 --> 00:28:13,156
Remove their clothes!
Remove their clothes!

519
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,699
Hello. My life sucks.

520
00:28:31,782 --> 00:28:33,073
- I'm done!
- What?

521
00:28:33,156 --> 00:28:34,865
Everybody thinks I'm
a huge loser deviant.

522
00:28:34,949 --> 00:28:37,031
I'll never see
the field against Cornwall.

523
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:40,323
And I smell so bad
I'm convulsing people.

524
00:28:40,407 --> 00:28:41,907
Pick me up, take me home

525
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:44,365
and make sure I never do
anything like this again.

526
00:28:44,448 --> 00:28:46,198
Look, Vi, I don't know
what to tell you

527
00:28:46,281 --> 00:28:49,365
about the whole
soccer team...

528
00:28:49,448 --> 00:28:51,699
...but as for the social stuff,
I got an idea.

529
00:28:51,782 --> 00:28:54,198
- You do?
- Yeah.

530
00:28:54,281 --> 00:28:57,532
We're gonna show everybody
the man that you really are.

531
00:28:57,615 --> 00:28:59,323
And how are we gonna do that?

532
00:28:59,407 --> 00:29:00,865
Go, Viola.

533
00:29:03,198 --> 00:29:04,907
High five.

534
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,740
Nice.

535
00:29:06,824 --> 00:29:09,740
Aw, man. Look who's here.

536
00:29:09,824 --> 00:29:11,782
Foxy mama.

537
00:29:11,865 --> 00:29:15,031
Uh.. Uh... uh... don't look
at him. Maybe he won't see us.

538
00:29:15,115 --> 00:29:18,281
Spread out so it looks
like we got no room.

539
00:29:20,198 --> 00:29:22,740
- What's up?
- What's up?

540
00:29:22,824 --> 00:29:24,615
Go, Kia.

Aw, Kia.

544
00:29:35,949 --> 00:29:37,907
Hey, girl.
How you doing, baby?

545
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:40,407
- Not the same without you.
- I know. I'm sorry.

546
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:43,532
New school, new babe pool.

547
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,073
I miss you, Sebastian.

548
00:29:46,156 --> 00:29:48,782
I've been thinking
about you a lot.

549
00:29:48,865 --> 00:29:50,323
- Especially at night.
- Sweet.

550
00:29:50,407 --> 00:29:52,782
- Late.
- Even better.

551
00:29:52,865 --> 00:29:54,615
OK, did she just say that
to Sebastian?

552
00:29:54,699 --> 00:29:57,490
- What just happened?
- Oh, Sebastian.

553
00:29:57,573 --> 00:30:00,740
OK, big, mournful sigh. "Uhh."
Bittersweet farewell.

554
00:30:00,824 --> 00:30:02,240
You're his plaything, baby.

555
00:30:02,323 --> 00:30:04,448
It was really great
to see you, Sebastian.

556
00:30:04,532 --> 00:30:07,865
Call me anytime.

557
00:30:14,573 --> 00:30:16,156
I'd tap that.

558
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,740
Thank you, Kia. You're
gorgeous. And go, Yvonne.

560
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,615

Hey, what's going on, Yvonne?

564
00:30:30,573 --> 00:30:32,615
- Who's this one?
- Nothing.

565
00:30:32,699 --> 00:30:36,615
I mean, our school lost
its top gun, Sebastian Hastings.

566
00:30:36,699 --> 00:30:41,657
Well, time comes for a man
to move along, Yvonne.

567
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,365
I know, Sebastian.

568
00:30:44,448 --> 00:30:46,281
In the end I wasn't
woman enough for you.

569
00:30:46,365 --> 00:30:47,990
No, you weren't.

570
00:30:48,073 --> 00:30:50,699
That's something
I'll always have to live with.

571
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:51,949
It just hurts, that's all.

572
00:30:52,031 --> 00:30:53,365
Love is pain.

573
00:30:53,448 --> 00:30:56,699
Just know I'll
never forget you, Sebastian.

574
00:30:56,782 --> 00:31:01,198
Ever! Never!

575

Needy.

576
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:12,198
OK. We might need to do
a little reevaluating here.

577
00:31:12,281 --> 00:31:14,323
- Yeah.
- Hey there, pretty lady.

578
00:31:14,407 --> 00:31:18,532
Eww. What...?
What are you, hitting on me?

579
00:31:18,615 --> 00:31:20,156
I was just...

580
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,240
"I was just..."

581
00:31:22,323 --> 00:31:25,657
OK, let me put a stop to that
little brain fart right now.

582
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,532
Girls with asses like mine

583
00:31:27,615 --> 00:31:29,865
do not talk to boys
with faces like yours.

584
00:31:32,949 --> 00:31:37,448
I'm looking for my boyfriend Sebastian Hastings.
Have you guys seen him?

585
00:31:39,115 --> 00:31:40,865
Sebastian?

586
00:31:40,949 --> 00:31:43,365
Not good. Don't let her get
too close, she'll recognize you.

587
00:31:43,448 --> 00:31:45,532
What am I gonna do?

588
00:31:45,615 --> 00:31:48,031
- Keep away from me!
- I beg your pardon?!

589
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:51,073
Pretty ladies. OK, don't
come any closer, Monique.

590
00:31:51,156 --> 00:31:53,073
- Sebastian!
- It's over!

591
00:31:53,156 --> 00:31:54,949
What are you talking about?!

592
00:31:55,031 --> 00:31:57,740
- I don't want to talk to you, crazy!
- Sebastian, come back here.

593
00:31:57,824 --> 00:31:59,865
You're hot, Monique.
Smoking hot.

594
00:31:59,949 --> 00:32:01,907
Come here. Get! Get! Get!

595
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:04,865
- But there are plenty of hot girls out there.
- Come back here.

596
00:32:04,949 --> 00:32:08,240
And the truth is,
you have absolutely

597
00:32:08,323 --> 00:32:10,240
nothing else to offer.

598
00:32:10,323 --> 00:32:14,073
And when my eyes are closed, I
see you for what you truly are,

599
00:32:14,156 --> 00:32:16,073
which is ugly!

600
00:32:16,156 --> 00:32:17,907
We're done!

601
00:32:20,824 --> 00:32:24,281
Whoo! That was amazing!

602
00:32:24,365 --> 00:32:26,115
You the man!

603

What's wrong with you guys?
Make some room for the man.

604
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,115
- Sit down!
- Whoo-whee!

605

my idol now, man.

- Hey, Sebastian.
- Lovelies.

of my way right now?

641

I gotta be completely honest.

642
00:34:26,281 --> 00:34:28,907
The whole dissecting thing
kind of freaks me out.

to take the reins on this one.

comes in

and suddenly she's
acting like some...

679
00:38:05,073 --> 00:38:08,657

I'll do some digging,
I'll find out what it is,

684
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:23,073
and I'll nip his chances
with Olivia right in the bud.

- Miss me?
- What's going on?

689
00:38:35,573 --> 00:38:37,156
What's wrong with your voice?

690
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,573

a little bit of a cold.

It was so cool, Vi.

696
00:38:49,573 --> 00:38:52,615
We went on a couple days early,
and the crowd flipped for us.

697
00:38:52,699 --> 00:38:53,990
They wanted an encore,

698
00:38:54,073 --> 00:38:56,031

acoustically.

- They went nuts for my lyrics.
- Oh, that's so cool.

700
00:38:58,615 --> 00:39:00,323
And you were right
about Monique.

701
00:39:00,407 --> 00:39:01,865
She's history.

702
00:39:01,949 --> 00:39:04,115
She really is, isn't she?

703
00:39:04,198 --> 00:39:06,031
I got to go.
I'll talk to you later.

704
00:39:06,115 --> 00:39:08,615
OK. Bye.

705
00:39:08,699 --> 00:39:11,490
Trouble with your wig,
Hastings?

706
00:39:11,573 --> 00:39:14,448
Uh, no, I actually...
I have a scalp condition.

707
00:39:14,532 --> 00:39:16,156
- No, you don't.
- Yeah, I do.

708
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,824
I really do. It's really
acting up during the...

709
00:39:18,907 --> 00:39:20,990
No, you don't.

710
00:39:21,073 --> 00:39:23,490
You've got
male pattern baldness.

711
00:39:23,573 --> 00:39:25,657
Scoot over, kiddo.

712
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,782
I don't know if you've realized,

713
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,156
but recently I've
started to thin out myself.

714
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,365
I've tried all the creams
and the butters,

715
00:39:33,448 --> 00:39:36,407
and I still can't seem to stop
Mother Nature's vindictive fury,

716
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:39,156
and neither can you. OK?

717
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,198
There's gonna be a time
when you'll have to come out

718
00:39:41,281 --> 00:39:44,073
of the closet and just accept
yourself for who you are.

719
00:39:44,156 --> 00:39:45,699
A baldy. OK?

720
00:39:45,782 --> 00:39:48,323
But it's gonna be
all right. OK?

721
00:39:48,407 --> 00:39:52,073
Oh, and between you and me,
chicks dig it.

722
00:39:54,824 --> 00:39:57,824
Hang ten. Yeah.

723
00:39:57,907 --> 00:40:00,365
Hi, Olivia. I
don't want you to be worried,

724
00:40:00,448 --> 00:40:01,407
but Malvolio's missing.

725
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:03,365
- Oh, no!
- Yeah.

726
00:40:03,448 --> 00:40:06,198
If you see him, don't feed him.
He has an irritable bowel.

727
00:40:06,281 --> 00:40:08,865
Yeah. 'Cause that would be
my very first instinct.

728
00:40:08,949 --> 00:40:12,281
To feed the tarantula.

729
00:40:15,824 --> 00:40:17,573
Hmm.

730
00:40:17,657 --> 00:40:19,740
Here's a wild idea.

731
00:40:19,824 --> 00:40:23,031
Have you ever thought about
going out with Duke Orsino?

732
00:40:23,115 --> 00:40:24,824
I see that.

733
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,407
- Duke?
- Yeah.

734
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:28,740
- No.
- Yeah.

735
00:40:28,824 --> 00:40:29,740
- No.
- Yeah.

736
00:40:29,824 --> 00:40:31,699
- Yeah?
- No!

737
00:40:31,782 --> 00:40:34,198
I mean, he's good-looking
and everything,

738
00:40:34,281 --> 00:40:37,281
but he's just not
the guy for me.

739
00:40:37,365 --> 00:40:39,198
Hmm. I don't know.

740
00:40:39,281 --> 00:40:41,865
Think there may be more
to him than you think there is.

741
00:40:41,949 --> 00:40:45,073
So you're telling me he's
not just another dumb jock

742
00:40:45,156 --> 00:40:46,365
who wants to hook up with me

743
00:40:46,448 --> 00:40:48,699
so he could tell
his friends, but too...?

744
00:40:48,782 --> 00:40:50,073
Insecure to treat you
as an equal?

745
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,907
Exactly.

746
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,156
Tell me about it.

747
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,782
You're the first guy
at this school

748
00:40:54,865 --> 00:40:56,615
who hasn't tried
anything with me.

749
00:40:56,699 --> 00:41:00,615
Trust me,
you're not my type.

750
00:41:00,699 --> 00:41:02,198
Well, why not?

751
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,990
You know, it's just...

752
00:41:08,073 --> 00:41:10,448
...I don't think of you
in that way.

753
00:41:10,532 --> 00:41:12,073
We're friends, you know.

754
00:41:12,156 --> 00:41:14,490
You're actually one
of the few people here

755
00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:16,949
that I feel comfortable around.

756
00:41:17,031 --> 00:41:19,407
I feel the same way
about you.

757
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:22,782
Good. Then just take my advice.

758
00:41:22,865 --> 00:41:25,949
Go out with Duke.

759
00:41:26,031 --> 00:41:29,323
I'll consider it.

760
00:41:29,407 --> 00:41:32,782
So, uh, what is that exactly?

761
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:35,156
Um, I think that's the spleen.

762
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,657
Hmm.

763
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:43,615
- OK, who's your daddy?
- Huh?

764
00:41:43,699 --> 00:41:45,990
I got her to agree to consider
you. You're halfway in.

765
00:41:46,073 --> 00:41:50,657
Uhh! Um, all right, OK.
So should I ask her out?

766
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,490
No. You don't want
to freak her out.

767
00:41:52,573 --> 00:41:56,407
You got to have a casual
conversation first. Hello.

768
00:41:59,949 --> 00:42:03,323
Why do I get the feeling
you don't do this very often?

769
00:42:03,407 --> 00:42:07,031
Man, I just... I'm not
really good at talking to girls.

770
00:42:07,115 --> 00:42:09,281
- Why? You're hot!
- What?

771
00:42:09,365 --> 00:42:11,865
You know,
you're an appealing guy...

772
00:42:11,949 --> 00:42:14,824
Man... guy... guy-man.

773
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:17,990
Look, I don't know. I just
always say the wrong...

774
00:42:18,073 --> 00:42:20,156
I just always
say the wrong thing.

775
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:24,073
OK. All right.
Come on. Let's get up.

776
00:42:24,156 --> 00:42:25,824
I want to try something.

777
00:42:25,907 --> 00:42:27,865
I'll act like a girl, and
you're going to talk to me.

778
00:42:27,949 --> 00:42:29,865
Eww. Do I have to?

779
00:42:29,949 --> 00:42:32,865
Yes!
Because I'm Viola.

780
00:42:32,949 --> 00:42:35,323
- Duke? Nice to meet you.
- That was creepy.

781
00:42:35,407 --> 00:42:37,365
You really just sounded
like a girl just then.

782
00:42:37,448 --> 00:42:39,657
I used to imitate
my sister all the time.

783
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:42,365
I got really good at it.
Come on. And get up!

784
00:42:42,448 --> 00:42:45,323
Come on. Ask me
some questions,

785
00:42:45,407 --> 00:42:48,365
and if the chemistry's right,
things'll just start flowing.

786
00:42:48,448 --> 00:42:51,031
Oh... Um, questions about what?

787
00:42:51,115 --> 00:42:53,740
Anything. Ask me if...

788
00:42:53,824 --> 00:42:55,240
...I like...

789
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:56,281
...cheese.

790
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:59,365
Um, OK.

791
00:42:59,448 --> 00:43:01,782
Do you like cheese?

792
00:43:01,865 --> 00:43:04,740
Why, yes I do.
My favorite's Gouda.

793
00:43:04,824 --> 00:43:08,573
- I like Gouda too.
- See?

794
00:43:08,657 --> 00:43:09,907
- See what?
- We're flowing.

795
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:11,907
We're talking about cheese.

796
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:13,407
So what? Flow is flow.

797
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,699
What? What's that?

798
00:43:15,782 --> 00:43:18,573
What is that?! It touched me!
It touched me! It touched me!

799
00:43:18,657 --> 00:43:21,907
It's Malcolm's tarantula!
Get it!

800
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:24,532
- You get it!
- You're the guy!

801
00:43:24,615 --> 00:43:25,782
The bigger guy.

802
00:43:36,031 --> 00:43:37,907
Sorry!

803
00:43:38,031 --> 00:43:41,281
You don't ever, ever do
that girl voice again!

804
00:43:41,365 --> 00:43:43,323
- Freaked me out!
- My bad.

805
00:43:47,865 --> 00:43:50,156
Sebastian, honey,
this is your mother.

806
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,156
I'm calling to remind you
about the carnival tomorrow.

807
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:56,448
You and your sister promised
you'd both be there. Bye-bye.

808
00:43:56,532 --> 00:44:00,448
Crap! Forgot about that!

809
00:44:00,532 --> 00:44:02,573
Wait, your mom's
in Junior League?

810
00:44:02,657 --> 00:44:03,907
Yeah. How'd you know?

811
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:06,490
So is mine. I gotta go too.

00:44:06,573 --> 00:44:08,156
But I can't deal
with this right now.

813
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,907

to worry about.

00:44:12,198 --> 00:44:13,240
Olivia's gonna be there.

- Sebastian! Where are you going?
- Monique's behind me.

886
00:47:34,573 --> 00:47:37,365
- We're on it.
- Sebastian!

887
00:47:42,949 --> 00:47:44,323
Ahh!

888
00:47:44,407 --> 00:47:46,115
Excuse me. No one
over 8 years old

889
00:47:46,198 --> 00:47:47,699
is allowed
inside the Moon Bounce.

890
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:49,573
But I just saw my boyfriend
go in there.

891
00:47:49,657 --> 00:47:51,365
The correct term
is "ex-boyfriend."

892
00:47:51,448 --> 00:47:54,699
No relationship is over
until I say it is. Understand?

893
00:47:54,782 --> 00:47:57,323
Whatever. You're still not
getting on that Moon Bounce.

894
00:47:57,407 --> 00:47:59,240
Fine.

895
00:48:04,323 --> 00:48:05,532
What's that?

896
00:48:05,615 --> 00:48:07,490
Kia, don't look.

897
00:48:07,573 --> 00:48:10,156
Oh! God!

898
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,407
- She's gone.
- Thank you.

899
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:29,365
- So are we, uh, having fun?
- Oh, yeah, definitely.

900
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:33,573
Whoo.

901
00:48:33,657 --> 00:48:35,240
What do you think
it will be like?

902
00:48:35,323 --> 00:48:37,115
Duke, you look at me.

903
00:48:37,198 --> 00:48:41,365
I know it's gonna be
really, really special.

904
00:48:41,448 --> 00:48:44,073
I mean, she's only kissed
like 350 guys at this point.

905
00:48:44,156 --> 00:48:46,907
I just think we need
to acknowledge the moment.

906
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:48,865
After four years,
Duke is finally

907
00:48:48,949 --> 00:48:51,365
gonna fulfill his destiny.

908
00:48:51,448 --> 00:48:56,240
Life is good.
Life is fair. Life is just.

909
00:48:56,323 --> 00:48:58,073
Hi, um, I'm your relief.

910
00:48:58,156 --> 00:48:59,407
And yet....

911
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:00,407
Thank God.

912
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:02,198
I can't catch a break.

913
00:49:02,281 --> 00:49:07,407
Beware of the old guy
chewing gum. It's not gum.

914
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:08,907
Echh.

915
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:12,115
- Do I know you?
- No.

916
00:49:12,198 --> 00:49:15,615
- Huh.
- That's just my luck.

917
00:49:15,699 --> 00:49:18,615
No. No, no, no. I mean,
I didn't mean it like that.

918
00:49:18,699 --> 00:49:22,115
It's just, you know,
she's, you know.... No. OK.

919
00:49:22,198 --> 00:49:26,156
I mean, on the other hand,
you're, you know, also...

920
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:30,073
- I am? Thanks, I guess.
- Yeah.

921
00:49:30,156 --> 00:49:32,407
You don't have to flirt
with her first, genius.

922
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:33,740
You're paying for it.

923
00:49:33,824 --> 00:49:38,657
Why don't you just...
relax. Um...

924
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:42,323
Um, maybe I should
kiss you now.

925
00:49:42,407 --> 00:49:46,782
I gave that girl my ticket,
and I waited in line.

926
00:49:46,865 --> 00:49:49,949
Well, it's the least
I can do.

927
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:57,448
Uh, OK. Here I go.

928
00:49:57,532 --> 00:50:01,907
Um... Uh...

929
00:50:09,407 --> 00:50:11,365
OK, I think that was
one ticket's worth.

930
00:50:11,448 --> 00:50:13,031
No, you get a little bit more.

931
00:50:13,115 --> 00:50:15,990
Excuse me.
The motel's across the street.

932
00:50:16,073 --> 00:50:17,699
Viola, what the hell is this?!

933
00:50:17,782 --> 00:50:19,949
Back of the line, buttball.

934
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:23,281
Excuse me, doofus. You're
making out with my girlfriend.

935
00:50:23,365 --> 00:50:25,532
Ex-girlfriend.

936
00:50:25,615 --> 00:50:27,323
Whoa, you're Sebastian's sister?

937
00:50:27,407 --> 00:50:29,657
And you're about to die.

938
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:31,490
Are you gonna drown me
in your tears?

939
00:50:31,573 --> 00:50:33,990
I did not cry during that game.
I had something in my eye.

940
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:36,824
You know what, guys?
Can we just dial it down?

941
00:50:36,907 --> 00:50:39,532
And just step away, OK?

942
00:50:39,615 --> 00:50:42,031
She's right. I'll see you
on the soccer field,

943
00:50:42,115 --> 00:50:44,699
and we'll settle
this all then.

944
00:50:44,782 --> 00:50:46,573
OK, Duke.

945
00:50:46,657 --> 00:50:49,532
Or we can straighten it out
right here.

946
00:50:49,615 --> 00:50:51,740
Justin! Stop it! Guys!

947
00:50:54,281 --> 00:50:56,198
♪ All right ♪

948
00:50:56,281 --> 00:50:58,031
Stop it! Justin!

949
00:50:58,115 --> 00:51:00,615
Guys! Stop it!

950
00:51:03,407 --> 00:51:07,448
Justin, get off!

951
00:51:17,323 --> 00:51:19,949
Where's my daughter?!

952
00:51:20,031 --> 00:51:22,031
Excuse me. I'm so sorry.

953
00:51:22,115 --> 00:51:25,740
Viola! Stop!
This isn't ladylike.

954
00:51:25,824 --> 00:51:28,407
There is no room
for violence here!

955
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:32,907
This is a lovely children's
carnival, goddamn it!

956
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:35,949
Both of you, out! Now!

957
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:42,865
Where were you at today?
You just disappeared.

958
00:51:42,949 --> 00:51:46,073
Ran into my psycho ex.
Had to bolt.

959
00:51:46,156 --> 00:51:48,240
Oh, my God! Is that a...?

960
00:51:48,323 --> 00:51:51,240
What? Oh. Yeah.

961
00:51:51,323 --> 00:51:55,573
I hope you don't mind. I kind
of borrowed one of your...

962
00:51:55,657 --> 00:51:58,740
Yeah. And you're right, by the
way. These things actually work.

963
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,949
Oh, my God, you're bleeding.
Are you OK?

964
00:52:01,031 --> 00:52:03,281
- Um...
- I mean,

965
00:52:03,365 --> 00:52:05,907
suck it up! Be a man!

966
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:07,615
Rub some dirt in it!

967
00:52:07,699 --> 00:52:10,490
OK, I'll
rub some dirt on it.

968
00:52:10,573 --> 00:52:13,657
So, what happened?

969
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:15,949
I got into it
with your sister's ex.

970
00:52:16,031 --> 00:52:19,448
Wait. Really? Why?

971
00:52:19,532 --> 00:52:24,407
He saw me and her kind of
making out at the kissing booth.

972
00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:27,281
Wait. You kissed her?

973
00:52:27,365 --> 00:52:30,240
Yeah, man, I'm...
I hope that's OK.

974
00:52:30,323 --> 00:52:32,115
It was for charity.

975
00:52:32,198 --> 00:52:35,281
Oh, no, I mean, dude, I mean,

976
00:52:35,365 --> 00:52:39,281
if you want to kiss her, you go
right ahead and you kiss her!

977
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:41,031
I mean, knock yourself out.

978
00:52:41,115 --> 00:52:44,782
I mean, you just...
you take her and then kiss her

979
00:52:44,865 --> 00:52:46,365
and then kiss
the crap out of her!

980
00:52:46,448 --> 00:52:49,240
OK.

981
00:52:52,407 --> 00:52:54,824
So...

982
00:52:54,907 --> 00:52:56,281
...do you like her?

983
00:52:56,365 --> 00:53:00,323
I don't know.
Can we not talk about this?

984
00:53:00,407 --> 00:53:02,031
She's your sister.
It's kind of weird.

985
00:53:02,115 --> 00:53:04,115
No. Right. Right.

986
00:53:04,198 --> 00:53:09,156
Just... You know,
I was just thinking that,

987
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,782
if you liked her then...

988
00:53:11,865 --> 00:53:14,323
...maybe you
should ask her out.

989
00:53:14,407 --> 00:53:17,615
And just, I don't know,
forget about Olivia?

990
00:53:17,699 --> 00:53:22,073
Well, I mean speaking
as a completely objective

991
00:53:22,156 --> 00:53:23,865
third-party outsider

992
00:53:23,949 --> 00:53:27,532
with absolutely no personal
interest in the matter,

993
00:53:27,615 --> 00:53:31,240
I am not sure
that you and Olivia

994
00:53:31,323 --> 00:53:34,532
really mesh well together.
You know? I mean...

995
00:53:34,615 --> 00:53:37,865
But you and Viola...

996
00:53:37,949 --> 00:53:40,198
...I mean...

997
00:53:40,281 --> 00:53:41,699
...be magic.

998
00:53:41,782 --> 00:53:43,031
I don't know.

999
00:53:43,115 --> 00:53:44,865
What does your heart tell you?

1000
00:53:44,949 --> 00:53:47,365
- Huh?
- I mean,

1001
00:53:47,448 --> 00:53:48,865
which one would you
rather see naked?!

1002
00:53:48,949 --> 00:53:52,365
Why do you...? Why?
Why do you always do that?

1003
00:53:52,448 --> 00:53:54,031
Why do you always talk
about girls

1004
00:53:54,115 --> 00:53:56,865
in such graphic terms? Huh?

1005
00:53:56,949 --> 00:53:59,198
You know what?
You... you have issues.

1006
00:53:59,281 --> 00:54:03,532
You're a really
sensitive guy, aren't you?

1007
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:08,407
What? No.
No, it's just...

1008
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:11,073
I don't know.
I just think that

1009
00:54:11,156 --> 00:54:15,407
relationships should be more
than just the physical stuff.

1010
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:18,073
Don't get me wrong,
that stuff's important,

1011
00:54:18,156 --> 00:54:19,573
but, I don't know,
when I'm with someone,

1012
00:54:19,657 --> 00:54:23,740
I want to be able
to talk about other stuff.

1013
00:54:23,824 --> 00:54:26,740
Like, I don't know,
serious stuff.

1014
00:54:26,824 --> 00:54:30,990
Stuff I can't talk about,
you know, with anyone else.

1015
00:54:33,156 --> 00:54:36,407
Yeah, like...

1016
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:39,115
...what kind of stuff?

1017
00:54:39,198 --> 00:54:41,532
I don't know,
just stuff.

1018
00:54:41,615 --> 00:54:44,990
Like, whatever stuff there is.

1019
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:48,657
Like... this kind of stuff?

1020
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:52,156
Yeah.

1021
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,907
But what I just told you
is for your ears only.

1022
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:59,031
If you tell anyone,
I'll kick your ass.

1023
00:55:02,073 --> 00:55:04,281
Yeah. No.

1024
00:55:04,365 --> 00:55:07,573
I got your back, man.

1025
00:55:07,657 --> 00:55:10,657

Good. Why?

00:56:33,281 --> 00:56:35,365
I don't know.

1043
00:56:35,448 --> 00:56:38,573
I kind of was thinking
I might ask if she wanted

1044
00:56:38,657 --> 00:56:40,740
to grab dinner
at Cesario's tonight.

1045
00:56:40,824 --> 00:56:42,907
You were? Really?

1046
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:44,532
I'd love to.

1047
00:56:44,615 --> 00:56:45,865
What?

1048
00:56:45,949 --> 00:56:48,031
I'd love to give her
your phone number.

1049
00:56:48,115 --> 00:56:50,323
Hastings!

1050
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:53,240
Yeah, coach?

1051
00:56:53,323 --> 00:56:55,573
You're first string
for the Cornwall game.

1052
00:56:55,657 --> 00:56:57,073
- Really?
- No.

1053
00:56:57,156 --> 00:57:01,949
I was joking, you idiot.

1054
00:57:02,031 --> 00:57:04,281
Dude, that's awesome.

1055
00:57:06,657 --> 00:57:10,031
- Mmm.
- Um... um, dude.

1056
00:57:12,615 --> 00:57:15,573
- So you want me to spot you?
- No.

1057
00:57:15,657 --> 00:57:17,198
Isn't he cute?

1058
00:57:17,281 --> 00:57:18,573
Duke? Yeah.

1059
00:57:18,657 --> 00:57:21,907
No. Sebastian.
He's so cool.

1060
00:57:21,990 --> 00:57:25,407
But he said
I'm not his type.

1061
00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:28,115
- That's impossible. You're everyone's type.
- Not his.

1062
00:57:28,198 --> 00:57:30,281
I could tell you what
us mere mortals would do

1063
00:57:30,365 --> 00:57:32,115
in this situation.

1064
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:34,657
- What?
- Make him jealous.

1065
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:37,824
So, what do you do? You just
pretend to like somebody else?

1066
00:57:37,907 --> 00:57:41,281
Mm-hm. And then
use him shamelessly.

1067
00:57:41,365 --> 00:57:42,657
Wow.

1068
00:57:44,990 --> 00:57:48,156
So you should call Viola up.

1069
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:51,365
Yeah. I think I will.

1070
00:57:53,323 --> 00:57:54,407
Hey, Duke.

1071
00:57:54,490 --> 00:57:56,615
Sebastian.

1072
00:57:56,699 --> 00:57:57,782
Olivia.

1073
00:57:57,865 --> 00:57:59,240
Olivia.

1074
00:57:59,323 --> 00:58:01,615
What're you bench-pressing
these days?

1075
00:58:01,699 --> 00:58:03,323
225.

1076
00:58:03,407 --> 00:58:04,907
Very impressive.

1077
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:06,782
Thanks.

1078
00:58:06,865 --> 00:58:10,281
So, Duke, about that call
that you were gonna make.

1079
00:58:10,365 --> 00:58:12,740
- You gonna make that?
- Yeah. Thank you.

1080
00:58:12,824 --> 00:58:15,532
So how many reps
can you do with that 225?

1081
00:58:15,615 --> 00:58:19,281
Like 20... 20.

1082
00:58:19,365 --> 00:58:22,198
225 is more than twice
what I weigh.

1083
00:58:22,281 --> 00:58:24,615
How many reps
could you do with me?

1084
00:58:26,031 --> 00:58:28,657
Forty.

1085
00:58:33,573 --> 00:58:34,657
Hello?

1086
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:36,031
Hi, it's Viola.

1087
00:58:36,115 --> 00:58:39,115
Sebastian told me to call you.

1088
00:58:39,198 --> 00:58:40,323
I'd love to go to dinner.

1089
00:58:40,407 --> 00:58:42,365
Um, yeah. What?

1090
00:58:42,448 --> 00:58:45,198
Um... can I call you back?

1091
00:58:45,281 --> 00:58:48,115
Because I gotta...

1092
00:58:48,198 --> 00:58:50,615
...change my feet.

1093
00:58:50,699 --> 00:58:55,031
So, uh, do you have
any plans tonight?

1094
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:57,824
Oh! My bad.

1095
00:58:57,907 --> 00:58:59,532
What about the thing
that we talked about

1096
00:58:59,615 --> 00:59:01,699
that you were
going to do later?

1097
00:59:01,782 --> 00:59:03,490
What thing?
I'm thingless.

1098
00:59:03,573 --> 00:59:07,198
Great! Then it's a date.
Cesario's, 8:00.

1099
00:59:07,281 --> 00:59:10,699
- I'll see you there.
- OK.

1100
00:59:10,782 --> 00:59:11,699
Bye, Sebastian.

1101
00:59:11,782 --> 00:59:13,115
Later.

1102
00:59:16,115 --> 00:59:18,699
Yeah! Mm!

1103
00:59:18,782 --> 00:59:19,990
You did it.

1104
00:59:20,073 --> 00:59:22,031
♪ I'm goin' out with Olivia ♪

1105
00:59:22,115 --> 00:59:24,865
What the hell?! I thought
you liked Viola now!

1106
00:59:24,949 --> 00:59:27,990
Dude, come on.
You're a guy.

1107
00:59:28,073 --> 00:59:29,156
What would you do

1108
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,824
if the hottest girl
in the school

1109
00:59:31,907 --> 00:59:36,573
came up to you
and asked you on a date?

1110
00:59:36,657 --> 00:59:38,031
I'll be right back.

1111
00:59:38,115 --> 00:59:41,407
Olivia? Hi. Can I talk
to you for a second?

1112
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:43,865
Moi? Whatever for?

1113
00:59:43,949 --> 00:59:45,407
It's about your date
with Duke.

1114
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:47,740
Oh! I know! I am
so glad I listened to you.

1115
00:59:47,824 --> 00:59:49,907
You're right.
He's awesome.

1116
00:59:49,990 --> 00:59:55,281
And he looked so good
in those shorts. Whoo!

1117
00:59:55,365 --> 00:59:58,281
He's not a piece
of meat, Olivia.

1118
00:59:58,365 --> 01:00:01,240
He's a man.
A man with feelings.

1119
01:00:01,323 --> 01:00:03,699
And I'm a woman
with feelings.

1120
01:00:03,782 --> 01:00:06,907
And my feelings
seem to match his.

1121
01:00:06,990 --> 01:00:09,365
You know what?

1122
01:00:09,448 --> 01:00:11,699
Speaking as
a completely objective

1123
01:00:11,782 --> 01:00:13,240
third-party observer

1124
01:00:13,323 --> 01:00:16,073
with absolutely no personal
interest in the matter,

1125
01:00:16,156 --> 01:00:19,782
I'm not so sure that you and
Duke are a good idea after all.

1126
01:00:19,865 --> 01:00:21,782
Well, thank you
for your concern.

1127
01:00:21,865 --> 01:00:23,573
And if you're so worried,

1128
01:00:23,657 --> 01:00:25,824
maybe you should come
to Cesario's tonight,

1129
01:00:25,907 --> 01:00:28,240
just to keep an eye on me.

1130
01:00:28,323 --> 01:00:30,156
We could double.

1131
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:33,448
I bet Eunice is available.

1132
01:00:33,532 --> 01:00:37,782
I'm so there, it's insane.

1133
01:00:49,365 --> 01:00:53,532
So do you like... cheese?

1134
01:00:58,198 --> 01:01:00,407
Hey, you two, what's going on?

1135
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:01,782
You're here...

1136
01:01:01,865 --> 01:01:04,115
...with Eunice.

1137
01:01:04,198 --> 01:01:05,156
Mind if we join?

1138
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:06,949
- No. Sit down.
- No, no, no.

1139
01:01:07,031 --> 01:01:09,407
Lady pterodactyl.

1140
01:01:10,573 --> 01:01:12,740
Waiter!

1141
01:01:13,865 --> 01:01:15,198
Help.

1142
01:01:18,448 --> 01:01:19,949
So...

1143
01:01:20,031 --> 01:01:22,448
...I was just telling Duke
how great it is

1144
01:01:22,532 --> 01:01:25,323
to meet a real man
at this school.

1145
01:01:25,407 --> 01:01:27,323
Uh, you were?

1146
01:01:27,407 --> 01:01:29,657
Well, I was just about to.

1147
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:32,031
Isn't it great to have
a real man around, Eunice?

1148
01:01:32,115 --> 01:01:34,281
Oh, yes.

1149
01:01:34,365 --> 01:01:37,407
A real man
is difficult to find.

1150
01:01:40,031 --> 01:01:41,532
So difficult.

1151
01:01:41,615 --> 01:01:44,031
Sebastian's with Eunice.

1152
01:01:44,115 --> 01:01:46,156
She must be hotter
than I thought.

1153
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:49,073
How come when I wanted to ask out Eunice everyone made fun of me?

1154
01:01:49,156 --> 01:01:51,365
Now Sebastian likes her,
and suddenly she's cool?

1155
01:01:51,448 --> 01:01:53,448
Screw you guys.
I hate high school.

1156
01:01:54,615 --> 01:01:57,657
Eunice! Hands!

1157
01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:59,532
You know what?
This has been real fun,

1158
01:01:59,615 --> 01:02:02,240
but I have to go...

1159
01:02:02,323 --> 01:02:04,407
...shave.

1160
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:06,990
OK.

1161
01:02:08,407 --> 01:02:10,865
Well, this has been lovely.

1162
01:02:10,949 --> 01:02:12,365
Um, let's do it again sometime.

1163
01:02:12,448 --> 01:02:13,657
What?

1164
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:16,115
Soon. Bye.

1165
01:02:17,782 --> 01:02:19,990
So, um...

1166
01:02:21,323 --> 01:02:23,407
...do you like cheese?

1167
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:28,115
More than almost
any other animal byproduct.

1168
01:02:28,198 --> 01:02:30,740
Yeah, check please.

1169
01:02:30,824 --> 01:02:32,407
Hey, Monique, it's Sebastian.

1170
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:34,407
I don't know if Viola
told you I'm in London,

1171
01:02:34,490 --> 01:02:37,031
but I'm heading home
a day early.

1172
01:02:37,115 --> 01:02:39,699
Listen, I've been thinking,

1173
01:02:39,782 --> 01:02:43,240
and we really need to talk.

1174
01:02:43,323 --> 01:02:45,407
Ladies...

1175
01:02:45,490 --> 01:02:47,365
Ladies.

1176
01:02:48,323 --> 01:02:49,615
Welcome.

1177
01:02:49,699 --> 01:02:51,699
My name is Cheryl Lancaster.

1178
01:02:51,782 --> 01:02:53,907
I'm president
of the Stratford Junior League

1179
01:02:53,990 --> 01:02:56,281
and coordinator
of this year's debutante season.

1180
01:02:56,365 --> 01:02:58,740
Oh, please.

1181
01:02:58,824 --> 01:03:01,615
Thank you. Today we're
gonna go over the guidelines

1182
01:03:01,699 --> 01:03:06,949
for a graceful, ladylike
entrée into society.

1183
01:03:08,156 --> 01:03:11,990
Son of a...

1184
01:03:12,073 --> 01:03:13,407
Hello.

1185
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:16,198
Hello there.

1186
01:03:20,657 --> 01:03:22,573
- Hi.
- Make sure she's in the back

1187
01:03:22,657 --> 01:03:23,782
for the group photo.

1188
01:03:23,865 --> 01:03:27,073
Thank you for joining us, Viola.

1189
01:03:27,156 --> 01:03:30,240
Now, who's ready to come out?

1190
01:03:30,323 --> 01:03:31,323
Kill me.

1191
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:52,490
- Viola? Darling.
- Huh?

1192
01:03:52,573 --> 01:03:56,907
Remember, chew like
you have a secret.

1193
01:04:04,198 --> 01:04:06,907
Excuse me.

1194
01:04:08,907 --> 01:04:11,198
Ladies.

1195
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:24,281
Hi

1196
01:04:24,365 --> 01:04:25,824
Hey.

1197
01:04:25,907 --> 01:04:27,490
Hey! You're the one
that saved me

1198
01:04:27,573 --> 01:04:29,323
in the kissing booth
that one time, right?

1199
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:32,156
- Oh. Hi.
- Hi.

1200
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:35,240
Oh, what a small world.
I'm Viola.

1201
01:04:35,323 --> 01:04:36,532
Olivia.

1202
01:04:36,615 --> 01:04:39,115
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

1203
01:04:42,615 --> 01:04:44,699
So... Oh.

1204
01:04:44,782 --> 01:04:46,407
I know it's none
of my business,

1205
01:04:46,490 --> 01:04:49,073
but you went out with
that Duke Orsino guy, right?

1206
01:04:49,156 --> 01:04:52,532
Yeah. Once.

1207
01:04:52,615 --> 01:04:54,990
- Did you kiss him?
- No, why?

1208
01:04:55,073 --> 01:04:58,532
Oh, no. It's nothing,
but... Echh.

1209
01:04:58,615 --> 01:05:01,198
Just try to postpone it
as long as possible.

1210
01:05:01,281 --> 01:05:05,031
He has this, uh,
salivary gland condition.

1211
01:05:05,115 --> 01:05:09,198
Yeah. He doesn't really
like to talk about it,

1212
01:05:09,281 --> 01:05:11,740
but it felt like I was
drowning.

1213
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:14,073
- Really?
- Mm.

1214
01:05:14,156 --> 01:05:17,448
- Oh, my God, ew.
- I know. It was repulsive.

1215
01:05:17,532 --> 01:05:20,573
But, hey, every happiness
to you both.

1216
01:05:20,657 --> 01:05:25,031
Uh... No, um, actually,
I don't really like Duke.

1217
01:05:25,115 --> 01:05:29,949
Um, I have this huge thing
for his roommate, Sebastian.

1218
01:05:30,031 --> 01:05:34,323
And I was just trying
to make Sebastian jealous.

1219
01:05:41,448 --> 01:05:43,281
Oh, boy.

1220
01:05:43,365 --> 01:05:46,115
Yeah, I know it's really wrong
to use a person this way,

1221
01:05:46,198 --> 01:05:49,281
and I feel
really terrible about it.

1222
01:05:49,365 --> 01:05:51,240
But I really, really
like Sebastian.

1223
01:05:51,323 --> 01:05:53,281
He's so handsome.

1224
01:05:53,365 --> 01:05:56,073
He's not the goonish handsome
you see in a lot of guys.

1225
01:05:56,156 --> 01:06:00,323
He's a delicate, like, even
refined handsome, you know?

1226
01:06:00,407 --> 01:06:06,073
Oh, and when he smiles, I just
can't stop looking at him.

1227
01:06:06,156 --> 01:06:08,907
He's just so wonderful.

1228
01:06:08,990 --> 01:06:11,448
You know, Olivia...

1229
01:06:11,532 --> 01:06:13,115
- It's Olivia, right?
- Yeah.

1230
01:06:13,198 --> 01:06:16,782
I'm gonna give you
just a little advice.

1231
01:06:16,865 --> 01:06:18,573
- OK.
- Enough is enough!

1232
01:06:18,657 --> 01:06:22,782
You are weaving
a really tangled web.

1233
01:06:22,865 --> 01:06:24,448
Yeah, like
really, really tangled.

1234
01:06:24,532 --> 01:06:27,782
And, um, honey...
...you got to stop!

1235
01:06:27,865 --> 01:06:30,990
OK? So you just gotta tell
everybody the truth.

1236
01:06:31,073 --> 01:06:32,448
Be very, very honest.

1237
01:06:32,532 --> 01:06:35,365
Just let the chips fall
where they may.

1238
01:06:35,448 --> 01:06:37,448
- You're right.
- I know.

1239
01:06:37,532 --> 01:06:40,115
The next time I see Sebastian
I'll march right up to him.

1240
01:06:40,198 --> 01:06:42,365
- You march!
- And I'll tell him how I feel.

1241
01:06:42,448 --> 01:06:43,657
You tell him.

1242
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:45,699
Then I'll kiss him
so passionately...

1243
01:06:45,782 --> 01:06:48,824
- What?
- ...that even the people he hates will feel pleasure.

1244
01:06:51,407 --> 01:06:52,865
Hello, Viola.

1245
01:06:52,949 --> 01:06:54,490
Oh, this is not good.

1246
01:06:54,573 --> 01:06:57,657
And hello to you,
you little homewrecker.

1247
01:06:57,740 --> 01:06:59,156
Uh, who are you?

1248
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:01,532
I am Sebastian's girlfriend.

1249
01:07:01,615 --> 01:07:03,156
Ex-girlfriend.

1250
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:05,448
OK, everybody's got
to stop saying that.

1251
01:07:05,532 --> 01:07:08,532
Oh, you were the one he dumped in the pizza parlor the other day.

1252
01:07:08,615 --> 01:07:11,323
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
He did not dump me.

1253
01:07:11,407 --> 01:07:14,198
We're just going through
a little bit of a rough patch.

1254
01:07:14,281 --> 01:07:17,532
Oh. I heard he dumped you.
He dumped you big.

1255
01:07:17,615 --> 01:07:21,365
It was just
like a big, huge dumping.

1256
01:07:26,615 --> 01:07:28,490
Ahh!

1257
01:07:28,573 --> 01:07:30,824
Are you crazy?!
Are you OK?

1258
01:07:30,907 --> 01:07:32,740
Get out!

1259
01:07:34,323 --> 01:07:37,699
You are messing
with the wrong man!

1260
01:07:42,907 --> 01:07:46,407
Get off me! Get off of me!

1261
01:07:46,490 --> 01:07:48,699
Oww!

1262
01:07:48,782 --> 01:07:51,073
Ahhh!

1263
01:07:54,156 --> 01:07:55,615
Oh!

1264
01:08:00,156 --> 01:08:02,323
Whoa! Whoa!

1265
01:08:12,865 --> 01:08:14,365
- Get off of her!
- Let go of me!

1266
01:08:14,448 --> 01:08:17,699
Ladies! Ladies, stop!

1267
01:08:17,782 --> 01:08:19,782
Please!

1268
01:08:22,532 --> 01:08:27,532
When debutantes disagree
they say it with their eyes.

1269
01:08:29,031 --> 01:08:30,699
Well, Hastings.

1270
01:08:30,782 --> 01:08:34,407
Why is it that I always find you
in the middle of a tussle?

1271
01:08:34,490 --> 01:08:37,782
Bad timing?

1272
01:08:37,865 --> 01:08:39,573
I am convinced
he's hiding something.

1273
01:08:39,657 --> 01:08:43,824
Oh, nonsense, Malcolm. He may
be a little lost and confused,

1274
01:08:43,907 --> 01:08:48,073
but deep down he's an
all-American, red-blooded male.

1275
01:08:48,156 --> 01:08:50,281
- Just like yourself.
- Mom, I will pick out

1276
01:08:50,365 --> 01:08:53,156
my own dress.
And no, I will not wear heels.

1277
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:55,782
Because heels are
a male invention

1278
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:59,240
designed to make
a woman's butt look smaller.

1279
01:08:59,323 --> 01:09:02,490
And to make it harder
for them to run away.

1280
01:09:07,532 --> 01:09:11,740
Malcolm, have you ever tried
to run away in high heels?

1281
01:09:11,824 --> 01:09:14,907
- No, sir, I wouldn't...
- Not that easy. Not that easy.

1282
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:26,532
♪ Such a silly game
we play, ohh ♪

1283
01:09:26,615 --> 01:09:28,615
Don't forget your guitar,
Mr. Hastings.

1284
01:09:28,699 --> 01:09:33,532
Just do it. Just close
your eyes and kiss him.

1285
01:09:39,365 --> 01:09:41,573
Sebastian.

1286
01:09:45,532 --> 01:09:47,990
"Wake up. I've been waiting
for you to open your eyes

1287
01:09:48,073 --> 01:09:49,782
so I can tell you
that I think I'm ready.

1288
01:09:49,865 --> 01:09:52,615
I'm ready to free-fall
into the unknown."

1289
01:09:52,699 --> 01:09:55,699
I'll see you
at the game tomorrow.

1290
01:10:00,699 --> 01:10:03,657
I think I'm gonna
like this school.

1291
01:10:10,615 --> 01:10:12,573
Monique, it's Sebastian.

1292
01:10:12,657 --> 01:10:14,532
I don't know if Viola
told you I'm in London,

1293
01:10:14,615 --> 01:10:17,031
but I'm heading home
a day early.

1294
01:10:17,115 --> 01:10:20,657
Listen, I've been thinking.
We really need to talk.

1295
01:10:20,740 --> 01:10:23,865
London?

1296
01:10:23,949 --> 01:10:26,865
Ooh!

1297
01:10:26,949 --> 01:10:29,990
Hey, brother. Dinklage
was looking for you, man.

1298
01:10:30,073 --> 01:10:35,240
Dude. Hello!

1299
01:10:35,323 --> 01:10:38,323
You know, it's, um, crazy

1300
01:10:38,407 --> 01:10:41,198
how wrong you can be
about a person.

1301
01:10:41,281 --> 01:10:44,699
Huh, it's crazy.

1302
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:46,865
You know, you think
that they're one thing,

1303
01:10:46,949 --> 01:10:50,740
and then they turn out
to be the exact opposite.

1304
01:10:50,824 --> 01:10:53,573
- What are you talking about?
- You're gonna sit there

1305
01:10:53,657 --> 01:10:56,615
and act like you don't
know what I'm talking about?

1306
01:10:59,657 --> 01:11:01,448
OK.

1307
01:11:01,532 --> 01:11:04,490
All right. OK.

1308
01:11:06,281 --> 01:11:08,782
I wanted to tell you,
Duke, but...

1309
01:11:08,865 --> 01:11:10,907
...you have to know...

1310
01:11:10,990 --> 01:11:14,115
...I love soccer more than
anything else in the world,

1311
01:11:14,198 --> 01:11:15,615
and I had a point to prove.

1312
01:11:15,699 --> 01:11:18,407
What?! So you're telling me
that you used me

1313
01:11:18,490 --> 01:11:19,865
to help you with soccer,

1314
01:11:19,949 --> 01:11:22,073
and then you turn around
and stab me in the back?

1315
01:11:22,156 --> 01:11:25,615
Wait, what? Now I really don't
know what you're talking about.

1316
01:11:25,699 --> 01:11:27,907
Save it, man.
I saw you with her.

1317
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:30,907
- With who?!
- Who?! Olivia, that's who!

1318
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:32,615
You kissed her
when you got out the cab!

1319
01:11:32,699 --> 01:11:35,073
- What cab?!
- We were supposed to be friends!

1320
01:11:35,156 --> 01:11:37,782
- We are friends!
- You don't know the meaning of the word!

1321
01:11:37,865 --> 01:11:40,281
Olivia never liked you, OK?!

1322
01:11:40,365 --> 01:11:43,115
She was just using you
to make me jealous.

1323
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:45,281
But Viola, she's
crazy about you.

1324
01:11:45,365 --> 01:11:47,782
She has been since the first
moment that you kissed her.

1325
01:11:47,865 --> 01:11:51,323
I bet that's part of your plan.
Distract me so you can move in next to Olivia.

1326
01:11:51,407 --> 01:11:55,824
- That is not what happened!
- You... you and your sister have a good life!

1327
01:11:59,198 --> 01:12:02,949
"The Hastings twins
couldn't be more opposite."

1328
01:12:03,031 --> 01:12:05,115
- Twins?
- Sebastian?

1329
01:12:05,198 --> 01:12:07,907
Sebastian?

1330
01:12:08,031 --> 01:12:09,824
Sebastian, open up!

1331
01:12:09,907 --> 01:12:12,699
It's Monique! You have got
a lot of explaining to do,

1332
01:12:12,782 --> 01:12:15,365
followed by a very long night
of groveling!

1333
01:12:15,448 --> 01:12:19,115
- He's not here!
- Uhh.

1334
01:12:20,699 --> 01:12:21,990
Take his stupid cell phone.

1335
01:12:22,073 --> 01:12:25,532
Justine calls every 10 seconds.

1336
01:12:25,615 --> 01:12:30,615
This isn't
Sebastian's phone.

1337
01:12:30,699 --> 01:12:33,532
God! Sebastian!

1338
01:12:33,615 --> 01:12:36,323
- Sebastian! Ew! Ew!
- Can I help you?

1339
01:12:39,573 --> 01:12:41,657
- Hello?
- Viola. Hey, baby.

1340
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:44,323
It's Justin. You know,
the big game is tomorrow and...

1341
01:12:44,407 --> 01:12:46,657
Viola.

1342
01:12:46,740 --> 01:12:49,323
Allow me to introduce myself.

1343
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:53,532
2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007...

1344
01:12:53,615 --> 01:12:57,156
Nice night. ...2008.

1345
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:59,615
Hey, Eunice.

1346
01:13:01,281 --> 01:13:03,198
Sorry about running out
on our date.

1347
01:13:03,281 --> 01:13:07,907
Oh, that's OK. My intensity
scares some people.

1348
01:13:07,990 --> 01:13:10,198
Yeah.

1349
01:13:10,281 --> 01:13:12,490
Is something wrong?

1350
01:13:12,573 --> 01:13:15,365
Got thrown out of my room.

1351
01:13:15,448 --> 01:13:19,198
You mean... you need
a place to sleep?

1352
01:13:19,281 --> 01:13:23,532
I really do. I mean,
the Cornwall game is tomorrow.

1353
01:13:23,615 --> 01:13:26,782
I've never had
a roommate before.

1354
01:13:37,824 --> 01:13:41,573
Wow. Vi, you set up
all my stuff.

1355
01:13:41,657 --> 01:13:44,407

Dude, what are you doing?!

1364
01:14:12,657 --> 01:14:14,615
Sebastian, the game's
about to start!

1365
01:14:14,699 --> 01:14:17,990
Get out of bed and get
over to the soccer field, man!

1366
01:14:19,323 --> 01:14:22,281
The soccer game?

1367
01:14:22,365 --> 01:14:24,657
That's what that girl
was talking about.

1368
01:14:26,532 --> 01:14:29,740
Sebastian! You're next.
Hurry up.

1369
01:14:29,824 --> 01:14:32,198
Come over here,
and I'll do you.

1370
01:14:36,365 --> 01:14:39,156
OK, ladies, listen up.

1371
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:40,699
Where's Hastings?

1372
01:14:47,198 --> 01:14:48,615
Euni...

1373
01:14:48,699 --> 01:14:50,782
Eunice!
Why didn't you wake me?!

1374
01:14:50,865 --> 01:14:53,532
You looked so serene.

1375
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:57,365
I made breakfast, darling.

1376
01:15:05,907 --> 01:15:08,115
Pardon me. Pardon me.

1377
01:15:14,073 --> 01:15:15,990
What is the big emergency?

1378
01:15:16,073 --> 01:15:18,156
I canceled my squash game
for this.

1379
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:20,782
I don't know.
All that Principal Gold said

1380
01:15:20,865 --> 01:15:24,615
was that we were needed
at Sebastian's soccer game.

1381
01:15:28,907 --> 01:15:31,990
Hasn't Viola said anything
to you the past couple of weeks?

1382
01:15:32,073 --> 01:15:34,323
How should I know?

1383
01:15:34,407 --> 01:15:37,615
She's been living with you.

1384
01:15:38,657 --> 01:15:41,865
Hasn't she?

1385
01:15:41,949 --> 01:15:45,990
- Excuse me.
- This is so exciting, guys.

1386
01:16:07,782 --> 01:16:09,740
Welcome,
ladies and gentlemen.

1387
01:16:09,824 --> 01:16:12,323
Today, the biggest rivalry
in our district is afoot.

1388
01:16:12,407 --> 01:16:14,365
Illyria versus Cornwall.

1389
01:16:14,448 --> 01:16:17,573
It's gonna be something else,
and the atmosphere is crazy!

1390
01:16:18,699 --> 01:16:20,448
Afternoon, gentlemen.

1391
01:16:23,490 --> 01:16:25,490
Handshake, please.

1392
01:16:29,824 --> 01:16:31,990
All right, your call.

1393
01:16:32,990 --> 01:16:34,699
Heads.

1394
01:16:36,031 --> 01:16:37,073
Heads it is.

1395
01:16:37,156 --> 01:16:39,073
We'll stay as we are.

1396
01:16:39,156 --> 01:16:41,782
Good game, gentlemen.

1397
01:16:41,865 --> 01:16:44,156
How's your jaw?

1398
01:16:51,323 --> 01:16:53,615
All right, let's get it on!

1399
01:16:53,699 --> 01:16:55,448
Way to go, boys.

1400
01:16:55,532 --> 01:16:57,240
Listen to me. We can do this.
Today is the day

1401
01:16:57,323 --> 01:16:59,240
- Cornwall beats Illyria.
- Yeah!

1402
01:16:59,323 --> 01:17:01,657
I ain't got much to say to you.

1403
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:04,824
Except for, who's gonna bring that blood and pain?!
- Black and red!

1404
01:17:04,907 --> 01:17:07,407
This ain't gonna be no game. This is a war!
- Yeah!

1405
01:17:07,490 --> 01:17:09,782
Who's gonna bring
that blood and pain?!

1406
01:17:09,865 --> 01:17:13,740
- One, two, three!
- Cornwall!

1407
01:17:13,824 --> 01:17:15,407
Whoo!

1408
01:17:18,699 --> 01:17:20,949
All right, boys,
here we go!

1409
01:17:27,198 --> 01:17:29,740
♪ Let me know
that I've done wrong ♪

1410
01:17:29,824 --> 01:17:34,240
Hastings! Pass it off!
Pass it off! Hastings!

1411
01:17:34,323 --> 01:17:36,407
What in the hell is going on?!

1412
01:17:36,490 --> 01:17:38,532
Nice move, moron.

1413
01:17:41,573 --> 01:17:43,615
What?

1414
01:17:43,699 --> 01:17:46,073
This can't be happening.

1415
01:17:56,115 --> 01:17:58,657
Sebastian?

1416
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:04,156
♪ Don't tell anyone, or you'll
be just another regret ♪

1417
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:06,323
Get the ball! Get the ball!

1418
01:18:06,407 --> 01:18:08,323
Get up and get back
in there! Get the ball!

1419
01:18:08,407 --> 01:18:10,156
Oh, my God, this is my game!

1420
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:12,365
What the hell am I doing here?
This isn't fun.

1421
01:18:12,448 --> 01:18:14,156
Christ! You look like
Bambi on ice, boy!

1422
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:16,115
Sebastian!

1423
01:18:17,448 --> 01:18:18,532
Sebastian!

1424
01:18:21,573 --> 01:18:24,532
Can I get a timeout, please?

1425
01:18:24,615 --> 01:18:27,699
A pause?
One brief halftime?

1426
01:18:27,782 --> 01:18:30,323
- Stopping the clock.
- That's it. Stop the clock.

1427
01:18:30,407 --> 01:18:32,031
What the...?

1428
01:18:32,115 --> 01:18:34,198
I don't know
the technical lingo.

1429
01:18:34,281 --> 01:18:37,031
Armadillos.
Fighting Armadillos, please.

1430
01:18:37,115 --> 01:18:38,865
I need... Gather around.

1431
01:18:38,949 --> 01:18:41,198
I played soccer once as a young man.
Or was it chess?

1432
01:18:41,281 --> 01:18:43,532
Is there a problem, principal?

1433
01:18:43,615 --> 01:18:45,365
Yes. Unfortunately there is.

1434
01:18:45,448 --> 01:18:46,865
But I think it's only right

1435
01:18:46,949 --> 01:18:50,490
that Sebastian Hastings
tell you himself.

1436
01:18:50,573 --> 01:18:54,156
Sebastian? Son? Or...

1437
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:56,573
Do you have anything
you'd like to say?

1438
01:18:56,657 --> 01:18:59,365
Ahhh...

1439
01:18:59,448 --> 01:19:02,699
I'm sorry I'm not
a very good soccer player.

1440
01:19:02,782 --> 01:19:06,031
I see.

1441
01:19:06,115 --> 01:19:10,198
Well then, please know
that what I say...

1442
01:19:10,281 --> 01:19:12,949
...I say with a heavy heart.

1443
01:19:16,990 --> 01:19:19,573
Ladies and gentlemen,
esteemed alumni,

1444
01:19:19,657 --> 01:19:21,949
friends and family
of Sebastian Hastings,

1445
01:19:22,031 --> 01:19:24,073
I am grievously sad...

1446
01:19:24,156 --> 01:19:27,907
- Uh-oh.
- ...to inform you that Sebastian Hastings

1447
01:19:27,990 --> 01:19:31,532
Is... a girl.

1448
01:19:31,615 --> 01:19:34,740
I'm sorry, it's for your own good.
You'll thank me for it someday.

1449
01:19:34,824 --> 01:19:36,031
Oh, OK. Certainly. Yes.

1450
01:19:36,115 --> 01:19:40,073
Excuse me. I'm not a girl.

1451
01:19:40,156 --> 01:19:41,573
Hello! Yes.

1452
01:19:41,657 --> 01:19:43,532
In fact, yes, he is.
He's a big girl.

1453
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:46,365
He's actually specifically
his own sister, Viola,

1454
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:48,281
who's been impersonating him

1455
01:19:48,365 --> 01:19:50,657
for reasons which
will become very clear

1456
01:19:50,740 --> 01:19:52,573
after extensive
psychoanalysis.

1457
01:19:52,657 --> 01:19:55,281
Folks.

1458
01:19:55,365 --> 01:19:58,240
I'm a boy. I promise.

1459
01:19:58,323 --> 01:20:02,073
- Prove it.
- OK.

1460
01:20:02,156 --> 01:20:04,490
Oh!

1461
01:20:04,573 --> 01:20:05,740
God! I saw it.

1462
01:20:05,824 --> 01:20:07,949
Nice work, Paul. Wow.

1463
01:20:08,031 --> 01:20:10,115
That's my boy.

1464
01:20:10,198 --> 01:20:11,573
Kevin, close your eyes.

1465
01:20:11,657 --> 01:20:14,115
Soccer is
the world's favorite sport.

1466
01:20:14,198 --> 01:20:15,949
Thank you. Thank you.

1467
01:20:16,031 --> 01:20:18,573
Nothing to see here.
No offense.

1468
01:20:18,657 --> 01:20:21,573
Folks, please, hang on
for one second.

1469
01:20:21,657 --> 01:20:24,949
Just talk amongst
yourselves for a second.

1470
01:20:25,031 --> 01:20:27,490
Malcolm!

1471
01:20:27,573 --> 01:20:33,281
Can you shed some light
on the current situation?

1472
01:20:33,365 --> 01:20:36,865
Not any more than has
already been shed, sir.

1473
01:20:36,949 --> 01:20:39,657
OK, lads, listen up now.

1474
01:20:39,740 --> 01:20:42,990
Now that we've
established this boy...

1475
01:20:43,073 --> 01:20:45,031
...is a boy...

1476
01:20:45,115 --> 01:20:47,115
...is it possible
we can get back to our game?

1477
01:20:49,407 --> 01:20:53,115
Yes. Oh! Um, enjoy.
That was a skit we...

1478
01:20:53,198 --> 01:20:54,615
OK. Yes.

1479
01:20:54,699 --> 01:20:56,365
Let's get to it, guys.
Come on.

1480
01:20:56,448 --> 01:20:59,156
- I know, let's play.
- Waste of time.

1481
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:04,156
Baby. Baby, baby, baby.
I have missed you so much.

1482
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:06,115
Oh, my God,
we are both so dead.

1483
01:21:06,198 --> 01:21:10,615
We're over, Monique. Done.

1484
01:21:11,490 --> 01:21:14,907
God! Not again!

1485
01:21:15,657 --> 01:21:17,573
Yah!

1486
01:21:19,782 --> 01:21:21,990
Good work, Hastings.

1487
01:21:22,073 --> 01:21:23,824
Bench.

1488
01:21:36,990 --> 01:21:38,365
Good one!

1489
01:21:41,115 --> 01:21:42,782
Halftime, gentlemen.

1490
01:22:03,448 --> 01:22:05,073
,
Sebastian!

1491
01:22:05,156 --> 01:22:06,907
- Vi?
- Yes.

1492
01:22:06,990 --> 01:22:08,407
Why do you look like me?!

1493
01:22:08,490 --> 01:22:10,573
I pretended to be you
the last two weeks

1494
01:22:10,657 --> 01:22:13,281
so I could prove I could
play in the boys soccer team.

1495
01:22:13,365 --> 01:22:15,615
- Yes.
- OK. OK, cool.

1496
01:22:15,699 --> 01:22:19,365
- No, wait! What?!
- I don't have time to explain! Why are you wearing my uniform?

1497
01:22:19,448 --> 01:22:24,073
- I came to find the amazing girl that kissed me last night.
- Who kissed you? What girl?

1498
01:22:24,156 --> 01:22:26,198
Check it out. That one.

1499
01:22:26,281 --> 01:22:28,031
Olivia?

1500
01:22:28,115 --> 01:22:31,240
She was all over me.
She kissed me and then recited my own lyrics.

1501
01:22:31,323 --> 01:22:33,699
Vi, this may be
the girl of my dreams.

1502
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:35,949
That's the kiss that Duke saw.

1503
01:22:36,031 --> 01:22:36,990
Wait, are those real?

1504
01:22:37,073 --> 01:22:38,615
Yeah. I'm growing sideburns now.

1505
01:22:38,699 --> 01:22:40,907
No! Please stay hidden
until the end of the game.

1506
01:22:40,990 --> 01:22:43,949
And give me my uniform
back right now!

1507
01:22:50,532 --> 01:22:53,115
We start the second half.

1508
01:22:53,198 --> 01:22:54,907
Illyria, zero, Cornwall, zero.

1509
01:22:54,990 --> 01:22:56,990
Nothing but a couple
of goose eggs.

1510
01:22:57,073 --> 01:22:58,949
Coach, I'm ready to play.

1511
01:22:59,031 --> 01:23:00,740
Is that what you call it?

1512
01:23:00,824 --> 01:23:03,448
I've seen little girls in tutus
kick the ball better.

1513
01:23:03,532 --> 01:23:05,281
I've changed.

1514
01:23:05,365 --> 01:23:07,990
Come on, coach,
give me one more chance.

1515
01:23:08,073 --> 01:23:09,740
All right. Go.

1516
01:23:09,824 --> 01:23:11,281
Kick. Kill!

01:23:24,573 --> 01:23:28,907

01:24:46,990 --> 01:24:49,907
I'm open!

01:24:49,990 --> 01:24:54,031
Duke! Get back! Get back!

1544
01:24:57,782 --> 01:24:59,740
No!

1545
01:24:59,824 --> 01:25:02,699
Yes, Dan-O, way to go, baby!

1546
01:25:02,782 --> 01:25:05,323
Whoo!

1547
01:25:07,657 --> 01:25:09,949
And Cornwall's right
back in it with a goal.

1548
01:25:11,281 --> 01:25:14,198
Whoo-hoo!

1549
01:25:18,990 --> 01:25:20,907
What's the matter?!
Sebastian was open!

1550
01:25:21,031 --> 01:25:22,824
Rather lose the goal
than let him score?!

1551
01:25:22,907 --> 01:25:24,115
Shut up, man.

1552
01:25:24,198 --> 01:25:26,281
Duke, I know you're mad at me.

1553
01:25:26,365 --> 01:25:28,407
- Don't talk to me.
- I didn't do what you...

1554
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:31,240
- Get out of my face!
- Nothing is going on with me and Olivia!

1555
01:25:31,323 --> 01:25:33,615
When the game is
over I'll explain!

1556
01:25:33,699 --> 01:25:36,990
But for right now, you don't have to like me,
but I'm your teammate, OK?!

1557
01:25:37,073 --> 01:25:39,448
And I want to beat these guys!
I have to beat these guys!

1558
01:25:39,532 --> 01:25:43,281
If we're not disturbing you,
we have a soccer game we'd like to finish.

1559
01:25:43,365 --> 01:25:44,949
Get back in the net, man.

1560
01:25:45,031 --> 01:25:47,281
Or what? You'll hit my
fist with your face again?

1561
01:25:47,365 --> 01:25:49,448
Do you want to see me do it?
Come on, let's go!

1562
01:25:49,532 --> 01:25:50,782
Duke, come on. Stop it.

1563
01:25:50,865 --> 01:25:52,824
- Come on!
- Duke, stop it.

1564
01:25:55,031 --> 01:25:58,156
Sebastian!

1565
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:00,573
Duke! Stop it!

1566
01:26:00,657 --> 01:26:03,156
Come on!

1567
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:04,699
- Ah!
- OK!

1568
01:26:04,782 --> 01:26:07,156
Stop it! Oh, my God!

1569
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:10,323
If you want to roughhouse,
please take it at least 500 yards

1570
01:26:10,407 --> 01:26:13,323
- away from the stadium grounds.
- Break it up! Break it up!

1571
01:26:13,407 --> 01:26:16,365
OK, tough guys.

1572
01:26:16,448 --> 01:26:20,281
You want to box?
You get out of my stadium.

1573
01:26:20,365 --> 01:26:22,490
Otherwise, get on
with the game. All right?

1574
01:26:22,573 --> 01:26:24,699
Come on, now,
Armadillos of Illyria.

1575
01:26:24,782 --> 01:26:26,490
That goes for
the rest of you!

1576
01:26:26,573 --> 01:26:29,949
Now get on and play
some real football!

1577
01:26:30,031 --> 01:26:32,990
- Like a bunch of girls.
- OK.

1578
01:26:33,073 --> 01:26:37,490
The rest of you,
let's play some real football like a bunch of girls.

1579
01:26:37,573 --> 01:26:40,198
- All right?
- You suck!

1580
01:26:40,281 --> 01:26:44,031
It's not football, it's soccer.
That's what we call it in the States.

1581
01:26:44,115 --> 01:26:46,240
- Sebastian! Are you OK?
- Uh-oh.

1582
01:26:46,323 --> 01:26:48,031
No, Olivia, Not now.

1583
01:26:48,115 --> 01:26:50,323
Try to tell me again
there's nothing going on.

1584
01:26:50,407 --> 01:26:52,031
There is nothing going on!

1585
01:26:52,115 --> 01:26:53,824
What about last night?

1586
01:26:53,907 --> 01:26:56,240
I didn't lie to you, Duke.

1587
01:26:56,323 --> 01:26:59,699
I did, but not about this.

1588
01:26:59,782 --> 01:27:02,532
Here's the truth.

1589
01:27:02,615 --> 01:27:03,865
I love you.

1590
01:27:03,949 --> 01:27:06,407
- Huh?
- I beg your pardon?

1591
01:27:06,490 --> 01:27:10,031
What? All right... What're you...?
That's just a little weird.

1592
01:27:10,115 --> 01:27:13,407
OK, you know what?
I can't do this anymore.

1593
01:27:13,490 --> 01:27:16,990
Everybody, I have
something to tell you.

1594
01:27:17,073 --> 01:27:19,865
I'm not Sebastian.

1595
01:27:19,949 --> 01:27:21,323
I'm Viola.

1596
01:27:21,407 --> 01:27:23,031
Wait. You're not Viola.

1597
01:27:23,115 --> 01:27:25,865
- Yes, I am.
- No, I know Viola.

1598
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:28,365
- I... I kissed Viola.
- You kissed me.

1599
01:27:28,448 --> 01:27:32,573
What are you talking about?
I didn't kiss you.

1600
01:27:32,657 --> 01:27:36,573
The girls' team
at Cornwall got cut.

1601
01:27:36,657 --> 01:27:39,907
The guys wouldn't let
me go out for their team.

1602
01:27:39,990 --> 01:27:43,407
So I've been pretending
to be my brother

1603
01:27:43,490 --> 01:27:47,615
while he was in London
for the past two weeks... Ow.

1604
01:27:47,699 --> 01:27:52,156
...so I could make
the team and beat Cornwall. Ow.

1605
01:27:53,949 --> 01:27:57,281
Whoa!

1606
01:27:57,365 --> 01:27:59,782
But my brother
came home early.

1607
01:27:59,865 --> 01:28:04,865
And that's who you saw kissing Olivia and that's who played the first half.

1608
01:28:04,949 --> 01:28:07,573
Just because you wear a wig
doesn't prove you're a girl.

1609
01:28:07,657 --> 01:28:11,824
OK, then.

1610
01:28:11,907 --> 01:28:14,073
Merciful Jesus.

1611
01:28:14,156 --> 01:28:15,782
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

1612
01:28:15,865 --> 01:28:17,782
- Viola?!
- Is it just me

1613
01:28:17,865 --> 01:28:20,323
or does this soccer game
have more nudity than most?

1614
01:28:20,407 --> 01:28:22,448
All right,
so everybody understand?

1615
01:28:22,532 --> 01:28:24,573
- Yeah. I get it.
- OK.

1616
01:28:24,657 --> 01:28:27,657
Wait a minute. If I kissed
your brother, where is he?

1617
01:28:27,740 --> 01:28:31,156
Probably halfway to China.
He showed his willis and doodleberries...

1618
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:33,073
- Present.
- Oh. Hi.

1619
01:28:33,156 --> 01:28:35,115
What the...?

1620
01:28:35,198 --> 01:28:37,448
OK, this is freaking me out.

1621
01:28:39,573 --> 01:28:43,573
Ladies and gentlemen,
I hate to say "I told you so," but I just... Ow.

1622
01:28:43,657 --> 01:28:47,615
See, Duke?
I didn't betray you.

1623
01:28:47,699 --> 01:28:48,990
I'm sorry.

1624
01:28:49,073 --> 01:28:51,490
This isn't how
I wanted it to happen,

1625
01:28:51,573 --> 01:28:53,990
and I didn't
want to hurt you.

1626
01:28:54,073 --> 01:28:57,615
But I just wanted to
prove that I was good enough.

1627
01:28:57,699 --> 01:28:59,990
All I'm asking for
is a chance.

1628
01:29:03,865 --> 01:29:06,073
Duke?

1629
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:14,240
It's just like what coach says
before every game:

1630
01:29:15,782 --> 01:29:19,532
"Be not afraid of greatness.

1631
01:29:19,615 --> 01:29:23,031
Some are born great.
Some achieve greatness.

1632
01:29:23,115 --> 01:29:28,156
And some have greatness
thrust upon them."

1633
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:32,240
I think the best chance for us to be great here today is to have you play.

1634
01:29:32,323 --> 01:29:34,865
- Yeah!
- All right!

1635
01:29:34,949 --> 01:29:38,699
Yeah! Yeah! No!

1636
01:29:38,782 --> 01:29:40,198
No playing!

1637
01:29:40,281 --> 01:29:42,156
You have to forfeit.

1638
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:44,907
There's no girls in this league.
Here. Look in the manual.

1639
01:29:46,949 --> 01:29:48,198
What manual?

1640
01:29:48,281 --> 01:29:51,323
Listen, pal.
You're in Illyria.

1641
01:29:51,407 --> 01:29:56,198
We don't discriminate
based on gender.

1642
01:29:56,281 --> 01:29:58,240
All right.

1643
01:29:58,323 --> 01:30:00,365
That's gonna bruise.

1644
01:30:00,448 --> 01:30:03,907
Fine. You really
think you can beat us

1645
01:30:03,990 --> 01:30:05,907
with a girl on your team?

1646
01:30:05,990 --> 01:30:08,365
This should be fun.

1647
01:30:08,448 --> 01:30:09,865
Go.

1648
01:30:09,949 --> 01:30:12,782
I get to say the last word,
not you. Go.

1649
01:30:15,031 --> 01:30:16,532
OK, team...

1650
01:30:16,615 --> 01:30:20,198
- ...let's go kick! Kill!
- Yeah!

1651
01:30:20,281 --> 01:30:22,031
Come on! Come on!

1652
01:30:22,115 --> 01:30:24,740
Well, folks,
this is a real nail-biter.

1653
01:30:24,824 --> 01:30:28,323
It's a tie score at the bottom of the second half.

1654
01:30:58,699 --> 01:31:00,949
,, Come on,
come on! Open up!

1655
01:31:15,532 --> 01:31:17,907
What?

1656
01:31:17,990 --> 01:31:22,156
Foul? That's not a foul!
He got all ball!

1657
01:31:27,865 --> 01:31:30,407
And the penalty kick
will decide the game.

1658
01:31:38,907 --> 01:31:40,532
Where you gonna kick it?
Right here?

1659
01:31:40,615 --> 01:31:42,490
I know you're
gonna kick it there.

1660
01:31:42,573 --> 01:31:44,782
Am I in your head?
Am I in your head?

1661
01:31:44,865 --> 01:31:48,156
You see the goal?
It's getting smaller and I'm getting bigger.

1662
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:49,699
Come on.

1663
01:31:49,782 --> 01:31:51,323
I love you.

1664
01:31:51,407 --> 01:31:53,990
Concentrate.
Don't kick like a girl.

1665
01:31:54,073 --> 01:31:56,615
Guys are better.
It's not gonna happen.

1666
01:31:56,699 --> 01:31:59,281
You're a loser!
This is my house!

1667
01:31:59,365 --> 01:32:01,365
You're pathetic!
I'm in your head.

1668
01:32:14,699 --> 01:32:18,365
Yeah!

1669
01:32:18,448 --> 01:32:22,949
- That's my girl!
- Mine too!

1670
01:32:32,949 --> 01:32:35,907
It's not fair!
It's not fair!

1671
01:32:35,990 --> 01:32:37,657
That was a lucky shot!

1672
01:32:37,740 --> 01:32:40,198
I never wanna see you again!

1673
01:32:40,281 --> 01:32:43,949
You suck!

1674
01:32:48,949 --> 01:32:51,699
- You did it, Vi!
- You were so awesome!

1675
01:32:51,782 --> 01:32:54,532
- I am so proud of you.
- It's over.

1676
01:32:54,615 --> 01:32:56,990
You just scored the game-winning goal.
Say something.

1677
01:32:57,073 --> 01:32:59,865
Mom? Dad?

1678
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:04,573
- That was really something.
- Thanks, Dad.

1679
01:33:04,657 --> 01:33:06,740
You did all this to play soccer?

1680
01:33:06,824 --> 01:33:08,240
I told you,
it's important to me.

1681
01:33:08,323 --> 01:33:11,907
If Viola was here
pretending to be you,

1682
01:33:11,990 --> 01:33:14,115
- where were you?
- Oh, he was, um...

1683
01:33:14,198 --> 01:33:16,115
I was in London
playing my music.

1684
01:33:16,198 --> 01:33:18,240
- London?
- It was important to me.

1685
01:33:21,824 --> 01:33:24,115
Mom, Dad... Hey!

1686
01:33:24,198 --> 01:33:28,365
Why don't we go to dinner?
As a family?

1687
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:31,532
- Maybe tomorrow?
- I suppose I could fit that in.

1688
01:33:31,615 --> 01:33:34,031
Would you like to have
my cell phone number?

1689
01:33:34,115 --> 01:33:36,407
- Let me give you my email.
- All right.

1690
01:33:36,490 --> 01:33:37,782
Yay!

1691
01:33:37,865 --> 01:33:39,782
- Good job.
- Thank you.

1692
01:33:39,865 --> 01:33:42,990
Oh, wait!
There is somebody I want you to officially meet.

1693
01:33:43,073 --> 01:33:48,615
Sebastian Hastings,
Olivia Lennox.

1694
01:33:48,699 --> 01:33:51,073
- It's very nice to meet you.
- You too.

1695
01:33:51,156 --> 01:33:54,699
So, uh, I heard
you like my lyrics.

1696
01:33:56,865 --> 01:34:00,865
- Eunice?
- Toby?

1697
01:34:03,532 --> 01:34:06,115
I have something to say.

1698
01:34:06,198 --> 01:34:08,782
I think you are...

1699
01:34:08,865 --> 01:34:11,573
...amazing.

1700
01:34:12,657 --> 01:34:15,073
And I'm not ashamed of it.

1701
01:34:18,365 --> 01:34:20,657
I know tricks.

1702
01:34:20,740 --> 01:34:23,031

1715
01:35:34,990 --> 01:35:38,740
- He still could show, you know.
- You didn't see his face.

1716
01:35:38,824 --> 01:35:41,073
I found the perfect dress.

1717
01:35:41,156 --> 01:35:42,990
Aw, thanks, Mom,

1718
01:35:43,073 --> 01:35:45,073
but I don't think I'm gonna
get a chance to wear it.

1719
01:35:45,156 --> 01:35:46,782
Nonsense.

1720
01:35:46,865 --> 01:35:51,407
You don't need a man
to wear a beautiful dress.

1721
01:35:51,490 --> 01:35:53,532
But it doesn't hurt.

1722
01:35:53,615 --> 01:35:55,407
Viola Hastings,

1723
01:35:55,490 --> 01:35:58,073
it would be my honor
to escort you tonight.

1724
01:35:58,156 --> 01:36:00,073
Thanks, Paul.
That's really sweet.

1725
01:36:00,156 --> 01:36:02,573
Caterpillars! Caterpillars!
My precious caterpillars.

1726
01:36:02,657 --> 01:36:05,907
In 20 minutes you'll all
be beautiful butterflies.

1727
01:36:05,990 --> 01:36:09,115
Caterpillars!
Butterflies!

1728
01:36:09,198 --> 01:36:13,156
You look beautiful.
I just... I gotta get some air.

1729
01:36:44,990 --> 01:36:48,615
I didn't think you'd show up.

1730
01:36:48,699 --> 01:36:52,532
It really means a lot to me
that you're here.

1731
01:36:53,365 --> 01:36:54,657
Say something.

1732
01:36:54,740 --> 01:36:57,865
I gotta turn
the sprinklers on.

1733
01:36:58,990 --> 01:37:01,073
Sorry.

1734
01:37:08,865 --> 01:37:10,532
Hi.

1735
01:37:10,615 --> 01:37:11,990
Hi.

1736
01:37:12,073 --> 01:37:15,281
So, what brings you here?

1737
01:37:16,365 --> 01:37:19,323
Well, a few days ago,

1738
01:37:19,407 --> 01:37:23,532
I kissed this girl
at a kissing booth.

1739
01:37:23,615 --> 01:37:29,365
And now I just can't seem
to stop thinking about it.

1740
01:37:29,448 --> 01:37:31,323
Neither can she.

1741
01:37:31,407 --> 01:37:33,824
Plus,

1742
01:37:33,907 --> 01:37:35,824
I miss my roommate.

1743
01:37:35,907 --> 01:37:39,323
I really liked him.

1744
01:37:39,407 --> 01:37:41,824
Well...

1745
01:37:41,907 --> 01:37:44,699
...he's right in here.

1746
01:37:44,782 --> 01:37:50,198
Listen, I know I should've
told you who I was but...

1747
01:37:50,281 --> 01:37:51,782
...I was afraid.

1748
01:37:53,907 --> 01:37:57,156
- Sorry.
- Well,

1749
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:59,699
you know, maybe if I'd have
known you were a girl,

1750
01:37:59,782 --> 01:38:02,156
we wouldn't have talked
like we did

1751
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:05,490
and got to know each other
the same way.

1752
01:38:05,573 --> 01:38:09,532
And that would
have been a shame.

1753
01:38:09,615 --> 01:38:12,073
Just so you know,

1754
01:38:12,156 --> 01:38:16,657
everything you told me
when I was a guy just...

1755
01:38:16,740 --> 01:38:20,657
...made me like you
so much more as a girl.

1756
01:38:20,740 --> 01:38:23,532
OK, but just
from here on in,

1757
01:38:23,615 --> 01:38:26,657
everything would just
be a lot easier

1758
01:38:26,740 --> 01:38:30,198
if you stayed a girl.

1759
01:38:30,281 --> 01:38:32,365
I promise.

1760
01:38:32,448 --> 01:38:37,782

escorted by Justin Drayton.

1761
01:38:46,782 --> 01:38:48,448
