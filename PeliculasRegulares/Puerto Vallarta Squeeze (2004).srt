1
00:03:49,618 --> 00:03:52,997
What do you have out here
that you don't have inside?

2
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:56,334
The moon...
and a few billion stars.

3
00:03:56,358 --> 00:03:57,401
Hmm.

4
00:03:57,425 --> 00:04:00,238
I don't think I can
compete with that...

5
00:04:00,262 --> 00:04:01,735
but I can try.

6
00:04:04,499 --> 00:04:06,611
Go back to bed.
I'll be in soon.

7
00:04:06,635 --> 00:04:09,447
Mivida...
don't worry.

8
00:04:09,471 --> 00:04:11,849
That's my job
when I'm not writing.

9
00:04:11,873 --> 00:04:13,551
Why?

10
00:04:13,575 --> 00:04:15,786
The check might
be here tomorrow...

11
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,656
and you will have
wasted tonight.

12
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,258
The sun will rise...

13
00:04:20,282 --> 00:04:23,261
and bring all good things
with it.

14
00:04:23,285 --> 00:04:24,528
Hmm?

15
00:04:24,552 --> 00:04:27,131
Mm-hmm?

16
00:04:27,155 --> 00:04:28,899
So there's one already.

17
00:04:28,923 --> 00:04:30,971
- Ha ha ha!
- Come on.

18
00:04:51,413 --> 00:04:53,357
Come on, honey.

19
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:54,725
Let's dance, honey.

20
00:04:54,749 --> 00:04:56,527
No, honey! Mihelado!

21
00:04:56,551 --> 00:04:58,629
Pick your passion--
me or the ice cream.

22
00:04:58,653 --> 00:05:01,165
Oh! No. No, no!

23
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:02,957
No!

24
00:05:16,438 --> 00:05:18,082
Come on.
Let's go get a drink.

25
00:05:18,106 --> 00:05:19,283
No, it's too early.

26
00:05:19,307 --> 00:05:21,218
Come on, honey.
You already had your treat.

27
00:05:21,242 --> 00:05:29,193
No.

28
00:05:29,217 --> 00:05:30,528
Hey, Jack.

29
00:05:30,552 --> 00:05:32,029
How's it going, buddy?

30
00:05:32,053 --> 00:05:33,654
- Good.
- Good man.

31
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,234
- Two, Bill.
- One.

32
00:05:37,258 --> 00:05:38,336
OK.

33
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,505
- The good stuff?
- Uh, no, not today. No.

34
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:44,775
Long time between
royalty checks, huh?

35
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:47,676
Well, you know what they say--
it's a feast or famine business.

36
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,615
Yeah. More like
famine-famine lately.

37
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:53,918
Ah, don't worry.

38
00:05:53,942 --> 00:05:56,053
Your credit's good...

39
00:05:56,077 --> 00:05:58,723
as long as you got Luz with you.

40
00:05:58,747 --> 00:06:01,392
Heh.

41
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,794
Cómo estás, papita.

42
00:06:03,818 --> 00:06:05,596
Fine, thank you.

43
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,764
And yourself?

44
00:06:06,788 --> 00:06:09,967
Oh, real good right now.
Real good.

45
00:06:09,991 --> 00:06:13,237
How's the wife, Bill?

46
00:06:13,261 --> 00:06:15,506
Too smart to walk
into a dive like this...

47
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,541
with a bunch of losers.

48
00:06:17,565 --> 00:06:20,111
I’m sure she gets
enough of that at home.

49
00:06:20,135 --> 00:06:22,413
Keep the change, Bill.
Come on.

50
00:06:22,437 --> 00:06:25,798
What'd you do,
hock your car? Huh?

51
00:06:26,508 --> 00:06:30,298
Hey, it'll take more than this
to buy you some pride big-time.

52
00:06:30,512 --> 00:06:32,623
- What is your problem?
- Danny, no.

53
00:06:32,647 --> 00:06:33,991
You pathetic lackey!

54
00:06:34,015 --> 00:06:36,827
Oh, yeah, yeah. You just keep
talkin' to the mirror, man.

55
00:06:36,851 --> 00:06:40,064
You know, one more month
without a check, and you are me.

56
00:06:40,088 --> 00:06:41,432
Come on, let's go.

57
00:06:41,456 --> 00:06:44,735
Hey, we got an apron in the back
with your name on it...

58
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,734
just waitin' for you,
Danny boy!

59
00:06:50,732 --> 00:06:53,811
Do you believe that?
What a stupid son of a bitch.

60
00:06:53,835 --> 00:06:56,046
No! You're the stupid
son of a bitch...

61
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,948
for arguing with
a stupid son of a bitch!

62
00:06:57,972 --> 00:06:59,550
Hey, all I wanted was a drink.

63
00:06:59,574 --> 00:07:02,219
You had a hundred bars
to choose from!

64
00:07:02,243 --> 00:07:03,921
You went up there
to punish yourself--

65
00:07:03,945 --> 00:07:06,023
and me, too, maybe.

66
00:07:06,047 --> 00:07:07,922
I don't need this.

67
00:07:17,592 --> 00:07:20,392
What's the matter?
Did you lose something?

68
00:07:30,972 --> 00:07:32,530
Get--

69
00:07:39,013 --> 00:07:41,959
Aah!

70
00:07:41,983 --> 00:07:43,127
Luz!

71
00:07:43,151 --> 00:07:48,199
Luz!

72
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,367
What happened? Oh, my God!

73
00:07:50,391 --> 00:07:52,503
Luz, are you OK?

74
00:07:52,527 --> 00:07:54,510
Oh, my God.
You're--blood!

75
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,850
Are you all right?

76
00:08:06,908 --> 00:08:09,773
Honey...we've got to
get out of here.

77
00:08:20,822 --> 00:08:22,566
It's all right now.

78
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,101
Honey? It's all right.

79
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,329
It's all right.
Sweetheart...

80
00:08:30,365 --> 00:08:33,878
His face, Danny.

81
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,716
I thought he was...

82
00:08:38,673 --> 00:08:40,217
grabbing at me. I--

83
00:08:42,343 --> 00:08:44,466
So I...

84
00:08:45,713 --> 00:08:47,691
turned to him, you know?

85
00:08:47,715 --> 00:08:49,268
Angry.

86
00:08:50,418 --> 00:08:53,028
And the last face...

87
00:08:54,222 --> 00:08:56,573
he saw before
he left the world...

88
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,323
was angry.

89
00:08:59,627 --> 00:09:02,940
Luz, he was probably
already gone, honey.

90
00:09:02,964 --> 00:09:04,208
No.

91
00:09:04,832 --> 00:09:07,082
Sweetie. Luz.

92
00:09:07,435 --> 00:09:09,380
Luz...

93
00:09:09,404 --> 00:09:12,209
maybe you'd like to go rest
before we go home.

94
00:09:12,407 --> 00:09:14,000
Let's go inside.

95
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,262
I pray for his soul.

96
00:09:45,206 --> 00:09:47,246
It's all right.

97
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,328
Oh. Oh.

98
00:09:57,352 --> 00:09:59,046
- You OK?
- Yeah.

99
00:10:07,161 --> 00:10:08,610
Come on.

100
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,086
E-e-excuse me.

101
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,088
Look...I don’t want
to bother you guys...

102
00:10:24,112 --> 00:10:25,322
but maybe you can help me out.

103
00:10:25,346 --> 00:10:26,390
What is it?

104
00:10:26,414 --> 00:10:28,559
I’m looking for a ride
to the border.

105
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,894
Why don’t you just fly?

106
00:10:30,918 --> 00:10:33,163
Well, I'm a little squeamish
about flying.

107
00:10:33,187 --> 00:10:35,633
Mexican roads aren't any safer.

108
00:10:35,657 --> 00:10:37,201
How'd you get here?

109
00:10:37,225 --> 00:10:40,204
Uh, a yacht, but I wanted
to spend a little time...

110
00:10:40,228 --> 00:10:41,705
and my friends had to get back.

111
00:10:41,729 --> 00:10:43,140
Why the rush now?

112
00:10:43,164 --> 00:10:46,543
I just found out
I have a meeting in Dallas.

113
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:48,612
Oh, well...bummer.

114
00:10:48,636 --> 00:10:51,682
Tell me about it.
You know anybody with a car?

115
00:10:51,706 --> 00:10:53,617
I’ll pay good money.

116
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:55,252
I might. How much?

117
00:10:55,276 --> 00:10:58,355
I don't know. Uh...

118
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:00,424
2, 3,000?

119
00:11:00,448 --> 00:11:02,026
- Oh, I have a c--
- Shh.

120
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,395
Uh, I have a car,
but I'm pretty busy right now.

121
00:11:04,419 --> 00:11:05,896
Time is precious.

122
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,732
How about 4,000? Free some up.

123
00:11:08,756 --> 00:11:11,068
I might be able
to put some work aside, yeah.

124
00:11:11,092 --> 00:11:12,336
Honey, no.

125
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,438
There are asaltantes
on the roads.

126
00:11:14,462 --> 00:11:16,840
Bandits. Uh...
there is that danger.

127
00:11:16,864 --> 00:11:19,109
15 up north,
east in the mountains.

128
00:11:19,133 --> 00:11:22,179
OK, how about I throw in
another grand--hazard pay?

129
00:11:22,203 --> 00:11:24,114
Honey, how much is
your life worth?

130
00:11:24,138 --> 00:11:26,216
5,000, plus expenses?

131
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,885
2,500 in advance?

132
00:11:27,909 --> 00:11:30,220
Yeah, deal...
if we leave tonight.

133
00:11:30,244 --> 00:11:33,924
Well...deal.

134
00:11:33,948 --> 00:11:36,093
We live just a few blocks away.

135
00:11:36,117 --> 00:11:38,195
She looks like
she's clocked more miles...

136
00:11:38,219 --> 00:11:40,297
than a midtown hooker.
Think she'll make it?

137
00:11:40,321 --> 00:11:42,366
Sure, she will.
But just in case...

138
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,302
I have some new plugs
and a spare fan belt in back.

139
00:11:45,326 --> 00:11:47,171
What about a spare transmission?

140
00:11:47,195 --> 00:11:49,707
Uhh. Appearances
can be deceiving.

141
00:11:49,731 --> 00:11:54,745
Yeah, I heard that once.

142
00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:56,814
How long before we leave?

143
00:11:56,838 --> 00:11:58,919
As soon as I throw
some things together.

144
00:12:05,213 --> 00:12:09,059
See? She still puts out.

145
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,428
Danny, mivida.

146
00:12:11,452 --> 00:12:12,563
Huh?

147
00:12:12,587 --> 00:12:14,364
Could I talk to you
for a minute?

148
00:12:14,388 --> 00:12:15,999
Sure, honey.

149
00:12:16,023 --> 00:12:18,235
"Mivida" isn't a good sign.

150
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:20,103
Coming, honey!

151
00:12:32,607 --> 00:12:34,718
You are not driving
that man to the border.

152
00:12:34,742 --> 00:12:36,653
For $5,000, I'll carry him.

153
00:12:36,677 --> 00:12:38,789
You don't know
anything about him!

154
00:12:38,813 --> 00:12:40,524
You don't even like him.

155
00:12:40,548 --> 00:12:43,093
Let’s just say
he bought my affection.

156
00:12:43,117 --> 00:12:45,829
If you go with him...

157
00:12:45,853 --> 00:12:48,198
I won't be here
when you get back.

158
00:12:48,222 --> 00:12:50,300
If I don't go with him,
we'll be thrown out of here...

159
00:12:50,324 --> 00:12:51,749
and you'll leave me anyway.

160
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,542
Luz, I got to do something.

161
00:12:58,566 --> 00:12:59,943
So write.

162
00:12:59,967 --> 00:13:02,212
You're a writer,
not a chauffeur.

163
00:13:02,236 --> 00:13:04,782
OK. I'll write a book tonight.

164
00:13:04,806 --> 00:13:06,617
I’ll get it published tomorrow.

165
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:08,385
We should have a royalty check
by next week.

166
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:12,055
Life is not like one of
your telenovelas, Luz.

167
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,658
Be practical.

168
00:13:14,682 --> 00:13:17,161
You think it's practical...

169
00:13:17,185 --> 00:13:18,896
to drive a complete stranger
to the border...

170
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,164
in the middle of the night?

171
00:13:20,188 --> 00:13:22,099
This is an opportunity
for us, Luz.

172
00:13:22,123 --> 00:13:23,867
It's a blessing, honey.

173
00:13:23,891 --> 00:13:26,436
No. It's some terrible test.

174
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,906
- Oh...
- On a day of bad omens.

175
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:32,442
I don't have time for
ignorant village hocus-pocus.

176
00:13:32,466 --> 00:13:35,846
OK? Besides,
it'll be an adventure...

177
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,581
give me something
to write about.

178
00:13:37,605 --> 00:13:40,017
Oh, spare me the bullshit, OK?

179
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:41,752
You've got a typewriter!

180
00:13:41,776 --> 00:13:43,474
That's all you need to write!

181
00:13:48,282 --> 00:13:49,760
Oh, ha ha.

182
00:13:49,784 --> 00:13:52,362
Whew! How much of that
did you hear?

183
00:13:52,386 --> 00:13:55,632
I missed the part about
how you don't even like me.

184
00:13:55,656 --> 00:13:59,236
Ha ha!
She’s just a little upset.

185
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,878
Apparently, you'll be missed.

186
00:14:03,631 --> 00:14:05,409
But not for long.

187
00:14:05,433 --> 00:14:07,544
- You are not going with us.
- Watch me.

188
00:14:07,568 --> 00:14:09,012
Luz, get back in the house.

189
00:14:09,036 --> 00:14:11,148
My father talked
to my mother that way...

190
00:14:11,172 --> 00:14:12,883
but he was
an ignorant villager.

191
00:14:12,907 --> 00:14:15,819
-It's OK with me if she comes.
-It's not OK with me.

192
00:14:15,843 --> 00:14:17,921
Ah, come on. She handles food
and translation.

193
00:14:17,945 --> 00:14:21,692
You drive, I ride shotgun,
eyes peeled for bandidos.

194
00:14:21,716 --> 00:14:24,061
Exactly. It's too dangerous.

195
00:14:24,085 --> 00:14:26,964
No. It will be an event
to remember.

196
00:14:26,988 --> 00:14:29,600
- Luz, I'm serious.
- No!

197
00:14:29,624 --> 00:14:31,616
It's getting late, guys.

198
00:14:56,884 --> 00:14:58,896
The siren's still going.

199
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,165
Yeah. We don't usually have
two people slaughtered...

200
00:15:02,189 --> 00:15:04,968
on the main drag
in broad daylight.

201
00:15:04,992 --> 00:15:06,970
Two white people.

202
00:15:06,994 --> 00:15:08,906
Oh, yeah. That, too.

203
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,974
Think it'll be hard
getting out of town?

204
00:15:10,998 --> 00:15:14,031
Well, there may be a roadblock,
checking people's papers.

205
00:15:15,069 --> 00:15:16,480
Can we avoid that?

206
00:15:16,504 --> 00:15:18,682
Way ahead of you.

207
00:15:18,706 --> 00:15:20,651
Aiming for a back street.

208
00:15:20,675 --> 00:15:22,352
Oh.

209
00:15:22,376 --> 00:15:25,656
Your up-front money, plus, uh...

210
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,294
100 for supplies.

211
00:15:31,852 --> 00:15:33,292
Hide that, honeybunch.

212
00:15:38,392 --> 00:15:40,404
Now, there's nothing
in that bag...

213
00:15:40,428 --> 00:15:42,439
that I don’t want in my car,
is there?

214
00:15:42,463 --> 00:15:45,315
Well... there is this.

215
00:15:55,209 --> 00:15:57,654
Is it OK to take these
out of the country?

216
00:15:57,678 --> 00:15:59,073
Yeah.

217
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:13,208
McGrane.

218
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,719
When?

219
00:16:23,871 --> 00:16:27,719
Do you have a positive I.D.
on the navy brass?

220
00:16:29,243 --> 00:16:31,154
Reese?

221
00:16:31,178 --> 00:16:34,858
Ohh, man.

222
00:16:34,882 --> 00:16:38,695
That sick bastard.

223
00:16:38,719 --> 00:16:42,866
He really did it.

224
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,267
Ohh.

225
00:16:47,795 --> 00:16:49,495
I’ll be there.

226
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,025
Leave everything. I'll watch it.

227
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:10,527
I said, I'll watch it.

228
00:17:10,551 --> 00:17:12,462
Yeah, I heard you. Thanks.

229
00:17:12,486 --> 00:17:14,598
Honey, it’s just a few days.

230
00:17:14,622 --> 00:17:16,905
Let's get through it, OK?

231
00:17:22,963 --> 00:17:25,909
- ¿Qué pasa, Victor?
- ¿Wué pasa, Danny?

232
00:17:27,201 --> 00:17:29,046
They've been going all night.

233
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:31,148
What is it?

234
00:17:31,172 --> 00:17:33,548
An assassination.
That's what I heard.

235
00:17:33,941 --> 00:17:34,985
Really?

236
00:17:35,009 --> 00:17:37,320
Isn’t that right,
Sargento Reyes?

237
00:17:37,344 --> 00:17:39,689
That's what I was told.

238
00:17:39,713 --> 00:17:41,525
Two Americans.

239
00:17:41,549 --> 00:17:43,293
One navy officer...

240
00:17:43,317 --> 00:17:45,429
and a turista
that got in the way.

241
00:17:45,453 --> 00:17:47,998
Two Americans, eh?

242
00:17:48,022 --> 00:17:50,500
You better watch out.

243
00:17:50,524 --> 00:17:52,139
Right.

244
00:17:56,797 --> 00:17:58,341
Any suspects?

245
00:17:58,365 --> 00:18:01,311
We are looking
for anyone suspicious--

246
00:18:01,335 --> 00:18:02,846
like you, maybe.

247
00:18:04,872 --> 00:18:06,416
Are you suspicious?

248
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,784
No.

249
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:13,657
Listen, Victor,
if I arrest them...

250
00:18:13,681 --> 00:18:15,792
I'll get a promotion.

251
00:18:15,816 --> 00:18:18,128
And you'll get a reward.

252
00:18:20,888 --> 00:18:22,699
Buenas noches.

253
00:18:22,723 --> 00:18:26,136
Buenas noches.

254
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,571
Cabrón.

255
00:18:28,462 --> 00:18:29,973
You going somewhere?

256
00:18:29,997 --> 00:18:31,810
No, just hungry.

257
00:18:48,048 --> 00:18:50,360
Where did you say we’re headed?

258
00:18:50,384 --> 00:18:51,962
Which border town, I mean?

259
00:18:51,986 --> 00:18:53,631
I haven't decided yet.

260
00:18:53,955 --> 00:18:55,116
Got a map?

261
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:56,467
Side of the door.

262
00:19:03,364 --> 00:19:05,108
So, um...

263
00:19:05,132 --> 00:19:07,444
what kind of business
do you have in Dallas?

264
00:19:07,468 --> 00:19:09,051
Ah, a little freelance work.

265
00:19:12,006 --> 00:19:14,484
I wasn't, uh,
asking for your resume.

266
00:19:14,508 --> 00:19:17,896
You know...
just making conversation.

267
00:19:20,047 --> 00:19:22,362
Everybody hold on!

268
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,735
Sorry about that.
You OK, honey?

269
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:35,305
I forgot where I was
for a minute.

270
00:19:35,329 --> 00:19:37,707
Now I remember.

271
00:19:37,731 --> 00:19:40,043
The roads can get
a little bumpy.

272
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:41,378
Ah, I'm used to it.

273
00:19:41,402 --> 00:19:43,680
You travel a lot
in your line of work?

274
00:19:43,704 --> 00:19:45,515
Yeah, enough.

275
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:47,617
What brought you
to Puerto Vallarta?

276
00:19:47,641 --> 00:19:49,386
- Running from the cops?
- No.

277
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,054
- I.R.S.?
- No.

278
00:19:51,078 --> 00:19:52,122
Ex-wife.

279
00:19:52,146 --> 00:19:54,891
Ha ha ha!
No, nothing that specific.

280
00:19:54,915 --> 00:19:58,228
I’m a writer, so I'm running
from life in general.

281
00:19:58,252 --> 00:19:59,362
Ha ha ha ha!

282
00:19:59,386 --> 00:20:01,598
Danny has written five books.

283
00:20:01,622 --> 00:20:04,990
The last one--
Chicago Crime Syndicate--

284
00:20:05,593 --> 00:20:07,938
won the National
Book Club Award.

285
00:20:07,962 --> 00:20:09,673
Thank you, honey.

286
00:20:09,697 --> 00:20:11,408
She's my press agent. Yeah.

287
00:20:11,432 --> 00:20:12,742
That's impressive.

288
00:20:12,766 --> 00:20:15,145
On paper, maybe. But it's...

289
00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:16,813
it doesn't always pay the rent.

290
00:20:16,837 --> 00:20:19,049
Chicago Crime Syndicate.

291
00:20:19,073 --> 00:20:20,884
Mm-hmm. Ha ha!

292
00:20:20,908 --> 00:20:22,719
You meet any mobsters?

293
00:20:22,743 --> 00:20:25,655
Yeah. Several.

294
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,458
Wow. Sounds dangerous.

295
00:20:28,482 --> 00:20:31,097
Well, it can be.

296
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,165
You know, in about an hour,
I'm gonna need to know...

297
00:20:35,189 --> 00:20:37,334
which border town
you want me to head for.

298
00:20:37,358 --> 00:20:39,402
I haven't decided yet.

299
00:20:39,426 --> 00:20:41,404
I’m thinking...Sonoita.

300
00:20:41,428 --> 00:20:43,773
Sonoita? Where's that?

301
00:20:43,797 --> 00:20:45,508
Let's see, uh...

302
00:20:45,532 --> 00:20:47,677
Route 15 to Santa Ana...

303
00:20:47,701 --> 00:20:50,880
then west, Route 2.
It goes right there.

304
00:20:50,904 --> 00:20:52,349
South of Arizona.

305
00:20:52,373 --> 00:20:54,451
That's gonna leave you
a long ways from Dallas.

306
00:20:54,475 --> 00:20:56,253
Well, you got your money, right?

307
00:20:56,277 --> 00:20:58,121
- Yeah, but, uh--
- Thanks.

308
00:20:58,145 --> 00:21:00,126
I appreciate your concern.

309
00:21:20,701 --> 00:21:23,147
Just when everything
was going so nicely, right?

310
00:21:26,307 --> 00:21:27,831
Sir.

311
00:21:29,643 --> 00:21:31,025
Yep.

312
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:35,225
You might want to keep
your eyes open on this one.

313
00:21:35,249 --> 00:21:36,893
I beg your pardon, sir?

314
00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:39,362
Did you read the dossier
on the target?

315
00:21:39,386 --> 00:21:42,732
Clayton Price, 5'11"...

316
00:21:42,756 --> 00:21:45,535
gray-brown hair, brown eyes.

317
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:46,903
Slender build.

318
00:21:46,927 --> 00:21:49,439
OK. He just killed you...

319
00:21:49,463 --> 00:21:51,808
shot you dead
because you're so stupid.

320
00:21:51,832 --> 00:21:53,910
What have we taught you?
You're hunting a man...

321
00:21:53,934 --> 00:21:56,746
one more intelligent than you...

322
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:59,449
with all your training
and more experience.

323
00:21:59,473 --> 00:22:01,885
He's not the third duck
in the second row...

324
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:03,320
at the shooting gallery.

325
00:22:03,344 --> 00:22:05,555
In fact, he thinks you are.

326
00:22:05,579 --> 00:22:07,390
Sir, I was just--

327
00:22:07,414 --> 00:22:10,927
Tell me what he's really like...
what his guts smell like.

328
00:22:10,951 --> 00:22:13,096
That's the only way
you're gonna nail him.

329
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,132
I know he was in the Special Ops
in Vietnam, sir.

330
00:22:16,156 --> 00:22:19,803
Did 2 tours. 82 confirmed hits,
over 200 probables.

331
00:22:19,827 --> 00:22:21,738
He was the Babe Ruth of wetwork.

332
00:22:21,762 --> 00:22:23,073
What else?

333
00:22:23,097 --> 00:22:25,809
He started working
for Covert Operations.

334
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:29,045
They used him successfully
until five years ago...

335
00:22:29,069 --> 00:22:31,014
when he began
to question instructions.

336
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:36,421
Right. He objected to a hit
in Asia on political grounds.

337
00:22:36,677 --> 00:22:38,054
What else?

338
00:22:38,078 --> 00:22:39,889
He ended up turning rogue...

339
00:22:39,913 --> 00:22:43,293
killing navy brass
in Puerto Vallarta...

340
00:22:43,317 --> 00:22:45,261
and briefing wouldn't
tell me why...

341
00:22:45,285 --> 00:22:46,696
or who he was working for, sir.

342
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,098
Right. That's irrelevant to you.

343
00:22:48,122 --> 00:22:49,132
Yes, sir.

344
00:22:49,156 --> 00:22:50,767
He's a man
with dangerous talents...

345
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:53,036
and an unstable mind,
and he's roaming free.

346
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,605
Let intelligence
handle the subtleties.

347
00:22:55,629 --> 00:22:57,440
Your job is to kill him.

348
00:22:57,464 --> 00:22:59,289
Yes, sir.

349
00:23:01,635 --> 00:23:02,959
Here.

350
00:23:05,606 --> 00:23:07,250
Do some more homework.

351
00:23:07,274 --> 00:23:10,770
What you learn
might save your life.

352
00:23:12,346 --> 00:23:15,220
That's all
I'm trying to do, son.

353
00:24:14,575 --> 00:24:16,719
Jeez! Look out!

354
00:24:16,743 --> 00:24:18,121
- Danny!
- Oh, my God!

355
00:24:18,145 --> 00:24:21,558
Hold on to something, Luz!

356
00:24:21,582 --> 00:24:23,960
Oh, man! I can't control it!

357
00:24:23,984 --> 00:24:25,586
Danny! Do something!

358
00:24:26,987 --> 00:24:28,231
Danny!

359
00:24:28,255 --> 00:24:31,401
No!

360
00:24:31,425 --> 00:24:33,336
Let go of the wheel!
I'm steering this thing!

361
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,863
I thought gravity was!

362
00:24:44,872 --> 00:24:46,683
Man, now, that's a detour.

363
00:24:46,707 --> 00:24:48,585
You crazy bastard.
You could've killed us.

364
00:24:48,609 --> 00:24:50,553
No, plowing into a wall of cows
would've killed us.

365
00:24:50,577 --> 00:24:51,988
Wall of cows?

366
00:24:52,012 --> 00:24:53,356
Yeah, exactly.
I swerved just in time.

367
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,658
- Yeah, off a cliff.
- I told you, the roads are bad!

368
00:24:55,682 --> 00:24:57,427
Bad? Not as bad as your driving!

369
00:24:57,451 --> 00:24:59,929
Both of you, shut up!

370
00:24:59,953 --> 00:25:03,160
And try to figure out
where in carajo we are!

371
00:25:08,896 --> 00:25:11,007
Guess we're on the road
to San Blas.

372
00:25:11,031 --> 00:25:13,128
Looks like it.

373
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:52,015
I’m Colonel Benjamin Rivera...

374
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:54,484
military intelligence,
Mexico city.

375
00:25:54,508 --> 00:25:56,519
Walter McGrane.
This is Neil Weatherford.

376
00:25:56,543 --> 00:26:00,170
Welcome to Puerto Vallarta.
This will be your vehicle.

377
00:26:00,981 --> 00:26:02,859
You're my assigned liaison?

378
00:26:02,883 --> 00:26:05,094
Yes, sir.
My men and I were briefed...

379
00:26:05,118 --> 00:26:06,496
when we arrived last night...

380
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,264
but, of course,
I would appreciate...

381
00:26:08,288 --> 00:26:10,466
any further information
you could provide us.

382
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:13,636
All information will be
distributed by headquarters...

383
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,505
on an as-needed basis.

384
00:26:15,529 --> 00:26:17,240
We need to know more
about this man.

385
00:26:17,264 --> 00:26:20,176
No, we need to know.
You just need to help us.

386
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,406
Now, if you don't mind,
I want to see where it happened.

387
00:27:07,914 --> 00:27:09,425
How long you want to stay?

388
00:27:09,449 --> 00:27:11,227
I don't know. A couple hours.

389
00:27:11,251 --> 00:27:13,529
Long enough to clean up,
get some shuteye, food.

390
00:27:13,553 --> 00:27:15,632
- OK with you?
- Sure.

391
00:27:15,656 --> 00:27:18,635
What about you, Luz?
Enough time to rest?

392
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:20,703
Yes, thank you.

393
00:27:20,727 --> 00:27:22,739
You might want to have
your tourist card ready...

394
00:27:22,763 --> 00:27:23,906
just in case.

395
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:26,843
I don't have one.

396
00:27:26,867 --> 00:27:29,078
Didn’t your boat
go through immigration?

397
00:27:29,102 --> 00:27:30,480
Yeah, but I was below deck...

398
00:27:30,504 --> 00:27:32,649
and I didn’t figure I'd need one
for just two or three days.

399
00:27:32,673 --> 00:27:35,251
Well, how the hell do you expect
to get across the border?

400
00:27:35,275 --> 00:27:38,054
Especially in some little
fleabag town like Sonata...

401
00:27:38,078 --> 00:27:39,389
or whatever you call it.

402
00:27:39,413 --> 00:27:42,158
I don't know. If the border
official is even awake...

403
00:27:42,182 --> 00:27:43,526
I'll just bribe him.

404
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:46,029
You can't buy everyone
in Mexico, you know.

405
00:27:46,053 --> 00:27:48,097
It's working so far.

406
00:27:48,121 --> 00:27:50,099
Ha ha! Well,
what if the cop stops you?

407
00:27:50,123 --> 00:27:51,634
Jesus. One night together...

408
00:27:51,658 --> 00:27:53,336
and you're already
my goddamn wife.

409
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,871
Let me worry about it, will you?

410
00:27:54,895 --> 00:27:56,973
All right, you wait here.
Luz and I will check in...

411
00:27:56,997 --> 00:28:00,295
and I'll tell them that my idiot
brother is waiting in the car.

412
00:28:04,538 --> 00:28:06,983
You must be
a very patient woman, Luz.

413
00:28:07,007 --> 00:28:10,468
That's the only kind God makes.

414
00:28:17,884 --> 00:28:19,107
Luz?

415
00:28:21,358 --> 00:28:22,458
Honey?

416
00:28:44,478 --> 00:28:46,089
Shouldn’t you be sleeping?

417
00:28:46,113 --> 00:28:48,491
I slept in the car...

418
00:28:48,515 --> 00:28:50,514
between arguments.

419
00:28:57,324 --> 00:28:58,892
Want to swim?

420
00:29:00,327 --> 00:29:03,611
No. I didn't bring
my traje de baño.

421
00:29:03,964 --> 00:29:05,651
Me, either.

422
00:29:18,512 --> 00:29:20,919
What are you avoiding
looking at?

423
00:29:23,016 --> 00:29:24,420
My underwear...

424
00:29:26,253 --> 00:29:27,930
or my scars?

425
00:29:27,954 --> 00:29:31,801
Nothing.

426
00:29:31,825 --> 00:29:34,426
Car accident?

427
00:29:35,529 --> 00:29:37,173
War accident.

428
00:29:37,197 --> 00:29:39,776
But it's OK.
They're not painful...

429
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,811
just ugly.

430
00:29:41,835 --> 00:29:44,180
They are not so ugly.

431
00:29:44,204 --> 00:29:45,986
Thanks.

432
00:29:48,108 --> 00:29:49,685
Danny still sleeping?

433
00:29:49,709 --> 00:29:50,864
Up here.

434
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,191
Well, how about
hitting the road?

435
00:29:55,215 --> 00:29:57,026
How about some food first?

436
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:58,928
How about some pants...

437
00:29:58,952 --> 00:30:00,959
for both of you?

438
00:30:10,397 --> 00:30:13,216
73.

439
00:30:15,669 --> 00:30:18,806
73 feet.

440
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,185
Expert work.

441
00:30:22,209 --> 00:30:23,820
Small caliber handgun...

442
00:30:23,844 --> 00:30:26,069
target approximately
25 yards away...

443
00:30:27,948 --> 00:30:30,426
all without being able
to take a sight.

444
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:32,028
The best and the brightest.

445
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,662
What the hell
was Price thinking?

446
00:30:38,825 --> 00:30:40,703
We have an I.D.

447
00:30:40,727 --> 00:30:42,872
The owner of a bodega
on the edge of town...

448
00:30:42,896 --> 00:30:44,373
the night of the killings.

449
00:30:44,397 --> 00:30:46,275
Yeah, and?

450
00:30:46,299 --> 00:30:49,912
The suspect was with another
American, a local resident.

451
00:30:49,936 --> 00:30:52,248
Send out a description
of the American...

452
00:30:52,272 --> 00:30:53,749
along with the photo we supply--

453
00:30:53,773 --> 00:30:56,285
every cop, all military,
every border station.

454
00:30:56,309 --> 00:30:57,887
Yes, sir.
I’ve already done that.

455
00:30:57,911 --> 00:31:01,023
That's great.
Then you can read my mind.

456
00:31:01,047 --> 00:31:03,626
The next time,
you don't give an order...

457
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:07,430
until you hear it from my lips.
Do you understand?

458
00:31:07,454 --> 00:31:10,800
And I don’t want any engagement.
ls that clear? None.

459
00:31:10,824 --> 00:31:13,903
If they see him, they call you.
You tell me. Got it?

460
00:31:13,927 --> 00:31:16,372
You have instructed us
not to engage.

461
00:31:16,396 --> 00:31:17,707
We will not engage.

462
00:31:17,731 --> 00:31:19,008
Emphasize it.

463
00:31:19,032 --> 00:31:21,611
This is our operation.
I want it handled our way.

464
00:31:21,635 --> 00:31:23,646
I don’t want some local boy
getting macho...

465
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,281
and deciding to play the hero.

466
00:31:25,305 --> 00:31:28,217
Believe me, it'll be
the last decision he makes--

467
00:31:28,241 --> 00:31:31,287
and the bloodiest.

468
00:31:31,311 --> 00:31:32,762
¡Vámonos!

469
00:31:40,954 --> 00:31:43,733
Luz, honey...

470
00:31:43,757 --> 00:31:45,935
I want you to be careful
around this guy.

471
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:47,603
We don't know anything
about him.

472
00:31:47,627 --> 00:31:50,740
You're the one who decided
to drive him across the country.

473
00:31:50,764 --> 00:31:53,409
I know, but I'm just saying
don't get too friendly.

474
00:31:53,433 --> 00:31:54,644
Did you see those scars?

475
00:31:54,668 --> 00:31:56,512
People don't have scars
like that.

476
00:31:56,536 --> 00:31:57,980
He was in the war.

477
00:31:58,004 --> 00:32:01,083
What'd they do, blow him up
and sew him back together again?

478
00:32:01,107 --> 00:32:03,619
- Danny.
- Don't get all gooey about it...

479
00:32:03,643 --> 00:32:05,187
and don't believe
everything you hear.

480
00:32:05,211 --> 00:32:07,456
He's not a lost puppy.

481
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,191
Keep your distance.

482
00:32:09,215 --> 00:32:11,627
- Ready to roll?
- Yeah, good to go.

483
00:32:11,651 --> 00:32:13,635
OK, let's do it.

484
00:32:17,157 --> 00:32:18,763
- OK?
- OK.

485
00:32:55,929 --> 00:32:57,940
This is what they don't
tell you about...

486
00:32:57,964 --> 00:32:59,709
in the travel brochures.

487
00:32:59,733 --> 00:33:01,847
Yeah, that's the trick.

488
00:33:02,769 --> 00:33:04,113
Hide the poor folk
in the jungle.

489
00:33:04,137 --> 00:33:06,415
Get your hands
on the tourist dollar.

490
00:33:06,439 --> 00:33:08,384
Yep, exactly...

491
00:33:08,408 --> 00:33:10,987
but I sure don't blame
these poor bastards.

492
00:33:11,011 --> 00:33:13,789
I was one of these
poor bastards.

493
00:33:13,813 --> 00:33:16,192
This is like the village
I grew up in.

494
00:33:16,216 --> 00:33:19,108
See that little girl?

495
00:33:21,021 --> 00:33:23,366
She's me, twenty years ago.

496
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:25,101
Why'd you leave, Luz?

497
00:33:25,752 --> 00:33:29,505
When I was fifteen,
I could've stayed...

498
00:33:29,529 --> 00:33:32,208
and become a farmer's wife
like my mother...

499
00:33:32,232 --> 00:33:34,577
and become an old woman
at thirty...

500
00:33:34,601 --> 00:33:38,114
or go to work in one of
the turista cities.

501
00:33:38,138 --> 00:33:39,582
I chose the city.

502
00:33:39,606 --> 00:33:41,250
Is your family still there?

503
00:33:41,274 --> 00:33:42,852
They're all gone...

504
00:33:42,876 --> 00:33:44,787
like dust.

505
00:33:44,811 --> 00:33:47,289
My two brothers
died of cholera...

506
00:33:47,313 --> 00:33:50,092
my father died of hard work...

507
00:33:50,116 --> 00:33:53,596
and my mother died
of broken dreams.

508
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:56,432
I was the lucky one, I guess.

509
00:33:56,456 --> 00:33:59,435
Luz worked as a maid at one of
the hotels in Puerto Vallarta...

510
00:33:59,459 --> 00:34:00,936
then as a waitress at Chulo's.

511
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,806
That's where I met her.

512
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:06,409
- Sad beginnings, happy endings.
- That's right.

513
00:34:06,433 --> 00:34:10,079
And what about you?
Where are your people from?

514
00:34:10,103 --> 00:34:12,581
Brooklyn, New York.

515
00:34:12,605 --> 00:34:14,216
But they left me.

516
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,253
My dad ran away when he was 35.

517
00:34:17,277 --> 00:34:18,788
My mom fell in love
with the bottle...

518
00:34:18,812 --> 00:34:21,490
and sent me packing
to my grandparents in Oregon...

519
00:34:21,514 --> 00:34:22,792
where I grew up.

520
00:34:22,816 --> 00:34:23,959
I’m sorry.

521
00:34:23,983 --> 00:34:27,641
Eh, fuck 'em
if they can’t take a kid.

522
00:34:34,828 --> 00:34:35,938
If we stay on 15...

523
00:34:35,962 --> 00:34:38,307
it's pretty much straight up
all the way.

524
00:34:38,331 --> 00:34:39,742
Danny...

525
00:34:39,766 --> 00:34:41,911
do you think we could go
to Rosario?

526
00:34:41,935 --> 00:34:43,212
It's not too far from here.

527
00:34:43,236 --> 00:34:46,849
Why do you want to go there for?

528
00:34:46,873 --> 00:34:49,946
I want to pay respects
to my parents...

529
00:34:51,177 --> 00:34:52,488
visit their graves.

530
00:34:52,512 --> 00:34:53,689
I’m sorry, honey.

531
00:34:53,713 --> 00:34:56,025
That takes us out of our way
to see dead people.

532
00:34:56,049 --> 00:34:58,461
Maybe we could pay our respects
on the trip back.

533
00:34:58,485 --> 00:35:00,496
We won't stop, I know.

534
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,499
No, if we take this little road
out of Escanaba...

535
00:35:03,523 --> 00:35:07,142
head west towards the sea,
we go right by Rosario.

536
00:35:07,627 --> 00:35:09,371
Well, that’s just
an inch on the map...

537
00:35:09,395 --> 00:35:11,340
but that’s about an hour by car.

538
00:35:11,364 --> 00:35:13,482
I’ll give you another 500 bucks.

539
00:35:15,201 --> 00:35:17,079
I--I don’t want
any more of your money.

540
00:35:17,103 --> 00:35:18,247
I thought you were in a hurry.

541
00:35:18,271 --> 00:35:19,782
I’m trying
to save you some time.

542
00:35:19,806 --> 00:35:21,784
I’m willing to give it up.

543
00:35:21,808 --> 00:35:24,908
I like seeing these back roads,
little villages.

544
00:35:25,378 --> 00:35:27,623
I hope so,
because you might be spending...

545
00:35:27,647 --> 00:35:30,559
a week or two in one of them
if my car breaks down.

546
00:35:30,583 --> 00:35:32,537
I’ll take that chance.

547
00:35:36,156 --> 00:35:37,630
Thank you.

548
00:35:44,164 --> 00:35:46,175
Hey, Poncho,
dos mas tequilas...

549
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:48,677
ydos mas cervezas, ahora.

550
00:35:48,701 --> 00:35:50,579
Just ignore them.
Ignore them.

551
00:35:50,603 --> 00:35:53,883
Hey, lookit.

552
00:35:55,241 --> 00:35:56,719
Borrachopendejo.

553
00:35:56,743 --> 00:35:58,187
Hey, what are you looking at?

554
00:35:58,211 --> 00:35:59,989
I was just looking
for your balls, man.

555
00:36:00,013 --> 00:36:01,423
Thought maybe
you left them up in there.

556
00:36:01,447 --> 00:36:03,392
Sit down and shut up, Danny.

557
00:36:03,416 --> 00:36:04,994
- No.
- Stop.

558
00:36:05,018 --> 00:36:06,428
Maybe you should listen
to your pussy friend, Danny.

559
00:36:06,452 --> 00:36:09,265
- Yeah, Danny boy.
- Ha ha ha ha!

560
00:36:09,289 --> 00:36:12,067
Come on, stop.

561
00:36:12,091 --> 00:36:15,971
Danny... sit down.

562
00:36:15,995 --> 00:36:17,239
Idiot.

563
00:36:17,263 --> 00:36:19,441
Hey, you got a match?

564
00:36:19,465 --> 00:36:21,744
- Yeah, I do.
- Holy shit. Pussy's got a match.

565
00:36:21,768 --> 00:36:24,113
- What are you doing?
- Just being helpful.

566
00:36:24,137 --> 00:36:27,049
Hey, man, how do you suppose
the pussy and old Danny boy...

567
00:36:27,073 --> 00:36:29,919
ended up with a piece of
first class puta like her, huh?

568
00:36:29,943 --> 00:36:31,587
¡Borracho estúpido!

569
00:36:31,611 --> 00:36:35,024
I guess money talks.

570
00:36:35,048 --> 00:36:38,527
Danny, take Luz to the car.

571
00:36:38,551 --> 00:36:41,397
Hey, toss that over here.

572
00:36:41,421 --> 00:36:44,281
Oh, I can do better than that.
Here you go.

573
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,405
Thanks.
Let me take a look at that.

574
00:36:49,429 --> 00:36:51,340
Hang on, hang on.
You need a light?

575
00:36:51,364 --> 00:36:52,374
No, I don't need a light.

576
00:36:52,398 --> 00:36:53,876
- Sure you do.
- My drink!

577
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,945
You should keep more oil
in your crank case...

578
00:36:55,969 --> 00:36:58,747
and less on your shirt.
It's a real fire hazard.

579
00:36:58,771 --> 00:37:01,584
Hey!

580
00:37:01,608 --> 00:37:02,985
Put it out! Put it out!

581
00:37:10,183 --> 00:37:13,295
I guess America wiped its ass
today, and you two fell out.

582
00:37:13,319 --> 00:37:15,431
Oh, you fucked up now.

583
00:37:15,455 --> 00:37:17,800
Get her in the car.
Start the engine.

584
00:37:17,824 --> 00:37:18,901
No, we have to help him.

585
00:37:18,925 --> 00:37:20,336
Come on.
He doesn't need our help.

586
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,403
That's right.

587
00:37:30,243 --> 00:37:31,335
Come on.

588
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:13,789
Now, what the hell
was that all about?

589
00:38:13,813 --> 00:38:15,691
Decline of the gene pool.

590
00:38:15,715 --> 00:38:17,426
You didn't have
to set the guy on fire.

591
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:19,862
No. I could've let him
cut your balls off...

592
00:38:19,886 --> 00:38:21,330
rape your girlfriend.

593
00:38:21,354 --> 00:38:22,898
It never would’ve gone to that.

594
00:38:22,922 --> 00:38:25,601
You spend too much time
with your typewriter, Danny.

595
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:28,637
In the real world, some people
aren't just fake dangerous.

596
00:38:28,661 --> 00:38:29,872
They're real dangerous.

597
00:38:29,896 --> 00:38:31,206
Oh, yeah, right.
This from the guy...

598
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,808
who has no tourist card,
remember?

599
00:38:32,832 --> 00:38:35,311
Hey, you know what?
Around here, the judiciales...

600
00:38:35,335 --> 00:38:37,046
the federal police,
are a lot more dangerous...

601
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,781
than a couple of biker trash.

602
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:45,670
Thank you, Luz.

603
00:38:51,951 --> 00:38:53,095
Stop.

604
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:54,868
- What?
- Stop.

605
00:39:21,114 --> 00:39:22,124
What is it?

606
00:39:22,148 --> 00:39:23,559
It's an ocelot.

607
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:27,896
What's it doing in the cage?

608
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,532
Oh, it's to sell to a zoo...

609
00:39:30,556 --> 00:39:32,735
or some rich tourist needs
to keep her neck warm.

610
00:39:32,759 --> 00:39:34,069
I don't know.

611
00:39:34,093 --> 00:39:36,284
Ask him how much
he wants for it.

612
00:39:38,197 --> 00:39:39,208
We can't put that thing
in my car.

613
00:39:39,232 --> 00:39:40,242
Yeah, I know.

614
00:39:40,266 --> 00:39:41,276
What are you asking
the price for?

615
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,311
To let it go.

616
00:39:42,335 --> 00:39:44,380
He says $3,000.

617
00:39:44,404 --> 00:39:46,382
He says they are very rare.

618
00:39:46,406 --> 00:39:48,317
3,000.

619
00:39:48,341 --> 00:39:50,549
I don't have that much left.

620
00:39:56,449 --> 00:39:57,723
Look at it.

621
00:40:01,087 --> 00:40:03,039
He should kill the damn thing
or let it go.

622
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:11,438
Ask him how he'd like to live
trapped in a little cage.

623
00:40:19,472 --> 00:40:22,490
He says he does.

624
00:40:29,148 --> 00:40:31,338
He used his real name.

625
00:40:32,885 --> 00:40:34,163
He's either a hostage...

626
00:40:34,187 --> 00:40:36,331
or the dumbest accomplice
in the world.

627
00:40:36,355 --> 00:40:39,101
He says they paid in cash
for two rooms.

628
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:41,537
If they used
two separate rooms...

629
00:40:41,561 --> 00:40:44,270
then it's probably not
a hostage situation, right, sir?

630
00:40:45,097 --> 00:40:47,276
Right.

631
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:50,107
Now stop talking before you ruin
West Point's reputation.

632
00:40:50,503 --> 00:40:51,923
Show me.

633
00:41:05,084 --> 00:41:07,062
He said the man and the woman
stayed in this room...

634
00:41:07,086 --> 00:41:08,578
and the suspect in the other.

635
00:41:20,566 --> 00:41:23,434
What are we hoping to find,
sir, may I ask?

636
00:41:23,836 --> 00:41:25,747
Nothing.

637
00:41:25,771 --> 00:41:28,283
He's too smart
to leave anything behind.

638
00:41:28,307 --> 00:41:30,976
I just wanted to stand
in his space for a moment...

639
00:41:32,812 --> 00:41:34,976
breathe the air he breathed.

640
00:41:40,419 --> 00:41:42,738
Maybe sniff out a clue
in the ether.

641
00:41:47,927 --> 00:41:50,172
You believe in metaphysics,
Weatherford?

642
00:41:50,196 --> 00:41:51,836
No, sir.

643
00:41:53,065 --> 00:41:54,631
Not really.

644
00:41:59,572 --> 00:42:00,926
Me, neither.

645
00:42:05,478 --> 00:42:08,023
He says the suspect went for--

646
00:42:08,047 --> 00:42:10,425
Stop with the Dick Tracy.
His name is Price.

647
00:42:10,449 --> 00:42:12,194
Price...

648
00:42:12,218 --> 00:42:14,296
took a swim in the pool.

649
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,498
Hmm.

650
00:42:16,522 --> 00:42:18,767
Sure. Why not?

651
00:42:18,791 --> 00:42:20,569
There's a dragnet
over half of Mexico...

652
00:42:20,593 --> 00:42:22,304
and he's having
a fucking pool party.

653
00:42:22,328 --> 00:42:24,840
We have the make and the model
of the car, señor.

654
00:42:24,864 --> 00:42:26,642
It’s just a matter of time.

655
00:42:26,666 --> 00:42:28,477
But how much, Rivera?

656
00:42:29,128 --> 00:42:31,680
It's not just that I'm getting
older in this steam bath...

657
00:42:31,704 --> 00:42:33,515
or that Price might
whack a few dozen people

658
00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:35,784
before we find him--
it's also embarrassing.

659
00:42:35,808 --> 00:42:37,085
I mean, where are
all the bright lights...

660
00:42:37,109 --> 00:42:38,587
of the Mexican police
and military...

661
00:42:38,611 --> 00:42:39,988
while he's taking his road trip?

662
00:42:40,012 --> 00:42:41,590
Aren’t you just
a little embarrassed?

663
00:42:41,614 --> 00:42:44,826
We haven’t found him yet,
señor, it's true...

664
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:47,129
but you created him.

665
00:42:47,153 --> 00:42:49,181
Who should be more embarrassed?

666
00:43:28,327 --> 00:43:30,309
She said she wants to be alone.

667
00:43:31,731 --> 00:43:33,690
Yeah. I’ve said that, too.

668
00:44:31,891 --> 00:44:33,769
I should've come back
to see her more...

669
00:44:33,793 --> 00:44:35,206
before she died.

670
00:44:39,098 --> 00:44:41,366
I lost so many minutes with her.

671
00:44:41,934 --> 00:44:43,053
I know.

672
00:44:44,637 --> 00:44:46,553
You wish you could go back.

673
00:44:48,007 --> 00:44:49,553
Listen a little harder...

674
00:44:50,376 --> 00:44:52,802
look a little more closely
at their eyes...

675
00:44:55,815 --> 00:44:57,966
and speak a few more kind words.

676
00:45:01,987 --> 00:45:03,486
Many more.

677
00:45:06,859 --> 00:45:08,368
If--if you could have...

678
00:45:12,231 --> 00:45:13,918
what would you have said to her?

679
00:45:15,501 --> 00:45:17,125
I would've...

680
00:45:18,904 --> 00:45:20,834
thanked her...

681
00:45:22,875 --> 00:45:24,334
for fighting...

682
00:45:27,179 --> 00:45:29,347
to give me more than she had.

683
00:45:33,185 --> 00:45:35,197
She argued with my father...

684
00:45:35,221 --> 00:45:37,309
to get me to school...

685
00:45:39,592 --> 00:45:42,809
and he beat her for her pride.

686
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:47,309
She let him beat her...

687
00:45:51,036 --> 00:45:52,808
but she won.

688
00:46:01,747 --> 00:46:04,417
Gracias, mama.

689
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:06,667
And look at you--

690
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:11,095
so smart, so beautiful.

691
00:46:12,925 --> 00:46:15,345
She would've been proud.

692
00:46:16,462 --> 00:46:17,912
No.

693
00:46:18,964 --> 00:46:22,270
I wasn’t worth being beaten for.

694
00:46:25,638 --> 00:46:27,811
I’m not a good girl.

695
00:46:46,158 --> 00:46:48,591
- You OK, honey?
- Yes.

696
00:46:49,662 --> 00:46:51,239
I've just been looking
at the map.

697
00:46:51,263 --> 00:46:53,208
You ready to head back
to 15 now or what?

698
00:46:53,232 --> 00:46:54,643
Ah, we're so near the coast.

699
00:46:54,667 --> 00:46:56,711
Let's stay on this road
for a while.

700
00:46:56,735 --> 00:46:58,191
Your dime.

701
00:47:15,254 --> 00:47:18,076
He got all ape shit.
He torched my bro, you know?

702
00:47:26,098 --> 00:47:27,442
Poor guys.

703
00:47:27,466 --> 00:47:30,378
On their way to Club Med,
minding their own business...

704
00:47:30,402 --> 00:47:32,594
and this had to happen to them.

705
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,344
Price must be losing it
if he let these two live.

706
00:47:40,112 --> 00:47:42,062
Look how perfect.

707
00:47:43,983 --> 00:47:45,649
It's timeless.

708
00:47:46,952 --> 00:47:48,499
Eternal.

709
00:47:52,458 --> 00:47:54,990
Aah! God!

710
00:47:59,531 --> 00:48:03,345
Hey, I hate to
interrupt your Zen moment...

711
00:48:03,369 --> 00:48:05,447
but the car's not happy
with this heat.

712
00:48:05,471 --> 00:48:06,982
I don't know
if we’re going to make it.

713
00:48:07,006 --> 00:48:09,818
Sure, she will. She just needs
some encouragement.

714
00:48:09,842 --> 00:48:12,621
You know, you can rub her ass
with Icy Hot...

715
00:48:12,645 --> 00:48:14,656
but I don’t think
it's going to help.

716
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,992
You may have to find yourself
another ride.

717
00:48:17,016 --> 00:48:19,227
Did you hear what I said?

718
00:48:19,251 --> 00:48:22,030
Yeah. Why don’t you use
some of those spare parts...

719
00:48:22,054 --> 00:48:23,431
you were bragging about?

720
00:48:23,455 --> 00:48:26,646
Hey, I got spare parts,
but I'm not the Pep Boys.

721
00:48:28,794 --> 00:48:31,107
Judiciales.

722
00:48:42,007 --> 00:48:44,452
- What'd he say?
- He wants your tourist cards.

723
00:48:44,476 --> 00:48:46,454
Tell him that our papers
are in the car...

724
00:48:46,478 --> 00:48:47,923
and Mr. Fisher had his stolen.

725
00:48:47,947 --> 00:48:50,325
-I speak English.
- OK, great.

726
00:48:50,349 --> 00:48:53,883
Uh...you guys
have badges, right?

727
00:48:57,122 --> 00:49:00,268
Badges? Badges?

728
00:49:00,292 --> 00:49:03,101
- You want to see our badges?
- Please.

729
00:49:05,798 --> 00:49:10,312
See? I showed you mine,
but you can't show me yours.

730
00:49:10,336 --> 00:49:11,746
Well, we all had tourist cards--

731
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:14,316
Shut up. You talk too much.

732
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,450
- OK.
- Get in the car.

733
00:49:15,474 --> 00:49:17,991
Come on, all of you.

734
00:49:18,644 --> 00:49:20,066
Hey!

735
00:49:20,713 --> 00:49:23,258
Come on, get in the car.

736
00:49:23,282 --> 00:49:25,026
Danny, I don’t want
to go with them.

737
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:27,896
Hey! Cállate.

738
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,130
Let's not argue with them.

739
00:49:29,154 --> 00:49:30,565
¡Cállate! Sube alcoche.

740
00:49:30,589 --> 00:49:33,868
¡Suelta me!

741
00:49:59,518 --> 00:50:01,119
Luz, move!

742
00:50:28,147 --> 00:50:30,859
Don't get hysterical on me now.

743
00:50:30,883 --> 00:50:32,694
Jesus. They're all dead!

744
00:50:32,718 --> 00:50:34,896
Them or us.
People die every day.

745
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,197
Yeah, when you're around.

746
00:50:36,221 --> 00:50:37,932
He saved us, Danny!

747
00:50:37,956 --> 00:50:40,568
If we’d never met him, we
wouldn't have had to be saved!

748
00:50:40,592 --> 00:50:42,937
Hey, how about
some help over here?

749
00:50:42,961 --> 00:50:45,407
No, I’ve had enough! I'm not
moving your corpses for you!

750
00:50:45,431 --> 00:50:46,975
You gonna stay here
with your thumb up your ass...

751
00:50:46,999 --> 00:50:48,243
waiting to get arrested
for murder?

752
00:50:48,267 --> 00:50:50,011
You killed them, we didn't!

753
00:50:50,035 --> 00:50:53,381
Tell that to a Mexican judge!

754
00:50:53,405 --> 00:50:54,616
Luz, don't!

755
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,548
He is right! We have no choice!

756
00:51:00,879 --> 00:51:02,590
Sorry it went down like this.

757
00:51:02,614 --> 00:51:04,893
Yeah, sorry I killed three guys.

758
00:51:04,917 --> 00:51:07,295
I’m sorry I made you
accomplices to murder.

759
00:51:07,319 --> 00:51:09,164
I’m sorry I ruined your lives!

760
00:51:09,188 --> 00:51:12,200
Danny!

761
00:51:12,224 --> 00:51:16,004
This is where we are--

762
00:51:16,028 --> 00:51:19,307
right here, right now.

763
00:51:19,331 --> 00:51:22,243
Now accept it and make a choice.

764
00:51:22,267 --> 00:51:24,746
What, Mexican justice
or going with you?

765
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:28,450
No. I'm not leaving you here
to talk to anybody.

766
00:51:28,474 --> 00:51:31,913
Going with me or my justice.

767
00:51:35,714 --> 00:51:38,631
Now come on over here
and grab this guy's feet.

768
00:51:39,952 --> 00:51:41,427
Come on.

769
00:51:43,655 --> 00:51:46,179
Luz, open the trunk.

770
00:51:46,325 --> 00:51:47,769
Luz...

771
00:51:47,793 --> 00:51:49,675
Luz, open the trunk.

772
00:52:01,573 --> 00:52:03,280
Danny, grab his feet.

773
00:52:11,383 --> 00:52:13,540
Other one in the back.

774
00:52:19,525 --> 00:52:22,103
We'll find a deserted spot
up the road to ditch them.

775
00:52:22,127 --> 00:52:24,072
Here, you drive this car.
I'll take the Jeep.

776
00:52:24,096 --> 00:52:25,206
I’ll take the Jeep.

777
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:27,514
Yeah, right. Come on, Luz.

778
00:52:29,668 --> 00:52:32,480
Hey, are we your hostages?

779
00:52:32,504 --> 00:52:34,649
No.

780
00:52:34,673 --> 00:52:36,897
You're my sidekicks.

781
00:52:56,562 --> 00:52:58,918
Thanks for helping me
back there.

782
00:53:00,532 --> 00:53:02,418
You were very brave.

783
00:53:12,477 --> 00:53:14,822
Ohh! God!

784
00:53:14,846 --> 00:53:16,645
Shit!

785
00:53:20,452 --> 00:53:21,935
No.

786
00:53:23,555 --> 00:53:25,488
What is he doing?

787
00:53:26,625 --> 00:53:28,532
Oh, my God!

788
00:53:28,994 --> 00:53:30,577
Oh, God!

789
00:53:31,463 --> 00:53:33,163
Oh, no! No!

790
00:53:36,835 --> 00:53:38,326
Hang on.

791
00:53:55,487 --> 00:53:59,062
Please, please, please,
don't hurt him! Please!

792
00:54:00,125 --> 00:54:01,469
Where the hell
do you think you’re going?

793
00:54:01,493 --> 00:54:02,503
I don't know.

794
00:54:02,527 --> 00:54:03,671
You want to get stopped
for speeding...

795
00:54:03,695 --> 00:54:04,906
with three corpses in the car?

796
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:06,808
No. I'm sorry. Honey--

797
00:54:06,832 --> 00:54:08,743
Shh. Not a problem.

798
00:54:08,767 --> 00:54:10,111
I wasn't running away.
I just--

799
00:54:10,135 --> 00:54:13,073
I--I was trying
to get away from...

800
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,150
You're going to kill us,
aren’t you?

801
00:54:16,174 --> 00:54:18,553
Not if I don't have to.
Put this thing in gear.

802
00:54:18,577 --> 00:54:20,555
Turn off at the next side road.

803
00:54:20,579 --> 00:54:22,086
Luz.

804
00:54:43,368 --> 00:54:45,599
You drive, OK?

805
00:54:46,104 --> 00:54:47,115
OK.

806
00:54:47,139 --> 00:54:48,983
And no cute stuff.

807
00:54:49,007 --> 00:54:52,361
I’m not one of those dumb ass
gangsters you wrote about.

808
00:54:52,644 --> 00:54:54,112
Look...

809
00:54:54,746 --> 00:54:56,861
just get me to the border...

810
00:54:57,115 --> 00:54:59,123
and you'll get your life back.

811
00:55:00,819 --> 00:55:02,374
OK.

812
00:55:26,678 --> 00:55:28,389
We'll take
the Durango turnoff...

813
00:55:28,413 --> 00:55:29,557
and head east
into the mountains.

814
00:55:29,581 --> 00:55:32,427
You killed those men
in Puerto Vallarta, didn’t you?

815
00:55:32,451 --> 00:55:34,696
- You know I did.
- What do you mean?

816
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,731
You saw me.
You were looking right at me.

817
00:55:36,755 --> 00:55:39,870
- No, I wasn't.
- You were looking right at me.

818
00:55:40,325 --> 00:55:42,236
Danny, is that true?

819
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:44,772
No. I mean, I wasn't sure.

820
00:55:44,796 --> 00:55:46,607
I saw his hand
under his vest and--

821
00:55:46,631 --> 00:55:48,676
You weren't sure?

822
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:52,013
You agreed to drive him,
and you weren't sure?

823
00:55:52,037 --> 00:55:55,183
You thought maybe he killed
two people, maybe he didn't?

824
00:55:55,207 --> 00:55:56,684
I thought at first,
if it was him...

825
00:55:56,708 --> 00:55:58,753
I could handle it,
but I didn't know, OK?

826
00:55:58,777 --> 00:56:01,489
Well, what about me?
You let me come with you.

827
00:56:01,513 --> 00:56:03,791
Did you think
I could handle it, too?

828
00:56:03,815 --> 00:56:06,160
You insisted on coming,
remember? You just had to come.

829
00:56:06,184 --> 00:56:07,929
I didn't know everything, Danny.

830
00:56:07,953 --> 00:56:10,631
- Well, neither did I!
- You knew more than I did...

831
00:56:10,655 --> 00:56:14,802
and you didn’t tell me.
It's your fault we're here.

832
00:56:14,826 --> 00:56:17,205
Me? What about him?

833
00:56:17,229 --> 00:56:19,507
Boy, those sins of omission
will get you every time.

834
00:56:19,531 --> 00:56:22,543
And you--I was standing
right next to that man.

835
00:56:22,567 --> 00:56:24,078
You could've killed me!

836
00:56:24,102 --> 00:56:26,247
No, I couldn't. I don't miss.

837
00:56:26,271 --> 00:56:29,317
So proud to be
a killer of men...

838
00:56:29,341 --> 00:56:30,818
to steal a human life.

839
00:56:30,842 --> 00:56:32,854
There is a dark spot
on your soul...

840
00:56:32,878 --> 00:56:34,655
for every man you have killed.

841
00:56:34,679 --> 00:56:36,724
Then it must be
pitch black by now.

842
00:56:36,748 --> 00:56:38,793
Yes, it must.

843
00:56:38,817 --> 00:56:41,140
God weeps for you.

844
00:56:50,962 --> 00:56:53,541
What can we expect at the road?

845
00:56:53,565 --> 00:56:55,443
Nothing for a while.

846
00:56:55,467 --> 00:56:58,112
Then Concordia--
that's an inspection station...

847
00:56:58,136 --> 00:56:59,863
and they got guns.

848
00:57:02,839 --> 00:57:04,338
We better get cleaned up.

849
00:57:21,159 --> 00:57:24,138
Luz...not too far.

850
00:57:24,162 --> 00:57:27,241
I won't try to swim
across the border.

851
00:57:27,265 --> 00:57:29,143
May I have a little privacy?

852
00:57:29,167 --> 00:57:30,344
No.

853
00:57:30,368 --> 00:57:32,819
I want you both
where I can see you.

854
00:57:38,210 --> 00:57:39,821
Luz, what are you doing?

855
00:57:39,845 --> 00:57:42,490
What? He wants to see me.

856
00:57:43,545 --> 00:57:47,415
Make sure I'm not carrying
a bomb or a knife or a gun.

857
00:57:48,854 --> 00:57:52,711
When you're a killer,
you think everyone is a killer.

858
00:57:58,797 --> 00:58:00,764
When you're done, let's go.

859
00:58:29,327 --> 00:58:32,073
Shit. A Galil.

860
00:58:32,097 --> 00:58:33,708
What's that mean?

861
00:58:33,732 --> 00:58:36,511
It means
don't do anything stupid.

862
00:58:36,535 --> 00:58:38,446
The kid probably doesn't know
how to use that thing.

863
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:41,782
He could hose us all down
in a second if he freaks out.

864
00:58:41,806 --> 00:58:44,018
Thanks for helping me
appear nonchalant.

865
00:58:44,042 --> 00:58:46,020
And don’t try acting out
that little drama...

866
00:58:46,044 --> 00:58:48,022
you're playing around
in your head...

867
00:58:48,046 --> 00:58:51,259
'cause I'll be rewriting
the ending, you understand?

868
00:58:51,283 --> 00:58:52,994
Understand?

869
00:58:53,018 --> 00:58:54,228
Yes.

870
00:58:54,252 --> 00:58:55,730
Luz?

871
00:58:55,754 --> 00:58:58,533
I’m just a dumb Mexican chick
in the back seat.

872
00:58:58,557 --> 00:59:00,601
Heh.

873
00:59:00,625 --> 00:59:03,504
All right.

874
00:59:03,528 --> 00:59:04,839
Smile, people.

875
00:59:04,863 --> 00:59:06,949
We’re just one big happy family.

876
00:59:09,901 --> 00:59:11,279
¿Habla español?

877
00:59:11,303 --> 00:59:12,580
Muypoco.

878
00:59:13,418 --> 00:59:14,954
Luz?

879
00:59:23,381 --> 00:59:24,971
The engine.

880
00:59:30,455 --> 00:59:32,934
The rocks on the beach
were slippery, weren’t they?

881
00:59:32,958 --> 00:59:35,536
Oh, Si, Si. Pronto.

882
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:37,471
Yes.

883
00:59:37,495 --> 00:59:39,206
You should be more careful.

884
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:41,609
Mexico can be very dangerous...

885
00:59:41,633 --> 00:59:44,406
if you are not...careful.

886
00:59:45,503 --> 00:59:47,011
¿Está bien?

887
00:59:49,174 --> 00:59:51,085
Muy bien.

888
00:59:51,109 --> 00:59:52,790
Gracias.

889
01:00:03,955 --> 01:00:05,633
That--that was pretty easy.

890
01:00:05,657 --> 01:00:07,134
Yeah, maybe too easy.

891
01:00:07,158 --> 01:00:09,837
- How do you mean?
- Nothing.

892
01:00:09,861 --> 01:00:12,473
What's the most direct route
north from here?

893
01:00:12,497 --> 01:00:15,176
- I think we're on it.
- Well, pull off.

894
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,940
Let's try to avoid
the main roads.

895
01:00:21,306 --> 01:00:23,117
Is this heap gonna make it?

896
01:00:23,141 --> 01:00:26,654
If we don't drive it into
the ground, I think so, yeah.

897
01:00:26,678 --> 01:00:30,992
Let's find a little town where
we can rehabilitate ourselves...

898
01:00:31,016 --> 01:00:32,426
and hopefully, the car.

899
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:34,895
I’m bettin' on the car.

900
01:00:34,919 --> 01:00:36,964
Hey, Luz,
you did good back there.

901
01:00:36,988 --> 01:00:39,467
I did it for us, not for you.

902
01:00:39,491 --> 01:00:41,302
Yeah, well...

903
01:00:41,326 --> 01:00:43,175
thanks anyway.

904
01:01:16,761 --> 01:01:18,472
What is this?

905
01:01:18,496 --> 01:01:21,308
Ricardo Montalban's birthday?

906
01:01:21,332 --> 01:01:23,377
These small towns
are always looking...

907
01:01:23,401 --> 01:01:25,079
for an excuse for a fiesta.

908
01:01:25,103 --> 01:01:27,515
Probably remembering
some local...

909
01:01:27,539 --> 01:01:30,785
who saw the Virgin
in a cornfield or something.

910
01:01:30,809 --> 01:01:33,087
Excuse me. Mexican in the car.

911
01:01:33,111 --> 01:01:36,357
I’m sorry, Luz.

912
01:01:36,381 --> 01:01:38,192
Never mind. It's true.

913
01:01:38,216 --> 01:01:41,095
Better for us.

914
01:01:42,151 --> 01:01:43,650
Easier to get lost.

915
01:01:49,094 --> 01:01:52,206
That looks like a hotel
over there.

916
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:55,810
You want to check it out?

917
01:01:56,208 --> 01:01:57,458
Yeah.

918
01:02:04,275 --> 01:02:05,753
You two go check in.

919
01:02:05,777 --> 01:02:09,190
Oh...and no secret messages
to the clerk.

920
01:02:09,214 --> 01:02:11,225
No paper airplanes for help
out the window.

921
01:02:11,249 --> 01:02:13,427
Nothing you ever read
or wrote about.

922
01:02:13,451 --> 01:02:15,912
That shit only works
on paper. Clear?

923
01:02:21,993 --> 01:02:23,437
Good.

924
01:02:23,461 --> 01:02:25,806
Because,
whether you know it or not...

925
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:27,541
you're both better off
with me now...

926
01:02:27,565 --> 01:02:29,510
than you would be
with the authorities.

927
01:02:29,534 --> 01:02:31,812
Really?
Now, what happens to us...

928
01:02:31,836 --> 01:02:34,882
after we ditch you at
the border, assuming we make it?

929
01:02:34,906 --> 01:02:38,152
Hostages, temporary insanity.
I'll think of something.

930
01:02:38,176 --> 01:02:41,188
Let's take care of this life...

931
01:02:41,212 --> 01:02:43,355
before we worry about the next.

932
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:46,961
Go on.

933
01:03:22,453 --> 01:03:23,764
Room 17.

934
01:03:23,788 --> 01:03:25,982
Meet me in that restaurant
across the plaza.

935
01:03:27,992 --> 01:03:29,404
Ten minutes.

936
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:43,919
We're in room 18.

937
01:03:51,482 --> 01:03:52,869
Go ahead, honey.

938
01:04:07,131 --> 01:04:11,946
Should we go to the police?

939
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:13,280
In this town?

940
01:04:13,304 --> 01:04:15,983
Some old man
and his brother-in-law?

941
01:04:16,007 --> 01:04:19,587
They probably
don't even have guns.

942
01:04:19,611 --> 01:04:23,891
By the time the real police
or the judiciales get here...

943
01:04:23,915 --> 01:04:27,494
we could be dead.

944
01:04:27,518 --> 01:04:31,232
We could get in the car,
try to make a run for it.

945
01:04:31,256 --> 01:04:33,467
Not in that car.

946
01:04:33,491 --> 01:04:35,803
But he's right.

947
01:04:35,827 --> 01:04:38,372
Where would we go?

948
01:04:38,396 --> 01:04:41,014
The judiciales
are more scary than he is.

949
01:04:43,234 --> 01:04:45,946
If he hadn't killed
those three today...

950
01:04:45,970 --> 01:04:48,382
we'd both be in jail now.

951
01:04:48,406 --> 01:04:50,918
And I would've been fucked...

952
01:04:50,942 --> 01:04:52,477
by three men, at least.

953
01:04:56,648 --> 01:04:58,459
What should we do?

954
01:05:00,318 --> 01:05:03,364
Now you want my advice?

955
01:05:03,388 --> 01:05:05,466
You think I would've
agreed to drive him...

956
01:05:05,490 --> 01:05:07,301
if I had known
this was gonna happen?

957
01:05:07,325 --> 01:05:08,903
Or let you come with us?

958
01:05:08,927 --> 01:05:12,239
I don't know,
but you should've known, Danny.

959
01:05:12,263 --> 01:05:13,874
I’m sorry, honey.

960
01:05:13,898 --> 01:05:17,578
Don't. I'm too angry
to take care of you.

961
01:05:17,602 --> 01:05:20,013
I’m too tired
to make love to you.

962
01:05:28,346 --> 01:05:31,158
Where the fuck are we anyway?

963
01:05:31,182 --> 01:05:32,860
Somewhere in between--

964
01:05:32,884 --> 01:05:35,060
Never mind.
Surprise me later.

965
01:05:38,756 --> 01:05:41,156
You ever watch any of those
V.D. training films?

966
01:05:44,796 --> 01:05:46,740
Sir, I think
they stopped showing those...

967
01:05:46,764 --> 01:05:48,776
after the Korean War.

968
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:52,212
Damn shame, too, given all
the disease roaming around here.

969
01:05:56,107 --> 01:05:57,985
You got someone back home?

970
01:05:58,009 --> 01:05:59,326
No, sir.

971
01:06:00,578 --> 01:06:02,022
You?

972
01:06:02,046 --> 01:06:03,891
Nah.

973
01:06:03,915 --> 01:06:05,859
I live with
this middle-aged woman...

974
01:06:05,883 --> 01:06:08,696
who claims to be my wife,
but...

975
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:12,166
I stopped arguing with her
about it a long time ago.

976
01:06:12,190 --> 01:06:14,501
I just stay out of her way.

977
01:06:14,525 --> 01:06:16,704
I’m married to Uncle Sam.

978
01:06:16,728 --> 01:06:18,697
I’m his bitch, just like you.

979
01:06:21,366 --> 01:06:23,711
No, I don't...

980
01:06:23,735 --> 01:06:25,279
I don't see--

981
01:06:25,303 --> 01:06:26,992
I don't quite see it
that way, sir.

982
01:06:27,243 --> 01:06:30,117
Oh. Ha ha. You will.

983
01:06:30,441 --> 01:06:32,653
Relationships have a way of...

984
01:06:32,677 --> 01:06:35,626
creeping up on you,
then all of a sudden, bam!

985
01:06:36,414 --> 01:06:37,724
You're screwed.

986
01:06:40,184 --> 01:06:42,346
But you’re young.

987
01:06:43,187 --> 01:06:44,865
What are you, 11? 12?

988
01:06:44,889 --> 01:06:45,966
25, sir.

989
01:06:45,990 --> 01:06:47,067
- Get out.
- No.

990
01:06:48,292 --> 01:06:50,004
Old fart.

991
01:06:52,397 --> 01:06:53,918
You guys are all the same.

992
01:06:54,866 --> 01:06:56,418
Iowa?

993
01:06:57,135 --> 01:06:58,629
Rifle team?

994
01:06:59,437 --> 01:07:01,181
Class president?

995
01:07:01,205 --> 01:07:02,316
4-H Club?

996
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:03,584
No. You're close, sir.

997
01:07:03,608 --> 01:07:04,918
Oh!

998
01:07:04,942 --> 01:07:06,787
Ohio.

999
01:07:06,811 --> 01:07:08,455
And, uh...

1000
01:07:08,479 --> 01:07:10,424
I couldn’t join
the 4-H Club, sir...

1001
01:07:10,448 --> 01:07:11,917
because my cow died.

1002
01:07:14,585 --> 01:07:16,756
Good, Weatherford.

1003
01:07:17,455 --> 01:07:19,833
You must've spent
your junior year...

1004
01:07:19,857 --> 01:07:22,069
abroad from the academy
growing a sense of humor.

1005
01:07:22,093 --> 01:07:23,614
Thank you, sir.

1006
01:07:25,997 --> 01:07:29,243
Keep it. You'll need it.
It might save you...

1007
01:07:29,267 --> 01:07:31,391
from a razor blade
to the wrists one day.

1008
01:08:28,526 --> 01:08:29,972
Gracias.

1009
01:08:34,665 --> 01:08:36,250
Let me have the car keys.

1010
01:08:43,274 --> 01:08:46,050
If you feel like leaving,
don't let us stop you.

1011
01:08:46,551 --> 01:08:49,423
Oh, I wouldn't leave you
stranded here.

1012
01:08:49,447 --> 01:08:51,825
That's why you followed us
to the church...

1013
01:08:51,849 --> 01:08:54,962
in Puerto Vallarta--
the car.

1014
01:08:54,986 --> 01:08:58,365
I did hear the bartender
mention it during the argument.

1015
01:08:58,389 --> 01:09:02,136
What if Danny
hadn't agreed to drive you?

1016
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:04,771
I couldn't risk
having him finger me.

1017
01:09:04,795 --> 01:09:08,142
He'd already proved
he had a big mouth in the bar.

1018
01:09:08,166 --> 01:09:10,110
So, what,
you would've killed me?

1019
01:09:10,134 --> 01:09:12,779
Keep your voice down.

1020
01:09:12,803 --> 01:09:14,481
You're completely amoral.

1021
01:09:14,505 --> 01:09:17,618
Don't throw your boy scout
code of honor in my face.

1022
01:09:17,642 --> 01:09:20,287
I’ve been fighting battles
for you for thirty years.

1023
01:09:20,311 --> 01:09:22,656
- For me?
- Yeah, that's right.

1024
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:24,525
While you were jerking off
in college...

1025
01:09:24,549 --> 01:09:26,527
I was shooting people
and getting shot at...

1026
01:09:26,551 --> 01:09:28,629
in Vietnam and Loas
and Cambodia and Panama.

1027
01:09:28,653 --> 01:09:31,806
Well, thanks for killing
all those strangers for me.

1028
01:09:32,190 --> 01:09:35,351
Don't mention it, you pampered,
ungrateful bag of shit.

1029
01:09:46,103 --> 01:09:48,783
How many people have you killed?

1030
01:09:51,776 --> 01:09:53,828
300 and change.

1031
01:09:54,078 --> 01:09:57,749
300 men?

1032
01:09:57,915 --> 01:10:00,794
And women and kids...

1033
01:10:00,818 --> 01:10:02,930
and they were all soldiers.

1034
01:10:02,954 --> 01:10:04,882
So, you were the good guys?

1035
01:10:06,691 --> 01:10:08,235
That's what we thought.

1036
01:10:08,259 --> 01:10:10,204
What'd they think they were?

1037
01:10:10,228 --> 01:10:13,106
Were they the bad guys
because they weren't paying you?

1038
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:15,576
Well, I guess morality
is pretty subjective.

1039
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,579
Look at you.
You sold yourself...

1040
01:10:18,603 --> 01:10:20,681
your car, and your girlfriend
for five grand.

1041
01:10:20,705 --> 01:10:23,383
And you're the most
self-righteous bastard I know.

1042
01:10:23,407 --> 01:10:25,919
-I don't kill people for money!
- Danny.

1043
01:10:25,943 --> 01:10:27,521
Don’t tell me!

1044
01:10:27,545 --> 01:10:28,855
The fiesta's outside, fellas.

1045
01:10:28,879 --> 01:10:31,258
Oh, I'm sorry.
I liked that song, too.

1046
01:10:31,282 --> 01:10:33,860
Maybe you could like it
a little more quietly.

1047
01:10:33,884 --> 01:10:35,295
Yes, ma'am.

1048
01:10:35,319 --> 01:10:36,697
Sit down.

1049
01:10:36,721 --> 01:10:38,075
Sit down, Danny.

1050
01:10:44,962 --> 01:10:46,873
We'll finish eating
and then take a walk.

1051
01:10:46,897 --> 01:10:48,141
We all could use one.

1052
01:10:48,165 --> 01:10:50,877
I don't want to take a walk.

1053
01:10:50,901 --> 01:10:52,405
I wasn't giving you a choice.

1054
01:11:08,686 --> 01:11:10,931
Would you have shot me, too?

1055
01:11:10,955 --> 01:11:12,492
No.

1056
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:15,402
Maybe it was the way you looked
when you tripped...

1057
01:11:15,426 --> 01:11:17,788
coming down those stairs
out of the church.

1058
01:11:21,699 --> 01:11:24,478
You were waiting for us
outside the church?

1059
01:11:24,502 --> 01:11:26,747
I walked over to you, remember?

1060
01:11:26,771 --> 01:11:28,649
But I mean before that.

1061
01:11:28,673 --> 01:11:30,617
You were lying in wait for us?

1062
01:11:30,641 --> 01:11:32,552
Forget it. I don't want you
freaking out again.

1063
01:11:32,576 --> 01:11:35,022
- Were you or weren't you?
-I didn't do it, did I?

1064
01:11:35,046 --> 01:11:36,957
I can't believe this.
You make me sick!

1065
01:11:36,981 --> 01:11:39,144
- Hey, keep walking.
- No!

1066
01:11:40,217 --> 01:11:42,029
Keep walking.

1067
01:11:42,053 --> 01:11:44,798
Don't let it spook you.

1068
01:11:44,822 --> 01:11:46,800
We all brush against death...

1069
01:11:46,824 --> 01:11:49,202
so many times in our lives
without knowing it.

1070
01:11:49,226 --> 01:11:51,004
This was just one
you found out about.

1071
01:11:51,028 --> 01:11:54,174
It must feel wonderful thinking
you have all this power.

1072
01:11:54,198 --> 01:11:55,609
It’s just business to me.

1073
01:11:55,633 --> 01:11:57,411
Yeah. If you'd taken
better care of business...

1074
01:11:57,435 --> 01:11:58,979
none of this would've happened.

1075
01:11:59,003 --> 01:12:01,181
I mean, come on!
Two guys in broad daylight?

1076
01:12:01,205 --> 01:12:02,716
On a crowded street?

1077
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:04,885
A little sloppy,
don’t you think?

1078
01:12:04,909 --> 01:12:06,953
I'd been trailing
the civilian for days.

1079
01:12:06,977 --> 01:12:09,122
First time he was exposed.

1080
01:12:09,146 --> 01:12:11,024
Who was he?

1081
01:12:11,048 --> 01:12:12,392
I don't know.

1082
01:12:12,416 --> 01:12:14,761
Some guy who’d been selling
something to the Chinese.

1083
01:12:14,785 --> 01:12:16,563
Computer technology.

1084
01:12:16,587 --> 01:12:19,767
They don’t tell me that stuff.
The U.S. government, that is.

1085
01:12:20,191 --> 01:12:21,968
So, then why are you running?

1086
01:12:21,992 --> 01:12:24,504
I wasn't contracted
for the other hit--

1087
01:12:24,528 --> 01:12:25,972
the navy officer.

1088
01:12:25,996 --> 01:12:27,741
You mean that was a mistake?

1089
01:12:27,765 --> 01:12:29,810
I was standing
right next to him.

1090
01:12:29,834 --> 01:12:32,646
Not a technical mistake.
A personal one.

1091
01:12:32,670 --> 01:12:34,748
What do you mean?

1092
01:12:34,772 --> 01:12:36,516
I knew the guy.

1093
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:38,098
I wanted to kill him.

1094
01:14:02,529 --> 01:14:03,979
Danny?

1095
01:14:20,144 --> 01:14:21,606
I’m right here, honey.

1096
01:14:23,981 --> 01:14:25,657
Where were you?

1097
01:14:26,116 --> 01:14:27,294
Restless.

1098
01:14:27,318 --> 01:14:29,196
I got some fresh air.

1099
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:30,931
What are you doing up?

1100
01:14:30,955 --> 01:14:32,981
I hear him cry out.

1101
01:14:33,290 --> 01:14:35,695
Guilt and remorse.

1102
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:38,505
Should we go to him?

1103
01:14:38,529 --> 01:14:40,674
What? No.

1104
01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:47,981
Let him live with his ghosts.

1105
01:14:48,005 --> 01:14:49,589
He created them.

1106
01:15:08,292 --> 01:15:10,704
No use. She's done this before.

1107
01:15:10,728 --> 01:15:13,519
- The fuel pump's shot.
- Can you fix it?

1108
01:15:13,931 --> 01:15:15,768
Yeah, with a new fuel pump.

1109
01:15:16,133 --> 01:15:17,944
Any chance of finding one here?

1110
01:15:17,968 --> 01:15:19,412
No way, not in this burg.

1111
01:15:19,436 --> 01:15:20,914
I have to take
the old one out...

1112
01:15:20,938 --> 01:15:23,717
find a replacement in a bigger
town, like Mazatlán, maybe.

1113
01:15:23,741 --> 01:15:25,185
How do you get there?

1114
01:15:25,209 --> 01:15:27,287
There are buses going between
these small towns all the time.

1115
01:15:27,311 --> 01:15:29,656
I could probably get there
and back in one day.

1116
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:31,491
How far are we from the border?

1117
01:15:31,515 --> 01:15:33,159
24 hours
driving straight through.

1118
01:15:33,183 --> 01:15:34,895
But even if we could
get this thing started...

1119
01:15:34,919 --> 01:15:36,630
she'd never make it.
Ln fact...

1120
01:15:36,654 --> 01:15:38,098
we're lucky we found out here.

1121
01:15:38,122 --> 01:15:39,670
Oh, yeah. Lucky.

1122
01:15:40,558 --> 01:15:43,069
So, do Luz and I go?

1123
01:15:44,361 --> 01:15:46,206
You go. Luz stays.

1124
01:15:46,230 --> 01:15:48,575
I’ll need her to translate.

1125
01:15:48,599 --> 01:15:50,677
Just hold up the old fuel pump.

1126
01:15:50,701 --> 01:15:52,412
A picture's worth
a thousand words.

1127
01:15:52,436 --> 01:15:54,915
-I’m not leaving her.
- You don't have a choice.

1128
01:15:54,939 --> 01:15:58,107
Come on, Luz.
Danny has a fuel pump to remove.

1129
01:16:09,787 --> 01:16:12,933
Jeez, man, can’t you wait
till we get to the beach?

1130
01:16:12,957 --> 01:16:18,438
Yeah, you left a trail of piss
all the way from Baja.

1131
01:16:18,462 --> 01:16:20,840
You must have a bladder
the size of a little girl's.

1132
01:16:20,864 --> 01:16:22,964
Yeah, fuck off, both of you.

1133
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:25,969
An iguana's gonna bite
your dick off in there!

1134
01:16:26,036 --> 01:16:27,581
It couldn't handle it!

1135
01:16:27,605 --> 01:16:29,018
It couldn't find it!

1136
01:16:41,418 --> 01:16:43,129
Hey, you guys! Come here!

1137
01:16:43,153 --> 01:16:44,931
All right, what now?

1138
01:16:44,955 --> 01:16:46,825
Come take a look at this!

1139
01:16:47,024 --> 01:16:50,204
What's up, little buddy?
You can't do this yourself?

1140
01:17:01,105 --> 01:17:02,415
Aw, fuck.

1141
01:17:02,439 --> 01:17:03,650
Aw, fuck.

1142
01:17:03,674 --> 01:17:04,951
Don't go down there!

1143
01:17:04,975 --> 01:17:06,987
Come on! Come on, you guys!

1144
01:17:07,011 --> 01:17:08,194
Come on!

1145
01:17:12,282 --> 01:17:13,960
Oh, shit!

1146
01:17:13,984 --> 01:17:15,295
Come on, you guys!

1147
01:17:15,319 --> 01:17:19,132
OK. There's a bus
out of here in 15 minutes...

1148
01:17:19,156 --> 01:17:21,110
and another one in three hours.

1149
01:17:24,928 --> 01:17:27,507
Here's your ticket.

1150
01:17:27,531 --> 01:17:30,143
Get on that next bus
and meet me in Mazatlán.

1151
01:17:30,167 --> 01:17:32,045
What? What about the fuel pump?

1152
01:17:32,069 --> 01:17:33,813
There's nothing wrong
with the fuel pump.

1153
01:17:33,837 --> 01:17:35,649
I rigged the engine last night
so it wouldn’t start.

1154
01:17:35,673 --> 01:17:37,651
Danny, we can't
leave him here alone.

1155
01:17:37,675 --> 01:17:40,053
- Really? Why not?
- They'll kill him.

1156
01:17:40,077 --> 01:17:41,655
Well, perfect.
Better him than us.

1157
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:44,658
- He's been good to us.
- To you, yeah.

1158
01:17:44,682 --> 01:17:48,161
I know he's killed people,
but he seems decent.

1159
01:17:48,185 --> 01:17:50,664
There's an American word
for that-- psychopath.

1160
01:17:50,688 --> 01:17:52,032
What's wrong with you?

1161
01:17:52,056 --> 01:17:53,566
Nothing! It's just not right!

1162
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:55,168
-I can't--
- Yes, you can.

1163
01:17:55,192 --> 01:17:57,504
You have to! And you will.

1164
01:17:57,528 --> 01:18:01,440
Now, find an excuse to be alone
at 3:00 and get on that bus.

1165
01:18:01,632 --> 01:18:02,935
Now, here.

1166
01:18:04,735 --> 01:18:06,413
- OK?
- OK.

1167
01:18:06,437 --> 01:18:08,081
He's right in front
of the hotel.

1168
01:18:08,105 --> 01:18:10,483
- Take that look off your face.
- OK.

1169
01:18:10,507 --> 01:18:12,819
Come and see me off
as if nothing's wrong.

1170
01:18:12,843 --> 01:18:14,411
OK.

1171
01:18:28,325 --> 01:18:31,377
I’m betting on this guy
to win the talent competition.

1172
01:18:31,762 --> 01:18:33,890
Maybe he thinks
we're Hollywood scouts, sir.

1173
01:18:56,086 --> 01:18:58,098
What's happening, colonel?

1174
01:18:58,122 --> 01:19:00,967
Excuse me, colonel.

1175
01:19:00,991 --> 01:19:01,670
Colonel?

1176
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:02,919
- Excuse me.
- Not now.

1177
01:19:02,919 --> 01:19:03,939
Excuse me!

1178
01:19:09,066 --> 01:19:11,720
Well...so much for
the good neighbor policy.

1179
01:19:16,774 --> 01:19:19,919
Tell me.

1180
01:19:19,943 --> 01:19:21,788
Three men dead--
judiciales.

1181
01:19:21,812 --> 01:19:24,557
I’m still in charge. Clear?

1182
01:19:24,581 --> 01:19:26,726
My men are dying.

1183
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:29,229
This is our operation now.

1184
01:19:29,253 --> 01:19:31,965
No. That doesn't change a thing.

1185
01:19:31,989 --> 01:19:34,824
I disagree, señor.
Get in your car.

1186
01:19:46,170 --> 01:19:47,922
Here it comes.

1187
01:19:56,046 --> 01:19:57,624
Bye, honey.

1188
01:19:57,648 --> 01:19:59,626
Adiós, mivida.

1189
01:19:59,650 --> 01:20:02,061
Don’t worry. I'll see you soon.

1190
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:05,449
She'll be all right.

1191
01:20:27,144 --> 01:20:28,713
Hard saying good-bye.

1192
01:20:29,646 --> 01:20:31,124
It shouldn't be.

1193
01:20:31,949 --> 01:20:35,424
I’ve been saying good-bye
to Danny since I’ve met him.

1194
01:20:35,586 --> 01:20:37,115
What do you mean?

1195
01:20:38,789 --> 01:20:40,834
I’m the girl you leave.

1196
01:20:40,858 --> 01:20:43,770
The girl you don't marry,
you never take home...

1197
01:20:43,794 --> 01:20:45,171
or even across the border.

1198
01:20:45,195 --> 01:20:48,858
I’m only fit for someone
living in exile or desperation.

1199
01:20:50,067 --> 01:20:52,579
I’m the desperation girl.

1200
01:20:52,603 --> 01:20:55,348
I always get left.

1201
01:20:55,372 --> 01:20:58,952
The question is when.

1202
01:20:58,976 --> 01:21:01,020
You deserve a lot more.

1203
01:21:01,044 --> 01:21:02,489
No.

1204
01:21:02,913 --> 01:21:04,957
You don't know me well enough.

1205
01:21:05,582 --> 01:21:07,153
Yeah, I do.

1206
01:21:11,555 --> 01:21:13,399
You want lunch or something?

1207
01:21:13,423 --> 01:21:15,238
Something.

1208
01:21:58,802 --> 01:22:00,335
Did you ever pray?

1209
01:22:01,405 --> 01:22:03,316
Yeah, during the war.

1210
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:05,719
When I was being tortured,
I prayed I'd die.

1211
01:22:06,310 --> 01:22:08,385
When I didn't, I gave up on God.

1212
01:22:08,946 --> 01:22:11,324
It's a sin to pray for death.

1213
01:22:11,348 --> 01:22:14,520
I don’t think God is
even counting my sins anymore.

1214
01:22:14,818 --> 01:22:16,219
He is.

1215
01:22:16,553 --> 01:22:18,431
But he forgives you.

1216
01:22:18,455 --> 01:22:20,281
We are all sinners.

1217
01:22:37,441 --> 01:22:39,018
I’m tired.

1218
01:22:39,042 --> 01:22:41,007
Do you mind if I rest?

1219
01:22:41,478 --> 01:22:42,957
No, not at all.

1220
01:25:36,853 --> 01:25:37,905
Luz!

1221
01:25:39,994 --> 01:25:41,244
Luz!

1222
01:25:46,930 --> 01:25:49,142
I couldn't leave you alone.

1223
01:25:49,166 --> 01:25:50,309
I know.

1224
01:25:50,333 --> 01:25:52,512
There's nothing wrong
with the fuel pump.

1225
01:25:52,536 --> 01:25:54,614
Danny wanted me
to meet him in Mazatlán.

1226
01:25:54,638 --> 01:25:57,328
Yeah, I know. The 3:00 bus.
I saw him buy the ticket.

1227
01:25:57,541 --> 01:25:59,018
Then why didn’t you--

1228
01:25:59,042 --> 01:26:00,661
I wanted you to stay...

1229
01:26:01,645 --> 01:26:03,549
but only if you wanted to.

1230
01:26:14,491 --> 01:26:18,394
The first time I was with Danny,
it was for money.

1231
01:26:20,830 --> 01:26:23,109
I did work at Chulo's...

1232
01:26:23,133 --> 01:26:26,679
but I didn't make enough money
to live on...

1233
01:26:26,703 --> 01:26:27,985
or to send home.

1234
01:26:29,239 --> 01:26:30,685
So...

1235
01:26:34,611 --> 01:26:36,497
sometimes I went with men.

1236
01:26:38,548 --> 01:26:40,826
Those bikers
at the restaurant knew.

1237
01:26:42,552 --> 01:26:43,997
I am a puta.

1238
01:26:46,256 --> 01:26:47,634
They didn't know anything...

1239
01:26:48,592 --> 01:26:50,133
except that you're beautiful.

1240
01:26:51,394 --> 01:26:55,306
Scum like that
think all women are whores.

1241
01:26:55,832 --> 01:26:57,257
But I was.

1242
01:26:58,101 --> 01:27:00,446
Danny never throws it
in my face...

1243
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:01,857
never mentions it.

1244
01:27:04,140 --> 01:27:06,069
Still, it's always there...

1245
01:27:06,876 --> 01:27:08,320
I think...

1246
01:27:09,646 --> 01:27:11,819
in the back of his mind.

1247
01:27:12,582 --> 01:27:14,220
And now yours.

1248
01:27:15,118 --> 01:27:18,538
You had a hard time.
You had to stay alive.

1249
01:27:19,256 --> 01:27:20,689
I understand that.

1250
01:27:20,991 --> 01:27:24,420
What will he think
when I don't show up?

1251
01:27:24,794 --> 01:27:26,315
He'll accept it.

1252
01:27:28,164 --> 01:27:29,616
If not now, then later.

1253
01:27:30,267 --> 01:27:32,479
Am I a bad girl?

1254
01:27:34,204 --> 01:27:36,932
No, no, no.

1255
01:27:37,674 --> 01:27:39,310
God forgives you.

1256
01:27:48,318 --> 01:27:49,771
We're all sinners.

1257
01:31:09,686 --> 01:31:11,597
Bad dream?

1258
01:31:13,523 --> 01:31:17,536
Yeah, they're all bad.

1259
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:19,772
I heard you last night.

1260
01:31:19,796 --> 01:31:22,483
Same dream, over and over,
since the war.

1261
01:31:24,767 --> 01:31:26,395
Lo siento tanto.

1262
01:31:27,337 --> 01:31:30,246
Some memories are too 
terrible to live with.

1263
01:31:32,408 --> 01:31:34,745
I thought they’d stop
after I killed him.

1264
01:31:34,978 --> 01:31:36,482
Killed who?

1265
01:31:38,448 --> 01:31:40,493
That guy in Puerto Vallarta.

1266
01:31:40,517 --> 01:31:42,429
The navy officer.

1267
01:31:45,255 --> 01:31:49,428
He left me to die in Cambodia,
in the jungle.

1268
01:31:52,061 --> 01:31:54,429
My spotter and I
were trapped there.

1269
01:31:55,665 --> 01:31:58,442
He was supposed to lift us out
if things got hot...

1270
01:31:58,601 --> 01:32:00,042
and he left us.

1271
01:32:01,170 --> 01:32:02,825
He just flew away.

1272
01:32:03,773 --> 01:32:05,117
Dios mio.

1273
01:32:05,141 --> 01:32:07,575
My friend, my spotter...

1274
01:32:08,111 --> 01:32:09,640
was killed right away.

1275
01:32:10,613 --> 01:32:14,039
And then I was shot, kicked...

1276
01:32:14,384 --> 01:32:16,290
stabbed with bayonets...

1277
01:32:17,387 --> 01:32:19,298
and that guy in the chopper--

1278
01:32:19,322 --> 01:32:20,640
Reese--

1279
01:32:23,726 --> 01:32:25,152
watched it all...

1280
01:32:25,762 --> 01:32:28,302
and didn't do a goddamn thing.

1281
01:32:29,065 --> 01:32:30,577
What happened?

1282
01:32:33,102 --> 01:32:35,227
I was dragged away...

1283
01:32:35,672 --> 01:32:37,078
and tortured.

1284
01:32:39,075 --> 01:32:41,053
The only thing
that kept me alive...

1285
01:32:41,077 --> 01:32:43,110
was hating that fucker Reese.

1286
01:32:44,314 --> 01:32:46,861
I wanted to live
just to get him.

1287
01:32:47,550 --> 01:32:48,954
Dios castiga.

1288
01:32:50,853 --> 01:32:54,455
I’m sure God punished him
long before you killed him.

1289
01:32:54,724 --> 01:32:56,229
Not enough.

1290
01:32:57,839 --> 01:33:00,140
I got away, escaped.

1291
01:33:01,217 --> 01:33:02,975
Floated down...

1292
01:33:02,999 --> 01:33:04,717
some river to Thailand.

1293
01:33:06,936 --> 01:33:10,467
And after they patched me up
and I got out of the hospital...

1294
01:33:10,974 --> 01:33:14,395
I went to work for the CIA...

1295
01:33:15,144 --> 01:33:19,566
and I never, ever
forgot about Reese.

1296
01:33:22,151 --> 01:33:24,315
But I never saw him again...

1297
01:33:25,822 --> 01:33:28,065
till that day
in Puerto Vallarta.

1298
01:33:31,327 --> 01:33:33,078
The day I met you.

1299
01:33:35,531 --> 01:33:37,711
Do you believe in fate?

1300
01:33:39,469 --> 01:33:41,061
More than that.

1301
01:33:42,438 --> 01:33:44,254
I believe in miracles.

1302
01:33:46,442 --> 01:33:48,454
We're gonna need one
to get out of here alive.

1303
01:33:48,478 --> 01:33:49,886
You know that, don’t you?

1304
01:33:51,114 --> 01:33:52,409
Yes.

1305
01:33:56,152 --> 01:33:57,471
If we do...

1306
01:33:58,588 --> 01:34:00,171
will you come north with me?

1307
01:34:01,958 --> 01:34:04,870
I have a little place
in the hills...

1308
01:34:04,894 --> 01:34:06,171
in Oregon.

1309
01:34:06,195 --> 01:34:08,207
Deep in the woods--

1310
01:34:08,231 --> 01:34:11,716
very quiet, very beautiful.

1311
01:34:12,235 --> 01:34:15,266
It's a good place
to be alone with someone.

1312
01:34:15,505 --> 01:34:17,168
I would like to.

1313
01:34:18,708 --> 01:34:21,556
We will replace
your bad dream...

1314
01:34:21,878 --> 01:34:23,690
with a good one.

1315
01:34:34,891 --> 01:34:37,069
Where are you going?

1316
01:34:37,093 --> 01:34:38,871
I have a plan.

1317
01:34:39,095 --> 01:34:41,504
I don't know if it'll work,
but it's worth a try.

1318
01:34:45,401 --> 01:34:48,428
Why can't we just take 
a bus to the border?

1319
01:34:48,604 --> 01:34:50,615
No, they'll be
looking for me there.

1320
01:34:52,842 --> 01:34:55,014
Here. Put this on.

1321
01:34:58,614 --> 01:35:00,726
To replace the one I messed up
in Puerto Vallarta.

1322
01:35:00,750 --> 01:35:02,901
I saw you looking at it
in a shop window.

1323
01:35:04,487 --> 01:35:05,779
Thank you.

1324
01:35:08,357 --> 01:35:10,072
Back soon.

1325
01:36:15,958 --> 01:36:18,470
Look at what
I’ve been reduced to.

1326
01:36:18,494 --> 01:36:23,052
Following these idiots around
like a perpetual motion machine.

1327
01:36:24,033 --> 01:36:26,145
Pretty hopeless, isn't it, sir?

1328
01:36:26,169 --> 01:36:27,344
Yeah.

1329
01:36:29,672 --> 01:36:31,281
You know,
it's my birthday today.

1330
01:36:32,809 --> 01:36:34,086
Really, sir?

1331
01:36:34,110 --> 01:36:35,854
No, not really.

1332
01:36:35,878 --> 01:36:37,656
In a few months.

1333
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:39,658
But it would bolster
my self-pity...

1334
01:36:39,682 --> 01:36:41,746
and sense of futility
if it were today.

1335
01:36:44,787 --> 01:36:46,120
Yes, sir.

1336
01:36:51,961 --> 01:36:53,539
McGrane.

1337
01:36:53,863 --> 01:36:55,514
It's Price.

1338
01:36:56,032 --> 01:36:57,683
Where the hell are you?

1339
01:36:58,467 --> 01:37:00,145
You first.

1340
01:37:00,169 --> 01:37:03,182
I’m following some Mexican
intelligence wunderkind...

1341
01:37:03,206 --> 01:37:06,451
around the highways and byways
of this dysentery factory...

1342
01:37:06,475 --> 01:37:08,487
trying to find your sorry ass.

1343
01:37:08,511 --> 01:37:10,389
Now, why would you want
to do that?

1344
01:37:10,413 --> 01:37:11,823
So they don't slaughter you.

1345
01:37:13,850 --> 01:37:15,194
Better make sure they do.

1346
01:37:15,218 --> 01:37:16,795
What would be the point of that?

1347
01:37:16,819 --> 01:37:19,198
To eliminate a nasty...

1348
01:37:19,222 --> 01:37:21,834
and potentially
embarrassing problem.

1349
01:37:21,858 --> 01:37:24,703
Best way to do that
is to get you home.

1350
01:37:24,727 --> 01:37:26,972
What about Reese?

1351
01:37:26,996 --> 01:37:28,628
What about him?

1352
01:37:30,867 --> 01:37:32,377
What's the price for that?

1353
01:37:32,401 --> 01:37:34,713
Nothing. It was a mistake.

1354
01:37:34,737 --> 01:37:38,639
You know and they know
I don't make mistakes.

1355
01:37:38,908 --> 01:37:40,853
Officially, it was a mistake.

1356
01:37:40,877 --> 01:37:42,888
You're getting older.

1357
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:44,356
He stepped in your sights.

1358
01:37:44,380 --> 01:37:47,426
- It was a terrible--
- And ironic.

1359
01:37:47,450 --> 01:37:50,191
Yeah, a terrible
and ironic mistake.

1360
01:37:50,453 --> 01:37:51,964
It's more convenient
for everyone...

1361
01:37:51,988 --> 01:37:53,432
if you classify it that way.

1362
01:37:53,456 --> 01:37:56,168
- Why did my ride pull out?
- He panicked.

1363
01:37:56,192 --> 01:37:59,204
- Not your orders?
- No.

1364
01:37:59,228 --> 01:38:01,206
Believe me, we just want
to get you out of here now.

1365
01:38:01,230 --> 01:38:02,912
Tell me where you are.

1366
01:38:10,706 --> 01:38:11,842
Tell me where you are.

1367
01:38:16,112 --> 01:38:18,513
I’m in a little town
called Zapata.

1368
01:38:19,315 --> 01:38:21,460
It’s just north of Rosario.

1369
01:38:21,484 --> 01:38:24,395
Right. Got it.
Where should we meet?

1370
01:38:25,388 --> 01:38:28,022
There's an abandoned church
north of town.

1371
01:38:28,824 --> 01:38:31,370
It shouldn’t take me more than
a few hours to get there.

1372
01:38:31,394 --> 01:38:32,771
I’ll be waiting.

1373
01:38:32,795 --> 01:38:34,046
Goody.

1374
01:38:45,274 --> 01:38:47,119
Thinks he's going home, sir?

1375
01:38:47,143 --> 01:38:48,854
He is...

1376
01:38:48,878 --> 01:38:50,244
in a box.

1377
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:52,840
Hang a "U" at the next curve.

1378
01:38:54,183 --> 01:38:55,489
Yes, sir.

1379
01:39:05,261 --> 01:39:06,661
I’m ready!

1380
01:39:09,765 --> 01:39:11,400
Ready for what?

1381
01:39:14,937 --> 01:39:16,615
Honey.

1382
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:18,132
Surprised?

1383
01:39:19,141 --> 01:39:20,733
I guess you missed the bus.

1384
01:39:23,179 --> 01:39:25,023
I told you
I couldn't leave him alone.

1385
01:39:25,047 --> 01:39:26,959
No, you told me you'd follow me,
remember?

1386
01:39:26,983 --> 01:39:28,860
"Adiós, mivida." All that?

1387
01:39:28,884 --> 01:39:31,330
I waited three hours for you
at the bus station at Mazatlán.

1388
01:39:31,354 --> 01:39:32,798
I’m sorry.

1389
01:39:32,822 --> 01:39:35,367
No. Forget "I'm sorry."
This is bigger than "I'm sorry".

1390
01:39:35,391 --> 01:39:38,303
And I spent the whole night
wondering if he'd killed you...

1391
01:39:38,327 --> 01:39:41,137
or taken you hostage
or raped you.

1392
01:39:42,198 --> 01:39:43,976
Guess he didn't have
to work that hard, huh?

1393
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,493
- Danny--
- What?

1394
01:39:50,806 --> 01:39:52,116
I love him.

1395
01:39:58,681 --> 01:40:01,074
What's the Spanish word
for "psychiatrist"?

1396
01:40:01,217 --> 01:40:03,528
You're with this guy,
this murderer...

1397
01:40:03,552 --> 01:40:04,963
this serial killer
for one night--

1398
01:40:04,987 --> 01:40:08,266
We've been with him
for almost a week now.

1399
01:40:08,290 --> 01:40:11,103
Oh, it's a week.
It's a long-term relationship.

1400
01:40:11,127 --> 01:40:13,705
I guess a girl could fall
for Charles Manson in a week.

1401
01:40:13,729 --> 01:40:15,374
And it was your idea, remember?

1402
01:40:15,398 --> 01:40:16,441
- My idea?
- Yeah.

1403
01:40:16,465 --> 01:40:19,244
That you’d fall for him?
That'd you leave me stranded?

1404
01:40:19,268 --> 01:40:21,213
That you’d fuck him
right under my nose?

1405
01:40:21,237 --> 01:40:22,247
Danny--

1406
01:40:22,271 --> 01:40:24,179
I guess once a whore,
always a whore.

1407
01:40:28,344 --> 01:40:29,812
I’m sorry.

1408
01:40:32,715 --> 01:40:34,559
I’m sorry.

1409
01:40:34,583 --> 01:40:35,935
I didn't mean that.

1410
01:40:36,919 --> 01:40:38,730
It's all right.

1411
01:40:38,754 --> 01:40:40,465
No, it's not all right.
Forget that I said that.

1412
01:40:40,489 --> 01:40:43,156
I just--I didn't know
what happened to you.

1413
01:40:44,126 --> 01:40:45,704
I didn't know why you didn't--

1414
01:40:45,728 --> 01:40:48,371
I thought you would go back...

1415
01:40:50,232 --> 01:40:52,371
forget, be safe.

1416
01:40:52,601 --> 01:40:55,254
Can you forget, Luz?

1417
01:40:57,006 --> 01:40:58,884
Just like that?

1418
01:40:58,908 --> 01:41:00,251
Can you?

1419
01:41:11,153 --> 01:41:13,270
Looks like we could use
a bigger room.

1420
01:41:14,657 --> 01:41:16,334
Yankee Stadium
wouldn't be big enough.

1421
01:41:16,358 --> 01:41:18,403
This is what you’ve been after
from the beginning, isn't it?

1422
01:41:18,427 --> 01:41:19,770
It just happened.

1423
01:41:24,133 --> 01:41:25,577
I think I found a way
out of here.

1424
01:41:25,601 --> 01:41:26,912
There's no way out of here.

1425
01:41:26,936 --> 01:41:29,481
There are cops and the army
in Concordia...

1426
01:41:29,505 --> 01:41:31,716
and on the road in here
to Zapata.

1427
01:41:31,740 --> 01:41:33,618
We got to take that chance.

1428
01:41:33,642 --> 01:41:35,176
She doesn't.

1429
01:41:39,448 --> 01:41:40,738
He's right.

1430
01:41:42,084 --> 01:41:44,129
They’re just looking for me.

1431
01:41:44,153 --> 01:41:47,199
You can tell them I forced you
and Danny to come along.

1432
01:41:47,223 --> 01:41:48,633
They'll believe you.

1433
01:41:48,657 --> 01:41:50,535
They already think
I'm out of control.

1434
01:41:50,559 --> 01:41:52,054
Think?

1435
01:41:56,031 --> 01:41:57,556
Luz...

1436
01:42:04,039 --> 01:42:05,500
Luz, stay.

1437
01:42:09,845 --> 01:42:11,790
Not for me.

1438
01:42:11,814 --> 01:42:13,497
Do it to save your life.

1439
01:42:21,524 --> 01:42:23,533
That's what I'm doing.

1440
01:42:37,473 --> 01:42:38,756
Here.

1441
01:42:45,347 --> 01:42:47,125
What are you doing?

1442
01:42:47,349 --> 01:42:49,294
This'll make it more believable.

1443
01:42:49,318 --> 01:42:50,904
Give us ten minutes.

1444
01:42:52,221 --> 01:42:54,032
Go down to the plaza.

1445
01:42:54,056 --> 01:42:56,123
Make a scene about what I did
to you and Luz.

1446
01:42:56,525 --> 01:42:58,073
That should be easy.

1447
01:42:59,762 --> 01:43:02,874
Your keys,
the rest of the money I owe you.

1448
01:43:02,898 --> 01:43:05,210
- You think I could take that?
- A deal's a deal.

1449
01:43:05,234 --> 01:43:07,885
Yeah, but I never got you there.
Buy your self a nice headstone.

1450
01:43:32,127 --> 01:43:35,106
- Am I going too fast?
- No. Where are we going?

1451
01:43:35,130 --> 01:43:38,204
To a place I found where
the jungle meets the town.

1452
01:43:49,511 --> 01:43:51,215
-Is that it?
- Yeah.

1453
01:43:53,849 --> 01:43:55,894
Someone is going
to meet us there?

1454
01:43:55,918 --> 01:43:57,476
I hope so, Luz. Come on.

1455
01:44:33,589 --> 01:44:35,187
Wait here.

1456
01:44:38,961 --> 01:44:40,287
OK.

1457
01:44:52,308 --> 01:44:53,849
This is a mausoleum.

1458
01:44:57,313 --> 01:45:00,707
Rich people have themselves
buried in the chapel...

1459
01:45:01,650 --> 01:45:03,793
to be closer to God.

1460
01:45:04,119 --> 01:45:05,605
We won't be here long.

1461
01:45:41,724 --> 01:45:43,168
Here we go.

1462
01:45:58,640 --> 01:46:01,224
He's holding her hostage
in the hotel!

1463
01:46:02,277 --> 01:46:03,851
Right up there.

1464
01:46:17,292 --> 01:46:18,703
What's that?

1465
01:46:18,727 --> 01:46:21,365
Our salvation, maybe.
Stay here.

1466
01:46:38,947 --> 01:46:40,441
Is that it, sir?

1467
01:46:41,049 --> 01:46:42,434
Must be.

1468
01:46:44,153 --> 01:46:45,812
And there he is--

1469
01:46:47,923 --> 01:46:49,856
all packaged and ready for us.

1470
01:46:58,467 --> 01:47:01,119
Are you going to try
and talk to him, sir?

1471
01:47:02,104 --> 01:47:05,618
I’ve done all my talking,
and so has he.

1472
01:47:06,008 --> 01:47:07,919
Now it's time
for you to do your work.

1473
01:47:09,545 --> 01:47:10,868
Yes, sir.

1474
01:47:34,169 --> 01:47:36,694
- You with McGrane?
- He's outside.

1475
01:47:40,709 --> 01:47:42,260
Let the girl go first.

1476
01:47:46,815 --> 01:47:48,259
Why?

1477
01:47:48,283 --> 01:47:50,061
Just let her go.

1478
01:47:50,085 --> 01:47:52,418
No. We go together.

1479
01:47:53,455 --> 01:47:55,233
You're going
to push her aside...

1480
01:47:55,257 --> 01:47:57,090
and this'll be over
in two seconds.

1481
01:47:57,359 --> 01:47:58,703
Step aside, Luz.

1482
01:47:58,727 --> 01:48:01,906
No, no. No, I thought
they came to help us.

1483
01:48:01,930 --> 01:48:03,141
Well, they lied to me.

1484
01:48:03,165 --> 01:48:04,776
It doesn't have
to go down like this.

1485
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:07,412
Tell him we got away. We'll take
our chances in the jungle.

1486
01:48:07,436 --> 01:48:09,614
No, no. No, it's over now.

1487
01:48:09,638 --> 01:48:12,550
It's you, or it's both of you.
Now push her aside.

1488
01:48:12,574 --> 01:48:14,552
- Get out of the way, Luz!
- Move her aside!

1489
01:48:14,576 --> 01:48:17,236
Stop! Don't kill him!
No. Please, no.

1490
01:48:25,387 --> 01:48:26,989
They'll lie to you someday.

1491
01:48:29,157 --> 01:48:31,289
When you've done
all their dirty work for them.

1492
01:48:34,663 --> 01:48:37,298
They'll send a younger version
of you to kill you.

1493
01:48:44,673 --> 01:48:46,009
No. Please.

1494
01:49:26,648 --> 01:49:28,265
¡Colonel!

1495
01:49:51,907 --> 01:49:53,656
The girl was with him.

1496
01:49:54,309 --> 01:49:56,220
She was hit
in the line of fire.

1497
01:49:56,778 --> 01:49:58,921
- Did you set the blaze?
- Yes, sir.

1498
01:50:00,216 --> 01:50:01,893
The place is a huge crypt, sir.

1499
01:50:01,917 --> 01:50:03,561
It's filled with bodies.

1500
01:50:03,585 --> 01:50:05,071
Appropriate for Price.

1501
01:50:05,754 --> 01:50:07,465
I thought the fire
would make it impossible...

1502
01:50:07,489 --> 01:50:09,390
to sort out remains...

1503
01:50:10,492 --> 01:50:11,936
to complicate matters...

1504
01:50:11,960 --> 01:50:14,140
in case the locals
decided to investigate.

1505
01:50:15,697 --> 01:50:17,689
I think I underestimated you,
Weatherford.

1506
01:50:18,033 --> 01:50:19,394
Yes, sir.

1507
01:50:22,170 --> 01:50:23,543
I think you did.

1508
01:50:31,213 --> 01:50:32,690
What happened?

1509
01:50:32,714 --> 01:50:34,525
Well, Price is dead.

1510
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:36,810
Gunfire ignited the flames.

1511
01:50:37,085 --> 01:50:38,262
Where's Luz?

1512
01:50:38,286 --> 01:50:40,131
She was caught in the crossfire.

1513
01:50:40,155 --> 01:50:41,466
- No!
- Yes.

1514
01:50:41,490 --> 01:50:42,968
No!

1515
01:50:43,492 --> 01:50:44,936
No!

1516
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:47,171
No! Let go of me!

1517
01:50:47,195 --> 01:50:49,180
It's too late. It's too late.

1518
01:50:49,331 --> 01:50:51,430
You shot her, didn’t you?
You bastards!

1519
01:50:52,234 --> 01:50:54,930
Look, you want to blame someone,
blame Price or yourself...

1520
01:50:55,570 --> 01:50:56,814
or her.

1521
01:50:57,982 --> 01:50:59,751
We're not stupid enough
to think...

1522
01:50:59,775 --> 01:51:01,653
either of you
was completely innocent.

1523
01:51:01,677 --> 01:51:03,981
Now, consider yourself
lucky to be alive.

1524
01:51:09,384 --> 01:51:11,784
Oh, my God! Oh, God!

1525
01:51:16,391 --> 01:51:17,669
Señor.

1526
01:51:19,528 --> 01:51:21,506
All right, now.
Calm down, calm down...

1527
01:51:21,530 --> 01:51:24,087
before the local boys
use you as the scapegoat.

1528
01:51:24,533 --> 01:51:26,177
You'd better get out of here.

1529
01:51:27,335 --> 01:51:29,626
That would end things nice
and neat for you, wouldn't it?

1530
01:51:30,539 --> 01:51:34,427
Son, things always end
nice and neat for me...

1531
01:51:34,543 --> 01:51:36,468
whichever way they go.

1532
01:52:15,117 --> 01:52:16,493
3,000 U.S., right?

1533
01:52:17,586 --> 01:52:19,197
Here's your money.

1534
01:52:19,221 --> 01:52:21,230
- All right, you got it all.
- OK.
