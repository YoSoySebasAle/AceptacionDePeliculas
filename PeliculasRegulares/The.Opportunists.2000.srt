1
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,682
Hey, Dee.

2
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,209
You all set?

3
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,843
Mr Kelly?
Good morning, sister.

4
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,448
Sorry, Dee. Wait a bit longer.
I need to speak to your nephew.


5
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,403
I should take off.
This will just take a moment.

6
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,807
I've got a van triple parked.
Please, sit down.


7
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,121
Your check was returned.

8
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,685
That should not have happened.
I had a setback at work.

9
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,041
I'll get you the money & bring it
over tomorrow.

10
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:50,843
I hope so because we can't keep Dee here
unless you meet your obligations.

11
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,287
This is not the first time this has
happened.

12
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,645
Right. You've been very good.

13
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,089
Are you alright?

14
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,771
What was that about?
It was nothing.

15
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,002
See anything you like?

16
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,129
This is not Victor Kelly's house, is it?

17
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,164
Yeah, when he's here.

18
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,488
Is he here?
- Ahhh, it looks like it, doesn't it?

19
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,167
You gonna let us in then?

20
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,004
I stayed with a friend.

21
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,523
If you were gonna bring him home
you shoulda called me.
No, he's here to see you.

22
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,088
You're Victor Kelly, eh?
Yeah.

23
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,531
I'm your cousin, Michael Kelly.

24
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,042
Is that right?

25
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,451
Yes. Your uncle in Ireland, Frankie,
his son.

26
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,488
Uncle who?

27
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,922
Uncle Frank. Frank Kelly.
Uncle Franco.

28
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,402
I think you've got the wrong place.

29
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,645
He always said to go look up your
Uncle Victor Kelly in New York.

30
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,247
It's a place to stay for a night or two,
a bed.

31
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,804
He made a mistake.

32
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,608
He gave me this exact address, you know.
We're cousins.

33
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,448
He musta took it from the phone book,
'cause I don't know him.

34
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,403
He's a good cook, isn't he?
Yes, he's good.

35
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,324
Well then I'm sorry I bothered you.

36
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,290
You let just anybody walk into the house?

37
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,329
Come on, let's eat.

38
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,682
Dee, do we know anything about an
Uncle Frank in Ireland?

39
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,084
Yes, but I doubt that you or Vic
would.

40
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,041
He was much younger, & your grampa
& him never stayed in touch.

41
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,361
Really?
Why?
Just wondering.

42
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,167
You didn't get very far.
Just on my way.

43
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,530
I'm Miriam, Vic's daughter.
Good to know you.

44
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,126
I'm sorry about that. I apologize.

45
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,126
You're good, your story checks out.
You can come in if you want.

46
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:37,481
No, I wouldn't want to impose.
Then you shoulda written.

47
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,566
This is where I'm staying?
This is it.

48
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,449
I thought you said it was a mobile home.
It used to be.

49
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,921
That's a caravan.

50
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,407
You don't have to stay if you
don't want to.

51
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,246
Don't get me wrong, man.  It's just
an observation I'm making.

52
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,808
Toilet's in there, key's above the door.
keep it locked.

53
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,327
That's about it.

54
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,761
On my way.

55
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,282
You working on Sunday?
Must be strapped.

56
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,925
Wadda you want?
Nothing. I was just passing by &
saw the van & thought I'd, you know.

57
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,769
So?

58
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,805
You give any more thought to that thing
I was talking about?
No.

59
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,841
Don't come 'round here anymore, Pat.
All right, I won't.

60
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,766
Do yourself a favor, Vic, and think
about it.

61
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,288
Tie game, eh?

62
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,601
What have we here?

63
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,647
Two lemons.

64
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:08,164
& a pint of milk, like you requested.
Thank you.

65
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,447
I hope you weren't late this morning.

66
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,491
How long has he been here?

67
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,042
He had one drink.  You all right Vic?

68
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,364
I forgot to give him his check,
that's all.
Ted.

69
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,721
Sorry I'm late.  This one's on me.

70
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,761
I like to miss the traffic on the way back,
you know?
Of course.  You wanna go upstairs?

71
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,487
This job took longer than I thought.
I get paid tomorrow.

72
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,531
You should sell your house.
My kid stays there.

73
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,608
Add 15 bucks for bank charges.
Of course.

74
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,247
She doesn't mind your having a
daughter?

75
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,283
Wadda you mean, Ted?

76
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,524
Here you go.

77
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:41,206
It better be good this time.
Wait a day & it'll be good.


78
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,968
Hey Vic, where you hidin', man?

79
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,487
Arnon, how you doin'?
You still ready to go?

80
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,163
Absolutely, it was done yesterday.
It's got a new carburetor.

81
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,647
Nice paint job.  Looks much better
than it did before.

82
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,601
Should be for what I paid for it.
Thank you.  The receipt's in the
glove compartment.

83
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,842
I'll check it out.
I know that!!

84
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,210
Complete.
I know that.  Go ahead, big guy.

85
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:41,128
It's you.  Classy, tough,
elegant.

86
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,250
I agree with him.
Meet me back at the precinct.

87
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,124
Start 'er up.

88
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,045
Nice work, Vic.
Bon Voyage.

89
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,282
What the fuck!
Get the extinguisher.

90
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,966
What the hell is this?
- No idea.

91
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,681
You shot the engine, you put no oil in it.
Of course I did. I don't know what this is.

92
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,446
I'm not payin' for this.
I wouldn't charge you.

93
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,201
I want my money back.
- Not yet, I got bills too.

94
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,729
I'll take care of this right away.
You'll get your money when this thing
runs right.

95
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,848
We got a problem?

96
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,166
What a joke.
I don't see anything funny.

97
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,723
This is the last time I do charity
Once a fuckup always a fuckup!!!

98
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,164
I don't know. It blew up with him
standing there.

99
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,890
I got $2000 a day for the renovation.

100
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,480
Come on, we can wait, and then you
pay me back when you've got it.

101
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,167
I can't do that.  Some day.

102
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,248
All right.

103
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,686
Met him last night. He's a chip
off the old block.

104
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,644
Can I get a cup of coffee?
We're closed.

105
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,406
Sorry, just one minute with Vic.

106
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:05,600
He told me about that situation with the car
and all, sounds like a hell of a jam.

107
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,766
Listen, if you would just do that thing that
we talked about, which you could do blindfolded
It's like money for free.

108
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,290
I told you not to come around here.

109
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,081
OK, if you want to talk to me, he's got
my number.

110
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,571
Mikey.
- Thank you so much, all right.

111
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,405
Thank you so much for the service.

112
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,920
Your uncle Frank gave me that.

113
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,442
Like he was very proud of him.
Says you're an expert.

114
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:59,162
That's the sort of action that Pat
says is going down again.

115
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,644
And that, my friend, is the sort of action
I'm hunting.

116
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,488
Put it away.

117
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,202
So, is this the cousin I've heard so
much about?

118
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,160
Michael, this is Sally.
- Hello, Sally, nice to meet you.

119
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,120
Hope he's treating you well.
Michael has to take off.

120
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:24,888
You set? I'll walk you out.
- It was nice to meet you.

121
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:42,886
Don't ever talk about that in front of my family
or anybody I care about. OK?


122
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,771
How'd you get mixed up in this?
I talked my way in.

123
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,561
You talked to Pat?
Yes, and I listened to Pat.

124
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,441
Now look, Vic, all you have to do is
sit down with the man.

125
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:59,050
It sounds like a beautiful, sweet little deal,
it's money for free.

126
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,091
Do whatever you want.
So I'll call you about the plan then, eh?

127
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,290
Fuckin' kid, he should have a job.

128
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:19,211
Vic, please take the money and
make me happy.

129
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,931
I'd love to make you happy.

130
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,971
OK, I'm fine.  Don't worry.

131
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,845
All right, it's a hit.

132
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,528
Tony, I want you to bunt.  These guys,
they cannot field.

133
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,324
You're Vic, right?

134
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,371
Listen, here's some banana bread my wife makes
herself.

135
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,320
Jesus, this is Irish Mike, Vic's cousin.

136
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,447
Hey Tony, I told you to bunt, wadda you doin'?

137
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,207
Pat, we'll talk about this?
- Yeah.

138
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,444
Jesus & I met because we work for a
security company.

139
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,211
They have an account with...
...Arthur Cabs.

140
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,765
You know it?

141
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,561
What they do is come in with the cash
every night & put it in the safe...

142
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,008
...and the next day they go & they
deposit it in the bank.

143
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,960
But we work on the Sunday to Monday, the
graveyard shift...

144
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,849
...from midnight to eight.

145
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,201
The boss comes in at 5 AM, goes in the safe
& walks out with 2 big bags of cash.

146
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,842
They're supposed to keep a record of every
deposit, but they're not doin' it...

147
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,164
They're supposed to take that $$ to the bank.
You see he's helping 'em cheat Uncle Sam.

148
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,641
You should tell the IRS.

149
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,885
This asshole, if he loses his $$ he can't
tell anybody.

150
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:10,080
It's just like Robin Hood. They have 100 drivers
out there & you know what they pay 'em? Nothing.

151
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,045
These guys are working like 18 hours a day.

152
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,006
Hey, Kevin.
- You got that VCR for me?

153
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:22,690
I don't have it with me right now, but if you
come by this weekend I'll hook you up.

154
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,889
All right Kevin, I'll see you around.
Kevin, it's very nice to meet you.

155
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:31,604
Friend of mine from high school, last guy
I thought would be a cop.

156
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,401
Jesus, I'm too old to play Robin Hood.

157
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,364
This is for you.

158
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,964
That's $800, that's all we got.
For your expenses, for anything, OK?

159
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,970
I can check it out.

160
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,931
Do you have a jacket & tie?
No.

161
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,368
How much of that money's for me?
None.

162
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,687
How am I going to eat?

163
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,681
OK, what's the plan?

164
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,240
So have you's lived here long?
No.

165
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,007
You move around a bit, eh?
No, I lived with my mom.


166
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,963
Where's she?

167
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,242
So this is Victor's room.

168
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:51,250
Yes, shirt, tie, jacket. Beautiful,
that's very nice.

169
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,769
Do you mind if I have a quick look
at everything?  No, go ahead & play.

170
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,322
Most of the up-to-date stuff's at Sally's.

171
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:04,611
Hey, look at that, beautiful.

172
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,361
What kind of job is it for?
Oh, it's kind of a clerical situation.

173
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:13,208
A clerical situation.?
Administrative, not exactly sure what it is.

174
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,762
But I've gotta look good for the interview.

175
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,561
Could you work in a bookstore?
People are always leaving, I could ask someone.

176
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:26,363
A bookstore?  I'll be  honest with you.
No.

177
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:32,004
No disrespect to ya', but it wouldn't suit,
and Vic set this up.

178
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:37,530
Vic set it up? Yeah, Vic set it up,
and we'll see how that goes first.


179
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:42,368
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna
take the suit. It works very well.

180
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:48,209
I'll just take 1 or 2 of these things here
and these shoes, and I can move forward.

181
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,042
Thanks very much.
I hope it works out for you.

182
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,407
So do I.

183
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:35,050
Hey, I don't know how you feel about this 'cause we're kinda related, but...

184
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,967
...you wouldn't like to go out on a date
sometime would you?

185
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,970
You're my father's cousin, it's not
a crime.

186
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,128
So that's a 'yes' then, is it?

187
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,850
Maybe.

188
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,006
Don't wait too long though, alright?

189
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,929
Drive slowly.

190
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,004
If you wanna drive, just tell me.

191
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,127
Open the door for me.

192
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,966
What?
You're supposed to be my driver. Open the door.

193
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,929
Wait here.

194
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,404
Mr Langston?

195
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,484
You're a little early. Mr Ransome will
be here in a minute, though.

196
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,807
I need to make a call.

197
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,610
You wanna use my phone?

198
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,487
I need to call my wife. My kid is sick, so
it's private.

199
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,644
You wanna use his office?

200
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,450
Mr Langston is in there.

201
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,729
Gladys, just don't let anyone in my office.

202
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,406
But he had to make a call.
Just go back to your desk.

203
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,525
Mr Langston.

204
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,691
Hope you haven't been waiting long.
No.  Thanks for the phone.

205
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,649
No big deal.

206
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:37,283
You're a fan I see.
Yeah, I used to be. It's not the same anymore.

207
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,808
You've got a signed Campinella.
I'm jealous.

208
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,964
I had to pay for it.
I imagine.

209
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:49,411
So on the phone you said you were opening
a liquor warehouse?

210
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:55,647
Off the expressway at Flushing. We do business
with hotels, bars, restaurants.

211
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,641
Cash only, so we need somebody with a state
license to make deposits

212
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:06,201
I'm flattered you chose us.
Could I take a look at the place, it would help me.

213
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:10,445
We're a small operation. There's
not that much to see.

214
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,763
I got 4 trucks, all maintained.

215
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,930
I got 2 guards on duty 24 hours here.

216
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,051
They're in direct contact with our guys
on the road.

217
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,289
Duffy, get a haircut. I'm not gonna
tell you again.

218
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,920
So, that's about it.

219
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:35,449
We have great insurance. You have
nothing to worry about.

220
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,924
Where do you lock it up?
In a save, in a secure room, down there.

221
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,763
Could I take a look?

222
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,641
Yeah, sure.

223
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:59,963
Mr Langston, the law says I gotta report
everything we carry

224
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,805
right down to the bank deposit slips.

225
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,681
But with cash...

226
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,811
...it's sometimes hard to be exact.

227
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,687
This is quite something.

228
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,040
I'm the only one who knows the combination
that has access to the vault.

229
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:29,842
I had an alarm wired in to keep it up to date.

230
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,843
Look, I don't wanna be rude, but I'm
expecting a phone call.

231
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,561
We're putting a sun room in...

232
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,886
...and the builder's giving me grief.

233
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,281
What are we doing?
Stay here.

234
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,924
Mort, open up.

235
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,766
Wait in the car.
- No, I'm in on this.

236
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,483
It's Vic Kelly.

237
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,209
That's Michael.

238
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:54,481
I need your help.
How can I help Mr. Goodwrench?

239
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,962
I need some Plessey combinations to
practice on.

240
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:07,486
I have some tea bags, you want a cup?
No thanks, I have to take back the rental car.

241
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,564
Stay

242
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,367
Can  you make a copy of that?
Why?

243
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,808
I think it's the key to a vault gate.

244
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,050
Take it to the locksmith uptown. It's to
somebody's front door.

245
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,168
Forget that.

246
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,445
Would you put that down!

247
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,723
What about the locks?

248
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,526
Depends on what you're offering.

249
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:51,369
I can give you 500. It's all I have.
Or something from the take.

250
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:56,845
What model Plessey is it?
Big, 30 something years, it's got 3 locks.

251
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,164
That's the Imperial. In that case,
I should take this.

252
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,084
It'll be a couple of days.

253
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,806
Go home & visit your family, OK?

254
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,571
We're closing.
Hi, is Vic in?

255
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,691
I need to talk to him, just one minute.
Yeah, alright, come in.

256
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:34,081
Ted, what's going on?
- $1600 in unpaid rent.

257
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,960
I had a setback at work.
So I heard.

258
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,890
Nothing like word of mouth for business.

259
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,840
Ted, when have you spent a dime on the place?

260
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,686
You can get in line like everybody else
or I could write you a check.

261
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:58,882
That's funny Vic. Look, you pay by the
weekend or I'm putting your stuff out
and getting another tenant.

262
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,644
Really?
That's a fact.

263
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,804
Well, have a nice day.

264
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,601
He's a total loser.

265
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:16,683
He owes money everywhere.
Get yourself a nice guy. Goodnight.

266
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,440
Vic, will you stop being such an idiot and
take the money, for god sakes?

267
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,127
I told you I'm not going to do that.
Why not? What's wrong with it?

268
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:38,444
Not a thing.
You can't just let everything fall apart.

269
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,171
I don't see it. What's falling apart?

270
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:49,211
Well maybe you should stay at your
place for a while.

271
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:56,485
What do you mean?
Well you got some kind of scheme, don't you?

272
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,530
No.
Well there are people who rely on you.

273
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,322
And you've been a regular citizen for a while
now and we all got used to you being around.

274
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,927
The regular citizen thing is not 
going too good.

275
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,407
Get out.

276
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,727
You mean that?

277
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,530
I'm not gettin' on a bus to go visit
you upstate.

278
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,324
You gonna be that way?
Yes.

279
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:31,367
Then I'll come back tomorrow, I'll get my
stuff, & I am out the door.

280
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,847
And leave the keys.

281
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,930
Fine.

282
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,404
Do you know what to do?
Yeah.

283
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:25,124
I go downstairs, find the key, make an imprint,
come back to the van and blink.


284
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,449
Twice.
Yeah, twice is what I meant.

285
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:32,764
You go upstairs, and if you find it
you come down to me.

286
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:39,246
Relax.  This is easy.
Yeah, let's start.

287
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:51,602
Sweetheart.
What.

288
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,525
Go take care of the dog.

289
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,487
Oooohhhh! What is it?

290
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:12,362
Wadda you got?  Good Boy. Come here.

291
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,648
Good boy, wadda you got? 

292
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,691
It's nothing, Honey. It's a car, that's all.
How'd you get out?

293
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:28,606
You know, Michael, I'm startin' to think
there's something wrong with you.

294
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,450
Mort, it's Vic.

295
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,760
You can't come in. I'm finishing some
business.

296
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,642
That's OK. I need this made. It's the key
I was talking about.

297
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,203
Yeah, meet me at Kent's in an hour.
I'll bring it with me.

298
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:18,083
You should eat.
No, just coffee's fine.

299
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,804
So the last time you did this you got caught?

300
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,885
What happened?
You got the clipping. What's it say?

301
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,520
But what happened to the money?

302
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:40,321
I gave it back. I turned myself in.

303
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,283
No, seriously, what happened to it?

304
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:46,081
My wife, when she found out what I'd done,
took the kid & cleared out, so

305
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:51,002
I had the money but noone to spend it on,
so I gave it back.

306
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,923
I haven't seen my daughter for 8 1/2 years.

307
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:00,881
It woulda been more if I hadn't done
what I did.

308
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:06,206
I got a reduced sentence, I did my time
& now I fuck up cars.

309
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:21,531
I can appreciated the reasons.
Money isn't everything.

310
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,401
Mort, right on time.
Yeah, how ya' doin'?

311
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,601
It's in there.

312
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,161
How's he doing?
Who?

313
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,807
Him.
Him?

314
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,443
I just hope he doesn't blow it for you,
that's all.

315
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,089
Mort, what're you worrying for?

316
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,602
Me, I got nothin' to worry about.

317
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,570
I'll have it set up for you in a
couple of hours.

318
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,847
I'd stay & chat but I have to go.

319
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:31,051
You go left past zero 4 times,
the first click here is the first number.

320
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,524
Go right past zero 3 times,
click here is your 2nd number. 

321
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,445
You get the routine? It's 3 numbers
for each of the cylinders.

322
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:44,170
The alarm should give you 6 minutes to get
all 9 numbers. After that, if go past that

323
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:47,961
The alarm locks you in the building
and calls the precinct.

324
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,044
So are you ready Vic?

325
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,210
You're on.

326
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,404
41.

327
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,289
53.

328
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,009
Time's up.


329
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:56,445
You got 2 right, which means you got
7 wrong.

330
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:00,608
You know I think we could try to be
a little bit more positive.

331
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:05,891
I coach little league, and we like to look
at the glass half full, not half empty.

332
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:09,487
So you're a family man?
That's right, a wife and two kids.

333
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:13,286
So what happens to your happy brood if you
go to state for a few years?

334
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:16,962
Minimum wage it's pretty hard to keep a
roof over their head, you know.

335
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,964
So there's not a lot to cheer about,
right coach?

336
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,929
So why don't you sit the fuck down.

337
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,250
27.

338
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,769
Time's up.

339
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,448
How'd I do?

340
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:19,763
Not too bad.

341
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,811
Not bad.
Not bad, what? How'd I do?

342
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,491
You got 4.

343
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,166
OK, less than half.

344
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,845
Not too bad.

345
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,289
Do it again. Set it up.

346
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,769
33.

347
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,048
How'd you do?

348
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,525
5 minutes & 42 seconds.

349
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,001
I think we should just get out of this.
No, let's not.  Wait.

350
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,845
He was getting better.
Let's just get out of this.

351
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,764
Calm down.
I'm calm.

352
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:46,005
Just tell him, 'cause he's your friend.
He's a nice guy...

353
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,731
Just tell him.
No, it was clear...Vic.

354
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:55,971
Vic, should we still be confident? Cause those
numbers were taking, no offense, a long time.

355
00:47:56,120 --> 00:48:00,603
You're still the coach, you know...
What time's your shift tomorrow?

356
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,970
Midnight, we begin.
We'll be outside.

357
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,968
Body of Christ?

358
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,327
Mr Kelly, you're early today.

359
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:36,769
For once. I apologize for not coming
when I said I would.

360
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:41,608
That's all right, I really didn't expect it.
Would you like to take a seat?

361
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:54,884
We're going to move Dee tomorrow to a
geriatric hospital in Staten Island.

362
00:48:55,040 --> 00:49:00,809
She'll be well taken care of, there'll be visiting
hours & if you wanna take her out for the day you
can make arrangements.

363
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:06,006
It could be I can straighten this out by tomorrow.

364
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,842
We'll keep our fingers crossed.

365
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:13,203
If there's a room open we'll be happy
to take her back.

366
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,609
Would you like to come inside?
No, thanks.

367
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,362
You're up early.

368
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:55,567
I just went to get some breakfast.
Oh, too bad, I got you some.

369
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:01,285
I'm accepting your invitation.

370
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,569
You wanna go to the cemetery?

371
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:09,328
Wadda ya' like....Why?
'Cause it's beautiful.


372
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,848
Why isn't Miriam here?
She's late.


373
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,327
You can eat that.

374
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,007
You help me because you think it
makes you feel better.

375
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,925
Paying your pennance.

376
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:32,451
I'd like to go to Staten Island.

377
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,843
I haven't been there since my friend
Maureen eloped.

378
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,684
You told me that.

379
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:41,640
Thai's from a box. I didn't have
time to cook.

380
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,645
She'll be here when she gets here.

381
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:53,126
So wadda you think?

382
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:00,928
Yeah, big. A big graveyard.

383
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:06,049
Did you think we were living in a big house
with lots of money?

384
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:10,330
Miriam, you're standing on the graves.
There we are, get on the path.

385
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,051
Did you?
What?

386
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,885
Think we were living in a big house
with lots of money?

387
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,048
Wadda you mean?

388
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:23,124
I don't think you're even close to
being related to us.

389
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,485
I found it on the counter in your
little trailer.

390
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,361
Michael Lawler.
At least you kept your first name.

391
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,807
Nice picture.

392
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,406
Give it back. Give it.

393
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:53,727
I know your uncle Frank, all right?

394
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,369
I grew up next door to him.

395
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:00,241
Well I don't think that counts as
being related.

396
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:12,004
I've known Frank all my life.

397
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:17,968
& he used to tell me about Victor Kelly
over in New York.

398
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:24,401
Built him up as this kind of big-time
safe-crackin' gangster, good fella.

399
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,723
And you believed him?
Yeah.


400
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:32,924
I wanted to believe it.
Then you musta been disappointed.

401
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:38,325
I was. Bitterly disappointed.

402
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,569
But I've nowhere else to go, Miriam.

403
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,643
You're not gonna tell him, are you?

404
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:54,001
I mean don't tell him 'till after I hear about
this job. He's been very good to me.

405
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:00,044
We'll see.

406
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,322
I gotta go to lunch.

407
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:33,043
So what happened to Sally?

408
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,368
I liked it better living here
by myself.

409
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:43,004
It'll be OK. Dee has to move to some kind
of hospital.

410
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:46,323
It could be, if I'm not picked, take care
of her for a while.

411
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:50,451
Why, what's wrong?
I dunno, she doesn't wanna be with the nuns
anymore, I guess.


412
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:55,049
She doesn't wanna be anywhere.
That' it, she has to move.

413
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:04,128
OK. What's the matter with you?
Nothing.

414
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,962
Fit as a fiddle.

415
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,329
You keep an eye on her, OK?

416
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,491
How ya' doin'?
Hey man, what's up?

417
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:59,361
So the trip went ok with Arthurs?
Yeah, fine. Everything went well.

418
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,410
When you gonna get rid of these?
These VCRs?

419
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,841
If I sell those, that all right?

420
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,321
I guess so.

421
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:10,404
Have a good shift.

422
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,203
Party time.

423
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,568
Don't piss off any dogs.

424
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,528
Why'd you ask about the truck?

425
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,570
I ask him that every week.
Every week--I'm here every week.

426
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:48,364
You don't listen.
Relax, all right? Just gotta be cool tonight.
I am being cool.

427
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,809
I ask every week.
Yeah.

428
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,881
How you doing, Vic?

429
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:28,442
So you mind if we watch?
Wadda you want, a box of popcorn?

430
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:33,688
We'll be out here.
Anything you need.

431
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,524
Good luck.

432
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,643
Good old Mort.

433
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,769
All set?

434
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,409
That's it, you're off, 6 minutes.

435
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,648
Keep me on time.

436
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:30,009
18.

437
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,690
26.

438
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,124
31.

439
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,962
You're 12 seconds ahead.

440
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,649
22.

441
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:37,004
Is that a cop?

442
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,123
Yes it is a cop.

443
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:46,129
It's stopped. How'm I doing?

444
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,850
You've only 3 minutes left.

445
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:56,731
That's your friend, that's that guy.
- Kevin.

446
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,689
What's he doing here?

447
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:02,242
He wants a VCR, that's all.

448
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:08,885
It's all right, it's not a big deal,
all right? I'll just give him a VCR.

449
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:15,204
No big problem, I'll give him one of these.
Hurry up, let's get outta here, don't talk
to this guy!

450
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,921
It's about time.

451
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:21,970
You can pay me later, OK.
Watch it, it's fragile.

452
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:26,170
What's wrong with you, what's the matter
with you? Wait.

453
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:33,365
My partner wants one too.

454
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,610
52.

455
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:39,484
One more minute left there, Vic.

456
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:53,769
4.

457
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:57,650
40 seconds.
Quiet!

458
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,690
It's Hi-Fi, yes. Surround sound.

459
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:03,644
With 4 heads?

460
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,570
OK, let me have one of those.
OK, great, just wait right here &
I'll get you one.

461
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,563
I'll go with you.
Bull shit, man!!

462
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:16,088
My boss is here, know what I mean?
Want me to get fired?

463
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:19,249
All right, so just stay here.

464
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:23,371
10 seconds.

465
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,727
Quiet.

466
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,528
That's it, Vic, we're fucked.

467
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:50,169
You did it. Beautiful.
You sound surprised.

468
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,048
Sweet Jesus, look at this.

469
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:36,969
Who'd have thought that fucking up a
car could lead to this?

470
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:45,120
Who'd have thought that fucking up your
Buick woulda led to this?

471
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:49,804
What do you mean?

472
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:55,247
Now relax, Vic, alright? Keep it down.
I did not....

473
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:59,968
It was Pat. I caught him fucking around
with the Riviera.

474
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:04,768
He said it would force you into doin' this,
and he cut me in to keep me quiet.

475
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:08,208
But the beautiful thing is, it worked.

476
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:11,605
Look at this. It's beautiful.

477
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,362
Open the door.

478
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:28,244
Smart guy, tough guy.

479
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:37,124
Hey look, there's gotta be a way out.

480
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:39,801
Now look, here's the button.
NO, DON'T!!!!!

481
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:51,321
I'm coming back. I'll be back!!

482
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:27,610
Mr Ransome? I called your home.
Your wife said you were on your way down.

483
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,888
I'm afraid there's been an attempted robbery.

484
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:35,046
Looks like one of the suspects locked himself
inside your vault. Gotta key?
Yes, yeah.

485
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:43,606
You just pull inside. My partner will be
right with you.

486
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:09,320
Thanks. We'll try not to keep you any longer
than we have to.
OK, thanks.

487
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:16,444
Watch your head.

488
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,207
Mr Ransome?
Yeah, hi.

489
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:04,722
You were supposed to wait outside.
Yeah, I was looking for yesterday's delivery reports.

490
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:09,124
Yeah, well technically this is still a crime scene.
Yeah, I got it.

491
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:14,888
Wanna go see if anything's missing?
That's why I'm here.

492
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,771
Single, Florida Express.

493
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:28,250
Attn, passengers, the 8:14 Fla. Express is
now boarding at gate 3. 

494
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:33,123
Washington, Richmond, Charlotte,
Charleston, Atlanta, West Palm...

495
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:37,604
...Ft Lauderdale, Boca Raton
& Miami now boarding at gate 3.

496
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:41,560
Please have your tickets ready
for the driver.

497
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:33,842
Hi dad. The detective says they're gonna have
to put a complaint together for the DA, but

498
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:39,848
you can come home until then as long as you report
back here every day until they get a court date.

499
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,848
Is he going to come?

500
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:55,449
They moved Dee, so we gotta pick up your van &
take her stuff over to the new place. OK?

501
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:07,644
Mr Ransome, this is hardly a high-profile case.


502
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,883
Bob. Thanks. I know that.

503
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:16,001
I'm just tryin' to see how I can help
without hurting my business prospects.++--

504
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:18,846
Show them out.

505
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:26,761
You're free to go.

506
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:43,441
Sorry we missed visiting hours. We got held up.

507
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,250
We brought your stuff.

508
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:49,883
She's in a ward. I can't take that, but I
can take some of the books.

509
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,722
Why's she in there, she can walk with a cane.
It's the law, she might fall.

510
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:06,011
I gotta get back before the staff nurse comes.
She's supposed to be taking a nap.

511
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:12,605
We'll come by to see you next week, OK?

512
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,768
Behave yourself.

513
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:08,450
Weren't you supposed to return my keys?
I forgot.

514
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:13,369
You look good. Things are going along
downstairs, I see.

515
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:18,651
We only just started. I heard you were being
held down at the precinct.

516
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,121
They let me go.

517
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:23,405
For how long?

518
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,968
I don't know.

519
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,003
Can I borrow that money?

520
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:35,530
They moved Dee. She won't say it, but I think
she wants to go back with the nuns.

521
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:41,482
I already paid for the renovation. You left
it too late.

522
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:51,207
What I was tryin' to do, pay off some bills,
fix things, 

523
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:56,446
without getting you mixed up in it.
You know what I mean. 

524
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:03,287
No, I don't know what you mean. I thought
we had plans

525
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:09,322
And I don't want to hear it. Don't go blaming
it on me now. You should go.

526
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:15,403
See you.
OK then.

527
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:26,725
See you later, alligator.

528
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:30,403
Go home, Vic.

529
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:19,685
Put that down!

530
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:24,050
Take your hands off that!
I've got to find a new tenant.

531
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:28,922
I told you I move your shit outta here.
You're not going to do this. Take your
hands off that!

532
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:32,209
I'm not foolin' with you.

533
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:36,285
Hey, you're doing this too. Shut your mouth.
We're doing this legally, did you see the sign?

534
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:41,844
If I get 50 bucks for that shit I'll be lucky.
I got to cover my expenses.

Vic, you're such a big loser.
What have I done to you?

[German disrespectful talk]
Hey, don't talk to me like that.


538
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:53,609
Let's go.

539
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:58,963
Let's get out of here. We finish this tomorrow.
And get off my property!!

540
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:15,368
Jesus, look at you.

541
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:22,882
I was...I went down to Sally and....

542
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:34,847
Is that for me, is it...?
You're on the list.

543
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:43,888
I'm not exactly popular around here any more, am I?
You got it, BINGO.

544
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:56,005
What's up? Got nobody to spend it on?

545
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:04,405
I shaved a little bit off for meself.

546
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,480
Money isn't everything.

547
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:23,885
Here, Cecil. Two sugars.

548
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:26,842
Dad, you want some?

549
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:30,680
Come on, back it up.
I am backing up.

550
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:35,688
Relax.

551
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,802
Hey Vic, what's going on?

552
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:45,126
Can we take it inside? You might like it.

553
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:48,048
Yeah, whatever.

554
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,410
What is it?

555
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:01,491
If it's not what you're looking for,
I'll take it away.

556
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:07,569
How do you know what I'm looking for?
I should know, right?
Yes.

557
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:17,761
Vic, it's...
It's vintage, and it works.

558
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:25,851
It needs some records, but I can fix that.

559
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:35,127
It's nice.

560
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:39,285
Something to keep me company while you're
locked up.

561
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:41,010
That's thoughtful.

562
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:47,485
If you want, I could get a brush and help out
until they come and get me.

563
01:16:56,320 --> 01:17:02,646
I'll go upstairs...slip into something
more comfortable. I'll be right back.

564
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:10,290
I'll bet you like the Mets, uh?
Ehhhh, they're OK.

565
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,084
Two dollars.

566
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,970
Thanks.
Bye.

567
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:24,169
Hi, what can I get you?
I'd like an orange and, uh, a coconut.


568
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:31,051
OK, two dollars.

569
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:35,967
And this is for you.
For me?
Yeah, it's from some old friends.

570
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:51,563
Your highness.

571
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:56,240
What time are we expected at Sally's
big party?

572
01:17:56,440 --> 01:18:01,048
Who says you're invited?
I think I've got a little special thing
to wear.

573
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:07,401
Come on, cuddly toys, stuffed animals, pink
pandas, 2 for $25, come on.

574
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:12,041
I'm not going to say thank you
if that's what you're waiting for. 

575
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:15,886
If you want, I could take you back
to Staten Island.

576
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:20,881
King of the jungle, big pandas, cheaper
here, 2 for $25. 

577
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:25,081
What's that?
Showing charity.

578
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:36,282
Knowing Vic, it'll probably explode.
It's going to work.

579
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:40,605
See wise guy? There. Like poetry.

580
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,482
Hey Vic, these are thristy people.

581
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:53,811
I remember that Frank always had a sunny
disposition. Is he still...?

582
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:55,564
He had what?

583
01:18:55,720 --> 01:19:00,009
The hubcaps are an interesting touch.
Do you like 'em? They were Vic's.

584
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,368
Go get him.

585
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:49,210
You need to come with us.

586
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:55,287
I'll give you a couple of minutes.

587
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:10,923
You going to call me?

588
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,128
You'll call.
Yeah.

589
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:49,244
Where the hell is my Buick?

590
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:55,921
It's in the back of my house.

591
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:12,366
There you go. The keys. You can start it.

592
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:34,762
Aaaahh, don't worry about it.

593
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:37,163
Take it!

594
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:41,850
Cop: I don't want to know.
Vic: What about my case?


595
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:48,365
For some strange reason the guy you tried to rob
doesn't want to press charges.

596
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:52,605
You lucked out for once.
That's good.
