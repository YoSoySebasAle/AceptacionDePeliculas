1
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:18,215
(Jaunty, upbeat music)

2
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:20,980
(Dog barking)

3
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:42,170
Cat burglar workin'
the neighbourhood

4
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:45,311
and we're out bustin'
a goddamned bookstore.

5
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,674
This won't take very long.

6
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:53,819
(Dramatic music)

7
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:01,755
(Credits accompanied
by ticking sound)

8
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,389
(Woman)
What time is the programme tonight?

9
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:39,788
(Man)
Uh, eight o'clock, I think.

10
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,558
Well, what time are you
going to get through here?

11
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:42,792
(Man)
Six at the latest.

12
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,133
I wonder if you could help me out.

13
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:49,867
I'm looking for a book that's,
uh, a little unusual.

14
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:52,739
You know, something you wouldn't
find in an ordinary library?

15
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:56,871
- Uh-huh.
- You, uh, you got any suggestions?

16
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,573
Just look around
for yourself, mister.

17
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:00,810
The jackets tell
the story pretty well.

18
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:03,218
Yeah, I see what you mean.

19
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:06,920
Maybe you got something that's
brand new, that's just come out?

20
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,390
What about that stack of books
in the window?

21
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:12,658
- The Gummer Goose book?
- N0, no, no, the other one there.

22
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,400
Ah, this one here.

23
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,126
<i>Oh yeah, The Seven Minutes.</i>

24
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,072
- It's a pretty sexy cover, isn't it?
- Yeah.

25
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,112
- See you, Ben.
- Eight o'clock.

26
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:30,744
- You read it?
- The new edition, at least.

27
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:33,416
<i>The first one was banned
35 years ago.</i>

28
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:36,347
<i>- How come it was banned?
- Because it was considered obscene.</i>

29
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:37,751
Do you think the book's obscene?

30
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:39,948
Why don't you buy the book
and find out for yourself?

31
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:41,855
- How much is it?
- $7.30 with the tax.

32
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,791
Wrap it up.
You the manager round here?

33
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,358
Yeah, the day manager.

34
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,296
Who do I bring it back to
if I don't like it?

35
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,436
Fremont.
Ben Fremont.

36
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:54,466
(Emphatic orchestral chord)

37
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,508
Took you long enough.

38
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,671
Literary conversations
take a little doing.

39
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:05,612
We'd better start comparing.
Come and join me in the front seat.

40
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:16,056
- Same jacket, same title.
- Check.

41
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:19,995
Same publisher, same
publishing date and copyright.

42
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:25,126
- Check.
- Let's pay Mr Fremont another visit.

43
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:30,138
(Suspenseful music,
against ticking clock)

44
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:34,641
(Dramatic orchestral chord)

45
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:39,310
(Police officer)
Mr Fremont?

46
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:42,386
You are Ben Fremont,
manager of the Argus Book Store?

47
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,419
You're puttin' me on.

48
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,922
Mr Fremont, I'd better
introduce myself officially.

49
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,918
I'm Sergeant Kellog,

50
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:50,358
assigned to the Vice Bureau
of the County Sheriff's office.

51
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,157
I knew you seemed weird.

52
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,500
My partner here
is Officer lverson.

53
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:57,227
Mr Fremont, we're
placing you under arrest

54
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,372
under Section 311.2
of the California Penal Code.

55
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:01,835
What the hell for?

56
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:05,239
The Code states that any person
who knowingly offers to distribute

57
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,743
any obscene matter
is guilty of a misdemeanour.

58
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,109
The District Attorney feels that
the book The Seven Minutes,

59
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:14,117
by J.J. Jadway, would be found
obscene if taken to court.

60
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:17,848
You can't arrest me.
I'm just a guy who sells books.

61
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:22,622
- Ijust work here.
- (Dramatic orchestral chord)

62
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:26,793
(Telephone ringing)

63
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:33,635
(Lyrical, Gershwinesque tune)

64
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,267
(Telephone ringing)

65
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:55,386
(Slapping sound)

66
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:57,756
<i>Mike? It's Phil. Sanford.</i>

67
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:00,261
Phil? How the hell are ya?

68
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:01,991
Well, I'll tell you about that
in a minute.

69
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,567
Oh, uh...
congratulations are in order.

70
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,405
I read that you took over
your dad's publishing firm.

71
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,666
- It's been a year and a half now.
- You sound uptight, man.

72
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:12,743
The police raided the
Argus Book Store in Oakwood...

73
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:15,140
Yeah, I know the store,
but what's that got to do with you?

74
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,111
<i>They arrested the clerk,</i>

75
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,012
Ben Fremont,
on an obscenity charge,

76
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:22,450
for selling a new book of ours,
The Seven Minutes, by J.J. Jadway.

77
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:26,080
Now Mike?
This book is not pornographic.

78
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,591
Anyway, FremonFs been in jail
several hours now,

79
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,854
- and I want him bailed out at once.
- How do you want to plead?

80
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,827
If he pleads not guilty,
that means a trial.

81
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,160
I want to get him out of this
fast and quietly.

82
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,426
<i>Ihave got to put</i> a <i>stop to</i>

83
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,695
the little nuisance arrests like this
right at the outset.

84
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:42,032
Well, now, selling pornography
in California is a misdemeanour.

85
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,644
As far as I recall, it's a
maximum fine of $10,000,

86
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:47,973
<i>a year in jail, plus $5</i>

87
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,980
for every unit of
obscene material confiscated.

88
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:54,880
Mike, but the kid was arrested
once before on the same charge.

89
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,987
Ah, excuse me, Phil.

90
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:04,219
Let me see... that's a felony,
now that's a $25,000 maximum fine,

91
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:07,366
just for openers,
and a year in prison.

92
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,127
<i>Damn it, Mike, I can't let
Fremont go to jail</i>

93
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:12,065
<i>for selling Sanford House's book!</i>

94
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:14,502
Wait a minute...
there's one other possibility.

95
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:18,040
I might be able to get the whole thing
taken care of quickly and quietly.

96
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:21,669
We enter a nolo plea,
now that's to say a guilty plea

97
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:23,372
without conceding to the charge.

98
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,177
You pay the fine and you arrange

99
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:27,979
<i>to have the
jail sentence suspended.</i>

100
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:30,748
We have a D.A. out here:
a man named Elmo Duncan,

101
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,423
- a very decent guy.
- Mike...

102
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,423
(Mike) Don't worry.
I'll see Duncan tomorrow,

103
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:35,686
<i>arrange for the bail bondsman</i>

104
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:37,090
and look in on Fremont.

105
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:38,594
Sorry I unloaded on you, buddy,

106
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:41,165
but I'm sure you know that this
is pretty important to me.

107
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,062
Get some sleep, huh?
Good night, Phil.

108
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:47,563
(Laughing) You're bad!
You're really bad, baby!

109
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,932
Faye!

110
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:55,609
Faye... Faye!

111
00:06:55,782 --> 00:07:01,618
Come on now, it's after midnight.
You know, we're both tired.

112
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,690
And you know how I hate
being interrupted.

113
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:08,588
Michael, Daddy isn't going to
like your dirty book.

114
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,956
When I go to work for Daddy,

115
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:15,730
that's when Daddy makes the decisions.
Until then, I call my own shots.

116
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:17,959
(Raunchy big-band music)

117
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,470
C'mon.

118
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:30,444
Daddy was discussing
us today, Michael.

119
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:32,817
He's anxious to know
when you're going to

120
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:35,612
make an honest woman
out of his daughter.

121
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:39,450
I've got the message,
Miss Osborn.

122
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:42,583
- How is your charming fiancée?
- She's fine, sir.

123
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:45,754
You must remember me to both Faye
and your prospective father-in-law.

124
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:47,991
You know, if it weren't for
Willard Osb0rn's dinner parties...

125
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,426
I wouldn't have to worry
about my weight.

126
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,434
What can I do for you,
Mr Barrett?

127
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:55,570
Well, sir, I'm looking for a favour.

128
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:59,909
Anything.
Anything within reason.

129
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,742
I'm representing the Sanford House
of New York City.

130
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,248
The publisher of The Seven Minutes.

131
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:13,019
The Seven Minutes...
Oh yes, the Fremont case.

132
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,248
(Mike)
That's rig ht.

133
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:18,088
Mr Duncan, may I ask...
have you read the book?

134
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:20,630
To be quite frank about it, no.

135
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,927
Well, a number of
very important critics say

136
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:25,764
that The Seven Minutes
is not hardcore pornography.

137
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,704
The sort of thing that's
dumped into a drugstore

138
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,673
by quick-buck printers
appealing to the one-armed reader.

139
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,311
The book is being
published by one of

140
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,310
the most reputable firms
in the book trade.

141
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:36,607
Well, let's see what
it's all about.

142
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:47,020
The complaint was filed
by a Mrs Olivia St. Clair,

143
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:50,191
President of the Strength
Through Decency League in Oakwood.

144
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,121
A couple of my boys read the book.

145
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,730
There is no doubt in their mind
it is pornographic.

146
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:56,499
But the real question is

147
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,069
whether or not The Seven Minutes
is legally obscene

148
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:01,331
by contemporary
community standards.

149
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:03,407
My client has advised me
that the Jadway book

150
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:07,205
is no more or less explicit than
works of far less artistic merit.

151
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,041
S0 why the sudden arrest?

152
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,842
Well, my office has been under
considerable pressure

153
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,349
from Mrs St. Clair,
with some justification.

154
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,577
We had to satisfy her.

155
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,380
And with Fremonfs arrest,
you appeased the book-burner.

156
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:22,421
We've done our duty. But then,
you have a duty to your client.

157
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:23,653
I'm willing to co-operate

158
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,763
within the limitations
of what already has happened.

159
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,763
This would satisfy Sanford:

160
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:30,698
Ben Fremont pleads nolo,
pays a stiff fine,

161
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,202
and in return, we have his
one-yearjail sentence suspended.

162
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:35,340
You understand
entering a nolo plea

163
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:37,169
is tantamount
to pleading guilty?

164
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:39,003
Which means the book
will be banned in Oakwood.

165
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:40,167
I don't give a damn
about Oakwood.

166
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,211
Let it be unavailable there,
and that way you satisfy

167
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,349
the STDL
and their specific community.

168
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,116
<i>But</i> still, <i>The Seven Minutes
could be sold</i>

169
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:48,547
anywhere else in the county.

170
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:49,779
What you've suggested...

171
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,114
well, sounds reasonable to me.

172
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,450
This is a nuisance matter.
We can treat it routinely.

173
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,788
I'll smooth out any ruffled feathers
in the Department

174
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:59,124
and when that's done,
you enter your plea of guilty,

175
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:00,287
and I'll speak to the judge.

176
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:02,866
It probably won't be any more than
a fine and a suspended jail sentence.

177
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:04,297
Fair enough.

178
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,770
I should have something for you
about this time tomorrow.

179
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,071
Oh, by the way,
when you see Willard Osborn,

180
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:10,708
tell him I'm
very appreciative

181
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,276
of the time and attention
his network has given me lately.

182
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,607
(Man) Our next senator
for the state of California!

183
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:16,713
Evening, Luther.
Baby Doll.

184
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,110
- Baby Doll.
- Hi!

185
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:18,978
- Harvey.
- Elmo.

186
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:19,980
In/vin.

187
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:26,286
If our President had looked that good
on television a few years ago,

188
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,552
he would have been elected
Governor instead.

189
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:31,226
Sorry I'm late, Luther.
Things got busy downtown.

190
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,490
(Loud rock'n'roll music)

191
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,324
Shut that thing off!

192
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,829
I've said it before,
and I'll say it again.

193
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:44,641
Before we make our move,
Elmo has got to become

194
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,004
a state-wide hero.

195
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:48,976
If the voters can identify
with him, we're home free.

196
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,342
Two weeks ago, we found
a meaningful issue.

197
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,483
Namely, that much of this
youthful violence

198
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,950
is provoked by salaciousness
in reading matter and in films.

199
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,312
Then, we agreed
to try to implement

200
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,254
the California criminal
code on censorship

201
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:01,688
by making an arrest,

202
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:05,586
thereby using a book as an issue
on which to build a state-wide case

203
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:10,530
- on which Elmo could fight the...
- Smut merchants.

204
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:14,332
Yes. And by this act,
and by the trial that might follow it,

205
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,304
Elmo would become known
as a protector of the young,

206
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:18,272
and an enemy of
violence-inciting literature.

207
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:21,504
That is a lot of crap.
Enough of the pool.

208
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,216
It pits the District Attorney
against some two-bit book salesman

209
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:29,853
and some obscure printed words that
nobody will ever read or hear about.

210
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,786
It should be plain to all of us now
the Fremont rouse was a flop.

211
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,858
Let's forget it,
let's go on to something else

212
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,860
- with a little more promise.
- (Loud crunching)

213
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,827
Baby Doll, will you stop that!

214
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,057
Now there's another
factor involved here.

215
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,325
The publisher of The Seven Minutes

216
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,503
is being represented
by a Mike Barrett.

217
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,501
You might recall
that Barrett is engaged

218
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:48,037
to Willard Osborn's daughter Faye.

219
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,799
Now, considering the support
I've been getting

220
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:51,306
- from Osborn's television network...
- The time will be...

221
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:52,501
- I think it would be foolish...
- ...ten...

222
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,339
<i>- to rock the boat.
- mtwenty-nine and...</i>

223
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:57,011
- Shut that off!
- (Beep, click)

224
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,845
Elmo's right.
Forget about this penny ante stuff.

225
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:03,648
Ourjob tonight is to find
that big issue.

226
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,185
(Rock'n'r0ll music)
Hey baby, now remember...

227
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:08,258
if you just too small,
you ain't tall at all.

228
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:09,655
You remember what
the Wolfman says now,

229
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,762
<i>we got these brand new Wolfman
Jack elevator shoes for you, man,</i>

230
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,901
<i>they're gonna blow your mind,
you're gonna love 'em to death,</i>

231
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:16,693
<i>and remember,</i>

232
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,927
you just slip
right into 'em, man,

233
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:22,199
<i>and listen, if you just can'!
get it on with your old lady now...</i>

234
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:24,604
<i>you pay attention to me.
We've got sizes six</i>

235
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:27,439
to twelve, for those who
are small or large,

236
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:29,342
<i>whatever the case might be</i>

237
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:32,517
<i>we've got the shoes just to fit you,
exactly what you need.</i>

238
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:33,946
You know what I'm talking about!

239
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,054
<i>Now if you want your
Wolfman Jack elevator shoes,</i>

240
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:40,419
<i>just send five dollars,
cash, cheque or money order.</i>

241
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,619
<i>No sticker readers, you want
good cheques, remember that,</i>

242
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:44,888
<i>and you send that to</i>

243
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,394

00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:57,042

247
00:12:57,243 --> 00:13:00,110

00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,247

<i> Love goes in the dark</i>

<i> Touch me an inner spark</i>

<i>-  Chain reaction...

252
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:13,587
<i>Put your right hand
over the radio!</i>

253
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,660
Wolfman Jack, your conductor.
Man, I've got your ticket,

254
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:20,788
<i>and we're gonna ride
that love train. Are you ready?</i>

00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:26,770

<i> Love train </i>

268
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:11,840
You poor bastard stud,

right through your face.

270
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,620

271
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:22,124

(George)
You did nice work, George

279
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,974
Mmm...

280
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,353
Oh, she was outta sight, Jerry!

281
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,819
But you're cool,
I ain't gonna tell nobody.

282
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:55,216
You know my philosophy:
you keep the good thoughts

283
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,055
and then you dump the garbage.

284
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,555
Kinda like your biological
problem with a chick.

285
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:07,365
(Radio volume turned right up,
drowning everything else out)

286
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,708

(Footsteps, insects chirping)

294
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:49,240
Police officers.
Don't move!

295
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,707

296
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:04,295
- D0 you have any identification?
- Yeah.

297
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,825
This what you're
looking for, Griffith?

298
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:14,629
- Where did you find it?
- By the broken body of a young girl.

299
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,602
(Rock'n'r0ll music)

300
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:27,107
Excuse me, sir. Police Chief Patterson
wishes to speak to Mr Duncan.

301
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:29,083
- Let's take it on the speakerphone.
- Yes, sir.

302
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:30,755
Elmo! Patterson.

303
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,358
What is it, Tim?

304
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:37,256
<i>Sorry to bother you, Mr Duncan.</i>

305
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:40,421
<i>About an hour ago

00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:49,863
<i>Frank Griffith's son.</i>

310
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,839
Frank Griffith?
The name means nothing to me.

311
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:55,444
Frank Griffith handles all of
Mr Yerkes' advertising.

312
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:58,208
He's also one of the party's
biggest contributors.

313
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:01,114
<i>That's the one.
The boy denied raping the girl,</i>

314
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:02,776
<i>and he also pleads innocent
to injuring her.</i>

315
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,980
Any evidence to indicate
the boy was lying?

316
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:08,558
<i>L'm gonna look at the sheet.
Wallet, $23 in cash,</i>

a <i>fourth book under

00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:16,065
<i>And coincidentally,
it was the same dirty book</i>

320
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:19,466
<i>involved in that bookseller arrest

Son of a bitch,

00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:24,872

00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,739
<i>Thank you, Mr Duncan.</i>

325
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:28,573
What do you mean,
"we've got our case"?

326
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:31,045
Baby Doll!
Shut off that damn radio!

00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:36,352
Can't the next Senator from the
State of California

329
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:37,853
figure this one out for himself?

330
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:43,484
It's very simple. Frank Griffith's son,
a poor kid with a normal sex urge...

331
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:47,028
...and they're trying to pin him
with breaking and entering.

332
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,062
(Raucous laughter)

333
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,396
- Maybe the kid is innocent?
- Who gives a goddamn?

334
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,038
But you know who's responsible?
The real criminal?

335
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:57,570
It's that dirty, slimy book,
The Seven Minutes

336
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,836
that incited a decent kid
from a good family

337
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,242
- to commit felonious rape.
- Yeah, but Luther...

338
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:06,009
Elmo, we've finally got hold of
the big issue we've been looking for.

339
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,619
- Barman! Get the car!
- Jawohl!

340
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,083
Blair, call Frank Griffith.

341
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:13,881
Tell him we just heard
about his trouble

342
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:16,721
<i>and we're on our way to help him
in any way we can.</i>

343
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:20,194
Now he is still innocent until
proved guilty in a court of law.

344
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:24,199
What I'm really saying is that
the law still gives us certain options.

345
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:26,394
Are you saying he can
still plead not guilty?

346
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,233
Frank, let him finish.

347
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:30,874
If he pleads not guilty

348
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:33,477
the case will be placed
on the court calendar for trial.

349
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:35,112
If he pleads guilty

350
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,215
the sentence could be anywhere
from 15 years to life.

351
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:41,318
What good's all this?
I already told the cops what I did!

352
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,216
- She hurt herself!
- Don't interrupt.

353
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:46,255
I agree that,
as things stand,

354
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:50,293
a not guilty plea would
not only be dishonest but futile.

355
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:53,095
Trial a waste of time.

356
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:58,833
Now consider this. Behind closed doors
our District Attorney could have

357
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:02,599
a great influence with thejudge
who was to pass sentence

358
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:05,299
- after a plea of guilty for rape.
- But I didn't rape her!

359
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,411
The book's the criminal,
not the boy.

360
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,008
If The Seven Minutes
hadn't been available,

361
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:11,809
Jerry would have never
committed the crime.

362
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:13,315
I see.

363
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,647
I see.

364
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:22,119
He was temporarily inflamed by
that book. He was victimised.

365
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:28,163
Now, we'll need time to let this
concept sink into the public mind,

366
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,699
in order to create an atmosphere
much more favourable to Jerry.

367
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,131
Doesn't anything I say
mean a damn?

368
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:35,967
Considering Jerry's condition,
I would offer as a defence

369
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:40,805
that he was not legally sane when
he allegedly committed the crime.

370
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:44,677
To accomplish this, we'll need
the services of a top psychiatrist.

371
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:47,008
I would suggest
Dr Roger Trimble.

372
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,212
I won't let any headshrinker
pick my brain apart! I'm not crazy!

373
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:51,981
Louis Polk knows the law.

374
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:55,024
If he says your seeing a psychiatrist
will help you with thejudge,

375
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,560
it makes sense to do just that.

376
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,559
Jerry!

377
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:02,823
Let your niece calm him down.

378
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:05,196
<i>~</i> Jerry!
<i>'</i> Maggie, l.__

379
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:09,565
I'm sure they were only
trying to be helpful, in their way.

380
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:11,368
I don't want my brain
picked in public.

381
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:17,072
- I understand, Jerry.
- ljust wanna be left alone.

382
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:21,883
Jerry Griffith is living proof that
a dirty book can destroy a clean boy.

383
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,181
I'm convinced we're not dealing
with a mere felony,

384
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,084
but a crime that could
endanger public safety.

385
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,987
Like, uh... an epidemic of rape?

386
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,753
I was referring to
your client's distribution

387
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:33,021
of a menacing work
of obscenity, Mr Barrett.

388
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:34,927
If you plead Ben Fremont
not guilty,

389
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,398
we will prosecute the defendant
to the limit of the law.

390
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,196
If you prefer to enter
a plea of guilty,

391
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,931
the defendant will receive the
maximum punishment for his offence:

392
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:44,098
a fine, and twelve months in jail.

393
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,072
- N0 deal deal, Mr Barrett.
- (Loud clunk of weights)

394
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,042
- ls that your last word?
- Yes, Mr Barrett.

395
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,549
What kind of a plea do you intend
to enten'? Guilty or not guilty?

396
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:55,114
- I'll have to consult with my client.
- There can be no compromise.

397
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:58,790
If you plead guilty, Fremont
will go tojail for a year

398
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:01,721
and the book will be banned
in the county as a starter.

399
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:03,793
If the plea is not guilty...

400
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,791
...you'll have to take
your gamble in court.

401
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:10,264
Really pissed me off
with Duncan's attitude.

402
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,733
Aside from being
obviously hostile,

403
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:15,930
he gave me that politician's
holier-than-thou number.

404
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:21,878
(Mike) A little to the right, honey.
Higher. Yeah, right here.

405
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,773
Mmm, that feels good.

406
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:28,913
- Michael?
- Mmm?

407
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:33,490
Are you considering turning down Dad's
position to take on Sanford's case?

408
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,293
What's wrong, darling?

409
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:43,423
<i>I've got</i> a <i>late date</i>
with <i>The Seven Minutes.</i>

410
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:45,637
I promised Sanford
I'd make my decision

411
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,432
about defending the book
by tomorrow morning.

412
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:54,178
...and, taken in its entirety,
and not out of context...

413
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,177
...the book is definitely
not obscene.

414
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:59,943
The Seven Minutes
is a beautiful book.

415
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,180
Oh, there's Clay Rutherford,
right there.

416
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:04,948
He's one of the most thorough
investigative attorneys I've worked with.

417
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,254
- Mr Rutherford.
- Mr Sanford.

418
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,765
I took the first plane out when Mike
told me you two would take the case.

419
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:17,595
Clay has a line-up of potential witnesses.
Why don't we run through them?

420
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:21,705
- Our line-up is exactly one witness.
- You mean so far?

421
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:24,842
No, Mr Sanford.
I, uh, I mean one. Period.

422
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,137
With the existing political climate
we're not going to find

423
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:28,836
many volunteers for this cause.

424
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:31,445
Tell him who we got, Clay.

425
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:36,211
Christian Leroux. His firm published
the original edition of the book.

426
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:38,822
Now we've been led to believe that
he considered The Seven Minutes

427
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,548
to be a work of artistic integrity.

428
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:44,127
<i>(Sanford) Ireca/I, however, that
he sold the world publishing rights</i>

429
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:47,356
to an alleged pornographer
named Norman C. Quandt.

430
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,898
- (Clay) Any idea of his whereabouts novfi
- (Sanford) N0.

431
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,501
Clay should be able
to get a line on him.

432
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,639
Our really big issue will be
to prove that Jadway wrote the book

433
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:57,639
<i>honestly, sincerely,
and with artistic integrity.</i>

434
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,743
<i>That's why Lemux is so
important to us.</i>

435
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:01,378
- Hello, Mr Barrett.
- Hi, Donna.

436
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:02,808
Mr Rutherford. Sir.

437
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,539
(Clay) We can also get some mileage
out of the findings

438
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:07,480
made by the President's Commission
on Obscenity and Pornography.

439
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:11,315
They clearly verify that so-called
obscene books and motion pictures

440
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:15,392
do not contribute in any way
to an increase in antisocial behaviour

441
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,993
by adults or juveniles.

442
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:23,768
Looks like it's not going to be as
simple as we thought. ls it, Mike?

443
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:27,098
Incredibly, Philip, no. The case is
a lot more complicated now.

444
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:32,938
I guess so. Mike, this might not
be the right time to bring this up...

445
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:34,271
but do you want me to stay
for the trial?

446
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:37,381
I'm up to here with
pre-publication deals back home.

447
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,346
No. As a matter of fact,
it might be better

448
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,952
to keep you out of
the picture entirely,

449
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,417
until we need you
as a witness.

450
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,351
One more thing to remember,
gentlemen,

451
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:48,357
Elmo Duncan will not
be sitting on his ass.

452
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:52,293
Our critics would like to believe
that the Church's only interest

453
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:56,059
is in morality and religion, at
the sacrifice of freedom of speech.

454
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:59,863
We wish to criticise only those
who would abuse this freedom.

455
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:01,596
We are of the same mind,
Your Eminence.

456
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,206
We don't want
a weakened freedom,

457
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:06,276
but rather reinforce it by
penalising those who would corrupt it.

458
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,107
The Church has seen fit
to extend its co-operation.

459
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:12,273
<i>Wewing The Seven Minutes today,
just as it did in the Thirties,</i>

460
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,783
when it was first banned
in the Sacred Index,

461
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,285
as an extraordinary
destructive force.

462
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:18,889
I couldn't be more pleased,
Your Eminence.

463
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,389
I own enlighten,
and will help you.

464
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:24,126
<i>(Mike)
Now, the police report states</i>

465
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,662
that they confiscated eighty copies
of The <i>Seven</i> Minutes...

466
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:31,264
...and the Sanford House
sales department account shows...

467
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:33,994
...they shipped a hundred copies
to this store.

468
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:35,637
- Those figures correct?
- Uh-huh.

469
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:39,509
That means you sold twenty copies
before you were arrested.

470
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:42,306
- Any idea who bought them?
- Zero. I only work here days.

471
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:47,008
Have you seen the picture of
Jerry Griffith in the newspaper?

472
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:48,447
His picture and mine too.

473
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,019
I've got a better shot of him
right here,

474
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:51,951
and I want you to take
a close look at this.

475
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:56,151
- He ever been in this store?
- Not that I can recall.

476
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,187
With all this publicity, I get
phone calls every day,

477
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:00,797
asking ifl have
the book for sale.

478
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:03,463
Even Rachel Hoyt,
the head branch librarian

479
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:05,466
for the Oakwood Library
called this morning,

480
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:08,128
very uptight about this attempt
to ban The <i>Seven</i> Minutes.

481
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:09,797
Interesting.

482
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:11,602
She won't wait to order
the book through channels.

483
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:12,970
She wants to pick one up herself,

484
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:15,305
put it on the open shelves,
and have a showdown

485
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,313
with the old bags who run the
Strength Through Decency League.

486
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:19,814
Would you believe Frank Griffith
telling the press

487
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:22,283
it was J.J. Jadway and
The Seven Minutes,

488
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:25,548
not his son, who was responsible
for Sheri Moore's brutal attack.

489
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:27,191
When was the last time
you saw Jerry?

490
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,623
That was it. He sent a friend
over to return the dictionary.

491
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:31,022
Do you recall his friend?

492
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,960
A long-haired boy. The only one
I saw with Jerry more than once.

493
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:36,066
I think his name was Perkins.

494
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:38,327
I hear you're a good friend
of Jerry Griffith's.

495
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:39,993
Who told you that?

496
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:42,832
Head librarian,
at the Oakwood branch.

497
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:44,498
Said she saw you with him
a couple of times.

498
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:48,009
He's got wheels. He gave me
a lift now and then. That's about it.

499
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:49,703
Well, lwas told that
you were close friends.

500
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,348
You were told wrong, man.

501
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:53,381
Did you ever meet any members
of Jerry's family?

502
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:54,514
Nope.

503
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:56,480
Did you ever hear Jerry
discuss his father?

504
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:57,519
Nope.

505
00:25:57,822 --> 00:25:59,756
When was the last time
you saw him?

506
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:01,756
Maybe a week before
he beat on that chick.

507
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:05,490
- And you haven't seen him since?
- N0. And I wouldn't want to, either.

508
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:07,859
- How come?
- With all the available chicks around here,

509
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:09,432
who wants to owe
the guy who gets it that way?

510
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:11,592
- That's a bummer.
- I hear he reads a lot.

511
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,534
What the hell do these look like?
Everybody reads a lot here.

512
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:15,832
Yeah, I guess you're right,

513
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:18,032
but I'm only interested
in one particular book.

514
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:20,871
Have you ever seen him reading
The Seven Minutes or discussing it?

515
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:26,382
Oh, you're sounding like a pig.
Like a stinkin' pig. Fuck off!

516
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,613
The services of Father Sarsatti,

517
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:36,022
one of the two priests directly
in charge of the Sacred Index,

518
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:38,594
has been offered as a leading
witness for your prosecution.

519
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:43,298
Father Sarsatti
is prepared to make public

520
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:46,904
all the classified information
the Church has on the infamous book

521
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:48,937
and its equally infamous author.

522
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:53,744
Do you wish him as a witness
for the prosecution?

523
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:56,278
Yes, Your Eminence.
I must have him.

524
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:02,785
- When do you want him in here?
- Within three days. Four at the most.

525
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:06,390
I will notify the Vatican.
Father Sarsatti will be here.

526
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:12,389
And the Lord
will bless our cause.

527
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:14,896
(Uplifting, hymn-like music)

528
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:18,235
I'm Olivia St. Clair,
President of the Oakwood Chapter

529
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:20,735
of the Strength Through
Decency League.

530
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:23,339
(Polite applause)

531
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:28,940
<i>Most of you already know
that our President has called for</i>

532
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:33,847
a citizens' crusade against obscenity,
both in print and in pictures.

533
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:37,182
That's just what the STDL
is trying to implement.

534
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:40,324
Our work was never more important
than it is today.

535
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,426
- (St. Clair) The fact that there are...
- (Faye) Why the big rush?

536
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:44,459
It's not exactly like
you're the guest of honour.

537
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:47,029
Hey, there's someone I know.
Maggie, how are you?

538
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:49,426
- Good to see you, Faye.
- (Faye) Oh, forgive me.

539
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:52,331
Meet my fiance'.
Maggie Russell, Michael Barrett.

540
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,131
How do you do?
I thought I recognised you.

541
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:56,933
You mean those terrible newspaper
pictures do me justice?

542
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:59,099
I happen to have
a special interest in your case.

543
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,641
<i>(St. Clair) "hard-hitting action.</i>

544
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:03,872
<i>And by that I mean
vigorous, positive enforcement</i>

545
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,812
- <i>of existing obscenity laws...</i>
- <i>We'd better grab</i> a <i>seat.</i>

546
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:06,848
<i>...all over the country.</i>

547
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,179
<i>- And, with courageous Americans...
- See you around, Maggie!</i>

548
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:12,653
...like our guest of honour today,
to do the enforcing.

549
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:15,156
It is now with the
greatest of pleasure

550
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:19,295
that I give you our county's
distinguished District Attorney,

551
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:23,525
- Mr Elmo Duncan.
- (Applause)

552
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,868
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

553
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:32,509
Glad you all could make it.

554
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:35,805
Mrs St. Clair has asked me
to say a few words

555
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:39,575
on the subject of pornography
as related to our permissive society.

556
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:42,049
I cannot think of a subject
which is more relevant.

557
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:46,518
There is virtually no area
that remains untainted

558
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:50,252
by the quick-buck artists who
pander to our lowest forms of taste

559
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:52,191
and the public be damned.

560
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:55,259
Just the other evening,
my first night off in weeks,

561
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,197
I decided to take my wife Mary
and our three children to the movies.

562
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:02,897
In our neighbourhood,
we had such subject material

563
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:07,534
<i>as rape, lust, motorcycle gangs,
homosexuals,</i>

564
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,679
- <i>lesbianism...</i>
- <i>I'm going to take</i> a <i>walk.</i>

565
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:10,246
- I'll be right back.
- ...drug abuse, you name it.

566
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,384
<i>Whatever happened to the movies</i> we
<i>used to be able to take our children to?</i>

567
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,383
- (Applause)
- (Mike) Remember to tell me what I missed.

568
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:18,852
Films that offered
real movie stars,

569
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:23,720
Like the charming lady seated to my left,
Miss Constance Cumberland.

570
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:26,955
(Enthusiastic applause)

571
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:32,426
<i>Never in the history of our great nation
has there been such a proliferation</i>

572
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:37,597
<i>of obscene material on the screen,
the magazine racks, and the bookshelves.</i>

573
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,208
- The pomographers...
- (Mike) Miss Russell!

574
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:41,902
While I had a chance lwanted
to have a few words with you

575
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,047
about your relatives the Griffiths.

576
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:46,080
Faye mentioned your
relationship with Jerry.

577
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:46,717
And?

578
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:48,216
Well, she said you were
very close to him.

579
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:49,819
We're not only relatives,
we're friends.

580
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:52,784
I'm prepared to defend Jerry
against anyone who wants to hurt him.

581
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,788
Well, I have no reason to hurt Jerry.

582
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,790
My interest in him
is merely professional.

583
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:59,088
You see, from what I know
about juvenile delinquency,

584
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,060
I'm not convinced
that reading-matter alone

585
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:03,257
can be held responsible
for antisocial acts.

586
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:06,301
I was hoping we'd have
a chance to talk about this.

587
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:08,836
I won't even dignify the thought
of such a discussion.

588
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:12,834
I suppose it'd be foolish of me to ask
if Jerry's father would see me?

589
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:16,808
You can't be serious, Mr Barrett.
You're annoying me.

590
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:23,186
- Well, I'm sorry, I really am.
- (Car engine starts)

591
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:26,852
But you could have snubbed me.
Good manners, Miss Russell?

592
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:28,356
Not good manners, Mr Barrett.

593
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:30,323
I just wanted to find out
if you were really

594
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:33,328
the kind of son of a bitch
everyone said you were.

595
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:37,692
Jerry, I feel these sessions
can be very beneficial to you.

596
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,765
I don't like to talk about myself.

597
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:44,772
Well, I'm afraid your father
and Mr Yerkes have other plans

598
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:47,308
concerning your
co-operation this afternoon.

599
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:50,208
You tell him his loser company
ain't worth that much money!

600
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,542
Well, fly him back
from the goddamn safari!

601
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:57,210
When people find out he's
killing defenseless animals

602
00:30:57,388 --> 00:31:00,653
with a machine gun,
it's eighty-six for him anyway.

603
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:04,989
(Raucous laughter) What an idea
for Art Buchwald's column!

604
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,326
How'd it go?

605
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:09,398
Well, Jerry is completely ambivalent
about Sheri Moore.

606
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:12,159
On the one hand he hates to
discuss the circumstance,

607
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:16,170
but on the other when he does discuss it
he reveals a certain pride in the act.

608
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:17,137
What else?

609
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:19,299
Jerry also has a wish
for self-destruction,

610
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,740
possibly real but more likely fantasy.

611
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:25,746
I feel he should be subjected
to as few pressures as possible.

612
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:28,680
Frank, the boy needs help.
He's in bad shape.

613
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,218
What the hell's wrong now?

614
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,982
We'll never get him to testify
until we get him back on the track.

615
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:35,352
I think the kid and Trimble
should get together

616
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,926
every day between now and the trial.

617
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:39,996
Well, that makes
a great deal of sense.

618
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:42,758
Fine. Now, let's see what's
happening in the other room.

619
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:46,426
(Lushly romantic piano music)

620
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:53,710
Good to see you, Merle!

621
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:56,438
Griffith! Trimble!
Come over here!

622
00:31:56,681 --> 00:32:01,050
I want you to meet Merle Reid,
a truly great American.

623
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:05,019
Mr Reid, this is a real pleasure.
I catch your newscast every night.

624
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:06,622
You flatter me, Mr Griffith.

625
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:10,618
I hope you'll tell that to
the rating surveyors when they call.

626
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:13,059
(Everyone laughs)

627
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:18,964
I'm really looking
fonlvard to this, Luther.

628
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:21,763
When my viewers see
what the smut peddlers

629
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:23,463
have done to that poor young boy,

630
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:28,975
you'll have a groundswell of sentiment
big enough to swamp the Queen Mary.

631
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:31,245
(Thumps table)
Good man.

632
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,475
I think they're ready.

633
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:39,917
Well, Jerry, you won't feel a thing.
You have nothing to worry about.

634
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:42,658
(Crew member)
Any time you're ready, Mr Reid.

635
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:45,955
We're rolling.

636
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:49,958
- Speed. Jerry Griffith interview, take one.
- (Clapperboard snaps shut)

637
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:54,594
And action, Mr Reid!

638
00:32:56,574 --> 00:33:00,135
Ladies and gentlemen, I am sitting in
the home of the Frank Griffith family.

639
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:04,839
An average American family,
if you will, until the night before last,

640
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:08,814
when a shattering experience
catapulted them into the headlights.

641
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,818
Young Jerry Griffith,
whom you see seated beside me,

642
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:16,619
was taken into police custody
and charged with the most heinous crime.

643
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,456
A crime which had been
perpetrated by the reading

644
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:22,758
of an awful, ugly, and...
yes, I'll use the word,

645
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:25,527
a patently obscene book.

646
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,830
Until now, not one soul
from the television media

647
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,474
has been granted the opportunity
of speaking with young Jerry.

648
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:34,804
But he and his father have
graciously allowed me the privilege

649
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:40,508
of being the first and only news man
to hear the family's side of the story.

650
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,111
Tell me, Jerry,
was The Seven Minutes

651
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:47,382
part of your reading assignments
at the university?

652
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:48,786
I really don't wanna talk about it.

653
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,657
I couldn't be more in sympathy
with your feelings.

654
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:56,698
But the public does have a right to know
how this book led you astray.

655
00:33:57,568 --> 00:34:01,834
Tell us now exactly how
The Seven Minutes prompted you

656
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:04,873
to run out and violate this girl.

657
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:07,407
(Emphatic, echoing chords)

658
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:12,247
I don't wanna talk about it!

659
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:14,849
(Frenzied orchestral music)

660
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:33,098
(Voice trembling)
For the first time

661
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:37,998
in my newscasting career,
I am speechless.

662
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:42,270
Permit me, however,
to leave you with this question.

663
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:46,882
How many other killer books are in
the hands of your sons and daughters?

664
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:52,717
Yes, your sons and daughters,
this very moment.

665
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:55,450
Now you've seen what a dirty book
can do to a youngster.

666
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:59,619
No, I've seen sickness, Mr Yerkes,
but it wasn't caused by any book.

667
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:02,389
You'd better go shopping
for a new psychiatrist.

668
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,296
- You can't afford me.
- Nowjust a minute, you...

669
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:09,771
That footage on his cracking up
is gonna be great!

670
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,372
Simply first class.

671
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:14,443
(Emphatic orchestral music)

672
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:23,311
Operator, this is KME 515.
Give me CR 72211 please.

673
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:24,250
Barrett and Rutherford.

674
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:26,890
Donna, are you still taking
those courses at the university?

675
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:28,423
Yes, sir, three nights a week.

676
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:29,753
Any rap about Jerry Griffith?

677
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:31,656
One girl in my econ class did mention

678
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:33,796
<i>that she saw him occasionally
at the Lube Rack.</i>

679
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,796
Oh really? I'll be up in
a couple of minutes.

680
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,127
<i>Yes sir, Mr Barrett.</i>

681
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,933
Barrett! You the lawyer who's
defending that dirty book?

682
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:44,938
Yes, I...

683
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:47,604
I'm Sheri Moore's father,
you son of a bitch!

684
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,508
And I'm warning you to keep your
goddamn nose out of our private affairs!

685
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:53,308
My poor girl's damn near dead
because some little punk

686
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:55,679
was made crazy
by your damn dirty book!

687
00:35:55,853 --> 00:36:00,313
- Well, I've had it, you hear?
- (Cuts to sustained vocal note)

688
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:04,618
(Loud rock music)

689
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:10,460
 Get up, baby

690
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:13,159
<i> Dance on the drums</i>

691
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:16,835

<i> You can't have no

00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:14,159

<i> Loosen up, baby</i>

716
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,809
<i> Let out the slack... </i>

717
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:07,076
- (knocks on window)
- Jerry? Jerry!

718
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:18,487
Nembutals. It's lucky you
got him here when you did.

719
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:20,594
Another five minutes,
and he'd have been finished.

720
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,665
He gave me this piece of paper
with a name and phone number on it.

721
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:25,630
Said it was the only one
to be contacted.

722
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:30,072
I thought I told you...

723
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:36,811
Jerry? He can't be with you, he's
not allowed to leave the house.

724
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:44,816
What happened? Where?
I'll be right there.

725
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,786
Dr Quigley's a good man.

726
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:51,427
He'll make a discreet report, and
everything will be kept very quiet.

727
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:54,086
Ijust can't imagine
what made Jerry do it.

728
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:58,496
I'd like to ask you something.

729
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:03,873
- Go ahead.
- Were you following Jerry?

730
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:08,137
No. I was looking for someone else.
One of his friends, George Perkins.

731
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:12,613
I'm sorry. You must think
I suspect every move you make.

732
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:15,983
Music?

733
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:28,389
Jerry was bugged by a couple of things
that happened at the house today.

734
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:32,365
Now no-one expects you
to be unfaithful to the cause.

735
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,998
Luther Yerkes was there today.

736
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:37,572
He brought over a psychoanalyst,

737
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:41,337
and Jerry was forced to go into therapy
with this guy against his will.

738
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:45,671
Luther Yerkes at the Griffiths.

739
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:51,015
Until now I'd only heard rumours that
he was backing Duncan for the Senate.

740
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:54,814
Then, Mr Yerkes
wheeled out Merle Reid

741
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:59,359
to interview Jerry
on coast-to-coast television.

742
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,326
- Just simply...
- You know, I always think...

743
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:05,094
- Excuse me, go ahead.
- N0, no, you go ahead.

744
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:10,204
You know, my whole attitude
toward you has changed 180 degrees.

745
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:16,204
Before I came to work
for the Griffiths,

746
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:20,111
there was a woman working there
as a nurse to Mrs Griffith.

747
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:25,084
After she quit or was fired,
that's when I was offered the job.

748
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:27,951
Maybe she could
give you a little help?

749
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:29,021
Do you remember her name?

750
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,787
Isabel Vogler.
She lived out in Laurelvale.

751
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:36,124
That's the most I can offer you
by way of appreciation

752
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:37,925
for what you did tonight.

753
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,400
Thank you.

754
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:45,865
Now I've got to run. Thank you.

755
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:55,045
L'd like to see you again.
No prying, I promise. Strictly social.

756
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:59,279
It's tempting, but I'm afraid not.

757
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:02,255
If I was seen with you in public...

758
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,320
But if I can ever help you
in any way that doesn't

759
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:09,294
jeopardise my relationship
with the family...

760
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:14,164
- Well, you have my private number.
- I'll remember that.

761
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:17,398
Oh, by the way,
I read The Seven Minutes.

762
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,773
It's a beautiful book.

763
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:34,689
(Music playing)

764
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:37,320
You've got a suspicious look
on your face.

765
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:41,331
(Faye)
How can you drink that in the morning?

766
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:45,332
Is that why you stopped by?
To check on my drinking habits?

767
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,494
You were supposed to call last night.

768
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:50,970
I got into this... thing.
Part of the investigation.

769
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,541
You know the woman you passed by
on the way out of here?

770
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:59,272
Well, uh... that was Frank Griffith's
former housekeeper, Mrs Isabel Vogler.

771
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:01,974
Now, she's agreed
to testify at the trial

772
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,347
about the conditions
existing in the Griffith home.

773
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:09,049
Particularly as to how they affected
one Mr Jerry Griffith.

774
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:15,894
Can you trust someone like that?

775
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,064
Mrs Vogler is as trustworthy
as any of Duncan's witnesses.

776
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:21,294
S0 why the sudden concern?

777
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:24,873
I'm just worried about the nasty
people you're becoming associated with

778
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:27,543
over an unworthy piece of trash.

779
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,474
First of all, the book
isn't a piece of trash.

780
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,081
There's no-one around to
contaminate me, so let's cool it, huh?

781
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:48,555
Well, I've gotta get to
the office now, or I'll be late.

782
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:02,404
Faye?

783
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:06,574
Faye, I really am sorry
about last night.

784
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:09,548
See you later and make up for it, huh?

785
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:17,025
- Both good and bad news, Mike.
- Give me the bad first.

786
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:18,694
<i>Lemux sold out for</i> a <i>higher price</i>

787
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:21,126
and he's flying in from Paris
to testify for Duncan.

788
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:24,027
The good news is that I've
located Norman C. Quandt.

789
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:25,133
Gee, that's great. Where is he?

790
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:27,270
He operates something called the, uh,

791
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:30,699
Arts and Sciences Cinema Company

792
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:34,037
- at 348 Donovan Drive.
- Imposing title.

793
00:43:34,211 --> 00:43:36,042
Well, it's probably
one of the leading manufacturers

794
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:37,941
<i>of pornographic movies
on the West Coast.</i>

795
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:39,979
Nudies, beavers, the whole bit.

796
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:42,482
- When <i>could</i> I <i>see him?</i>
- <i>Right now, man. He's expecting you.</i>

797
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:44,245
- I'm on my way.
- Okey doke.

798
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:46,886
(Quandt) There's nothing dirty
about these pictures.

799
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:49,958
Now back to that creep Leroux, let's
go to my office and check the files.

800
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,822
Back in '47 I flew over to Paris
to get a first-hand look

801
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:54,553
at some of the highly touted
French stuff.

802
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:58,166
My contact was Leroux, a publisher of
dirty books and part-time pimp.

803
00:43:58,402 --> 00:44:01,565
Among other things, he made me an
offer for three raunchy paperbacks.

804
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:03,831
One of them was The Seven Minutes.

805
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:11,140
Do you recall him saying anything

806
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,647
about the author of
The Seven Minutes, J.J. Jadway?

807
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,148
Yeah, in fact he turned over
a pack of letters

808
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,344
written by Jadway to his mistress,
some chick named...

809
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:19,182
- Cassie McGraw?
- Yeah.

810
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:21,415
You mean you actually have
letters written by Jadway?

811
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:23,958
Till a week ago. I unloaded them
on an autograph dealer in New York.

812
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:25,026
Can you give me his name,
the autograph hunter?

813
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:26,958
(Siren blares)

814
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:28,860
(Panicked shrieking)

815
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:33,299
(inaudible shouting)

816
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:39,098
Get outta the place!
You'll tip the D.A.!

817
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:41,005
You gotta be out of your head.
I'm on the other side!

818
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:43,473
He's sent them round
to me before!

819
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:48,846
- Now get outta here!
- The autograph dealer!

820
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,544
Olin Adams,
55th Street New York.

821
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:55,151
<i>(Olin Adams)
You got a deal, Mr Barrett.</i>

822
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,850
I can send the letters out to you
C.O.D. in the morning.

823
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:00,690
No, I need them sooner than that.
I'm flying to New York tonight.

824
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:05,062
I'll be in your shop between
nine and ten, and I'll pay in cash.

825
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:07,066
- As you wish, sir.
- Right.

826
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:08,568
Jadway speaking from the grave.

827
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:11,469
Those letters can wipe out
Leroux's contention

828
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:13,336
that Jadway was
a money-hungry pornographer,

829
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:16,377
and we've got Isabel Vogler
to put down Jerry Griffith's testimony

830
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,979
that the book alone turned him on.

831
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:21,515
- We are finally getting it together.
- (Phone buzzes)

832
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,385
- Yeah, Donna.
- There's an urgent call

833
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:29,754
- from Miss Osborn on 3.
- Thank you. Hello, pretty lady.

834
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:31,519
Michael, I know you
cancelled out on me tonight

835
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:32,593
because you're loaded with work,

836
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:34,697
but I have to see you.
It's terribly important.

837
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:36,833
I'm flying out of here tonight
at eight o'clock.

838
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:39,867
I, uh... I'll tell you what.
You can pick me up

839
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,901
and drive me to the airport,
and we'll talk on the way.

840
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,699
I'll pick you up at 7:15.

841
00:45:45,776 --> 00:45:50,338
Mr Griffith places a large amount of
advertising on Dad's television stations,

842
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:53,539
so naturally you can understand
how Daddy felt when he heard

843
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:56,845
you were going to call a witness
who would malign Frank Griffith.

844
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,214
How did Dad feel?

845
00:45:58,388 --> 00:46:00,288
Concerned enough to pay
a visit to Mr Griffith

846
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:03,618
to prepare for any libel
Mrs Vogler might be offering.

847
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:06,058
- Beautiful.
- After his talk with Griffith,

848
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:10,030
Dad was convinced Mrs Vogler
is a psychopathic liar.

849
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,226
OK, so now you've told me
the urgent news, what else?

850
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:15,098
Dad wants me to tell you
that any thought you have

851
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:18,866
of using Isabel Vogler on the witness
stand is out of the question.

852
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:23,304
- He was positive about that.
- Oh, was he now?

853
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,472
I promised him that once I spoke to
you there would be no problem.

854
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:28,140
But there is a problem, Faye.

855
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:30,914
I will use Mrs Vogler
on the witness stand.

856
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:32,919
You're behaving like an ass.

857
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:34,580
I can't believe you'd
give up everything

858
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,419
to defend your little house of filth.

859
00:46:36,593 --> 00:46:38,322
- I won't accept it.
- You'd better, Faye,

860
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:40,395
- because ljust can't meet your terms.
- (Brakes squealing)

861
00:46:40,564 --> 00:46:43,124
Then you are an ass.
You're second-rate, Mike,

862
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:46,769
and I only have time for number one!

863
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:03,114
(Car door shuts)

864
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:07,587
Tell dear old Dad he'll just have to
find himself a more willing patsy.

865
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:10,591
- Go to hell!
- (Tyres screech)

866
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:25,139
- Mr Adams? I'm Michael Barrett.
- Mr Barrett?

867
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:29,142
That's right. I spoke to you
yesterday afternoon,

868
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:33,612
about the Jadway letters?
Oh, I know I should have been here earlier,

869
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:36,183
but I got hung up in traffic.
Nevertheless, I'm here,

870
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:37,819
and if I could see
those letters, please?

871
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:41,389
But sir, a Mr Barrett has already
picked up those letters.

872
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:43,355
- I beg your pardon?
- A gentleman came by here

873
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:44,824
a minute or two after
I opened this morning.

874
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:48,486
He paid the $800 and I gave him
the letters and he left immediately.

875
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:51,395
That can't be.
I can prove who I am.

876
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:53,335
Well, look at it!

877
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:56,036
S0 who the hell was it
that came by here

878
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,730
and picked up
your purchase this morning?

879
00:47:57,908 --> 00:47:59,842
Well, Mr Adams, that's
what I'd like you to tell me.

880
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:01,908
- Can you describe him for me?
- He was...

881
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,172
he was much taller than you.

882
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:07,579
Formal, very dignified.
I really didn't pay much attention.

883
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:11,417
Well, thanks for your trouble.

884
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:16,022
But I am deeply sorry, Mr Barrett.
Good luck to you.

885
00:48:18,528 --> 00:48:19,756
Yeah.

886
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:25,201
Donna, catch me the
first flight back to the coast.

887
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:28,166
Oh, before I forget,
tell Clay that I'll call Sanford

888
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:30,203
and brief him on his
coming appearance in court.

889
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,279
(Inserts money)

890
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:41,280
(Dials)

891
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,079
Yeah, operator?

892
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:46,017
I'd like to make a long distance call
to Miss Maggie Russell.

893
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,587
(Phone rings)

894
00:48:49,893 --> 00:48:53,021
<i>- Hello?
- Hello, Maggie? Michael Barrett here.</i>

895
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:56,893
Now, I know your rules,
but I really have to see you.

896
00:48:57,067 --> 00:48:57,590
<i>It's important.</i>

897
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:00,032
ls this strictly business,
or business and pleasure?

898
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:03,730
Well, it's partly business, but
seeing you would be a pleasure.

899
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:05,032
Won't Faye Osborn mind?

900
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:07,039
Well, we're not seeing
each other any more.

901
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,405
Oh? Where are you now?

902
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:11,206
- Manhattan.
- Manhattan?

903
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:14,782
Yep. Now it's 3:30
New York time

904
00:49:14,985 --> 00:49:16,316
and I can meet you in my office

905
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:17,748
<i>at 8:00 your time.</i>

906
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:32,101
(Thud, Mike groans)

907
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:41,270
Michael?
Can you hear me, Michael?

908
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:43,276
- They got away with it.
- With what?

909
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:45,978
They planted a monitor
on my phone,

910
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:48,276
and they decided to
remove the evidence,

911
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,248
and yours truly stumbled in on them.

912
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:53,116
It's not the first time. There've been
half a dozen other incidents

913
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:57,487
just as incredible. Mrs Isabel Vogler
suddenly refusing to testify,

914
00:49:57,694 --> 00:49:59,992
the loss of some
original Jadway letters,

915
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:02,995
and the real stunner
was the loss of Leroux,

916
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,134
the Frenchman who first
published The Seven Minutes.

917
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:09,431
Now he's saying Jadway's nothing more
than a squalid pornographer.

918
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:12,039
The man with the big chequeb0ok's
got the advantage.

919
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:15,209
- (Maggie exclaims joyfully)
- (Mike) Very good!

920
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:18,209
Uh... shall we?
I have an early day tomorrow

921
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:20,177
and if you're going to be
in shape for court,

922
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:21,715
you should have been
in bed an hour ago.

923
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:26,048
- Why, hello, Miss Russell.
- Mr Blair.

924
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,884
- (Projector whirring)
- I'll tell you one thing,

925
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:30,356
those broads are not acting.

926
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:37,627
Focus. Focus, goddamnit!

927
00:50:37,834 --> 00:50:38,960
We're missing the best part.

928
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:43,864
That's better. Where did we
get this stuff, Elmo?

929
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:47,373
Norman C. Quandt, S.O.B.
One of these days

930
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:49,408
I'm gonna throw him in the
slammer and toss away the key.

931
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:51,740
Now hold it, Elmo.
He may not be an L.B. Mayer,

932
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:54,177
but you've gotta admit
he makes great pictures.

933
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:57,717
Besides, we've gotta
protect the public.

934
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:00,516
- (Phone rings)
- Yerkes here.

935
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:02,555
<i>Mr Yerkes, I'm over here at the Daze.</i>

936
00:51:02,759 --> 00:51:06,195
<i>Just five minutes ago I ran into
Maggie Russell, Frank Gfiffith's niece.</i>

937
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:08,159
And who do you think she was with?

938
00:51:08,331 --> 00:51:11,232
<i>- Michael Barrett, counsellor for the defence.
- Thanks, Blair.</i>

939
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:17,431
Son ofa bitch! Goddamn her!
Wait till I put that girl on the carpet.

940
00:51:17,607 --> 00:51:21,202
Hold it, Frank, hold it.
If you kick her ass out

941
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:24,869
she could very easily be used
as a witness against us.

942
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:29,015
- You agree, Elmo?
- It's a possibility, Luther.

943
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:32,519
That's why we're not going to
interfere with Maggie and Barrett.

944
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:35,624
- It may turn out to be an advantage.
- Advantage? How?

945
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:38,054
Tell her you heard
she was out with Barrett.

946
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:40,923
But you're gonna be
just as sweet as honey.

947
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:43,190
Buy her story, whatever she says.

948
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:47,029
You're the great white father
trying to protect his son.

949
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:50,230
I approve, Griffith.
I agree with Luther 100%.

950
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:52,602
- How can she resist?
- (Elmo) It's an inspired approach.

951
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:58,270
For you, for your son,
and for our common cause.

952
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:03,951
The state of California has charged
an unknown bookseller

953
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:06,486
named Ben Fremont
with selling filth

954
00:52:06,723 --> 00:52:09,715
in the form of an underground
novel, The Seven Minutes,

955
00:52:09,926 --> 00:52:12,918
which was written by an
expatriate author, J.J. Jadway,

956
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,995
over three decades ago.

957
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:17,759
Now this trial has generated
enormous interest,

958
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:20,232
and in light of impending
Supreme Court hearings

959
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:23,895
on the question of obscenity
in films and reading matter,

960
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:27,668
this case could assume a
stature of national importance.

961
00:52:27,844 --> 00:52:29,334
Please rise.

962
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:32,949
Face the flag of our country,
recognising the principles

963
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,414
for which it stands:
liberty and justice for all.

964
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:39,180
Department 101 of the Superior Court
of the State of California

965
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:42,914
is now in session, the Honourable
Nathaniel Upshawjudge presiding.

966
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:46,789
- Please be seated, and no smoking.
- (Gavel bangs)

967
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:54,194
The case of the People of the State
of California versus Ben Fremont.

968
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:58,705
- Is the defence ready to proceed?
- Yes, Your Honour.

969
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:01,969
- Are the people ready to proceed?
- Yes, Your Honour.

970
00:53:02,145 --> 00:53:03,703
You may call your first witness,
Mr Duncan.

971
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:08,510
I call Sergeant Frank Kellog of the
County Sheriffs Department to the stand.

972
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,960
Please raise your right hand.
Do you solemnly swear

973
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:23,861
to tell the truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

974
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,968
- I do.
- State your name for the record.

975
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:29,503
Sergeant Frank Kellog, County
Sheriff's Office, Administrative Woe.

976
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:31,334
Please be seated.

977
00:53:34,811 --> 00:53:37,302
Sergeant Kellog, is the man who
sold you a copy of

978
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,971
- The Seven <i>Minutes</i> in this courtroom?
- Yes, sir, he is.

979
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:41,242
Would you point him out
to the court, please?

980
00:53:41,418 --> 00:53:42,680
That's him.

981
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:45,082
Let the record show, Your Honour,
the witness Sergeant Kellog

982
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:49,656
indicated the defendant Ben Fremont,
seated to the left of defence counsel.

983
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:53,818
Did Mr Fremont make any
comment about the book,

984
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:56,863
any reference to
its erotic explicitness?

985
00:53:57,167 --> 00:53:58,998
Well, the defendant Mr Fremont told me

986
00:53:59,169 --> 00:54:00,659
it was the most
banned book in history.

987
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:04,931
He said, and I quote, "It was banned
in every country in the world

988
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:09,578
"because it was considered obscene."
Those were Mr Fremonfs own words.

989
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:10,940
Your witness, Mr Barrett.

990
00:54:11,181 --> 00:54:13,547
Sergeant Kellog, on your visit
to the Argus Book Store,

991
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,945
did you impersonate
an ordinary customer?

992
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:17,346
No sir, that's not quite true.

993
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,010
But since you intended to buy the book

994
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:21,521
for the purposes of assembling
evidence against the defendant,

995
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:24,353
didn't you feel dishonest about
representing yourself as a customef?

996
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:27,189
Objection. The witness's
feelings are immaterial.

997
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:29,195
- Objection sustained.
- Forgive me, Your Honour.

998
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:34,564
Sergeant Kellog, why was it necessary
to use a concealed tape recordef?

999
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,363
Well, that's standard
operating procedure.

1000
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:38,968
If we were going to bust a hooker...

1001
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:41,301
(Widespread laughter)

1002
00:54:43,246 --> 00:54:48,707
...l mean, arrest a prostitute, we'd do
the same thing. That's perfectly legal.

1003
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:51,978
Well, I won't bother to comment
on the ethics of those vice officers

1004
00:54:52,222 --> 00:54:56,090
who circulate among bars
trying to entrap hoo...

1005
00:54:56,293 --> 00:55:02,994
mprostitutes. But I do wonder
how you feel about entrapping

1006
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:08,068
a respectable bookseller with leading
questions and concealed tape recorders?

1007
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:10,300
(Elmo) My next witness,
in a manner of speaking,

1008
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:12,566
will be the book itself.

1009
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:16,143
I now submit that The Seven <i>Minutes</i> be
read aloud to the members of the jury,

1010
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:20,476
so that they may become
acquainted with its entire contents.

1011
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:24,484
Seated in the witness box
is a neutral impartial citizen,

1012
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:28,146
a Mr Charles Wynter, a substitute
high school teacher locally,

1013
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:31,020
who in his spare time tapes
recordings for the blind,

1014
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:34,628
and is accustomed to reading aloud
without over-dramatising

1015
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:38,028
or unduly emphasising
specific passages.

1016
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:40,669
Objection, your honour!
With all due deference to the blind,

1017
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:43,634
the prosecution's remarks
are deliberately intended

1018
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,307
to appeal to the sympathy of the jury.

1019
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:48,842
Objection overruled. The District
Attorney's description of Mr Wynter

1020
00:55:49,045 --> 00:55:51,707
leaves no doubt of his
ability to remain impartial.

1021
00:55:51,881 --> 00:55:52,848
(Elmo) Thank you, Your Honour.

1022
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:57,543
Your Honour, while I already
have this person available,

1023
00:55:57,787 --> 00:56:00,551
I would willingly agree to let
anyone of Mr Barrett's choosing

1024
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:02,883
read the book aloud to the jury.

1025
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:05,391
Your Honour, what I care about
is the book being read aloud.

1026
00:56:05,628 --> 00:56:08,119
A novel is not meant to be
presented in such a fashion.

1027
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:10,356
That is my only objection.

1028
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:12,398
Your objection, Mr Barrett,
is overruled.

1029
00:56:12,635 --> 00:56:16,867
Mr Wynter may begin reading the book
in manner so prescribed by the court.

1030
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,237
Thank you, Your Honour.
Mr Wynter?

1031
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:28,809
(Judge) You may begin, but please
address the reading to the jury.

1032
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:35,320
(Slowly and pedantically)
A touch. ls that you?

1033
00:56:35,525 --> 00:56:40,428
My other lips swell in joyous welcome.
God, I have missed you.

1034
00:56:40,663 --> 00:56:44,224
There. Now move
slowly past my moist lips.

1035
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:46,402
Darling, let me kiss all of you.

1036
00:56:46,603 --> 00:56:49,367
Feel me close around you
in sweet embrace.

1037
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:51,665
Your Honour, I would like
to record my concern

1038
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:54,503
about one mannerism possessed
by the reader, Mr Wynter,

1039
00:56:54,711 --> 00:56:56,770
which may be prejudicial
to the defence.

1040
00:56:57,013 --> 00:57:02,178
The reader is placing undue emphasis
by raising his eyes on certain passages

1041
00:57:02,385 --> 00:57:06,014
which might be termed
"sexually realistic".

1042
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:08,453
Mr Barrett, I have been
watching Mr Wynter closely.

1043
00:57:08,691 --> 00:57:11,592
I am satisfied he is
performing in a manner

1044
00:57:11,795 --> 00:57:15,253
as mechanical and objective
as possible for a human being.

1045
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:20,266
I must deny your request.
Please resume, Mr Wynter.

1046
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:23,638
You were so strong,
and yet when we are together

1047
00:57:23,873 --> 00:57:27,274
we both grow weak with the delicious
perfection of our union.

1048
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:32,107
This is your home. This is the reason
for our existence.

1049
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,307
As a noted British publisher
of quality books,

1050
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:37,111
and a highly recognised authority
on the continental trade,

1051
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:42,314
Mr Van Fleet, do you feel that Jadway,
the author of The Seven Minutes,

1052
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:47,496
tried to give the reader some
understanding or vision of love?

1053
00:57:47,664 --> 00:57:49,825
Mr Jadway knew nothing of love.

1054
00:57:50,066 --> 00:57:54,435
Let me tell you a favourite
anecdote about Jadway.

1055
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:58,664
The story comes first-hand from
a simply marvellous study

1056
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:01,672
<i>entitled Outside the Mainstream.</i>

1057
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:04,505
The author is Dr Hiram Eberhart,

1058
00:58:04,747 --> 00:58:07,944
a highly respected professor
at Columbia University.

1059
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:10,676
Now, I'm going to quote
from him directly...

1060
00:58:10,854 --> 00:58:13,846
Your Honour, I object!
This supposed anecdote from that book

1061
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:15,853
would represent the
rankest form of hearsay.

1062
00:58:16,092 --> 00:58:18,993
I object to any reading from outside
the mainstream whatsoever.

1063
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:20,925
I am conversant with Dr Eberhart,

1064
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:23,827
and believe his book
to be very material, Counsel.

1065
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,661
Don't antagonise them.

1066
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,427
The witness will continue.

1067
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:34,200
"One night, after listening
to a prizefight on the radio,

1068
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:38,380
"a contest in which Joe Louis
wrested the heavyweight championship

1069
00:58:38,615 --> 00:58:43,109
"from one James Braddock, Jadway
told friends who had been listening to it

1070
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:46,618
"with him that love
between a man and a woman

1071
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:49,690
"was most often performed
like a prizefight.

1072
00:58:49,893 --> 00:58:52,987
"When Jadway was asked
to give examples of books

1073
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:56,290
"that depicted the
more common hostile love,

1074
00:58:56,466 --> 00:58:59,367
"he cited Henry Miller's
Tropic of Capricorn,

1075
00:58:59,569 --> 00:59:01,127
"which he had just read,

1076
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:05,068
"as a book that reflected
the brutality of l0ve."

1077
00:59:05,308 --> 00:59:08,368
One of your witnesses, Elmo, has got
to be a thinking man's faggot.

1078
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:10,808
Those queens are so afraid
of anything straight,

1079
00:59:11,014 --> 00:59:13,414
they're bound to be on our side.

1080
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:17,576
"Mthroughout The <i>Seven</i> Minutes is
an act of hatred against womanhood.

1081
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:21,551
"Jadway has unconsciously
taken on the role of a pugilist

1082
00:59:21,758 --> 00:59:25,888
"attempting to down and
humiliate the opposite sex."

1083
00:59:27,664 --> 00:59:34,866
End quote. lfind myself in total
agreement with Dr Eberhart.

1084
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:37,233
How much did we offer
to pay him to testify?

1085
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:39,170
Transportation plus five big ones.

1086
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:41,242
Please raise your right hand.
Do you solemnly swear

1087
00:59:41,444 --> 00:59:43,036
to tell the truth, and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

1088
00:59:43,212 --> 00:59:44,270
- I do.
- State your name for the record.

1089
00:59:44,447 --> 00:59:46,574
- My name is Christian Leroux.
- Please be seated.

1090
00:59:50,286 --> 00:59:51,776
I wonder how much
he got from the D.A.?

1091
00:59:51,955 --> 00:59:53,684
You'd better believe
it wasn't chopped liver.

1092
00:59:53,856 --> 00:59:56,188
Mr Leroux, what is
your present occupation?

1093
00:59:56,359 --> 00:59:57,451
I'm a publisher of books.

1094
00:59:57,627 --> 00:59:59,356
When did you first become a publisher?

1095
00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:03,124
In 1933 my father died, leaving me
a very modest inheritance.

1096
01:00:03,366 --> 01:00:07,359
S0 I established my own
publishing house, the Etoile Press.

1097
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:11,802
Is this the same publisher that brought
out a work of fiction in 1935 entitled

1098
01:00:11,975 --> 01:00:15,069
- The Seven Minutes, by J.J. Jadway?
- The same.

1099
01:00:15,244 --> 01:00:18,270
Mr Leroux, I have seen
your original version of this book,

1100
01:00:18,481 --> 01:00:19,914
which was printed in English.

1101
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:23,574
Since it was published in Paris,
why was it not in the French language?

1102
01:00:23,753 --> 01:00:26,381
The French government wouldn't permit
its publication in French.

1103
01:00:26,556 --> 01:00:27,386
Why not?

1104
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:29,457
The Censorship Bureau
declared it was obscene.

1105
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:33,221
<i>Obscene. To your knowledge,
has The Seven Minutes</i>

1106
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:36,421
ever been published in any other
country in any other language?

1107
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:39,124
Oh no. Absolutely no
nation in the world

1108
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:41,098
would pass on it or even accept it.

1109
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:44,671
Literary critics in many countries
regarded it as the most

1110
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:48,140
depraved book ever published
in the history of literature.

1111
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,745
Your Honour, I object to Mr Leroux's
self-serving answer,

1112
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:53,814
and I ask that it be stricken on the
grounds that it is incompetent.

1113
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:56,247
(Judge) I think that the witness is
qualified to give that answer.

1114
01:00:56,452 --> 01:01:00,115
Motion to strike is denied,
and objection overruled.

1115
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:01,688
Proceed, Mr Duncan.

1116
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:03,689
Mr Leroux, what kind of
commercial success

1117
01:01:03,926 --> 01:01:05,917
<i>did The Seven Minutes
have in France?</i>

1118
01:01:06,095 --> 01:01:07,494
Well, not as much as we'd hoped.

1119
01:01:07,697 --> 01:01:11,155
My initial printing was 5,000 copies.
This sold out in a year.

1120
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:13,961
Then I ordered a press run
of another 5,000 copies,

1121
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:17,105
but the sales slowed down
and eventually stopped.

1122
01:01:17,306 --> 01:01:20,332
That is after the Vatican
placed the book on the Index.

1123
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:24,844
(Mike) Father Sarsatti, you testified that
the Curia Offices had been revamped

1124
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:29,542
and streamlined since J.J. Jadway's
book was first published in 1935.

1125
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:35,851
Yes, in 1966, in keeping with
the new Ecumenical Council spirit

1126
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:38,550
which pervaded the Church
and all of Christendom.

1127
01:01:38,795 --> 01:01:45,496
Pope Paul VII abolished the title of the
Supreme Congregation of the Holy Office

1128
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:48,694
because it had long been held
offensive by Protestants

1129
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:51,999
who associated it with
what they regarded as

1130
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,741
persecution in early Church history.

1131
01:01:54,911 --> 01:01:58,244
Is it not, true, Father, that at the
convening of the Ecumenical Council

1132
01:01:58,481 --> 01:02:01,712
there were numerous Roman Catholic
clerics who protested against

1133
01:02:01,918 --> 01:02:05,149
the old Holy Office, the very
office that condemned Jadway,

1134
01:02:05,321 --> 01:02:07,346
because it did not hold
fair hearings for authors?

1135
01:02:07,523 --> 01:02:10,083
The Catholic Church
is a democratic body.

1136
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:13,887
Its bishops and cardinals
are given total freedom

1137
01:02:14,097 --> 01:02:15,587
in the formation of their opinion.

1138
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:19,427
There were those who chose to express
some measure of disagreement

1139
01:02:19,602 --> 01:02:21,035
with the rulings of the Holy Office.

1140
01:02:21,204 --> 01:02:22,034
Would it not follow, then, Father,

1141
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:24,570
that in view of the new liberality
on the part of the Church,

1142
01:02:24,774 --> 01:02:28,369
that what the Church condemned
and prohibited in 1935

1143
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:31,445
it might not condemn
and prohibit today?

1144
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:36,242
Signore, sir, that is
a hypothetical question

1145
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:40,855
which I have neither the qualifications
nor the authority to answer.

1146
01:02:41,057 --> 01:02:43,924
Let me say this, however,
that I am here before you

1147
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:45,788
as a representative of the Vatican,

1148
01:02:46,028 --> 01:02:50,931
because the Church is just as
concerned today as it was in 1935

1149
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:54,866
about the publication and circulation

1150
01:02:55,071 --> 01:02:59,804
of an immoral and sacrilegious work
of fiction entitled The Seven Minutes.

1151
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:06,142
You got it now, Harvey. I want you to hit
them with as many numbers as possible.

1152
01:03:06,382 --> 01:03:07,940
Make it sound like this dame

1153
01:03:08,151 --> 01:03:10,984
is second cousin to every one
of those clowns in that jury box.

1154
01:03:11,154 --> 01:03:13,622
Our average woman
resides in an urban area,

1155
01:03:13,823 --> 01:03:15,723
in a city of less than
100,000 population,

1156
01:03:15,925 --> 01:03:17,586
which qualifies Oakwood
to supply this woman.

1157
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,955
She has a five-room home
worth $11,000,

1158
01:03:20,163 --> 01:03:22,563
half the house is mortgaged,
the house has a bathtub or shower,

1159
01:03:22,732 --> 01:03:25,997
flush toilet, electricity, telephone,
TV set and washing machine.

1160
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:28,831
No air conditioning,
no clothes dryer, no food freezer.

1161
01:03:29,005 --> 01:03:30,472
The average woman spends
seven hours a day

1162
01:03:30,673 --> 01:03:32,163
in the kitchen,
performing her household chores.

1163
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:35,174
Very impressive, Mr Underwood.
You've covered everything

1164
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:37,072
except her frequency of elimination,

1165
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,748
and the time of day
she prefers to fornicate.

1166
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:43,317
(Bangs gavel) Let us observe some of
the rules of taste, Counsellor.

1167
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:45,180
And would you please refrain
from turning your back to the court?

1168
01:03:45,354 --> 01:03:47,914
Forgive me, Your Honour, but I feel
the court should be a little more

1169
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:49,819
enlightened about the average person,

1170
01:03:50,026 --> 01:03:52,517
especially in relationship
to statistics.

1171
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:57,699
Now as I understand it, 51% of the
U.S. population is female,

1172
01:03:57,934 --> 01:03:59,629
while 49% is male.

1173
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:02,361
Now according to what you've said,
that means

1174
01:04:02,605 --> 01:04:05,039
the average American is only female.
Now is that true?

1175
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:07,369
Of course not.
One can't average two absolutes.

1176
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:10,374
I was referring to concepts that
can be converted into statistics,

1177
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:11,477
such as age or income.

1178
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:14,207
I appreciate your wanting to talk
about numbers, Mr Undenlvood,

1179
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:15,781
but I want to talk about persons.

1180
01:04:15,985 --> 01:04:20,615
Specifically, the average person
mentioned in the Criminal Code.

1181
01:04:20,823 --> 01:04:22,347
Let me ask the jury this:

1182
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:26,858
Supposing 50% of the
American population was male,

1183
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:29,224
and 50% was female.

1184
01:04:29,398 --> 01:04:32,060
Wouldn't the average
American be a queer?

1185
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:35,671
- (Widespread laughter)
- Order! Order! Order!

1186
01:04:37,673 --> 01:04:39,334
Now that we've established
your qualifications

1187
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:42,375
as an average housewife to the
court's satisfaction, Mrs White,

1188
01:04:42,578 --> 01:04:44,978
can you tell us whether
you read a novel

1189
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:48,309
called The Seven Minutes,
written by J.J. Jadway?

1190
01:04:48,484 --> 01:04:52,181
I have. lforced myself to read it
from cover to cover.

1191
01:04:52,355 --> 01:04:55,813
As an average person in your community,
applying contemporary standards,

1192
01:04:55,992 --> 01:04:57,721
what was your reaction to this book?

1193
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,657
I found it sickeningly obscene.

1194
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:02,093
Did you feel it went beyond
the customary limits of candour

1195
01:05:02,331 --> 01:05:05,061
in its description of nudity or sef?

1196
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:07,702
The Seven Minutes belongs
in a garbage disposal.

1197
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:10,667
If I had one,
that's where the book would go.

1198
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,603
- (Elmo) Did you find anything in the novel...
- (inaudible whispering)

1199
01:05:12,842 --> 01:05:16,778
...that could be considered as having
social redeeming importance?

1200
01:05:16,946 --> 01:05:19,710
It was sex and more sex,
and nothing else.

1201
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:23,113
I never laid eyes on
reading matter more obscene.

1202
01:05:23,286 --> 01:05:26,449
Thank you, Mrs White.
Your witness, counsellor.

1203
01:05:28,024 --> 01:05:31,050
Mrs White, since you are the first
average woman I've ever met,

1204
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,091
I'm eager to know
a little more about your taste.

1205
01:05:33,296 --> 01:05:36,732
I'm anxious to know if your
reading habits are also average.

1206
01:05:36,899 --> 01:05:40,596
- They are.
- Oh? How do you know they are?

1207
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:43,238
I read a lot. All the popular things

1208
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:46,408
that come into the library,
and in paperback.

1209
01:05:46,575 --> 01:05:49,203
Have you ever read <i>Peyton</i> Place,
by Grace Metalious?

1210
01:05:49,378 --> 01:05:50,470
Of course not.

1211
01:05:50,646 --> 01:05:52,477
Have you read God's <i>Little</i> Acre,
by Erskine Caldwell?

1212
01:05:52,648 --> 01:05:54,115
No, I haven't.

1213
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:58,777
Have you read Lady Chattefley's Lover,
by D.H. Lawrence?

1214
01:05:58,955 --> 01:05:59,751
I have not.

1215
01:05:59,922 --> 01:06:02,322
Have you read In His Steps,
by Charles Sheldon?

1216
01:06:02,491 --> 01:06:05,221
No. I never even heard of it.

1217
01:06:05,394 --> 01:06:06,588
That's very interesting, Mrs White.

1218
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:09,890
Then by Mr Undewvoods standards
your reading habits are far from average.

1219
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:12,624
You see, the four novels
I have just mentioned

1220
01:06:12,835 --> 01:06:16,430
sold over thirty million copies
in this country alone.

1221
01:06:16,605 --> 01:06:17,731
To which I object, Your Honour.

1222
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:20,306
The Counsel is badgering the witness
in front of thejury,

1223
01:06:20,509 --> 01:06:22,636
and is asking questions
in argumentative form.

1224
01:06:22,845 --> 01:06:25,439
I know twenty books that outsold
the novels Barrett mentioned.

1225
01:06:25,614 --> 01:06:29,106
Those are four of the five leading
best-sellers in American history.

1226
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:31,082
(Judge) Gentlemen, let's proceed
in an orderly fashion.

1227
01:06:31,287 --> 01:06:34,188
I expect both of you to abide
by the rules of evidence.

1228
01:06:34,423 --> 01:06:36,288
Now let's get on with the trial.

1229
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:44,660
Mrs White, would the average American
read The Seven Minutes?

1230
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:46,165
Absolutely not.

1231
01:06:47,303 --> 01:06:50,795
But you're supposedly average,
and you read it, didn't you?

1232
01:06:50,973 --> 01:06:53,669
I was requested to read it
for this trial.

1233
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:56,971
Oh? Otherwise, you
would not have read it?

1234
01:06:57,146 --> 01:07:00,980
Most certainly not. I don't waste
my time with obscene reading.

1235
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:02,708
But Mrs White, how would
you know it was obscene

1236
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:03,976
if you didn't read it?

1237
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:07,611
I don't have to drink poison
to know that it's poison.

1238
01:07:08,124 --> 01:07:10,058
Do you believe that writers
should say what they mean

1239
01:07:10,292 --> 01:07:11,554
when writing about sex?

1240
01:07:11,727 --> 01:07:15,823
Yes. But they can do that
without using indecent words,

1241
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:18,159
like the words in that book.

1242
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:21,531
Can you be specific about the words in
The Seven Minutes that offended you?

1243
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:23,296
Well, I'm certainly not
going to use them.

1244
01:07:29,912 --> 01:07:31,072
Point them out.

1245
01:07:32,581 --> 01:07:34,139
Let me see what you object to.

1246
01:07:38,854 --> 01:07:40,822
Go ahead. The book won't bite.

1247
01:07:58,374 --> 01:07:59,898
Very fine, Mrs White.

1248
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:02,867
I appreciate
your co-operation.

1249
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:10,784
Now, what we have here
is the word "fucking".

1250
01:08:11,053 --> 01:08:12,247
(Shocked murmuring)

1251
01:08:12,455 --> 01:08:14,946
ls that correct?
Excuse me, Mrs White?

1252
01:08:15,124 --> 01:08:17,558
- That is the word you object to?
- Disgusting.

1253
01:08:17,726 --> 01:08:19,455
Would you have been happier
if the writer had used

1254
01:08:19,695 --> 01:08:22,027
such euphemisms as
"they slept togethef",

1255
01:08:22,231 --> 01:08:23,960
"they were intimate"
or "they made love"?

1256
01:08:24,133 --> 01:08:27,864
I would have understood just as well
what the author was trying to say.

1257
01:08:28,037 --> 01:08:30,597
But you could have been wrong?
If Kathleen and her man

1258
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:32,900
had slept together, were intimate
or they made love,

1259
01:08:33,075 --> 01:08:34,474
they might have been
doing many other things

1260
01:08:34,643 --> 01:08:37,635
other than the only exact word
for this particular act.

1261
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:39,915
It cannot be mistaken.

1262
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:43,984
Mrs White, I'm not advocating
that coarse or vulgar words

1263
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:45,643
should be used by everyone everywhere.

1264
01:08:45,888 --> 01:08:50,484
I am saying that writers from
Chaucer to Jadway should be allowed

1265
01:08:50,659 --> 01:08:56,325
the freedom to use specific precise
words when writing realistically.

1266
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,300
Now, wouldn't you agree, Mrs White?

1267
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:03,836
I am not interested in the past,
Mr Barrett.

1268
01:09:04,073 --> 01:09:08,009
I'm interested in protecting
our morality in the present.

1269
01:09:08,244 --> 01:09:12,476
Especially the morality of our young
people, so that our civilisation

1270
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:16,311
doesn't decay and decline
the way others have done.

1271
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:19,852
(Emphatic music)

1272
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:21,616
Thank you.

1273
01:09:40,776 --> 01:09:45,304
Remember when Van Fleet
mentioned the anecdote

1274
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:49,474
about the night Jadway was listening
to Joe Louis win the heavyweight title

1275
01:09:49,652 --> 01:09:51,210
- by knocking out Braddock?
- Yeah.

1276
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:55,218
- When did Jadway die?
- February 1937.

1277
01:09:55,457 --> 01:10:01,225
Correct. Jadway killed himself and was
promptly cremated in February 1937.

1278
01:10:01,463 --> 01:10:04,159
But here we have
Dr Eberhart telling us

1279
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:08,564
how Jadway read and discussed
Tropic of Capricorn.

1280
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:14,670
Capricorn wasn't
published until 1939.

1281
01:10:14,843 --> 01:10:17,641
Well, maybe Dr Eberhart confused
his source of information.

1282
01:10:17,846 --> 01:10:20,474
<i>We confuse Tropic of Capricorn</i>
with <i>Tropic of Cancer,</i>

1283
01:10:20,683 --> 01:10:25,484
which I'm sure was published while
Jadway was still very much alive.

1284
01:10:25,721 --> 01:10:27,086
No, no, listen to this.

1285
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:32,259
Page 624: "Joe Louis
knocked out Jim Braddock

1286
01:10:32,528 --> 01:10:35,929
"in the eighth round
in Chicago in June 1937."

1287
01:10:36,098 --> 01:10:38,931
Get it? June 1937.

1288
01:10:39,168 --> 01:10:41,534
That means that Jadway
was listening to the fight

1289
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:44,729
four months after he was
supposed to be dead.

1290
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,235
- Now how does that grab you?
- A lot better.

1291
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:51,106
The distinguished Dr Eberhart may
have been wrong a second time.

1292
01:10:51,347 --> 01:10:55,875
But twice in one paragraph from a
renowned scholar? Highly unlikely.

1293
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:59,543
This gives us a new and revived Jadway

1294
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:04,419
who did not die in February 1937
as Leroux and the priest testified.

1295
01:11:04,627 --> 01:11:08,256
It gives us Jadway very much alive,
four months later.

1296
01:11:08,464 --> 01:11:11,297
For that matter, is he even dead?

1297
01:11:11,467 --> 01:11:12,900
(Emphatic music)

1298
01:11:13,068 --> 01:11:15,036
Clay? We're back in business.

1299
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:18,103
You handle the
cross-examination tomorrow.

1300
01:11:18,307 --> 01:11:20,400
If I hustle, I can catch
the late flight to New York.

1301
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:23,778
Eberhart could save our ass.

1302
01:11:26,048 --> 01:11:30,985
A mistake could have been made
only by my source.

1303
01:11:31,153 --> 01:11:35,214
Dr Eberhart, I was unaware that there
was any source involved besides you.

1304
01:11:35,424 --> 01:11:38,757
You see, I assumed that you were
present when Jadway made the...

1305
01:11:38,927 --> 01:11:42,385
No, I was not.
My confidential source

1306
01:11:42,564 --> 01:11:47,501
was one of Jadway's closest friends
in Paris in the 1930s.

1307
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:51,504
- Who was he?
- Well, considering how I was misled...

1308
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:55,167
...l see no reason
not to reveal his name.

1309
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:59,905
I acquired the information from
a poet named Sean O'Flanagan.

1310
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:02,778
My name's Michael Barrett.
May I sit down?

1311
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:05,146
- Depends.
- Could I buy you a drink?

1312
01:12:06,021 --> 01:12:07,511
Grab a chair.

1313
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:14,351
Guinness, a flagon of your best brandy,
with a water back.

1314
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:16,996
What can I do for you, young man?

1315
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:19,259
Well, sir, I'm the lawyer
defending the reputation

1316
01:12:19,468 --> 01:12:21,766
of your old friend, J.J. Jadway.

1317
01:12:21,937 --> 01:12:23,529
<i>Oh yes, The Seven Minutes.</i>

1318
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:26,999
Dr Hiram Eberhart led me to believe

1319
01:12:27,209 --> 01:12:29,541
that you were one of
Jadway's closest friends.

1320
01:12:32,815 --> 01:12:36,478
Correct, young man. That's precisely
why I won't discuss this subject.

1321
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,119
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.

1322
01:12:39,288 --> 01:12:43,054
On the contrary, Mr O'Flanagan,
the censors won't let him rest.

1323
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:46,853
If I could only find out when
Jadway died, and how.

1324
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:51,227
Suicide. Jumped into the Grand Canal,
the poor wretched soul and drowned.

1325
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,061
- When was that?
- Allow me.

1326
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:57,638
The year of our Lord
1937 Anno Domini, amen.

1327
01:12:57,806 --> 01:13:01,537
Then there appears to be
a slight contradition

1328
01:13:01,744 --> 01:13:03,234
concerning the date
of Jadway's death,

1329
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:06,812
based on the material
that you supplied Dr Eberhart.

1330
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:09,540
Eberhart put it down wrong
and didn't hear me right.

1331
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:10,912
He taped the interview with you.

1332
01:13:11,086 --> 01:13:13,247
I guess I screwed up
my dates and times,

1333
01:13:13,489 --> 01:13:15,855
but I remember Jadway's death
as if it were yesterday.

1334
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:17,650
It was in all the papers.

1335
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:20,988
Hurled himself from a six-storey
apartment building in San Francisco.

1336
01:13:21,163 --> 01:13:23,256
A minute ago you had him
drowning in the Grand Canal.

1337
01:13:23,432 --> 01:13:24,330
Did I now?

1338
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:27,264
Could you have been mistaken
about the date of Jadway's death?

1339
01:13:27,503 --> 01:13:31,564
Maybe he died in 1939 or '40,
instead of 1937.

1340
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:34,834
That is not possible.
Jadway was alive long after that.

1341
01:13:35,043 --> 01:13:38,945
He enlisted the day after Pearl Harbor.
Made mincemeat of the Kaiser.

1342
01:13:39,114 --> 01:13:42,606
The Kaiser was World War I.

1343
01:13:42,785 --> 01:13:45,447
A pity you can't ask
Cassie McGraw about that.

1344
01:13:45,687 --> 01:13:46,915
Whatever happened to her?

1345
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:50,024
Only the shadow knows.
Good day to you, Mr Battle.

1346
01:13:57,699 --> 01:14:02,033
- Michael! Michael! Over here!
- Maggie!

1347
01:14:04,406 --> 01:14:05,566
Somebody once told me

1348
01:14:05,741 --> 01:14:07,538
that happiness is
being met at the airport.

1349
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:10,769
- I had to see you.
- You look great.

1350
01:14:11,246 --> 01:14:13,043
I thought you'd be interested
in what happened in court.

1351
01:14:13,248 --> 01:14:14,374
I spent the day in the gallery.

1352
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:15,742
You must be psychic.

1353
01:14:15,951 --> 01:14:17,885
Things were so tight
trying to make the plane

1354
01:14:18,086 --> 01:14:19,576
I didn't have a chance
to call the office.

1355
01:14:19,755 --> 01:14:21,586
Duncan brought out
two more literary experts,

1356
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:24,657
a professor from Colorado
and a syndicated book reviewer.

1357
01:14:24,893 --> 01:14:29,159
Both said the book was obscene and
put it down for its prurient appeal.

1358
01:14:29,398 --> 01:14:32,765
He also dragged in the two cops
who found Sheri Moore

1359
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:35,630
<i>and the physician who
examined her after the rape.</i>

1360
01:14:35,838 --> 01:14:38,807
<i>(Mike) I'm sure Clay didn't let Duncan get
away with cheap courtroom theatrics.</i>

1361
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:41,101
...evidence of sperm
within the vagina.

1362
01:14:41,276 --> 01:14:43,005
Objection!
The violation of Miss Moore

1363
01:14:43,245 --> 01:14:45,270
has nothing to do with
this alleged obscenity case!

1364
01:14:45,447 --> 01:14:49,178
Your Honour, the police witnesses are the
foundation for Jerry Griffith's appearance.

1365
01:14:49,418 --> 01:14:51,648
This is relevant and material,
because I will show

1366
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:53,651
that the obscene pages
from the Jadway book

1367
01:14:53,856 --> 01:14:56,290
created the wish to commit rape
within Jerry Griffith,

1368
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:58,153
and then drove him
to act out this wish.

1369
01:14:58,327 --> 01:14:59,794
<i>(Mike)
So w/I-lat else have I missed?</i>

1370
01:15:00,095 --> 01:15:02,928
<i>(Maggie) Well, for one thing you
have no idea of the conflict</i>

1371
01:15:03,131 --> 01:15:04,928
<i>going on at the house
over Jerry's testifying.</i>

1372
01:15:05,267 --> 01:15:06,598
<i>(Mike)
is he still resisting?</i>

1373
01:15:07,102 --> 01:15:11,129
I... I want to ask you not to put
Jerry on the witness stand.

1374
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:13,308
Before you say anything,
let me finish.

1375
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:17,343
<i>And I won't say "do it for me, Mike",
but for Jerry's sake alone</i>

1376
01:15:17,546 --> 01:15:20,845
please waive your cross-examination.

1377
01:15:21,049 --> 01:15:22,141
I'm sorry, Maggie,

1378
01:15:22,317 --> 01:15:24,478
<i>but I can't betray
the people who've retained me.</i>

1379
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:28,486
The D.A.'s had his own way so far,
and now he plans to prove the

1380
01:15:28,657 --> 01:15:31,854
<i>dangerous influence of Jadway's writing
by hitting us with Jeny Griffith.</i>

1381
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:34,893
<i>Now, this is our first
opportunity to stop him.</i>

1382
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:37,690
<i>(Maggie) But Jeny is paralysed with fear
over the cross-examination.</i>

1383
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:39,834
He might even try to take
his own life again.

1384
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:42,833
But if we don't defend ourselves here,
then we'll go under,

1385
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:45,905
and the censors strike another
important blow against free speech.

1386
01:15:46,141 --> 01:15:51,511
If I had Leroux, Mrs Vogler, even
a star witness like Cassie McGraw...

1387
01:15:51,713 --> 01:15:52,737
And you can have her, Mike.

1388
01:15:52,981 --> 01:15:55,176
You promise not to cross-examine Jerry

1389
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:56,180
and I promise to get you

1390
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:57,147
<i>Cassie McGraw herself.</i>

1391
01:15:57,319 --> 01:15:58,547
Please raise your right hand.

1392
01:15:58,754 --> 01:16:01,484
You swear to tell the truth and
nothing but the truth?

1393
01:16:01,657 --> 01:16:03,386
- I do.
- State your name for the record.

1394
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:05,493
Jerry, erm... Jerome Griffith.

1395
01:16:05,694 --> 01:16:06,854
Please be seated.

1396
01:16:16,004 --> 01:16:19,735
Jerry Griffith, may I ask
what is your present occupation?

1397
01:16:19,942 --> 01:16:22,035
- Student.
- Jerry, would you mind speaking up?

1398
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:23,575
- You said...
- I'm a student.

1399
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:24,837
How long have you been
at the university?

1400
01:16:25,013 --> 01:16:26,002
Almost two years.

1401
01:16:26,181 --> 01:16:29,446
Before this year... well, let's say
during your last year of high school,

1402
01:16:29,618 --> 01:16:31,415
your first two years of college,

1403
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:34,215
how frequently did you go on
dates with girls?

1404
01:16:34,389 --> 01:16:38,189
It's... it's hard to remember.
I can't remember how frequently.

1405
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:40,021
Well, can you give an approximation
of how frequently?

1406
01:16:40,195 --> 01:16:43,358
Objection, Your Honour. The witness
has stated that he does not remember.

1407
01:16:43,565 --> 01:16:45,726
I'm going to object
on the grounds that

1408
01:16:45,901 --> 01:16:49,200
the question has been asked and
answered. Also, it's speculative.

1409
01:16:49,371 --> 01:16:50,303
Objection sustained.

1410
01:16:51,139 --> 01:16:54,302
- Jerry, what is your major?
- English literature

1411
01:16:54,476 --> 01:16:56,273
Do your courses demand
considerable reading?

1412
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:57,878
Say at least three books a week?

1413
01:16:58,046 --> 01:17:00,412
Objection. The District Attorney
is leading the witness.

1414
01:17:00,582 --> 01:17:02,641
Overruled. The witness may
answer the question.

1415
01:17:02,818 --> 01:17:06,310
Thank you, Your Honour. ls it a fact that
you read at least three books a week?

1416
01:17:06,488 --> 01:17:07,420
Yes, sir.

1417
01:17:07,589 --> 01:17:09,147
Do you also read other books
on your own, so to speak?

1418
01:17:09,391 --> 01:17:12,827
That is, books not on the required list
for your English courses?

1419
01:17:12,995 --> 01:17:14,223
Yes, sir.

1420
01:17:15,063 --> 01:17:21,332
Have you ever read a book called
The Seven Minutes, by J.J. Jadway?

1421
01:17:21,503 --> 01:17:22,561
Yes, sir. I have.

1422
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:25,934
From cover to cover?
Every word of it?

1423
01:17:26,108 --> 01:17:27,769
- Yes, sir.
- What was your reaction to the book?

1424
01:17:27,943 --> 01:17:30,810
Objection! The witness's reaction
to the book is highly immaterial.

1425
01:17:31,013 --> 01:17:33,504
No evidence has been
produced by the prosecution

1426
01:17:33,749 --> 01:17:35,979
showing this witness to be
a literary expert.

1427
01:17:36,184 --> 01:17:38,948
Mr Griffith's reaction is
highly irrelevant, speculative,

1428
01:17:39,121 --> 01:17:41,954
and having nothing whatsoever to do
with the merits of this trial.

1429
01:17:42,124 --> 01:17:46,527
Mr Barrett, I must warn you against
making speeches for the jury's benefit.

1430
01:17:46,762 --> 01:17:48,957
I find the prosecutor's
line of questioning

1431
01:17:49,131 --> 01:17:51,258
to be highly probative
and material to the issue

1432
01:17:51,466 --> 01:17:53,696
of whether or not
The Seven Minutes is obscene.

1433
01:17:53,935 --> 01:17:58,463
The jury is admonished to disregard
defence counsel's argument before the court.

1434
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:01,836
You may proceed, Mr Duncan,

1435
01:18:02,044 --> 01:18:05,138
hopefully without any
interruptions from Mr Barrett.

1436
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:06,211
Thank you, Your Honour.

1437
01:18:07,949 --> 01:18:11,715
Jerry, what was your reaction to
the reading of The Seven Minutes?

1438
01:18:11,887 --> 01:18:14,617
- I was upset.
- What do you mean, upset?

1439
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:18,988
I was mixed up inside. All mixed up.
I couldn't sleep.

1440
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:20,287
Did you go to school the next day?

1441
01:18:20,462 --> 01:18:23,556
Yes, but I cut some of
my late afternoon classes.

1442
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:26,296
- Why?
- I had my mind on that book.

1443
01:18:26,468 --> 01:18:29,960
I kept it in my car,
and I drove around for a while,

1444
01:18:30,172 --> 01:18:32,402
and I found a lonely road
up in the hills

1445
01:18:32,641 --> 01:18:34,871
and I re-read parts of the book.

1446
01:18:35,043 --> 01:18:36,237
Can you recall what
sections you re-read?

1447
01:18:36,411 --> 01:18:37,901
I don't remember exactly...

1448
01:18:39,414 --> 01:18:40,847
Some of the first chapter,

1449
01:18:41,683 --> 01:18:43,810
the first of the seven minutes
in the story.

1450
01:18:44,519 --> 01:18:46,077
I read that several times.

1451
01:18:46,254 --> 01:18:51,556
- What was in those pages?
- I don't remember exactly.

1452
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:54,195
If I may refresh your memory
of that part, Jerry...

1453
01:19:02,604 --> 01:19:07,871
"She is lying naked, and she
thinks of the statues of Priapus

1454
01:19:08,076 --> 01:19:10,840
"that stood on some of
the streets of ancient Greece.

1455
01:19:11,046 --> 01:19:13,776
"Statues consisting of
a bust of a bearded man

1456
01:19:14,015 --> 01:19:16,506
"set on a stone basalt block,

1457
01:19:16,685 --> 01:19:20,883
"and out of the centre of this statue
there projected a giant phallus..."

1458
01:19:21,056 --> 01:19:23,456
I object to the prosecutor's
leading and suggestive reading

1459
01:19:23,625 --> 01:19:25,058
pointedly out of context.

1460
01:19:26,027 --> 01:19:28,359
Mr Duncan should be
conversant with the fact

1461
01:19:28,530 --> 01:19:30,896
that a work, whether it be
writing or motion pictures,

1462
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:33,124
must be considered as a whole,

1463
01:19:33,368 --> 01:19:36,269
particularly when the question of
obscenity hangs in the balance.

1464
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:39,930
Mr Barrett, my patience is
stretched to the breaking point.

1465
01:19:40,108 --> 01:19:42,440
The counsel for
the prosecution's reading

1466
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:44,579
is clearly and obviously foundational,

1467
01:19:44,746 --> 01:19:46,737
and will be followed
by a proper question.

1468
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:50,415
You will continue reading, Mr Duncan.

1469
01:19:50,585 --> 01:19:52,576
Thank you, Your Honour.

1470
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:57,157
"And out of the centre of this statue
there projected a giant phallus,"

1471
01:19:57,392 --> 01:20:00,418
and then Kathleen thinks
how lucky she is,

1472
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:03,291
and she stared at the
unnamed hero of the book,

1473
01:20:03,498 --> 01:20:07,161
and the first of
her seven minutes begins.

1474
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:11,769
Now Jerry, do you recognise that
as the part you re-read several times?

1475
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:13,941
- Yes, sir.
- Did you feel at the time

1476
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:17,943
- it was artistic writing?
- I didn't think about the writing.

1477
01:20:18,113 --> 01:20:19,478
Face the court, Jerry.

1478
01:20:19,681 --> 01:20:23,082
Do you feel the author was trying
nothing more than excite the reader?

1479
01:20:23,251 --> 01:20:25,651
Your Honour, I'm sorry,
but I must object

1480
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:28,847
to the District Attorney's constant
leading and suggestive questioning.

1481
01:20:29,090 --> 01:20:31,115
This examination is
highly inflammatory

1482
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:32,418
and I ask to approach the bench

1483
01:20:32,627 --> 01:20:35,596
to discuss the relevance
of this one-sided interrogation.

1484
01:20:35,797 --> 01:20:39,255
Mr Barrett, I find the prosecutor's
questioning to be quite pertinent.

1485
01:20:39,467 --> 01:20:43,699
The bench will not tolerate
any more interference from you.

1486
01:20:43,939 --> 01:20:46,772
If you persist, you'll be held
in contempt of court.

1487
01:20:46,975 --> 01:20:49,136
Now let us proceed with the trial.

1488
01:20:49,311 --> 01:20:52,940
Thank you, Your Honour. Have the court
reporter repeat the last question.

1489
01:20:53,114 --> 01:20:54,479
You are instructed to do so.

1490
01:20:59,621 --> 01:21:01,213
- Question by Mr Duncan.
- (Loud shuffling of papers)

1491
01:21:01,456 --> 01:21:04,653
Did you feel that the author
was trying to do anything more

1492
01:21:04,826 --> 01:21:06,521
- than excite the reader?
- N0.

1493
01:21:06,828 --> 01:21:09,058
Did this passage
and other passages excite you?

1494
01:21:09,898 --> 01:21:11,058
Yes, sir.

1495
01:21:11,633 --> 01:21:13,828
In what way did this
excitement manifest itself?

1496
01:21:14,002 --> 01:21:16,334
(Suspenseful music)

1497
01:21:16,538 --> 01:21:20,167
Physically.
I wanted to have a girl.

1498
01:21:20,342 --> 01:21:22,242
You mean you wanted to have
sexual intercourse with a girl?

1499
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:23,741
- Yes, sir.
- With some particular girl,

1500
01:21:23,912 --> 01:21:26,403
<i>'</i> °“S' any girl?
<i>'</i> Any girl.

1501
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:28,708
- What did you do next?
- It was night time.

1502
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:32,649
I drove to the club,
and I drank a couple of beers.

1503
01:21:32,854 --> 01:21:36,551
There was this one chick, she looked
just like what I imagined Kathleen...

1504
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:38,590
(Elmo) Kathleen, the heroine of
The Seven Minutes?

1505
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:43,595
- Right. Anyhow, I offered her a ride.
- By "her", do you mean Sheri Moore?

1506
01:21:43,765 --> 01:21:47,360
Right. S0 I drove her to her
apartment, and walked upstairs.

1507
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:50,595
<i>And when she opened the door,
I pushed her inside.</i>

1508
01:21:50,772 --> 01:21:53,536
- You did this how'?
- I had a knife.

1509
01:21:53,708 --> 01:21:55,232
I see. Did she undress?

1510
01:21:55,777 --> 01:21:58,041
She was scared, so she undressed.

1511
01:21:58,213 --> 01:22:00,579
- What happened next?
- I don't remember.

1512
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:03,274
It went kind of crazy like it wasn't
my own mind any more.

1513
01:22:03,451 --> 01:22:05,885
Like it was Jadway's mind.
Please continue, Jerry.

1514
01:22:06,054 --> 01:22:08,750
- I forced myself on her.
- Did she resist?

1515
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:11,552
- Yes.
- But you violated her anyway?

1516
01:22:11,726 --> 01:22:12,954
I didn't know what I was doing.

1517
01:22:13,128 --> 01:22:14,720
Did you think of
The Seven Minutes at all?

1518
01:22:14,896 --> 01:22:17,126
When she was naked, yes.
Then I don't remember after that.

1519
01:22:17,365 --> 01:22:20,562
Except that I did it.
I couldn't help doing it.

1520
01:22:20,735 --> 01:22:23,761
And during the course of the sex act,
Miss Moore was injured?

1521
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:26,931
It was after,
when I was trying to dress.

1522
01:22:28,109 --> 01:22:32,375
She tried to hit me, and get my knife.
I don't remember which.

1523
01:22:34,215 --> 01:22:38,948
And lthink...
somehow she slipped and fell.

1524
01:22:39,154 --> 01:22:41,452
It was an accident.

1525
01:22:41,623 --> 01:22:43,557
Did you know Miss Moore
was unconscious?

1526
01:22:44,092 --> 01:22:46,287
I don't remember if I knew it or not.

1527
01:22:46,494 --> 01:22:49,759
I only knew she had a roommate
who might be coming back soon,

1528
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:54,925
so ljust left. I felt miserable.
I... lwanted to kill myself.

1529
01:22:55,136 --> 01:22:57,070
Because this wasn't me,
what I had done.

1530
01:22:58,673 --> 01:23:02,973
It wasn't my fault.
I didn't know what I was doing.

1531
01:23:04,446 --> 01:23:06,471
Have you ever in your life...

1532
01:23:07,515 --> 01:23:10,643
- ...behaved this way before?
- N0, sir.

1533
01:23:11,753 --> 01:23:15,780
Do you definitely feel the obscene
pages in that book inflamed you

1534
01:23:15,957 --> 01:23:18,448
until you were impelled
to commit a criminal act?

1535
01:23:18,626 --> 01:23:21,424
Yes, sir. I can't explain
any other reason for it.

1536
01:23:21,596 --> 01:23:26,465
Jerry, I want you to listen to me,
and listen to me carefully.

1537
01:23:26,668 --> 01:23:31,435
From your own experience, do you
believe there's a cause and effect...

1538
01:23:31,639 --> 01:23:34,767
now understand me,
cause and effect relationship

1539
01:23:34,976 --> 01:23:38,776
between pornographic books
and violent acts of crime?

1540
01:23:38,947 --> 01:23:43,975
I... I only know...
only know what happened.

1541
01:23:44,452 --> 01:23:47,785
It happened to me.
(Choking sobs)

1542
01:23:49,224 --> 01:23:50,987
No further questions, Your Honour.

1543
01:24:08,076 --> 01:24:10,306
The defence has no questions,
Your Honour.

1544
01:24:10,512 --> 01:24:13,310
- (incredulous hubbub)
- Mr Barrett, you mean you wish

1545
01:24:13,481 --> 01:24:15,574
to reserve your
cross-examination for laten'?

1546
01:24:15,817 --> 01:24:17,580
I mean, as far as
the defence is concerned,

1547
01:24:17,819 --> 01:24:20,845
the witness may be
permanently excused.

1548
01:24:21,222 --> 01:24:24,089
We will take a two-hour recess
for lunch. (Bangs gavel)

1549
01:24:29,697 --> 01:24:31,494
Hey, Barrett, why didn't you
cross-examine the kid?

1550
01:24:31,666 --> 01:24:32,564
No comment.

1551
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:34,565
Have you thrown in the towel,
Mr Barrett?

1552
01:24:34,736 --> 01:24:35,896
No comment.

1553
01:24:36,538 --> 01:24:38,005
"If you can't stand the heat,
get out of the kitchen."

1554
01:24:38,206 --> 01:24:39,673
- Was the heat too hot for you?
- Fuck off.

1555
01:24:42,177 --> 01:24:44,577
(Clay) You still haven't answered me.
What the hell happened back there?

1556
01:24:44,746 --> 01:24:47,237
(Mike) I traded off the
cross-examination of Jerry Griffith

1557
01:24:47,449 --> 01:24:49,917
for the examination of
the legendary Cassie McGraw.

1558
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:50,915
(Clay) You mean she's alive?

1559
01:24:51,119 --> 01:24:52,848
(Mike) She's very much alive
and, what's more,

1560
01:24:53,021 --> 01:24:55,387
- we have an opportunity to use her.
- Who'd she make a deal with?

1561
01:24:55,557 --> 01:24:57,855
(Mike) Maggie Russell. Cassie read
about the trial in the paper,

1562
01:24:58,026 --> 01:25:00,119
wrote to Frank Griffith
in defence of Jadway,

1563
01:25:00,361 --> 01:25:03,558
Maggie intercepted the postcard
and kept it hidden for two weeks.

1564
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:04,925
I'm gonna see it later today.

1565
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:06,192
(Clay) You gotta be kidding!

1566
01:25:06,534 --> 01:25:09,469
You mean, you traded away Jerry
for something scrawled on a postcard?

1567
01:25:09,704 --> 01:25:11,194
Something you haven't even seen?

1568
01:25:11,406 --> 01:25:13,135
And what if the whole trade
was a con job

1569
01:25:13,308 --> 01:25:15,868
engineered by Maggie
on behalf of the Griffith family?

1570
01:25:16,044 --> 01:25:19,104
- (Mike) Hey, I've got faith in Maggie!
- OK, man, you keep the faith.

1571
01:25:19,547 --> 01:25:20,980
(Mike) Look at the other
side of it, man.

1572
01:25:21,149 --> 01:25:24,380
Cassie McGraw for the defence
would be a sensation.

1573
01:25:24,552 --> 01:25:26,486
(Clay) When is Maggie supposed
to turn over this postcard?

1574
01:25:26,654 --> 01:25:27,916
(Mike) Some time later today.

1575
01:25:28,089 --> 01:25:29,750
S0 you'd better call
the sequence from the start.

1576
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:36,427
...and to the best of your recollection,
you have not omitted any pertinent facts

1577
01:25:36,631 --> 01:25:38,997
surrounding your arrest
at the Argus Book Store

1578
01:25:39,234 --> 01:25:41,429
by Sergeant Kellog of
the County Sheriffs Office?

1579
01:25:41,603 --> 01:25:44,595
- N0, sir.
- Your witness.

1580
01:25:44,772 --> 01:25:46,296
Were you previously arrested

1581
01:25:46,474 --> 01:25:50,467
under the terms of the
California Penal Code, Section 311.2?

1582
01:25:51,012 --> 01:25:56,348
The section stating that everyone who
knowingly distributes obscene material

1583
01:25:56,518 --> 01:25:58,782
- is guilty of a misdemeanour?
- Yes.

1584
01:26:00,088 --> 01:26:02,022
- Did you plead not guilty?
- N0.

1585
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:04,522
Did you plead guilty of
selling obscene material?

1586
01:26:04,759 --> 01:26:06,954
Yes, but only on the advice
of my attorney.

1587
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:10,097
He said if I pleaded guilty
I would get a lighter sentence.

1588
01:26:10,265 --> 01:26:11,630
- But you admitted guilt?
- Yes, I did.

1589
01:26:11,799 --> 01:26:13,596
- Did you pay a fine?
- Yes.

1590
01:26:13,768 --> 01:26:16,430
- Did you go tojail?
- N0. The sentence was suspended.

1591
01:26:16,604 --> 01:26:18,333
Are you aware
that a second offence

1592
01:26:18,540 --> 01:26:20,974
- is not a misdemeanour, but a felony?
- Yes.

1593
01:26:21,142 --> 01:26:22,837
Are you cognisant of the fact

1594
01:26:23,044 --> 01:26:24,773
that you can go to jail for a year

1595
01:26:24,979 --> 01:26:27,539
- and be fined up to $25,000?
- Yes, I am.

1596
01:26:27,715 --> 01:26:30,183
Are you aware that the publisher,
the Sanford House,

1597
01:26:31,553 --> 01:26:35,182
<i>pandered The Seven Minutes</i>
with <i>this garish poster</i>

1598
01:26:35,390 --> 01:26:37,824
prominently displayed in front
of the Argus Book Store?

1599
01:26:37,992 --> 01:26:40,688
But there were other quotes
on similar advertising,

1600
01:26:40,895 --> 01:26:43,125
that described it as
a distinguished work of art.

1601
01:26:43,798 --> 01:26:45,288
No further questions, Your Honour.

1602
01:26:45,466 --> 01:26:47,957
When Sanford House contracted
for The <i>Seven</i> Minutes,

1603
01:26:48,169 --> 01:26:52,299
were you worried about it violating
existing obscenity laws?

1604
01:26:52,473 --> 01:26:56,136
Not really, because I considered
the book to be beautiful and touching.

1605
01:26:56,344 --> 01:27:00,872
It's too well done to appeal
to s0meone's prurient interest alone.

1606
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:05,816
Do you consider the book to be beyond
the customary limits of candour

1607
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:08,250
by contemporary community standards?

1608
01:27:08,423 --> 01:27:12,689
Certainly not. In fact, it's
relatively mild by today's standards.

1609
01:27:12,894 --> 01:27:18,389
When you consider that motion pictures
and stage plays offer nudity, copulation,

1610
01:27:18,566 --> 01:27:23,833
oral-genital love, masturbation,
homosexuality, lesbianism...

1611
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:27,166
community standards
have radically changed.

1612
01:27:27,575 --> 01:27:28,769
Your witness, Mr Duncan.

1613
01:27:31,246 --> 01:27:36,775
Mr Sanford, I have before me
news clippings

1614
01:27:37,018 --> 01:27:39,680
<i>from the New York Times
and the Wall Street Journal,</i>

1615
01:27:39,887 --> 01:27:43,220
which note the
shaky financial position

1616
01:27:43,424 --> 01:27:45,949
of Sanford House
in the last two years.

1617
01:27:46,194 --> 01:27:49,220
Are these news accounts
substantially true?

1618
01:27:49,530 --> 01:27:50,588
Yes .

1619
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:52,562
- (Elmo) In short, since you took over...
- (Quietly) Excuse me, Mr Barrett.

1620
01:27:52,734 --> 01:27:54,895
Miss Maggie Russell wants you
to meet her right away.

1621
01:27:55,103 --> 01:27:57,936
- (Elmo) ...as it has in the past.
- Did she say where?

1622
01:27:58,106 --> 01:27:59,471
She said you'd know.

1623
01:27:59,641 --> 01:28:01,108
<i>(Sanford) That depends on what
you mean by "doing well".</i>

1624
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:06,213
<i>Uh... it is true that the firm's
book sales, uh... have gone dovlm...</i>

1625
01:28:06,381 --> 01:28:08,042
<i>(Elmo) Perhaps you were
desperate enough</i>

1626
01:28:08,216 --> 01:28:09,945
to ignore your fathefis
previous good taste,

1627
01:28:10,151 --> 01:28:12,244
and tried to save your
position in the firm

1628
01:28:12,453 --> 01:28:15,616
by publishing an obscene book?

1629
01:28:17,158 --> 01:28:19,558
- (Tyres screech)
- What's going on?

1630
01:28:19,727 --> 01:28:21,752
I've made a real mess of everything!

1631
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:24,796
Uncle Frank heard from Yerkes
that we were seeing each other.

1632
01:28:24,999 --> 01:28:27,297
Apparently he's known of
our relationship for some time,

1633
01:28:27,502 --> 01:28:31,302
but my rising to your defence over
Jerry's well-being flipped him out.

1634
01:28:31,506 --> 01:28:33,838
He told me to pack up and leave,
he took my key

1635
01:28:34,075 --> 01:28:37,408
and waited until I was outside on the
front drive before slamming the door.

1636
01:28:37,612 --> 01:28:40,308
S0 I lugged my things over here
from across the street.

1637
01:28:40,481 --> 01:28:41,914
And the postcard
from Cassie McGraw

1638
01:28:42,116 --> 01:28:43,413
- is still in his desk?
- I'm sorry.

1639
01:28:43,584 --> 01:28:45,108
Now you had to give up
your key, right?

1640
01:28:45,286 --> 01:28:46,446
The key to the front door, yes.

1641
01:28:46,654 --> 01:28:48,849
But not the one to
the rear service porch.

1642
01:28:49,924 --> 01:28:51,687
Then we're just going to
have to sweat him out.

1643
01:28:51,926 --> 01:28:54,087
Because I gotta get my hands
on that postcard.

1644
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:56,797
- Mike, my bags!
- (Brakes squeal)

1645
01:29:18,853 --> 01:29:21,219
- (Maggie) What time is it?
- 9:15.

1646
01:29:23,124 --> 01:29:24,523
(Maggie)
Wait, the light went out.

1647
01:29:24,692 --> 01:29:26,853
There's Uncle Frank,
coming out the door.

1648
01:29:31,666 --> 01:29:34,533
(Car door shuts,
engine starts)

1649
01:29:40,641 --> 01:29:42,131
In we go.

1650
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:44,972
(Music becomes more dramatic)

1651
01:29:48,483 --> 01:29:49,916
Oh, damn it!

1652
01:29:54,422 --> 01:29:56,322
(Tyres squeal)

1653
01:29:58,693 --> 01:30:00,490
Get it fast.
I'll go out in the street.

1654
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:06,226
(Brakes squeal)

1655
01:30:12,874 --> 01:30:14,671
What the hell are you
doing in my driveway?

1656
01:30:14,876 --> 01:30:16,104
You could have got us both killed!

1657
01:30:16,277 --> 01:30:18,575
Look, sir, I'm sorry. I came by
to see Miss Russell, and...

1658
01:30:18,746 --> 01:30:20,714
Well, Miss Russell
doesn't live here any more.

1659
01:30:20,915 --> 01:30:23,179
Now you get your
lousy crate out of my driveway.

1660
01:30:24,218 --> 01:30:26,015
I oughta put guys like you away.

1661
01:30:29,891 --> 01:30:32,451
You son of a bitch,
what the hell are you doing here?

1662
01:30:32,693 --> 01:30:34,285
Spying on me and my son?

1663
01:30:34,529 --> 01:30:37,396
Come on, get out of the car
and say something, you bastard.

1664
01:30:37,565 --> 01:30:38,862
You're not in court now.

1665
01:30:39,033 --> 01:30:43,629
Oh, I'd really like to clobber you,
but you're not suckering me into that.

1666
01:30:45,873 --> 01:30:47,738
Now you get your ass outta here.

1667
01:30:47,942 --> 01:30:50,968
If you're still snooping around
after I've parked my car,

1668
01:30:51,212 --> 01:30:52,941
I'm gonna kick
the living hell out of you.

1669
01:30:53,147 --> 01:30:55,411
Then I'll turn you over
to the cops for prowling.

1670
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:57,049
How does that grab ya?

1671
01:31:01,589 --> 01:31:04,615
(Both engines start)

1672
01:31:11,666 --> 01:31:13,258
(Tyres squeal)

1673
01:31:17,839 --> 01:31:20,239
(Maggie gasps)
That was a close call.

1674
01:31:20,408 --> 01:31:23,309
(Mike) Let's get the hell out of here
before I get my ass kicked.

1675
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:29,980
(Tyres squeal)

1676
01:31:36,023 --> 01:31:37,251
Well?

1677
01:31:42,630 --> 01:31:46,532
It's... beautiful.

1678
01:31:47,435 --> 01:31:50,461
If Cassie McGraw backs up in court
what she says in this postcard,

1679
01:31:51,706 --> 01:31:54,300
the defence finally
has a star witness.

1680
01:31:54,509 --> 01:31:58,104
Now, where can I take you before
I catch the next plane to Chicago?

1681
01:31:58,813 --> 01:32:00,974
I was hoping you'd take me home.

1682
01:32:01,182 --> 01:32:03,548
- Home?
- With you?

1683
01:32:03,851 --> 01:32:05,842
(Lush, romantic music)

1684
01:32:10,625 --> 01:32:15,028
If Jadway were alive today,
he'd be in his late 50s or early 60s.

1685
01:32:15,196 --> 01:32:18,222
This woman is at least
15 or 20 years older.

1686
01:32:18,399 --> 01:32:20,128
Like all the old people
in this sanitarium,

1687
01:32:20,334 --> 01:32:22,666
I never think of Katie
in terms of years.

1688
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:26,362
That reminds me of something.
As long as I've been here,

1689
01:32:26,574 --> 01:32:29,372
and that's going on five years,
Katie's been getting flowers.

1690
01:32:29,577 --> 01:32:32,512
Once a year, always on her birthday.

1691
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:35,148
- Who sends Cassie the flowers?
- I don't know.

1692
01:32:35,316 --> 01:32:38,251
They're wired from Ryan's Flowers,
in Oakwood, California.

1693
01:32:38,419 --> 01:32:40,148
(Phone rings)

1694
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:46,852
- Hello?
- Hi, Maggie.

1695
01:32:47,028 --> 01:32:49,656
Mike, I was praying it would be you.

1696
01:32:49,830 --> 01:32:51,195
<i>Have you heard?</i>

1697
01:32:51,365 --> 01:32:53,196
I mean about Sheri Moore?
She died in her sleep.

1698
01:32:53,367 --> 01:32:56,427
Yeah, ljust finished
reading the story.

1699
01:32:56,604 --> 01:32:59,664
- Are things any better in Chicago?
- It couldn't be worse.

1700
01:33:01,108 --> 01:33:03,440
Cassie McGraw will never speak
on the witness stand.

1701
01:33:03,678 --> 01:33:05,612
<i>The poor woman's senile.</i>

1702
01:33:06,581 --> 01:33:09,948
- What a lousy break.
- She has moments when she's lucid,

1703
01:33:10,551 --> 01:33:14,180
like when she wrote the postcard,
but today wasn't one of them.

1704
01:33:14,355 --> 01:33:17,017
I'm awfully sorry, Mike.
All that trouble for nothing.

1705
01:33:17,191 --> 01:33:20,024
- Chicago may not be a total loss.
- How do you mean?

1706
01:33:20,194 --> 01:33:21,855
She receives roses every year
on her birthday.

1707
01:33:22,063 --> 01:33:24,224
A standing order from Ryan's Flowers.

1708
01:33:24,432 --> 01:33:27,299
I called Clay, he's gonna check on it
first thing tomorrow.

1709
01:33:27,468 --> 01:33:28,730
Mike, I might be able to help you.

1710
01:33:28,936 --> 01:33:30,733
When I was working as
Frank Griffith's secretary,

1711
01:33:30,938 --> 01:33:33,372
<i>- we dealt exclusively with that florist.
- S0?</i>

1712
01:33:33,541 --> 01:33:35,406
Why don't you let me get in touch
with them? I'd love to help.

1713
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:39,546
Miss Cumberland, I'll bet you're
wondering why I'm here.

1714
01:33:39,714 --> 01:33:41,113
Yes, as a matter of fact, I am.

1715
01:33:41,282 --> 01:33:42,874
Well, the Griffiths have
a lot to do with it.

1716
01:33:43,084 --> 01:33:45,416
I'm terribly concerned
about Jerry Griffith.

1717
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:48,145
You know, the boy who's involved
in the obscenity trial?

1718
01:33:48,322 --> 01:33:50,756
Yes. I watched it on
the news last night.

1719
01:33:50,925 --> 01:33:52,586
It might sound strange to you,

1720
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:55,558
but one of my good friends,
and I trust him implicitly,

1721
01:33:55,730 --> 01:33:58,221
is Michael Barrett,
the defence attorney in the case.

1722
01:33:58,399 --> 01:34:00,060
He's a very attractive
young man indeed.

1723
01:34:00,234 --> 01:34:04,102
He genuinely believes that Jadway's
The Seven Minutes is not obscene.

1724
01:34:04,305 --> 01:34:08,401
Anyway, he's been racing all over
the country trying to find witnesses

1725
01:34:08,576 --> 01:34:11,602
who knew Jadway or who
had some insight into his motives.

1726
01:34:11,779 --> 01:34:15,579
He just visited with
Cassie McGraw in Chicago.

1727
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:16,614
Oh, really?

1728
01:34:16,784 --> 01:34:22,313
- You're familiar with Ryan's Flowers?
- Well, yes.

1729
01:34:22,857 --> 01:34:26,850
- Mike asked me to check their records.
- Did he?

1730
01:34:27,028 --> 01:34:29,428
I was surprised to learn that,
for the past ten years,

1731
01:34:29,630 --> 01:34:32,963
you have been paying for
Cassie McGraw's birthday flowers.

1732
01:34:33,134 --> 01:34:36,763
- How enterprising of you.
- How well did you know Cassie McGraw'?

1733
01:34:38,205 --> 01:34:42,869
Cassie McG raw was my private secretary
when I lived and worked in Paris,

1734
01:34:43,044 --> 01:34:46,673
ooh, 35 years ago. At that time,
she was my only friend.

1735
01:34:48,315 --> 01:34:50,442
Very few people know about Cassie,

1736
01:34:50,651 --> 01:34:53,484
or about any of my life
at the time, for that matter.

1737
01:34:54,889 --> 01:34:56,720
Much of it was not terribly pleasant.

1738
01:34:56,957 --> 01:34:59,221
Through the years,
I've managed to keep it concealed.

1739
01:34:59,393 --> 01:35:00,621
But why?

1740
01:35:00,795 --> 01:35:03,457
You know of my longstanding
friendship with the Griffiths.

1741
01:35:03,664 --> 01:35:05,655
Especially Frank's late wife.

1742
01:35:05,866 --> 01:35:10,496
It was difficult to hide my contempt
of his behaviour toward his son Jerry.

1743
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:17,577
Now, it's my turn
to stand up and be counted.

1744
01:35:17,845 --> 01:35:21,508
(Raunchy, va-va-voom music)

1745
01:35:29,523 --> 01:35:30,751
Thank you, Baby Doll.

1746
01:35:31,559 --> 01:35:34,187
It's in the bag. We don't even need
the chippie's creaking.

1747
01:35:34,361 --> 01:35:36,693
Elmo can't buy that newspaper
and the TV exposure.

1748
01:35:36,864 --> 01:35:38,593
It also opens up
a whole new can of peas.

1749
01:35:38,833 --> 01:35:41,028
We now have a case
of murder one as well.

1750
01:35:41,202 --> 01:35:42,396
We're gonna anticipate
a probability factor

1751
01:35:42,603 --> 01:35:43,695
of at least 90% for conviction.

1752
01:35:43,871 --> 01:35:44,895
Whose? Jerry's?

1753
01:35:45,372 --> 01:35:47,772
I think the Griffith name
has been muck-raked enough.

1754
01:35:47,942 --> 01:35:51,002
Oh, relax, Frank.
It's not your boy that's on trial.

1755
01:35:51,212 --> 01:35:53,840
It's that obscene book,
together with that Ben Fremont,

1756
01:35:54,048 --> 01:35:54,912
that purveyor of filth.

1757
01:35:55,116 --> 01:35:57,550
The slut's death is just
icing on the cake.

1758
01:35:59,954 --> 01:36:03,219
Frankly, I am more than
a little bit concerned

1759
01:36:03,424 --> 01:36:05,255
at the turn of events.

1760
01:36:06,861 --> 01:36:08,886
It's a brand new ball game
with Sheri Moore's death.

1761
01:36:09,063 --> 01:36:11,623
Well, if it's any consolation,
there's the closing argument

1762
01:36:11,866 --> 01:36:14,562
Mike dictated about four this morning.

1763
01:36:14,769 --> 01:36:19,229
Let's pick up on it.
It might give us a shot in the arm.

1764
01:36:20,608 --> 01:36:23,076
<i>(Mike) Supreme Court Justice Douglas
once said</i>

1765
01:36:23,277 --> 01:36:28,044
<i>"The idea of using censors to bar
thoughts of sex is dangerous.</i>

1766
01:36:28,249 --> 01:36:31,241
<i>"A person without sex thoughts
is abnormal.</i>

1767
01:36:31,452 --> 01:36:34,888
<i>"Sex thoughts may
induce sex practices that...</i>

1768
01:36:35,089 --> 01:36:37,489
<i>"...make for better
marital relations.</i>

1769
01:36:37,725 --> 01:36:40,819
<i>"Sex thoughts that
make love more atiractive</i>

1770
01:36:41,061 --> 01:36:44,792
<i>"certainly should not be outlawed.
lf the illicit is included,</i>

1771
01:36:44,965 --> 01:36:48,230
<i>"that should make
no constitutional difference."</i>

1772
01:36:52,439 --> 01:36:55,431
Your Honour, I call
Constance Cumberland to the stand.

1773
01:36:55,676 --> 01:36:58,509
(Gasps of astonishment)

1774
01:37:08,923 --> 01:37:11,153
Please raise your right hand.
Do you solemnly swear

1775
01:37:11,325 --> 01:37:13,122
to tell the truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

1776
01:37:13,294 --> 01:37:15,091
- I do.
- State your name for the record.

1777
01:37:15,262 --> 01:37:17,457
- Constance Cumberland.
- Please be seated.

1778
01:37:22,036 --> 01:37:24,436
Miss Cumberland,
what is your present occupation?

1779
01:37:24,605 --> 01:37:28,200
I'm an actress. I have been
an actress for some 35 years,

1780
01:37:28,442 --> 01:37:31,468
in motion pictures
and most recently on television.

1781
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:33,977
How do you occupy yourself
away from camera?

1782
01:37:34,181 --> 01:37:36,547
Well, if you mean
what organisations do I belong to,

1783
01:37:36,784 --> 01:37:39,719
I'm a working member
of the League for Women Voters,

1784
01:37:39,954 --> 01:37:43,355
the Reiss-Davis Centre
for emotionally disturbed children,

1785
01:37:43,524 --> 01:37:45,788
and occasionally
I've given my public support

1786
01:37:45,993 --> 01:37:47,984
to the
Strength Through Decency League.

1787
01:37:48,195 --> 01:37:52,564
Because, like anyone else
with concern about today's society,

1788
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:54,358
I'm against pornography.

1789
01:37:54,568 --> 01:37:57,366
Mainly because of the way
it appeals to the young people

1790
01:37:57,571 --> 01:38:00,734
who aren't mature enough
to understand its implications.

1791
01:38:00,908 --> 01:38:02,808
Did you ever write
and publish any books?

1792
01:38:02,977 --> 01:38:05,002
- I did.
- Were they works of fiction?

1793
01:38:05,179 --> 01:38:07,647
Some sceptics probably
suggested as much...

1794
01:38:07,815 --> 01:38:08,543
(Laughter)

1795
01:38:08,716 --> 01:38:12,379
...but I consider my autobiography
to be a work of complete truth.

1796
01:38:12,653 --> 01:38:16,350
What I mean is, everything
that I published was honest.

1797
01:38:16,523 --> 01:38:19,014
That doesn't mean
I published everything.

1798
01:38:19,193 --> 01:38:20,888
(Laughter)

1799
01:38:21,061 --> 01:38:23,256
Are you acquainted with
the classical and modern fiction?

1800
01:38:23,430 --> 01:38:26,831
As a reader, yes I am.
Classical and modern.

1801
01:38:27,034 --> 01:38:28,001
And also as an actress.

1802
01:38:28,202 --> 01:38:31,694
I wouldn't want to bore the court
with my credits, but...

1803
01:38:31,872 --> 01:38:32,861
Have you ever read a novel

1804
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:35,338
entitled The Seven Minutes,
by J.J. Jadway?

1805
01:38:35,509 --> 01:38:37,739
- I have, sir.
- Have you read it more than once?

1806
01:38:37,912 --> 01:38:39,243
I've read it many, many times.

1807
01:38:39,446 --> 01:38:41,937
How recently have you read
the book in its entirety?

1808
01:38:42,116 --> 01:38:43,674
As recently as last night.

1809
01:38:44,084 --> 01:38:47,713
Are you familiar with section 311.2
of the California Penal Code?

1810
01:38:47,888 --> 01:38:48,547
Iam.

1811
01:38:48,722 --> 01:38:52,920
<i>Do you know that The Seven Minutes
is being charged as obscene matter</i>

1812
01:38:53,127 --> 01:38:54,253
under that section of the Code?

1813
01:38:54,428 --> 01:38:55,224
I do know that.

1814
01:38:55,396 --> 01:38:58,092
<i>Do you consider The Seven Minutes
to be an obscene</i> book?

1815
01:38:58,265 --> 01:38:59,254
Just a moment, Miss Cumberland.

1816
01:38:59,466 --> 01:39:02,765
Your Honour, I object
to defence counsel's question.

1817
01:39:02,970 --> 01:39:04,733
No foundation has been
laid to establish

1818
01:39:04,939 --> 01:39:07,874
Miss Cumberland's qualifications
to render such an opinion.

1819
01:39:08,042 --> 01:39:10,306
With all due respect
to the acting abilities

1820
01:39:10,544 --> 01:39:13,240
and other impressive credentials
possessed by Miss Cumberland,

1821
01:39:13,447 --> 01:39:16,974
I cannot imagine what bearing
her opinion on the merits of this book

1822
01:39:17,217 --> 01:39:18,377
could possibly have
upon the proceedings.

1823
01:39:18,585 --> 01:39:20,450
Your Honour, I would like
to approach the bench.

1824
01:39:20,621 --> 01:39:22,486
Both attorneys shall
approach the bench.

1825
01:39:30,097 --> 01:39:33,828
Mr Barrett, I'm concerned with your
examination of Miss Cumberland.

1826
01:39:34,068 --> 01:39:36,002
It appears you are seeking
to elicit from this witness

1827
01:39:36,236 --> 01:39:38,101
an opinion which
she is not entitled to give.

1828
01:39:38,305 --> 01:39:42,105
Mr Duncan has properly interposed an
objection which I mean to sustain.

1829
01:39:42,276 --> 01:39:44,141
Your Honour, if I may interrupt
forjust a moment.

1830
01:39:44,345 --> 01:39:46,745
I assure you that
Miss Cumberland's testimony

1831
01:39:46,947 --> 01:39:48,346
is critical to the defence case.
I can...

1832
01:39:48,582 --> 01:39:51,642
Your Honour, I feel defence counsel
is testing the court's patience.

1833
01:39:51,819 --> 01:39:54,310
Let him who is without sin
cast the first stone.

1834
01:39:54,488 --> 01:39:55,750
Don't you come on strong with me.

1835
01:39:55,923 --> 01:39:58,289
Gentlemen, will you restrain
yourselves from this bickering?

1836
01:39:58,492 --> 01:40:01,256
Now, Mr Barrett,
I have the greatest admiration

1837
01:40:01,428 --> 01:40:04,591
for Miss Cumberland as an actress,
but I fail to see what credentials

1838
01:40:04,765 --> 01:40:07,131
she possesses which enables her
to render an opinion concerning

1839
01:40:07,334 --> 01:40:11,771
The Seven Minutes, unless
she is a qualified literary expert,

1840
01:40:11,939 --> 01:40:15,170
and apparently she is not, because
you have not qualified her as such.

1841
01:40:15,342 --> 01:40:17,503
Therefore she cannot give
an expert opinion.

1842
01:40:17,678 --> 01:40:18,940
Your Honour, it is very...

1843
01:40:19,113 --> 01:40:21,172
Just a moment, Mr Duncan.
I want to hear from the defence.

1844
01:40:21,348 --> 01:40:23,145
I represent to you
as an officer of the court

1845
01:40:23,350 --> 01:40:26,148
that you will find this testimony
to be extremely relevant

1846
01:40:26,353 --> 01:40:27,718
and material to the def...

1847
01:40:27,888 --> 01:40:30,482
Let him make an offer of proof as to
the nature of this so-called material.

1848
01:40:30,657 --> 01:40:31,851
Do you have an offer of proof to make?

1849
01:40:32,026 --> 01:40:34,551
Your Honour, if I'm forced to make
an offer of proof at this time,

1850
01:40:34,795 --> 01:40:37,992
the court is requiring me to disclose
my defence to the prosecution,

1851
01:40:38,198 --> 01:40:40,632
in violation of my client's
constitutional rights.

1852
01:40:40,834 --> 01:40:44,702
This I respectfully refuse to do.
If the court will just bear with me,

1853
01:40:44,905 --> 01:40:47,874
permit me a few more questions,
you'll readily see the relevance.

1854
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:50,203
All right, all right.
But I'm warning you, Mr Barrett.

1855
01:40:50,411 --> 01:40:52,641
If the testimony in fact
is inadmissible

1856
01:40:52,846 --> 01:40:54,905
or highly prejudicial
to the prosecution

1857
01:40:55,149 --> 01:40:57,083
I will take strong measures
to deal with this.

1858
01:40:57,251 --> 01:40:59,515
- Your Honour, may l...?
- Not at this time, Mr Duncan.

1859
01:40:59,686 --> 01:41:02,314
If the evidence is not
relevant and material,

1860
01:41:02,523 --> 01:41:05,151
you may move to strike the testimony
at the appropriate time.

1861
01:41:05,359 --> 01:41:07,020
Now let's proceed.

1862
01:41:13,767 --> 01:41:16,998
<i>Miss Cumberland,</i> do <i>you
consider The Seven Minutes</i>

1863
01:41:17,171 --> 01:41:18,331
to be an obscene book?

1864
01:41:18,539 --> 01:41:22,703
No, I do not. I consider it
to be a highly moral book.

1865
01:41:22,876 --> 01:41:27,404
Do you believe the author of this work
was pandering to prurient interest,

1866
01:41:27,581 --> 01:41:30,516
to a shameful or morbid interest
in nudity and sex

1867
01:41:30,684 --> 01:41:32,675
in writing this book,
as the state charges?

1868
01:41:32,853 --> 01:41:34,878
To which I object on the grounds
that this witness

1869
01:41:35,089 --> 01:41:36,886
is not qualified
to answer the question.

1870
01:41:37,057 --> 01:41:41,357
Mr Duncan, I believe your objection to
be well taken, but the court believes

1871
01:41:41,562 --> 01:41:44,429
that the defence is entitled to
some leeway in this area.

1872
01:41:44,631 --> 01:41:45,893
Objection overruled.

1873
01:41:46,066 --> 01:41:49,797
Mr Barrett, will you please
reframe the question?

1874
01:41:50,370 --> 01:41:53,897
Miss Cumberland, do you believe
the author was in fact pandering

1875
01:41:54,108 --> 01:41:58,545
to a shameful and morbid interest
in nudity and sex?

1876
01:41:58,712 --> 01:42:03,206
I know for a fact that that author was
not pandering to prurient interest.

1877
01:42:03,383 --> 01:42:04,816
Your Honour, I move to
strike from the record

1878
01:42:04,985 --> 01:42:07,818
Miss Cumberland's conclusion and
conjecture that the author

1879
01:42:07,988 --> 01:42:10,115
was not in fact pandering
to prurient interest.

1880
01:42:10,290 --> 01:42:12,315
Obviously, this witness could
have no personal knowledge

1881
01:42:12,559 --> 01:42:14,254
of the authofis true intentions.

1882
01:42:14,495 --> 01:42:17,430
Mr Barrett, I indicated that
I would give you leeway.

1883
01:42:17,631 --> 01:42:20,122
However if you don't immediately
get to your point,

1884
01:42:20,334 --> 01:42:24,236
the court will sustain its own
objection to your questions.

1885
01:42:24,404 --> 01:42:26,338
Very well, Your Honour. I will proceed
directly to the point.

1886
01:42:28,275 --> 01:42:30,971
Miss Cumberland, you stated that
the book The Seven Minutes

1887
01:42:31,178 --> 01:42:34,113
was not in fact written
to appeal to prurient interest.

1888
01:42:34,314 --> 01:42:37,511
May I enquire, how do you know'?

1889
01:42:37,684 --> 01:42:41,017
Because I'm intimatedly acquainted
with the circumstances surrounding

1890
01:42:41,188 --> 01:42:44,988
the creation and the publication
of The <i>Seven</i> Minutes.

1891
01:42:45,159 --> 01:42:46,820
(Excited murmuring)

1892
01:42:48,929 --> 01:42:52,524
(Gavel banging repeatedly)

1893
01:42:54,368 --> 01:42:57,098
(Judge) Miss Cumberland, will you
explain to the jurors and the court

1894
01:42:57,304 --> 01:43:00,171
how you came by
this intimate knowledge?

1895
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:01,432
Gladly.

1896
01:43:01,608 --> 01:43:07,706
No person alive was closer or better
acquainted with J.J. Jadway than I am.

1897
01:43:07,981 --> 01:43:10,279
Miss Cumberland, are you implying
that you were present in Paris

1898
01:43:10,484 --> 01:43:12,611
<i>when J.J. Jadway wrote
The Seven Minutes?</i>

1899
01:43:12,819 --> 01:43:15,686
I'm saying that lwas in Paris
when the book was written.

1900
01:43:15,889 --> 01:43:18,653
Do you know the author's
motivations for writing it?

1901
01:43:18,825 --> 01:43:21,885
To which I object. The question
calls for conclusion and speculation.

1902
01:43:22,129 --> 01:43:25,292
Miss Cumberland could not possibly
have any personal knowledge

1903
01:43:25,499 --> 01:43:28,730
of the authofis true motivations
for writing The Seven Minutes.

1904
01:43:29,002 --> 01:43:32,733
Mr Duncan, we are getting on with this
matter if it's the last thing we do.

1905
01:43:32,973 --> 01:43:36,875
You will recall the court asked Miss
Cumberland to explain to thejury

1906
01:43:37,077 --> 01:43:39,910
how she has intimate knowledge
of the circumstances

1907
01:43:40,147 --> 01:43:42,047
under which The <i>Seven</i> Minutes
was written.

1908
01:43:42,249 --> 01:43:44,979
Now the court will not tolerate
any more interference

1909
01:43:45,185 --> 01:43:47,517
of Mr Barrett's questioning
along these lines.

1910
01:43:48,522 --> 01:43:49,887
Objection overruled.

1911
01:43:51,525 --> 01:43:54,085
Mr Barrett, will you proceed
and ask another question?

1912
01:43:54,328 --> 01:43:55,226
Thank you, Your Honour.

1913
01:43:55,429 --> 01:43:59,024
Miss Cumberland, you are familiar
with the prosecution's testimony.

1914
01:44:00,834 --> 01:44:03,200
Does this first-hand knowledge
which you possess

1915
01:44:03,403 --> 01:44:07,396
confirm or contradict the testimony
given here by the people's witnesses?

1916
01:44:07,574 --> 01:44:09,439
My information about the real Jadway,

1917
01:44:09,676 --> 01:44:12,440
and the real purpose in writing
and publishing this book,

1918
01:44:12,679 --> 01:44:17,946
completely contradicts the evidence
so far presented in this court.

1919
01:44:19,253 --> 01:44:21,380
You do understand that the
previous witnesses were sworn,

1920
01:44:21,588 --> 01:44:23,385
gave their testimony under oath

1921
01:44:23,590 --> 01:44:26,058
and risked facing a charge of
perjury if they lied?

1922
01:44:26,226 --> 01:44:29,252
They did not lie.
They simply did not tell the truth,

1923
01:44:29,463 --> 01:44:33,422
merely because they were ignorant
of the truth. Let me explain.

1924
01:44:33,634 --> 01:44:37,798
Everything heard in this courtroom,
until now, about J.J. Jadway,

1925
01:44:37,971 --> 01:44:41,304
and I am completely fluent
with all of the testimony,

1926
01:44:41,575 --> 01:44:43,736
has been the purest fiction.

1927
01:44:43,910 --> 01:44:48,938
And this fiction was deliberately
planned and perpetrated by the author,

1928
01:44:49,116 --> 01:44:52,574
for reasons involving
the author's private life.

1929
01:44:53,620 --> 01:44:55,645
Let me go directly
to the salient point at hand.

1930
01:44:57,557 --> 01:44:59,923
You indicated in earlier testimony
that you had published

1931
01:45:00,093 --> 01:45:02,891
your own autobiography, which
was a best-seller as I recall.

1932
01:45:03,063 --> 01:45:05,463
Have you ever written or published
any other books?

1933
01:45:05,632 --> 01:45:06,621
Yes, I have.

1934
01:45:08,669 --> 01:45:10,000
How many other books?

1935
01:45:10,170 --> 01:45:11,137
One book.

1936
01:45:11,305 --> 01:45:13,899
Was this book published under the name
of Constance Cumberland?

1937
01:45:14,074 --> 01:45:16,907
No, it was not. It was
published under a pseudonym.

1938
01:45:17,110 --> 01:45:19,601
(Suspenseful music)

1939
01:45:19,780 --> 01:45:21,771
Can you tell the court
the title of that book

1940
01:45:21,982 --> 01:45:23,643
and the pseudonym
under which you wrote it?

1941
01:45:23,817 --> 01:45:26,183
- The book was The <i>Seven</i> Minutes...
- (Gasps of astonishment)

1942
01:45:26,353 --> 01:45:28,184
- ...by J.J. Jadway.

1943
01:45:28,355 --> 01:45:30,118
(Hubbub in court)

1944
01:45:31,091 --> 01:45:33,753
- I am J.J. Jadway.
- (Pencil snaps loudly)

1945
01:45:33,927 --> 01:45:36,259
(Dramatic music)

1946
01:45:36,963 --> 01:45:40,091
- (Gavel banging)
- Order in court! Order! Order!

1947
01:45:43,337 --> 01:45:46,864
Miss Cumberland, the court has already
heard The Seven Minutes read aloud.

1948
01:45:48,608 --> 01:45:51,702
S0 we might more clearly
determine the significance

1949
01:45:51,945 --> 01:45:54,539
of what we have already heard,
would you mind telling us

1950
01:45:54,781 --> 01:45:58,444
the themes and symbols that you
tried to convey in writing the book?

1951
01:46:00,220 --> 01:46:01,949
May I have a glass of water, please?

1952
01:46:09,162 --> 01:46:10,390
Thank you.

1953
01:46:12,199 --> 01:46:19,469
(Clock ticking loudly)

1954
01:46:19,639 --> 01:46:22,574
The Seven Minutes is composed
of seven chapters,

1955
01:46:22,809 --> 01:46:25,004
each chapter representing one minute

1956
01:46:25,212 --> 01:46:27,840
in the mind of
this young woman, Kathleen,

1957
01:46:28,014 --> 01:46:30,312
who is lying on a bed
having sexual intercourse

1958
01:46:30,484 --> 01:46:33,419
with an unnamed, unseen man.

1959
01:46:33,587 --> 01:46:36,488
It begins with a description
of her thoughts and feelings

1960
01:46:36,656 --> 01:46:38,146
for her male bed partner.

1961
01:46:38,358 --> 01:46:41,384
Kathleen's mind reacts
to the coupling on two levels.

1962
01:46:41,561 --> 01:46:45,895
On the first, she records
her immediate physical sensations,

1963
01:46:46,066 --> 01:46:50,765
and on the second, inspired
by her gradually mounting passion,

1964
01:46:50,937 --> 01:46:55,738
she recollects fragments of sensual
experiences from her youthful past

1965
01:46:55,909 --> 01:46:59,936
with three actual men in her life
who had been her lovers.

1966
01:47:00,180 --> 01:47:02,444
The thrust of the novel
is drawn out of the fact

1967
01:47:02,682 --> 01:47:08,086
that Kathleen decides to accept one of
these men as her lifetime mate:

1968
01:47:08,255 --> 01:47:11,053
the one she had taken
to her bed this night,

1969
01:47:11,224 --> 01:47:13,715
the very one who shares
her seven minutes.

1970
01:47:13,894 --> 01:47:19,696
Not till the last page, while
she is gasping her love for him

1971
01:47:19,866 --> 01:47:25,304
in the final throes of her passion,
does she call out and reveal the name

1972
01:47:25,472 --> 01:47:26,905
of the one she has chosen.

1973
01:47:27,107 --> 01:47:33,068
You see, through her vast
sexual experience, she has managed

1974
01:47:33,246 --> 01:47:39,151
to liberate a sensitive
but potentially impotent man,

1975
01:47:39,319 --> 01:47:41,287
the man she honestly loved.

1976
01:47:41,488 --> 01:47:45,584
In writing The Seven Minutes
I finally found freedom myself,

1977
01:47:45,926 --> 01:47:47,826
just as I had hoped
I might liberate others

1978
01:47:48,061 --> 01:47:51,053
from fear and guilt and shame.

1979
01:47:51,231 --> 01:47:54,394
Do you know of any other readers for
which it has performed this service?

1980
01:47:54,568 --> 01:47:58,004
The words in The Seven Minutes
freed a young man only today,

1981
01:47:58,238 --> 01:48:01,401
and enabled him to confide to me
the truth about himself.

1982
01:48:01,575 --> 01:48:03,941
A truth he has told no other person,
until now.

1983
01:48:04,110 --> 01:48:09,673
Jerry Griffith was not driven to
commit rape by reading this book.

1984
01:48:09,850 --> 01:48:14,150
He did not try to violate
Sheri Moore against her will.

1985
01:48:14,321 --> 01:48:17,848
He tried, but at
Sheri's own invitation,

1986
01:48:18,024 --> 01:48:20,686
but he failed then,
as he had always failed before,

1987
01:48:20,861 --> 01:48:22,658
and as he would fail today.

1988
01:48:22,863 --> 01:48:27,300
Because, you see, Jerry Griffith
was then, was before, and even today

1989
01:48:27,467 --> 01:48:30,527
is still sexually impotent.

1990
01:48:30,971 --> 01:48:33,804
He is incapable of
attaining an erection.

1991
01:48:37,177 --> 01:48:39,441
Miss Cumberland, did the verdict
for acquittal surprise you?

1992
01:48:39,613 --> 01:48:41,808
What surprised me more
was the very fact

1993
01:48:42,015 --> 01:48:44,882
that I was able to
reveal myself in court.

1994
01:48:45,051 --> 01:48:47,451
There was testimony about
your supposed suicide.

1995
01:48:47,654 --> 01:48:50,885
You look pretty good to me right now,
so obviously you're alive and kicking.

1996
01:48:51,124 --> 01:48:52,989
Did you ever really try
to kill yourself?

1997
01:48:53,159 --> 01:48:55,024
(Constance) Well, that whole
incredible story

1998
01:48:55,228 --> 01:48:57,162
was arranged by
a poet friend of mine,

1999
01:48:57,330 --> 01:49:00,390
a loyal and dear friend
named Sean O'Flanagan.

2000
01:49:00,567 --> 01:49:05,903
It was simple enough for him to write
and plant the obituary of J.J. Jadway.

2001
01:49:06,072 --> 01:49:11,169
Cassie McGraw arranged a private
memorial service for Jadway.

2002
01:49:11,378 --> 01:49:13,676
I found it wiser to be somewhere else.

2003
01:49:13,847 --> 01:49:17,305
<i>Miss Cumberland, what made you decide
to renounce the Jadway identity?</i>

2004
01:49:17,484 --> 01:49:20,214
Well, I had an offer
from a Hollywood producer,

2005
01:49:20,387 --> 01:49:24,847
someone I had met in Paris,
to appear in The Go/d-Diggers of 1938.

2006
01:49:25,025 --> 01:49:27,858
Anyway, I went to Hollywood,
made Gold-Diggers,

2007
01:49:28,061 --> 01:49:30,529
and you know the rest.

2008
01:49:31,264 --> 01:49:33,198
(Maggie laughing)

2009
01:49:38,405 --> 01:49:39,997
Be nice. You won.

2010
01:49:40,173 --> 01:49:41,435
I'll be right back.

2011
01:49:41,608 --> 01:49:43,337
Oh, Mr Barrett,
I don't know if you heard me

2012
01:49:43,543 --> 01:49:44,703
with all the noise after the verdict,

2013
01:49:44,911 --> 01:49:45,900
but I did congratulate you.

2014
01:49:46,079 --> 01:49:47,512
I appreciate that, sir.

2015
01:49:47,681 --> 01:49:50,616
You won the preliminary.
You got The <i>Seven</i> Minutes off the hook.

2016
01:49:50,850 --> 01:49:52,784
But the main event
is still murder one,

2017
01:49:53,019 --> 01:49:55,385
and I intend to prosecute Perkins
to the full limit of the law.

2018
01:49:55,589 --> 01:49:57,181
Jerry Griffith has a debt as well.

2019
01:49:57,390 --> 01:49:59,756
As an accomplice he shares
the responsibility for the crime.

2020
01:49:59,926 --> 01:50:00,790
He won't run from that.

2021
01:50:01,027 --> 01:50:03,222
When he has his day in court
I'll be standing right next to him.

2022
01:50:03,430 --> 01:50:05,261
You proved that one of
my witnesses perjured himself

2023
01:50:05,465 --> 01:50:07,296
and that another one unwittingly lied.

2024
01:50:07,467 --> 01:50:08,957
But you didn't prove,
at least not to me,

2025
01:50:09,135 --> 01:50:11,433
that this filthy book
belongs in a decent household.

2026
01:50:11,605 --> 01:50:14,438
And Jadway or Cumberland,
I still believe The Seven Minutes

2027
01:50:14,608 --> 01:50:16,633
is obscene and harmful
and should have been found guilty.

2028
01:50:16,876 --> 01:50:18,741
And as for the author
of that perverted book,

2029
01:50:18,912 --> 01:50:22,211
Constance Cumberland stands
as a black stain on our society.

2030
01:50:22,382 --> 01:50:23,815
Well, you're entitled
to your opinion...

2031
01:50:23,984 --> 01:50:27,044
Barrett, such books are dangerous
and should not be published,

2032
01:50:27,253 --> 01:50:29,585
because they can hurt
immature and disturbed adults.

2033
01:50:29,789 --> 01:50:31,654
Even worse,
they can over-stimulate a child

2034
01:50:31,891 --> 01:50:34,291
before he's ready to accept
his sex thoughts as natural

2035
01:50:34,494 --> 01:50:36,394
and drive him into
damaging sexual fantasies.

2036
01:50:36,596 --> 01:50:39,121
In other words, Mr Duncan,
all literature and all ideas

2037
01:50:39,332 --> 01:50:41,630
should be aimed at satisfying
the twelve-year-old reader.

2038
01:50:41,835 --> 01:50:44,736
You're a pitiful hypocrite
and a political opportunist to boot.

2039
01:50:44,938 --> 01:50:48,169
You spout your clever rhetoric
about God, mother and country

2040
01:50:48,408 --> 01:50:50,933
and yet you connive and scheme
without regard to anyone but yourself.

2041
01:50:51,144 --> 01:50:55,274
It amazes me that an intelligent man
cannot direct his energies

2042
01:50:55,448 --> 01:50:57,678
into what is good for the community
he's supposed to protect.

2043
01:50:57,917 --> 01:51:00,078
Instead, he spends his time
racing off to court

2044
01:51:00,286 --> 01:51:03,653
seeking a ban on those things
he arbitrarily feels is bad for us.

2045
01:51:03,857 --> 01:51:05,324
You've got your goddamn nerve!

2046
01:51:05,492 --> 01:51:07,687
You win one lousy case,
you think you're F. Lee Bailey.

2047
01:51:07,861 --> 01:51:08,828
Let me tell you one thing:

2048
01:51:09,029 --> 01:51:10,621
as long as there are books
like The <i>Seven</i> Minutes

2049
01:51:10,797 --> 01:51:13,357
or anything else I feel jeopardises
the moral fibre of this community,

2050
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:14,828
I'll keep fighting them!

2051
01:51:15,669 --> 01:51:18,638
- (Tyres squeal)
- Fair warning.

2052
01:51:19,539 --> 01:51:21,598
But as long as you keep
strong-arming yourself ahead,

2053
01:51:23,443 --> 01:51:24,341
I'll be fighting you.

2054
01:51:25,111 --> 01:51:27,841
(Mike) Maggie, if you knew all along
about Jerry's sexual problem,

2055
01:51:28,048 --> 01:51:30,278
if you knew he was
incapable of rape,

2056
01:51:30,483 --> 01:51:31,848
why the hell didn't you
say something?

2057
01:51:32,018 --> 01:51:34,145
Because I wasn't all that certain
that he was impotent

2058
01:51:34,354 --> 01:51:35,685
<i>on the night of the sa-cal/ed rape.</i>

2059
01:51:35,855 --> 01:51:38,483
<i>(Mike) Where did Jerry and
Miss Cumberland finally get together?</i>

2060
01:51:38,658 --> 01:51:41,525
<i>(Maggie) In your house, yesterday,
while you were still in Chicago.</i>

2061
01:51:41,728 --> 01:51:44,663
I took the chance
of pretending to him

2062
01:51:44,864 --> 01:51:46,957
that I knew the truth about
his night with Sheri Moore.

2063
01:51:47,167 --> 01:51:49,863
<i>At that point, Jerry broke down
and confessed everything.</i>

2064
01:51:50,070 --> 01:51:51,367
Miss Cumberland was really touched.

2065
01:51:51,571 --> 01:51:55,132
She said if she could persuade Jerry
to stand up and confess the truth

2066
01:51:55,341 --> 01:51:58,333
then she herself might find the
courage to do the same in court.

2067
01:51:58,545 --> 01:52:03,414
Maggie, you're beautiful.
Just beautiful.

2068
01:52:05,919 --> 01:52:08,046
Listen, if you're really so grateful,

2069
01:52:08,221 --> 01:52:09,813
how about a little
victory celebration?

2070
01:52:09,989 --> 01:52:11,854
You know I don't drink
anything stronger than Coke.

2071
01:52:12,025 --> 01:52:14,550
And I also know you've given up
cigarettes and cyclamates

2072
01:52:14,761 --> 01:52:17,093
because you're only thirty
and want to live to be a hundred.

2073
01:52:17,330 --> 01:52:20,731
I was thinking of
something a lot healthier.

2074
01:52:21,267 --> 01:52:22,529
(Car engine revs up)

2075
01:52:24,170 --> 01:52:28,072
"To Michael Barrett,
I salute you on your deserved victory,

2076
01:52:28,274 --> 01:52:31,107
"and I recommend that you
enjoy this vintage wine

2077
01:52:31,344 --> 01:52:33,209
"in the spirit that it is given."

2078
01:52:33,379 --> 01:52:36,041
Beware of Greeks bearing gifts.

2079
01:52:36,216 --> 01:52:39,344
"L also recommend to you
the wisdom of Charles Lamb.

2080
01:52:39,786 --> 01:52:43,187
- "To wit, he is..."
- ...no lawyer who cannot take two sides.

2081
01:52:43,389 --> 01:52:46,415
"When you have time,
I would like to interest you in..."

2082
01:52:46,593 --> 01:52:47,719
...my side of the coin.

2083
01:52:47,894 --> 01:52:50,362
"You could find it

2084
01:52:50,530 --> 01:52:54,762
Who knows, you could be
Senatorial material.

2085
01:52:54,934 --> 01:52:57,368
"Best, Luther Yerkes."

2086
01:52:59,372 --> 01:53:00,430
Luther Yerkes.

2087
01:53:06,546 --> 01:53:08,639
Young lady,
I feel it's only fair to tell you

2088
01:53:08,882 --> 01:53:11,407
that what I'm thinking about doing
is against the law.

2089
01:53:11,618 --> 01:53:13,210
And what are you thinking about doing?

2090
01:53:13,453 --> 01:53:16,786
I can't tell you that.
It's against the law too.

2091
01:53:16,956 --> 01:53:21,484
Suddenly, I got this overpowering urge
to break the damn law myself.

2092
01:53:21,661 --> 01:53:27,327
Well, we could both get into
a lot of trouble.

2093
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:29,491
I know a very good lawyer.

2094
01:53:29,669 --> 01:53:36,734
Aside from notoriety, what else
do you want out of my life?

2095
01:53:40,413 --> 01:53:46,079
Would you believe
the next seven minutes?

2096
01:53:48,288 --> 01:53:51,780
(Clock ticking)

2097
01:54:12,011 --> 01:54:15,447
(Soft rock ballad)

2098
01:54:23,857 --> 01:54:26,849
<i> Seven minutes
filled with pleasure</i>

2099
01:54:27,026 --> 01:54:29,620
<i> Moments made of love
will take you</i>

2100
01:54:29,963 --> 01:54:31,897
<i> On</i> a <i>sweet excursion</i>

2101
01:54:32,165 --> 01:54:34,998
<i> By wayof</i>

2102
01:54:35,201 --> 01:54:38,864
<i> Your memory</i>

01:54:41,241 --> 01:54:43,641
<i> Suddenly you find</i>

2104
01:54:43,810 --> 01:54:47,007
<i> You cross the boundfies

2105
01:54:47,247 --> 01:54:51,547
<i> AII at once you have</i>

2106
01:54:52,018 --> 01:54:55,215
