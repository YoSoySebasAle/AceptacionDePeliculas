1
00:01:00,767 --> 00:01:03,067
Yeah. Yeah.

2
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:06,633
-Um...

3
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:09,767
- Jesus! My god.
- Hey, Sophie.

4
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,367
Pete.

5
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,309
My god. We must've
gotten the wrong apartment.

6
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:16,767
- I'm... um...
- I-it happens.

7
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,767
-I just, well...

8
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,467
This is my friend.

9
00:01:25,133 --> 00:01:26,733
- Julian.
- Julian.

10
00:01:26,767 --> 00:01:30,167
This is Pete, my neighbor.
- Hey, man.

11
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,300
-This is where he lives.

12
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,067
Sorry. I guess we'll...

13
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,400
-Is that your bathroom?

14
00:01:38,267 --> 00:01:40,667
-Yep.

15
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:50,667
Dude. My god.

16
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,733
You're not gonna believe
where I am.

17
00:01:52,767 --> 00:01:55,133
This chick is all...

18
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:58,233
-So, um, how... how are you?

19
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,467
-I know. Yeah, dude.
Come on, tell me what you mean.

20
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,033
She's cute, right?
She's cute?

21
00:02:05,067 --> 00:02:09,100
Alonzo said they finally
caught the guy that was...

22
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:10,500
Pooping in the bushes,

23
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:13,500
and I guess it turned out
that it was just, um, a dog.

24
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:16,333
- No, dude. Dude.
- I...

25
00:02:16,367 --> 00:02:18,367
-I'll be there
in like an hour...

26
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,233
Less than an hour, Max.

27
00:02:20,267 --> 00:02:22,100
I got to go. This...

28
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:24,533
I'm pissing
all over this dude's wall.

29
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,667
Okay.

30
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,400
Okay.

31
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:35,533
Hi.

32
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:37,233
Hey, there.

33
00:02:37,267 --> 00:02:39,333
So, you want to go next door?

34
00:02:40,367 --> 00:02:42,467
-Yeah, um...

35
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:48,100
You know what?
I'm actually gonna go to bed.

36
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:49,467
-What?

37
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,767
-Um... you know, I have
a really big day tomorrow,

38
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,567
just this thing
in the morning, and...

39
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,500
You guys are weird.

40
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:21,400
-Do you want... some pizza?

41
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,233
-Yeah.

42
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,500
Thanks, Pete.

43
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:36,467
Yep.

44
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,133
Whoop!

45
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:40,533
-See you.

46
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,400
- Sophie?
- Hi.

47
00:04:21,633 --> 00:04:24,633
-Okay, so, do you have
any questions about this?

48
00:04:24,667 --> 00:04:27,533
Yes, I... there wasn't
anything to prepare,

49
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:30,500
so I was just wondering
what I'd be doing.

50
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:33,367
-Sure. Yeah, we... we're
basically just looking

51
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,100
for somebody who can
really sell this hot dog.

52
00:04:36,133 --> 00:04:37,667
You know?

53
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,267
You eat meat, right?

54
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,667
- Yes.
- Great.

55
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,100
-I don't normally,
but I-I would.

56
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,467
-Okay. Um, if you could just
grab a hot dog bun over there...

57
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,567
-Yep.

58
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,667
-Okay.

59
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,467
You're just gonna eat it
like it is the best hot dog

60
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,600
you've ever had
in your entire life.

61
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,633
-Great.

62
00:04:58,667 --> 00:05:00,700
Do I say anything?

63
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,700
-No. No.

64
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:05,533
I mean, you can vocalize
if you want to.

65
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:07,333
-Great.

66
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:09,367
What's my frame for this?

67
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,133
It's an extreme close-up.

68
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:14,233
-Of my face?

69
00:05:14,267 --> 00:05:16,767
-Of your mouth.

70
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,233
-Great.

71
00:05:19,267 --> 00:05:21,567
-And speak.

72
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,133
-Hi, I'm Sophie potts
with dreemz talent agency...

73
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:28,133
That's the dreemz with two e's
and a "z" at the end.

74
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:31,533
-Great. Go ahead.

75
00:05:31,567 --> 00:05:33,367
-All right.

76
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,800
-Cut.

77
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,800
And you can just spit out
in the bin over there.

78
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:34,633
-I'm literally getting
chills right now.

79
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:37,267
Live mermaids.

80
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,467
Man!

81
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,067
You guys...
Y'all know how to do it up, man.

82
00:08:44,367 --> 00:08:46,333
That's great, though.

83
00:08:46,367 --> 00:08:50,133
Well, how long
have they been together?

84
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:52,600
Sure, so it was time.

85
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,800
Bachelor party with the boys!

86
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:59,400
You guys are gonna have
a blast, seriously.

87
00:08:59,433 --> 00:09:02,567
Vegas... blowin' it up!

88
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:06,633
I've been... once,

89
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:09,233
had too many margaritas,

90
00:09:09,267 --> 00:09:11,367
got a little sick,
but it didn't...

91
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,267
It didn't ruin the trip.

92
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,633
Yeah, I was with
my parents and my sister.

93
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:18,500
We did the whole
"siegfried & Roy" thing.

94
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:20,467
The tigers...
I mean, the tigers.

95
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,433
I don't know if you've ever...

96
00:09:22,467 --> 00:09:25,300
Okay, cool.
You're rebooted.

97
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,100
Okay, that's it.

98
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:31,467
Yeah. All right, under
"protocol," select r-s-m-4.

99
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,233
All right!

100
00:09:35,267 --> 00:09:37,633
Nice, man. Um...

101
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:39,300
Cool.

102
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,567
Where... and you guys all...

103
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,200
Y'all all went to
high school together?

104
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:46,000
That's cool.

105
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:55,667
Okay, well, is there anything
else I can help you with today?

106
00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:00,300
You may receive a survey
through your e-mail.

107
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,767
Again, my name is Pete.

108
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,367
And I'd ask that you rank me
a 9 or a 10 if you are happy

109
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,300
with the troubleshooting
that I've given you.

110
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:13,400
Cool.

111
00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:17,500
Thanks, man,
and, dude, have fun, obviously,

112
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:20,500
and call back anytime,
seriously.

113
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:22,133
Okay.

114
00:10:22,167 --> 00:10:24,733
Yeah, good meeting you.

115
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:26,667
All right. Bye.

116
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,500
Hey, Pete.

117
00:10:54,533 --> 00:10:57,567
-Hey. Hey, I got to leave
in like a few minutes,

118
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,233
but...

119
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:01,333
You should come in.

120
00:11:03,267 --> 00:11:05,433
Hey, look, um...

121
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,567
Don't worry about last night
or anything.

122
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,133
There's...

123
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:13,433
You know, it's...
There's nothing to be...

124
00:11:13,467 --> 00:11:15,667
Embarrassed about.

125
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,633
-Last night?

126
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,633
God. Last night.

127
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,633
-Well...

128
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:27,733
You know,
I mean, those things...

129
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,767
You've got, 
bread crumbs in your hair.

130
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:40,000
-Do you have anything to drink?

131
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:47,400
God, Pete. It was this
stupid local commercial, but...

132
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,433
I'm never getting up
off this floor.

133
00:11:53,467 --> 00:11:56,467
I hope that's okay.

134
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,133
-No, yeah, that's...
That's totally cool.

135
00:12:00,167 --> 00:12:01,633
I really do
have to go soon, though.

136
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:04,033
-That's fine.
I'll just stay right here.

137
00:12:04,067 --> 00:12:06,533
-On the floor?

138
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:07,633
Forever?

139
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:10,767
Yep. Forever.

140
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,700
We should probably just
get married, then

141
00:12:17,733 --> 00:12:22,067
I mean, if you're gonna
be here anyway.

142
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,267
-Okay.

143
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,067
- Cool.
- Perfect.

144
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,800
-Great.

145
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,200
-Sweet.

146
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:44,100
-I... I was just kidding.

147
00:12:44,133 --> 00:12:46,267
-I know.

148
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,067
-So, I've got to go.

149
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,367
Really?

150
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,433
Yeah, yeah.

151
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,000
You want some company?

152
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:11,233
-My car's just, like,
right up there.

153
00:13:12,467 --> 00:13:14,367
-You know, I don't think
I've ever seen you

154
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,767
outside
of our apartment complex.

155
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,633
-No. Yeah, we have,
that one time at 7-Eleven.

156
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:22,267
Yeah.

157
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,367
So, where are we going?

158
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,767
-Phoenix, just super quickly.

159
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,433
-Quickly?

160
00:13:28,467 --> 00:13:30,433
-Yeah, we're gonna pick up
my sister from college.

161
00:13:30,467 --> 00:13:32,509
Her semester is over,
and my parents are out of town.

162
00:13:32,533 --> 00:13:34,367
-Isn't that like six hours away?

163
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,233
-Six hours there,
six hours back.

164
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,433
-This is great.
You'll get to meet my sister.

165
00:13:40,467 --> 00:13:43,333
She's awesome.
You're gonna love Jess.

166
00:13:43,367 --> 00:13:45,633
-Ex-excuse me, sir.

167
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,767
I must say...

168
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,300
This is a lovely lady
you have here.

169
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,633
-You're a lucky guy.

170
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:58,167
- Thank you.
- Do you love him?

171
00:14:00,733 --> 00:14:04,333
-No, come on, now. Do you tell
him you love him every night?

172
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,533
-Yeah, I do.

173
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:08,667
Every night.

174
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,667
-She does constantly,
all the time.

175
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,767
Wow.

176
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,300
You guys... look at you.
You guys are dressed alike.

177
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,500
You like a bunch of easter eggs.

178
00:14:17,533 --> 00:14:20,067
My god. You make me
want to just peel you off.

179
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,067
You guys watch
a bunch of movies together?

180
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,500
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It is,
like, our favorite thing to do.

181
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:27,400
- It's our thing.
- You know what?

182
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,733
I got just the thing
for you guys.

183
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:41,067
- Yeah.
- It's red.

184
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,467
-Red. Cool. Mine's blue.

185
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,633
Um, where are you from?

186
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:46,400
-San Antonio, but...

187
00:14:46,433 --> 00:14:49,233
-San Antonio, city of missions.

188
00:14:49,267 --> 00:14:51,633
Okay, do you have a dog?

189
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:52,767
-Hey, Pete.

190
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,700
- Obviously, duh... no.
Stupid question.

191
00:14:56,733 --> 00:14:59,067
If you did have a dog,
what kind would you get, though?

192
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,367
-Pete, I don't think this is...

193
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,133
Do you know how to play
20 questions?

194
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:03,767
-No, this is... this is...

195
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,100
This is, like,
me and Jess' family version.

196
00:15:06,133 --> 00:15:07,333
It's a lot...

197
00:15:07,367 --> 00:15:09,533
It's more fun, I think.
- Okay.

198
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,000
-Okay.
Here's where it gets hard.

199
00:15:14,367 --> 00:15:17,567
What's the saddest thing
that's ever happened to you?

200
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,500
-The saddest thing
that's ever happened to me?

201
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:22,233
-Yeah.

202
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:25,300
-You know what?

203
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,300
I'd probably rather
not talk about it.

204
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,033
-No? Not gonna go for it?

205
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:32,300
-Nah, I don't feel like
answering that one.

206
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,767
- You're not gonna do it?
- No.

207
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,267
-I just won. Pete wins.

208
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,500
I'm the winner.

209
00:15:37,533 --> 00:15:39,267
- You can win this game?
- Yep. I just did.

210
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,667
You gave up.
- No. Okay. Okay.

211
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,567
-I mean,
you should pretty much know

212
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,167
that I'm basically undefeated.

213
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,533
When we used to play on road
trips, Jess would give up

214
00:15:46,567 --> 00:15:49,133
after like five questions, too,
so don't feel bad or anything.

215
00:15:49,167 --> 00:15:51,733
Actually, the only person
that's ever beat is bradman.

216
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:54,433
-Who's bradman?

217
00:15:54,467 --> 00:15:57,500
- Is that your first question?
- Sure.

218
00:15:57,533 --> 00:15:59,700
-Bradman is Jess' boyfriend.

219
00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:01,433
He is awesome.

220
00:16:01,467 --> 00:16:04,633
And he's probably gonna get
drafted by the Dodgers.

221
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:07,500
Is bradman, like,
your role model or something?

222
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,767
-Question number two,
cutting deep.

223
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,633
You learn fast.

224
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:14,633
I would say, yeah,

225
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:17,300
bradman is definitely
a good role model, for sure.

226
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,609
-Do I just ask another question?

227
00:16:18,633 --> 00:16:20,367
-You keep it coming
till I give up, yeah.

228
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,767
-Okay. Um... Pete.

229
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,100
What's your last name?

230
00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:27,233
-You don't know my last name?

231
00:16:27,267 --> 00:16:28,800
-Why would I know
your last name?

232
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,200
It's not like we hang out

233
00:16:30,233 --> 00:16:32,400
outside of our apartment
or anything.

234
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,033
-It's on my mailbox.

235
00:16:35,067 --> 00:16:36,600
What am I? Like a stalker?

236
00:16:36,633 --> 00:16:40,567
-Avery.
Peter Stephen Avery, actually.

237
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,433
-Well, Peter Stephen Avery,

238
00:16:42,467 --> 00:16:45,033
it's nice to formally make
your acquaintance.

239
00:16:45,067 --> 00:16:46,800
-Yeah.

240
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,567
You too.

241
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:54,567
Okay, um, Peter,
do you know my last name?

242
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,767
-Sophie potts, apartment 209.

243
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,367
You're sort of creepy!

244
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,300
-No. I-I get your...
Your bead catalogues.

245
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,367
-Sure, sure.

246
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,200
- I I do.
- Okay.

247
00:17:08,233 --> 00:17:12,133
Hey, Peter, here's a good one.

248
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:14,767
Do you a crush on me?

249
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:18,400
What? No.

250
00:17:18,433 --> 00:17:20,333
Do I have a crush on you?

251
00:17:20,367 --> 00:17:21,733
No.
- I don't know.

252
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:23,667
I mean, first you ask me
to marry you,

253
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,700
and then you know my last name.
- That doesn't mean...

254
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:29,167
I know lots of
people's last names,

255
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,567
and I don't have
crushes on them.

256
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,100
I don't have a crush on you.

257
00:17:32,133 --> 00:17:34,667
-That's... that's fine.
I was just wondering.

258
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,633
-Why?

259
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,500
-'Cause I kind of have
a crush on you.

260
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:52,300
-Do you think it's,
like, a... a turtle?

261
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,767
-I don't know.

262
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,100
Jesus.
It looks like it's part snake.

263
00:17:57,133 --> 00:17:59,733
Poor thing.

264
00:17:59,767 --> 00:18:01,733
It's disgusting.

265
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,533
-We can't just, like,
leave it here, though.

266
00:18:09,467 --> 00:18:12,267
-Do you want to Bury it?

267
00:18:39,267 --> 00:18:40,233
-Aah!

268
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:44,767
I'm sorry.
My god.

269
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,133
-You did good.

270
00:19:08,167 --> 00:19:11,267
We'll Bury it in Phoenix.

271
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,467
-Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!

272
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,500
-Hey, Pete.

273
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,433
You left it in drive.

274
00:19:41,467 --> 00:19:45,633
Yeah.

275
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:47,667
Right.

276
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,667
Right.

277
00:19:54,533 --> 00:19:58,367
Sorry I freaked out.
- No, it's... it's fine.

278
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,400
All right.

279
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:05,767
-You know,
I got hit by a car once.

280
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,767
-Are... are you okay?

281
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,767
-Yeah. Yeah, it was just...

282
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:16,533
I was carrying this box of,
plates across the street,

283
00:20:16,567 --> 00:20:20,033
and I-I guess I wasn't really
looking where I was going,

284
00:20:20,067 --> 00:20:21,567
and...

285
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,733
But, the... the person that
hit me was in a convertible,

286
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:29,367
so all the plates...

287
00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:33,033
You know.

288
00:20:33,067 --> 00:20:36,633
She had insurance,
so she's fine now, too.

289
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:38,267
-Okay.

290
00:20:39,633 --> 00:20:41,500
Cool.

291
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:44,633
-She was really pretty.

292
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:53,567
Hey, I know you were
joking before,

293
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,233
but, um, you know,
I was just wondering...

294
00:20:56,267 --> 00:20:59,633
Would you... would you marry me?

295
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:01,400
I...

296
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:03,500
I mean, I was just... playing.

297
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:05,233
Yeah, I know.

298
00:21:05,267 --> 00:21:08,500
I just don't feel like anybody
would ever want to marry me.

299
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:13,167
Like, I'd marry you, you know?

300
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,700
- Really?
- Yeah.

301
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:20,267
You're a catch.
- Okay. So, like... so...

302
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,433
So, if right now I was like,
"let's get married,"

303
00:21:23,467 --> 00:21:27,067
you'd... you'd say yes?

304
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,533
Yeah.

305
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,000
-Let's get married.

306
00:21:38,633 --> 00:21:39,633
-You're kidding.

307
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:43,133
-No, i'm... I'm not,
but y-you are.

308
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:45,733
-No, I'm not. I'm not.

309
00:21:47,267 --> 00:21:50,367
-Me neither.

310
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:53,233
-What, so is this...

311
00:21:53,267 --> 00:21:54,767
For real?

312
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,767
-I don't know.

313
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,567
Think about it.

314
00:22:00,533 --> 00:22:03,567
-I'm thinking about it.

315
00:22:07,133 --> 00:22:09,433
- So, we'd split rent.
- We can get tax breaks.

316
00:22:09,467 --> 00:22:11,533
- There are tax breaks?
- Yeah, there must be.

317
00:22:11,567 --> 00:22:13,800
- That's an amazing call.
- I'll look into it.

318
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,133
I can buy milk
by the gallon now.

319
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,300
I can get a bunch of cats,

320
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,567
and I wouldn't even be
a pathetic cat lady.

321
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,467
-Sophie...

322
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,700
This is, like,
a really good idea.

323
00:22:27,733 --> 00:22:29,733
-It's your idea, too.

324
00:22:29,767 --> 00:22:31,367
-Yeah, I know.

325
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,000
It's both of our ideas.

326
00:22:35,267 --> 00:22:37,767
Whoa, does this mean
that I'm like...

327
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,500
The one?

328
00:22:39,533 --> 00:22:41,600
-Well, I've never been
married before.

329
00:22:41,633 --> 00:22:45,367
So, yeah, I guess it's...
So, you're the one.

330
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,633
Awesome.

331
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:49,100
You're the one, too.

332
00:22:49,133 --> 00:22:51,733
-Aww!

333
00:22:51,767 --> 00:22:53,267
-High five.

334
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,100
Soft mattress or firm mattress?

335
00:22:56,133 --> 00:22:59,100
-I sleep on a futon mattress.

336
00:22:59,133 --> 00:23:01,633
- So, firm.
- Yeah.

337
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:03,133
-Three, two, one...

338
00:23:04,767 --> 00:23:07,033
I think we should...

339
00:23:07,067 --> 00:23:09,600
Get couple's stationary.

340
00:23:11,233 --> 00:23:12,600
- Yes.
- Yeah?

341
00:23:12,633 --> 00:23:16,467
- And robes.
- Monogrammed, matching.

342
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,667
- Hey, we should sign a prenup.
- Totally.

343
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,533
My parents always said,
"do whatever you want,

344
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:25,267
but make sure you get a prenup."

345
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,067
Wait. Really?

346
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,033
-Yeah.

347
00:23:29,067 --> 00:23:32,067
"Pete keeps his...
All of his lots of money.

348
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,200
Sophie keeps her kitchenaid."

349
00:23:37,067 --> 00:23:38,533
Seems fair to me.

350
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,267
I should take you on a date.

351
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,533
We're getting married,

352
00:23:49,567 --> 00:23:51,633
and we haven't been
on a date yet, so...

353
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:53,300
Pete.

354
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,633
What do you think this was?

355
00:23:57,667 --> 00:23:59,500
-How'd it go?

356
00:23:59,533 --> 00:24:01,733
-I had a lovely time.

357
00:24:01,767 --> 00:24:04,400
-Very good.

358
00:24:04,433 --> 00:24:06,367
- Wait!
- What?

359
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,767
-I know exactly what we need.

360
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:45,000
Hi.
- Hi.

361
00:24:46,433 --> 00:24:48,500
Can I take this off?
- Yep.

362
00:24:48,533 --> 00:24:49,533
-Okay.

363
00:24:52,733 --> 00:24:55,600
What's this about?

364
00:24:55,633 --> 00:24:58,633
- I got you something.
- You didn't.

365
00:25:00,133 --> 00:25:02,667
I did.

366
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,400
I got one, too.

367
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:12,400
Aah.

368
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:16,667
-They're perfect.

369
00:25:18,633 --> 00:25:19,433
-Good.

370
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,267
It's...

371
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,133
Scoop, scoop, scoop it.
- Scoop.

372
00:25:28,167 --> 00:25:29,533
-Swimming.

373
00:25:29,567 --> 00:25:31,767
- Swimming?
- Swimming, swimming, swimming.

374
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,467
Then scoop it, scoop it,
scoop it, scoop it.

375
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,767
-Scoop it, scoop it.

376
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,233
Swim and swim and swim.
Scoop it, scoop it

377
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,600
-all right.

378
00:25:43,633 --> 00:25:46,100
Scoop it, scoop it,
scoop it, scoop it.

379
00:25:46,133 --> 00:25:48,043
Swimming, swimming, swimming,
swimming, swimming, swimming.

380
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,067
-Jess!

381
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,633
Je-e-e-e-e-ss!

382
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,600
-Pete, what the fuck?

383
00:26:21,633 --> 00:26:23,733
Hi.

384
00:26:39,533 --> 00:26:41,300
-Hey.

385
00:26:42,733 --> 00:26:44,667
It's good to see you.

386
00:26:46,733 --> 00:26:48,667
-You too.

387
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:52,533
-Come here.

388
00:26:52,567 --> 00:26:54,100
Spin cycle!
Spin cycle! Spin cycle!

389
00:26:54,133 --> 00:26:57,267
Spin cycle! Spin cycle!
- Peter, Jesus Christ!

390
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,133
Yes!

391
00:27:00,167 --> 00:27:02,033
Man.

392
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:03,667
-Fucking asshole.

393
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,633
You walked right into that.

394
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:15,767
Aaah!

395
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,333
Jesus Christ!

396
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:20,233
Why are you keeping
a dead armadillo back here?

397
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:26,500
So, that must be its

398
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,367
Do you want to do the honors?

399
00:27:35,533 --> 00:27:40,367
-Our father, who art in heaven,
hallowed...

400
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,633
I guess that's good.

401
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:09,700
-I think we should tell her.

402
00:28:11,433 --> 00:28:13,700
- I don't know, Pete.
- I think we should do it.

403
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,600
Come on, we have to
eventually, right?

404
00:28:16,633 --> 00:28:18,667
- Yeah, but...
- Let's do it. Let's tell her.

405
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,800
-Tell me what?

406
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:21,300
-It's nothing.

407
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:24,367
- Big news, Jess!
- Watch the road.

408
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,400
-No. Yeah, sorry.
Big... but big news.

409
00:28:26,433 --> 00:28:28,367
-Don't you think it's
a little early?

410
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,043
-Shh. Sophie, this is gonna be
great, trust me.

411
00:28:30,067 --> 00:28:32,033
She's gonna love this.
She's gonna be so pumped.

412
00:28:32,067 --> 00:28:33,667
Jess.
- Watch the road!

413
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,633
-Yeah, I know.

414
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:37,133
-Okay, let's just wait
until a better time.

415
00:28:37,167 --> 00:28:39,633
- What is it, Pete?
- Okay...

416
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:42,367
- Okay, watch the road.
- Okay, watch the road.

417
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,400
-Sophie and I
are engaged to be married.

418
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:47,233
There it is!

419
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:50,100
There it is, big "j"!

420
00:28:50,133 --> 00:28:51,667
Right?

421
00:28:52,767 --> 00:28:54,400
-You guys are idiots.

422
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,733
-Well, Jess,
I'm genuinely hurt right now.

423
00:28:58,767 --> 00:28:59,733
Come on.

424
00:28:59,767 --> 00:29:01,567
-I'm serious.
That really hurts my feelings.

425
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,467
-Okay, I know it's
sort of sudden.

426
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,800
- What did you expect me to say?
- I don't know.

427
00:29:05,833 --> 00:29:08,433
"Congratulations, guys, that's
really... I'm happy for you."

428
00:29:08,467 --> 00:29:10,500
- Guys, let's just drop it.
- I mean

429
00:29:10,533 --> 00:29:12,700
How long have you guys
been engaged?

430
00:29:12,733 --> 00:29:15,233
-A while, Jess.

431
00:29:15,267 --> 00:29:18,633
A couple hours.
- Great. Wow.

432
00:29:18,667 --> 00:29:20,600
Congratulations.

433
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:23,633
-Okay, look, I know
it's a little bit... crazy.

434
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:24,533
-Yeah.

435
00:29:24,567 --> 00:29:26,533
-I mean, we're not
even really dating.

436
00:29:26,567 --> 00:29:28,567
- Sorry. What?
- Well, it was just started out

437
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,333
as a joke, but I think...
- Have you even told mom and dad?

438
00:29:31,367 --> 00:29:32,733
-Have I...

439
00:29:34,767 --> 00:29:36,500
No. Not yet.

440
00:29:36,533 --> 00:29:38,200
Okay. Well...

441
00:29:38,233 --> 00:29:40,467
-Well, he wanted
to tell you first.

442
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,067
-Yeah, Jess, I'm sorry.

443
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,233
I kind of thought you would be
really happy for US.

444
00:29:44,267 --> 00:29:46,633
There's tax breaks.
- Yeah, there are.

445
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:49,533
-You know what?
I don't even care, Jess.

446
00:29:50,533 --> 00:29:52,367
Sophie and I
are getting married,

447
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,233
and it is gonna be awesome.

448
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,667
- Watch the road!
- No!

449
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,600
-I am marrying
your brother so hard.

450
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:04,067
-Yeah, you are.

451
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,367
Whoo!
- God damn it, Pete!

452
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,300
- Watch it, okay?
- I've... I've got it.

453
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:10,100
And I had it on my knee.
- Okay.

454
00:30:10,133 --> 00:30:12,100
-I like your chin.

455
00:30:12,133 --> 00:30:14,700
I like your teeth...

456
00:30:14,733 --> 00:30:20,500
Your eyelashes and how blond
and sparse your eyelashes are.

457
00:30:20,533 --> 00:30:23,667
And look at these hands.

458
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,667
I think our hands
are the same size.

459
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,600
- I've got small hands.
- Yeah.

460
00:30:28,633 --> 00:30:30,167
That's okay.

461
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,467
Okay, your turn.
- I don't...

462
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,533
-Just one thing
that you like about me.

463
00:30:34,567 --> 00:30:36,533
My god. Are you blushing?

464
00:30:36,567 --> 00:30:38,276
- I don't know.
- Your ears are turning pink.

465
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,367
Eeeeek!
- No.

466
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:44,633
- Is this our anniversary?
- My god. It is.

467
00:30:44,667 --> 00:30:45,600
-Yeah.

468
00:30:45,633 --> 00:30:47,367
-So, what should our song be?

469
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,409
Hey, Jess, what do you
think our song should be?

470
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:51,767
- Maybe, like, a slow jam?
- You know what?

471
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,800
What if we just turn on
the radio right now?

472
00:30:53,833 --> 00:30:55,700
Whatever's playing...
- Is gonna be...

473
00:30:55,733 --> 00:30:58,533
- That's gonna be our song.
- Totally.

474
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,233
-This is a test of the...

475
00:31:06,267 --> 00:31:08,600
- Shit.
Shit. No.

476
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:10,567
- I'm okay with it.
- Hey, what's wrong?

477
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,233
- During emergencies is being...
- Pete, it's your sister.

478
00:31:13,267 --> 00:31:16,400
- Official messages would
have followed the alert tone.

479
00:31:16,433 --> 00:31:18,500
This concludes this test
of the emergency...

480
00:31:18,533 --> 00:31:20,200
-Jess.

481
00:31:20,233 --> 00:31:21,733
Jess.

482
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:26,233
Jess.

483
00:31:26,267 --> 00:31:28,233
Okay, I'll call bradman.

484
00:31:28,267 --> 00:31:30,100
-You can't. No.

485
00:31:30,133 --> 00:31:33,533
- This is a test of the...
- Can we just

486
00:31:33,567 --> 00:31:36,300
Turn off the freaking radio?

487
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:38,100
Yeah, sorry.

488
00:31:38,133 --> 00:31:39,576
-If this had been an actual
emergency, official messages

489
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,167
would've followed...

490
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,700
Okay.

491
00:31:43,733 --> 00:31:45,433
-Hey, Jess, what's wrong?

492
00:31:45,467 --> 00:31:47,267
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Okay.

493
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,633
-Um, no, you have to talk
about it. What are you...

494
00:31:49,667 --> 00:31:51,633
-I don't have to talk
about anything!

495
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:53,567
-Yes, you do.
You're crying. You're upset.

496
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,367
- Okay, Pete, leave her alone.
- What?

497
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,767
-She doesn't want to
talk about it.

498
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,709
-I-I'm just saying...
Jess, tell US what is wrong!

499
00:31:58,733 --> 00:32:00,767
-Bard broke up with me!

500
00:32:03,233 --> 00:32:05,633
He...

501
00:32:07,667 --> 00:32:10,533
What did you do?
- What the fuck, Pete?!

502
00:32:10,567 --> 00:32:13,700
-What?! I ju... but it...
Bradman!

503
00:32:13,733 --> 00:32:16,567
-Just shut up, Pete! I don't
want to hear it! Shut up!

504
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,400
I'm sorry. It's just...

505
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,167
We were gonna go
to bonnaroo together.

506
00:32:30,267 --> 00:32:33,333
-Hey, guys. Hey.

507
00:32:33,367 --> 00:32:37,133
Hey. It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.

508
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,700
Guys.

509
00:32:41,733 --> 00:32:44,033
God damn it.

510
00:32:44,067 --> 00:32:46,367
Pull over. Just pull over.

511
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,233
I don't like it when people cry.

512
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:50,800
-Bonnaroo is ruined.

513
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,500
Okay. I deleted his number.

514
00:33:04,533 --> 00:33:06,200
It's done.

515
00:33:06,233 --> 00:33:08,400
-Thanks.

516
00:33:18,233 --> 00:33:20,100
This is perfect.

517
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,533
-Did you leave it in drive?

518
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:25,733
-Check, um... check if...
Check. Is it in drive?

519
00:33:25,767 --> 00:33:28,100
-No, I know how to
drive a car, you guys!

520
00:33:31,233 --> 00:33:33,500
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

521
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,233
-Hey, is it okay
if I wear these glasses?

522
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:39,100
I'm sorry. I didn't ask.

523
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:41,167
-It's fine.

524
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,533
-Thanks.

525
00:33:48,367 --> 00:33:51,300
-So, do you guys
want to call AAA?

526
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,033
I can call. That's fine.

527
00:34:02,233 --> 00:34:04,367
Cool.

528
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,800
-You guys know
you can't do this, right?

529
00:34:06,833 --> 00:34:08,767
-Do what?

530
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,233
-Get married.

531
00:34:11,267 --> 00:34:13,067
- How old are you?
- 24.

532
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,467
-Yeah, no, that's legal, Jess.

533
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,367
No, I mean

534
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,767
You can't just decide
to get married.

535
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,800
It doesn't work like that.

536
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:24,700
- Yeah, it does.
- Yeah, of course you can.

537
00:34:24,733 --> 00:34:26,400
That's what everybody
does, Jess.

538
00:34:26,433 --> 00:34:27,609
Name one person that's married

539
00:34:27,633 --> 00:34:29,333
that didn't decide
to get married.

540
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:31,700
- Arranged marriages.
- No, it's like...

541
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:38,233
What you guys are doing
is basically an insult

542
00:34:38,267 --> 00:34:40,633
to the whole concept
of marriage.

543
00:34:40,667 --> 00:34:43,400
-You seem like you're
getting upset.

544
00:34:43,433 --> 00:34:44,809
I'm not getting upset.

545
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:47,267
I just want you to understand
that this is insane.

546
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,400
Wow, yeah, you're, like,

547
00:34:48,433 --> 00:34:50,067
definitely getting
upset right now.

548
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,409
- I'm not!
- Please don't cry again,

549
00:34:51,433 --> 00:34:53,200
'cause that was
really rough on me earlier.

550
00:34:53,233 --> 00:34:55,800
-Shh! Pete. If your sister wants
to cry, you got to let her cry.

551
00:34:55,833 --> 00:34:58,100
- I'm not gonna cry.
- Okay, but if you want to,

552
00:34:58,133 --> 00:34:59,376
you can cry.
- I'm not gonna cry.

553
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,333
- Okay.
- Well, then come down here

554
00:35:01,367 --> 00:35:03,600
and play bottle wars with US.
It's soothing.

555
00:35:03,633 --> 00:35:06,533
-I would, but you guys
are just too good at it.

556
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,600
Y'all need some help?

557
00:35:24,633 --> 00:35:27,667
No, man, we're good.
We got a mechanic coming.

558
00:35:40,667 --> 00:35:43,767
Yeah, this is...
This is no problem.

559
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,233
Look, I'll have you guys up and
running by, by morning.

560
00:35:47,267 --> 00:35:49,567
- Morning?
- Yeah, no problem.

561
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,700
Look you guys
must've hit something,

562
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:54,600
'cause there's all kinds of like
gristle, like, caught in there,

563
00:35:54,633 --> 00:35:57,333
And the oil pan's like...

564
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,167
Anyway, I'll...
I'll figure it out, so... ohp.

565
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,500
Don't worry about a thing.

566
00:36:05,533 --> 00:36:06,300
Um...

567
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:08,233
I'll wait here
for the tow truck,

568
00:36:08,267 --> 00:36:10,733
and I'll get somebody to drive
you guys out to the motel.

569
00:36:10,767 --> 00:36:13,200
Motel.

570
00:36:13,233 --> 00:36:14,700
-Okay!

571
00:36:14,733 --> 00:36:16,300
Thanks.

572
00:36:16,333 --> 00:36:17,633
Yeah, no problem.

573
00:36:17,667 --> 00:36:20,633
I'll...
I'll just call the shop, so...

574
00:36:20,667 --> 00:36:22,667
He said a motel?

575
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,800
-Mom?

576
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:29,333
Hi.

577
00:36:35,633 --> 00:36:39,367
-I got y'all a pizza.
Pepperoni.

578
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,733
Yum.

579
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,533
-Lucky number 208.

580
00:36:51,533 --> 00:36:54,100
Hey, it might be fun, right?

581
00:36:54,133 --> 00:36:57,200
I don't want to blow
your guys' minds or anything...

582
00:36:57,233 --> 00:36:59,200
But there's
a free breakfast buffet.

583
00:37:01,267 --> 00:37:03,433
Great.

584
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:11,533
Wah!

585
00:37:26,533 --> 00:37:28,467
-Whee!

586
00:37:30,267 --> 00:37:32,567
Aah! Aah!

587
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,200
- Am I doing it?
- Please kick harder. God.

588
00:37:35,233 --> 00:37:37,467
-Can you lift your arms?

589
00:37:46,567 --> 00:37:48,333
-Hey! Aah!

590
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,567
Aah!

591
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,400
My girls!

592
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,367
-You know,
I lived in a motel once.

593
00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:40,667
I mean, not in a room...
In the basement.

594
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,500
But it was nice.

595
00:38:43,533 --> 00:38:48,000
The dryers were down there,
so it was warm.

596
00:38:49,633 --> 00:38:51,667
But that was only
for like a year.

597
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,000
-Cool.

598
00:38:57,267 --> 00:38:58,700
-Hey.

599
00:39:00,233 --> 00:39:03,067
Hey, girl, hey.

600
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,533
Brad's an idiot.

601
00:39:04,567 --> 00:39:07,467
-No, he's actually really smart.

602
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,100
-Really?

603
00:39:10,467 --> 00:39:12,767
Well, you know what I think?

604
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,667
Right, you probably do not
want me giving you advice.

605
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,167
Sorry. No, I...

606
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,500
I could actually handle
some advice.

607
00:39:24,533 --> 00:39:28,267
-Okay, well,
before Pete and I got engaged...

608
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,367
-You mean...

609
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,300
Before this morning?

610
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:34,533
-Yeah. Before this morning.

611
00:39:34,567 --> 00:39:39,467
Yeah, I just used to think
that all guys were just...

612
00:39:40,767 --> 00:39:43,700
What would
you do with a drunken sailor?

613
00:39:43,733 --> 00:39:45,700
What would you do
with a drunken sailor?

614
00:39:45,733 --> 00:39:47,533
What would you do
with a drunken sailor?

615
00:39:47,567 --> 00:39:49,700
-You were happy
with Brad, right?

616
00:39:52,133 --> 00:39:53,733
-I guess so, yeah.

617
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:56,500
-Okay, but were you happy
because of Brad,

618
00:39:56,533 --> 00:40:00,500
or because you told
yourself you were happy?

619
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:04,400
I'm sorry.
I do not know what I am saying.

620
00:40:04,433 --> 00:40:07,067
I am not very good
at this sort of stuff.

621
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,767
-No, no, it's... it's fine.

622
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,667
-Okay, so, things didn't
work out with you and Brad.

623
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,333
You need to find something
that makes you happy,

624
00:40:15,367 --> 00:40:17,100
and then just go for it.

625
00:40:17,133 --> 00:40:20,400
You know, you need to chase it
like a leopard, right?

626
00:40:20,433 --> 00:40:23,133
And, you know,
fuck everyone else.

627
00:40:23,167 --> 00:40:24,533
Fuck what they think.

628
00:40:24,567 --> 00:40:29,367
You are an adult
with really pretty skin

629
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:34,467
and a fantastic body image,
as evidenced by these...

630
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:39,500
Wonderfully exotic and bold
choice of bathing suits.

631
00:40:39,533 --> 00:40:41,767
- Thanks.
- Dick-bags like Brad

632
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,033
are just gonna bring you down,
so you know what? Fuck Brad.

633
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:47,100
Fuck... fuck him.

634
00:40:47,133 --> 00:40:49,300
And don't... don't fuck him,
don't go back to him,

635
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:51,067
but fuck what he thinks.

636
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,767
You know, pretty soon, you're
gonna not even know who Brad is.

637
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,809
You're... you're not even gonna
be thinking about Brad.

638
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:58,367
You're gonna be living your life
and being like, "Brad who?"

639
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,133
And then people
are gonna be like,

640
00:41:00,167 --> 00:41:02,467
"hey, Jess, where'd Brad go?"
And you're gonna be like,

641
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,467
"I don't know who's Brad.
And Brad? My god.

642
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,100
Do you know what
he's gonna be like?"

643
00:41:06,133 --> 00:41:07,633
- Sophie.
- Yeah?

644
00:41:07,667 --> 00:41:09,633
-Could you just
stop saying Brad?

645
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:13,100
-Yes. There it is right there.
That's the first step.

646
00:41:13,133 --> 00:41:14,767
Trust me.

647
00:41:16,667 --> 00:41:19,167
Jessica Stephen Avery...
- That's Pete's middle name.

648
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,533
- What is
the one thing you want...

649
00:41:21,567 --> 00:41:23,767
One thing
that you want right now

650
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,667
more than anything
in the entire world?

651
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,500
-I just want to be drunk.

652
00:41:31,533 --> 00:41:34,600
-Girl, you are already
on your way.

653
00:41:34,633 --> 00:41:36,500
Pete!

654
00:41:36,533 --> 00:41:37,733
Peter!

655
00:41:37,767 --> 00:41:40,100
-What?

656
00:41:40,133 --> 00:41:41,300
-Hey, come on, let's go.

657
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:43,067
We're getting
your sister trashed.

658
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,067
-Whoo!

659
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,100
- Yeah!
- Okay.

660
00:41:46,133 --> 00:41:48,467
I'll rinse off and over.
- Okay.

661
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,133
- My god.
It is loud in there.

662
00:43:39,167 --> 00:43:42,633
-Dude, what are you doing?
That guy was hitting on me!

663
00:43:42,667 --> 00:43:45,100
-What? No way. Are you serious?

664
00:43:45,133 --> 00:43:48,500
Clearly! And you're all like,
"Hi, how are you?"

665
00:43:48,533 --> 00:43:50,500
You got to look out for me, man!

666
00:43:50,533 --> 00:43:53,233
- You're my...
- Fiancé.

667
00:43:53,267 --> 00:43:55,600
I got this.

668
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,400
Pete.

669
00:43:57,433 --> 00:43:59,600
Hey, Pete. Wait.

670
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,300
-You want some ice?

671
00:44:08,333 --> 00:44:11,500
-No. No, I'm good. I'm good.

672
00:44:13,367 --> 00:44:15,500
Let's just go.

673
00:44:15,533 --> 00:44:18,167
-What?
No. Hey, we're having fun.

674
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,600
This is fun.
Jess.

675
00:44:20,633 --> 00:44:23,100
-I'm having fun.

676
00:44:23,133 --> 00:44:25,233
-See?

677
00:44:25,267 --> 00:44:27,700
-Guys, this is ridiculous.
Let's just go.

678
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,200
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

679
00:44:31,233 --> 00:44:32,700
- Quitter.
- Shut up.

680
00:44:32,733 --> 00:44:34,733
- Fucking make me.
- God damn it, Jess.

681
00:44:34,767 --> 00:44:36,733
Fine. You know what?
I'm ready. Let's go.

682
00:44:36,767 --> 00:44:37,533
-Okay.

683
00:44:37,567 --> 00:44:39,400
-You guys can go,
but I'm staying.

684
00:44:39,433 --> 00:44:41,733
- Nope, nope.
We're all going together.

685
00:44:41,767 --> 00:44:43,500
-Nope, nope, I'm staying.

686
00:44:43,533 --> 00:44:45,600
-Quit being such a whiner, Jess.

687
00:44:45,633 --> 00:44:48,767
Bradman broke up with you.
Wah! Big freakin' whoop!

688
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,433
- Pete.
- Pete, that is majorly rude.

689
00:44:51,467 --> 00:44:53,800
Yeah, majorly.

690
00:44:53,833 --> 00:44:55,367
Look, just...

691
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,600
Aah! You know what?
Just do what you want, okay?

692
00:44:57,633 --> 00:44:59,200
- Fine. I will.
- Great.

693
00:44:59,233 --> 00:45:00,600
-Great. Cool.

694
00:45:00,633 --> 00:45:02,667
You guys better not be
having sex when I get back.

695
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:16,067
Dude, it's weird.

696
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,500
They gave US
these little travel toothpastes

697
00:45:18,533 --> 00:45:20,200
but no little toothbrushes.

698
00:45:20,233 --> 00:45:23,100
That's crazy.

699
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,333
-I guess I'll just
use my finger.

700
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:46,367
- Hey.
- Hey.

701
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,500
Is this seat taken?

702
00:46:48,533 --> 00:46:52,333
Nope.

703
00:47:13,267 --> 00:47:15,100
-I'm naked.

704
00:47:15,133 --> 00:47:17,067
I...

705
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,433
I'm sorry.

706
00:47:18,467 --> 00:47:20,433
I'm gonna put my...
My boxers back on,

707
00:47:20,467 --> 00:47:23,400
but I just...
Wanted to tell you that.

708
00:47:23,433 --> 00:47:25,367
I don't know what I was...
- No, no.

709
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,067
- Hey, hey.
- Sorry.

710
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:31,267
-Oop. Um, how about I just meet
you in the middle?

711
00:47:32,833 --> 00:47:34,767
-Okay.

712
00:47:37,533 --> 00:47:39,733
All right.

713
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,433
Um, I'm kind of nervous.

714
00:48:11,067 --> 00:48:12,500
-It's okay.

715
00:48:12,533 --> 00:48:15,767
I was thinking that we can wait
till marriage anyway.

716
00:48:17,467 --> 00:48:19,233
Yeah.

717
00:48:19,267 --> 00:48:20,733
Yeah.

718
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,633
-I'm nervous, too.

719
00:48:27,767 --> 00:48:29,200
-Yeah?

720
00:48:29,233 --> 00:48:31,467
-Yeah.

721
00:48:40,133 --> 00:48:41,600
Do you mind?

722
00:48:41,633 --> 00:48:43,000
No.

723
00:48:44,667 --> 00:48:47,733
You're... invited.

724
00:48:51,833 --> 00:48:54,100
-Are you... are you comfortable?

725
00:48:54,133 --> 00:48:56,533
-Yeah.

726
00:48:56,567 --> 00:48:58,767
-Cool.

727
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:31,567
Hey. Come back.

728
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,033
Hey, guys, it's Jessica.

729
00:49:34,067 --> 00:49:37,667
If you're hearing this, you're
not with me, so that sucks.

730
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:38,867
-Babe, check this out.

731
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:41,200
-Anyways, leave a message,
and I'll try to call you back.

732
00:49:42,267 --> 00:49:44,267
-Jess, it's me. Where are you?

733
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:45,767
Call me back. Bye.

734
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:49,100
It's me, Pete.
I'm... I'm in the room.

735
00:49:49,133 --> 00:49:50,533
Actually, I'm outside.

736
00:49:50,567 --> 00:49:52,333
Now i'm...
I'm back in the room now.

737
00:49:52,367 --> 00:49:54,167
I'm sorry.
Okay, call me back. Bye.

738
00:49:55,467 --> 00:49:57,533
What?

739
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,100
Your sister's super tidy.

740
00:50:05,267 --> 00:50:07,533
Okay.

741
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,700
-Her phone's off. Her phone's
off, which is typical Jess.

742
00:50:11,733 --> 00:50:13,233
You know, that's,
like, so standard.

743
00:50:13,267 --> 00:50:14,800
That's exactly what she does.

744
00:50:14,833 --> 00:50:17,700
-She... her phone probably just
died, and she just lost her key

745
00:50:17,733 --> 00:50:19,767
- and couldn't get into the room.
- Mnh-mnh.

746
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,767
She would've knocked.
She would've knocked.

747
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,767
-Hey, hey.
Pete, I'm sure nothing happened.

748
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,733
-She probably just went home
with someone.

749
00:50:28,767 --> 00:50:30,667
-No. What?

750
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,267
No! She... that's not...

751
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,233
She wouldn't... she doesn't...

752
00:50:34,267 --> 00:50:36,367
- What if she was murdered?
- No.

753
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,200
-We should turn on the news.

754
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,433
-This is a test
of the broadcast stations...

755
00:50:45,467 --> 00:50:48,767
Our song.

756
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:04,633
I don't understand.
You said by morning.

757
00:51:04,667 --> 00:51:08,400
Well, we ran
into a couple of problems.

758
00:51:08,433 --> 00:51:11,133
-Dude, you said "no problem"
like five times!

759
00:51:11,167 --> 00:51:12,733
Totally my bad.

760
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:16,033
Tomorrow morning definitely,
and I think,

761
00:51:16,067 --> 00:51:19,400
I'm pretty confident I have
this one figured out, so, yeah.

762
00:51:19,433 --> 00:51:22,100
By the way, I...
I borrowed that.

763
00:51:22,133 --> 00:51:23,700
Really good movie.

764
00:51:24,733 --> 00:51:27,500
-Are you sure
she did not come by?

765
00:51:27,533 --> 00:51:28,467
-Yes.

766
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,300
Hey.
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

767
00:51:35,333 --> 00:51:37,467
We're gonna find her.

768
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,467
-Okay?

769
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,300
Hey.

770
00:51:40,333 --> 00:51:43,167
- No.
- Okay?

771
00:52:20,667 --> 00:52:22,200
Just stop!

772
00:52:22,233 --> 00:52:23,533
Just quit it!

773
00:52:23,567 --> 00:52:26,400
If you want to help,
then help, but you're not.

774
00:52:26,433 --> 00:52:29,067
We have to find Jess, okay?

775
00:52:30,633 --> 00:52:33,767
-Hey, maybe she went home
with someone from the bar.

776
00:52:36,133 --> 00:52:38,400
I hate this bar.

777
00:52:39,267 --> 00:52:40,600
-Hey, Timmy!

778
00:52:40,633 --> 00:52:42,667
Great.

779
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,100
-How's your mom?

780
00:52:44,133 --> 00:52:45,433
-He used to be to be my stepdad.

781
00:52:45,467 --> 00:52:47,433
I'm just gonna hang out
back here by the car.

782
00:52:47,467 --> 00:52:50,500
-Okay. Bye, Timmy.

783
00:52:50,533 --> 00:52:53,567
- Hi. We were here last night.
- Inside of the bar.

784
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:56,300
-And we lost our friend
that we were with.

785
00:52:56,333 --> 00:52:58,200
-My sister, actually.
She never came home.

786
00:52:58,233 --> 00:52:59,600
-Maybe you've seen her?

787
00:52:59,633 --> 00:53:02,233
-She looks like me,
but she's shorter and a girl,

788
00:53:02,267 --> 00:53:05,133
so I guess, in that sense,
she looks kind of like her.

789
00:53:05,167 --> 00:53:07,033
-So like a cross
between him and me.

790
00:53:07,067 --> 00:53:08,800
- But more blonde.
- Right.

791
00:53:08,833 --> 00:53:10,500
-She... she highlights.

792
00:53:10,533 --> 00:53:14,400
-I see a lot of blondes...
Natural blondes, too.

793
00:53:14,433 --> 00:53:16,533
-Okay, give me your phone.

794
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,433
Her.

795
00:53:22,467 --> 00:53:25,367
Okay. I remember her.

796
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,733
Yes!

797
00:53:26,767 --> 00:53:29,133
-Yeah, she went home
with someone.

798
00:53:29,167 --> 00:53:31,300
- You're a fucking liar, man!
- Okay, Pete, slow down.

799
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:32,767
Slow down.
It's okay, really.

800
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,133
- I'm sorry. I know.
- Okay, she'll probably call.

801
00:53:35,167 --> 00:53:37,667
We'll just hang around and wait.
It's not a big deal.

802
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,767
-No, I think maybe you're
thinking of someone else.

803
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,533
So, if you could just look at...

804
00:53:42,567 --> 00:53:45,300
Just look.
She's not that type of girl.

805
00:53:45,333 --> 00:53:47,033
-Okay, you know what?

806
00:53:47,067 --> 00:53:49,500
Let's go back to that frosty
shop that we saw on the way in.

807
00:53:49,533 --> 00:53:51,500
-No. It was definitely her.

808
00:53:51,533 --> 00:53:55,267
She left, like, in a big Van
with... with a man.

809
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:59,000
6'2", beard down to here.

810
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,500
- Ungh!
- Pete!

811
00:54:01,533 --> 00:54:05,533
Pete! How is she supposed to
call if you break your phone?

812
00:54:08,133 --> 00:54:10,433
-Is there anything else
that we should know?

813
00:54:10,467 --> 00:54:12,333
-He wore a necklace....

814
00:54:12,367 --> 00:54:14,767
Made of animal bones.

815
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,233
-Okay, yeah,
we need to find your sister.

816
00:54:19,533 --> 00:54:22,033
-Hey, Timmy!
Tell your mom I'll call her!

817
00:54:22,067 --> 00:54:24,633
-She doesn't want to
talk to you, man!

818
00:54:24,667 --> 00:54:26,433
God!

819
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,033
-Did I break it?

820
00:55:00,567 --> 00:55:02,567
Hey.

821
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,667
-Hey.

822
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,367
How's the tea?

823
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:10,533
Not very good.

824
00:55:10,567 --> 00:55:14,033
Well, that's why
I'm drinking the coffee.

825
00:55:17,067 --> 00:55:19,100
-So, you live out here?

826
00:55:19,133 --> 00:55:21,100
I live where I want.

827
00:55:21,133 --> 00:55:23,133
I'm a wanderer.

828
00:55:23,167 --> 00:55:25,233
-Must be nice.

829
00:55:25,267 --> 00:55:28,500
-It is what it is.

830
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:31,567
We're all wanderers
in our own way.

831
00:55:33,733 --> 00:55:35,333
You're going to L.A.?

832
00:55:35,367 --> 00:55:38,100
- Yeah.
Could you tell?

833
00:55:38,133 --> 00:55:42,233
No, you just said it
like 300 times last night.

834
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,367
Sorry. Sometimes I just...

835
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,467
I feel like people
can tell a lot about me

836
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:51,633
just by looking at me, you know?

837
00:55:51,667 --> 00:55:54,233
-I've been looking
at you this whole time,

838
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:57,767
and I don't know
anything about you.

839
00:56:01,633 --> 00:56:03,200
You, um...

840
00:56:03,233 --> 00:56:05,133
You still need a ride?

841
00:56:05,167 --> 00:56:07,667
-You going to California?

842
00:56:09,267 --> 00:56:10,733
-I'm a wanderer.

843
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:13,233
-Right.

844
00:56:13,267 --> 00:56:17,100
-Do you feel like, um...

845
00:56:17,133 --> 00:56:19,167
Do you feel like something...

846
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,667
Something brought US together?

847
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,267
Something...

848
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,733
You know,
something bigger than US?

849
00:56:25,767 --> 00:56:27,333
-Yeah.

850
00:56:27,367 --> 00:56:29,433
Tanqueray.

851
00:56:31,533 --> 00:56:33,700
-We all got
different names for it.

852
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:52,000
-So, beard and a necklace.

853
00:56:53,567 --> 00:56:56,000
Yeah, I know
where that guy lives.

854
00:57:11,133 --> 00:57:12,633
Whoo!

855
00:57:12,667 --> 00:57:14,633
-Whoa!

856
00:57:19,133 --> 00:57:23,067
-6'2" with a beard down to here

857
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:25,700
and a necklace made of...

858
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:29,500
Animal bones.

859
00:57:30,767 --> 00:57:33,067
I think you guys
are looking for Chuck.

860
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:34,300
-Yeah.

861
00:57:34,333 --> 00:57:36,233
Okay, I mean,
I don't know. Maybe.

862
00:57:36,267 --> 00:57:38,167
-We're...
We're looking for his sister.

863
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,233
-Yeah, she's blonde,
kind of hot.

864
00:57:40,267 --> 00:57:42,100
Yeah.

865
00:57:42,133 --> 00:57:43,367
-You saw her?

866
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:46,067
- Yeah, we...
We heard her.

867
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,100
Loud.

868
00:57:48,133 --> 00:57:50,667
-Do you know where they went?

869
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,567
-Where?

870
00:57:54,133 --> 00:57:55,367
No.

871
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,633
We don't really know where.

872
00:57:57,667 --> 00:57:59,533
Maybe the highway?

873
00:57:59,567 --> 00:58:02,367
Where do you think they went?

874
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,500
-Yeah. Could've been...
Could've been the highway.

875
00:58:05,533 --> 00:58:08,500
-Yeah, I think the highway's
a pretty good place to start.

876
00:58:09,533 --> 00:58:11,500
-Or maybe the frosty shop,
actually.

877
00:58:11,533 --> 00:58:15,067
-No. Remember?
The frosty shop's still closed.

878
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,300
That's right.

879
00:58:16,333 --> 00:58:18,100
Prostitution thing.

880
00:58:18,133 --> 00:58:21,133
-Maybe... home depot.

881
00:58:21,167 --> 00:58:23,033
Or maybe just the highway.

882
00:58:23,067 --> 00:58:25,567
-Okay, so, you think they
went maybe that direction?

883
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:28,500
- Yeah.
- Okay, great.

884
00:58:28,533 --> 00:58:29,533
-Great.

885
00:58:29,567 --> 00:58:32,433
-Really appreciate it, guys.
Thank you so much.

886
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:40,633
-You're welcome.

887
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:43,767
Kind of nice.

888
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,767
-Yeah. I like them.

889
00:59:22,533 --> 00:59:24,300
So...

890
00:59:24,333 --> 00:59:25,767
Where'd y'all meet?

891
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,367
Internet?

892
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,100
What's your sister's number?

893
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:31,667
I'll call it from my phone.

894
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,300
Yeah. Sure,

895
00:59:33,333 --> 00:59:35,100
1-800-i-don't-know-it.

896
00:59:35,133 --> 00:59:37,800
You don't know
your sister's number?

897
00:59:37,833 --> 00:59:39,767
-No.
I'm sorry, Sophie.

898
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:43,067
I'm sorry for being
such an idiot.

899
00:59:47,133 --> 00:59:49,700
-Where are we even going, guys?

900
00:59:49,733 --> 00:59:53,333
What, are we just gonna drive
around forever here?

901
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:59,400
Cool.
Great. This is effective.

902
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,767
Hello?

903
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,667
Yeah, this is her.

904
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,500
Which one is this?

905
01:00:14,533 --> 01:00:16,400
Um...

906
01:00:17,567 --> 01:00:20,633
Okay.
Yeah, I got that.

907
01:00:20,667 --> 01:00:23,200
Yeah, I can do that.
I can do that.

908
01:00:23,233 --> 01:00:25,367
I'll be... I'll be there.

909
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,233
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

910
01:00:27,267 --> 01:00:29,700
Um... all right.

911
01:00:29,733 --> 01:00:32,000
I'll see you then. Bye.

912
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:37,367
I, booked the commercial.

913
01:00:38,467 --> 01:00:40,400
-The hot-dog thing?

914
01:00:40,433 --> 01:00:45,100
- Yeah, it shoots tomorrow.
- Wow. Okay.

915
01:00:45,133 --> 01:00:47,767
Um... we'll...
We'll find Jess.

916
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:50,633
The car will be ready
tomorrow morning.

917
01:00:50,667 --> 01:00:51,733
We'll leave really early.

918
01:00:51,767 --> 01:00:55,233
I can run lines with you
in the car on the way back.

919
01:00:55,267 --> 01:00:59,300
Or are there lines, or is it
just the... like, the eating?

920
01:00:59,333 --> 01:01:03,467
-No, I...
I think I should go home.

921
01:01:06,267 --> 01:01:08,633
I need to go home.

922
01:01:08,667 --> 01:01:11,333
Like now.

923
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:14,467
-Hey. Congratulations.

924
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:17,100
-I mean, guys, we could drive
around all day and night

925
01:01:17,133 --> 01:01:18,533
looking for her
and not find her.

926
01:01:18,567 --> 01:01:21,100
I really... I really need to go.

927
01:01:21,133 --> 01:01:22,767
-Okay, so, we just give up?

928
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:26,400
-Yeah, I'm sorry.
I will take a bus.

929
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:32,533
-I thought this was just
some stupid, local commercial.

930
01:01:32,567 --> 01:01:35,467
-Yeah, it is... it's just
a stupid, local commercial

931
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:38,200
that I need to pay my rent.

932
01:01:41,133 --> 01:01:43,533
-My sister could be dead,
you know.

933
01:01:43,567 --> 01:01:45,767
Pete, she's not dead.

934
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,433
She went home
with somebody from a bar.

935
01:01:48,467 --> 01:01:51,333
It's not that big of a deal.
That's what people do.

936
01:01:51,367 --> 01:01:53,167
-That's what you do.

937
01:01:55,333 --> 01:01:57,333
Then I should know.

938
01:01:57,367 --> 01:02:00,033
And you know what?
I know why she hasn't called.

939
01:02:00,067 --> 01:02:04,200
She hasn't called because she is
with some weird, tall guy,

940
01:02:04,233 --> 01:02:07,367
and they are busy,
probably, fucking.

941
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:08,767
He's fucking her.

942
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:11,067
You know what? There might be
more than one guy.

943
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:12,333
There might be multiple guys

944
01:02:12,367 --> 01:02:14,633
and there are all sorts of dicks
up in her mouth,

945
01:02:14,667 --> 01:02:17,433
just fucking her mouth,
and then there are dicks

946
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:19,700
just all up in her ass,
just fucking...

947
01:02:19,733 --> 01:02:22,567
Just fucking her ass.

948
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:27,667
-She's your family, too, Sophie.

949
01:02:28,833 --> 01:02:31,400
No, Pete, she's not.

950
01:02:31,433 --> 01:02:33,667
-Well, not technically yet.

951
01:02:35,367 --> 01:02:37,067
-Pete, it's a joke.

952
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:39,500
-There's nothing funny
about your sister-in-law

953
01:02:39,533 --> 01:02:42,700
in some group,
gang-bang sex party.

954
01:02:42,733 --> 01:02:44,333
It's not funny.

955
01:02:44,367 --> 01:02:47,667
-No, you and I are a joke.

956
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:49,800
US.

957
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:51,700
We're not fiancés.

958
01:02:51,733 --> 01:02:54,767
We were never gonna be some
happy married couple, okay?

959
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,667
It's just a stupid idea.

960
01:02:59,133 --> 01:03:01,000
We're neighbors.

961
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:05,767
I use your Wi-Fi.

962
01:03:11,767 --> 01:03:15,333
-You can pull over
wherever, man. We're good.

963
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:01,233
-What were you thinking?

964
01:04:01,267 --> 01:04:03,167
-How could you do this
to your brother?

965
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,500
-How could you do this
to Sophie?

966
01:04:04,533 --> 01:04:05,676
-You know, we've been
driving around all day.

967
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:07,500
-You could've...
You could've called.

968
01:04:07,533 --> 01:04:08,500
You could've picked up the
phone. You could've called.

969
01:04:08,533 --> 01:04:10,067
-Pete thought you were dead!

970
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:11,743
-I could only assume
at some point! What else...

971
01:04:11,767 --> 01:04:14,033
- And who the fuck is this guy?!
- Seriously.

972
01:04:14,067 --> 01:04:16,767
He... he looks like uncle Craig.

973
01:04:19,133 --> 01:04:20,633
You know what?

974
01:04:20,667 --> 01:04:23,133
I'm gonna go talk to him.
- Yeah, I think you should.

975
01:04:23,167 --> 01:04:24,700
I think I will.

976
01:04:24,733 --> 01:04:29,267
-I'm gonna go see what this...
Jerk is all about.

977
01:04:33,533 --> 01:04:36,700
-Look, Jess. I get it, okay?

978
01:04:36,733 --> 01:04:38,633
I mean,
I personally have hitchhiked

979
01:04:38,667 --> 01:04:41,100
across several states,
but you know what?

980
01:04:41,133 --> 01:04:42,376
Did you even stop for one second

981
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,100
to think about
how irresponsible this was?

982
01:04:44,133 --> 01:04:45,633
No. What...

983
01:04:45,667 --> 01:04:48,467
What, am I gonna through every
decision like, "I wonder

984
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:51,033
what this means for my brother
and his fake girlfriend"?

985
01:04:51,067 --> 01:04:53,300
-Yes. Yes, that is exactly
what you should be doing.

986
01:04:53,333 --> 01:04:55,167
You should be thinking
about other people.

987
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,033
You know,
you're not the only person

988
01:04:57,067 --> 01:04:58,500
in this world that counts.

989
01:04:58,533 --> 01:05:00,167
-You told me to have fun.

990
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:03,233
-I didn't tell you to go run off
and disappear with some man

991
01:05:03,267 --> 01:05:05,233
that has animal bones
around his neck.

992
01:05:05,267 --> 01:05:08,033
-They're puka shells!
Jesus Christ!

993
01:05:08,067 --> 01:05:09,433
-That is...

994
01:05:09,467 --> 01:05:12,533
I make some necklaces and some,
turquoise jewelry.

995
01:05:12,567 --> 01:05:15,633
-I don't even know
why I was freaking out earlier,

996
01:05:15,667 --> 01:05:17,233
'cause you are...

997
01:05:17,267 --> 01:05:19,200
You're cool, man. You're great.

998
01:05:19,233 --> 01:05:20,633
-You're cool.

999
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:22,600
What, and you two
are such mature adults?

1000
01:05:22,633 --> 01:05:26,367
-Yes... yes!
And compared to you, yes!

1001
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,267
-You know what?
Perfect. This is great.

1002
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:29,700
I have a great idea for you.

1003
01:05:29,733 --> 01:05:31,743
Why are you wearing
turquoise bracelets?

1004
01:05:31,767 --> 01:05:33,367
-Shh!
No, this is gonna be great.

1005
01:05:35,567 --> 01:05:38,267
- Pete, Sophie...
- What?

1006
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:40,433
- I have a surprise for you.

1007
01:05:40,467 --> 01:05:45,133
Chuck, here, happens to be
an ordained minister.

1008
01:05:45,167 --> 01:05:47,367
-Congrats, man. Very cool.

1009
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:50,100
-I officiated
at my friend bleslie's ceremony

1010
01:05:50,133 --> 01:05:51,367
at lake havasu.

1011
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:54,767
-So, what do you say guys?

1012
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:57,000
You wanted to get married.

1013
01:06:00,133 --> 01:06:03,100
Yeah I don't...

1014
01:06:03,133 --> 01:06:04,633
-It would be an honor.

1015
01:06:04,667 --> 01:06:05,667
-We would love to,

1016
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:08,233
but I actually have to be
getting back to L.A.

1017
01:06:08,267 --> 01:06:11,100
-Yeah, I think it's just bad
timing to do it right now.

1018
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:13,233
-And then,
aside from the timing,

1019
01:06:13,267 --> 01:06:15,633
I mean, there's,
you know, also the things.

1020
01:06:15,667 --> 01:06:18,067
- It's mostly bad timing.
- Really, Pete?

1021
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:21,500
What's going on here?

1022
01:06:21,533 --> 01:06:23,767
-You want to know
what's going on here?

1023
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:26,033
Here's what I see.

1024
01:06:26,067 --> 01:06:28,433
I see two kids who are scared.

1025
01:06:28,467 --> 01:06:31,667
They're in love,
but they're scared.

1026
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:33,633
Of what?

1027
01:06:33,667 --> 01:06:35,133
Of each other.

1028
01:06:35,167 --> 01:06:36,767
Of their love for each other...

1029
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:40,200
Your beautiful love
for each other.

1030
01:06:42,267 --> 01:06:44,367
Now, listen, you two.

1031
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:49,367
This is a tough world,
but you've found something here.

1032
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:53,400
You can choose to ignore it
and go home,

1033
01:06:53,433 --> 01:06:58,100
or you can choose
to be happy together

1034
01:06:58,133 --> 01:06:59,767
in this life,

1035
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:01,800
maybe even the next.

1036
01:07:01,833 --> 01:07:06,267
-So, you gonna chase it
like a leopard?

1037
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:10,167
-Hey, guys.

1038
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:13,033
What's happening? Hey.

1039
01:07:13,067 --> 01:07:14,767
-We're getting married.

1040
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,167
- Right now?
- Right now.

1041
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:20,133
- Right fucking now.
- No.

1042
01:07:20,167 --> 01:07:22,133
Tomorrow.

1043
01:07:22,167 --> 01:07:24,100
Tomorrow morning.

1044
01:07:24,133 --> 01:07:28,400
Tonight is the wedding feast.

1045
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,533
-What about the hot dogs?

1046
01:07:31,567 --> 01:07:34,033
-I don't need those dick-bags.

1047
01:07:34,067 --> 01:07:37,533
Cool.

1048
01:07:37,567 --> 01:07:40,200
Cool!

1049
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,367
Hey, man, 
got you a wedding present.

1050
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,467
I fixed your car.

1051
01:08:03,233 --> 01:08:05,133
- Thanks, man.
- Definitely, definitely.

1052
01:08:05,167 --> 01:08:08,233
You can just, get me
a check or whatever tomorrow.

1053
01:08:09,633 --> 01:08:11,333
Yeah, my mom's
bringing it by later.

1054
01:08:11,367 --> 01:08:12,733
You know how mom's are.

1055
01:08:12,767 --> 01:08:15,200
- For sure.
- Yeah.

1056
01:08:15,233 --> 01:08:16,767
Hot dog?

1057
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,633
- I'm okay.
- Cool.

1058
01:08:22,267 --> 01:08:24,333
So, there's this one.

1059
01:08:24,367 --> 01:08:26,533
I wore it
to the spring semi-formal.

1060
01:08:26,567 --> 01:08:28,667
And there's that one.
- Whoop.

1061
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:30,433
- Um...
- Just look at that one.

1062
01:08:30,467 --> 01:08:33,133
-Yeah, I guess any dress
is fine, then,

1063
01:08:33,167 --> 01:08:35,400
as long as I don't look
like an idiot.

1064
01:08:35,433 --> 01:08:39,167
-Sophie, this is...
This is Marc by Marc Jacobs.

1065
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:42,100
So...
- No, the dress is nice.

1066
01:08:43,533 --> 01:08:47,267
Yeah, I... maybe I should try
and be hot for once.

1067
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:49,400
-You're gonna look great.

1068
01:08:50,267 --> 01:08:53,200
I'm serious.

1069
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:06,333
Sorry for making you guys
drive around all day.

1070
01:09:06,367 --> 01:09:09,233
I probably
should've just called.

1071
01:09:09,267 --> 01:09:10,633
-It's fine.

1072
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,700
I wasn't really worried
about you.

1073
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:19,767
I mean, I was worried about you,
but I was 19 once, too.

1074
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:22,633
-I'm 21.

1075
01:09:22,667 --> 01:09:24,767
I had fun, though.

1076
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:27,400
But then it got kind of weird.

1077
01:09:27,433 --> 01:09:29,500
-Yeah, that's the thing.

1078
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:33,533
It always gets weird.

1079
01:09:34,667 --> 01:09:38,600
-It's so funny.
Pete's in love.

1080
01:09:40,133 --> 01:09:42,267
-Yeah.

1081
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:45,500
I guess he is.

1082
01:09:50,267 --> 01:09:52,533
-Well, the dresses...

1083
01:09:52,567 --> 01:09:55,300
Yeah.

1084
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:05,600
-And bestow upon him
the blessing of fruitful loins.

1085
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:13,533
This one's pretty great.

1086
01:10:13,567 --> 01:10:14,767
Right?

1087
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,733
Sophie.

1088
01:10:16,767 --> 01:10:17,767
Sophie, this is it.

1089
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:20,333
This is... this is totally
your wedding dress.

1090
01:10:20,367 --> 01:10:24,033
I mean, okay, I...
Know it's kind of short,

1091
01:10:24,067 --> 01:10:27,400
but try it on. I think that
you're really gonna like it.

1092
01:10:33,133 --> 01:10:35,467
Thanks.
- Sure.

1093
01:10:50,067 --> 01:10:52,100
Hi, guys.
- Jess.

1094
01:10:52,133 --> 01:10:54,167
Hey, come here.
- Okay.

1095
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:58,167
- Here, put on this head lamp.
- All right.

1096
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:01,100
-It's cool, right?

1097
01:11:08,133 --> 01:11:10,800
So, your guy is... cool.

1098
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:12,400
-Yeah.

1099
01:11:12,433 --> 01:11:14,200
-He taught me a lot
about eagles.

1100
01:11:14,233 --> 01:11:16,033
Really?

1101
01:11:16,067 --> 01:11:18,667
-Which was pretty cool.

1102
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:21,167
-You know we're not a...
A thing, right?

1103
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:23,767
-I mean, I don't know.

1104
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:29,567
I know you're still...
Upset about Brad.

1105
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:33,333
-I'm not upset
about Brad anymore.

1106
01:11:33,367 --> 01:11:37,367
I mean, I... I am,
but not really, you know?

1107
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:40,333
Yeah.

1108
01:11:42,533 --> 01:11:45,800
I honestly never
thought you'd get married.

1109
01:11:45,833 --> 01:11:47,600
-Really?

1110
01:11:47,633 --> 01:11:52,767
-Yeah. I mean, I never really
gave it too much thought, but...

1111
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:56,700
I guess I never
pictured it happening.

1112
01:11:56,733 --> 01:12:01,800
-I don't know. I guess I never
pictured it happening like this.

1113
01:12:01,833 --> 01:12:07,000
-It makes sense, though.
I mean, and Sophie...

1114
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:10,767
I like her.

1115
01:12:15,733 --> 01:12:20,533
Hey, I wanted to ask
if you would...

1116
01:12:21,667 --> 01:12:23,667
Be my best man.

1117
01:12:25,567 --> 01:12:29,233
-Yeah. Yeah. Um...
Yeah, of course.

1118
01:12:29,267 --> 01:12:32,100
- Yes!
- Here, um...

1119
01:12:32,133 --> 01:12:34,267
Now you have a ring.

1120
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:36,767
Actually, Jess, I...

1121
01:12:38,633 --> 01:12:41,067
-Jesus Christ.

1122
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:43,600
- Fumble it around.
- Wow.

1123
01:12:43,633 --> 01:12:46,233
- Yeah?
- Good work, petey.

1124
01:12:46,267 --> 01:12:48,467
- It's good?
- Yeah.

1125
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:51,233
Yeah.

1126
01:12:51,267 --> 01:12:53,367
Pillsbury!

1127
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:56,233
No! You are done!
- Aah!

1128
01:12:56,267 --> 01:12:58,100
You can't catch me!

1129
01:12:58,133 --> 01:12:59,567
Aah!

1130
01:13:08,267 --> 01:13:11,467
- Hi.
- Sophie.

1131
01:13:13,267 --> 01:13:14,567
Guess what.

1132
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:17,100
-What?

1133
01:13:17,133 --> 01:13:19,367
-Jess is gonna be my best man.

1134
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:21,633
Ha!

1135
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,133
Hey.

1136
01:13:45,167 --> 01:13:46,433
-Hey.

1137
01:13:46,467 --> 01:13:49,100
-Don't worry. Jess can be
your maid of honor, too.

1138
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:01,400
Are you sure that this
is really a good decision?

1139
01:14:03,133 --> 01:14:04,367
You kidding?

1140
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:08,200
This is, like,
the best decision.

1141
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:14,367
-Okay, yeah. I know it...

1142
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:17,467
Seems a little crazy.

1143
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:19,633
-Yeah.

1144
01:14:19,667 --> 01:14:24,200
-But that's what makes it
so great, you know?

1145
01:14:27,367 --> 01:14:29,167
Sophie.

1146
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:32,100
Come on. It's gonna be fun.

1147
01:14:32,133 --> 01:14:33,767
-Yeah.

1148
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:36,633
We always have
a lot of fun together.

1149
01:14:36,667 --> 01:14:38,633
-Yeah, we do.

1150
01:14:38,667 --> 01:14:41,167
-It's just...

1151
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:46,633
Do you think that we should be
doing this because it's fun?

1152
01:14:49,567 --> 01:14:51,367
I mean, do we seriously think

1153
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:54,767
that this is going to last...

1154
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:58,433
You know, forever?

1155
01:14:58,467 --> 01:15:02,200
-If we get married,
it will, yeah.

1156
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,667
Sophie, it...

1157
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:08,233
It's gonna be great.
I promise you.

1158
01:15:08,267 --> 01:15:10,467
You're gonna love it,
seriously.

1159
01:15:54,233 --> 01:15:56,667
Honk, honk.

1160
01:15:58,133 --> 01:15:59,733
And...

1161
01:15:59,767 --> 01:16:02,633
Don't worry about earlier.

1162
01:16:02,667 --> 01:16:05,700
We were both upset.

1163
01:16:06,667 --> 01:16:10,033
You just...
You need a little rest.

1164
01:16:10,067 --> 01:16:16,333
I'll even sleep in the Jeep
tonight, give you some space.

1165
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,767
-Okay.

1166
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:22,600
I'll miss you.

1167
01:16:24,533 --> 01:16:26,533
But I'll see you in the morning.

1168
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:30,567
-Yeah, see you then.

1169
01:16:31,767 --> 01:16:34,200
-All right.

1170
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:44,633
-Hey, by the way,
that dress looks "f" -ing sexy.

1171
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:48,533
-Thanks.

1172
01:16:49,833 --> 01:16:52,267
Okay. Bye.

1173
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:54,433
-Goodnight, beautiful.

1174
01:18:33,833 --> 01:18:36,133
-Now can we go?

1175
01:18:36,167 --> 01:18:38,367
-No.

1176
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,333
I'm an idiot.

1177
01:18:44,267 --> 01:18:46,367
I asked her to marry me.

1178
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:49,267
Who else would do that
but a complete idiot?

1179
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:51,733
I'd have been better off

1180
01:18:51,767 --> 01:18:55,233
just hooking up
with some dude at a bar.

1181
01:18:56,367 --> 01:18:58,733
... hey, Pete.

1182
01:19:00,767 --> 01:19:02,600
Yeah, sorry, but...

1183
01:19:02,633 --> 01:19:05,800
We're gonna...
We're actually gonna take off.

1184
01:19:05,833 --> 01:19:07,500
But, um...

1185
01:19:09,067 --> 01:19:11,667
Stay strong, my brother.

1186
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:15,533
Stay strong, Jessica.

1187
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:19,500
Come on, bleslie.

1188
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:26,533
Hey, man, 
about that check...

1189
01:19:26,567 --> 01:19:28,100
Yeah.

1190
01:19:28,133 --> 01:19:31,067
No. Forget about it.

1191
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:32,600
Seriously, it's on the house.

1192
01:19:32,633 --> 01:19:35,267
And, thanks for letting me
hang out with you guys.

1193
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:37,233
It really means a lot to me.

1194
01:19:37,267 --> 01:19:39,367
So...

1195
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,633
Yeah, man. Of course.

1196
01:19:41,667 --> 01:19:43,633
-Yeah.

1197
01:19:50,367 --> 01:19:52,167
Maybe you two should just date.

1198
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:56,400
Just kidding. Just kidding.
Okay. See you, dudes.

1199
01:20:10,767 --> 01:20:14,000
Sorry you got dumped again.

1200
01:20:15,633 --> 01:20:18,033
You can go after him
if you want.

1201
01:20:21,267 --> 01:20:22,267
I'll be fine.

1202
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:24,100
Me and Sophie, we just...

1203
01:20:24,133 --> 01:20:26,400
We weren't meant to be,
you know?

1204
01:20:26,433 --> 01:20:29,633
-God damn it.
God damn it, Pete!

1205
01:20:29,667 --> 01:20:32,567
I don't give a shit
about that guy.

1206
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:35,400
I don't think that I even gave
a shit about Brad.

1207
01:20:35,433 --> 01:20:38,267
But I do give a shit about you,
and you're not fine,

1208
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:41,333
because Sophie fucking left you!

1209
01:20:41,367 --> 01:20:44,233
-Gee, thanks, Jess.
I almost completely forgot.

1210
01:20:44,267 --> 01:20:47,500
-You've got to...
You've got to fucking try, Pete!

1211
01:20:47,533 --> 01:20:49,367
What are you doing?

1212
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,200
Jess, what are you doing?
Jess?

1213
01:20:51,233 --> 01:20:53,667
-I'm driving home. You can
stay up there if you want.

1214
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:55,300
-No, you're not.
Don't start the car.

1215
01:20:56,733 --> 01:20:58,676
Hey, turn the car off.
Do not put that car in dri...

1216
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:00,467
No! No! No!

1217
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:11,433
-You're not an idiot, Pete.

1218
01:21:11,467 --> 01:21:13,167
You're a little bitch.

1219
01:21:14,133 --> 01:21:18,533
It's completely over
unless you try to fix it.

1220
01:21:21,667 --> 01:21:23,767
-Fix what, Jess?

1221
01:21:24,733 --> 01:21:29,133
You can't just choose someone.
That's not how it works.

1222
01:21:29,167 --> 01:21:30,667
You were right.

1223
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:32,267
What? You can?

1224
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:33,800
I choose that rock.

1225
01:21:33,833 --> 01:21:36,667
I choose this car, Jess.
I'm gonna marry this car.

1226
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:39,533
We're in love. We're gonna
live happily ever after.

1227
01:21:45,633 --> 01:21:48,767
-Do you really want to
marry the car?

1228
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:53,400
-No.

1229
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,600
It actually breaks down a lot.

1230
01:21:56,633 --> 01:21:59,567
-Do you really want to
marry Sophie?

1231
01:22:15,667 --> 01:22:18,233
Get in the car.
- Right away.

1232
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:23,233
-They're...
I mean, they're okay.

1233
01:22:23,267 --> 01:22:24,633
They're workable.

1234
01:22:25,433 --> 01:22:28,100
Yeah.

1235
01:22:28,133 --> 01:22:30,633
I like what you're doing.
Keep up the good work.

1236
01:22:30,667 --> 01:22:32,767
-Hey, Terry,
can I come show you something?

1237
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:34,100
-Yeah, sure.

1238
01:22:34,133 --> 01:22:37,367
Wow! These are great!

1239
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:39,500
-Yeah, I thought
you'd like that.

1240
01:22:39,533 --> 01:22:41,000
-I do.

1241
01:22:42,533 --> 01:22:45,367
Let's get back to work.

1242
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,667
- Ooh!
- That was a great one.

1243
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:21,433
One more.

1244
01:23:21,467 --> 01:23:23,800
I love it.

1245
01:23:23,833 --> 01:23:26,333
Try a little bit more chewing.
- You sure about this?

1246
01:23:38,533 --> 01:23:40,300
Sophie.

1247
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:53,367
Don't marry me.

1248
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:59,000
If... if you don't want to,
I don't want to, either.

1249
01:24:06,733 --> 01:24:11,633
I'm sorry I just didn't
say this from the start,

1250
01:24:11,667 --> 01:24:14,200
but...

1251
01:24:14,233 --> 01:24:16,100
I-I really like you.

1252
01:24:16,133 --> 01:24:20,067
I've liked you since the minute
that I met you.

1253
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:22,733
And now what's...

1254
01:24:22,767 --> 01:24:24,800
Really weird is,

1255
01:24:24,833 --> 01:24:26,767
I think...

1256
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:29,100
I love you.

1257
01:24:29,133 --> 01:24:31,633
-Keep eating it.

1258
01:24:36,833 --> 01:24:38,600
-I just want to be around you.

1259
01:24:38,633 --> 01:24:42,167
I don't know why I thought
it was easier to...

1260
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:46,367
Propose than to just...

1261
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:09,433
Anyway, um...

1262
01:25:09,467 --> 01:25:12,633
I'm really sorry
for interrupting.

1263
01:25:12,667 --> 01:25:14,733
I'm really...

1264
01:25:14,767 --> 01:25:17,200
I'm really sorry.

1265
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:23,700
But I needed to tell you that.

1266
01:25:23,733 --> 01:25:25,700
It's okay if you don't...

1267
01:25:25,733 --> 01:25:28,100
Like me back...

1268
01:25:28,133 --> 01:25:32,233
Or love me back.

1269
01:25:32,267 --> 01:25:36,000
I just wanted you to know.

1270
01:26:07,533 --> 01:26:10,267
-Fantastic. And one more time.

1271
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:12,500
Yah, that is good.

1272
01:26:15,133 --> 01:26:16,267
-she's amazing.

1273
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:19,233
-Looks great.
She sounds German.

1274
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:53,767
-this is a test
of the broadcast stations

1275
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:56,367
of your area. Equipment
that can quickly warn you

1276
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,267
during emergencies
is being tested.

1277
01:26:58,300 --> 01:26:59,800
If this had been
an actual emergency,

1278
01:26:59,833 --> 01:27:02,333
official messages would have
followed the alert tone.
