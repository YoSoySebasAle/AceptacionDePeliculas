1
00:03:39,529 --> 00:03:41,019
Captain Blood!

2
00:03:44,334 --> 00:03:48,828
Captain Blood, there's a prize off
our larboard bow flying Spanish colors.

3
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:50,129
Come on!

4
00:03:50,206 --> 00:03:51,264
- Boatswain.
- Aye, sir.

5
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:53,708
Man the guns. Cram on more sail.

6
00:03:54,944 --> 00:03:56,412
Man the guns!

7
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:12,125
- Larboard helm.
- Larboard helm!

8
00:04:20,637 --> 00:04:22,264
Uncover the guns.

9
00:04:22,505 --> 00:04:24,132
Run out the guns!

10
00:04:27,377 --> 00:04:29,038
Put a shot across their bow.

11
00:04:29,179 --> 00:04:31,045
Number one gun,

12
00:04:31,414 --> 00:04:32,506
fire!

13
00:04:36,586 --> 00:04:37,951
Fire again.

14
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:39,580
Number two gun,

15
00:04:40,223 --> 00:04:41,315
fire!

16
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,731
You may show them our true colors,
Mr. Mannering.

17
00:04:53,803 --> 00:04:55,862
Break out the Jolly Roger.

18
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,506
Will we never hear the end
of this Captain Blood,

19
00:05:33,576 --> 00:05:36,876
this pirate who captures our treasure
and our ships?

20
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,442
You, my dear Marquis de Riconete.

21
00:05:41,184 --> 00:05:45,815
You. Why haven't you
hanged the scoundrel?

22
00:05:45,922 --> 00:05:50,484
Your Majesty, the hanging of one
pirate is hardly the answer to our problem.

23
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,894
As long as these outlaws are protected
in the West Indies by the English...

24
00:05:53,963 --> 00:05:56,022
Oh, the English, the English, the...

25
00:05:57,033 --> 00:05:59,058
Be careful, you fool.

26
00:05:59,402 --> 00:06:04,397
You see, Marquis, it isn't enough that
the ruler of Spain be bled by his physician,

27
00:06:04,607 --> 00:06:07,542
these buccaneers must bleed
our kingdom, too.

28
00:06:08,878 --> 00:06:12,678
My lord Marquis,
you're the governor of La Hacha,

29
00:06:12,749 --> 00:06:15,446
our most important island possession
in the West Indies.

30
00:06:15,518 --> 00:06:17,919
You have a galleon of 40 guns.

31
00:06:18,721 --> 00:06:23,318
Therefore, we charge you
with the personal responsibility

32
00:06:23,393 --> 00:06:25,521
of capturing this Captain Blood.

33
00:06:25,595 --> 00:06:28,087
I shall do everything in my power, sire.

34
00:06:28,164 --> 00:06:30,030
But of course Your Majesty realizes

35
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:32,898
this is no common criminal
you send me after.

36
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:35,961
Blood is a learned, intelligent man.
A doctor.

37
00:06:36,606 --> 00:06:38,574
A doctor? Are the English so healthy

38
00:06:38,641 --> 00:06:41,008
that their physicians must turn to piracy
for a living?

39
00:06:41,077 --> 00:06:44,047
Blood is not English, Your Majesty,
he's Irish.

40
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:47,572
I have prepared a dossier on the man
which I should be pleased to read.

41
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,015
Read, read.

42
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:54,787
"Peter Blood, born in Ireland, 1658.

43
00:06:54,857 --> 00:06:58,919
"Bachelor of Medicine,
Dublin University, 1680.

44
00:06:59,195 --> 00:07:02,495
"Arrested by the English
for saving the life of a wounded rebel

45
00:07:02,565 --> 00:07:03,862
"during the Monmouth Rebellion"...

46
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:06,766
Rebellion? Yes, yes, Count Harrach.

47
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:08,596
"Sentenced to death.

48
00:07:08,671 --> 00:07:12,505
"Sentence later changed
to a life of slavery at Barbados.

49
00:07:12,575 --> 00:07:15,909
"There, he and a group of fellow slaves

50
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:18,811
"managed a somewhat incredible escape."

51
00:07:18,881 --> 00:07:21,111
That's enough, Count Harrach.

52
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:26,616
Well, we offer a reward
of 50,000 pieces of eight

53
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:30,421
for the head of this buccaneer.
Even an Englishman may find that tempting.

54
00:07:30,493 --> 00:07:35,021
If not, I'm sure you, my lord Marquis, will.

55
00:07:35,898 --> 00:07:39,266
Unless this Captain Blood is captured,

56
00:07:39,335 --> 00:07:43,431
your wealth and position will be forfeit.

57
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:45,440
- Oh, but, sire, you mustn't...
- Captain Alvarado.

58
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:46,600
Sire?

59
00:07:46,676 --> 00:07:48,542
You will accompany the Marquis
to the Indies

60
00:07:48,611 --> 00:07:51,342
and will assume the post
of military position.

61
00:07:51,414 --> 00:07:54,611
- That is, I mean, of military attaché.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

62
00:07:54,684 --> 00:07:57,415
And you will act as our representative,

63
00:07:57,487 --> 00:08:00,855
and we will charge you
with the direct responsibility

64
00:08:01,391 --> 00:08:04,884
of seeing that our orders are carried out.

65
00:08:52,809 --> 00:08:54,470
No sign yet, Peter?

66
00:08:54,544 --> 00:08:58,708
No, the beach seems deserted.
What time do you make it, Tom?

67
00:08:58,948 --> 00:09:01,781
Not an hour left before dawn.
We'll have to work fast.

68
00:09:01,851 --> 00:09:02,841
Faith, yes.

69
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,717
There'll be the devil to pay
if the Marquis finds us

70
00:09:04,787 --> 00:09:07,017
lying off his island in broad daylight.

71
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:09,683
- You still think the signal will come?
- Of course.

72
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:12,785
Pacheco is a man of his word.
Besides, we can't leave.

73
00:09:12,862 --> 00:09:15,797
We must get supplies and ammunition.
There's very little left.

74
00:09:15,865 --> 00:09:19,324
- We can get what we need in Tortuga.
- No, it's too far.

75
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:24,939
Besides, I've a taste for shooting at
the Spaniards with their own cannon balls.

76
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:28,007
Peter, over there.

77
00:09:30,947 --> 00:09:32,711
One, two,

78
00:09:33,783 --> 00:09:34,875
three!

79
00:09:35,151 --> 00:09:37,245
- Lower away.
- Aye, aye, sir.

80
00:09:38,821 --> 00:09:40,255
Lively, now.

81
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,478
- You stay here, Scotty.
- Aye.

82
00:10:13,756 --> 00:10:15,383
Where is Pacheco?

83
00:11:54,056 --> 00:11:57,082
Captain Blood. Captain Blood!

84
00:12:02,365 --> 00:12:03,628
Captain.

85
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:06,692
- Captain.
- What is it, man?

86
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,104
It was a trap, Captain.

87
00:12:10,973 --> 00:12:12,600
We were ambushed.

88
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:18,079
Pacheco wasn't there.
All the other men were taken prisoner.

89
00:12:18,547 --> 00:12:20,447
If it's fighting they want,
we'll give them a taste of it.

90
00:12:20,516 --> 00:12:23,349
But we've little enough powder and ball left
as it is.

91
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:24,545
No matter. Our men are there.

92
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,385
But the Marquis' ship's within sound
of our guns.

93
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:30,448
It's suicide.
For us, and those men ashore, too.

94
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,255
Sure, you're right, Tom.

95
00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:36,629
- Let's try to get to Tortuga for supplies.
- Aye.

96
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,794
You men, take Scotty below.

97
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:44,102
Weigh anchor, make sail.

98
00:12:45,775 --> 00:12:47,903
Look lively, now.

99
00:12:53,516 --> 00:12:55,109
Your Excellency.

100
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:07,289
So, my new slaves
are Captain Blood's men, eh?

101
00:13:07,763 --> 00:13:11,256
I've been anxious to meet your captain
for a long time.

102
00:13:12,635 --> 00:13:14,603
Where was he headed for?

103
00:13:15,171 --> 00:13:16,263
Well?

104
00:13:29,085 --> 00:13:31,520
Where was your captain bound for?

105
00:13:32,822 --> 00:13:33,983
Where?

106
00:13:40,396 --> 00:13:41,557
Where?

107
00:13:59,982 --> 00:14:04,249
Perhaps you'll be more talkative
after a short while in the pearl fisheries.

108
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,845
Take them away.

109
00:14:14,797 --> 00:14:16,822
Well, Excellency?

110
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:20,631
Didn't I make you a good price
for such interesting slaves?

111
00:14:25,307 --> 00:14:29,642
Señor Fairfax, your greediness
for the sale of a few slaves

112
00:14:29,712 --> 00:14:33,148
has cost me a chance to capture
your countryman. Captain Blood.

113
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:36,879
But, Your Excellency, I didn't know
it was the Avenger in time to warn you.

114
00:14:36,952 --> 00:14:39,978
By now, Blood is 20 leagues away.
In a fast ship,

115
00:14:40,055 --> 00:14:44,117
-impossible to capture.
- You will have other chances.

116
00:14:44,193 --> 00:14:45,854
Not like this one.

117
00:15:10,386 --> 00:15:11,854
Platt.

118
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:15,614
Hokenby.

119
00:15:18,494 --> 00:15:20,792
Peter, why don't we go ashore?

120
00:15:20,863 --> 00:15:22,262
I'm staying aboard.

121
00:15:22,331 --> 00:15:24,766
But, Peter, there's nothing we can do
to help those men now.

122
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,700
- Why must you keep thinking about it?
- What would you have me do, then?

123
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:29,534
Try and forget them.

124
00:15:30,005 --> 00:15:31,666
Forget our own men?

125
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,404
Slaves of Spain,
rotting away in the Marquis' dungeons?

126
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:38,208
Do you remember what it was like
before we escaped from slavery?

127
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,874
The stench of those filthy holes? The swill?

128
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:43,475
The chains rotting away
the flesh from your bones?

129
00:15:43,552 --> 00:15:46,852
- The whips, and the branding irons?
- Yes, I remember.

130
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,987
Don't ask me to forget, then.

131
00:15:51,727 --> 00:15:53,923
Captain Blood!

132
00:15:55,531 --> 00:15:57,522
- Captain Blood.
- Scotty, if you're in trouble

133
00:15:57,599 --> 00:16:01,001
-with the father of another señorita...
- It's not me that's in trouble this time,

134
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,697
it's the Marquis.

135
00:16:03,472 --> 00:16:07,136
- What are you talking about?
- A French ship just arrived from La Hacha.

136
00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:10,076
Her mate tells me that
that hurricane that's been blowing about

137
00:16:10,145 --> 00:16:13,240
hit the Marquis' ship
and just about ruined her.

138
00:16:13,482 --> 00:16:15,507
<i>- The Santa Paula?
- Aye.</i>

139
00:16:15,584 --> 00:16:19,418
She's no fit to go to sea again
until she's been repaired.

140
00:16:19,488 --> 00:16:20,478
Hear that, Tom?

141
00:16:20,556 --> 00:16:23,150
We could sail right to the island
and the Marquis couldn't give us a chase.

142
00:16:23,225 --> 00:16:26,991
But he's still got a fort,
and 50 cannon mounted on the beach.

143
00:16:27,062 --> 00:16:29,053
There's no cannon in the cove
at the back of the island.

144
00:16:29,131 --> 00:16:30,929
- All the men aboard?
- Aye, sir.

145
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:34,663
But, Peter, you can't take the Avenger
right into the Marquis' grasp.

146
00:16:34,736 --> 00:16:36,761
- We'd surely be caught.
- You're right, Tom,

147
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:39,308
we wouldn't stand a chance. Weigh anchor!

148
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:41,706
This is the most foolhardy thing
you've ever done.

149
00:16:41,777 --> 00:16:44,803
Beyond a doubt. Stand by to make sail!

150
00:16:44,913 --> 00:16:48,816
- We'll end up slaves ourselves.
- He'll probably hang all of us.

151
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,121
Set our course for La Hacha, Mr. Mannering.

152
00:16:54,289 --> 00:16:55,814
Aye, aye, sir.

153
00:16:56,158 --> 00:16:57,592
Hands aloft!

154
00:16:58,894 --> 00:17:02,831
Take out the topsail!

155
00:17:21,884 --> 00:17:25,081
I'm still dead set against it, Peter.
It's too dangerous.

156
00:17:25,154 --> 00:17:27,714
This cove's right
on the Marquis' back doorstep.

157
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:29,382
Where would he be less likely
to look for us?

158
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:32,860
And what if somebody recognizes you?
What if Pacheco see you?

159
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:34,896
He's betrayed us once already.

160
00:17:34,963 --> 00:17:37,955
Pacheco won't betray anybody else.
I'll make sure of that while I'm here.

161
00:17:38,033 --> 00:17:39,967
Well, how do you propose
to get into the town?

162
00:17:40,035 --> 00:17:43,528
You can't just walk in and have yourself
announced to the Marquis.

163
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,664
I'll leave that to Lady Chance.

164
00:17:45,741 --> 00:17:48,608
She's obliged me more than once,
perhaps she'll oblige me again.

165
00:17:48,677 --> 00:17:51,169
- I've great faith in the Lady.
- You'll need it.

166
00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:56,917
Whoa! Señores, fruit, fresh fruit.

167
00:17:56,985 --> 00:17:59,249
Would you take your pick
before I go to La Hacha?

168
00:17:59,321 --> 00:18:02,484
No, no, move on, move on.

169
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:03,855
Wait!

170
00:18:08,163 --> 00:18:10,894
- Where did you say you were going?
- To La Hacha, across the island.

171
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:12,559
Where else?

172
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:14,261
- There he is, Tom.
- Who?

173
00:18:14,436 --> 00:18:15,699
Our messenger from Lady Chance.

174
00:18:15,771 --> 00:18:18,832
- Will you buy some of my fruit, señor?
- I may buy all of it.

175
00:18:18,907 --> 00:18:21,342
<i>Thank you. Muchas gracias, señor.</i>

176
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:13,527
Pacheco! Pacheco, open up.

177
00:19:23,905 --> 00:19:25,134
Pacheco.

178
00:20:55,831 --> 00:20:58,857
Miguel, Miguel.
Querido mio, I have been looking for you.

179
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:03,996
Oh, Miguel, you kiss me so good...
You are not Miguel. Who are you?

180
00:21:04,072 --> 00:21:06,769
Señorita, it's a little late for introductions.

181
00:21:06,842 --> 00:21:09,971
Why are you wearing Miguel's clothes?
And what are you peddling his fruit for?

182
00:21:10,045 --> 00:21:12,480
- Well, Miguel is sick.
- Sick?

183
00:21:12,547 --> 00:21:17,041
Si. He asked me to take his place.
I'm his friend.

184
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:19,418
His friend?

185
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:24,225
- What is your name, señor?
- Pedro. Pedro Morales.

186
00:21:24,626 --> 00:21:26,025
Pedro?

187
00:21:26,094 --> 00:21:29,724
That is strange.
He has never mentioned you to me.

188
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:32,693
Well, he has never mentioned you
to me, either.

189
00:21:32,768 --> 00:21:35,567
But that is not so strange.

190
00:21:35,971 --> 00:21:38,303
What do you mean, señor?
Something is wrong?

191
00:21:38,373 --> 00:21:40,774
Oh, no, no, no. Nothing, nothing.

192
00:21:41,743 --> 00:21:45,077
I can see why Miguel never told me
about you, señorita...

193
00:21:45,147 --> 00:21:46,171
<i>Señorita...</i>

194
00:21:46,248 --> 00:21:48,080
- Pepita.
- Pepita.

195
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,778
- Pepita Maria Rosados.
- Pepita Maria Rosados.

196
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,789
The woman is even more lovely
than the name.

197
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:57,188
Miguel knew I would be helpless
before such beauty.

198
00:21:57,259 --> 00:21:59,591
That's why he kept you a secret from me.

199
00:21:59,661 --> 00:22:01,720
The señor is very kind.

200
00:22:01,797 --> 00:22:05,791
- But it is true that Miguel is very fond of me.
- Oh, Pepita! Fond of you?

201
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:08,666
It is only because I'm his closest friend
that he is so helpless that...

202
00:22:08,737 --> 00:22:10,466
- Helpless?
- Si, completely.

203
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:13,600
It is only because of that
that he trusts me alone in the city with you.

204
00:22:13,675 --> 00:22:16,975
But I am only human,
and you must help me to resist.

205
00:22:17,846 --> 00:22:20,907
Don't worry about that, señor.
I will help you.

206
00:22:22,284 --> 00:22:25,447
But remember, I'm only human, too.

207
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:38,696
- Pepita?
- Si, señor?

208
00:22:38,767 --> 00:22:43,603
I was seeking early today an old friend
of mine, but his shop was deserted.

209
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:45,840
Perhaps you know him.

210
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:49,904
I know all the men in La Hacha.
What is your friend's name?

211
00:22:49,978 --> 00:22:51,742
Pacheco. Fernando Pacheco.

212
00:22:51,813 --> 00:22:54,407
Oh, yes, yes, I remember him.
He is the thin one.

213
00:22:54,483 --> 00:22:57,214
- But he left the island yesterday.
- Left?

214
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:01,353
Oh, no. I'm sure you're mistaken.
I'm certain he is still here.

215
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:03,551
I was told he had gone to Portobelo.

216
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:06,219
Oh? Who told you this?

217
00:23:06,294 --> 00:23:08,695
The overseer, Carmilio.

218
00:23:09,731 --> 00:23:12,666
But, señor, why worry about old friends,

219
00:23:13,368 --> 00:23:16,861
when it is so easy to find new ones
in La Hacha?

220
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:26,147
What is that?

221
00:23:26,915 --> 00:23:28,610
Oh, just the slaves.

222
00:23:28,683 --> 00:23:31,380
They're on their way back
from the Marquis' pearl fisheries.

223
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:32,852
The ones that are left.

224
00:23:32,921 --> 00:23:35,618
- The ones that are left?
- There are fewer every day.

225
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:39,285
Last week, 34. Yesterday, 32.

226
00:23:39,361 --> 00:23:41,762
- Today, who knows?
- What happens to them?

227
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:46,290
What happens to anyone who has to dive
for pearls in water filled with sharks?

228
00:23:46,368 --> 00:23:50,635
Oh, please excuse me.
I forgot. The overseer's wine.

229
00:23:50,705 --> 00:23:51,695
<i>Papá!</i>

230
00:23:53,241 --> 00:23:54,766
<i>Papá? Wake up, Papá.</i>

231
00:23:56,177 --> 00:23:58,009
The señor overseer is here.

232
00:24:00,348 --> 00:24:02,043
Must I run this inn all by myself?

233
00:24:03,752 --> 00:24:05,413
Get moving!

234
00:24:12,961 --> 00:24:14,087
Halt!

235
00:24:19,467 --> 00:24:20,559
Sit down!

236
00:24:24,406 --> 00:24:28,570
My beautiful Pepita.
Have you no welcome for your friend today?

237
00:24:28,643 --> 00:24:31,408
- Pablo is bringing it.
- Pablo?

238
00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:32,947
Pablo.

239
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:51,389
Now I feel better, my beautiful Pepita.

240
00:24:51,466 --> 00:24:52,865
Don't touch!

241
00:24:53,668 --> 00:24:54,794
Don't touch?

242
00:24:56,371 --> 00:24:59,705
Women. Women, they're all the same.

243
00:24:59,774 --> 00:25:01,037
If the señor would care
for a little more wine,

244
00:25:01,109 --> 00:25:02,702
I should be most happy
to buy it for him, huh?

245
00:25:02,777 --> 00:25:07,476
Another time. I must take
those slaves back to the dungeons.

246
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:10,075
This is the day for the Marquis' inspection.

247
00:25:10,852 --> 00:25:13,947
Get moving! On your feet!

248
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:18,924
Come on! Get moving!

249
00:25:21,529 --> 00:25:24,794
- Señor.
- Pepita. I must go.

250
00:25:24,866 --> 00:25:26,265
This is for the wine, huh?

251
00:25:26,334 --> 00:25:29,235
Oh, no, señor. Not from a friend of Miguel's.

252
00:25:29,304 --> 00:25:31,739
Thank you, señorita. I'll be back.

253
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:33,438
Si. I know.

254
00:25:52,527 --> 00:25:55,929
Get along! Get along! Hurry up!

255
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:02,331
Come on.

256
00:26:23,525 --> 00:26:27,052
Why don't you wait in the carriage,
lsabelita? I'll only be a few moments.

257
00:26:27,128 --> 00:26:30,063
Please don't be too long, Uncle.
The sun is very hot.

258
00:26:30,131 --> 00:26:33,226
<i>I should be most happy to escort
the señorita back to the residencia.</i>

259
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:36,236
You don't seem too anxious
to inspect the dungeons, Captain.

260
00:26:36,304 --> 00:26:39,501
Well, I hardly find them attractive,
Excellency.

261
00:26:39,574 --> 00:26:43,033
I'm afraid the Captain still judges us
by Spanish standards, lsabelita.

262
00:26:43,111 --> 00:26:46,206
He forgets we are in a new world,
where men live by new laws.

263
00:26:46,281 --> 00:26:48,306
Or die by them.

264
00:26:48,383 --> 00:26:51,785
Come now, Captain,
these slaves dive for pearls.

265
00:26:51,853 --> 00:26:55,687
And pearls are one of the few things
that make this dull little colony bearable.

266
00:26:55,757 --> 00:26:58,852
Your Excellency,
everything is ready for the inspection.

267
00:26:58,927 --> 00:27:01,760
Splendid, splendid. And the day's catch?

268
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:05,664
Three pearls, Excellency.
Two of fine quality.

269
00:27:06,334 --> 00:27:07,324
Uncle,

270
00:27:07,402 --> 00:27:10,372
don't you think I deserve some reward
for waiting in this heat?

271
00:27:10,438 --> 00:27:12,406
Of course, my dear.

272
00:27:15,276 --> 00:27:18,211
A small pearl like this for a Marquis' niece?

273
00:27:18,713 --> 00:27:20,772
It's fit only for a...

274
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:23,811
For a peddler.

275
00:27:23,885 --> 00:27:25,614
Excuse me, my dear.

276
00:27:38,666 --> 00:27:40,293
How clumsy of you, peddler.

277
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:44,134
Forgive my hands, señorita.
They are not accustomed to pearls.

278
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:47,903
Perhaps you would appreciate them more
if you were to dive for one yourself.

279
00:27:47,976 --> 00:27:49,239
Perhaps.

280
00:28:14,169 --> 00:28:15,398
Darling.

281
00:28:21,342 --> 00:28:23,538
I thought I'd never get away
from your uncle.

282
00:28:23,611 --> 00:28:26,080
Don't tell me business bores you.

283
00:28:26,147 --> 00:28:27,945
By contrast? Yes.

284
00:28:29,951 --> 00:28:33,114
Look, I'm over half finished.
How do you like it?

285
00:28:33,788 --> 00:28:35,984
It's very charming, my sweet.

286
00:28:38,126 --> 00:28:41,494
Oh, George,
why don't you take me away from here?

287
00:28:41,563 --> 00:28:44,328
Back to Spain, to the court
and the life I was meant for?

288
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,391
You know I will, lsabelita, as soon as I can.

289
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:53,369
I'm sick to death of my life here.
Sewing and embroidering,

290
00:28:53,441 --> 00:28:57,105
supervising the kitchen maids,
waiting on my uncle.

291
00:28:57,178 --> 00:28:59,806
And those dull, dull official parties.

292
00:29:01,983 --> 00:29:04,418
"Ah, sf, Señora Second Assistant Clerk,

293
00:29:04,485 --> 00:29:07,819
"your new gown is quite, quite ravishing."

294
00:29:08,556 --> 00:29:11,753
It's only three years behind the fashion.

295
00:29:11,826 --> 00:29:14,158
"Oh, and Señor Plantation Foreman,

296
00:29:14,229 --> 00:29:18,427
"your little Ramon is so, so unspoiled."

297
00:29:19,534 --> 00:29:23,732
He thinks nothing of wiping his filthy hands
all over the draperies.

298
00:29:26,341 --> 00:29:29,834
Oh, George, don't let's wait any longer.

299
00:29:29,911 --> 00:29:32,972
Oh, but, darling,
even if we could get off the island,

300
00:29:33,047 --> 00:29:34,378
it would take gold.

301
00:29:34,449 --> 00:29:37,419
But I have my jewels.
The pearls alone are worth a fortune.

302
00:29:37,485 --> 00:29:39,579
But I can't take your money.

303
00:29:39,654 --> 00:29:43,181
Don't you see that it means my happiness?
Our happiness?

304
00:29:43,725 --> 00:29:46,786
You must take them, querido.

305
00:29:47,262 --> 00:29:49,390
That's what you really want?

306
00:29:49,564 --> 00:29:52,693
Oh, yes, it is.
More than anything in the world.

307
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:59,265
lsabelita.

308
00:30:02,043 --> 00:30:03,636
Go to your room.

309
00:30:04,245 --> 00:30:06,373
- But, Uncle, I...
-lsabelita!

310
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:18,454
You...

311
00:30:18,927 --> 00:30:21,589
You must understand, Your Excellency. I...

312
00:30:21,663 --> 00:30:25,099
It is bad enough that I should
have business dealings with vermin.

313
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:27,794
I don't wish them to infest my family.

314
00:30:31,739 --> 00:30:35,039
Señor Fairfax,
if you attempt to see my niece again,

315
00:30:35,843 --> 00:30:37,811
I shall have the distinct pleasure
of watching you

316
00:30:37,879 --> 00:30:39,870
being torn apart by the sharks.

317
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,997
Pepita.

318
00:31:00,335 --> 00:31:04,829
Please, Carmilio, suéltame, be careful.
You will make me break the wine bottles.

319
00:31:05,306 --> 00:31:08,037
Sol must be careful
the bottles must not be broken, huh?

320
00:31:08,109 --> 00:31:09,133
<i>Si.</i>

321
00:31:09,277 --> 00:31:12,804
But you. You break men's hearts.

322
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,871
My heart, Pepita.

323
00:31:14,949 --> 00:31:17,611
Oh, Carmilio.

324
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:25,554
Pepita.

325
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:27,793
You hold this, Carmilio.

326
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:31,196
- Señor Morales.
- Good evening, Pepita.

327
00:31:31,265 --> 00:31:34,792
Welcome to Venta de Rosados.
Whatever you wish is yours.

328
00:31:34,869 --> 00:31:37,463
Would you not like a table
in the other room?

329
00:31:37,538 --> 00:31:40,599
It is much cooler and much more private.

330
00:31:40,675 --> 00:31:44,202
A little later perhaps, señorita.
First, I must talk with a friend.

331
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:46,271
<i>Señor.</i>

332
00:31:46,514 --> 00:31:49,449
Now will you allow me the honor
of buying you a glass of wine?

333
00:31:49,517 --> 00:31:51,246
- Well...
- Pepita,

334
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:53,253
bring us some of your father's best sherry.

335
00:31:53,321 --> 00:31:54,982
- Si, señor.
- Pepita.

336
00:31:56,858 --> 00:31:58,087
<i>Gracias.</i>

337
00:32:00,628 --> 00:32:02,892
Delightful girl, this one.

338
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:04,932
To some people, perhaps.

339
00:32:05,767 --> 00:32:08,793
Surely, my dear Carmilio,
a man of your intelligence

340
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:13,671
is not taken in by this little trick of Pepita's.
You must see what she's trying to do?

341
00:32:14,976 --> 00:32:16,637
- Trying to do?
- Si.

342
00:32:17,011 --> 00:32:21,608
She's using me, as she would any stranger,
to make you jealous.

343
00:32:22,417 --> 00:32:24,442
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

344
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,719
You know, Carmilio, you're quite a catch.

345
00:32:29,424 --> 00:32:30,516
I am?

346
00:32:31,392 --> 00:32:32,917
Well, certainly.

347
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:34,359
You have

348
00:32:34,629 --> 00:32:35,619
authority,

349
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:37,487
position,

350
00:32:40,234 --> 00:32:41,724
strength.

351
00:32:44,505 --> 00:32:46,132
Your wine, señor.

352
00:32:56,517 --> 00:33:01,284
Authority, position, and strength.

353
00:33:05,593 --> 00:33:10,429
And such charming manners.
My friend, what woman could resist you?

354
00:33:11,065 --> 00:33:15,502
Morales, you're right. It's impossible.

355
00:33:16,437 --> 00:33:18,872
She should fall at my feet.

356
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:19,930
I agree with you.

357
00:33:20,274 --> 00:33:21,935
Now, it's getting late, and don't forget

358
00:33:22,009 --> 00:33:24,740
we are going to have our last drink
at your place.

359
00:33:24,812 --> 00:33:26,678
- We are?
- You promised.

360
00:33:30,685 --> 00:33:35,623
I tell you, Pedro,
the slaves, they are nothing but trouble.

361
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:40,593
They are lazy, they get sick, they die.

362
00:33:41,095 --> 00:33:42,824
They try to escape.

363
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:47,424
How do they get away?

364
00:33:47,502 --> 00:33:50,767
They don't. Not from this prison.

365
00:33:51,639 --> 00:33:54,700
You should see the dungeons
deep underground.

366
00:33:55,042 --> 00:33:58,171
Seems very interesting.
I should like to see them.

367
00:33:58,246 --> 00:34:00,840
Without a pass with the Marquis' seal,

368
00:34:00,915 --> 00:34:04,408
not even the King of Spain
could come though that door.

369
00:34:05,453 --> 00:34:09,686
Without the seal of the Marquis,
not even the King of Spain, huh?

370
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:13,489
If it's bad like you say,
heaven knows why he should want to.

371
00:34:16,297 --> 00:34:19,790
Carmilio. Huh? Well, it's almost midnight.

372
00:34:19,867 --> 00:34:22,199
If you don't want me to see the jails,
I think I'll take my leave.

373
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:25,535
Why don't you have another drink?
Oh, excuse me.

374
00:34:29,777 --> 00:34:31,176
What's this?

375
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:34,271
It's nothing. It's just a keepsake.

376
00:34:34,348 --> 00:34:36,146
- Let me see it.
- It's nothing, I tell you.

377
00:34:36,217 --> 00:34:38,015
I say, let me see it.

378
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,285
Where'd you get that?

379
00:34:44,358 --> 00:34:48,454
It was given to me today by a friend.
His name was Fernando Pacheco.

380
00:34:48,529 --> 00:34:50,657
- But...
- But Pacheco is dead, huh?

381
00:34:50,731 --> 00:34:53,632
I know.
You might say he bequeathed it to me.

382
00:34:53,701 --> 00:34:56,466
It was in his hand when I found him.

383
00:34:56,537 --> 00:34:58,437
I don't know this Pacheco.

384
00:34:58,506 --> 00:35:03,171
I made a mistake about this medallion.
It looks like something else.

385
00:35:03,644 --> 00:35:04,907
Does it?

386
00:35:15,189 --> 00:35:17,715
Thanks for your hospitality.

387
00:35:26,734 --> 00:35:27,826
Juan!

388
00:35:29,303 --> 00:35:32,466
- Juan!
- Si, señor?

389
00:35:34,141 --> 00:35:38,408
- Find Señor Fairfax. Bring him here. Hurry!
- Si, señor.

390
00:35:50,992 --> 00:35:52,517
But a man like you...

391
00:35:52,593 --> 00:35:56,223
A man like you does not come to La Hacha
only to sell fruit.

392
00:35:56,297 --> 00:35:58,425
Why you don't tell Pepita your real reason
for being here?

393
00:35:58,499 --> 00:36:00,092
I have told you.

394
00:36:00,434 --> 00:36:02,926
Lies, lies, nothing but lies.

395
00:36:03,971 --> 00:36:05,632
If you were really a fruit peddler,

396
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:08,801
people would not be
asking questions about you.

397
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,805
About me?

398
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:16,445
Who has been asking about me, Pepita?

399
00:36:16,517 --> 00:36:20,385
You don't answer my questions, señor.
Why should I answer yours?

400
00:36:20,454 --> 00:36:23,014
Well, you are my friend, little one.

401
00:36:24,025 --> 00:36:27,359
You must trust me, have faith.

402
00:36:27,762 --> 00:36:31,221
<i>Let go, señor, or I'll awaken Papá.</i>

403
00:36:31,532 --> 00:36:33,967
Please, señor. Stop it, señor.

404
00:36:34,568 --> 00:36:35,558
<i>Papá.</i>

405
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:38,501
<i>Oh, Papá.</i>

406
00:36:39,273 --> 00:36:40,638
Oh, señor.

407
00:36:42,977 --> 00:36:45,708
Oh, señor.

408
00:36:47,882 --> 00:36:51,375
- Stop it.
- It is too late to stop, señorita.

409
00:36:51,452 --> 00:36:53,614
From the first moment we met,
it was too late.

410
00:36:53,688 --> 00:36:58,125
- You are lying to me again, I know.
- Does this seem like a lie, señorita?

411
00:36:59,927 --> 00:37:02,589
Lie to me some more, señor.

412
00:37:03,731 --> 00:37:06,029
First you must tell me
who was asking questions.

413
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:09,627
It was only the overseer.
But let us not talk about him now. Let us...

414
00:37:09,704 --> 00:37:13,140
What did the overseer want, Pepita?

415
00:37:13,207 --> 00:37:16,837
Just to know who you are
and what you are doing in La Hacha.

416
00:37:16,911 --> 00:37:18,777
- Was that all?
- Si.

417
00:37:18,846 --> 00:37:21,543
Now, I have told you my secrets,
you must tell me yours.

418
00:37:21,615 --> 00:37:24,243
Of course. But not tonight, it is too late.

419
00:37:24,318 --> 00:37:26,548
- If you do not trust me, señor...
- Oh, I trust you, Pepita.

420
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:29,681
But as I told you before,
I do not trust myself.

421
00:37:29,757 --> 00:37:31,816
- Pedro, you're not going to go?
- Si.

422
00:37:31,892 --> 00:37:34,657
- But I thought...
- Adiós, little one.

423
00:38:38,192 --> 00:38:40,593
Have you lost something, señores?

424
00:38:41,929 --> 00:38:46,196
- No, señor, we have found what we lost.
- That is good.

425
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,526
Whoever your master is,

426
00:38:47,601 --> 00:38:49,592
he could have taught you to be
a little more polite.

427
00:39:20,367 --> 00:39:23,667
Nothing like a long nap
after a strenuous exercise.

428
00:39:23,737 --> 00:39:28,265
But it was quite unnecessary
for your associates

429
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:31,136
to go to so much trouble to bring me here.

430
00:39:31,212 --> 00:39:35,274
After all, I am just as anxious to make
your acquaintance as you are to make mine,

431
00:39:35,349 --> 00:39:37,340
<i>Señor... Señor...</i>

432
00:39:37,418 --> 00:39:39,443
My name is George Fairfax.

433
00:39:40,454 --> 00:39:43,446
In my line of work, one can't be too careful.

434
00:39:43,691 --> 00:39:47,127
And what exactly is
your line of work, señor?

435
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:52,461
What are you doing in La Hacha,
Señor Morales?

436
00:39:53,033 --> 00:39:56,594
I sell fruit.
Persimmons, mangoes, pomegranates...

437
00:39:57,805 --> 00:40:00,240
And is that all you have for sale?

438
00:40:01,575 --> 00:40:02,940
Everything.

439
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,050
I'm afraid we can't do business after all.

440
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:13,110
- Then if the señor will excuse me, I will...
- Sit down, Morales.

441
00:40:13,354 --> 00:40:15,823
You are a stranger in La Hacha, my friend,

442
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:19,724
and perhaps you're not aware
that the laws here are very strict.

443
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:23,354
For instance,
the penalty for robbery is death.

444
00:40:24,732 --> 00:40:28,396
For example, suppose you were
to have stolen something of mine.

445
00:40:28,469 --> 00:40:32,736
A ring, say, or a timepiece, or a medallion.

446
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:36,640
And were you to be caught with it
in your possession,

447
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,701
I could have you hanged.

448
00:40:38,812 --> 00:40:42,544
It's a very harsh law,
but sometimes a useful one.

449
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:46,843
And what is the penalty for murder
in La Hacha?

450
00:40:46,921 --> 00:40:49,618
Well, that depends on whether or not
the murderer is caught.

451
00:40:51,325 --> 00:40:55,387
For example, there was a regrettable death
of a local shopkeeper,

452
00:40:55,462 --> 00:40:58,227
a ship's chandler, just yesterday.

453
00:40:58,799 --> 00:41:01,666
Poor fellow, he became too talkative,

454
00:41:01,735 --> 00:41:05,296
and yet there have been
almost no questions about his death,

455
00:41:06,006 --> 00:41:08,600
and I do not think there will be any.

456
00:41:09,777 --> 00:41:13,907
Incidentally, if I should
shoot a robber in my quarters,

457
00:41:14,281 --> 00:41:15,544
and he happened to be armed,

458
00:41:15,616 --> 00:41:18,881
there'd be even less trouble
with the authorities.

459
00:41:18,953 --> 00:41:20,682
But how would I be expected to know

460
00:41:20,754 --> 00:41:24,156
that he was holding an unloaded pistol?

461
00:41:29,663 --> 00:41:32,325
This one, however, is loaded.

462
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:46,476
- Who is it?
- It's me, lsabelita. Let me in.

463
00:41:50,551 --> 00:41:51,643
lsabelita, what are you doing here?

464
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:53,881
George, we must leave
La Hacha now, tonight.

465
00:41:53,954 --> 00:41:55,945
<i>- We can't.
- The Santa Paula is ready to sail.</i>

466
00:41:56,023 --> 00:41:58,082
She wasn't as badly damaged
as they thought

467
00:41:58,158 --> 00:42:00,650
and the Marquis
doesn't trust his niece alone in the city.

468
00:42:00,728 --> 00:42:02,526
Tomorrow morning
I'm being sent to a convent.

469
00:42:02,596 --> 00:42:05,327
I'm sorry, lsabelita,
but I don't see how we can possibly...

470
00:42:05,399 --> 00:42:07,163
But we must. We must.

471
00:42:07,234 --> 00:42:10,670
Look, these will buy us a boat
and whatever else we need.

472
00:42:10,738 --> 00:42:12,638
Please, George, please.

473
00:42:13,841 --> 00:42:16,538
All right. All right, we'll leave.

474
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,356
The guards followed you here.

475
00:42:50,277 --> 00:42:55,181
Señor Fairfax, our orders are to return
the señorita to the residencia,

476
00:42:55,249 --> 00:42:56,546
and to place you under arrest.

477
00:42:56,617 --> 00:42:58,881
- And my sword?
- Si, señor.

478
00:42:59,687 --> 00:43:01,314
Very well.

479
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:05,652
Come and take it.

480
00:43:21,809 --> 00:43:22,935
I'll be all right.

481
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:25,707
- George.
- It's not too bad.

482
00:43:25,779 --> 00:43:27,611
Sit down, sit down.

483
00:43:27,681 --> 00:43:29,615
There are three more guards
coming up the stairs.

484
00:44:21,769 --> 00:44:23,601
Now go, and go fast.

485
00:44:36,116 --> 00:44:38,448
- He's badly hurt.
- We must get out of here,

486
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:40,385
before those four guards are replaced by 40.

487
00:44:40,454 --> 00:44:43,651
I know a place near the quay
where we'll be safe.

488
00:45:07,416 --> 00:45:09,441
You are very lucky, señor.

489
00:45:09,952 --> 00:45:12,444
If the lead had hit you six inches
nearer to your right,

490
00:45:12,521 --> 00:45:15,821
you'd have been lying
in a different kind of bed.

491
00:45:15,891 --> 00:45:18,986
As it is, you'll be well enough
to fight another duel tomorrow.

492
00:45:19,061 --> 00:45:20,426
Open up!

493
00:45:21,497 --> 00:45:23,124
Ope" up, I say!

494
00:45:24,633 --> 00:45:27,034
Open, in the name of the Marquis.

495
00:45:27,469 --> 00:45:29,437
It's the guard.

496
00:45:29,905 --> 00:45:32,636
- I know that.
- I've got to let them in, or they'll break in.

497
00:45:32,708 --> 00:45:35,234
I'm aware of that, too, Señor Bragg.

498
00:45:43,886 --> 00:45:45,479
Ope" up, I say!

499
00:45:45,554 --> 00:45:49,388
Just a minute, just a minute. I'm coming!

500
00:45:55,697 --> 00:45:57,028
All right.

501
00:45:59,134 --> 00:46:01,364
- Open, I say.
- I'm coming.

502
00:46:05,274 --> 00:46:08,904
What may I do for you, gentlemen?
Me tavern's closed for the night.

503
00:46:08,977 --> 00:46:11,241
We do not want your rotten liquor,
innkeeper.

504
00:46:11,313 --> 00:46:14,544
We're hunting for the Marquis' niece,
and two men who attacked our guards.

505
00:46:14,616 --> 00:46:17,449
The Marquis' niece? In Billy Bragg's place?

506
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:19,683
That's a rich one.

507
00:46:19,755 --> 00:46:22,816
We're searching everywhere.
The Marquis' orders.

508
00:46:24,026 --> 00:46:26,017
- Please...
- Upstairs, go.

509
00:46:26,094 --> 00:46:29,724
Gentlemen, please walk quietly.
Customers are asleep.

510
00:46:29,831 --> 00:46:33,426
Oh, no. No, Lieutenant, not in there, please.

511
00:46:33,602 --> 00:46:35,798
Stand to one side, innkeeper.

512
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:44,177
What do you mean,
bursting into my private room,

513
00:46:44,246 --> 00:46:48,376
waking up my husband?
Get out. Get out, you filthy pig!

514
00:46:48,483 --> 00:46:51,043
Get out, you pig- Pig!

515
00:46:52,955 --> 00:46:55,322
Any more rooms
you'd like to see, Lieutenant?

516
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:56,983
Oh, no. No, no, no.

517
00:46:57,059 --> 00:46:59,027
No fine ladies at Billy Bragg's, you know.

518
00:46:59,094 --> 00:47:01,358
This being a soldier is a risky business,
ain't it?

519
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:03,455
Si, you speak the truth. Come along, men.

520
00:47:03,532 --> 00:47:04,829
<i>- Come along.
- Buenas noches.</i>

521
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:06,868
Same to you, sir.

522
00:47:16,178 --> 00:47:17,577
All clear, Mr. Fairfax.

523
00:47:17,646 --> 00:47:21,583
Señor Bragg, the world lost an honest actor
when you turned rogue.

524
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:24,711
- You're a man of many talents.
- That I am, sir.

525
00:47:25,387 --> 00:47:28,084
This is a night for genius, Señor Morales.

526
00:47:28,156 --> 00:47:29,783
An innkeeper turned actor

527
00:47:29,858 --> 00:47:33,658
and a fruit peddler
who is both doctor and fencing master.

528
00:47:34,129 --> 00:47:37,292
You seem to forget, Señor Fairfax,
that you owe me your life.

529
00:47:37,366 --> 00:47:39,858
A debt I may later wish to collect.

530
00:47:39,935 --> 00:47:41,528
At your service.

531
00:47:41,803 --> 00:47:43,032
George!

532
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:46,701
Señor Morales, we're deeply grateful to you.

533
00:47:46,775 --> 00:47:50,609
- Both of us.
- Yes. How can we ever repay you?

534
00:47:50,879 --> 00:47:51,903
Well, l...

535
00:47:52,247 --> 00:47:53,737
What did you do with my jewels?

536
00:47:54,283 --> 00:47:56,684
I? Do with them? I never had them.

537
00:47:57,919 --> 00:48:00,354
I must have left them on the quay.

538
00:48:00,522 --> 00:48:03,890
I remember now,
I put them down when you were wounded.

539
00:48:03,959 --> 00:48:06,519
- It doesn't matter.
- Doesn't matter?

540
00:48:06,595 --> 00:48:11,362
You spill jewels worth 30,000 doubloons
in the dirt and say it doesn't matter?

541
00:48:13,001 --> 00:48:15,698
Yes, George, you're right.

542
00:48:16,638 --> 00:48:18,402
My jewels do matter.

543
00:48:19,675 --> 00:48:21,700
They matter a great deal.

544
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:25,102
You see, querido,
I wanted to go to Spain with you.

545
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:27,808
But without my jewels,
we'd be paupers, wouldn't we?

546
00:48:27,883 --> 00:48:31,717
- And that would be frightful, wouldn't it?
-lsabelita, stop it. I didn't mean...

547
00:48:31,787 --> 00:48:34,017
I know exactly what you meant.

548
00:48:35,657 --> 00:48:38,991
- But, lsabelita...
- You should rest, señor.

549
00:48:39,728 --> 00:48:43,096
- Perhaps you would like a glass of wine?
- No, no.

550
00:48:43,732 --> 00:48:46,258
Pardon me if I get one for myself.

551
00:48:49,771 --> 00:48:51,899
Bragg, stay with the señor.

552
00:48:52,307 --> 00:48:55,504
- Perhaps he might need something.
- Aye, aye, sir.

553
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,287
Is this, by any chance,
what you were missing, señorita?

554
00:49:07,356 --> 00:49:09,654
I found it on the quay.

555
00:49:10,959 --> 00:49:12,484
<i>Gracias, señor.</i>

556
00:49:12,994 --> 00:49:17,488
Now everything is all right, huh?
You and Señor Fairfax can elope.

557
00:49:18,767 --> 00:49:21,134
You deliberately hid my jewels.

558
00:49:21,203 --> 00:49:24,070
- You wanted me to quarrel with George.
- Of course I did.

559
00:49:24,139 --> 00:49:25,231
Why?

560
00:49:27,209 --> 00:49:29,007
Are you in love with him?

561
00:49:29,077 --> 00:49:32,206
I... I don't know. I'm not sure.

562
00:49:33,348 --> 00:49:37,182
I suppose I thought he'd take me away
from this horrible place.

563
00:49:37,252 --> 00:49:41,416
It's unfortunate you picked the wrong man.
I could've told you that.

564
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:45,685
You?
What would a fruit peddler know about?

565
00:49:46,795 --> 00:49:48,593
Or are you a peddler, señor?

566
00:49:48,964 --> 00:49:51,331
You no longer talk like one. Who are you?

567
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,232
At the moment,
I find it convenient to be a peddler.

568
00:49:53,301 --> 00:49:57,033
My uncle would have ways
of discovering your true identity.

569
00:49:57,339 --> 00:49:59,808
I don't doubt it for a minute.

570
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:04,779
But if he were to take up my time,
how could I be of service to you?

571
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,408
- Service?
- Yes.

572
00:50:08,216 --> 00:50:10,207
I've had business dealings with Mr. Fairfax,

573
00:50:10,285 --> 00:50:12,344
and I began to suspect his true nature.

574
00:50:12,421 --> 00:50:14,685
So I left my ship in the cove
on the other side of the island

575
00:50:14,756 --> 00:50:19,421
and came here in disguise to...
To, shall we say, investigate.

576
00:50:20,095 --> 00:50:22,257
And what has all this got to do with me?

577
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:24,560
Well, you're anxious to leave La Hacha,
and I have a boat, so...

578
00:50:24,633 --> 00:50:28,866
You could take me away from the island.
To Maracaibo.

579
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:30,629
Or Port of Spain!

580
00:50:30,906 --> 00:50:32,135
Why not?

581
00:50:32,908 --> 00:50:36,845
Oh, señor,
how can I ever thank you enough?

582
00:50:37,245 --> 00:50:41,273
Well, you might try
throwing me another pearl.

583
00:50:44,085 --> 00:50:46,315
I suppose I do deserve that.

584
00:50:47,155 --> 00:50:50,090
You'll not let this one slip
through your fingers?

585
00:50:50,158 --> 00:50:51,717
Have no fear.

586
00:50:51,793 --> 00:50:55,161
I didn't know you then,
or I'd have been more careful.

587
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:57,562
You're gallant, whoever you are.

588
00:50:57,666 --> 00:50:59,498
In my fashion.

589
00:50:59,568 --> 00:51:02,230
Now I'll send you back to the residencia.

590
00:51:02,304 --> 00:51:04,033
As it is, if we were to set foot
on the waterfront,

591
00:51:04,105 --> 00:51:05,903
the guards would send you back
to the Marquis

592
00:51:05,974 --> 00:51:10,172
and me to the pearl fisheries.
You must go back to your uncle at once.

593
00:51:10,245 --> 00:51:13,545
What can I say to him?
He'll send me to the convent.

594
00:51:13,682 --> 00:51:17,016
Not if you were to tell him that
you've discovered Mr. Fairfax's true colors,

595
00:51:17,085 --> 00:51:20,885
and beg him to forgive you
and pardon the poor fruit peddler.

596
00:51:21,256 --> 00:51:23,588
Yes. Yes, of course.

597
00:51:23,658 --> 00:51:27,356
I'll come to the residencia tomorrow
for the pardon, and if it's safe, we can go.

598
00:51:27,429 --> 00:51:30,797
Very well, I trust you.

599
00:51:30,866 --> 00:51:34,564
I know nothing about you,
and yet I do trust you.

600
00:51:35,871 --> 00:51:38,033
Perhaps because you have no choice.

601
00:51:38,106 --> 00:51:41,201
Oh, I don't know. You are different.

602
00:51:41,276 --> 00:51:44,769
You save a man's life or take it, like that.

603
00:51:45,747 --> 00:51:47,943
Perhaps I'm not so different.

604
00:51:48,016 --> 00:51:50,917
You said yourself
you know nothing about me.

605
00:51:51,253 --> 00:51:53,347
How much do I need to know?

606
00:51:56,525 --> 00:51:59,722
Doctor? Swordsman?

607
00:52:02,364 --> 00:52:03,729
I got it!

608
00:52:04,666 --> 00:52:06,600
Port Royal. Tortuga.

609
00:52:06,668 --> 00:52:08,966
That's who he is. Captain Blood.

610
00:52:09,237 --> 00:52:10,534
- Blood?
- Aye.

611
00:52:10,605 --> 00:52:13,597
Billy Bragg's still got his two eyes,
hasn't he?

612
00:52:13,675 --> 00:52:17,634
How come you're traveling with him,
Mr. Fairfax, and don't know?

613
00:52:17,712 --> 00:52:20,909
A reward of 50,000 pieces of eight.

614
00:52:22,083 --> 00:52:24,609
Billy Bragg,
we've turned some good deals in our time,

615
00:52:24,686 --> 00:52:27,986
but this is the biggest one of all.
Get to the Marquis as fast as you can.

616
00:52:30,425 --> 00:52:34,726
Bragg, I have something for you to do.
You will take the señorita to the residencia.

617
00:52:34,796 --> 00:52:37,629
- But I can't leave, sir. I...
- Go along, Billy.

618
00:52:37,699 --> 00:52:40,430
Go to the residencia. I'll be all right.

619
00:52:40,502 --> 00:52:43,096
You'll stay here with me, won't you,
Señor Morales?

620
00:52:43,171 --> 00:52:45,469
You may be sure of that, señor.

621
00:53:06,728 --> 00:53:09,163
- Señor Bragg, huh?
- Aye.

622
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:12,029
- The señorita, she is safe at home?
- Aye, sir.

623
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:16,162
But I've got something more important
to tell you, Captain Blood.

624
00:53:16,738 --> 00:53:19,799
I met you in Tortuga, Captain.
The Red Lion Tavern.

625
00:53:19,874 --> 00:53:21,603
- You remember Billy Bragg?
- Bragg?

626
00:53:21,676 --> 00:53:26,136
Aye. I know I've put on a bit of weight,
but you remember Billy Bragg?

627
00:53:26,214 --> 00:53:27,909
Oh, yes.

628
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:30,618
Billy Bragg-

629
00:53:30,685 --> 00:53:33,848
I finally stole enough money
to get a place of me own.

630
00:53:33,922 --> 00:53:36,186
Well, if you're charging
for these accommodations,

631
00:53:36,257 --> 00:53:37,782
you're still engaged in piracy.

632
00:53:37,859 --> 00:53:41,853
Leastwise, Captain, I'm too much
of a buccaneer to ever turn informer.

633
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:43,489
I've not accused you of it.

634
00:53:43,565 --> 00:53:46,500
Aye, but your friend Mr. Fairfax
put me up to it.

635
00:53:46,568 --> 00:53:51,267
That's why he wanted me to go with the girl,
so I'd turn you in, and we'd split the reward.

636
00:53:51,339 --> 00:53:53,467
That adds another count against him.

637
00:53:53,541 --> 00:53:55,373
- Another?
- Yes.

638
00:53:56,344 --> 00:53:59,575
He murdered a man who used to supply us.

639
00:53:59,648 --> 00:54:02,345
And sold six of my crew into slavery.

640
00:54:02,417 --> 00:54:05,682
Would you like me
to dispose of this Fairfax, Captain?

641
00:54:05,754 --> 00:54:08,780
Not yet. I may have use for him.

642
00:54:08,857 --> 00:54:11,121
The Avenger is on the far side of the island.

643
00:54:11,192 --> 00:54:14,127
I may be back for friend Fairfax
before we sail.

644
00:54:14,195 --> 00:54:15,685
He'll be here.

645
00:54:16,364 --> 00:54:18,526
Now I must surrender myself to the Marquis.

646
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:21,035
- What?
- Oh, not as Peter Blood,

647
00:54:21,102 --> 00:54:23,867
but as a fruit peddler
who served the Marquis' niece

648
00:54:23,938 --> 00:54:26,737
and who earned her confidence.

649
00:54:26,808 --> 00:54:29,038
Why take such a risk, Captain?

650
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:33,747
Billy, if I'm to get my men out of prison,
I must first get myself into the residencia.

651
00:54:34,916 --> 00:54:37,408
- Pedro Morales.
- Morales.

652
00:54:40,989 --> 00:54:43,583
- Excellency.
- So,

653
00:54:44,359 --> 00:54:48,296
my niece tells me
that you've proved an invaluable friend.

654
00:54:48,363 --> 00:54:52,061
- The señorita is most generous, Excellency.
- Perhaps.

655
00:54:52,133 --> 00:54:53,794
And yet I can't help wondering

656
00:54:53,868 --> 00:54:55,700
if she might not have been returned
to the residencia

657
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:58,068
without your invaluable assistance,

658
00:54:58,139 --> 00:55:00,801
and without costing me the lives
of my guards.

659
00:55:00,875 --> 00:55:03,674
I apologize for my enthusiasm, Excellency.

660
00:55:03,745 --> 00:55:06,976
However, you have been of some assistance.

661
00:55:09,417 --> 00:55:11,852
<i>- You are free to go.
- Gracias, Excellency.</i>

662
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:16,824
And, Morales,
in the future, try to curb your enthusiasms.

663
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:19,722
At another time,
you may not find me so lenient.

664
00:55:19,794 --> 00:55:21,523
- Excellency.
- If Your Excellency

665
00:55:21,596 --> 00:55:24,657
will seal the order
for the prisoner's release?

666
00:55:34,542 --> 00:55:36,237
This is the wrong seal.

667
00:55:36,311 --> 00:55:40,179
- The square one is the order for release.
- Pardon, Excellency.

668
00:57:36,097 --> 00:57:39,032
Are you a murderer as well as a thief, señor?

669
00:57:39,334 --> 00:57:41,063
It's hardly murder.

670
00:57:42,804 --> 00:57:45,501
I was watching you from the corridor.

671
00:57:46,541 --> 00:57:48,805
- What did you steal from the courtroom?
- Well, I...

672
00:57:48,877 --> 00:57:51,812
I took a pass, to help us escape.

673
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:55,282
"Us"? I'm not as stupid as that.

674
00:57:55,383 --> 00:57:58,512
- You were planning to leave without me.
- Well, this is hardly the place to explain.

675
00:57:58,586 --> 00:58:00,884
- Come with me and I'll...
- I'm not going anywhere.

676
00:58:00,955 --> 00:58:04,482
And neither are you.
There are guards to prevent that.

677
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:06,459
<i>Señorita, wait.</i>

678
00:58:06,527 --> 00:58:09,019
You're right,
I wasn't going to take you with me.

679
00:58:09,097 --> 00:58:12,761
I told you I was,
so I'd have a chance to steal this pass.

680
00:58:13,668 --> 00:58:15,432
You must believe me.

681
00:58:15,503 --> 00:58:18,529
I only came here to help some friends
escape from La Hacha.

682
00:58:18,606 --> 00:58:22,907
I've listened to enough of your stories.
You can tell this one to my uncle.

683
00:58:22,977 --> 00:58:26,140
- He may be more interested than I.
- Wait, please.

684
00:58:27,148 --> 00:58:31,278
lsabelita, you want to leave this island.
Then think of my friends in the dungeons.

685
00:58:31,352 --> 00:58:34,117
Compare your reasons for escape
with those of men living in slavery.

686
00:58:34,188 --> 00:58:36,748
You came here to help criminals escape?

687
00:58:36,824 --> 00:58:38,383
They're not criminals.

688
00:58:38,459 --> 00:58:42,020
They're men who were trapped
and sold into slavery by your friend Fairfax.

689
00:58:42,096 --> 00:58:44,565
I know what it's like to be an innocent man
and live as a prisoner.

690
00:58:44,632 --> 00:58:46,726
I was a slave once myself.

691
00:58:47,602 --> 00:58:49,627
And there was no reason for that?

692
00:58:49,704 --> 00:58:52,833
No reason except as a doctor,
I treated a dying patient.

693
00:58:52,907 --> 00:58:55,103
For that I was sentenced to a life of slavery.

694
00:58:55,176 --> 00:58:57,770
I felt the whips and knew the weights
of those chains, and asked no favors.

695
00:58:57,845 --> 00:59:00,542
- You're asking one now.
- Not for myself.

696
00:59:00,615 --> 00:59:04,176
You may have many reasons for hating me.
I don't blame you.

697
00:59:04,252 --> 00:59:07,085
But you can't hate the men I want to help.

698
00:59:08,189 --> 00:59:11,181
Did you really think
I'd be moved by all this?

699
00:59:14,562 --> 00:59:15,586
Yes, I did.

700
00:59:22,570 --> 00:59:24,231
lsabelita.

701
00:59:25,573 --> 00:59:27,371
Why are you out here?

702
00:59:28,376 --> 00:59:32,813
It was stifling inside. I wanted some air.

703
00:59:33,181 --> 00:59:36,708
You'd better go to your room.
You might catch a chill.

704
00:59:36,784 --> 00:59:38,980
Yes, all right. I'll come in.

705
00:59:57,905 --> 01:00:02,206
So, you're going to go away?
You're going to leave La Hacha?

706
01:00:02,276 --> 01:00:04,506
Perhaps I am, perhaps I may never leave.

707
01:00:04,578 --> 01:00:07,309
That is true. You may never leave,
if you do not let me help you.

708
01:00:07,381 --> 01:00:09,008
What do you mean?

709
01:00:09,116 --> 01:00:12,950
Carmilio, the overseer,
has told me he would like to kill you.

710
01:00:14,789 --> 01:00:16,621
Carmilio, huh?

711
01:00:19,293 --> 01:00:21,523
Possibly I do need your help, Pepita.

712
01:00:21,595 --> 01:00:24,587
Si, perhaps I need your help very much.

713
01:00:24,999 --> 01:00:27,024
We will be partners, huh? You and I.

714
01:00:27,101 --> 01:00:30,401
Oh, no, no, señor. I will not be a fool again.

715
01:00:30,471 --> 01:00:33,304
- I will make you rich.
- No, I tell you I won't...

716
01:00:33,974 --> 01:00:35,601
- How rich?
- Here.

717
01:00:40,648 --> 01:00:44,016
The rest is for you. For one little favor.

718
01:00:44,085 --> 01:00:46,645
There is something I want you to do for me.

719
01:00:46,721 --> 01:00:50,624
Of course.
From now on, we live only for each other.

720
01:00:51,459 --> 01:00:54,485
- Now, your friend Carmilio...
- Oh, Carmilio. I forgot about Carmilio.

721
01:00:54,562 --> 01:00:57,224
Pepita, tonight I don't want you
to forget about him.

722
01:00:57,298 --> 01:01:00,825
So I won't forget about him, partner.

723
01:01:06,941 --> 01:01:09,376
- You know, Carmilio?
- What?

724
01:01:09,443 --> 01:01:13,175
I think you have the most beautiful hair
in all of La Hacha.

725
01:01:13,714 --> 01:01:15,773
- You do?
- Si, I do.

726
01:01:15,883 --> 01:01:18,784
- You love me?
- Oh, sf, very much, Carmilio.

727
01:01:22,123 --> 01:01:25,787
If you love me,
why you always making fun of me?

728
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:30,127
Oh, my silly little blockhead.
How else would Pepita fool them?

729
01:01:30,197 --> 01:01:35,135
If Papá knew how much I loved you,
he would lock me in the cellar, nights.

730
01:01:36,137 --> 01:01:38,731
I would much rather be here with you.

731
01:01:38,806 --> 01:01:43,403
- Don't you like that, Carmilio?
- Yes, very much.

732
01:01:46,781 --> 01:01:50,149
- But it's against the regulations.
- Regulations!

733
01:01:50,217 --> 01:01:52,652
What do we care about regulations?

734
01:01:57,558 --> 01:02:00,459
Official business. Orders from the Marquis.

735
01:02:11,472 --> 01:02:12,940
Oh, Carmilio.

736
01:02:16,410 --> 01:02:18,105
Well, my little one,

737
01:02:18,179 --> 01:02:20,705
I leave you now to inspect the guards.

738
01:02:20,781 --> 01:02:23,478
- But I coming back.
- Oh, Carmilio,

739
01:02:23,551 --> 01:02:26,953
there is no hurry, is there?

740
01:02:27,021 --> 01:02:29,513
Oh, no. There is no hurry.

741
01:02:38,532 --> 01:02:39,931
Lieutenant.

742
01:02:42,303 --> 01:02:46,171
The Lieutenant has an order
for the release of the six pirates.

743
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:50,234
- Take him to the lower dungeon.
- This way, Lieutenant.

744
01:03:09,363 --> 01:03:11,957
Guard, seize the lieutenant
who just came in!

745
01:03:12,032 --> 01:03:13,591
Bring him back!

746
01:03:22,509 --> 01:03:24,136
Wake up. Wake up.

747
01:03:24,979 --> 01:03:28,074
You've taken our freedom and our food.
You want to take our sleep now?

748
01:03:28,148 --> 01:03:29,616
Silence.

749
01:03:29,683 --> 01:03:33,017
You're being transferred into the interior,
at once.

750
01:03:36,523 --> 01:03:38,184
Hold that officer!

751
01:04:28,976 --> 01:04:31,968
- Pick up the keys.
- Señor Carmilio.

752
01:04:32,046 --> 01:04:34,811
- Señor Carmilio!
- What do you want?

753
01:04:34,882 --> 01:04:36,111
A man has come from the Marquis

754
01:04:36,183 --> 01:04:38,447
with a purchase order
for the release of six slaves.

755
01:04:38,519 --> 01:04:41,887
Why do you bother me with it? Go away!

756
01:04:41,956 --> 01:04:44,755
But, señor,
it is stamped with the wrong seal.

757
01:05:24,264 --> 01:05:25,732
Get back.

758
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:28,327
You all,

759
01:05:29,069 --> 01:05:30,332
get back.

760
01:05:32,339 --> 01:05:34,205
One more step and I'll...

761
01:05:35,476 --> 01:05:37,604
Take that step, Captain.

762
01:05:57,431 --> 01:05:59,798
Jensen.

763
01:05:59,867 --> 01:06:01,494
Jensen.

764
01:06:12,713 --> 01:06:14,772
Captain.

765
01:06:16,316 --> 01:06:17,784
Captain, I...

766
01:06:41,308 --> 01:06:44,608
Hardy, you come with me.
The rest of you, stay here.

767
01:08:10,430 --> 01:08:12,023
Get in the cart.

768
01:08:35,822 --> 01:08:38,848
You four men, go this way.
The rest, follow me.

769
01:08:51,271 --> 01:08:53,239
Pedro, where are the slaves?

770
01:08:53,307 --> 01:08:55,241
I'll tell you later, Pepita.
Now, please go away.

771
01:08:55,309 --> 01:08:57,141
We'll go together, partner.

772
01:08:57,277 --> 01:08:58,438
You there, wait.

773
01:08:58,512 --> 01:09:00,947
- I told you to go away.
- Don't worry, I fix, I fix.

774
01:09:01,014 --> 01:09:05,042
- Listen, fruit peddler, did...
- Lieutenant, this is my friend.

775
01:09:05,652 --> 01:09:08,747
Don't you remember me? Pepita?

776
01:09:09,289 --> 01:09:14,250
Pepita Maria Rosados?
The night of the fiesta, in the garden?

777
01:09:15,262 --> 01:09:18,232
- Oh, Pepita.
- Si.

778
01:09:18,532 --> 01:09:21,297
Yes. Yes, I remember.

779
01:09:22,069 --> 01:09:25,039
We are searching for some escaped slaves.

780
01:09:25,105 --> 01:09:29,975
I had to meet Pedro, but I was a little late,
so we know nothing about escaped slaves.

781
01:09:30,043 --> 01:09:32,705
- My apologies.
- That's all right, Lieutenant.

782
01:09:32,779 --> 01:09:35,407
Oh, Lieutenant,
would you care for some fruit?

783
01:09:35,482 --> 01:09:37,507
No, thanks. I have no time.

784
01:09:37,584 --> 01:09:39,382
- A melon perhaps?
- Some other time.

785
01:09:39,453 --> 01:09:41,512
The melons are very good.

786
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:50,527
Pedro, how many times must I tell you?
No, no, no, no, no!

787
01:09:57,871 --> 01:09:59,930
Go away, Pepita, you'll get me into trouble.

788
01:10:00,007 --> 01:10:03,204
Oh, no,
Pepita will get you out of trouble, partner.

789
01:10:11,518 --> 01:10:15,682
So, my guards have begun
to smoke the rats out of their holes.

790
01:10:17,257 --> 01:10:20,249
- They're to be hanged, Captain Alvarado.
- Yes, Excellency.

791
01:10:20,327 --> 01:10:22,591
One moment, Your Excellency.
I should like a sporting chance.

792
01:10:22,663 --> 01:10:25,325
- I have no time to waste, señor.
- The stakes are good.

793
01:10:25,399 --> 01:10:28,858
My neck, against an opportunity
to capture Peter Blood.

794
01:10:29,469 --> 01:10:31,938
If you find the fruit peddler
who released the slaves,

795
01:10:32,005 --> 01:10:34,406
you'll have no reason to set sail tomorrow

796
01:10:34,474 --> 01:10:36,636
because he is Captain Blood.

797
01:10:36,977 --> 01:10:38,638
Why should I believe you?

798
01:10:38,712 --> 01:10:41,977
The only slaves who were freed
were men from his ship, the Avenger.

799
01:10:44,985 --> 01:10:47,750
Very well, Fairfax, you win.

800
01:10:48,355 --> 01:10:50,517
You may keep your neck.

801
01:10:50,590 --> 01:10:53,059
Provided, of course,
you can tell me where Blood is now.

802
01:10:53,126 --> 01:10:57,563
I'm afraid I can't tell you,
but I'm sure there's someone here who can.

803
01:11:02,903 --> 01:11:05,429
You have only to say where Blood is.

804
01:11:10,544 --> 01:11:12,171
Stop it.

805
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:15,739
You're wasting your time, Uncle.

806
01:11:15,816 --> 01:11:18,444
If you want to know where Blood is,
release him, and I'll tell you.

807
01:11:18,518 --> 01:11:19,986
- You?
- Yes.

808
01:11:20,053 --> 01:11:22,613
Well! Please forgive the oversight.

809
01:11:23,223 --> 01:11:26,090
His ship was anchored in the cove
on the other side of the island.

810
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:29,356
- Are you sure?
- He told me himself.

811
01:11:29,429 --> 01:11:31,830
<i>Find Captain Valdez.
The Santa Paula will sail at once.</i>

812
01:11:31,898 --> 01:11:35,129
- Yes, Excellency.
- It's already too late, Uncle.

813
01:11:35,202 --> 01:11:37,830
By now, Blood's ship will be far out to sea.

814
01:11:37,904 --> 01:11:40,737
One moment, Excellency,
Blood can hardly change the tides.

815
01:11:40,807 --> 01:11:43,902
If his ship was in the cove, it is still there,
waiting to get over the shallows.

816
01:11:43,977 --> 01:11:46,969
And it will be three hours
before the tide will permit him to sail.

817
01:11:47,047 --> 01:11:50,210
Señor Fairfax,
apparently you are still of value.

818
01:11:50,283 --> 01:11:54,948
We will reach the cove in two hours.
Get a guard. Have him taken to the prison.

819
01:11:55,021 --> 01:11:59,822
lsabelita, whether you intended it or not,
you, too, have been of service.

820
01:12:03,964 --> 01:12:07,832
Oh, thank you, milady,
but you shouldn't have told him.

821
01:12:07,901 --> 01:12:10,063
I told him where Blood was
because I wanted them to catch him.

822
01:12:10,137 --> 01:12:12,868
Because you thought the Captain
had already sailed.

823
01:12:12,939 --> 01:12:15,465
You're in love with him, aren't you?

824
01:12:16,543 --> 01:12:19,308
In love with a pirate?

825
01:12:19,913 --> 01:12:24,373
- A cutthroat, a liar and a cheat?
- You're wrong, milady, you're wrong.

826
01:12:24,451 --> 01:12:26,886
He may not have told you all about himself,

827
01:12:26,953 --> 01:12:30,048
but what he told you was true,
every word of it.

828
01:12:33,393 --> 01:12:35,487
Let's hurry, Billy Bragg.

829
01:12:44,571 --> 01:12:46,300
Side guard!

830
01:12:47,641 --> 01:12:49,040
Captain Valdez, weigh anchor.

831
01:12:49,142 --> 01:12:50,940
- Get under way immediately.
- Your Excellency.

832
01:12:51,311 --> 01:12:54,474
Hands, stand by to make sail!

833
01:12:54,548 --> 01:12:56,175
Fo'c'sle at topsails!

834
01:12:57,618 --> 01:12:59,347
Helm midships!

835
01:13:12,532 --> 01:13:14,694
<i>Look, the Santa Paula!</i>

836
01:13:29,650 --> 01:13:32,483
Wait a minute, me lads.
Let's give Jonesy a drink.

837
01:13:32,552 --> 01:13:36,011
- Aye, he looks like he needs one.
- Warm your insides up.

838
01:13:36,823 --> 01:13:38,757
They're warm enough.

839
01:13:45,899 --> 01:13:49,699
Miguel, this should be enough
to pay for the use of your cart.

840
01:13:51,538 --> 01:13:54,997
<i>Anytime I can be of service,
Señor Capitan Blood.</i>

841
01:13:55,308 --> 01:13:59,074
<i>Capitan?
Capitan Blood, I've got a surprise for you.</i>

842
01:13:59,146 --> 01:14:01,615
- Look.
- What is it?

843
01:14:01,682 --> 01:14:04,014
Curtains. They're for our cabin.

844
01:14:06,119 --> 01:14:07,644
Don't you like them?

845
01:14:07,988 --> 01:14:11,686
- Yes, very much.
- I am so glad, Pedro.

846
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:16,790
Miguel, the use of your cart
was worth more than gold.

847
01:14:16,863 --> 01:14:19,730
Much more. Here's your final payment.

848
01:14:33,380 --> 01:14:34,472
You lied to me!

849
01:14:34,548 --> 01:14:37,210
Pepita, here's the rest
of what I promised you.

850
01:14:37,284 --> 01:14:40,083
With regrets, I dissolve our partnership.

851
01:14:45,092 --> 01:14:49,654
Oh, Miguel, if you only knew how much
I worried about you.

852
01:14:55,235 --> 01:14:57,260
Ship ahoy!

853
01:14:58,805 --> 01:15:00,705
Captain Blood!

854
01:15:08,048 --> 01:15:09,982
Another woman?

855
01:15:10,050 --> 01:15:13,076
How did you ever find time
to save anybody?

856
01:15:13,153 --> 01:15:14,951
Carter, bring them back with you.

857
01:15:15,021 --> 01:15:17,080
Aye, aye, sir. Pull away.

858
01:15:28,301 --> 01:15:29,700
Peter, I'm frightened.

859
01:15:29,770 --> 01:15:32,398
Now don't be, lsabelita.
Lady Chance is still with us.

860
01:15:32,472 --> 01:15:33,906
<i>The Santa Paula's not in sight here.</i>

861
01:15:33,974 --> 01:15:35,669
A few minutes more,
and we head for open sea.

862
01:15:35,742 --> 01:15:37,972
- How's the tide?
- Up about a foot.

863
01:15:38,044 --> 01:15:42,277
Up about a foot.
We may scrape the barnacles off going over.

864
01:15:42,349 --> 01:15:46,081
<i>That's better than letting the Santa Paula
blow us to our graves.</i>

865
01:15:46,153 --> 01:15:49,316
We'll make a run for it.
You have to go ashore now.

866
01:15:49,389 --> 01:15:52,222
Peter, I don't want to go ashore.

867
01:15:52,292 --> 01:15:54,351
You must.

868
01:16:04,938 --> 01:16:06,497
<i>The Santa Paula!</i>

869
01:16:11,111 --> 01:16:12,909
What now, Peter?

870
01:16:12,979 --> 01:16:14,913
- Shall we man the guns?
- It's no use, Tom.

871
01:16:14,981 --> 01:16:17,075
The Santa Paula has 40 cannon to our 12.

872
01:16:17,150 --> 01:16:18,948
There's only one chance left for us.

873
01:16:37,838 --> 01:16:41,502
As soon as Scotty and Ward finish their job
and join us,

874
01:16:41,575 --> 01:16:43,134
we'll go into action.

875
01:17:05,131 --> 01:17:09,932
Blood's position is hopeless.
Captain Valdez, attack at once.

876
01:17:10,003 --> 01:17:12,700
Larboard guns, prepare to fire.

877
01:17:23,516 --> 01:17:25,780
- They're in firing position now.
- Aye.

878
01:17:27,287 --> 01:17:30,587
Number one gun, fire!

879
01:17:32,626 --> 01:17:34,958
Number three gun, fire!

880
01:17:46,907 --> 01:17:49,672
Number five gun, fire!

881
01:18:02,155 --> 01:18:04,317
Larboard broadside, fire!

882
01:18:41,728 --> 01:18:44,698
Scotty, you're the best
gun spiker in Scotland.

883
01:18:44,764 --> 01:18:49,361
In the whole world.
Just let them try to fire this one.

884
01:18:53,473 --> 01:18:56,033
We'll give them another one for luck.

885
01:19:01,748 --> 01:19:03,443
Now for the flag.

886
01:19:35,315 --> 01:19:37,443
Lower the boats.

887
01:19:37,517 --> 01:19:40,111
I will accept the surrender
of Captain Blood personally.

888
01:19:40,186 --> 01:19:41,984
Yes, Your Excellency.

889
01:20:05,678 --> 01:20:09,581
While the Marquis and his men are busy
accepting my surrender aboard the Avenger,

890
01:20:09,649 --> 01:20:12,744
we'll swim out to his ship
and surprise what's left of his crew.

891
01:20:12,819 --> 01:20:13,877
Aye.

892
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:55,484
Aboard the Avenger!

893
01:20:56,596 --> 01:20:58,086
Captain Blood!

894
01:20:59,766 --> 01:21:01,996
I've come for your surrender!

895
01:21:04,304 --> 01:21:05,897
Grappling hooks.

896
01:21:27,660 --> 01:21:30,789
Your Excellency, the ship's deserted.
Not a soul aboard.

897
01:22:15,275 --> 01:22:16,401
<i>They're boarding the Santa Paula.</i>

898
01:22:16,476 --> 01:22:18,968
What are you waiting for? Fire on them.

899
01:22:19,045 --> 01:22:21,013
- But, Your Excellency...
- Quickly, you idiot.

900
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:24,573
Yes, Your Excellency.
Form gun crews! Prepare for action!

901
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:31,953
Throw these swine overboard.
No! No! No!

902
01:22:43,469 --> 01:22:46,302
They've spiked this cannon,
Your Excellency.

903
01:22:47,173 --> 01:22:49,301
And this one,

904
01:22:50,310 --> 01:22:51,869
and this one.

905
01:22:52,512 --> 01:22:55,914
- Here's one they missed.
- You have your orders. Fire!

906
01:23:00,587 --> 01:23:03,750
Up anchor! Make sail!

907
01:23:04,224 --> 01:23:08,684
Get under way!
Quartermaster, helm hard to larboard!

908
01:23:18,371 --> 01:23:21,671
It's another kind of surgery
I'll be performing tonight, Mr. Fairfax.

909
01:23:21,741 --> 01:23:24,506
Look to your own wounds, Dr. Peter Blood.

910
01:23:24,611 --> 01:23:25,806
I will.

911
01:24:22,302 --> 01:24:24,862
To the sharks, Fairfax,
and join the slaves you sent to them.

912
01:24:39,352 --> 01:24:42,219
That's enough. They're done for.

913
01:24:42,755 --> 01:24:46,623
Surrender now, Captain,
and save those of your men who remain.

914
01:24:49,262 --> 01:24:51,162
You leave me no choice.

915
01:24:56,636 --> 01:24:58,900
Keep her close to the wind!

916
01:25:01,808 --> 01:25:03,970
Helm steady!

917
01:25:05,478 --> 01:25:07,003
We'll ram them.

918
01:25:12,118 --> 01:25:13,244
Captain Blood!

919
01:25:22,895 --> 01:25:24,761
Tom! Tom!

920
01:25:26,399 --> 01:25:27,833
They're trying to ram us.

921
01:25:31,437 --> 01:25:35,670
The Avenger served us well, Tom.
I'll not sink her, just stop her.

922
01:25:37,210 --> 01:25:39,508
Put a shot through her sails.

923
01:25:39,579 --> 01:25:43,413
Number two gun, ready.
Put a shot through her sails.

924
01:25:44,350 --> 01:25:45,340
Fire!

925
01:25:52,024 --> 01:25:54,015
Cram on more sails!

926
01:25:59,465 --> 01:26:02,298
Hit her in the rigging. That'll stop her.

927
01:26:03,136 --> 01:26:06,071
Number three gun, ready.

928
01:26:06,139 --> 01:26:07,937
Aim at her rigging.

929
01:26:08,541 --> 01:26:09,633
Fire!

930
01:26:18,117 --> 01:26:20,381
Steady as she goes!

931
01:26:25,391 --> 01:26:26,483
Fire!

932
01:26:55,354 --> 01:26:58,255
Help! Help!

933
01:27:00,393 --> 01:27:01,417
Help.

934
01:27:04,230 --> 01:27:05,959
She'll ram us.

935
01:27:06,032 --> 01:27:08,694
Hit her amidships,
aim for the powder magazine.

936
01:27:08,768 --> 01:27:10,600
Give her to broadside as she closes.

937
01:27:11,003 --> 01:27:13,028
Larboard broadside, ready.

938
01:27:14,006 --> 01:27:15,132
Fire!

939
01:28:43,829 --> 01:28:46,730
We've lost our ship and taken yours,
and we intend to keep her.

940
01:28:46,799 --> 01:28:49,825
We're freebooters and privateers
with no land of our own.

941
01:28:49,902 --> 01:28:52,564
But we fight for something
more precious than land.

942
01:28:52,638 --> 01:28:54,003
Freedom.

943
01:28:54,774 --> 01:28:57,266
- And what of our freedom, Captain?
- Captain Alvarado,

944
01:28:57,343 --> 01:28:59,505
I'll exchange your lives
for the lives of the slaves

945
01:28:59,579 --> 01:29:03,277
-that are still in the dungeons.
- Gladly. You have my word.

946
01:29:04,617 --> 01:29:06,745
And the señorita has promised,
with the influence of her family,

947
01:29:06,819 --> 01:29:08,810
to help me bring a new government
to La Hacha.

948
01:29:08,888 --> 01:29:10,322
<i>The señorita?</i>

949
01:29:12,425 --> 01:29:14,757
I thought you told me
you were going to Spain.

950
01:29:14,827 --> 01:29:17,296
No, señor, I did not tell you that.

951
01:29:17,363 --> 01:29:20,458
- Only yesterday you said that...
- Yesterday.

952
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:24,459
Yesterday,
a Marquis' niece met a fruit peddler.

953
01:29:24,537 --> 01:29:27,734
Today, that fruit peddler no longer exists.

954
01:29:27,807 --> 01:29:29,707
And neither does that selfish girl.

955
01:29:29,775 --> 01:29:31,402
But why do you want to stay here?

956
01:29:33,346 --> 01:29:36,281
Because I've learned
that this is where I belong.

957
01:29:36,349 --> 01:29:38,283
This is where I'm needed.

958
01:29:38,351 --> 01:29:41,218
I like this new girl better
than the one I talked to yesterday.

959
01:29:41,287 --> 01:29:42,948
I'm not sorry she's gone.

960
01:29:43,489 --> 01:29:44,957
Neither am I.

961
01:29:46,258 --> 01:29:48,750
And this fruit peddler, will you miss him?

962
01:29:48,828 --> 01:29:51,195
Yes, Peter. I'll miss him.

963
01:29:57,336 --> 01:29:59,498
- Billy Bragg.
- Ave. aye, sir?

964
01:30:00,206 --> 01:30:02,174
Take the señorita ashore and stay with her.

965
01:30:02,241 --> 01:30:04,676
But I'm sailing with you, sir.
Have you forgotten the oath?

966
01:30:04,744 --> 01:30:07,008
No, and don't you forget it, either.

967
01:30:07,079 --> 01:30:09,878
Do you think I'd trust her with anybody
but one of my own men?

968
01:30:09,949 --> 01:30:12,281
<i>- Aye, sir.
- I'll be checking on you, Billy,</i>

969
01:30:12,351 --> 01:30:14,877
because one of these days, Lady Chance
will bring me back to La Hacha.

970
01:30:14,954 --> 01:30:18,948
Orders is orders, sir.
You can always depend on Billy Bragg, sir.

971
01:30:21,727 --> 01:30:24,719
- This way, milady.
- To the boat, men.

972
01:30:38,611 --> 01:30:41,672
She's the prettiest lady I've ever seen.

973
01:30:54,226 --> 01:30:56,923
- Let's put to sea, Tom.
- Aye, aye, sir.

974
01:30:56,996 --> 01:30:59,863
All hands, stand by to make sail!

975
01:31:02,835 --> 01:31:04,303
Weigh anchor.

976
01:31:04,804 --> 01:31:06,670
Weigh anchor!

977
01:31:07,506 --> 01:31:09,474
Man the lookouts, lads!
