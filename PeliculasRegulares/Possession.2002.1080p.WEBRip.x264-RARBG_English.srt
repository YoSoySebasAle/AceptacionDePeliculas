1
00:00:43,156 --> 00:00:46,281
They say that women change.

2
00:00:46,365 --> 00:00:48,949
'Tis so,

3
00:00:49,031 --> 00:00:53,156
but you are ever-constant
in your changefulness.

4
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,281
Like that still thread
of falling river,

5
00:00:56,365 --> 00:01:00,615
one from source to last embrace
in the still pool.

6
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:04,824
Ever-anewed
and ever moving on.

7
00:01:04,907 --> 00:01:06,949
From first to last.
"From first to last,

8
00:01:07,031 --> 00:01:09,532
a myriad water drops.
"A myriad water drops.

9
00:01:09,615 --> 00:01:12,699
"And you--
I love you for it--

10
00:01:12,782 --> 00:01:17,990
are the force that moves
and holds the form."

11
00:01:18,073 --> 00:01:19,448
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

12
00:01:19,532 --> 00:01:21,824
you've just heard
a snippet

13
00:01:21,907 --> 00:01:25,740
from one of only two copies
of this poem

14
00:01:25,824 --> 00:01:28,824
by Mr. Randolph Henry Ash,

15
00:01:28,907 --> 00:01:33,323
poet laureate
to Queen Victoria herself.

16
00:01:33,407 --> 00:01:36,990
And this gorgeous ode
to his nuptial bliss,

17
00:01:37,073 --> 00:01:41,198
written in his own hand,
begins our bidding today.

18
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:46,073
May we start the bidding
please at £40,000.

19
00:02:13,323 --> 00:02:16,824
- Bit of an old monster.
- Yeah.

20
00:02:16,907 --> 00:02:21,198
But an important monster.
It's Randolph Ash's.

21
00:02:21,281 --> 00:02:23,448
Yes. Who are you
with again?

22
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:28,699
I'm, uh, Roland Michell.
Who?

23
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:32,740
- Professor Blackadder's research assistant.
- Isn't that Dr. Wolfe?

24
00:02:32,824 --> 00:02:37,156
Was. Fergus got the lectureship
at Saint John's... over me.

25
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,407
Of course he did.

26
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:42,240
Oh, yes, Dr. Wolfe
mentioned you.

27
00:02:42,323 --> 00:02:44,031
You're that American
who's over here.

28
00:02:45,615 --> 00:02:47,115
Well, I'm sure
there are others.

29
00:02:47,198 --> 00:02:49,532
I mean, after all,
you are our favorite colony.

30
00:02:57,281 --> 00:03:01,740
£10,000. Any further
offers on £10,000?

31
00:03:01,824 --> 00:03:03,490
£11,000.

32
00:03:03,573 --> 00:03:07,073
So when do your little suffragist trinkets come up for the--

33
00:03:07,156 --> 00:03:09,532
Look, Maud,
it's Mortimer Cropper.

34
00:03:09,615 --> 00:03:11,782
Oh, yes. That's someone
you should know.

35
00:03:11,865 --> 00:03:13,824
- You know him?
- Of him.

36
00:03:13,907 --> 00:03:16,323
Suffered through a lecture or two.
That sort of thing. Really.

37
00:03:16,407 --> 00:03:18,699
Mm-hmm.
He's a voracious collector from what I hear.

38
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:22,073
Yes.
His penchant for conquests is well documented.

39
00:03:22,156 --> 00:03:23,990
It's a very male quality.
Mm.

40
00:03:24,073 --> 00:03:26,407
I know it's vulgar,
but I have to introduce myself.

41
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,156
Oh, all right.

42
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,448
Oh, uh-- Damn.
Let's begin the bidding please at £4,000.

43
00:03:32,532 --> 00:03:37,115
£4,000. £4,000.
Excuse me. Sorry.

44
00:03:37,198 --> 00:03:40,115
£4,500. Um, Professor Cropper,
Fergus Wolfe.

45
00:03:40,198 --> 00:03:44,448
Um, we spoke actually after one of your papers at, uh,
at Trinity.

46
00:03:44,532 --> 00:03:48,073
You wouldn't remember. I'm sorry,
I don't. Nice coat though.

47
00:03:48,156 --> 00:03:51,615
Oh, thank you.
Uh, James Blackadder. You're with?

48
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:54,990
Ah, you're one of Blackadder's boys from the British Museum.

49
00:03:55,073 --> 00:03:57,573
Hello.
Hildebrand Ash,

50
00:03:57,657 --> 00:04:01,115
man of leisure.
Oh, hello.

51
00:04:01,198 --> 00:04:03,156
I don't know why Blackadder
comes to these things.

52
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,657
He hasn't got any money.

53
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:10,240
Well, he's Irish, you see.
He enjoys feeling persecuted.

54
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,407
Dear Madame,

55
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:40,615
Since our pleasant conversation,
I have thought of little else.

56
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:42,782
I write with a strong sense
of the necessity

57
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,990
of continuing our talk.

58
00:04:54,156 --> 00:04:57,824
Dear Madame,
I know that you came only to honor Crabb-Robinson

59
00:04:57,907 --> 00:05:00,782
at his small,
informal party

60
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:03,865
because he had been of assistance to your illustrious father.

61
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:06,573
Excuse me, sir.

62
00:05:06,657 --> 00:05:08,615
Meal is served.

63
00:05:10,156 --> 00:05:11,782
Thank you.

64
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:53,365
- Well, hello.
- Hello.

65
00:06:53,448 --> 00:06:56,281
Ah, my tenant.
Your evening sherry.

66
00:06:56,365 --> 00:06:58,490
Thank you.

67
00:06:58,573 --> 00:07:00,782
Candy, this is Roland.
Roland, Candy.

68
00:07:00,865 --> 00:07:04,699
- Hello again.
- Be a love and check on the duck, eh?

69
00:07:04,782 --> 00:07:08,907
- Okay.
- So, coming in?

70
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,949
So how do you
always know it's me?

71
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,824
I'm a solicitor.
I know everything.

72
00:07:14,907 --> 00:07:17,448
Candy, huh?
Oh, no, no, no, please.

73
00:07:17,532 --> 00:07:20,990
Candy's just a friend.
Why, are you interested?

74
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:23,824
I told you I'm off women.
Yeah, but...

75
00:07:23,907 --> 00:07:26,740
there's no reason
to be off women.

76
00:07:31,907 --> 00:07:33,949
Why do we always
sit in your hall?

77
00:07:34,031 --> 00:07:35,865
'Cause it's the best room in the house, really.

78
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:38,240
I bought this place
for the hallway.

79
00:07:38,323 --> 00:07:40,699
So, I found
something today

80
00:07:40,782 --> 00:07:44,031
I think is pretty incredible
in the London Library.

81
00:07:44,115 --> 00:07:47,281
- A place to sit.
- No.

82
00:07:47,365 --> 00:07:50,156
I found something of Ash's.
You know Randolph Ash?

83
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,198
Ash. Oh, doesn't he have

84
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:54,156
some sort
of celebration going?

85
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,115
It's the centenary of his love poems.
Terribly mushy ones.

86
00:07:57,198 --> 00:07:59,448
Found after his death
or something, weren't they?

87
00:07:59,532 --> 00:08:01,615
Is the table laid,
darling?

88
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:03,865
Listen.
What's it cost an hour?

89
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:06,031
No, no, Candy's
a friend, I told you.

90
00:08:06,115 --> 00:08:07,699
Not her, you.

91
00:08:07,782 --> 00:08:10,031
What do you charge
an hour, roughly?

92
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:13,115
Oh, uh, I don't know.
Five hundred.

93
00:08:13,198 --> 00:08:15,573
- Pounds?
- Mm.

94
00:08:15,657 --> 00:08:18,240
- Jesus, no wonder you have a nice hallway.
- Thank you.

95
00:08:18,323 --> 00:08:20,073
Okay, I wanna buy
seven minutes

96
00:08:20,156 --> 00:08:22,281
of attorney/client privilege
right now.

97
00:08:22,365 --> 00:08:24,490
Step into my office.

98
00:08:36,407 --> 00:08:39,448
Ash wrote those.
They're not the originals.

99
00:08:39,532 --> 00:08:41,156
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

100
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,573
How much time we got left?

101
00:08:42,657 --> 00:08:44,240
I've got to think of
a defense for you.

102
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:46,156
They're practically
love letters.

103
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,699
Rather racy, actually.

104
00:08:47,782 --> 00:08:49,240
See, Ash...

105
00:08:49,323 --> 00:08:51,156
supposedly never even looked
at another woman.

106
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,782
I mean, not even glanced at one
his entire marriage.

107
00:08:53,865 --> 00:08:55,782
Can you imagine what would happen if I could prove

108
00:08:55,865 --> 00:08:57,949
that Mr. Perfect Husband
had this, like,

109
00:08:58,031 --> 00:09:00,532
Shakespearean-type
dark lady thing going?

110
00:09:01,657 --> 00:09:03,990
Darling, the duck's done.

111
00:09:04,073 --> 00:09:06,156
Would you be a sweetheart
and do the sauce?

112
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,782
Yes, yes.

113
00:09:08,865 --> 00:09:12,615
- Duck, huh?
- Yeah, Peking.

114
00:09:12,699 --> 00:09:16,031
It's from around the corner.

115
00:09:16,115 --> 00:09:19,323
Yeah, but that
would be extraordinary.

116
00:09:20,865 --> 00:09:24,073
It would be rewriting
history, old chap.

117
00:09:25,323 --> 00:09:27,699
Yeah, it would be.

118
00:10:10,031 --> 00:10:12,198
Morning.
Morning.

119
00:10:12,281 --> 00:10:15,323
Ro-land.
Professor.

120
00:10:19,073 --> 00:10:20,865
I think
I made a discovery.

121
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:23,699
It'll turn out to have been
discovered 20 times already.

122
00:10:23,782 --> 00:10:27,281
- I don't think so.
- Surprise me.

123
00:10:27,365 --> 00:10:30,365
Ash's copy of Vico
in the London Library.

124
00:10:30,448 --> 00:10:33,532
It's full of his own notes on loose bits of paper all the way through.

125
00:10:33,615 --> 00:10:35,407
- Useful?
- Very.

126
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:38,740
Better have a look.
See what's what before

127
00:10:38,824 --> 00:10:41,323
Cropper turns up with his checkbook.
I also found-- Professor.

128
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:45,490
He made a mockery over at Sotheby's yesterday.
£1900 for a toothpick.

129
00:10:45,573 --> 00:10:48,699
Fergus. Where is Fergus?

130
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:52,198
- He's supposed to be teaching.
- I'll come with you.

131
00:10:52,281 --> 00:10:55,031
No need.
The novice blunders on the discovery.

132
00:10:55,115 --> 00:10:57,365
The scholar
investigates.

133
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:01,782
You get on with those wretched requests for Ellen's stuff.

134
00:11:01,865 --> 00:11:04,532
I'll go straight from there
to my class.

135
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,699
"Thank you, Roland.
What a wonderful discovery.

136
00:11:09,782 --> 00:11:11,448
They're magically
delicious."

137
00:11:11,532 --> 00:11:15,740
- He's a meany.
- That's a very nice name for what he is.

138
00:11:15,824 --> 00:11:17,907
Wretched requests, please.

139
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:21,198
"How many jars
of gooseberry jam

140
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:24,031
did Ash's wife, Ellen,
make in 1850?"

141
00:11:24,115 --> 00:11:28,699
Hmm. This is not
a job for a grown-up.

142
00:11:34,156 --> 00:11:36,323
Gooseberry.

143
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:42,699
Cooking.
Gooseberry jam.

144
00:11:45,156 --> 00:11:47,407
Cooking, 142.

145
00:12:05,323 --> 00:12:08,782
What about a small,
informal party?

146
00:12:08,865 --> 00:12:11,365
1859.

147
00:12:24,907 --> 00:12:27,240
My headache
last night prevented me

148
00:12:27,323 --> 00:12:30,490
from accompanying Randolph
to dear Crabb-Robinson's

149
00:12:30,573 --> 00:12:33,990
for a dinner honoring
the poetess Christabel LaMotte.

150
00:12:34,073 --> 00:12:36,156
He was reluctant
to attend without me,

151
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,699
but I was persistent
and finally persuaded him.

152
00:12:39,782 --> 00:12:42,281
Ash, do you know
Professor Spear?

153
00:12:42,365 --> 00:12:44,198
I'm delighted.

154
00:12:44,281 --> 00:12:46,990
Mrs. Jameson.
Mrs. Jameson.

155
00:12:47,073 --> 00:12:48,990
Charmed.

156
00:12:49,073 --> 00:12:51,323
Miss Glover.

157
00:12:51,407 --> 00:12:53,365
Oh, Miss Glover.

158
00:12:53,448 --> 00:12:56,448
- And Miss LaMotte.
- Miss LaMotte.

159
00:12:56,532 --> 00:12:59,949
The highest pleasure.

160
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:04,532
Randolph reported the party
went off very well indeed.

161
00:13:04,615 --> 00:13:07,115
The discussion of poetry
was animated,

162
00:13:07,198 --> 00:13:11,699
with Miss LaMotte speaking more forcibly than anyone expected.

163
00:13:11,782 --> 00:13:15,240
Surprises me, Madame,
that a lady who lives as quietly as you do

164
00:13:15,323 --> 00:13:19,365
wouldn't be aware
of my modest success.

165
00:13:19,448 --> 00:13:23,407
Oh, I'm very aware that the papers herald you weekly.

166
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,699
It is you, however,
who surprise me.

167
00:13:26,782 --> 00:13:30,657
- And why is that?
- Judging from your work,

168
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,073
I'm surprised you'd even
acknowledge my existence,

169
00:13:33,156 --> 00:13:35,031
or any woman's
for that matter,

170
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:37,281
since you show us such
small regard on the page.

171
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:41,198
You cut me, Madame.

172
00:13:41,281 --> 00:13:43,156
I'm sorry.

173
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,615
I only meant to scratch.

174
00:13:47,949 --> 00:13:50,198
Hey, Fergus.

175
00:13:50,281 --> 00:13:53,740
Ah, hello, Roland.

176
00:13:53,824 --> 00:13:56,865
What is it you chaps always say,
"How's it hanging?"

177
00:13:56,949 --> 00:14:00,365
Well, we usually just say "hey."
Unless you're gay.

178
00:14:00,448 --> 00:14:02,073
Oh.
Listen.

179
00:14:02,156 --> 00:14:03,573
Let me ask you
something.

180
00:14:03,657 --> 00:14:05,156
Do you know
a Dr. Maud Bailey?

181
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,115
Maud! Oh, yes,
I know Maud very well.

182
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:09,532
She teaches gender studies
at Lincoln.

183
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,573
Oh. Would she
be helpful?

184
00:14:11,657 --> 00:14:13,990
I'm checking out
Christabel LaMotte.

185
00:14:14,073 --> 00:14:16,407
She's a poet, writing
around about 1859.

186
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,407
Yes, yes. Why would you
be interested in her?

187
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:22,281
Oh, nothing.
It's just I had some requests about Ellen Ash's papers.

188
00:14:22,365 --> 00:14:23,949
But LaMotte's name
came up, so--

189
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:25,573
God, the keeper
of Ellen's flame.

190
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:28,115
I mean, that's the bottom
of the food chain, old sport.

191
00:14:28,198 --> 00:14:31,907
Yeah, but I got to stay on the food chain,
old sport. That's why I do it.

192
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,448
Right. Well, "Publish or perish,"
as they say.

193
00:14:34,532 --> 00:14:37,323
Or in your case,
"Perish or perish."

194
00:14:39,824 --> 00:14:42,156
So would she--
this Maud Bailey person?

195
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,281
Oh, yes, but I'd be careful
if I were you.

196
00:14:44,365 --> 00:14:45,782
Why? What's she like?

197
00:14:45,865 --> 00:14:48,240
Well, she thicks
men's blood with cold.

198
00:14:48,323 --> 00:14:52,115
Oh, great.
Or if you prefer the American vernacular,

199
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:55,865
she's a regular
ball-breaker.

200
00:15:04,156 --> 00:15:05,865
Mr. Michell?

201
00:15:08,323 --> 00:15:11,365
What? I'm sorry.
Roland Michell.

202
00:15:11,448 --> 00:15:13,281
Yes.

203
00:15:13,365 --> 00:15:16,573
You're Maud.
Bailey. Dr. Bailey, yes.

204
00:15:16,657 --> 00:15:20,323
There's nothing in my index.
No mention of Ash at all.

205
00:15:20,407 --> 00:15:22,281
Well, Ash and LaMotte
definitely met.

206
00:15:22,365 --> 00:15:25,365
Really? When?
June, 1859.

207
00:15:25,448 --> 00:15:27,824
At a dinner party
given by Crabb-Robinson.

208
00:15:27,907 --> 00:15:30,615
It's in his diary.

209
00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:33,990
And you jumped from that to the idea that they corresponded.

210
00:15:34,073 --> 00:15:36,240
I found an unfinished draft
of a letter in a book--

211
00:15:36,323 --> 00:15:38,490
Addressed to LaMotte?
No, just "Dear Madame."

212
00:15:38,573 --> 00:15:40,573
But there were three women at Crabb-Robinson's dinner party,

213
00:15:40,657 --> 00:15:42,615
and out of the three
it's likeliest to be LaMotte.

214
00:15:42,699 --> 00:15:45,657
So maybe there's something
in LaMotte's letters.

215
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,615
There aren't many from
the Richmond period--

216
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:50,323
the time you're
interested in.

217
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,407
I'm descended from
Christabel, actually.

218
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,657
I'm her niece,
thrice removed.

219
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:59,198
Three grades.
That's what "thrice" usually means.

220
00:16:01,323 --> 00:16:03,573
Oh, maybe
I shouldn't have come.

221
00:16:03,657 --> 00:16:05,407
It does seem
rather pointless.

222
00:16:06,782 --> 00:16:08,657
Well, I suppose
since you're here,

223
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,073
you could have a look
through Blanche's diary.

224
00:16:11,156 --> 00:16:13,490
Who's Blanche?
Blanche Glover.

225
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:16,532
Christabel's companion.
Her lover.

226
00:16:16,615 --> 00:16:18,657
Oh, you look surprised.

227
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,865
I didn't know she was-- Didn't know she was a lesbian.

228
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:22,615
No. I mean, don't get me wrong,
I like lesbians.

229
00:16:22,699 --> 00:16:25,073
Yes, well, unfortunately,
they didn't have

230
00:16:25,156 --> 00:16:27,865
video cameras in those days,
so you're out of luck.

231
00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:29,782
Now I see why you think
it's so unlikely.

232
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:31,240
Not from that point of view.

233
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,532
I mean, God, she could
have been bisexual.

234
00:16:33,615 --> 00:16:35,573
There's no evidence she was,
but in theory--

235
00:16:35,657 --> 00:16:38,407
Did you not do any reading
before you came?

236
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,782
Is this like an oral exam?
Yes, I suppose it is.

237
00:16:40,865 --> 00:16:42,782
I mean, you don't know
the first thing about her,

238
00:16:42,865 --> 00:16:44,448
and yet you make
these leaps.

239
00:16:44,532 --> 00:16:47,824
Hey, you're the one who called her a lesbian,
not me.

240
00:16:59,865 --> 00:17:02,907
Letters, letters, letters.

241
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,740
Not for me.

242
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:08,156
Letters I am not meant
to know or see.

243
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:24,365
Thank you, Jane.

244
00:17:31,865 --> 00:17:35,657
- You do not have to hide them from me.
- I'm not hiding them.

245
00:17:36,865 --> 00:17:40,740
You say they are not hidden,
but they are.

246
00:17:40,824 --> 00:17:44,740
Tucked away...
as if they were from Cupid himself.

247
00:17:47,573 --> 00:17:49,490
What does he want?

248
00:17:49,573 --> 00:17:52,740
To be my friend.
Friend.

249
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,699
They always try and give
what they want a decent name.

250
00:17:57,782 --> 00:18:01,907
Blanche, no.
No, Blanche, listen.

251
00:18:03,407 --> 00:18:08,198
What we have...
is ours.

252
00:18:08,281 --> 00:18:10,407
No one can change that.

253
00:18:17,407 --> 00:18:19,407
'Tis already changed.

254
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,824
- Find anything?
- Maybe.

255
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,782
So what are
those bookmarks, then?

256
00:19:04,865 --> 00:19:07,740
Blanche writes about letters.

257
00:19:07,824 --> 00:19:10,949
Letters, letters that Christabel
wrote and received.

258
00:19:11,031 --> 00:19:13,198
And it nearly
drove Blanche crazy.

259
00:19:13,281 --> 00:19:15,031
Where are they?

260
00:19:15,115 --> 00:19:18,198
Lost. Destroyed. Who knows?
There's lots we haven't got.

261
00:19:18,281 --> 00:19:21,407
Not one of Blanche's paintings has ever turned up,
for instance.

262
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:24,490
So who do you think
wrote the letters?

263
00:19:24,573 --> 00:19:26,907
We've never been able
to verify who he was,

264
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:29,532
but Ash certainly isn't
one of the candidates.

265
00:19:29,615 --> 00:19:31,949
You've got nothing.

266
00:19:32,031 --> 00:19:33,740
I mean,
it's just a thought.

267
00:19:33,824 --> 00:19:35,740
Of course, I've thrown out
a lot of thoughts today,

268
00:19:35,824 --> 00:19:38,156
and you've pretty much
shot them all down, so--

269
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,824
Yes, well,
it seems like a bit of a wild-goose chase to me.

270
00:19:41,907 --> 00:19:43,532
I'd like to do
some more reading.

271
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:46,907
I suppose you'll wish to
stay here overnight, then?

272
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,699
Well, I can't really afford
to stay overnight.

273
00:19:48,782 --> 00:19:51,573
Unless you want me huddled
downstairs in your doorway.

274
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:56,448
I suppose I could put up with you for one evening,
couldn't I?

275
00:20:05,407 --> 00:20:08,365
No doubt you know
Fergus Wolfe then.

276
00:20:08,448 --> 00:20:11,865
I'm sorry. Uh, yeah,
we're in the same department.

277
00:20:11,949 --> 00:20:14,615
I imagine that
he told you that we're

278
00:20:14,699 --> 00:20:16,657
occasionally
on together.

279
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:21,281
- No, he didn't.
- What did he--

280
00:20:21,365 --> 00:20:24,949
Did he say anything...
about me?

281
00:20:25,031 --> 00:20:27,281
Uh--

282
00:20:27,365 --> 00:20:29,365
No.

283
00:20:31,949 --> 00:20:34,365
Right. I'll use the bathroom first.
Get out of your way.

284
00:20:34,448 --> 00:20:37,824
Please.
I'm just sort of a brush and flush kind of guy, so--

285
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,031
Forget I said that.

286
00:20:43,115 --> 00:20:45,156
Maud.

287
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,407
Can I show you something?

288
00:21:02,573 --> 00:21:04,615
Are these-- How did you get-- Those are the originals.

289
00:21:04,699 --> 00:21:06,657
I took them.
I sort of stole them. Took them?

290
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,657
Where from?
The London Library.

291
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,699
- How could you do that?
- It was on impulse.

292
00:21:11,782 --> 00:21:14,323
Impulse?

293
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:16,907
Right.
I've seen that take-what-you-want attitude in other--

294
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,699
What, in other Americans?

295
00:21:18,782 --> 00:21:22,782
God, what is it with
you people and Americans?

296
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:25,365
Look, I know that I shouldn't have taken them.
I know that.

297
00:21:25,448 --> 00:21:27,699
But, Maud, I want to
find out what happened.

298
00:21:27,782 --> 00:21:29,532
Did he or didn't he
send the letter?

299
00:21:29,615 --> 00:21:31,699
You might not buy into
my theory, but to me

300
00:21:31,782 --> 00:21:33,699
Blanche's diary suggests
that it's possible.

301
00:21:33,782 --> 00:21:36,323
Wouldn't someone have unearthed a thing like this?

302
00:21:36,407 --> 00:21:39,699
- That's what makes it so big.
- Potentially so big.

303
00:21:39,782 --> 00:21:43,615
- Well, no one has.
- Probably because those were never sent.

304
00:22:11,907 --> 00:22:14,407
Are you doing your homework?

305
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:18,407
No, I'm just...
writing stuff.

306
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,407
Stuff for me.
It's nothing.

307
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:23,615
You're a closet poet.
Uh...

308
00:22:23,699 --> 00:22:26,073
more like basement,
really.

309
00:22:26,156 --> 00:22:28,740
I'm just, uh,
just fooling around.

310
00:22:28,824 --> 00:22:30,907
Is that what you want to be when you grow up?

311
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:34,824
No, I'm gonna be safe and teach like everybody else.

312
00:22:36,448 --> 00:22:40,073
Besides, there's no such thing as poets anymore.

313
00:22:40,156 --> 00:22:43,365
Well... poet,

314
00:22:43,448 --> 00:22:47,907
do you want to see Christabel's family home before you go?

315
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:50,156
Michell's late again.

316
00:22:52,532 --> 00:22:55,115
Roland asked for
another day off, Fergus.

317
00:22:55,198 --> 00:22:57,073
Oh, really?
Where's he gone?

318
00:22:57,156 --> 00:22:59,990
I didn't ask,
and he didn't say.

319
00:23:00,073 --> 00:23:02,073
He's an American,
for God's sake.

320
00:23:02,156 --> 00:23:04,115
He's probably off
trafficking drugs.

321
00:23:04,198 --> 00:23:06,323
Did his new discovery
lead to anything?

322
00:23:06,407 --> 00:23:09,949
Ash's Vico--
are you dreaming?

323
00:23:10,031 --> 00:23:12,198
Vico? No, no,

324
00:23:12,281 --> 00:23:14,240
this had something to do
with Christabel LaMotte.

325
00:23:14,323 --> 00:23:17,407
He went to see Dr. Bailey
in Lincoln-- a woman.

326
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:20,740
LaMotte. Hmm. No.

327
00:23:20,824 --> 00:23:23,824
- Well, it probably came to nothing then.
- Exactly.

328
00:23:23,907 --> 00:23:26,573
Or he would
have told you.

329
00:23:29,865 --> 00:23:31,407
Wouldn't he?

330
00:23:40,907 --> 00:23:43,323
Seal Court's
over there.

331
00:23:43,407 --> 00:23:46,156
So how long did Christabel live at this Seal Court place?

332
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,907
Ages. The last 20
or so years of her life.

333
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,824
Excuse me.
Sorry.

334
00:23:52,907 --> 00:23:56,323
"To a dusty shelf
we aspire."

335
00:23:56,407 --> 00:24:00,448
You should drop by Seal Court
before the train.

336
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:07,365
And what do you do
in London, Mr. Michell?

337
00:24:07,448 --> 00:24:11,156
Are you a teacher as well?
No, not yet. I'm doing a fellowship.

338
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,073
- Which means what, exactly?
- On the dole.

339
00:24:17,448 --> 00:24:19,699
Um, my field's
Victorian poetry.

340
00:24:19,782 --> 00:24:22,448
We had a sort of poet
in this house once.

341
00:24:22,532 --> 00:24:25,156
Terrible, sentimental stuff
about God and death

342
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,031
and the dew and fairies.

343
00:24:27,115 --> 00:24:30,699
Why don't you show this young man Christabel's room, Maud?

344
00:24:30,782 --> 00:24:33,907
And why don't you
stay tonight?

345
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:36,865
You're under no obligation
to stay, of course.

346
00:24:36,949 --> 00:24:39,865
It's just Joan's way.
Misses our daughter.

347
00:24:39,949 --> 00:24:42,323
Quite a drive back, actually.
No, we're fine.

348
00:24:42,407 --> 00:24:44,365
Oh, well.

349
00:24:44,448 --> 00:24:46,865
Hardly ever come up here.

350
00:24:46,949 --> 00:24:51,824
With the wheelchair, of course,
we bunk down on the ground floor.

351
00:24:57,115 --> 00:25:00,323
I haven't been up here
since I was a child.

352
00:25:03,031 --> 00:25:06,532
Maud, is this the photograph
at your house?

353
00:25:06,615 --> 00:25:08,907
Yes, that's
Christabel's niece, May.

354
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,740
That's my
great-great-grandmother.

355
00:25:10,824 --> 00:25:15,990
Christabel wrote dozens
of poems about this place.

356
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,949
"What are
they who haunt our dreams

357
00:25:23,031 --> 00:25:25,281
"and weaken our desires

358
00:25:25,365 --> 00:25:27,281
and turn us
from a solid face."

359
00:25:27,365 --> 00:25:29,573
"And in the depth
of wintery night,

360
00:25:29,657 --> 00:25:32,365
they slumber
in the night and bright."

361
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:36,907
"Dolly keeps a secret
safer than a friend.

362
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:40,115
Dolly's silent sympathy
lasts without end."

363
00:25:40,198 --> 00:25:44,365
"No rush of action,
this is our doom.

364
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:49,532
To live a long life out
in a dark room."

365
00:25:51,865 --> 00:25:54,323
Maud.

366
00:25:54,365 --> 00:25:56,657
It's pretty
incredible, huh?

367
00:26:04,115 --> 00:26:06,782
Fergus, it's me.

368
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:10,907
I-I'm out of town tonight
on business.

369
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:12,657
I've stumbled
onto a connection

370
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,615
between Christabel
and Randolph Ash

371
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:16,657
and have a few questions
for you.

372
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:22,240
Call me on 015-2263-2416.

373
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,281
Roland.

374
00:26:37,365 --> 00:26:39,990
Roland.

375
00:26:40,073 --> 00:26:43,365
Roland. Roland.
No!

376
00:26:43,448 --> 00:26:47,990
Roland, it's me.
It's Maud.

377
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,907
- What is it?
- Listen.

378
00:26:52,073 --> 00:26:55,782
"Dolly keeps a secret
safer than a friend.

379
00:26:55,865 --> 00:27:00,615
Dolly's silent sympathy
lasts without end."

380
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,198
God.

381
00:27:42,657 --> 00:27:44,573
I was so sure.

382
00:27:44,657 --> 00:27:48,365
Sympathy.
Sympathy.

383
00:27:48,448 --> 00:27:50,532
Sympathy, meaning what?

384
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,699
Mutual affection
or understanding.

385
00:27:53,782 --> 00:27:59,281
Favor, pity, or even accord.
But that's not it, is it?

386
00:27:59,365 --> 00:28:01,865
That's not it at all.

387
00:28:03,156 --> 00:28:06,657
She uses silent sympathy
in a more classical context.

388
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,949
Like structural support.
Dolly conceals it.

389
00:28:10,031 --> 00:28:13,657
Yes, but not within,
beneath.

390
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:21,782
There's a door.
There's a door.

391
00:28:38,031 --> 00:28:40,031
- I can't believe it.
- Let me see.

392
00:28:40,115 --> 00:28:42,115
Be-Be careful. They're very precious.
I'll be very careful.

393
00:28:42,198 --> 00:28:44,115
Oh, God, we shouldn't
be doing this.

394
00:28:44,198 --> 00:28:46,073
What do you mean,
we shouldn't be doing this?

395
00:28:46,156 --> 00:28:47,990
Why'd you drag me
up here, then?

396
00:28:48,073 --> 00:28:50,240
What are you doing?
I'm going to read.

397
00:28:50,365 --> 00:28:51,907
Stop. We've got to
ask the Baileys.

398
00:28:51,949 --> 00:28:53,156
You ask,
and the next time

399
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,907
you see these is
under glass in New Mexico.

400
00:28:55,031 --> 00:28:56,073
Stop it.
Stop. Stop. Stop.

401
00:28:56,198 --> 00:28:57,323
All right. All right.

402
00:28:57,365 --> 00:28:59,073
Put-- can we please
at least do it properly?

403
00:28:59,156 --> 00:29:01,615
Let me run downstairs and get some note cards and some pencils.

404
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,073
All right.
Go, go! Hurry!

405
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,198
Look at this.
We've got Ash and Christabel's letters here.

406
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,532
Look. Come here.
Listen. What?

407
00:29:45,615 --> 00:29:48,198
"Dear Miss LaMotte,

408
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,240
"It was a great pleasure
to talk to you

409
00:29:50,323 --> 00:29:53,824
"at dear
Crabb-Robinson's party.

410
00:29:53,907 --> 00:29:57,365
"May I hope that you too
enjoyed our talk,

411
00:29:57,407 --> 00:30:00,949
and may I have the pleasure
of calling on you?"

412
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,407
She says, "No,
but you may write.

413
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:10,615
"Would you rather not have a letter,
however imperfect,

414
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,615
"than a plate
of cucumber sandwiches,

415
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,740
"however exquisitely
fine cut?

416
00:30:16,782 --> 00:30:19,740
Know you would,
and so would I."

417
00:30:22,782 --> 00:30:27,740
"I was entranced and moved by your brief portrait of your father."

418
00:30:27,782 --> 00:30:30,740
"I write nonsense,
but if you can't write again,

419
00:30:30,782 --> 00:30:33,240
"you shall have a sober essay
on what you will.

420
00:30:33,323 --> 00:30:36,907
"Yours to command
in some things.

421
00:30:36,949 --> 00:30:39,198
"Where I was born,
Christabel LaMotte."

422
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,365
"Was a small place too.

423
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:43,740
"Not like this.
Not bare.

424
00:30:43,782 --> 00:30:46,240
"A brilliant, dusty hutch
of mysteries..."

425
00:30:46,323 --> 00:30:49,573
...a cabinet of curiosities.

426
00:30:51,031 --> 00:30:53,365
What did my eyes
first light on?

427
00:30:53,448 --> 00:30:56,073
I am a creature of my pen.

428
00:30:56,198 --> 00:30:59,365
My pen is
the best part of me.

429
00:30:59,448 --> 00:31:02,073
I send you now
two more poems.

430
00:31:02,156 --> 00:31:05,240
I eagerly read
your mythic tales of mire

431
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:08,365
and found them
both charming and sad.

432
00:31:08,448 --> 00:31:12,323
Your verse is rich,
but perhaps the metaphor is richer.

433
00:31:12,365 --> 00:31:14,407
Dear Mr. Ash,

434
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:17,740
I live circumscribed
and self-communing.

435
00:31:17,824 --> 00:31:19,782
It is best so,

436
00:31:19,907 --> 00:31:21,740
not like a princess
in the thicket,

437
00:31:21,824 --> 00:31:23,949
more like a spider
in her web.

438
00:31:24,073 --> 00:31:28,448
"Inclined to snap at visitors
or trespassers,

439
00:31:28,532 --> 00:31:32,198
"not perceiving the distinction
until too late.

440
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,573
Thus, it is unwise to call."

441
00:31:34,657 --> 00:31:37,073
I know you live very quietly.

442
00:31:37,156 --> 00:31:39,198
But I could be
very quiet.

443
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,573
I only want to discuss
Dante and Shakespeare,

444
00:31:41,657 --> 00:31:44,532
Wordsworth and Coleridge
and Goethe.

445
00:31:44,615 --> 00:31:48,740
Not forgetting, of course,
Christabel LaMotte

446
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:52,365
and the ambitious
fairy project.

447
00:32:06,657 --> 00:32:09,949
Oh, sir, things flicker
and shift.

448
00:32:10,031 --> 00:32:13,740
All spangle and sparkle
and flashes.

449
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:17,323
I have sat all this long evening
by my fireside,

450
00:32:17,407 --> 00:32:20,115
turning towards
a caving in,

451
00:32:20,198 --> 00:32:22,699
the crumbling
of the consumed coals,

452
00:32:22,782 --> 00:32:25,573
to where I am leading myself--

453
00:32:25,657 --> 00:32:28,281
to lifeless dust, sir.

454
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:30,281
My dear friend--

455
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:34,365
for I may call myself
a friend, may I not?

456
00:32:35,532 --> 00:32:37,824
I speak to you as I would
speak to any person

457
00:32:37,907 --> 00:32:40,824
who possesses
my true thoughts,

458
00:32:40,907 --> 00:32:43,490
for my true thoughts have spent more time in your company

459
00:32:43,573 --> 00:32:47,782
than in anyone else's
these last few weeks.

460
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:50,323
Where my thoughts are,

461
00:32:50,407 --> 00:32:52,573
there am I in truth.

462
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:58,073
"My dear friend,
it has been borne in upon me

463
00:32:58,156 --> 00:33:01,990
that there are dangers
in our continued conversation."

464
00:33:02,073 --> 00:33:04,448
The world would not look well
upon letters

465
00:33:04,532 --> 00:33:07,949
between a woman living
in shared solitude as I do

466
00:33:08,031 --> 00:33:09,782
and a man...

467
00:33:09,865 --> 00:33:14,031
even if that man
were a great poet.

468
00:33:14,115 --> 00:33:16,699
And if one is to live
in this way,

469
00:33:16,782 --> 00:33:21,365
it is imperative to appear respectable in the eyes of that world

470
00:33:21,448 --> 00:33:23,782
and your wife.

471
00:33:25,198 --> 00:33:27,865
It is a sealed pact.

472
00:33:27,949 --> 00:33:31,949
It is a chosen way of life in which I have been wondrously happy

473
00:33:32,031 --> 00:33:35,198
and not alone in being so.

474
00:33:35,281 --> 00:33:38,156
"I have chosen a way,
dear friend.

475
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,115
"I must hold to it.

476
00:33:41,198 --> 00:33:43,907
"Be patient.
Be generous. Forgive.

477
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:48,782
"May I also request that you return my correspondence to me.

478
00:33:48,865 --> 00:33:52,699
"In this way,
at least our letters will remain together.

479
00:33:52,782 --> 00:33:56,198
"I have known incandescence

480
00:33:56,281 --> 00:34:00,156
"and must decline
to sample it any further.

481
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,949
"This now goes to the post.

482
00:34:03,031 --> 00:34:06,824
Forgive its faults
and forgive me. Christabel."

483
00:34:08,115 --> 00:34:09,782
My dear Christabel...

484
00:34:11,156 --> 00:34:14,323
your letter came as a shock
to me, I will confess.

485
00:34:15,824 --> 00:34:18,115
I was at first
not only shocked,

486
00:34:18,198 --> 00:34:20,824
but angry that
you should write so.

487
00:34:22,323 --> 00:34:23,990
As you've asked
about my wife,

488
00:34:24,073 --> 00:34:26,448
however, I will tell you.

489
00:34:26,532 --> 00:34:30,573
I love Ellen,
but not as I love you.

490
00:34:30,657 --> 00:34:34,323
There are good reasons
which I cannot discuss

491
00:34:34,407 --> 00:34:38,657
why my love for you
may not hurt her.

492
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,281
I do not feel
I have been

493
00:34:40,365 --> 00:34:41,865
a proper wife
to you, Randolph.

494
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:43,281
Without children,

495
00:34:43,365 --> 00:34:44,824
without ever
any kind of physical--

496
00:34:44,907 --> 00:34:47,407
Nonsense, Ellen.

497
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:49,573
Nonsense.

498
00:34:51,198 --> 00:34:54,365
There are many
types of love.

499
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:57,365
All sorts.

500
00:34:57,448 --> 00:35:03,198
And ours
are good between us.

501
00:35:05,365 --> 00:35:07,532
It has been
most profound.

502
00:35:11,115 --> 00:35:13,782
I must say to you
what is in my mind.

503
00:35:13,865 --> 00:35:17,115
I have called you my muse,
and so you are.

504
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:20,365
I could call you
with even greater truth...

505
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:22,782
my love.

506
00:35:22,865 --> 00:35:26,990
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?
What? Don't do that. What?

507
00:35:27,073 --> 00:35:29,740
So he sends his response.
He sends her more letters.

508
00:35:29,824 --> 00:35:32,407
She doesn't answer them.
She ignores them.

509
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:34,990
Typical.

510
00:35:35,073 --> 00:35:38,031
No. She-She chose her life
with Blanche.

511
00:35:38,115 --> 00:35:41,740
It's not typical.
It's remarkable.

512
00:35:47,365 --> 00:35:49,448
"I shall hope against hope
that this note is the dove

513
00:35:49,532 --> 00:35:52,156
"which will return with
the wished-for olive branch.

514
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,949
My letters are like Noah's ravens-- they
have sped out across the Thames."

515
00:35:56,031 --> 00:36:01,281
They have sped out across the Thames and yet have not returned.

516
00:36:01,365 --> 00:36:05,115
I send this note by hand in the hope that you might receive it.

517
00:36:12,573 --> 00:36:14,740
Where are the letters?

518
00:36:14,824 --> 00:36:16,949
They're gone.

519
00:36:18,949 --> 00:36:22,865
I tore them up.
I burned them.

520
00:36:22,949 --> 00:36:25,407
And the others
from my desk?

521
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:27,156
The same.

522
00:36:29,573 --> 00:36:33,615
I beg for us to be as we were, Christabel.

523
00:36:33,699 --> 00:36:36,824
Sweetheart, please.

524
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:45,573
This house, so happy once,

525
00:36:45,657 --> 00:36:49,740
is full of weeping and wailing
and black headaches.

526
00:36:49,824 --> 00:36:52,198
I ask myself
to whom I may turn

527
00:36:52,281 --> 00:36:55,657
and think of you,
my friend--

528
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:59,657
the unwitting cause
of all this grief.

529
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:09,699
I shan't forget the first
glimpse of your form...

530
00:37:09,782 --> 00:37:14,740
illuminated as it was
by flashes of sunlight.

531
00:37:14,824 --> 00:37:17,782
I have dreamt nightly
of your face

532
00:37:17,865 --> 00:37:20,824
and walked the landscape
of my life with the rhythms

533
00:37:20,907 --> 00:37:24,615
of your writing
ringing in my ears.

534
00:37:24,699 --> 00:37:27,240
I shall never forget
our shining progress

535
00:37:27,323 --> 00:37:29,824
towards one another.

536
00:37:29,907 --> 00:37:35,281
Never have I felt such a concentration of my entire being.

537
00:37:35,365 --> 00:37:38,949
I cannot let you
burn me up,

538
00:37:39,031 --> 00:37:41,407
nor can I resist you.

539
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:47,031
No mere human can stand in a fire and not be consumed.

540
00:37:52,699 --> 00:37:55,865
You mind reading that last part out one more time?

541
00:37:58,365 --> 00:38:00,532
"I cannot let you
burn me up,

542
00:38:00,615 --> 00:38:03,699
"nor can I resist you.

543
00:38:05,532 --> 00:38:08,115
"No mere human
can stand in a fire

544
00:38:08,198 --> 00:38:11,198
and not be consumed."

545
00:38:11,281 --> 00:38:14,907
- That?
- Yeah.

546
00:38:19,615 --> 00:38:21,115
Thank you, and--

547
00:38:22,407 --> 00:38:27,281
"And I took your hand.
Mine rested in yours

548
00:38:27,365 --> 00:38:30,573
with trust and relief."

549
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,115
Do you have regrets?

550
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:49,240
I should regret venturing out to Crabb-Robinson's party that evening.

551
00:38:53,156 --> 00:38:55,532
I should regret it,
but I do not.

552
00:38:55,615 --> 00:38:59,615
Not even in that most sensible corner of my heart.

553
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,573
What are we to do?

554
00:39:09,657 --> 00:39:13,281
"I do not wish to
damage your life.

555
00:39:13,365 --> 00:39:16,824
"Nonetheless, I shall be in the church at noon tomorrow

556
00:39:16,907 --> 00:39:22,031
"with what strikes me
as the holiest of prayers

557
00:39:22,115 --> 00:39:26,323
"that you should join me
on a journey to Yorkshire

558
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:31,115
and journey out of time beyond our lives here on Earth."

559
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,532
This is unbelievable.
That was the last one.

560
00:39:41,615 --> 00:39:43,532
You're kidding me.
No.

561
00:39:45,532 --> 00:39:48,699
Well, did she go with him or not?
Hands up!

562
00:39:49,824 --> 00:39:51,532
You two?

563
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:58,782
What's this then?
- There's been no harm done, George.

564
00:39:58,865 --> 00:40:00,699
How do we know
if harm's been done?

565
00:40:00,782 --> 00:40:04,448
I think it was very clever
of Maud to find your treasure.

566
00:40:04,532 --> 00:40:08,448
Yes. Well, must
take advice, Joanie.

567
00:40:11,156 --> 00:40:13,782
How long before Sir George
takes advice?

568
00:40:13,865 --> 00:40:17,782
He'll dither around for
a while, but not long.

569
00:40:17,865 --> 00:40:20,782
Blanche's diary has nothing
for that period.

570
00:40:20,865 --> 00:40:22,949
What about Ellen Ash?
Did she keep a journal?

571
00:40:23,031 --> 00:40:26,323
Yeah, in London,
but it's mostly just boring housewife stuff.

572
00:40:26,407 --> 00:40:30,865
God is in the boring housewife stuff.
We should check it.

573
00:40:42,323 --> 00:40:44,323
Bailey here.
Bailey.

574
00:40:44,407 --> 00:40:46,365
Is that Dr. Heath?

575
00:40:46,448 --> 00:40:49,782
No. Um, I'm a friend
of Maud Bailey's.

576
00:40:49,865 --> 00:40:51,740
I was wondering,
is she there?

577
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:56,490
No, she isn't. Could you get off the line?
I'm expecting the doctor.

578
00:40:56,573 --> 00:40:58,907
Oh, um, have you seen
Roland Michell?

579
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:02,365
Not since
this morning, no.

580
00:41:02,448 --> 00:41:04,323
But his work
went well, did it?

581
00:41:04,407 --> 00:41:08,532
The fairy poem?
I haven't the foggiest idea.

582
00:41:08,615 --> 00:41:10,323
Do you mean
Christabel LaMotte?

583
00:41:10,407 --> 00:41:13,323
Get off the line!

584
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:31,865
I looked in Ellen's diary.
There's nothing.

585
00:41:31,949 --> 00:41:36,782
But, uh, this should
cheer you up.

586
00:41:39,198 --> 00:41:40,532
It's in her correspondence.

587
00:41:40,615 --> 00:41:43,657
I'm not going to ask
if this is the original.

588
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,115
I wouldn't.

589
00:41:47,115 --> 00:41:48,699
"Dear Mrs. Ash,

590
00:41:48,782 --> 00:41:51,115
"I'm at present
totally unknown to you,

591
00:41:51,198 --> 00:41:54,198
"but I have something
to impart to which

592
00:41:54,281 --> 00:41:59,865
"closely concerns both of us and is in my case a matter of life and death.

593
00:41:59,949 --> 00:42:04,865
"May I trespass on your time
and come to see you?

594
00:42:04,949 --> 00:42:09,699
"You would do wrong to keep this evidence which I send to you now.

595
00:42:09,782 --> 00:42:12,657
"It is not mine;
it is also not yours.

596
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:16,573
"What I say is true and urgent
as you will come to see.

597
00:42:16,657 --> 00:42:19,490
Yours sincerely,
Blanche Glover."

598
00:42:27,115 --> 00:42:29,031
Mrs. Ash.

599
00:42:32,782 --> 00:42:36,949
Maybe Blanche didn't tear the letters but
kept them and showed them to Ellen.

600
00:42:37,031 --> 00:42:39,782
It all fits beautifully.

601
00:42:39,865 --> 00:42:44,448
Well, perhaps, um,
both of our departments should work on this together.

602
00:42:44,532 --> 00:42:47,240
- Is that what you want?
- I don't know. Do you?

603
00:42:47,323 --> 00:42:49,615
No. I wanna go after them.
I wanna find out what happened.

604
00:42:49,699 --> 00:42:53,407
I wanna go to Yorkshire and follow their trail.
I need to know.

605
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:58,365
I thought you were mad when you
came to Lincoln with your stolen letter.

606
00:42:59,949 --> 00:43:02,907
Now I feel
exactly the same.

607
00:43:06,198 --> 00:43:08,156
I haven't really thanked you.

608
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,907
I mean, properly,
for all of this.

609
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:15,740
I have difficulty
with compliments and such.

610
00:43:15,824 --> 00:43:18,281
Giving or receiving?

611
00:43:18,365 --> 00:43:20,448
Both, actually.

612
00:43:20,532 --> 00:43:23,281
Well, I won't tell you
you're amazing-looking then.

613
00:43:23,365 --> 00:43:27,031
You're probably sick of hearing it.
Thank you. It's--

614
00:43:27,115 --> 00:43:29,907
I'm the last guy who'd act on it,
with Fergus and all.

615
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:31,615
- What does "and all" mean?
- Nothing.

616
00:43:31,699 --> 00:43:35,699
Just a little problem
that I have... socially.

617
00:43:35,782 --> 00:43:38,240
Do you take anything for it?

618
00:43:38,323 --> 00:43:41,198
It's not that kind
of a problem.

619
00:43:41,281 --> 00:43:46,073
It's just relationships on the whole.
They're not really for me.

620
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:50,907
- Anyway--
- Yes...

621
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:54,949
Anyway... thank you.

622
00:43:55,031 --> 00:43:57,281
You're welcome.

623
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:06,323
Thank you for agreeing
to meet me, Professor.

624
00:44:06,407 --> 00:44:08,490
Well, you made me rather curious.
Drink, sir?

625
00:44:08,573 --> 00:44:10,532
Scotch with
just a dash of soda.

626
00:44:10,615 --> 00:44:13,281
Sir? Thank you.
Uh, I'll have the same. Thank you.

627
00:44:14,907 --> 00:44:17,281
Um, I wanted to learn
of the connection

628
00:44:17,365 --> 00:44:20,407
between Ash
and Christabel LaMotte.

629
00:44:21,407 --> 00:44:23,240
LaMotte and Ash?
There isn't any.

630
00:44:23,323 --> 00:44:25,240
Well, Roland Michell
has made a discovery

631
00:44:25,323 --> 00:44:27,699
with a colleague of mine,
Maud Bailey.

632
00:44:27,782 --> 00:44:30,073
I'm sorry.
Who the hell is Roland Michell?

633
00:44:30,156 --> 00:44:34,240
Oh, Blackadder's research assistant.
American.

634
00:44:34,323 --> 00:44:38,365
Blondish. Well, anyway,
he seems to know you.

635
00:44:38,448 --> 00:44:40,407
And he thinks
it's important.

636
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:42,865
And does Blackadder agree?

637
00:44:42,949 --> 00:44:45,448
I don't believe
he knows anything about it.

638
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:20,657
Do you wish to be
lunched separately?

639
00:45:22,323 --> 00:45:24,198
Respectably,
elsewhere from me?

640
00:45:24,281 --> 00:45:27,115
I want to be with you.

641
00:45:27,198 --> 00:45:30,907
I understood that was
what we had decided.

642
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:36,281
These four weeks
only are ours

643
00:45:36,365 --> 00:45:38,865
but ours alone.

644
00:45:46,407 --> 00:45:48,532
Oh, I, uh--

645
00:45:53,699 --> 00:45:55,657
I hope you will
accept this ring.

646
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:58,365
I have brought a ring too.

647
00:45:59,865 --> 00:46:01,949
You see?

648
00:46:02,031 --> 00:46:04,532
Proof of my resolution.

649
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:23,573
You take my breath away.

650
00:46:46,907 --> 00:46:48,907
Not yet.

651
00:46:52,407 --> 00:46:54,740
No. Not yet.

652
00:46:57,865 --> 00:47:01,240
Shall we go out,
then, to explore?

653
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:22,615
There's your bathroom.

654
00:47:24,615 --> 00:47:27,115
Cupboard.

655
00:47:28,949 --> 00:47:31,156
Your lovely view.

656
00:47:33,448 --> 00:47:35,740
And, of course, the bed.

657
00:47:42,031 --> 00:47:43,824
We'll look
for another hotel.

658
00:47:43,907 --> 00:47:45,532
But this is
where Ash stayed.

659
00:47:45,615 --> 00:47:47,323
Then we'll have
to share a room.

660
00:47:47,407 --> 00:47:49,240
I can bring up
a folding bed

661
00:47:49,365 --> 00:47:51,907
for one of you,
if that's your problem.

662
00:47:54,323 --> 00:47:56,115
We work together, actually.
It's not--

663
00:47:56,198 --> 00:47:58,073
We were expecting two rooms.
Right.

664
00:47:58,156 --> 00:48:01,198
I'm sure it's more complicated
than I can imagine.

665
00:48:19,323 --> 00:48:21,699
That's a lovely brooch
you're wearing, miss.

666
00:48:21,782 --> 00:48:25,407
I reckon it could be one of
Issac Greenberg's designs.

667
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:29,824
I'll, uh, get the book
and see if I can tell.

668
00:48:37,198 --> 00:48:39,115
Where did you get this?

669
00:48:39,198 --> 00:48:42,740
I've had it for ages.
It was in the family dress-up box.

670
00:48:46,365 --> 00:48:49,490
Don't you see?
Ash bought the brooch for Ellen.

671
00:48:49,573 --> 00:48:54,281
The clasped hands.
Here in Whitby. We know that.

672
00:48:54,365 --> 00:48:56,573
And this for Christabel.
Oh, right.

673
00:48:56,657 --> 00:48:58,824
So while he was buying this,
he said, um,

674
00:48:58,907 --> 00:49:00,990
"Yes, I'll have the eternal embrace for my wife."

675
00:49:01,073 --> 00:49:02,949
No, he wouldn't have
said anything.

676
00:49:03,031 --> 00:49:04,949
He would have just
bought the brooch.

677
00:49:05,031 --> 00:49:06,740
Christabel
would have seen.

678
00:49:06,824 --> 00:49:08,407
It was accepted
between them.

679
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:11,198
Are you writing
fiction now?

680
00:49:13,573 --> 00:49:15,740
Maybe.

681
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,657
I'm having fun.

682
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:21,782
Are you?

683
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:24,907
Yes, I suppose I am.

684
00:49:26,532 --> 00:49:29,198
Don't grimace when you say it.
It's more convincing.

685
00:49:30,073 --> 00:49:32,782
I suppose
I can be a touch...

686
00:49:32,865 --> 00:49:36,490
empirical at times.

687
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:38,699
Just a touch.

688
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:42,740
Hey, you wanna go for a walk or something?

689
00:49:42,824 --> 00:49:44,615
I mean,
out in the hills.

690
00:49:44,699 --> 00:49:47,824
For sure it's earlier than the death of Victoria's Albert.

691
00:49:47,907 --> 00:49:51,657
Probably late '50s.
1860s maybe.

692
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,907
1859?

693
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:57,615
Ish?

694
00:50:09,031 --> 00:50:12,865
I think we're getting
near Thomason Falls.

695
00:50:12,949 --> 00:50:15,323
Cropper mentions it--
Mortimer Cropper?

696
00:50:15,407 --> 00:50:19,490
Yeah, Ash's biographer.
All-purpose asshole.

697
00:50:19,573 --> 00:50:21,865
He's literally trekked
every step of Ash's life.

698
00:50:21,949 --> 00:50:24,657
He's happy to tell you that too.
More than happy, I'm sure.

699
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:27,615
You know him, huh?

700
00:50:42,115 --> 00:50:44,740
That is beautiful.

701
00:50:47,865 --> 00:50:50,615
Maud. What?

702
00:50:50,699 --> 00:50:54,115
I think Christabel
did come here.

703
00:50:55,699 --> 00:50:58,281
Listen.

704
00:50:58,365 --> 00:51:02,532
"Three elements combined
to make the fourth.

705
00:51:02,615 --> 00:51:06,156
"But above the water and the light,
together made

706
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,907
a halo
in the darkened cave."

707
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:12,740
That poem's dated
1859, July.

708
00:51:12,824 --> 00:51:16,990
See if there's
a cave behind it.

709
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:19,699
That might be all
the proof we need.

710
00:51:25,865 --> 00:51:27,615
Ah--

711
00:51:27,699 --> 00:51:31,990
I know this is an awfully repressed sort of English thing to say,

712
00:51:32,073 --> 00:51:34,281
but what the hell
are you doing?

713
00:51:34,365 --> 00:51:36,323
There's only one way
to find out.

714
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:46,031
Of course, we could
have just asked someone.

715
00:52:10,657 --> 00:52:14,615
Whoo! Maud! Maud!

716
00:52:14,699 --> 00:52:17,573
I found it!

717
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:10,990
Your hands are shaking.

718
00:54:11,073 --> 00:54:13,198
Are you afraid?

719
00:54:14,365 --> 00:54:16,365
No.

720
00:54:17,365 --> 00:54:19,407
A little.

721
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:53,990
"These are and were there.

722
00:54:54,073 --> 00:54:58,615
"The garden and the tree,
the serpent at its root.

723
00:54:58,699 --> 00:55:03,532
"The fruit of gold, the woman
in the shadow of the boughs.

724
00:55:03,615 --> 00:55:07,865
"The running water
and the grassy space.

725
00:55:07,949 --> 00:55:11,365
They are and were there."

726
00:55:14,907 --> 00:55:17,073
I don't mind that.

727
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:23,699
See, you could grow
to like Ash.

728
00:55:23,782 --> 00:55:27,031
Yes.

729
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:30,198
He's sort of a soft-core
misogynist.

730
00:55:40,407 --> 00:55:43,490
Why do you always
tie your hair up like that?

731
00:55:47,407 --> 00:55:50,490
It has to do
with Fergus Wolfe mostly.

732
00:55:50,573 --> 00:55:53,949
Fergus?
How to do with Fergus?

733
00:55:56,782 --> 00:56:00,740
When we met,
he drove me mad quoting Yeats.

734
00:56:00,824 --> 00:56:04,657
"Who could love you for yourself alone and not your yellow hair?"

735
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:06,573
Yes.

736
00:56:06,657 --> 00:56:10,865
And then I was accused once by my sister feminists at a conference

737
00:56:10,949 --> 00:56:13,240
of dyeing it
to attract men.

738
00:56:13,323 --> 00:56:15,365
Really?
Yes.

739
00:56:15,448 --> 00:56:18,740
So I shaved it off,
all of it.

740
00:56:18,824 --> 00:56:21,907
And did he?

741
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:26,448
Did who what?
Fergus love you without your yellow hair?

742
00:56:26,532 --> 00:56:28,907
No.

743
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:31,031
We fought about it.

744
00:56:32,365 --> 00:56:35,615
We drive each other mad.
I don't even like him,

745
00:56:35,699 --> 00:56:38,532
but I can't seem to--
Freud.

746
00:56:38,615 --> 00:56:41,031
"On the other side of attraction
lies repulsion."

747
00:56:42,407 --> 00:56:44,532
Or was that Calvin Klein?

748
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:54,115
- Do you believe that?
- Uh, I wouldn't know.

749
00:56:54,198 --> 00:56:56,073
I don't really
allow myself to do

750
00:56:56,156 --> 00:56:59,240
that Ash/Christabel
grand passion kind of thing.

751
00:56:59,323 --> 00:57:01,115
Allow?
Yeah.

752
00:57:01,198 --> 00:57:05,573
Jealousy, obsession,
all that. Not anymore.

753
00:57:05,657 --> 00:57:08,990
You're lucky then.

754
00:57:09,073 --> 00:57:13,156
It all gets so--
just such a tangle.

755
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:16,365
It's a tangle
most people want.

756
00:57:18,031 --> 00:57:19,782
Not me though.

757
00:57:19,865 --> 00:57:24,198
My antics made a lot
of people unhappy.

758
00:57:25,699 --> 00:57:28,073
One horribly so.

759
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:34,281
For me...

760
00:57:35,907 --> 00:57:40,657
whenever I feel
anything for anyone, I--

761
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:44,657
I go cold all over.

762
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:49,198
- What makes you do that?
- Fear, I suppose.

763
00:57:49,281 --> 00:57:54,281
Fear of being burned up...
by love.

764
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:58,490
Listen to us.

765
00:57:58,573 --> 00:58:04,281
Yes. Aren't we just maudlin?

766
00:58:05,281 --> 00:58:07,657
Maud, you should
let your hair out.

767
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:10,573
You should let it breathe.
And don't do the ice thing,

768
00:58:10,657 --> 00:58:13,198
'cause you have nothing
to worry about from me.

769
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:16,990
Christabel said,
"Fear all men."

770
00:58:17,073 --> 00:58:20,740
Well, Christabel
didn't know me.

771
00:58:22,198 --> 00:58:24,573
I don't want to take
anything from you.

772
00:58:26,323 --> 00:58:30,865
So, then, we're both...
perfectly safe.

773
00:58:30,949 --> 00:58:33,281
Right.

774
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:24,365
How can we bear it?

775
00:59:24,448 --> 00:59:27,657
Every day
we will have less.

776
00:59:34,824 --> 00:59:37,573
Would you rather
have had nothing?

777
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,407
No.

778
00:59:39,490 --> 00:59:44,073
I thank God that if there had to be a dragon it was you.

779
01:00:32,573 --> 01:00:35,448
Wait. Wait.

780
01:00:42,323 --> 01:00:46,990
No. I was just trying to get out from under the covers.
No. No.

781
01:00:47,073 --> 01:00:50,949
This is-- We shouldn't be doing this.
It's dangerous.

782
01:00:53,407 --> 01:00:56,990
Well, I really-- No, because I like you.
I like you a lot.

783
01:00:57,073 --> 01:01:01,532
I just don't want
to blow it here, and--

784
01:01:01,615 --> 01:01:04,031
Well, it doesn't matter
to me, honestly.

785
01:01:04,115 --> 01:01:06,615
What do you mean
it doesn't matter?

786
01:01:13,573 --> 01:01:17,532
Sorry. I think
we're probably just--

787
01:01:17,615 --> 01:01:21,115
In these cramped quarters.
It was a mistake.

788
01:01:23,281 --> 01:01:26,699
Maud. Maud!

789
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,573
I didn't mean that.

790
01:02:02,323 --> 01:02:05,532
Let's not beat
the thing dead.

791
01:02:05,615 --> 01:02:08,740
It happened, it's over,
and we're adults.

792
01:02:08,824 --> 01:02:11,448
Speak for yourself.

793
01:02:11,532 --> 01:02:15,865
I can't imagine what you're like after you actually sleep with someone.

794
01:02:20,073 --> 01:02:25,407
Maud, I think
that you are very--

795
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:27,907
You know?

796
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:30,365
No, I don't know.

797
01:02:33,031 --> 01:02:36,365
So, what, we're friends
now, is that it?

798
01:02:38,865 --> 01:02:41,949
Yeah. That's a lot.

799
01:02:42,031 --> 01:02:43,949
No, I agree.
It's fine.

800
01:02:44,031 --> 01:02:48,824
Yeah. It's perfect.

801
01:02:48,907 --> 01:02:52,615
Anyway, we're getting
off the track here.

802
01:02:52,699 --> 01:02:56,115
We came to investigate
them, not us.

803
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:12,824
So, what ever happened to Blanche?
Blanche drowned.

804
01:03:12,907 --> 01:03:14,740
Oh.

805
01:03:16,073 --> 01:03:19,323
Where was Christabel?
We don't know where she was.

806
01:03:19,407 --> 01:03:21,657
The year before's
a bit blank too.

807
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:24,490
You don't know where she was
that entire year?

808
01:03:24,573 --> 01:03:27,323
There's some speculation
that she went to France,

809
01:03:27,407 --> 01:03:29,907
but I have nothing
to support that.

810
01:03:31,699 --> 01:03:33,949
Okay, so...

811
01:03:34,031 --> 01:03:35,699
Christabel
comes here with Ash

812
01:03:35,782 --> 01:03:39,448
and then disappears,
on paper, at least.

813
01:03:39,532 --> 01:03:43,490
Yes.
And Blanche suicides.

814
01:03:43,573 --> 01:03:46,073
Jesus.

815
01:03:53,573 --> 01:03:56,031
What are you doing?

816
01:03:56,115 --> 01:03:59,323
It's a poem.
I've been writing it as I've watched you.

817
01:03:59,407 --> 01:04:01,240
You're not pleased with it?

818
01:04:01,323 --> 01:04:06,198
On the contrary.
I think it perfectly expresses the joy I have felt with you.

819
01:04:06,281 --> 01:04:08,365
Then why that?

820
01:04:08,448 --> 01:04:11,490
These feelings--
I want them to survive.

821
01:04:11,573 --> 01:04:14,699
I know I can never
declare all this--

822
01:04:14,782 --> 01:04:17,407
this love.

823
01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:22,365
There. I've said it.
I know it cannot be declared to the world.

824
01:04:22,448 --> 01:04:25,532
What I may do is scatter
these words from the train

825
01:04:25,615 --> 01:04:27,907
and hope that
they somehow take root.

826
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:33,031
They will flourish.
I swear it.

827
01:05:22,031 --> 01:05:25,323
So... what next?

828
01:05:25,407 --> 01:05:27,365
I mean, for you.

829
01:05:27,448 --> 01:05:29,740
I suppose I'll check
through the archives

830
01:05:29,824 --> 01:05:32,949
and see if there's any clue at all where
Christabel might have been that year.

831
01:05:33,031 --> 01:05:35,156
Good.

832
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:39,073
I guess I'll just, uh--

833
01:05:39,156 --> 01:05:41,699
hell, I don't know--

834
01:05:41,782 --> 01:05:44,824
go look up shit
on the microfiche.

835
01:05:44,907 --> 01:05:46,949
Suffer over you.

836
01:05:47,031 --> 01:05:49,448
Good-bye.

837
01:05:49,532 --> 01:05:51,657
See ya.

838
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:03,365
Lost your way?
Don't do tours here.

839
01:07:03,448 --> 01:07:05,699
Sir George Bailey?
Who wants to know?

840
01:07:05,782 --> 01:07:08,532
Professor Mortimer Cropper,
curator of the Stan Collection,

841
01:07:08,615 --> 01:07:11,532
Robert De Leon University,
Harmony City, New Mexico.

842
01:07:11,615 --> 01:07:13,573
And this is Dr. Wolfe.
Good morning.

843
01:07:13,657 --> 01:07:16,573
I'm a busy man.
My wife's ill.

844
01:07:16,657 --> 01:07:19,365
I can quite understand
that, sir.

845
01:07:19,448 --> 01:07:22,490
Sources have led me to believe
that you may be in possession

846
01:07:22,573 --> 01:07:27,615
of some documentation
by Randolph Henry Ash.

847
01:07:27,699 --> 01:07:30,240
Whoa.
Don't shoot, please.

848
01:07:30,323 --> 01:07:32,865
Get off my land.

849
01:07:32,949 --> 01:07:35,740
Do you have any idea
what we're talking about here?

850
01:07:35,824 --> 01:07:38,573
Do you? Do you have
any idea how much

851
01:07:38,657 --> 01:07:41,365
such pieces,
if they existed,

852
01:07:41,448 --> 01:07:44,240
how much
they would be worth?

853
01:07:44,323 --> 01:07:46,490
Worth?

854
01:07:54,782 --> 01:07:57,115
Do you mind if we swing
past the university?

855
01:07:57,198 --> 01:07:59,615
Bit of unfinished
business.

856
01:07:59,699 --> 01:08:03,949
Miss Bailey, I presume.
The accomplice.

857
01:08:04,031 --> 01:08:06,156
The very same.

858
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:10,115
Good God, you're
like Bonnie and Clyde.

859
01:08:10,198 --> 01:08:12,448
Come on.
I need a picture of her.

860
01:08:12,532 --> 01:08:15,532
I've never seen you
like this. Just go.

861
01:08:15,615 --> 01:08:19,240
Take the Porsche
and go.

862
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:50,240
Fergus, what?

863
01:08:51,949 --> 01:08:54,156
Uh, if Fergus went out
to get Indian food,

864
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:57,198
I'm gonna--
I'm gonna feel really stupid.

865
01:08:57,281 --> 01:09:00,740
No, he didn't.

866
01:09:00,824 --> 01:09:03,365
India wouldn't be
far enough away, actually.

867
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:09,323
Come inside. I'll explain.

868
01:09:09,407 --> 01:09:13,615
You sure? I mean,
about me coming in.

869
01:09:13,699 --> 01:09:17,323
Yes, very.

870
01:09:17,407 --> 01:09:20,490
So I left Fergus a message
from Seal Court,

871
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:23,573
which apparently
put him on our trail,

872
01:09:23,657 --> 01:09:25,615
and he came here looking
for answers--

873
01:09:25,699 --> 01:09:28,240
he and Cropper
from the sound of it.

874
01:09:28,323 --> 01:09:30,949
So that was Cropper's
car outside?

875
01:09:31,031 --> 01:09:33,198
I think Fergus
has found something.

876
01:09:33,281 --> 01:09:35,699
He's been spooking
around the museum,

877
01:09:35,782 --> 01:09:37,865
sending out
a bunch of faxes.

878
01:09:37,949 --> 01:09:39,949
Ah--

879
01:09:40,031 --> 01:09:44,699
I wouldn't be
so quick to do that.

880
01:09:44,782 --> 01:09:47,323
Yeah.

881
01:09:48,615 --> 01:09:52,657
The British Museum
fax log sheet.

882
01:09:52,740 --> 01:09:55,532
"To University of Nantes
from Fergus Wolfe.

883
01:09:55,615 --> 01:09:59,365
"Subject: Christabel LaMotte.
Information on LaMotte genealogy.

884
01:09:59,448 --> 01:10:03,699
Request loan of journal
of Sabine de Concasse."

885
01:10:03,782 --> 01:10:06,198
Unfortunately for Fergus,
we have to log our faxes.

886
01:10:06,281 --> 01:10:09,365
You're shameless.

887
01:10:20,990 --> 01:10:23,532
So what are we
gonna do now?

888
01:10:23,615 --> 01:10:27,281
We gonna try to beat 'em
to France, or--

889
01:10:30,323 --> 01:10:33,115
or are we just
gonna stare at each other?

890
01:10:33,198 --> 01:10:35,573
That is the question,
isn't it?

891
01:10:35,657 --> 01:10:37,407
Mm-hmm.

892
01:10:37,490 --> 01:10:39,949
I have another one for you.
What's that?

893
01:10:40,031 --> 01:10:42,407
What are you really
doing here?

894
01:10:42,490 --> 01:10:44,115
Well, I, uh--

895
01:10:50,407 --> 01:10:52,490
I needed to see your face.

896
01:10:59,699 --> 01:11:04,490
I just want to let you know that whatever happened in Whitby,

897
01:11:04,573 --> 01:11:08,699
which unfortunately
was not much...

898
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:14,907
It's not because
anything that you did.

899
01:11:17,031 --> 01:11:19,031
Not at all.

900
01:11:21,615 --> 01:11:24,657
I just didn't want
to jump into something.

901
01:11:25,699 --> 01:11:30,740
I mean, I did
and I do... want to.

902
01:11:32,031 --> 01:11:34,073
Badly.

903
01:11:37,448 --> 01:11:40,740
I just didn't
want to mess this up.

904
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:47,198
And I just want to see--

905
01:11:47,281 --> 01:11:53,031
I want to see if there's
an us in you and me.

906
01:11:57,907 --> 01:12:00,573
Would-Would you like that?

907
01:12:10,115 --> 01:12:12,657
I'll take that
as a yes.

908
01:12:41,782 --> 01:12:46,699
Ah, oui. Excusez-moi.
Nous sommes confrères.

909
01:12:46,782 --> 01:12:48,824
When will she be back?

910
01:12:50,156 --> 01:12:52,156
Could you check for us?

911
01:13:19,532 --> 01:13:22,407
- She will return on Thursday.
- Okay.

912
01:13:22,490 --> 01:13:24,240
Au revoir.
Merci.

913
01:13:24,323 --> 01:13:29,532
You and your shoplifting, huh?
I can't take you anywhere.

914
01:13:42,824 --> 01:13:47,824
"Dear Professor Wolfe: Since I wrote to you last,
I've made another discovery.

915
01:13:47,907 --> 01:13:50,281
"Amongst Sabine's papers
was her journal

916
01:13:50,365 --> 01:13:54,365
"in which she writes about LaMotte's visit to Brittany in 1859

917
01:13:54,448 --> 01:13:58,073
and the subsequent arrival
of a mysterious visitor."

918
01:15:02,657 --> 01:15:07,949
I know how things are.
I wish to help you.

919
01:15:08,031 --> 01:15:10,865
You know how things are, do you?
Tell me, Cousin Sabine,

920
01:15:10,949 --> 01:15:14,365
how do you think
things are with me?

921
01:15:14,448 --> 01:15:16,407
I'm a grown woman.
You are a girl.

922
01:15:16,490 --> 01:15:19,115
I do not desire
any help from you.

923
01:15:27,323 --> 01:15:30,824
Christabel's condition
became worse

924
01:15:30,907 --> 01:15:33,407
after she received word
from London

925
01:15:33,490 --> 01:15:37,156
that her close friend
had died.

926
01:16:11,532 --> 01:16:14,240
She left England
because she was pregnant,

927
01:16:14,323 --> 01:16:17,657
and Blanche
committed suicide.

928
01:16:23,365 --> 01:16:25,448
What happened to the baby?

929
01:16:25,532 --> 01:16:27,949
It must have been stillborn.

930
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:29,949
Or died.

931
01:16:30,031 --> 01:16:32,407
Maybe it was taken in
by nuns or a local family.

932
01:16:32,490 --> 01:16:35,657
And brought up here.

933
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:39,782
I'd like to think that,
but I wonder.

934
01:16:39,865 --> 01:16:43,949
- You wonder what?
- I don't know. I just--

935
01:16:44,031 --> 01:16:50,115
She comes here alone, hears
that Blanche has killed herself.

936
01:16:50,198 --> 01:16:52,490
She's pregnant, distraught.

937
01:16:54,532 --> 01:16:56,240
Geez.

938
01:16:56,323 --> 01:16:59,824
I mean, I've no
evidence for it.

939
01:16:59,907 --> 01:17:02,782
Can you imagine
how she must have felt?

940
01:17:04,115 --> 01:17:06,865
Yes, I can.

941
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:21,323
So when do we see
Christabel next?

942
01:17:21,407 --> 01:17:25,740
Autumn, 1860,
in her references to the Vestal Lights.

943
01:17:25,824 --> 01:17:29,824
It was a group of women who used to
meet with mediums on a regular basis.

944
01:17:29,907 --> 01:17:34,156
Really? You know,
Ash hated spiritualists. Pretty openly.

945
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:37,156
You think that's a connection worth tracking down?

946
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:39,281
I don't know.

947
01:17:48,490 --> 01:17:52,323
Please, make a circle
with your hands.

948
01:17:57,782 --> 01:17:59,782
Close your eyes.

949
01:18:05,115 --> 01:18:08,365
White earth. Valley.

950
01:18:08,448 --> 01:18:11,657
A waterfall.

951
01:18:11,740 --> 01:18:14,949
A child. Love.

952
01:18:15,031 --> 01:18:19,490
Two people. Deception.

953
01:18:19,573 --> 01:18:24,240
Letters. Two people.

954
01:18:25,657 --> 01:18:29,031
Words. Death.

955
01:18:29,115 --> 01:18:31,740
What have you done?

956
01:18:31,824 --> 01:18:34,532
A field.

957
01:18:34,615 --> 01:18:36,490
Where is the child?

958
01:18:42,699 --> 01:18:46,657
What have you done
with the child?

959
01:18:46,740 --> 01:18:50,198
You have made
a murderess of me.

960
01:18:57,615 --> 01:19:00,615
"I understood at the time
that Mr. Ash was inquiring

961
01:19:00,699 --> 01:19:03,240
"after the spirit of
a departed child of his own,

962
01:19:03,323 --> 01:19:07,156
"but I am told that
this could not be the case

963
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:10,365
as Mr. Ash is childless."

964
01:19:14,865 --> 01:19:20,156
Was there any mention
of Heloise in your research?

965
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:24,156
I don't know...
nor do I care.

966
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:28,573
Look, I've got to get back.

967
01:19:28,657 --> 01:19:33,782
What's going on? Nothing.
I'm just tired, that's all, so I should--

968
01:19:33,865 --> 01:19:36,323
Come on.
What's wrong, seriously?

969
01:19:37,824 --> 01:19:41,407
I don't actually want to discover anything else about them.

970
01:19:41,490 --> 01:19:44,156
You know?

971
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:47,490
I'm finding things out
that are just--

972
01:19:47,573 --> 01:19:51,657
It's horrible when you think about it really-- men and women together.

973
01:19:54,073 --> 01:19:56,782
She gave up her life,
didn't she?

974
01:19:56,865 --> 01:20:00,490
A perfectly decent life that I've always admired.
And for what? For nothing.

975
01:20:00,573 --> 01:20:02,990
No. Not nothing.

976
01:20:03,073 --> 01:20:08,323
Oh, really? For what then? A child who died,
a lover drowned, and to what end?

977
01:20:08,407 --> 01:20:12,156
She and Ash,
my own parents

978
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:15,490
and every relationship
I've ever had--

979
01:20:15,573 --> 01:20:18,657
It's all doomed.
We can't seem to help

980
01:20:18,740 --> 01:20:20,615
but just tear
each other apart.

981
01:20:20,699 --> 01:20:25,115
Well, what about us?
You didn't include us. What about that?

982
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:28,240
Look, I--

983
01:20:29,699 --> 01:20:32,323
I can't think about
anything right now.

984
01:20:35,281 --> 01:20:37,031
So, okay.

985
01:20:37,115 --> 01:20:40,448
So this is the,
uh-- this is the icy pull-back part then, huh?

986
01:20:40,532 --> 01:20:44,740
- What?
- You know, you get close, you pull away, you get--

987
01:20:44,824 --> 01:20:47,031
I mean, this is part
of the pattern, right?

988
01:20:47,115 --> 01:20:51,657
- What are you talking about?
- Your fear of men mantra from Yorkshire.

989
01:20:51,740 --> 01:20:53,073
That's what
I'm talking about.

990
01:20:53,156 --> 01:20:55,073
No, I get it.
It's cool.

991
01:20:55,156 --> 01:20:57,532
That's the way
you play it.

992
01:20:57,615 --> 01:21:00,031
Do you honestly
believe that?

993
01:21:00,115 --> 01:21:05,573
Is that what you think
this is to me? A game? Is it?

994
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:11,907
Well, finally, then,
all this talk of us

995
01:21:11,990 --> 01:21:13,740
really comes to nothing,
doesn't it?

996
01:21:13,824 --> 01:21:16,865
Yes, I guess you're right.
It's nothing.

997
01:21:53,865 --> 01:21:56,782
Dear Professor Blackadder:

998
01:21:56,865 --> 01:22:00,365
I did try to tell you
about my discovery before

999
01:22:00,448 --> 01:22:03,323
but found that I couldn't.

1000
01:22:03,407 --> 01:22:06,949
Please read these two letters,

1001
01:22:07,031 --> 01:22:10,448
and you will begin
to understand.

1002
01:22:10,532 --> 01:22:14,115
I'm sorry for deceiving you.

1003
01:22:14,198 --> 01:22:17,865
Sincerely, Roland Michell.

1004
01:22:33,699 --> 01:22:38,156
And it's well documented that Ellen Ash set a box on Ash's coffin--

1005
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:40,156
a kind of sealed container.

1006
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:42,198
We'd always imagined
it was just trinkets,

1007
01:22:42,281 --> 01:22:44,365
but in the light
of Michell's discovery,

1008
01:22:44,448 --> 01:22:46,323
who knows what treasures
might be buried there.

1009
01:22:46,407 --> 01:22:49,240
That box is mine, isn't it?
It's my property.

1010
01:22:49,323 --> 01:22:52,156
Once you get it from Lord Ash,
it's absolutely yours.

1011
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:54,532
Until then,
we keep it a secret.

1012
01:22:54,615 --> 01:22:57,407
Any discovery amongst
Lord Ash's things,

1013
01:22:57,490 --> 01:23:01,323
and, uh--
and I purchase it from you.

1014
01:23:01,407 --> 01:23:04,281
It's all above board,
no one the wiser.

1015
01:23:04,365 --> 01:23:06,615
Cropper, are you
absolutely sure of that?

1016
01:23:06,699 --> 01:23:09,115
Listen.
Uh, where is it?

1017
01:23:09,198 --> 01:23:11,365
Yeah. "I place this
letter in his hands,

1018
01:23:11,448 --> 01:23:13,699
"and if ghouls
dig it up again,

1019
01:23:13,782 --> 01:23:17,448
then perhaps justice will be done when I am not here to see it."

1020
01:23:26,782 --> 01:23:32,532
We are older now
and my fires at last are out.

1021
01:23:32,615 --> 01:23:36,365
I know that you are
more than aware of my name,

1022
01:23:36,448 --> 01:23:40,115
but I find you must see it
in print one last time.

1023
01:23:40,198 --> 01:23:44,699
It has been made known to me that your husband is near to death,

1024
01:23:44,782 --> 01:23:49,532
so I have writ down,
for his eyes only, some things.

1025
01:23:49,615 --> 01:23:54,782
I find I cannot say what things
and have sealed the letter.

1026
01:23:54,865 --> 01:23:59,240
If you wish to read it,
it is in your hands,

1027
01:23:59,323 --> 01:24:03,490
though I must hope that he
will see it first and decide.

1028
01:24:03,573 --> 01:24:09,115
I have done great harm,
though I meant none to you.

1029
01:25:03,198 --> 01:25:06,907
I'll see they get back,
no questions asked.

1030
01:25:08,448 --> 01:25:11,115
You're more enterprising
than I gave you credit for.

1031
01:25:11,198 --> 01:25:13,281
Was there a compliment
in there somewhere?

1032
01:25:13,365 --> 01:25:16,699
Hmm? Yes, probably.

1033
01:25:18,699 --> 01:25:22,573
What I can't believe is Fergus Wolfe conniving with Cropper.

1034
01:25:22,657 --> 01:25:24,740
I thought I was
a better judge of men.

1035
01:25:24,824 --> 01:25:26,490
Well, see, that's
where you went wrong.

1036
01:25:26,573 --> 01:25:28,657
You gave him credit
for being one.

1037
01:25:31,532 --> 01:25:34,365
Thank you.

1038
01:25:37,782 --> 01:25:40,198
Hi.
Hi.

1039
01:25:40,281 --> 01:25:42,949
Thank you for coming.
Sure.

1040
01:25:43,031 --> 01:25:47,156
I believe
that may be her.

1041
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:50,365
I, uh-- I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry.

1042
01:25:50,448 --> 01:25:54,115
No, listen. I lost it totally.
It wasn't you.

1043
01:25:54,198 --> 01:25:58,490
So, why don't we all
talk some strategy?

1044
01:25:58,573 --> 01:26:01,281
Let me introduce you to,
uh-- All right.

1045
01:26:01,365 --> 01:26:05,699
Professor Blackadder, Paola,
this is Dr. Bailey.

1046
01:26:05,782 --> 01:26:08,365
Maud.
Maud.

1047
01:26:08,448 --> 01:26:10,490
How do you do?

1048
01:26:10,573 --> 01:26:15,782
So, do we really think that Cropper's capable of something like this,
of robbing a grave?

1049
01:26:20,990 --> 01:26:24,281
It's creepy, the idea
of opening a grave.

1050
01:26:24,365 --> 01:26:26,198
Let's just keep going.

1051
01:26:26,281 --> 01:26:29,407
Jesus.

1052
01:26:29,490 --> 01:26:33,156
The moping owl does to the moon complain.
Complain.

1053
01:26:35,448 --> 01:26:37,782
Are you ready?

1054
01:26:37,865 --> 01:26:41,073
Yeah.
Hold the light up.

1055
01:26:57,824 --> 01:27:00,740
Fergus! Fergus!
Is that it?

1056
01:27:00,824 --> 01:27:04,115
Yes. It's gotta be.

1057
01:27:04,198 --> 01:27:07,824
I found it, Fergus.
I found it.

1058
01:27:14,573 --> 01:27:19,365
Oh, my God.
I found it, Fergus.

1059
01:27:19,448 --> 01:27:21,365
Great!

1060
01:27:22,824 --> 01:27:25,949
Hey, Cropper!
Cropper!

1061
01:27:31,990 --> 01:27:34,907
This has nothing
to do with you people.

1062
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:46,990
Wait! Get off of me!
Get off of me!

1063
01:27:47,073 --> 01:27:49,907
No you don't!

1064
01:27:49,990 --> 01:27:53,115
Traitor!
Bloody conniver! Please!

1065
01:27:56,865 --> 01:27:58,657
Wait!

1066
01:28:00,198 --> 01:28:04,115
What are you doin'?

1067
01:28:18,907 --> 01:28:22,782
Oh, shit.

1068
01:28:26,407 --> 01:28:28,907
Are you sure
we should be doing this?

1069
01:28:28,990 --> 01:28:31,490
I told Blackadder
we'd just take a look

1070
01:28:31,573 --> 01:28:34,323
before we handed it over
to the museum.

1071
01:28:34,407 --> 01:28:36,949
Can you hold that there?

1072
01:28:53,990 --> 01:28:56,657
Maud, look at this.

1073
01:29:12,281 --> 01:29:14,657
It's her handwriting.

1074
01:29:42,990 --> 01:29:46,281
"My dear, my dear:

1075
01:29:46,365 --> 01:29:48,573
"They tell me
you are very ill.

1076
01:29:48,657 --> 01:29:51,657
"Perhaps I am wrong
to disturb you at this time

1077
01:29:51,740 --> 01:29:55,407
"with unseasonable memories,

1078
01:29:55,490 --> 01:30:01,031
"but I find I have, after all,
a thing which I must tell you.

1079
01:30:02,532 --> 01:30:05,323
"You will say it should have
been told 20 years ago,

1080
01:30:05,407 --> 01:30:08,490
"but I could, or would, not.

1081
01:30:09,824 --> 01:30:12,532
"You have a daughter...

1082
01:30:13,824 --> 01:30:16,490
"who is well and married

1083
01:30:16,573 --> 01:30:19,782
"and the mother
of a beautiful boy.

1084
01:30:19,865 --> 01:30:22,699
"I've sent you a picture.

1085
01:30:27,490 --> 01:30:30,657
"You will see she resembles
both her parents,

1086
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:34,240
"neither of whom she knows
to be her parent.

1087
01:30:34,323 --> 01:30:39,949
"When I said at that terrible séance
that you had made a murderess of me,

1088
01:30:40,031 --> 01:30:45,031
"I was speaking of poor Blanche,
who then torments me daily...

1089
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:49,740
"and I thought,
'Let him think so then...

1090
01:30:49,824 --> 01:30:52,407
"'if he knows me so little.'

1091
01:30:54,323 --> 01:30:56,573
"I had a secret fear, you see.

1092
01:30:56,657 --> 01:30:59,031
"I was afraid that
you would wish to take her--

1093
01:30:59,115 --> 01:31:01,615
"you and your wife--
for your own.

1094
01:31:01,699 --> 01:31:04,156
But I could not let her go."

1095
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:06,657
Over here.

1096
01:31:06,740 --> 01:31:09,532
And so I hid her from you

1097
01:31:09,615 --> 01:31:12,073
and you from her.

1098
01:31:13,407 --> 01:31:17,073
She loves her adoptive
parents most deeply.

1099
01:31:17,156 --> 01:31:19,490
Me, she does not love.

1100
01:31:19,573 --> 01:31:24,990
So I am punished now,
living at Seal Court with them and watching her grow.

1101
01:31:25,073 --> 01:31:28,365
I have been angry
for so long

1102
01:31:28,448 --> 01:31:30,573
with all of us,

1103
01:31:30,657 --> 01:31:32,865
and now, near the end,

1104
01:31:32,949 --> 01:31:36,657
I think of you again
with clear love.

1105
01:31:36,740 --> 01:31:39,657
Did we not--

1106
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:44,031
Did you not flame
and I catch fire?

1107
01:31:44,115 --> 01:31:47,407
Was not the love
that we found

1108
01:31:47,490 --> 01:31:50,240
worth the tempest
that it brewed?

1109
01:31:50,323 --> 01:31:53,990
I feel it was.
I know it was.

1110
01:31:54,073 --> 01:31:58,907
"If you are able or willing,
please send me a sign that you have read this.

1111
01:31:58,990 --> 01:32:03,615
"I dare not ask
if you forgive.

1112
01:32:04,657 --> 01:32:06,949
Christabel LaMotte."

1113
01:32:10,115 --> 01:32:12,990
Ash had never read this.

1114
01:32:13,073 --> 01:32:15,865
He never knew
he had a child.

1115
01:32:15,949 --> 01:32:19,699
You're descended from both
Christabel and Ash.

1116
01:32:21,949 --> 01:32:25,740
My God.

1117
01:32:25,824 --> 01:32:31,657
All these clues,
they're for you.

1118
01:32:33,532 --> 01:32:35,657
For us.

1119
01:32:49,115 --> 01:32:51,156
You're so beautiful.

1120
01:33:21,198 --> 01:33:26,615
There are things that happen,
not spoken or written of.

1121
01:33:26,699 --> 01:33:29,448
A poet walked out
one summer's day

1122
01:33:29,532 --> 01:33:33,073
seeking forgiveness
from a love long lost.

1123
01:33:34,448 --> 01:33:37,323
He found
something else instead.

1124
01:33:38,699 --> 01:33:41,532
This is how it was.

1125
01:33:49,740 --> 01:33:52,865
Morning.
Good morning.

1126
01:33:52,949 --> 01:33:54,699
What's your name?

1127
01:33:54,782 --> 01:33:59,281
May Bailey, but I have
another name I don't like.

1128
01:33:59,365 --> 01:34:04,448
Do you? What's that?

1129
01:34:04,532 --> 01:34:06,907
Maya Thomason Bailey.

1130
01:34:12,407 --> 01:34:14,407
Well...

1131
01:34:16,657 --> 01:34:20,490
Maya was the, uh--

1132
01:34:20,573 --> 01:34:23,156
the mother of Hermes,

1133
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:25,615
and I know a waterfall
called Thomason.

1134
01:34:25,699 --> 01:34:28,949
A waterfall? Really?
Yes.

1135
01:34:29,031 --> 01:34:34,615
In Yorkshire.
With a lovely cave hidden behind it.

1136
01:34:36,699 --> 01:34:38,532
Where do you live?

1137
01:34:38,615 --> 01:34:40,532
I live in that house
down there.

1138
01:34:40,615 --> 01:34:44,365
And my mother lives there
and my father

1139
01:34:44,448 --> 01:34:46,448
and my two brothers.

1140
01:34:46,532 --> 01:34:49,281
Oh, and my Aunt Christabel too.

1141
01:34:50,949 --> 01:34:53,740
Yes, I think
I know your mother.

1142
01:34:57,323 --> 01:34:59,532
You have
the true look of her.

1143
01:34:59,615 --> 01:35:04,949
No one else says that.
I think I look like my father.

1144
01:35:06,824 --> 01:35:09,490
You look like
your father too.

1145
01:35:12,073 --> 01:35:14,407
Can you make daisy chains?

1146
01:35:14,490 --> 01:35:17,323
Yes.

1147
01:35:20,156 --> 01:35:23,156
Yes, I'll make you a crown.

1148
01:35:24,824 --> 01:35:29,824
But, um... will you
give me a lock of your hair?

1149
01:35:31,573 --> 01:35:34,323
Like fairy story.

1150
01:35:36,031 --> 01:35:38,323
Just so.

1151
01:35:49,365 --> 01:35:53,281
Now, would you
take this note...

1152
01:35:53,365 --> 01:35:55,740
to your aunt.

1153
01:35:57,240 --> 01:36:00,156
Tell her that
you saw a poet

1154
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:02,657
who was coming
to meet her

1155
01:36:02,740 --> 01:36:04,990
but met you instead.

1156
01:36:05,073 --> 01:36:07,198
I'll try to remember.

1157
01:36:08,990 --> 01:36:11,031
Thank you.
