1
00:00:55,467 --> 00:00:57,733
>> Hi, Emily.

2
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,300
Didn't need to be like this,

3
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,200
did it?

4
00:01:17,933 --> 00:01:20,100
[sighs]

5
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,933
Emily Gray.

6
00:01:23,933 --> 00:01:26,567
First class honors, high school.

7
00:01:26,567 --> 00:01:30,133
Graduated, Vancouver.

8
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:31,767
Everything seems to have gone

9
00:01:31,767 --> 00:01:34,067
on pretty swimmingly until 1995.

10
00:01:34,067 --> 00:01:41,400
Then 1996 comes along and...wow!

11
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,733
You tried to drown a little boy

12
00:01:43,733 --> 00:01:45,700
in the lake...

13
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,833
out of the blue.

14
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:49,333
You served five years for that.

15
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,067
You're out for only one, and

16
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:56,600
then this mess.

17
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,667
You want to tell me what's

18
00:01:57,667 --> 00:01:58,533
going on?

19
00:01:58,533 --> 00:01:59,633
I mean, you do, right?

20
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:04,300
That's...why you confessed.

21
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,700
I'm all ears, Emily.

22
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,733
You got something worth saying,

23
00:02:06,733 --> 00:02:09,267
let's hear it.

24
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:13,533
What...the hell...happened?

25
00:02:25,367 --> 00:02:27,233
>> What if I told you that I

26
00:02:27,233 --> 00:02:29,600
knew the meaning of life?

27
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,067
>> [eerie music]

28
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,133
>> The thing you have to

29
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:35,933
understand is...either

30
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:38,100
everything has meaning or

31
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,633
nothing does.

32
00:03:41,633 --> 00:03:43,333
Look around.

33
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:46,433
Life is just an accident, man.

34
00:03:46,433 --> 00:03:47,833
Random collision of particles

35
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,267
in space.

36
00:03:50,267 --> 00:03:52,567
Any meaning it has, is only one

37
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:56,867
we've given it ourselves.

38
00:03:56,867 --> 00:04:00,067
Just like a riddle.

39
00:04:00,067 --> 00:04:01,067
What do the poor have that the

40
00:04:01,067 --> 00:04:06,067
rich want and God fears?

41
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:09,400
Like death or love or God, the

42
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,333
answer to the riddle all

43
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,067
depends on how you look at

44
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:12,567
things.

45
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:18,933
What the poor have, that the

48
00:04:30,067 --> 00:04:33,067
>> Nothing.

49
00:04:33,067 --> 00:04:36,333
That is so for real.

50
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,267
It's...it's

51
00:04:37,267 --> 00:04:38,233
like everything is just one big

52
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:40,400

53

135
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:45,733
really touched me, you know.

136
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:46,800
And I thought that maybe you

137
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,200
and I could go out sometime and

138
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,133

But at least I'm not the one

171
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:52,367

172
00:12:52,367 --> 00:12:53,933
around with me all the time.

173
00:12:53,933 --> 00:12:55,100
Hmm?

174
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,533
You got a secret, Novak.

175
00:12:56,533 --> 00:12:57,333
The whole school practically

176
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:58,233

00:12:58,233 --> 00:12:59,067

00:12:59,067 --> 00:13:00,067

00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:01,167
a closet nymphomaniac?

180
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:04,333
>> Oh...ah!

181
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,800
Twice a week you drive a car to

182
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,467

then back the next morning.

185
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,800

188
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:21,900
I guess, uh, little miss angel

189
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,933
isn't such an angel after all.

190
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:27,867
So come on, tell me, where do

191
00:13:27,867 --> 00:13:30,600

196
00:15:26,267 --> 00:15:28,367
As most of you know the lousy

197
00:15:28,367 --> 00:15:29,767
bastards that pay our minimum

198
00:15:29,767 --> 00:15:31,067
wage have sprung for the

199
00:15:31,067 --> 00:15:33,267
proceedings this evening--their

200
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:34,733
way of saying thanks for doing

201
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,667
a good job.

202
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:39,367
Lads, keep fooling them.

203
00:15:39,367 --> 00:15:41,433
>> [applause]

204
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,667

205
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:06,933
>> Did you manage to fit an

206
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:08,100
entire security system in here

207
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,067
this time or maybe just a

208
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:10,167
shotgun?

209
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:11,567
>> Look and see.

210
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:12,400
>> You know I took the revolver

211
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,267
back.

212
00:16:13,267 --> 00:16:14,100
There's no way I'd ever use

213
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:14,967
that thing.

214
00:16:14,967 --> 00:16:15,733
>> It's your birthday.

215
00:16:15,733 --> 00:16:19,500
Will you get on with it?

216
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,467
>> [laughs]

217
00:16:22,467 --> 00:16:23,300
Dad!

218
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,600
It's beautiful.

219
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,800
>> [laughs]

220
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,967
As a police officer I can tell

221
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:29,300
you mace is effective up to six

222
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:35,100
feet away.

223
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,467
How the hell's my girl doing

224
00:16:36,467 --> 00:16:37,367
anyway?

225
00:16:37,367 --> 00:16:39,267
Are you doing okay?

226
00:16:39,267 --> 00:16:40,567
>> The usual I guess.

227
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:42,067
Studying a lot.

228
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,800
>> Are you going out, seeing

229
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,500
people?

230
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,433
>> Mmhm hmm.

231
00:16:48,433 --> 00:16:51,667
>> You know, Sara, when all

232
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:52,633
your friends went away to

233
00:16:52,633 --> 00:16:54,067
University and you decided to

234
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:55,167
enroll here I thought, well,

235
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:58,533
maybe it was for the best.

236
00:16:58,533 --> 00:16:59,467
After all you've been through

237
00:16:59,467 --> 00:17:00,900
it will give you some

238
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,533
continuity and your grades

239
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:06,067
start to slip and I thought,

240
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,333
well, it's natural.

241
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,733
But to just sit at home and

242
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:12,633
watch the world slip by...

243
00:17:12,633 --> 00:17:13,967
>> Dad...

244
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:18,500
>> You have got so much...

245
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:24,267
>> A man is running late for

246
00:17:24,267 --> 00:17:26,700
work one day.

247
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,667
In his rush he forgets to grab

248
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:30,433
his umbrella and his raincoat

249
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:31,933
but he still manages not to get

250
00:17:31,933 --> 00:17:35,200
wet.

251
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,233
How?

252
00:17:41,267 --> 00:17:43,733
Because it never rained.

253
00:17:43,733 --> 00:17:46,700
>> Ah.

254
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,133
I'm assuming you have a point.

255
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:50,167
>> You always want me to be so

256
00:17:50,167 --> 00:17:52,500
prepared against failure,

257
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,167
burglary.

258
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:57,200
You have to let me live my life

259
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,233
though, find my own answers.

260
00:18:02,233 --> 00:18:03,167
>> So, while you're looking you

261
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:04,733
can come over tomorrow night

262
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:06,067
and see me and Lea...

263
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:06,933
>> [laughs]

264
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:08,067
>> We could go to the movies...

265
00:18:08,067 --> 00:18:09,067
>> Get real cozy and play happy

266
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:09,867
family?

267
00:18:09,867 --> 00:18:10,833
Thanks, but I'll pass.

268
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:11,667
>> JEFF: Sara...

269
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:12,467
>> I don't need a replacement

270
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:13,300
caregiver, Dad.

271
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,167
You married her.

272
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:16,233
Not me.

273
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:22,433
I've got an early start

274
00:18:22,433 --> 00:18:23,433
tomorrow.

275
00:18:23,433 --> 00:18:24,167
I should just go.

276
00:18:24,167 --> 00:18:30,200
>> Sara...your real present.

277
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:38,567
>> Is this mom's?

278
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:40,900
>> Yeah.

279
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,867
It's good to look for answers.

280
00:18:47,867 --> 00:18:48,800
Sometimes, if you look too

281
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,167
hard, you lose the ones you

282
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:55,600
already have.

283
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,233
>> I'm okay.

284
00:19:05,767 --> 00:19:06,800
>> PROFESSOR: The curse of

285
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,933
human consciousness is that it

286
00:19:07,933 --> 00:19:09,200
longs to know only that which

287
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,267
is unknowable.

288
00:19:13,267 --> 00:19:16,600
For all our philosophizing, can

289
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,500
the meaning of life ever truly

290
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:23,233
be understood?

291
00:19:23,233 --> 00:19:25,100
With exams only two weeks away,

292
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,300
let us hope, for your sakes,

293
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,900
that at least some of it can.

294
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:10,067
>> [sighs]

295
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,533
>> Look, Curran, it's not going

296
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:24,500
to happen, okay?

297
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,167
Not here, not on a plane, not

298
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:29,600
in a train.

299
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,067
>> [laughs]

300
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:43,867
I have my secrets, too.

301
00:20:46,933 --> 00:20:48,900
[laughing]

302
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,800
>> You ever hear stories on TV

303
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,733
sometimes that don't make any

304
00:21:01,733 --> 00:21:03,767
sense?

305
00:21:03,767 --> 00:21:04,833
Maybe a train derails for no

306
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,400
reason or an unexplained fire

307
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,667
breaks out somewhere, you know,

308
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:14,100
a mystery.

309
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,200
A few years ago police found

310
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,300
out about this invitation

311
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,400
that's been sent around.

312
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,300
Some people got it in their

313
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,567
mail or on their computer, even

314
00:21:23,567 --> 00:21:24,600
painted on the side of their

315
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,067
house.

316
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:28,633
The invitation was a riddle.

317
00:21:28,633 --> 00:21:31,700
>> What do you mean?

318
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,067
>> All I know is the answer led

319
00:21:33,067 --> 00:21:34,100
you to an abandoned building

320
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,567
somewhere in the City.

321
00:21:35,567 --> 00:21:36,300
If you could work out where it

322
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,067
was, then you became part of a

323
00:21:38,067 --> 00:21:41,767
game and the rules were simple.

324
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:42,567
You begin receiving

325
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:45,700
riddles--anonymous ones.

326
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,933
Once you solve them, all you

327
00:21:46,933 --> 00:21:48,067
had to do was return to the

328
00:21:48,067 --> 00:21:49,067
building and write the answer

329
00:21:49,067 --> 00:21:51,600
on the wall.

330
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,500
If you get a certain number of

331
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,567
them right, then one day you'd

332
00:21:53,567 --> 00:21:57,133
be shown "the design."

333
00:21:57,133 --> 00:21:59,533
It's this idea riddle freaks

334
00:21:59,533 --> 00:22:01,333
are into, you know, that all

335
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,067
those unexplainable events out

336
00:22:03,067 --> 00:22:04,067
there that no one can make any

337
00:22:04,067 --> 00:22:05,933
sense out of, they're all just

338
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:06,933
part of one big riddle we don't

339
00:22:06,933 --> 00:22:09,367
understand.

340
00:22:09,367 --> 00:22:11,200
Well, according to the game, if

341
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,800
you played long enough, one day

342
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,633
you get a chance to see the

343
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:17,333
answer to that riddle.

344
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:20,467
This was the calling card of

345
00:22:20,467 --> 00:22:22,433
the game.

346
00:22:22,433 --> 00:22:23,233
Want to tell me where you got

347
00:22:23,233 --> 00:22:24,400
it from?

348
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,200
You really don't want to get

349
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,067
involved.

350
00:22:28,067 --> 00:22:29,667
>> Uh, just a friend.

351
00:22:29,667 --> 00:22:31,567
It was a joke.

352
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:32,667
>> Funny kind of joke.

353
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:33,633
>> Yeah, funny kind of guy,

354
00:22:33,633 --> 00:22:35,667
believe me.

355
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:36,733
So, what happened?

356
00:22:36,733 --> 00:22:37,633
You said the cops found out

357
00:22:37,633 --> 00:22:38,500
about it?

358
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,833
>> Yeah.

359
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:40,900
That woman a few years ago

360
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,767
tried drowning that boy in the

361
00:22:41,767 --> 00:22:44,500
lake--it was all over the news.

00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,067
>> Emily Gray?

363
00:22:46,067 --> 00:22:47,133
>> Yeah.

364
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:48,067
When the cops questioned her

365
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:50,067
about it, all she would say was

366
00:22:50,067 --> 00:22:50,833
that it was part of "the

367
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:52,433
design."

368
00:22:52,433 --> 00:22:53,667
>> You're joking me?

369
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:54,733
>> No.

370
00:22:54,733 --> 00:22:56,200
Your friend's joking, remember?

371
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,267
I'm just hitting on you.

00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:33,900
>> Sara!

579
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:34,700
Sara!

580
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:35,400
You were playing the game.

581
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,167
That's what you were doing

582
00:47:36,167 --> 00:47:37,600
here, right?

583
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,433
And we can't go to the cops.

584
00:47:40,433 --> 00:47:41,367
>> We have to.

585
00:47:41,367 --> 00:47:42,167
>> Someone is setting us up for

586
00:47:42,167 --> 00:47:42,900
this.

587
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:43,900
Do you understand?

588
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:46,667
Do you understand?

589
00:47:46,667 --> 00:47:49,267
Now, get in the truck.

590
00:48:34,267 --> 00:48:37,167
Go home.

591
00:48:37,167 --> 00:48:41,500
We'll meet tomorrow.

592
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,067
Go home.

593
00:48:43,067 --> 00:48:45,233
>> [open door]

594
00:48:47,767 --> 00:48:50,067
>> Go home.

595
00:49:05,467 --> 00:49:07,933

596
00:49:46,667 --> 00:49:50,433

598
00:49:53,567 --> 00:49:55,567
middle of the desert.

599
00:49:55,567 --> 00:49:56,300
All he has with him is an

600
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,733
unopened package.

601
00:49:57,733 --> 00:49:59,067
The unopened package explains

602
00:49:59,067 --> 00:50:02,133
his death.

603
00:50:02,133 --> 00:50:04,667
What's in the package?

604
00:50:04,667 --> 00:50:05,833
>> LEA: What are you mumbling

605
00:50:05,833 --> 00:50:09,100
about in here?

606
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:11,033
>> Nine across.

607
00:50:11,033 --> 00:50:12,200
Unopened package explains the

608
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:15,667
man's death...bing!

609
00:50:15,667 --> 00:50:16,467
Parachute!

610
00:50:16,467 --> 00:50:18,000
>> Oh!

611
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,267
I gotta get to work.

612
00:50:19,267 --> 00:50:20,767
>> Oh, honey, do me a favor,

613
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:23,200
would you, hmm?

614
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,967
Some of Sara's mail came here.

615
00:50:25,967 --> 00:50:27,100
I thought if you return them to

616
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,267
her, it might be a nice excuse

617
00:50:28,267 --> 00:50:31,133
to pop in and say hi.

618
00:50:31,133 --> 00:50:32,867
>> You never give up, do you?

619
00:50:32,867 --> 00:50:33,733
>> Hmm?

620
00:50:33,733 --> 00:50:34,733
>> Oh, for God's sakes, Jeff.

621
00:50:34,733 --> 00:50:36,100
She treats me like a rash.

622
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,500
>> Oh, that's not true, Lea.

623
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,167
>> Isn't it?

624
00:50:39,167 --> 00:50:41,200
>> [doorbell ringing]

625
00:50:54,233 --> 00:50:55,367
>> Tom?

626
00:50:55,367 --> 00:50:57,000
>> Sorry to bother you, boss.

627
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,133
There's been a situation.

628
00:51:09,133 --> 00:51:11,300
>> You lied.

629
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:13,067
>> I've never seen that before.

630
00:51:13,067 --> 00:51:13,833
>> You were playing the game,

631
00:51:13,833 --> 00:51:14,533
Sara.

632
00:51:14,533 --> 00:51:15,433
Don't you think that's close

633
00:51:15,433 --> 00:51:16,733
enough?

634
00:51:16,733 --> 00:51:17,733
Yesterday someone left a nice

635
00:51:17,733 --> 00:51:18,600
little message for me on one of

636
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:19,867
my windows.

637
00:51:19,867 --> 00:51:20,900
At the other end of it all was

638
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:23,567
you...and a corpse.

639
00:51:23,567 --> 00:51:24,467
Now I might be a little slow

640
00:51:24,467 --> 00:51:25,533
here but what the fuck

641
00:51:25,533 --> 00:51:28,400
is going on?

642
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:37,567
>> About six months ago my car

643
00:51:37,567 --> 00:51:39,667
wouldn't start.

644
00:51:39,667 --> 00:51:40,700
I was running late so I caught

645
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:43,400
the subway.

646
00:51:46,767 --> 00:51:49,800
It was just like you said, Vern.

647
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:50,767
Written by the tracks, this

648
00:51:50,767 --> 00:51:52,567
riddle.

649
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:53,733
I didn't know what it was.

650
00:51:53,733 --> 00:51:55,067
I thought maybe it was for me.

651
00:51:55,067 --> 00:51:57,233
So I answered it.

652
00:51:57,233 --> 00:51:58,300
The answer led me to the

653
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:00,167
abandoned building.

654
00:52:00,167 --> 00:52:01,100
When I got there the rest of

655
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:02,133
the game was spray painted on

656
00:52:02,133 --> 00:52:03,667
the floor.

657
00:52:03,667 --> 00:52:05,533
They were easy.

658
00:52:05,533 --> 00:52:06,567
Write your answer to the subway

659
00:52:06,567 --> 00:52:07,367
riddle on the wall of the

660
00:52:07,367 --> 00:52:08,200
building.

661
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,933
That was it.

662
00:52:11,933 --> 00:52:14,900
Then one day, maybe after one

663
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:18,267
riddle--or a hundred--you'd

664
00:52:18,267 --> 00:52:22,700
finally get to see it.

665
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:24,067
The reason behind everything we

666
00:52:24,067 --> 00:52:25,367
don't understand, you would

667
00:52:25,367 --> 00:52:28,900
understand somehow.

668
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:31,367
So, I did it.

669
00:52:31,367 --> 00:52:33,133
I went back to the subway and

670
00:52:33,133 --> 00:52:35,067
they were there and...

671
00:52:35,067 --> 00:52:39,333
>> ...you answered them.

672
00:52:39,333 --> 00:52:40,733
And you had no idea who they

673
00:52:40,733 --> 00:52:42,900
were from.

674
00:52:48,367 --> 00:52:49,933
Real good, Sara.

675
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:52,367
That's real good.

676
00:52:52,367 --> 00:52:53,067
>> I didn't think anything

677
00:52:53,067 --> 00:52:55,067
would happen.

678
00:53:02,733 --> 00:53:03,900
What do we do now?

679
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:06,167
>> We?

680
00:53:06,167 --> 00:53:06,900
Look, I take full

681
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:08,400
responsibility for this, okay?

682
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,200
Really.

683
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,100
I mean, this whole time I was

684
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:11,067
thinking you were just this

685
00:53:11,067 --> 00:53:12,700
chick into her intellectual

686
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:14,467
thing, but, you know, normal.

687
00:53:14,467 --> 00:53:19,800
Turns out you're a psycho.

688
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,633
Oh, spare me the Miss NaÃ¯ve act.

689
00:53:21,633 --> 00:53:24,100
I saw that body, too, remember?

690
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:26,300
>> What?

691
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:27,333
You think I did it?

692
00:53:27,333 --> 00:53:28,467
I found him like that!

693
00:53:28,467 --> 00:53:29,267
>> Oh, yeah, out of the blue,

694
00:53:29,267 --> 00:53:30,133
there he was.

695
00:53:30,133 --> 00:53:31,100
>> I was playing...the game.

696
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:31,967
I was...

697
00:53:31,967 --> 00:53:32,833

00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:34,500
Crawling around in the dark,

700
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,900
you said.

701
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:40,067
What you didn't say was why.

702
00:53:40,067 --> 00:53:41,067
Come on, Sara.

703
00:53:41,067 --> 00:53:42,767
Good-looking educated girl like

704
00:53:42,767 --> 00:53:43,433
you.

705
00:53:43,433 --> 00:53:44,267
I bet the boys are lining up a

706
00:53:44,267 --> 00:53:45,100
mile long for their piece of

707
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,667
white bread.

708
00:53:46,667 --> 00:53:47,500
But you decided to come down

709
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:48,667
here instead.

710
00:53:48,667 --> 00:53:50,167
Slum it with the likes of me.

711
00:53:50,167 --> 00:53:52,067
Play your little mind games.

712
00:53:52,067 --> 00:53:53,433
Well, something doesn't smell

713
00:53:53,433 --> 00:53:54,433
quite right.

714
00:53:54,433 --> 00:53:55,833
Why are you doing this?

715
00:53:55,833 --> 00:53:57,067
Why are you playing this thing?

716
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,067
Why are you playing the game?

717
00:53:58,067 --> 00:54:03,100
>> I was in a car crash, okay?

718
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:04,067
My mother was driving.

719
00:54:04,067 --> 00:54:05,300
It killed her.

720
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,933
I was thrown clear.

721
00:54:07,933 --> 00:54:09,067
There is a reason?

722
00:54:09,067 --> 00:54:09,900
A design?

723
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:10,733
I guess I just wanted to know

724
00:54:10,733 --> 00:54:13,700
what it was.

725
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:14,867
>> Sara, it's just a game.

726
00:54:14,867 --> 00:54:15,600
It's not real.

727
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,167
>> What is a game, Vern?

728
00:54:17,167 --> 00:54:18,133
Something where you have to

729
00:54:18,133 --> 00:54:18,967
give the pieces back once your

730
00:54:18,967 --> 00:54:20,067
time's up.

731
00:54:20,067 --> 00:54:21,600
Well, guess what?

732
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,733
It means it's all a game.

733
00:54:22,733 --> 00:54:23,567
Life, everything, one big

734
00:54:23,567 --> 00:54:25,667

Who's he?

749
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,133
>> Well, you're the one who

750
00:56:08,133 --> 00:56:09,067
knows all about my secrets.

751
00:56:09,067 --> 00:56:11,067
Why don't you tell me?

752
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:12,200
Everyone's got secrets, honey,

753
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,300
remember?

754
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:14,100
>> I don't know what you're

00:56:19,933 --> 00:56:20,733
Now you're going to tell me

760
00:56:20,733 --> 00:56:22,833
about the rest of it.

761
00:56:22,833 --> 00:56:27,800
What's my secret, Marie?

762
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:28,600
>> If you're talking about what

763
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:29,967
Curran said, he told me you

were a stripper, okay?

765
00:56:32,433 --> 00:56:34,467
In another bar around here.

766
00:56:34,467 --> 00:56:35,800
Someone gave him this card,

767
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:39,267
some kind of VIP pass.

>> VERN: Was this it?

769
00:56:40,633 --> 00:56:41,733
>> What are you?

770
00:56:41,733 --> 00:56:43,500
Her pimp or something?

771
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,700
>> Stripper?

772
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:45,967
>> Romeo's girl.

773
00:56:45,967 --> 00:56:46,967
Place used to be a strip bar

774
00:56:46,967 --> 00:56:48,267
before it was abandoned.

775
00:56:48,267 --> 00:56:49,200
So who was the person who gave

776
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,133
him the card?

777
00:56:50,133 --> 00:56:50,967
>> Well, I don't know.

778
00:56:50,967 --> 00:56:52,133
He just said some guy.

779
00:56:52,133 --> 00:56:53,400
>> Just some guy?

780
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,433
Nothing else?

781
00:56:54,433 --> 00:56:55,967
>> All he said is he'd been

782
00:56:55,967 --> 00:56:57,533
given the VIP pass for a club

783
00:56:57,533 --> 00:57:00,400
and some kind of password, "I

784
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,067
never sinned".

785
00:57:03,067 --> 00:57:06,467
You know, you say the password,

786
00:57:06,467 --> 00:57:09,267
you get a special treatment.

787
00:57:09,267 --> 00:57:11,433
>> I never sinned?

788
00:57:11,433 --> 00:57:14,133
>> You heard it before?

789
00:57:22,367 --> 00:57:25,267
>> WOMAN: He was just a little

790
00:57:25,267 --> 00:57:28,500
boy, Dennis Reveni, 12 years

791
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,333
old.

792
00:57:30,333 --> 00:57:31,167
Why did you try to kill

793
00:57:31,167 --> 00:57:33,233
him?

794
00:57:33,233 --> 00:57:35,567
>> [fast forward]

795
00:57:39,733 --> 00:57:43,900
>> When he looks in the mirror,

796
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:51,733
he knows...I never sinned.

797
00:57:51,733 --> 00:57:54,067
>> That's one very mixed up

798
00:57:54,067 --> 00:57:55,500
lady.

799
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:56,433
>> Something happened to her,

800
00:57:56,433 --> 00:57:58,067
Vern.

801
00:57:58,067 --> 00:57:59,800
Straight A's through college, a

802
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,267
good job, a family.

803
00:58:01,267 --> 00:58:02,367
She was playing this thing and

804
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:04,767
she went crazy.

805
00:58:04,767 --> 00:58:05,600
>> Well, let's say something

806
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:06,433
did happen to her.

807
00:58:06,433 --> 00:58:08,533
Some kind of cult thing maybe.

808
00:58:08,533 --> 00:58:09,333
We've got worse things to worry

809
00:58:09,333 --> 00:58:11,100
about here.

810
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:12,433
Someone wanted us to find that

811
00:58:12,433 --> 00:58:15,567
body for a reason.

812
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,433
>> Well...according

813
00:58:19,433 --> 00:58:21,367
to her public access file,

814
00:58:21,367 --> 00:58:22,733
Emily Gray was released from an

815
00:58:22,733 --> 00:58:23,700
asylum for the criminally

816
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,533
insane last year.

817
00:58:25,533 --> 00:58:26,333
They keep her in a halfway

818
00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:31,200
house just outside Toronto now.

819
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:34,533
>> Whatever is happening, it

820
00:58:34,533 --> 00:58:36,733
ain't over.

821
00:58:41,367 --> 00:58:43,400
>> [police radios]

822
00:59:14,233 --> 00:59:15,133
>> [on television]

823
00:59:15,133 --> 00:59:16,067
In breaking news, parts of

824
00:59:16,067 --> 00:59:17,333
Toronto University are being

825
00:59:17,333 --> 00:59:19,167
sealed off today as police

826
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:21,167
investigate a murder.

827
00:59:21,167 --> 00:59:22,100
Known for the attempted

828
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,367
drowning in 1992 of a small

829
00:59:24,367 --> 00:59:26,967
boy, Emily Gray, this morning,

830
00:59:26,967 --> 00:59:28,067
has confessed to killing a

831
00:59:28,067 --> 00:59:29,500
student from the local

832
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:30,733
university.

833
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:31,433
>> MALE REPORTER: Why did you

834
00:59:31,433 --> 00:59:33,067
do it, Emily?

835
00:59:33,067 --> 00:59:34,933
>> It's all part of the design.

836
00:59:34,933 --> 00:59:36,100
>> FEMALE REPORTER: Police are

837
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,467
refusing all comments until a

838
00:59:37,467 --> 00:59:38,633
psychiatric assessment has been

839
00:59:38,633 --> 00:59:41,067
made.

840
01:00:01,767 --> 01:00:03,933
>> Still hasn't said anything?

841
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:05,100
>> Other than her initial

842
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:06,300
statement...no.

843
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:07,133
And, of course, her request to

844
01:00:07,133 --> 01:00:09,100
see you.

845
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:09,900
>> We found the body in the

846
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:11,100
bushes by the library.

847
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:12,033
It had been dragged there from

848
01:00:12,033 --> 01:00:13,867
someplace else.

849
01:00:13,867 --> 01:00:14,533
>> OFFICER: It's been

850
01:00:14,533 --> 01:00:15,933
identified.

851
01:00:15,933 --> 01:00:19,167
The victim is who she claims.

852
01:00:19,167 --> 01:00:21,733
>> JEFF: Jeremy Curran.

853
01:00:21,733 --> 01:00:25,333
It was all part of the design.

854
01:00:25,333 --> 01:00:26,133
>> In other words her wheel's

855
01:00:26,133 --> 01:00:27,367
spinning, but the hamster's

856
01:00:27,367 --> 01:00:28,967
dead.

857
01:00:28,967 --> 01:00:30,633
>> What about her lawyer?

858
01:00:30,633 --> 01:00:31,567
>> Oh, he's given clearance for

859
01:00:31,567 --> 01:00:33,367
you to talk to her.

860
01:00:33,367 --> 01:00:34,233
He thinks maybe she's seen you

861
01:00:34,233 --> 01:00:35,733
on TV before.

862
01:00:35,733 --> 01:00:36,500
Is making some kind of

863
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,267
connection.

864
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:40,433
>> Okay.

865
01:00:40,433 --> 01:00:41,367
Tom, let's get a copy of her

866
01:00:41,367 --> 01:00:42,733
character profile.

867
01:00:42,733 --> 01:00:43,733
Now she phoned it in initially

868
01:00:43,733 --> 01:00:44,600
right?

869
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:45,467
>> Mmhm.

870
01:00:45,467 --> 01:00:46,333
>> Let's get a recording of

871
01:00:46,333 --> 01:00:47,733
that, too.

872
01:00:47,733 --> 01:00:49,033
Damned if I know why she

873
01:00:49,033 --> 01:00:50,200
wants to talk to me, but I

874
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,267
promise you this, she won't ask

875
01:00:52,267 --> 01:00:55,367
twice.

876
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:04,667
>> [police radios]

877
01:01:07,367 --> 01:01:10,433
>> I know what's happening.

878
01:01:16,467 --> 01:01:17,400
Buddhist monks knew it all

879
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,233
along.

880
01:01:19,233 --> 01:01:20,333
What is the sound of one hand

881
01:01:20,333 --> 01:01:21,433
clapping?

882
01:01:21,433 --> 01:01:22,267
Where does the room go once you

883
01:01:22,267 --> 01:01:23,900
leave it?

884
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:24,933
They believed once you opened

885
01:01:24,933 --> 01:01:26,700
yourself up to enigmas, you

886
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:27,633
began to see the world

887
01:01:27,633 --> 01:01:30,500
differently.

888
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:31,267
You know who the figure on this

889
01:01:31,267 --> 01:01:35,433
card is?

890
01:01:35,433 --> 01:01:36,633
Well, neither did I.

891
01:01:36,633 --> 01:01:39,733
So, I did some research.

892
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:49,967
>> VERN: Nemesis.

893
01:01:49,967 --> 01:01:50,900
>> SARA: It's the closest

894
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:51,933
translation they found for his

895
01:01:51,933 --> 01:01:54,367
name.

896
01:01:54,367 --> 01:01:55,467
He was an Indian monk from

897
01:01:55,467 --> 01:01:57,467
around 400 B.C.

898
01:01:57,467 --> 01:01:58,333
He broke away from his

899
01:01:58,333 --> 01:01:59,467
monastery and studied the way

900
01:01:59,467 --> 01:02:03,767
of enigmas.

901
01:02:03,767 --> 01:02:05,067
Two years later, he was

902
01:02:05,067 --> 01:02:08,633
executed for murder.

903
01:02:08,633 --> 01:02:09,600
You want to know how they

904
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,500
caught him?

905
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:15,433
He confessed.

906
01:02:15,433 --> 01:02:18,067
>> Emily Gray.

907
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:19,467
>> Nemesis claimed--just

908
01:02:19,467 --> 01:02:20,533
like all the other mysteries of

909
01:02:20,533 --> 01:02:22,067
life--the

910
01:02:22,067 --> 01:02:23,533
murder and his confession could

911
01:02:23,533 --> 01:02:24,467
be understood through the

912
01:02:24,467 --> 01:02:27,600
contemplation of riddles.

913
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,967
In the years after his death, a

914
01:02:28,967 --> 01:02:29,800
game was developed by his

915
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,367
followers.

916
01:02:31,367 --> 01:02:32,800
The players solved riddles and

917
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:33,833
wrote their answers on the

918
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:36,567
temple of prayer.

919
01:02:36,567 --> 01:02:38,100
When, if they were diligent, it

920
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:39,100
was said they would go to write

921
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:40,500
their answers on the wall, only

922
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:41,700
this time they would find a

923
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:42,733
riddle waiting there

924
01:02:42,733 --> 01:02:46,167
instead--the final enigma.

925
01:02:46,167 --> 01:02:47,533
And if they solved it...

926
01:02:47,533 --> 01:02:51,067
>> ...they would see the design.

927
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:52,067
>> Those that saw the design

928
01:02:52,067 --> 01:02:52,967
would then leave more riddles

929
01:02:52,967 --> 01:02:55,500
for others to follow.

930
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:56,500
>> So Emily Gray tries to drown

931
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:57,967
the boy after she plays the

932
01:02:57,967 --> 01:02:59,900
game.

933
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:01,167
>> If she had drowned the boy,

934
01:03:01,167 --> 01:03:01,833
my guess is she would have

935
01:03:01,833 --> 01:03:04,400
confessed.

936
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,300
>> But she failed.

937
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:06,800
So they lock her up.

938
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,300
When they finally let her out,

939
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:09,600
she tries again.

940
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:10,267
This time she does kill

941
01:03:10,267 --> 01:03:12,500
someone--your friend.

942
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:15,700
And then confesses.

943
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:18,733
>> Just like Nemesis.

944
01:03:25,667 --> 01:03:26,700
>> [sirens wailing]

945
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:27,600
>> Vern, what are you doing?

946
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:28,467
>> What I should have done from

947
01:03:28,467 --> 01:03:29,400
the start.

948
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:30,200
>> What?

949
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:31,267
You mean the police?

950
01:03:31,267 --> 01:03:31,933
First you want to leave them

951
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:32,767
out of it, then when someone

952
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:33,767
confesses you want to get

953
01:03:33,767 --> 01:03:34,933
involved?

954
01:03:34,933 --> 01:03:36,567
>> Sara, if you hadn't noticed,

955
01:03:36,567 --> 01:03:37,567
something's not quite right

956
01:03:37,567 --> 01:03:39,800
here.

957
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:40,833
According to your stripper

958
01:03:40,833 --> 01:03:42,233
friend, someone tricked Curran

959
01:03:42,233 --> 01:03:43,800
into going to that building.

960
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:44,967
It wasn't Emily Gray.

961
01:03:44,967 --> 01:03:46,133
It was a man.

962
01:03:46,133 --> 01:03:47,700
Someone you know.

963
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:49,700
Think about it.

964
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:50,467
The riddle you found in the

965
01:03:50,467 --> 01:03:53,700
subway wasn't random.

966
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:54,600
They had to know who you were,

967
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:55,867
what you were into.

968
01:03:55,867 --> 01:03:56,800
They even know about me, right?

969
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:57,567
They left the riddle in the

970
01:03:57,567 --> 01:03:59,800
store.

971
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:01,333
Whatever's going on here, it's

972
01:04:01,333 --> 01:04:04,700
not just about Emily Gray.

973
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:06,067
>> We can't go to the cops.

974
01:04:06,067 --> 01:04:09,067
>> Yeah, well, watch me.

975
01:04:09,067 --> 01:04:16,300
>> Vern...what if it's real?

976
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:18,233
What if there's something

977
01:04:18,233 --> 01:04:21,833
happening that we can't explain?

978
01:04:21,833 --> 01:04:22,533
Don't you want to know the

979
01:04:22,533 --> 01:04:25,167
answers?

980
01:04:25,167 --> 01:04:27,167
>> You just don't get it, do

981
01:04:27,167 --> 01:04:29,800
you?

982
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,167
Your mother died.

983
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:32,067
I'm sorry.

984
01:04:32,067 --> 01:04:33,133
That's messed up.

985
01:04:33,133 --> 01:04:33,933
But if you're looking for some

986
01:04:33,933 --> 01:04:34,767
kind of magic potion for your

987
01:04:34,767 --> 01:04:35,733
problems just because you had a

988
01:04:35,733 --> 01:04:39,567
rough ride, well, guess what?

989
01:04:39,567 --> 01:04:44,133
You're not the only one.

990
01:04:44,133 --> 01:04:44,867
Try watching two of your

991
01:04:44,867 --> 01:04:45,867
friends die in a construction

992
01:04:45,867 --> 01:04:48,600
fire that was you fault.

993
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:49,367
Try getting over that in a

994
01:04:49,367 --> 01:04:52,167
hurry.

995
01:04:52,167 --> 01:04:53,200
We've withheld evidence of a

996
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,833
murder here.

997
01:04:54,833 --> 01:04:55,667
If we don't tell the cops what

998
01:04:55,667 --> 01:04:56,667
happened, then our credibility

999
01:04:56,667 --> 01:04:57,800
is gone--and

1000
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:00,533
that's all we've got right now.

1001
01:05:00,533 --> 01:05:01,800
We've got nothing but our word

1002
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:06,633
here.

1003
01:05:06,633 --> 01:05:07,700
Find Romeo's girl and the word

1004
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:14,333
fear will be here.

1005
01:05:14,333 --> 01:05:16,300
>> What are you talking about?

1006
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:18,200
>> Nothing.

1007
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:18,933
Maybe you're right.

1008
01:05:18,933 --> 01:05:19,700
Maybe we shouldn't go to the

1009
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:20,533
cops.

1010
01:05:20,533 --> 01:05:21,667
Go home.

1011
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:22,433
Get rid of anything to do with

1012
01:05:22,433 --> 01:05:23,400
riddles, anything to do with

1013
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:24,633
the game.

1014
01:05:24,633 --> 01:05:25,967
>> You think we can cover this

1015
01:05:25,967 --> 01:05:26,967
up?

1016
01:05:26,967 --> 01:05:27,933
>> Just that part of it.

1017
01:05:27,933 --> 01:05:28,700
Get rid of everything that

1018
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:29,767
connects you to this thing.

1019
01:05:29,767 --> 01:05:32,933
>> What about you?

1020
01:05:32,933 --> 01:05:33,900
>> I've got to check something

1021
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:35,900
first.

1022
01:06:02,933 --> 01:06:05,233
>> Hi, Emily.

1023
01:06:10,233 --> 01:06:12,700
Didn't need to be like this,

1024
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:14,533
did it?

1025
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:26,433
>> [sighs]

1026
01:06:26,433 --> 01:06:30,167
Emily Gray.

1027
01:06:30,167 --> 01:06:31,733
First class honors, high school.

1028
01:06:31,733 --> 01:06:34,067
Graduated, Vancouver.

1029
01:06:34,067 --> 01:06:35,133
Everything seems to have gone

1030
01:06:35,133 --> 01:06:37,100
along swimmingly until 1995.

1031
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:42,667
Then 1996...wow!

1032
01:06:42,667 --> 01:06:45,667
You tried to drown a little boy

1033
01:06:45,667 --> 01:06:47,967
in the lake...

1034
01:06:47,967 --> 01:06:53,167
out of the blue.

1035
01:06:53,167 --> 01:06:55,267
You served five years for that.

1036
01:06:55,267 --> 01:06:56,233
You're only out for one and

1037
01:06:56,233 --> 01:07:00,767
then this mess.

1038
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:01,567
You want to tell me what's

1039
01:07:01,567 --> 01:07:02,400
going on?

1040
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:03,333
I mean, you do, right?

1041
01:07:03,333 --> 01:07:08,233
That's...why you confessed.

1042
01:07:08,233 --> 01:07:09,600
I'm all ears, Emily.

1043
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:10,700
You got something worth saying,

1044
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:13,167
let's hear it.

1045
01:07:13,167 --> 01:07:18,967
What...the hell...happened?

1046
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:31,067
>> What if I told you that I

1047
01:07:31,067 --> 01:07:34,967
knew the meaning of life?

1048
01:07:34,967 --> 01:07:38,067
That every leaf that falls,

1049
01:07:38,067 --> 01:07:41,700
every bee you crush underfoot,

1050
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:45,100
it's all part of a design.

1051
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:47,100
So complex it looks like

1052
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:52,633
chaos, but it's not.

1053
01:07:52,633 --> 01:08:00,133
>> Is there a Santa Claus, too?

1054
01:08:00,133 --> 01:08:01,967
Okay, you got me.

1055
01:08:01,967 --> 01:08:07,900
What's the design?

1056
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:11,333
>> Describe the color red.

1057
01:08:11,333 --> 01:08:13,433
Some things you have to see for

1058
01:08:13,433 --> 01:08:15,900
yourself.

1059
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:19,467
>> Right.

1060
01:08:19,467 --> 01:08:23,567
So, how do I see this design?

1061
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,767
Look, Emily, if you want

1062
01:08:30,767 --> 01:08:31,867
someone who's going to pant and

1063
01:08:31,867 --> 01:08:32,833
beg for what's going on in your

1064
01:08:32,833 --> 01:08:36,067
head, you've got the wrong guy.

1065
01:08:36,067 --> 01:08:36,867
Either you tell me what this is

1066
01:08:36,867 --> 01:08:37,767
all about or I'm out of

1067
01:08:37,767 --> 01:08:40,500
here--right?

1068
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:43,767
What's the design?

1069
01:08:50,767 --> 01:08:53,467
Okay.

1070
01:08:53,467 --> 01:08:55,267
That just about covers it.

1071
01:08:55,267 --> 01:08:59,567
Good luck with the padded cell.

1072
01:08:59,567 --> 01:09:00,667
>> Have you figured out why it

1073
01:09:00,667 --> 01:09:04,067
happened yet?

1074
01:09:04,067 --> 01:09:07,067
Your poor wife.

1075
01:09:07,067 --> 01:09:09,700
Three days in a hospital, her

1076
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:11,633
ribcage crushed by the steering

1077
01:09:11,633 --> 01:09:14,167
wheel.

1078
01:09:14,167 --> 01:09:15,133
You haven't been able to make

1079
01:09:15,133 --> 01:09:17,800
any sense out of it, have you?

1080
01:09:25,767 --> 01:09:27,933
>> Who told you that?

1081
01:09:31,633 --> 01:09:34,900
Look, just because somehow you

1082
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:37,167
got a hold of my file, doesn't

1083
01:09:37,167 --> 01:09:38,067
mean to say I'm going to roll

1084
01:09:38,067 --> 01:09:39,667
over and play dead.

1085
01:09:39,667 --> 01:09:40,633
I hate to be the one to tell

1086
01:09:40,633 --> 01:09:42,267
you this, lady, but there is no

1087
01:09:42,267 --> 01:09:42,933
design.

1088
01:09:42,933 --> 01:09:44,600
You're crazy.

1089
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:48,067
>> Am I?

1090
01:09:48,067 --> 01:09:51,400
Because I tried to drown a boy?

1091
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:54,533
Because I killed a student?

1092
01:09:54,533 --> 01:09:57,767
Is that so wrong?

1093
01:09:57,767 --> 01:09:58,867
Is an earthquake wrong when it

1094
01:09:58,867 --> 01:10:00,633
kills?

1095
01:10:00,633 --> 01:10:06,900
Or a car or a flight of stairs.

1096
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:11,533
Why don't you just admit it?

1097
01:10:11,533 --> 01:10:12,800
You don't understand why

1098
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,633
anything happens and you never

1099
01:10:15,633 --> 01:10:17,467
will.

There are many of us.

Look at it in the mirror.

know something about a design.

1126
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:05,467
She looks in the mirror and she

1127
01:12:05,467 --> 01:12:07,200
says she sees a name.

1128
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:13,300

1147
01:13:54,133 --> 01:13:56,267
Why did you try to kill him?

1148
01:13:56,267 --> 01:13:57,433
>> When he looks in

1149
01:13:57,433 --> 01:14:01,600
the mirror, he knows...

1150
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,267
I never sinned.

1151
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:30,800
>> [computer bleeps]

1152
01:14:33,333 --> 01:14:35,967
>> I'm here.

1153
01:14:35,967 --> 01:14:38,400
So where's the word of fear?

1154
01:14:39,667 --> 01:14:41,667
>> [computer beeps]

1155
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:57,500
>> [computer beeping]

1156
01:15:34,267 --> 01:15:37,067
>> All right, I'm here.

1157
01:15:41,333 --> 01:15:44,933
This is what you wanted, right?

1158
01:15:44,933 --> 01:15:45,600
I was supposed to come here

1159
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:46,333
with the answer.

1160
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:49,467
Well, here I am.

1161
01:15:49,467 --> 01:15:52,433
You win, man.

1162
01:15:52,433 --> 01:15:53,600
I thought you were the village

1163
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:57,300
idiot, okay?

1164
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:59,833
You win, man.

1165
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:24,900
What do you want from me?

1166
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:27,600
>> [thud]

1167
01:16:33,867 --> 01:16:37,433
>> You want to kill me, hmm?

1168
01:16:37,433 --> 01:16:38,600
Is that it?

1169
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:39,333
Do you want to kill me, too,

1170
01:16:39,333 --> 01:16:41,233
you ghost?

1171
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:52,067
Bring it on.

1172
01:16:55,867 --> 01:16:59,800
"What eats to live, but never

1173
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:01,067
drinks?"

1174
01:17:01,067 --> 01:17:02,400
>> [clattering]

1175
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:12,067
You want me to answer it?

1176
01:17:12,067 --> 01:17:14,967
Is that it?

1177
01:17:14,967 --> 01:17:16,333
You want me to come down here

1178
01:17:16,333 --> 01:17:17,167
and write the answer to your

1179
01:17:17,167 --> 01:17:18,500
riddle on the wall?

1180
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:19,900
What eats to live, but never

1181
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:22,200
drinks?

1182
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:23,700
What eats to live, but never

1183
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:25,933
drinks?

1184
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:11,367
>> Oh!

1185
01:18:11,367 --> 01:18:13,633
Oh.

1186
01:18:13,633 --> 01:18:15,600
Sorry.

1187
01:19:30,933 --> 01:19:33,600
>> I was just this little boy

1188
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:36,267
and I was playing by the water

1189
01:19:36,267 --> 01:19:37,300
and she came up and she tried

1190
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:39,100
to push me under.

1191
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:41,567
She tried to kill me!

1192
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:45,067
And I never understood why...

1193
01:19:45,067 --> 01:19:49,067
until I found this riddle.

1194
01:19:49,067 --> 01:19:51,300
When I answered it, I suddenly

1195
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:52,900
knew.

1196
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:53,933
It's all part of the design,

1197
01:19:53,933 --> 01:19:54,633
Sara.

1198
01:19:54,633 --> 01:19:55,600
You un--you understand,

1199
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:56,833
you know.

1200
01:19:56,833 --> 01:19:58,900
No matter what we do, Emily

1201
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:00,733
showed me.

1202
01:20:00,733 --> 01:20:03,467
There's no right or wrong.

1203
01:20:03,467 --> 01:20:10,800
There's only the design.

1204
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:11,600
We kill because there's no

1205
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,733
reason not to.

1206
01:20:27,867 --> 01:20:28,633
You can't run away from it,

1207
01:20:28,633 --> 01:20:30,500
Sara.

1208
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:37,633
We all have our role to play in

1209
01:20:37,633 --> 01:20:42,100
this.

1210
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:44,300
I know mine.

1211
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:46,233
Do you know what yours is?

1212
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:52,100
Arrghh!

1213
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:53,833
[gasping]

1214
01:21:06,967 --> 01:21:12,067
You'll see it soon.

1215
01:21:12,067 --> 01:21:13,067
>> [gun shot]

1216
01:21:13,067 --> 01:21:14,967
>> [scream]

1217
01:21:58,567 --> 01:22:00,300
>> Tom, is she okay?

1218
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:01,100
>> Whoa, whoa!

1219
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:01,767
Boss, boss, boss...

1220
01:22:01,767 --> 01:22:02,433
>> What?

1221
01:22:02,433 --> 01:22:03,600
>> Just...just

1222
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:04,267
give her a minute.

1223
01:22:04,267 --> 01:22:05,233
>> Well, what happened?

1224
01:22:05,233 --> 01:22:06,267
A street kid attacked her.

1225
01:22:06,267 --> 01:22:07,200
We got two witnesses inside.

1226
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:08,567
>> Street kid?

1227
01:22:08,567 --> 01:22:09,433
>> He died ten minutes after we

1228
01:22:09,433 --> 01:22:10,100
got here.

1229
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:10,933
>> Oh!

1230
01:22:10,933 --> 01:22:12,100
>> There was a struggle, he had

1231
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:12,767
a gun.

1232
01:22:12,767 --> 01:22:13,433
>> Who was he?

1233
01:22:13,433 --> 01:22:14,267
>> That's what we're trying to

1234
01:22:14,267 --> 01:22:16,567
get from her now.

1235
01:22:19,733 --> 01:22:21,867
>> Sara, I need you to think

1236
01:22:21,867 --> 01:22:25,433
really clearly right now.

1237
01:22:25,433 --> 01:22:26,467
I want you to tell me exactly

1238
01:22:26,467 --> 01:22:29,100
what happened.

1239
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:29,933
>> I told you.

1240
01:22:29,933 --> 01:22:31,067
I was attacked by a gun man.

1241
01:22:31,067 --> 01:22:33,400
His name was Dennis Reveni.

1242
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:35,500
>> What was he doing here?

1243
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:39,400
You knew who he was.

1244
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:41,267
Sara?

1245
01:22:41,267 --> 01:22:44,533
When we searched the body, we

1246
01:22:44,533 --> 01:22:45,367
found this in one of the

1247
01:22:45,367 --> 01:22:47,633
pockets.

1248
01:22:51,067 --> 01:22:54,567
It appears he knew who you were.

1249
01:23:20,367 --> 01:23:26,067
>> Sara, are you okay?

1250
01:23:26,067 --> 01:23:28,800
Baby?

1251
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:31,633
On the phone, you said you knew

1252
01:23:31,633 --> 01:23:35,700
something about all of this.

1253
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:40,933
You've got to help us now.

1254
01:23:40,933 --> 01:23:43,867
What happened?

1255
01:23:48,433 --> 01:23:52,367
Sara, please!

1256
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:15,433
You know, honey, we might never

1257
01:24:15,433 --> 01:24:19,333
know why mom died.

1258
01:24:19,333 --> 01:24:22,433
But if we knew all the answers,

1259
01:24:22,433 --> 01:24:26,633
we wouldn't be human.

1260
01:24:26,633 --> 01:24:29,567
Maybe...maybe

1261
01:24:29,567 --> 01:24:30,700
not knowing the answers but

1262
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:34,600
going on living, that's what

1263
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:36,700
life's all about.

1264
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:02,900
Tom.

1265
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:05,733
>> TOM: Yeah?

1266
01:25:05,733 --> 01:25:07,500
>> I'm going to take her down

1267
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:09,433
to the station myself.

1268
01:25:09,433 --> 01:25:10,167
>> You okay?

1269
01:25:10,167 --> 01:25:11,867
You want me to come with you?

1270
01:25:11,867 --> 01:25:14,367
>> No, we'll be...be okay.

1271
01:25:14,367 --> 01:25:17,367
>> All right.

1272
01:25:17,367 --> 01:25:19,233
>> Sara!

1273
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,867
>> Vern?

1274
01:25:57,133 --> 01:25:59,400
Vern, are you in here?

1275
01:26:14,067 --> 01:26:16,733
Do you know the answers now?

1276
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:23,733
Do you understand?

1277
01:26:27,567 --> 01:26:29,500
Is there really a design?

1278
01:26:53,667 --> 01:26:54,400
>> It was all part of the

1279
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:56,067
design, Sara.

1280
01:28:01,333 --> 01:28:03,233
>> *
