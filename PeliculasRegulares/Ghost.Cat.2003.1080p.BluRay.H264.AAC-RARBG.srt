1
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,767
Some people claim they've
seen ghosts of soldiers

2
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:58,500
on the battlefields around here.
Absolutely swear to it.

3
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,633
How can you write a book about
ghosts of the American Revolution

4
00:02:02,733 --> 00:02:04,700
when you are
a total non-believer?

5
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,867
I'm not a total
non-believer. Right

6
00:02:06,967 --> 00:02:08,909
I look forward to being proven wrong,
but until then,

7
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:11,167
I plan to find
verifiable explanations

8
00:02:11,267 --> 00:02:14,367
for all things ghostly
and ghoulish.

9
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,433
Right.

10
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,067
Here it is.

11
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,267
Beautiful downtown Ringwood.
It's smaller than I remember.

12
00:02:26,367 --> 00:02:28,243
Your mom dragged me here
right after we were married.

13
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:32,200
I think she'd be happy
we're coming back.

14
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,233
So do you think a New York
City girl like you can hack it?

15
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:40,633
I'll be fine.
Take a look at that.

16
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:43,067
Slow down.
I'll get the number.

17
00:02:49,733 --> 00:02:51,067
Excuse me.

18
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:53,200
Are you the owner?

19
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,900
No. My aunt.
She's the one selling.

20
00:02:56,067 --> 00:02:57,833
Could we make an
appointment to look at it?

21
00:02:57,933 --> 00:03:00,700
Come on in.
I'll show it to you.

22
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:04,700
Hi. I'm Boyd Ashboro.

23
00:03:05,933 --> 00:03:06,833
Nice to meet you.

24
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:08,767
Wes Merritt.
This is my daughter Natalie.

25
00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:09,867
Hi.

26
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,267
You new to Ringwood?

27
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:13,533
My wife used to live here.

28
00:03:13,633 --> 00:03:15,333
It's a nice town.

29
00:03:16,533 --> 00:03:18,200
What a beautiful cat.

30
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,633
That's Margaret.
My aunt's baby.

31
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:24,267
Seriously.

32
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,800
My!

33
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:46,067
And they wonder
why there's road rage.

34
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,600
Hi, Mrs. Ashboro.

35
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,767
What was that maniac doing here?

36
00:03:57,867 --> 00:04:02,300
I guess if you're Ted Riker,
you don't take no for an answer.

37
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,400
Don't give in to him, Brenda.

38
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,233
He'll build those abominable
cookie-cutter houses in your lovely field.

39
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,400
Hello, guys!

40
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,233
I've got you a present!

41
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:17,100
Thank you.
I'll get it.

42
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,067
You're my favorite guys.

43
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:21,500
You know what this is,
don't you?

44
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,767
Come on. You're my favorite
boys! You're my favorite boys!

45
00:04:24,867 --> 00:04:26,776
Let's go home and treat the
bunch. Come on. Come on!

46
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,767
Come on, guys. Come on, dog.
Good boy, Trapper!

47
00:04:41,167 --> 00:04:44,567
If I had to sell this place,
I'd never forgive myself.

48
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:46,300
What would happen
to the animals?

49
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,733
Well, then don't.

50
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:50,633
I wish it were that simple.

51
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:52,767
Things are a little
rough right now.

52
00:04:52,867 --> 00:04:54,167
How rough?

53
00:04:54,267 --> 00:04:59,467
Taxes have gone up,
supplies are more expensive.

54
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:01,467
Dr. Milton used to
volunteer his services,

55
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,300
but the new vet charges
almost full rate.

56
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,633
Here you go.

57
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:09,900
And on top of that,
Riker's causing problems again.

58
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:11,967
Riker? What?

59
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:16,167
He's bad-mouthing me all over town,
so donations are down.

60
00:05:16,267 --> 00:05:19,933
I honestly think that's why
the bank is being so difficult.

61
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:21,767
What?

62
00:05:21,867 --> 00:05:23,267
Nothing.

63
00:05:23,367 --> 00:05:27,233
Brenda, you can tell me.

64
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,433
I'm behind on the mortgage.

65
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:31,533
They're not happy.

66
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,167
That's just what
Riker needs to hear.

67
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,333
It's in mint condition.

68
00:05:39,433 --> 00:05:42,833
New furnace last year,
new roof three years before that.

69
00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:45,733
My aunt's lived here
her whole life.

70
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,700
Such a beautiful creature.

71
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:51,900
I wouldn't pet her
if I were you.

72
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:54,933
She doesn't like strangers.
Bites.

73
00:05:55,067 --> 00:05:58,700
And at 15 years of age,
it's a bad habit she isn't about to lose.

74
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:02,867
Margaret saved
my aunt's life once.

75
00:06:02,967 --> 00:06:04,500
Really?

76
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,700
Yeah. Old girl took a nap,
left the stove on.

77
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,500
Dish towel caught fire,
and Margaret woke her up.

78
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,700
Whole place would've
gone up like a tinderbox.

79
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,500
You're a smart cat, aren't you?

80
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,767
Yeah, that's why
my aunt has to sell.

81
00:06:17,867 --> 00:06:19,433
She's getting on.

82
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:23,867
She'll be safer living
with me or... in a home.

83
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:27,533
I should show you
the cellar. Sure.

84
00:06:27,633 --> 00:06:31,633
There's no way you're
going to be bullied into selling.

85
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:33,333
I'm going to help.

86
00:06:33,433 --> 00:06:35,833
You've already helped.
No, I mean it. I...

87
00:06:35,933 --> 00:06:41,267
I... I have a little bit
put aside.

88
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:44,300
No, I absolutely refuse...
Brenda...

89
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,633
where would I be if you
hadn't found Margaret for me?

90
00:06:53,067 --> 00:06:55,067
Come here, Margaret.

91
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,233
Margaret, I'm home.

92
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:20,233
Margaret?

93
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:27,700
Who are you?

94
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,800
I-I'm Natalie.
My dad, he's...

95
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,567
He's looking at your house.

96
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:38,067
With your nephew, Boyd?

97
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:40,333
Is that so?

98
00:07:41,933 --> 00:07:44,067
I think they're in the cellar.

99
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:51,867
Margaret doesn't usually
respond to strangers.

100
00:07:53,867 --> 00:07:55,333
Have we met before?

101
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,700
I don't think so.

102
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,400
Your face is
very familiar to me.

103
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:05,067
She's a lovely cat.

104
00:08:05,133 --> 00:08:10,267
Margaret is as loyal and loving
an animal as you could ever want.

105
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:15,667
She... She really seems to
have taken to you, that's for sure.

106
00:08:15,767 --> 00:08:18,367
You're one of the chosen few.

107
00:08:18,467 --> 00:08:19,467
Aunt Ruth!

108
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,667
I didn't hear you come in.

109
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:24,567
This is Wes Merritt.
I just gave him the tour.

110
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:26,633
It's a beautiful house,
Mrs. Ashboro.

111
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:30,300
Well, I hate to disappoint you,
but I am not selling.

112
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,133
I'm sorry, my dear.

113
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:33,867
I hope you find a nice place.

114
00:08:33,967 --> 00:08:35,887
And when you do,
perhaps you'll come to visit us.

115
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:40,600
- Come along, Margaret.
- Let's go and have our lunch.

116
00:08:47,067 --> 00:08:49,833
She can be eccentric.

117
00:08:49,933 --> 00:08:51,233
Not to worry.

118
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:52,933
Call me if you decide
you want the house.

119
00:08:53,067 --> 00:08:55,233
Look, Boyd,
I wouldn't... No, seriously.

120
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,967
And if you want a mortgage,
I can handle it.

121
00:08:58,067 --> 00:08:59,900
My card.

122
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:03,267
Thanks, but I wouldn't dream of buying
the house out from under your aunt.

123
00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:07,067
She has to sell.
Call me. Anytime.

124
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:08,667
Thank you.

125
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:15,400
Poor woman.

126
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,420
Can you imagine having to sell the
house you lived in for your whole life?

127
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:24,133
Hey! Aren't you friendly!

128
00:09:24,233 --> 00:09:27,167
Yeah, you are.

129
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:37,767
Don't you understand?
You have to sell.

130
00:09:37,867 --> 00:09:40,367
Why? Because you're
going to move in with me.

131
00:09:40,467 --> 00:09:43,300
It's the right thing. You wouldn't
have anything to worry about.

132
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,767
Right.

133
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:48,100
I'm supposed to sell my house,
hand over the money to you

134
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,533
and go and sit in your house
and not worry about a thing.

135
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,400
Sounds peachy.

136
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:58,167
Why are you so adamant
about me selling?

137
00:09:58,267 --> 00:10:01,067
Why has this come up all
of a sudden? Aunt Ruth...

138
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:04,367
Next thing I know, you'll be carting
me off to some old folks' home.

139
00:10:04,467 --> 00:10:06,300
No. You... You can't
live on your own.

140
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,667
Yes, I can!

141
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:09,933
And if I can't,
I'll get someone to live with me.

142
00:10:10,033 --> 00:10:11,633
I'll hire someone.

143
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:13,867
You don't have
the money to do that.

144
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:15,300
Yes, I do.

145
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,133
I have something tucked away
for a rainy day.

146
00:10:18,233 --> 00:10:20,467
But it isn't raining yet.

147
00:10:20,567 --> 00:10:24,433
What money? You shouldn't
have money lying around.

148
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:28,267
It isn't lying around. And it's
really none of your business, Boyd.

149
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:30,287
I was just trying to help,
Aunt Ruth, that's all.

150
00:10:30,367 --> 00:10:32,100
I don't need your help.

151
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,767
Why don't you help
someone who does?

152
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,033
Like Brenda.

153
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:37,500
Excuse me?

154
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,733
She's got mortgage troubles.

155
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:44,067
Go back to that office of yours
and use your influence.

156
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,833
Maybe I can do something
about that

157
00:10:48,933 --> 00:10:51,100
after I take care
of this whole situation.

158
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,033
Don't you think that you've
caused enough trouble for one day?

159
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:59,267
And I don't appreciate
coming home

160
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,067
and finding a "for sale" sign
on my house.

161
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,067
I won't have it.

162
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,367
Fine.

163
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:10,133
Fine!

164
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,933
It's all about money.

165
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:36,367
Always is with Boyd.

166
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:43,800
How can he get so upset
about a house

167
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,600
when there are so many more
important things in life?

168
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,467
Hey, Jan.
Brenda.

169
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:02,733
Pretty cold out? Radio said
we're due for more snow.

170
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,567
Yeah, sure feels like it.
Listen, I hate to bug you,

171
00:12:05,667 --> 00:12:08,100
but I've got a complaint here
from Walter.

172
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,533
One dog. I was on the phone
half the morning with him.

173
00:12:11,633 --> 00:12:13,667
One dog got out,
and I have no idea how.

174
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:15,900
I had a complaint
last week, as well.

175
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:18,833
I know.
It won't happen again.

176
00:12:18,933 --> 00:12:22,067
It better not,
Brenda. You've been warned. Bye.

177
00:12:36,867 --> 00:12:39,167
Hi! Mrs. Ashboro.

178
00:12:39,267 --> 00:12:41,467
Isn't this a happy coincidence.

179
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:44,567
I was hoping I would
run into you to apologize.

180
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:48,933
Listen, dear, I hope
I didn't appear to be rude.

181
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:52,633
I'm just not ready to sell.
No, no.

182
00:12:52,733 --> 00:12:55,200
We totally understand, really.

183
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,267
Where's your father?

184
00:12:57,367 --> 00:12:58,767
Checking out the archives.

185
00:12:58,867 --> 00:13:02,833
So why have you chosen Ringwood?

186
00:13:02,933 --> 00:13:07,167
I mean, you probably told me,
but it flies out of my mind.

187
00:13:07,267 --> 00:13:10,600
Well, my mom lived here
until she was 17,

188
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,900
and my dad's writing a book
on the American Revolution.

189
00:13:14,067 --> 00:13:17,867
I have this strong feeling
that I have met you before.

190
00:13:17,967 --> 00:13:20,133
I can't get over it.

191
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:22,700
Now, what was
your mother's maiden name?

192
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,833
Walmer.
Mary Ann Walmer.

193
00:13:25,933 --> 00:13:27,567
Well, there it is.

194
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:29,967
No wonder you look
so darn familiar.

195
00:13:30,067 --> 00:13:32,067
I know Mary Ann Walmer.

196
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,167
Really?
Yes!

197
00:13:34,267 --> 00:13:37,633
I was the librarian here
for 25 years,

198
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:42,300
and your mother
practically lived here.

199
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,933
And this...

200
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:46,300
This was her favorite table.

201
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,167
This very... This very one.

202
00:13:48,267 --> 00:13:50,967
That's so cool.

203
00:13:51,067 --> 00:13:52,967
She loved books.

204
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:54,500
And you?

205
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,800
You are the spitting image
of her.

206
00:13:59,067 --> 00:14:01,433
How is she, your mother?

207
00:14:03,767 --> 00:14:08,367
My mom passed away...
almost a year ago.

208
00:14:13,067 --> 00:14:16,100
My dear, I'm so sorry.

209
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:24,267
Well, words don't do much,
do they?

210
00:14:29,733 --> 00:14:33,300
Mary Ann. My.

211
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,233
Did you know that your mother
was quite an actress?

212
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,733
No.

213
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:41,267
I'll never forget. She must have
been about 10 or 11, I guess.

214
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,200
Hey, you missed the meeting.

215
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,933
Family business.

216
00:14:55,067 --> 00:14:56,933
They've got
some auditors coming in.

217
00:14:57,067 --> 00:14:58,433
Why?

218
00:14:58,533 --> 00:15:01,200
There's weird stuff going on
with some of the accounts.

219
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,233
Looks like someone
has light fingers.

220
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,967
Inside job.

221
00:15:06,133 --> 00:15:07,567
Graydon Industries?

222
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:10,800
You didn't get caught
in that fiasco, did you?

223
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,967
What a mess!

224
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:13,967
When? When are
the auditors coming in?

225
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:16,067
End of the month.

226
00:15:25,067 --> 00:15:26,833
I heard this loud thump.

227
00:15:28,067 --> 00:15:29,067
Shh!

228
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,867
Like that. She threw her book
on the table in a big huff.

229
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:41,067
It turned out the school was holding
auditions for A Midsummer Night's Dream.

230
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,500
She was having trouble
memorizing the lines.

231
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,667
Nerves, you know.

232
00:15:45,767 --> 00:15:48,367
So I sat down and helped her.

233
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:51,300
Wouldn't you know it?
She got the part.

234
00:15:53,267 --> 00:15:57,900
I missed her so much when
she moved away with her family.

235
00:15:58,067 --> 00:16:01,333
But I never forgot her.

236
00:16:01,433 --> 00:16:04,367
And now I've met you,
I feel like I've seen her again.

237
00:16:04,467 --> 00:16:10,067
Well, I'm sure that you're going
to find a house that suits you.

238
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:12,133
I just know it.

239
00:16:12,233 --> 00:16:14,467
You belong here.

240
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:16,900
Thank you.

241
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:21,933
And when you do,
you absolutely must come and visit me.

242
00:16:22,067 --> 00:16:25,333
Yeah, I will.
I promise.

243
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:26,433
Bye.

244
00:16:26,533 --> 00:16:27,767
Wait.

245
00:16:27,867 --> 00:16:29,900
Say hello to Margaret for me.

246
00:16:30,067 --> 00:16:31,967
I will.

247
00:16:46,533 --> 00:16:49,833
And how are you today,
Mrs. Ashboro? Just peachy, Sandra.

248
00:16:49,933 --> 00:16:51,600
Thought I'd check out
the family jewels.

249
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,800
Well, let me know
when you're through.

250
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,700
So I hated the one with the orange
carpets and the glass bricks, all right?

251
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,867
How about that second one?

252
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:15,800
The one with the skinny hallway.

253
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,733
Did that smell weird,
or was that just the agent?

254
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:25,067
I liked
Mrs. Ashboro's house.

255
00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:27,833
I mean, no wonder
she doesn't want to move.

256
00:17:29,467 --> 00:17:32,933
She's such a nice person.

257
00:17:33,067 --> 00:17:35,067
It's so weird that she knew mom.

258
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:39,667
I mean, listening to her talk about
her when she was little, it was...

259
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,700
it was amazing.

260
00:17:43,233 --> 00:17:46,267
So you want to come back
next weekend, look some more?

261
00:17:46,367 --> 00:17:49,867
Sure, I guess.

262
00:17:52,067 --> 00:17:55,800
Congratulations, Ken. You've just
made the best investment of your life.

263
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,900
Walter, you're gonna
have to talk to your wife.

264
00:17:58,067 --> 00:18:00,100
Your friend here's
ahead of the game.

265
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,200
Seriously,
just check out the specs.

266
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,100
These properties are going
to double their value in...

267
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,333
four years max.

268
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:09,067
Seriously, guys.

269
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,167
This Woodland Development is
going to put this town on the map.

270
00:18:12,267 --> 00:18:15,043
Ringwood's going to become one of
the most affluent little commuter towns

271
00:18:15,067 --> 00:18:16,600
in the country.

272
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,600
We should toast to that.
Yeah. Come on.

273
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,867
Two more.

274
00:18:23,967 --> 00:18:25,900
Evening.
Hi.

275
00:18:26,067 --> 00:18:28,333
Boyd Ashboro.

276
00:18:28,433 --> 00:18:32,700
Ted Riker. Yeah, I know who
you are. It's a pretty small town.

277
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,900
Yes, it is.

278
00:18:35,067 --> 00:18:38,267
Listen, just thought I'd ask.

279
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:41,933
I have a property up for sale,
near Brenda Yancey's farm.

280
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:44,067
Big one.
Top of the hill.

281
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:46,700
Gray with red trim?
That's the one.

282
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,733
My aunt's.
You interested?

283
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,400
No. Sorry.

284
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,367
I have the package together.

285
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:56,567
There's just one property outstanding.
I expect to close that any day now.

286
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:58,267
Sorry.

287
00:18:58,367 --> 00:18:59,667
No harm in asking, right?

288
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:01,333
No problem.

289
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:03,133
Nice to meet you.

290
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,533
That way I'll remember it,
won't I?

291
00:19:18,633 --> 00:19:20,767
You're the only one
I'll ever confess to

292
00:19:20,867 --> 00:19:23,233
that my memory
isn't what it used to be.

293
00:19:24,367 --> 00:19:26,767
No. no. Now,
don't get any ideas.

294
00:19:26,867 --> 00:19:28,667
You've had your dinner.

295
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:31,533
I'm going to put it
where you can't get into it.

296
00:19:36,067 --> 00:19:40,167
I feel like I accomplished
something today, Margaret.

297
00:19:40,267 --> 00:19:43,100
Now Brenda won't have
a thing to worry about.

298
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,067
I knew I had this.

299
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:02,167
I'm going to give it
to that nice little girl.

300
00:20:06,867 --> 00:20:09,267
My good girl.

301
00:20:09,367 --> 00:20:13,633
We're life companions,
aren't we, you and I.

302
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:17,067
We're not getting any younger.

303
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:52,533
Dad!

304
00:21:12,067 --> 00:21:13,400
Another dream?

305
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:17,333
I was chasing Margaret.

306
00:21:17,433 --> 00:21:18,833
Who?

307
00:21:18,933 --> 00:21:21,433
Mrs. Ashboro's cat.

308
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,467
But I was in
a very strange place.

309
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:29,300
And there was a fire,
and I lost her.

310
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,367
And Mom was there, too, waving.

311
00:21:33,467 --> 00:21:35,933
And then she was gone.

312
00:21:36,067 --> 00:21:38,567
I miss her so much.

313
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,600
Think we'll find
a house today, Dad?

314
00:21:51,267 --> 00:21:54,167
Sure you're not going
to miss your school?

315
00:21:54,267 --> 00:21:55,800
Not really.

316
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,200
What about your friends?

317
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,067
They'll visit.

318
00:22:01,167 --> 00:22:04,367
We'll e-mail, right, Dad?

319
00:22:04,467 --> 00:22:05,467
Yeah.

320
00:22:23,433 --> 00:22:25,400
So where's
that three bedroom one?

321
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,900
It's one more block.

322
00:22:29,067 --> 00:22:31,600
Says it's partially renovated.

323
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,867
That could mean anything.
You wanna go see it?

324
00:22:33,967 --> 00:22:36,067
Yeah, I guess.
Dad, stop!

325
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,367
It's Margaret!
You almost hit Margaret!

326
00:22:41,467 --> 00:22:44,067
What are you talking about?
There's nothing there.

327
00:22:58,633 --> 00:23:02,100
Well, hi, folks.
Wes, right?

328
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,833
Right. Natalie.

329
00:23:04,933 --> 00:23:08,067
Look, I'm sorry I didn't get your
number. I was going to call you.

330
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:11,367
Has your aunt changed
her mind about selling?

331
00:23:14,167 --> 00:23:17,067
We buried Aunt Ruth
this past Wednesday.

332
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,600
Boyd, I'm so sorry.

333
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,467
And Margaret?

334
00:23:24,567 --> 00:23:27,300
How is she? I just saw her
running across the street.

335
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,300
You couldn't have.

336
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,300
The cat passed away
the very night of the funeral.

337
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,133
Weirdest thing.

338
00:23:44,533 --> 00:23:46,809
Are you sure this is a good
time? I don't want to barge in.

339
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:49,233
No, no,
no. No better time than the present.

340
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:52,067
This friend of my aunt's,
Brenda Yancey,

341
00:23:52,167 --> 00:23:54,467
she lives on the farm
across the field.

342
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:57,067
She's the one who gave Aunt
Ruth the cat in the first place.

343
00:23:57,167 --> 00:24:00,400
She says Margaret died
of a broken heart.

344
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,067
The animal was 15 years old,
for crying out loud.

345
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,700
I'm not budging on
the price. I understand.

346
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,767
And if you want it furnished,
it'll cost extra.

347
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:12,333
Margaret.

348
00:24:55,067 --> 00:24:56,233
"Mary Ann Walmer"?

349
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:58,600
Dad!

350
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,667
Dad, we have to buy this house.

351
00:25:03,767 --> 00:25:06,367
It's a sign.
This was Mom's.

352
00:25:31,567 --> 00:25:34,067
Call the dogs off, Brenda!

353
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:36,467
What are you doing here,
Mr. Riker?

354
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:39,700
Surely we're on
a first-name basis by now.

355
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,967
Call me Ted.

356
00:25:42,067 --> 00:25:44,267
If you think you can buy
me off with flowers and wine,

357
00:25:44,367 --> 00:25:46,067
you're barking up
the wrong tree.

358
00:25:46,133 --> 00:25:48,200
I'm not here to buy you off.
I'm here to apologize.

359
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:51,867
Hey, Brenda, you have to understand
me wanting to buy your land.

360
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:55,067
Your parcel's the only thing that's
standing in the way of the development.

361
00:25:55,133 --> 00:25:56,733
And it's a fair price.

362
00:25:56,833 --> 00:25:59,500
I don't understand why
you're being so stubborn.

363
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,867
It's simple.
I don't want to sell.

364
00:26:01,967 --> 00:26:04,100
I hear you're having some
trouble with your neighbors.

365
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,900
That's none of your business.

366
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:08,776
I promise you,
it's only going to get worse.

367
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,633
Is that a threat?

368
00:26:10,733 --> 00:26:13,367
Cautionary advice.

369
00:26:13,467 --> 00:26:15,533
Now, surely we can
do some business.

370
00:26:15,633 --> 00:26:18,133
I want you off my property.

371
00:26:20,567 --> 00:26:21,933
It's my final offer.

372
00:26:22,067 --> 00:26:23,667
Now.

373
00:26:25,967 --> 00:26:28,633
Fine.

374
00:26:28,733 --> 00:26:30,467
Ms. Yancey.

375
00:26:36,667 --> 00:26:38,167
Watch the drawers.

376
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:41,333
You think of everything.

377
00:26:52,067 --> 00:26:53,633
Comfort!
Hey!

378
00:26:53,733 --> 00:26:55,200
Comfort!

379
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,500
Comfort.

380
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,067
That's a cool name.

381
00:26:59,133 --> 00:27:01,267
Um, so are we going
to be neighbors?

382
00:27:01,367 --> 00:27:03,300
Yeah, I guess.
I'm Natalie.

383
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,433
Pearson.

384
00:27:04,533 --> 00:27:07,633
He's a great-looking dog.

385
00:27:07,733 --> 00:27:11,200
See, Comfort? You lose a friend,
another one comes along.

386
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,333
He lost a friend?

387
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:17,600
The cat that used
to live here... Margaret.

388
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,867
They were buddies.

389
00:27:18,967 --> 00:27:22,733
Yeah.
She was so beautiful.

390
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:24,700
So, you should know
I'm basically nosy,

391
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,067
and all I've seen
is you and your dad.

392
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:28,733
No brothers or sisters?

393
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:33,067
No. It's...
It's just the two of us.

394
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:36,100
Hey, Pearson!

395
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,400
That's Kurt, my brother.

396
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,833
Come on! It's lunchtime.

397
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:52,667
Well, see ya.
Come on, boy, let's go.

398
00:27:52,767 --> 00:27:53,933
Come on, boy.

399
00:27:54,067 --> 00:27:56,700
Comfort, come here.
Come here, boy. Come on.

400
00:28:01,867 --> 00:28:06,267
$2,000?
This can't be her only account.

401
00:28:06,367 --> 00:28:10,233
She just had the one
personal savings account.

402
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:13,233
There has to be more though.
I know there's more.

403
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:19,433
She cashed in
a retirement policy.

404
00:28:19,533 --> 00:28:20,767
$50,000.

405
00:28:20,867 --> 00:28:23,233
That's a lot of money.

406
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:24,933
What happened to it?

407
00:28:25,067 --> 00:28:29,433
Mr. Ashboro, I do not put tracer
dogs on other people's money.

408
00:28:29,533 --> 00:28:33,100
Your aunt had a safety deposit
box. You could look in there...

409
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,933
if you have the correct
papers to give you access.

410
00:28:36,067 --> 00:28:39,167
I'm... her only
living relative.

411
00:28:39,267 --> 00:28:41,633
I've got the papers here.

412
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,500
♪ Well, I've been
growin' up too fast ♪

413
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,933
♪ Can't hide
from what you're... ♪

414
00:29:30,067 --> 00:29:31,967
Dad?

415
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,167
My God, you scared me.

416
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:39,667
Sorry.
Front door was open.

417
00:30:39,767 --> 00:30:43,733
My dad, he went to the library,

418
00:30:43,833 --> 00:30:46,200
but he'll be back soon
if there's something you need.

419
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:51,333
Well, I... I think I lost
a cufflink the other day.

420
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:55,100
I was gathering
my aunt's personal things.

421
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,900
Would you mind if I just took a
look around, see if I can find it?

422
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,633
Sure, sure.

423
00:31:07,567 --> 00:31:10,467
He just walked right in.

424
00:31:10,567 --> 00:31:12,133
Totally freaked me out.

425
00:31:12,233 --> 00:31:14,300
Said he was looking
for a cufflink.

426
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,300
He probably misses his aunt.

427
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,600
Needed an excuse to come back.

428
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,600
He gave me the creeps.

429
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,600
Told me if I found anything
that was rightfully his,

430
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,633
it would be against the law
to keep it.

431
00:31:26,733 --> 00:31:28,833
He's just a windbag.

432
00:31:28,933 --> 00:31:32,733
Assistant client funds manager.

433
00:31:35,233 --> 00:31:38,567
Anyway, here's to the house.

434
00:31:38,667 --> 00:31:42,733
And to new beginnings,
new school, new book.

435
00:31:46,667 --> 00:31:48,587
Everything's kind of been
on hold this last year,

436
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:50,967
but we're gonna get back
to some state of...

437
00:31:51,067 --> 00:31:53,167
I don't know, normal.

438
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,533
There is no normal.

439
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,867
Well, at least we can try.

440
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,700
Hey, I found some great stuff
at the library today.

441
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,467
Stories about a guy
who was hung for treason

442
00:32:08,567 --> 00:32:10,167
in a field not far from here.

443
00:32:10,267 --> 00:32:12,067
Charming.
Really charming.

444
00:32:12,133 --> 00:32:14,300
Apparently he's been seen
by about a dozen people,

445
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,800
and amazingly they weren't
all drunk at the time.

446
00:32:43,633 --> 00:32:45,300
It's only Comfort.

447
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,800
He probably just misses
Margaret sitting in the window.

448
00:32:51,967 --> 00:32:54,633
All this ghost chat making you
a little nervous, Dad?

449
00:32:54,733 --> 00:32:56,633
No. Yes, it is. I saw your face.

450
00:32:56,733 --> 00:32:59,833
No way. It's just the house.
It's old, it's creepy.

451
00:33:00,067 --> 00:33:03,833
Yeah, I know how much is riding
on the deal, and I won't let you down.

452
00:33:03,933 --> 00:33:05,267
This is your last chance.

453
00:33:05,367 --> 00:33:07,400
Yeah. Clearly we're
running out of time.

454
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,800
When I want something closed...

455
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,567
Well... Yeah, well, can I...

456
00:33:10,667 --> 00:33:12,633
Too much complications.
Just close it.

457
00:33:12,733 --> 00:33:15,867
Look, can I make a point here?

458
00:33:15,967 --> 00:33:18,043
Why don't you give me the
go-ahead to make her a sweeter offer?

459
00:33:18,067 --> 00:33:19,767
I know that's what
she's waiting for.

460
00:33:19,867 --> 00:33:23,433
If that's what she's waiting for,
give it to her. Okay. Fine.

461
00:33:23,533 --> 00:33:26,900
Just make it happen. Yeah,
I understand that. I'll talk to you.

462
00:33:39,733 --> 00:33:41,067
I'm back.

463
00:33:41,133 --> 00:33:42,400
So I see.

464
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,600
Look, I apologize
for the late hour,

465
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:49,567
but I was driving back from the city,
and I saw the lights.

466
00:33:49,667 --> 00:33:52,600
Excuse me. Look, I had a word
with the people at head office,

467
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,167
and they've allowed me
to make you another offer.

468
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:57,767
Mr. Riker, I think I've
made myself really clear.

469
00:33:57,867 --> 00:34:00,867
But this is really
very generous.

470
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:04,367
I'd have a look at it
if I were you.

471
00:34:07,167 --> 00:34:08,167
There you go.

472
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,433
That wasn't so difficult,
was it?

473
00:34:10,533 --> 00:34:12,200
Good night.

474
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,600
Good night.

475
00:34:46,067 --> 00:34:47,467
Dad?

476
00:35:46,767 --> 00:35:48,567
Mom?

477
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,900
Hey, Natalie!
What's up?

478
00:35:59,067 --> 00:36:00,167
Nothing much.

479
00:36:00,267 --> 00:36:02,200
How'd you like to take
Comfort for a walk?

480
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,833
Maybe we could go across
the field and visit the animals.

481
00:36:04,933 --> 00:36:07,100
What animals?

482
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,233
At Brenda's. She takes in
strays and helps them find homes.

483
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:12,267
Yeah, sure. Why not?

484
00:36:12,367 --> 00:36:13,867
Okay.

485
00:36:13,967 --> 00:36:17,567
- Come on, Comfort!
- Come here!

486
00:36:17,667 --> 00:36:19,900
So where'd you move from?

487
00:36:20,067 --> 00:36:22,067
New York. Manhattan.

488
00:36:22,167 --> 00:36:24,433
It must have been so cool.

489
00:36:24,533 --> 00:36:26,233
It was okay.

490
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:28,400
You miss it?

491
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,067
I don't really know yet.

492
00:36:33,533 --> 00:36:35,067
Where's your mom?

493
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,967
Don't be afraid
to ask questions.

494
00:36:37,067 --> 00:36:39,067
Told you I was nosy.

495
00:36:40,267 --> 00:36:41,900
She passed away.

496
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:46,200
Good one, Pearson.
No, no, it's okay.

497
00:36:50,367 --> 00:36:52,100
I lost my mom, too.

498
00:36:53,667 --> 00:36:56,533
She swerved on the highway
to miss a deer.

499
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,500
I'm so sorry.

500
00:37:02,533 --> 00:37:04,233
Come on, Comfort!

501
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,400
So, you have the one brother?

502
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,900
Yeah. Kurt.
And my stepfather.

503
00:37:22,067 --> 00:37:25,400
They were only been married a
couple of months when it happened.

504
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,100
Poor guy.

505
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,067
But he's cool.
He's from Australia.

506
00:37:30,133 --> 00:37:32,133
Hey, maybe we should
go down to the billabong

507
00:37:32,233 --> 00:37:34,067
and get some chow
for the ol' cake eater.

508
00:37:34,133 --> 00:37:36,267
What?

509
00:37:41,967 --> 00:37:44,267
Hey, Kurt, this is Natalie.

510
00:37:44,367 --> 00:37:45,933
Hey.

511
00:37:49,067 --> 00:37:50,300
So you work here?

512
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,433
Part time.

513
00:37:52,533 --> 00:37:54,600
Full time until
the break's over.

514
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,933
Yeah, and then
you too will experience

515
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:59,333
the indescribable pleasures
of Ringworm High.

516
00:38:02,633 --> 00:38:03,933
So what grade are you in?

517
00:38:04,067 --> 00:38:05,067
Ten.

518
00:38:05,133 --> 00:38:08,767
I'm in nine.
We are the persecuted.

519
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:11,100
What grade are you in?

520
00:38:12,433 --> 00:38:14,167
Eleven.

521
00:38:14,267 --> 00:38:15,500
Fifth try.

522
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,700
Just kidding. I'm kidding.

523
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,833
It must be fun...
working on a farm.

524
00:38:23,933 --> 00:38:27,367
It's an animal shelter,
not a farm.

525
00:38:27,467 --> 00:38:30,067
Okay.
Hey!

526
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,100
Three helpers!
Just what I need.

527
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,700
This is Natalie.

528
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,933
Hi. I'm Brenda.
Nice to meet you.

529
00:38:36,067 --> 00:38:38,133
Natalie Merritt.
Yeah, I know.

530
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:40,933
You moved into my friend's house,
Mrs. Ashboro.

531
00:38:41,067 --> 00:38:43,667
She was just the greatest lady.
You're going to love it there.

532
00:38:45,067 --> 00:38:46,533
Hey, Comfort.

533
00:38:46,633 --> 00:38:49,267
Did you come to visit me, boy?

534
00:38:49,367 --> 00:38:51,067
I missed you, too.

535
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:55,867
Brenda found Comfort for us,
just after mom died.

536
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:57,067
Comfort.

537
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,767
Such a handsome boy, aren't you?

538
00:38:58,867 --> 00:39:01,533
Have you been a good boy?

539
00:39:01,633 --> 00:39:03,367
Anyone feel like working?

540
00:39:03,467 --> 00:39:05,567
Follow me.

00:39:26,967 --> 00:39:29,800

00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,733
I love animals, but living in an apartment,
it's a kinda difficult.

559
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:40,200
Have you ever been to New York?

560
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:43,267
Once. On a school trip.

561
00:40:43,367 --> 00:40:47,400
So you probably went to the
Met and the Guggenheim and...

562
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,800
I skipped out and
went to the village.

563
00:40:51,833 --> 00:40:54,000
You're gonna get it.

564
00:41:00,933 --> 00:41:02,133

Can you two go play

568
00:41:10,533 --> 00:41:13,467
Sony. I was going
for Pearson.

569
00:41:13,567 --> 00:41:15,700
Bad aim, I guess.

570
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,500
Now, I'm asking you!

571
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,300
Did my aunt ever give you money?

572
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,667
Why are you so upset? I've
never seen you like this before.

573
00:41:23,767 --> 00:41:25,367
Did she ever give you money?

574
00:41:25,467 --> 00:41:27,700
You mean did she make donations?

575
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,133
I mean did she ever
give you money?

576
00:41:31,233 --> 00:41:34,067
Yes or no?
Just give me an answer!

577
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,567
Yes, she did.

578
00:41:35,667 --> 00:41:39,500
So my rightful inheritance
was given to you and your zoo.

579
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,700
No, Boyd. I mean
she used to bring by food.

580
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,500
She's been doing that for years.

581
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,709
And every once in a while, she'd very
generously donate some money for the cause.

582
00:41:46,733 --> 00:41:48,767
But I think
that was her business.

583
00:41:48,867 --> 00:41:51,800
It's my business when the cash
was supposed to come to me.

584
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,500
I was under the impression
it was hers to give.

585
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,567
I want my $50,000, Brenda.

586
00:41:56,667 --> 00:41:59,700
$50,000?
Are you of your mind?

587
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:03,733
I'm talking 40 or 50 dollars
every once in a while... $50,000?

588
00:42:03,833 --> 00:42:07,067
You saw an old lady with a
ridiculous amount of compassion

589
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,833
for your flea-bitten strays,
and you milked her! Wait just a minute!

590
00:42:09,933 --> 00:42:12,709
If you're suggesting that I took
advantage of someone that was my friend...

591
00:42:12,733 --> 00:42:14,400
You used her!
You tricked her!

592
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,333
I've never seen
$50,000 in my life.

593
00:42:17,433 --> 00:42:19,433
Well, that's my money,
and I want it back,

594
00:42:19,533 --> 00:42:21,609
so I'm going to get a court order
and have your bank account checked.

595
00:42:21,633 --> 00:42:24,367
Go ahead.
I have nothing to hide.

596
00:42:24,467 --> 00:42:26,367
I think you'd better leave.

597
00:42:26,467 --> 00:42:28,433
I'll be back.

598
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,500
What a jerk.

599
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,067
He's such a creep.

600
00:42:45,133 --> 00:42:46,433
The other day, I'm all alone,

601
00:42:46,533 --> 00:42:48,433
and he walks right in
without even knocking.

602
00:42:48,533 --> 00:42:50,067
I was totally freaked.

603
00:42:50,133 --> 00:42:53,533
If he does it again, call me.
I'll kick his butt.

604
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,367
He practically
called Brenda a liar,

605
00:43:00,467 --> 00:43:03,767
and, I mean, you should see all these
things she does with these animals.

606
00:43:03,867 --> 00:43:08,200
She nurses them back to health,
she finds them new homes.

607
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,367
She looked really upset.

608
00:43:24,833 --> 00:43:26,067
I heard something.

609
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,200
Come on.
No, I did.

610
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,300
Nat...

611
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,700
Dad, look, whether
you like it or not,

612
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,367
there is something
in this house.

613
00:43:34,467 --> 00:43:37,133
I told you, I can feel it.

614
00:43:51,967 --> 00:43:54,567
Sometimes, right after she died,

615
00:43:54,667 --> 00:43:58,167
I thought I felt your mom's
presence in the apartment.

616
00:43:58,267 --> 00:44:02,200
Little things like thinking a mug she
always used for her morning coffee

617
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,067
had been moved on the shelf.

618
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:08,400
Or a hint of her perfume
all of a sudden.

619
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:12,500
But I was just so used
to those everyday things.

620
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,333
I imagined them.

621
00:44:14,433 --> 00:44:18,100
But I didn't imagine her
photo flying off the piano

622
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,867
or the piano keys moving and...

623
00:44:20,967 --> 00:44:24,500
I just don't think it's a coincidence
that Mrs. Ashboro knew her.

624
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:29,800
I'm just saying that your mind is
very open to this kind of thing right now.

625
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:33,667
The people I interview?
One thing in common:

626
00:44:33,767 --> 00:44:37,767
They all lost someone,
and they want them back.

627
00:44:37,867 --> 00:44:42,667
Half the stories I'm tracking for my book turn
out to have perfectly logical explanations.

628
00:44:42,767 --> 00:44:44,609
So what about that guy
who was hung for treason?

629
00:44:44,633 --> 00:44:46,533
You said ten people
had seen him.

630
00:44:46,633 --> 00:44:48,533
That's just
an annual Halloween prank.

631
00:44:48,633 --> 00:44:51,200
It appeals to those people
who like to think

632
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,333
that Ichabod Crane
is still out there,

633
00:44:53,433 --> 00:44:55,733
riding through the night
without his head.

634
00:44:55,833 --> 00:44:58,567
Well, he is, isn't he?
Tell you what.

635
00:44:58,667 --> 00:45:00,400
Let's both you and I
stay up tonight.

636
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,767
That way, if something happens,
we'll both be there to see it.

637
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,300
Okay? Deal?

638
00:45:07,233 --> 00:45:08,533
Deal.

639
00:45:10,767 --> 00:45:14,567
Hey! Natalie! Hi!

640
00:45:14,667 --> 00:45:17,100
Hey.

641
00:45:18,567 --> 00:45:21,733
This is my dad.
Dad, Brenda.

642
00:45:21,833 --> 00:45:23,500
Wes Merritt.
Hi.

643
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,100
So you must be the animal lady.

644
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,433
I mean, you look after strays,
dogs, Natalie tells me.

645
00:45:28,533 --> 00:45:30,600
Yeah, and Natalie tells me
you're a writer.

646
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:33,300
I'm sure I must've read
some of your books.

647
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,567
You read a lot of history?
I'm a history buff.

648
00:45:35,667 --> 00:45:38,100
It's hard not to be,
living around here.

649
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,833
In fact, George Washington
used to visit Ringwood all the time.

650
00:45:41,933 --> 00:45:45,100
One of his chief mapmakers lived in
the area, a General Erskine, I think.

651
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,080
Yeah, Erskine. I've been
meaning to look him up.

652
00:45:47,167 --> 00:45:49,067
Yeah?
Yeah.

653
00:45:50,367 --> 00:45:53,367
Trapper, Bo!
Hang on!

654
00:45:53,467 --> 00:45:55,533
I better catch up to the dogs.

655
00:45:55,633 --> 00:45:57,067
Nice to meet you.

656
00:45:57,133 --> 00:45:58,633
My pleasure.

657
00:45:58,733 --> 00:46:01,300
And, Natalie, you drop by
anytime you like, okay?

658
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,767
Yeah.

659
00:46:02,867 --> 00:46:05,800
She's a good worker.
See ya!

660
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,233
Hold on, guys!

661
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:13,500
Come on! Trapper!
Come on!

662
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,800
What the...

663
00:48:35,967 --> 00:48:37,100
What's wrong?

664
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,267
Nothing.

665
00:48:39,367 --> 00:48:41,533
You sense her.

666
00:48:41,633 --> 00:48:44,267
Don't you? I told you.
She's here.

667
00:48:46,067 --> 00:48:48,400
Where'd all this water
come from?

668
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,067
We'll stay up together tonight.

669
00:48:53,367 --> 00:48:54,800
What do you want, exactly?

670
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:58,100
No, Ted.
It's what you want.

671
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,767
You want Brenda Yancey's
farm, right?

672
00:49:00,867 --> 00:49:03,600
I can make that happen.

673
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:06,200
I'm the assistant
client funds manager

674
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:08,333
at the Ringwood
Savings and Loan downtown.

675
00:49:08,433 --> 00:49:10,233
I...

676
00:49:10,333 --> 00:49:12,533
I know things
that most people don't.

677
00:49:12,633 --> 00:49:14,067
Like?

678
00:49:14,133 --> 00:49:16,833
Like Brenda Yancey's a client,
and she's in deep trouble.

679
00:49:16,933 --> 00:49:19,567
Way behind on
her mortgage payments.

680
00:49:19,667 --> 00:49:24,733
I could maneuver a
foreclosure... for a fee.

681
00:49:24,833 --> 00:49:30,733
You know, Boyd, I think we maybe
able to do some business after all.

682
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:47,067
Well, Nat, I guess this is the case
of the watched pot never boiling.

683
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:50,433
Isn't that what Grandma
always used to say?

684
00:49:50,533 --> 00:49:52,467
All these old houses
are full of strange sounds.

685
00:49:52,567 --> 00:49:56,200
They're creaking and moving
all the time.

686
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,967
It's not the house.
It's not your mom.

687
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:03,733
Why do you think
your mom would come back?

688
00:50:03,833 --> 00:50:06,600
Because she knows.
Knows what?

689
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:08,433
So I can say goodbye.

690
00:50:08,533 --> 00:50:10,233
You said goodbye, Nat.

691
00:50:10,333 --> 00:50:13,433
I didn't say everything I needed
to. There wasn't enough time.

692
00:50:13,533 --> 00:50:16,700
I know that. So why
didn't you tell me sooner?

693
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,733
I know you think it was wrong.
Maybe it was.

694
00:50:19,833 --> 00:50:21,767
But I didn't tell you right away

695
00:50:21,867 --> 00:50:23,667
because your mother
asked me not to.

696
00:50:23,767 --> 00:50:27,033
We were just trying
to protect you.

697
00:50:27,133 --> 00:50:29,100
We did what we thought was best.

698
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:33,933
If you think that a decision
was wrong, I'm sorry.

699
00:50:34,033 --> 00:50:37,533
God knows at the time...

700
00:50:37,633 --> 00:50:39,500
it was hard to think at all.

701
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,767
You should've thought of me.

702
00:50:41,867 --> 00:50:44,633
I'm sorry.

703
00:50:46,967 --> 00:50:49,000
Let's get some sleep now.

704
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:50,800
You wanna come up now?

705
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,300
In a minute.

706
00:51:33,267 --> 00:51:35,400
Margaret?

707
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,600
Margaret, was it you
I was hearing?

708
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:48,967
What do you want?

709
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,500
No. Stay.

710
00:52:06,067 --> 00:52:08,233
Hey, when did you get a cat?

711
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:10,167
You saw a cat?

712
00:52:10,267 --> 00:52:11,667
Yeah.
Where?

713
00:52:11,767 --> 00:52:12,900
In the front window.

714
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:18,700
You're sure?

715
00:52:18,767 --> 00:52:20,800
It's gone now.

716
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:23,500
It looked sort of like Margaret.
It must have jumped down.

717
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:24,733
But you saw it!

718
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:27,633
Yeah. Quit psyching me out.

719
00:52:27,733 --> 00:52:29,233
You mean you didn't get a cat?

720
00:52:29,333 --> 00:52:32,800
At least I'm not
completely crazy.

721
00:52:34,933 --> 00:52:39,400
So ever since we moved in,
it's just been so weird.

722
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,067
Things going bump in the night,

723
00:52:41,133 --> 00:52:43,567
piano's playing,
pictures flying.

724
00:52:43,667 --> 00:52:45,867
It really freaked me out.

725
00:52:45,967 --> 00:52:49,300
I didn't really know
what to think.

726
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,433
Come on.
Don't look at me like that.

727
00:52:51,533 --> 00:52:53,100
I'm not crazy.

728
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,300
Crazy people don't know
when they're crazy.

729
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:58,967
Kurt, I saw Margaret. I saw
her ghost. It was a real ghost.

730
00:52:59,067 --> 00:53:00,167
Sure you did.

731
00:53:00,267 --> 00:53:02,133
I'm not lying.

732
00:53:02,233 --> 00:53:04,800
Kurt, I saw Margaret, too.

733
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:06,967
Don't you believe in ghosts?

734
00:53:07,067 --> 00:53:08,167
No.

735
00:53:08,267 --> 00:53:12,133
People die, they're gone.
Period, end of story.

736
00:53:13,233 --> 00:53:14,667
Hi, guys.

737
00:53:14,767 --> 00:53:18,233
Hi. You think your dad
might be at home?

738
00:53:18,333 --> 00:53:22,800
Yeah, he should be back
from the library by now. Why?

739
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:25,733
Good. I found this book I
thought he might be interested in.

740
00:53:25,833 --> 00:53:28,900
I can just take it home with
me. You don't have to bother.

741
00:53:29,067 --> 00:53:31,133
It's okay. I was on the
way to the bank anyway.

742
00:53:31,233 --> 00:53:33,433
It's no trouble.
See ya.

743
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,500
I've never seen Brenda
in clean jeans before.

744
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:41,233
She's dressed to impress.

745
00:53:41,333 --> 00:53:43,800
They're so cute at that age.

746
00:53:46,733 --> 00:53:50,067
Aww! Are we a little
possessive of daddy?

747
00:53:50,133 --> 00:53:52,900
Maybe you should go home.
They might need a chaperone.

748
00:53:53,067 --> 00:53:54,233
Sure!

749
00:53:57,533 --> 00:54:01,467
This is a great book.
This is great. Thank you.

750
00:54:01,567 --> 00:54:05,500
Good. I hope it helps.
I'm sure it will.

751
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,500
So are you in Ringwood
just for the research

752
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,867
or are you planning
to stay at all?

753
00:54:09,967 --> 00:54:12,867
Playing it by ear, I guess.

754
00:54:12,967 --> 00:54:17,933
I thought a change would be a
good thing for Natalie, for both of us.

755
00:54:19,367 --> 00:54:22,800
Natalie. That's a tough age
to lose your mother.

756
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:25,667
Yeah. Fifteen. Not the best time,
for sure.

757
00:54:25,767 --> 00:54:29,933
She was having a very
hard time dealing with it.

758
00:54:30,067 --> 00:54:31,433
We both were.

759
00:54:31,533 --> 00:54:36,667
So we decided
to get out of the city.

760
00:54:36,767 --> 00:54:39,200
New beginnings and all that.

761
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:43,067
I hope it was
the right thing to do.

762
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:44,733
I hope so, too.

763
00:54:44,833 --> 00:54:48,067
I have to go.
I'm... I'm late.

764
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:50,267
I've got a meeting downtown.

765
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:52,267
Anyway, um, enjoy.

766
00:54:52,367 --> 00:54:54,367
I will. Thank you.

767
00:54:55,467 --> 00:54:57,667
Thanks for the tea.

768
00:54:57,767 --> 00:54:59,300
My pleasure.

769
00:55:00,467 --> 00:55:03,933
So, this might not be
my place to ask,

770
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:05,933
but do you have
any plans for dinner?

771
00:55:06,067 --> 00:55:07,200
Tonight?

772
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,076
Yeah, or any other night.
Doesn't have to be...

773
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:11,067
No, no.
Tonight would be great.

774
00:55:11,167 --> 00:55:12,367
Yeah?
Yeah.

775
00:55:12,467 --> 00:55:15,267
Okay, good.

776
00:55:15,367 --> 00:55:17,600
I'll see you
around 8:00 then.

777
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:19,633
Sure. Thank you.

778
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:22,400
Great. Bye.

779
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,633
Bye.

780
00:55:25,867 --> 00:55:28,800
I know you don't
believe in ghosts.

781
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,900
But at first when it
all started happening,

782
00:55:34,067 --> 00:55:37,467
all the noises and stuff, I...

783
00:55:40,167 --> 00:55:42,067
Don't make fun of me, please.

784
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:46,867
I thought it was my mother.

785
00:55:50,767 --> 00:55:53,600
I really wanted it to be.

786
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:02,233
You've just met me. You
must think I'm really certifiable.

787
00:56:02,333 --> 00:56:06,867
Some of the coolest people in the world
were probably told that at some point.

788
00:56:08,633 --> 00:56:11,467
I guess I'll take that
as a compliment then.

789
00:56:16,267 --> 00:56:19,267
I just wish everything
could go back.

790
00:56:22,967 --> 00:56:25,567
Nothing seems the same.

791
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:54,867
Comfort.

792
00:57:00,967 --> 00:57:03,733
We've been floating you for
longer than we do most clients.

793
00:57:03,833 --> 00:57:06,767
I'm really sorry,
but unless you can pay the arrears in full,

794
00:57:06,867 --> 00:57:10,167
the bank has no choice. I
just need a little more time.

795
00:57:10,267 --> 00:57:13,300
The spring is so much better
for me. Donations go way up.

796
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,767
I don't get it.

797
00:57:14,867 --> 00:57:16,827
You've always been very
understanding in the past.

798
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:20,800
Brenda, it's not up to me.
I got a memo.

799
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:22,833
You have a week.

800
00:57:38,367 --> 00:57:39,833
Thanks anyway.

801
00:57:48,333 --> 00:57:51,200
Well done, Boyd.
You're my man.

802
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,367
I want my money!
Your money?

803
00:57:53,467 --> 00:57:55,833
No, no, no.

804
00:57:55,933 --> 00:57:59,833
When Brenda Yancey's off the property,
then you get your money.

805
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,433
There's only one way to
communicate. With what?

806
00:58:17,533 --> 00:58:20,267
The ghost. A seance.

807
00:58:20,367 --> 00:58:22,300
A seance?
You two are nuts.

808
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,300
Tonight.
Yeah, right.

809
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,433
Forget it.
I'll bring my Ouija board.

810
00:58:27,533 --> 00:58:31,067
Maybe you could bring
your crystal ball, too.

811
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:34,467
It's not gonna happen.
Come on. It'll be so cool.

812
00:58:34,567 --> 00:58:37,433
Right. I'll see you tomorrow.

813
00:58:37,533 --> 00:58:39,067
Tonight! A seance!

814
00:58:39,167 --> 00:58:41,100
There has to be a reason
Margaret's come back!

815
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,467
Ghosts always have a reason!

816
00:58:43,567 --> 00:58:46,067
Yeah. Okay, Pearson.
Whatever.

817
00:58:46,167 --> 00:58:47,200
They do!

818
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,500
Later.

819
00:58:50,667 --> 00:58:52,633
Comfort!

820
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:59,067
Hi.
Hi. Have fun today?

821
00:58:59,167 --> 00:59:00,733
Yeah.

822
00:59:00,833 --> 00:59:04,733
Brenda tells me she really
appreciates your help over there.

823
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:08,067
She dropped that by
today. It's a great book.

824
00:59:11,867 --> 00:59:14,367
Brenda asked me to have
dinner with her tonight.

825
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:16,367
No problem.

826
00:59:16,467 --> 00:59:17,967
You sure?

827
00:59:18,067 --> 00:59:21,233
Yeah. Go. I might
do something with Pearson.

828
00:59:21,333 --> 00:59:23,133
Great.

829
00:59:23,233 --> 00:59:24,367
I won't be late.

830
00:59:24,467 --> 00:59:25,900
I'll be fine.

831
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:32,667
First the neighbors are
up in arms, now the bank.

832
00:59:32,767 --> 00:59:36,067
You know, it honestly wouldn't surprise
me if he was in cahoots with them.

833
00:59:36,167 --> 00:59:37,567
Riker?

834
00:59:37,667 --> 00:59:43,067
Don't get me started.
He just wants me gone.

835
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:46,233
But then I think
of Mrs. Ashboro.

836
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:50,333
I know she would've wanted me to
hang in there, so that's what I'm gonna do.

837
00:59:50,433 --> 00:59:52,567
Good.

838
00:59:52,667 --> 00:59:54,700
I can see this means
a lot to you.

839
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:59,267
The animal shelter is the only thing I've
ever wanted to do since I was a little girl.

840
00:59:59,367 --> 01:00:03,033
Let me tell you something. I'm a lot
better with animals than I am with people.

841
01:00:03,133 --> 01:00:06,133
I wouldn't say that.

842
01:00:08,233 --> 01:00:10,467
Natalie thinks the world of you.

843
01:00:10,567 --> 01:00:15,033
Natalie's a very special girl.
You've done a good job.

844
01:00:15,133 --> 01:00:18,500
My wife gets the credit for
that. I'm just trying to carry on.

845
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:21,500
Well, you're doing
something right.

846
01:01:00,567 --> 01:01:05,100
Spirit, come to us now.

847
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,600
Make your presence known to us.

848
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:12,333
Come from the great
other world to join us.

849
01:01:12,433 --> 01:01:14,467
We need to speak to you now.

850
01:01:16,433 --> 01:01:18,100
Boo!

851
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,067
Jeez, can you knock'?

852
01:01:20,167 --> 01:01:22,633
Thought I'd join the party.

853
01:01:26,733 --> 01:01:29,067
Spirit.

854
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:31,833
Sorry for the interruption.

855
01:01:31,933 --> 01:01:34,700
Come to us now.

856
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:38,300
Come on! Get into it
or it won't work.

857
01:01:40,233 --> 01:01:42,233
Spirit,

858
01:01:42,333 --> 01:01:45,533
make your presence known to us.

859
01:01:45,633 --> 01:01:48,767
Come from the great
otherworld to join us.

860
01:01:48,867 --> 01:01:51,900
Come on.
The great otherworld?

861
01:01:52,067 --> 01:01:53,500
You're not helping.

862
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:56,233
This is so lame.
Then go home.

863
01:01:56,333 --> 01:01:58,933
No. I can do this.

864
01:02:03,333 --> 01:02:06,100
Spirits of the night.

865
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,333
Great feline spirit.

866
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:10,367
Come to us now.

867
01:02:10,467 --> 01:02:13,333
Let us know that you are there.

868
01:02:13,433 --> 01:02:15,300
Come on, guys!

869
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,400
Okay.

870
01:02:16,433 --> 01:02:18,233
Okay, um...

871
01:02:19,933 --> 01:02:22,167
Please, spirit.

872
01:02:24,467 --> 01:02:26,933
We want to talk to you.

873
01:02:28,767 --> 01:02:31,167
We want you to contact us.

874
01:02:31,267 --> 01:02:33,767
Great spirit.

875
01:02:36,367 --> 01:02:37,933
You're not concentrating.

876
01:02:38,067 --> 01:02:40,067
I give up!
This is totally bogus.

877
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:42,433
It's not working, Pearson.
It never works!

878
01:02:42,533 --> 01:02:44,467
You have to believe
to make it work.

879
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:58,167
Margaret.

880
01:03:10,167 --> 01:03:12,133
My God.

881
01:03:39,633 --> 01:03:41,300
I don't believe this.

882
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:56,367
Cat food?

883
01:03:56,467 --> 01:03:58,433
That's all she wanted.

884
01:04:00,567 --> 01:04:02,167
Cat food.

885
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:08,800
So here's the question.

886
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:11,100
Why would Margaret haunt you
for a bag of food?

887
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,533
Ghosts can't be hungry.

888
01:04:12,633 --> 01:04:15,500
There's no way it was just
a bag of food she wanted.

889
01:04:20,933 --> 01:04:22,467
My God.

890
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:24,200
Money!

891
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:27,067
This is what she
wanted me to find.

892
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:29,733
Margaret, you are
the most wonderful cat!

893
01:04:35,867 --> 01:04:38,933
Natalie, what are
you guys doing in here?

894
01:04:42,667 --> 01:04:46,533
"I can't stand by and watch such a
dear friend be pulled in all directions.

895
01:04:46,633 --> 01:04:51,133
I've always intended to leave you and
your wonderful cause a healthy donation,

896
01:04:51,233 --> 01:04:54,067
but what better time than now
when you truly need it.

897
01:04:54,133 --> 01:04:56,300
Love to you, Brenda.

898
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,800
Mrs. Ashboro and Margaret."

899
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:01,500
How could she be so amazing?

900
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,733
Wes, I can buy the farm!

901
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:06,067
I can pay the mortgage off!

902
01:05:07,333 --> 01:05:10,833
I can't believe it!
How did you find it?

903
01:05:10,933 --> 01:05:12,633
Margaret showed us.

904
01:05:12,733 --> 01:05:15,267
Margaret?
Don't ask.

905
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:20,167
I'll be home later, Dad Thanks!

906
01:05:20,267 --> 01:05:22,200
Don't be late, okay?

907
01:05:40,767 --> 01:05:43,600
Are these yours?
How did they get out?

908
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:47,867
Kurt put them in their pen
inside the barn last night, right?

909
01:05:47,967 --> 01:05:49,467
Yes.

910
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:51,633
Jen, then there's no way
they could've gotten out.

911
01:05:51,733 --> 01:05:54,767
Well, they did.

912
01:05:54,867 --> 01:05:57,600
Take them inside
and give them some food.

913
01:05:58,967 --> 01:06:00,933
I gotta warn you, Brenda.

914
01:06:01,067 --> 01:06:04,267
There's a petition going around
in town to close you down.

915
01:06:04,367 --> 01:06:07,200
I know who started that.
I can't help you.

916
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:10,133
In the last month,
I've had a half dozen complaints.

917
01:06:10,233 --> 01:06:13,967
Animals going loose,
scaring people. getting into their garbage.

918
01:06:14,067 --> 01:06:15,967
You're at the critical stage.

919
01:06:16,067 --> 01:06:18,067
What does that mean?

920
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,700
It means if there are
any more serious complaints,

921
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,633
I'm gonna have to shut you down.

922
01:06:26,333 --> 01:06:28,100
I'm real sorry.

923
01:06:31,767 --> 01:06:34,233
I don't believe this.

924
01:06:34,333 --> 01:06:37,233
You win one battle,
and you lose another.

925
01:06:42,567 --> 01:06:44,467
I just don't want you
to get messed up again.

926
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:46,700
You could go to jail.

927
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:50,367
I'm not going anywhere. I
swear I didn't let the dogs out.

928
01:06:50,467 --> 01:06:52,700
You swore you didn't
set that fire, too.

929
01:06:58,333 --> 01:06:59,633
Natalie!

930
01:07:01,767 --> 01:07:04,333
I'm going to the bank. If
you leave before I get back,

931
01:07:04,433 --> 01:07:06,743
please, please make sure
everything's inside and closed up.

932
01:07:06,767 --> 01:07:07,867
Okay.

933
01:07:07,967 --> 01:07:10,067
I'm serious, Kurt,
or we're history.

934
01:07:10,167 --> 01:07:12,633
I'll put a lock on the door.

935
01:07:12,733 --> 01:07:14,467
Okay, thanks.

936
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:18,067
Thanks, Terry.

937
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:25,100
You just deposited
$50,000! I know. Boyd...

938
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,567
Brenda, that's my money!
I knew it. I knew you had it.

939
01:07:27,667 --> 01:07:30,767
Your aunt left it to me. I will
have the bank freeze the funds,

940
01:07:30,867 --> 01:07:33,043
and, Brenda, I will sue you to the
ends of the earth. I have a letter.

941
01:07:33,067 --> 01:07:35,233
I have written proof.
So what?

942
01:07:35,333 --> 01:07:36,933
She wasn't of sound mind.

943
01:07:37,067 --> 01:07:40,367
She was of sounder mind
than you, Boyd.

944
01:07:44,567 --> 01:07:47,467
I did what I said I would do.

945
01:07:47,567 --> 01:07:51,267
I can't help it if she paid
it off. I want my money.

946
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:53,567
Your plan didn't work.
You didn't deliver.

947
01:07:53,667 --> 01:07:56,067
I want my money. Now!

948
01:07:56,167 --> 01:07:58,767
Not until
she's off the property.

949
01:07:58,867 --> 01:08:00,633
If I get you Brenda's land,

950
01:08:00,733 --> 01:08:02,809
it'll make your little
development deal worth millions.

951
01:08:02,833 --> 01:08:06,233
If. If you get her off.

952
01:08:06,333 --> 01:08:08,233
That's big if, Boyd.

953
01:08:08,333 --> 01:08:10,867
I'll get rid of her.
I promise you.

954
01:08:10,967 --> 01:08:12,667
I know the right buttons
to push.

955
01:08:12,767 --> 01:08:17,933
I can do a lot more damage than
letting her dogs out, Riker, believe me.

956
01:08:18,067 --> 01:08:19,233
Much more.

957
01:08:19,333 --> 01:08:22,100
Okay. You do it.

958
01:10:07,933 --> 01:10:08,967
Margaret?

959
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,367
Wait!

960
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:30,400
Margaret,
where are you taking me?

961
01:10:57,567 --> 01:11:00,100
Natalie, what are you doing
here? You've gotta get out!

962
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:02,800
No! Natalie,
you've got to get out of here!

963
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:04,833
What are you doing?

964
01:11:04,933 --> 01:11:07,267
You got to open the barn door!

965
01:11:07,367 --> 01:11:10,500
Put this over
your mouth and nose!

966
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:31,067
Who's in there?

967
01:11:31,133 --> 01:11:32,867
Kurt, is that you?

968
01:11:32,967 --> 01:11:34,667
What's going on?

969
01:11:34,767 --> 01:11:36,600
Natalie!

970
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:40,233
What are you two doing in here?

971
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:49,767
Okay, so what were you
really doing in there?

972
01:11:49,867 --> 01:11:51,533
Like I told Brenda,

973
01:11:51,633 --> 01:11:54,367
I thought someone might try
and let the animals out again.

974
01:11:54,467 --> 01:11:56,433
I decided to check it out.

975
01:11:56,533 --> 01:12:01,100
The barn was full of
fumes when I got here.

976
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:05,067
Look, I don't know what you heard Pearson
and I talking about the other day...

977
01:12:05,133 --> 01:12:06,667
I'll tell you what I heard.

978
01:12:06,767 --> 01:12:08,809
That Pearson thinks you're
the one letting the animals out,

979
01:12:08,833 --> 01:12:10,833
and that you might
have to go to jail.

980
01:12:10,933 --> 01:12:13,933
I didn't let the animals out,
and I don't have to go to jail.

981
01:12:14,067 --> 01:12:16,633
Then what about the fire?

982
01:12:16,733 --> 01:12:19,600
He said something about
you setting a fire.

983
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:22,333
So I went a little crazy
after my mom died.

984
01:12:22,433 --> 01:12:25,533
I set fire to some guy's dump,
and it got out of control.

985
01:12:25,633 --> 01:12:28,067
I got mandatory
community service.

986
01:12:28,133 --> 01:12:30,167
That's why
I'm working at Brenda's.

987
01:12:30,267 --> 01:12:33,067
So you're forced to work here?

988
01:12:33,133 --> 01:12:38,467
No, I'm not forced. That's
just the way it started.

989
01:12:38,567 --> 01:12:40,900
I used up my hours long ago.

990
01:12:41,067 --> 01:12:43,433
I just stayed.

991
01:12:43,533 --> 01:12:47,700
So why didn't you just tell me?

992
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:51,500
Like I'm gonna tell you I'm a juvenile
delinquent the moment I meet you.

993
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,533
Clearly that would
impress a girl, right?

994
01:12:56,833 --> 01:12:59,400
So you wanted to impress me?

995
01:13:00,833 --> 01:13:03,467
I didn't know
what to do with you.

996
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:16,067
Brenda doesn't want me back.

997
01:13:16,133 --> 01:13:19,333
She thinks I did it.

998
01:13:19,433 --> 01:13:21,667
I didn't. I swear.

999
01:13:22,933 --> 01:13:24,667
I know.

1000
01:13:24,767 --> 01:13:27,100
There's no way that happened
by accident tonight.

1001
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:30,300
Somebody did it deliberately,
and I have to find out who.

1002
01:13:32,267 --> 01:13:34,067
And I'll help you.

1003
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:40,333
It's obvious someone
is out to get me. I...

1004
01:13:40,433 --> 01:13:42,567
I can't believe it's Kurt,
but on the other hand,

1005
01:13:42,667 --> 01:13:46,167
I can't afford to take any
chances. It's got to be Riker.

1006
01:13:46,267 --> 01:13:49,867
He'd do anything to
get rid of me. I just...

1007
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:53,200
I can't take this anymore.
You don't want to give up now.

1008
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:56,067
You don't understand. The animals
could have been asphyxiated.

1009
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:58,800
I'm supposed to protect them,
not put them in harm's way.

1010
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:02,767
What I can do to help?
I don't need any help!

1011
01:14:02,867 --> 01:14:05,067
I'm fine on my own! I...

1012
01:14:06,567 --> 01:14:09,800
I'm just used
to being on my own.

1013
01:14:21,367 --> 01:14:24,200
What were you doing over here
in the middle of the night?

1014
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:27,400
Do you realize how dangerous it
was? Margaret came and got me.

1015
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:29,100
Margaret got you.

1016
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:31,743
Yeah, and it's a good thing she
did. If Kurt and I hadn't been here...

1017
01:14:31,767 --> 01:14:34,967
Be careful around Kurt.
You don't know him very well.

1018
01:14:35,067 --> 01:14:37,467
You don't really know
Brenda either.

1019
01:14:40,967 --> 01:14:43,133
Let's go home.

1020
01:14:53,133 --> 01:14:56,100
Brenda.
It's a beautiful day.

1021
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:59,043
I thought I'd drop in and see if you
had time to consider my latest offer.

1022
01:14:59,067 --> 01:15:00,533
It's pretty darn generous.

1023
01:15:00,633 --> 01:15:02,443
I know what you've been doing,
and it's not gonna work.

1024
01:15:02,467 --> 01:15:03,900
What are you talking about?

1025
01:15:04,067 --> 01:15:06,900
I'm not selling the farm to
you now or anytime soon.

1026
01:15:07,067 --> 01:15:11,800
If you ever set foot on my property again,
you are going to regret it.

1027
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,733
That's a threat, Ms. Yancey.

1028
01:15:16,833 --> 01:15:19,200
Yes, it is, Mr. Riker.

1029
01:15:29,733 --> 01:15:31,467
You idiot!

1030
01:15:31,567 --> 01:15:33,767
Whatever you did,
it didn't work!

1031
01:15:33,867 --> 01:15:38,067
Now, if you want your 50,000,
it's time to get serious.

1032
01:15:38,167 --> 01:15:42,267
If I don't close this deal, my backers in New
York are never gonna give me another penny.

1033
01:15:42,367 --> 01:15:46,233
I'll be trashed, so we're in this together,
Boyd, you understand?

1034
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:49,233
And it's time to take care
of business once for all.

1035
01:15:53,267 --> 01:15:55,600
Hey, how's it going?

1036
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:57,667
So big day tomorrow?

1037
01:15:57,767 --> 01:16:00,200
The auditors are in,
just down the hall,

1038
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:03,067
and I heard apparently they
already have a pretty good idea

1039
01:16:03,167 --> 01:16:05,933
who's been doing a little
embezzling on the side.

1040
01:16:06,067 --> 01:16:07,700
Lots of excitement, Boyd?

1041
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:08,900
See ya.

1042
01:16:35,067 --> 01:16:36,500
Hi.

1043
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:09,300
Just in here.

1044
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:21,933
Now what?

1045
01:17:24,067 --> 01:17:25,867
Now we wait.

1046
01:17:37,733 --> 01:17:41,067
All those months,
I didn't even know she was sick.

1047
01:17:41,133 --> 01:17:43,367
I went to school, I came home,

1048
01:17:43,467 --> 01:17:45,500
I did my homework,
I went out with my friends,

1049
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:48,533
and I wasted it all.

1050
01:17:48,633 --> 01:17:50,367
You know, I could've
been with her.

1051
01:17:50,467 --> 01:17:53,700
I could've...
spent time with her,

1052
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:57,300
and it wasn't fair.

1053
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:59,800
I don't know. I think they
were really trying to protect you.

1054
01:17:59,833 --> 01:18:01,800
Yeah, but it's like
they lied to me.

1055
01:18:01,900 --> 01:18:05,667
That's not like a lie. Okay,
well, then they pretended.

1056
01:18:05,767 --> 01:18:09,567
And all of a sudden,
it was too late.

1057
01:18:09,667 --> 01:18:13,200
You can say a lot
in a few weeks.

1058
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:16,167
At least you got to say goodbye.

1059
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:54,333
Come on.

1060
01:19:08,767 --> 01:19:11,833
Okay, Boyd, all along here.

1061
01:19:14,567 --> 01:19:16,167
Really soak it.

1062
01:19:47,867 --> 01:19:49,800
Okay, that's enough!

1063
01:20:06,933 --> 01:20:10,767
Don't just stand there!
Come on, Boyd!

1064
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:17,200
My God.
Kurt, it's Boyd!

1065
01:20:21,533 --> 01:20:24,300
Hurry! We've gotta
get the animals out!

1066
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:32,333
Out! Go! Come on!
Run! Out! Go!

1067
01:20:34,333 --> 01:20:39,200
Come on! Come on!
Move it!

1068
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:40,500
Grab the kitten.

1069
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:45,533
Okay, I got that one!

1070
01:21:23,367 --> 01:21:24,900
Margaret?

1071
01:21:31,733 --> 01:21:33,267
No.

1072
01:21:33,367 --> 01:21:36,467
What's left? This is the
last one! Let's go now!

1073
01:21:40,867 --> 01:21:43,267
Come here.

1074
01:21:50,167 --> 01:21:53,467
What happened?
Boyd torched the place!

1075
01:21:53,567 --> 01:21:56,067
How bad is it inside?
We got the animals out!

1076
01:21:59,067 --> 01:22:01,433
I'm stuck!!
Kurt, help!

1077
01:22:01,533 --> 01:22:03,700
I'm coming!
What are you doing, Kurt!

1078
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:05,400
Be careful!

1079
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:07,333
Natalie, are you okay?

1080
01:22:07,433 --> 01:22:08,567
Kurt, help!
Get it out!

1081
01:22:15,067 --> 01:22:17,067
God! Just slow down!

1082
01:22:17,133 --> 01:22:20,800
What are you doing? Just pull
over and give me my money!

1083
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:23,900
I need the money! I've got
auditors coming in tomorrow!

1084
01:22:24,067 --> 01:22:26,100
You still don't get it,
do you, Boyd?

1085
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:28,100
I don't have two cents
to rub together,

1086
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:31,633
and I don't get any money
either until this deal is closed.

1087
01:22:31,733 --> 01:22:33,500
Slow down!

1088
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,300
Get it off!

1089
01:22:45,267 --> 01:22:46,967
Get it off me! Aah!

1090
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:00,567
Hurry! Please! Hurry!

1091
01:23:02,967 --> 01:23:05,233
Let's go!

1092
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:09,400
Watch out! Get back!

1093
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:14,467
Where are you going?

1094
01:23:14,567 --> 01:23:16,133
Kurt!

1095
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:22,900
What are you doing? We
have to get out of here, Kurt!

1096
01:23:23,067 --> 01:23:24,933
Natalie, come here!

1097
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:32,267
Kurt! Natalie!
Answer me!

1098
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:36,667
Where's Natalie?
She's inside with Kurt!

1099
01:23:36,767 --> 01:23:37,767
Natalie!

1100
01:23:37,833 --> 01:23:39,133
Go!

1101
01:23:50,433 --> 01:23:53,533
Get clear.
Watch your back!

1102
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:12,333
Looks like two of them.

1103
01:24:12,433 --> 01:24:15,200
I'll check the passenger.
All right.

1104
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:17,833
Look at the scratches
on his face.

1105
01:24:20,067 --> 01:24:21,800
This guy's coming around.

1106
01:24:24,367 --> 01:24:27,233
Driver's gonna be okay.

1107
01:24:27,333 --> 01:24:30,333
Windshield didn't shatter.
Weird?

1108
01:24:36,067 --> 01:24:37,733
You got him?

1109
01:24:37,833 --> 01:24:39,100
There.

1110
01:24:43,767 --> 01:24:47,067
So Boyd is up to his eyeballs
in charges:

1111
01:24:47,167 --> 01:24:49,967
mischief, arson,
fraud, the works.

1112
01:24:50,067 --> 01:24:53,600
And Riker's finally
out of my hair for good,

1113
01:24:53,700 --> 01:24:57,167
and the insurance is
gonna rebuild the barn.

1114
01:24:57,267 --> 01:24:59,267
Cheers.
Cheers!

1115
01:24:59,367 --> 01:25:02,300
And here's to Margaret,
the most amazing cat in the world.

1116
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,767
May she rest in peace.

1117
01:25:04,867 --> 01:25:06,133
To Margaret.

1118
01:25:06,233 --> 01:25:07,233
To Margaret.

1119
01:25:07,267 --> 01:25:08,900
To Margaret.
To Margaret.

1120
01:25:09,067 --> 01:25:12,167
Even though I never saw her.

1121
01:25:12,267 --> 01:25:14,667
I give up!

1122
01:25:14,767 --> 01:25:18,633
How can you not believe
something I saw with my own eyes?

1123
01:25:18,733 --> 01:25:21,200
Easy. You were dreaming.
Was not.

1124
01:25:29,467 --> 01:25:31,767
Do you see her?

1125
01:25:31,867 --> 01:25:33,067
Yeah.

1126
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:43,967
I do. I do see her.

1127
01:25:44,067 --> 01:25:46,067
Thank you, Margaret.

1128
01:26:41,733 --> 01:26:44,667
