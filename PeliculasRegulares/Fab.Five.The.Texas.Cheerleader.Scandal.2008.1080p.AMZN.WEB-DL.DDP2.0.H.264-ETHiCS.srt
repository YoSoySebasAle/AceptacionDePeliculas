1
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:07,201
Brooke...

2
00:01:07,235 --> 00:01:09,370
Whoa,
another terrific half-time show.

3
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:12,773
Ladies, thank you so much.

4
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:15,643
They always put on a great one.
Don't they, fellas?

5
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:18,412
All right,
our Jackson high hornets

6
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:21,291
are gonna be back on the court in just a few
more minutes. Good job. Nice, ladies. Nice.

7
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:23,427
And remember, guys, we have
our big championship right here,

8
00:01:23,451 --> 00:01:26,754
home court, next Saturday.

9
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:29,390
And if I were you,
I would get your...

10
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:32,126
Brooke, why did you
deliberately block her?

11
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,895
You knew Megan was supposed
to have the last tumble.

12
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,764
Look, I'm really sorry,
coach hanley.

13
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:38,566
I just didn't want her
to mess it up.

14
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:42,170
And how many times
have I told you

15
00:01:42,203 --> 00:01:43,804
not to primp
in front of the crowd?

16
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,773
Hand it over.

17
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:47,241
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:47,275 --> 00:01:48,518
You know what? You're right.
I don't need it.

19
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:51,445
But, I mean, you could
really use some help.

20
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,813
So, here, take this.

21
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,548
And this.

22
00:01:56,184 --> 00:01:58,852
Do you see how the lip color
matches my nail Polish?

23
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:14,335
So, how did they do?

24
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:16,837
Lorene, enough's enough.

25
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,372
I quit.

26
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:24,745
Here they are,

27
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:26,390
back again on the court,
our mighty hornets.

28
00:02:26,414 --> 00:02:29,483
Come on.
Let's hear it for them.

29
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:46,300
Welcome to Jackson high.

30
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:48,902
Hi.

31
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:52,306
Your college professors
have given you glowing praises.

32
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,674
I have to give you a hug.

33
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,809
You are my fairy godmother.

34
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:58,546
To teach and coach...
This is a dream job.

35
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:00,457
Jumping in in the middle of the
semester's gonna be a challenge.

36
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:02,216
I'm up for it.

37
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,784
The squad is practicing
right now.

38
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:04,785
Shall we meet them?

39
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:06,720
I'd love to.
Okay.

40
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,761
come on, girls! Nice!

41
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:15,496
Good work.

42
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,332
These girls are really talented.

43
00:03:18,366 --> 00:03:21,269
They can fling themselves around
all right.

44
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:22,903
Nice!

45
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:24,405
Hey, b.L.T.!

46
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:26,407
Hey. "B.L.T."...
That's my nickname.

47
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,310
Blazin' lorene tippit.

48
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:31,679
We're all about girl power,
aren't we, ladies?

49
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:37,685
So, let's see, this is Brooke,
jeri, Lisa, Tabitha, Ashley...

50
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,853
Wait, you'll never remember
all these names.

51
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,290
Let me just introduce you.
This is Emma carr.

52
00:03:42,323 --> 00:03:44,625
She's taking over miss hanley's
world geography class.

53
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:46,894
She's also
your new cheerleading coach.

54
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:47,528
Hi, I'm Megan Harper.

55
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,463
It's nice to meet you.

56
00:03:49,497 --> 00:03:50,607
You ladies will be happy to know

57
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:53,501
that coach carr has extensive
cheerleading experience.

58
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:55,869
Our last coach
didn't know the difference

59
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,305
between a herkie and a hurdler.

60
00:03:57,338 --> 00:03:58,439
Well, I do.

61
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:00,908
And that was a difficult reload
you guys pulled off.

62
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,276
Who choreographed that?

63
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,945
That'd be be.

64
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:06,514
I'm impressed.

65
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:08,882
Well, I see that you all
are in good hands.

66
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,352
I've got a meeting
with the superintendent.

67
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:12,420
Mom?

68
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:17,325
Say "hi" to
superintendent tompkins for US.

69
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,426
Okay.

70
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,060
Principal tippit
is your mom?

71
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,563
Yeah. It's a cross
I've learned to bear.

72
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,434
Can I see
what you guys were doing?

73
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:27,968
Sure.

74
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,084
Hi, I'm Emma carr.

75
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,487
I'm taking over
miss hanley's class.

76
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,589
Nice to meet you.

77
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:51,792
Hi.
Nice to meet you.

78
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:52,825
Hey.

79
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:58,399
Adam reeve, tennis coach,
little u.S. History on the side.

80
00:04:58,432 --> 00:04:59,676
Tennis coach.
I'm the new cheerleading coach.

81
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:04,505
So, lorene hired herself
another sacrifice.

82
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:07,408
Have you had
a "fab five" encounter yet?

83
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:08,609
A "fab five"?

84
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:13,747
Yeah, fab five,
Satan's cheerleaders.

85
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:17,050
You think I'm kidding.

86
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:18,419
This is Helen durant,

87
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:19,920
the other
world-geography teacher.

88
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:21,021
Emma... I'm sorry...

89
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,055
Carr.
Carr.

90
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:23,123
Nice to meet you.

91
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,825
New cheerleading coach.

92
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,960
Wow, look how young she is.

93
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,996
Are you going to start a pool?

94
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,730
I think it's a must.

95
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:31,532
Put me down for four weeks.

96
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:33,901
I'm gonna give her five.

97
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:36,036
You guys are betting
on how long I'm gonna last?

98
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,647
Nothing personal, honey,
but those cheerleaders

99
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,841
have been through four coaches
already this year.

100
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:43,477
Yeah, and that last one lasted,
what, three weeks?

101
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:44,721
So, actually,
we're being very generous

102
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:47,147
in our expectations of you.

103
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:51,719
Why don't I get in on that pool?

104
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:00,728
Hey, how'd it go?

105
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:03,497
Well, I only saw them
for a couple minutes,

106
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:05,799
but what I did see, Tim...
They were good.

107
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,801
They were really sloppy,
and they had no Polish.

108
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:11,405
But I have some incredible
athletes to work with.

109
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,205
That's great.

110
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:15,709
So, no regrets moving here?

111
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:17,177
Well, I miss my mom.

112
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,080
I miss my morning runs
with Heather.

113
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,616
I miss US going to church
with John and Anita.

114
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:25,052
You want to head back home?

115
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:26,053
No.

116
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:31,959
I want to see my husband
get his master's degree.

117
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:34,762
Then what did you have planned?

118
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:37,698
Maybe making my mama
a grandmama.

119
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,767
Why don't you
take that coat off?

120
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,169
Why don't you?

121
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:00,120
You know what?
I am totally spanked.

122
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,189
I do not want to deal
with reeve's class today.

123
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:04,157
Let's just ditch.
I'm down.

124
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,227
I didn't finish my stupid paper
on stupid mccarthyism.

125
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,662
I'm not ditching.

126
00:07:08,696 --> 00:07:11,164
I can deal with coach reeve
any time, any day.

127
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:13,767
Look, I took this picture of him
yesterday.

128
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:16,103
Lisa, what are you,
his stalker now?

129
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:16,904
Shut up.
He's hot.

130
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,873
Um, even if his junk
was on fire,

131
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:21,074
he still wouldn't be hot.

132
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,578
You're just jealous.

133
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:26,213
You know what?
Please, stop drooling.

134
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:27,815
You're gonna get my shoes wet.

135
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:29,683
Let's go.

136
00:07:29,717 --> 00:07:30,794
Let's go, dude.

137
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:33,987
Bye.
Bye, guys.

138
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:36,156
Hold up.
I thought we were ditching.

139
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,858
I turning my paper in first.

140
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:40,169
It's perfect, and I'm not gonna
let him take any points off.

141
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:41,313
Are you serious?
I'm serious.

142
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:46,934
Hey, coach reeve.
Here's my paper... on time.

143
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,770
You know, again, I'm really
sorry I can't stay for class.

144
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,506
I'm certain you can, Brooke.

145
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,707
Go sit down.

146
00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:55,743
Wait, I thought you knew.

147
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:58,546
Cheerleading tryouts
are next week,

148
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:00,824
and coach carr asked me to help
her put together a schedule.

149
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:02,115
She told me this morning

150
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,585
she was on her way
to put a note in your box.

151
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:05,929
Well, there was no note
in my box, so go sit down.

152
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:08,121
You know what?
It's probably there right now.

153
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,289
I'll go get it.

154
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,525
And, you know, jeri's
supposed to come with me, too.

155
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:16,964
Well, aren't you
going with them?

156
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,699
No.

157
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:19,733
I'm staying here...

158
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,571
with you.

159
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:38,719
That'd be so cool.

160
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:42,923
Brooke, thank you.

161
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:43,924
So, we saw in one
of your magazines

162
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:47,094
you can apply
to be cheerleader of the month

163
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:47,661
and actually get on the cover
and everything.

164
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:52,365
Yeah, you can.

165
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,735
You get more than that, though.
You get scholarship money.

166
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:55,903
You girls should apply.

167
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:56,946
I'll write you a letter
of recommendation.

168
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,672
You know what?

169
00:08:58,706 --> 00:09:00,083
I'll bet if I was on the cover
of cheerleading today,

170
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:01,685
the usc song girls
would totally take me.

171
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:03,977
You want to be a song girl?

172
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:05,913
That's great.
I mean, I've seen them perform.

173
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:07,748
They're amazing. I
know. And you know what?

174
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:09,258
They also live in L.A.,
which is where my dad lives.

175
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,194
She keeps begging him
to let her go live with him,

176
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,797
but he doesn't have room,
'cause he's got this new kid... excuse me.

177
00:09:13,821 --> 00:09:16,957
My dad cannot wait
for me to get out there.

178
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,326
You know, he said
if I get into usc,

179
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,270
he's gonna add a room
onto his house just for me.

180
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:24,598
Wait, why aren't you girls
in your third period?

181
00:09:24,632 --> 00:09:25,999
Coach reeve let US go early.

182
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:27,367
We just wanted to come here

183
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,336
and help you schedule practice
for tryouts.

184
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:30,771
I mean, you said you wanted

185
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,215
to give US
some individual help, so...

186
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:36,343
Yeah, I did. I just thought
maybe after school.

187
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:38,211
Let me look.
What about today?

188
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,147
I can work with you guys today.

189
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,950
What do you need help with?
Choreography? Tumbling?

190
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:44,284
What?
Well, forget tumbling.

191
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:45,361
I'm not gonna tumble anyway.

192
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:47,788
I don't think you have
a choice, though, jeri.

193
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:49,156
The constitution says

194
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:51,267
you have to do a back handspring
to get on the squad.

195
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,926
I'm sorry.
I guess you don't know.

196
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,895
I was in a horrible car accident
in October,

197
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,129
and I have a doctor's note

198
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:57,865
that says
I'm not supposed to tumble.

199
00:09:57,898 --> 00:09:59,767
You know,
plus it messes up her hair.

200
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,302
Shut up.

201
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:05,005
Well, I will talk
to principal tippit about it

202
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:07,240
and see
if we can make an exception.

203
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,276
But I can't make any promises.

204
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,848
Hi.
Is principal tippit available?

205
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:18,686
Yeah, she is.
Great, thanks.

206
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:21,088
Hey, Mr. Spretnik.

207
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:26,293
So, what'd you do
this time, reeve?

208
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:28,061
Just trying to get Brooke
and her gang

209
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:29,029
transferred
out of my class again.

210
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:32,232
You really have it in
for my cheerleaders.

211
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:33,667
No, only five of them.

212
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:35,368
Emma carr.

213
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:36,804
Come on in.
Great.

214
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:44,978
I have been hearing
incredible things

215
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:46,213
about how you're doing.

216
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:47,280
Really?

217
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:48,682
You're a natural teacher.

218
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:49,917
You have an air of confidence.

219
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:53,286
And that's what these kids
really respond to. Thank you.

220
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,323
Excuse.
Pamela Blackburn to see you.

221
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:57,991
Is that
jeri Blackburn's mother?

222
00:10:58,025 --> 00:10:59,035
'Cause that's why
I actually came in here,

223
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:00,961
to talk to you about jeri.

224
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,763
Lorene.

225
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:03,897
Excuse me.

226
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:06,466
I've got a bone to pick with you

227
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,201
over your new
cheerleading coach.

228
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:10,303
Um, I'm coach carr.

229
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,406
Did you tell my daughter

230
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,809
she's not gonna
make the squad next year

231
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:17,403
because her doctor
won't let her tumble?

232
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:21,749
N-No.
That's not what I said.

233
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:24,351
I did, however, explain to her
the constitutional...

234
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:25,953
I don't care about that.

235
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:28,088
You're not gonna keep jeri
off the squad

236
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:30,290
for something
that isn't even her fault.

237
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:32,168
I'll take you and this school
to court if I have to.

238
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:37,030
Now, Pam, no need to put
the fear of god into my staff.

239
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:39,933
Coach carr was just telling me
about jeri's predicament.

240
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:42,235
We will get a committee together
with our n.C.A. Rep

241
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:43,379
and ray studdard
at central office,

242
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:45,472
and we'll come up... lorene,
I need to know what...

243
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:47,908
I need to let coach carr
get back to class,

244
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:50,210
and then I'll answer any
of the questions that you have.

245
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,246
I'll calm her down.

246
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,448
Our girls have been friends
for years.

247
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:56,917
You just keep up the good work.

248
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,452
Okay.

249
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:00,854
Thank you.
Okay.

250
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:07,060
1, 2...

251
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:16,469
whoo!

252
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:22,242
Thank you, Megan.

253
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:23,944
I'm never gonna live up to that.

254
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:26,446
Yes, you can, Cindy.

255
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,281
You need to stop biting
your nails and relax.

256
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:29,983
You're not competing
with your sister.

257
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:31,184
They want to see your best.

258
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:33,353
Tabitha doering!

259
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:35,188
Whoo!
Yay, Tabitha!

260
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:37,958
Whoo!

261
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,894
Go, girl!

262
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:49,169
Hey! Yeah!

263
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:54,908
Honey, please tell me

264
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:57,878
I didn't miss your tryout
or Megan's?

265
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,246
Janice,
you just missed Megan,

266
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,413
but Cindy hasn't gone yet.

267
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,182
I have to apologize
to Megan.

268
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:04,184
What kind
of booster president am I,

269
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:05,052
missing
my own daughter's tryout?

270
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:07,420
Mwah!

271
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,056
Me and daddy
are so proud of you.

272
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:10,924
Love you, mom.

273
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,093
Hey, Brooke, I know
your mom isn't here yet,

274
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,963
but she said she promised
to come watch you.

275
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:18,065
That's funny. She's never came
to see me before.

276
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:21,134
Jeri Blackburn!

277
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:23,403
Yeah, jeri!
Whoo!

278
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:25,605
Jeri! Jeri! Jeri!

279
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,840
Jeri!

280
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:28,475
Wait, hold on.

281
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:32,545
Mrs. Blackburn,
what's going on?

282
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:34,357
We already took this up in
committee, and it was decided...

283
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:36,249
What makes you think
it's only up to you

284
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:37,417
and your little committee?

285
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:39,485
Go ahead, baby.

286
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:49,396
My gosh.

287
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:54,001
"Cindy Harper"! I'm in!

288
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:56,169
"Dakota lumley," you're in!

289
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:58,105
"Summer Samuelson" in!

290
00:13:58,138 --> 00:14:00,440
Wait, where's Megan?

291
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:06,013
My gosh!
We all got in!

292
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:08,115
My gosh, I don't know
how we all did this!

293
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:11,985
Golly gee,
we get to be cheerleaders.

294
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:16,056
Isn't that the most exciting
thing in our pathetic lives?

295
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:19,159
My god.
Jeri, you're not on here.

296
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,494
What? No way.

297
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:24,965
Coach carr made you co-captain?

298
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:27,600
Well, I feel like
we could do a really good job

299
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:29,069
if we work together.

300
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,206
It's okay.
They're jerks.

301
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:46,086
For a second, I thought
she was gonna run her over.

302
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,187
You know she wants to.

303
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,166
You knew coach carr was planning
to make Megan co-captain

304
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,159
and you said "okay"

305
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:53,602
when I've always been
the only captain?

306
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:54,494
Brooke, I can't tell coach carr

307
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:57,030
that a girl
who's perfectly qualified...

308
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:59,232
Did it occur to you that
I'm the best one for the job?

309
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:01,501
Or that Megan has never
choreographed a single routine

310
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:03,470
because she sucks at it?

311
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:05,973
You are like everyone else.

312
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:09,276
You think everything I get
is because I'm your daughter.

313
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:11,344
I hate you being principal.

314
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:12,145
I don't even have a mom anymore.

315
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:16,583
Brooke, I wish
you wouldn't say that.

316
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:18,656
Well, the truth hurts,
doesn't it, principal tippit?

317
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:29,529
So, is Megan still gonna be
our captain?

318
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:31,331
Megan's not our problem.

319
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:32,532
Our problem is a coach

320
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:35,168
who thinks she can do whatever
she wants with our squad.

321
00:15:35,202 --> 00:15:38,138
Like hell.

322
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:52,052
O0 c1oh, my gosh, look at
what Paris Hilton is wearing.

323
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:53,753
Yo, look at this.

324
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,488
What?
Look.

325
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:57,257
That's hideous!

326
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,092
Don't worry about it.

327
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:01,361
Hey, Mr. Spretnik.

328
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:02,505
Hey, Mr. Spretnik. Hey,
Mr. Spretnik. Hey, Mr. Spretnik.

329
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:06,433
Now, you girls are gonna behave
this summer, right?

330
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,569
How do you want US to behave?

331
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:14,574
Gets him every time.

332
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:18,045
I think he was getting hot
right there.

333
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:19,512
Ha ha!

334
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:20,447
My god.
What are you doing?

335
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,050
What's up, baby?

336
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:27,120
My god, get a room.

337
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:31,324
Wait, how did you
sneak on campus?

338
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:31,991
It's the last day of school.

339
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:32,459
What are they gonna do to me?

340
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,293
Arrest you?

341
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:37,464
Arrest me? Again?
What's up, ash?

342
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,167
Jeri, better tighten
your animal's leash.

343
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,668
Animal?
Down, boy.

344
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:45,105
You're such a dog.

345
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:46,139
Yo, what's up?

346
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:47,174
I just texted you.

347
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:48,517
I'm gonna score some bud
for Tabitha's kickback.

348
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:52,179
You down? Let the girls get
it. He gives it to them for free.

349
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:53,413
You know what?
Forget weed.

350
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:55,724
Coach carr will probably make US
pee in a cup at cheer camp.

351
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,417
No, she won't.
Yes, she will,

352
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,520
because that's the kind
of Nazi bitch she is. Bye.

353
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:02,631
You guys will get it? Will you get
it for me? Shh. Here she comes.

354
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:04,491
I don't care.
Let her hear me.

355
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:10,830
Bye, girls. I'll see you
on Wednesday for cheer camp.

356
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:11,664
Have a good summer.

357
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:15,168
I wonder what's going on
with Brooke.

358
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:16,469
She's being so cold.

359
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:18,805
Well, you don't want my opinion.

360
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:21,341
Here.
By the way, here's your $200.

361
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,676
We never should have let you in
on that pool.

362
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,612
Well, here you go,
you sore loser.

363
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:27,280
Buy your wife some flowers.

364
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:29,382
No, no, no, you won that money
fair and square.

365
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,427
And, besides, I'm not buying
my wife anything right now.

366
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:33,586
And why not?

367
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,531
'Cause our 10-year anniversary
is coming up in a few weeks,

368
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,124
and I want her to think
that I forgot.

369
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:38,567
You better remember.
It's a setup.

370
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:41,594
I've already booked
a romantic weekend.

371
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:44,731
Looks like coach carr's
moving in on your territory.

372
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:47,734
I guess you won't be giving him
your little gift now.

373
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:50,837
Watch this.

374
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,140
I'll let my mother take the kids
for a couple of days.

375
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:54,350
We get ourselves
a second honeymoon.

376
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:57,744
And you don't think your wife
is gonna suspect something?

377
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:59,412
God, I hope not.

378
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:01,714
Excuse me, coach reeve?

379
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:04,417
Hey.

380
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:06,319
I just wanted to give you this.

381
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:10,190
It's all chill songs
I thought you'd love.

382
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:12,892
Thank you.
It's very thoughtful of you.

383
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:13,393
No problem.

384
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:17,830
Very sweet of you.

385
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:21,534
So, I will see you
in a couple days, okay?

386
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,638
Bye.

387
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:29,409
Have a good summer, kiddo.

388
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,477
Thanks.
You, too.

389
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,446
Bye, lise.

390
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:42,255
He's totally mine.

391
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:44,224
That was so stupid.

392
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,169
All right, ladies.
Get together.

393
00:18:56,203 --> 00:18:57,670
Okay, beautiful.

394
00:18:57,704 --> 00:19:00,173
Nice. Nice.

395
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:03,710
Nice. Come on.
Beautiful.

396
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:04,544
Okay.

397
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:05,778
Turn around.

398
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:09,382
Turn around.
Let me see your legs. Okay.

399
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:10,550
Make out.

400
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,319
Tabitha, kiss her.

401
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:12,785
Brooke.

402
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,188
Look, you guys.

403
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:18,391
Beautiful. Beautiful.

404
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:19,826
Jeri and Trevor
are fighting again.

405
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:20,860
Beautiful. Brooke.

406
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,829
Brooke?

407
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:24,864
Who cares? They
should just break up already.

408
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:27,334
Make out.
Hey, make out.

409
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:27,700
Gross.

410
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:28,701
Kiss her.

411
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:30,670
Hey, want some?

412
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:38,278
Drink, drink, drink, drink,
drink, drink, drink!

413
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:39,045
Tabitha?

414
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:41,681
What do you think you're doing?

415
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:44,784
Mom, it's the last day
of school.

416
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:47,220
You said I could have a party.

417
00:19:47,254 --> 00:19:48,764
I said you could have
a few friends over.

418
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:53,826
I did not say you could pass out
booze to the entire school.

419
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,838
There had better be some Tequila
left in that bottle

420
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:58,898
for my margaritas
or you are in big trouble.

421
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:05,605
I love your mom!

422
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:07,774
My god!
My god!

423
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:23,690
Jeri is such a bitch.

424
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,859
I should totally
break up with her.

425
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:29,896
No, she should break up
with you.

426
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:31,431
Why?

427
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:32,708
'Cause you're a jerk,
that's why.

428
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:35,001
Come on, you know I'm solid.

429
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:36,936
Right?
I don't think so.

430
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,971
You don't think so, what?

431
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:41,541
I don't think you're a good guy.

432
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,577
Why am I not a good guy?

433
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,382
I don't think so.

434
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:49,749
Whoops.

435
00:20:59,058 --> 00:20:59,726
If daddy calls while I'm gone,

436
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,529
tell him to try my cellphone.

437
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:03,430
Brooke, I don't know

438
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:05,732
why you get your hopes up
with that man.

439
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:06,775
He's obviously
too self-absorbed to...

440
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,868
Geez, the way you rag on him,
no wonder he left.

441
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:11,804
Brooke, I want you
to have a good time.

442
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:13,005
I don't want to fight.

443
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,039
All right, whatever.
Bye.

444
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:21,681
Hey, cheer camp's only a week,

445
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:23,816
and New Orleans
is only a few hours away.

446
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,051
Okay.

447
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:28,020
There's Jackson high's
shiny new star.

448
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:29,856
Lorene, this is my husband, Tim.

449
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:31,524
Very nice to meet you.

450
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:33,693
Emma has told me
such nice things about you.

451
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:34,894
Nice to meet you.

452
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:36,596
Whoo!

453
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:44,604
Wow. The girls are going to camp
in a limo.

454
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,774
Yeah, when Brooke and Ashley
asked me, I thought, "why not?

455
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,743
It might be a good bonding
experience for the squad."

456
00:21:50,777 --> 00:21:52,812
Well, you should go, baby.
I'll see you soon.

457
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:56,749
I'll call you tonight,
okay? You better.

458
00:21:56,783 --> 00:21:58,851
I love you.
I love you, too.

459
00:21:58,885 --> 00:22:00,387
It was very nice
to have met you,

460
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,765
and I'd love to have you over for
dinner sometime. Absolutely. Thanks.

461
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:09,128
Jeri! Jeri! Jeri! Jeri!

462
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,897
Whoo!
Whoo!

463
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,164
What's jeri doing here?

464
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:17,003
She was added back to the squad
by superintendent tompkins.

465
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:17,737
Coach carr is freaking.

466
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,906
I know. I love it.

467
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:22,742
Do you have the central office's
phone number?

468
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:25,578
No, no, no, you're not
gonna call central office,

469
00:22:25,612 --> 00:22:26,979
not without my permission ever.

470
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:29,015
But three other girls
didn't make the squad

471
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:30,983
'cause they couldn't do
a back handspring.

472
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:33,152
How is that fair that jeri is
and they're not?

473
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,622
The decision's
already been made.

474
00:22:35,655 --> 00:22:38,425
I know that you want to do
the right thing for the squad,

475
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,126
but the right thing
to do right now

476
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,729
is to welcome jeri back
and go on to camp.

477
00:22:42,762 --> 00:22:45,131
Please.

478
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,570
Come on, you guys!
Let's go!

479
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:41,854
Let's go! Defense!

480
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:43,856
All right, you guys.
Let's hear it!

481
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,892
Pump! Pump! Pump it up!

482
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:48,728
Pump that spirit!
Keep it up!

483
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:49,896
Pump! Pump! Pump it up!

484
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:52,198
Pump that spirit!
Keep it up!

485
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,236
You guys are embarrassing
yourselves.

486
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,505
Megan?

487
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:03,042
Pump! Pump! Pump it up!

488
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:04,977
Pump that spirit!
Keep it up!

489
00:24:05,011 --> 00:24:06,913
Pump! Pump! Pump it up!

490
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:07,914
Pump that spirit!
Keep it up!

491
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:10,783
Pump! Pump! Pump it up!

492
00:24:10,817 --> 00:24:12,184
Pump that spirit!
Keep it up!

493
00:24:12,218 --> 00:24:13,920
Pump! Pump! Pump it up!

494
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:14,854
Pump that spirit!
Keep it up!

495
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:17,524
Pump! Pump! Pump it up!

496
00:24:17,557 --> 00:24:18,825
Pump that spirit!
Keep it up!

497
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,695
I don't have it.

498
00:24:22,729 --> 00:24:24,831
I know you stole
Cindy's tape, Brooke.

499
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:27,133
I saw you!

500
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,669
Now, give it back.

501
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:31,738
Chill, bitch.
I don't have it.

502
00:24:31,771 --> 00:24:33,172
Yes, you do, Brooke!

503
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:34,774
Search me.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

504
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:35,474
What's going on?

505
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:36,375
I brought a roll of duct tape

506
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:38,778
so we could play a joke
on the captains,

507
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,947
tape them up in their rooms
like they did last year.

508
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,715
But Brooke and Lisa took it.

509
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:45,051
She's lying.

510
00:24:47,787 --> 00:24:48,588
Come on, you guys.

511
00:24:48,621 --> 00:24:50,757
Look, I don't want
to ruin your fun,

512
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,825
but you can't just
steal someone's stuff.

513
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:54,036
So, why don't you give it back,

514
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,004
and I'll take you someplace
to get your own roll, okay?

515
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:57,964
Let's go. Come on.
Let's get our stuff.

516
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:13,780
You know,
I'm gonna go ask coach Wilson

517
00:25:13,813 --> 00:25:15,057
if I can borrow her car
'cause it's late.

518
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:16,282
You know what?

519
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:17,826
I can hold your stuff for you,
if you want.

520
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,787
Okay. Um,
two seconds. Thank you. Okay.

521
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,888
Right back.

522
00:25:21,921 --> 00:25:22,922
That was too damn easy.

523
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:25,091
Seriously.

524
00:25:27,827 --> 00:25:28,961
What are you doing?

525
00:25:28,995 --> 00:25:31,998
Well, coach carr said she
doesn't want to ruin our fun,

526
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:35,234
so we're gonna have some fun.

527
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,206
Look who we have here.

528
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:42,341
You guys are crazy.

529
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:45,111
Do it.

530
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:57,223
Hey, there.

531
00:25:57,256 --> 00:25:59,058
What the hell are
you trying to do, carr?

532
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:01,060
Was that message supposed
to be some kind of joke?

533
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:02,328
What are you talking about?

534
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:03,996
That text message
you just sent me.

535
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,832
What if my wife had read it?

536
00:26:05,865 --> 00:26:07,175
I don't think she's gonna
find that too funny.

537
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:09,235
What text?
I didn't send you a text.

538
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:11,938
Well, I sure as hell got
a text message from your phone!

539
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:14,006
Saying what?

540
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,342
"I think we should hot box."

541
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:17,977
I don't even know
what a "hot box" means.

542
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,045
Neither do I.

543
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:23,883
But it sounds like, you know...

544
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:26,753
Well, if you didn't send it,
who the hell did?

545
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:30,923
This is not funny.

546
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:33,225
Okay.

547
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:34,994
I really would love
to have a bra like that.

548
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:37,396
That is hot.

549
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,366
You girls sent coach reeve
a dirty text from my phone?!

550
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:42,969
I told you she'd think

551
00:26:43,002 --> 00:26:44,346
hot boxing was something
about sex.

552
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,372
Chill out.
It's not about sex.

553
00:26:46,405 --> 00:26:49,175
It means smoking weed
in your car, windows up.

554
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:50,843
Get it?
"Hot box"?

555
00:26:50,877 --> 00:26:52,679
And you think that's better?

556
00:26:52,712 --> 00:26:54,380
What is wrong with you girls?

557
00:26:54,413 --> 00:26:57,049
I am married!
Coach reeve is married!

558
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:59,752
Do you have any idea
how ugly this could have gotten?

559
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:00,552
We're sorry, okay?

560
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:03,355
We thought
we were doing you a favor.

561
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:05,324
We all know
you like coach reeve.

562
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:06,693
Yeah.

563
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:11,931
Never touch my phone again.

564
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:14,867
No problem, coach carr.

565
00:27:16,736 --> 00:27:18,146
I don't even know what to think
about you girls anymore.

566
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,873
What are we supposed to think
of you?

567
00:27:20,907 --> 00:27:22,975
You're having
a fricking heart attack

568
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:24,276
over a stupid, little joke.

569
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,145
We really did think
you'd laugh about it.

570
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:28,815
So laugh.

571
00:27:28,848 --> 00:27:31,350
It's late. Y'all need
to get back to your own rooms.

572
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,955
Now!

573
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,090
You know what?
Just go.

574
00:27:41,027 --> 00:27:43,329
See ya.
Wouldn't want to be ya.

575
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:44,964
Nighty night.

576
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:56,242
Why are you here, Brooke?
Why are you a cheerleader?

577
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:57,844
Because I'm good at it.

578
00:27:57,877 --> 00:27:59,779
You're good
at the physical part.

579
00:27:59,812 --> 00:28:01,781
But there's more to it
than that.

580
00:28:01,814 --> 00:28:03,325
It's about being
a certain kind of person...

581
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:07,186
A person who cares,
cares about her squad,

582
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:09,989
her fellow students, her school.

583
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,457
You know what?
Save the lecture.

584
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:15,027
The school is all
my mother ever talks about.

585
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:17,029
I'm a cheerleader for me.

586
00:28:17,063 --> 00:28:18,303
That's who people notice... me.

587
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:25,337
Look at your uniform.

588
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:28,007
Your name isn't on the back
of this.

589
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,441
You don't have a number.

590
00:28:29,475 --> 00:28:31,243
This uniform
isn't about you, Brooke.

591
00:28:31,277 --> 00:28:34,180
It's about being a part
of something bigger than you.

592
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:37,183
Anyone can get noticed.

593
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:40,486
There's nothing special
about that.

594
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:44,456
But it takes someone special
to inspire others.

595
00:28:47,026 --> 00:28:48,194
Do you want to know

596
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:52,799
why I made Megan co-captain
of this squad?

597
00:28:52,832 --> 00:28:56,168
Because she knows
how to inspire people.

598
00:28:56,202 --> 00:28:58,971
And you, Brooke?

599
00:28:59,005 --> 00:29:00,739
You don't.

600
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,276
All right, you guys, let's go.

601
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:38,845
Come on.

602
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:42,248
Pump! Pump! Pump it up!

603
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,984
Pump that spirit!
Keep it up!

604
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:46,585
Fire! Fire! Fire it up!

605
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,821
Fire that hornet spirit up!

606
00:29:48,855 --> 00:29:50,389
Pump! Pump! Pump it up!

607
00:29:50,422 --> 00:29:52,524
Pump that spirit!
Keep it up!

608
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:54,360
Fire! Fire! Fire it up!

609
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:56,195
Fire that hornet spirit up!

610
00:29:56,228 --> 00:29:58,097
5, 6, 7, 8.

611
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,332
Here we go, hornets!
Here we go!

612
00:30:00,366 --> 00:30:01,500
Come on, you guys.

613
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:03,903
Here we go, hornets!
Here we go!

614
00:30:03,936 --> 00:30:05,137
Louder!

615
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:07,273
Here we go, hornets!
Here we go!

616
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:11,343
Here we go, hornets!
Here we go!

617
00:30:11,377 --> 00:30:12,617
Here we go, hornets!
Here we go!

618
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:28,494
O0 c1 Jackson high,
I give you your varsity cheerleaders!

619
00:30:36,235 --> 00:30:38,170
Yeah! Whoo!

620
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:05,197
Give it up
for your Jackson hornets.

621
00:31:57,283 --> 00:31:59,085
Whoo!

622
00:32:08,227 --> 00:32:10,329
Whoa!

623
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:12,031
Whoo!

624
00:32:16,402 --> 00:32:20,439
Hey, that was really great.

625
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:23,675
I am so proud of you guys.

626
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:26,078
You guys were amazing today.

627
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:31,550
I need to thank our captains.

628
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:33,986
You guys both stepped up
and ran the practices.

629
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,322
You figured out the lighting,
the effects,

630
00:32:36,355 --> 00:32:37,365
and raised the money
to pay for it.

631
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:39,358
Awesome job, you guys.

632
00:32:43,229 --> 00:32:45,664
And, Brooke,
this was especially your show.

633
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:47,133
The choreography,

634
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:48,510
the presentation
was beyond amazing.

635
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:51,437
I'm so proud of you!

636
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:54,849
Brooke! Brooke! Brooke! Brooke!

637
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:58,244
Brooke! Brooke! Brooke! Brooke!
Brooke! Brooke! Brooke! Brooke!

638
00:33:01,547 --> 00:33:05,184
That was the best pep rally
in Jackson history!

639
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,723
And I think we all know
who we have to thank for that.

640
00:33:11,757 --> 00:33:13,725
Give it up for coach carr,
you guys.

641
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:20,732
You were great!

642
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:21,567
It wasn't me.

643
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,403
You guys,
go home and get some rest.

644
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:25,671
I'll see you tomorrow.

645
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:27,539
I'mproud of you.

646
00:33:27,573 --> 00:33:29,608
No practice tonight?

647
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:31,377
Finally.

648
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:32,744
Brooke? Brooke?

649
00:33:32,778 --> 00:33:35,614
Brooke?

650
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:39,618
Brooke, you were
so wonderful out there.

651
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:41,353
How about
we go to dinner tonight,

652
00:33:41,387 --> 00:33:43,455
just you and me?

653
00:33:43,489 --> 00:33:45,324
You know, I'm sorry.
I can't.

654
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,326
Coach carr invited me
and Megan over

655
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,428
to help pick out music
for crosstown showdown.

656
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:50,496
Right, coach?

657
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,298
What?

658
00:33:52,331 --> 00:33:53,408
The mix for crosstown showdown?

659
00:33:53,432 --> 00:33:55,401
Tonight, yeah.

660
00:33:55,434 --> 00:33:56,802
Sure.

661
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:15,321
Hey. Hey.
Yo, come here.

662
00:34:15,354 --> 00:34:16,522
No, you don't touch me.
Why?

663
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:19,325
Do you have any idea
how stupid I felt

664
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:21,193
when you showed up
at that party with jeri?

665
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:22,537
You told me
you broke up with her.

666
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,196
You lied to me.
We are broke up.

667
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,497
Look, calm down, okay?

668
00:34:25,531 --> 00:34:27,266
She was needing a ride.

669
00:34:27,299 --> 00:34:29,501
She called me, and she just...

670
00:34:29,535 --> 00:34:31,513
You are such a... okay,
look, look, listen, listen.

671
00:34:31,537 --> 00:34:33,472
I wasn't... I'm not with her.

672
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:35,207
I came here to see you.

673
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:36,808
That's why I'm here, okay?

674
00:34:38,477 --> 00:34:41,280
Lunch money.

675
00:34:41,313 --> 00:34:43,449
Thank you, daddy.

676
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,255
Wait, where's Ashley?

677
00:34:49,288 --> 00:34:50,456
Not my day to babysit her.

678
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:53,125
I'm not with her.

679
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,726
Okay?

680
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,128
No, I can't!

681
00:34:56,162 --> 00:34:57,162
You can't what?

682
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:01,200
I can't do this.
I mean...

683
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:02,301
Just stop it.

684
00:35:48,414 --> 00:35:49,548
Fight! Fight!

685
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,295
If you would
just let me explain...

686
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:04,506
You're sleeping with
my boyfriend, aren't you?

687
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:05,764
You fugly slut.

688
00:36:05,797 --> 00:36:07,466
Slut?!
You're calling me a slut?!

689
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:07,933
Yes, I'm calling you a slut!

690
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:09,935
Yes, I am!

691
00:36:09,968 --> 00:36:12,371
You bitch!

692
00:36:12,404 --> 00:36:13,905
Hey!

693
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:17,576
Did you think
I would not find out?!

694
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,415
Bitch!

695
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:25,584
Jeri, stop!

696
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:26,485
Die!

697
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:29,721
No! No, you're supposed
to be my friend!

698
00:36:29,755 --> 00:36:32,958
Come on.
Move it. Move it. Move it.

699
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:34,669
Out of the way. Out of the way.
What's going on?

700
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:37,429
Jesus, Ashley.
Ashley, are you all right?

701
00:36:38,764 --> 00:36:41,900
What happened here?

702
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:43,635
Ashley, are you okay?

703
00:36:43,669 --> 00:36:46,738
Did somebody hit you?

704
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:50,909
No.

705
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:54,212
I just have a bad stomach cramp,
that's all.

706
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,819
Well, if she or anybody else
gets any more stomach cramps,

707
00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:02,621
the repercussions
will be expulsion.

708
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:04,823
Is that understood?

709
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:07,393
Come on.

710
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,730
Yeah, jeri.

711
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:14,600
Where's Lisa?

712
00:37:25,411 --> 00:37:26,411
Whose phone is that?

713
00:37:30,816 --> 00:37:31,883
Talk to me.

714
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,787
My god, she did what?

715
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:37,789
Lisa, off the phone now!

716
00:37:37,823 --> 00:37:39,691
No way.

717
00:37:39,725 --> 00:37:41,793
My gosh, give me details.

718
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,832
No way.

719
00:37:46,865 --> 00:37:48,634
My god,
you must be kidding me.

720
00:37:49,735 --> 00:37:52,438
Lisa, off the phone now!

721
00:37:52,471 --> 00:37:54,272
This is important.
Do you mind?

722
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:58,544
You better give me the phone.

723
00:37:58,577 --> 00:38:00,546
No way.
My gosh.

724
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:01,713
Girl, give me the phone.

725
00:38:01,747 --> 00:38:03,782
Okay.
Meet me at the quad at break.

726
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:04,883
Okay, okay.

727
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:08,887
There. I'm done.

728
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,456
Happy?

729
00:38:10,489 --> 00:38:12,057
I can't believe she did that!

730
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,760
Or that Brooke would call her
in the middle of class!

731
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:16,595
What's the big shock here?

732
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,397
The fab five run this school...

733
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:20,466
Brooke, Lisa, Ashley,
all of them.

734
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:23,068
They've been doing exactly
as they please for years.

735
00:38:23,101 --> 00:38:25,604
But since the pep rally,
I thought that...

736
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:27,573
Did you really think a pep rally

737
00:38:27,606 --> 00:38:29,841
was gonna make a big difference
with those girls?

738
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:34,980
Brooke, Brooke,
I need to talk to you.

739
00:38:35,013 --> 00:38:37,749
Look, mom, not right now.
Look, I have to go to practice.

740
00:38:37,783 --> 00:38:39,117
I need to talk to you now.

741
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,586
Tabitha, run on ahead.

742
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:42,421
Just go.

743
00:38:42,454 --> 00:38:43,655
Yes, ma'am.

744
00:38:43,689 --> 00:38:45,090
Miss durant just dropped off

745
00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:46,692
a disciplinary-action referral.

746
00:38:46,725 --> 00:38:48,560
For what?

747
00:38:48,594 --> 00:38:49,804
For phone use in class
for you and Lisa.

748
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:50,896
So?

749
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:52,631
Look, you know
how intense she is,

750
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:54,041
always getting uptight
over nothing.

751
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:55,300
Coach carr came in with her,

752
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,869
and she wants to give you and
Lisa demerits for the offense.

753
00:38:57,903 --> 00:38:59,070
Are you kidding me?

754
00:38:59,104 --> 00:39:00,839
I cannot tell you
how royally pissed I am.

755
00:39:00,872 --> 00:39:02,140
Yeah, at me.

756
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,308
No!
At coach carr.

757
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,811
I didn't hire her to go
on a witch hunt for demerits.

758
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:11,983
Now, why don't you tell me
your version of what happened?

759
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:14,119
You don't have a choice.
You are getting 10 demerits.

760
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:15,621
No, I'm not.

761
00:39:15,654 --> 00:39:17,889
Not unless Mr. Spretnik says so.
And he won't.

762
00:39:17,923 --> 00:39:19,891
How could you do that?

763
00:39:19,925 --> 00:39:22,428
Write me up without even
asking me what happened?

764
00:39:22,461 --> 00:39:23,771
Okay, first of all,
I didn't write you up.

765
00:39:23,795 --> 00:39:25,030
Mrs. Durant did.

766
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:26,903
Second of all,
it doesn't matter what happened.

767
00:39:26,932 --> 00:39:28,099
You girls did what you did,

768
00:39:28,133 --> 00:39:28,934
and you have to face
the consequences.

769
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:31,136
So, if you're not
gonna sign this,

770
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:32,179
I'm gonna be talking
to Mr. Spretnik

771
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,472
at the end of the day.

772
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:35,474
What is your malfunction, Emma?

773
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:36,851
Well, at the moment,
it's your tone,

774
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,610
so, please,
watch how you talk to me.

775
00:39:40,145 --> 00:39:41,112
Brooke.

776
00:39:41,146 --> 00:39:42,113
Brooke!

777
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:43,114
Brooke!

778
00:39:43,148 --> 00:39:45,817
Do you really think
I want to give you demerits

779
00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:47,719
after all the hard work
you've done?

780
00:39:47,753 --> 00:39:49,455
I was crushed
when miss durant told me

781
00:39:49,488 --> 00:39:51,022
you called Lisa
in the middle of class.

782
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:52,023
I thought
you were better than that.

783
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:55,026
Yeah, that's what I thought
about you, too.

784
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,629
And, believe me, I won't ever
make that mistake again.

785
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:00,866
And, by the way, um,

786
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:03,869
my mom wants to see you
in her office.

787
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:11,902
Now.

788
00:40:18,484 --> 00:40:19,527
O0 c1 so, you're saying we
can't for phone use in class. Ts

789
00:40:19,551 --> 00:40:21,653
no, jeri had just found out

790
00:40:21,687 --> 00:40:23,922
that her boyfriend
was cheating on her...

791
00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:25,657
With Ashley, of all people.

792
00:40:25,691 --> 00:40:27,893
Apparently,
jeri said she felt suicidal.

793
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,761
And Lisa was worried about her,

794
00:40:29,795 --> 00:40:31,763
which is why
she picked up the phone.

795
00:40:31,797 --> 00:40:33,865
If that was why
she answered the phone.

796
00:40:33,899 --> 00:40:34,933
You know these girls...

797
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:37,936
How they play with the truth
to avoid consequences.

798
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:39,180
Look, whether it's true or not,

799
00:40:39,204 --> 00:40:40,005
I think it's wrong
to let this slide.

800
00:40:40,038 --> 00:40:41,172
I really want to instill

801
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:43,942
a sense of accountability
in those girls.

802
00:40:43,975 --> 00:40:45,777
It's not your job
to hold them accountable.

803
00:40:45,811 --> 00:40:48,013
It's my job,
and it's Mr. Spretnik's job.

804
00:40:48,046 --> 00:40:50,215
I would appreciate it
if you'd do your job

805
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:52,618
and get the squad ready
for the game tonight.

806
00:40:56,722 --> 00:40:58,099
I know it seems
I'm being argumentative.

807
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:01,226
I just...
I want to do a good job here.

808
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:03,061
I want to do a good job for you.

809
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:07,699
You're new at this.

810
00:41:07,733 --> 00:41:08,810
And you haven't learned yet

811
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:11,803
that the people above you
with years of experience

812
00:41:11,837 --> 00:41:13,839
have good reasons
for their decisions.

813
00:41:13,872 --> 00:41:15,774
I need you to start
figuring that out.

814
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:31,122
You should be warming up
for tonight's game.

815
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:31,923
Well, we just wanted to know

816
00:41:31,957 --> 00:41:34,960
if we had to sign
the demerit book.

817
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:38,597
I think you already know
the answer to that.

818
00:41:53,278 --> 00:41:56,147
We need at least two
six-packs, so, jeri, you go in.

819
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:58,116
No, Brooke, I don't have my...

820
00:41:58,149 --> 00:42:00,719
I don't have my fake I.D.

821
00:42:00,752 --> 00:42:01,787
I don't have mine.

822
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,622
I thought I told you that.

823
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:05,056
Hey, y'all, to the left.

824
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:08,059
Ooh.

825
00:42:09,327 --> 00:42:10,327
Ladies.

826
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:15,801
Well, well,
well. Make it happen, Brooke.

827
00:42:17,636 --> 00:42:18,970
Hey, give me that.

828
00:42:19,004 --> 00:42:20,672
Unh-unh, unh-unh, unh-unh.

829
00:42:20,706 --> 00:42:21,673
Hey!

830
00:42:23,008 --> 00:42:24,643
Easy.
Wait, no, come on!

831
00:42:24,676 --> 00:42:26,311
Come on. Come on.
You got it!

832
00:42:26,344 --> 00:42:28,113
Whoa!

833
00:42:32,618 --> 00:42:34,820
Y'all riding dirty?

834
00:42:34,853 --> 00:42:37,122
Yeah, I wish.

835
00:42:37,155 --> 00:42:39,124
Got a beer for a lady?

836
00:42:39,157 --> 00:42:41,292
Make that two.

837
00:42:41,326 --> 00:42:42,628
You guys, look.

838
00:42:42,661 --> 00:42:44,295
Thanks, dude.
Look over there.

839
00:42:45,263 --> 00:42:47,098
Anyone want to go?

840
00:42:47,132 --> 00:42:49,701
My god.

841
00:42:52,203 --> 00:42:54,740
It's getting bad.

842
00:42:54,773 --> 00:42:55,641
It's terrible.

843
00:42:58,977 --> 00:42:59,244
What do you think about this?

844
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:01,312
R-r-r!

845
00:43:01,346 --> 00:43:03,014
No, you should wear them.

846
00:43:04,983 --> 00:43:07,719
Hey! Hey!
Y'all are all 18, right?

847
00:43:07,753 --> 00:43:08,954
Just barely.

848
00:43:12,357 --> 00:43:15,293
You really think we should
be in here in our uniforms?

849
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:17,696
Look, just relax, okay?

850
00:43:17,729 --> 00:43:20,231
I mean, look at all
these dirty old men in here.

851
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:23,869
I bet they love
naughty cheerleaders.

852
00:43:23,902 --> 00:43:24,235
Mr. Spretnik!

853
00:43:28,006 --> 00:43:31,009
Ooh, "heat wave lubricant."

854
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:41,152
How about some
of this bondage tape?

855
00:43:41,186 --> 00:43:43,822
Flexy dong.

856
00:43:43,855 --> 00:43:46,291
Now, that's hot.

857
00:43:46,324 --> 00:43:47,392
That's great.

858
00:43:47,425 --> 00:43:49,427
Yeah.
That's really hot, Brooke.

859
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,697
What do you think?

860
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:54,650
She is not a real cheerleader. I bet
she can't do this. What can't she do?

861
00:43:56,201 --> 00:43:58,937
Bad Tabitha.

862
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,972
Wait, you guys, come here.
Come on.

863
00:44:01,006 --> 00:44:02,708
You have to see this.
Come on.

864
00:44:02,741 --> 00:44:05,076
Hey, um,
why don't you hold this?

865
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:06,644
Okay.

866
00:44:09,214 --> 00:44:10,081
This is good.
Be bad.

867
00:44:13,051 --> 00:44:14,152
That is so sick.

868
00:44:14,185 --> 00:44:15,687
My.

869
00:44:24,362 --> 00:44:25,997
Hello?

870
00:44:27,866 --> 00:44:31,369
Janice, what's wrong?

871
00:44:36,041 --> 00:44:37,876
Pump! Pump! Pump it up!

872
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:39,410
Pump that spirit!
Keep it up!

873
00:44:39,444 --> 00:44:40,078
They're in their uniforms.

874
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:43,915
I'm getting a little...

875
00:44:43,949 --> 00:44:45,951
I know.

876
00:44:45,984 --> 00:44:47,252
It's Ashley.

877
00:44:47,285 --> 00:44:50,388
Who did you say brought this
to your attention?

878
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:51,757
Janice Harper.

879
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:54,059
Her daughter Cindy
showed it to her.

880
00:44:54,092 --> 00:44:56,061
I'm just not sure
how to handle this.

881
00:44:56,094 --> 00:44:58,129
Emma, that's all right.
We'll handle it.

882
00:44:58,163 --> 00:44:59,264
That was awesome.

883
00:44:59,297 --> 00:45:02,934
All right!
We love you.

884
00:45:02,968 --> 00:45:04,970
No, no, Janice Harper's
probably shown this

885
00:45:05,003 --> 00:45:06,437
to the entire booster club
by now.

886
00:45:06,471 --> 00:45:08,874
I can't be involved in this.

887
00:45:10,408 --> 00:45:12,408
This is gonna have to be handled
by central office.

888
00:45:27,492 --> 00:45:30,128
Miss Anderson?
Bathroom?

889
00:45:58,323 --> 00:46:00,458
Hey.

890
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:02,327
Heard about the video.

891
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,529
Say it.
Get it over with.

892
00:46:04,562 --> 00:46:05,997
Say what?

893
00:46:06,031 --> 00:46:07,799
"I told you so."

894
00:46:07,833 --> 00:46:09,467
Not what I want to say.

895
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,536
What do you want to say?

896
00:46:11,569 --> 00:46:13,438
That if anyone can turn
the situation around

897
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:16,007
for these girls, it's you.

898
00:46:16,041 --> 00:46:18,276
Thanks.

899
00:46:19,477 --> 00:46:22,380
You're the best.

900
00:46:26,484 --> 00:46:30,021
You know, I really hate it
when you pull me out of class.

901
00:46:30,055 --> 00:46:32,123
If you have to talk to me,
just wait till lunch.

902
00:46:36,561 --> 00:46:38,263
Pump! Pump! Pump it up!

903
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:40,031
Pump that spirit!
Keep it up!

904
00:46:40,065 --> 00:46:41,466
Whoo!

905
00:46:41,499 --> 00:46:42,834
That was awesome.

906
00:46:42,868 --> 00:46:44,169
Wait, how did you find this?

907
00:46:44,202 --> 00:46:45,036
Do you know how difficult

908
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:47,072
damage control is gonna be
for this?

909
00:46:47,105 --> 00:46:49,340
"Damage"?
What damage?

910
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:00,919
Hey, coach carr,
will you take a video of US?

911
00:47:01,352 --> 00:47:04,322
Please?

912
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:08,493
You guys really don't care
about what you do

913
00:47:08,526 --> 00:47:09,360
or how it affects other people,
do you?

914
00:47:09,394 --> 00:47:12,397
Look, all we did
was make a stupid video.

915
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:14,032
It was supposed to be funny.

916
00:47:14,065 --> 00:47:15,566
The jocks around here
make sex jokes

917
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,368
and act obscene all the time.

918
00:47:17,402 --> 00:47:18,612
No one throws a fit about that.

919
00:47:18,636 --> 00:47:21,372
I guarantee you if they were
in their uniform and off campus,

920
00:47:21,406 --> 00:47:23,975
they'd be in big trouble.

921
00:47:24,009 --> 00:47:26,611
So, then it's okay
as long as we're on campus.

922
00:47:26,644 --> 00:47:28,279
Jeri, when you're
in your uniform,

923
00:47:28,313 --> 00:47:29,490
you represent this whole school.

924
00:47:29,514 --> 00:47:31,983
You represent everyone else
on your squad.

925
00:47:32,017 --> 00:47:33,527
Do you realize that anyone
who watches this video

926
00:47:33,551 --> 00:47:37,255
is going to think Jackson
cheerleaders are a bunch of...

927
00:47:37,288 --> 00:47:37,655
Trashy sluts?

928
00:47:46,397 --> 00:47:48,599
I am so disappointed in you.

929
00:47:55,173 --> 00:47:56,383
Coach carr's disappointed in US.

930
00:47:58,643 --> 00:48:00,478
Well, I guess I shouldn't be.

931
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,980
I mean, you did warn me

932
00:48:02,013 --> 00:48:04,082
that all you care about
is getting noticed.

933
00:48:04,115 --> 00:48:06,484
So, congratulations, Brooke.
You're finally getting noticed.

934
00:48:08,987 --> 00:48:10,555
You four are gonna sit out

935
00:48:10,588 --> 00:48:13,358
until the district decides
what your punishment will be.

936
00:48:15,293 --> 00:48:17,028
We'll see what my mom says
about that.

937
00:48:17,062 --> 00:48:19,030
You do realize that in college
you won't be able

938
00:48:19,064 --> 00:48:21,275
to run to your mother every time
you don't like something?

939
00:48:21,299 --> 00:48:25,036
Here. It's obviously
your time of the month.

940
00:48:28,006 --> 00:48:29,140
All right, you guys,

941
00:48:29,174 --> 00:48:31,442
crosstown showdown
is in a couple weeks,

942
00:48:31,476 --> 00:48:33,244
so let's go
and start stretching.

943
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:50,962
Look who it is.
The little narc.

944
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:58,103
You think we wouldn't find out

945
00:48:58,136 --> 00:48:59,437
you showed your mom the video?

946
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:01,206
I'm sorry.

947
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:02,473
No, but you will be.

948
00:49:05,143 --> 00:49:06,444
I'm sorr... I'm sorry!

949
00:49:06,477 --> 00:49:08,413
I'm sorry.

950
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:09,480
Aw.

951
00:49:09,514 --> 00:49:12,283
Stop it, you guys!

952
00:49:12,317 --> 00:49:13,551
Yeah. You're sorry? Yes.

953
00:49:13,584 --> 00:49:17,722
Really?
Are you sorry?!

954
00:49:17,755 --> 00:49:18,489
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Brooke! Brooke!

955
00:49:18,523 --> 00:49:20,491
Seriously, wait.

956
00:49:20,525 --> 00:49:21,492
You're sorry?!

957
00:49:21,526 --> 00:49:22,660
I'm sorry!

958
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:23,995
What are you sorry for?!

959
00:49:24,029 --> 00:49:25,396
Brooke! Brooke! Brooke!

960
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:27,565
Brooke, stop! Brooke!

961
00:49:27,598 --> 00:49:28,675
Brooke, what are you doing?!
Are you crazy?!

962
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:31,036
You know what?
Try and hit me!

963
00:49:31,069 --> 00:49:33,771
You want to hit me?!
Come on! Hit me!

964
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,174
You know, if you tell anybody
about this,

965
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:38,043
I swear to god,
you'll get worse.

966
00:49:38,076 --> 00:49:39,777
And I kind of hope you do tell,

967
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,688
'cause it'd make me so happy
to smash your face in.

968
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:43,548
Let's go.
Come on.

969
00:49:47,552 --> 00:49:50,121
Are you okay?

970
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:52,690
It's okay.

971
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:55,426
I'm calling mom right now.

972
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:57,795
No, you heard them.

973
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:00,531
You can't tell.
You have to promise me.

974
00:50:00,565 --> 00:50:08,565
Promise me.

975
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:14,779
O0 c1 Pamela, the video
showed the girls drinking alcohol.D.

976
00:50:14,812 --> 00:50:17,082
According to the cheerleading
constitution,

977
00:50:17,115 --> 00:50:19,650
they should actually be removed
from the squad. Please.

978
00:50:19,684 --> 00:50:21,686
I just read that 80%
of all high-school students

979
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:22,553
drink on occasion.

980
00:50:22,587 --> 00:50:24,589
It's ridiculous
to expect our girls

981
00:50:24,622 --> 00:50:25,790
to behave like it's 1950.

982
00:50:25,823 --> 00:50:27,525
Look, I don't
want Lisa drinking,

983
00:50:27,558 --> 00:50:29,360
but I should be the one
to handle it,

984
00:50:29,394 --> 00:50:30,828
not our little
cheerleading coach.

985
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:34,565
We pay what, 1,500 bucks so our
girls can be cheerleaders? Try $1,800.

986
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:35,766
$1,800. Okay.

987
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:39,237
We paid our money.
Let's let 'em cheer.

988
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:40,771
You know I'm not gonna appeal.

989
00:50:40,805 --> 00:50:42,407
I'm trying to keep myself
out of this.

990
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:46,211
Lorene, come on.
You could at least back US up.

991
00:50:46,244 --> 00:50:48,546
Or get your
little miss sunshine coach here

992
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:51,048
to back off.

993
00:50:55,586 --> 00:50:57,388
If coach carr thinks
we're trashy sluts,

994
00:50:57,422 --> 00:51:00,191
she's gonna get trashy sluts.

995
00:51:06,331 --> 00:51:09,667
Lord!
The sun just came out!

996
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,570
Whoo!
Almighty, that is sexy.

997
00:51:12,603 --> 00:51:14,805
Unh-unh. No way.

998
00:51:14,839 --> 00:51:17,108
I've let a lot slide
with you girls,

999
00:51:17,142 --> 00:51:18,585
but this...
The way you're dressed, unh-unh.

1000
00:51:18,609 --> 00:51:21,179
What's wrong with the way
we're dressed?

1001
00:51:21,212 --> 00:51:22,689
You know exactly
what I'm talking about, Brooke.

1002
00:51:22,713 --> 00:51:24,315
Are you looking at her boobs?

1003
00:51:24,349 --> 00:51:26,151
You perv.

1004
00:51:26,184 --> 00:51:27,694
I want you...
I want all of you right now

1005
00:51:27,718 --> 00:51:28,819
to get down to the office,

1006
00:51:28,853 --> 00:51:29,454
get permission to go home
and change.

1007
00:51:29,487 --> 00:51:32,590
Go.
I don't think so.

1008
00:51:32,623 --> 00:51:34,192
Excuse me?

1009
00:51:34,225 --> 00:51:37,195
You get out of my classroom
right now, Brooke.

1010
00:51:37,228 --> 00:51:38,263
You know what?

1011
00:51:38,296 --> 00:51:40,565
You might as well get
your panties out of a wad,

1012
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:41,878
because we're not
going anywhere.

1013
00:51:55,513 --> 00:52:01,286
So, what should we talk about
today, class?

1014
00:52:01,319 --> 00:52:03,254
Miss Brooke.

1015
00:52:03,288 --> 00:52:04,389
Yes, jeri?

1016
00:52:04,422 --> 00:52:07,758
Um, let's talk about
how Trevor called me last night

1017
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:09,627
and said that Ashley
is so crap in bed

1018
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:12,930
and that she makes sounds
like a monkey.

1019
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,532
Really?

1020
00:52:28,613 --> 00:52:30,448
Aw, poor little baby!

1021
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:32,917
I got a banana for you.

1022
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:38,423
Run, slut! Run!

1023
00:53:02,813 --> 00:53:04,949
What are you looking at?!

1024
00:53:04,982 --> 00:53:06,651
Nothing.

1025
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:10,288
It's just...
Doesn't feel so good

1026
00:53:10,321 --> 00:53:12,590
to be on the other side
of it all, does it?

1027
00:53:12,623 --> 00:53:16,627
I was never as mean as Brooke
and jeri are being to me.

1028
00:53:16,661 --> 00:53:19,730
I was never that cruel!

1029
00:53:19,764 --> 00:53:21,366
Yes, you were.

1030
00:53:21,399 --> 00:53:23,834
You were exactly like them.

1031
00:53:28,573 --> 00:53:31,676
So, I went
to Mr. Spretnik yesterday

1032
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:34,345
about Brooke
already having nine absences

1033
00:53:34,379 --> 00:53:35,546
in my class this year.

1034
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:37,682
And this morning I see this.

1035
00:53:39,484 --> 00:53:41,652
Wait, that says
she's been absent three times.

1036
00:53:41,686 --> 00:53:42,753
Exactly.
It's been changed.

1037
00:53:42,787 --> 00:53:46,524
Yesterday, it says nine,
this morning, it says three,

1038
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:47,992
and I didn't change it.

1039
00:53:48,025 --> 00:53:50,361
Could one of the girls
have accessed the server?

1040
00:53:51,529 --> 00:53:52,830
Yeah, it's possible.

1041
00:53:52,863 --> 00:53:55,533
But it's also possible
they didn't have to

1042
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:57,902
because someone in that office
did it for them.

1043
00:53:58,636 --> 00:54:01,439
You know, I tried to avoid

1044
00:54:01,472 --> 00:54:03,608
doing what everybody else here
does,

1045
00:54:03,641 --> 00:54:06,611
and that's just hunker down,
watch the calendar,

1046
00:54:06,644 --> 00:54:09,580
and wait for those little
monsters to graduate.

1047
00:54:09,614 --> 00:54:12,983
But if it's gonna be like this?

1048
00:54:13,017 --> 00:54:14,519
Screw it.
I'm done fighting.

1049
00:54:14,552 --> 00:54:16,921
I don't care anymore.

1050
00:54:21,392 --> 00:54:24,562
Jeri's mom appealed,
Tabitha's mom, Lisa's dad.

1051
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:27,698
Brooke, do you have any idea
how hard this is for me?

1052
00:54:27,732 --> 00:54:28,799
Look, this isn't fair!

1053
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:30,301
No one would care
about that video

1054
00:54:30,335 --> 00:54:31,669
If you weren't my mom.

1055
00:54:31,702 --> 00:54:33,904
You're probably right,
which is why I don't know

1056
00:54:33,938 --> 00:54:35,906
whether to ground you
or feel sorry for you.

1057
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,308
Why don't you just bite me?

1058
00:54:37,342 --> 00:54:38,619
Okay, you know what, Brooke?
You're grounded.

1059
00:54:38,643 --> 00:54:40,945
Go ahead.
Try it, lorene.

1060
00:54:40,978 --> 00:54:42,780
I'm gonna call daddy.

1061
00:54:42,813 --> 00:54:44,682
I'll tell him
if I can't live with him,

1062
00:54:44,715 --> 00:54:45,550
then I'll disappear,
and this time,

1063
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:48,285
neither of you will ever
see me again.

1064
00:54:49,854 --> 00:54:50,854
And that's a promise.

1065
00:54:57,662 --> 00:54:59,764
It's central office.

1066
00:55:07,872 --> 00:55:09,574
That was unnecessary.

1067
00:55:11,108 --> 00:55:13,611
Lorene tippit.

1068
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:14,612
Hello, Mr. Tompkins.

1069
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:16,714
Yeah, fine, thank you.

1070
00:55:19,684 --> 00:55:22,587
I could not agree with you more.

1071
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:25,055
Yes.

1072
00:55:25,089 --> 00:55:27,525
Thank you so much for calling.

1073
00:55:27,558 --> 00:55:28,558
I will,

1074
00:55:30,695 --> 00:55:32,597
That was vern tompkins,

1075
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:34,632
and he has decided
to reduce the suspension

1076
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:36,567
to 15 days plus probation.

1077
00:55:40,471 --> 00:55:42,573
Yeah, well, no thanks to you.

1078
00:55:45,943 --> 00:55:48,746
The parents don't want the girls
to have consequences,

1079
00:55:48,779 --> 00:55:50,691
the school doesn't want 'em
to have consequences,

1080
00:55:50,715 --> 00:55:53,751
and now even the district
is backing off.

1081
00:55:53,784 --> 00:55:55,696
So, if no one else cares,
why should I be the one

1082
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:58,423
beating my head
against the wall?

1083
00:55:58,456 --> 00:56:00,458
Because it's not like you
to back down

1084
00:56:00,491 --> 00:56:02,593
from fighting
for what you think is right.

1085
00:56:02,627 --> 00:56:04,429
Well, maybe I should start doing

1086
00:56:04,462 --> 00:56:06,597
what people with more experience
are doing,

1087
00:56:06,631 --> 00:56:08,733
and all they're doing
is watching the calendar

1088
00:56:08,766 --> 00:56:10,134
until the fab five are gone,

1089
00:56:10,167 --> 00:56:12,136
so, fine, I can do that, too.

1090
00:56:12,169 --> 00:56:13,838
What do you want me to say?

1091
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:16,507
That it's okay
not to rock the boat?

1092
00:56:16,541 --> 00:56:18,943
'Cause it is. I mean, I've been
in the corporate world.

1093
00:56:18,976 --> 00:56:20,945
I know how futile it is.

1094
00:56:20,978 --> 00:56:22,689
Why do you think I went back
to get my degree?

1095
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:26,016
Hon, I know you think

1096
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:27,918
cheerleading is
some high, holy mission,

1097
00:56:27,952 --> 00:56:30,655
but it's not like
there are lives at stake here.

1098
00:56:34,959 --> 00:56:39,630
Maybe you're right.
I'm just not feeling that good.

1099
00:56:39,664 --> 00:56:40,841
I'm gonna make some tea.
Do you want some?

1100
00:56:40,865 --> 00:56:44,535
No, I'm fine.
Thanks.

1101
00:56:44,569 --> 00:56:46,036
Okay.

1102
00:56:51,776 --> 00:56:54,144
Okay, so, we're gonna go
low "v," high "v,"

1103
00:56:54,178 --> 00:56:56,814
touchdown, tabletop, "t,"
okay? Three claps.

1104
00:56:56,847 --> 00:56:58,816
Great, all right, now,
you guys...

1105
00:56:58,849 --> 00:57:00,885
Yeah, legs a little
closer together.

1106
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:03,688
Hey, guys?
Sorry to interrupt.

1107
00:57:03,721 --> 00:57:05,723
Coach carr just called,

1108
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:07,868
and, unfortunately, she's home
sick today with the flu.

1109
00:57:07,892 --> 00:57:09,494
What are you?
Her errand boy now?

1110
00:57:12,229 --> 00:57:16,567
So, she asked me
to put Megan in charge.

1111
00:57:16,601 --> 00:57:19,637
Try to remember that
you're still on probation, okay?

1112
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,785
All right, you guys,
let's bring it together.

1113
00:57:24,809 --> 00:57:25,886
Let's try this again.
Ready?

1114
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:27,545
What a total jackass.

1115
00:57:27,578 --> 00:57:29,714
I can't believe you actually
worshipped his junk.

1116
00:57:29,747 --> 00:57:31,716
Temporary insanity.

1117
00:57:31,749 --> 00:57:35,185
Look what I jacked.

1118
00:57:35,219 --> 00:57:37,488
I love your mom.

1119
00:57:37,522 --> 00:57:40,190
Let's bounce.

1120
00:57:40,224 --> 00:57:41,926
Very good.

1121
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:43,861
Okay, lock out.

1122
00:57:43,894 --> 00:57:45,763
Hey, Megan,
we're gonna leave, all right?

1123
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:46,664
I don't care
what you do, Brooke.

1124
00:57:46,697 --> 00:57:48,833
No!

1125
00:57:51,569 --> 00:57:53,704
You suck so bad,
you make this whole squad...

1126
00:57:53,738 --> 00:57:55,472
Leave her alone.

1127
00:57:56,574 --> 00:58:00,110
Do you really want
to do this again?

1128
00:58:00,144 --> 00:58:03,581
Okay, chill, badass.
We're out. Let's go.

1129
00:58:03,614 --> 00:58:05,249
Let's go.

1130
00:58:11,656 --> 00:58:13,123
Take this.

1131
00:58:13,157 --> 00:58:14,925
Get it.

1132
00:58:14,959 --> 00:58:16,561
Here.
Here. Here. Here.

1133
00:58:16,594 --> 00:58:17,738
Let's go to the mall.

1134
00:58:17,762 --> 00:58:18,905
I don't want to go to the mall.

1135
00:58:18,929 --> 00:58:20,297
It's old and stupid.

1136
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,808
Well, then let's go to Harris'
or something.

1137
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:24,301
Maybe he'll get US high.

1138
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:27,705
We can't go to Harris'.
He's not off work yet.

1139
00:58:27,738 --> 00:58:29,607
Let's just go somewhere,
all right?

1140
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:30,751
It's so stupid to waste
a buzz here. Fine.

1141
00:58:30,775 --> 00:58:32,843
Here.
Come on.

1142
00:58:32,877 --> 00:58:34,579
Some adventure.

1143
00:58:34,612 --> 00:58:35,989
Getting frisky.
I'm fricking hungry.

1144
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:38,215
Tab, kill this.

1145
00:58:40,217 --> 00:58:41,619
Go! Go! Go!

1146
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:52,196
Um...

1147
00:58:52,229 --> 00:58:52,597
Um...

1148
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:54,932
He's hot.

1149
00:58:54,965 --> 00:58:57,868
You pulled this car out
way too fast, young lady.

1150
00:58:57,902 --> 00:58:59,870
You have an off-campus pass?

1151
00:58:59,904 --> 00:59:03,808
No, but we have permission
to leave.

1152
00:59:03,841 --> 00:59:06,977
If you don't have a pass,
then you need to park your car.

1153
00:59:07,011 --> 00:59:09,313
Do you know who I am?

1154
00:59:09,346 --> 00:59:11,682
Yes, I do.

1155
00:59:11,716 --> 00:59:13,217
Now park the car.

1156
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:15,586
Look, okay,
you can go call Mr. Spretnik

1157
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:16,553
on your little radio,

1158
00:59:16,587 --> 00:59:18,956
and he'll tell you
we're allowed to leave.

1159
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:21,959
Hey, Joe.
What's going on?

1160
00:59:21,992 --> 00:59:25,095
Hey, there, b.L.T.

1161
00:59:25,129 --> 00:59:28,766
You girls need to get
out of this car right now.

1162
00:59:45,215 --> 00:59:48,352
O0 c1

1163
00:59:48,385 --> 00:59:51,155
Could we be any more fascinating
to these losers?

1164
00:59:51,188 --> 00:59:53,223
The curmudgeons are on time.

1165
01:00:08,739 --> 01:00:11,175
You know,
it's really funny to me.

1166
01:00:11,208 --> 01:00:13,878
This is actually a prop
for a health-class project.

1167
01:00:13,911 --> 01:00:16,346
You know, I found it

1168
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:19,917
in the trash can
by the science lab.

1169
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:23,353
Why don't... why don't you girls
just tell me what happened?

1170
01:00:23,387 --> 01:00:27,057
Well, now,
we just took a huge test,

1171
01:00:27,091 --> 01:00:30,160
and we were all tired,
and we needed some fresh air.

1172
01:00:30,194 --> 01:00:33,397
I was running, and it was really
stupid of me, but I fell.

1173
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:35,866
Go figure.
She scraped her knee.

1174
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:44,842
Em.

1175
01:00:47,712 --> 01:00:51,716
You got to hear this.

1176
01:00:51,749 --> 01:00:53,250
Everyone is saying
you were the one

1177
01:00:53,283 --> 01:00:54,952
that caught them
in the parking lot.

1178
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:56,053
You didn't write them up?

1179
01:00:56,086 --> 01:00:57,287
No, I didn't.

1180
01:00:57,321 --> 01:00:59,924
But they were drinking
on school grounds!

1181
01:00:59,957 --> 01:01:01,001
There was no alcohol
in the bottle,

1182
01:01:01,025 --> 01:01:03,393
no proof they were drinking.

1183
01:01:03,427 --> 01:01:05,029
And as for this skipping thing,

1184
01:01:05,062 --> 01:01:06,139
I think there's a lot
of gray area there.

1185
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:08,432
I mean, the other squad captain

1186
01:01:08,465 --> 01:01:09,934
gave them permission to go home.

1187
01:01:09,967 --> 01:01:10,968
Who? Megan?

1188
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:12,236
Since when can a student

1189
01:01:12,269 --> 01:01:14,180
give another student
permission to leave school?!

1190
01:01:14,204 --> 01:01:16,040
Lorene,
you have to write them up!

1191
01:01:16,073 --> 01:01:17,274
Keep pushing me,

1192
01:01:17,307 --> 01:01:19,309
and I will dissolve this program
altogether.

1193
01:01:19,343 --> 01:01:21,378
There will be
no more cheerleaders,

1194
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:22,989
and I will let everyone know
that you're responsible.

1195
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:25,015
Now, I have an appointment.

1196
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:27,918
Lorene, before you go...

1197
01:01:27,952 --> 01:01:29,754
Those girls have violated
their probation.

1198
01:01:29,787 --> 01:01:31,321
They need to be removed
from the squad.

1199
01:01:31,355 --> 01:01:33,233
I am not about to deliver
permanent consequences

1200
01:01:33,257 --> 01:01:35,025
for an offense
I'm not sure they committed.

1201
01:01:35,059 --> 01:01:36,994
This isn't
about embarrassing stuff

1202
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:38,495
on the Internet anymore.

1203
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:41,265
They are becoming a danger
to themselves and others.

1204
01:01:41,298 --> 01:01:42,900
This conversation is over.

1205
01:01:42,933 --> 01:01:43,633
Why do you help these girls

1206
01:01:43,667 --> 01:01:45,169
get away
with whatever they want?

1207
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:46,336
I know why lorene does it.

1208
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:47,104
She thinks
it'll convince her daughter

1209
01:01:47,137 --> 01:01:48,973
that she loves her.

1210
01:01:49,006 --> 01:01:50,074
But what's in it for you?

1211
01:01:50,107 --> 01:01:51,776
All right,
you are becoming irrational.

1212
01:01:51,809 --> 01:01:52,919
Maybe you need
to take another day off

1213
01:01:52,943 --> 01:01:54,087
until you're feeling...
wasn't it you that altered

1214
01:01:54,111 --> 01:01:56,947
Brooke tippit's attendance
record in coach reeve's class?

1215
01:01:56,981 --> 01:01:58,258
All right,
you're completely out of line.

1216
01:01:58,282 --> 01:02:00,017
This whole school
is out of line!

1217
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:01,995
And if you're not gonna
hold these girls accountable

1218
01:02:02,019 --> 01:02:02,887
for their actions,

1219
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,855
I will hold them accountable
as a squad.

1220
01:02:04,889 --> 01:02:06,099
I will cancel all activities
outside the classroom.

1221
01:02:06,123 --> 01:02:08,859
I will see them at practices,
and that's it.

1222
01:02:08,893 --> 01:02:09,794
If you're refusing

1223
01:02:09,827 --> 01:02:11,829
to perform your duties
as cheerleading coach,

1224
01:02:11,862 --> 01:02:13,306
then I'll just accept that
as your resignation.

1225
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:15,199
No, I am not resigning!

1226
01:02:15,232 --> 01:02:16,066
You are gonna be dealing with me

1227
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:17,902
until you handle this
the right way.

1228
01:02:24,141 --> 01:02:26,276
Why are you making US pay
for what they did?

1229
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:29,146
I know this is hard
to understand,

1230
01:02:29,179 --> 01:02:31,481
but if rules are broken,
there have to be consequences.

1231
01:02:31,515 --> 01:02:33,050
And these are
the only consequences

1232
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:34,227
I have in my power to deliver.

1233
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:36,787
You said you would never quit
on US.

1234
01:02:36,821 --> 01:02:37,888
I'm not quitting.

1235
01:02:37,922 --> 01:02:39,199
I'm trying to force a change
in discipline policy.

1236
01:02:39,223 --> 01:02:41,391
Can you understand that?

1237
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:43,069
Yeah, but I'm tired of them
getting away with everything

1238
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:45,863
and making US all look bad.

1239
01:02:45,896 --> 01:02:48,332
You're not hurting US,
you know?

1240
01:02:48,365 --> 01:02:51,201
You're just gonna make everyone
else hate you as much as we do.

1241
01:02:51,235 --> 01:02:53,270
Leave.

1242
01:02:53,303 --> 01:02:56,173
Make me.

1243
01:02:56,206 --> 01:02:58,184
Practice is canceled today.
You can all go home early.

1244
01:02:58,208 --> 01:03:00,277
I'll let the office know.

1245
01:03:13,157 --> 01:03:14,334
What are you still doing here?

1246
01:03:14,358 --> 01:03:17,227
Waiting for Mr. Studdard.
He said he'd be here at 3:15.

1247
01:03:17,261 --> 01:03:20,965
You went to central office
with your cheerleader problems?

1248
01:03:20,998 --> 01:03:23,600
Well, I think he should know
what's going on here, don't you?

1249
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,211
Do you know
what lorene's gonna do to you

1250
01:03:25,235 --> 01:03:26,971
when she finds out
you went over her head?

1251
01:03:27,004 --> 01:03:27,838
She left me no choice.

1252
01:03:27,872 --> 01:03:30,040
She won't even talk to me
about it.

1253
01:03:30,074 --> 01:03:31,184
Now, obviously,
Mr. Studdard won't either.

1254
01:03:31,208 --> 01:03:34,044
What is wrong
with this district?!

1255
01:03:34,078 --> 01:03:36,213
Everyone is just burying
their heads in the sand.

1256
01:03:41,952 --> 01:03:44,088
Hi.

1257
01:03:44,121 --> 01:03:45,131
The girls were just telling me
about what happened today,

1258
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:47,224
and they're pretty upset
about it.

1259
01:03:47,257 --> 01:03:49,493
Janice, I need your help.

1260
01:03:49,526 --> 01:03:51,862
Come on in.

1261
01:03:55,065 --> 01:03:57,001
Wait.
What's going on here?

1262
01:03:59,203 --> 01:04:02,039
After meeting with coach carr

1263
01:04:02,072 --> 01:04:04,308
and a number
of the booster parents,

1264
01:04:04,341 --> 01:04:06,543
Mr. Spretnik and I
have decided

1265
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:09,046
that you girls
will be written up

1266
01:04:09,079 --> 01:04:10,090
for skipping class on Tuesday.

1267
01:04:10,114 --> 01:04:13,183
And this is because
of what she wants?

1268
01:04:15,819 --> 01:04:19,256
Most of the girls will receive
10 to 12 demerits total.

1269
01:04:19,289 --> 01:04:22,326
But jeri already has 10,
so 20 is now her total.

1270
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:24,228
And 20 means removal
from the squad.

1271
01:04:24,261 --> 01:04:26,163
That's it, jeri.
You're off the squad.

1272
01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:28,632
Really?
I mean, really?

1273
01:04:28,665 --> 01:04:31,568
Because my mom is gonna be very
interested to hear about this.

1274
01:04:33,303 --> 01:04:35,248
This is twice now that you've
gotten me kicked off the squad.

1275
01:04:35,272 --> 01:04:38,675
For what?!
What did I ever do to you?

1276
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,111
Jeri, this isn't about
what you've done to me.

1277
01:04:41,145 --> 01:04:42,679
She is totally manipulating you,

1278
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:44,414
and you're letting her,
aren't you?

1279
01:04:44,448 --> 01:04:46,650
Aren't you?!

1280
01:04:46,683 --> 01:04:48,252
Answer me!

1281
01:04:48,285 --> 01:04:50,054
Answer me!

1282
01:04:58,028 --> 01:05:00,998
So, if you're wondering
why I'm giving you erasers,

1283
01:05:01,031 --> 01:05:02,308
well, we've had
a pretty rough time.

1284
01:05:02,332 --> 01:05:05,002
And I know this is cheesy,

1285
01:05:05,035 --> 01:05:07,637
but this is what
my high-school coach used to do

1286
01:05:07,671 --> 01:05:10,107
when she wanted US
to start fresh.

1287
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:12,342
And that's what
this squad needs...

1288
01:05:12,376 --> 01:05:14,144
A fresh start.

1289
01:05:20,985 --> 01:05:23,420
Would you like me to tell you
where you can put that eraser?

1290
01:05:23,453 --> 01:05:25,222
Disrespect to a teacher
is 10 demerits.

1291
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:27,224
So, go ahead, tell me.

1292
01:05:31,395 --> 01:05:32,729
Sorry, coach.

1293
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:36,333
But I'm respectfully declining
your eraser.

1294
01:05:55,519 --> 01:05:57,287
Hey.

1295
01:05:57,321 --> 01:05:58,255
Did she say anything about me?

1296
01:05:58,288 --> 01:06:01,491
No,
she just gave US these. You took it?

1297
01:06:01,525 --> 01:06:04,128
Why didn't you tell her
to stick it up her ass?

1298
01:06:04,161 --> 01:06:05,129
Why didn't you?

1299
01:06:05,162 --> 01:06:07,531
You know what?
This is our squad, our school.

1300
01:06:07,564 --> 01:06:10,300
We were here before that bitch.
And you know what?

1301
01:06:10,334 --> 01:06:16,506
We're gonna be here
after she's gone.

1302
01:06:20,544 --> 01:06:22,255
Someone should know about it. And
you say this, um, this affair has been going on

1303
01:06:22,279 --> 01:06:23,656
since before last semester?
Yes, sir.

1304
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:27,284
I definitely
heard coach carr say to him,

1305
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:29,419
"what if your wife
finds out?"

1306
01:06:29,453 --> 01:06:31,693
All right, well, just keep this
to yourselves, all right?

1307
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:32,721
I'll take care of it.

1308
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:40,606
I need you to come with me
and sit through the first round

1309
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:42,666
of Pamela Blackburn's appeal

1310
01:06:42,699 --> 01:06:45,602
over jeri being removed
from your squad.

1311
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:55,812
At camp this summer,

1312
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:57,747
did you or did you not
encourage the girls

1313
01:06:57,781 --> 01:07:01,551
to break curfew
and go with you to buy tape

1314
01:07:01,585 --> 01:07:04,688
for the purpose of playing
pranks on the other girls?

1315
01:07:04,721 --> 01:07:07,457
Yes, but I didn't
consider it breaking curfew,

1316
01:07:07,491 --> 01:07:08,501
because they were with me.

1317
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:09,426
And did you let them get away

1318
01:07:09,459 --> 01:07:11,795
with sending
a sexually explicit message

1319
01:07:11,828 --> 01:07:14,131
to coach reeve
from your cellphone?

1320
01:07:14,164 --> 01:07:16,366
No, I didn't let them
get away with it!

1321
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,668
But you didn't give them
any formal punishment.

1322
01:07:23,407 --> 01:07:25,318
So, if you let them
break some rules and not others,

1323
01:07:25,342 --> 01:07:26,110
how are they supposed to know
where you draw the line?

1324
01:07:26,143 --> 01:07:29,313
The line at school
is very clear.

1325
01:07:29,346 --> 01:07:32,249
Drinking is not allowed.
Neither is skipping class.

1326
01:07:34,818 --> 01:07:39,756
Did you frequently flirt
with coach reeve, a married man,

1327
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:43,593
in front of the girls?

1328
01:07:43,627 --> 01:07:45,495
Lorene, why am I the one
on trial here?

1329
01:07:45,529 --> 01:07:48,332
We're supposed to be discussing
jeri's behavior issues.

1330
01:07:48,365 --> 01:07:50,100
Emma, you can't kick a girl
off the squad

1331
01:07:50,134 --> 01:07:53,837
and not have questions raised
about how that came about.

1332
01:07:53,870 --> 01:07:57,241
I'm curious
to hear your answers.

1333
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:02,612
1, 2...

1334
01:08:02,646 --> 01:08:03,847
Wait.

1335
01:08:05,882 --> 01:08:07,184
Come on, you guys.

1336
01:08:07,217 --> 01:08:09,286
You haven't hit this
once yet today.

1337
01:08:09,319 --> 01:08:10,620
Let's try it again.
Come on.

1338
01:08:10,654 --> 01:08:13,623
1, 2...

1339
01:08:13,657 --> 01:08:15,525
Come on. Stay.
Stay. Stay. Stay straight.

1340
01:08:15,559 --> 01:08:17,261
No, no, no!

1341
01:08:17,294 --> 01:08:18,762
No, wait.

1342
01:08:22,532 --> 01:08:23,633
Get up.

1343
01:08:23,667 --> 01:08:27,137
Cindy, get up!

1344
01:08:27,171 --> 01:08:28,438
I can't do it.

1345
01:08:28,472 --> 01:08:29,639
Yes, you can.
Get up.

1346
01:08:31,475 --> 01:08:32,642
Okay.

1347
01:08:35,612 --> 01:08:37,781
I'm not helping much, am I?

1348
01:08:37,814 --> 01:08:40,550
You're straightening your arms
too early,

1349
01:08:40,584 --> 01:08:41,918
so it's throwing
your balance off.

1350
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:43,829
So, I want you to stay up
straight until you're up

1351
01:08:43,853 --> 01:08:46,223
and then extend your arms.

1352
01:08:46,256 --> 01:08:47,624
Can we do that?

1353
01:08:47,657 --> 01:08:49,726
Can we all try this again? Yeah.

1354
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:52,796
Okay.
Ready, 1, 2.

1355
01:08:52,829 --> 01:08:55,865
Down... straight.
Cindy, Cindy, squeeze!

1356
01:08:55,899 --> 01:08:57,567
Squeeze, squeeze.
You got it?

1357
01:08:57,601 --> 01:09:00,204
Yes, yes! Whoo!

1358
01:09:05,309 --> 01:09:07,211
Good job, Cindy!

1359
01:09:08,712 --> 01:09:10,714
See, I told you.

1360
01:09:10,747 --> 01:09:14,251
Good job.

1361
01:09:14,284 --> 01:09:15,719
I had a makeup test.

1362
01:09:15,752 --> 01:09:18,855
Hey, red, how'd you do?

1363
01:09:18,888 --> 01:09:20,857
I nailed it.

1364
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:22,226
Okay.

1365
01:09:27,297 --> 01:09:30,700
Lisa, what's that on your leg?

1366
01:09:30,734 --> 01:09:31,968
Nothing.

1367
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:33,770
I didn't cheat.

1368
01:09:34,771 --> 01:09:35,872
Okay, fine.

1369
01:09:35,905 --> 01:09:39,576
I wrote the test answers
on my leg.

1370
01:09:39,609 --> 01:09:39,943
Big whoop.

1371
01:09:39,976 --> 01:09:42,279
All right.

1372
01:09:42,312 --> 01:09:44,324
I'm gonna have to write you up
for academic dishonesty.

1373
01:09:44,348 --> 01:09:46,216
You're gonna be benched
for another two weeks.

1374
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:48,428
You're just trying to keep me
out of the crosstown showdown,

1375
01:09:48,452 --> 01:09:49,495
just like you're doing to jeri.

1376
01:09:49,519 --> 01:09:50,930
You guys need to start thinking
of consequences

1377
01:09:50,954 --> 01:09:54,358
before you break the rules.

1378
01:09:54,391 --> 01:09:56,726
Let's do it again.

1379
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:59,796
Cindy, okay, remember,
not straightened too soon.

1380
01:09:59,829 --> 01:10:03,600
I hate you!
Everyone hates you!

1381
01:10:03,633 --> 01:10:04,734
Why don't you just quit?!

1382
01:10:17,481 --> 01:10:19,816
Let's start with the dance,
okay?

1383
01:10:19,849 --> 01:10:21,751
Come on.
Let's go from the top.

1384
01:10:23,853 --> 01:10:27,691
5, 6, 7, 8.

1385
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:30,760
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

1386
01:10:30,794 --> 01:10:33,863
Hi, daddy?

1387
01:10:33,897 --> 01:10:36,366
I'm so sorry
to bother you at work,

1388
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,635
but remember
you said to call you

1389
01:10:38,668 --> 01:10:40,970
if coach carr starts
picking on me again?

1390
01:10:41,004 --> 01:10:45,709
1, look, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

1391
01:10:45,742 --> 01:10:49,746
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

1392
01:10:49,779 --> 01:10:53,450
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

1393
01:10:53,483 --> 01:10:54,150
My dad wants to talk to you.

1394
01:10:54,183 --> 01:10:56,420
He spoke
to Mr. Resinbrink,

1395
01:10:56,453 --> 01:10:58,655
and Mr. Resinbrink says
that you can't stop me

1396
01:10:58,688 --> 01:11:00,590
from performing
at the crosstown showdown,

1397
01:11:00,624 --> 01:11:01,391
that if you give me demerits,

1398
01:11:01,425 --> 01:11:04,561
you have to let me
work them off.

1399
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:05,929
Go ahead.

1400
01:11:05,962 --> 01:11:06,962
Talk to him.

1401
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:16,849
How can I coach
with no authority whatsoever?

1402
01:11:16,873 --> 01:11:19,376
You either need to make sure

1403
01:11:19,409 --> 01:11:21,411
I have some control
over this squad

1404
01:11:21,445 --> 01:11:22,211
or you tell supervisor tompkins

1405
01:11:22,245 --> 01:11:23,980
I'll resign
as cheerleading coach.

1406
01:11:24,013 --> 01:11:27,384
Hi, miss tippit.
Hi.

1407
01:11:27,417 --> 01:11:28,852
I need to see that in writing.

1408
01:11:28,885 --> 01:11:30,454
Okay.
Thank you.

1409
01:11:37,494 --> 01:11:38,395
You think I quit?

1410
01:11:38,428 --> 01:11:42,466
That's usually
what "I resign" means, yeah.

1411
01:11:42,499 --> 01:11:44,501
Lorene's not gonna accept
that resignation.

1412
01:11:44,534 --> 01:11:45,335
She knows I'm a good coach.

1413
01:11:45,369 --> 01:11:47,571
She just wanted me
to write it down

1414
01:11:47,604 --> 01:11:48,948
so she can take it to district
and show them,

1415
01:11:48,972 --> 01:11:49,906
"look,
we have a problem."

1416
01:11:49,939 --> 01:11:50,939
Did she tell you that?

1417
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:57,781
God, these girls
are gonna think I quit on them.

1418
01:11:57,814 --> 01:11:59,054
I need to write them an e-mail.

1419
01:12:05,889 --> 01:12:08,592
"This has been the most
meaningful time in my life.

1420
01:12:08,625 --> 01:12:11,027
You girls mean more to me
than you will ever know."

1421
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:12,362
Blah!

1422
01:12:13,497 --> 01:12:14,564
Mom!

1423
01:12:14,598 --> 01:12:16,566
You know what to say, right?

1424
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:17,667
I'm not an idiot.

1425
01:12:18,802 --> 01:12:20,370
Mom, come in here.

1426
01:12:20,404 --> 01:12:22,772
Mom, coach carr
sent US an e-mail.

1427
01:12:22,806 --> 01:12:24,741
You should read it.

1428
01:12:24,774 --> 01:12:26,710
I've been trying to tell you,
she's psycho.

1429
01:12:26,743 --> 01:12:29,012
My mom says coach carr's
an embarrassment.

1430
01:12:29,045 --> 01:12:31,715
She said she's mostly
embarrassed for you.

1431
01:12:31,748 --> 01:12:33,025
Superintendent tompkins
told my mother

1432
01:12:33,049 --> 01:12:36,019
he doesn't know
why you ever hired her.

1433
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:48,632
So, I read your e-mail
to the girls several times,

1434
01:12:48,665 --> 01:12:51,435
and I do have one question.

1435
01:12:51,468 --> 01:12:54,571
You wrote "whether or not I
continue this journey with you."

1436
01:12:57,441 --> 01:12:59,108
You do realize that your journey

1437
01:12:59,142 --> 01:13:03,012
here at Jackson is over, right?

1438
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:10,119
May I tell the girls
before I go?

1439
01:13:10,153 --> 01:13:11,888
No, you may not.

1440
01:13:11,921 --> 01:13:13,990
You're to leave campus
immediately.

1441
01:13:46,189 --> 01:13:48,658
What do you want?

1442
01:13:48,692 --> 01:13:51,695
We just heard
you're not our coach anymore.

1443
01:13:51,728 --> 01:13:53,463
I guess someone
didn't want you here?

1444
01:13:53,497 --> 01:13:57,200
You girls always get
what you want, don't you?

1445
01:13:57,233 --> 01:13:59,469
Yeah, you could say that.

1446
01:13:59,503 --> 01:14:01,771
You know, for a while there,
I thought you girls

1447
01:14:01,805 --> 01:14:03,807
were actually on your way
to becoming...

1448
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:06,209
Shut up.
Get out of our school.

1449
01:14:10,947 --> 01:14:13,082
I feel the most sorry
for you, Brooke.

1450
01:14:13,116 --> 01:14:14,350
You have so much potential,

1451
01:14:14,383 --> 01:14:17,621
and you just drove away the one
person willing to help you.

1452
01:14:27,230 --> 01:14:29,533
The meeting was a joke.

1453
01:14:29,566 --> 01:14:31,577
22 parents signed a letter
demanding your reinstatement,

1454
01:14:31,601 --> 01:14:34,971
and Mr. Studdard tried
to stop US from reading it.

1455
01:14:35,004 --> 01:14:36,281
Why did they bother
to hold the meeting

1456
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:38,017
if they had no intention
of listening to US?

1457
01:14:38,041 --> 01:14:39,876
How are the girls doing?

1458
01:14:39,909 --> 01:14:42,145
They feel abandoned.

1459
01:14:42,178 --> 01:14:44,948
Lorene told them
you quit on them.

1460
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:47,817
I know.
It's only going to get worse.

1461
01:14:47,851 --> 01:14:49,252
TV reporter called me.

1462
01:14:49,285 --> 01:14:50,596
She's doing a story
about the video on the Internet.

1463
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:53,022
And the questions she asked?

1464
01:14:53,056 --> 01:14:54,958
It's gonna be
a "cheerleaders gone wild."

1465
01:14:57,026 --> 01:14:58,895
What is this reporter's name?

1466
01:14:58,928 --> 01:15:00,930
You're not thinking
of talking to her.

1467
01:15:00,964 --> 01:15:02,608
Maybe I can talk her
out of doing the story.

1468
01:15:02,632 --> 01:15:04,801
I doubt that.
It's airing tonight.

1469
01:15:04,834 --> 01:15:07,571
Well, then I better go.
What's the station name?

1470
01:15:07,604 --> 01:15:09,673
What if she asks you
for an interview?

1471
01:15:09,706 --> 01:15:11,107
Then I'll do an interview.

1472
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:14,177
Coach Emma carr said she tried
to bring order to the team,

1473
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:16,212
leveling punishments
for offenses

1474
01:15:16,245 --> 01:15:17,914
ranging from skipping classes

1475
01:15:17,947 --> 01:15:19,683
to posting a sexually
suggestive video

1476
01:15:19,716 --> 01:15:20,750
on the Internet.

1477
01:15:20,784 --> 01:15:22,652
The Jackson high school
administration

1478
01:15:22,686 --> 01:15:24,721
declined our request
for an interview.

1479
01:15:24,754 --> 01:15:25,555
Carr said that her attempts
to... Why they'd blur our faces?

1480
01:15:25,589 --> 01:15:27,824
Shh. Shh. Shh.

1481
01:15:27,857 --> 01:15:29,068
By the high-school principal
lorene tippit,

1482
01:15:29,092 --> 01:15:30,894
who has a daughter on the squad.

1483
01:15:30,927 --> 01:15:33,262
Yes, I mean, some of the girls
behaved badly.

1484
01:15:33,296 --> 01:15:35,298
But the real problem
were the adults.

1485
01:15:35,331 --> 01:15:36,408
The school administration
enabled them,

1486
01:15:36,432 --> 01:15:39,669
the school district
refused to take interest,

1487
01:15:39,703 --> 01:15:40,670
and the girls' parents
did everything they could

1488
01:15:40,704 --> 01:15:42,739
to help them avoid consequences.

1489
01:15:42,772 --> 01:15:45,575
You know,
we are totally famous.

1490
01:15:48,912 --> 01:15:51,815
Feeling Paris Hilton?

1491
01:15:51,848 --> 01:15:53,617
More of a "Lindsay Lohan" vibe.

1492
01:15:53,650 --> 01:15:54,984
With a touch of Britney.

1493
01:15:55,018 --> 01:15:56,920
And her sister.

1494
01:15:56,953 --> 01:15:58,655
Girls, it's good to be bad.

1495
01:16:00,724 --> 01:16:03,993
The school board is very unhappy
about the publicity...

1496
01:16:04,027 --> 01:16:05,261
Very unhappy.

1497
01:16:05,294 --> 01:16:07,931
Once I realized
how unstable coach carr was,

1498
01:16:07,964 --> 01:16:09,733
I asked for her resignation.

1499
01:16:09,766 --> 01:16:11,367
Well, the board has asked me

1500
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,703
to hire
an independent investigator

1501
01:16:13,737 --> 01:16:16,172
to look into discipline issues
at Jackson.

1502
01:16:16,205 --> 01:16:18,775
But there are no discipline
issues at Jackson.

1503
01:16:18,808 --> 01:16:21,110
The problem here
was an immature teacher

1504
01:16:21,144 --> 01:16:22,378
who wasn't up to the job

1505
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:23,279
and is now using the media
to spread lies.

1506
01:16:23,312 --> 01:16:25,682
Yeah, I know,

1507
01:16:25,715 --> 01:16:28,184
and we're releasing a statement
to that effect.

1508
01:16:28,217 --> 01:16:30,586
Now, we expect the investigator
to tell US the same thing.

1509
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:36,626
Can you assure me

1510
01:16:36,660 --> 01:16:40,129
his investigation
will tell US the same thing?

1511
01:16:40,163 --> 01:16:42,398
I promise you, vern,
I will make sure

1512
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:44,868
that everyone at Jackson
cooperates

1513
01:16:44,901 --> 01:16:45,268
with your investigator.

1514
01:16:45,301 --> 01:16:48,872
Okay.

1515
01:16:58,381 --> 01:17:01,017
It's not true that I get
special treatment here.

1516
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:03,086
If anything,
people are even harder on me

1517
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:04,688
because my mom's the principal.

1518
01:17:04,721 --> 01:17:06,189
I would agree.

1519
01:17:06,222 --> 01:17:09,225
It's not easy being
the principal's daughter.

1520
01:17:09,258 --> 01:17:10,093
People watch her.

1521
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:13,262
They hold her
to a different standard.

1522
01:17:13,296 --> 01:17:15,164
I work 40 hours a week,

1523
01:17:15,198 --> 01:17:16,676
so I can't watch Tabitha
every moment.

1524
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:20,103
Yet, she motivates herself
to get good grades,

1525
01:17:20,136 --> 01:17:21,304
do volunteer work,

1526
01:17:21,337 --> 01:17:23,707
and work her ass off
as a cheerleader.

1527
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:24,540
She was so hot for coach reeve,

1528
01:17:24,573 --> 01:17:27,343
she'd ignore US
to flirt with him.

1529
01:17:27,376 --> 01:17:30,346
Here, I took this picture
of them on my phone.

1530
01:17:30,379 --> 01:17:32,682
I know a few parents

1531
01:17:32,716 --> 01:17:35,184
are asking
for her reinstatement.

1532
01:17:35,218 --> 01:17:36,720
And I hope
they do bring her back.

1533
01:17:36,753 --> 01:17:39,322
Then I can sue this school

1534
01:17:39,355 --> 01:17:41,858
for my daughter's
emotional suffering.

1535
01:17:45,862 --> 01:17:47,439
Mom, mom, if you would just
let me... please, stop.

1536
01:17:47,463 --> 01:17:50,133
Mother, just let me explain!

1537
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:53,770
I'm trying to... mom!

1538
01:17:53,803 --> 01:17:56,372
I'll take Cindy in first.
She's the most nervous.

1539
01:18:02,111 --> 01:18:03,346
So, was it weird?

1540
01:18:03,379 --> 01:18:07,851
If you're wondering whether
I told the truth or not, I did,

1541
01:18:07,884 --> 01:18:09,428
even though certain people
are gonna hate me

1542
01:18:09,452 --> 01:18:10,386
the rest of my life.

1543
01:18:10,419 --> 01:18:11,430
Yeah, but other people
are gonna respect you

1544
01:18:11,454 --> 01:18:12,421
for telling the truth.

1545
01:18:12,455 --> 01:18:13,489
Yeah, like who?

1546
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:15,458
I mean, if you haven't noticed,

1547
01:18:15,491 --> 01:18:17,026
I don't have friends anymore.

1548
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:18,227
Well, you could.

1549
01:18:18,261 --> 01:18:20,296
You could have
a whole squad full of them.

1550
01:18:20,329 --> 01:18:22,298
If you wanted them.

1551
01:18:29,505 --> 01:18:31,875
Hello?

1552
01:18:31,908 --> 01:18:32,876
Emma, it's Helen and Adam.

1553
01:18:32,909 --> 01:18:35,879
God, it's so good
to hear from you guys.

1554
01:18:35,912 --> 01:18:38,848
Lorene forbid everybody on staff
to speak to you.

1555
01:18:38,882 --> 01:18:41,785
You're kidding me.
Well, then why are you calling?

1556
01:18:41,818 --> 01:18:43,352
So I could tell you
how pissed I am

1557
01:18:43,386 --> 01:18:45,297
that you're dragging US
into this investigation thing.

1558
01:18:45,321 --> 01:18:47,256
Stop it.

1559
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:48,291
He's not mad at you.

1560
01:18:48,324 --> 01:18:50,526
It's just... the investigator
was grilling him

1561
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:52,962
about the two of you,

1562
01:18:52,996 --> 01:18:54,006
asking if there was
a sexual relationship,

1563
01:18:54,030 --> 01:18:56,766
if you had every acted
inappropriately with him.

1564
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,134
Yeah, my wife wants to know

1565
01:18:58,167 --> 01:18:59,468
why they're asking
that question.

1566
01:18:59,502 --> 01:19:02,071
God, I am so sorry.

1567
01:19:02,105 --> 01:19:03,973
I don't see the point
of all this, Emma.

1568
01:19:04,007 --> 01:19:05,918
It's not like you're gonna
be able to take lorene down.

1569
01:19:05,942 --> 01:19:07,243
I'm not trying to take her down.

1570
01:19:07,276 --> 01:19:08,988
I'm just trying
to change things for the girls.

1571
01:19:09,012 --> 01:19:10,947
You should be trying
to get your job back.

1572
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:13,516
I just hope this investigator's
gonna find out the truth.

1573
01:19:13,549 --> 01:19:16,853
They didn't hire him
to find the truth, em.

1574
01:19:28,865 --> 01:19:32,501
You look
a little... Uncomfortable.

1575
01:19:32,535 --> 01:19:35,471
That's because
I am uncomfortable.

1576
01:19:35,504 --> 01:19:38,074
With the process or with me?

1577
01:19:38,107 --> 01:19:40,509
I welcome the process.
I just don't trust you.

1578
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:42,378
From what I hear,

1579
01:19:42,411 --> 01:19:43,555
you've been paid
to hang me out to dry.

1580
01:19:43,579 --> 01:19:48,417
This isn't
a very auspicious start.

1581
01:19:48,451 --> 01:19:50,887
Well, you did say
you wanted me to be honest.

1582
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:53,489
Yes, I did.

1583
01:20:09,572 --> 01:20:11,174
What are you doing here?

1584
01:20:11,207 --> 01:20:14,010
Talking to the investigator.

1585
01:20:14,043 --> 01:20:15,611
He's not gonna believe
a word you said.

1586
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:19,115
Do you know what
all this means for you?

1587
01:20:19,148 --> 01:20:20,592
My life is exactly the way
I want it to be.

1588
01:20:20,616 --> 01:20:24,220
Is that right?

1589
01:20:24,253 --> 01:20:25,597
With this video of you
on the Internet

1590
01:20:25,621 --> 01:20:28,524
and the stories in the media,

1591
01:20:28,557 --> 01:20:31,227
do you really think
that usc's gonna accept you

1592
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:33,329
as a student,
let alone a song girl?

1593
01:20:42,471 --> 01:20:46,375
After conducting
over 70 interviews,

1594
01:20:46,409 --> 01:20:48,945
I believe I've identified
the source of the problems

1595
01:20:48,978 --> 01:20:50,613
with the cheerleading program.

1596
01:20:50,646 --> 01:20:53,149
As you know, the most recent
coach, Emma carr, quit

1597
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:54,417
in an untimely fashion,

1598
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:57,620
then unwisely took her accounts
to the media.

1599
01:20:57,653 --> 01:21:01,090
However...

1600
01:21:01,124 --> 01:21:03,026
I find her actions
understandable

1601
01:21:03,059 --> 01:21:05,628
given the problems
she encountered at Jackson,

1602
01:21:05,661 --> 01:21:08,464
problems centered on a popular
group of cheerleaders

1603
01:21:08,497 --> 01:21:10,033
who were highly resistant
to authority.

1604
01:21:10,066 --> 01:21:13,469
These girls were literally given
carte blanche

1605
01:21:13,502 --> 01:21:15,939
to behave as they pleased
by their parents

1606
01:21:15,972 --> 01:21:18,942
and by the school
administration.

1607
01:21:18,975 --> 01:21:21,344
Regrettably, I found

1608
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:24,480
that Jackson's principal,
lorene tippit, failed to juggle

1609
01:21:24,513 --> 01:21:27,550
two of the most important
responsibilities in her life...

1610
01:21:27,583 --> 01:21:29,986
Principal and mother.

1611
01:21:30,019 --> 01:21:32,255
And it is she who is accountable

1612
01:21:32,288 --> 01:21:35,324
for this situation
we find ourselves in today.

1613
01:21:47,703 --> 01:21:48,504
Entertain me.

1614
01:21:48,537 --> 01:21:50,974
Why aren't the four of you
in class?

1615
01:21:51,007 --> 01:21:53,018
We're just waiting for my mom
to get out of her meeting.

1616
01:21:53,042 --> 01:21:55,578
And, of course,
this takes all four of you.

1617
01:21:55,611 --> 01:21:59,015
That's the "fab four"
to you, reeve.

1618
01:22:15,264 --> 01:22:17,600
I have been placed
on suspension,

1619
01:22:17,633 --> 01:22:19,368
and so has Mr. Spretnik.

1620
01:22:19,402 --> 01:22:24,107
The report faulted me
when all I've ever tried to do

1621
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:25,574
is keep you out of this mess.

1622
01:22:25,608 --> 01:22:27,076
Okay, you know what?

1623
01:22:27,110 --> 01:22:27,843
Don't blame US
because your investigator

1624
01:22:27,876 --> 01:22:30,346
turned out to be a stupid moron!

1625
01:22:30,379 --> 01:22:31,547
You know what, Brooke?

1626
01:22:31,580 --> 01:22:33,649
You will never talk to me
like that again.

1627
01:22:33,682 --> 01:22:36,285
Now, go clean out your locker.

1628
01:22:36,319 --> 01:22:38,621
For what? 'Cause I'm
pulling you out of this school.

1629
01:22:38,654 --> 01:22:39,522
Like hell you are!

1630
01:22:39,555 --> 01:22:41,690
This is my school
and my senior year!

1631
01:22:41,724 --> 01:22:42,758
Not anymore it's not.

1632
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:45,661
Go clean out your locker.

1633
01:22:45,694 --> 01:22:47,663
Or what?

1634
01:22:47,696 --> 01:22:50,433
Or your mother is gonna drag you
to it by your hair!

1635
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:05,681
Excuse me, miss tippit?
What about US?

1636
01:23:05,714 --> 01:23:09,085
I don't know what your parents
are gonna do with you.

1637
01:23:09,118 --> 01:23:12,288
You're definitely gonna be
removed from the squad.

1638
01:23:12,321 --> 01:23:17,526
Your cheerleading days
in this district are over.

1639
01:23:22,731 --> 01:23:26,535
Let me get that for you.
There you go. Watch the...

1640
01:23:29,772 --> 01:23:31,807
Miss tippit!
Brooke!

1641
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,476
Miss tippet,
I'd like to have a word...

1642
01:23:33,509 --> 01:23:35,511
Do you have any comment?

1643
01:23:35,544 --> 01:23:37,546
Please, give US a comment.

1644
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:38,814
Any comment, Brooke?

1645
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:39,782
Please, people are asking.

1646
01:23:39,815 --> 01:23:43,352
Go away!

1647
01:23:43,386 --> 01:23:45,121
Brooke, anything
that you'd like to say?

1648
01:23:45,154 --> 01:23:46,765
Anything you would like to say?
Any comments?

1649
01:23:46,789 --> 01:23:49,692
Miss tippit, any comments?

1650
01:23:49,725 --> 01:23:51,627
Do you have any comments?

1651
01:23:51,660 --> 01:23:54,397
Miss tippit, please? Comments?
Any comments, miss tippet?

1652
01:23:54,430 --> 01:23:56,632
Tell US about what's going on
in the school.

1653
01:23:59,102 --> 01:24:00,769
Coach carr!
Coach carr!

1654
01:24:00,803 --> 01:24:02,805
Coach!
Coach carr!

1655
01:24:02,838 --> 01:24:04,773
Please, can we get a comment?

1656
01:24:04,807 --> 01:24:08,377
Anything, please.

1657
01:24:08,411 --> 01:24:11,580
Of course, I'm disappointed
superintendent tompkins decided

1658
01:24:11,614 --> 01:24:13,549
not to let me have my job back.

1659
01:24:13,582 --> 01:24:16,219
I loved being a coach.
I loved being a teacher.

1660
01:24:16,252 --> 01:24:18,087
But this whole thing...
It's not about me.

1661
01:24:18,121 --> 01:24:21,357
And I know you guys
are gonna continue

1662
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:24,227
to call this a "real life
'mean girls' story."

1663
01:24:24,260 --> 01:24:26,795
But it's not even
about what the girls did.

1664
01:24:26,829 --> 01:24:27,796
It's about
how they felt entitled

1665
01:24:27,830 --> 01:24:31,167
to the way
they were being treated

1666
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:32,768
by the lack of boundaries.

1667
01:24:32,801 --> 01:24:36,139
And I think all of US,
we have an obligation

1668
01:24:36,172 --> 01:24:39,074
to set boundaries
and stick by them.

1669
01:24:42,211 --> 01:24:44,580
Thought you'd be happier.

1670
01:24:44,613 --> 01:24:48,384
The report vindicated you.

1671
01:24:48,417 --> 01:24:52,255
Yeah, but jobs were lost,
reputations were ruined.

1672
01:24:52,288 --> 01:24:53,556
And for what?

1673
01:24:53,589 --> 01:24:56,292
What difference
did I really make?

1674
01:25:09,672 --> 01:25:10,773
Maybe I shouldn't be here.

1675
01:25:10,806 --> 01:25:12,341
You were invited.
Yeah, by Janice.

1676
01:25:12,375 --> 01:25:14,410
But what if the girls
don't want me to be here?

1677
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:16,412
Well, if you don't want
to say hi to the girls

1678
01:25:16,445 --> 01:25:18,614
because you think it's gonna
make them uncomfortable,

1679
01:25:18,647 --> 01:25:20,349
we can just watch them perform
and then go.

1680
01:25:20,383 --> 01:25:21,450
Okay.

1681
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:33,829
Emma.
Emma, over here.

1682
01:25:33,862 --> 01:25:37,400
How are you?

1683
01:25:37,433 --> 01:25:39,168
You got here just in time.

1684
01:25:39,202 --> 01:25:40,369
Janice.

1685
01:25:50,313 --> 01:25:53,416
Franklin Madison high school.

1686
01:26:05,494 --> 01:26:06,195
My gosh!

1687
01:26:06,229 --> 01:26:09,265
You guys!

1688
01:26:09,298 --> 01:26:12,235
I missed you.
Hi! Guys!

1689
01:26:12,268 --> 01:26:14,970
We're so glad to have you here,
but we're on next. Okay.

1690
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:16,339
We'll see you after, okay?

1691
01:26:16,372 --> 01:26:17,740
Okay.
Okay, good luck, you guys.

1692
01:26:17,773 --> 01:26:18,741
Bye!
Bye!

1693
01:26:18,774 --> 01:26:21,310
Jackson high school
may now take the floor.

1694
01:26:31,587 --> 01:26:33,422
Mom, mom!
Yeah. Yeah.

1695
01:26:33,456 --> 01:26:35,758
Tell her about my essay!
Bye!

1696
01:26:35,791 --> 01:26:37,360
In Cindy's English class,

1697
01:26:37,393 --> 01:26:40,729
she was given an assignment
to write an essay

1698
01:26:40,763 --> 01:26:42,731
about the person
she most admired

1699
01:26:42,765 --> 01:26:43,932
for overcoming adversity,

1700
01:26:43,966 --> 01:26:45,401
and she picked you.

1701
01:26:45,434 --> 01:26:47,736
She wrote
about how brave you were

1702
01:26:47,770 --> 01:26:50,005
for standing up
to the school district.

1703
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:50,939
If you like,
I'll print you out a copy.

1704
01:26:50,973 --> 01:26:54,009
And now, entering
our southwest regionals

1705
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:56,579
for the very first time,

1706
01:26:56,612 --> 01:26:59,748
let's give it up
for Jackson high!

1707
01:28:04,046 --> 01:28:06,915
Whoo!

1708
01:28:10,419 --> 01:28:13,322
Number one!

1709
01:28:20,929 --> 01:28:23,732
