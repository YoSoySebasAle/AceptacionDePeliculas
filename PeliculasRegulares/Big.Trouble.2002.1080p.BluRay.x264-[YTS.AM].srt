1
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,590
God said to Noah, "I am going
to put an end to all people

2
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:27,010
"for the Earth is filled
with violence because of them.

3
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,180
"You are to bring into the ark
two of all living creatures

4
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,850
to keep them alive with you."

5
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,560
In other words, life is hard,

6
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,650
so you better find someone
who will be your partner.

7
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,780
Eliot Arnold's story
is a lot like Noah's,

8
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,740
except Eliot's story
takes place in Miami.

9
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,120
You just can't beat these
when they're really fresh.

10
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,080
Anyway, Eliot should probably
tell you exactly what happened,

11
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,250
because I was locked in the trunk
of a police car for part of it.

12
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:05,260
My name's Puggy,
and I live in a tree.

13
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,300
I hope I didn't ruin anything
for you.

14
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,680
I Iook at this ad,

15
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,270
and it doesn't say
"Fish Hook Ale" to me.

16
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,520
This sucks.

17
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,770
Bruce, what
I'm trying to do --

18
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,190
Do you know what
my business philosophy is?

19
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,190
No, Bruce,
what is it?

20
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,520
My business philosophy

21
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,690
is that there a lot of people
in the world.

22
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:23,820
That certainly
isn't --

23
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:24,860
And all these people
want something.

24
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,900
Do you know what they want?

25
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,240
Well, I --

26
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,400
They want to feel good.
You know what I mean?

27
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,570
Yeah, well, I --

28
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:30,860
No, you don't know
what I mean,

29
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,620
because I gave you
the perfect concept,

30
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,330
which is not
this piece of shit here!

31
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:35,950
What the hell is this?!

32
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,790
Why are you saying "ugly"?!

33
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,500
I don't want to see ugly!

34
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,500
That's not the feeling
I want!

35
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,840
Bruce,
W-What I'm doing here

36
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,920
is -- is contrast
in a humorous fashion.

37
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,470
"Get hooked on Fish Hook" --
that's the concept!

38
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,510
You got a guy and a boat
and a girl.

39
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:55,850
The girI's in a bikini.
She has big tits.

40
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,930
They're on a boat, getting
shitfaced, drinking Fish Hook Ale.

41
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,940
The girl
has really big tits!

42
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,980
The feeling of this ad is
somebody's going to get laid.

43
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,650
It's perfect.
I gave you the perfect concept.

44
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:08,990
And you give me ugly?!

45
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,530
All right, all right,
Bruce, I'll try --

46
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,820
No, no. Don't tell me "try."
I hate the word "try."

47
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,370
"Try" is for losers.

48
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,120
Listen to me, you are not the
only ad agency in this town!

49
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,330
A year ago,
I had a nice house,

50
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,170
a beautiful wife,
and a job I really loved.

51
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,710
Now I was being called a loser
by "this" guy.

52
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,460
For 18 years, I wrote a column
for "The Miami Herald --"

53
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,470
funny stories the higher-ups
referred to as "offbeat."

54
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,180
Deeber wants
to see you.

55
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,980
Because I'd won two Pulitzer
Prizes for my offbeat stories,

56
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,520
I was pretty much left alone

57
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,310
and treated with a great deal
of respect...

58
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,230
until Ken Deeber came.

59
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,480
Eliot...

60
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,030
John Croton tells me you still
haven't turned anything in

61
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,610
on the day-care crisis.

62
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,360
Yeah, Ken, Iisten,
I figure with five peopIe

63
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,450
already working
on the day-care crisis story,

64
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:59,200
our readers pretty much know
there's a crisis in day care.

65
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,620
- Eliot, you were given an
assignment. -- I know that.

66
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,660
The pelican story?

67
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,290
Right.
No one else has it.

68
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,710
This old Cuban guy
is training pelicans --

69
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,550
To drop bombs -- the most
asinine thing I ever heard.

70
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,920
Come on. He tried to
kill Castro with a bird!

71
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,220
Eliot, I gave you an
assignment, and you will do it.

72
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,970
Or what, Ken?

73
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:18,260
Well, if you want to continue
working at this newspaper,

74
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,390
you will put something
in here before you go home.

75
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,350
Why don't I put something
in there right now?

76
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,730
Deeber picked
the wrong day to be a jerk.

77
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,480
Earlier that day,
I had found out

78
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,280
my wife was having an affair
with her tennis instructor.

79
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,320
In retrospect,

80
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,780
I should have written
the day-care crisis piece

81
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,370
and never opened
Eliot Arnold Advertising.

82
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,250
And if you think I'm gonna pay
for this stupid shit,

83
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,910
you can forget it!

84
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,250
I'm not paying for ugIy!
I can get ugIy for free!

85
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,960
It goes without saying,
Bruce.

86
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,630
Eliot.

87
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,260
Dad, I need to borrow
the Geo tonight.

88
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,890
Hello, Nigel.
How's London?

89
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:57,890
NigeI?

90
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,760
Foggy.

91
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,220
Ah, could you hold on, Nigel,
just for a moment?

92
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,230
This is a really important
call -- long-distance.

93
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:07,230
Listen, I want to see it
tomorrow, and it better be right!

94
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,520
All right, Bruce. I think we
got it, uh, well on its way!

95
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,520
Good!

96
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,030
Hey, Matt, how you doing?

97
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,490
Dad, can w-we borrow the
stupid Geo tonight or not?

98
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,450
Because me and Andrew
have to kill a girl.

99
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,910
"Andrew and "I"
have to kill a girl."

100
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,120
Thank you.

101
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,830
Yes, you can borrow
the Geo tonight,

102
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,460
but I need it back at my
apartment at, uh, 10:30, okay?

103
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,080
- Okay. -- And I want you to
promise me that you'll drive --

104
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,340
...carefully.

105
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,630
Matt wasn't mad at me
because of the divorce.

106
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,970
He was mad
because I bought a Geo.

107
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,510
Sweet little vehicle.

108
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,930
Just get divorced?

109
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,140
Ah, it doesn't matter.

110
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,180
42 miles to the gallon,
am/fm radio.

111
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,180
I'll even throw in
the undercoating.

112
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,600
Anything else
you'd like to know?

113
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,860
Yeah. How many clowns
can it hold?

114
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,940
To Matt, the Geo was
a 48-mile-per-gallon symbol

115
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,950
of my bad luck, wrong choices,
and missed opportunities.

116
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,290
Little did I know that my shot
at a second chance

117
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,710
had just arrived in Miami

118
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,460
onboard Flight 57
from New Orleans.

119
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,340
The suitcase
was sandwiched between

120
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,130
a quarter-ton of frozen crawfish

121
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,220
and a dalmatian that gave birth
to a litter of 17

122
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,850
over Lake Okeechobee.

123
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:26,930
The dalmatian
made the evening news.

124
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,890
The suitcase didn't.

125
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,020
What is it?

126
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,070
It looks like
a garbage disposal.

127
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,360
So this is Miami, huh?

128
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,450
They can keep it.

129
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,030
You got that right.

130
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,870
That's a Remington
30-aught-6 hunting rifle

131
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,580
with a Bushnell scope.

132
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,330
Charlton Heston takes his
to shoot bighorn elk.

133
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,210
Henry Desalvo
and Leonard Ferroni

134
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,670
take theirs to shoot "anyone,"

135
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,210
as long as they're paid
25 grand apiece.

136
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,930
We play with a guy
that cheats.

137
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:06,060
Actually, Henry and
Leonard didn't play golf at all.

138
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,350
Will you come on?
We've got an early tee time.

139
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:11,270
They were in Miami
to kill a man named Arthur Herk,

140
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,650
who had stolen money
from his employer.

141
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,240
Puggy arrived in Miami

142
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,950
the same day as the hit men
and the suitcase,

143
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,960
but for a much different reason.

144
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,580
A week earlier,
at his place in Boston,

145
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,130
Puggy read an article
in "Martha Stewart's Living"

146
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:40,090
that said Miami had some
of the finest Cuban restaurants

147
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:42,760
in the entire world.

148
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,640
Since Fritos
were his favorite food

149
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,060
and corn chips
as close to Cuban cuisine

150
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,770
as Puggy had ever eaten,

151
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:53,400
he decided to hop a fishing boat
and check it out.

152
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,730
Puggy could not have been
happier.

153
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:59,320
After only 20 minutes in Miami,
Puggy was already thinking

154
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,950
that this had to be the warmest,
friendliest place on Earth.

155
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,240
You stink.

156
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,620
Beer and a bag of Fritos.

157
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,090
She ran track for 10 years.

158
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,670
She definitely has the legs...

159
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,640
Out.

160
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,310
I teII you once before,
you two, out!

161
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,680
Look, man, we got money,

162
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,940
and we'll take however
this much here will get us.

163
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,030
Ass-wipe.

164
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,280
Snake Dupree
and Eddie Leadbetter

165
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,530
had met two years earlier

166
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,660
at the state prison
just outside Louisville.

167
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,450
They hit it off immediately,
having similar tastes in humor.

168
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,950
Ass-wipe.

169
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,540
You know,

170
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,040
I don't know how long she's been
into strength conditioning.

171
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,340
But she's been into conditioning
for a long time

172
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,670
because she ran track for 10.

173
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,220
Listen to
the crowd. They are so into it.

174
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,390
Hey.

175
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,190
Hmm?

176
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,900
Is there a problem,
chief?

177
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,730
Give me that back.

178
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,650
Uh!

179
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,030
Ugh!

180
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,990
Sh--

181
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,210
Oh.

182
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,380
Ohh!

183
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,170
Look, man,
this ain't your problem.

184
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,880
You are problem.

185
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,090
Out.

186
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,680
He broke my ankle.

187
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,390
- I break your head.
- I'm going.

188
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,520
Next time
I see you again...

189
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,600
you're dead.

190
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,600
Out!

191
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,230
Out.

192
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,530
You can stay.

193
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,400
They took all my money.

194
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,440
It's okay.

195
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,780
Free beer.

196
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,240
Aluminum, huh?

197
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,580
We sponsor
girls' softball team.

198
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,960
You want to make $5?

199
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,750
That too.

200
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,470
Is not for us.

201
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,640
Package deal --
suitcase or nothing.

202
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:46,280
Lay it down gentle
so as not to fall.

203
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,790
Strong.

204
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,200
Come back tomorrow 1:00.

205
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,160
Maybe I have more job
for you.

206
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,700
After only one day in Miami,

207
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,620
Puggy had
a more satisfying career

208
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,620
and lived in a better
neighborhood than "I" did.

209
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,890
Sound system sucks.

210
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,690
Why'd your dad buy a Geo?

211
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,520
He thinks he's a loser,
so he bought a loser car.

212
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,770
Besides, he's a dork.

213
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,370
Super Soaker 600 holds
a gallon of water,

214
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,910
accurate up to 50 feet.

215
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,540
So, what's the plan --
through the front?

216
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,040
Yeah.
"It's Matt Arnold.

217
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,960
I'm here to kill
your daughter, Jenny."

218
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,960
No, we gotta go over
the wall, dickweed.

219
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,710
I just hope she doesn't see
this stupid turdmobile.

220
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,880
Spread it out on your bed...

221
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,340
Where's Arthur?

222
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,390
I haven't seen him
since his third scotch.

223
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:39,930
...These corners
are in the inside corners.

224
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,140
And there.

225
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,850
A rather clumsy task is
accomplished in no time.

226
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,270
It's a good thing.

227
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,730
Talk to me, Martha.

228
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,110
-- Good night, Nina.

229
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,150
-- I was
wondering if you'd Iike a drink.

230
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,950
Something with tequila?

231
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,950
Arthur Herk --
one of the few Floridians

232
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,580
who was "not" confused
when he voted for Pat Buchanan.

233
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,410
No, thank you, Mr. Herk.

234
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,040
I'm very tired tonight.

235
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,380
Of course you are,
because you work so hard,

236
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,210
you're on your feet
all day.

237
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,340
A woman's feet
are very important.

238
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,090
Let's have
a foot massage.

239
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:15,220
But, Mr. Herk,
Mrs. Anna --

240
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,140
Oh, it's okay.
She's watching television.

241
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,140
And I'm not gonna tell her
that I was here,

242
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,310
and you're not
going to tell her either,

243
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,390
are you, Nina?

244
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,600
Oh.

245
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,480
Your strong,
sturdy ankles,

246
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,980
your proud peasant arches.

247
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,610
Nina...

248
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:38,620
let me clean your toes
with my tongue.

249
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,460
Ahhh.

250
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,170
Mmmm.

251
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,300
Grr.

252
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,170
Unh-unh.

253
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,180
Hu-hu-hu-hu.

254
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,350
Ohh!

255
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,440
Nina!

256
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,770
Nina!

257
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,480
Nina!

258
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,320
Nina! Nina...

259
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,530
Come out of there.
This is my house.

260
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,320
You work for me, and I
want to suck your toes.

261
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,670
Hope they don't have
a dog.

262
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:33,210
As it happens,
the Herks "did" have a dog.

263
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,510
His name was Roger,
and he was the random result

264
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:38,510
of generations
of hasty, unplanned dog sex.

265
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:47,310
For the past three months,
Roger had eaten nothing but dirt.

266
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:50,190
That was when the most evil
being in the universe

267
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,310
entered his life.

268
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,580
Under the influence of the
toad's hallucinogenic chemicals,

269
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,500
Roger thought his furry butt
was a 24-ounce porterhouse.

270
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,420
...Nice cut of meat.

271
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:17,050
And notice how it is nice and
thick all along up till about here,

272
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,340
and then it kind of tapers off.

273
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,380
She looks like
she has nice feet.

274
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,560
What are you watching her
cook for, anyway?

275
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,810
All you know how to make
are reservations.

276
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:31,100
Good one, Arthur.

277
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,190
What?

278
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,900
Leave her alone.

279
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,900
Whoa-ho!

280
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,070
I'm gonna see what else
is on.

281
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,080
They have a dog.

282
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,390
Hope they don't have a dog.

283
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,270
They have a dog.

284
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,230
Come on. Get outta here,
you mangy...

285
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,570
That's our guy.

286
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,950
Kill him now, we make
the 11:40 back to Newark.

287
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,620
I can't. He's too close
to the women.

288
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,120
Yeah, you don't
shoot him soon,

289
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,660
I'm dead
from these mosquitoes.

290
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,290
Look at this thing.
He's the size of a Buick.

291
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,840
- She.
- She what?

292
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,960
The mosquito is a she.

293
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,630
How the hell
can you tell that?

294
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,010
Discovery Channel.

295
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:43,930
Only the female mosquito
sucks your blood.

296
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:46,140
Sounds like my ex-wife.

297
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,510
Bitch.

298
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,430
Ha ha.

299
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,140
I'm going to my room
where it's not so --

300
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,310
I don't know -- stupid.

301
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,860
Good night, mom.

302
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,110
Aw, good night, honey.

303
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,400
I think I'll let Roger in
and go to bed, too.

304
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,110
Here we go.

305
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,120
Here we go.

306
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,490
Roger!

307
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,790
I'll witness from here
in case her dad shoots us.

308
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,330
With what,
the remote control?

309
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:15,210
This is Miami.
He has a gun.

310
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,460
We got an interloper.

311
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,500
Not a problem.

312
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,550
Good night.

313
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,010
Hey, Jenny!

314
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,170
- Aaahhh!
- Ohh!

315
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,880
Aaahhh!

316
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:27,180
You son of a bitch!

317
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,010
You leave her alone!

318
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,850
Aaaah!

319
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:33,850
Nina!

320
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,560
- Aahhh!
- Wuh!

321
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,230
Whuuhh!

322
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,660
Shit.

323
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:00,710
Uh!

324
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,300
- Ah.
- Ugh!

325
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,630
Leonard?

326
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,670
Leonard?

327
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,680
Uh. Oh.

328
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,600
I don't want any trouble.

329
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,680
Me neither.

330
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:18,440
It was a gift
from the wife.

331
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:23,400
You don't want to be holding
that when the police get here.

332
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,580
Up.

333
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,960
Uhh!

334
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,290
I'll go around back.

335
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,750
Got it.

336
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,420
You son of a bitch!

337
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,220
Freeze!
Everybody, hold it!

338
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,260
Son of a bitch!

339
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,800
Hey, hey, hey!

340
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,060
Stop it!

341
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,890
Slowly.

342
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,440
Freeze!

343
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,400
It's aII right, WaIter.

344
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,320
What happened?

345
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,110
- This person tried
to kill us. -- No.

346
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,570
No. It's me. It's Matt Arnold
. I'm in her Biology class.

347
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,490
It was a squirt gun.

348
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,490
It's a squirt gun.

349
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:13,780
Oh, shit.

350
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,450
We have this game
at school -- "Killer."

351
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,910
You get somebody's name, and
you're supposed to squirt them.

352
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,290
In their house at night?
What kind of a game is that?

353
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,130
It's about time
you putzes got here.

354
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,000
- And your name is?
- This is my house.

355
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,250
Good for you.
Your name is?

356
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,510
Arthur Herk.
I know the mayor.

357
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,340
What took you people
so goddamn long?

358
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,600
We came as soon
as we got the call, sir.

359
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,760
My TV.

360
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,810
He broke my TV.

361
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,810
You son of a bitch!

362
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:40,020
I'm gonna make you pay for that,
"and" you're gonna go to jail!

363
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,350
- It was a squirt
gun, sir. -- What?!

364
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,850
Squirt -- squirt gun.

365
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,310
It's a good thing
you ran away, Arthur.

366
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,860
You might have gotten wet.

367
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,860
Shut up!

368
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,150
Easy.

369
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,990
Don't tell me easy!
This is my goddamn house!

370
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,200
And these are my handcuffs,
and if you don't take it easy,

371
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,080
you'll be wearing my handcuffs
in your goddamn house.

372
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,200
That's right, sir.

373
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:58,950
Okay.

374
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,920
One at a time, starting
with Mr. Killer over here.

375
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,000
What happened?

376
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,290
Me and Andrew were outside.

377
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,340
- "Andrew and I."
- Thank you.

378
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,800
Who's Andrew?

379
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,380
Nobody.

380
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,010
Andrew's nobody.

381
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,180
So you were outside

382
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,470
with a squirt gun
and an imaginary friend?

383
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,350
Yeah.

384
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,390
Okay. So you and your
imaginary friend are outside.

385
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,020
Then what happens?

386
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,850
Officer Kramitz, would you
please go see who that is?

387
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,600
You'll be okay?

388
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,520
Coming!

389
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,150
Uh, Jenny's mom
opened the door,

390
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:31,240
and I came running up
to squirt her.

391
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,570
And then, uh,
Mrs. Herk jumped me --

392
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:35,700
or jumped "on" me.

393
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,160
And, uh, and then
I went down on Jenny --

394
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,200
or I f-feII on Jenny.

395
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,410
This guy says
that his son is here.

396
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,420
I'm Eliot Arnold.

397
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,500
I got a call from Andrew.
You all right, Matt?

398
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,750
Yeah.

399
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,340
Andrew
the imaginary friend?

400
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,720
Yeah, well,
you better have a good lawyer,

401
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,890
because your dumb-ass son
broke my TV.

402
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:57,430
That's an RCA
39-inch horizontal!

403
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,560
35-inch diagonal.

404
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,770
Could somebody just tell me
what happened?

405
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,440
I was trying to sh--
squirt Jenny,

406
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,310
and her mom jumped me.

407
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,520
Jesus, Matt.

408
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,900
Look, I'm sorry

409
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,860
that my kid squirted
your daughter.

410
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,940
I-I mean, I'm -- that he
- that he got her wet.

411
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,610
I mean,
the way he described it,

412
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:15,860
I thought
it was just a game.

413
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,410
Hey, kids -- you know.

414
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:20,700
Yeah? Well, your jerk-off kid
is going to jail.

415
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,580
Monica,
take a look at this.

416
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,750
Who shot the TV?

417
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,880
Shot it?
Nobody shot it.

418
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,300
Well, this is a bullet.

419
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,880
Wait a minute.

420
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,300
Matt, when you and your
imaginary friend were outside,

421
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,930
- did you see anyone else?
- No.

422
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,550
Mrs. Herk, do you live here
with anyone

423
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,850
besides your husband
and your daughter?

424
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:40,890
Well, there's...

425
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,060
Where's Nina?

426
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,570
Jesus.

427
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:58,410
Puggy.

428
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:59,950
Nina?!

429
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,740
My God,
the woman of the house.

430
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:02,950
I have to go.

431
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,580
Nina? That's you?

432
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,250
What's your name?

433
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:11,500
Puggy.

434
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,920
Nina!

435
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,590
I don't think they know
I live here.

436
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,890
I won't tell.

437
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,450
There was another shooter.

438
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:42,580
What do you mean?

439
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,620
What do I mean?

440
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,200
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

441
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,830
I mean there was another
shooter, is what I mean.

442
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:49,500
So, did you take care
of the job or not?

443
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,830
Not.

444
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,920
Well, did the other shooter
take care of it?

445
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,130
Hold on a second.

446
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,680
Not right now, okay?

447
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,720
It's cool, man.

448
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,890
Hello?!

449
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,470
Yeah, I'm here.

450
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,350
We want this job finished
as soon as possible.

451
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,390
You got that right.

452
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,690
I'll tell you who did it.

453
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,150
It's probably
some goddamn kids.

454
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:13,190
'Cause these goddamn kids
today --

455
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:17,190
they all got goddamn guns,
and they're all sniffing glue!

456
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,110
Any additional insights,
Mr. Herk?

457
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,530
Any information can
help us to protect you.

458
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:24,660
I seriously doubt that you or any other
member of the police force in this town

459
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,040
could protect their own dicks
with both hands.

460
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,210
Thank you
for that observation.

461
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,040
I'm not gonna
arrest you, Matt,

462
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,210
unless Mrs. Herk
wants to press charges.

463
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,000
Hey -- kids.

464
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:37,510
"I" want to press charges!
Cuff him!

465
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,420
My hands are kind of full
right now,

466
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,430
what with holding my dick
and all.

467
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,390
This "Killer" thing's
really stupid, Matt.

468
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:44,800
Yes, ma'am.

469
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:50,270
Good -- now you
and your shithead kid

470
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:53,060
can get the hell out of here
and never come back.

471
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,980
Thanks for everything.

472
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,650
I'll walk you out.

473
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,860
Go get the Geo,
will you, Matt?

474
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:02,990
You have a Geo?

475
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,910
A Metro, the LDl coupe,
or the hatchback?

476
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:08,750
My biological father
sells them in Tulsa.

477
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:11,960
If the salesman tried to pitch you on
free undercoating, it's total bullshit.

478
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,830
They fall apart
before they rust.

479
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,550
60 %%% of the parts are made from
recycled plastic soda bottles.

480
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,840
It's true.

481
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,800
Listen, I'm sorry
my husband's such an idiot.

482
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,180
He's probably really upset
because someone shot his TV.

483
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,470
No, he's an idiot.

484
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,600
Do you think someone's
trying to kill him?

485
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,930
God, I hope so.

486
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:30,140
What does a guy Iike Arthur
do for a Iiving?

487
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,140
He's an executive
at Penultra Corporation.

488
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:34,190
I did
an article on them once.

489
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:37,070
They built the jail downtown
where the plumbing doesn't work.

490
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,730
I called it
"Crapital Punishment."

491
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:41,240
Eliot Arnold
"from" The Herald?

492
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,700
I used to read your column.

493
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,780
You were so funny.
What happened?

494
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,780
I lost my sense of humor
in the divorce.

495
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,910
How does a guy like Arthur

496
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:52,290
end up
with someone like you?

497
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:54,170
I married him
when Jenny was little.

498
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:56,170
My first husband
left us kind of early,

499
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,630
and we had to move to this
crappy little apartment.

500
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:01,010
And I met Arthur.
He was different then.

501
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:03,010
I keep looking up divorce
lawyers in the phone book,

502
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,800
but then I think about
that horrible apartment.

503
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,800
It's unavailable.
"I" live there.

504
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,810
Can I borrow this?

505
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,350
I'm totally into
The Seminal Fluids.

506
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,150
Arthur threw mine out
at the carwash.

507
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,480
He doesn't think it's music

508
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,570
unless somebody's
playing an accordion.

509
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:21,110
I'll drive.

510
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,790
I say we blame
the whole evening

511
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:38,670
on rap music and too much
violence on television.

512
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:41,170
You could yell at me if it'd
make you feel more dad-like.

513
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:42,550
I don't want
to yeII at you.

514
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,920
Why don't we talk?

515
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:46,180
You and I --
let's just talk.

516
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,430
Come on.

517
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:49,140
Okay. Mom wanted me
to remind you

518
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,520
that the alimony check
is due Monday.

519
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,520
See?

520
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,890
That wasn't so hard.

521
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,140
Look, Matt --

522
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:57,190
Dad, I messed up tonight.
Everybody messes up.

523
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:59,310
You know that
better than anybody.

524
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,860
So all I'm saying is

525
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,570
I don't think I need
any fatherIy advice from you

526
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:04,070
about how to live my life

527
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,660
when you're not doing
such a hot job living "yours."

528
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:13,750
Hey, we're talking.

529
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:16,330
Okay.
Now it's my turn.

530
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,040
Up yours,
you little shithead.

531
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,420
Your turn.

532
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:31,970
Puggy.

533
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,100
I bring you some lunch.

534
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:50,700
Listen... I love you.

535
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,130
You see?
You see the difference?

536
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,800
You ask a guy
what he wants --

537
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,300
tits or an ugly fish --
see what he tells you.

538
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:11,430
- Probably... --
Tits! I gotta boogie.

539
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:13,390
Hey, she should
be leaning over

540
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:15,140
for maximum exposure.

541
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,430
Maximum exposure...

542
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,150
Maximum exposure?

543
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,980
That's advertising
terminology.

544
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,150
Oh, I see.

545
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,860
To what do I owe
this pleasure?

546
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,490
Uh, did you happen to lose

547
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:29,910
a pair of reading glasses
last night?

548
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,490
I don't wear glasses.

549
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,990
Oh, well, then, I guess I
made the trip for nothing.

550
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:36,750
Nonsense. I'll need them one
day -- not right this minute.

551
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,460
Well, things change.
I'll need them.

552
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,290
Um, hey, could I offer you
some coffee?

553
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,710
That would be wonderful.

554
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,340
It's more of a dare
than an offer, actuaIIy.

555
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,420
Did the police
find anything?

556
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,420
Well,
after meeting Arthur,

557
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,510
they figure
I'm the primary suspect.

558
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,850
So...

559
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:56,520
How do you, uh...
like it?

560
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,140
Oh, light and... sweet.

561
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,940
Mmm.

562
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,650
Mmm.

563
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:06,860
Oh.

564
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,360
Mmm.

565
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,700
Mmm!

566
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,370
Uh. Mm. Oh!

567
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,840
I forgot my jacket.

568
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,010
Got room for a third?

569
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:39,180
No harm in asking.

570
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,520
Mm.

571
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,980
I hope
I didn't hurt you.

572
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,860
No, no, that's --

573
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,440
Didn't know I was, um --
well, we should go.

574
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,650
Let's -- let's, uh...

575
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:52,240
Yeah.
It's probably a good idea.

576
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,780
You should go.

577
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,490
Mmm.

578
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:58,950
Later that day,

579
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:02,370
Arthur Herk stopped by to have
a friendly chat with his boss.

580
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,880
Morning, douche bag.

581
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,040
Arthur?

582
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,880
Jesus. What happened
to your hair?

583
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,880
It's a wig, you moron.
Don't act stupid.

584
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,550
I know you know
what's going on.

585
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:15,090
Those dickwads upstairs
are trying to have me whacked!

586
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:17,180
Hey, hey, first of all, those
decisions are made way over my head.

587
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,680
And secondly, you stole money
from them, Arthur!

588
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,720
What do you expect them
to do?!

589
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,810
Look, bitch, you take that express
elevator upstairs to the top floor,

590
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:26,860
and you tell those sugar-cane-sucking
scumbags to lay off,

591
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,400
or I'm gonna blow the lid
on this whole operation!

592
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,070
You're putting me
in a very awkward position.

593
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,740
No, no, no.
No, no, no. No. No.

594
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,160
An awkward position
is what "you're" going to be in

595
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,870
when the FBl is shining a
proctoscope up your big, fat ass!

596
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:45,000
I have evidence,
and I'll use it!

597
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,580
He didn't have evidence,

598
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:48,420
but he knew
where he could get some.

599
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,090
And that made Arthur Herk
a very dangerous man.

600
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:52,920
Arthur may not have been
a genius,

601
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,880
but he did know that the bullet
that went through X ena's head

602
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:58,140
was meant for "his."

603
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,640
Penultra Construction had arranged
for the hit when they discovered

604
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,350
Arthur had been skimming money
from the company.

605
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:07,600
Up until yesterday, Arthur Herk
had been their bagman.

606
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,770
Gentlemen...
we have a problem.

607
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,610
Can I get personal?

608
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:14,690
Oh, "now" you're asking?

609
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,320
Your daughter
really likes you.

610
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,410
Yeah. We have
a pretty good relationship.

611
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:21,660
The divorce, Arthur -- she doesn't
throw any of that in your face?

612
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,200
Oh, I told Jenny a long time
ago that I wasn't perfect.

613
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,750
She tried
to accept my mistakes,

614
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,960
and I try to accept hers.

615
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,170
Sounds simple.

616
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,840
Well, I mean,
it wasn't that simple

617
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,550
when she came home with a
scorpion tattooed on her butt.

618
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,880
Matt hates me.

619
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,760
He basically thinks
I'm a loser.

620
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,100
He "called" me a loser,
so I called him a shithead.

621
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,430
If we had bad teeth, we
could go on "Jerry Springer."

622
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,810
So, what you're telling me
is that her mom beat you up?

623
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,520
Well, she's
in pretty good shape, man.

624
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,730
I mean, she couId snap you
Iike a toothpick.

625
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:51,730
Hey.

626
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:52,770
Hi.

627
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,320
You --
don't stare at my boobs.

628
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,240
So, did they give you points
for the kill?

629
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,360
No, they said
it didn't count.

630
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:00,620
Well, I know this won't end
till it ends,

631
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,490
so I'd like to get this
over with.

632
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,370
You can squirt me tonight
over at Bayside.

633
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,410
I'll be outside The Gap
at around 8:00, okay?

634
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,910
Okay.

635
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,880
And you -- don't look
at my ass when I walk away.

636
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,250
I can't make
that promise.

637
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:14,920
Whoa.

638
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,840
"You can squirt me tonight
down at Bayside."

639
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,550
You're gonna remember that line
when you're an old dude, dude.

640
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,850
- You looking at her ass?
- Yeah.

641
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,770
There's some things
I'd like to know.

642
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:28,940
For instance, who's the guy
running around with the rifle?

643
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:32,360
And who in the hell is the guy
jumping on me from out of a tree?

644
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,440
What guy in a tree?

645
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,730
That's what "I'm" wondering.

646
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:36,190
Look, you brought us
down here

647
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,820
to do a simple job --
in, out, bing, bang.

648
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,990
All of a sudden, I got
Geronimo running into the house

649
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,950
and Tarzan landing
on my coconut.

650
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,990
Your primary concern
is to finish this job

651
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,200
before a certain party
shoots his mouth off.

652
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,750
Excuse me.

653
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:52,210
Nice.

654
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,960
Gentlemen, would you mind
putting out your cigars, please?

655
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:58,510
- Come again?
- I asked...

656
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:00,760
Would you mind putting
out your cigars, please?

657
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,640
As a matter of fact,
I would mind.

658
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,060
Well, you see, the reason
I ask -- all due respect --

659
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,220
I got a great New York strip
sitting over there,

660
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:09,230
cost me $27 and change,

661
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,940
and it tastes like
I'm eating a cigar.

662
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,940
Listen, ace, number one,
you're eating a steak

663
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,520
at a place
called Joe's Stone Crab.

664
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,980
And number two,

665
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,240
there's no rule that says
we can't smoke.

666
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,280
Well, number one,
my name is not Ace.

667
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,070
And number two, I'm not
talking about rules here.

668
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,240
I'm taIking about manners.

669
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,330
You see, there is no ruIe

670
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:27,580
that says
I can't come over here

671
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,160
and fart on your entree,

672
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,460
but I don't do it.

673
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,870
Why? Because
it's not good manners.

674
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,750
So I ask you again
in the nicest possible way

675
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:38,170
to please put out
the cigars, okay?

676
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,640
Aahhh!

677
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,220
Thank you.

678
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:50,060
I hope you realize you've
just committed assault.

679
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,230
I know, I know --
you know, I remember a time

680
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:54,150
was you actually
had to hit somebody.

681
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,730
You go tell your employer

682
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:00,940
it's gonna cost him
another 10 G's apiece.

683
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,150
Okay.

684
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,860
But we want this finished
as soon as possible.

685
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,700
Well, believe me,
we don't want to spend

686
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,910
any more time in this
garden spot than we have to.

687
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:10,000
Got that right.

688
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,210
Whoa.
Look at those wheels.

689
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,460
Douche bag's probably
some kind of drug kingpin.

690
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,670
Bet he's got a helicopter
and a big-ass boat

691
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:20,010
and a pad down in the Bahamas
like a tax shelter.

692
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:23,180
Stayed in one of them shelters
once. Didn't like it much.

693
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,470
I'm tired of Iiving
foot to mouth.

694
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,890
Let's go to The Jackal.

695
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,890
There's something
I want to do.

696
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:31,060
I don't want to mess
with that bartender

697
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,980
and his baseball bat.

698
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,990
Man on television:... In
the lightweight division.

699
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,290
Heather is from Woodland Hills,
California.

700
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:53,710
What do you see right away?

701
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,500
Man

702
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,830
She's got
good muscularity.

703
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:59,340
She's going through
a routine right now.

704
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,630
Hello, Mr. Herk.

705
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:05,550
Something to drink?

706
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:09,350
I need a missile.

707
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:12,680
This for you?
This is personal missile?

708
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,140
What the flying shit
do you care?

709
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:16,850
Usually you drop money,

710
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:18,190
somebody else
pick up equipment.

711
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,520
What, are you keeping
a diary?

712
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,190
You got a goddamn missile
or not?

713
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,240
Right now,
do not have missile.

714
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,030
Missile wery hard to get.

715
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,570
Well, I want you to try

716
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:29,070
"wery" goddamn hard
to get a missile.

717
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,450
You got me, comrade?

718
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:32,370
You pay?

719
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,380
$10,000.

720
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,550
Maybe I have item
for you.

721
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,760
What the hell is that?

722
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,010
Bomb.

723
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,430
Looks like
a garbage disposal.

724
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:56,350
Is big bomb.
Take a look.

725
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,070
Okay.

726
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,950
I'm not Iong
for this pIace.

727
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:10,240
My brother's working security
at the airport.

728
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,450
Big time.

729
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:14,620
Oh, yeah.
Check "this" out.

730
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,910
Well, we're not
supposed to carry guns.

731
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,750
Well, we're not supposed
to drink on the job either.

732
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:25,130
All right. Let's reconnoiter
back here at 2100 hours.

733
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:29,340
10:00.

734
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,940
Just one brave
Gator fan to call.

735
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:49,110
Where are the Gator fans now?

736
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,610
All you Gator fans call
when you win.

737
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:53,200
But now that you lose, you don't
have the guts to call in.

738
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,200
I'm waiting for one,
just one...

739
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,750
What the hell are Gators?

740
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,000
Football -- college.

741
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,580
- Morons.
- Mm-hmm.

742
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:02,080
Man

743
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:03,630
And what do you
have to say?

744
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,880
Well, you said we don't
have the guts to call,

745
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,460
and I'm calling.

746
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:10,510
That's it? You're calling
to say you're calling?

747
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,430
This town gives me
a headache.

748
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:15,310
Why do you think he'd
come here, a guy like that?

749
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:17,520
Good job, nice house,
plenty of cheese.

750
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,690
What -- what's he doing
in a shithole like this?

751
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:22,060
Maybe it's Happy Hour.

752
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,230
I might as well have a bucket
over my head.

753
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:27,400
Keep walking. Don't do
nothing stupid in there.

754
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,570
As far as I'm concerned,
this whole idea is stupid.

755
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:33,030
I think we got Gator fans.

756
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:35,490
Is that a squirt gun
in your pocket,

757
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:37,660
or were you happy
to see me?

758
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,580
So, where are we
gonna do this?

759
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,840
We don't want to make
a scene, like last time.

760
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,630
Well, there's a parking lot
behind the drugstore.

761
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,210
Sounds like a good place
to die.

762
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:51,510
Maybe you could buy me
some lip gloss afterwards.

763
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,720
Are you staring
at her ass?

764
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,510
You're "not?"

765
00:35:57,850 --> 00:35:59,180
Whip out your pistol,
cowboy.

766
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,680
Where do you want me
to shoot you?

767
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,690
Why don't you shoot her
in the crotch?

768
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:03,770
You could be like a couple.

769
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:05,360
This is a friend of yours?

770
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,400
How about I just shoot you
on your hand?

771
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,030
My first hand job.

772
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,780
Freeze!

773
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,120
Aaah!

774
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,780
- Move, move, move!
- Who's shooting?

775
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,290
Andrew, come on!

776
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:19,700
Come on, Andrew!

777
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,410
Uhh!

778
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:22,580
Holy shit.
Oh, shit.

779
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,670
Holy shit.

780
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,880
Aah!

781
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:35,180
At that very moment,
Officers Romero and Kramitz

782
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,390
were headed westbound
on Biscayne Boulevard.

783
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,720
Three months earlier,

784
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,140
they had been involved
in a scuffle with a crack dealer

785
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,810
at the very intersection
they were now passing through.

786
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:48,570
Romero's shirt had been torn
open in the altercation,

787
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,110
revealing a red bustier

788
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:53,110
from the Victoria's Secret's
"Desire" collection.

789
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:56,110
Kramitz had never gotten it out
of his mind.

790
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,290
So, I was thinking maybe you and
me could get together sometime.

791
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:06,420
Walter, do you want
to have sex with me?

792
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,460
Walter couldn't believe it.

793
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,170
Had he somehow found
the wormhole in the universe

794
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:13,420
that guys have been seeking
for eons --

795
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,380
the wormhole
that would allow him

796
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:18,260
to bypass all the talking
and talking and talking

797
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,640
and just do it?

798
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,180
Walter thought hard

799
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,600
about how he would phrase his
response to Monica's question.

800
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,980
Yeah.

801
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,650
Well, I don't want
to have sex with you.

802
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:27,650
You're a married man.

803
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:29,860
Yeah, but not happily.

804
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,480
Man with a gun.

805
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:33,530
Police! Put the gun down
right now!

806
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,320
It's not my gun.
Some guy --

807
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,490
Put down the gun!

808
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:43,370
I'm a very good student.

809
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:44,960
- Shut up, punk.
- Officer Kramitz,

810
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,290
he Iooks about as menacing
as a Backstreet Boy.

811
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:49,080
Can I taIk to him
for a second?

812
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:51,090
What's your name?

813
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:52,460
Andrew Ryan.

814
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,210
Andrew Ryan, what are you
doing with a gun?

815
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:57,050
Some weird guy
was shooting at us.

816
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:59,010
He dropped it,
and I picked it up and ran.

817
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,050
Who's "us"?

818
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,310
My friends --
Matt and Jenny.

819
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,850
Police! Police!

820
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,890
That's correct.
We are the police.

821
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:07,890
Jack Pendick,
Big Sky Security.

822
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,650
There was a girl
in the parking lot,

823
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:11,570
and they were gonna shoot her
with a gun.

824
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:14,150
Hmm. Let me guess --
a squirt gun, right?

825
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,490
Yeah.

826
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:19,160
Mr. Pendick, does this
firearm belong to you?

827
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,490
Yes.

828
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:22,120
No.

829
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,290
Have you been drinking
tonight, Mr. Pendick?

830
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:26,910
Absolutely not.

831
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,750
Go get him, Walter.

832
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,880
Stick 'em up.

833
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,390
Remember me?

834
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,730
No.

835
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:51,810
Ugh!

836
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:54,020
I ain't done
with you yet.

837
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,280
Open the cash register.

838
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,200
Reach for that baseball bat,
and I blow your head off.

839
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,290
Okay, Eddie, go get it.

840
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,470
...A little bit too much.

841
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:24,220
The choreography is starting
to lag. There you go.

842
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,140
Get the big bills first.

843
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,690
Which big bills?

844
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:32,770
This one
or the other one?

845
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:34,650
- Where's the money?
- I have money.

846
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,320
$18?!

847
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:45,370
What kind of bar is this?

848
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:46,660
Business very bad.

849
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,080
Is bad location.

850
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,410
Snake, check it out. It's
the kingpin with the Fag Jag.

851
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:53,750
You -- give me your watch.

852
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,430
Oh... nice.

853
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:06,220
All right.
Now give me your wallet.

854
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,280
What's in there?

855
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,360
A bomb.

856
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:25,780
- Right.
- No, it's a bomb.

857
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,620
These guys are Russians,
and they sell bombs.

858
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,950
- Bombs? No bombs.
Is bar. -- Is bar.

859
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:33,000
Hey, Eddie
open the suitcase.

860
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,630
What if it "is" a bomb?

861
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:40,010
Well, then you'll get blown
up, and nobody will miss you.

862
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:41,010
Open it.

863
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:48,470
Looks like
a garbage disposal.

864
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:50,310
Nah, it's a time-lock
safe thing.

865
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:52,140
Probably got drugs
or emeralds in it.

866
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,400
Snake, let's get
the hell out of here.

867
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,560
I think I hear one of them
silent alarms.

868
00:40:57,610 --> 00:41:00,070
Are your wheels outside?
Give me the keys.

869
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,370
All right,
latch up the suitcase.

870
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:10,290
We're going for a ride.
Kingpin's coming with us.

871
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:12,120
No, no, no, you don't want me.
You don't want me.

872
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,790
You want these guys.
These guys are Russians.

873
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:16,500
- They have missiles.
There's -- -- Shut up, asshole!

874
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,960
Snake, I think we done
pretty good.

875
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,290
Why don't
we just call it a day?

876
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,670
We got an opportunity here,
Eddie.

877
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,170
Now, maybe you don't see it,
but I do.

878
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:24,130
And that's why I'm me,
and you're you.

879
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:26,340
This guy's probably got lots
of cool shit back at his place.

880
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,350
So that's where we're going,
and we're taking this with us.

881
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:32,350
I bet it's pure
14-karat gold in there.

882
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:36,390
It's heavy.

883
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,060
Pick it up.

884
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,570
You...

885
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:44,650
Get back around here
with your friend.

886
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:54,040
That'll teach you to hit
people with baseball bats.

887
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,660
Sit down!

888
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:01,040
If you asshoIes try to caII
the cops after we Ieave,

889
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:04,420
the next bullet
goes through your head.

890
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,550
Let's go!

891
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:08,720
Kingpin!

892
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:14,350
...Gator fans.

893
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:16,100
And the Japanese doctor
says,

894
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:18,560
"Lady,
you have Ed Zachary disease."

895
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,560
And the lady goes,

896
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,570
"Oh, no, Ed
Zachary disease. What does it mean?"

897
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:25,190
And the doctor says,

898
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:29,490
"It mean your face look Ed
Zachary like your ass."

899
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:31,030
Get it?

900
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:35,830
"Your -- your face look
"Ed Zachary" like your ass."

901
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,420
Ooh!

902
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,670
Who thinks
this shit up, huh?

903
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:44,590
The point is that all these
Gators ever do is talk trash.

904
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:46,760
Then when they lose, you don't
hear a peep out of them.

905
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,180
Man

906
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,590
So what's your problem?

907
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,680
You said we don't have the
guts to call, and I'm call--

908
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,180
These guys need a hobby.

909
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:57,770
There's our guy.

910
00:42:57,810 --> 00:42:59,810
And I beIieve that's Tarzan.

911
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:02,480
Where do you think they're
going -- our boy's house?

912
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,820
"Ed Zachary."

913
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,200
Officer.

914
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,740
Officer, what's going on?

915
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,870
Well, we had
a little shooting,

916
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:15,240
but we got it under control,
Miss...

917
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:18,120
Weintraub --
Heather Weintraub.

918
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,920
Pretty name.

919
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,750
I want to talk to your two
friends. Any idea where they are?

920
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:27,260
They probably went back
to Jenny's house.

921
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,840
Officer Kramitz!

922
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:34,350
10-4.

923
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:36,640
Well, we gotta take care
of something.

924
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,730
Official business.
Code seven.

925
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:40,980
See you later.

926
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:43,940
Let's move!
Nothing to see here!

927
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,020
Let's go!

928
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:46,820
You ready to roll?

929
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:49,320
Let me drive, okay?

930
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:55,450
The house
where the TV got shot.

931
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:04,960
Didn't we
do this last night?

932
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,960
Mm-hmm.
They're in the living room.

933
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:12,680
Strip poker. Strip poker --
now, "that's" a good game.

934
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,640
"This" is a stupid game.

935
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:18,010
Dad, no offense, but only a moron
would mistake that for a real gun.

936
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:19,520
You could've been killed.

937
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,600
And where's your partner
in crime?

938
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:22,850
- Andrew?
- He ran the other way.

939
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:24,190
Did anybody call the police?

940
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:26,690
I'm making coffee.
Do you want some?

941
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:27,940
I'll call the police.

942
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,200
New TV?

943
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,530
Arthur bought it
this afternoon.

944
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:40,040
God forbid he should miss
"X ena: Warrior Princess."

945
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:05,940
If we don't shoot somebody
soon, I'm gonna forget how.

946
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:07,150
Let's do it.

947
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,820
Well, I suppose you're right.
Technically, it's not an emergency, but --

948
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:13,240
Please hold
and your call will be...

949
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,700
The police
just put me on hold.

950
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:18,200
I, uh, met with
a divorce attorney today.

951
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,240
Jenny?

952
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:25,580
Those kids won't be happy
till they get arrested.

953
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,880
Hi.
We're friends of Arthur's.

954
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,380
Hello.
Hello! Hello!

955
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:37,090
Your call is very important...

956
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:38,680
Everybody shut up!

957
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,600
Unless you wanna get shot
where the sun don't shine.

958
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,350
Don't think I don't know
where that is either!

959
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:44,140
Ugh!

960
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,230
A shot.

961
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:49,770
Maybe the pantyhose gang
beat us to the draw.

962
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:52,070
- Again with the TV.
- Shut up.

963
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:55,650
Take that stupid thing
off your head.

964
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:58,990
Yeah, nice place.

965
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:00,950
What are you,
Martha Stewart?

966
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:03,120
Make yourself useful
and tie everybody up.

967
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,410
With what?

968
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:05,960
- 911 operator.
- This is Eliot Arnold.

969
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:10,130
This.

970
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:16,260
Well, I can only do a slipknot,
a double knot, and a --

971
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:18,300
What do you call it?
The bowman.

972
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:19,930
What do you want?

973
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:23,350
You going for eagle scout?
Tie 'em up.

974
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:38,780
Baptist church
two blocks over.

975
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:41,120
FBl Agent Pat Greer.
Alan Seitz.

976
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:44,120
How can I help FBl?

977
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,540
Well, you can tell FBl
where the suitcase is, lvan.

978
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:49,170
- My name is John.
- Sure it is.

979
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:51,380
Your name is John,
and you're just a hardworking,

980
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:53,250
law-abiding,
small immigrant businessman,

981
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:55,670
running a shithole bar
where you got... no customers.

982
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:57,340
- Bad location.
- Yes, it is.

983
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:59,470
I'd Iike to take a Iook around
the back room right there,

984
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:00,840
the one
with all the locks.

985
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:01,890
You have warrant?

986
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:03,850
Ain't that heartwarming?

987
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:06,810
You know, the way a man can
come here from another country,

988
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:08,850
and in just a short time
here in America,

989
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:10,810
he has embraced our way
of Iiving to the point

990
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:13,360
where he wants to know
if we got a warrant.

991
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:16,530
Don't that just warm the cockles
of your heart, Agent Seitz?

992
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:18,650
It warms the shit
out of my cockles.

993
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,610
My cockles are burning.

994
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:22,660
We don't need a warrant.

995
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,410
You see,
we're operating under --

996
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:27,000
What's that thing called we're
operating under again, Agent Seitz?

997
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,710
Special Executive Order
768-04.

998
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:33,130
That's it -- Special Executive Order
768-04, which basically means that,

999
00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:35,000
if it's a matter
of national security,

1000
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:38,050
we can send a search party and
a Doberman pinscher up your ass.

1001
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:39,550
I want lawyer.

1002
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:40,880
Did you hear that,
Agent Seitz?

1003
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:42,390
He want lawyer.

1004
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:44,430
As is his
right under our Constitution,

1005
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:45,510
which we hold sacred.

1006
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,100
Want me to shoot him
in the forehead?

1007
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:48,680
Yeah, go ahead.

1008
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:50,100
Just playing.
Come here.

1009
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:52,850
My partner wants to shoot you
in the forehead,

1010
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:56,020
which I have absolutely no
doubt that he can legally do

1011
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:58,320
under SpeciaI
Executive Order 768--

1012
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,030
- Dash 04.
- Dash 04.

1013
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:02,070
Now, me, I'm thinking,
wouldn't it be better

1014
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:04,450
if you just reached into
your pocket, got the keys,

1015
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:06,280
and showed me around
that back room --

1016
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:08,620
the one
with all the locks.

1017
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:10,910
- Yes?
- Hi, Mrs. Herk.

1018
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:12,420
Do you mind
if we talk to Jenny

1019
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:14,250
about something that happened
at Bayside tonight?

1020
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:16,250
She's not in trouble, but it's
important that we talk to her.

1021
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:18,760
- Oh, Jenny's not here. -- Do you
mind if we come in for a minute?

1022
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,050
No, no.
I-I mean, yes, I mind.

1023
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:21,930
- I mean --
- Monica.

1024
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:24,430
What do we have here? If it
ain't a Dick and a Dickless Tracy.

1025
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:25,430
You're making
a big mistake.

1026
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:27,970
Story of my life.

1027
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,730
What's happening?

1028
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:32,390
Well, moron number one
is tying up the family.

1029
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,900
So take the shot.

1030
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:35,560
Well, I would, but moron
number two just came back

1031
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:37,110
with a couple
of Miami's finest.

1032
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:39,320
-- Hold
on. Hold it a second.

1033
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:42,240
We have a "Die Hard" situation
developing in the kitchen.

1034
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:44,360
- What? -- There's a
guy there in the kitchen.

1035
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:45,910
A guy?
What -- what's he doing?

1036
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:47,870
Well, my guess is he's either
gonna whack 'em

1037
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:49,910
with a rolling pin
or he's gonna bake 'em a cake.

1038
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:51,580
It could go either way
with this crew.

1039
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:53,580
Holy shit!

1040
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:55,420
Betty Crocker's
got a squirt gun.

1041
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:56,880
Let me Iook.

1042
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,130
Forget about it. This is
better than Pay-Per-View.

1043
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:01,460
There goes the warranty,

1044
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:03,510
and here comes
The Iron Chef.

1045
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:07,640
One wrong move, and you'll
be crapping lead for a week.

1046
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,100
Snake.

1047
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,810
- Who are you?
- You talking to me?

1048
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:14,640
- Uh-huh.
- I'm your worst nightmare.

1049
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:16,350
I want you to lower the gun
and get the hell out of here.

1050
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,940
Otherwise, I bust a cap
and drop this loser.

1051
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:23,280
I ain't going nowhere without
that kingpin's suitcase.

1052
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,320
Take it.

1053
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:43,340
On second thought,
why don't you just waste him?

1054
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:46,130
Better yet,
I'll do it for you.

1055
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:53,180
Moron number two just got
moron number one all wet.

1056
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:55,560
Gimme.
I-I ain't never seen that.

1057
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,480
They got enough stuff back there
to fight a war in North Korea,

1058
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,940
but no suitcase, and lvan
here doesn't seem to know

1059
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:02,480
what suitcase
I'm talking about.

1060
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:04,240
Ivan, I know
what you're thinking.

1061
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:07,070
You're thinking you can use the
suitcase as a bargaining chip.

1062
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:09,030
You tell us where it is,
we go easy on you.

1063
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:10,700
I-I bet that's
what you're thinking.

1064
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:12,370
Isn't it, Ivan?

1065
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:13,830
Oy!

1066
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:15,040
Ugh!

1067
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,830
Don't be a baby, lvan.
It's just your foot.

1068
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:20,380
It's what we at the bureau
call an extremity shot.

1069
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:21,960
Generally,
the victim survives.

1070
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,090
They don't do so good with
what we call a torso shot.

1071
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:27,630
What you think, lvan?

1072
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,260
You want to experience
a torso shot?

1073
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:33,220
I tell you who has suitcase.

1074
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:34,930
I'd get a bolt lock for this.

1075
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:37,520
There's some really bad people
out there.

1076
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,150
We're out of phone cord.
What about him?

1077
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:40,400
He's coming with us.

1078
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,650
- So is she.
- No!

1079
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:43,900
- Where are we going?
- The Bahamas.

1080
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:47,530
I hear they go pretty easy
on kingpins in the Bahamas.

1081
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:49,030
Ugh!

1082
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:50,280
Money.

1083
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:52,740
Excuse me?

1084
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:55,080
There's 5 grand
in my pocket!

1085
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,200
Okay.

1086
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:57,960
Ah.

1087
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,250
Kingpins ain't so tough.

1088
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:01,920
What you driving?

1089
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:05,420
Chevy Caprice with a 354 barrel
and positraction.

1090
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:06,760
Not bad.

1091
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,010
Keys.

1092
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:11,800
I'm not getting
into that Fag Jag again.

1093
00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:13,640
It's built by Ford now.

1094
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:14,720
Okay.

1095
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,560
Let's go.

1096
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:22,690
Eddie.

1097
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:23,730
Yeah?

1098
00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:25,360
Eddie, you drive.

1099
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,900
Britney Spears, in the back.

1100
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:29,490
Eddie...

1101
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:33,620
Let's go.

1102
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:35,620
Moses,
you're flying coach.

1103
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,670
Got enough leg room?

1104
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:49,470
Buckle up, ma'am.

1105
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:53,300
Let's go.

1106
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:55,220
I ain't never drove
one of these before.

1107
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:57,770
It ain't a spaceship, asshole.
Drive.

1108
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,690
The gate.

1109
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:03,270
No shit. Back up slow.
It'll open.

1110
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:13,490
You got the brake on,
asshole.

1111
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:15,450
Don't call me...

1112
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,370
...Asshole!

1113
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:22,790
Mrs. Anna!

1114
00:52:22,830 --> 00:52:24,960
Nina! They took Jenny!

1115
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:28,170
Quick, quick!
Come on.

1116
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:30,840
Here -- grab this.
You don't wanna push -- pull.

1117
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,680
I'm going after them.

1118
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,890
Okay,
I'm going with you!

1119
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:37,350
Yeah, me too.

1120
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:38,680
I love Puggy!

1121
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,100
Hey, wait.

1122
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:41,350
Hey --

1123
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:42,520
Wh--

1124
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,900
Wait for me!
I'm the police!

1125
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:45,610
Monica, you got to
get yourself loose.

1126
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:47,860
Call Dispatch. Tell them to
get somebody out to the airport.

1127
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:50,320
- I'll handle this.
- Walter!

1128
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,490
Oh.

1129
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:53,910
If you remember,
call that number.

1130
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:56,870
Tell a Miss Heather Weintraub
I might be late.

1131
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:58,660
- Walter!
- Walter!

1132
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:04,880
That boy leads an interesting
life, don't he?

1133
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,920
What are you doing'?
He's attached to the cop.

1134
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,670
That copper can't do anything to
us cuffed to that shelving unit.

1135
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:11,920
Even though that shelf is
brass, it's not the cheap stuff.

1136
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:14,630
All the phone lines are cut. We gotta
get outside and yell for the neighbors.

1137
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,550
Help me. -- You can't make me!

1138
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:21,220
Help me or I will crush you
like a goddamn bug.

1139
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:23,520
Just take the shot and let's
get the hell to the airport.

1140
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:26,230
You got it. The Ionger we stay
down here, the weirder it gets.

1141
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:29,070
You got that right --
Weirdsville, USA.

1142
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:31,070
- Damn!
- What the hell are you doing?

1143
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:34,070
On three, we're gonna smash
this thing through the door.

1144
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:35,200
Like shit, we are!

1145
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,620
One, two...

1146
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,700
That's glass, you moron.
You're gonna get us killed!

1147
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:40,540
- ...Three! --
No! No! No, no, no!

1148
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,120
Aaaah!

1149
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:52,090
- Did you get him? -- I
think so. He went down.

1150
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:53,670
- Cop went down, too.
- Goddamn dog.

1151
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:54,840
Weirdsville, USA.

1152
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,800
You got that right.

1153
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:57,510
Get up!

1154
00:53:57,550 --> 00:53:59,350
Ugh! Ugh! It got my face!

1155
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:01,100
It got my face!

1156
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:03,770
We can get some help
if we can get this thing up.

1157
00:54:03,770 --> 00:54:06,310
You okay there, officer?

1158
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:07,520
Who are you?

1159
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:09,980
Pat Greer. Alan Seitz.
Herk?

1160
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:11,320
Yeah, that's Herk.

1161
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,440
Can you uncuff me?

1162
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,570
Not now.
Mr. Herk, I'm with the FBl.

1163
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:16,110
I need to know
where that suitcase is.

1164
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:18,950
Oh, my God,
she's coming to get me!

1165
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:20,620
- The dog, Mr. Herk?
- No, her!

1166
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:21,950
- Who?
- You know!

1167
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:23,790
Her!

1168
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:26,790
Herk! Herk! Herk! Herk!

1169
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:28,380
Oh, my God!
She knows my name!

1170
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:30,840
She knows everything!
She's coming to take my soul!

1171
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,630
Mr. Herk, can you hear me?

1172
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:38,470
Mr. Herk, can you hear me?
This is very important.

1173
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:40,350
I need to know
where that suitcase is.

1174
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:42,430
Oh, God! Please don't let her
take my soul!

1175
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:44,180
Please don't. Please.

1176
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,770
What the hell
is he talking about?

1177
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:46,980
I don't know.

1178
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:48,650
How close did
he get to that toad?

1179
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:49,980
Like face-first.

1180
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:51,520
Bufotenine --
hell of an hallucinogen.

1181
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,320
He's gone. He won't be coming
back any time soon.

1182
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,660
- Discovery Channel.
- Oh, please, don't hurt me!

1183
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:02,370
Listen, we have reason to believe
that Mr. Herk had a suitcase,

1184
00:55:02,410 --> 00:55:03,950
possibly made of metal,
very heavy.

1185
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:05,620
- Have you seen it?
- Yeah, they had it.

1186
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:07,160
- Who's "they"?
- An idiot named Snake.

1187
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:10,130
Him and a possibly even bigger
idiot took the suitcase,

1188
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:12,710
two hostages, and what sounded
like my squad car, so --

1189
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:14,130
- Where did they go?
- You wanna know?

1190
00:55:14,170 --> 00:55:15,840
- Take me with you.
- We don't have time for games.

1191
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,880
This is a very important
federal matter.

1192
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,510
Hey,
if you don't uncuff me,

1193
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:22,350
you can stick your very
important federal matter

1194
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:24,970
right up
your big federaI ass.

1195
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:30,520
Turn right!
Can't you see the sign?

1196
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:51,830
- You sure they said the airport? --
Absolutely. They kept talking about the Bahamas.

1197
00:55:51,830 --> 00:55:53,130
Did anybody open
that suitcase?

1198
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:54,630
Not that I saw.
What's in it?

1199
00:55:54,670 --> 00:55:57,670
The guy we left back there,
the frog kisser --

1200
00:55:57,670 --> 00:55:59,380
Uh, actually, it's a toad.

1201
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:04,350
Anyway, the toad lover's
an illegal weapons trader.

1202
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:06,520
Weapons? That's what's in
the suitcase? You mean guns?

1203
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:10,140
Well, how bad can it be,
right? It's a suitcase.

1204
00:56:10,190 --> 00:56:12,190
We're not talking about
a nuclear bomb, right?

1205
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:15,270
Right?

1206
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:21,360
Okay, we gotta pick a road.

1207
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,570
Arrivals or departures?

1208
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:27,330
We're arriving,
but... then we're departing.

1209
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:30,040
Which one, Snake?

1210
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:31,920
What do "you" think?

1211
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,210
I think you guys
should turn yourselves in

1212
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:36,630
and plead not guilty
by reason of stupidity.

1213
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:39,760
Departures.

1214
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:48,600
It'll be okay.

1215
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:49,890
Dad!

1216
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:59,940
Was that a goat?

1217
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:01,360
Dad!

1218
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,620
- Where did they get
that stuff? -- Russia.

1219
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:09,450
- Don't the Russians have controls on that
kind of thing? -- You'd faint if you knew.

1220
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:11,040
A few months ago,
somebody got a warhead

1221
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,250
out of a missile-dismantlement
facility in a place called --

1222
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:15,710
Sergijev Posad --
not far from Moscow.

1223
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:17,040
Beautiful churches there.

1224
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,420
Travel Channel.

1225
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:24,470
Anyway, somebody who knew what
they were doing modified it.

1226
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:26,720
Dumped it on some guys who run a
place here called The Jolly Jackal.

1227
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:27,930
The bar?

1228
00:57:27,930 --> 00:57:30,560
That bar has more AK-47 s
than Budweiser.

1229
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:33,230
- So can they set it off? --
Best we know, flip three switches,

1230
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:34,770
and you got 45 minutes
to clear out.

1231
00:57:34,810 --> 00:57:36,100
45 minutes.

1232
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:38,570
Man, I guess it was bound
to happen one day.

1233
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:40,440
What makes you think
this is the first time?

1234
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,280
Never mind
which time this is.

1235
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:44,200
The important thing is we got those
assholes trapped at the airport,

1236
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,990
and until we say further,
no plane is taking off.

1237
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:47,780
You can do that?

1238
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:04,380
Okay, let's go.

1239
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:06,220
I'm gonna have this
pointed right at you,

1240
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:07,720
so don't do
something stupid.

1241
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,060
How would you even know
if I did something stupid?

1242
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:12,140
I'll know. Believe me,
I can tell the difference.

1243
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:13,350
Eddie, open the trunk.

1244
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:15,600
If you don't do Iike I say,

1245
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,310
you know what's gonna happen
to you, right?

1246
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:19,520
- You're gonna shoot me?
- You got that right.

1247
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:24,990
Okay, let's go.
Bring the suitcase.

1248
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:32,200
I hope you're not gonna
give me a ticket for this.

1249
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,160
If I don't see them,
I don't write them.

1250
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:38,120
Everything
is very, very wrong.

1251
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:40,670
Don't worry. They'll never make
it through airport security.

1252
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:53,720
We're gonna miss our flight.

1253
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:55,560
You see what the problem is?

1254
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,810
I don't know. There's some
kind of commotion up there.

1255
00:58:57,850 --> 00:59:00,400
There might be something about it
on the radio. --

1256
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:03,480
Not now, not tonight, but
when they play a game and lose,

1257
00:59:03,530 --> 00:59:05,400
I don't hear a peep
from Gator fans.

1258
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,950
Man

1259
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:09,740
I'm saying
that I "am" a Gator fan,

1260
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,450
and I'm calling you now,
okay?

1261
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:13,700
So I don't understand
what the problem is,

1262
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:16,330
or are you just not...

1263
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:32,600
Was that a goat?

1264
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,390
Let's get
the hell out of here.

1265
00:59:38,890 --> 00:59:42,230
Passengers, please go to the exit...

1266
00:59:45,570 --> 00:59:47,400
Hey, Snake.

1267
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,240
Huh?

1268
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:57,040
Smoking is not permitted...

1269
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:04,130
Well, we want to arrive
in the Bahamas,

1270
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:05,880
but... we want to depart.

1271
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,510
This is a joke, right?

1272
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:09,630
Stop making fun of us,
okay?

1273
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:11,590
Let's go.

1274
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,100
Yeah?

1275
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:16,890
We need four tickets
to the Bahamas,

1276
01:00:16,930 --> 01:00:18,430
one-way,
next flight you got.

1277
01:00:18,430 --> 01:00:19,730
Nassau or Freeport?

1278
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:21,440
The Bahamas.

1279
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:24,270
Nassau and Freeport
"are" in the Bahamas.

1280
01:00:24,310 --> 01:00:26,400
Whichever's next.

1281
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:28,990
There's a 10:50 flight
to Freeport.

1282
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:31,950
Four one-way tickets
are gonna run you $360.

1283
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:35,280
Okay,
take it out of there.

1284
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:50,090
Okay, I'm gonna need
the names of the passengers.

1285
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:51,130
John Smith.

1286
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:53,550
And the other passengers,
sir?

1287
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:54,550
John Smith.

1288
01:00:54,590 --> 01:00:56,260
You're all John Smith?

1289
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:58,180
Everybody.

1290
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:01,980
I'll need
some photo I.D., sir.

1291
01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:05,440
There you go.

1292
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:09,230
Okay, then, family Smith.

1293
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:14,490
Have a nice vacation.

1294
01:01:14,530 --> 01:01:17,080
Step through, please.

1295
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:18,450
Come on.

1296
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:20,620
- Unh-unh.
- Computer check.

1297
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:22,160
Computer check!

1298
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,330
Hold it.

1299
01:01:23,330 --> 01:01:24,880
Snake, this ain't
gonna work, man.

1300
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,710
They got X erox machines
up there and shit.

1301
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:28,500
I'm so sick
of your bad attitude.

1302
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:31,380
Just let me do
some thinking, okay?

1303
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:33,340
Bag check.

1304
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:35,140
Step through, please.

1305
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:36,680
Bag check.

1306
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,560
Bag check.

1307
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,390
Computer check.

1308
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:42,560
Computer check.
All right, step through.

1309
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,520
Okay, let's go.

1310
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:50,190
Step through, please.

1311
01:01:52,110 --> 01:01:52,900
Step through, please.

1312
01:01:55,950 --> 01:01:57,030
Bag check.

1313
01:01:57,070 --> 01:01:58,330
Bag check.

1314
01:01:58,370 --> 01:01:59,740
Bag check.

1315
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:02,500
Bag check.

1316
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:04,330
Bag check.

1317
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:06,330
Is this yours?

1318
01:02:06,370 --> 01:02:08,210
It's mine.

1319
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:11,250
Bring it over here
and open it, please.

1320
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:12,710
Do it.

1321
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:15,380
Bag check.

1322
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:17,010
Bag check.

1323
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:22,060
What is this?

1324
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:23,770
- A garbage disposal.
- Bag check.

1325
01:02:23,810 --> 01:02:25,390
- A garbage disposaI?
- Portable.

1326
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,350
- Bag check.
- Bag check.

1327
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,360
You'll have to turn it on.

1328
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:32,900
It's got a timer. Grounds up
your garbage while you're out.

1329
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:34,190
Bag check.

1330
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:35,400
Bag check.

1331
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:39,070
Bag check.

1332
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:40,530
Bag check!

1333
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:42,290
Okay.

1334
01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:43,870
Let's go.

1335
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:50,290
Over there.

1336
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:03,310
They shot my radio!

1337
01:03:03,350 --> 01:03:05,310
Dad, the goat
kicked your Geo's ass.

1338
01:03:05,350 --> 01:03:08,020
The car is
a piece of shit, okay?

1339
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,520
We're gonna get Jenny.

1340
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:21,950
Goddamn goats.

1341
01:03:21,950 --> 01:03:23,990
Boy, does this town
give me spielkas.

1342
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,080
You got that right.

1343
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:45,850
This isn't gonna work.

1344
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:47,020
If you can get up
to that service road,

1345
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:49,810
you can hook over
to Douglas.

1346
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:53,480
Well, see if this guy will let
me squeeze in front of him.

1347
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,480
Excuse me!

1348
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:59,200
Excuse me.

1349
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:01,660
Got a little emergency.
You mind if we get through here?

1350
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:10,500
Look, he's coming
to take our order.

1351
01:04:10,540 --> 01:04:13,000
What do you guys want?

1352
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,760
You ever hear of Special
Executive Order 768-04?

1353
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:18,130
No, what is it?

1354
01:04:19,510 --> 01:04:22,890
It's a powerful
law-enforcement tool.

1355
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:27,180
Ugh! Ohh!

1356
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:32,980
Ohh! Ohh!

1357
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,240
What country are we in?

1358
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,950
All right, Anna,
you come with me.

1359
01:04:46,990 --> 01:04:48,410
Matt,
you take Nina with you.

1360
01:04:48,450 --> 01:04:50,210
You see those idiots,
you come and get me.

1361
01:04:50,210 --> 01:04:51,540
- You got it?
- Okay.

1362
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:54,540
What about me?

1363
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:56,130
Find a cop.

1364
01:04:58,420 --> 01:05:00,220
I need help right now.

1365
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:02,470
There's a hostage situation
here at the airport.

1366
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:04,390
- Where?
- I don't know where.

1367
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:06,850
Well, we can't help you,
can we?

1368
01:05:06,890 --> 01:05:09,930
- You got a twin brother
works at Bayside? -- Maybe.

1369
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:11,390
I need to use your phone.

1370
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:13,440
That's for airport security
personneI and cops onIy.

1371
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,520
I "am" a cop.
Can't you see the uniform?

1372
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:17,230
- Where's your badge?
- It was stolen.

1373
01:05:17,270 --> 01:05:20,440
- Where's your gun, your
flashlight? -- They were stolen, too.

1374
01:05:20,490 --> 01:05:24,530
Look, are you gonna help me, or are
you gonna be a big, fat, stupid asshole?

1375
01:05:24,570 --> 01:05:26,700
Strip search!

1376
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:28,540
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1377
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:31,870
Fly By Air Flight 2038
to lovely Freeport

1378
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:34,420
is now ready
for passenger boarding.

1379
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:36,590
You can get on the plane.

1380
01:05:36,630 --> 01:05:38,800
Right this way.
Thank you.

1381
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:40,590
Thank you.
Have a nice trip.

1382
01:05:40,590 --> 01:05:43,930
Ah, Mr. And Mrs. Kraft,
happy honeymoon.

1383
01:05:43,930 --> 01:05:45,260
Thanks a lot.

1384
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:48,890
Oh, the John Smiths.
I'll check that for you.

1385
01:05:48,930 --> 01:05:50,600
I-I-I-I-It rides with us.

1386
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:52,770
I-I-I-I-It doesn't
'cause it's too big.

1387
01:05:52,770 --> 01:05:54,810
FAA regulations.
You know, I just --

1388
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:56,770
too big for "most" airlines,
I mean.

1389
01:05:56,770 --> 01:05:59,150
Right this way. Let me
help you with that crate.

1390
01:06:00,650 --> 01:06:03,200
Okay, right this way.

1391
01:06:05,910 --> 01:06:07,620
Come on.

1392
01:06:16,790 --> 01:06:18,290
Ahh.

1393
01:06:20,590 --> 01:06:22,460
Where's Mr. Smith going?

1394
01:06:23,470 --> 01:06:24,420
Aw, screw it.

1395
01:06:24,470 --> 01:06:26,180
Let's go!
Get out of there!

1396
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:27,510
Hey!

1397
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:29,140
Get in there.

1398
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:31,640
Puggy!

1399
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:32,640
Nina.

1400
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:33,770
Where's Jenny?

1401
01:06:33,810 --> 01:06:35,140
They took her
on the plane.

1402
01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:36,350
Dad!

1403
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:38,690
They got on the plane.

1404
01:06:38,730 --> 01:06:41,270
They took Jenny.
Fly By Air, Gate J-4.

1405
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:42,820
All right, find a cop.

1406
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:44,570
Any cop!

1407
01:06:46,990 --> 01:06:49,830
Puggy, are you okay?

1408
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:54,910
Welcome to Fly By Air
Flight 2036--

1409
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,000
2038.

1410
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:57,540
Flight 2038 to Freeport.

1411
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:59,170
I'm Captain Justin Hobart,

1412
01:06:59,210 --> 01:07:01,630
and this is my copilot,
Jan Vigushin.

1413
01:07:01,670 --> 01:07:03,800
In a minute, we're gonna be
closing the door,

1414
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:06,130
giving you a safety briefing,
then we'll be on our way.

1415
01:07:06,170 --> 01:07:08,130
"Hey, how about we go" now?

1416
01:07:08,180 --> 01:07:11,260
Sir, we have to finish
the preflight checklist.

1417
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:13,010
It's for your safety, sir.

1418
01:07:13,010 --> 01:07:15,980
I got my safety
right here, asshole.

1419
01:07:24,860 --> 01:07:26,320
Okay, we're gonna
make this reaI easy.

1420
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:27,780
This is how
it's gonna work.

1421
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:29,700
Let's get the suitcase
out of here quick

1422
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:30,820
and as quiet as possible.

1423
01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:31,910
Got it.

1424
01:07:31,950 --> 01:07:33,700
Aah!

1425
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:35,870
Ohh!

1426
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:41,920
Your jurisdiction.

1427
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:56,890
Gentlemen.

1428
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:02,230
Well, Miami sucks...

1429
01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:04,480
but the cops
are kind of nice.

1430
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:06,230
You got that right.

1431
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,450
Hey... start the plane.

1432
01:08:10,490 --> 01:08:11,910
Uh, we have to close
the door,

1433
01:08:11,950 --> 01:08:13,240
and we don't have clearance
from the tower.

1434
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:14,780
I'll take care of the goddamn
door, zit-face.

1435
01:08:14,830 --> 01:08:17,540
Now start the plane, or I'll
blow your zit-face heads off.

1436
01:08:18,790 --> 01:08:20,790
- Snake.
- What?

1437
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:24,630
No!

1438
01:08:24,670 --> 01:08:25,800
Oh, shit.

1439
01:08:30,430 --> 01:08:32,510
This is Fly By Air
2036--

1440
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:33,970
- 38.
- 38.

1441
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:36,220
We have a man on the plane
with a gun.

1442
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:37,310
Get going.

1443
01:08:37,350 --> 01:08:38,770
I don't have a runway.

1444
01:08:38,770 --> 01:08:40,600
- '09er looks nice.
- '09er it is.

1445
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:45,270
Oh, my God, it's moving.

1446
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:47,820
You got to go get help.
I got to stop that plane.

1447
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:49,900
- Jenny! -- I'll
get Jenny. I promise.

1448
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:55,620
Ohh!

1449
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,000
Holy shit! Holy shit!

1450
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,670
Holy shit, holy shit!

1451
01:09:04,710 --> 01:09:06,670
Holy shit, holy shit!

1452
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:07,960
Matt!

1453
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:10,130
What? I can't find a cop.
Where's my dad?

1454
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:16,300
Dad?

1455
01:09:31,190 --> 01:09:32,700
Everyone please proceed
with caution.

1456
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:34,490
This area has just
been hot-mopped.

1457
01:09:34,490 --> 01:09:35,530
Gastric incident.

1458
01:09:35,570 --> 01:09:37,450
- Please keep moving.
- FBl.

1459
01:09:37,490 --> 01:09:39,040
Step back, please.
We've had an incident.

1460
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:41,500
Everyone proceed
with caution! B--

1461
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:43,830
Name's Arch Ridley. Tell me what
you need. Please don't kill me.

1462
01:09:43,830 --> 01:09:45,170
We're tracking
a couple of scumbags

1463
01:09:45,210 --> 01:09:48,170
with one, maybe two hostages
and a big metal suitcase.

1464
01:09:48,210 --> 01:09:50,630
Anybody in this crackerjack system
of yours see anything like that?

1465
01:09:50,670 --> 01:09:52,010
Let me just check
on that.

1466
01:09:52,050 --> 01:09:53,630
Would the owner

1467
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:54,890
of a yellow Humvee
parked on the curbside...

1468
01:09:54,930 --> 01:09:56,050
Hello, Alice --

1469
01:09:56,090 --> 01:09:57,850
What?

1470
01:09:57,850 --> 01:10:00,470
5 minutes ago, the tower got a
message from a Fly By Air pilot

1471
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:02,390
saying he's got a guy
with a gun on his plane.

1472
01:10:02,430 --> 01:10:04,060
- What gate?
- Gate J-4.

1473
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:05,650
Oh!

1474
01:10:05,690 --> 01:10:08,020
I thought you said
all the planes were grounded.

1475
01:10:13,650 --> 01:10:16,110
Give me the wing commander
at Homestead.

1476
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:19,080
Tell him we have a situation.
The plane's in the air.

1477
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:25,170
All right.
Now we're getting somewhere.

1478
01:10:25,210 --> 01:10:27,750
Peanuts?

1479
01:10:33,550 --> 01:10:35,840
Yes, I need all lines to stay
open between myself and Homestead.

1480
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:37,800
Mrs. Herk!

1481
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,600
My daughter's on the plane
with that man,

1482
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:41,680
and he tried to shoot at us,
and you have --

1483
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:44,730
Mrs. Herk, ma'am, listen, we need to know
where that metal suitcase is right now.

1484
01:10:44,730 --> 01:10:46,350
I don't know.
I don't know about a suitcase.

1485
01:10:46,390 --> 01:10:47,560
It's on the plane.

1486
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:50,110
Did anybody open
that suitcase?

1487
01:10:50,150 --> 01:10:51,940
They made us turn it on.

1488
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:53,070
What happened
when you turned it on?

1489
01:10:53,110 --> 01:10:54,950
Lights, little numbers.

1490
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:09,130
What's that thing doing?

1491
01:11:09,170 --> 01:11:10,710
It means
the rear door's open.

1492
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:12,590
I can't fly the plane much
longer with those stairs down.

1493
01:11:12,590 --> 01:11:14,970
Eddie, pull up those stairs
and close the door.

1494
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:19,760
Hey.

1495
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:23,310
Ugh!

1496
01:11:25,770 --> 01:11:27,390
Eddie --

1497
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:30,480
Eddie,
stop screwing around.

1498
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:37,320
Okay, confirm
they got him on radar.

1499
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:40,070
What does he mean
they have them on radar?

1500
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:41,990
Give me a second.

1501
01:11:42,030 --> 01:11:43,660
You're gonna shoot
that plane down.

1502
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:46,160
You can't do this. There's
innocent people on that plane.

1503
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:49,080
If that nuke goes off over
Freeport, "many" innocent people die.

1504
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,540
Now, nobody Iikes this,
okay?

1505
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:52,750
But this has been discussed,
"believe" me,

1506
01:11:52,790 --> 01:11:54,800
as high as it can be,
every scenario.

1507
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:58,300
- And this is the only
way out. -- How soon?

1508
01:11:58,340 --> 01:12:00,640
When the plane is over the
Gulf Stream -- three minutes.

1509
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:03,510
- What about the kid's father? Maybe he
made it onto the plane. -- Let's say he did.

1510
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:06,350
Is he, by any chance, familiar
with a Russian nuclear warhead

1511
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:08,600
with a plutonium rod encased
in a terillium core?

1512
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,190
I believe
he's in advertising.

1513
01:12:10,230 --> 01:12:11,520
Eddie.

1514
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:13,440
Eddie.

1515
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:15,150
Get up.
Get up, you Iazy shit.

1516
01:12:15,190 --> 01:12:16,990
He's not lazy.
He's unconscious.

1517
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:20,160
Aaah!

1518
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:24,370
Miami Tower, this is, uh...
Fly By Air 2036.

1519
01:12:24,410 --> 01:12:26,200
- 38.
- Whatever.

1520
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:28,000
What?
What did he say?

1521
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:29,410
What? What?

1522
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:31,420
They heard from the pilot.
H-- Hang on.

1523
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:34,130
You tell them get that suitcase
off the plane right now.

1524
01:12:34,170 --> 01:12:35,800
You understand me?
Right now!

1525
01:12:48,730 --> 01:12:50,810
Get the suitcase
off the plane!

1526
01:12:50,850 --> 01:12:53,150
The suitcase -- get it off!

1527
01:12:53,190 --> 01:12:54,360
Get it off the plane!

1528
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:56,690
Get the suitcase
off the plane!

1529
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:24,510
No!

1530
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:32,730
Let go of the suitcase!

1531
01:13:32,770 --> 01:13:36,860
The kingpin will never let go
of the kingpin's suitcase!

1532
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,900
It's a bomb!

1533
01:13:39,940 --> 01:13:42,360
It's a bomb!
Get it off the plane!

1534
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:56,710
Have it your way!

1535
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:02,050
It's gone!
The suitcase is gone!

1536
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:04,050
Falcon One, Falcon One,
break off.

1537
01:14:04,090 --> 01:14:05,930
I repeat, break off.
Do you read?

1538
01:14:49,850 --> 01:14:52,600
Mom, mom, Iisten to
this! It's totaIIy incredibIe!

1539
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:54,940
- It's the most amazing story.
- Oh!

1540
01:14:54,980 --> 01:14:57,190
You should've seen Matt's dad.
Seriously intense.

1541
01:14:57,230 --> 01:14:59,110
He smashed that really dumb guy
on the head

1542
01:14:59,150 --> 01:15:01,270
with the fire extinguisher,
which was very cool.

1543
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:03,530
And then that guy, Snake, he had
a gun, and he shot at Matt's dad.

1544
01:15:03,570 --> 01:15:05,650
Then Matt's dad started beating
the crap out of him.

1545
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:08,950
Then Matt's dad said, Iike he
was some sort of action hero,

1546
01:15:08,990 --> 01:15:11,030
"He's not lazy.
He's unconscious..."

1547
01:15:12,870 --> 01:15:14,960
I had to outrun a plane

1548
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,210
and subdue two convicts
with a nuclear weapon

1549
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:20,000
to get Matt's respect...

1550
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,130
Good job, dad.

1551
01:15:23,170 --> 01:15:25,510
...But it was worth it.

1552
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,300
Mr. Arnold?

1553
01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:33,310
Agent Alan Seitz, FBl.

1554
01:15:33,350 --> 01:15:35,560
The president thanks you for
your selfless act of courage.

1555
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,940
Because he can never admit to
knowledge of what happened here,

1556
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:39,190
in lieu
of a medal of honor,

1557
01:15:39,230 --> 01:15:40,980
he'd like to send you
a pair of cowboy boots

1558
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:43,110
with a "W" on them
and a hat.

1559
01:15:45,530 --> 01:15:48,530
Sorry for any trouble,
folks.

1560
01:15:48,530 --> 01:15:50,820
Eddie Leadbetter
served his sentence

1561
01:15:50,870 --> 01:15:53,540
at a correctional facility
just outside Jacksonville,

1562
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:56,370
and became very good friends
with his cellmate, Dwight,

1563
01:15:56,370 --> 01:15:59,120
who shared
similar tastes in humor.

1564
01:15:59,170 --> 01:16:01,420
Monica!

1565
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:02,750
Monica!

1566
01:16:02,790 --> 01:16:05,420
Walter Kramitz never returned
to the force.

1567
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:08,880
Being naked in public
was a revelation for him.

1568
01:16:08,930 --> 01:16:10,010
Walter loves the attention...

1569
01:16:10,050 --> 01:16:11,550
Stick 'em up!

1570
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:14,430
...But always tosses the pouch
to his new wife,

1571
01:16:14,470 --> 01:16:16,430
a Miss
Heather Weintraub Kramitz.

1572
01:16:17,730 --> 01:16:18,890
Pretty name.

1573
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:26,740
And with that,
I say good night.

1574
01:16:30,070 --> 01:16:33,580
Henry and Leonard still
refer to the Arthur Herk job

1575
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:36,910
as the low point
of their professional careers.

1576
01:16:36,910 --> 01:16:38,540
Your attention please.

1577
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:40,830
Captain Lynch has informed us
that there will be a delay

1578
01:16:40,870 --> 01:16:42,880
due to an obstruction
on the runway.

1579
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:54,140
I really feel
like killing somebody.

1580
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:55,810
You got that right.

1581
01:16:55,850 --> 01:16:57,930
We all go along
day after day,

1582
01:16:57,970 --> 01:17:01,190
when suddenly a bomb
drops into our lives.

1583
01:17:01,230 --> 01:17:04,230
Sometimes you can't get out
of the way.

1584
01:17:04,270 --> 01:17:07,530
Sometimes
it's a new beginning.

1585
01:17:07,570 --> 01:17:09,440
Let's take it slow.

1586
01:17:09,490 --> 01:17:10,780
Absolutely.

1587
01:17:10,780 --> 01:17:13,450
We were married a week
after Anna's divorce.

1588
01:17:13,450 --> 01:17:16,160
What is it that brings
two strangers together

1589
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:19,500
so that one soul
inhabits two bodies?

1590
01:17:19,540 --> 01:17:22,290
Sometimes it's profound.

1591
01:17:22,290 --> 01:17:24,880
Sometimes it's Fritos.

1592
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:41,100
Make her stop!

1593
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:44,650
God in Heaven, make her stop!

1594
01:17:44,690 --> 01:17:47,150
She wants my soul!

1595
01:17:47,190 --> 01:17:49,820
Arugula! Arugula!

1596
01:17:49,860 --> 01:17:51,150
Arrrrrugula!
