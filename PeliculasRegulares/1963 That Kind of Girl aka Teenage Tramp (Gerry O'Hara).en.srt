1
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,801
One will do for you two.

2
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,680
Ah, here we are.
Some more of those there.

3
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,810
- Hello, Max. Still at it?
- Yeah, still at it.

4
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,520
This paper, what does it mean?

5
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,523
It's a campaign for nuclear disarmament.
It's a "Ban the bomb" march.

6
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,777
- I see, that's nice.
- Nice?

7
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,404
- Yeah, you must be foreigner, eh?
- Yes, I am from Austria.

8
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,531
Oh. Now, let me see.

9
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,158
In Deutsch that's...

10
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,911
<i>Der Marsch gegen der atomisch Bomber.</i>

11
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,205
<i>Ach, natürlich.</i>
You speak German well.

12
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,624
I wish I did.
I'm studying it at night school.

13
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,042
I take lessons also.

14
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:15,420
Look, we got people from all countries
going on this march.

15
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,588
Why don't you come with us?

16
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,465
It's a protest to
stop them making the bomb.

17
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:21,468
- It is difficult for me.
- Look, you don't have to decide now.

18
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:24,596
I would have to ask.
I'm with a family, an Au pair.

19
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,391
Well, look, think about it.
I've got to be going.

20
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,684
Must... You must leave?

21
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,770
Well, I've got to get rid of this lot
and I'm late already.

22
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:34,398
You know, I've got an idea.
We could help each other.

23
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,942
With the languages, I mean.
You know, we could teach one another.

24
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,735
Yes, but my English is so bad.

25
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,779
Oh, that don't matter.

26
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:45,200
- Are you doing anything tonight?
- I was going to a club in Bayswater.

27
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:49,079
It's very nice. You can dance
and all the foreign students go there.

28
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:52,165
- Yeah, I'll bet it's for members only.
- Not if you’re invited.

29
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,335
- I'll be there at 9:00.
- Oh, I don't know about dancing.

30
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,087
I ain't much good at this twisting lark.

31
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,240
Oh, you have to be a contortionist.

32
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,327
Oh, look, come on.

33
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,037
Look.

34
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,332
Max, listen to the music.

35
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,834
Listen to it? It's deafening me.

36
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,838
Look, pretend you're drying your back
with a towel.

37
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,133
- That's it, swing the hips.
- Yes.

38
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,927
That's it.

39
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,263
Oh, that's all right, 'innit?

40
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:54,269
- Ta.
- Thank you.

41
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,314
- I told you I don't dance.
- Max, now you're angry.

42
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,191
You're so serious, but I like it.

43
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,943
Well, I'm not a playboy
if that's what you mean.

44
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,904
Well, what with working
at the library all day

45
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:06,531
and evening class at night,
it don't leave much time for dancing.

46
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,075
Tell me about your job.

47
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,535
Oh, I told you
I work at the public library, don't I?

48
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,372
- You work so hard.
- I like books.

49
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,207
I do a lot of reading on the side.

50
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,542
Technical writer,
that's what I want to be.

51
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,920
Yeah, we got
a foreign languages section, too.

52
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,005
Goethe, Schiller, Thomas Mann.

53
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,133
We had them at school in Austria.
My father reads Schiller.

54
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,261
You're lucky. My old man don't read
anything but the newspapers.

55
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,680
And then that's just
to see what's on television.

56
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:31,848
You live at home?

57
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,643
What? It's like bloody Coronation Street
down there.

58
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,561
No, I got out
as soon as I got me first job.

59
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:37,979
You quarreled with your parents?

60
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,899
Oh, no, we didn't quarrel.
No, I just had to get out of that place.

61
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,401
You see, we didn't
talk the same language.

62
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,759
Here, tell me.
What do the Austrians think of Hitler?

63
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,804
- Oh...
- May I?

64
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:13,223
- Please.
- Please yourself.

65
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,058
Thank you.

66
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,900
- You're German, aren't you?
- No, from Austria.

67
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:26,778
Oh, it's near enough.
They all little darlings like you?

68
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,029
Oh.

69
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,785
- Who is the boyfriend?
- Oh, that's Max.

70
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,412
Oh, is he "the" boyfriend?

71
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,705
Well, he's very nice.

72
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,957
Oh, I don't think he's exactly
mad about me, somehow.

73
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,753
- What's your name?
- Eva.

74
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,089
- A very pretty name.
- Thank you.

75
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,425
Mine's Elliot.

76
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,802
- Max taking you to supper?
- No, he didn't say so.

77
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,221
Well, he's missed his chance then,
hasn't he?

78
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,223
- You know the Maroc?
- What's that?

79
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,725
Well, it's a nightclub.

80
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,894
- I've never been to a real nightclub.
- Oh.

81
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,229
Where I come from
there are no nightclubs.

82
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,606
What are we waiting for?

83
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:06,318
I would like to. No I can't,
not tonight, I invited Max.

84
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,069
Tomorrow then?

85
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,238
Um...

86
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,741
- I'll have to ask.
- What? Max?

87
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,327
- No, the family I am with.
- Oh.

88
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,997
Ring me up, Flaxman, 83-22.

89
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:22,667
Flaxman, 83-22.

90
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,588
Right, I'll phone you.

91
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,591
Tell me, what do the Austrians
think about Hitler?

92
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,595
- Thank you.
- That's all right.

93
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,096
Thank you.

94
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,681
- Enjoy it?
- Yes.

95
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,436
You have to go to bed now.

96
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,648
Eva, there's a telephone call for you.

97
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:45,982
Oh!

98
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,610
It's all right. I'll look after him.

99
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,695
Thank you, Mrs Millar.

100
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,366
Come on.
It's time you're in bed, isn't it?

101
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,330
Yes, please. Elliot.

102
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,795
Tonight? I don't know.
One moment, please.

103
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:09,798
- Mr Millar.
- Yes, Eva?

104
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,551
It's Elliot.
He has tickets for the theatre.

105
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,971
Do you think Mrs Millar
would mind if I went out tonight?

106
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:19,975
Well, that's the third time
you've been out with him this week.

107
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:22,519
- I suppose it's all right.
- Thank you.

108
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:25,814
Elliot, it's all right.
Yes, I'll be ready.

109
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,649
See you soon. Bye.

110
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,531
- Eva and her boyfriends.
- Oh, it's natural, I suppose.

111
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,324
Wouldn't mind dating her myself.

112
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:40,370
I wonder what you'd find to talk about.
I wonder what any of them do.

113
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:43,498
This Elliot she's been going out with
sounds quite intelligent.

114
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,667
And Max works in a library.

115
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,752
Didn't she have a date with Max tonight?

116
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,087
Yes, she did.

117
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:51,715
Going to be a bit of a mix-up
if they arrive at the same time.

118
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,510
That's just like Eva.
Absolutely nothing up here.

119
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,055
- Would you like a drink, darling?
- No, not just now.

120
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:04,019
Still, one can't help liking her.
And Nicholas adores her.

121
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,438
Yes, but she's
a bit of a responsibility.

122
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,565
I'm damn sure she couldn't
go out like that at home.

123
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:12,360
At home? She has to be in by 10 o'clock.
She said so.

124
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,446
Anyway, I've told her.
All these young men

125
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,948
she's going out with
are only after one thing.

126
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,243
Enjoying yourself?

127
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,829
- Like anything else?
- I'm completely fed up.

128
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,831
Oh, I hope not.

129
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,588
Waiter.

130
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,758
- Liqueur, sir?
- Yes.

131
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:20,136
What would you like, darling?
Cognac, Tia Maria, something like that?

132
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,846
Elliot, you know I don't drink.

133
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,265
You already had some wine.

134
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,601
A little, and only because
you ordered Liebfraumilch.

135
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,812
Oh, come on, have something.
This is a celebration.

136
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,814
Please, no.

137
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,442
- I'll have a large brandy and coffee.
- For two, sir?

138
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,652
- Yes, for two.
- Thank you.

139
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,115
It's cabaret time
at the Latin Quarter.

140
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,117
To open our show tonight
we have pleasure in presenting

141
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,952
the fabulous Margo.

142
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,721
Elliot, why is it a celebration?

143
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,890
Oh. For us.

144
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,186
For you and me.

145
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:56,733
You know, Eva,
in my business, advertising,

146
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,027
there's so much insincerity.

147
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:02,197
Everybody's always trying
to sell, sell, sell.

148
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,909
That's why it means so much
to meet a girl like you.

149
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:09,412
- Why me?
- Because you're so direct.

150
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:12,207
Because you always say
exactly what you mean.

151
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:15,585
You like that? I'm not clever enough
to say anything else.

152
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,879
You're very, very sweet.

153
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,660
Why you are not married,
a handsome man like you?

154
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:33,705
There you go.

155
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:37,792
- Tell me, why?
- Big question.

156
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,502
You are divorced?

157
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:42,505
No, I suppose
I never met the right girl.

158
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,304
There was a girl once. We were engaged.

159
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,056
- Or as good as.
- And?

160
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,017
She met a man she liked better.

161
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,562
Well, after that, it rather finished me
for that sort of thing.

162
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,314
But that's terrible.

163
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,567
You ought to have a house and children
and someone to look after you.

164
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,111
Oh, feel like taking me on?

165
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:09,032
Well, I'm too much of an old bachelor
for the patter of tiny feet,

166
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,659
nappies hanging on the line.

167
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,162
- You like children, don't you?
- I love them.

168
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,955
When I marry I'm going to have six.

169
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,541
Are you, indeed? That's a warning.

170
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:27,884
I tell you what. Let's finish here
and go back to my place for coffee.

171
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,178
Elliot, I can't.

172
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,513
It's late and I promised Mrs Millar.

173
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,848
Oh, what's it to do with her?

174
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,351
They treat you as though
you were still in pigtails.

175
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:40,021
It isn't that. Elliot, no.

176
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:45,068
What is it then, Eva?

177
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,528
Because you have been so kind to me,

178
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:51,324
taking me out,
and it's wonderful being with you.

179
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:55,203
And I don't know what I shall do.

180
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,332
Now you look just like a little boy.

181
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,211
I've never been with a man.

182
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:05,755
Oh, now look, just don't worry.

183
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,181
Waiter! Bill.

184
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,713
- Oh, leave those for the morning.
- All right.

185
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:49,298
- Will you lock up?
- Yes.

186
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,259
I say, Eva's a bit late, isn't she?

187
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:53,928
I expect she'll look
like death warmed up again tomorrow.

188
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,723
Eva!

189
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:00,810
- Can we do it again?
- Yeah, of course.

190
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,103
Eva!

191
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,813
Off you go.

192
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:08,443
Hey. It's me afternoon off.
I thought I'd find you here.

193
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,944
I've been ringing you
for the past fortnight.

194
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,779
They said you'd ring me at the library.

195
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:14,323
Um, Mrs Millar must have forgotten.

196
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,743
Like you forgot our date, remember?

197
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,244
Eva!

198
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:24,625
Okay, but be careful.

199
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,632
Look, if you don't want
to go out with me

200
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,634
you've only got to say so,
I can take the hint.

201
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:34,969
But, Max, I do.

202
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,305
Oh, it's starting to rain again.
I must get Nicholas home.

203
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,307
- Look, I only came to remind you.
- Remind me?

204
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,017
Well, it's next weekend.

205
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,144
You said you was coming
on the march, from Aldermaston.

206
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,645
"Ban the bomb", that's right.

207
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:45,980
So, what, are you coming?
It'll do you good

208
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,482
to get out in the country.

209
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,484
- Nicholas, come along!
- Look, there's a crowd of us going.

210
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,986
The special leaves Paddington,
7:30, Friday night.

211
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,696
I can meet you
at the station if you like.

212
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:57,366
Max, I'll see.
I promise.

213
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,787
Ring me tonight and cheer up. Nicholas.

214
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,667
Ban the bomb, join the march!
Ban the bomb, join the march!

215
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,505
Ban the bomb, join the march!
Ban the bomb, join the march!

216
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,851
I told you, you shouldn't have
worn daft shoes like that.

217
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,269
You told me we were taking a train.

218
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,271
Only to Didcot.

219
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,607
This is a demonstration, not a picnic.

220
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:14,402
Look, we're stopping for lunch
in three-quarters of an hour.

221
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:15,736
Three-quarters of an hour.

222
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,530
Come on. Come on.

223
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:21,117
The march is now 10,000 strong.

224
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:24,579
The march is now 10,000 strong.

225
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,708
All right,
I'll go along with you on that.

226
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,460
Greece at the time of Pericles
was more civilised than we are now.

227
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,380
People will confuse
material progress with civilisation.

228
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,756
Yeah, but you see,
the Greek civilisation

229
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:39,093
was based on slavery,
and you can't call that democracy.

230
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,636
Plato didn't believe in democracy.

231
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,471
Oh, you can't blame him
when you look around today.

232
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,098
- Hello, Ted.
- Hello, Max.

233
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,224
Eh, this is Eva, she comes from Austria.

234
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,392
- Hello.
- Hi.

235
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,560
These are friends of mine.

236
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,103
- Ted works at the library.
- I'm so thirsty.

237
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,897
- Hi.
- Hi.

238
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,106
Oh.

239
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,734
I believe they are
starting up in Austria.

240
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:55,818
Please?

241
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,613
He means the campaign against H weapons.

242
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,156
Oh, it's time, isn't it?

243
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,617
Nothing personal,
but it was Hitler that started it all.

244
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,660
It was no more Hitler
than you or me.

245
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,621
The bomb was a historical necessity.

246
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,456
Given the scientific know-how,
the productive capacity...

247
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,666
But Hitler was the catalyst.

248
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,168
Oh, I'm not blaming him any more

249
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:15,296
than the Americans or the Russians
or ourselves, come to that.

250
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,965
- Do you talk about these things at home?
- Please?

251
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:21,093
Like giving the Wehrmacht
nuclear weapons?

252
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:26,349
What the Wehrmacht do I don't know.
We don't like the Germans in Austria.

253
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,646
Max, do you have a shilling?
I would like to have another coke.

254
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,481
Yeah, I'll go.

255
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:40,696
No, you stay here with your friends.
We walked so much.

256
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,827
How'd you like to go to war with that?

257
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:50,498
If she's representative of
the post-war generation, God help us.

258
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,833
She's only 18,
only been here a couple of months.

259
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:55,002
Have you made the grade yet?

260
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,337
Going steady with her, aren't I?

261
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,547
When? Haven't missed you
in night school.

262
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,509
What's all this talk of going out
steady, anyway? Where will that get you?

263
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:04,679
You get married, you settle down.
Then kids come along.

264
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,348
Some bloody brass hat
presses a button and boom!

265
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,183
That's the sort of mess
we're trying to clear up, innit?

266
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:12,687
Look, we all know that sex
is a physiological need,

267
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,855
but why be so sanctimonious about it?

268
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:17,817
Unless someone had, you wouldn't
be here to talk about it, would you?

269
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,861
Anyway,
who said anything about marrying?

270
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,030
Oh, no. Max is a regular Don Juan.

271
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,032
You know what I found him doing
the other day in the library?

272
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,158
Lay off it, Ted.

273
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,536
Mugging up a book
on the technique of sex.

274
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:48,723
Time we turned in, ain't it?

275
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,267
- Here?
- Well, where do you think?

276
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:54,353
I keep telling you,
this ain't a luxury tour.

277
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:57,189
Well, look, we can
take a look around if you like.

278
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,777
What about this? It's all right, innit?

279
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,576
Put your bed out and we're away.

280
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:19,587
- Make yourself comfortable now.
- But how about you?

281
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,674
I'll be all right.
I'll kip over there.

282
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:32,099
That is, unless you'd like me
to sleep outside?

283
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:36,062
- Max.
- Make yourself comfortable, okay?

284
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,232
- Max.
- Look, we've got to get some sleep

285
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:42,943
we've got a long way to go tomorrow.

286
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:48,783
You're so uncomfortable. Max, come here.

287
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:59,752
- It isn't that I don't like you.
- Then what is it?

288
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:04,090
I don't exactly sleep around myself.

289
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:20,481
- No, Max.
- Why not?

290
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:26,612
Because it isn't possible.
Please, try to understand.

291
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:30,825
Oh, I get it. Never been
with a man before, that's it, innit?

292
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:35,413
Max, please.
There's a dictionary in my bag.

293
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,748
Dictionary?

294
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:41,168
Oh, I get it. I know about women.

295
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,673
That's all right.

296
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,425
Good night, Eva.

297
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,849
The march is now assembling.

298
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,851
The march is now assembling,

299
00:23:56,977 --> 00:24:01,021
and we'll be moving on
at 9:30 precisely.

300
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:05,317
These are your positions and
will you please follow them carefully.

301
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,695
- At the front...
- Hello, Max, where did you disappear to?

302
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,196
- Hello fellas.
- Have a good night?

303
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,866
- Oh, you know.
- Where's the glamour girl this morning?

304
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,033
She's about.

305
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:18,289
Max, Max, I just heard.
We're not even halfway to London.

306
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:19,874
But I told you, love,

307
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,293
tonight we stop at Slough,
Sunday we move on to Acton...

308
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,128
- No, Max.
- You mean you're packing it in?

309
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:26,046
I can't, not another three days.

310
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,548
What's all this, then, trouble?

311
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:28,883
Look, you stay out of this.
She's going to make

312
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,551
a damn fool of me if she backs down now.

313
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,387
Oh, come on, Max.
She's not exactly dressed for hiking.

314
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:34,555
She's had a rough night.

315
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,474
She came on this because
she wanted to, didn't she?

316
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,683
Well, you might have explained...

317
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,143
Well, Eva can do
what she bloody well pleases,

318
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,394
I couldn't care less.

319
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,729
He gets like this.

320
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,814
Look, if I was you,
I'd take the bus back to town.

321
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,650
- He's so upset.
- Oh, Max'll get over it.

322
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:47,902
I'll stake you for the fare.

323
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:51,906
There's a bus stop just down the road.
Come on, I'll show you.

324
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:24,897
- Would you like a lift?
- Oh, yes, please.

325
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,732
- Where are you going?
- Well, London.

326
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:28,275
Then hop in.

327
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:39,954
I lost the bus.

328
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,039
Lucky I was passing.

329
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:45,167
I'm so untidy. I was with the marchers.

330
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:49,547
You were? Hard on the feet.
Go on, take your shoes off.

331
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,716
Not what you've been marching in,
are they?

332
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,510
It was a big mistake.

333
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:56,178
'Cause I agree
with this "ban the bomb" crowd.

334
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,264
It's absolute lunacy,
testing and things,

335
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,349
poisoning the atmosphere.

336
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:03,227
But if the other lot have them,
what can we do?

337
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:07,189
I mean, I'm damn sure they don't
allow marches over there.

338
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:12,861
- Are you a racing driver?
- No, strictly amateur.

339
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,905
I've always liked messing about
with motor cars.

340
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,366
My father gave me this
for my 21st birthday.

341
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,868
What is that number painted on the side?

342
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:23,038
That. I was over at Brands Hatch
on Saturday.

343
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,792
You mean racing? Did you win?

344
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,087
No, I came a bad sixth.

345
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:34,758
Look, if I'm going too fast for you
just tell me.

346
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,927
I love it. It's exciting.

347
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:01,702
- Give my love to Nicholas.
- I will. Thank you very much.

348
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:05,289
Glad to help out.
We must meet again sometime.

349
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,752
I usually go to La Bazura
in the evenings.

350
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,629
- La Bazura?
- Yes.

351
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:14,006
It's a club in Bayswater
for foreign students.

352
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:17,801
Must look in sometime.
Bye, Eva. It's been fun.

353
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,428
Bye, Keith.

354
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:42,743
Hi. Sorry, Janet.

355
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:46,163
He went rambling up about metallic
fatigue and the theory of structure.

356
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:47,956
- I just couldn't get a word in.
- That's all right.

357
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,750
Hey, wait a sec.

358
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,460
My lecturer's still away on holiday.

359
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,420
Did you enjoy your weekend?
Did the car go well?

360
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,547
All right, the valves need fixing.

361
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,132
- Like a coffee?
- Hmm.

362
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,801
Picked up a smashing blonde
on the way home.

363
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,844
- Oh, yes?
- Oh, nothing.

364
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:03,764
She was just a refugee from
the "ban the bomb" march.

365
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,599
I gave her a lift.

366
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,519
- How about you?
- Oh, you know. I gave Mum a hand.

367
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,437
I tried to get on with my French thesis.

368
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,399
Dad was gardening.
As if you didn't know.

369
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,109
I've been thinking.
I want to talk to him, Janet.

370
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,361
- But what about?
- We've got to have it out with him.

371
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:19,988
- Why now, so suddenly?
- Suddenly?

372
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,825
- Janet, you've said you'll marry me.
- Yes, when you've finished your degree.

373
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:26,537
What difference does that make?
You know how my parents feel about you.

374
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,288
They'll help us
till I begin with the firm.

375
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:31,333
No, my father feels differently.
I told you he came up the hard way.

376
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,335
He started off as ordinary porter
at King's Cross.

377
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,713
And now he's a traffic manager. So what?

378
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:38,882
I'm sorry, Janet. I admire him for that.
You know I do.

379
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,008
But what's that to do with us?

380
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:42,928
All right, Keith. You talk to him.
But don't say I didn't warn you.

381
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,931
If it's the money side
that's bothering you, Mr Bates,

382
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:47,349
you needn't worry.

383
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:50,060
My parents will look after that.

384
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,980
Your dad could have all the dough
in the world. And probably has.

385
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,941
But it's your future I'm worried about.
How I look at it,

386
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:58,068
a young man should stand
on his own feet.

387
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:01,363
You've a fine career in front of you
and I don't want to see you spoil it.

388
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,198
Mr Bates, it's always been understood

389
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,908
that I'm going into
my father's business.

390
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,536
Yes, once you've got
your engineering degree.

391
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,997
It won't help your studies
to have a wife on your hands.

392
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,373
Too many other things to think about.

393
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,251
But a couple of blokes in my year
are married already.

394
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,253
- Things have changed.
- Good luck to them.

395
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:19,339
But I still say, one thing at a time.

396
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,716
I never went to college, Keith.

397
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,510
But I do know a thing or two
about marriage.

398
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,138
How long do you need
before you finish your course?

399
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:29,892
Eighteen months,
if I pass my exams in June.

400
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,810
Just if. And if not?

401
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,563
Another year.

402
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:37,232
Well, Janet can do
what she likes once she's 21.

403
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:41,069
Though I still hope she takes my advice.
Don't get me wrong,

404
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:43,071
you two have been going out together.

405
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,783
And Janet's mother and I
would like to see you getting married.

406
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:50,162
Eighteen months isn't too long to wait.

407
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:52,372
She's worth it, isn't she?

408
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,794
Don't take it too hard, son.
Talk it over with Janet.

409
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:08,222
- I told you, Keith.
- What does he know about it anyway?

410
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,807
Oh, I hope you didn't say that to Dad.

411
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:10,974
Honey, when he was young,

412
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:14,228
people didn't have
six-year degree courses.

413
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,521
It's not natural to wait so long.

414
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,898
Poor old Dad, he never had
the chance to take a degree.

415
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:21,235
- They scraped to send me to university.
- What's it to do with us?

416
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,946
They had to wait, too. He was earning
30 bob a week at your age.

417
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,365
It's all so bloody silly
when there is no money problem.

418
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,742
- What had he to say to that?
- Oh, you know.

419
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:32,663
"Hard work never did anyone any harm"
and all that stuff.

420
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:38,418
- You must have thought about it.
- Thought about what?

421
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:41,088
Well, sex.

422
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:44,091
It's not natural for two people

423
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:47,177
to see each other
as much as we do without...

424
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:50,055
Oh, it's all so stuffy and suburban.

425
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:53,016
- But I'm a suburban girl, Keith.
- No, you're not, Janet.

426
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,060
- I didn't mean it like that.
- Then what did you mean?

427
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:56,478
Look, I'm not that kind of girl

428
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,146
and you wouldn't respect me
for it if I was.

429
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:00,357
And you needn't be
so damn smug and prissy about it.

430
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:02,401
Oh, I never knew it was prissy
to wait until you were married

431
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:03,527
before sleeping with a man.

432
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:07,447
But I've asked you to marry me.
I've gone down on my hands and knees!

433
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,951
- Of course, if you can't wait...
- You speak just like your father.

434
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,287
What you don't understand is
it's so much easier for a woman

435
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,413
than it is for a man.

436
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:16,290
Is it? Who put that into your head?

437
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,541
Look, I've done my best.

438
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:18,876
But I'm damned if I'm gonna submit

439
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,503
to your family's views
on love and marriage.

440
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,463
They're out of the ark.

441
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,842
If you feel like that,
there's nothing I can say.

442
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,847
- I thought you'd forgotten.
- Of course not. I've been very tied up.

443
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:17,267
- I was just passing by...
- Oh, yes. And you know something?

444
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:18,602
I was looking for you every night.

445
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:23,565
- How's Nicholas?
- Nicholas is fine.

446
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,359
Aren't you going to ask me for a dance?

447
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:28,570
In England, the man usually asks,
but let's go.

448
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,256
It's a bit hot in here.
Is it always like this?

449
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:30,924
Keith, there's a wonderful
party tonight.

450
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,676
- Really?
- Hmm. It's in the country.

451
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,844
It wouldn't take long to drive.

452
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:36,346
- But I haven't been invited.
- Doesn't matter. Everyone is invited.

453
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,933
- We're all going.
- Some party. I don't know about tonight.

454
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,768
I mean, if it's in the country,
it'll be all night.

455
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,271
- And what about Nicholas?
- Oh, the Millars won't mind.

456
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:46,440
So long as I'm home in time
to get him up.

457
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:49,359
- How far is it?
- Let's see... Oh, Virginia would know.

458
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:52,446
- Virginia, where's the party?
- It's on the Thames at Weybridge.

459
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:54,656
- Are you both coming?
- I would love to. Hmm?

460
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,491
All right, let's go.

461
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,303
Jimmy, bring me a towel!

462
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,812
How about a swim?

463
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,815
Come on in. It's warm.

464
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:32,486
- But I haven't a swimsuit.
- Neither's she.

465
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,197
- There's music. What else do you want?
- Okay.

466
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,865
Right. Meet you here in two minutes.

467
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:00,680
- It's cold!
- Come on, Eva!

468
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,477
It is cold.

469
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,357
Come on, Eva.

470
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:01,116
- I must look a sight.
- You look wonderful.

471
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:04,870
What a crazy idea!
Lucky it's a warm night.

472
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:08,790
- Had enough? Want to go home?
- Soon. I would love a cigarette.

473
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:15,881
Thanks.

474
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:23,263
- No matches.
- Oh. It doesn't matter.

475
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,979
- You're not cold?
- No, I'm not.

476
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:34,941
Eva?

477
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,278
A kiss.

478
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,313
I must go now.

479
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,149
Anyway, you have plenty of time
for Nicholas.

480
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:19,694
Eva. There's something
I want you to know.

481
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,154
Tomorrow.

482
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,046
Eva?

483
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:40,173
Elliot! Oh, I didn't know you were back.

484
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,217
That's a lie.
You saw me well enough at the club.

485
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:45,345
- I can't talk now. I must go in.
- Oh, no, you don't.

486
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:48,640
Who was that? Oh, go on. Who was it?

487
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:53,019
- Hold on. Look, Eva, I had to go away.
- Yes. For two weeks.

488
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,854
All right! Two weeks.
It was a business trip.

489
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:59,276
I couldn't help it. I had to stay on.
Well, I wrote to you, didn't I?

490
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,988
Look, Eva. Doesn't anything
we did together, doesn't it...

491
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,823
Doesn't it mean anything to you?

492
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:09,202
- You know I liked going out.
- Oh, you liked going out. Is that all?

493
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:13,999
I thought I'd met someone
who was different.

494
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:17,460
But you were different.
You were unspoilt.

495
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,004
I enjoyed being with you.

496
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:22,674
But can I help it if someone young
comes along and I like him?

497
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:26,136
No, you can't help it.
You can't help a thing!

498
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,723
And I didn't go near a woman
the whole time I was away.

499
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,850
I lay awake at night
just thinking about you

500
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:33,893
like a 20-year-old kid.

501
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:37,814
And you don't give a damn
because you're another little tramp!

502
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:39,357
Elliot, I go in now... Don't...

503
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,821
- You're coming back with me.
- No!

504
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,370
Let me go!

505
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,081
No!

506
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,841
- All right, miss? Hold on.
- Yeah.

507
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:23,443
He got clean away. You feel all right?

508
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:26,613
You'd better come down to the station
with me and make a statement.

509
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,865
Now, take it easy, dear.
Come along, now.

510
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,953
There's a good boy. There's a nice boy.

511
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,374
Did you get a clear look at him?

512
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:40,752
Would you recognise him
if you saw him again?

513
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,629
He came from behind.

514
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:46,132
But you told the constable
that he stepped out of a side turning.

515
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:47,717
It was dark.

516
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,970
Are you quite certain
you've never met him before?

517
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:54,599
Look, I know you've had a fright.
I'm glad it was nothing more.

518
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:57,727
But if you know anything,
it's your duty to tell us.

519
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:00,271
In the interests of other women
as well as your own.

520
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:02,065
You haven't given us much to go on.

521
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:03,650
I'm sorry.

522
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:06,236
Very well. We shall have to book it,

523
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,571
- "Assault by person unknown."
- Can I go now?

524
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:13,243
Well, I can't force you
to do this. It's up to you.

525
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:15,495
But I'd like you to see
the police surgeon.

526
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,580
But I told you,
he didn't interfere with me.

527
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,457
All the same,
I think it would be sensible.

528
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,585
A matter of routine.
He's here now. It won't take a moment.

529
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,338
- I must get back.
- You'll be through in 10 minutes.

530
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,612
Good afternoon.
You're a new patient, aren't you?

531
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,699
- I brought this from the police surgeon.
- I see.

532
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,367
I don't know why he send me.

533
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:56,369
I expect he thought
you should have a check.

534
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:58,204
There's nothing to be frightened about.

535
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:02,041
Now, there are just one or two details
I should like.

536
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,502
First of all, your name and address.

537
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:08,047
Nobody will know. Treatment here
is absolutely confidential.

538
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,884
Once I've filled in your card,
I shall give you a number.

539
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:14,387
Then when you hear it called out,
you'll go straight in to the doctor.

540
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:16,890
Now, your name first.

541
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,892
Koenig. Eva Koenig.

542
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,395
And your address?

543
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:29,986
So, you've been suffering
from a sore throat and a rash.

544
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:33,656
It was nothing.
I've had sores all winter. But this...

545
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:37,494
A great many women contract
venereal disease without realising it.

546
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:39,871
Oh, please don't get upset.

547
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,916
The great thing is you came to see us.

548
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:46,169
Now, tell me about your boyfriends.

549
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:49,255
You do understand me?

550
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,424
- Where do you come from?
- Austria.

551
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,593
Oh, fascinating country.

552
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:57,263
I've spent holidays in the Tirol.

553
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:02,352
Now, I know these are intimate questions
but I need the details.

554
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,356
- Has there been more than one?
- Yes.

555
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:09,275
Now tell me about
your most recent boyfriend.

556
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:12,445
When did you first
have intercourse with him?

557
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:17,242
It only happened once,
and just two days ago.

558
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,245
I see.

559
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:23,790
Did either of you use contraceptives?

560
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,296
Did you know him well?
Have you got his name and address?

561
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:32,799
I only want to know
in case you have to trace him.

562
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,593
- I could find him.
- Very well.

563
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:40,431
Now, you said there'd been
a second friend. When was that?

564
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:43,226
It was some weeks ago.

565
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:58,491
Now, I'm going to take a little blood
so that we can make a test.

566
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:01,160
It isn't painful.

567
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:04,497
Just keep your arm steady.

568
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:26,519
Syphilis?

569
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:30,440
I told you already.
It's easy enough to pick up.

570
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:34,444
The main risk is for anyone
to have sex outside marriage.

571
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:37,864
We'll get you right. It's lucky
you came to us in the early stages.

572
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,700
You'll have to attend here regularly,
mind you.

573
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:42,368
A girlfriend of mine told me

574
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:45,872
they stick needles into you
and they expand like umbrellas.

575
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,665
Oh, come on now.

576
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:49,459
You'll have your penicillin daily

577
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:51,794
and in a fortnight,
the course will be completed.

578
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:55,548
After that you'll need periodic checks
for two years.

579
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,675
- When do I start?
- Now.

580
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:03,389
Oh, cheer up.
It's no worse than the blood test.

581
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:07,185
I'll take you through to Sister now.
But there's one other thing.

582
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:08,686
I want you to give one of these slips

583
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,730
to each of those boyfriends
you told me about.

584
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:14,317
- So that they come here for examination.
- Oh, must I?

585
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:19,072
You caught syphilis
from your first friend.

586
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:21,991
In all probability,
you've infected the other two.

587
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,494
Oh, no.

588
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:31,417
And the Millars.
Could I have given it to them?

589
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,752
I was coming to that.

590
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:35,588
Syphilis is normally passed on
by sexual intercourse.

591
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,675
But that rash of yours
means the disease has spread.

592
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:41,844
Chance infection could occur
if you were handling a child.

593
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:44,555
Nicholas. It's awful!

594
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,434
I don't say it's likely.

595
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,938
Now, I'll take you through to Sister
for your injection.

596
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:55,066
And after that you have a word with
the almoner. I'm sure she'll help you.

597
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,234
I know how you feel.

598
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:59,612
We've all done things without thinking
of the consequences to other people.

599
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:02,865
What am I to tell Mrs Millar?
They've been so kind to me.

600
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,951
It's up to you, Eva. We can't force you.

601
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,787
Don't you see? They'll send me
straight back to Austria.

602
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:10,248
And I can't face my father. I can't.

603
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,958
I can't promise anything,

604
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:14,544
but the Millars sound
sympathetic sort of people.

605
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:16,129
It's a child.

606
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:18,756
If I were you,
I'd make a clean breast of it.

607
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:22,427
Tell Mrs Millar to go to their family
doctor who can get a report from us.

608
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:24,262
Now that you're getting
regular injections,

609
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:26,973
there'll be no danger to Nicholas,
if that's what's worrying you.

610
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:30,143
- Um, I'll try.
- You do that.

611
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,978
Now, about these young men.

612
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:35,064
You say you can't contact
this first friend?

613
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:38,651
Eva, I've heard about the assault.

614
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,945
Are you certain you don't know the man
who attacked you?

615
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,822
I... I...

616
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:47,660
Nothing you say to me
will go outside these four walls.

617
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,746
Not even to the police?

618
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,832
I think it'd be sensible
for you to tell the police.

619
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:56,669
But as far as we're concerned, no,
not even to the police.

620
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:59,005
Yes. It was Elliot.

621
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:01,591
My first friend.

622
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:04,594
But I'm frightened,
frightened of what he'll do.

623
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:07,346
In that case,
you can send him the slip by post.

624
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:09,766
If I know his sort,
it won't be the first.

625
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,684
- You know his address?
- Yes.

626
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:15,354
Then we seem to be on the way
to settling our problems.

627
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:18,149
You'll see the other two
and speak to them?

628
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:21,986
I don't know where Keith lives.
I don't know anything about him.

629
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,155
Except he's wonderful.

630
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:27,658
But he'll ring me
or turn up at the club, I'm sure.

631
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:33,706
Keith.

632
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:38,461
- Hello, Janet.
- You've been avoiding me.

633
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:40,838
Well, after that row, I didn't think
you wanted to see me again.

634
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:42,381
Oh, you know that isn't true.

635
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:43,549
If two people can't have a row

636
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:47,470
without one of them going off
and sulking... Oh, come on now.

637
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:50,556
I've been thinking about you
all the time.

638
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:52,475
Well, maybe it was my fault.

639
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,560
I suppose
I must have sounded pretty smug.

640
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:56,562
Honestly, Keith,
the way you put it to me.

641
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:59,065
I behaved like a bloody fool.
I don't know what came over me.

642
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:01,317
Then what's the matter?

643
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:04,737
- Janet, it isn't that.
- What?

644
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,075
Well, after we quarreled,
I was feeling pretty fed up.

645
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:10,910
I went to a club.

646
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,746
You know that girl I told you about,
from Austria?

647
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:14,872
The blonde?

648
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:17,917
I'm sorry, Janet.
I'll never see her again.

649
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,753
Keith, you didn't...

650
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:25,716
Oh, Keith. Why did you have to tell me?

651
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,554
Oh, I suppose you were right.

652
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:30,930
I'd have been much unhappier

653
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:34,100
if you’d simply gone on
as if nothing had happened.

654
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:37,186
I must dash now.
Shall we go out tonight?

655
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,272
Yes, let's. Where?

656
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:41,941
Let's go to the pictures.

657
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:44,694
We'll go and see a sad film
and have a good cry.

658
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:46,195
- Fine.
- Bye.

659
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:58,457
Eva, I just don't know what to say!

660
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:02,295
Oh, I'll have to tell my husband.

661
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,255
Well, obviously we'll all
have to go to the doctor

662
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:06,465
first thing in the morning.

663
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:09,302
I did warn you.

664
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:12,972
If only you'd paid
the slightest attention to what I said.

665
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:17,476
- I'm sorry, Mrs Millar.
- It's a fine time to say you're sorry.

666
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,770
When I think of Nicholas...

667
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:22,899
Oh, it's all so loathsome.

668
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:26,569
I didn't know.
I didn't think I was harming anyone.

669
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,494
Oh, now come on, Eva.

670
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:39,832
At least you had the courage
to tell me straight out.

671
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:44,420
And you said they said at the clinic
that it wasn't very likely that...

672
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,634
There's your family to think about.

673
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:16,452
- Hello, Keith. Will you come in?
- Hello.

674
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:18,871
All right. Just to say hello.

675
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:26,295
You thought you were in for
a rough time with Dad, didn't you?

676
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,838
They've gone out for the evening.

677
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:30,049
Oh, well, that's a relief.

678
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:34,637
Fine way to start an evening.

679
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:38,140
Oh, I've got some new records.
You must hear them.

680
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,142
But if we’re going to the pictures...

681
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:44,230
Oh, let's not rush off to the pictures.
I haven't seen you for ages.

682
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:45,398
I'll fix us some supper.

683
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:49,735
That's if you could make do with
scrambled eggs or baked beans on toast.

684
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:50,903
Anything.

685
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:52,571
Then have a drink
while we make the big decision.

686
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:55,241
- Dad's got some beer on the ice.
- Beer's fine.

687
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:57,243
Difficult, aren't you?

688
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:00,246
Sorry, I'm on my best behaviour tonight.

689
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:03,749
If I'm gonna slave over a hot stove
for you, I'll just run up and change.

690
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,918
The beer's in the fridge. Help yourself.

691
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:07,086
Okay.

692
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,303
Janet?

693
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:03,976
Jan?

694
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,483
Are you there?

695
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:20,951
Janet.

696
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:26,665
You don't have to do that.

697
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:29,418
I want to.

698
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:40,179
I was wrong.
Everything you said was right.

699
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:44,100
- I nearly lost you.
- You never lost me.

700
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:46,352
I always wanted you.

701
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:49,522
- Even...
- And I want your children.

702
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,166
Keith, the lights.

703
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,561
Darling.

704
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:13,772
We must be careful. If I'd have known...

705
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,108
Darling, I knew.

706
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:25,242
Yeah, she gave me that form
a fortnight ago.

707
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:26,785
But I knew there was nothing
to worry about.

708
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:28,078
Oh, how?

709
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:29,788
Well, you see, I work in a library.

710
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:32,291
I looked it up in a medical dictionary.

711
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:33,542
I see.

712
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,628
Well, I knew I needn't worry.

713
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,713
After all, we didn't sleep together.

714
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:39,965
And if we did, I'd have taken
the necessary precautions.

715
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,134
I'm sorry to tell you that if you
have intercourse with a woman

716
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:46,138
suffering from venereal disease,
no precautions are safe.

717
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:49,391
Well, then, like I said,
that question don't arise.

718
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,644
But there was sexual contact?

719
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:54,104
If you can call it that.
You know how it is.

720
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:56,065
I petted her a bit. Kissed her.

721
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:58,651
- On the mouth?
- Yeah.

722
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:00,319
Then what decided you to come here?

723
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:02,154
Well, now that you mention it.

724
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,907
It was a sore I've got
just inside my mouth here.

725
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:06,450
Well, I mean nothing much.

726
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,160
But me neck's swollen a bit there.

727
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:10,496
Thought I might as well
come for a check.

728
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:13,415
- Let me see, please.
- Can't do any harm.

729
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,460
Open your mouth. Wider.

730
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,172
Hmm.

731
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,176
I'll be giving you
a thorough examination next door,

732
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:28,764
but unless I'm very mistaken,
that's a syphilitic sore on your lip.

733
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:31,517
She was so young and inexperienced.

734
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:35,479
Of course, I won't be seeing her again.
Won't catch me with that kind of girl.

735
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:43,612
Hello, Eva.
So you finished the course now?

736
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,823
Yes, I just had my last injection.

737
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:48,200
Sister told me to come back
in a month for a check.

738
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:50,202
You're staying as long as that?

739
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:51,787
The Millars are so kind.

740
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:54,331
At first they said I was to go home

741
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:56,166
after the injections, then...

742
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:59,336
They found they couldn't manage
without you.

743
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:02,881
How's the little boy?
How old did you say he was?

744
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:04,550
Half past three.

745
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:07,052
Half past...
Oh, you mean three and a half.

746
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:09,722
- My English.
- And he's well?

747
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:12,683
Yes, they are all well.
It was a false alarm.

748
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,727
Well, that's a relief.

749
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:16,812
Oh, by the way, I understand that

750
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:19,231
one of your friends has reported here
for treatment.

751
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:21,650
You did send off that letter?

752
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,694
To Elliot? Yes, the same afternoon.

753
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:25,863
By registered post like you said.

754
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:27,865
It's over a fortnight,
he ought to have had it,

755
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:30,492
or the post office
would have sent it back to you.

756
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:32,703
Well, in view of what he attempted
to do to you,

757
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:35,998
he's probably gone
for treatment elsewhere.

758
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,084
I tried to find...

759
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,587
I tried to find Keith.

760
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:44,048
I went to the club each evening.

761
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:46,091
I see. And he hasn't turned up?

762
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:48,093
- Or phoned you?
- Nothing.

763
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:49,678
I wish I could warn him.

764
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:52,598
I have no way.
I don't know his full name, anything.

765
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:54,850
Except that he's wonderful.

766
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:56,435
Well, don't worry too much.

767
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:59,438
Of course, if he does get in touch
with you... He sounds sensible.

768
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:03,567
If he has the infection,
he's probably seen a doctor.

769
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:12,117
I haven't walked so far for ages.

770
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,911
- Oh, it's been lovely, though.
- Yes.

771
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:16,872
I must put them in water
when I get back.

772
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:23,128
- Don't shut the lid, you'll kill them.
- They'll be all right.

773
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:25,881
- Keith?
- Yes.

774
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:28,425
I've been trying to tell you
all afternoon.

775
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:30,094
What is it?

776
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:31,970
Just...

777
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:34,640
I'm going to have a baby.

778
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:35,974
Are you sure? I mean sometimes...

779
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:37,893
Three months ago now, I missed twice.

780
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:40,604
And then I went to the doctor last week
and he sent me for a test.

781
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:41,939
I see.

782
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:43,982
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

783
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:47,319
There was nothing you could do,
you'd only have worried.

784
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:49,905
We both knew it was a risk,
but some people try for months with...

785
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:51,448
I don't regret it, do you?

786
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:54,910
Of course not. If you love someone,
you want their children.

787
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:57,329
Don't you see?
It was the only possible way

788
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,581
for us to get married,
with dad feeling like he did.

789
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:02,501
- Have you told them?
- Not yet.

790
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:05,254
We'll see them together
and get it over with.

791
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:08,424
Your father will be after me
with a shotgun.

792
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:14,430
- Please, take me home.
- I'm sorry, Janet, that wasn't funny.

793
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:17,266
I know I've been unfair to you.

794
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:19,768
After all you said to me about waiting.

795
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:22,479
I thought about it, night after night.

796
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:24,148
It just didn't seem any other way out.

797
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:27,860
I don't blame you.
If anyone's to blame, it's myself.

798
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:31,363
Don't worry, darling.
We'll see it through.

799
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:33,866
There's no point in putting it off.

800
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:35,826
- Will your father be in now?
- No, Keith, let me tell him

801
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:38,704
I forced this on you. I can see it now.

802
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:47,546
From now on I'll do the worrying.

803
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:54,678
Hello, may I speak
to Miss Koenig, please?

804
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:55,888
Please.

805
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:58,223
It's you. Quite a time.

806
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:01,185
You led me a regular dance, didn't you?

807
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:03,979
Never mind.
We won't say anything more about that.

808
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:06,690
I've been along for my medicine,
like a good boy.

809
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,150
I don't want to speak to you.

810
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:10,819
Mr Millar says you're not to ring.

811
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:15,032
You haven't been telling stories,
have you? Not to the police?

812
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:17,576
I didn't tell the police
anything about you.

813
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:19,411
There's a sensible girl.

814
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,914
I don't want to talk to you.
I'm going back to Austria

815
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,917
I ran into your boyfriend the other day.

816
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:27,878
Haven't been seeing him, have you?

817
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:29,755
- Hello?
- You mean Keith?

818
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:32,591
Yes, that's right, Keith Murray.
Small world, isn't it?

819
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:36,220
I told you I was in advertising.
We handle his fathers account.

820
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:37,763
Murray Construction.

821
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:40,599
I bumped into him at their offices.

822
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,267
With his fiancée.

823
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:45,604
- His fiancée?
- Yes, I thought you'd be interested.

824
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:47,731
Now, look, Eva, about us...

825
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:14,132
Keith.

826
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:20,472
I thought you were not coming.

827
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:22,558
Eva, what can I say?

828
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:24,476
I behaved very badly.

829
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:27,312
I should have rung you or something.

830
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:30,440
- How did you find my number?
- It doesn't matter.

831
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:33,610
Keith, I couldn't tell you
on the telephone.

832
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:35,988
Eva, what is it?

833
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:39,491
They told me to give it to you at once.

834
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:41,660
I didn't know how to find you.

835
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:43,829
I thought you would ring me.

836
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:46,164
"Kensington Hospital."

837
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:48,166
I don't get it.

838
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,085
They want you to go.

839
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:51,962
There's a special clinic.

840
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:54,172
They'll explain to you.

841
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:57,801
You see, there was someone else
and he was sick.

842
00:59:57,844 --> 01:00:00,345
I didn't know about such things.

843
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:05,267
You know, the notices in toilets.

844
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:09,104
Oh, my God!

845
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:16,361
They give you injection.
Make you better soon.

846
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:18,864
There's no need for anyone to know.

847
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:20,616
No.

848
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:23,035
I didn't tell you I'm engaged.

849
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:25,329
I heard. A friend told me.

850
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:29,207
What you don't know is, she's pregnant.

851
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:56,943
- Oh, hello, Keith.
- Hello, Ruth.

852
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,445
- Have you come to see Roger?
- Yes.

853
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:00,072
- Well, come in, then.
- Thank you.

854
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:02,282
Hello, Tracy.

855
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:04,743
Haven't seen you for ages.

856
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:07,287
- You know, exams and everything.
- I have to congratulate you.

857
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:09,748
We read the announcement
in the local rag last week.

858
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:11,291
- Thanks.
- We met her, remember?

859
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:13,085
You're a very lucky young man.

860
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:17,255
Oh, that damn telephone.
The secretary is away this afternoon.

861
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:20,634
- Roger won't be too long.
- Don't worry about me.

862
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:35,065
- Hello, Keith. Nice to see you.
- Hello, Roger.

863
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:37,275
- Come on through.
- Thanks.

864
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:43,323
I was delighted to hear about
the engagement, Keith. Really delighted.

865
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:45,117
Roger, I think I'm in a hell of a mess.

866
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:47,119
Oh, what kind of mess?

867
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:50,580
I've just been handed this.

868
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:52,124
I see.

869
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:54,126
Well, suppose you tell me all about it.

870
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:56,169
I don't want you to think
I've been sleeping around.

871
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:57,462
Especially now.

872
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:59,256
It only happened once and

873
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:01,800
there were reasons for that.
Yes, I'm sure.

874
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:04,261
Look, I'll go to the clinic
if you think I should.

875
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:07,180
But I just wondered if there was
some way of checking privately.

876
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:11,143
Tell me, have you noticed any rash,
any spots on your genitals?

877
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:12,436
No, nothing.

878
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:14,354
Well, first of all
I'll give you an examination

879
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:18,024
and then I'll arrange for a blood test.
Hugh Price can do that for us.

880
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:20,152
If it should prove to be positive

881
01:02:20,194 --> 01:02:22,988
I could, of course,
arrange to treat you privately.

882
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:25,866
But my advice would be to
take advantage of the clinic.

883
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:28,869
Anyway, lets get on
with the examination.

884
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:36,376
Hello?

885
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:39,337
Eva?

886
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:41,381
Are you alone?

887
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:44,509
Oh, it's you.

888
01:02:55,521 --> 01:02:59,024
Elliot, stop it.
I won't listen, I won't!

889
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:03,320
What on earth's the matter with Eva?

890
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:06,031
Another of those obscene phone calls.

891
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:08,366
- Becoming a real menace.
- Him again.

892
01:03:08,409 --> 01:03:10,327
He's got Eva really scared.

893
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:13,163
The man seems to have
some kind of obsession about her.

894
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:15,081
Well, we've got to do
something about this.

895
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:17,083
Do you think you could persuade her
to go to the police?

896
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:20,086
It would've saved a lot of trouble
if she had done it before.

897
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:23,381
Well, it's asking an awful lot
of the girl in her present state.

898
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:25,050
But I'll try.

899
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:29,095
Eva.

900
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:45,904
Oh, Miss Koenig.

901
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:48,073
I believe you have
some further information for us.

902
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:49,407
I was so frightened.

903
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:51,076
- I couldn't tell you.
- You think you could identify

904
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:53,203
the man who assaulted you?

905
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:54,704
I know him.

906
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:56,915
Why didn't you tell us this before?

907
01:03:57,041 --> 01:03:59,251
It was some months ago now.

908
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:02,796
- What made you change your mind?
- Because he keeps phoning me.

909
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:04,422
It's not only myself, the Millars...

910
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:07,384
These telephone calls, are they abusive?

911
01:04:07,468 --> 01:04:09,427
Does he threaten you?

912
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:11,429
He says such terrible things,

913
01:04:11,472 --> 01:04:12,764
what he'll do to me.

914
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:15,892
Improper use of the telephone
is an offence.

915
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:18,144
There's no need to be frightened,
now that you've come to us.

916
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:20,230
Can I have his name, please?

917
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:22,440
Collier. Elliot Collier.

918
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:24,442
And do you know where he lives?

919
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:25,944
Yes, he has a flat.

920
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:29,239
Number 11, Alban Court,
in the King's Road.

921
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:31,783
Well, that's not too far away.

922
01:04:33,786 --> 01:04:36,288
We'll soon put a stop to this.

923
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:38,498
Sergeant Davis, please.

924
01:04:50,803 --> 01:04:53,430
Collier left that address
rather hurriedly, some weeks ago.

925
01:04:53,472 --> 01:04:55,974
The day after the incident in the mews,
I expect.

926
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:57,309
We shall have to get
the Millars' permission

927
01:04:57,435 --> 01:04:59,686
- to have their telephone monitored.
- Please?

928
01:04:59,812 --> 01:05:02,522
Oh, it means that if anyone rings up,
we'll be listening.

929
01:05:02,648 --> 01:05:05,609
And the next time Collier rings you,
keep him talking.

930
01:05:05,651 --> 01:05:07,485
But you needn't listen
to what he has to say.

931
01:05:07,528 --> 01:05:08,862
Just let him talk.

932
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:11,031
We need time for what we've got to do.

933
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:13,617
So at all costs, you must keep him
on the other end.

934
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:15,493
It may not be very pleasant.

935
01:05:15,536 --> 01:05:17,162
Will you do it?

936
01:05:18,122 --> 01:05:19,664
Yes, I will.

937
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:23,960
What I don't understand is how
I could've caught this without knowing?

938
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:25,337
You were unlucky.

939
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:26,963
There's usually a sore on the genitals,

940
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:28,506
but sometimes
it's no more than a pimple.

941
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:30,300
It doesn't hurt and it soon disappears.

942
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:31,843
Doesn't that mean it's cured?

943
01:05:31,969 --> 01:05:34,679
No, it means that the infection has
entered on a more serious stage.

944
01:05:34,805 --> 01:05:36,681
No one can be cured
of syphilis or gonorrhea

945
01:05:36,807 --> 01:05:39,059
without professional medical treatment.

946
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:41,353
It never crossed my mind.

947
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:43,480
It rarely does.

948
01:05:43,522 --> 01:05:46,858
Anyone who indulges in, shall we say,
casual intercourse,

949
01:05:46,984 --> 01:05:49,319
would be well-advised to come in
for a regular check.

950
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:52,364
Especially if they’re
thinking of marriage.

951
01:05:52,531 --> 01:05:54,699
I'll give it to her today.

952
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:57,035
- I don't know how I'm going to tell her.
- Well, if you'll go back

953
01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:59,704
to waiting room now,
there are some further tests to be made.

954
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:01,539
- Doctor.
- Yes?

955
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:03,333
She'll be all right?

956
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:06,544
Oh, I see no reason why not,
provided she reports promptly.

957
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:08,713
After all, we don't know
that you infected her.

958
01:06:08,839 --> 01:06:10,382
And the baby?

959
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:12,258
You say she's rather more than
two months pregnant?

960
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:14,552
Oh, the baby, too,
if we see her in time.

961
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:16,388
- Can I tell her that?
- You can.

962
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:18,848
But send her here soon,
that's the important thing.

963
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:20,558
Thank you, sir.

964
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:25,563
Yes?

965
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:29,401
- Am I disturbing you, Doctor?
- No, Sister, come in.

966
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:33,238
Makes you think.
That young fellow I just saw,

967
01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:34,864
decent, well-educated young boy,

968
01:06:34,907 --> 01:06:37,409
and he risks his marriage
through crass ignorance.

969
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:39,953
That, and a lack of moral sense.

970
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:42,747
Like you, I'd blame the parents
as much as anybody.

971
01:06:42,873 --> 01:06:45,250
Young people should be told,
and told early.

972
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:49,254
There's a lot I'd like to tell these
young things who come sailing in here.

973
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:51,965
It's so often a matter of ignorance.

974
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:57,554
These latest figures. 140,000 new cases
a year, and most of them young people.

975
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:00,140
They should know what happens
when syphilis goes untreated.

976
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:04,436
Heart disease, paralysis with blindness,
insanity, stillbirths.

977
01:07:05,229 --> 01:07:09,441
And with gonorrhea, sterility
in women and children born blind.

978
01:07:09,942 --> 01:07:12,402
Mild enough diseases at the start.

979
01:07:12,903 --> 01:07:15,780
But over the years
they take a terrible toll.

980
01:07:28,252 --> 01:07:32,297
Listen, down the slope and past the hut.

981
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:35,633
I'll come with you if you like.

982
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,969
No. No, thank you.

983
01:07:40,931 --> 01:07:43,016
Well, you'll see the notice,
"Special Clinic".

984
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:45,643
Thanks. It's a great help.

985
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,979
Janet, please don't take it like this.

986
01:07:48,105 --> 01:07:50,648
I've never been to a doctor
to tell him I'm an unmarried mother

987
01:07:50,691 --> 01:07:52,650
and that the man
who got me pregnant has VD.

988
01:07:52,693 --> 01:07:54,027
I know.

989
01:07:54,445 --> 01:07:57,447
- But we're over the worst.
- Are we?

990
01:07:57,490 --> 01:08:00,950
You say it can't hurt the child
but I've read about cases.

991
01:08:00,993 --> 01:08:03,828
Have you ever seen a mentally
deficient child? Because I have.

992
01:08:03,954 --> 01:08:06,790
Janet, the doctor told me
it'll be all right.

993
01:08:06,832 --> 01:08:10,376
This just doesn't happen to people
who respect their own bodies.

994
01:08:10,961 --> 01:08:14,672
I feel so cheap, like a common tart.

995
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:17,383
We're over the worst of it.

996
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:19,511
Will you stop saying
we're over the worse of it!

997
01:08:19,553 --> 01:08:22,222
I mean, we've told your parents
about having the baby.

998
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:24,849
There's no need for them to know
anything about this.

999
01:08:24,975 --> 01:08:26,851
It doesn't make it any better
by hiding it.

1000
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:28,353
You haven't told them?

1001
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:30,230
No, I haven't.

1002
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:33,399
It doesn't make me feel any better.

1003
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:34,901
Look.

1004
01:08:36,028 --> 01:08:37,862
As soon as we're both in the clear,

1005
01:08:37,988 --> 01:08:40,907
I'm going straight
to the registry office

1006
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:43,743
to arrange about getting married.

1007
01:08:44,161 --> 01:08:45,537
Just a few weeks now.

1008
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:47,539
No, you're not, Keith.

1009
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:52,085
There isn't going to be a marriage.

1010
01:09:16,777 --> 01:09:19,571
Eva, I think you'd better answer that.

1011
01:09:23,617 --> 01:09:24,742
Hello?

1012
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:27,245
This is you-know-who.

1013
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:32,292
Now, you listen to me.

1014
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:35,587
Is someone there? I can hear music.

1015
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:38,756
I was listening to the records.

1016
01:09:39,925 --> 01:09:43,428
Eva, are you still there?
Don't hang up on me.

1017
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:45,889
Yes, I'm still here.

1018
01:09:45,931 --> 01:09:47,432
Yes, I heard you, Elliot.

1019
01:10:01,113 --> 01:10:03,990
Women Police. Sergeant Carnall speaking.

1020
01:10:05,075 --> 01:10:06,492
Oh, you have.

1021
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:08,620
He's on the line now?

1022
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:10,788
Have you traced the call?

1023
01:10:10,831 --> 01:10:11,915
Yes, of course I'll wait.

1024
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:26,179
Call box, Chelsea Manor Street,
Embankment Inn.

1025
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:28,139
Thanks a lot. I'll pass it on.

1026
01:10:47,785 --> 01:10:50,870
I've done nothing wrong!
Let me go!

1027
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,210
You can't do this to me!

1028
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:25,697
Hey, Max, remind you of someone?

1029
01:11:29,201 --> 01:11:32,704
- Should it?
- Well, it could be, couldn't it?

1030
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:36,582
Hey, that girl really did
something to you, didn't she?

1031
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:39,043
She taught me one thing.
No mucking about from now on.

1032
01:11:39,086 --> 01:11:41,004
The next girl I go out with
is going to be steady.

1033
01:11:41,046 --> 01:11:42,714
And when I get married
she's got to be a virgin.

1034
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,549
Oh, come on,
don't take it so much to heart.

1035
01:11:44,675 --> 01:11:45,883
Oh, look, let's go.
We got to get cracking

1036
01:11:45,926 --> 01:11:47,010
if we’re gonna get rid of this lot.

1037
01:11:49,513 --> 01:11:51,222
- Miss Bates?
- Yes?

1038
01:11:51,348 --> 01:11:52,932
You don't know me, but...

1039
01:11:53,058 --> 01:11:54,934
Did Keith send you?

1040
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:58,396
No. No, he had nothing to do with it.

1041
01:12:00,941 --> 01:12:02,942
Oh, well, come in then.

1042
01:12:03,068 --> 01:12:04,569
Thank you.

1043
01:12:12,536 --> 01:12:14,746
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.

1044
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:17,749
I'm leaving for home tomorrow.

1045
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:19,751
- You're going back?
- Yes.

1046
01:12:19,793 --> 01:12:22,253
I wanted to see you and say I was sorry.

1047
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:25,089
Oh, it was his fault more than yours.

1048
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:28,051
I didn't know
that he was engaged to you.

1049
01:12:28,093 --> 01:12:30,053
We weren't engaged then.

1050
01:12:30,095 --> 01:12:33,056
It was just something
that was understood.

1051
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:36,142
Will it be all right? About the baby?

1052
01:12:36,268 --> 01:12:37,977
Well, I'll have to go back
for observation

1053
01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:40,605
and I'll be making blood tests
for a long time.

1054
01:12:40,647 --> 01:12:42,774
Well, you must know yourself.

1055
01:12:42,816 --> 01:12:45,610
- They say I'm all right.
- I'm so happy.

1056
01:12:48,113 --> 01:12:50,323
Have you seen Keith lately?

1057
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:53,076
I phoned to say I was going home.

1058
01:12:53,118 --> 01:12:55,912
He would like to see you. He's so upset.

1059
01:12:55,954 --> 01:12:57,455
He's upset?

1060
01:12:58,248 --> 01:13:00,583
If he would like to see me...

1061
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:03,127
Oh, why are men so stupid?

1062
01:13:15,766 --> 01:13:17,016
Janet!

1063
01:13:17,267 --> 01:13:19,936
- Oh, hello.
- We must talk.

1064
01:13:19,978 --> 01:13:23,147
Eva rang me. She told me what you said.

1065
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,108
I mean, about the medical check.

1066
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:27,151
And I suppose that makes
everything all right.

1067
01:13:27,194 --> 01:13:29,821
Of course it doesn't.
That's why I had to see you.

1068
01:13:29,863 --> 01:13:31,989
Look, I've spoken to my father.

1069
01:13:32,116 --> 01:13:35,034
The baby's my responsibility
as well as yours.

1070
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:37,161
I don't want any money from you
or your father,

1071
01:13:37,204 --> 01:13:40,164
- if that's what you're getting at.
- You must be realistic.

1072
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:42,125
We may not be millionaires,
but we'll manage.

1073
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:45,002
- He'll be brought up at home.
- And later on?

1074
01:13:45,045 --> 01:13:47,547
I mean, you've got to face it,
your father isn't so young.

1075
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:51,509
I'll get myself a job
as soon as I've finished at college.

1076
01:13:51,552 --> 01:13:53,344
I'm not as helpless
as you seem to think.

1077
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:56,389
I never thought
you were helpless, Janet.

1078
01:13:56,723 --> 01:13:59,684
That wasn't why I asked you to marry me.

1079
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,563
What will you call him?

1080
01:14:04,064 --> 01:14:06,691
You seem to think it'll be a him.

1081
01:14:07,151 --> 01:14:09,318
Keith, that isn't fair.

1082
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:12,655
- I do have my feelings.
- So do I.

1083
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:15,366
And you're not giving me a chance,
Janet.

1084
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:17,326
Look, maybe you'll marry somebody else.

1085
01:14:17,369 --> 01:14:19,203
But the baby needs a father.

1086
01:14:19,329 --> 01:14:21,664
I'll never marry anybody else.

1087
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:24,250
How could you be so cruel?

1088
01:14:24,376 --> 01:14:29,046
All this talk about money. Can't you see
it's not your money I want, it's you.

1089
01:14:29,089 --> 01:14:30,256
You said...

1090
01:14:30,382 --> 01:14:34,552
You shouldn't listen to what I say,
you ought to know how I feel.

1091
01:14:37,181 --> 01:14:38,890
Silly.

1092
01:14:41,018 --> 01:14:44,061
Well, if we're going to be unhappy,
we'd better be unhappy together,
