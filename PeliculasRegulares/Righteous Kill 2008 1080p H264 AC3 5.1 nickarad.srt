1
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:22,503
One

2
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:23,971
between the eyes!

3
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:26,140
Two

4
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,313
between the eyes.

5
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:59,081
- Out!
- What?

6
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,378
- She was safe.
- She was out.

7
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,392
She landed right there.
She's safe.

8
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:10,651
Come on.

9
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:13,354
That's enough.
I don't want to hear another word.

10
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:15,698
- You're gone!
- Yeah, I'm gone.

11
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,236
My grandmother used to take me
to Washington Square Park...

12
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:30,504
to watch Bobby Fischer
play 10 games at the same time.

13
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,606
Queen me.

14
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:35,621
He was five-six moves ahead
on each table.

15
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:39,079
Anyway, he became
the world champ, didn't he?

16
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,184
Then he lost his fucking mind.

17
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:47,121
He became a raving paranoid.

18
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:48,889
Being attacked
from all directions,

19
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:50,994
he couldn't see
what was in front of him.

20
00:02:58,112 --> 00:03:00,307
Mate. Mate!

21
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:33,167
My name is David Fisk,

22
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:35,408
Detective First Grade.

23
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:39,484
I've been a cop in the NYPD
for over 30 years.

24
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:43,153
In that time...

25
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:47,226
I've killed 14 people.

26
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:51,120
Run that by me one more time.

27
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:54,655
I've killed 14 people.

28
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,396
He's nuts.

29
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:01,102
When did these things start?

30
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:07,373
How did they start?

31
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:15,751
Maybe this one started
with a guy named Charles Randall.

32
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:24,296
Randall was a child killer.

33
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:28,389
He killed his girlfriend's daughter

34
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:30,903
about four years ago.

35
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:34,264
Fuck you, damn asshole.

36
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,131
He was tried for the crime,

37
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:39,679
but was acquitted
by a jury of his peers.

38
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:57,322
My partner and I
found this unacceptable.

39
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:04,070
My partner is a good man.

40
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:27,648
Are you really
gonna do this thing?

41
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:29,716
Do what?

42
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:32,186
You're going to
take down Randall

43
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:34,427
for a homicide he didn't commit.

44
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:41,595
What am I gonna do?

45
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,630
You're my partner.

46
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,066
- You're my role model.
- Right.

47
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:48,137
What am I gonna do
without a role model?

48
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:54,308
We didn't have
this conversation.

49
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:56,879
What conversation?

50
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,772
It got done.

51
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:25,072
Randall lost his freedom

52
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:27,120
for the crime he didn't commit.

53
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:35,052
I lost my faith.

54
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,256
- I'm gonna go.
- Okay.

55
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:53,267
You can take this
as a confession if you want.

56
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:55,302
Whatever.

57
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:58,138
A few weeks ago
things heated up.

58
00:06:58,218 --> 00:06:59,940
What do we got on him, Turk?

59
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,378
Marcus Smith, AKA Spider...
big big dope deals,

60
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,847
murders, extortion,
lots of nice things.

61
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,216
He converted
this old abandoned bank

62
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:11,385
into Club 404 of Harlem.

63
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:13,053
Maybe when he sees us
he'll confess.

64
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,055
What, you don't believe
in miracles?

65
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:16,690
When you pick up a check
one day...

66
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,059
one day,
then I'll believe in miracles.

67
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:22,267
- Let's go. I'm buying.
- Yeah, that's a miracle I want to see.

68
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:41,048
This is where he launders
his money.

69
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:45,052
Oh, yeah,
cleaning green green green.

70
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,327
He's all business.

71
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,566
I gotta take a leak.

72
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,436
Oh, I'll just be a sec.

73
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:03,937
I'm not peeking.

74
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:06,417
No problem.

75
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:13,447
- You guys are so lucky.
- Why is that?

76
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:15,825
No line to the bathroom and...

77
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,953
You get to pee standing up.

78
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,822
Unzip, psss, zip.

79
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:24,124
Badda boom badda bing,
you're out of here.

80
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:28,562
Yeah, the big guy really outdid himself
on this thing.

81
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:29,963
You want a bump?

82
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:31,932
Where did you get that from?

83
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,446
Spider. Supremo.

84
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:44,838
Not bad.

85
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:48,141
Not bad?
What the fuck were you looking for?

86
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:50,577
Come on, Turk,

87
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,612
you pulled my hair.

88
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:55,849
Gee, my little sister used to
pull my hair harder than that.

89
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,123
Whatever.

90
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,394
I gotta go.

91
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:16,803
- Where the fuck are you going?
- I'm tired.

92
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:19,506
You're tired?
It's America, you whiny bitch.

93
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:22,375
Why don't you fucking get in the cab
and do some honest work?

94
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,278
Yeah, she's on her way.
She can't wait to see you.

95
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:28,623
Rambo the Skateboard Pimp
was my 10th kill.

96
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:34,421
Think of me as a street-sweeper.

97
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:36,556
I cleaned up this worthless
piece of shit

98
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,662
and left an obituary of sorts.
It rhymes.

99
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:50,871
Rooster, we gotta find out
who did this.

100
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:52,773
Give him a medal.

101
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:55,642
Hey, Rambo, you see
who did this?

102
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:57,644
He ain't talking, eh?

103
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:59,880
Real name Robert Brady.

104
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,915
Bobby Brady. Damn shame.

105
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,826
What are you thinking?
Marcia? Greg?

106
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,287
You guys messing up
my crime scene again?

107
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:09,456
You don't know
who Bobby Brady is?

108
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:11,491
Yeah, we met about an hour ago.

109
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:14,294
- It looks like close range.
- From the stippling around the wound

110
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:15,962
I'd say two to three feet away.

111
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,732
We'll be fishing fragments
out of his brains.

112
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:20,834
- What?
- No, I just got that...

113
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:22,969
"Marcia? Greg?"
That's a good one, Rooster.

114
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,738
Well, that was quick.

115
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:26,649
Just trying to keep pace with you.

116
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:33,914
"He trades in sin,
distributes flesh."

117
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:36,316
He picks the fruit
when it is fresh.

118
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:39,486
Now someone else
must slap his whore.

119
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:44,299
"His heart has stopped.
He breathes no more."

120
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,161
What do you want to do
about this?

121
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,997
I say let's make the best of it,

122
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:54,167
canvass the hookers.
Maybe we'll meet one you like.

123
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:57,838
Please. I got all I can handle
from you-know-who.

124
00:11:57,918 --> 00:11:59,673
No shit?

125
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:02,809
She's got my sperm level so low
I gotta sit down to take a piss.

126
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,511
Oh, thanks for that picture.

127
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:06,813
Hey, what can I tell you?

128
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,616
How can I help you, gentlemen?

129
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:11,685
We'd like to talk to you
about your boss.

130
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:13,987
He's upstairs.

131
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,399
No, your other boss.

132
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,162
Rambo.

133
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,130
He is asshole.

134
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,334
Why "he is asshole"?

135
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,814
Follow me, please.

136
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,176
You know anybody
who'd want to kill him?

137
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,878
Me.

138
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,212
Anyone else?

139
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,283
Why? He's dead?

140
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:45,518
Hey, listen, you want to smarten up
and help us out

141
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,254
or am I gonna have to call
somebody at ICE

142
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:49,055
and have you on the next plane
to kielbasa-land?

143
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:50,924
Go ahead.

144
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:52,859
I am American citizen.

145
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,961
Yeah.

146
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,063
Lick my balls anytime.

147
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,698
What?

148
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,734
Call us anytime, you know,

149
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:03,214
if you hear something, anything.

150
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:08,375
I think we're looking
for a guy named Sam the Butcher.

151
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,877
Who?

152
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,179
Nah, he's kidding around.
But seriously, Lieutenant,

153
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,248
how far do you want us to go
with this Rambo murder?

154
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:17,751
I don't know, I was thinking maybe
you could investigate it a bit more,

155
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:20,186
figure out who did it,
try to put him in jail.

156
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:23,089
That is, if it doesn't get in the way
of your shuffleboard lessons.

157
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,658
Yeah, no problem.

158
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:27,560
We're also working this dealer Spider
who's tied to these two stiffs

159
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,937
we found on Fresh Kills.

160
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:35,101
If we can nail him, who knows
how far up the ladder it will lead?

161
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,269
So what about it?

162
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:38,004
I popped this lawyer
with an ounce of blow.

163
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:40,407
She practically shoved it up my nose.
I got her to flip on him.

164
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,108
Lucky fuck, eh?

165
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:43,777
She scored it from him directly?

166
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:46,112
- Yeah, she did.
- Good.

167
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:49,849
Okay, well, get what you can out of her
and kick her loose.

168
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,365
I hate trying to prosecute
fucking lawyers.

169
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:03,296
- This isn't Spider's club.
- The back way in.

170
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:07,367
Yeah, it's an abandoned
linen factory, Jessica.

171
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:10,337
I guess I'm not your average...

172
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:11,871
what do you call it?

173
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,907
- Rat?
- Stoolie?

174
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:15,942
Thanks.

175
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:19,679
I mean, I think usually
it's some poor African-American kid

176
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:21,948
or a junkie or a prostitute.

177
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,551
Well, normally 200-grand-a-year
corporate lawyers

178
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:27,520
are much smarter than your average
African-American junkie whore...

179
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,190
normally, but sometimes
they only think they are.

180
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:33,093
It's all set on this end.

181
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:34,794
Are you guys sure
it's safe in there?

182
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,897
You tell your girlfriend
to grow a pair and let's go.

183
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:41,001
What do you say, Counsel?
Are you ready to do this thing?

184
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:43,703
Yeah, let's get it over with.

185
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:46,706
Okay, remember what we said?
You go in there,

186
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:50,143
you wait for him to ask you
for what you need, right?

187
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,812
And then you don't come back here
with less than four ounces.

188
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,314
- Four ounces?
- Yeah.

189
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:57,017
Isn't that a lot? I, like, buy a couple
of balls at the club, that's it.

190
00:14:57,097 --> 00:15:00,020
You just say you're going skiing and
you need a week's worth of fresh powder.

191
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,432
Yeah, you tell him you're going
on vacation.

192
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:09,029
I do this thing
and my record's wiped clean?

193
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:10,363
As a whistle.

194
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:12,365
No one at my law firm will know
that I got busted, right?

195
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:13,969
It never happened.

196
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,337
Look, Counsel, we all know you
better than this.

197
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,973
You just do this, you stop
shoving that shit up your nose,

198
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:21,775
you go home, you get married,
you have kids,

199
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,517
you never come back here,
and that's that.

200
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,314
Yeah.

201
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:31,184
Everybody's in position.

202
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,732
- Okay, we're going.
- Yes, sir.

203
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,697
Let's push the signal back 50%.

204
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:41,694
Hey, Jessica.

205
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,241
Break a leg.

206
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:47,934
It's two flights down.

207
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:50,380
The door's on the left.
Ring the bell.

208
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,891
Hey, Stubby, why don't you
go and escort our company up here?

209
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,719
Go on, fat boy.

210
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,124
Get it on.

211
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:19,399
- Good afternoon.
- Hey, Spider.

212
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,935
- I'll be downstairs.
- All right.

213
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,003
- How are you?
- All right, baby,

214
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,406
just checking out this wizard shit
before I let my kids watch it.

215
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,908
- You seen this?
- No.

216
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,411
The guy is a stone dealer.
I let my little ones watch this...

217
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,713
they'll all turn out junkies.
You know what I'm saying?

218
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:35,248
He's got a point.

219
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,484
- You remember Underdog?
- What about him?

220
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:40,453
That fucking dog spawned
a generation of junkies.

221
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:44,324
So you converted the bank
into a club and a recording studio?

222
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:46,926
- Yeah. You like it?
- Yeah.

223
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,862
What are you talking about?

224
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:50,630
What did Underdog do
all the time?

225
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,365
He was always shining shoes

226
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,567
and whenever Sweet Polly Purebred
would call out to him,

227
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:56,569
his dog ears would pick it up
and he'd rescue her.

228
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:59,072
Yeah, but what did he do
when he needed his super strength?

229
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:01,274
He'd go to his ring, remember?

230
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,176
Pull out a pill, pop it.

231
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:06,713
Holy shit, you're right.
He was a little fucking speed freak.

232
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:08,081
So what's the business?

233
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:10,950
How about a QP?
You're good for a QP.

234
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,652
The fuck you want with QP?

235
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:15,321
I'm going skiing with friends,

236
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,924
a lot of friends.

237
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:20,393
- Where?
- Aspen, Colorado.

238
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:23,163
Shit. I'm sure you can
score one in Aspen.

239
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:25,234
Not your primo brand.

240
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:27,634
You ski?

241
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,169
Sure. My whole life.

242
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:32,338
Come on, I don't have all day.

243
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,707
Why don't you put down your jacket,
stay a little while?

244
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:35,942
What do you think?

245
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:37,544
Actually, I've got to run.

246
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:41,481
I have a major IPO
closing in an hour, so...

247
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:44,291
You know, stress will kill you.
You gotta chill out.

248
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:47,554
I'm as chill as I get.

249
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:49,625
What do you want to do?

250
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:55,372
You know, every once in a while...

251
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,566
one of you Upper East Side bitches
gets popped,

252
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:01,601
tries to to roll over
on a nigga like me.

253
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,774
You're scared now.

254
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:11,010
Looks like the cavalry
come to rescue you.

255
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,545
Can I help you, gentlemen?

256
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,013
Yeah, let us in, Spider.

257
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,249
I'm sorry, there's no one here
by that name.

258
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:19,230
- Let us in.
- We only want to talk to you.

259
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,835
See, I know how to look
and I know where to look.

260
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,745
Come to papa.

261
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,108
It always hurts the first time.

262
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,705
You all right?

263
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,540
Why wouldn't she be all right?
We're watching TV.

264
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,242
How the fuck is she gonna get hurt
watching TV?

265
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:44,877
She could have seen or heard
something that scared her.

266
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,813
- Like what?
- Like some big fucking mutt

267
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:48,381
shooting his bug fat
fucking mouth off.

268
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,284
Wasn't nobody here fitting that description
till a minute ago.

269
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:53,219
I'm gonna show you ugly,
you fucking mother...

270
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,722
- We've said enough.
- Oh, you wanna bring your wife up in here?

271
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,825
That's it. That's it.
Let's go. It's okay.

272
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:01,594
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

273
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:03,642
You want your wire back?

274
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,066
Firearm!

275
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,238
No, Stubby, no!

276
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:18,854
Get down.
Get the fuck down!

277
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,056
Come on.

278
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:32,934
The fat one's dead.

279
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:43,447
Well, that went well.

280
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:47,218
Oh, shit, you're bleeding.

281
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:51,277
3-4 squad, Central.
11-41, request ambulance.

282
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:54,113
I need EMS. Subject shot,
184th and St. Nicholas.

283
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,349
Really, I tried my best.

284
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:59,686
You're doing just fine, Counsel.
You're doing just fine. Just relax.

285
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:02,822
Hey, guys, if you ever
need a lawyer...

286
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:05,591
Yeah, okay.

287
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:08,139
You bet.

288
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:13,066
In good old days we used to

289
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:15,835
let the perp bleed out
and call off the ambulance.

290
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:17,804
- Calm calm calm.
- Fucking lowlife.

291
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,639
You made your point.
You made your point.

292
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,974
Tough little bitch, ain't you,
kicking a man while he's handcuffed?

293
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,510
Shut the fuck up,
you piece of shit.

294
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,179
You think I won't blow
your fucking head off?

295
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:27,980
I wouldn't think twice about it.

296
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,283
I'd go in there,
get the fat boy's gun,

297
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:34,026
come back here
and put two between your eyes.

298
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:40,793
Where's EMS?

299
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:44,030
This thing was a clusterfuck
to end all clusterfucks.

300
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,631
You got nothing.

301
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:47,633
How about felony murder?

302
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,169
No drugs, right?
So no predicate felony,

303
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,105
no conspiracy, no nothing.

304
00:20:52,185 --> 00:20:54,173
No felony. No felony.
I can't believe this.

305
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,942
No felony.
How do you spell felony?

306
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:59,312
Homicide, racketeering, drugs...
I mean, what are we talking about?

307
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:01,981
Hey, you're lucky
that white girl didn't die.

308
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:03,916
IAB is gonna interview
both of you

309
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:06,419
and do a preliminary report
over the next couple of weeks.

310
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:09,956
Now off the record
you actually didn't violate procedure

311
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:12,425
because the victim had a firearm
aimed at you,

312
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:14,694
so if you stick together
you should make it through this.

313
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,729
You'd better get
your story straight too,

314
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:19,599
'cause I'm not going back to Far Rockaway
because you two fucked up.

315
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,235
And you're gonna spend some couch time
with the rubber-gun squad.

316
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:26,072
And you'd better take this shrink seriously
or you'll be off active duty.

317
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:27,874
That fucking piece of shit
just walks.

318
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:29,751
Knock it off, Turk.

319
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:34,847
Relax, partner.
He's gonna get his.

320
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:37,417
Gentlemen, your questions.

321
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:39,852
- Who made the decision to enter?
- I did.

322
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:41,888
- Whose decision was it to enter?
- Mine.

323
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:44,223
Did you immediately identify yourselves
as police officers?

324
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,559
- Yes, we did.
- Did you immediately identify yourselves?

325
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:49,095
The informant's position
was becoming untenable.

326
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:51,397
- We were afraid she was in danger.
- Turns out you were right.

327
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,933
- No fucking kidding, nine-to-fiver.
- Excuse me, detective?

328
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:56,413
Are you finished with my client?

329
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:02,308
- They're like Lennon and McCartney.
- Not an inch of daylight between them.

330
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:03,576
What do you think?

331
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:04,911
Nothing there.

332
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:07,814
They endangered the informant.
We can't make them wrong on that.

333
00:22:07,894 --> 00:22:09,482
They saw a gun, they reacted.

334
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:11,284
They beat the fuck
out of the suspect,

335
00:22:11,364 --> 00:22:13,419
but he's not filing charges.

336
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,558
Let's see what the shrink says.

337
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:18,925
So what are we gonna
do now, doc?

338
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,160
Are we gonna find out
if I'm sane enough

339
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,930
to carry a gun, chase bad guys?

340
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,566
Okay, why did you become a cop?

341
00:22:26,646 --> 00:22:29,335
Well, it was New Year's Eve.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

342
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:33,272
I didn't have the same opportunities
you had, Dr. Prosky.

343
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,008
Where I come from
it was either a gun and a badge

344
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,910
or a hard hat and a hammer.

345
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,413
How do you feel
when you fire your weapon?

346
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:43,182
It's like dirty Harry said...
"There's nothing wrong

347
00:22:43,262 --> 00:22:45,852
with a little shooting as long as
the right people get shot."

348
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:47,820
And when the wrong people
get shot?

349
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,823
It sucks, but I'd rather be in it
that out of it.

350
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:52,959
There's nothing worse
than being stuck on a bench.

351
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,228
How do you feel when you see
innocent people get killed?

352
00:22:55,308 --> 00:22:57,538
You know...

353
00:22:59,312 --> 00:23:02,468
I sort of get numb to it.

354
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:05,171
Here.

355
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:06,706
I want you to take this.

356
00:23:06,786 --> 00:23:10,109
Use it to jot down your thoughts,
your questions,

357
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:12,645
anything you may have noticed
about yourself,

358
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,146
whatever.

359
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,015
I won't ask for it.

360
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:18,818
Just for you.

361
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,353
I want you to try it.

362
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:22,458
Sounds like fun.

363
00:23:24,337 --> 00:23:27,898
Harder.

364
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:43,919
Go, Turk, go!

365
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:48,314
You got third.
Go go!

366
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:51,050
Yeah!
Look at that.

367
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,452
You own it. You own it.

368
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:55,354
No matter what they say
about you,

369
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,527
you're tremendous!

370
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,937
Go go, Turk, go!

371
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,831
Safe.
You dropped the ball.

372
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:08,200
- A fucking cheap shot, man.
- Get away from the bag.

373
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,215
- Or what? Or what? Or what?
- Watch the bag.

374
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:25,251
The NYPD is bubbling
with frustration,

375
00:24:25,331 --> 00:24:26,886
hostility and testosterone,

376
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:28,921
ready to erupt at any moment.

377
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:30,990
Think of me
as the release valve.

378
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,859
One flick of the trigger
and the pressure goes down.

379
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:35,995
You know why you join the force?

380
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:38,130
To get respect.

381
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,899
Most people respect the badge.

382
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:42,311
Everybody respects the gun.

383
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:49,709
Hey, Riley, I was talking to Jo...

384
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:52,812
you guys caught a stiff named
Phillip Trager, a gun-runner?

385
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:55,081
Oh, yeah, a real piece of shit.

386
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:57,049
- How did that go down?
- I don't know.

387
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:59,352
Somebody gave him a taste
of his own medicine, I guess,

388
00:24:59,432 --> 00:25:01,787
walked right into his apartment,
killed him with one of his own guns.

389
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:04,090
Did the shooter leave a note
or anything?

390
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:07,139
Yeah, actually,
the shooter left a poem.

391
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:12,732
He did?
No shit.

392
00:25:12,812 --> 00:25:14,767
Yeah. Hey, Simon,

393
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:18,283
you remember that poem
from the Trager case?

394
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:22,308
What are you doing, man?

395
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:24,343
Turk's asking about it.

396
00:25:24,423 --> 00:25:26,891
What the hell are you doing?

397
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:31,283
No le digas mierda a eso loco.

398
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,954
Calmate. He wants to hear
about the poem.

399
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:37,223
"Merchant of thieving class,"

400
00:25:37,303 --> 00:25:40,393
I slit his throat
and capped his ass.

401
00:25:40,473 --> 00:25:41,894
I took his gun, I took his...

402
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:44,930
"I took his life, I took his gun,
But too bad he's not the only one."

403
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,033
That's how it goes,
something like that.

404
00:25:47,113 --> 00:25:49,368
It's not iambic pentameter,
but it rhymes.

405
00:25:49,448 --> 00:25:51,439
- Rooster.
- Yo.

406
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:54,306
We're looking for the same guy.

407
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,510
He knocked off a pimp named Rambo
a few weeks ago. When was yours?

408
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:00,079
Last week. We're running ours with the ATF
because of the guns.

409
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,182
We're back in business on the Rambo case.
Looks like the same guy knocked off

410
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:05,651
- a gun dealer on the three-three last week.
- No shit.

411
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:08,654
- What do you mean? That's our case.
- That's our case. You're taking our case.

412
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:11,157
Seniority, guys.
Tag along, you'll learn something.

413
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:13,359
Oh, tell me the guy's name
is Greg Brady.

414
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:15,361
Please. It is, isn't it?

415
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:17,963
Oh, somebody's knocking off
the Brady Bunch.

416
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:21,867
Gotta be the Partridge Family.

417
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:24,970
Trager,
a gun-runner bites the dust...

418
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,109
number 11.

419
00:26:35,494 --> 00:26:39,251
The bullet matched the.45
in Trager's apartment.

420
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:41,754
That was no surprise.
So I ran it through ATF.

421
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:44,824
It's one of a batch of six
that was stolen from a gun shop

422
00:26:44,904 --> 00:26:47,159
- in Virginia last month.
- Yeah, probably by Trager.

423
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:49,895
That's what they think.
He matches the description they have.

424
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:52,631
It still doesn't help us find the guy.
It just helps us tie him to the victims,

425
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:55,167
which he's already doing
with his little fucking poems.

426
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:58,270
Excuse me. Hello.

427
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,540
Hey, Turk, don't forget
we got a court date later.

428
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,744
So...

429
00:27:04,824 --> 00:27:08,414
I heard he kicked the shit
out of that dealer you guys took down.

430
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:10,282
Spider.

431
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:11,522
So?

432
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:15,690
Did he?

433
00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:21,127
Yeah, he got him
down on the ground.

434
00:27:21,207 --> 00:27:23,607
The guy was handcuffed.

435
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:27,666
And he just started
kicking him in the gut.

436
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:30,102
And then

437
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:32,471
he gets down on the guy's chest

438
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:35,841
and he really starts smacking him

439
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:38,811
hard in the face over and over

440
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:40,846
and screaming at the top
of his lungs,

441
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:43,149
"I'm gonna break
your fucking face,

442
00:27:43,229 --> 00:27:45,584
you little bitch!"

443
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,953
Then his eyes really started
to fill up.

444
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:49,989
I mean, they get dark...

445
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:52,230
you know how he gets
the sort of rage in him.

446
00:27:53,372 --> 00:27:56,034
I thought he was gonna
kill this guy.

447
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:59,877
Really?

448
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:04,981
You're a bad little girl.

449
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:09,979
- I got work to do.
- You bet.

450
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:15,314
Counselor,
my hands are tied here.

451
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:17,349
Without a secure
chain of custody,

452
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:20,119
any evidence obtained
after the initial search

453
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,621
- must be excluded.
- You gotta be fucking kidding me.

454
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,024
Therefore I am forced
to grant defense

455
00:28:25,104 --> 00:28:27,359
motion to dismiss all charges

456
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:29,595
of rape and assault
against Mr. Van Luytens.

457
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:31,630
- Your Honor.
- You think I want this guy

458
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,833
going anywhere near my daughter,

459
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:36,035
or anyone's daughter
for that matter?

460
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:38,537
You messed up.
I am unleashing your client

461
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:40,840
unto the world.
I'm sure we'll all be

462
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,308
back here again very soon.

463
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:45,344
Look at him.
Look at this motherfucker.

464
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:48,981
Hey, it's gonna come back to you, mutt.
You're gonna get it.

465
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,450
- When you walk outside watch your back.
- Easy, Turk.

466
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,651
Order in my court.

467
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,955
- Okay, mutt? You fucking mutt.
- Not here, not now.

468
00:28:56,035 --> 00:28:58,424
Not here, not now.
Will you get him out of here

469
00:28:58,504 --> 00:29:01,026
before somebody passes a sentence
on him you can't appeal?

470
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:02,294
Order!

471
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:05,464
- You know what I mean? Go go.
- Order, detective.

472
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:09,468
Dr. Prosky suggested
that I free-associate.

473
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:11,904
So here I go.

474
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:14,573
You know what I think about
when I pull a trigger?

475
00:29:14,653 --> 00:29:17,543
I think about the Infield Fly Rule.

476
00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:20,613
I love that fucking rule.
It assumes the worst in everybody.

477
00:29:20,693 --> 00:29:24,350
It says, "Sorry, batter, you're a schmuck
for popping up with runners on."

478
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,785
And you, stupid-ass infielder,
you don't get to cheat

479
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:29,255
"and drop the ball just because
you caught a break."

480
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:30,956
My favorite part...
the batter's out

481
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:33,158
but the runners advance
at their own risk.

482
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:35,461
Well, isn't this
a pleasant surprise?

483
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:37,596
That's the way life should be.

484
00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:39,667
You can be a motherfucker
at your own risk.

485
00:29:42,982 --> 00:29:46,772
Or not.
Van Luytens... one less rapist.

486
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:49,041
Who's gonna miss him?
Nobody.

487
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,282
Number 12 and counting.

488
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:07,393
Hot coffee.

489
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:09,128
- Good morning, Detective Riley.
- Hey, good morning.

490
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:11,130
- Door on your left.
- Any signs of forced entry?

491
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,865
Doesn't look like it.
Detective Perez is in there.

492
00:30:12,945 --> 00:30:14,300
He's in there already?
All right.

493
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,468
- Hey, how about those Mets last night?
- Yeah, how about 'em?

494
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,607
Hey, Teddy, Teddy, come here,
check this out.

495
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:22,341
Wow.

496
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:23,609
Fuck.

497
00:30:23,689 --> 00:30:26,445
- Oh my God.
- That's big.

498
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:28,480
And powerful.

499
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,383
- What, a plasma screen?
- LCD.

500
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:33,485
- That's plasma.
- No, it's got to be LCD.

501
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:35,821
- It wouldn't be that big.
- Hey, guys, guys.

502
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:39,291
He was shot at close range,
dropped right here.

503
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:42,094
The pussy doesn't look like he put up
much of a fight, does he, Karen?

504
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,196
Nothing to indicate that

505
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:47,766
in terms of struggle.
No forced entry, cuts, bruises.

506
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:51,036
Hey, nobody wants to hear
about your private life, Officer Corelli.

507
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:54,347
That's detective to you,
Officer Needledick.

508
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,644
- Looks like it's our guy again.
- Who did you get this time?

509
00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:00,346
This is Jonathan Van Luytens.

510
00:31:00,426 --> 00:31:02,314
He owns a couple
of car dealerships.

511
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:04,683
- Oh, shit.
- He was up on rape charges,

512
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:06,919
but they got tossed out
last week.

513
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:08,954
Look at this.

514
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:13,092
"A man devoid of all respect,
Of beauty, charm or intellect,"

515
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:15,561
He took what women
would not give.

516
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:17,529
"He didn't have
the right to live."

517
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:19,932
That's our boy all right.

518
00:31:20,012 --> 00:31:23,135
Looks like he had a beef
with our old pal Johnny.

519
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:24,269
You know him?

520
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,171
Yeah.

521
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:28,507
He's one slippery
son of a bitch, let me tell you.

522
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:31,210
Yeah.

523
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:34,380
You guys know how much
fun it is to not catch a serial killer?

524
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,148
You got a point here, Lieutenant?

525
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,950
The point is

526
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,119
you'd better both
think seriously

527
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:42,254
about whether or not
you want the lead on this case.

528
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:43,995
You don't think
we're up to this?

529
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:48,160
Come on, you got what,

530
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,896
about 110 years on the job
between the two of you?

531
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:53,999
120.

532
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,301
I'm telling you, you screw it up
badly enough,

533
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,537
they may try to fuck you
out of your pension.

534
00:31:58,617 --> 00:31:59,805
You want to risk that?

535
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:01,673
- Yeah.
- Fuck, yeah.

536
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:06,678
406, Lieutenant. 406.

537
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,314
Okay, 406...
what does that mean?

538
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:10,883
Ted Williams.

539
00:32:10,963 --> 00:32:13,986
Ted Williams, the last day of the season,
is batting 400.

540
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:17,122
Sox manager wants to bench him,
protect his average, right?

541
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:18,957
Williams plays
both games anyway,

542
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:20,959
goes six for eight,
ends up at 406...

543
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,694
the last guy that ever hit
over 400.

544
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,230
Okay, fine. It's all yours.

545
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:28,300
Just don't go moaning to me
when some traffic cop

546
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,636
pulls your serial killer over
for speeding

547
00:32:30,716 --> 00:32:33,305
and he grabs your
15 minutes of fame and you realize

548
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:36,508
the asshole could have been
standing right there in front of you

549
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:39,611
and it would have taken you
1000 light years to nail him.

550
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,380
Not for nothing, Lieutenant,

551
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,520
light years measures distance,
not time.

552
00:32:46,932 --> 00:32:49,354
Well, thank you, detective.
I'll make a note of that.

553
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:52,224
Ellis Lynde, 2003.

554
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:55,027
This guy had a history
of cruising gay bars,

555
00:32:55,107 --> 00:32:57,863
picking up twinkies,
beating the shit out of them.

556
00:32:57,943 --> 00:33:00,799
Lynde was found shot dead
in his apartment.

557
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:03,735
Whoever's doing this
gets up real close to the guys,

558
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,438
blows their brains out
without any trouble,

559
00:33:06,518 --> 00:33:07,973
leaves no fingerprints

560
00:33:08,053 --> 00:33:09,808
and obviously
takes pride in his work.

561
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:14,146
Okay, what could be
murder number two back from '04,

562
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:15,659
one Matthew Mitrella.

563
00:33:20,632 --> 00:33:22,721
I was shaking
the first couple of times

564
00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:25,591
I killed in cold blood.

565
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:28,961
I kept thinking if I got caught
they'd kick me off the force.

566
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:31,630
I wasn't worried about prison,
but losing the gun and the shield...

567
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,898
that scared me.

568
00:33:32,978 --> 00:33:35,434
I went into work the next day
expecting to feel different.

569
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:38,570
I thought everybody would look at me
the way cops look at civilians

570
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,880
and know which ones are dirty.

571
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,149
But they didn't.
That's when I knew

572
00:33:50,229 --> 00:33:52,823
I could keep on
doing this forever.

573
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:59,858
So next stop... Spider.

574
00:33:59,938 --> 00:34:01,894
If we shut down his business,

575
00:34:01,974 --> 00:34:03,929
maybe he'd be a rat.

576
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:05,964
We got a lawyer.

577
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:09,768
We needed her to testify
that she bought coke from him.

578
00:34:09,848 --> 00:34:12,371
She was a good lawyer.

579
00:34:12,451 --> 00:34:16,875
Me and my partner paid a visit
to Club 404 of Harlem.

580
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:18,043
A word about him...

581
00:34:18,123 --> 00:34:21,180
Tom Cowen's been my partner
for almost 30 years.

582
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,194
He's the best cop
I've ever seen.

583
00:34:25,097 --> 00:34:28,587
I'm always the one
following him through the door.

584
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:30,789
There's a bullet
that was meant for me

585
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:34,393
that's lodged in his torso.

586
00:34:34,473 --> 00:34:36,495
He was my role model.

587
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,897
The day I stopped
trying to be Tom Cowen

588
00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:41,445
was the greatest day of my life.

589
00:34:55,294 --> 00:34:58,250
Hey, Rooster,

590
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:01,320
I was going through the files
on poetry boy.

591
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,589
That's an interesting way
to pass your time.

592
00:35:03,669 --> 00:35:06,058
Okay, there was a gun

593
00:35:06,138 --> 00:35:08,260
found on Charles Randall
when he was arrested.

594
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,528
Yeah.

595
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:12,731
Now in all the other shootings
the gun was left at the scene,

596
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:15,934
but there are a lot of similarities.
So I mentioned it to Perez and Riley.

597
00:35:16,014 --> 00:35:18,036
I think somebody should go
interview him in prison.

598
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,706
I think there may be a connection.

599
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:24,209
That's a good idea,
but not Perez and Riley.

600
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,678
I mean, not those guys.
They'll screw it up.

601
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:28,847
This is too important.

602
00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:31,350
Turk and I will handle Randall, okay?

603
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,988
Good work.

604
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:06,795
Detectives, Charles Randall.

605
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:11,723
What the fuck
do you two scumbags want?

606
00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:14,459
What a greeting.

607
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:17,562
You like poetry, Chuck?

608
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:18,664
What?

609
00:36:18,744 --> 00:36:21,941
Do you like poetry?

610
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:26,638
Yeah.
Roses are red, violets are blue,

611
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:29,608
I want to poke out your fucking eyes
with my dick, you fuck.

612
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,643
How's that?

613
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:34,313
I thought you'd rhyme.
You didn't.

614
00:36:34,393 --> 00:36:36,515
Fuck you.
Fuck both of you.

615
00:36:36,595 --> 00:36:38,222
Get me out of here.

616
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,462
Why the fuck did we even bother
going out there?

617
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,635
What would it look like
if we didn't go?

618
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,535
Are you gonna relax?

619
00:36:56,615 --> 00:36:58,570
Relax.

620
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,505
Yeah, I'll just take it out
on Karen later.

621
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:02,841
The more I'm with her,
the more abuse she wants.

622
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:04,142
Sounds like fun.

623
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,777
Hey, you want to take her
off my hands?

624
00:37:05,857 --> 00:37:10,282
Be careful, partner, because I have
a very special effect on women.

625
00:37:10,362 --> 00:37:11,516
Go wild.

626
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:12,951
Whatever.

627
00:37:13,031 --> 00:37:15,987
I can't believe I had to face
that piece of shit and look like an idiot.

628
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:19,324
Eh, fuck him.
He's where he belongs.

629
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:20,992
I'm sorry, partner,
I'm really sorry.

630
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:24,007
Stop worrying about it.

631
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:29,501
Whatever happens,
I'm not taking you down with me.

632
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:32,504
Don't worry about me.
I'm all right, believe me.

633
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:35,807
I don't know what I was thinking.
I just don't know what I was thinking.

634
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:38,176
You know what you was thinking?
You were thinking

635
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,918
about a 10-year-old girl
who had her skull crushed.

636
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:44,349
Yeah, I tried to stop you,
but you know what?

637
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:48,653
I admired you that day,
what you did.

638
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:51,656
That was righteous.

639
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:55,570
And you don't second-guess yourself
on something like that.

640
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:04,536
Okay, I'm the killer.

641
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:07,105
I'm the killer.
I show up at your door

642
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:09,141
or your car window,

643
00:38:09,221 --> 00:38:11,476
and for some reason
you open your door,

644
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:14,446
you roll down
your car window for me.

645
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:16,681
So who am I?

646
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:19,084
Someone I know.

647
00:38:19,164 --> 00:38:20,619
Maybe a nice set of tits.

648
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:22,754
And the poems?
What about the poems?

649
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:25,157
You have to compose the poem
before you got there, right?

650
00:38:25,237 --> 00:38:27,192
Otherwise what, you're gonna
blow out the guy's brains,

651
00:38:27,272 --> 00:38:29,094
sit down and write a little sonnet
for yourself?

652
00:38:29,174 --> 00:38:30,529
No prints on the poems,

653
00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:33,565
so probably
I wore gloves when I wrote it.

654
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:36,668
You obviously know your victims.
Between that and the easy access,

655
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:39,037
I guess that they know you too.
They must.

656
00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:41,506
These guys are all scumbags.
They're not gonna trust anyone,

657
00:38:41,586 --> 00:38:44,109
open the door for anyone,
especially if they don't know them.

658
00:38:44,189 --> 00:38:46,478
Yeah, but I more than know them.

659
00:38:46,558 --> 00:38:48,847
I know everything about them.
I know their moves,

660
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:50,749
their patterns,
I know their schedules.

661
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:53,627
Okay, so you're following them.
You're staking them out.

662
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:09,434
Anyone gonna say it?

663
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,448
What?

664
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:16,614
Fuck me.

665
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:20,111
- He's right, it's a cop.
- No.

666
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,447
Let's slow down, fellows.
We're getting way ahead of ourselves.

667
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:26,084
- Come on, it's a cop, you know it.
- I don't know shit. Neither do you.

668
00:39:26,164 --> 00:39:28,987
I'm telling your right now,
it's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop.

669
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:30,722
What do you mean,
"It's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop"?

670
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:34,025
- Where do you come off saying it's a cop?
- Easy, partner, he's just saying it.

671
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:36,695
- What are you talking about?
- He's just saying...

672
00:39:36,775 --> 00:39:40,074
I know, I know, I know
what he's saying.

673
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:43,509
And I'm saying it's bullshit.

674
00:39:44,516 --> 00:39:47,485
Shoot me. What the fuck?
But don't say it's a cop.

675
00:40:06,705 --> 00:40:08,660
So what about dinner?

676
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,295
You feel like going out?

677
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:12,130
Where?

678
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:14,032
I don't care.
You're the one going.

679
00:40:14,112 --> 00:40:15,901
What is your problem?

680
00:40:15,981 --> 00:40:17,936
No problem.

681
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:20,105
If you feel like hanging around,
be my guest.

682
00:40:20,185 --> 00:40:21,473
I don't feel like going out.

683
00:40:21,553 --> 00:40:24,676
Fine, just don't bug me.

684
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:28,886
This is the best part of my day
and I don't need you fucking it up.

685
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:33,652
So you only fuck cops?

686
00:40:33,732 --> 00:40:36,599
Once in a while
I do a fireman or an ex-con.

687
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:40,158
You lump us in together?

688
00:40:40,238 --> 00:40:42,327
Well, I have some respect
for firemen.

689
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:44,162
Fuck you.

690
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:46,131
You know why they take away
your nightstick

691
00:40:46,211 --> 00:40:48,400
- when you hang up your uniform?
- No.

692
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,635
They don't trust you with it.

693
00:40:50,715 --> 00:40:52,837
Right now I wouldn't trust
myself with it either.

694
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:54,906
Shit, you'd probably love that.

695
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:56,608
Too bad you never met
Van Luytens.

696
00:40:56,688 --> 00:40:58,343
You two really would have
hit it off great.

697
00:40:58,423 --> 00:41:00,545
At least somebody finally
brought some justice down

698
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,414
on that dickless little fuck.

699
00:41:02,494 --> 00:41:04,749
Now that is who I'd like to meet.

700
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:06,685
Well, maybe you'll get
your wish one day.

701
00:41:06,765 --> 00:41:08,553
They think it's a cop.

702
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:10,221
- Makes sense.
- Bullshit.

703
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,257
It's just some fucking psychopath.

704
00:41:12,337 --> 00:41:14,669
Well, there's plenty of those
on the job.

705
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:24,636
- Are you sleeping well?
- Not really.

706
00:41:24,716 --> 00:41:26,204
- Yep.
- Eating well?

707
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:27,706
- No.
- Yeah.

708
00:41:27,786 --> 00:41:28,940
Any recurring nightmares?

709
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,511
Yeah, that I'm stuck
in a room with you forever.

710
00:41:32,724 --> 00:41:34,045
Nope.

711
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:35,880
Do you think you're fit
to return to duty?

712
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,916
- Abso-fucking-lutely.
- Yeah.

713
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:41,086
- You ever think about retiring?
- You mean, death with benefits?

714
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,921
What's not to like?

715
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:44,923
- You ever think about retiring?
- Not really.

716
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:46,958
What have I got to look forward to?

717
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:49,194
Sailing my 26-footer
around Sheepshead Bay,

718
00:41:49,274 --> 00:41:50,662
umpiring cops' softball?

719
00:41:50,742 --> 00:41:52,797
- How about corporate security work?
- It's too dangerous.

720
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:56,101
- So what are you gonna do?
- Maybe I'll buy a boat.

721
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:58,236
All right, look,
I don't know if I believe this,

722
00:41:58,316 --> 00:42:00,038
but I'm just gonna
throw it out there.

723
00:42:00,118 --> 00:42:02,407
You guys say we're looking
for one of our own,

724
00:42:02,487 --> 00:42:06,411
but what if it was an ex-cop,
somebody with an ax to grind?

725
00:42:06,491 --> 00:42:08,113
You got one in mind?

726
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:11,282
He's thinking about Martin Baum

727
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:14,085
our old lieutenant.

728
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:16,488
So what's the story with him?

729
00:42:16,568 --> 00:42:18,523
He got fired a few years ago.

730
00:42:18,603 --> 00:42:21,760
I'm not saying there's any motive,
but he knew all the victims.

731
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,363
Yeah, but Turk,
I knew most of those guys.

732
00:42:25,443 --> 00:42:28,566
So did you, Riley, Perez.
Even Karen knew 'em.

733
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:30,669
- I'm just throwing it out there.
- Well, maybe you killed 'em.

734
00:42:30,749 --> 00:42:34,005
Yeah, maybe I did.

735
00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:36,207
The poems and the placement
of the weapons

736
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:38,043
are all we've got
linking the kills,

737
00:42:38,123 --> 00:42:40,779
which means what we gotta do now
is get humping on the forensics.

738
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:43,181
That shouldn't be
too much of a problem.

739
00:42:43,261 --> 00:42:45,216
We already got the girl
working on that.

740
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:49,020
That's right, Karen's been
humping on it all week, as we speak.

741
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,523
What did you say?

742
00:42:51,603 --> 00:42:52,824
Here we go again.

743
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:54,626
- You should watch your mouth.
- Oh, yeah?

744
00:42:54,706 --> 00:42:57,128
He didn't mean anything by it.
Karen and him are ancient history.

745
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:59,330
- College boy can't speak for himself?
- Yeah, I can speak for myself.

746
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,166
Let me speak for myself...
fuck you, Turk.

747
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:03,168
Mutt, I'm gonna hit you
on the head with this barbell.

748
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:05,303
I'm not better than you.
You're not better than me, man.

749
00:43:05,383 --> 00:43:07,038
You put your balls
in your pocket.

750
00:43:07,118 --> 00:43:08,740
And you, fellow officers,

751
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:12,977
a little courtesy
for a fellow professional, you know?

752
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:16,047
Please. Are we gonna move on
here now?

753
00:43:16,127 --> 00:43:18,083
What are we doing?
Where were we?

754
00:43:18,163 --> 00:43:21,686
Talking about Martin Baum.
What's his story?

755
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:24,222
Some guys under him
got caught taking money.

756
00:43:24,302 --> 00:43:26,524
Baum stood up for them,
tried to cover it up.

757
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,960
He do time?

758
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,830
Well, they pressed charges,
but he plead out and resigned.

759
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:33,865
So what's his beef with you?

760
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:35,734
I could have lied to protect him,
but I didn't.

761
00:43:35,814 --> 00:43:38,770
Okay, but if he's got a beef with you,
why not go after you?

762
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:41,306
Why not kill you? Why go around
acting like a serial killer,

763
00:43:41,386 --> 00:43:43,208
killing all these degenerates?
It doesn't make any sense.

764
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:45,677
- I'm just telling you.
- I'm telling you it doesn't make sense.

765
00:43:45,757 --> 00:43:47,779
I'm throwing it out there.
I'm saying this is what it is.

766
00:43:47,859 --> 00:43:49,914
You want to check him out or not?
I don't give a shit.

767
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:52,484
- It doesn't make any sense.
- You're the ones that think it's a cop.

768
00:43:52,564 --> 00:43:54,452
I'm just saying here's a cop
with a chip on his shoulder.

769
00:43:54,532 --> 00:43:56,488
Check him out if you want.
I don't give a shit.

770
00:43:56,568 --> 00:43:59,901
Calm down and give a better reason
why Baum could be a suspect, okay?

771
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:04,173
PMS, gotta be.

772
00:44:10,949 --> 00:44:13,805
- Hey, guys.
- What's going on?

773
00:44:13,885 --> 00:44:16,241
I came over to bring you
the FBI report

774
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:18,243
on the paper and handwriting.

775
00:44:18,323 --> 00:44:20,411
You don't have a problem
with me looking over the evidence

776
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,881
that I collected and processed
for you, do you?

777
00:44:22,961 --> 00:44:24,816
- No problem.
- Put it back, Karen.

778
00:44:24,896 --> 00:44:26,851
- This is fascinating.
- Let's go, come on.

779
00:44:26,931 --> 00:44:28,853
Come on, let's go, let's go.

780
00:44:28,933 --> 00:44:30,688
- What?
- Come on, let's go.

781
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:32,757
Get your hands off me.

782
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:35,026
I'll give you a little privacy.
I don't want to interrupt anything here.

783
00:44:35,106 --> 00:44:36,861
Are you afraid of me
looking at your old case files?

784
00:44:36,941 --> 00:44:39,364
- Is that it?
- Okay, I'm gone. Enjoy.

785
00:44:39,444 --> 00:44:41,399
- What?
- What is it with you?

786
00:44:41,479 --> 00:44:43,504
What is it with you?

787
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:50,275
I'm sorry about last night, okay?

788
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:52,977
I really am. It's a habit.

789
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:55,914
Habits can be broken, right?

790
00:44:55,994 --> 00:44:57,348
That's bullshit.

791
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:58,650
No.

792
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:01,198
I'm totally serious, all right?

793
00:45:02,667 --> 00:45:04,923
It's not bullshit,

794
00:45:05,003 --> 00:45:06,994
really.

795
00:45:13,678 --> 00:45:16,100
Why do you think
Turk was so quick to take the lead

796
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:19,037
on the poetry case, huh?
To keep us from finding the killer, man.

797
00:45:19,117 --> 00:45:21,439
That's what I would do
if I was covering my tracks.

798
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:24,409
He sticks us on this Baum stakeout
'cause it's more misdirection.

799
00:45:24,489 --> 00:45:25,610
Makes sense.

800
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:27,885
I hate that Turk, man.

801
00:45:56,554 --> 00:45:58,545
Hey, he's coming out.
He's coming out.

802
00:46:00,792 --> 00:46:03,124
Oh, at 2:45 in the morning.

803
00:46:06,397 --> 00:46:09,855
Is it killing time
or is he just killing time?

804
00:46:29,487 --> 00:46:31,943
Come on, Baum,
go kill someone already.

805
00:46:32,023 --> 00:46:34,512
Yeah, kill Turk, man.
He's the one setting you up.

806
00:46:34,592 --> 00:46:36,059
Do us all a favor.

807
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:43,655
Hey, did you see Turk's
marksmanship scores?

808
00:46:43,735 --> 00:46:45,256
Did you see this?
It's ridiculous.

809
00:46:45,336 --> 00:46:47,191
Service... 99,
70 out of 100.

810
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:50,662
Combat Association awards,
department commendations.

811
00:46:50,742 --> 00:46:53,142
This guy could take out your left nut
at 50 yards.

812
00:46:56,414 --> 00:46:58,403
Did you see the computer
trajectories, man?

813
00:46:58,483 --> 00:46:59,871
Not one stray slug.

814
00:46:59,951 --> 00:47:02,283
Even Berkowitz put a couple
in the Corinthian leather.

815
00:47:07,425 --> 00:47:09,847
What about Karen?
She come up with anything new?

816
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:11,749
No, not yet.

817
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,751
If Baum kills somebody
I don't want us to be in the car

818
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,197
waiting when it happens, okay?

819
00:47:18,036 --> 00:47:19,657
I'll go.

820
00:47:19,737 --> 00:47:21,693
Attaboy, Teddy, attaboy.

821
00:47:21,773 --> 00:47:23,138
I'm proud of you, son.

822
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:36,474
You're Perez, right?

823
00:47:36,554 --> 00:47:37,842
Yeah.

824
00:47:37,922 --> 00:47:39,617
I'm Martin Baum.

825
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:45,316
I got a permit for this.

826
00:47:45,396 --> 00:47:48,086
I work security
in the diamond district.

827
00:47:48,166 --> 00:47:50,922
So you figure it's a cop
doing the poetry killings?

828
00:47:51,002 --> 00:47:53,825
Someone says, "Check out Baum.
He thinks he got a raw deal."

829
00:47:53,905 --> 00:47:56,294
That's what passes
for police work these days?

830
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:57,829
Do you think you got a raw deal?

831
00:47:57,909 --> 00:47:59,731
Damn straight.

832
00:47:59,811 --> 00:48:02,100
- Life sucks.
- Yeah.

833
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:04,702
- Everything okay, Simon?
- Teddy, where the fuck were you, man?

834
00:48:04,782 --> 00:48:07,038
Anything else you want to tell us,
Lieutenant Baum?

835
00:48:07,118 --> 00:48:11,020
- I got something for you in my pocket.
- Huh!

836
00:48:12,557 --> 00:48:17,248
A passport, credit card receipts,
boarding passes.

837
00:48:17,328 --> 00:48:19,283
The day Brady was killed

838
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:21,532
I was escorting a client
to Brazil.

839
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:28,926
Judgment is
the dominion of the Lord.

840
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:31,863
And if this person,
this worthless rapist

841
00:48:31,943 --> 00:48:34,432
or murderer,
as you describe him,

842
00:48:34,512 --> 00:48:37,869
if he is truly repentant
and seeks absolution,

843
00:48:37,949 --> 00:48:40,271
it must be granted to him.

844
00:48:40,351 --> 00:48:42,740
Your name doesn't ring a bell,

845
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:47,086
but I've had so many
altar boys over the years.

846
00:48:51,195 --> 00:48:53,151
So many altar boys

847
00:48:53,231 --> 00:48:55,887
that it's hard to remember
their names.

848
00:48:55,967 --> 00:48:58,990
My name is David Fisk,
Detective First Grade.

849
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:01,292
You may not remember me now,

850
00:49:01,372 --> 00:49:04,495
but I guarantee you'll remember my name
for the rest of your life.

851
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:08,399
Father Connell,
may he rot in hell.

852
00:49:08,479 --> 00:49:10,947
13 down, one to go.

853
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:22,947
White underwear below the knee.

854
00:49:23,027 --> 00:49:25,450
Briefs-style.

855
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:27,919
Large tweezers.

856
00:49:27,999 --> 00:49:31,422
I am removing a card that has been
inserted in the rectum of the deceased

857
00:49:31,502 --> 00:49:35,529
and placing it
in a plastic evidence bag.

858
00:49:38,242 --> 00:49:41,973
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

859
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:46,237
Hey. It's another one,

860
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:48,512
handwritten.

861
00:49:51,789 --> 00:49:54,512
"The old man
who the children trust,"

862
00:49:54,592 --> 00:49:58,182
Unable to control his lust,

863
00:49:58,262 --> 00:50:01,119
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

864
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:05,260
"The church can't stop him.
Someone must."

865
00:50:06,637 --> 00:50:08,628
I'll see what else I can find.

866
00:50:14,212 --> 00:50:16,434
What's the matter with you?

867
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:18,769
Father Connell gave me
my first communion

868
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,613
back in Bensonhurst.

869
00:50:23,988 --> 00:50:26,444
Hey, guys.
Sorry we didn't get a chance to call.

870
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:29,547
- Yeah, I bet you are.
- Go over there, take a look around.

871
00:50:29,627 --> 00:50:31,716
We'll compare notes later, okay?

872
00:50:31,796 --> 00:50:34,886
Looks like our friend just settled
an old score with the priest,

873
00:50:34,966 --> 00:50:36,921
left him with his pants down.

874
00:50:37,001 --> 00:50:38,589
- Come on.
- No, look.

875
00:50:38,669 --> 00:50:40,091
Come on, don't talk like that.

876
00:50:40,171 --> 00:50:42,139
- Hey, look for yourself.
- Have a little respect.

877
00:50:43,674 --> 00:50:46,831
Next thing they're gonna tell us
Lieutenant Baum was an altar boy here.

878
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:50,301
Tell me about it.
These two guys fucking stink.

879
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:52,670
Look, doctor,
you read the poems.

880
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:54,939
It is possible, right,
that this guy is a cop?

881
00:50:55,019 --> 00:50:57,341
I've never seen it.

882
00:50:57,421 --> 00:51:00,178
I've never even heard
about a cop serial killer.

883
00:51:00,258 --> 00:51:02,419
Come on, girls,
let's go, let's go.

884
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:07,351
Yeah. Go go go go go
go go go go!

885
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:08,419
Safe.

886
00:51:08,499 --> 00:51:10,922
Doc, give us a tip.
How are we gonna catch this guy?

887
00:51:11,002 --> 00:51:12,957
You don't have to worry
about that.

888
00:51:13,037 --> 00:51:14,698
He wants to get caught.

889
00:51:17,008 --> 00:51:19,630
You don't have any better place
to have lunch?

890
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:21,465
I wanted to thank you.

891
00:51:21,545 --> 00:51:23,234
What, about Spider?

892
00:51:23,314 --> 00:51:24,936
Yeah.

893
00:51:25,016 --> 00:51:27,572
And for looking in on me
at the hospital

894
00:51:27,652 --> 00:51:29,140
and the encouragement.

895
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:30,474
Why would he want that?

896
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:33,077
After a while
getting away with it isn't enough.

897
00:51:33,157 --> 00:51:35,112
So is your daughter on the team?

898
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:37,982
No, she used to play,
but now she's 25, living in California,

899
00:51:38,062 --> 00:51:40,718
five years sober
and working as a nurse.

900
00:51:40,798 --> 00:51:42,920
And her mother?

901
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,025
Her mother died
when she was very young.

902
00:51:46,037 --> 00:51:48,926
He wants everybody to know
that he got away with it,

903
00:51:49,006 --> 00:51:52,997
to show everybody
just how brilliant he is.

904
00:51:53,077 --> 00:51:56,200
Most of these killings were criminals
in Rooster's and his beat, right?

905
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,102
And then he all but threatens
to kill Van Luytens

906
00:51:58,182 --> 00:52:00,104
in front of hundreds of witnesses.
And then he sends us

907
00:52:00,184 --> 00:52:03,207
on this crazy wild goose chase
after Lieutenant Baum, didn't he?

908
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:05,243
- Yes, he did.
- Why would he do that? Why?

909
00:52:05,323 --> 00:52:07,812
You gotta show me more than that.
So far you got shit.

910
00:52:07,892 --> 00:52:09,447
- Give him more, man.
- You want more?

911
00:52:09,527 --> 00:52:12,116
- How about the church records?
- The very ones that Turk was

912
00:52:12,196 --> 00:52:14,085
so diligently pursuing.
How about that?

913
00:52:14,165 --> 00:52:17,021
It turns out our most recent victim,
the late Father Connell,

914
00:52:17,101 --> 00:52:19,790
was moved all over the place...
eight parishes in 20 years.

915
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:22,326
Why would they do that
with a Catholic priest? It's obvious.

916
00:52:22,406 --> 00:52:24,862
He's giving the children
more than communion behind the altar.

917
00:52:24,942 --> 00:52:27,331
Now Turk already admits
to knowing this guy as a child.

918
00:52:27,411 --> 00:52:28,742
It's very plausible.

919
00:52:30,181 --> 00:52:33,304
This priest,
this Father Connell,

920
00:52:33,384 --> 00:52:35,039
he gave you your first
holy communion, eh?

921
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:36,207
He did.

922
00:52:36,287 --> 00:52:39,477
Did he every try to do
anything inappropriate? I mean...

923
00:52:39,557 --> 00:52:41,548
I know what you mean.
No, never.

924
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,216
Okay, fine.
Is there any reason

925
00:52:45,296 --> 00:52:47,485
why somebody out there
might think that he did?

926
00:52:47,565 --> 00:52:49,086
No.

927
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,498
Am I a suspect here, Lieutenant?

928
00:52:52,536 --> 00:52:54,525
No,

929
00:52:54,605 --> 00:52:58,396
but these bodies
are starting to smell.

930
00:52:58,476 --> 00:53:01,032
A lot of it is drifting
in your direction.

931
00:53:01,112 --> 00:53:03,067
Drifting or being pushed?

932
00:53:03,147 --> 00:53:05,202
What can I say?

933
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:07,672
You got connections
to most of these victims.

934
00:53:07,752 --> 00:53:10,687
You're not exactly
Mother Teresa.

935
00:53:11,989 --> 00:53:14,845
I never had any problem
with that priest.

936
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:17,815
Okay. Okay, fine.

937
00:53:17,895 --> 00:53:20,625
That settles it.

938
00:53:26,771 --> 00:53:28,826
I had a talk with Riley and Perez.

939
00:53:28,906 --> 00:53:30,394
Good cops.

940
00:53:30,474 --> 00:53:32,897
Don't fuck around, okay?
Just listen.

941
00:53:32,977 --> 00:53:34,198
I'm listening.

942
00:53:34,278 --> 00:53:36,678
They think
Turk might be our guy.

943
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:42,773
Oh, man. I gotta tell you,

944
00:53:42,853 --> 00:53:45,509
from where I'm sitting
that is so fucking funny.

945
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:47,611
You can't take that seriously.

946
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:50,614
Everybody has pretty much
accepted the fact

947
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:53,217
- that we're chasing one of our own.
- But it ain't Turk.

948
00:53:53,297 --> 00:53:55,019
Sure as I'm sitting here
he ain't the guy.

949
00:53:55,099 --> 00:53:56,687
- You know that?
- Yes, I do.

950
00:53:56,767 --> 00:53:59,190
- How do you know that?
- Because I know it.

951
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:01,792
I know it to a moral certainty.

952
00:54:01,872 --> 00:54:03,339
Okay?

953
00:54:04,542 --> 00:54:06,497
This priest,

954
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:09,133
this Father Connell...

955
00:54:09,213 --> 00:54:11,469
he was Turk's priest
when he was a kid.

956
00:54:11,549 --> 00:54:12,536
He told you that.

957
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:14,872
He didn't tell me this priest
was a child molester.

958
00:54:14,952 --> 00:54:17,842
- I can't believe this bullshit.
- Believe it, all right?

959
00:54:17,922 --> 00:54:20,444
- Turk's a good guy.
- You understand?

960
00:54:20,524 --> 00:54:22,747
- He's the best cop you got.
- Don't you tell me what I gotta do.

961
00:54:22,827 --> 00:54:24,849
Don't you say a goddamn word
to him about this either,

962
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:26,863
or you're finished.

963
00:54:36,807 --> 00:54:38,763
Can I speak now?

964
00:54:38,843 --> 00:54:40,640
Feel free.

965
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:45,436
He cares.
You know what I'm saying?

966
00:54:45,516 --> 00:54:48,417
Turk cares about people.

967
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:52,710
I know he runs around
like a pit bull on crack sometimes.

968
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:55,346
It doesn't matter.

969
00:54:55,426 --> 00:54:57,648
He cares about protecting people.

970
00:54:57,728 --> 00:54:59,750
And if you don't back him,

971
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:03,701
you will regret it.

972
00:55:24,922 --> 00:55:26,377
Jesus.

973
00:55:26,457 --> 00:55:28,145
Sorry.

974
00:55:28,225 --> 00:55:30,881
I just never rattled
anyone's cage before.

975
00:55:30,961 --> 00:55:33,984
- Got a minute?
- Yeah, what's up?

976
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:37,421
You know me and Turk
are buddies, right?

977
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:38,956
Of course.

978
00:55:39,036 --> 00:55:40,491
I'd do anything for him.

979
00:55:40,571 --> 00:55:42,927
He would do anything for you.

980
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:44,195
Would you?

981
00:55:44,275 --> 00:55:45,763
Would I what?

982
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:47,868
Would you do anything for him?

983
00:55:51,415 --> 00:55:53,170
I don't know...
where is this going?

984
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,275
He wants you
to have sex with me.

985
00:55:57,421 --> 00:55:59,321
Really?

986
00:56:01,225 --> 00:56:03,013
He wouldn't mind.

987
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:05,749
But that's not why I'm here.

988
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:08,452
Okay, why are you here?

989
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:11,722
Where were you
the night Rambo was killed

990
00:56:11,802 --> 00:56:14,771
and Trager?
Got an alibi for those nights?

991
00:56:16,273 --> 00:56:19,463
I mean, did you know either one
those guys before they were murdered?

992
00:56:19,543 --> 00:56:22,466
Makes you uncomfortable
when I talk like that.

993
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:25,302
You look like you're guilty.
You're not guilty.

994
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,475
I know that.
You didn't kill those guys, did you?

995
00:56:31,155 --> 00:56:34,181
Now you know what Turk feels.

996
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:41,919
I need you to get me
some information

997
00:56:41,999 --> 00:56:44,024
discreetly.

998
00:56:45,669 --> 00:56:47,057
Can you do that for me?

999
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:49,360
You got it.

1000
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,061
Absolutely.

1001
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:53,132
Let's solve these fucking murders.

1002
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:00,971
- Hey, boy genius.
- Perfect timing, buddy.

1003
00:57:01,051 --> 00:57:03,040
Listen, you really worked
on Hingis, didn't you?

1004
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,775
He was all worked up
about my partner.

1005
00:57:04,855 --> 00:57:06,710
Good. He should be.

1006
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:09,313
I think we should sit down,
see if we can square things, okay?

1007
00:57:09,393 --> 00:57:12,550
All right. Want to meet at Montrose
at 8:00 PM?

1008
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:15,886
Could you make that 9:00?
I gotta meet an old friend.

1009
00:57:15,966 --> 00:57:17,593
Yeah, sure, whatever you want.

1010
00:57:26,977 --> 00:57:28,933
- Hey, fellows.
- Hey.

1011
00:57:29,013 --> 00:57:32,136
Thanks for coming.

1012
00:57:32,216 --> 00:57:34,805
- This here is Cheryl Brooks.
- Hello, Cheryl Brooks.

1013
00:57:34,885 --> 00:57:36,876
Cheryl's got something to tell you.

1014
00:57:38,055 --> 00:57:41,645
My daughter Lynn

1015
00:57:41,725 --> 00:57:44,214
died four years ago.

1016
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:47,229
She was 10 years old.
She was raped and she was murdered.

1017
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:53,424
The guy I was living with,
Charles...

1018
00:57:53,504 --> 00:57:54,625
Charles Randall.

1019
00:57:54,705 --> 00:57:57,761
Yeah, Charles Randall... he did it.

1020
00:57:57,841 --> 00:58:00,598
Why are you telling us this?

1021
00:58:00,678 --> 00:58:03,767
Because he got off for that.
He was acquitted at trial.

1022
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:06,077
- Because?
- Because?

1023
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:10,107
I testified for him.

1024
00:58:10,187 --> 00:58:13,020
- You did what?
- I said he was with me.

1025
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:18,248
You see, Cheryl here is
a very forgiving person,

1026
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,584
unlike us hard-asses.

1027
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:22,886
- He threatened to kill me.
- Okay, Cheryl.

1028
00:58:22,966 --> 00:58:26,390
Now you say goodbye
to the nice officers

1029
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:30,260
and you go on back home.

1030
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:33,138
Don't drink yourself to death.

1031
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:37,735
Okay, so...

1032
00:58:37,815 --> 00:58:40,181
eh?

1033
00:58:43,087 --> 00:58:45,776
I want to hear you say it.

1034
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:48,450
Come on, say it.

1035
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:56,854
We planted the gun
in Randall's apartment, okay?

1036
00:58:56,934 --> 00:58:59,223
I said it. Happy?

1037
00:58:59,303 --> 00:59:00,858
- Thank you.
- Yes, I am.

1038
00:59:00,938 --> 00:59:03,661
I'd do it again if I had to
'cause that fucking maggot

1039
00:59:03,741 --> 00:59:07,498
could rot away for all eternity.
I'd sleep just fine.

1040
00:59:07,578 --> 00:59:08,932
So what do you want from us?

1041
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:11,468
You guys think
my partner's a serial killer.

1042
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,303
You're way off.

1043
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:16,407
You like Turk for this thing?
Go have your fun.

1044
00:59:16,487 --> 00:59:18,842
I'll go along with you.

1045
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:21,445
I'll even help you.

1046
00:59:21,525 --> 00:59:25,149
But do not drag up Chuck Randall
and that fucking gun,

1047
00:59:25,229 --> 00:59:28,619
because if he walks out of jail
he's gonna end up dead.

1048
00:59:28,699 --> 00:59:30,758
Excuse me?

1049
00:59:32,336 --> 00:59:35,726
I'll put two
through his fucking head

1050
00:59:35,806 --> 00:59:38,328
myself.

1051
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,672
Done deal.

1052
00:59:53,724 --> 00:59:56,613
My grandmother loved opera.

1053
00:59:56,693 --> 00:59:58,682
She supported us by sewing.

1054
00:59:58,762 --> 01:00:01,819
I used to thread needles
for my grandmother.

1055
01:00:01,899 --> 01:00:04,154
- Gave all her money to church.
- You admired her?

1056
01:00:04,234 --> 01:00:06,323
I worshiped her.

1057
01:00:06,403 --> 01:00:09,159
Rooster? Yeah, he's religious,
goes to church.

1058
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:10,894
How about you?

1059
01:00:10,974 --> 01:00:14,531
Our job is keeping
99% of the population safe

1060
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:18,001
from the other 1%.

1061
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:21,638
The problem is that we have to
spend half our lives with that 1%.

1062
01:00:21,718 --> 01:00:23,474
And the better we do that job,

1063
01:00:23,554 --> 01:00:26,076
the less the other 99% think
they need us.

1064
01:00:26,156 --> 01:00:28,746
They're clueless.

1065
01:00:28,826 --> 01:00:30,714
The only ones paying attention
on the street

1066
01:00:30,794 --> 01:00:33,150
are the cops and the criminals.
Everyone else is just

1067
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:35,994
going somewhere or shopping.

1068
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,794
- Out.
- Come on.

1069
01:00:43,874 --> 01:00:46,330
I got an order here placing you
on restricted duty.

1070
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:48,866
Now in plain English that means
you'll work at your desk.

1071
01:00:48,946 --> 01:00:50,968
You might want to cooperate
with the shrink

1072
01:00:51,048 --> 01:00:53,812
next time you two meet,
and you will meet again.

1073
01:00:57,754 --> 01:01:00,644
Cool my fucking heels.
Cool my fucking heels, huh?

1074
01:01:00,724 --> 01:01:03,413
I'm gonna blow a fucking hole
in that motherfucker Perez

1075
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:06,316
and blow right through his head
for putting me through this bullshit.

1076
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:08,252
- Turk.
- Fuck, I'm gonna...

1077
01:01:08,332 --> 01:01:09,586
kill that motherfucker.

1078
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:12,422
Calm down. What the hell is it?
You're making all the wrong moves.

1079
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,291
What are you talking about?
This ain't a chess game, partner.

1080
01:01:14,371 --> 01:01:16,760
Who knows? Maybe it is.
You go at Perez now...

1081
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:19,296
you know what's gonna happen?
You're gonna walk right into a trap.

1082
01:01:19,376 --> 01:01:21,498
You are.
They're just waiting for you.

1083
01:01:21,578 --> 01:01:23,233
Fucking Hingis.

1084
01:01:23,313 --> 01:01:25,536
Fucking Hingis believes him.

1085
01:01:25,616 --> 01:01:28,572
He actually fucking believes
that motherfucking Perez.

1086
01:01:28,652 --> 01:01:30,107
Stay back. Wait.

1087
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:33,577
Wait for the right time,
then fire away.

1088
01:01:33,657 --> 01:01:35,479
Not now. Now is not the right time.

1089
01:01:35,559 --> 01:01:37,815
Believe me.

1090
01:01:37,895 --> 01:01:40,227
You believe me?
Now is not the time.

1091
01:01:41,398 --> 01:01:43,487
- Please.
- Yeah.

1092
01:01:43,567 --> 01:01:47,291
Hey, Turk, I gotta skip tonight.
My class ran late.

1093
01:01:47,371 --> 01:01:49,726
But I'll see you
tomorrow, all right?

1094
01:01:49,806 --> 01:01:52,663
And I'm sorry about what happened
with you and Lieutenant Hingis today.

1095
01:01:52,743 --> 01:01:54,832
It's gonna be fine.
It'll blow over.

1096
01:01:54,912 --> 01:01:57,801
People are just... everyone's crazy.
People are overreacting.

1097
01:01:57,881 --> 01:02:00,543
All right? Good night.

1098
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:08,951
It's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop.

1099
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:20,501
What you got for me, good-looking?

1100
01:02:25,709 --> 01:02:28,732
Mark my words, there's a reason
Perez is gunning for me.

1101
01:02:28,812 --> 01:02:31,501
Perez is too smart to be that stupid.

1102
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:34,171
For one thing, all that college-boy crap...
that's bullshit.

1103
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:36,440
He did one year at SUNY,
only one year.

1104
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:37,474
No kidding.

1105
01:02:37,554 --> 01:02:39,910
They threw him out...
disruptive influence.

1106
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:42,646
And I hear from the 240 he mixed it up bad
with a captain over there.

1107
01:02:42,726 --> 01:02:44,915
The guy is a total
fucking asshole.

1108
01:02:44,995 --> 01:02:46,783
BMW 3 series,

1109
01:02:46,863 --> 01:02:49,152
Mercedes CLK... too light.

1110
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:52,155
BMW 7 series...
the biggest engine.

1111
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:54,858
That's what you have to get.
If they shoot at you,

1112
01:02:54,938 --> 01:02:57,736
you still want
to get the fuck out of there...

1113
01:02:59,476 --> 01:03:01,265
Bentley... very good

1114
01:03:01,345 --> 01:03:04,067
because can fuck two prostitutes
in back seat

1115
01:03:04,147 --> 01:03:07,838
and mount flame-thrower
on the hood. Da?

1116
01:03:07,918 --> 01:03:09,206
Da.

1117
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:11,575
- What about a Cadillac?
- Come on,

1118
01:03:11,655 --> 01:03:15,112
the fucking car can't turn
fucking corner. Are you kidding me?

1119
01:03:15,192 --> 01:03:16,980
You know either one of those
Neanderthals?

1120
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:19,783
The wop is Joe Scianci from Bensonhurst.
He's a mid-level guy.

1121
01:03:19,863 --> 01:03:21,752
What about Ivan?

1122
01:03:21,832 --> 01:03:23,620
Russian guy, Yevgeny Magulat,

1123
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:27,830
an enforcer for the Italians,
works with Gambinos a lot.

1124
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:34,898
That shit's getting to me.

1125
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:37,003
I know it's getting to you.

1126
01:03:38,749 --> 01:03:41,138
Shit gets to me too, you know,

1127
01:03:41,218 --> 01:03:44,312
but I take it in, I let it out
on my own terms.

1128
01:03:45,922 --> 01:03:47,945
I bet you didn't write
one word down

1129
01:03:48,025 --> 01:03:49,880
in that little notebook
Prosky gave us.

1130
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:52,482
Of course not. Did you?

1131
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:54,894
Yeah, it's great.

1132
01:03:56,466 --> 01:03:58,789
It helps me put things in perspective.

1133
01:03:58,869 --> 01:04:02,826
You know what I'm saying?
Write it down, get it out.

1134
01:04:02,906 --> 01:04:05,395
- You should try this.
- Let's have a look.

1135
01:04:05,475 --> 01:04:08,065
What, are you kidding me?
Oh, come on, come on.

1136
01:04:08,145 --> 01:04:10,567
This belongs to me... private.

1137
01:04:10,647 --> 01:04:14,972
- You don't want to let me see?
- Close to my heart. No, sir.

1138
01:04:15,052 --> 01:04:17,207
I just got sick
of the whole fucking game...

1139
01:04:17,287 --> 01:04:19,710
run around looking for clues,
making arrests,

1140
01:04:19,790 --> 01:04:22,279
write reports, testify, cut deals.

1141
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:25,260
It was all just so much
fucking bullshit.

1142
01:04:28,165 --> 01:04:29,325
Detective...

1143
01:04:35,072 --> 01:04:36,426
Then it all got real simple.

1144
01:04:36,506 --> 01:04:39,496
Yeah, Detective Perez here.
Hey, brother, what's up?

1145
01:04:39,576 --> 01:04:42,466
I hate scumbags. I like shooting people.
What was I giving up?

1146
01:04:42,546 --> 01:04:45,502
Hey, look, I set the meeting up
with Rooster first thing tomorrow.

1147
01:04:45,582 --> 01:04:48,939
Come on, you gotta be fast, man.
I don't want Turk getting wind of anything.

1148
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:51,341
A retirement party and a gold watch?

1149
01:04:51,421 --> 01:04:54,219
A handshake from the mayor
and my name on some fucking plaque?

1150
01:05:00,464 --> 01:05:01,658
Big fucking deal.

1151
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:04,924
It's better this way.

1152
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:09,569
Now everybody knows
who I was and where I stood.

1153
01:05:53,049 --> 01:05:55,040
Hey, it's me.

1154
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:59,943
Listen, I think somebody
followed me here... home.

1155
01:06:00,023 --> 01:06:02,446
He's outside right now.

1156
01:06:02,526 --> 01:06:06,183
Can you come over or...?

1157
01:06:06,263 --> 01:06:09,323
Just call me back, okay?
All right.

1158
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:41,862
Don't move.

1159
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:57,770
- Come on, open up.
- Turk?

1160
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:05,142
I just called you.

1161
01:07:05,222 --> 01:07:06,776
Put the gun down.

1162
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:08,812
There's a car following me.

1163
01:07:08,892 --> 01:07:11,656
Put the gun down.
Put the gun down.

1164
01:07:15,565 --> 01:07:17,020
Have you got
something to tell me?

1165
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:18,855
About what?

1166
01:07:18,935 --> 01:07:21,458
Trager, Randall.

1167
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:23,493
Did you sneak into my apartment?

1168
01:07:23,573 --> 01:07:25,529
What are they doing
on your computer?

1169
01:07:25,609 --> 01:07:27,839
I was checking
all the links in the case.

1170
01:07:31,181 --> 01:07:32,876
Are you hiding something
from me?

1171
01:07:36,119 --> 01:07:37,677
Huh?

1172
01:07:39,189 --> 01:07:42,012
I just received this... this poem.

1173
01:07:42,092 --> 01:07:44,648
A poem?
Not worth mentioning, huh?

1174
01:07:44,728 --> 01:07:47,217
The handwriting
doesn't even match.

1175
01:07:47,297 --> 01:07:49,452
It's a fake.

1176
01:07:49,532 --> 01:07:51,523
Did you write it?

1177
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:55,930
Did you write it?

1178
01:08:00,143 --> 01:08:02,666
What the hell is going on here?

1179
01:08:02,746 --> 01:08:04,868
You're spending a lot of time
with Perez, aren't you?

1180
01:08:04,948 --> 01:08:06,770
Yeah, I've been working the case.

1181
01:08:06,850 --> 01:08:08,972
What, are you jealous?

1182
01:08:09,052 --> 01:08:11,816
Can I trust you?

1183
01:08:13,957 --> 01:08:16,646
- Yes.
- Okay.

1184
01:08:16,726 --> 01:08:19,115
Get me anything and everything
that you can find out

1185
01:08:19,195 --> 01:08:21,629
about Perez or Riley,
what they know about me.

1186
01:08:23,366 --> 01:08:25,155
Everything.

1187
01:08:25,235 --> 01:08:27,703
Karen, don't play me.

1188
01:08:28,972 --> 01:08:32,596
I am leaning much further
into saying that it is a cop.

1189
01:08:32,676 --> 01:08:35,966
Tell you what... I'm moving
past the leaning stage

1190
01:08:36,046 --> 01:08:38,802
and I'm moving towards the
I-know-for-sure-it's-a-fucking-cop stage,

1191
01:08:38,882 --> 01:08:41,171
considering how expertly
he shot the shit out of my house.

1192
01:08:41,251 --> 01:08:43,473
Oh my God.
Are you hurt?

1193
01:08:43,553 --> 01:08:45,609
Am I hurt? Am I hurt?
He wants to know if I'm hurt.

1194
01:08:45,689 --> 01:08:47,223
Actually, he's dead.

1195
01:08:49,926 --> 01:08:53,216
- His name is Magulat.
- The guy we saw at Salerno's.

1196
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:56,319
Yeah, he's in intensive care
at St. Luke's.

1197
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:58,355
They think he's the guy

1198
01:08:58,435 --> 01:09:00,857
- chopped off Yakov Pearlstein's head.
- What do you think?

1199
01:09:00,937 --> 01:09:03,126
You think he's a victim,
or could he be our suspect?

1200
01:09:03,206 --> 01:09:06,232
I don't know, but either way
I think it's gonna be fun.

1201
01:09:07,277 --> 01:09:10,133
Doctor, what's the story?

1202
01:09:10,213 --> 01:09:13,169
He's one of the toughest human beings
I've ever come into contact with.

1203
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:14,971
We took six bullets out of him.

1204
01:09:15,051 --> 01:09:16,873
Six?

1205
01:09:16,953 --> 01:09:19,676
Three from the night he was wounded,
three from previous shootings.

1206
01:09:19,756 --> 01:09:21,611
The man is a tank.

1207
01:09:21,691 --> 01:09:23,713
Do you mind if I talk to him
a little bit?

1208
01:09:23,793 --> 01:09:26,383
His jaw's wired shut,
but go ahead.

1209
01:09:26,463 --> 01:09:29,319
That's okay. I'll ask the questions.
He can just grunt.

1210
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:32,289
Hey, Yevgeny.

1211
01:09:32,369 --> 01:09:34,557
Wake up.

1212
01:09:34,637 --> 01:09:39,296
That's it. Wake up,
you big fucking grizzly bear.

1213
01:09:39,376 --> 01:09:41,731
You don't speak Russian?

1214
01:09:41,811 --> 01:09:45,368
Swoboda. Swoboda. Swoboda.

1215
01:09:45,448 --> 01:09:47,939
Ron.

1216
01:09:52,756 --> 01:09:55,987
I'm thinking this Russian killing machine
could be our first eyewitness.

1217
01:09:58,762 --> 01:10:01,629
Wake up, gugumuck.
You can tell us who did this to you.

1218
01:10:05,869 --> 01:10:09,259
Detective, I think that's enough.

1219
01:10:09,339 --> 01:10:12,797
Then you could tell us where you put
Yakov Pearlstein's head.

1220
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:19,069
4-3, 4-3, I need a round-the-clock
security detail

1221
01:10:19,149 --> 01:10:23,373
on a patient Magulat, M-A-gulat,

1222
01:10:23,453 --> 01:10:25,648
St. Luke's in the ICU.

1223
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:34,617
Is this the number to call
to report a case of police brutality?

1224
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:38,121
- Cat got your tongue?
- Out on bail again?

1225
01:10:38,201 --> 01:10:40,423
What, you think you can scare me,
little bitch? What do you want?

1226
01:10:40,503 --> 01:10:42,792
Be careful, detective.
My taxes pay your salary.

1227
01:10:42,872 --> 01:10:45,428
You don't pay any fucking taxes,
you lowlife piece of shit.

1228
01:10:45,508 --> 01:10:47,831
- Get to the point, come on.
- One of your vics, Trager,

1229
01:10:47,911 --> 01:10:50,500
stole a whole lot of guns
down South.

1230
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,635
Same guns are turning up
on your murder scenes.

1231
01:10:52,715 --> 01:10:53,970
So it's simple...

1232
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:56,539
find stolen guns,
you got your guy.

1233
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:58,408
So you know the guy?

1234
01:10:58,488 --> 01:11:01,244
Do you know if there's a cop out there
who might be a danger to the public?

1235
01:11:01,324 --> 01:11:04,047
I couldn't live with myself
if I just stood by and didn't say anything.

1236
01:11:04,127 --> 01:11:07,083
Look, I'm gonna give you
two seconds more. Give me yes or no.

1237
01:11:07,163 --> 01:11:10,053
Do you know the guy?
And when do I meet you to talk about it?

1238
01:11:10,133 --> 01:11:12,822
Friday, 9:00 PM, at my club.

1239
01:11:12,902 --> 01:11:14,023
I'll be there.

1240
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:16,092
Man, there's dumb
and there's dumber,

1241
01:11:16,172 --> 01:11:18,595
but this is the motherfucking dumbest
right here, man.

1242
01:11:18,675 --> 01:11:20,797
Easy, son, easy.
It's gonna be easy for you.

1243
01:11:20,877 --> 01:11:24,434
All you gotta do is be bait, that's all.
Be a little sardine for us, all right?

1244
01:11:24,514 --> 01:11:27,137
You help us... we got you covered.
Your club doesn't get hassled

1245
01:11:27,217 --> 01:11:29,706
and you don't have a revolving door
in and out of jail.

1246
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:31,341
Do we have a deal or not?

1247
01:11:31,421 --> 01:11:34,778
Yeah, but your boy come in here
and go Hannibal Lecter on my ass,

1248
01:11:34,858 --> 01:11:37,347
I don't want no Jodie fucking Foster
coming through the door.

1249
01:11:37,427 --> 01:11:39,258
I want the goddamn
Marine Corps, man.

1250
01:12:11,961 --> 01:12:13,416
Evening, detective.

1251
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:16,619
You want one? It's shit,
but it's better than nothing, right?

1252
01:12:16,699 --> 01:12:19,889
As soon as I heard
the fucking Russian didn't die

1253
01:12:19,969 --> 01:12:22,192
I knew things would never
be the same.

1254
01:12:22,272 --> 01:12:24,394
I had to change the rules,

1255
01:12:24,474 --> 01:12:26,429
the strategy.

1256
01:12:26,509 --> 01:12:30,275
I had to be bold, do something
that could never be undone.

1257
01:12:38,121 --> 01:12:40,423
I went for the unforgivable.

1258
01:13:07,517 --> 01:13:10,213
No. Please. No.

1259
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:35,108
Did you hear
anything I just said?

1260
01:13:36,279 --> 01:13:39,969
How exactly could I be
blowing this out of proportion?

1261
01:13:40,049 --> 01:13:42,171
That psycho just assaulted me.

1262
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:45,508
I am telling you
he is a classic sociopath.

1263
01:13:45,588 --> 01:13:47,677
Okay okay,
I'll look into it, all right?

1264
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:49,212
I'll look into it.

1265
01:13:49,292 --> 01:13:51,414
You stay the hell away from here.
Understood?

1266
01:13:51,494 --> 01:13:53,291
Understood?

1267
01:13:55,365 --> 01:13:56,696
Fuck that.

1268
01:14:08,111 --> 01:14:10,409
Check the ball, check the ball.

1269
01:14:11,914 --> 01:14:15,104
I got the ball. I got the ball. I got the ball.
Stay on him. Stay on him.

1270
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:17,073
Excuse me,
I'm Detective Corelli.

1271
01:14:17,153 --> 01:14:20,088
- I need to see your reservation book.
- Sure. Help yourself.

1272
01:14:27,530 --> 01:14:29,719
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

1273
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:31,454
Yes, this is Detective Corelli.

1274
01:14:31,534 --> 01:14:33,923
I've been trying to reach
Detectives Perez and Riley

1275
01:14:34,003 --> 01:14:35,892
and I can't seem to locate them.

1276
01:14:35,972 --> 01:14:38,928
- I like to party.
- That's nothing. I was into Kiss.

1277
01:14:39,008 --> 01:14:40,964
I used to run around the house

1278
01:14:41,044 --> 01:14:43,132
with my tongue hanging out,
spitting fake blood.

1279
01:14:43,212 --> 01:14:44,509
I need to speak to them
urgently.

1280
01:14:48,351 --> 01:14:51,752
Yes, I understand,
but I need the location, please.

1281
01:15:20,316 --> 01:15:22,772
Hey, he's here.

1282
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:24,046
Let me in.

1283
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:31,781
Thank God it's the police.

1284
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:34,150
Yeah, so where do we go?

1285
01:15:34,230 --> 01:15:36,119
Follow me.

1286
01:15:36,199 --> 01:15:38,454
I used to play ball
a couple of blocks from here.

1287
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:39,722
Get the fuck out of here.

1288
01:15:39,802 --> 01:15:42,692
When I was a kid I wasn't afraid
to mix it up with guys like you.

1289
01:15:42,772 --> 01:15:44,027
You still ain't.

1290
01:15:44,107 --> 01:15:46,596
Yeah, nowadays
I carry a gun with me.

1291
01:15:46,676 --> 01:15:49,899
It's a bad neighborhood.

1292
01:15:49,979 --> 01:15:51,934
- It ain't bad for me.
- Yeah, well...

1293
01:15:52,014 --> 01:15:54,370
Yeah, he's inside.

1294
01:15:54,450 --> 01:15:55,972
Well, so far so good.

1295
01:15:56,052 --> 01:15:58,608
So now that we're done with
the pleasantries, what do you got for me?

1296
01:15:58,688 --> 01:15:59,876
He's talking.

1297
01:15:59,956 --> 01:16:01,911
- What did you think he was gonna do?
- How about an apology?

1298
01:16:01,991 --> 01:16:04,714
The shit that happened to Stubby,
that wasn't supposed to happen.

1299
01:16:04,794 --> 01:16:08,284
- Lieutenant, that's a crock of shit.
- I lost three fucking teeth that day.

1300
01:16:08,364 --> 01:16:10,586
He's not a civilian.
He's a fucking dealer.

1301
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:12,689
- And I kept my mouth shut.
- So what?

1302
01:16:12,769 --> 01:16:16,025
You guys love those stupid gold teeth.
You should thank me.

1303
01:16:16,105 --> 01:16:18,895
Well, he's wearing a vest
and Starsky and Hutch here

1304
01:16:18,975 --> 01:16:21,964
are watching him like a couple
of hawks... gay hawks.

1305
01:16:22,044 --> 01:16:25,168
Yeah, right there, buddy.

1306
01:16:25,248 --> 01:16:28,171
All right, enough bullshit.
So you know our poetry boy?

1307
01:16:28,251 --> 01:16:30,206
Just talk to me.
What do you got for me?

1308
01:16:30,286 --> 01:16:32,308
- All right, here we go.
- Here we go.

1309
01:16:32,388 --> 01:16:33,810
Would you please?

1310
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:36,679
Just 'cause the guy's talking tough,
that don't mean shit.

1311
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:38,514
Let me ask you something,
Copernicus.

1312
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:41,150
That gun on his belt...
do you think it's a service pistol?

1313
01:16:41,230 --> 01:16:43,853
I bet you we'll trace it back to Trager's.
What do you think about that?

1314
01:16:43,933 --> 01:16:45,621
- What do you want to bet?
- 500 bucks.

1315
01:16:45,701 --> 01:16:47,790
- You're on.
- I'm in for another five.

1316
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:50,193
Oh, this is fun.

1317
01:16:50,273 --> 01:16:52,428
Look, I help you,
you reciprocate.

1318
01:16:52,508 --> 01:16:53,930
So help me.

1319
01:16:54,010 --> 01:16:56,265
All right, you might see
a little bit of a cell-phone video.

1320
01:16:56,345 --> 01:16:58,367
I got it in front of Trager's
the night he bought it.

1321
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:00,336
- You got what?
- I got a movie...

1322
01:17:00,416 --> 01:17:03,873
a couple of kids back from the prom,
preserving their special memories,

1323
01:17:03,953 --> 01:17:05,608
a positive ID of you, big time.

1324
01:17:05,688 --> 01:17:07,810
- Oh, yeah? Of me?
- Yeah.

1325
01:17:07,890 --> 01:17:09,579
Okay.

1326
01:17:09,659 --> 01:17:11,147
Now you know
what I'm talking about.

1327
01:17:11,227 --> 01:17:13,549
Yeah, now I got it.

1328
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:15,563
Yeah, well, so how do I look?

1329
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:20,192
Like a poet?

1330
01:17:21,204 --> 01:17:22,825
'Cause that's what I am,
you know, a poet.

1331
01:17:22,905 --> 01:17:25,561
All right, come on, let's go.

1332
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:28,231
In fact, I wrote a poem for you, Spider.
Want to hear it?

1333
01:17:28,311 --> 01:17:30,245
Eh?

1334
01:17:34,116 --> 01:17:37,573
Drop your gun right now, motherfucker!
Drop to the ground right now!

1335
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:39,442
Grease me up and...

1336
01:17:39,522 --> 01:17:41,544
I mean, do they actually pay
you two morons?

1337
01:17:41,624 --> 01:17:44,847
- Put the fucking weapon on the ground.
- Gladly. Gladly. Right there.

1338
01:17:44,927 --> 01:17:46,895
Right there. There you go.

1339
01:17:48,064 --> 01:17:49,919
Hey, you want to read my poem?

1340
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:51,387
Easy easy.

1341
01:17:51,467 --> 01:17:52,764
Here, read it.

1342
01:17:54,937 --> 01:17:57,160
"You tried to set me up, you fucks,"

1343
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:58,995
And this is how you do it?

1344
01:17:59,075 --> 01:18:01,764
You thought I'd get
my dick cut off,

1345
01:18:01,844 --> 01:18:04,367
"Instead you only blew it."

1346
01:18:04,447 --> 01:18:06,435
Great stuff.

1347
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:08,838
- What is that shit?
- Thank you.

1348
01:18:08,918 --> 01:18:11,307
That is poetry.

1349
01:18:11,387 --> 01:18:13,075
What are you doing here?

1350
01:18:13,155 --> 01:18:14,944
Well, don't look at me, partner,

1351
01:18:15,024 --> 01:18:17,480
but I tagged along
to protect your ass

1352
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:20,850
and to see the look on their faces.
It was worth it.

1353
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:23,252
We're doing our jobs here, okay?
I'm not gonna apologize for that.

1354
01:18:23,332 --> 01:18:25,922
I never want you to apologize, Teddy.
There's a killer out there with a badge.

1355
01:18:26,002 --> 01:18:28,124
- What are you morons doing about it?
- What do you think we're doing here?

1356
01:18:28,204 --> 01:18:30,026
- That's not it.
- No, that's not it.

1357
01:18:30,106 --> 01:18:31,961
I just made 1000 bucks.

1358
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:33,863
Where's the other gun?
Give it to me.

1359
01:18:33,943 --> 01:18:35,698
Why don't you frisk me, Sherlock?
Go ahead.

1360
01:18:35,778 --> 01:18:38,138
- Frisk me, go ahead. Go ahead.
- Yeah, I'm gonna frisk you.

1361
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:43,673
Nice touch, Mary.

1362
01:18:43,753 --> 01:18:45,875
What are you doing after work?
Unless you're committed.

1363
01:18:45,955 --> 01:18:48,144
I don't want to get
in the middle of anything.

1364
01:18:48,224 --> 01:18:51,414
What happened to your face?
Your mick friend give you a little love bite?

1365
01:18:51,494 --> 01:18:54,817
- Shut the fuck up. Shut your fucking face.
- Hey hey hey!

1366
01:18:54,897 --> 01:18:57,587
I'll blow your brains out
if you don't get the fuck away.

1367
01:18:57,667 --> 01:18:59,789
What's he talking about?

1368
01:18:59,869 --> 01:19:01,624
- What's he talking about?
- What he's talking about is,

1369
01:19:01,704 --> 01:19:03,993
just 'cause you didn't go for this
doesn't mean you're not our guy.

1370
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:06,395
- Now we gotta break this shit up.
- Don't translate for me, man.

1371
01:19:06,475 --> 01:19:09,065
Will you let this go?
You fucked up, okay?

1372
01:19:09,145 --> 01:19:11,634
- We fucked up 'cause you helped him.
- I'm gonna nail your ass.

1373
01:19:11,714 --> 01:19:14,036
I'm not through with you, man.
Make a mistake.

1374
01:19:14,116 --> 01:19:16,072
I'm gonna
break this stuff down, okay?

1375
01:19:16,152 --> 01:19:18,382
You fucking dog.

1376
01:19:19,922 --> 01:19:22,645
Relax, Spider.

1377
01:19:22,725 --> 01:19:25,014
Come on, let's have a drink.

1378
01:19:25,094 --> 01:19:28,655
I saw what I think
is a refrigerator here.

1379
01:19:32,868 --> 01:19:34,529
I'll be back in a second.

1380
01:19:43,479 --> 01:19:44,969
Hey, muffinhead.

1381
01:19:48,184 --> 01:19:49,651
Is this the person who shot you?

1382
01:19:50,653 --> 01:19:52,587
You're sure?

1383
01:19:58,327 --> 01:20:00,352
No, you're the pumpkinhead.

1384
01:20:11,607 --> 01:20:13,575
You miss me?

1385
01:20:15,611 --> 01:20:17,900
"...of death and pain,"

1386
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:20,102
Place oneself among the slain.

1387
01:20:20,182 --> 01:20:22,672
If one addiction goes unfed,

1388
01:20:22,752 --> 01:20:25,050
"The world is better with him dead."

1389
01:20:43,639 --> 01:20:44,827
Take it easy.

1390
01:20:44,907 --> 01:20:46,629
It's okay.
It's gonna be all right.

1391
01:20:46,709 --> 01:20:48,898
Jesus Christ, Rooster.

1392
01:20:48,978 --> 01:20:51,801
Just move into the room. Here.

1393
01:20:51,881 --> 01:20:54,349
Sit down. Sit down.

1394
01:20:57,253 --> 01:20:59,208
Okay.

1395
01:20:59,288 --> 01:21:02,945
You gotta know about this,
Tom, from me.

1396
01:21:03,025 --> 01:21:06,082
Now just open that little book,
start reading.

1397
01:21:06,162 --> 01:21:08,630
Everything you want to know
is in there.

1398
01:21:10,666 --> 01:21:12,657
So go ahead.

1399
01:21:14,236 --> 01:21:16,227
Out loud.

1400
01:21:17,573 --> 01:21:19,628
For the record.

1401
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:22,472
See the little video here?

1402
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:32,208
"My name is David Fisk,
Detective First Grade.

1403
01:21:32,288 --> 01:21:36,349
I've been a cop in the NYPD
for nearly 30 years."

1404
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:40,950
- Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave.
- Tom,

1405
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:44,124
we've got a lot to cover
and not much time to do it in, so...

1406
01:21:47,403 --> 01:21:50,559
"My name is David Fisk,
Detective First Grade."

1407
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:53,129
My name is David Fisk.

1408
01:21:53,209 --> 01:21:56,198
"I've been a cop in the NYPD
for nearly 30 years."

1409
01:21:56,278 --> 01:21:59,101
I don't expect you
to remember me.

1410
01:21:59,181 --> 01:22:01,170
I mean, it's been a long time

1411
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:05,007
since you sat me on your lap
and told me you loved me.

1412
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:08,110
"In that time

1413
01:22:08,190 --> 01:22:10,920
I've killed 14 people."

1414
01:22:12,027 --> 01:22:13,983
But I guarantee

1415
01:22:14,063 --> 01:22:17,226
you're gonna remember the name
for the rest of your life.

1416
01:22:27,743 --> 01:22:31,338
"You don't become a cop
because you want to serve and protect."

1417
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:35,805
You join the force because they let you
carry a gun and a badge.

1418
01:22:35,885 --> 01:22:38,507
Most people respect the badge.

1419
01:22:38,587 --> 01:22:40,643
"Everybody respects the gun."

1420
01:22:40,723 --> 01:22:43,512
I'm the killer.
I show up at your door.

1421
01:22:43,592 --> 01:22:46,382
What are you talking about?
It's not a fucking chess game.

1422
01:22:46,462 --> 01:22:49,518
Who knows? Maybe it is.
You're making all the wrong moves.

1423
01:22:49,598 --> 01:22:51,754
I'm gonna put two
through his fucking head

1424
01:22:51,834 --> 01:22:54,123
myself.

1425
01:22:54,203 --> 01:22:56,325
I know it to a moral certainty.

1426
01:22:56,405 --> 01:22:58,930
You sort of get numb to it.

1427
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:11,214
"Tom Cowen was my role model."

1428
01:23:21,297 --> 01:23:23,552
The day I stopped trying to be him

1429
01:23:23,632 --> 01:23:25,964
was the greatest day of my life.

1430
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:33,262
Several years back I framed
a lowlife child killer

1431
01:23:33,342 --> 01:23:36,004
named Charles Randall.

1432
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:40,180
"I should have known
it would come back to haunt me."

1433
01:23:44,386 --> 01:23:46,752
What do you want me
to do with this?

1434
01:23:48,557 --> 01:23:50,946
Is that all you got to say?

1435
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:53,215
I owe you this explanation, pal.

1436
01:23:53,295 --> 01:23:55,284
Why are you telling me now?

1437
01:23:55,364 --> 01:23:59,655
Ivan the Terrible
is gonna wake up pretty soon

1438
01:23:59,735 --> 01:24:01,532
and he's gonna ID me.

1439
01:24:07,109 --> 01:24:08,898
Evening, detective.

1440
01:24:08,978 --> 01:24:11,901
You want one? It's shit,
but it's better than nothing, right?

1441
01:24:11,981 --> 01:24:16,105
I can just walk right in here.
Your partner's asleep. Step outside.

1442
01:24:16,185 --> 01:24:19,018
Did I ever pick
the wrong fucking Russki to shoot?

1443
01:24:28,397 --> 01:24:30,797
Now we're going off the record.

1444
01:24:33,335 --> 01:24:37,092
I'm going to take the rap
for the Randall gun thing.

1445
01:24:37,172 --> 01:24:38,961
You saw that.

1446
01:24:39,041 --> 01:24:42,164
I mean, considering
the circumstances, why not?

1447
01:24:42,244 --> 01:24:44,712
No need to thank me.

1448
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:47,803
That business about not being me...

1449
01:24:47,883 --> 01:24:49,338
Yeah.

1450
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:51,340
I don't get that.

1451
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:55,377
Well, you're a great cop, Tom.

1452
01:24:55,457 --> 01:24:57,413
I mean, you were the one

1453
01:24:57,493 --> 01:25:00,553
I aspired to all my life
and could never be.

1454
01:25:02,131 --> 01:25:04,486
Then you broke the law,

1455
01:25:04,566 --> 01:25:07,690
planted the gun on Randall,

1456
01:25:07,770 --> 01:25:11,035
let me down.

1457
01:25:12,775 --> 01:25:14,709
I lost my faith.

1458
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:20,202
That's when it all started.

1459
01:25:20,282 --> 01:25:22,905
And once it did,

1460
01:25:22,985 --> 01:25:25,010
I couldn't stop.

1461
01:25:26,388 --> 01:25:30,045
Finally,

1462
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:32,616
I didn't want to.

1463
01:25:39,034 --> 01:25:42,558
So I did my own thing.

1464
01:25:42,638 --> 01:25:45,194
And you know what? In the end

1465
01:25:45,274 --> 01:25:47,529
it got done.

1466
01:25:47,609 --> 01:25:50,099
The scum went down.

1467
01:25:50,179 --> 01:25:52,044
And that's it. That's that.

1468
01:25:53,582 --> 01:25:55,838
I don't understand
a word you said,

1469
01:25:55,918 --> 01:25:58,040
- don't understand any of it.
- I know you don't, Tom.

1470
01:25:58,120 --> 01:26:00,776
As soon as I heard
the Russian didn't die

1471
01:26:00,856 --> 01:26:03,178
I knew I had to change the rules,

1472
01:26:03,258 --> 01:26:06,048
do something that could
never be undone.

1473
01:26:06,128 --> 01:26:08,187
I went for the unforgivable.

1474
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:13,424
No.

1475
01:26:14,903 --> 01:26:17,126
So what am I gonna do, my friend,

1476
01:26:17,206 --> 01:26:19,795
partner? Arrest you?

1477
01:26:19,875 --> 01:26:22,698
At some point I gotta call it in.

1478
01:26:22,778 --> 01:26:24,133
We're a team.

1479
01:26:24,213 --> 01:26:25,868
We were.

1480
01:26:25,948 --> 01:26:27,903
Yeah, we were, a great team.

1481
01:26:27,983 --> 01:26:30,439
That was yesterday, Dave.

1482
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:31,645
Today...

1483
01:26:33,756 --> 01:26:36,725
today you're pointing a gun at me.

1484
01:26:41,163 --> 01:26:44,291
But it hasn't gone off yet.

1485
01:26:49,671 --> 01:26:51,126
Bye, Tom.

1486
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:53,262
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

1487
01:26:53,342 --> 01:26:56,345
To hell, I suppose.

1488
01:27:43,025 --> 01:27:45,013
Hey, Dave, Dave.

1489
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:47,616
Don't come closer!

1490
01:27:47,696 --> 01:27:49,985
- You wouldn't.
- You want to bet your life on it?

1491
01:27:50,065 --> 01:27:51,987
Come on, partner, I know you.
You wouldn't.

1492
01:27:52,067 --> 01:27:54,433
But I would.

1493
01:27:55,737 --> 01:27:57,693
Karen, just take it easy.

1494
01:27:57,773 --> 01:27:59,762
- Can't get me out of your mind?
- Shut up, Dave.

1495
01:27:59,842 --> 01:28:03,832
You're gonna defend
this lowlife piece of shit?

1496
01:28:03,912 --> 01:28:06,802
- Boy, I'm in your head.
- I'm not defending him. Take it easy.

1497
01:28:06,882 --> 01:28:10,005
Fuck you, Turk.
Put the gun down, Fisk.

1498
01:28:10,085 --> 01:28:11,507
- And if I don't?
- Dave.

1499
01:28:11,587 --> 01:28:14,309
- How about I blow your brains out?
- I like the sound of that.

1500
01:28:14,389 --> 01:28:16,278
- Don't move.
- Karen.

1501
01:28:16,358 --> 01:28:18,714
You blow me away, Turk dies.
Is that your idea?

1502
01:28:18,794 --> 01:28:20,082
I said don't move, you prick.

1503
01:28:20,162 --> 01:28:22,460
Bye-bye!

1504
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:25,724
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.

1505
01:28:27,402 --> 01:28:29,097
Stay here.

1506
01:28:35,878 --> 01:28:37,277
Oh, man.

1507
01:28:38,614 --> 01:28:39,876
Fuck.

1508
01:28:41,416 --> 01:28:43,272
These old locks...

1509
01:28:43,352 --> 01:28:45,007
I mean, they're good.

1510
01:28:45,087 --> 01:28:47,009
Dave, you've got to end
this thing.

1511
01:28:47,089 --> 01:28:49,111
End it?

1512
01:28:49,191 --> 01:28:50,446
Put the gun down.

1513
01:28:50,526 --> 01:28:53,282
What's your plan?

1514
01:28:53,362 --> 01:28:55,617
Are you gonna arrest me?

1515
01:28:55,697 --> 01:28:58,487
Are you gonna take me down
to the precinct, book me,

1516
01:28:58,567 --> 01:29:02,191
fingerprint me,
body-cavity-search me?

1517
01:29:02,271 --> 01:29:04,092
What the fuck are you gonna do?

1518
01:29:04,172 --> 01:29:07,062
Wheel me out on the "Geraldo" show,
a freak of the week?

1519
01:29:07,142 --> 01:29:11,800
Or better yet, an in-depth
psycho profile on "Oprah"?

1520
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:14,136
Are you ready for that?
It ain't gonna fly, man.

1521
01:29:14,216 --> 01:29:16,538
Dave, you give me no choice.

1522
01:29:16,618 --> 01:29:18,449
You got a choice... I escape.

1523
01:29:20,022 --> 01:29:22,286
Would you do that for me, Tom?

1524
01:29:23,392 --> 01:29:24,580
Would you let me escape?

1525
01:29:24,660 --> 01:29:26,148
Come on, don't do this.

1526
01:29:26,228 --> 01:29:28,517
I'm gonna make a run for it.

1527
01:29:28,597 --> 01:29:30,752
What do you think?

1528
01:29:30,832 --> 01:29:33,824
You gotta do the right thing.

1529
01:29:39,841 --> 01:29:41,864
That's a 10-10, partner...

1530
01:29:41,944 --> 01:29:45,267
shots fired, suspect fleeing.
Let's go!

1531
01:29:45,347 --> 01:29:46,974
Come on, don't go there.

1532
01:29:48,483 --> 01:29:51,507
Hey, partner, come on.
Shots fired.

1533
01:29:51,587 --> 01:29:53,976
- Don't do this.
- Suspect fleeing,

1534
01:29:54,056 --> 01:29:56,490
resisting arrest. Come on.

1535
01:30:05,901 --> 01:30:08,757
A righteous man

1536
01:30:08,837 --> 01:30:11,527
Before me stands,

1537
01:30:11,607 --> 01:30:15,931
A hero in these filthy lands.

1538
01:30:16,011 --> 01:30:19,368
A brother in arms,

1539
01:30:19,448 --> 01:30:22,871
In heart are you.

1540
01:30:22,951 --> 01:30:25,574
I was really hoping

1541
01:30:25,654 --> 01:30:28,316
You'd get it too.

1542
01:30:31,793 --> 01:30:34,316
- I do get it.
- No, you don't.

1543
01:30:34,396 --> 01:30:36,330
No, I get it.

1544
01:30:42,671 --> 01:30:45,894
You know, the only thing
in this life

1545
01:30:45,974 --> 01:30:48,764
that ever gave me
any satisfaction

1546
01:30:48,844 --> 01:30:50,744
was killing those fucks.

1547
01:30:52,681 --> 01:30:54,970
So this is for real.

1548
01:30:55,050 --> 01:30:57,372
I mean,

1549
01:30:57,452 --> 01:30:59,784
this one is bad.

1550
01:31:01,957 --> 01:31:03,584
10-13.

1551
01:31:04,593 --> 01:31:06,788
Officer down.

1552
01:31:30,419 --> 01:31:33,442
I ain't going anywhere, Tom.

1553
01:31:33,522 --> 01:31:35,820
I ain't going anywhere.

1554
01:31:36,958 --> 01:31:39,791
It's okay.

1555
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:47,789
3-4 squad, Central.
3-4 squad, Central.

1556
01:31:47,869 --> 01:31:50,325
10-13, officer down.
184th and St. Nick's.

1557
01:31:50,405 --> 01:31:53,095
Officer down, 10-13.
Hurry hurry hurry.

1558
01:31:53,175 --> 01:31:55,797
10-4, 4 squad...
Tom, don't. Don't.

1559
01:31:55,877 --> 01:31:59,401
- Officer down. ETA six minutes.
- Don't.

1560
01:31:59,481 --> 01:32:02,109
Don't.

1561
01:32:14,329 --> 01:32:16,354
Don't.

1562
01:32:24,806 --> 01:32:26,862
3-4 squad, Central.

1563
01:32:26,942 --> 01:32:29,498
Central.
Go ahead, 4 squad.

1564
01:32:29,578 --> 01:32:32,067
That's a 10-55 on the bus.
Cancel the ambulance.

1565
01:32:32,147 --> 01:32:34,102
10-5?

1566
01:32:34,182 --> 01:32:37,205
Cancel the ambulance.
10-55 on the bus. Cancel the ambulance.

1567
01:32:37,285 --> 01:32:39,947
- You sure on that?
- Sure on that.

1568
01:32:49,097 --> 01:32:51,463
You did this, you know.

1569
01:32:53,034 --> 01:32:56,492
I know, partner, I know.

1570
01:32:59,641 --> 01:33:01,472
We did good, Tom.

1571
01:33:02,711 --> 01:33:05,100
Tom, Tommy.

1572
01:33:05,180 --> 01:33:08,911
We did good. We did good.

1573
01:33:10,619 --> 01:33:13,308
You're a good man, Tom.

1574
01:33:13,388 --> 01:33:15,822
You're a good man.

1575
01:33:17,192 --> 01:33:20,182
I wish you...

1576
01:33:20,262 --> 01:33:22,517
I wish you

1577
01:33:22,597 --> 01:33:25,691
continued success.

1578
01:34:07,409 --> 01:34:09,531
Some piece of work, your partner.

1579
01:34:09,611 --> 01:34:11,566
Lights.

1580
01:34:11,646 --> 01:34:13,401
Look, Cowen,

1581
01:34:13,481 --> 01:34:16,104
the way we see it,

1582
01:34:16,184 --> 01:34:19,153
Detective Fisk just closed the door
on the poetry boy.

1583
01:34:26,094 --> 01:34:29,257
Good. Whatever you say.

1584
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:34,523
Are we done?

1585
01:34:34,603 --> 01:34:36,628
Yeah, we're done.

1586
01:34:58,727 --> 01:35:00,515
My daughter called.

1587
01:35:00,595 --> 01:35:04,219
She was upset about Rooster
and worried about me.

1588
01:35:04,299 --> 01:35:07,823
She asked me if I was likely
to do something stupid

1589
01:35:07,903 --> 01:35:10,425
and I said, "Like what",

1590
01:35:10,505 --> 01:35:13,495
take anger management classes
or retire?"

1591
01:35:13,575 --> 01:35:16,798
I said I was gonna do
the same old thing I always do.

1592
01:35:16,878 --> 01:35:20,735
She said, "Good.
What else could you do?"

1593
01:35:20,815 --> 01:35:22,437
I said, "Right."

1594
01:35:22,517 --> 01:35:25,507
A real chip off the old block,
my daughter.

1595
01:35:25,587 --> 01:35:28,777
She said I was a cop
and a good one.

1596
01:35:28,857 --> 01:35:32,418
Funny... Rooster said
the same thing.

1597
01:35:35,530 --> 01:35:38,753
Okay, guys,
let's get ready to play ball.

1598
01:35:38,833 --> 01:35:42,624
On the count of three.
Everybody in?

1599
01:35:42,704 --> 01:35:46,265
One, two, three, explosion!
