00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:08,153
A typical English
New Year's Eve party.

2
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:11,056
Come, everybody,
  join hands.

3
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:14,092
It is an old English custom.

4
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:19,231
♪ Should old acquaintance
        be forgotten? ♪

5
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,303
<i> Adios, Presidente.</i>

6
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,606
<i> Adios,</i> Hernandez.

7
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:35,847
Ladies and gentlemen.

8
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,382
Ladies and gentlemen,

9
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:40,819
may I have your attention
for a minute please?

10
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:42,955
In 10 minutes time
we should be welcoming...

11
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,923
Large whiskey, please.

12
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,226
We should be welcoming
        in the New Year,

13
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:50,262
but before we start to
make our good resolution--

14
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,367
As I said, before we start
making our good resolutions,

15
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,971
may I as your host
and as managing director

16
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:01,807
of Napier's International
Plantations,

17
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:04,743
known to you all
affectionately as NIP--

18
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:06,278
Hear, NIP.

19
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:09,081
Known to you all
affectionately as NIP,

20
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:13,051
may I say how glad I am
to see you all here tonight?

21
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:16,788
And to our friends
 in whose country

22
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:19,258
we are, I hope,
welcome guests

23
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:24,396
and in particular
to Senor Hernandez,

24
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,332
who has taken time off
from his ministerial duties

25
00:04:27,368 --> 00:04:31,403
to be with us tonight,
our best wishes
for the continued

26
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:34,239
peace and prosperity
     of this happy

27
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:37,042
and hospitable
      corner of the world.

28
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:41,446
Very good, HB. There.

29
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:44,216
Well, I think it's about time
       we got ready for
        Auld Lang Syne.

30
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:45,951
We shall have
      to have two circles,

31
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:48,120
one in this room
   and one in the other room.

32
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:50,188
And you'll help me round up
  the stragglers, won't you,
         Mrs. Bastian?

33
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:53,058
Leave it to me, HB. We'll
have to make two circles.

34
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:55,327
If everyone in there
will take that corner.

35
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:57,429
Herbert, you go and look
   after that circle.

36
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:00,098
And everyone here will
go into the other room,
we make another...

37
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:03,835
Ah, Mrs. Jordan, I'm sure
you wouldn't mind helping
my husband over there.

38
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,371
No, with pleasure.
And I'll help HB.

39
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,209
Come along,
              Senor Hernandez.

40
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:12,878
Now please
excuse me, Mr. Bryant,

41
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,346
I may have to leave.
I'm expecting a call.

42
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:16,214
But this will only
           take about a minute.

43
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,351
Ah, then it is not a religious
   ceremony, like cricket.

44
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:21,153
Oh, no, nothing
  of the kind.

45
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:22,921
No, it's just
an old English custom.

46
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:25,023
It's no good, senor.
              No good at all.

47
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:28,460
You're on the property
      of Napier's International
      Plantations,

48
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,529
known to us all
        affectionately as NIP.

49
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:33,765
And when boss Bryant orders
you into the chain gang,

50
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:35,967
into the chain gang you go.

51
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,170
And I have job
                 for Charlie.

52
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:43,508
Please, please.

53
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:47,045
Here we are into
  the magic circle.

54
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:48,580
Not this one, dear.

55
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:50,816
You promised to help
     Mr. Bastian, remember?

56
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,784
Oh, oh, oh, of course.

57
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,619
Come on, Tom.

58
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:57,656
Come on in, Mrs. Jordan.

59
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,458
That's it.

60
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:01,259
By the way, the wife
             and I were hoping

61
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:02,961
that you and Mr. J could
        come and take pot luck

62
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:04,463
with us tomorrow night.

63
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:06,465
HB is coming,
      but it's quite informal.

64
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,401
Oh, I'm sure we'd love to,
       wouldn't we, Tom?

65
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:11,370
You're all ready,
    Bastian?

66
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:14,306
Yes, HB.
                All together,
                everyone.

67
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:16,641
Wait for it.
              Wait for it.

68
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:19,144
There's a couple
     of minutes to go yet.

69
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:44,389
Tom...

70
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,059
Happy New Year.

71
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:53,932
Oh, Mrs. Jordan,
    a Happy New Year to you.

72
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,867
Happy New Year.

73
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:57,636
And you, too, Bryant.

74
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:59,304
And you needn't
            bother to kiss me.

75
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,773
Something might
             fly out of that...

76
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,141
Happy New Year to you.

77
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:06,411
You, too, sir,
             Mr. Hernandez.

78
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:09,481
Thank you.
      By the way, what are you?

79
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:11,182
Excuse me?
             In the government.

80
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,351
I mean, mines? Fuel?

81
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,954
Agriculture and fisheries?
I see.

82
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:19,024
No, I'm afraid mine is a more
humble position, Mr. Jordan.

83
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,859
I am justice.

84
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:32,737
<i>Adios, Rivera.</i>

85
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:34,973
Viva Zoreno!

86
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:39,477
You know, it's extraordinary
   how well you speak French.

87
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:45,283
It is not strange.
            I studied in Paris
            at the Sorbonne.

88
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:47,752
Ah!
Well, that explains it.

89
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:53,959
<i>Merci, madame.</i>

90
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:56,995
Excuse me, Mr. Bryant,
I find I must leave you now.

91
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,131
So soon?
    Yes, it is sooner
    than I expected.

92
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:01,533
I'm sorry.

93
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,435
Goodnight, Mrs. Jordan.
 Goodnight.

94
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,203
I hope we may meet again soon,
    at the opera perhaps.

95
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:07,138
Oh, I hope so.
           Goodnight.

96
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:08,473
Goodnight.

97
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:10,008
Do let me show
            you to the door.

98
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:11,643
Please don't bother.
     Goodnight, Mr. Bryant.

99
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:13,078
Goodnight
   and a Happy New Year.

100
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,846
Viva Rivera.

101
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:19,818
Viva Rivera.

102
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:21,987
Viva Zoreno!

103
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:47,712
Personally I find
    him charming.

104
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:50,115
Oh, do you know, Tom,
     that he speaks French

105
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,750
almost as well as English?

106
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:53,451
Mm-hmm, he does.

107
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,553
Napier's should appoint you,
        Mrs. Jordan,

108
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:57,455
as public relations
     officer.

109
00:10:57,491 --> 00:11:03,094
Yes, you'd make a splendid
      plantation hostess,

110
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,330
one of Bryant's nippies.

111
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:07,298
Oh, what an excellent
               idea, Tom.

112
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,200
Now when can I start,
               Mr. Bryant?

113
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:12,303
And what will be
                 your terms?

114
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:15,540
I never talk business
at parties, Mrs. Jordan,

115
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:17,542
and never
with beautiful women.

116
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:18,543
Aw.

117
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:20,412
Really?
         Extraordinary.

118
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,846
Now I should've thought--

119
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:23,281
That it was a marvelous
             opportunity.

120
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:24,883
I quite agree, Tom.

121
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:27,052
Now, Mr. Bryant,
     you can't get out of this.

122
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:29,821
Let's talk it over while
         we dance, shall we?

123
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,523
Delighted.

124
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,560
I'm so glad you don't
    mind my husband's

125
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:38,196
rather schoolboy
      sense of humor.

126
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:39,931
Oh, I know some people do,

127
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:42,867
especially rather
pompous people, you know.

128
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:44,936
On the contrary,
      I find him rather...

129
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:48,573
refreshing.

130
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,475
I'm so sorry
        that's over so quickly.

131
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,577
Tell me what part
        of France are you from?

132
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:54,679
Medoc.
Oh, the wine country.

133
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:56,781
Yes, my father
             had a vineyard.

134
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:59,017
As big as one
of our plantations?

135
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,519
Oh, I expect it is
      quite small really,

136
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:05,356
but it used to seem big to me,
as big as the whole country.

137
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:08,426
And you, of course,
was his princess.

138
00:12:08,462 --> 00:12:11,496
And then one day, a rather
 beaten-up representative

139
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:13,431
of the London suburban
wine company

140
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:16,534
came down the drive
     with dust on his shoes

141
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,738
and his suitcase full of empty
bottles and dirty shirts--

142
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:22,373
And they lived happily
            ever afterwards.

143
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,576
In a manner of speaking.

144
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:28,313
Well, it's getting
         frightfully late, Tom.

145
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:29,781
I think we ought
                to go home.

146
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:31,483
Let's.

147
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:33,618
Well, thank you so much.
It's been such a lovely party.

148
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:35,854
So glad you enjoyed it.
  Oh, yes, I did.

149
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:38,690
Let me show you around
Napier's one of these days.
        Oh, I should love it.

150
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:40,558
Mr. Bryant goes out
 of his way to keep

151
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:43,461
the staff happy and the wives,
   particularly the wives.

152
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:45,830
Tom, you are wicked.

153
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:48,399
When you've been out here
as long as I have, Jordan,

154
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,335
you may learn to mix
with our little community.

155
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,770
What the hell
       do you think I am?

156
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:53,671
A new boy,
comparatively speaking.

157
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:56,808
Three months,
 still in his first term, huh?

158
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:58,409
Waiting for you to teach me
the nicknames

159
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,411
of all the masters,
and what they call

160
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,914
the lavatories
in six form B.

161
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,616
Well, I know what the peasants
call you anyway.

162
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:05,984
Come on, let's get some air.

163
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,719
Goodnight.
Goodnight.

164
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:09,788
Thank you
         for the lovely party.

165
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:21,232
What's the matter?

166
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:24,235
Go on, tell me,
what's the matter?

167
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,705
Oh, I know, I behaved
 badly at the party.

168
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:29,908
But I always behave
 badly at parties.

169
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,611
What about that party?

170
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:36,714
That wine tasting party
your father gave, remember?

171
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,617
When I said I thought
  the 1953 vintage

172
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:42,220
reminded me of a rather
vivacious little cup of tea

173
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:45,790
that I found in the cafe
on the North Circular Road,
remember?

174
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:49,260
You laughed at that once.

175
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:51,095
It was a long time ago.

176
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:09,180
Tom.

177
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,885
Tom, coming to bed?

178
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,163
Coming to bed?

179
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,142
Tom...

180
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:42,013
it's a new year.

181
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:44,249
So they told us
             at the party.

182
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:50,722
And what's this,
            the thaw?

183
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:54,092
Oh, be different please.
            Try.

184
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:55,393
Different?

185
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:57,228
What do you mean
                "different"?

186
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:01,766
Stop being a child.
     What do you want me to be?

187
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:04,002
Grown-up and mature
               like Bryant

188
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:08,706
and all those idiots
with their funny hats.

189
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:11,643
Oh, God, it's starting again.

190
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,114
What are you smoking
    for anyway?

191
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:18,049
Oh, do you mind?

192
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,517
I thought
          if you had anything
          interesting to say,

193
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:20,718
I'd keep awake and listen.

194
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:22,353
What do you want me to say?

195
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:28,559
Just how you think we're going
to go on living together,
that's all.

196
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:32,196
If you can't live with me,
        that's your problem.

197
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:34,565
Oh, yes.

198
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:37,702
Oh, yes, it's always
my problem.

199
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:40,004
What were you
    doing when we met?

200
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,407
Buying wine for a firm
   that went broke.

201
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:46,244
Married to a woman who never
  cared what happened to you.

202
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,745
Oh, Gwen.
      Tch.

203
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,547
What a ridiculous name.

204
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:52,617
At least she liked me
            just as I was.

205
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:57,555
Hmm.
With the boyish charm.

206
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,557
Well, that's wearing
   a bit thin now

207
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:00,858
if you want to know the truth.

208
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:02,827
And I'll tell you the truth.

209
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:05,563
You always wanted me
different, didn't you?

210
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:07,498
You always wanted
             to change me.

211
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:09,901
Well, I didn't succeed.

212
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:11,703
In making a man of me?

213
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:15,473
Huh, you sound like some
     ridiculous headmaster.

214
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:18,309
Oh, it's not funny when you
 say those things anymore,

215
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:20,845
and it's not funny
when you're rude at parties.

216
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,414
Now, look, I can be rude
to who I like, you understand?

217
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,782
I'm free.

218
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,017
As far as being rude
is concerned,

219
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:28,252
I'm absolutely free.
No!

220
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:30,621
You've got a job to look after
  and a marriage, remember?

221
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:34,659
You make marriage sound
       like some bloody awful
       purchase agreement.

222
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:36,694
Pay up for 50 years,
it's yours when you die.

223
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:40,231
Oh! How can you say that
when I came with you,

224
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:43,067
when you didn't even have
a job or money or anything?

225
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:46,738
I came to that dreary hotel
to provide the evidence,

226
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:50,008
and the rooms we lived
in while you change jobs

227
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:52,643
and saved up to pay
for the cost of the divorce.

228
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,812
Nobody forced you.

229
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:58,616
Well, I did it because
         you were human

230
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:01,052
and you were funny
   and you were alive.

231
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:06,591
Not just angry
 with people for no reason

232
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:11,929
and hopeless for no reason

233
00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:17,001
and never doing anything
 that makes any sense.

234
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:25,843
We just can't go on.

235
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,479
We can't go on.

236
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:39,991
We could go on if you
   just be a wife.

237
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:42,660
A wife?

238
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:45,196
How could I be more
               of a wife?

239
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:48,366
Well, you can hate the same
people I hate for a start.

240
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:52,403
And then you can stay at home
and bath the children, maybe.

241
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:57,075
Do what?

242
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:01,279
Bath the children,
if you'd ever had any.

243
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,834
You see I'm trying to sleep.

244
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,471
I am sorry, darling.

245
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:28,206
Well, it's too late.

246
00:18:58,338 --> 00:18:59,670
Good morning, Gabriel.

247
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:01,606
Senor.
    You wish I to stay here.

248
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:05,209
Yes, of course.
  You will give me protection.

249
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:07,211
Gabriel, please,
this is not my day.
What are you talking about?

250
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:08,946
You had the guns
          last night.

251
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:10,848
When people hear that,
they go into the hills.

252
00:19:10,884 --> 00:19:12,216
My cousin
is on his way there,

253
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:15,052
but if he could
stay here 2, 3 days.

254
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:18,055
He can sleep in kitchen.
He's very good cook.

255
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:21,058
And another advantage,
he plays guitar.

256
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:24,162
All right.

257
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:26,030
Thank you, senor.
          Thank you.

258
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,800
What is all this about anyway?

259
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,702
We have a new president.

260
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:33,171
Oh, congratulation.

261
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:34,639
What's his name,
the new president?

262
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,507
General Zoreno.

263
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:38,309
Well, viva Zoreno.

264
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:40,211
Viva Zoreno

265
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:46,517
Viva Rivera.

266
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,673
Good morning.

267
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,675
Hello.
Where is everybody?

268
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,944
All our workers disappear
          into their holes

269
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:21,779
as soon as there's
             any trouble.

270
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:24,482
They'll be back
              in a few days.

271
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:28,019
In the meantime, we got
        a new face to look at.

272
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:29,854
Zoreno's?

273
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:33,024
Yes.

274
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:35,960
I've arranged for photograph
of him to be laid off.

275
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:38,429
Do we have to?
Just a little courtesy.

276
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,998
Napier's would like
  us to extend it.

277
00:21:41,034 --> 00:21:42,900
To the new man in power.

278
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:44,502
Exactly.

279
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:47,204
Is it over?

280
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,041
Bar the shooting?
Is there going to be
much more of that?

281
00:21:50,076 --> 00:21:52,677
I understand that Rivera
     has made a run for it.

282
00:21:52,712 --> 00:21:54,912
I heard it on the radio.

283
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:57,682
I expect they'll have
      caught him by now.

284
00:21:57,717 --> 00:22:01,886
There will be a trial,
of course, in the sports arena.

285
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:06,490
2,000 votes to none in favor
    of the extreme penalty.

286
00:22:06,526 --> 00:22:10,828
They always send their disused
presidents to the sports arena.

287
00:22:10,863 --> 00:22:12,496
You made it sound
  very quaint.

288
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:14,065
I'm sorry.

289
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,133
There's a lot to
            be said for Rivera,

290
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:19,070
provided we stick
          to theory, of course.

291
00:22:19,105 --> 00:22:20,805
Abolishing the death penalty.

292
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,206
Freeing the press.

293
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:23,874
Granting the vote
            to a lot of Indians

294
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,176
who could neither
              read nor write.

295
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:26,744
And then what happens?

296
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:28,846
The army takes over.

297
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:33,984
By the way, I see your friend
   Hernandez is with Zoreno.

298
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,020
Still minister of justice.

299
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:37,822
I always thought
            he was intelligent.

300
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,393
You better
             take one of these.

301
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:44,729
What's that for?
            Flag for your car.

302
00:22:44,764 --> 00:22:47,031
You may find it useful
     if there's any in trouble.

303
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:48,799
What am I supposed
   to do then?

304
00:22:48,835 --> 00:22:51,369
Salute and sing
    "Abide with me?"

305
00:22:51,404 --> 00:22:55,539
You know, I wish you
wouldn't make jokes.

306
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:58,142
It'd be far better
for your career with Napier's

307
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:00,378
if you were to stop
   making jokes.

308
00:23:00,413 --> 00:23:01,879
Jokes?

309
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:06,984
On my way here this morning,
          I saw a man.

310
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:08,919
He was running beside
        the car with his face

311
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:12,423
all dabbed with
           paint like a clown.

312
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,525
He kept on sort of clawing
            at the window

313
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,761
and then he screamed
 something I didn't understand.

314
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:18,996
Well?

315
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:20,765
They shot him.

316
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,601
You could have done nothing.

317
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:25,669
I could have stopped.

318
00:23:25,705 --> 00:23:28,973
Just as well for you
  that you didn't.
                         Why?

319
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:31,642
Because Napier's
        might have got in wrong
        with the new powers.

320
00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:36,580
You won't believe me, Jordan,
 but I was thinking of you.

321
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:43,754
Here you are, doctor.

322
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,156
Thanks.

323
00:23:46,726 --> 00:23:48,159
Beautiful, isn't it?

324
00:23:48,194 --> 00:23:50,194
You know, you're
         the only Napier's wife

325
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:52,530
that'd buy these things.

326
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:55,032
Go into the other houses
         and what do you get?

327
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:58,269
Plaster galleons
           in full sail.

328
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,573
Why do you want to see me?

329
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:11,949
I'm pregnant.

330
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:14,885
Well, congratulations
to you both.

331
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:16,387
But Tom doesn't know.

332
00:24:16,422 --> 00:24:18,088
I wanted
            to tell him that...

333
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:19,590
Oh, surely, that's
the wife's privilege.

334
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,559
Oh, no, no, no,
           not about the baby.

335
00:24:21,594 --> 00:24:26,130
I wanted to tell him
           that I'm going home.
Why?

336
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:28,299
Say that the climate
             doesn't suit me.

337
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:31,735
Tell him I can't stay
for medical reasons.

338
00:24:31,771 --> 00:24:34,805
Tell him that...

339
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:37,107
Oh, you know what to say.

340
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:38,909
What's the real reason?

341
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:43,981
I'm tired.

342
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:46,016
I'm sick of smiling
              and pretending

343
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:48,919
that all his sneers and insults
   are just school boy jokes

344
00:24:48,955 --> 00:24:51,622
I love to laugh at.

345
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:54,124
Last night he...

346
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,826
Yeah?

347
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:01,031
Last night he said
           that it was my fault

348
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:03,033
we didn't have any children.

349
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:05,503
Well, there's no reason
why you shouldn't have
a perfectly healthy baby

350
00:25:05,538 --> 00:25:08,305
if you take care of yourself.

351
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:13,844
I've had two miscarriages.

352
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,280
Each time we'd be moving.

353
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:18,182
Leaving a job that
           isn't grand enough

354
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:20,684
for his great,
        big personality.

355
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,920
Well, please,
will you tell him, doctor?

356
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,524
That's Tom.

357
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,559
Well, he's early,
                 isn't it?

358
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:31,061
I can't think what has
  happened unless...

359
00:25:31,097 --> 00:25:33,430
Unless what?

360
00:25:33,466 --> 00:25:36,433
Oh, nothing.
I'll leave you two together.

361
00:25:36,469 --> 00:25:38,469
You tell him,
     please, doctor.

362
00:25:46,445 --> 00:25:48,579
Hello, doctor?
               Anybody ill?

363
00:25:48,614 --> 00:25:50,814
No, I was passing.

364
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,149
You're home early.

365
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:53,551
Oh, plantation
           is all deserted.

366
00:25:53,586 --> 00:25:57,054
So I drove through the town.

367
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:59,089
Been a little rough
there I understand.

368
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:00,691
You could call it that.

369
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,960
They don't last, you know.
Never last very long.

370
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:04,828
But there are times out here

371
00:26:04,864 --> 00:26:06,997
when you have to look
in the opposite direction.

372
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:08,532
God, what a country!

373
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:10,534
Suits me.

374
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,836
Of course, it doesn't
suit everyone.

375
00:26:12,872 --> 00:26:14,238
Your wife for instance.

376
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:15,706
What's the matter?
              Is Claire ill?

377
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,675
Nothing, nothing
 to worry about.

378
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:21,111
But may I speak
to you as man to man?

379
00:26:21,147 --> 00:26:23,147
You know, the way
it strikes me I--

380
00:26:23,182 --> 00:26:26,150
Is it a go?

381
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:27,851
Yes, like a bomb.

382
00:26:27,887 --> 00:26:30,588
But talking of Claire,
I hope you won't think

383
00:26:30,623 --> 00:26:32,456
that I'm trying
   to interfere.

384
00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:33,757
I know it's none
of my business.

385
00:26:33,793 --> 00:26:36,193
It isn't really, is it?

386
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:38,329
Thanks for calling.

387
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:46,437
Who's that?

388
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:47,905
Goodbye, Mr. Jordan.

389
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,906
Who's it?

390
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,207
Rivera.

391
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:52,309
Riv...
      He's hurt.

392
00:26:52,345 --> 00:26:54,211
Shut up!
     You haven't seen anything.

393
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:56,780
Get inside the house.
What are you gonna do?

394
00:26:56,816 --> 00:26:59,416
I'm gonna get him
           off your front yard.

395
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:01,885
Why?
      Where to?

396
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:04,655
Just as far as those trees.
   I'll dump him over there.

397
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:07,057
Dump him?
You can't do that.

398
00:27:07,093 --> 00:27:08,859
Then what do you suggest?

399
00:27:08,894 --> 00:27:11,161
Well, take him in
the house, of course.

400
00:27:11,197 --> 00:27:13,831
You want us all shot?

401
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:16,200
Right, you do that, you go,

402
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:17,368
and I'll call the police
   and tell them that

403
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:19,136
he was in your car.

404
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:21,438
You don't understand
                this place.

405
00:27:21,474 --> 00:27:23,240
You're a doctor,
                 aren't you?

406
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:24,608
I'm not a suicidal idiot!

407
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:26,977
Shut up.
      You give me a hand.

408
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:28,646
Get him out this side.

409
00:27:28,681 --> 00:27:30,014
Easy now.

410
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,054
<i> Amigos?</i>

411
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:38,455
<i> Amigos.</i>

412
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:45,062
I'll take his legs.

413
00:27:45,097 --> 00:27:46,764
Easy now.

414
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,036
Well?

415
00:27:52,071 --> 00:27:55,339
Lost a lot of blood.
     I give him about 24 hours.

416
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:57,474
That shot will kill him?

417
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:00,477
I'm thinking of the next
       one he's due to receive.

418
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:02,813
Who's that?
You can trust him.

419
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:06,884
Can't trust anyone,
     if you want to stay alive.

420
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:09,520
Personally I do.

421
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:12,089
You may have your own private
reasons for giving it all up.

422
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:13,824
I still find
life really bearable.

423
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,564
Just a minute.

424
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:22,533
Can he be moved?
For the sake
of your health,

425
00:28:22,568 --> 00:28:24,802
get him out of here
as soon as you can.
                What about his?

426
00:28:24,837 --> 00:28:27,071
He needs rest.
I've done all I can.

427
00:28:27,106 --> 00:28:32,443
And-- And don't forget,
if anyone asks, I wasn't here.

428
00:28:32,478 --> 00:28:34,044
I didn't notice you anyway.

429
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:53,397
Feeling better?

430
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:56,934
Your house?

431
00:28:56,969 --> 00:29:00,437
You have been very kind.

432
00:29:00,473 --> 00:29:03,974
I will not trouble
you any longer.

433
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:05,976
Stay there.

434
00:29:06,011 --> 00:29:07,344
Gabriel?

435
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:09,313
Gabriel, now,
             I want you to lend

436
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:10,881
some of your clothes
             to the president.

437
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,317
It is an honor, senor.
   And then tell your cousin

438
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:15,452
to get something together
      for us to eat. Anything
      that's in the kitchen.

439
00:29:15,488 --> 00:29:17,855
Pack it up and put it
        in the back of the van.
  Yes, senor.

440
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:24,862
Where do you think
  you're going?

441
00:29:24,897 --> 00:29:26,563
To the frontier.

442
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:29,967
That's 100 kilometers.

443
00:29:30,002 --> 00:29:32,035
98.

444
00:29:32,071 --> 00:29:33,837
I will hide in your
             garden till night

445
00:29:33,873 --> 00:29:37,040
where I was till
I heard the trucks.

446
00:29:37,076 --> 00:29:40,410
I thought it will be
      safe in the doctor's car.

447
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:43,380
Must have fainted
               or something.

448
00:29:43,415 --> 00:29:45,048
Very inconsiderate of me.

449
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:49,953
Should I be caught,
no one here has seen me, Mr...

450
00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:51,421
Jordan.

451
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:53,157
And you're not
          going to get caught.

452
00:29:53,192 --> 00:29:55,592
I'm gonna hide you
where you're safe,
near the frontier.

453
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:59,696
And then when you feel more
like it, you can cross.

454
00:29:59,732 --> 00:30:02,666
You must feel strongly
   about politics.

455
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:08,539
Then why are you doing this?

456
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,608
I haven't thought yet.

457
00:30:14,747 --> 00:30:16,313
Gabriel, help the president
          get dressed

458
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:17,614
and then burn his clothes.

459
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:18,849
Everything that's his.

460
00:30:18,884 --> 00:30:20,117
Yes, senor.

461
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:24,688
Tom?

462
00:30:24,723 --> 00:30:26,490
And, Gabriel, be as quick
    as you can, too.

463
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:28,091
Oh, darling, I may go
back to Napier's again.

464
00:30:28,127 --> 00:30:30,727
There's no use arguing.
Something came up.

465
00:30:30,763 --> 00:30:32,896
It's rather important,
  it shouldn't take too long.

466
00:30:32,932 --> 00:30:34,565
I'll be as quick as I can,
and I'll be back--

467
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,966
Tom, aren't you going
  to say anything?

468
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,501
Aren't we going
    to talk about it?

469
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:39,002
Senor, he is ready.
     Good.

470
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:41,038
Help him into the car,
          would you, please?

471
00:30:41,073 --> 00:30:42,973
Darling, listen, nothing
       that should concern you.

472
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:46,210
What?
What needn't concern me?

473
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:51,481
Who is that man?
   What's been happening?

474
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:52,950
There's nothing
        for you to worry about.

475
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:55,185
We found a man outside
and he's badly hurt.

476
00:30:55,221 --> 00:30:57,054
So I'm gonna take him
  somewhere where he can rest.

477
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:59,923
Oh. Where?
              To Napier's.
           To the country club.

478
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:02,259
It's closed but--
Oh, does he work
for Napier's?

479
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:04,161
No, he's going to
         be sort of a guest.

480
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:06,129
Not that he's been
          invited yet, but...

481
00:31:06,165 --> 00:31:08,265
Well, I think it's better
  to call the hospital.

482
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,868
No, don't do that.

483
00:31:10,903 --> 00:31:12,603
<i>Tribulacion?</i>

484
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:14,171
I'm taking him to the club.

485
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,540
As a matter of fact,
I'll be doing him a favor.

486
00:31:16,575 --> 00:31:18,175
They'll have a chance
      to show their hospitality

487
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,743
to a genuine native.

488
00:31:19,778 --> 00:31:21,378
He'll be able
       to sit at the pool

489
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:23,413
and sleep in that
bed that Mr. Bryant

490
00:31:23,449 --> 00:31:25,115
uses for his weekend
             adventures.

491
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,117
Then when he feels
           a little bit better,

492
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:28,919
he can have a nice
      old English game of darts

493
00:31:28,954 --> 00:31:32,489
all by himself in the
       old English bar parlor.

494
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:35,092
If only you could be
serious for 5 minutes.

495
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:36,460
Try me when I get back.

496
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:38,328
I'm never serious
       till after dinner.

497
00:31:38,364 --> 00:31:39,730
I won't be here.

498
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:42,199
What do you mean?

499
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:47,738
I was going anyway.

500
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:51,708
I asked Dr. Swann
  to tell you.

501
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:54,978
I thought you'd come in
and we could talk sensibly.

502
00:31:55,014 --> 00:31:57,147
I thought we could be
    quiet until I went home.

503
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:58,582
Senor?

504
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:00,183
All right, Gabriel.

505
00:32:01,487 --> 00:32:03,587
Darling, look, I'll be back.

506
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:05,255
I'll be back
           and then we'll talk.

507
00:32:08,494 --> 00:32:10,694
Oh, Tom!
Tom, I've got to talk to you.

508
00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:14,064
You must listen to someone
else for once in your life.

509
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:17,100
Look, darling, this evening
   we'll go to the Bastian's

510
00:32:17,136 --> 00:32:18,702
and afterwards we'll talk.

511
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:21,271
You'll see, everything's
gonna be perfectly normal.

512
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:35,886
Just as if nothing
         had happened.

513
00:32:39,224 --> 00:32:40,691
There we are.

514
00:32:40,726 --> 00:32:42,893
Don't drink all the beer
before we get there.

515
00:32:42,928 --> 00:32:44,328
We'll celebrate after that.

516
00:32:44,363 --> 00:32:45,762
Give me the cover.
Right.

517
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:47,631
Just pop underneath that.

518
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:49,132
And by the way,
you better have a signal

519
00:32:49,168 --> 00:32:50,600
in case I want you to
keep your head down,

520
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:53,637
so I'll whistle at you, huh?

521
00:32:53,672 --> 00:32:54,905
What-- What tune?

522
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,607
Oh.
Pop goes the weasel.

523
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:02,813
Got it? Don't worry.
Everything's gonna
be all right.

524
00:33:02,848 --> 00:33:05,082
Right.
Fasten your seatbelts.

525
00:33:27,473 --> 00:33:29,339
Cosmopolitan Hotel?

526
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:32,242
Reception please.

527
00:33:32,277 --> 00:33:36,780
Hello, this is Mrs. Jordan,
Claire Jordan.

528
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:40,250
I would like to be on
the flight to Paris tomorrow.

529
00:34:19,258 --> 00:34:20,824
<i>Pase?</i>

530
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:23,627
Oh, pass.
           Look, I'm English.

531
00:34:23,662 --> 00:34:25,695
You saw the flag.
<i>Pase?</i>

532
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:28,465
I have an appointment
        at Napier's rest house.

533
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,967
Urgent business.
<i>Pase?</i>

534
00:34:31,003 --> 00:34:33,070
Look, I'm just going
           over the other side.

535
00:34:33,105 --> 00:34:35,172
It's about 5 or 6 kilometers,
 I'll be back in half an hour.

536
00:34:35,207 --> 00:34:37,774
<i> Pase!</i>

537
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:40,610
Sergeant, this man
is asking me for a pass.

538
00:34:40,646 --> 00:34:42,813
I have my...

539
00:34:42,848 --> 00:34:45,515
I got my international...

540
00:34:45,551 --> 00:34:47,884
international driver's
license.

541
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:51,855
Will that be all right?

542
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:59,262
Is this you?

543
00:34:59,298 --> 00:35:02,299
Yes. You know these
      passport pictures.

544
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:06,036
No one can cross the river,
  senor, without a pass.

545
00:35:06,071 --> 00:35:11,241
Look, I have an important
   appointment, I'm late.
   It's government business.

546
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:14,678
You must go to
the<i> ayuntamiento,</i> senor.

547
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:16,780
To the town hall?
<i>Si, senor.</i>

548
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:20,484
Can I get a pass there?
It's<i> posible,</i> senor.

549
00:36:07,266 --> 00:36:10,066
<i>Pase?</i>

550
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,873
Colonel Hernandez,
          have you a statement?

551
00:36:16,909 --> 00:36:18,308
And, colonel,
what about Rivera?

552
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:19,609
Have you got him?

553
00:36:21,313 --> 00:36:24,114
The date of his trial
   has already been arranged.

554
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:26,283
Naturally we expect
him to be present.

555
00:36:29,121 --> 00:36:31,488
Colonel-- Colonel Hernandez,
     we met last night.

556
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:32,822
Do you remember me?

557
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:34,357
I remember you, Mr. Jordan.

558
00:36:34,393 --> 00:36:37,727
Perhaps you can help me.
                     Perhaps.

559
00:36:37,763 --> 00:36:40,297
Well, I was trying to get
 a pass to cross the river.

560
00:36:40,332 --> 00:36:43,233
Why?
I have an appointment
at Napier's rest house.

561
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:44,701
Ah!

562
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:47,037
Important business
        at the nets perhaps.

563
00:36:47,072 --> 00:36:48,905
Whatever happens,
the English must not miss

564
00:36:48,941 --> 00:36:50,907
their games of catch.

565
00:36:50,943 --> 00:36:52,375
Well as a matter of fact,
     you guessed it.

566
00:36:52,411 --> 00:36:54,277
Is that your business
              appointment?

567
00:36:54,313 --> 00:36:56,780
Yes, next week is our big match
with non-ferrous metals.

568
00:36:56,815 --> 00:36:59,616
I mean, you mustn't expect
your revolution to
interfere with that.

569
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:02,686
After all, that's
the most important
event of the year for us.

570
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:05,055
What a dull year you
     must have, Mr. Jordan.

571
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,957
I don't suppose
          you'll make anything

572
00:37:06,992 --> 00:37:08,525
so serious as trouble.

573
00:37:11,096 --> 00:37:13,063
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

574
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:16,299
There.<i> Nombre.</i>
<i>Jordan.</i>

575
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,036
Here we are.

576
00:37:24,276 --> 00:37:26,743
<i> Bueno.</i>
               <i> Good. Thank you.</i>

577
00:37:26,778 --> 00:37:29,212
<i>Momento, senor.</i>
<i>We must look.</i>

578
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:30,847
Oh, they looked
       at the town hall.

579
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:33,183
It does not say
so on the pass, senor.

580
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:38,888
Oh, they probably forgot.
Open please the back.

581
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:40,523
It's locked.

582
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:42,792
Give me the keys, senor.

583
00:37:42,828 --> 00:37:45,895
I've lost them.
            Look, when I was--
Open please the back.

584
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:47,430
You have no authority
              to look.

585
00:37:47,466 --> 00:37:49,199
Open the back!
          Look, I'm British.

586
00:37:49,234 --> 00:37:51,434
I mean, I was checked
       at the town hall.

587
00:38:53,265 --> 00:38:54,998
From the Hotel Cosmopolitan?

588
00:38:55,033 --> 00:38:56,866
Senora Jordan?
                Oh, yes.

589
00:38:56,902 --> 00:38:58,835
We wish to speak
with your husband.

590
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,070
I'm afraid he's not here.

591
00:39:00,105 --> 00:39:02,238
We will wait.

592
00:39:02,274 --> 00:39:03,873
But I'm just going out.

593
00:39:03,909 --> 00:39:08,111
No, senora.
I think you're wrong there.

594
00:39:34,406 --> 00:39:35,672
Where are we?

595
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,741
Just across the river
             from my house.

596
00:39:37,776 --> 00:39:38,875
You can see it.

597
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:48,485
In that house?

598
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,053
I brought some
              people we know.

599
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:51,554
They have a boat.

600
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:54,023
I'll go and try
           and get my wife out.

601
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:55,759
If she's still there.

602
00:39:55,794 --> 00:39:57,394
Does she know about me?

603
00:39:57,429 --> 00:39:58,762
No.

604
00:39:58,797 --> 00:40:00,830
Do you think it
            might help her?

605
00:40:00,866 --> 00:40:02,665
But with Zoreno,
     I'm afraid.

606
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:07,804
All right.
               Take my watch.

607
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,272
If I'm not back
in half an hour,

608
00:40:09,307 --> 00:40:12,642
leave the car
        and you're on your own.

609
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:16,146
Thank you, Mr. Jordan.

610
00:40:28,727 --> 00:40:31,561
Herbert!

611
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,463
Look, you're not
           even dressed yet.

612
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:35,131
They'll be here
        at any minute.

613
00:40:35,167 --> 00:40:37,167
For goodness sake,
          go, get dressed.

614
00:40:54,853 --> 00:40:57,754
Ah.
I'm so sorry to be late.

615
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,522
That's all right.
The Jordans aren't here yet.

616
00:40:59,558 --> 00:41:02,692
Oh, really?
He didn't even
phone like you.

617
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:04,160
He lacks your polish.

618
00:41:04,196 --> 00:41:07,163
You have such wonderful
        manners, Hugo.

619
00:41:09,034 --> 00:41:11,401
Come in, HB.
             Hello.

620
00:41:11,436 --> 00:41:13,470
Come and have a little
 something for your cough, eh?

621
00:41:13,505 --> 00:41:17,540
We must go see about the meats.
It's too bad of the Jordans.

622
00:41:21,613 --> 00:41:22,846
Senor.

623
00:41:24,049 --> 00:41:25,482
They're here.

624
00:41:25,517 --> 00:41:28,184
Police?
      Soldiers with the senora.

625
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:36,092
Your husband
 went to work this morning.

626
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:38,695
Then what happened?

627
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:42,465
Come, Mrs. Jordan.
There is a limit
to our patience.

628
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:45,435
Mrs. Jordan,
do not try to put us off.

629
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:46,970
Did your husband
not drive his car?

630
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:52,175
Good evening.

631
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,710
Hello, darling.

632
00:41:55,514 --> 00:41:58,348
Well, look at all that ash.
    Filthy smoking habits.

633
00:41:58,383 --> 00:42:00,683
Mr. Jordan.
              Yes?

634
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:02,952
We have been waiting
for you, Mr. Jordan.

635
00:42:02,988 --> 00:42:05,555
Good, because I wish
     to lodge a complaint.

636
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:08,558
A complaint?
At Tribulacion at the bridge,

637
00:42:08,593 --> 00:42:11,294
some of your undisciplined
soldiers fired on my car.

638
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:13,162
I can only imagine
they were drunk.

639
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:15,965
You did not stop.
We had a report
from Tribulacion.

640
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:19,636
Of course, I didn't stop
for those trigger-happy idiots.

641
00:42:19,671 --> 00:42:23,373
What'd you expect me to do?
Stay and get shot?

642
00:42:23,408 --> 00:42:25,875
May even happen,
             this, Mr. Jordan.

643
00:42:25,911 --> 00:42:28,545
There was someone
with you, wasn't there?

644
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:31,848
I saw him leave,
       there was no one.

645
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:35,218
Look, there's
a perfectly good ashtray.
Will you mind?

646
00:42:35,253 --> 00:42:37,954
Did you or not have
               a passenger?

647
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:41,958
Answer us.
                Yes, I did.

648
00:42:41,993 --> 00:42:44,727
A strange sort of passenger
   that lies on a floor,

649
00:42:44,763 --> 00:42:46,329
hidden under a cloth?

650
00:42:46,364 --> 00:42:49,499
I thought that was
    rather eccentric myself.

651
00:42:49,534 --> 00:42:51,668
But then a solution
        occurred to me.

652
00:42:51,703 --> 00:42:53,469
I don't think he wanted
      me to know he was there.

653
00:42:53,505 --> 00:42:55,672
You did not know.

654
00:42:55,707 --> 00:42:58,608
Perhaps he crawled into the
van when it was in the garage.

655
00:42:58,643 --> 00:43:02,211
Maybe he wanted a free lift,
some tramp rather.

656
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:04,247
It's very amusing.

657
00:43:04,282 --> 00:43:06,516
Oh, it's true,
    they're always doing it.

658
00:43:06,551 --> 00:43:09,152
Tramps, women,
children, chickens,

659
00:43:09,187 --> 00:43:11,354
always crawling into cars.

660
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:13,456
You'd think they
want to live there.

661
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:20,163
Maybe it's the housing shortage
in your beautiful country.

662
00:43:20,198 --> 00:43:22,065
Well, are you satisfied,
gentlemen?

663
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,800
Not quite, Mr. Jordan.

664
00:43:23,835 --> 00:43:26,102
Where is your car now?

665
00:43:26,137 --> 00:43:28,071
In the garage, of course.

666
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,772
I didn't hear you drive up.

667
00:43:29,808 --> 00:43:33,142
Maybe because you
     were shouting so much.

668
00:43:33,178 --> 00:43:35,445
Now are you satisfied?
One more thing.

669
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,914
You have another
more thing to tell us.
             What's that?

670
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:40,049
Where is your passenger?

671
00:43:40,085 --> 00:43:41,517
He's still asleep I expect.

672
00:43:41,553 --> 00:43:43,186
Do you want to see him?

673
00:43:49,928 --> 00:43:51,628
No need
  for you to come, darling.

674
00:43:53,865 --> 00:43:55,632
Oh, I'd like some air.

675
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:07,443
Open quickly.

676
00:44:09,314 --> 00:44:10,880
Quickly.

677
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,326
What are you laughing about?

678
00:44:57,362 --> 00:44:59,595
Oh, it's marvelous,
     isn't it?

679
00:44:59,631 --> 00:45:01,297
I mean, you've
gotten thrown out

680
00:45:01,332 --> 00:45:03,399
of some strange places
   at quick notice,

681
00:45:03,435 --> 00:45:05,468
but you've never done
anything like this before.

682
00:45:05,503 --> 00:45:07,336
I try to keep you out of it.

683
00:45:07,372 --> 00:45:10,707
Oh, that's right.
Tom Jordan, the lone hero,

684
00:45:10,742 --> 00:45:13,643
with complete disregard
  for his own safety.

685
00:45:13,678 --> 00:45:15,845
He snatched his wife
from a nice clean bedroom

686
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:19,115
and saved a sick man
from going to hospital.

687
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:21,117
The regiment is proud of you.

688
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:27,724
Oh, I'm sorry.

689
00:45:27,759 --> 00:45:29,992
Oh, but let's be
sensible, Tom.

690
00:45:30,028 --> 00:45:32,195
We'll go straight
back to Tribulacion.

691
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,097
I'll go and see
Colonel Hernandez,

692
00:45:34,132 --> 00:45:35,798
and I'll explain
everything to him.

693
00:45:35,834 --> 00:45:37,667
Thank goodness,
   he's civilized.

694
00:45:41,439 --> 00:45:44,507
I think you're gonna
  miss your nice little laugh
  with Colonel Hernandez.

695
00:45:44,542 --> 00:45:46,743
Why?
            Because we're going
            to Los Indos River

696
00:45:46,778 --> 00:45:48,745
which is about 30 miles
             further on.

697
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:50,379
We'll cross that somehow,

698
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:52,115
and then we'll walk
             to the frontier.

699
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:55,218
Oh, I see.
Carrying a wounded man
with us, I suppose.

700
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:56,886
Yes, if he can't walk.

701
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:01,457
But I can walk, Mr. Jordan,
if you would stop the car.

702
00:46:02,393 --> 00:46:03,960
I owe you so much.

703
00:46:03,995 --> 00:46:05,962
Please spare me the pain
of causing unpleasantness

704
00:46:05,997 --> 00:46:08,064
between you and your wife.

705
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:10,833
You don't, and I'm not
         going to stop the car.
      Mr. Jordan, please.

706
00:46:10,869 --> 00:46:12,502
Look, it won't save
              us to drop you,

707
00:46:12,537 --> 00:46:14,170
you said that yourself.

708
00:46:14,205 --> 00:46:17,640
Yes, but you would travel
     light, much lighter.

709
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:20,476
Who are you?

710
00:46:20,512 --> 00:46:22,478
Oh, forgive my manners,
         Mrs. Jordan,

711
00:46:22,514 --> 00:46:24,380
I should have
introduced myself.

712
00:46:24,415 --> 00:46:25,882
Pedro Rivera.

713
00:46:25,917 --> 00:46:27,884
Who?

714
00:46:27,919 --> 00:46:32,789
Pedro Rivera, I am, I think,
  president of the Republic,

715
00:46:32,824 --> 00:46:35,925
I doubt if there was
time for an election.

716
00:46:37,328 --> 00:46:38,928
That was quite delicious.

717
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:40,997
Oh, the wife manages
  the fancy stuff, all right.

718
00:46:41,032 --> 00:46:43,566
It's the boiled egg
  we can't cook well, can we?

719
00:46:43,601 --> 00:46:45,935
Herbert.
        It's not the egg
        itself so much.

720
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:47,637
It's the time that seems
to be at fault.

721
00:46:47,672 --> 00:46:49,472
Really?
                   Herbert!

722
00:46:49,507 --> 00:46:52,675
It's either pure water
or of a rock like consistency.

723
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:55,378
Herbert, Mr. Bryant
      isn't interested in eggs.

724
00:46:55,413 --> 00:46:57,079
Yeah, there's a simple
 device on the market

725
00:46:57,115 --> 00:46:58,414
for checking the time of eggs.

726
00:46:59,851 --> 00:47:01,951
Ah, now that must
             be the Jordans.

727
00:47:03,221 --> 00:47:04,720
I hope he isn't tight.

728
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:08,724
Oh, good evening,
           colonel.

729
00:47:10,128 --> 00:47:14,130
Mr. Bryant, I am looking
   for one of your employees,

730
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:15,631
Jordan. Where is he?

731
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:17,200
Well, that's what
              we'd like to know.

732
00:47:17,235 --> 00:47:19,035
What's Jordan been doing?
   Some ridiculous joke?

733
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:21,037
I believe it's serious
to help a traitor escape.

734
00:47:21,072 --> 00:47:23,706
What?
A man was found
hiding in Jordan's car.

735
00:47:23,741 --> 00:47:25,608
Well, if he was found...

736
00:47:25,643 --> 00:47:27,710
Jordan drove off with him as
he was about to be arrested.

737
00:47:27,745 --> 00:47:29,846
We wish to find
    this enemy of the state.

738
00:47:29,881 --> 00:47:31,614
Who is he?

739
00:47:31,649 --> 00:47:34,116
Our ex-president.
                  Rivera?

740
00:47:34,152 --> 00:47:35,618
Yes.

741
00:47:35,653 --> 00:47:37,553
I bet you were member
          of his government

742
00:47:37,589 --> 00:47:38,754
when we last met, of course.

743
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:40,957
I was justice, Mr. Bryant.

744
00:47:40,992 --> 00:47:43,793
And justice does not change
      with governments.

745
00:47:43,828 --> 00:47:46,395
I believe that is true
        even in England.

746
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:50,199
So Mr. and Mrs. Jordan
are expected here.

747
00:47:50,235 --> 00:47:51,801
Quite a coincidence.

748
00:47:51,836 --> 00:47:54,070
Yes, but they
haven't come.
         We shall see.

749
00:47:54,105 --> 00:47:56,072
Is there no longer
 enough adventure

750
00:47:56,107 --> 00:47:58,908
for you in the manufacture
  of sugar, Mr. Bryant?

751
00:47:58,943 --> 00:48:00,676
Lopez.

752
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:08,651
Hey, colonel,
           what's the game?

753
00:48:08,686 --> 00:48:11,854
In England I believe
you call it hide and seek.

754
00:48:32,877 --> 00:48:35,311
You knew who he was,
     of course.

755
00:48:35,346 --> 00:48:37,747
Swann told me.

756
00:48:37,782 --> 00:48:40,216
The president.
  Does it make any difference?

757
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:42,985
Well, you could have told me.
 I'm not a child, you know.

758
00:48:43,021 --> 00:48:45,554
Oh, but no, everything
          has to be so secret.

759
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:47,189
You have to do everything
            on your own.

760
00:48:47,225 --> 00:48:49,292
Oh, for God's sake, I let
   one man get killed today,

761
00:48:49,327 --> 00:48:50,393
isn't that enough?

762
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:51,827
Besides...

763
00:48:51,863 --> 00:48:53,062
What?

764
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:55,464
Oh, nothing.

765
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,633
I need to find
a place to cross.

766
00:49:02,407 --> 00:49:04,240
Mrs. Jordan.

767
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:05,908
Yes?

768
00:49:07,478 --> 00:49:12,048
Mrs. Jordan, your husband
was worried about your safety.

769
00:49:12,083 --> 00:49:14,750
It would have been dangerous
   for you to know who I was.

770
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:23,025
Look, if you expect
anyone to be reasonable...

771
00:49:23,061 --> 00:49:25,161
I don't.

772
00:49:25,196 --> 00:49:28,931
I only hope we can all stay
  together for a short time,

773
00:49:28,967 --> 00:49:30,232
of course.

774
00:49:31,536 --> 00:49:33,069
Operator.

775
00:49:33,104 --> 00:49:35,538
Operator, you cut me
off three times already.

776
00:49:47,685 --> 00:49:49,952
What's happened?

777
00:49:49,988 --> 00:49:53,289
It seems a car has been hidden
  in your bushes, Mr. Bastian.

778
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:54,590
A car?

779
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:56,559
Mr. Bryant, you still say

780
00:49:56,594 --> 00:49:58,794
you know nothing
of Jordan's movements?

781
00:50:05,036 --> 00:50:07,937
There are people
             on the other side.

782
00:50:07,972 --> 00:50:10,172
They couldn't have
       got here already.

783
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:14,377
Could they?

784
00:50:16,547 --> 00:50:18,814
Oh, look, a fire.

785
00:50:21,786 --> 00:50:24,453
What would really happen
if they caught us?

786
00:50:24,489 --> 00:50:25,921
They're not going
             to catch us.

787
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:36,565
Farm workers
on their way to the hills.

788
00:50:36,601 --> 00:50:39,135
All right, then we'll cross
   as soon as it gets light.

789
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:41,037
Only if they've gone.

790
00:50:41,072 --> 00:50:42,738
Wouldn't it be safe
          with them?

791
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:45,975
I'll not be safe
if I was seen by anyone,

792
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:48,177
Mrs. Jordan,
 anyone at all.

793
00:50:52,183 --> 00:50:53,949
Let's eat.

794
00:50:59,724 --> 00:51:02,358
It's still
New Year's Day.

795
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:03,993
Yes, it is.

796
00:51:05,696 --> 00:51:11,600
A year ago today I was advised
 to have General Zoreno shot.

797
00:51:11,636 --> 00:51:14,203
You should
               have listened.

798
00:51:16,174 --> 00:51:18,274
Of course, if we were
   the Swiss Family Robinson,

799
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:20,042
I would find
   the dry martini tree

800
00:51:20,078 --> 00:51:22,111
and we'd all have
     a nice stiff cocktail.

801
00:51:22,146 --> 00:51:25,481
Well, when in doubt
              have a picnic.

802
00:51:30,955 --> 00:51:33,189
What a sad song.

803
00:51:33,224 --> 00:51:34,423
Cheese.

804
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:40,863
On the contrary,
   it is a song of happiness.

805
00:51:41,966 --> 00:51:44,266
But don't they care
    what's happening?

806
00:51:46,871 --> 00:51:50,339
They have seen
       too many changes.

807
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:56,946
When I was a child,

808
00:51:56,981 --> 00:51:59,548
I worked at one
of those farms.

809
00:52:01,886 --> 00:52:04,320
I had to wait
on the great landlord.

810
00:52:04,355 --> 00:52:05,521
Wherever he went all day,

811
00:52:05,556 --> 00:52:06,856
I have to stand
beside him

812
00:52:06,891 --> 00:52:10,960
with a tall glass
filled with ice.

813
00:52:12,296 --> 00:52:17,867
One night I woke up,
the dogs were barking.

814
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:22,371
A man had stolen something
from the big landlord

815
00:52:22,406 --> 00:52:27,676
and he had him half
buried in the ground

816
00:52:27,712 --> 00:52:31,580
and the horses
rode over him.

817
00:52:31,616 --> 00:52:33,249
They woke us up
and made us watch

818
00:52:33,284 --> 00:52:37,553
so we would learn
from his mistake.

819
00:52:39,023 --> 00:52:45,794
I grew up and I went away
and studied, studied.

820
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:51,467
And when I came back,
the dogs barked again.

821
00:52:53,638 --> 00:52:56,505
That same landlord,

822
00:52:56,541 --> 00:53:01,177
he was planted
in the ground

823
00:53:01,212 --> 00:53:03,646
and the horses
rode over him.

824
00:53:07,051 --> 00:53:11,987
All that studying to make
the dogs bark again.

825
00:53:12,023 --> 00:53:14,890
You know, different dogs,
of course, this time.

826
00:53:14,926 --> 00:53:17,092
But you had
    no part of that?

827
00:53:21,065 --> 00:53:23,699
What do you want,
          Mr. Jordan?

828
00:53:23,734 --> 00:53:26,402
A good reason
for saving my life?

829
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,680
Wake up, you don't
have to swim.

830
00:54:18,022 --> 00:54:19,555
I was dreaming
  about the room

831
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:23,058
I booked last night
 at the Cosmopolitan.

832
00:54:23,094 --> 00:54:26,295
Single and with bath.

833
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:27,696
What did you say?

834
00:54:27,732 --> 00:54:29,398
I said you
      don't have to swim.

835
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:32,468
The great river just about
     comes up to my knees,

836
00:54:32,503 --> 00:54:35,204
and it's firm
           gravel underneath.

837
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:37,406
So we can
            drive across.

838
00:55:22,086 --> 00:55:24,219
What the hell
    are you doing?

839
00:55:24,889 --> 00:55:25,921
He saw us.

840
00:55:25,956 --> 00:55:27,723
All right!

841
00:55:27,758 --> 00:55:29,258
It was a mistake.

842
00:55:29,293 --> 00:55:30,759
We should have
silenced the boy.

843
00:55:30,795 --> 00:55:32,761
He saw us.

844
00:55:34,699 --> 00:55:36,732
If you want to come
  with us get in the car.

845
00:55:36,767 --> 00:55:38,167
Come on.

846
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:34,189
We got to get out
        of here quick.

847
00:56:34,225 --> 00:56:35,624
I'll open the back.

848
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:48,557
Mr. Jordan.

849
00:58:48,592 --> 00:58:50,325
Mr. Jordan.

850
00:58:54,765 --> 00:58:55,964
Tom.

851
01:01:31,055 --> 01:01:32,921
That's my leg, Tom.

852
01:03:25,068 --> 01:03:28,303
One bar of chocolate
        and a corkscrew

853
01:03:28,338 --> 01:03:30,338
and no bottles
            to open.

854
01:03:30,374 --> 01:03:34,109
Well, at least
        they were worth saving.

855
01:03:37,548 --> 01:03:40,949
You are very angry
      with me, Mr. Jordan.

856
01:03:43,787 --> 01:03:46,321
I was only trying
to help.

857
01:03:46,356 --> 01:03:47,923
Trying to help?

858
01:03:49,059 --> 01:03:53,829
Not for myself,
       please understand.

859
01:03:53,864 --> 01:03:57,165
There are men, women,
and children there

860
01:03:57,201 --> 01:04:01,770
who will be shot
unless I can get out for help.

861
01:04:01,805 --> 01:04:06,842
And you, Mrs. Jordan,
and your husband,

862
01:04:06,877 --> 01:04:09,578
what is one boy
against so many?

863
01:04:10,914 --> 01:04:12,714
Perhaps it's true.

864
01:04:12,749 --> 01:04:14,883
Now if you think that's true,
  why are we doing all this?

865
01:04:14,918 --> 01:04:20,789
Please, let us
     forget about the boy.

866
01:04:20,824 --> 01:04:23,692
It's not so bad,
Mrs. Jordan.

867
01:04:23,727 --> 01:04:29,898
In those hills not very far,
there's a village, San Pablo.

868
01:04:29,933 --> 01:04:33,802
People there are still
my friends I think.

869
01:04:33,837 --> 01:04:36,872
They would help us
if we could reach them.

870
01:04:41,245 --> 01:04:43,411
Oh, Tom,
         he looks bad.

871
01:04:43,447 --> 01:04:44,713
He's alive,
isn't he?

872
01:04:44,748 --> 01:04:46,114
He's breathing.

873
01:04:46,149 --> 01:04:47,883
What else
does he expect?

874
01:05:47,811 --> 01:05:49,277
Let's go.
     Come on.

875
01:05:56,019 --> 01:05:59,688
Mr. Jordan,
          your watch.

876
01:05:59,723 --> 01:06:01,089
I've even lost
           your watch for you.

877
01:06:01,124 --> 01:06:02,390
Save your breath
   for the mountains.

878
01:06:02,426 --> 01:06:03,458
Come on now.

879
01:06:41,765 --> 01:06:43,999
We shall certainly
       catch them.

880
01:06:44,034 --> 01:06:45,600
Napier should
have financed

881
01:06:45,635 --> 01:06:47,402
the fatherland party,
Mr. Bryant.

882
01:06:47,437 --> 01:06:48,903
Not Rivera's escape.

883
01:06:48,939 --> 01:06:50,638
But we did not
                   do either.
             No.

884
01:06:50,674 --> 01:06:52,140
I'm afraid
   we won't believe that,

885
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:54,609
unless it's proved
at Rivera's trial.

886
01:06:54,644 --> 01:06:56,444
And if it isn't?

887
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,947
Napier's Plantation
            will be taken over

888
01:06:58,982 --> 01:07:00,849
for the benefit
                of the people.

889
01:07:00,884 --> 01:07:04,119
But we've given your people
  work, money, hospitals,

890
01:07:04,154 --> 01:07:05,854
and we've never
indulged in politics.

891
01:07:05,889 --> 01:07:08,556
Then you'd better
      start indulging now

892
01:07:08,592 --> 01:07:13,962
on the winning side
for a change.

893
01:07:13,997 --> 01:07:18,633
They must be trying to cross
the frontier to Bareya.

894
01:07:18,668 --> 01:07:21,269
You see, we know
they crossed the river.

895
01:07:21,304 --> 01:07:26,541
A boy was given a present,
a watch with the initials TJ,

896
01:07:26,576 --> 01:07:29,244
Tom Jordan, perhaps?

897
01:07:30,781 --> 01:07:33,515
They came from here,
              San Pablo.

898
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:34,883
No doubt
he helped them.

899
01:07:34,918 --> 01:07:37,786
The people there
are very backward.

900
01:07:37,821 --> 01:07:39,587
Of course, they may
           not have heard

901
01:07:39,623 --> 01:07:42,157
the good news
of our revolution.

902
01:07:42,192 --> 01:07:44,959
I think we shall have
 to announce it to them

903
01:07:44,995 --> 01:07:46,961
in a way they
     can understand.

904
01:08:10,053 --> 01:08:11,319
<i>Alto!</i>

905
01:08:34,544 --> 01:08:36,144
Mama!

906
01:09:12,716 --> 01:09:13,715
That...

907
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:16,184
That is San Pablo.

908
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:33,067
Are they looking
                    for us?

909
01:09:35,705 --> 01:09:37,705
Get in there.

910
01:09:37,741 --> 01:09:39,274
Come on.

911
01:10:01,731 --> 01:10:03,331
Do you think
  they saw us?

912
01:10:03,366 --> 01:10:05,934
I hope not.

913
01:10:05,969 --> 01:10:08,636
Do not be too worried,
          Mrs. Jordan.

914
01:10:08,672 --> 01:10:11,639
We are not so far
from the frontier.

915
01:10:11,675 --> 01:10:13,708
Well,
about that village?

916
01:10:13,743 --> 01:10:16,244
Can't we go there?

917
01:10:16,279 --> 01:10:18,846
We could, but...

918
01:10:18,882 --> 01:10:21,416
I'm afraid we might
bring them trouble.

919
01:10:40,403 --> 01:10:42,570
Thank you.

920
01:10:42,606 --> 01:10:44,639
Are you very tired?

921
01:10:47,377 --> 01:10:50,778
Can't be far now.

922
01:10:50,814 --> 01:10:52,580
Can't it?

923
01:10:56,319 --> 01:10:58,686
What are you
        thinking about?

924
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:04,359
How long we can live
on a bar of chocolate?

925
01:11:04,394 --> 01:11:06,394
We'll have plenty left
             for tomorrow.

926
01:11:10,533 --> 01:11:12,800
Tom, why can't we
  go to that village?

927
01:11:12,836 --> 01:11:16,804
I could go.
I mean I don't think
anyone will recognize me.

928
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:19,374
I mean nobody
could recognize me now.

929
01:11:19,409 --> 01:11:21,576
I could get food.
I can speak enough Spanish.

930
01:11:21,611 --> 01:11:23,144
I mean why not?

931
01:11:23,179 --> 01:11:24,812
Because it will be
         dangerous, that's why.

932
01:11:24,848 --> 01:11:26,414
Oh, Tom.

933
01:11:26,449 --> 01:11:28,716
Oh, you won't
      ever listen.

934
01:11:31,321 --> 01:11:34,889
Well, I'm sorry.

935
01:11:34,924 --> 01:11:36,424
Don't.

936
01:11:36,459 --> 01:11:37,525
Don't what?

937
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,294
Apologize.

938
01:11:41,264 --> 01:11:44,499
I know it went all wrong
           after that party.

939
01:11:48,171 --> 01:11:51,239
It seems
so long ago.

940
01:11:53,710 --> 01:11:56,544
No, Tom, no.

941
01:11:56,579 --> 01:11:59,647
I'm sorry but I really
don't feel like it.

942
01:12:01,584 --> 01:12:03,551
I thought it might
               be comforting.

943
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:08,923
It'll be more comforting
  if you could find us

944
01:12:08,958 --> 01:12:13,761
some food and water,
      or even a bed.

945
01:12:13,797 --> 01:12:16,064
Oh, Lord,
      I'm hungry.

946
01:12:19,202 --> 01:12:23,237
All right, then,
             let's go to sleep.

947
01:12:23,273 --> 01:12:26,474
Let's just go to sleep.

948
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:43,411
Oh, no.

949
01:14:43,446 --> 01:14:45,680
Oh, no, I just
want some food.

950
01:14:45,715 --> 01:14:47,582
Oh, just some food.

951
01:15:48,311 --> 01:15:50,678
You bloody
        little fool!

952
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:09,764
Mr. Jordan.

953
01:16:09,799 --> 01:16:12,800
Mr. Jordan,
please...

954
01:16:12,835 --> 01:16:14,368
I must rest.

955
01:16:22,712 --> 01:16:28,816
I remember once when
       my son was a little boy,

956
01:16:28,851 --> 01:16:31,218
I took him
                   to a fiesta.

957
01:16:31,254 --> 01:16:33,421
Hundreds of Indians
               came to town,

958
01:16:33,456 --> 01:16:34,989
galloping on horses

959
01:16:35,024 --> 01:16:37,491
and my little boy
            let go off my hand

960
01:16:37,527 --> 01:16:39,427
and ran out among
          those great hooves.

961
01:16:39,462 --> 01:16:43,931
I called him to return,
        but he would not come.

962
01:16:43,967 --> 01:16:46,701
I was sure
            he would be killed.

963
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:49,737
The horses passed,

964
01:16:49,772 --> 01:16:52,506
and there was my little boy
        alive and well.

965
01:16:52,542 --> 01:16:58,346
I ran over to him
         and I struck him hard.

966
01:16:58,381 --> 01:17:03,651
It was out
      of great relief and love,

967
01:17:03,686 --> 01:17:07,355
but my little boy
     could not understand that.

968
01:17:41,524 --> 01:17:44,792
It's gonna rain.
Of course.

969
01:17:44,827 --> 01:17:46,794
What do you mean
               "of course"?

970
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:52,700
This is the temple of the god
   of rain and fertility.

971
01:17:52,735 --> 01:17:56,303
We shall have
a feast in his honor.

972
01:18:03,846 --> 01:18:06,747
Mexican enchilada,

973
01:18:09,752 --> 01:18:13,921
roast beef
with Yorkshire pudding.

974
01:18:16,125 --> 01:18:17,725
Mine.

975
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:19,994
Where's mine?

976
01:18:20,029 --> 01:18:22,430
You're busy eating it.

977
01:18:22,465 --> 01:18:24,231
He's eating
my chocolate.

978
01:18:24,267 --> 01:18:25,599
He's eating my chocolate!

979
01:18:25,635 --> 01:18:27,702
That's mean,
            that's disgusting!

980
01:18:27,737 --> 01:18:29,804
That little piece of chocolate
    and now he's eating it!

981
01:18:29,839 --> 01:18:31,739
I've been thinking
            about it all day,

982
01:18:31,774 --> 01:18:35,109
that little piece of chocolate
    and now he's eating it.

983
01:18:35,144 --> 01:18:36,444
Please,
Mrs. Jordan.

984
01:18:36,479 --> 01:18:38,713
Darling,
this is your piece.

985
01:18:58,668 --> 01:19:03,070
Look at the rain,
   it's like England.

986
01:19:03,106 --> 01:19:05,973
You remember when
we first arrived in England,

987
01:19:06,008 --> 01:19:08,642
and you were expecting to find
a country full of green lawns

988
01:19:08,678 --> 01:19:13,180
and stately homes and tall
titled men in tweed suits,

989
01:19:13,216 --> 01:19:15,649
making witty remarks and
eating cucumber sandwiches.

990
01:19:15,685 --> 01:19:16,917
Hmm.

991
01:19:16,953 --> 01:19:18,753
You remember
the first few weeks all we did

992
01:19:18,788 --> 01:19:21,689
was sit in the railway hotel
    and watch the rain,

993
01:19:21,724 --> 01:19:23,791
pouring down
on Pennington station

994
01:19:23,826 --> 01:19:26,193
and not a lord
came near us.

995
01:19:27,530 --> 01:19:30,097
I'm sorry.
         I'm so sorry.

996
01:19:30,133 --> 01:19:31,565
That's all right.
         I didn't know
         what happened.

997
01:19:31,601 --> 01:19:32,800
That's all right.

998
01:19:32,835 --> 01:19:34,702
It was awful.

999
01:20:12,842 --> 01:20:15,342
Tom?

1000
01:20:15,378 --> 01:20:16,644
Tom?

1001
01:20:16,679 --> 01:20:19,747
I see a cactus.

1002
01:20:34,297 --> 01:20:36,664
I found something
     to eat.

1003
01:20:42,872 --> 01:20:44,471
No, Mrs. Jordan,
you first.

1004
01:20:44,507 --> 01:20:45,673
Oh, no, no.

1005
01:20:45,708 --> 01:20:47,441
You eat it first,
please.

1006
01:20:47,476 --> 01:20:49,243
You are always
   so kind.

1007
01:20:49,278 --> 01:20:51,579
Are we
             anywhere near yet?

1008
01:20:55,017 --> 01:20:56,684
That is Bareya.

1009
01:20:56,719 --> 01:20:59,286
You would cross
 is the frontier.

1010
01:20:59,322 --> 01:21:01,689
We always used
to argue about it.

1011
01:21:02,992 --> 01:21:06,694
I'll go down when
     it gets dark, take a look.

1012
01:21:25,715 --> 01:21:31,685
Your husband does not
approve of me, Mrs. Jordan,

1013
01:21:31,721 --> 01:21:34,421
since the matter
     of the boy.

1014
01:21:34,457 --> 01:21:36,790
No, he doesn't.

1015
01:21:39,228 --> 01:21:42,029
He's a very pure man.

1016
01:21:42,064 --> 01:21:47,234
Or shall I say,
a man of high ideals?

1017
01:21:47,270 --> 01:21:50,337
Tom?
          Is he pure?

1018
01:21:50,373 --> 01:21:54,842
For him things have to
be either right or wrong.

1019
01:21:54,877 --> 01:22:02,917
If they are a little mixed,
he is disgusted, he gets sick.

1020
01:22:02,952 --> 01:22:05,319
He saw the good
  in revolution,

1021
01:22:05,354 --> 01:22:09,623
but difficult to work
 within the cabinet.

1022
01:22:11,594 --> 01:22:13,761
Did you hear
           anything?

1023
01:22:16,098 --> 01:22:20,634
Women and prime ministers
have to be a little complicated

1024
01:22:20,670 --> 01:22:23,337
to survive,
 isn't that right?

1025
01:22:25,474 --> 01:22:30,678
But, you know,
men like your husband,

1026
01:22:30,713 --> 01:22:33,180
they are better
   than us.

1027
01:22:36,519 --> 01:22:39,153
It's well guarded,
           but we can do it
           now it's dark.

1028
01:22:39,188 --> 01:22:42,289
Let's spread out in the woods,
     very thick all around.

1029
01:22:42,325 --> 01:22:43,457
So we've done it.

1030
01:22:43,492 --> 01:22:47,294
We saved you.

1031
01:22:47,330 --> 01:22:49,797
Why, Mr. Jordan?

1032
01:22:49,832 --> 01:22:53,300
That I cannot
understand.

1033
01:22:53,336 --> 01:22:55,769
Just a small
private feeling.

1034
01:23:08,551 --> 01:23:10,985
They are-- They are
nice, those feelings,

1035
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:15,622
but they never
stay private.

1036
01:23:15,658 --> 01:23:18,425
I'm a politician,
understand.

1037
01:23:18,461 --> 01:23:21,929
In the end I may do worse
for you than losing your job

1038
01:23:21,964 --> 01:23:25,232
or your home
or even your watch.

1039
01:23:25,267 --> 01:23:27,901
Like what?

1040
01:23:27,937 --> 01:23:31,338
I may confuse you,
          Mr. Jordan.

1041
01:23:47,890 --> 01:23:50,324
We've been waiting
           for you, Mr. Jordan.

1042
01:24:03,639 --> 01:24:05,339
What did he say?

1043
01:24:05,374 --> 01:24:07,674
He says now we've found him,
    that's all we wanted

1044
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:09,977
and now we should
   let you go.

1045
01:24:10,012 --> 01:24:12,780
Those are not
 my orders.

1046
01:24:12,815 --> 01:24:14,448
What are
             your orders?

1047
01:24:14,483 --> 01:24:17,684
To bring you to the justice
of the people, all of you.

1048
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:20,954
A nice public trial
            in the sports arena?

1049
01:24:20,990 --> 01:24:23,791
You will be
   allowed a trial.

1050
01:24:23,826 --> 01:24:25,592
Can you guess
         the verdict?

1051
01:24:25,628 --> 01:24:27,161
Naturally the verdict
   is well known.

1052
01:24:27,196 --> 01:24:28,896
You mean,
         we'll be shot?

1053
01:24:28,931 --> 01:24:31,799
So why the hell
didn't you say so?

1054
01:24:31,834 --> 01:24:34,635
Oh, I can't wait
to hear the prosecutor.

1055
01:24:34,670 --> 01:24:36,336
When's
the tumbler due?

1056
01:24:36,372 --> 01:24:37,838
The what?

1057
01:24:37,873 --> 01:24:40,607
The track-- the transport
       to take us back.

1058
01:24:40,643 --> 01:24:42,042
It's waiting
       on the main road.

1059
01:24:42,078 --> 01:24:43,911
We're going
to leave now.

1060
01:24:43,946 --> 01:24:46,380
Just a minute.

1061
01:24:46,415 --> 01:24:48,549
What about my wife?
Your wife?

1062
01:24:48,584 --> 01:24:52,186
She's been traveling
  for 2 days without any food.

1063
01:24:52,221 --> 01:24:55,389
A peasant might treat
         a woman like that.

1064
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:56,890
A peasant?

1065
01:24:56,926 --> 01:24:59,793
Yes, a stupid,
            brutal peasant.

1066
01:25:04,867 --> 01:25:07,201
Senora,
  my name is Gomez.

1067
01:25:07,236 --> 01:25:10,537
My family has a fine tradition
    of courtesy to women.

1068
01:25:10,573 --> 01:25:12,739
All right.
So your mother's a woman.

1069
01:25:12,775 --> 01:25:14,541
Now ask my wife
                if she's tired.

1070
01:25:14,577 --> 01:25:16,343
I was about
     to do so.

1071
01:25:16,378 --> 01:25:20,047
There's no need
for a foreigner to remind me.

1072
01:25:22,384 --> 01:25:24,151
Are you tired,
        senora?

1073
01:25:24,186 --> 01:25:26,453
I'm pregnant.

1074
01:25:34,697 --> 01:25:36,130
If you wish
        to stay here the night,

1075
01:25:36,165 --> 01:25:38,365
we will take turns
                to guard you.

1076
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:39,833
Thank you.

1077
01:25:47,676 --> 01:25:51,178
Yes, Mr. Bryant, Rivera has
 been caught where I expected,

1078
01:25:51,213 --> 01:25:54,248
here, at the frontier
               to Bareya.

1079
01:25:54,283 --> 01:25:58,485
Congratulations, and thank you
 for letting me know so soon.

1080
01:25:58,521 --> 01:25:59,686
That's a splendid news.

1081
01:25:59,722 --> 01:26:01,054
For us, yes.

1082
01:26:01,090 --> 01:26:02,756
But not for you,
                  Mr. Bryant.

1083
01:26:02,791 --> 01:26:04,158
What do you mean?

1084
01:26:04,193 --> 01:26:07,694
Rivera had
     two companions.

1085
01:26:07,730 --> 01:26:10,097
Wait till I see
             that fool Jordan.

1086
01:26:10,132 --> 01:26:12,099
You will see him
        very soon.

1087
01:26:12,134 --> 01:26:15,102
Meanwhile you will
  have to wait here.

1088
01:26:15,137 --> 01:26:16,303
But I'm so sorry, I have
         a rather important--

1089
01:26:16,338 --> 01:26:18,372
I said here.

1090
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:00,147
What made you think
              of that story?

1091
01:27:01,450 --> 01:27:02,916
What?

1092
01:27:04,587 --> 01:27:06,520
About being pregnant.

1093
01:27:10,392 --> 01:27:11,625
It's true.

1094
01:27:36,585 --> 01:27:39,553
Wake up Rivera.
What?

1095
01:27:39,588 --> 01:27:44,391
Wake him up, and get ready
        to make a run for it.

1096
01:28:06,348 --> 01:28:09,916
I just wanted
 to thank you

1097
01:28:09,952 --> 01:28:13,520
for being
so kind to my wife.

1098
01:28:13,555 --> 01:28:15,689
There aren't many people
 under the circumstance

1099
01:28:15,724 --> 01:28:17,724
who'd be
 so understanding.

1100
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:22,195
That's all right.
    How is your wife?

1101
01:28:22,231 --> 01:28:24,264
Is she resting well?
Oh, yes, thank you.

1102
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:26,300
As well
as can be expected.

1103
01:28:29,138 --> 01:28:33,106
You mustn't think I don't
 understand family matters.

1104
01:28:34,109 --> 01:28:35,942
I'm married, too,
           you know.

1105
01:28:35,978 --> 01:28:37,210
You are?

1106
01:28:37,246 --> 01:28:39,446
Yes.

1107
01:28:39,481 --> 01:28:43,417
My own wife gave me
a boy just 3 months ago.

1108
01:28:43,452 --> 01:28:48,388
Would you be interested
to see a picture I've got?

1109
01:28:48,424 --> 01:28:50,023
I'd love to.

1110
01:28:50,059 --> 01:28:52,626
I've got it here
       in my wallet.

1111
01:28:54,096 --> 01:28:56,963
Wife and baby
          together.

1112
01:28:56,999 --> 01:28:59,566
Where is it?

1113
01:28:59,601 --> 01:29:01,568
Oh, here it is.

1114
01:29:03,372 --> 01:29:05,639
He has a fine
                   loud voice.

1115
01:29:05,674 --> 01:29:08,075
We believe he's been
        destined for the opera.

1116
01:29:08,110 --> 01:29:10,310
Basso profondo,

1117
01:29:32,835 --> 01:29:34,801
Ah, good.

1118
01:29:34,837 --> 01:29:37,504
The cup that cheers, no?

1119
01:29:37,539 --> 01:29:40,173
Tell me, you find our
people good workers?

1120
01:29:40,209 --> 01:29:43,677
First rate. Of course,
         we give them plenty
         of responsibility.

1121
01:29:43,712 --> 01:29:46,179
But we make absolutely
             no distinction

1122
01:29:46,215 --> 01:29:48,882
between the British
               and the...
Natives?

1123
01:29:48,917 --> 01:29:50,984
Well, of course, we don't
      actually call them that.

1124
01:29:51,019 --> 01:29:55,088
Why not? We call you
<i>extranos,</i> outsiders.

1125
01:29:55,124 --> 01:29:57,491
And which
     of the natives

1126
01:29:57,526 --> 01:30:00,594
would you trust most
to run the plantation?

1127
01:30:00,629 --> 01:30:02,896
Let me see.

1128
01:30:02,931 --> 01:30:04,598
Well, I've got
                  a lot of time

1129
01:30:04,633 --> 01:30:08,001
for my assistant,
             Rafael Trujo.

1130
01:30:08,036 --> 01:30:09,503
Sometimes I think
               he knows more

1131
01:30:09,538 --> 01:30:11,972
about the job
              than I do myself.

1132
01:30:12,007 --> 01:30:14,408
Rafael Trujo.
Good.

1133
01:30:14,443 --> 01:30:18,211
I must make
a note of that name.

1134
01:30:18,247 --> 01:30:20,113
I'm afraid you're
going to find England

1135
01:30:20,149 --> 01:30:22,315
rather cold
after this, Mr. Bryant.

1136
01:30:22,351 --> 01:30:24,718
One must be aware
of sudden change of climate.

1137
01:31:03,625 --> 01:31:05,292
They've escaped.

1138
01:31:05,327 --> 01:31:07,027
No doubt they would have
crossed the frontier by now.

1139
01:31:07,062 --> 01:31:08,562
Jordan killed
 one of my men.

1140
01:31:08,597 --> 01:31:10,664
As his chief,
I'm holding you responsible.

1141
01:31:10,699 --> 01:31:12,566
But you can't do that,
        I'm a British subject.
Whoever you are,

1142
01:31:12,601 --> 01:31:14,267
you can be tried as
   an accessory to a murder.

1143
01:31:14,303 --> 01:31:15,936
But how do you know
   it's Jordan?

1144
01:31:15,971 --> 01:31:17,170
It might be Rivera.

1145
01:31:17,206 --> 01:31:18,472
Rivera?

1146
01:31:18,507 --> 01:31:20,140
That failed man.

1147
01:31:22,411 --> 01:31:23,844
Rivera...

1148
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:33,286
Mr. Bryant.

1149
01:31:37,926 --> 01:31:39,693
Please sit down.

1150
01:31:50,205 --> 01:31:54,508
I might give you
and Napier's one last chance.

1151
01:31:54,543 --> 01:31:56,209
Please.

1152
01:32:00,849 --> 01:32:04,017
I want evidence from Jordan
that Rivera killed my man.

1153
01:32:04,052 --> 01:32:05,118
I want it clear,
do you understand?

1154
01:32:05,153 --> 01:32:06,720
No doubts about it.

1155
01:32:09,258 --> 01:32:11,424
I want the world to know

1156
01:32:11,460 --> 01:32:15,328
that the poor old refugee
is a common criminal,

1157
01:32:15,364 --> 01:32:19,332
stabs a young man in the dark,
     tries to kill a child.

1158
01:32:19,368 --> 01:32:24,538
That poor child,
 a terrible story, Mr. Bryant.

1159
01:32:24,573 --> 01:32:26,439
Then they'll have
              to send him back.

1160
01:32:26,475 --> 01:32:28,441
No one is going
to protest

1161
01:32:28,477 --> 01:32:31,411
or shed tears
           in the sports arena.

1162
01:32:31,446 --> 01:32:35,315
Yes. You are going to talk
       to Jordan, Mr. Bryant.

1163
01:32:35,350 --> 01:32:38,418
In that way you might save
your precious plantations.

1164
01:32:41,757 --> 01:32:45,959
So you are going
     on a short journey.

1165
01:32:45,994 --> 01:32:48,962
You'll be ready
        in half an hour.

1166
01:32:50,599 --> 01:32:53,266
And Vidal here
         will keep you company.

1167
01:32:56,305 --> 01:33:01,374
Remember, accidents can
happen even in Bareya.

1168
01:33:13,522 --> 01:33:14,788
Tom.

1169
01:33:17,392 --> 01:33:19,793
Well, he's in a room
   just below us.

1170
01:33:19,828 --> 01:33:20,994
The doctor's
on his way.

1171
01:33:21,029 --> 01:33:22,429
Oh, good.

1172
01:33:22,464 --> 01:33:23,997
Gosh, I hope he's going
to be all right.

1173
01:33:24,032 --> 01:33:26,099
Aw.
        Well, he's safe anyway.

1174
01:33:26,134 --> 01:33:27,767
Yes.

1175
01:33:27,803 --> 01:33:30,203
But we can't keep him
       with us forever, can we?

1176
01:33:30,238 --> 01:33:31,671
No, that's true.

1177
01:33:36,878 --> 01:33:38,411
Ooh!

1178
01:33:38,447 --> 01:33:42,415
Something's got to be
done about this hair.

1179
01:33:42,451 --> 01:33:43,917
When we get home,

1180
01:33:43,952 --> 01:33:46,086
would you like it
if I suddenly went blond?

1181
01:33:47,756 --> 01:33:49,923
When we get home,
      I got to find a job.

1182
01:33:49,958 --> 01:33:52,492
Something tells me
I'm not exactly going to get

1183
01:33:52,527 --> 01:33:57,330
a letter of congratulations
at Napier's.

1184
01:33:58,867 --> 01:34:01,901
Another job bitched up, is
that what you were gonna say?

1185
01:34:07,242 --> 01:34:09,542
No.

1186
01:34:09,578 --> 01:34:11,344
I wasn't going
          to say that.

1187
01:34:21,490 --> 01:34:23,723
Turn it off
                  for God sake!

1188
01:34:27,663 --> 01:34:29,663
What is it?
                   Oh, God.

1189
01:34:29,698 --> 01:34:31,731
What is it?
What is it, darling?

1190
01:34:31,767 --> 01:34:33,667
Tell me.

1191
01:34:33,702 --> 01:34:34,734
Oh, Tom.

1192
01:34:34,770 --> 01:34:37,470
Tom.

1193
01:34:37,506 --> 01:34:39,105
The best
             singer, the opera,

1194
01:34:39,141 --> 01:34:42,175
that's what he said
       he wanted his son to be.

1195
01:34:42,210 --> 01:34:44,944
Showed me a picture.

1196
01:34:44,980 --> 01:34:47,747
Oh!

1197
01:34:47,783 --> 01:34:49,282
Oh.

1198
01:34:49,317 --> 01:34:52,085
It's all over, Tom.

1199
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:54,487
It's all over now.

1200
01:35:07,436 --> 01:35:09,069
Oh, Tom.

1201
01:35:36,565 --> 01:35:37,997
Where's the president?

1202
01:35:38,033 --> 01:35:39,399
No say.

1203
01:35:39,434 --> 01:35:40,533
Where have they
                 moved him to?

1204
01:35:40,569 --> 01:35:44,037
No say, senor.

1205
01:35:51,179 --> 01:35:52,645
Where is President Rivera?

1206
01:35:52,681 --> 01:35:54,614
He was taken away
     in an ambulance

1207
01:35:54,649 --> 01:35:57,550
to Santa Maria Hospital.
                          Oh.

1208
01:35:57,586 --> 01:35:59,519
When my wife calls down,
      tell her I've gone there.

1209
01:35:59,554 --> 01:36:01,454
Yes, of course, sir.
          Thank you.

1210
01:36:01,490 --> 01:36:04,557
Congratulations on
      your journey, Mr. Jordan.

1211
01:36:04,593 --> 01:36:07,927
I hope you won't find
        it was a waste of time.

1212
01:36:25,514 --> 01:36:28,381
Just a minute.

1213
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:29,783
Where are you
  taking him?

1214
01:36:29,818 --> 01:36:31,551
We're trying
            to treat him.

1215
01:36:31,586 --> 01:36:33,453
This is a hospital,
          haven't you noticed?

1216
01:36:33,488 --> 01:36:35,188
Not a place for
     a political demonstration.

1217
01:36:35,223 --> 01:36:37,157
Are you
              another reporter?

1218
01:36:37,192 --> 01:36:39,592
No, I just
brought him here.

1219
01:36:39,628 --> 01:36:41,895
Now just leave him
             to us, will you?

1220
01:36:41,930 --> 01:36:44,464
Just leave him to us.

1221
01:36:44,499 --> 01:36:46,466
He was a great man,
       Mr. Jordan.

1222
01:36:46,501 --> 01:36:47,834
What did you say?

1223
01:36:47,869 --> 01:36:50,103
He was a great man,
      Rivera.

1224
01:36:50,138 --> 01:36:51,604
I never really knew.

1225
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:54,207
Not that
it will help him.

1226
01:36:54,242 --> 01:36:55,975
What do you mean?

1227
01:36:56,011 --> 01:36:58,411
It's only a very short flight
  from here to Tribulacion.

1228
01:36:58,446 --> 01:37:01,981
But they can't send him back,
  he is a political refugee.

1229
01:37:02,017 --> 01:37:05,084
A great embarrassment
to the president of Bareya.

1230
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:06,920
Now, Mr. Jordan, I represent
    News International.

1231
01:37:06,955 --> 01:37:08,221
Perhaps you
would be so kind--

1232
01:37:08,256 --> 01:37:09,889
Oh, Jordan.

1233
01:37:12,694 --> 01:37:14,527
Good to see you again.
Come sit down,

1234
01:37:14,563 --> 01:37:16,029
there's something I want
to talk to you about.

1235
01:37:16,064 --> 01:37:19,632
You know you've got us
into a pretty bad jab.

1236
01:37:19,668 --> 01:37:23,036
But quite frankly, and
speaking off the record,

1237
01:37:23,071 --> 01:37:26,206
I must say I feel the sneaky
    sort of admiration.

1238
01:37:26,241 --> 01:37:29,542
I mean I might well
have done the same thing

1239
01:37:29,578 --> 01:37:31,911
if I found you dumped
   on my doorstep.

1240
01:37:31,947 --> 01:37:33,146
You might?

1241
01:37:43,692 --> 01:37:45,358
What do you want?

1242
01:37:45,393 --> 01:37:46,526
Oh, it's just this.

1243
01:37:46,561 --> 01:37:49,162
It's very simple.

1244
01:37:49,197 --> 01:37:51,631
Keep the local boys happy

1245
01:37:51,666 --> 01:37:55,034
and it would help if you'd
sign to correct the record.

1246
01:37:55,070 --> 01:37:56,970
It's a mere formality.

1247
01:38:02,677 --> 01:38:05,845
Ah, the beautiful
  Mrs. Jordan.

1248
01:38:07,315 --> 01:38:10,149
He wants us
         to correct the record.
    What does it say?

1249
01:38:10,185 --> 01:38:13,586
Oh, it's just a formality
to save the government's face.

1250
01:38:22,130 --> 01:38:24,197
I suggest we get
   this over and go

1251
01:38:24,232 --> 01:38:27,767
and have a good lunch
      on the company.

1252
01:38:27,802 --> 01:38:30,670
You must have forgotten
 what a good steak looks like.

1253
01:38:32,607 --> 01:38:34,407
"Rivera was armed
              with a knife

1254
01:38:34,442 --> 01:38:38,811
and we clearly saw him approach
Lieutenant Gomez and kill him."

1255
01:38:41,416 --> 01:38:43,783
Rivera was asleep.

1256
01:38:43,818 --> 01:38:46,719
Look, Jordan,
  all they want you

1257
01:38:46,755 --> 01:38:49,422
to do is to say
    that he did it.

1258
01:38:49,457 --> 01:38:51,024
Simply to clear us.

1259
01:38:51,059 --> 01:38:52,292
No.

1260
01:38:52,327 --> 01:38:53,893
So they can
                get him back.

1261
01:38:53,929 --> 01:38:55,995
Listen to me.
Do be sensible.

1262
01:38:56,031 --> 01:38:58,531
You know, Bryant,
        I used to think that
        you were just a bowtie,

1263
01:38:58,566 --> 01:39:00,800
and a big suit,
              and a fat smile

1264
01:39:00,835 --> 01:39:03,202
put on by the wind,
            but you are worse.

1265
01:39:03,238 --> 01:39:05,505
You are much worse.

1266
01:39:05,540 --> 01:39:07,607
Why don't you go away?
Go home.

1267
01:39:07,642 --> 01:39:09,042
Stop trying to get us
 to lie about things

1268
01:39:09,077 --> 01:39:11,044
that you wouldn't
even understand.

1269
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:13,846
Mrs. Jordan,
will you help us?

1270
01:39:13,882 --> 01:39:15,915
You've got
the future to think of.

1271
01:39:15,951 --> 01:39:17,951
What are you going to do?
Let him go through the world,

1272
01:39:17,986 --> 01:39:19,485
throwing away
every job he ever gets.

1273
01:39:19,521 --> 01:39:21,254
Can't you
make him see sense?

1274
01:39:24,893 --> 01:39:26,726
Tom.

1275
01:39:28,096 --> 01:39:31,764
He'd like to see you now,
 Mr. Jordan, and your wife.

1276
01:39:33,068 --> 01:39:34,834
Well?

1277
01:39:44,179 --> 01:39:46,079
Mr. Jordan.

1278
01:39:50,018 --> 01:39:52,285
I'm here.

1279
01:39:54,723 --> 01:39:57,357
You are both safe?

1280
01:39:58,626 --> 01:40:00,293
Quite safe.

1281
01:40:03,498 --> 01:40:06,766
Remarkable woman.

1282
01:40:13,141 --> 01:40:16,576
Why did you do it?

1283
01:40:16,611 --> 01:40:18,011
I don't know.

1284
01:40:18,046 --> 01:40:20,813
Honestly,
               I don't know.

1285
01:40:20,849 --> 01:40:23,182
Because I hate
            violence I suppose,

1286
01:40:23,218 --> 01:40:27,420
because I can't stand the
thought of men getting killed.

1287
01:40:27,455 --> 01:40:30,690
And now...

1288
01:40:30,725 --> 01:40:33,326
to save you, I...

1289
01:40:33,361 --> 01:40:35,228
I killed a man.

1290
01:40:39,367 --> 01:40:41,934
At last you understand.

1291
01:40:43,638 --> 01:40:45,471
Please.

1292
01:40:48,343 --> 01:40:52,245
Please forgive me
for teaching you this.

1293
01:41:01,656 --> 01:41:03,356
They won't get you back.

1294
01:41:07,262 --> 01:41:11,531
No.

1295
01:41:11,566 --> 01:41:14,767
I don't think so.

1296
01:41:16,671 --> 01:41:19,072
No.

1297
01:41:39,194 --> 01:41:41,494
Jordan,
            I appeal to your...

1298
01:41:41,529 --> 01:41:44,997
Jordan, I appeal to your
   loyalty for the last time.

1299
01:41:45,033 --> 01:41:47,500
All right, you're
   a great hero, aren't you?

1300
01:41:47,535 --> 01:41:49,502
But what
            have you got?

1301
01:41:49,537 --> 01:41:52,071
What exactly
         have you got?
