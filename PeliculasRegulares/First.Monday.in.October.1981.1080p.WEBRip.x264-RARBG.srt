1
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,743
Yes, that's right. The whole
court is in turmoil.

2
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:49,918
Couldn't have happened at a more
inconvenient time.

3
00:01:51,006 --> 00:01:53,401
No, Dan doesn't know.

4
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,012
That's why I'm calling you. I've
got to get through to him right away.

5
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:58,232
Just a moment.

6
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,757
Excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice. This
is the file you asked for.

7
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,632
Thank God I caught you, Christine.
Any idea where he went?

8
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,286
What makes you think I'd know
where he is?

9
00:02:07,765 --> 00:02:08,723
Dan?

10
00:02:10,682 --> 00:02:11,857
Dan?

11
00:02:13,338 --> 00:02:15,079
No,
he's not here.

12
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:16,732
I just walked through the door, CJ.

13
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:18,735
Where have you been?

14
00:02:18,822 --> 00:02:20,694
Europe, as usual.

15
00:02:20,781 --> 00:02:22,783
Stanley left some instructions
that involve Dan.

16
00:02:22,871 --> 00:02:24,568
And I've gotta find him.

17
00:02:24,655 --> 00:02:26,788
He surprised the hell out of me in
Brussels.

18
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:28,965
He sent me a postcard.

19
00:02:31,576 --> 00:02:35,581
The only part I can make out is
"Dear Christine."

20
00:02:35,668 --> 00:02:38,890
At least I think that's "Dear." You
know what his handwriting is like.

21
00:02:38,977 --> 00:02:42,677
Then there's something here about
climbing a mountain.

22
00:02:42,764 --> 00:02:44,331
Did he happen to mention which
mountain?

23
00:02:45,593 --> 00:02:47,640
See that peak straight ahead?

24
00:02:47,727 --> 00:02:49,685
That's where we'll be
tomorrow at this time.

25
00:02:51,426 --> 00:02:54,300
Grab a couple
of lungs full of this.

26
00:02:54,387 --> 00:02:58,479
Pity the poor bastards in the cities
who don't get to taste real air anymore.

27
00:02:58,566 --> 00:03:00,002
Can we take a rest?

28
00:03:00,089 --> 00:03:01,569
Another 30 minutes.

29
00:03:01,656 --> 00:03:03,224
I know a great place for lunch.

30
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,017
Just hold on, I'm looking for it.

31
00:03:14,106 --> 00:03:15,760
D. Snow." Would that be it?

32
00:03:15,847 --> 00:03:17,893
CJ: That's it.

33
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,201
Mr

34
00:03:21,288 --> 00:03:22,682
Do you have a number there where
we could call you back?

35
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,423
I do. I do indeed.

36
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:28,863
Area code 202, 252-3271.

37
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,136
Hello. Do you read? Over.

38
00:04:15,223 --> 00:04:16,225
Yes, I read you.

39
00:04:18,357 --> 00:04:19,924
Press the button to talk.

40
00:04:22,188 --> 00:04:25,278
The little one on the top.
With your thumb, there.

41
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,977
Hello? Hello? Come in, please.
Come in, please.

42
00:04:28,064 --> 00:04:29,327
Dan.

43
00:04:32,026 --> 00:04:34,115
Patching you through on another channel.

44
00:04:35,116 --> 00:04:36,466
Go ahead, Highport.

45
00:04:36,553 --> 00:04:39,034
CJ: Do you hear me there? Hello?

46
00:04:39,121 --> 00:04:41,820
Dan Snow here. Is that you, CJ?

47
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:44,693
We need you back here, Dan.

48
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,218
Couldn't hear that. Say it again,
will you, CJ?

49
00:04:48,393 --> 00:04:50,134
Stanley Morehead died this morning.

50
00:04:53,747 --> 00:04:55,315
Are you still there, Dan?

51
00:04:56,403 --> 00:04:59,667
I say Stanley Morehead died this morning.

52
00:04:59,754 --> 00:05:01,235
I

53
00:05:01,322 --> 00:05:02,932
You gotta press to talk.

54
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:04,804
Heard you, CJ.

55
00:05:04,891 --> 00:05:06,459
Tell Alice I'm sorry.

56
00:05:08,112 --> 00:05:09,985
How fast can you get back here?

57
00:05:10,072 --> 00:05:10,986
You see, Stanley asked if...

58
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,075
Hello?

59
00:05:13,162 --> 00:05:14,119
Hello?

60
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:16,253
Hello?

61
00:05:17,472 --> 00:05:19,953
Hello? Hello, Jeff?

62
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,434
Up here these CB patches pick up
a lot of DX noise.

63
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:23,827
You want me to try
getting him again?

64
00:05:23,914 --> 00:05:25,830
No, that's okay.
We'll be getting downhill.

65
00:05:31,053 --> 00:05:34,406
Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

66
00:05:34,493 --> 00:05:35,798
Thou anointest my head with oil.

67
00:05:36,886 --> 00:05:39,149
"My cup runneth over.

68
00:05:40,413 --> 00:05:42,153
"Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me

69
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:45,157
all the days of my life

70
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:47,769
and I will dwell in the house of
the Lord for ever."

71
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,214
I don't really know...

72
00:06:00,088 --> 00:06:05,312
When Stanley left instructions
that he wanted me to, uh,

73
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,358
what do you call it... Say a few
words.

74
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,882
I was surprised.

75
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:16,151
Mr

76
00:06:16,238 --> 00:06:18,633
and I guess it's only natural that
we keep right on disagreeing.

77
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:25,771
I know seven other men who could
do this better,

78
00:06:25,858 --> 00:06:27,120
but I'm not about to file a
dissenting opinion.

79
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:34,739
Stanley Morehead was
a gentleman of honest mind.

80
00:06:34,826 --> 00:06:37,742
You can't say that about many men
in this city

81
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:40,223
in this century.

82
00:06:40,311 --> 00:06:44,620
Stanley and I were like a pair of
flying buttresses.

83
00:06:44,707 --> 00:06:47,362
Leaning against opposite sides of
a Gothic cathedral

84
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:48,930
we helped keep the roof from
caving in.

85
00:06:51,062 --> 00:06:52,760
If we'd both been on the same side
all the time,

86
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:55,503
we might have pushed the building
over.

87
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,113
You don't have to agree with a man in
order to respect him.

88
00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:04,731
Stanley and I had one argument
over and over again.

89
00:07:04,818 --> 00:07:05,776
I never won. I never could win.

90
00:07:07,647 --> 00:07:09,824
He used to ask me,

91
00:07:09,911 --> 00:07:14,917
What in God's name is the
practical use of mountain climbing?"

92
00:07:15,004 --> 00:07:17,791
One time I said to him,

93
00:07:17,878 --> 00:07:22,317
"Well,on a mountaintop, maybe you're
a little bit closer to God."

94
00:07:22,404 --> 00:07:24,755
He laughed and said, "Dan, what the hell do
you know about God?"

95
00:07:29,021 --> 00:07:31,110
I do know this.

96
00:07:31,197 --> 00:07:33,897
Mr. Justice Stanley Morehead is
not in any box

97
00:07:33,984 --> 00:07:36,943
about to be covered by earth.

98
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,643
He

99
00:07:47,957 --> 00:07:49,524
Fire!

100
00:07:49,611 --> 00:07:51,396
Ready. Aim.

101
00:07:51,483 --> 00:07:52,876
Fire!

102
00:07:52,963 --> 00:07:54,225
Ready...

103
00:07:54,312 --> 00:07:56,358
Aim... Fire!

104
00:07:56,445 --> 00:07:59,406
Ready... Present arms!

105
00:09:19,371 --> 00:09:21,156
CHRISTINE: I think we should have
hired a limousine, like the others.

106
00:09:21,243 --> 00:09:22,767
DAN: Nonsense. The fresh air will
do you good.

107
00:09:24,812 --> 00:09:27,424
Alice looked awful.
You know what burns me?

108
00:09:27,512 --> 00:09:31,125
Today's Star brushed off Stanley's
whole life with two inches.

109
00:09:31,212 --> 00:09:36,218
And printed two full pages of
smart-ass speculation about his replacement.

110
00:09:36,305 --> 00:09:38,437
DAN: I'll bet it's a surprise.
Somebody nobody thought of.

111
00:09:38,525 --> 00:09:40,702
CHRISTINE: She doesn't have
many close friends.

112
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,052
DAN: It's always a surprise.
Especially for the guy who gets capped.

113
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:45,708
CHRISTINE: Maybe I'll plan a small
dinner party for her after we
get settled.

114
00:09:45,795 --> 00:09:47,448
DAN: When the President gave me
the nod, I was so surprised

115
00:09:47,536 --> 00:09:48,841
I couldn't talk for a week.

116
00:09:48,928 --> 00:09:50,191
CHRISTINE: I don't think
I could stand

117
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:52,106
one of those terrible teas
with all those wives.

118
00:09:52,193 --> 00:09:53,499
Could be anybody.

119
00:09:53,586 --> 00:09:55,415
A lot of good men around.

120
00:09:55,502 --> 00:09:57,722
A lot of lousy ones, too.

121
00:09:57,809 --> 00:09:59,419
If I were Alice,
I'd go to Europe.

122
00:10:00,203 --> 00:10:01,465
The warm part.

123
00:10:02,554 --> 00:10:03,729
How was Europe?

124
00:10:04,077 --> 00:10:04,992
Wet.

125
00:10:06,036 --> 00:10:07,211
How was your mountain?

126
00:10:07,298 --> 00:10:08,648
High.

127
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:13,784
You have any idea who's going to be
appointed?

128
00:10:17,006 --> 00:10:18,224
To what?

129
00:10:18,311 --> 00:10:19,792
The court.

130
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,752
I never try to second-guess a
president.

131
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:24,929
Man moves into the White House,

132
00:10:25,016 --> 00:10:27,932
you have no idea what happens to his mind.

133
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:30,152
I just hope he has an active membership
card in the human race.

134
00:10:39,816 --> 00:10:42,819
Waldo. Hi, Ted.

135
00:10:42,906 --> 00:10:44,387
Always feels like the first day of
school, doesn't it?

136
00:10:44,474 --> 00:10:46,258
Hope I never graduate.

137
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:47,564
I don't know what we'd do without
you, Dan.

138
00:10:49,393 --> 00:10:51,787
Morning, Radabaugh. Anything
happen?

139
00:10:51,874 --> 00:10:54,094
Everything that's happened is on your desk,
Mr. Justice Snow.

140
00:10:54,181 --> 00:10:55,443
Still got the same cold?

141
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,706
Sinus.

142
00:11:21,257 --> 00:11:22,432
DAN: Who's there?

143
00:11:22,998 --> 00:11:24,391
Mason Woods, sir.

144
00:11:28,135 --> 00:11:30,964
May I come in, sir?

145
00:11:31,051 --> 00:11:33,098
Of course you can come in. What the hell do
you think you're here for?

146
00:11:33,185 --> 00:11:34,142
Thank you, sir.

147
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:37,973
And you don't have to knock.

148
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,715
It

149
00:11:40,802 --> 00:11:42,586
Yes, sir.

150
00:11:42,674 --> 00:11:43,980
I

151
00:11:44,067 --> 00:11:45,982
You're
too goddamn polite.

152
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:47,724
Stop being scared of me, Mason.
You got the job.

153
00:11:47,811 --> 00:11:49,595
Yes,
sir.

154
00:11:49,683 --> 00:11:52,861
Uh, would you care for some tea, Mr. Justice,
or a scotch?

155
00:11:53,949 --> 00:11:56,212
Maybe I'd better have both.

156
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,343
No, I don't wanna overdo it.
Forget the tea.

157
00:11:59,956 --> 00:12:02,001
Um, now this supports your
position

158
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:03,917
on Abbot vs. Omnitech.

159
00:12:04,004 --> 00:12:06,006
Forget Omnitech.

160
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:07,705
But that's at the top of the
order list.

161
00:12:08,662 --> 00:12:09,924
It's gonna get struck.

162
00:12:10,011 --> 00:12:11,012
Why?

163
00:12:13,363 --> 00:12:15,626
Because my brave brethren
on the court

164
00:12:15,714 --> 00:12:18,587
are too chicken-hearted
to hear it, that's why.

165
00:12:18,674 --> 00:12:21,503
When I'm getting ripped off,
Mason, I want to know who's doing the ripping.

166
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:24,942
How much can these multinational
monsters get away with?

167
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:26,814
I don't know, and neither do you.

168
00:12:26,901 --> 00:12:28,817
Because they keep hiding behind
all those TV commercials

169
00:12:28,904 --> 00:12:30,949
saying how goddamn holy
they are.

170
00:12:31,995 --> 00:12:34,258
Even the CJ is scared to
hear Omnitech.

171
00:12:34,345 --> 00:12:36,564
He says,
"It's like telling God

172
00:12:36,651 --> 00:12:39,133
"you want to examine the books."

173
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,398
Peace, up to a point.

174
00:12:42,485 --> 00:12:45,837
I tell you, Mason. The most
dangerous thing in the world is to be cautious.

175
00:12:45,924 --> 00:12:48,405
People are always falling down the
ones who are afraid they'll trip over something.

176
00:12:48,492 --> 00:12:50,886
Take a chance.
Yes, sir.

177
00:12:50,973 --> 00:12:52,671
And don't always agree with me.

178
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:54,369
If you think I'm wrong
and don't say so,

179
00:12:54,456 --> 00:12:56,459
then what the hell good are ya?

180
00:12:56,546 --> 00:12:58,940
I like law clerks who argue with me.
Yes, sir.

181
00:13:00,289 --> 00:13:01,987
No, sir.

182
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:02,858
I mean I'll try to do that, sir.

183
00:13:04,598 --> 00:13:06,732
Not to do that, sir. What's this?

184
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,647
This is Collins vs. California.

185
00:13:08,734 --> 00:13:11,172
It's a kinky one that came up
from the Ninth Circuit.

186
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:14,175
The Berkeley student who wore a
T-shirt that said, "Fuck the White House."

187
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,485
Did he
have his pants off?

188
00:13:18,572 --> 00:13:20,487
It doesn't say.

189
00:13:20,574 --> 00:13:22,925
Well then, I don't see any clear
and present danger

190
00:13:23,012 --> 00:13:26,234
that he intended to implement the
opinion of his T-shirt.

191
00:13:26,321 --> 00:13:29,280
Well, the Ninth Circuit held it was "offensive
to the public sensibility."

192
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:32,502
Just being offensive is not an
offense.

193
00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:35,898
One man's pornography may be another
man's poetry. Yes, sir.

194
00:13:37,203 --> 00:13:40,467
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

195
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:44,211
Lady purity, speaking from the
cloisters of California.

196
00:13:44,298 --> 00:13:48,303
Free speech is not ipso facto
filthy speech.

197
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:51,568
Dirt is a splendid environment
for earthworms,

198
00:13:51,655 --> 00:13:54,615
but it is a grave for the human
mind."

199
00:13:54,702 --> 00:13:57,314
I wish to hell she didn't write so
goddamn well!

200
00:13:59,534 --> 00:14:02,277
You see, Mason? That's what this
court is for.

201
00:14:02,364 --> 00:14:04,453
To restrain the Ruth Loomises of
the world.

202
00:14:07,065 --> 00:14:08,937
Sir, I found this opinion
on surveillance.

203
00:14:09,024 --> 00:14:10,156
But you won't
have to read it.

204
00:14:11,027 --> 00:14:12,071
Why not?

205
00:14:12,158 --> 00:14:13,725
You wrote it.

206
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:15,293
Well, read it to me.

207
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,861
I might have forgotten it or
changed my mind.

208
00:14:19,907 --> 00:14:22,301
"When God created the world,

209
00:14:22,388 --> 00:14:25,174
he did it alone, in private. All
by himself.

210
00:14:25,261 --> 00:14:27,611
"No monitors,
no hidden microphones.

211
00:14:27,698 --> 00:14:29,483
"He made it
the way he wanted it.

212
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,660
"But what if someone
had invaded God's privacy?

213
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:33,096
"Would he have put the world together
the same way?

214
00:14:35,056 --> 00:14:37,014
"I doubt it.
He would've made it a popular world.

215
00:14:38,363 --> 00:14:40,105
BOTH: "And the Garden of Eden
would have turned out

216
00:14:40,192 --> 00:14:43,108
like Las Vegas or 42nd Street."

217
00:14:45,807 --> 00:14:47,070
Would you like
to take any calls, sir?

218
00:14:47,157 --> 00:14:48,419
Uh, Ms. Radabaugh will get that.

219
00:14:50,378 --> 00:14:51,989
No, she won't.

220
00:14:52,076 --> 00:14:52,815
Chambers of
Mr. Justice Snow.

221
00:14:54,165 --> 00:14:55,471
Oh.

222
00:14:55,558 --> 00:14:57,256
Yes, Mrs. Snow.

223
00:14:57,343 --> 00:15:00,608
It's your wife
but she doesn't want to bother you.

224
00:15:00,695 --> 00:15:03,437
You're not bothering me. You're
interrupting me, but you're not bothering me.

225
00:15:03,524 --> 00:15:04,830
How should I seat them this evening?

226
00:15:04,918 --> 00:15:06,528
I don't care how you seat 'em. Try
chairs.

227
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:10,794
Hello? Hello?

228
00:15:12,927 --> 00:15:14,320
What happened to Radabaugh?

229
00:15:14,407 --> 00:15:15,713
She left early.

230
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,236
Sinus?

231
00:15:17,323 --> 00:15:19,022
She looked terrible.

232
00:15:19,109 --> 00:15:22,286
Radabaugh's been with me for 23 years,

233
00:15:22,373 --> 00:15:23,941
and she always looks terrible.

234
00:15:29,077 --> 00:15:32,037
How do you do that, sir?
Do what?

235
00:15:32,124 --> 00:15:34,736
Well, you reach in there and find exactly
what you're looking for.

236
00:15:34,823 --> 00:15:37,957
In the middle of all that...
All that...  Mess?

237
00:15:38,044 --> 00:15:41,048
To you it's a mess. To me, it's a
wilderness of free association.

238
00:15:41,135 --> 00:15:42,701
Don't ever straighten up
my desk, Mason.

239
00:15:42,788 --> 00:15:44,226
I'd never be able
to find anything.

240
00:15:45,575 --> 00:15:48,535
Always been suspicious
of neatness.

241
00:15:48,622 --> 00:15:50,929
If there's nothing on top
of a man's desk,

242
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:54,281
he's probably shoved
all the clutter into the drawers.

243
00:15:54,368 --> 00:15:56,109
And if his drawers are empty, what
the hell does he need a desk for?

244
00:15:58,112 --> 00:16:00,549
May I come in, Dan? Sure,
CJ.

245
00:16:00,636 --> 00:16:01,811
How are you, Mr. Chief Justice?

246
00:16:01,898 --> 00:16:03,379
Uh, I'm not sure.

247
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,035
Mind if I lie down on your couch?

248
00:16:07,122 --> 00:16:10,518
Mason, see if those T-shirts are
available on the open market.

249
00:16:10,605 --> 00:16:11,823
I

250
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,478
What T-shirts?

251
00:16:13,565 --> 00:16:14,914
None of your goddamn business.

252
00:16:15,002 --> 00:16:16,264
Do I ask you about your underwear?

253
00:16:19,572 --> 00:16:21,661
How come your couches are
much more comfortable than mine?

254
00:16:22,837 --> 00:16:24,056
You know something, CJ?

255
00:16:25,623 --> 00:16:27,538
Maybe I'll give you that couch

256
00:16:27,626 --> 00:16:28,670
as a going-away present.

257
00:16:29,715 --> 00:16:32,326
Who's going away?

258
00:16:32,413 --> 00:16:36,114
Think of how many people would
bust a gut with joy if I retired.

259
00:16:36,201 --> 00:16:39,118
Nah, you wouldn't do that
to me, Dan.

260
00:16:39,205 --> 00:16:41,076
Oh

261
00:16:41,163 --> 00:16:42,774
I

262
00:16:43,297 --> 00:16:44,124
Yeah. Hmm.

263
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:48,607
Who's the President going to pick?

264
00:16:53,048 --> 00:16:54,223
He's already been appointed?

265
00:16:57,227 --> 00:16:59,403
Who is he?

266
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:02,842
Mr. Justice Snow,
I'm gonna have to ask you to rephrase that question.

267
00:17:05,323 --> 00:17:06,411
A woman.

268
00:17:07,021 --> 00:17:08,153
He picked a woman.

269
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:09,980
Great!

270
00:17:11,417 --> 00:17:13,072
Good for him. It'll be fun.

271
00:17:15,161 --> 00:17:18,426
Who is it? Who is she? Who? Who?

272
00:17:18,513 --> 00:17:21,385
The President has just
sent up to the Senate Judiciary Committee

273
00:17:21,472 --> 00:17:24,172
the name of Judge
Ruth Hagador Loomis,

274
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:25,869
of the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals.

275
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:34,009
Get off my couch. I have to lie
down.

276
00:17:34,097 --> 00:17:36,142
Now... Now, Dan.

277
00:17:37,362 --> 00:17:39,494
You're joking. It's a joke. It's
a joke, isn't it?

278
00:17:39,581 --> 00:17:41,628
The President, I am told,
thinks he has made

279
00:17:41,715 --> 00:17:45,588
a great, progressive step in the history
of mankind.

280
00:17:45,675 --> 00:17:48,897
Ruth Loomis? The mother superior
of Orange County?

281
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,899
What goes through a man's head
when he makes an appointment like that?

282
00:17:52,641 --> 00:17:54,773
Guess he was trying to be
evenhanded.

283
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,516
President of all the people.

284
00:17:57,603 --> 00:17:59,910
The Senate'll never go for it.
Will they? Will they?

285
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:01,391
Forget it.

286
00:18:10,531 --> 00:18:11,533
Where's Ms. Radabaugh?

287
00:18:17,627 --> 00:18:18,628
Chambers of Mr. Justice Snow.

288
00:18:21,632 --> 00:18:23,199
It

289
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:28,684
No comment from Mr. Justice Snow at
this time.

290
00:18:31,601 --> 00:18:34,386
You're better than Ms. Radabaugh.

291
00:18:34,473 --> 00:18:36,911
The President wants a woman on the court,
why not pick Ms. Radabaugh.

292
00:18:36,998 --> 00:18:38,130
She'd be perfect.
She'd never show up.

293
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:45,313
Jeff, why in God's name do I get
a sinking feeling in my gut every time

294
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,055
I think about that woman sitting
on this court?

295
00:18:48,142 --> 00:18:49,404
It's not because
she's a woman.

296
00:18:49,491 --> 00:18:51,886
I like women.
My wife's a woman.

297
00:18:51,973 --> 00:18:53,801
The bench will smell better with
a little perfume on it.

298
00:18:54,845 --> 00:18:56,413
But Ruth Loomis...

299
00:19:06,295 --> 00:19:08,819
How can you just let it ring?

300
00:19:08,906 --> 00:19:12,693
Telephone has no constitutional
right to be answered.

301
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,999
Don't pay any attention to it.
It'll go away.

302
00:19:18,787 --> 00:19:19,702
See?

303
00:19:22,923 --> 00:19:24,491
I hear she plays tennis.

304
00:19:24,578 --> 00:19:26,493
Hitler played the harmonica.

305
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,016
Oh,
she may not be so bad.

306
00:19:29,497 --> 00:19:31,977
She's young.

307
00:19:32,064 --> 00:19:34,153
We could use some young blood
around here.

308
00:19:34,242 --> 00:19:35,330
And she isn't stupid.

309
00:19:36,853 --> 00:19:38,071
Fix yourself a drink.

310
00:19:39,987 --> 00:19:41,250
I just might do that.

311
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,516
Here she is now. Come in.

312
00:19:47,605 --> 00:19:48,345
Is it true?

313
00:19:49,738 --> 00:19:51,740
Jack Anderson's on the phone.

314
00:19:51,827 --> 00:19:54,440
Would either of you care to say
anything to him?

315
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,920
Yes. Ask him where I'm spending my
vacation next summer.

316
00:19:57,007 --> 00:19:58,270
I don't know, but he probably does.

317
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:03,232
I'll just tell him neither of you is available
for comment.

318
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,585
How does a newspaperman like Jack
Anderson

319
00:20:07,672 --> 00:20:10,328
find out what happens in the Oval
Office so fast?

320
00:20:10,415 --> 00:20:12,287
Simple. He's got a friend
in the Soviet embassy.

321
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,855
And I'm 10 minutes late.

322
00:20:18,076 --> 00:20:20,819
Only one thing, Dan. Before you
consider resigning.

323
00:20:20,906 --> 00:20:24,084
Resigning? Who the hell's gonna
resign?

324
00:20:24,171 --> 00:20:25,781
You think I'd leave you here alone
and get sprayed down

325
00:20:25,868 --> 00:20:29,220
by the Lysol lady of Orange County?

326
00:20:29,308 --> 00:20:30,787
And if that holy junta
at the White House

327
00:20:30,874 --> 00:20:33,225
picked her to replace Stanley
Morehead,

328
00:20:33,313 --> 00:20:35,576
who in God's name do you suppose
they'd send up to take my seat?

329
00:20:36,446 --> 00:20:37,708
Shirley Temple?

330
00:20:55,948 --> 00:20:58,081
5-2.

331
00:20:58,168 --> 00:20:59,431
BILL: Change sides. I'll let you
take the sun for a while.

332
00:21:00,867 --> 00:21:03,523
Not bad for a beginner, am I?

333
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,916
When are you gonna let me take you
someplace where I can win?

334
00:21:06,003 --> 00:21:08,006
Don't you think a year is long enough
to be a practicing widow?

335
00:21:08,093 --> 00:21:10,052
Seven months.
Don't rush me.

336
00:21:10,139 --> 00:21:11,619
Am I on the list?

337
00:21:11,706 --> 00:21:13,317
You're at the top.

338
00:21:13,404 --> 00:21:15,058
PUBLIC ANNOUNCER: Judge Loomis, telephone.

339
00:21:15,145 --> 00:21:16,581
Long distance call for Judge Loomis.

340
00:21:16,668 --> 00:21:17,453
Sorry, Bill.

341
00:21:57,326 --> 00:21:59,764
SENATOR: I'm sorry these proceedings are taking so much time

342
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:01,461
but we're breaking ground here.

343
00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:03,072
And I trust the committee's questions

344
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:05,118
aren't embarrassing you, Judge Loomis.

345
00:22:05,205 --> 00:22:06,816
I don't embarrass easily, Senator.

346
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,558
Judge Loomis?

347
00:22:09,645 --> 00:22:12,475
Judge Loomis, about your interests and equities,

348
00:22:12,562 --> 00:22:15,347
would they influence your decisions on the high court?

349
00:22:16,915 --> 00:22:19,309
The financial statement in front of you is complete, Senator.

350
00:22:20,484 --> 00:22:23,357
When I was appointed to the Ninth Circuit,

351
00:22:23,445 --> 00:22:25,359
I disposed of anything that might possibly raise

352
00:22:25,447 --> 00:22:26,971
a question of conflict of interest.

353
00:22:27,058 --> 00:22:28,451
Thank you.

354
00:22:28,538 --> 00:22:31,063
But you were still married to a very active

355
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:34,066
and successful corporation lawyer.

356
00:22:34,153 --> 00:22:36,112
Was I expected to dispose of him?

357
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:42,163
According to this FBI report,

358
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,600
you and your husband were partners in
the law firm of Loomis and Loomis.

359
00:22:47,561 --> 00:22:52,131
Excuse me, Senator. Why do you keep bringing up my husband?

360
00:22:52,218 --> 00:22:54,177
When I was appointed to the federal bench,

361
00:22:54,264 --> 00:22:56,006
he took over the entire practice.

362
00:22:57,094 --> 00:22:58,922
It was a tremendous burden on him.

363
00:22:59,618 --> 00:23:01,621
It's probably what killed him.

364
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:03,971
Did you ever represent Omnitech International or its chairman,

365
00:23:04,058 --> 00:23:05,016
Donald Richards?

366
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,801
No, Senator.

367
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,847
You're quite sure about that?

368
00:23:08,934 --> 00:23:10,893
RUTH: Quite sure.

369
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,852
SENATOR: After you left, is it possible
that the firm represented him?

370
00:23:12,939 --> 00:23:15,638
I'd have no knowledge of that.

371
00:23:15,725 --> 00:23:19,033
And since your husband's death, you've had no
contact with any member of that firm?

372
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,906
RUTH:
None. Oh, that's not quite true.

373
00:23:21,993 --> 00:23:24,256
I do play tennis once in a while with Bill Russell.

374
00:23:24,343 --> 00:23:26,085
William Russell.

375
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:28,653
He joined the firm after I went to the bench.

376
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,003
SENATOR: Do you ever discuss legal business with him?

377
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:30,874
No, Senator.

378
00:23:32,353 --> 00:23:34,879
Do you think perhaps,

379
00:23:34,966 --> 00:23:36,663
you're a little too young, Judge Loomis,

380
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,186
to take these responsibilities on yourself?

381
00:23:41,843 --> 00:23:43,715
As I recall,

382
00:23:43,802 --> 00:23:45,761
Mr. Justice Snow was a year younger than I am

383
00:23:45,848 --> 00:23:46,632
when he was appointed to the court.

384
00:23:51,507 --> 00:23:53,465
Do you feel your decisions on the High Court

385
00:23:53,553 --> 00:23:56,165
might be influenced by the fact that...

386
00:23:56,252 --> 00:23:57,427
Well, you're a woman?

387
00:23:58,167 --> 00:24:01,040
I hope so.

388
00:24:01,127 --> 00:24:05,132
Uh, aren't a man's decisions influenced by the fact that he's a man?

389
00:24:05,219 --> 00:24:07,874
For two centuries, this court has expressed
men's opinions.

390
00:24:07,961 --> 00:24:10,356
And perhaps it's time for the majority of the population

391
00:24:10,443 --> 00:24:12,271
to have one voice in nine in the
rulings of the Supreme Court.

392
00:24:16,668 --> 00:24:18,147
SENATOR: Is the lady implying

393
00:24:18,234 --> 00:24:21,064
that male justice is perverted?

394
00:24:21,151 --> 00:24:25,417
RUTH: Haven't we outgrown those fears about the periodic instability

395
00:24:25,504 --> 00:24:27,637
of the female of the species?

396
00:24:27,724 --> 00:24:29,597
Eggs are not the seeds of insanity.

397
00:24:29,684 --> 00:24:31,816
A woman can ovulate and think at the same time.

398
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,865
SENATOR: We're striving
to be objective.

399
00:24:35,952 --> 00:24:38,519
Yes, but really,
what does sex have to do

400
00:24:38,607 --> 00:24:39,652
with being a judge?

401
00:24:41,785 --> 00:24:43,482
Somebody with the capacity to bear children

402
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:45,354
is gifted, not crippled.

403
00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:48,140
A uterus is like absolute pitch,

404
00:24:48,227 --> 00:24:49,403
so me people have it, some don't.

405
00:24:52,841 --> 00:24:55,236
Well, according to this fact sheet,

406
00:24:55,323 --> 00:24:56,367
Judge Loomis has never had any children.

407
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:02,070
Yes , but does the Constitution say that a
Supreme Court Justice has to be a mother?

408
00:25:05,596 --> 00:25:08,513
Judge Loomis, we don't mean to probe into your personal life...

409
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,385
Why not?
My entire life is public.

410
00:25:12,996 --> 00:25:15,260
The FBI is wrong in reporting to you
that I have no children.

411
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,391
I have hundreds.

412
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,181
We are the parents of our ideas,

413
00:25:22,878 --> 00:25:26,403
and, uh, so my children,

414
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:29,930
in other words, my opinions, my decisions,

415
00:25:30,017 --> 00:25:32,410
are the result of conception,

416
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:35,023
and the delivery is sometimes painful.

417
00:25:36,154 --> 00:25:37,547
You may not like my children.

418
00:25:37,635 --> 00:25:39,202
You may find them ugly,

419
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:43,207
but, by God, your ideas and mine

420
00:25:43,294 --> 00:25:45,383
have equal rights to live together,

421
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:48,648
to grow, to change, even to die.

422
00:25:55,177 --> 00:25:57,615
If there are no further questions,

423
00:25:57,703 --> 00:25:59,617
the committee will consider an executive session

424
00:25:59,705 --> 00:26:01,750
where we'll recommend to the full body of the Senate.

425
00:26:01,837 --> 00:26:03,579
Thank you, Judge Loomis.

426
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:05,146
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

427
00:26:05,233 --> 00:26:06,321
T hank you, gentlemen.

428
00:26:09,891 --> 00:26:11,762
Now let's check it
just once more.

429
00:26:11,849 --> 00:26:14,200
Mr. Justice Carey
is now on this end.

430
00:26:14,287 --> 00:26:16,420
That's correct. Then Mr.
Justice Webb.

431
00:26:16,507 --> 00:26:17,944
Webb. Mr. Justice Quincy.

432
00:26:18,684 --> 00:26:21,513
That's him. Mr. Justice
Snow.

433
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,952
That's right. The CJ stays
in the center, of course.

434
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,693
Then Mr. Justice Halperin.
Okay.

435
00:26:26,781 --> 00:26:28,696
Mr. Justice Clewes.

436
00:26:28,783 --> 00:26:31,090
That's him. Mr. Justice Thompson.

437
00:26:31,177 --> 00:26:33,267
That's right. And the new
chair for Justice Loomis

438
00:26:33,354 --> 00:26:34,181
on this end.
That's correct.

439
00:26:36,793 --> 00:26:38,186
Does a lady need this?

440
00:26:39,187 --> 00:26:40,318
We'll tell her
it's a wastebasket.

441
00:26:45,585 --> 00:26:47,240
Good afternoon.

442
00:26:47,327 --> 00:26:48,720
Welcome to Washington,
Justice Loomis.

443
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:49,895
Thank you. Everything's
ready.

444
00:26:49,982 --> 00:26:51,506
Great. Oh, is the phone in?

445
00:26:51,593 --> 00:26:52,507
Ah, yes.
The man left an hour ago.

446
00:27:07,047 --> 00:27:08,396
Hello?

447
00:27:08,483 --> 00:27:09,789
Ready for your coronation?

448
00:27:09,876 --> 00:27:12,531
Bill?
Yes.

449
00:27:12,618 --> 00:27:15,404
How did you get this number? I
don't even know it.

450
00:27:15,491 --> 00:27:17,363
Well, I do. If it ever slips your mind, just give me a ring.

451
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:18,364
In the bedroom, please.

452
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,453
In the bedroom?

453
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,804
I'm talking to the bellman,
you idiot.

454
00:27:22,979 --> 00:27:25,111
It's sweet of you to call.

455
00:27:25,198 --> 00:27:27,158
I just wanted to be the first man in recorded history

456
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:29,203
to ask a Supreme Court Justice for a date.

457
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:30,902
So noted.
The clerk will put it on the docket.

458
00:27:30,989 --> 00:27:31,946
That'll take two years!

459
00:27:32,991 --> 00:27:34,079
Not now that I'm in charge.

460
00:27:38,171 --> 00:27:39,650
Mr. Agronsky?

461
00:27:39,737 --> 00:27:40,783
Whenever you're ready.

462
00:27:42,437 --> 00:27:43,612
Tape is rolling.

463
00:27:48,009 --> 00:27:50,577
This is an historic day for the
nation

464
00:27:50,664 --> 00:27:53,015
and for the Supreme Court of the
United States.

465
00:27:53,102 --> 00:27:54,407
The court has been in session

466
00:27:54,494 --> 00:27:56,933
since the first Monday in October,

467
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:01,112
which, according to the Judiciary
Act of 1789,

468
00:28:01,199 --> 00:28:04,071
marks the start of a new term
each year.

469
00:28:04,158 --> 00:28:06,379
No camera has ever photographed

470
00:28:06,466 --> 00:28:08,381
the traditional robing ceremony

471
00:28:08,468 --> 00:28:11,559
in the sanctum sanctorum of the court,

472
00:28:11,646 --> 00:28:14,649
and none is there today.

473
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:17,174
Since the death of Justice Stanley Morehead,

474
00:28:17,261 --> 00:28:19,743
this has been an eight-man court,

475
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,788
which as Justice Daniel Snow has pointed out,

476
00:28:22,746 --> 00:28:26,011
resembles a four-man basketball team.

477
00:28:26,098 --> 00:28:28,318
Today the vacancy has been filled.

478
00:28:28,405 --> 00:28:31,148
But this still remains an eight-man court.

479
00:28:31,235 --> 00:28:33,280
Well, where is she?

480
00:28:33,367 --> 00:28:35,370
Maybe we ought to sound the
warning buzzer a little sooner.

481
00:28:35,457 --> 00:28:37,720
I suppose she has things to do
that we don't.

482
00:28:37,807 --> 00:28:39,287
After all, I don't have anything
to do with my hair.

483
00:28:40,376 --> 00:28:42,074
AGRONSKY: This is
an historic occasion.

484
00:28:43,858 --> 00:28:46,383
Like the Jesuits going coed.

485
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:48,081
Suppose she'll wanna hang
chintz curtains everywhere?

486
00:28:48,168 --> 00:28:50,171
I hate chintz.

487
00:28:50,258 --> 00:28:52,913
Why am I nervous? She's the one who
should be nervous.

488
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,264
Now, gentlemen, things are not
going to be any different

489
00:28:55,351 --> 00:28:58,441
from the way they've been every
two minutes to 10 in the history of the court.

490
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,270
Now we've got to think of her
exactly as one of the brothers.

491
00:29:00,357 --> 00:29:01,140
Good morning.

492
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:06,668
Justice Loomis, welcome.

493
00:29:06,755 --> 00:29:09,150
Welcome to the court. Thank
you.

494
00:29:09,237 --> 00:29:10,195
Good morning.
Good morning, ma'am.

495
00:29:12,632 --> 00:29:13,939
Thank you
for the lovely roses.

496
00:29:14,026 --> 00:29:15,723
Uh...

497
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:17,899
You don't send me roses anymore,
CJ.

498
00:29:19,771 --> 00:29:21,860
It's 9:58, gentlemen and Madam
Justice.

499
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:35,007
We shake hands
like this every day.

500
00:29:35,094 --> 00:29:37,444
Every morning just before we take
the bench.

501
00:29:37,531 --> 00:29:39,752
Like nine boxers coming in to a
ring.

502
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:41,884
We shake hands before we knock each
other out.

503
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:20,670
The honorable, the Chief Justice
and Associate Justices

504
00:30:20,757 --> 00:30:23,457
of the Supreme Court of the United
States.

505
00:30:23,544 --> 00:30:27,200
Oyez, oyez, oyez.

506
00:30:27,287 --> 00:30:29,246
All persons having business

507
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:32,249
before the honorable, the Supreme Court of the United States

508
00:30:32,337 --> 00:30:34,861
are admonished to draw near and give their attention,

509
00:30:34,948 --> 00:30:36,994
for the Court is now sitting.

510
00:30:37,081 --> 00:30:40,259
God save the United States and this honorable Court.

511
00:30:44,699 --> 00:30:47,051
CJ: Today's orders
of the Court

512
00:30:47,138 --> 00:30:49,662
have been certified by the Chief Justice filed with the clerk

513
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:53,362
and will not be announced orally.

514
00:30:53,449 --> 00:30:56,670
Probably the peak of every
lawyer's career

515
00:30:56,757 --> 00:31:00,544
is that moment when he is presented
and accredited to plead

516
00:31:00,631 --> 00:31:03,592
before the highest court
in the land.

517
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:07,988
Only lawyers ever plead in that
hallowed chamber.

518
00:31:08,076 --> 00:31:13,125
But today, all eyes are focused on the court's newest newcomer

519
00:31:13,212 --> 00:31:16,695
who has just received confirmation from the Senate of the United States.

520
00:31:18,262 --> 00:31:22,658
Court watchers will be fascinated in the weeks and months ahead

521
00:31:22,745 --> 00:31:25,574
by the figure in the leather chair farthest to the left

522
00:31:25,661 --> 00:31:27,577
of the Chief Justice.

523
00:31:27,664 --> 00:31:29,318
How will this feminine presence

524
00:31:29,405 --> 00:31:32,235
affect what for two centuries

525
00:31:32,322 --> 00:31:34,716
has been an all-male preserve?

526
00:31:35,369 --> 00:31:36,893
Because so many states

527
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:41,027
have accepted pornography
as a way of life

528
00:31:41,116 --> 00:31:43,335
does not mean that we are willing

529
00:31:43,422 --> 00:31:44,945
to compromise our values

530
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:50,387
in the sovereign state of Nebraska.

531
00:31:50,474 --> 00:31:54,087
Ergo, I beseech this
distinguished body,

532
00:31:54,174 --> 00:31:57,439
in its infinite and scholarly
wisdom,

533
00:31:57,526 --> 00:32:01,662
to uphold exalted standards of
morality

534
00:32:01,749 --> 00:32:05,884
which this lofty court so
fervently advocates.

535
00:32:06,885 --> 00:32:10,847
And how rare it is
to find judicial minds

536
00:32:10,934 --> 00:32:15,679
so attuned to the higher
reaches of the spirit.

537
00:32:15,766 --> 00:32:19,465
So understanding
of the basic values

538
00:32:19,552 --> 00:32:22,034
we so dearly cherish.

539
00:32:24,254 --> 00:32:30,436
So incredibly sensitive to the
deep strains of decency

540
00:32:30,523 --> 00:32:34,353
which constitute
the lapping tidewaters

541
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,138
of our heritage.

542
00:32:37,313 --> 00:32:39,315
The state of Nebraska

543
00:32:39,402 --> 00:32:42,711
contends that
Herbert G. Maloney,

544
00:32:44,016 --> 00:32:47,107
knowing and willfully,

545
00:32:47,195 --> 00:32:50,111
perpetrated an obscene and foul...

546
00:32:50,808 --> 00:32:51,896
Your time is up.

547
00:32:53,506 --> 00:32:55,117
May I be permitted...
CJ: No.

548
00:32:55,944 --> 00:32:57,207
Any questions, gentlemen?

549
00:32:57,294 --> 00:32:58,120
Madam Justice?

550
00:33:03,823 --> 00:33:06,957
I get the impression
that the state of Nebraska

551
00:33:07,044 --> 00:33:09,657
would like to see this film
confiscated, burned,

552
00:33:09,744 --> 00:33:13,182
and the ashes sent into space.
Is that the idea?

553
00:33:13,269 --> 00:33:15,272
If the court so recommended.

554
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:17,448
Is it your contention
that the Constitution

555
00:33:17,535 --> 00:33:19,582
gives this court
any such power?

556
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:22,802
This court is the judge
of its own power.

557
00:33:22,889 --> 00:33:25,371
Until we actually examine the film in
question, I think that...

558
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:27,852
May it please the court.

559
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:30,595
I respectfully submit that my
client's rights under the First Amendment...

560
00:33:30,682 --> 00:33:33,206
The First Amendment doesn't give
anybody the right

561
00:33:33,293 --> 00:33:35,601
to commit acts which are harmful
to the public good.

562
00:33:35,688 --> 00:33:37,559
But this is an educational film.

563
00:33:37,646 --> 00:33:39,823
A major documentary, a work of art.

564
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:41,564
How can we judge that
until we've seen it.

565
00:33:43,392 --> 00:33:45,352
Do any of the justices object,

566
00:33:45,439 --> 00:33:47,005
besides Justice Snow?

567
00:33:49,226 --> 00:33:52,142
I think it's essential that we see
the film.

568
00:33:52,229 --> 00:33:54,885
Alright then. The clerk will
schedule a showing of the film

569
00:33:54,972 --> 00:33:56,887
at some future date which is not
in conflict

570
00:33:56,974 --> 00:33:58,236
with the schedule already on the
calendar.

571
00:34:33,323 --> 00:34:35,586
NARRATOR: If you saw Lois
walking along

572
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:37,501
in the sunshine of Beverly Hills,

573
00:34:38,894 --> 00:34:42,245
you might think she was just a healthy, ordinary girl.

574
00:34:42,856 --> 00:34:45,685
But Lois has a problem.

575
00:34:45,772 --> 00:34:48,515
Like the alcoholic who cannot stop with one drink,

576
00:34:48,602 --> 00:34:50,821
like the compulsive eater

577
00:34:50,908 --> 00:34:53,956
who must consume one dessert after another,

578
00:34:54,043 --> 00:34:56,132
Lois can never be satisfied,

579
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,917
can never get enough of what she craves.

580
00:35:19,247 --> 00:35:21,684
Why isn't
Mr. Justice Snow here?

581
00:35:21,771 --> 00:35:23,165
He never comes to these showings.

582
00:35:28,171 --> 00:35:30,695
NARRATOR: The average young woman wants one man,

583
00:35:30,782 --> 00:35:32,829
but Lois is insatiable.

584
00:35:37,574 --> 00:35:39,140
Have we missed much?

585
00:35:39,227 --> 00:35:40,620
The lady's just
getting started.

586
00:35:40,707 --> 00:35:42,144
You guys get over there.

587
00:35:42,231 --> 00:35:43,058
And shut the door.

588
00:36:10,743 --> 00:36:12,616
NARRATOR:
We asked a distinguished physician

589
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:15,401
to give his opinion of Lois' condition.

590
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,578
He has asked that his name be withheld

591
00:36:17,665 --> 00:36:20,929
be cause of his high standing in the medical profession.

592
00:36:21,017 --> 00:36:24,064
Dr. X, from the point of view of a man of science,

593
00:36:25,152 --> 00:36:27,285
what can be done for Lois?

594
00:36:27,372 --> 00:36:29,940
Th is sort of affliction is difficult to treat.

595
00:36:30,027 --> 00:36:31,987
Let's look at the other sex as Lois sees them.

596
00:36:32,074 --> 00:36:34,206
Oh, let's not.

597
00:36:34,293 --> 00:36:36,427
NARRATOR:
Can Lois ever be cured?

598
00:36:37,472 --> 00:36:38,734
Or is she doomed to a life

599
00:36:39,735 --> 00:36:41,215
of ever-increasing frustration?

600
00:36:42,129 --> 00:36:43,130
I don't know about Lois, but I'm
cured.

601
00:36:44,436 --> 00:36:45,481
Haven't we seen enough?

602
00:36:47,353 --> 00:36:48,267
NARRATOR: During the next hour

603
00:36:49,311 --> 00:36:50,705
we'll try to show you...

604
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:51,793
No, I don't think so.

605
00:36:53,273 --> 00:36:54,927
Projectionist,
stop the film, please.

606
00:36:55,275 --> 00:36:56,233
Please.

607
00:36:57,713 --> 00:37:00,194
Thank you. Does anyone object?

608
00:37:00,282 --> 00:37:01,762
No.
Not me.

609
00:37:01,849 --> 00:37:03,198
Mr. Chief Justice,
are you stopping the film

610
00:37:03,285 --> 00:37:04,765
because there's a woman
in the room?

611
00:37:04,852 --> 00:37:06,289
No

612
00:37:06,376 --> 00:37:08,291
You think I'm offended?
Of course I'm offended,

613
00:37:08,378 --> 00:37:10,468
but that's no reason
to stop the film, is it?

614
00:37:10,555 --> 00:37:12,992
CJ,
just a moment, please.

615
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:15,953
Madam Justice Loomis, as a man,

616
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:20,611
I am somewhat embarrassed
that you have to sit here and watch this thing.

617
00:37:20,698 --> 00:37:22,787
I certainly can understand how Harold
feels.

618
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:24,528
I wouldn't want to sit through it
with my wife

619
00:37:24,615 --> 00:37:27,488
or arrange a special showing for
Mother's Day.

620
00:37:27,575 --> 00:37:29,752
But your wife and your mother
haven't been appointed to this court.

621
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,363
Time is the point, gentlemen and
Madam Justice.

622
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,063
And we have a responsibility not
to waste it.

623
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,978
I have seen enough to make my
decision.

624
00:37:37,065 --> 00:37:38,936
JUDGES: Me, too. Yes.

625
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:40,504
I do apologize, Justice Loomis.

626
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,984
Why?

627
00:37:42,071 --> 00:37:43,289
Something is very wrong here.

628
00:37:43,376 --> 00:37:44,814
You're all so polite to me.

629
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:47,686
I'm not being
too outspoken, am I?

630
00:37:47,773 --> 00:37:49,602
No. No.

631
00:37:49,689 --> 00:37:51,386
No

632
00:37:51,473 --> 00:37:52,866
Raise hell, if you want to.

633
00:37:54,259 --> 00:37:56,305
You may be sorry
you said that.

634
00:37:56,392 --> 00:37:58,873
Actually, I do have one question.
Oh.

635
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,963
How can Mr. Justice Snow
pass judgment on something

636
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:02,661
without even seeing it?

637
00:38:02,748 --> 00:38:04,185
Hasn't he virtually
disqualified himself on Maloney?

638
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:07,057
Would you like to suggest that to
Justice Snow?

639
00:38:10,192 --> 00:38:12,107
I don't think that's one of my
privileges. Isn't it yours?

640
00:38:13,151 --> 00:38:15,285
Well, yes, I suppose it is.

641
00:38:15,372 --> 00:38:17,287
And, Mr. Chief Justice,
I'd like to examine the rest of the film.

642
00:38:17,374 --> 00:38:19,464
If you don't mind.

643
00:38:19,551 --> 00:38:23,468
Just to see if there's a shred of redeeming
social or artistic value.

644
00:38:26,167 --> 00:38:28,561
Projectionist.
Would you continue the film, please?

645
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:30,216
Thank you.

646
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:44,233
5:30 will be fine.

647
00:38:45,277 --> 00:38:46,888
Howdy, Ben.

648
00:38:46,975 --> 00:38:48,891
Good afternoon, Mr. Justice.

649
00:38:48,978 --> 00:38:50,196
How are you felling?

650
00:38:50,283 --> 00:38:51,633
Just fine, thank you.
Just fine.

651
00:38:52,634 --> 00:38:54,201
How's Esther?

652
00:38:54,288 --> 00:38:55,115
Better and better.

653
00:38:55,202 --> 00:38:56,377
Good.

654
00:38:56,943 --> 00:38:58,163
The usual, Mr. Justice?

655
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,207
Sure.

656
00:39:03,909 --> 00:39:05,040
Dan.

657
00:39:05,127 --> 00:39:07,173
Hi, Waldo.

658
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,393
I just want you to know I'm not
gonna support Madam's motion.

659
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,308
What kind of a motion
is she making?

660
00:39:11,395 --> 00:39:12,658
Oh, I thought you knew.

661
00:39:12,745 --> 00:39:14,138
Knew
what?

662
00:39:14,225 --> 00:39:15,487
You
better get it from CJ.

663
00:39:20,276 --> 00:39:21,669
We'll do this later, Ben.

664
00:39:21,756 --> 00:39:22,975
Yes, sir.

665
00:39:30,157 --> 00:39:32,246
Hi, Dan.
Missed you at lunch.

666
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:34,293
What's she up to? What's
who up to?

667
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,599
How many "she's" do we have on
the Court?

668
00:39:36,687 --> 00:39:39,865
Oh, that. Well it's just
that a question came up.

669
00:39:39,952 --> 00:39:44,261
Or more accurately, a suggestion was made.
Yeah?

670
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:47,134
Well, what it amounts to is, uh...

671
00:39:47,221 --> 00:39:49,180
Should, uh...

672
00:39:49,267 --> 00:39:51,095
Should attendance be obligatory

673
00:39:51,182 --> 00:39:53,142
at these obscenity screenings?

674
00:39:53,229 --> 00:39:54,317
Who wasn't there besides me?

675
00:39:55,535 --> 00:39:56,798
Oh, house was packed.

676
00:39:56,885 --> 00:39:58,104
What's your beef?

677
00:39:58,191 --> 00:40:00,280
Well, the lady wonders

678
00:40:00,367 --> 00:40:02,283
whether a justice who hasn't seen
any part of the film

679
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:03,502
hasn't in effect...

680
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,420
She wants me to disqualify myself

681
00:40:07,507 --> 00:40:09,335
because I won't go down there

682
00:40:09,422 --> 00:40:12,339
and sit through that pile of
crap? Uh, well...

683
00:40:12,426 --> 00:40:14,907
So it's crap. What if it is crap?
That's not the point.

684
00:40:14,994 --> 00:40:16,169
Crap's got the right to be crap.

685
00:40:17,301 --> 00:40:18,476
Drop the legal language, Dan.

686
00:40:19,913 --> 00:40:21,523
Are you as Chief Justice

687
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:25,833
suggesting that I disqualify
myself from voting on Maloney?

688
00:40:26,922 --> 00:40:30,621
No. I'm merely suggesting that,
uh...

689
00:40:30,708 --> 00:40:31,841
It's been suggested.

690
00:40:34,278 --> 00:40:36,455
Where are you going?

691
00:40:36,542 --> 00:40:38,326
I

692
00:40:38,413 --> 00:40:39,501
Not roses.

693
00:40:41,068 --> 00:40:44,725
And have a look
at US v. Albertson, 1954.

694
00:40:44,812 --> 00:40:47,816
It's in volume 348, US. Maybe 349.

695
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:53,257
Is she in?

696
00:40:53,344 --> 00:40:55,520
Oh, yes, sir,
Mr. Justice Snow.

697
00:40:57,567 --> 00:41:01,137
Uh, just hold on a second. Yes?

698
00:41:01,224 --> 00:41:03,487
ROBINSON: Madam Justice, Mr. Justice Snow would like to see you.

699
00:41:04,575 --> 00:41:06,447
He would. When?

700
00:41:06,534 --> 00:41:07,492
He's here.

701
00:41:12,672 --> 00:41:13,891
Just check those references. I'll
get back to you. Thank you.

702
00:41:17,286 --> 00:41:20,551
Tell Mr. Justice Snow I'll be
happy to see him in a minute.

703
00:41:20,638 --> 00:41:21,988
She'll be happy to see you
in a moment, Mr. Justice.

704
00:41:22,075 --> 00:41:22,902
Thank you.

705
00:41:51,762 --> 00:41:53,634
Ask Mr. Justice Snow to come in,
Mr. Robinson.

706
00:41:56,246 --> 00:41:57,508
You may go in, Mr. Justice.

707
00:41:57,595 --> 00:41:58,683
Thank you.

708
00:42:03,689 --> 00:42:07,607
No, no. Please, please. Don't get
up, don't get up.

709
00:42:07,694 --> 00:42:11,525
You'd stand, Mr. Justice, if I came
to call on you in chambers.

710
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,788
Oh

711
00:42:15,661 --> 00:42:18,011
I can't tell you how grateful I am
to you for seeing me like this.

712
00:42:18,098 --> 00:42:20,319
On no notice whatsoever.

713
00:42:20,406 --> 00:42:21,363
It's my honor.
Is it?

714
00:42:22,887 --> 00:42:24,585
Well, I suppose it is.

715
00:42:25,107 --> 00:42:27,022
Say...

716
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:28,154
That's quite a desk.

717
00:42:28,241 --> 00:42:30,070
And so neat.

718
00:42:30,157 --> 00:42:32,028
Do aircraft land here frequently?

719
00:42:34,597 --> 00:42:36,164
What is it that you wanted
to see me about?

720
00:42:37,034 --> 00:42:37,992
Nothing earthshaking.

721
00:42:40,299 --> 00:42:42,911
By George, I was a little startled
to see

722
00:42:42,998 --> 00:42:45,653
that you've got a male law clerk
out there.

723
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:48,700
Mr. Robinson?
He's not my law clerk.
He's my secretary.

724
00:42:48,787 --> 00:42:51,878
Well. Well, well, well.

725
00:42:51,965 --> 00:42:53,227
What a generous gesture.

726
00:42:53,925 --> 00:42:55,796
Letting men into a field

727
00:42:55,883 --> 00:42:57,885
previously dominated by the other
sex.

728
00:42:59,322 --> 00:43:00,671
I'm glad you're
in favor of men's lib.

729
00:43:01,672 --> 00:43:02,978
Say, let's relax.

730
00:43:03,806 --> 00:43:05,155
Do you feel like relaxing?

731
00:43:12,337 --> 00:43:14,253
Madam Justice,

732
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,516
I hope you aren't finding our
national capital too dull

733
00:43:16,603 --> 00:43:18,214
after the grandeur of Disneyland.

734
00:43:19,999 --> 00:43:21,783
You don't think much
of California, do you?

735
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:23,482
I try not to think of it at all.

736
00:43:25,266 --> 00:43:27,790
Why don't you try climbing
some our mountains?

737
00:43:27,877 --> 00:43:30,403
Oh, I have, I have. I admire your
mountains.

738
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:31,970
It's your valleys that make me
nervous.

739
00:43:35,278 --> 00:43:36,888
Now, Madam Justice,

740
00:43:36,976 --> 00:43:39,588
I would like your opinion on a
point of law

741
00:43:39,675 --> 00:43:42,808
concerning that great American art
form, the motion picture.

742
00:43:46,726 --> 00:43:47,814
Help yourself.

743
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:49,252
Oh, thank you.

744
00:43:51,515 --> 00:43:54,214
Now, I was wondering if by any
chance

745
00:43:54,301 --> 00:43:56,390
you'd seen a film called, um...

746
00:43:57,827 --> 00:43:59,003
The Naked Nymphomaniac.

747
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:01,788
That's the one.

748
00:44:03,921 --> 00:44:05,793
Now you probably didn't even notice
I wasn't there.

749
00:44:06,837 --> 00:44:08,101
I noticed.

750
00:44:08,188 --> 00:44:09,145
Oh, you did? Mmm.

751
00:44:10,103 --> 00:44:11,191
Well...

752
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:12,889
Well...

753
00:44:14,412 --> 00:44:16,414
I wonder if you found anything,

754
00:44:17,547 --> 00:44:19,331
uh, unpleasant in the picture.

755
00:44:20,941 --> 00:44:22,596
First of all,

756
00:44:22,683 --> 00:44:25,164
I see no reason to overturn the
lower court.

757
00:44:25,251 --> 00:44:28,473
Anyone who'd seen that film would
realize that The Naked Nymphomaniac

758
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,475
is a total offense
against the public sensibility.

759
00:44:31,911 --> 00:44:35,089
It's sickening,
degrading, disgusting.

760
00:44:35,176 --> 00:44:37,310
My, my, my, my, my, my.

761
00:44:38,833 --> 00:44:39,877
As bad as all that?

762
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,188
Now, I
wonder
if you can put your finger

763
00:44:45,275 --> 00:44:47,583
on exactly what it was that
offended you?

764
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:51,195
Was it the title?
Some particular word in the title.

765
00:44:51,282 --> 00:44:52,893
Naked", is that it?

766
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:54,417
What if they called it

767
00:44:54,504 --> 00:44:58,987
The Fully-Clothed Nymphomaniac?

768
00:44:59,075 --> 00:45:01,338
Or maybe it was the other word that
bothered you.

769
00:45:01,425 --> 00:45:04,690
Nym-pho-maniac."

770
00:45:04,777 --> 00:45:07,215
Supposing they called it The Naked Methodist,

771
00:45:07,302 --> 00:45:09,391
or Naked Daughter of the American Revolution?

772
00:45:10,523 --> 00:45:12,830
Are you finished?

773
00:45:12,917 --> 00:45:17,053
Madam Justice, I am a long way
from being finished,

774
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:19,664
but I'll pause briefly in case
there's something you'd like to say.

775
00:45:21,057 --> 00:45:21,972
Thank you.

776
00:45:29,763 --> 00:45:31,505
Let me ask you
something.

777
00:45:32,593 --> 00:45:34,943
Would you call a female governor
a governess?

778
00:45:36,294 --> 00:45:38,426
Is a woman composer
a composeress?

779
00:45:38,513 --> 00:45:41,169
No. And her sex is entirely
beside the point.

780
00:45:41,256 --> 00:45:43,215
And a justice
of the Supreme Court

781
00:45:43,302 --> 00:45:45,478
is a justice,
not "Madam Justess."

782
00:45:49,526 --> 00:45:53,836
Now, Mr. Justice, I submit that we
are failing in our duty on this court

783
00:45:53,923 --> 00:45:56,535
if we don't try to stop the
avalanche of prurient slop...

784
00:45:56,622 --> 00:45:58,363
Madam, if you'll... I'm not
finished.

785
00:46:00,104 --> 00:46:02,977
Which is about
to bury us.

786
00:46:03,064 --> 00:46:05,416
Are we doing our job
if we permit anything?

787
00:46:05,503 --> 00:46:07,069
What are we permitting?

788
00:46:07,157 --> 00:46:08,636
Violence in the streets.

789
00:46:09,071 --> 00:46:10,422
Kids on drugs.

790
00:46:10,509 --> 00:46:12,467
Filth. Pornography.

791
00:46:12,554 --> 00:46:14,687
Who slaps the labels on? You? Me?

792
00:46:14,774 --> 00:46:16,994
Somebody better.
No, thank you, ma'am.

793
00:46:17,081 --> 00:46:19,780
I think it's unconstitutional to
set myself up as a censor.

794
00:46:19,867 --> 00:46:22,871
Refusing to look at something is
censorship.

795
00:46:22,958 --> 00:46:25,091
Hell, I don't look at television,
that doesn't make it illegal.

796
00:46:25,179 --> 00:46:27,137
That's not the point.

797
00:46:27,224 --> 00:46:30,707
Seeing that film is material to
making a judgment.

798
00:46:30,794 --> 00:46:34,014
If you'd spent 10 minutes in that
screening room. Five minutes.

799
00:46:34,101 --> 00:46:37,018
You would see how obscene, how
outrageous...

800
00:46:37,105 --> 00:46:40,675
Censorship
is an outrage.

801
00:46:40,762 --> 00:46:43,548
What about a training film for
terrorists?

802
00:46:43,635 --> 00:46:46,378
A free lecture. How To Make a Nuclear Bomb in Your Basement.

803
00:46:47,422 --> 00:46:48,902
Do you condone inciting to
violence?

804
00:46:48,989 --> 00:46:50,557
No,
ma'am.

805
00:46:50,644 --> 00:46:51,775
What about inciting to decadence?

806
00:46:52,298 --> 00:46:53,690
Define
decay.

807
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:55,084
That's what we're here for.

808
00:46:55,171 --> 00:46:56,390
Not me.

809
00:46:56,477 --> 00:46:58,783
We'd better try.

810
00:46:58,870 --> 00:47:03,311
The people of this country have only one
absolute protection against chaos.

811
00:47:03,398 --> 00:47:05,531
The law.

812
00:47:05,618 --> 00:47:07,925
And you and I were appointed to
this court for only one reason,

813
00:47:08,012 --> 00:47:10,668
to uphold and sustain that law.

814
00:47:10,755 --> 00:47:14,062
Watch out. You can't turn the law
into a straitjacket.

815
00:47:14,149 --> 00:47:16,240
The law's gotta be a suit
of clothes a man can wear.

816
00:47:16,327 --> 00:47:18,590
It's gotta fit easy,
be comfortable.

817
00:47:18,677 --> 00:47:22,334
Law shouldn't strap a man in at the
throat, or the brain, or the crotch.

818
00:47:23,988 --> 00:47:25,294
That's vivid.

819
00:47:25,381 --> 00:47:26,991
Do you know what you're doing?

820
00:47:27,078 --> 00:47:28,384
You're making Maloney more
important than the law.

821
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:30,126
He is more important
than the law!

822
00:47:30,213 --> 00:47:33,651
This court doesn't try men. We
put their trials on trial.

823
00:47:33,738 --> 00:47:36,481
That's it. We're constantly
examining the witness who isn't there.

824
00:47:36,568 --> 00:47:40,181
All we ever get to see are lawyers,
cold records, cold briefs.

825
00:47:40,269 --> 00:47:42,445
Where's the human being?
Where's the pain?  We've gotta touch flesh.

826
00:47:44,056 --> 00:47:45,840
I

827
00:47:45,927 --> 00:47:48,583
It's in the people who get hurt.

828
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:50,977
The innocent little kid who sits in
the dark theater while Maloney's filth

829
00:47:51,064 --> 00:47:52,718
pours over him.

830
00:47:52,805 --> 00:47:54,111
That's where the pain is.

831
00:47:54,198 --> 00:47:55,374
You're on the right track.

832
00:47:57,158 --> 00:47:59,596
You're beginning
to look at people.

833
00:47:59,683 --> 00:48:02,338
And when you let a little more
humanity into your thinking,

834
00:48:02,425 --> 00:48:03,819
you might make a damn good
justice.

835
00:48:04,472 --> 00:48:05,864
But I won't bet on it.

836
00:48:09,739 --> 00:48:10,957
You're just being sweet to me
because I'm a woman.

837
00:48:22,144 --> 00:48:23,538
Do I have any appointments this
afternoon?

838
00:48:23,625 --> 00:48:25,061
3:15. Miller, securi...

839
00:48:25,148 --> 00:48:26,280
Cancel it.

840
00:48:35,726 --> 00:48:37,816
Mrs. Stowe just called.

841
00:48:37,903 --> 00:48:39,644
Call her back, tell her I can't
talk to her.

842
00:48:39,731 --> 00:48:40,993
And blow your nose, please.

843
00:48:42,822 --> 00:48:44,520
I don't wanna talk to anybody. I
gotta work, I gotta concentrate.

844
00:48:44,607 --> 00:48:45,347
Yes, sir.

845
00:48:52,355 --> 00:48:53,705
He says he doesn't want to...

846
00:48:53,792 --> 00:48:56,055
I wouldn't dream
of disturbing Justice Snow.

847
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:58,841
I

848
00:48:58,928 --> 00:49:01,148
Film producer. Oh...

849
00:49:01,844 --> 00:49:03,064
There you are, Mr. Maloney.

850
00:49:03,151 --> 00:49:04,457
What?

851
00:49:04,544 --> 00:49:06,328
A respected colleague of mine,

852
00:49:06,415 --> 00:49:08,766
Mr. Justice Snow, feels that this
court

853
00:49:08,853 --> 00:49:11,378
is doing you a great injustice

854
00:49:11,465 --> 00:49:13,119
by not meeting you face-to-face.

855
00:49:13,206 --> 00:49:15,165
We ought to hear your voice,

856
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:17,081
bask in your personality.

857
00:49:17,168 --> 00:49:18,299
What was the expression he used?

858
00:49:18,387 --> 00:49:20,301
Oh, yes, we should "touch flesh."

859
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:22,783
Mason, call the guard.

860
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:24,524
Don't go, Mason.

861
00:49:24,611 --> 00:49:25,656
This might be quite
educational for all of us.

862
00:49:27,354 --> 00:49:28,703
Would you care to take the
witness stand,

863
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:29,835
Mr. Maloney?

864
00:49:34,928 --> 00:49:36,277
Going to swear me in?

865
00:49:36,364 --> 00:49:37,105
Going to lie to me?

866
00:49:39,194 --> 00:49:41,457
Maybe you better swear me in.

867
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:44,069
I

868
00:49:44,156 --> 00:49:45,549
to be the truth, the whole truth,

869
00:49:45,636 --> 00:49:46,202
and nothing but the truth, so help me
Loomis.

870
00:49:55,822 --> 00:49:57,738
Let's get right
to the point, Mr. Maloney.

871
00:49:57,825 --> 00:49:59,784
Are you aware
that you broke a law?

872
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:01,656
No, ma'am.

873
00:50:01,743 --> 00:50:03,745
You didn't realize
that the State of Nebraska

874
00:50:03,832 --> 00:50:05,921
has statutes
prohibiting pornography?

875
00:50:06,008 --> 00:50:08,882
Doesn't the First Amendment apply
to guys like me?

876
00:50:08,969 --> 00:50:12,016
Isn't it an umbrella that's
supposed to keep all of us from
getting wet?

877
00:50:12,103 --> 00:50:15,150
Or is there a hole in it over
Nebraska?

878
00:50:15,237 --> 00:50:17,153
But the people of Nebraska
have the freedom

879
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:20,461
to protect themselves
against your abuse of their freedom.

880
00:50:20,548 --> 00:50:21,941
That's what this case
is all about.

881
00:50:22,855 --> 00:50:25,990
Look, lady, I'm a businessman,

882
00:50:26,077 --> 00:50:27,774
and I don't see where the
government's got any business

883
00:50:27,861 --> 00:50:29,559
telling me how to run my business.

884
00:50:30,735 --> 00:50:32,998
Oh, I'm relieved.

885
00:50:33,085 --> 00:50:35,087
For a while, I thought you
might be thinking of yourself as an artist.

886
00:50:36,263 --> 00:50:39,048
I do recall the word "art"

887
00:50:39,135 --> 00:50:40,660
plastered across your film.

888
00:50:43,314 --> 00:50:44,751
Tell me, Mr. Maloney,

889
00:50:44,838 --> 00:50:46,493
do you honestly believe

890
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:49,539
The Naked Nymphomaniac is art?

891
00:50:49,626 --> 00:50:52,761
Sure, why not? Who's to say it
isn't? What's art anyway?

892
00:50:52,848 --> 00:50:54,458
Artists don't even know, let
alone lawyers.

893
00:50:56,417 --> 00:50:58,550
Exactly what was
your motivation

894
00:50:58,637 --> 00:51:00,379
in filming The Naked Nymphomaniac?

895
00:51:00,466 --> 00:51:02,512
Money.

896
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:04,209
You can't have much pursuit of
happiness in this country

897
00:51:04,296 --> 00:51:05,733
unless you pursue a little money.

898
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:08,910
Anything unconstitutional about
that?

899
00:51:08,997 --> 00:51:11,479
Does the Constitution give you the right to
do anything for money?

900
00:51:11,566 --> 00:51:13,481
Does it give you the right to
shove me into bankruptcy?

901
00:51:14,831 --> 00:51:17,617
The lawmakers of Nebraska want to stop the
pollution

902
00:51:17,704 --> 00:51:19,444
of the minds and morals of the
public.

903
00:51:20,098 --> 00:51:22,623
By films like yours.

904
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:24,887
My colleague on this bench, Mr.
Justice Snow...

905
00:51:24,974 --> 00:51:27,193
Fine man.
Know him very well.

906
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,719
He feels very strongly about
profit-pursuing

907
00:51:29,806 --> 00:51:31,459
conglomerates which pollute the
air.

908
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:33,070
Air is different. You've got to
breathe.

909
00:51:33,157 --> 00:51:35,290
You don't have to go to the
movies.

910
00:51:35,377 --> 00:51:38,729
State and local governments have a right
to set community standards.

911
00:51:38,816 --> 00:51:41,254
People can say, "I don't want this
kind of thing in my neighborhood."

912
00:51:41,341 --> 00:51:43,343
Is it okay for people to say,

913
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:46,565
We don't want any Baptists in our
neighborhood, damn it"?

914
00:51:46,652 --> 00:51:50,613
Your film, it's called
an exploitation film, is that correct?

915
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:52,702
Right, and you're keeping me from
exploiting it.

916
00:51:52,789 --> 00:51:54,618
Aren't you exploiting women,

917
00:51:54,705 --> 00:51:57,229
the act of love?

918
00:51:57,316 --> 00:51:59,711
Giving a distorted picture of sex
to young people?

919
00:51:59,798 --> 00:52:00,973
Who am I hurting?

920
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:03,454
I'm not talking
about bodily harm.

921
00:52:03,541 --> 00:52:06,371
Has anyone died from seeing
The Naked Nymphomaniac?

922
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:07,764
What about injury
to the spirit?

923
00:52:07,851 --> 00:52:10,158
Doesn't your
celluloid poison

924
00:52:10,245 --> 00:52:13,684
attack all human dignity
and decency and beauty?

925
00:52:13,772 --> 00:52:16,078
I don't think you like my picture.

926
00:52:16,165 --> 00:52:19,474
I think somebody had better set
some standards,

927
00:52:19,561 --> 00:52:23,610
some voice had better say,
"This far and no farther."

928
00:52:25,307 --> 00:52:27,483
You're talking like a woman, not
a justice.

929
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:29,704
You're talking like a justice, not
a witness. Sit down, Maloney.

930
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:34,884
Have you been
to New York lately?

931
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:38,278
Times Square,
44th, 45th Street?

932
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,500
It used to be a decent place to
visit.

933
00:52:41,587 --> 00:52:43,590
Unforgettable music, powerful
plays.

934
00:52:46,811 --> 00:52:49,249
Today, right around the corner on
8th Avenue,

935
00:52:49,336 --> 00:52:51,207
your picture's
probably playing

936
00:52:51,294 --> 00:52:53,384
alongside a lot of other
pornography and filth.

937
00:52:53,471 --> 00:52:55,648
Watch out, lady.

938
00:52:55,735 --> 00:52:58,477
Scratch me, put me out of
business, and who else gets scratched?

939
00:52:58,564 --> 00:53:00,915
The same end of the eraser can wipe out

940
00:53:01,002 --> 00:53:03,658
your unforgettable music and your
powerful plays.

941
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:06,008
You're sharp, Maloney.

942
00:53:06,095 --> 00:53:08,185
You pull every sleeve
inside out.

943
00:53:08,272 --> 00:53:10,578
You want the liberty
to dirty up my liberty,

944
00:53:10,666 --> 00:53:13,191
my security against

945
00:53:13,278 --> 00:53:16,934
the profiteering
two-legged cockroaches of this world,

946
00:53:17,021 --> 00:53:21,374
my right to live in a sweet
and decent society and not some kind of sewer.

947
00:53:21,461 --> 00:53:25,771
Even in New York you have
to clean up after your dog shits on the sidewalk,

948
00:53:25,858 --> 00:53:28,078
and it's a perversion
of the Constitution

949
00:53:28,165 --> 00:53:29,776
to shove our faces
into excrement

950
00:53:29,863 --> 00:53:31,560
masquerading as art.

951
00:53:32,388 --> 00:53:35,652
I'm glad I met you,
Mr. Maloney.

952
00:53:35,739 --> 00:53:38,134
I feel I have a much better
understanding of you...

953
00:53:38,221 --> 00:53:41,093
And Justice Snow.

954
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:44,054
He may want the absolute freedom
to go straight to hell,

955
00:53:44,141 --> 00:53:46,621
that's his right.

956
00:53:46,709 --> 00:53:49,625
But he has no right to force the
rest of the country to take the trip with him.

957
00:53:50,191 --> 00:53:51,453
You may step down.

958
00:53:54,196 --> 00:53:56,721
Yeah, you make a pretty good
trial lawyer.

959
00:53:56,808 --> 00:53:58,158
Too bad you had to gave it up.

960
00:53:58,245 --> 00:54:01,204
You make a very good actor.

961
00:54:01,291 --> 00:54:03,817
I may always have the feeling
there's a pornographic producer
under your robes.

962
00:54:06,821 --> 00:54:09,258
It makes me sick to my stomach

963
00:54:09,345 --> 00:54:11,564
to have to defend a principle as
noble as the First Amendment

964
00:54:11,652 --> 00:54:15,265
on the basis of that can of film
you found so offensive,

965
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:18,312
but by God, as long as I have
tongue and tonsils,

966
00:54:18,399 --> 00:54:21,141
and the ability to talk, I'll
defend everybody's right to speak,

967
00:54:21,228 --> 00:54:23,884
and every man's right to be wrong.

968
00:54:23,971 --> 00:54:26,104
I yield to you as the authority on
that, Mr. Justice.

969
00:54:29,935 --> 00:54:32,112
She's dangerous.

970
00:54:32,199 --> 00:54:33,896
That woman is positively
dangerous.

971
00:54:36,291 --> 00:54:38,467
The men on this court have got to
stick together, Mason.

972
00:54:38,554 --> 00:54:40,556
After all, there are only eight
of us left

973
00:54:40,643 --> 00:54:42,037
against all of her.

974
00:54:44,343 --> 00:54:45,910
Should we smile a little?

975
00:54:45,998 --> 00:54:49,132
Good God, no.
Who would trust a happy justice?

976
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:53,050
Should the lady be standing while the five
of us are sitting?

977
00:54:53,137 --> 00:54:55,052
This is where the newest member of
the court is supposed to be, I think.

978
00:54:55,139 --> 00:54:56,576
Ready, everybody?

979
00:54:56,663 --> 00:54:59,361
Now, please don't look
directly into the camera.

980
00:54:59,448 --> 00:55:01,451
And I think if you seem to be
looking out into space?

981
00:55:02,104 --> 00:55:03,714
Into the future?

982
00:55:03,802 --> 00:55:06,457
I can't see that far.
I didn't bring my glasses.

983
00:55:06,544 --> 00:55:08,633
You'll need more than glasses.

984
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,289
My wife always hates these
pictures. She says we all look stuffed.

985
00:55:11,376 --> 00:55:14,118
Why don't we take a snapshot of
our convictions?

986
00:55:14,205 --> 00:55:16,774
It would have to be a moving
picture, if convictions mean anything.

987
00:55:16,861 --> 00:55:18,820
My convictions don't move.

988
00:55:18,907 --> 00:55:19,951
Neither did
the dinosaurs.

989
00:55:22,912 --> 00:55:24,565
Come on, tear that one up.

990
00:55:24,652 --> 00:55:27,091
Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

991
00:55:27,178 --> 00:55:29,571
Would somebody suggest to our
great dissenter

992
00:55:29,658 --> 00:55:31,923
that he curb his celebrated sense
of humor?

993
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:34,099
He'll need all his wits to keep on

994
00:55:34,186 --> 00:55:36,580
writing
minority opinions.

995
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:39,627
Well, a man's got to decide
whether to be on the right side or the winning side.

996
00:55:39,714 --> 00:55:41,848
Once in a while,
they are the same.

997
00:55:41,935 --> 00:55:44,763
This court isn't going to reverse
the Seventh Circuit on Omnitech.

998
00:55:44,851 --> 00:55:46,897
DAN: We sure as hell won't
if we don't even hear it.

999
00:55:46,984 --> 00:55:49,160
Come on, gentlemen.
Hold that for the conference room.

1000
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:51,424
You can wreck the whole business
establishment,

1001
00:55:51,511 --> 00:55:52,730
Mr. Justice Snow,

1002
00:55:52,817 --> 00:55:55,603
with your damn socialist ideas!

1003
00:55:55,690 --> 00:55:59,129
I'm about as much of a
socialist as Donald Duck and you know it,

1004
00:55:59,216 --> 00:56:00,914
you brainwashed
Brahman!

1005
00:56:01,001 --> 00:56:03,047
Come on, come on. Harold, sit
down.

1006
00:56:04,832 --> 00:56:06,616
Come on, now. Dan,
behave yourself.

1007
00:56:06,703 --> 00:56:07,922
Here we go.

1008
00:56:10,012 --> 00:56:11,318
Destroy that negative.

1009
00:56:11,405 --> 00:56:12,623
Yes, sir.

1010
00:56:14,757 --> 00:56:15,845
Harold, try to remember
what you did with your
face last year.

1011
00:56:17,542 --> 00:56:18,456
You looked pretty good.

1012
00:56:18,543 --> 00:56:20,024
I did?

1013
00:56:20,111 --> 00:56:22,809
Just look trustworthy.

1014
00:56:22,897 --> 00:56:25,204
Somebody in Washington
better look that way.

1015
00:56:25,291 --> 00:56:27,467
Is Justice Snow implying

1016
00:56:27,554 --> 00:56:31,298
that nobody in this city, or this
country, is honest except him?

1017
00:56:32,386 --> 00:56:34,302
Oh, to hell with the picture.

1018
00:56:34,389 --> 00:56:36,043
CJ: Dan, where are you going?
We've got to finish this!

1019
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:37,740
Paste me in from last year.

1020
00:56:40,483 --> 00:56:41,745
CJ: All right, Richard, we'll try
again tomorrow.

1021
00:56:41,832 --> 00:56:43,008
RICHARD: Yes, sir.

1022
00:57:10,128 --> 00:57:11,346
It's been a pleasure.

1023
00:57:11,433 --> 00:57:12,217
Good afternoon, sir.

1024
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:25,929
Where are you going? Not to
Europe again?

1025
00:57:27,191 --> 00:57:28,237
Much farther than that.

1026
00:57:29,238 --> 00:57:31,501
Virginia.

1027
00:57:31,588 --> 00:57:33,069
Yes, you can take those two.
I'll bring these myself.

1028
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:37,464
I thought I'd be gone
before you came home.

1029
00:57:37,551 --> 00:57:40,425
Usually, that's
not very difficult.

1030
00:57:40,512 --> 00:57:43,037
I left a note for you on
the dining room table.

1031
00:57:43,124 --> 00:57:44,734
I don't want to read any notes.

1032
00:57:44,821 --> 00:57:47,041
Then you can talk it
over with my lawyers.

1033
00:57:47,128 --> 00:57:49,740
They thought that would
avoid any unnecessary unpleasantness.

1034
00:57:49,827 --> 00:57:51,394
What's so pleasant about talking
to lawyers?

1035
00:57:51,481 --> 00:57:53,093
What the hell is happening around
here?

1036
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:55,095
Maybe the court can stand your bad
temper, but I can't.

1037
00:57:55,182 --> 00:57:57,707
What do you mean,
bad temper?

1038
00:57:57,794 --> 00:57:59,491
Goddamn it, I'm the sweetest-
tempered son of a bitch in the District of Columbia!

1039
00:58:01,319 --> 00:58:02,320
Sit down.

1040
00:58:02,974 --> 00:58:04,280
Why
should
I sit down?

1041
00:58:15,597 --> 00:58:17,165
What the hell are you doing?

1042
00:58:17,252 --> 00:58:18,645
Describe the wallpaper. What
wallpaper?

1043
00:58:19,124 --> 00:58:20,386
In this room.

1044
00:58:20,473 --> 00:58:21,648
Wallpaper...

1045
00:58:21,735 --> 00:58:23,607
What color is it?

1046
00:58:23,694 --> 00:58:25,392
What design? Who memorizes
wallpaper?

1047
00:58:28,135 --> 00:58:29,919
You can't memorize
what you don't ever see.

1048
00:58:33,663 --> 00:58:35,186
Good-bye, Dan.

1049
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:56,342
Pink roses and butterflies, for
Christ's sake!

1050
00:59:00,695 --> 00:59:02,480
RUTH: How does the great dissenter

1051
00:59:02,567 --> 00:59:04,743
feel about our playing tennis
together every week?

1052
00:59:04,830 --> 00:59:06,529
I'm not sure.
I haven't told him yet.

1053
00:59:07,834 --> 00:59:10,881
Well, I must say, Dan Snow has
done a lot for my game.

1054
00:59:12,101 --> 00:59:15,016
Every time I get a high one I can
really kill.

1055
00:59:15,104 --> 00:59:17,194
That's not you on the
other side of the net.

1056
00:59:17,281 --> 00:59:19,848
That's
why they go by me so fast.

1057
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:21,590
Go change.
I'll give you a lift to
Mount Olympus.

1058
00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:25,943
How do you stand his moods, Mason?

1059
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:28,076
Every time I see him, he's ready
to explode.

1060
00:59:28,163 --> 00:59:30,600
Does he ever just relax?

1061
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:31,820
Yeah, he does have
strong feelings.

1062
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:34,649
Same as you do.

1063
00:59:34,736 --> 00:59:37,087
I hope you're
not implying that he and I are alike.

1064
00:59:37,174 --> 00:59:41,788
No, no, no.
I just mean that you
have similar differences.

1065
00:59:41,875 --> 00:59:42,963
You both care about things,

1066
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:45,052
nothing's unimportant,

1067
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:46,707
whether you're making
a point on the bench

1068
00:59:46,794 --> 00:59:47,578
or on the tennis court.

1069
00:59:59,244 --> 01:00:01,682
Does Justice Snow ever talk about
me?

1070
01:00:01,769 --> 01:00:03,162
Oh, all the time.

1071
01:00:04,989 --> 01:00:06,253
Anything quotable?

1072
01:00:07,776 --> 01:00:09,038
Well...

1073
01:00:15,829 --> 01:00:17,657
I withdraw the question.

1074
01:00:17,744 --> 01:00:18,789
Hearsay evidence.

1075
01:00:18,876 --> 01:00:19,703
Inadmissible.

1076
01:00:22,837 --> 01:00:24,056
Morning.

1077
01:00:27,321 --> 01:00:28,496
You're not a double agent, are
you, Mason?

1078
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:31,805
No, sir.

1079
01:00:31,892 --> 01:00:34,242
We just get in a set of
tennis about once a week before breakfast.

1080
01:00:36,376 --> 01:00:38,769
She plays very well for a justice
of the Supreme Court.

1081
01:00:38,856 --> 01:00:40,294
She's got a hell of a
backhand, sir.

1082
01:00:40,381 --> 01:00:42,905
Yeah, I know. I've seen it work.

1083
01:00:42,992 --> 01:00:44,821
When we found out we
were both tennis players...

1084
01:00:46,214 --> 01:00:47,215
Well, I hope you don't mind, sir.

1085
01:00:47,693 --> 01:00:49,260
Hell, no.

1086
01:00:49,347 --> 01:00:50,480
Go ahead.

1087
01:00:50,567 --> 01:00:51,742
Wear her out.

1088
01:00:52,308 --> 01:00:53,483
Yes, sir.

1089
01:00:58,402 --> 01:01:00,492
Why are you trying
to persuade me?

1090
01:01:00,579 --> 01:01:01,754
You know I won't vote to hear it.

1091
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:04,104
All right, all right!

1092
01:01:05,933 --> 01:01:07,413
We'll table this one.

1093
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,067
Why not table everything?

1094
01:01:09,154 --> 01:01:10,243
DAN: Oh, no. Abbot vs. Omnitech.

1095
01:01:12,375 --> 01:01:14,596
I think putting Omnitechon the
calendar

1096
01:01:14,683 --> 01:01:16,380
is an exercise in futility.

1097
01:01:16,467 --> 01:01:18,556
Right.
Oh, is it?

1098
01:01:18,643 --> 01:01:20,603
Perhaps if we stopped
recruiting judges

1099
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:23,170
from the jungles of Orange County,

1100
01:01:23,258 --> 01:01:26,914
maybe we can get a 4-5 court turned
into a 5-4 court.

1101
01:01:28,655 --> 01:01:31,268
I

1102
01:01:31,355 --> 01:01:33,400
That's what we're trying to save
you from, Dan.

1103
01:01:33,487 --> 01:01:36,448
Well, I don't want to be
saved! I want to keep right
on going, straight to hell.

1104
01:01:37,362 --> 01:01:38,755
What's Omnitech done?

1105
01:01:41,062 --> 01:01:43,935
That's what these little stockholders
are trying to find out.

1106
01:01:44,022 --> 01:01:46,024
But, Dan, the momentum
engine doesn't work.

1107
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:47,722
That's
what Omnitech says.

1108
01:01:47,809 --> 01:01:49,333
What about these experts who say
otherwise?

1109
01:01:51,117 --> 01:01:52,902
But we'll never know, will we?

1110
01:01:54,121 --> 01:01:57,821
Because Donald Richards, chairman
of Omnitech,

1111
01:01:57,908 --> 01:02:01,652
has bought up all the patents and
buried them.

1112
01:02:01,739 --> 01:02:04,830
This action is against Omnitech,
not Donald Richards.

1113
01:02:04,917 --> 01:02:09,314
Donald Richards is Omnitech, for
Christ's sake.

1114
01:02:09,401 --> 01:02:11,185
Where the hell is he, and why has
he disappeared?

1115
01:02:12,665 --> 01:02:13,449
Immaterial.

1116
01:02:15,756 --> 01:02:17,584
I don't see any new Constitutional
grounds

1117
01:02:17,671 --> 01:02:19,630
for us to review Omnitech.

1118
01:02:19,717 --> 01:02:21,763
If we don't hear it, who in the
hell will?

1119
01:02:21,850 --> 01:02:24,506
This is the last goddamn stop,
lady.

1120
01:02:24,593 --> 01:02:28,293
Why does Brother Snow
insist on wasting the court's valuable time?

1121
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:32,123
Because I smell plenty of
unrefrigerated fish here.

1122
01:02:32,210 --> 01:02:34,300
Muckraking.
That's all it is, Dan.

1123
01:02:34,387 --> 01:02:36,955
Do you
like being screwed?

1124
01:02:37,042 --> 01:02:39,219
Because that's what Donald
Richards is doing, you know.

1125
01:02:39,306 --> 01:02:41,352
Screwing you and me and
the whole country.

1126
01:02:41,439 --> 01:02:43,224
You're a troublemaker, you know
that?

1127
01:02:43,311 --> 01:02:44,530
Yes, I know that.
But somebody has to be, CJ.

1128
01:02:45,966 --> 01:02:47,316
Move up Omnitech.

1129
01:03:35,852 --> 01:03:36,593
Good morning,
Mr. Justice Snow.

1130
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:37,507
Morning

1131
01:03:44,863 --> 01:03:47,083
What makes you think
it's going to rain?

1132
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:49,695
The newspaper said there's an 80%
chance of rain or snow.

1133
01:03:49,782 --> 01:03:51,611
What do they know?

1134
01:03:51,698 --> 01:03:53,395
They're wrong
80% of the time.

1135
01:04:06,542 --> 01:04:08,065
That was our floor.

1136
01:04:08,152 --> 01:04:09,022
Yes. Why didn't you get out?

1137
01:04:10,110 --> 01:04:11,330
I thought you'd go first.

1138
01:04:13,637 --> 01:04:15,421
How would you like to take
a little trip with me?

1139
01:04:17,424 --> 01:04:18,077
That's what we seem to be doing.

1140
01:04:19,339 --> 01:04:21,037
Ever been to the Smithsonian?

1141
01:04:21,124 --> 01:04:23,431
Not lately.

1142
01:04:23,518 --> 01:04:26,566
Understand I wouldn't dream
of trying to change your mind for the world,

1143
01:04:26,653 --> 01:04:28,524
but there's something at the
Smithsonian I think you ought to look at.

1144
01:04:29,394 --> 01:04:31,049
Some early American pornography?

1145
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,446
Good
morning, Mr. Justice.

1146
01:04:35,533 --> 01:04:36,273
Good morning. Morning.

1147
01:04:43,281 --> 01:04:44,935
What have you got in the
briefcase, Harold,

1148
01:04:45,022 --> 01:04:46,198
dirty books?

1149
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:54,337
What I want you to see
at the Smithsonian

1150
01:04:54,424 --> 01:04:57,341
isn't even vaguely offensive to
the public sensibility.

1151
01:05:03,479 --> 01:05:04,698
What time?

1152
01:05:06,091 --> 01:05:07,615
3:00.

1153
01:05:07,702 --> 01:05:08,877
Make it 3:15.

1154
01:05:19,891 --> 01:05:21,153
We'll take my car.

1155
01:05:23,024 --> 01:05:25,245
What time does the Smithsonian
close?

1156
01:05:25,332 --> 01:05:26,507
This won't take long.

1157
01:05:39,654 --> 01:05:41,569
Why don't we
take my car?

1158
01:05:41,656 --> 01:05:42,874
It has a top.

1159
01:05:51,363 --> 01:05:53,539
Well, I guess the paper was
right about the rain.

1160
01:05:56,021 --> 01:05:58,197
First time they've been
right in 20 years.

1161
01:06:42,990 --> 01:06:45,515
Lady, what you are about to see
is a revolution.

1162
01:06:45,602 --> 01:06:47,212
Nonviolent, I hope.

1163
01:06:48,214 --> 01:06:49,215
This is it.

1164
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,220
Spin it. Go ahead.

1165
01:06:53,307 --> 01:06:53,917
Go ahead, give it a spin.
It won't hurt you.

1166
01:07:02,404 --> 01:07:04,973
That is a momentum engine.

1167
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:06,888
It's a model of course,
a prototype.

1168
01:07:06,975 --> 01:07:09,805
Imagine a flywheel
20 times heavier

1169
01:07:09,892 --> 01:07:12,286
revolving 1,000 times faster in a
sealed vacuum.

1170
01:07:13,549 --> 01:07:16,944
This could revolutionize
the entire auto industry.

1171
01:07:17,031 --> 01:07:20,122
We could have cars without gas
tanks because they wouldn't need gas to run.

1172
01:07:20,209 --> 01:07:23,039
This is what Omnitech bought and
buried.

1173
01:07:23,126 --> 01:07:26,912
If you want to change my vote on Omnitech,no, thank you.

1174
01:07:26,999 --> 01:07:31,744
I

1175
01:07:31,831 --> 01:07:34,182
Don't treat me like
a first-year law student.

1176
01:07:34,269 --> 01:07:36,271
I'm just trying to...
You're trying to change my
mind.

1177
01:07:36,358 --> 01:07:39,319
I

1178
01:07:39,406 --> 01:07:42,192
That machine is a dandy idea and
it just doesn't work.

1179
01:07:42,279 --> 01:07:43,933
It's never been given a chance to
work.

1180
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:45,674
It's been squashed.

1181
01:07:45,761 --> 01:07:47,982
Would you go to all this trouble
if I were a man?

1182
01:07:48,069 --> 01:07:49,287
One of the brothers?

1183
01:07:49,374 --> 01:07:51,507
Sex has nothing to do with it.

1184
01:07:51,594 --> 01:07:55,077
Because I'm a woman, your resplendent
male ego wants to win me over.

1185
01:07:55,164 --> 01:07:58,298
Jefferson said an educated electorate
is the basis...

1186
01:07:58,385 --> 01:08:02,564
You're an arrogant, self-centered,
male chauvinist pig.

1187
01:08:02,651 --> 01:08:04,697
You're just being sweet to me
because I'm a man.

1188
01:08:08,441 --> 01:08:10,878
I only wanted you to see
with your own eyes,

1189
01:08:10,965 --> 01:08:13,447
that gasoline isn't the only way
to store energy.

1190
01:08:14,927 --> 01:08:17,278
Well, don't expect me to believe

1191
01:08:17,365 --> 01:08:19,541
that Alice in Wonderland whirligig
could run a car.

1192
01:08:31,469 --> 01:08:32,949
Having trouble, are you?

1193
01:08:45,528 --> 01:08:46,922
Excuse me.

1194
01:08:47,009 --> 01:08:48,489
Finally
got the auto club.

1195
01:08:49,272 --> 01:08:51,145
May be a while.

1196
01:08:51,232 --> 01:08:53,495
We could take a cab
if we could get a cab.

1197
01:08:53,582 --> 01:08:55,105
Have you eaten anything?

1198
01:08:55,192 --> 01:08:56,499
No, I just got in here.
Same as you.

1199
01:08:56,586 --> 01:08:58,066
I meant today.

1200
01:08:58,675 --> 01:09:00,678
Oh, today. Well, I, um,

1201
01:09:00,765 --> 01:09:02,680
I'm not sure.
I don't keep track.

1202
01:09:02,767 --> 01:09:04,987
Do you know what that does to your blood sugar?
What do you care?

1203
01:09:05,074 --> 01:09:07,555
A person can't make valid judgments
with low blood sugar.

1204
01:09:07,642 --> 01:09:09,296
Is that any place in the Constitution?

1205
01:09:09,383 --> 01:09:11,256
Well... Good evening.

1206
01:09:11,343 --> 01:09:13,562
I

1207
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:15,783
I think you are hungry and you just
don't know it.

1208
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:17,002
I'm not hungry
and I know it.

1209
01:09:17,089 --> 01:09:18,830
I'll order something for you.

1210
01:09:22,573 --> 01:09:25,664
You're not telling her
to put poison in my food, are you?

1211
01:09:25,751 --> 01:09:26,970
I don't know how to say poison.

1212
01:09:38,418 --> 01:09:41,248
I appreciate
your concern about my insides.

1213
01:09:41,335 --> 01:09:43,033
Dome a favor, will you? Put your
hand over your eyes?

1214
01:09:43,424 --> 01:09:44,643
Why?

1215
01:09:44,731 --> 01:09:45,819
A test.

1216
01:09:48,343 --> 01:09:49,431
What's on the wall?
Wallpaper.

1217
01:09:49,955 --> 01:09:51,130
Uh, what color?

1218
01:09:51,217 --> 01:09:52,609
Gold. Any pattern?

1219
01:09:52,696 --> 01:09:54,394
Yes. What is it?

1220
01:09:54,481 --> 01:09:55,962
Cherry blossoms with bluebirds.

1221
01:10:00,402 --> 01:10:01,794
How the hell
did you know that?

1222
01:10:01,882 --> 01:10:03,927
I saw it when we came in!

1223
01:10:04,014 --> 01:10:06,409
You go around looking
at wallpaper everyplace?

1224
01:10:06,496 --> 01:10:08,106
My God, that's what's
wrong with you!

1225
01:10:08,193 --> 01:10:10,196
Your brains are
full of wallpaper.

1226
01:10:10,283 --> 01:10:11,806
Well, your brain is full of...

1227
01:10:11,894 --> 01:10:13,243
Watch that.
Watch...

1228
01:10:14,941 --> 01:10:15,942
People...
People here...

1229
01:10:18,336 --> 01:10:22,819
I was going to say momentum engines
and Omnitech.

1230
01:10:22,907 --> 01:10:25,780
Omnitech may be the most importance case
of this decade.

1231
01:10:25,867 --> 01:10:28,087
When one tiny group of
stockholders tries to

1232
01:10:28,174 --> 01:10:29,306
undermine a
great corporation...

1233
01:10:29,393 --> 01:10:31,221
Big. Huge.
Not necessarily great.

1234
01:10:34,269 --> 01:10:37,315
How come the president
of Omnitech didn't show up at his own trial?

1235
01:10:37,402 --> 01:10:40,058
Don Richards doesn't want the
courts to put him out of business!

1236
01:10:40,145 --> 01:10:41,973
Rule against Omnitech, and down
goes the whole corporate system.

1237
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:43,540
Only the abuses.

1238
01:10:43,627 --> 01:10:45,543
In your isolated opinion.

1239
01:10:45,630 --> 01:10:49,374
Not so isolated.
We have statutes that define the abuses.

1240
01:10:49,461 --> 01:10:51,332
If we try to extend our
jurisdiction... All I'm asking is what's fair.

1241
01:10:51,419 --> 01:10:52,594
.into legislative area.

1242
01:10:52,681 --> 01:10:54,815
Don't you see? Omnitech must win.

1243
01:10:54,902 --> 01:10:57,122
Oh, you think that, do you?
Yes!

1244
01:10:57,209 --> 01:10:59,690
Well it seems to me anything can
happen, no matter how great the odds.

1245
01:10:59,777 --> 01:11:02,171
That's what makes
this country so wonderful.

1246
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:04,348
I absolutely agree with you.

1247
01:11:06,307 --> 01:11:09,180
But do you know what I believe more
than anything else? You said it on the bench!

1248
01:11:09,267 --> 01:11:11,487
You said, "The noblest purpose of
this high court

1249
01:11:12,923 --> 01:11:15,274
is to keep the government off
the backs of the people."

1250
01:11:15,361 --> 01:11:17,059
People, yes.
Not the large...

1251
01:11:17,146 --> 01:11:18,887
Aren't corporations people?

1252
01:11:18,975 --> 01:11:20,411
Owned by people, run by
people. ...not the large.

1253
01:11:20,498 --> 01:11:22,543
Not the large...
For the benefit of people?

1254
01:11:22,630 --> 01:11:24,982
Not the large...

1255
01:11:25,069 --> 01:11:26,766
And they may be destroyed by people
on the high court who seem to have

1256
01:11:26,853 --> 01:11:28,899
forgotten some of their earlier
and wiser opinions.

1257
01:11:28,987 --> 01:11:30,771
Ah, the hell with this!

1258
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:34,906
You haven't eaten your dim sum.

1259
01:11:34,994 --> 01:11:36,908
To hell with my dim sum!

1260
01:11:36,996 --> 01:11:39,521
What about your blood sugar?

1261
01:11:39,608 --> 01:11:42,132
To hell with my blood sugar. All I
wanted anyhow was a cup of coffee and a fork.

1262
01:11:42,219 --> 01:11:43,526
Is something wrong, sir?
Yes. Everything.

1263
01:11:43,613 --> 01:11:45,093
Give me a check!

1264
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:46,746
I'll take the check.

1265
01:11:46,833 --> 01:11:49,533
Yes, you do that. You'll feel much
better about it.

1266
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:51,274
And don't worry about me.
I'll be just fine. I'll take a cab.

1267
01:11:51,578 --> 01:11:52,537
Good.

1268
01:11:54,930 --> 01:11:56,454
It's nothing personal.

1269
01:11:56,541 --> 01:11:59,284
He's just very upset.

1270
01:11:59,371 --> 01:12:00,502
He's been working too hard.

1271
01:12:15,216 --> 01:12:16,521
I don't have any
money for a cab.

1272
01:13:29,566 --> 01:13:31,699
Good night, Madam Justice.

1273
01:13:31,786 --> 01:13:34,137
Would you see that these
are delivered to Justice Snow in the morning?

1274
01:13:34,224 --> 01:13:35,225
Justice Snow's still here.

1275
01:13:36,488 --> 01:13:37,750
I don't think so.

1276
01:13:37,837 --> 01:13:38,794
He's in the court, ma'am.

1277
01:13:39,882 --> 01:13:41,058
This late?

1278
01:13:41,146 --> 01:13:41,972
Yes, ma'am.

1279
01:13:45,237 --> 01:13:46,369
Okay. Thank you.

1280
01:14:24,327 --> 01:14:25,416
How long have you been here?

1281
01:14:26,548 --> 01:14:27,984
Since October.

1282
01:14:31,031 --> 01:14:33,208
I'm not sure the lady has enough
seniority

1283
01:14:33,295 --> 01:14:35,167
to haunt these chambers at, uh,

1284
01:14:36,777 --> 01:14:39,433
1:20 in the morning.

1285
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:41,174
What the hell are you doing here
so late?

1286
01:14:41,261 --> 01:14:42,567
Studying for finals.

1287
01:14:45,919 --> 01:14:47,094
What about you?

1288
01:14:49,402 --> 01:14:52,231
Well, I used to think I lived in
Georgetown,

1289
01:14:52,318 --> 01:14:53,536
but I guess this is more my
permanent residence.

1290
01:14:57,846 --> 01:15:01,590
I brought you these.
A few opinions of mine from the lower court.

1291
01:15:03,113 --> 01:15:04,681
I

1292
01:15:04,768 --> 01:15:05,638
You're welcome.

1293
01:15:07,161 --> 01:15:08,511
May I ask you a question?

1294
01:15:10,949 --> 01:15:11,993
Sure.

1295
01:15:15,650 --> 01:15:17,348
Other than my blood sugar

1296
01:15:17,435 --> 01:15:18,872
and my bad table manners,

1297
01:15:20,656 --> 01:15:23,093
exactly how repulsive do you
think I am?

1298
01:15:24,531 --> 01:15:26,272
Do you want my opinion as a
justice of the Supreme Court?

1299
01:15:26,359 --> 01:15:27,838
No, no, no.

1300
01:15:27,925 --> 01:15:29,058
As a woman.

1301
01:15:32,844 --> 01:15:34,107
You want to take the Fifth?

1302
01:15:34,847 --> 01:15:36,109
Maybe one of us
had better.

1303
01:15:41,768 --> 01:15:43,423
My car runs now.

1304
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:44,903
Would you like a lift home?

1305
01:15:45,338 --> 01:15:47,775
No.

1306
01:15:47,862 --> 01:15:49,909
Pretty cool around the Snow
household these days.

1307
01:15:50,779 --> 01:15:52,215
I heard that.

1308
01:15:52,303 --> 01:15:54,480
I'm sorry.

1309
01:15:54,567 --> 01:15:56,003
It's your fault, you know.

1310
01:15:56,873 --> 01:16:00,051
My fault?

1311
01:16:00,138 --> 01:16:03,404
I think my wife thinks that I spend
so much time being furious at you that I don't

1312
01:16:03,491 --> 01:16:05,406
have enough energy left to be
furious with her.

1313
01:16:06,972 --> 01:16:09,106
And I have a hunch

1314
01:16:12,937 --> 01:16:14,460
she thinks I consider you attractive.

1315
01:16:16,723 --> 01:16:19,771
There's certainly
no evidence to support that contention.

1316
01:16:19,858 --> 01:16:23,732
Oh, I wouldn't be too sure about
that.

1317
01:16:23,819 --> 01:16:26,474
I hope you assured Mrs. Snow that
the mere fact one of your

1318
01:16:26,561 --> 01:16:28,129
colleagues happens
to be a woman...

1319
01:16:28,216 --> 01:16:29,739
That's no mere fact.

1320
01:16:29,826 --> 01:16:31,437
That's an overwhelming fact.

1321
01:16:31,524 --> 01:16:33,744
But I've never been prejudiced by
sex.

1322
01:16:33,831 --> 01:16:34,876
Entertained, yes. Prejudiced,
never.

1323
01:16:36,094 --> 01:16:38,054
Yes, yes, yes.

1324
01:16:38,141 --> 01:16:40,926
This is a dandy. I remember it well.

1325
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:42,799
I don't agree with a word of
it, but it's well-written.

1326
01:16:45,323 --> 01:16:48,109
How can you be so goddamned
logical

1327
01:16:48,196 --> 01:16:49,154
and so goddamned wrong?

1328
01:16:51,852 --> 01:16:54,682
What's so wrong about encouraging
the economy?

1329
01:16:54,769 --> 01:16:57,033
I

1330
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:00,036
about improving the quality of
life on this planet

1331
01:17:00,123 --> 01:17:01,255
and I
agree with you, Dan.

1332
01:17:03,301 --> 01:17:04,520
Justice Snow.

1333
01:17:04,607 --> 01:17:05,739
Dan is fine.

1334
01:17:08,220 --> 01:17:09,570
Look what these great companies
have done for us.

1335
01:17:09,657 --> 01:17:10,875
Large companies.

1336
01:17:10,962 --> 01:17:12,661
Large.
Large.

1337
01:17:12,748 --> 01:17:14,880
Are we going to throw those
benefits away?

1338
01:17:14,967 --> 01:17:16,970
Should I take my weekly wash down
to the banks of the Potomac River and

1339
01:17:17,057 --> 01:17:18,145
and beat it with rocks?

1340
01:17:18,232 --> 01:17:19,364
Won't get it very clean.

1341
01:17:21,322 --> 01:17:23,978
If we reverse the
Seventh Circuit on Omnitech...

1342
01:17:24,065 --> 01:17:26,285
If it's so damn important,

1343
01:17:26,373 --> 01:17:29,681
why doesn't Donald Richards
stand trial?

1344
01:17:30,421 --> 01:17:31,901
What do you want to know?

1345
01:17:31,988 --> 01:17:33,860
You're not Donald Richards,

1346
01:17:33,947 --> 01:17:35,122
and he's the one
with the answers.

1347
01:17:45,787 --> 01:17:47,833
Swear me in.

1348
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:49,661
Oh, you want to play that game
again.

1349
01:17:50,401 --> 01:17:52,665
All right. You're sworn.

1350
01:17:52,752 --> 01:17:55,102
I am delighted, Mr. Donald
Richards,

1351
01:17:55,189 --> 01:17:57,236
to have you here at last.

1352
01:17:57,323 --> 01:17:58,716
In the flesh, so to speak.

1353
01:18:00,849 --> 01:18:03,809
Would you state your occupation,
please?

1354
01:18:03,896 --> 01:18:07,509
I'm president and chairman of the board of
Omnitech International.

1355
01:18:07,596 --> 01:18:10,251
Why did you refuse to testify in
the suit against your company?

1356
01:18:11,471 --> 01:18:13,385
I never received a subpoena.

1357
01:18:13,473 --> 01:18:16,433
They have to know where you are
to serve it.

1358
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:20,045
But you deliberately made yourself
unavailable, remained in hiding.

1359
01:18:22,701 --> 01:18:24,355
Doesn't an American citizen

1360
01:18:24,442 --> 01:18:25,575
have a right to privacy?

1361
01:18:26,227 --> 01:18:28,099
Tell me something, sir.

1362
01:18:28,186 --> 01:18:31,364
I

1363
01:18:32,713 --> 01:18:34,759
I'm the majority stockholder.

1364
01:18:34,846 --> 01:18:37,240
Yes. I kind of thought you were.

1365
01:18:37,327 --> 01:18:40,026
Now,what about all those little
stockholders

1366
01:18:40,114 --> 01:18:43,334
who got wind of the appalling
notion

1367
01:18:43,421 --> 01:18:48,427
that you, Mr.  Richards, grabbed up an
earthshaking idea and strangled it.

1368
01:18:48,515 --> 01:18:50,866
You know what
I find appalling?

1369
01:18:50,953 --> 01:18:52,911
That you have the
arrogance to pass

1370
01:18:52,998 --> 01:18:55,219
judgment on something you don't
know anything about.

1371
01:18:55,306 --> 01:18:57,613
But you do, Mr. Richards?

1372
01:18:57,700 --> 01:19:00,225
When we test something,
like the momentum engine,

1373
01:19:00,312 --> 01:19:02,575
and we find out it doesn't work,

1374
01:19:02,662 --> 01:19:06,101
we drop it and spend
our time and money on something that will work.

1375
01:19:06,188 --> 01:19:09,365
What about the experts who say it
does work?

1376
01:19:09,452 --> 01:19:12,195
You think I would
deliberately dump an idea

1377
01:19:12,282 --> 01:19:14,634
that could make millions for my
stockholders?

1378
01:19:14,721 --> 01:19:17,114
But you've got billions committed

1379
01:19:17,201 --> 01:19:19,727
to the internal combustion engine.

1380
01:19:19,814 --> 01:19:23,948
Omnitech makes spark plugs, you
wanna go on making spark plugs.

1381
01:19:24,035 --> 01:19:27,431
There's money in carburetors. You
wanna go on making carburetors.

1382
01:19:27,518 --> 01:19:30,522
You've got vested interests in 16
oil companies.

1383
01:19:30,609 --> 01:19:33,699
You wanna go on selling gas.

1384
01:19:33,786 --> 01:19:36,834
You have one noble purpose, Mr.
Richards, to keep things the way they are.

1385
01:19:38,575 --> 01:19:41,753
An idea doesn't just turn
into a reality.

1386
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,842
Some thing's gotta
make it happen.

1387
01:19:43,930 --> 01:19:46,715
It takes money
to build factories,

1388
01:19:46,802 --> 01:19:48,892
grind out a product,
advertise it, sell it.

1389
01:19:48,979 --> 01:19:52,330
Did you ever hear
of a box of cereal

1390
01:19:52,417 --> 01:19:54,507
or a tube of toothpaste
going out and giving birth to itself?

1391
01:19:54,595 --> 01:19:56,945
Do you know what it takes?

1392
01:19:57,032 --> 01:19:59,862
Capital. Capital. You're
damn right.

1393
01:19:59,949 --> 01:20:02,516
And I'm not going to
commit my corporation

1394
01:20:02,604 --> 01:20:04,998
to the expenditure of millions of
dollars on an idea

1395
01:20:05,085 --> 01:20:06,739
that just doesn't work.

1396
01:20:06,826 --> 01:20:08,481
That you say doesn't work.

1397
01:20:08,873 --> 01:20:10,570
Look.

1398
01:20:10,657 --> 01:20:12,920
Thomas Edison dreamed up the
electric light bulb.

1399
01:20:13,007 --> 01:20:15,271
The government gave him a patent.

1400
01:20:15,358 --> 01:20:17,360
So that he could profit from his
invention.

1401
01:20:17,447 --> 01:20:20,538
Fine! But the light itself belongs
to everybody,

1402
01:20:20,626 --> 01:20:23,499
and nobody... Nobody has a right

1403
01:20:23,586 --> 01:20:26,371
to turn on the darkness.

1404
01:20:26,458 --> 01:20:30,507
You dare accuse me,
my company, my companies, of practices

1405
01:20:30,594 --> 01:20:32,117
that belong in the Dark Ages?

1406
01:20:32,204 --> 01:20:35,078
Then let there be light!

1407
01:20:35,165 --> 01:20:36,470
Come out of the dark, Donald
Richards!

1408
01:20:36,557 --> 01:20:38,256
Who are you?

1409
01:20:38,343 --> 01:20:39,605
What do you look like? Where have
you been?

1410
01:20:41,781 --> 01:20:43,828
Holy Christ.

1411
01:20:43,915 --> 01:20:46,961
You know what I think? I think
you're dead, Donald Richards.

1412
01:20:47,048 --> 01:20:51,271
I think you've been dead for a long
time. Eight, maybe 10 years.

1413
01:20:51,358 --> 01:20:53,491
It's been that long since anyone has
seen you.

1414
01:20:53,578 --> 01:20:56,843
And if you are dead, who is
running Omnitech?

1415
01:20:56,930 --> 01:20:59,237
Who actually holds all that power?

1416
01:20:59,324 --> 01:21:01,544
Some cabal of faceless men

1417
01:21:01,631 --> 01:21:03,590
without names, without
fingerprints,

1418
01:21:03,678 --> 01:21:06,028
without Social Security numbers,

1419
01:21:06,115 --> 01:21:08,640
who are compounding your
suppression of the momentum engine

1420
01:21:08,727 --> 01:21:10,381
by hiding behind a dead man?

1421
01:21:11,295 --> 01:21:13,298
Why would anybody
want to do that?

1422
01:21:13,385 --> 01:21:15,909
Hell of a lot of reasons. Dodge
inheritance taxes,

1423
01:21:15,996 --> 01:21:17,999
avoid a power struggle.

1424
01:21:18,086 --> 01:21:20,306
Hang on to government contracts.

1425
01:21:20,393 --> 01:21:24,093
Omnitech is a phantom government
hiding behind a dead man.

1426
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:25,486
We can't see it. We didn't elect
it.

1427
01:21:25,573 --> 01:21:27,141
It doesn't exist. It never dies!

1428
01:21:29,447 --> 01:21:31,798
Why don't we hoist up a new flag?

1429
01:21:31,885 --> 01:21:34,715
The star-spangled Omnitech!

1430
01:21:34,802 --> 01:21:37,153
Omnitech rules the waves!

1431
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:39,111
Omnitech uber alles!

1432
01:21:41,418 --> 01:21:42,376
Ugh.

1433
01:21:44,117 --> 01:21:45,031
Ugh.

1434
01:21:46,511 --> 01:21:48,296
Oh.

1435
01:21:49,689 --> 01:21:50,559
Dan, are you all right?

1436
01:21:51,953 --> 01:21:55,609
Yeah, sure.
It was a lot of fun.

1437
01:21:55,696 --> 01:21:57,307
I enjoyed it.

1438
01:22:28,388 --> 01:22:29,476
ATTENDANT: One...

1439
01:22:29,563 --> 01:22:30,870
Two...

1440
01:22:31,871 --> 01:22:33,133
Up.

1441
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:46,627
What do the doctors say?

1442
01:22:46,714 --> 01:22:48,238
They don't know.
They're making tests.

1443
01:22:48,325 --> 01:22:50,589
Is he in any pain? No, I
don't think so.

1444
01:22:50,676 --> 01:22:52,373
I don't ever remember Dan being
sick before.

1445
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:54,375
He considers it
unconstitutional.

1446
01:22:56,901 --> 01:22:58,859
I

1447
01:23:02,864 --> 01:23:04,953
Are you ready, gentlemen
and Madam Justice?

1448
01:23:09,872 --> 01:23:13,311
After today's session,
I need 24 hours. Oh?

1449
01:23:13,398 --> 01:23:15,184
I have to go to California. There's
something I have to be absolutely sure about.

1450
01:23:15,575 --> 01:23:16,446
Of course.

1451
01:23:21,365 --> 01:23:23,280
PILOT: Ladies and gentlemen,
we are making our descent

1452
01:23:23,367 --> 01:23:25,761
to John Wayne Orange County Airport.

1453
01:23:25,849 --> 01:23:27,285
Pl ease be sure your seat belt is securely fastened.

1454
01:23:35,556 --> 01:23:38,080
ANNOUNCER: Golden West Airlines announces Flight 710

1455
01:23:38,167 --> 01:23:39,473
from Los Angeles

1456
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:40,388
now arriving at Gate 8.

1457
01:23:49,050 --> 01:23:50,879
Welcome home, Madam Justice.

1458
01:23:50,966 --> 01:23:54,099
You look fabulous.
Thanks, Bill. Thanks for meeting me.

1459
01:23:54,186 --> 01:23:55,710
Thank you for letting me.
How about your luggage?

1460
01:23:56,450 --> 01:23:58,583
This is it. That's it?

1461
01:23:58,670 --> 01:24:00,760
I have to catch the red-eye back
tonight.

1462
01:24:00,847 --> 01:24:02,457
You're kidding! I had a lot
of things arranged for us.

1463
01:24:03,632 --> 01:24:05,635
I'm a working girl.

1464
01:24:05,722 --> 01:24:08,116
Not even one set?
I was planning on beating you this time.

1465
01:24:08,203 --> 01:24:09,902
The court sits tomorrow morning.

1466
01:24:11,512 --> 01:24:13,383
Well, you were right.

1467
01:24:13,470 --> 01:24:15,343
Loomis and Loomis
did have dealings with Omnitech.

1468
01:24:19,435 --> 01:24:21,045
But I don't think it's anything you
should be worried about.

1469
01:24:24,528 --> 01:24:26,399
I

1470
01:24:26,486 --> 01:24:27,748
lasted about five minutes.

1471
01:24:28,575 --> 01:24:30,970
Is this all there is?
That's it.

1472
01:24:31,057 --> 01:24:34,453
Now, I've made reservations for
lunch at a great new place right on the water.

1473
01:24:34,540 --> 01:24:36,934
But first, if you don't mind,
let's stop by the office.

1474
01:24:37,021 --> 01:24:39,111
Lots of people there would like to see what a
Supreme Court Justice looks like.

1475
01:24:40,416 --> 01:24:41,243
What's the matter?

1476
01:24:46,989 --> 01:24:48,426
Never could read your husband's
shorthand.

1477
01:24:48,731 --> 01:24:50,254
I can.

1478
01:24:52,561 --> 01:24:53,955
Take me to
Bekins warehouse.

1479
01:24:54,042 --> 01:24:54,781
What for?

1480
01:24:55,608 --> 01:24:57,045
Just take me.

1481
01:25:04,445 --> 01:25:06,578
Loomis' records
are on the left hand side, at the end.

1482
01:25:37,833 --> 01:25:38,704
Why is this one locked?

1483
01:25:39,966 --> 01:25:42,186
Big surprise to me.

1484
01:25:42,273 --> 01:25:44,624
I never thought of the
Supreme Court as an investigative body.

1485
01:25:44,711 --> 01:25:45,625
What's in there?

1486
01:25:46,843 --> 01:25:47,671
You don't want to know.

1487
01:25:48,585 --> 01:25:49,543
Give me the key.

1488
01:25:50,457 --> 01:25:51,806
Don't tell me you haven't got it.

1489
01:26:26,892 --> 01:26:28,198
You knew about this all along,
didn't you?

1490
01:26:29,852 --> 01:26:31,027
So did your husband.

1491
01:26:32,073 --> 01:26:33,335
Reverend Loomis
preached the sermon.

1492
01:26:33,422 --> 01:26:34,423
I just said amen.

1493
01:26:35,772 --> 01:26:37,079
I don't believe this.

1494
01:26:39,124 --> 01:26:40,212
I just
don't believe this.

1495
01:26:40,299 --> 01:26:42,346
Good. It's better
that way.

1496
01:26:42,433 --> 01:26:44,043
Put the file away,

1497
01:26:44,130 --> 01:26:45,262
turn the key and it never happened.

1498
01:26:48,004 --> 01:26:49,963
If you think I'm going to shove
this back into the dark

1499
01:26:50,050 --> 01:26:53,054
to protect you, or the firm or myself,

1500
01:26:54,316 --> 01:26:56,013
you're dead wrong.

1501
01:26:56,102 --> 01:26:58,104
Get me the references on Dalton v. Utah.

1502
01:26:59,235 --> 01:27:01,543
And I want a facsimile

1503
01:27:01,630 --> 01:27:03,545
of the black letter that's on my
desk on top of Sparey v. Virginia.

1504
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,157
Right.

1505
01:27:06,244 --> 01:27:07,637
You shouldn't be
out of bed, Mr. Justice.

1506
01:27:08,768 --> 01:27:10,945
Nurse, can you lend me a quarter?

1507
01:27:11,032 --> 01:27:14,210
Uh, just a minute, operator,
reverse the charges, will you?

1508
01:27:15,995 --> 01:27:17,910
Yes, just reverse... Make it a collect...

1509
01:27:17,997 --> 01:27:20,173
Mason, tell the operator you'll
pay for the call, will you?

1510
01:27:22,089 --> 01:27:24,309
Justice Snow is at the telephone
again.

1511
01:27:25,310 --> 01:27:27,182
I'm aware of that, Mason.

1512
01:27:27,269 --> 01:27:29,228
I am aware of that.

1513
01:27:29,315 --> 01:27:30,926
Just because I'm in a hospital

1514
01:27:31,013 --> 01:27:34,234
doesn't mean my mind isn't functioning.

1515
01:27:34,321 --> 01:27:36,411
Listen, don't let them take
that Omnitechvote without me.

1516
01:27:40,241 --> 01:27:43,201
NURSE OVER PA: Dr. Hollerand,
please call extension 429...

1517
01:27:47,598 --> 01:27:49,904
Will the head surgical nurse call the main desk, please?

1518
01:27:54,693 --> 01:27:57,349
Dr. Singh, please go to the orthopedic wing.

1519
01:27:58,524 --> 01:28:00,701
Dr. Singh, go to the orthopedic wing.

1520
01:28:03,530 --> 01:28:04,792
You have just dropped

1521
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:07,839
American justice on the floor.

1522
01:28:07,926 --> 01:28:09,667
NURSE OVER PA: Dr. Foley, please go to admitting.

1523
01:28:13,150 --> 01:28:14,195
Hi.

1524
01:28:15,762 --> 01:28:16,981
Come on in.

1525
01:28:20,290 --> 01:28:21,465
How are you?

1526
01:28:21,552 --> 01:28:22,683
How are you?

1527
01:28:22,770 --> 01:28:24,686
I'm fine.

1528
01:28:24,773 --> 01:28:26,558
Pay no attention to
the buzzards circling above the building.

1529
01:28:27,907 --> 01:28:30,258
You know what they did? They
yanked out my telephone.

1530
01:28:30,345 --> 01:28:32,129
How do they expect you to
get any work done around here?

1531
01:28:32,217 --> 01:28:35,612
Hey, what are you doing?
I'm not going to fall out.

1532
01:28:35,699 --> 01:28:38,485
You know they can kill you in a
hospital if you don't stick up for your rights.

1533
01:28:38,572 --> 01:28:40,966
You be a good boy now, Mr.
Justice.

1534
01:28:41,053 --> 01:28:42,446
Oh, shut up.
And don't give us any more trouble.

1535
01:28:42,533 --> 01:28:43,186
Get me another pillow.

1536
01:28:45,276 --> 01:28:46,146
Maybe I should talk to you another
time, Dan.

1537
01:28:46,843 --> 01:28:48,584
No, no, no.

1538
01:28:48,671 --> 01:28:50,326
What's the problem?
Come here.

1539
01:28:54,983 --> 01:28:56,724
I just wanted to tell you this

1540
01:28:56,811 --> 01:28:58,160
before you heard it from somebody
else.

1541
01:28:59,032 --> 01:29:00,816
I went to California for the day.

1542
01:29:00,903 --> 01:29:01,904
Couldn't take it, huh?

1543
01:29:03,558 --> 01:29:04,865
I'm resigning from the court.

1544
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:07,694
Why would you do a
damn fool thing like that?

1545
01:29:09,174 --> 01:29:12,787
I found out that Jack, my husband,

1546
01:29:12,874 --> 01:29:15,878
and our law firm were involved
with Omnitech.

1547
01:29:18,534 --> 01:29:20,492
Good morning, Dan. Morning.

1548
01:29:20,579 --> 01:29:22,929
Dr. Fogger,
Madam Justice Loomis.

1549
01:29:23,016 --> 01:29:24,367
Oh. Oh, well... How do you do?

1550
01:29:24,454 --> 01:29:25,977
Hello. It's a pleasure.

1551
01:29:26,064 --> 01:29:28,240
Somebody swiped my telephone, Doctor.

1552
01:29:28,328 --> 01:29:30,635
No, no, no. We took it out, Dan.
We want you to rest.

1553
01:29:30,722 --> 01:29:32,985
How do you expect me to rest
without a telephone?

1554
01:29:33,072 --> 01:29:34,988
That logic will get you nowhere.

1555
01:29:35,075 --> 01:29:37,991
Would you please stop trying to
change the hospital rules?

1556
01:29:39,472 --> 01:29:41,691
The First Amendment to the Constitution does not
apply in hospitals.

1557
01:29:43,738 --> 01:29:44,565
It should.

1558
01:30:19,258 --> 01:30:21,043
What the hell
are you doing here?

1559
01:30:21,130 --> 01:30:22,174
Official business of the federal
government.

1560
01:30:23,568 --> 01:30:24,613
May I come in?

1561
01:30:27,180 --> 01:30:28,574
Oh, did I get you in the middle
of something?

1562
01:30:28,661 --> 01:30:29,793
I'm sorry.

1563
01:30:31,882 --> 01:30:34,451
What did you do, just get up and
walk out?

1564
01:30:34,538 --> 01:30:37,324
Yes, ma'am.
This is very nice.

1565
01:30:37,411 --> 01:30:39,674
They told me you're still under observation.

1566
01:30:39,761 --> 01:30:41,502
It's bigger than my place.
They don't even know what happened to you.

1567
01:30:41,589 --> 01:30:43,026
Well, they'll have to figure it
out without me.

1568
01:30:43,113 --> 01:30:44,811
I can't give them
any more of my time.

1569
01:30:44,898 --> 01:30:46,073
Dan, if it was a coronary...

1570
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:47,858
Coronary?

1571
01:30:47,945 --> 01:30:50,600
My heart wouldn't
dare attack me.

1572
01:30:50,687 --> 01:30:52,995
Now what's all this
crap about quitting?

1573
01:30:53,430 --> 01:30:54,649
Do you mind?

1574
01:31:01,091 --> 01:31:03,094
Why don't you lie down?

1575
01:31:03,181 --> 01:31:05,313
That's okay. I'll be all
right in a minute. Put your feet up.

1576
01:31:05,401 --> 01:31:06,577
Can I get you a pillow?

1577
01:31:06,664 --> 01:31:07,839
Sure, why not?

1578
01:31:25,903 --> 01:31:27,253
Are you asleep?

1579
01:31:27,340 --> 01:31:28,341
Yes.

1580
01:31:32,346 --> 01:31:33,391
Here.

1581
01:31:39,703 --> 01:31:41,009
You want to tell me what's wrong?

1582
01:31:42,576 --> 01:31:45,100
Are you well
enough to talk?

1583
01:31:45,187 --> 01:31:46,320
I

1584
01:31:49,715 --> 01:31:51,544
The other night,

1585
01:31:51,631 --> 01:31:53,197
you made an outrageous statement.

1586
01:31:54,547 --> 01:31:56,114
You said you didn't
think Donald Richards was still alive.

1587
01:32:02,948 --> 01:32:04,776
I got this out of a sealed
Loomis and Loomis file
in Santa Ana.

1588
01:32:08,477 --> 01:32:10,043
It's Donald Richards'
death certificate.

1589
01:32:10,130 --> 01:32:11,306
Holy God.

1590
01:32:13,178 --> 01:32:14,092
Anybody else see this?

1591
01:32:14,179 --> 01:32:15,093
No.

1592
01:32:17,662 --> 01:32:19,054
This makes Omnitecha whole new
ballgame.

1593
01:32:21,275 --> 01:32:22,929
God, are we going to shake up the
brothers!

1594
01:32:24,844 --> 01:32:26,977
Get your clothes on.

1595
01:32:27,064 --> 01:32:27,674
We can still make that morning
conference.

1596
01:32:28,152 --> 01:32:29,719
I'm not going.

1597
01:32:29,980 --> 01:32:31,200
What?

1598
01:32:31,287 --> 01:32:33,028
I told you.

1599
01:32:33,115 --> 01:32:35,553
I'm resigning from the court.

1600
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:37,120
That's idiotic. It doesn't make any sense.

1601
01:32:37,947 --> 01:32:40,341
My husband knew.

1602
01:32:40,428 --> 01:32:44,912
Jack knew that Donald Richards
died in Costa Rica in 1973.

1603
01:32:44,999 --> 01:32:46,348
And he was part of the
conspiracy to cover it up.

1604
01:32:46,435 --> 01:32:48,307
Did you know?

1605
01:32:48,394 --> 01:32:50,266
Did your husband ever tell you
anything about it?

1606
01:32:50,353 --> 01:32:52,617
No. Of course not.

1607
01:32:52,704 --> 01:32:54,924
Then there's no reason to resign.

1608
01:32:55,011 --> 01:32:56,491
Get some clothes on. Let's get
down there.

1609
01:32:59,233 --> 01:33:02,019
If there's the slightest doubt in
anybody's mind that I belong there,

1610
01:33:03,194 --> 01:33:05,284
I don't want to be there.

1611
01:33:05,371 --> 01:33:07,939
Lady, that is extremely noble,

1612
01:33:08,026 --> 01:33:09,071
but goddamned wrong.

1613
01:33:14,164 --> 01:33:16,559
What do you think I should do, Dan?
What's protocol?

1614
01:33:16,646 --> 01:33:18,125
Should I write the President?

1615
01:33:18,212 --> 01:33:19,388
You don't write anybody. Keep
your robes on.

1616
01:33:19,475 --> 01:33:20,955
Let the mud fly. It won't stick
to you.

1617
01:33:21,042 --> 01:33:23,697
Quitting the court without good reason

1618
01:33:23,784 --> 01:33:26,222
is spitting in the face of the
government that put you there.

1619
01:33:26,309 --> 01:33:28,834
Without good reason?
I've got good reason.

1620
01:33:28,921 --> 01:33:30,967
Because of something your husband did
that you know nothing about?

1621
01:33:31,054 --> 01:33:32,186
When you're married
to somebody you become...

1622
01:33:32,273 --> 01:33:34,276
You're a member of the high
court...

1623
01:33:34,363 --> 01:33:36,452
You don't dissociate yourself from
somebody that you're married to.

1624
01:33:36,539 --> 01:33:38,628
...by God, something happens.

1625
01:33:38,715 --> 01:33:41,501
In a moment, in the twinkling of
an eye,

1626
01:33:41,589 --> 01:33:42,590
"this corruption shall put on incorruption."

1627
01:33:43,809 --> 01:33:45,202
St. Paul vs. The Corinthians.

1628
01:33:46,203 --> 01:33:47,465
Et al.

1629
01:33:47,552 --> 01:33:48,685
Interesting case.

1630
01:33:52,079 --> 01:33:54,692
But what if an incorrupt person
finds out that she's corrupt?

1631
01:33:56,607 --> 01:33:57,695
That's applesauce and you know it.

1632
01:34:01,177 --> 01:34:03,005
I thought you'd be happy
to have me off the court.

1633
01:34:03,092 --> 01:34:04,573
That was before you were on the
court.

1634
01:34:13,453 --> 01:34:15,020
I never thought I'd ever kiss a
Supreme Court Justice.

1635
01:34:16,413 --> 01:34:18,634
You didn't kiss me.
I kissed you.

1636
01:34:21,985 --> 01:34:23,378
Make you a deal.

1637
01:34:23,465 --> 01:34:25,337
You don't resign, I don't die.

1638
01:34:27,513 --> 01:34:29,081
Let me think about that.

1639
01:34:38,570 --> 01:34:41,051
Don't we want the working
entrance?

1640
01:34:41,138 --> 01:34:42,357
Not this morning.
Right up the front steps.

1641
01:34:43,925 --> 01:34:46,841
Can't wait to get into
that conference room.

1642
01:34:46,928 --> 01:34:49,801
You really think we can go in there and I can
pick up where I left off?

1643
01:34:49,888 --> 01:34:51,934
Hell no.
Every day is different.

1644
01:34:52,021 --> 01:34:53,850
You're different.
I'm different.

1645
01:34:53,937 --> 01:34:56,113
Every morning,
a fresh beginning.
Fresh start.

1646
01:34:57,768 --> 01:34:59,726
First Monday in October.
Always.

1647
01:34:59,813 --> 01:35:00,945
CABBIE: Hey!

1648
01:35:01,554 --> 01:35:02,904
What about the meter?

1649
01:35:04,123 --> 01:35:05,994
I don't have any money.

1650
01:35:06,081 --> 01:35:07,475
You liberals never do.

1651
01:35:09,695 --> 01:35:10,565
4.25.

1652
01:35:12,437 --> 01:35:14,048
Here.
Keep the change.

1653
01:35:14,135 --> 01:35:15,136
Thanks, Your Honor.

1654
01:35:20,969 --> 01:35:23,712
You know what's on the calendar
right after Omnitech,don't
you?

1655
01:35:23,799 --> 01:35:27,194
First Atheist Church vs. The City of Waco, Texas.

1656
01:35:27,281 --> 01:35:28,630
You ain't going to miss
that one, are you?

1657
01:35:28,718 --> 01:35:30,850
Obviously, community standards
should prevail.

1658
01:35:30,937 --> 01:35:32,113
What about
religious freedom?

1659
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:33,462
Atheism is a religion?

1660
01:35:33,549 --> 01:35:35,726
God, yes.
Oh, Dan!

1661
01:35:35,813 --> 01:35:37,946
What about Cook County Diocese vs. John Doe?

1662
01:35:38,033 --> 01:35:39,339
What about Smith v. US?

1663
01:35:39,426 --> 01:35:40,862
M Miller vs. Moon.

1664
01:35:40,949 --> 01:35:42,299
Dalton v. Utah.

1665
01:35:42,386 --> 01:35:43,561
Oh, we're going to have a battle
on that one.

1666
01:35:43,648 --> 01:35:45,302
You can count on it.

1667
01:35:45,389 --> 01:35:47,001
You shouldn't be climbing
these steps! Why not?

1668
01:35:47,088 --> 01:35:48,480
This is my mountain,
our mountain.

1669
01:35:50,265 --> 01:35:52,137
You know something?

1670
01:35:52,224 --> 01:35:53,748
You and I make each other
possible.

1671
01:35:53,835 --> 01:35:54,792
Damn right, we do.
