1
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,649
Do you, Angela Nardino...

2
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,950
take Dean Cumanno as your
lawfully wedded husband...

3
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:59,949
to love, honor, and obey
till death do you part?

4
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,950
I do.

5
00:02:02,451 --> 00:02:07,451
Out of the tree of life,
I just picked me a plum

6
00:02:11,051 --> 00:02:15,951
You came along,
and everything started to hum

7
00:02:21,451 --> 00:02:23,250
You happy, Baby?

8
00:02:23,252 --> 00:02:26,151
I am so happy.
It's beautiful, Dean.

9
00:02:26,152 --> 00:02:27,751
It's everything
I ever wanted.

10
00:02:27,752 --> 00:02:29,252
Yeah?

11
00:02:29,352 --> 00:02:32,551
Like the song says,
"The best is yet to come."

12
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:35,551
The honeymoon.

13
00:02:35,552 --> 00:02:39,652
Oh, you got a little
bit of cake right...

14
00:02:45,053 --> 00:02:48,652
I think we've put in enough of
an appearance here, don't you?

15
00:02:48,653 --> 00:02:50,053
Come on, let's go.

16
00:02:51,153 --> 00:02:53,652
I believe it's tradition
for the best man to dance...

17
00:02:53,653 --> 00:02:54,952
with the beautiful bride.

18
00:02:54,953 --> 00:02:55,952
Piss off, Leo.

19
00:02:55,953 --> 00:02:58,953
Dean, you can't be
rude to your friends.

20
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,953
I'd love to dance with you.

21
00:03:03,453 --> 00:03:08,553
The best is yet to come,
come the day you're mine

22
00:03:10,054 --> 00:03:14,854
Come fly with me,
let's fly, let's fly away

23
00:03:16,954 --> 00:03:19,853
Just say the words,
and we'll beat the birds

24
00:03:19,854 --> 00:03:24,254
Down to Acapulco Bay

25
00:03:24,354 --> 00:03:29,354
It's perfect for
a flying honeymoon

26
00:03:29,455 --> 00:03:36,355
They say, come fly with me,
let's fly, let's fly away

27
00:03:36,455 --> 00:03:39,554
Congratulations, man.
She's great.

28
00:03:39,555 --> 00:03:40,954
I love your friends.

29
00:03:40,955 --> 00:03:43,455
That's the busboy, honey.

30
00:03:43,555 --> 00:03:44,954
Wow.

31
00:03:44,955 --> 00:03:47,854
You even got me great busboys.

32
00:03:47,856 --> 00:03:51,356
Now let's have one more
dance with the bride and groom.

33
00:03:51,456 --> 00:03:53,456
Oh! Ha, ha, ha!

34
00:03:56,756 --> 00:03:57,955
Are you still nervous?

35
00:03:57,956 --> 00:03:59,056
No.

36
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:02,955
And thank you for respecting
my religious beliefs.

37
00:04:02,956 --> 00:04:06,755
- I'm really ready now.
- Thank you, God!

38
00:04:06,756 --> 00:04:08,155
I'm ready to do things to you...

39
00:04:08,157 --> 00:04:11,156
that no woman has
ever done before.

40
00:04:11,157 --> 00:04:12,657
How about a...

41
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:52,158
Oh.

42
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,158
Here it is.

43
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,259
Oh, it's so...

44
00:04:55,359 --> 00:04:57,359
tasteful.

45
00:05:48,861 --> 00:05:49,860
Oh, my God.

46
00:05:49,861 --> 00:05:53,461
That's how much
I love you, baby.

47
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:55,662
You must love me...

48
00:05:55,762 --> 00:05:56,762
a lot.

49
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,162
Take me, Dean.

50
00:06:17,763 --> 00:06:19,162
Don't tease me.

51
00:06:19,163 --> 00:06:21,162
I'm not...

52
00:06:21,163 --> 00:06:27,263
Not a big fan
of this material.

53
00:06:27,363 --> 00:06:29,063
Oh.

54
00:07:08,565 --> 00:07:09,565
Angela?

55
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:13,764
Angela!

56
00:07:13,765 --> 00:07:15,664
Oh, no.

57
00:07:15,665 --> 00:07:17,465
Don't do this to me, Angela.

58
00:08:00,268 --> 00:08:01,668
Welcome back.

59
00:08:05,268 --> 00:08:07,167
Oh, my God.

60
00:08:07,168 --> 00:08:09,168
What happened?

61
00:08:09,268 --> 00:08:11,267
Not a whole hell of a lot.

62
00:08:11,268 --> 00:08:14,267
Oh, my God.
Are you kidding me?

63
00:08:14,268 --> 00:08:15,468
Our wedding night?

64
00:08:17,168 --> 00:08:19,167
Oh, I am a bad wife.

65
00:08:19,168 --> 00:08:20,168
No.

66
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:22,868
No, no, no.

67
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,869
I do got some frostbite
in some very weird places.

68
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:27,268
Oh--

69
00:08:27,269 --> 00:08:31,268
You've got your whole
life to make it up to me.

70
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:33,868
And I'm going
to start right now.

71
00:08:33,869 --> 00:08:35,769
Yeah? OK.

72
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:39,568
Oh!

73
00:08:39,569 --> 00:08:41,569
Ohhh!

74
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:44,270
Oh, my God,
I'm going to be sick.

75
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,669
Just give me a minute, baby.
I'll be right back.

76
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,669
No, no, no.
There's no rush.

77
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,669
No rush.

78
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,470
Look, I got to stop
by the office...

79
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,569
before we leave
for Barbados any way.

80
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:01,169
That'll give you some
time to freshen up.

81
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,969
Let me give you
a quick kiss good-bye.

82
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:05,070
No! No, no, no.
That's OK, that's OK.

83
00:09:05,071 --> 00:09:06,470
I--I'm late.

84
00:09:06,471 --> 00:09:09,171
I'll see you in
an hour, maybe two.

85
00:09:19,271 --> 00:09:22,071
Here. Put it
over here on the rack.

86
00:09:40,972 --> 00:09:42,571
Hey! What the--?

87
00:09:42,572 --> 00:09:45,072
- Nice security.
- Sorry, boss.

88
00:09:45,173 --> 00:09:48,172
I--I went to bed
late last night.

89
00:09:48,173 --> 00:09:50,072
But nothing
compared to you, huh?

90
00:09:50,073 --> 00:09:51,772
Yeah. Is the Mercedes ready?

91
00:09:51,773 --> 00:09:53,673
Yeah, yeah, just about.

92
00:09:53,773 --> 00:09:56,073
We switched the VIN,
and Wendy's making...

93
00:09:56,173 --> 00:09:57,872
the pink slip for
you to sign up there.

94
00:09:57,873 --> 00:09:58,872
All right.

95
00:09:58,873 --> 00:10:00,973
That's a great
wedding present, boss.

96
00:10:01,073 --> 00:10:03,872
Angela's going to go
nuts for it, huh?

97
00:10:03,873 --> 00:10:06,272
Maybe not as nuts as
she went last night, huh?

98
00:10:06,274 --> 00:10:07,273
Huh?

99
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,874
Hey, boss, was
she worth the wait?

100
00:10:08,974 --> 00:10:09,874
Come on--

101
00:10:09,974 --> 00:10:10,973
Hey, hey, hey!

102
00:10:10,974 --> 00:10:13,874
We're talking
about my wife here.

103
00:10:13,974 --> 00:10:17,574
A man's wedding night is his
own private, sacred business.

104
00:10:17,674 --> 00:10:20,674
It's not to entertain
lowlife scum like youse guys.

105
00:10:24,174 --> 00:10:26,674
Angela's got
to be an animal.

106
00:10:26,775 --> 00:10:28,575
Hey, he's even
walking funny, huh?

107
00:10:30,175 --> 00:10:31,374
Hey, back to work, all right.

108
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,875
The break is over,
guys, come on.

109
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,375
Oh! Congratulations, Mr. C.

110
00:10:48,476 --> 00:10:50,275
I heard the wedding
was awesome.

111
00:10:50,276 --> 00:10:52,775
I'm almost through with
the docs on the Mercedes.

112
00:10:52,776 --> 00:10:54,276
Oh, thanks, Wendy.

113
00:11:01,176 --> 00:11:02,876
Oh, boy.

114
00:11:02,976 --> 00:11:03,976
Oh, boy.

115
00:11:12,977 --> 00:11:16,377
You need to sign
here and I think...

116
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,277
here.

117
00:11:21,477 --> 00:11:23,777
Is it hard?

118
00:11:23,877 --> 00:11:24,876
What?

119
00:11:24,877 --> 00:11:25,976
Getting married.

120
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,376
I mean, I haven't
been here that long...

121
00:11:27,377 --> 00:11:28,577
but I've already
heard tons of stories...

122
00:11:28,677 --> 00:11:29,676
about you and women.

123
00:11:29,677 --> 00:11:30,676
Yeah, well.

124
00:11:30,678 --> 00:11:32,678
Those days are all over, Wendy.

125
00:11:34,178 --> 00:11:35,178
Forever.

126
00:11:36,578 --> 00:11:37,578
Thank you.

127
00:11:41,478 --> 00:11:42,478
Ah, damn it.

128
00:11:49,378 --> 00:11:51,178
Here. Let me help you.

129
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:03,678
Mr. Cumanno.

130
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:04,678
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry, Wendy.

131
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:08,479
I--I'm so sorry,
I'm just nuts today.

132
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,580
I can't,
I can't, I can't.

133
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,580
I'm married, Wendy...

134
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,580
I'm married.
I can't.

135
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,980
You're right.
I'm sorry.

136
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,980
I'm sorry.

137
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,180
Screw it.

138
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:37,179
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah. OK, OK.

139
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:38,180
Oh, my God.

140
00:12:38,181 --> 00:12:39,180
Thanks.

141
00:12:39,181 --> 00:12:40,180
Is that frostbite?

142
00:12:40,181 --> 00:12:42,180
I'm fine. It's fine.

143
00:12:42,181 --> 00:12:43,480
Piss off,
I'm working here.

144
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:44,881
Baby, it's me.

145
00:12:46,781 --> 00:12:48,781
Shit. Get out.
Take the back stairs.

146
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:50,381
I can't.
My hair is stuck.

147
00:12:50,481 --> 00:12:51,481
What?

148
00:12:52,681 --> 00:12:54,580
- Dean.
- Honey.

149
00:12:54,582 --> 00:12:58,281
Ahh, ha, hi.

150
00:12:58,282 --> 00:12:59,582
I was feeling
so much better...

151
00:12:59,682 --> 00:13:00,582
I couldn't
wait to pick up...

152
00:13:00,682 --> 00:13:02,081
where we left off.

153
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:03,082
Oh, that's great.
That's great.

154
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:04,082
You know what?

155
00:13:04,182 --> 00:13:05,681
I'm just going
to finish up here.

156
00:13:05,682 --> 00:13:07,882
I'll meet you outside
in a sex--a sec.

157
00:13:07,982 --> 00:13:09,382
OK.

158
00:13:09,482 --> 00:13:10,382
I love you.

159
00:13:10,482 --> 00:13:12,681
Oh.

160
00:13:12,682 --> 00:13:14,282
I love you, too.

161
00:13:16,383 --> 00:13:17,483
You look pretty.

162
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:21,983
Come on.

163
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,083
Come on. Ow.

164
00:13:23,183 --> 00:13:24,382
Get out.
Not so fast.

165
00:13:24,383 --> 00:13:25,383
You are not
welcome down there.

166
00:13:25,483 --> 00:13:26,482
Get up.
I'm trying.

167
00:13:26,483 --> 00:13:29,383
I can't
believe that Mercedes...

168
00:13:32,183 --> 00:13:33,782
Dean.

169
00:13:33,783 --> 00:13:35,382
Honey, honey, this
isn't what it looks like.

170
00:13:35,383 --> 00:13:37,483
I--I swear her hair
got stuck in my zipper.

171
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:39,384
I--I--I wasn't getting nothing.

172
00:13:39,484 --> 00:13:42,484
17 hours we have
been married.

173
00:13:42,584 --> 00:13:44,384
17 hours!

174
00:13:44,484 --> 00:13:46,483
The happiest
17 hours of my life.

175
00:13:46,484 --> 00:13:49,784
You just lost the best
thing you'd ever had.

176
00:13:51,984 --> 00:13:53,384
Angela, wait.

177
00:13:56,484 --> 00:13:58,283
She seems...

178
00:13:58,285 --> 00:13:59,285
nice.

179
00:14:00,085 --> 00:14:03,085
My client has agreed,
against my advice...

180
00:14:03,185 --> 00:14:06,685
to settle for
a one-time cash payment.

181
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:13,784
$300, 000.

182
00:14:13,785 --> 00:14:15,584
For one day?

183
00:14:15,585 --> 00:14:19,484
One horribly traumatic day
in which my client suffered...

184
00:14:19,486 --> 00:14:23,086
irreparable psychological
damage to her self-esteem.

185
00:14:23,186 --> 00:14:25,586
Oh, and she keeps
the Mercedes.

186
00:14:25,686 --> 00:14:27,085
What?

187
00:14:27,086 --> 00:14:29,485
Bullshit.

188
00:14:29,486 --> 00:14:31,486
Well, we could drag this
before a judge...

189
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:34,485
if you think that
would be more favorable.

190
00:14:34,486 --> 00:14:38,186
That would put your client's
business under scrutiny.

191
00:14:38,286 --> 00:14:40,185
What was it again, Mr. Cumanno?

192
00:14:40,187 --> 00:14:42,087
Random repossessions?

193
00:14:46,087 --> 00:14:47,787
Give her what she wants.

194
00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:38,788
I can't believe you
wore the gray dress.

195
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:40,389
I distinctly said the blue.

196
00:15:40,489 --> 00:15:43,089
- It worked, didn't it?
- You were lucky.

197
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,990
I was good.

198
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,490
Excuse me.

199
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,689
I wonder if I could ask
your help for a moment.

200
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:05,690
I'm trying to find Route 40.

201
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,691
Route 40?
Well, you're on it.

202
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,090
That's it.

203
00:16:09,091 --> 00:16:10,191
What?
Where is it?

204
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:11,590
There. See that black thing...

205
00:16:11,591 --> 00:16:13,190
with the lines on it,
the cars going?

206
00:16:13,191 --> 00:16:14,390
I'm so embarrassed.

207
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:15,591
I'm so sorry.

208
00:16:15,691 --> 00:16:17,391
I didn't know
where it was.

209
00:16:17,491 --> 00:16:18,391
Thank you so much.

210
00:16:18,491 --> 00:16:19,391
My pleasure.

211
00:16:19,491 --> 00:16:20,391
Sorry to trouble you.

212
00:16:20,491 --> 00:16:21,491
It's OK.

213
00:16:26,492 --> 00:16:27,491
Forget it.

214
00:16:27,492 --> 00:16:28,591
You're not going
to kill yourself...

215
00:16:28,592 --> 00:16:30,591
and stink up my new car.

216
00:16:30,592 --> 00:16:31,792
Our new car.

217
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,091
Hey! Mom.

218
00:16:35,092 --> 00:16:37,692
I only do these things
because I love you, Page.

219
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,591
How was the wedding?

220
00:16:42,592 --> 00:16:43,892
Beautiful.

221
00:16:43,992 --> 00:16:45,692
Like all my weddings.

222
00:16:55,193 --> 00:16:56,693
Have you any idea
what that meat...

223
00:16:56,793 --> 00:16:58,293
is doing to your arteries?

224
00:16:58,393 --> 00:16:59,792
Haven't you heard?

225
00:16:59,793 --> 00:17:01,693
Cigarettes
dissolve cholesterol.

226
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:08,292
No cards, Page.

227
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:09,793
This is a classy place.

228
00:17:09,794 --> 00:17:11,094
It relaxes me.

229
00:17:13,394 --> 00:17:16,293
So? How did we do?

230
00:17:16,294 --> 00:17:17,993
Not too bad.

231
00:17:17,994 --> 00:17:19,994
How not too bad?

232
00:17:20,094 --> 00:17:21,494
About 80.

233
00:17:21,594 --> 00:17:22,594
Plus the car.

234
00:17:24,594 --> 00:17:26,093
That's it?

235
00:17:26,094 --> 00:17:29,693
For that I lived 4 months in
a crap hotel without cable?

236
00:17:29,695 --> 00:17:32,295
Ugh, I'm so sick of this
small-time bullshit.

237
00:17:32,395 --> 00:17:34,394
Plus, I had to kiss
that greasy mook.

238
00:17:34,395 --> 00:17:35,894
Dean wasn't so bad.

239
00:17:35,895 --> 00:17:38,295
Any way, we'll make more
in the next one.

240
00:17:38,395 --> 00:17:40,694
I'm thinking Seattle.

241
00:17:40,695 --> 00:17:41,894
Maybe San Francisco.

242
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,995
Mom, remember our deal?

243
00:17:44,095 --> 00:17:45,095
OK, there is no next one.

244
00:17:45,195 --> 00:17:46,295
This is it.
I'm going solo.

245
00:17:46,395 --> 00:17:47,395
Oh, here we go--

246
00:17:47,495 --> 00:17:49,894
It's happening, Mom.
Accept it, embrace it, OK?

247
00:17:49,896 --> 00:17:51,596
I am old enough
to be on my own.

248
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:54,295
You have no idea what it's like
to be all alone.

249
00:17:54,296 --> 00:17:56,295
I'll tell you exactly
what's going to happen.

250
00:17:56,296 --> 00:17:58,396
You'll go off,
you'll get lonely.

251
00:17:58,496 --> 00:18:01,295
Some moron hunk will come along,
you'll think it's true love.

252
00:18:01,296 --> 00:18:03,995
You'd never been so sure
of anything in your life.

253
00:18:03,996 --> 00:18:04,995
And then, bam.

254
00:18:04,996 --> 00:18:06,496
He will pull a
conceive and leave...

255
00:18:06,596 --> 00:18:08,496
and then it's my
life all over again.

256
00:18:08,596 --> 00:18:10,396
Mom, I am not that stupid.

257
00:18:14,597 --> 00:18:16,096
You know what I mean.

258
00:18:16,097 --> 00:18:18,496
Well, you're right.
I was stupid.

259
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,596
And it left me
pregnant and alone.

260
00:18:20,597 --> 00:18:22,696
If Barbara hadn't taken me in
and shown me the con--

261
00:18:22,697 --> 00:18:24,096
And you taught me.

262
00:18:24,097 --> 00:18:25,597
OK? I'll be fine.

263
00:18:27,497 --> 00:18:29,797
OK. Fine.

264
00:18:29,897 --> 00:18:30,796
If you've made up your mind...

265
00:18:30,797 --> 00:18:34,696
we will go to New York
and divide up everything.

266
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:35,898
I'll get the check.

267
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:48,897
Oh, my Lord!

268
00:18:48,898 --> 00:18:50,898
Eww.

269
00:18:50,998 --> 00:18:52,297
What seems to be
the problem, madam?

270
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,297
Well, I was just about
to take a bite...

271
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,898
and I saw glass. Look.

272
00:18:56,899 --> 00:19:00,599
I am so sorry, ma'am.
This has never happened.

273
00:19:00,699 --> 00:19:03,999
Of course your meal
is, uh, complimentary.

274
00:19:04,099 --> 00:19:06,398
Armando, a bottle
of wine, quickly.

275
00:19:06,399 --> 00:19:08,799
Perhaps a '69 Merlot.

276
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,399
Those shoes
are so wrong for this.

277
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,199
Thanks.

278
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,400
I don't understand
the problem, Philip.

279
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,799
We deposit our money...

280
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,000
and you give it back
when we say so.

281
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,200
I'm afraid it's not that
simple, Ms. Conners.

282
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:39,000
Hello.
I'm Gloria Vogal.

283
00:19:39,001 --> 00:19:40,201
I.R.S.

284
00:19:43,201 --> 00:19:44,200
Hello.

285
00:19:44,201 --> 00:19:46,201
Oh, I see you've
heard of us.

286
00:19:46,301 --> 00:19:49,501
I'm surprised because
we so seldom hear from you.

287
00:19:49,601 --> 00:19:52,300
Well, I suppose
I might be a little late...

288
00:19:52,301 --> 00:19:53,701
with this year's return.

289
00:19:53,801 --> 00:19:55,701
Maybe even the last 7.

290
00:19:55,802 --> 00:19:58,701
Mother, I'm stunned.

291
00:19:58,702 --> 00:20:01,401
I had no idea you would
evade your responsibilities...

292
00:20:01,402 --> 00:20:02,401
as a U.S. Citizen.

293
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:04,301
Shut up, Miss Conners.

294
00:20:04,302 --> 00:20:06,902
We've never seen
a dime from you, either.

295
00:20:07,002 --> 00:20:09,302
Look, I know
what must have happened.

296
00:20:09,402 --> 00:20:11,901
You see, I always
assumed that my returns...

297
00:20:11,902 --> 00:20:14,101
were filed by my husband.

298
00:20:14,102 --> 00:20:15,601
Oh...

299
00:20:15,602 --> 00:20:17,201
which one?

300
00:20:17,203 --> 00:20:19,402
Look, just because
I've had some trouble...

301
00:20:19,403 --> 00:20:20,702
with my personal
relationships--

302
00:20:20,703 --> 00:20:21,702
Ms. Conners...

303
00:20:21,703 --> 00:20:25,202
how you earn your money is
of no interest to the I.R.S.

304
00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:29,003
Now, how can I put this in
language you'll understand?

305
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:31,103
We just want our cut.

306
00:20:31,203 --> 00:20:33,202
How much?

307
00:20:33,203 --> 00:20:39,202
With interest and penalties,
the total comes to $247, 811.

308
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:40,204
What?

309
00:20:45,604 --> 00:20:49,203
Oh, no, no,
no, no, no.

310
00:20:49,204 --> 00:20:51,704
Ha ha! I'm afraid
that amount is in addition...

311
00:20:51,804 --> 00:20:54,004
to what used to be
in your accounts.

312
00:20:54,104 --> 00:20:57,103
Your latest divorce settlement
arrived this morning.

313
00:20:57,104 --> 00:20:59,204
Thanks.

314
00:20:59,305 --> 00:21:01,205
But that's everything.

315
00:21:01,305 --> 00:21:02,605
It's not all bad.

316
00:21:02,705 --> 00:21:05,505
We give you a full
90 days to pay.

317
00:21:05,605 --> 00:21:06,605
Or...

318
00:21:09,305 --> 00:21:11,205
we move for ward
with criminal charges...

319
00:21:11,305 --> 00:21:13,705
for felony tax
evasion and fraud.

320
00:21:17,505 --> 00:21:19,005
Good luck.

321
00:21:23,506 --> 00:21:25,205
Here's the last of our cash.

322
00:21:25,206 --> 00:21:28,206
1, 150...

323
00:21:28,306 --> 00:21:31,005
1, 170...

324
00:21:31,006 --> 00:21:33,405
1, 190.

325
00:21:33,406 --> 00:21:36,405
That's $1, 300 each.

326
00:21:36,406 --> 00:21:40,005
Wow. Have a nice life
with that, Princess.

327
00:21:40,006 --> 00:21:42,006
- I'll economize.
- Sure.

328
00:21:42,107 --> 00:21:44,907
You can do your own hair,
your own nails.

329
00:21:45,007 --> 00:21:48,007
They actually have some
great shoes at Wal-Mart.

330
00:21:49,407 --> 00:21:51,607
Ugh! All right.

331
00:21:51,707 --> 00:21:55,706
One more con,
but only if we do it right.

332
00:21:55,707 --> 00:21:56,706
What does that mean?

333
00:21:56,707 --> 00:21:58,906
It means no more
small-time crap.

334
00:21:58,907 --> 00:21:59,807
It has to be big.

335
00:21:59,907 --> 00:22:02,106
One big final score
to pay off the I.R.S...

336
00:22:02,108 --> 00:22:03,707
and set me up on my own.

337
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:06,807
What are you talking about?

338
00:22:06,808 --> 00:22:08,507
Palm Beach.

339
00:22:08,508 --> 00:22:10,108
Palm Beach?

340
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:11,307
Forget it.

341
00:22:11,308 --> 00:22:13,008
People that rich are
already suspicious.

342
00:22:13,108 --> 00:22:14,507
It's too hard to play.

343
00:22:14,508 --> 00:22:17,108
Palm Beach or nothing.

344
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,509
Too expensive.

345
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,009
Let's find something else.

346
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,910
I am home.

347
00:23:12,011 --> 00:23:14,810
Now, what's the best way
to get a room?

348
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:17,011
I was thinking
the Trogdon Triangle.

349
00:23:18,211 --> 00:23:20,310
Right. But where are
we going to find...

350
00:23:20,311 --> 00:23:22,411
a trumpet and a talking parrot?

351
00:23:22,511 --> 00:23:25,910
I was thinking of
something simple, traditional.

352
00:23:25,911 --> 00:23:28,011
The Flopper Diver.

353
00:23:28,112 --> 00:23:29,412
No way am I--

354
00:23:29,512 --> 00:23:30,712
Oh!

355
00:23:30,812 --> 00:23:31,911
Oh, my God.

356
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:34,212
She's cracked
her head open.

357
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:36,311
Oh, darling!
Oh, careful!

358
00:23:36,312 --> 00:23:38,811
You may be paralyzed.

359
00:23:38,812 --> 00:23:40,811
Call a doctor.

360
00:23:40,812 --> 00:23:43,011
But I'm--I'm sure
she'll be fine.

361
00:23:43,012 --> 00:23:44,012
I think I'm--

362
00:23:57,413 --> 00:24:02,613
Just please let me know if
there's anything else we can do.

363
00:24:02,713 --> 00:24:05,412
Well, you might consider
investing in a mop.

364
00:24:05,413 --> 00:24:08,212
Once again, I apologize.
Now, since we seem...

365
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:10,612
to have lost your reservation...

366
00:24:10,614 --> 00:24:12,813
we can only let you have
this suite for one night.

367
00:24:12,814 --> 00:24:14,014
Aah!

368
00:24:16,114 --> 00:24:19,014
Uh, then I'm sure we
can work something out.

369
00:24:19,114 --> 00:24:21,613
Could everyone please
just let her rest now?

370
00:24:21,614 --> 00:24:22,914
Yeah. Hey!

371
00:24:32,915 --> 00:24:36,415
Don't you ever flop me
without my consent.

372
00:24:36,515 --> 00:24:38,614
Oh! It had to look
real, Sweetheart.

373
00:24:38,615 --> 00:24:40,315
You fall lousy when
you know it's coming.

374
00:24:40,415 --> 00:24:42,814
I fall fine!

375
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,214
Fake.

376
00:24:44,215 --> 00:24:45,314
Oh, shut up!

377
00:24:45,315 --> 00:24:47,615
Hey! Oh, no!

378
00:24:47,715 --> 00:24:48,715
Cheat!

379
00:24:48,815 --> 00:24:51,115
No, stop!

380
00:24:51,216 --> 00:24:55,116
Hey, boss, just got
3 Camrys in--cherry.

381
00:24:55,216 --> 00:24:57,316
Parts will bring
100 thou easy.

382
00:24:57,416 --> 00:24:58,515
Great.

383
00:24:58,516 --> 00:25:00,315
And the change of
title came through...

384
00:25:00,316 --> 00:25:02,616
on the Mercedes.
You have to sign.

385
00:25:06,716 --> 00:25:08,816
That bitch.

386
00:25:10,216 --> 00:25:13,916
You know, this is,
like, the eighth frame...

387
00:25:14,017 --> 00:25:16,916
we've gone through
in a week.

388
00:25:16,917 --> 00:25:19,216
Maybe it's time
to retire this picture.

389
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:22,116
Why the hell can't I stop
thinking about her?

390
00:25:22,117 --> 00:25:24,216
Was it the legs?

391
00:25:24,217 --> 00:25:25,817
She had amazing legs.

392
00:25:25,917 --> 00:25:27,217
Give me that!

393
00:25:30,017 --> 00:25:32,916
Or maybe it was
that she dumped you...

394
00:25:32,918 --> 00:25:35,118
'cause that's never
happened before.

395
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:39,917
Yeah...yeah.

396
00:25:39,918 --> 00:25:42,217
Who the hell does
she think she is?

397
00:25:42,218 --> 00:25:44,617
She thinks she can do this
to me and just walk out?

398
00:25:44,618 --> 00:25:46,218
Well, she's wrong!

399
00:25:46,318 --> 00:25:47,618
I'm gonna find her.

400
00:25:48,818 --> 00:25:50,218
And then?

401
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:55,518
Then I'm gonna take care of it.

402
00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:08,819
Dr. Arnold Davis.

403
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:11,218
Made huge money
when an old uncle died...

404
00:26:11,219 --> 00:26:12,819
45, pretty good shape.

405
00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:16,219
Who's the old bag?

406
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,120
His mom.
She lives with him.

407
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:22,420
Forget it. He's taken.
Mama's boy.

408
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,020
We can get around her.

409
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,719
Pass. Mothers are death.

410
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,120
Can't argue that.

411
00:26:52,921 --> 00:26:55,021
David D. Cummings...

412
00:26:55,121 --> 00:26:58,521
760 million.
E-commerce stuff...

413
00:26:58,622 --> 00:27:01,321
just ended
marriage number 3.

414
00:27:01,322 --> 00:27:02,821
Downside?

415
00:27:02,822 --> 00:27:05,221
Very big on ironclad prenups...

416
00:27:05,222 --> 00:27:08,521
and as you can see,
massive competition.

417
00:27:08,522 --> 00:27:10,522
We could handle him.

418
00:27:10,622 --> 00:27:13,621
We'd have to be into
a group kind of thing.

419
00:27:13,622 --> 00:27:14,822
Menage a trois?

420
00:27:16,322 --> 00:27:18,322
Try menage a cinq.

421
00:27:19,423 --> 00:27:22,023
Ew. Pass.

422
00:27:34,523 --> 00:27:37,423
Wow. William B. Tensy.

423
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:38,723
C.E.O. of Tensy Tobacco.

424
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:41,523
Old money, but also
just plain old.

425
00:27:49,924 --> 00:27:51,223
How much?

426
00:27:51,224 --> 00:27:53,623
3 billion with a few
million more every day.

427
00:27:53,624 --> 00:27:54,724
Hmm...

428
00:27:54,824 --> 00:27:57,423
Not "hmm." I am not
dating the walking dead.

429
00:27:57,424 --> 00:27:58,823
Page, the older the better.

430
00:27:58,824 --> 00:28:00,423
With luck they die
right after the wedding...

431
00:28:00,425 --> 00:28:02,125
and then you're
talking widow money.

432
00:28:06,025 --> 00:28:07,924
I'd have to kiss that?

433
00:28:07,925 --> 00:28:10,124
Well, I'd have to kiss
that way more than you.

434
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:12,325
Well, maybe you're
into necrophilia.

435
00:28:16,525 --> 00:28:18,325
We'd better work fast.

436
00:28:23,126 --> 00:28:24,825
Why for once can't
we pick someone...

437
00:28:24,826 --> 00:28:26,625
who's just a little bit cute?

438
00:28:26,626 --> 00:28:28,026
Dean was kind of cute.

439
00:28:29,026 --> 00:28:31,326
You're in serious denial.

440
00:28:31,426 --> 00:28:32,726
Cute is dangerous.

441
00:28:32,826 --> 00:28:35,126
Cute leads to feeling,
which leads to screwing...

442
00:28:35,226 --> 00:28:36,526
which leads to screwed.

443
00:28:36,626 --> 00:28:39,825
I know that we can make that
doctor and his mom work for us.

444
00:28:39,826 --> 00:28:41,626
Page, we're going with
Tensy, and that's that.

445
00:28:41,726 --> 00:28:43,625
That is not that.

446
00:28:43,627 --> 00:28:45,927
Look, if you want to go
with Tensy, go with Tensy.

447
00:28:46,027 --> 00:28:47,327
I'm working Davis.

448
00:28:47,427 --> 00:28:50,826
Page, I've told you before,
no simultaneous cons.

449
00:28:50,827 --> 00:28:53,326
Too many angles.
They always go bad.

450
00:28:53,327 --> 00:28:55,626
Yeah, but it's not
just that, is it?

451
00:28:55,627 --> 00:28:56,726
What?

452
00:28:56,727 --> 00:28:59,626
You don't think I can be
the primary, do you?

453
00:28:59,627 --> 00:29:01,527
I didn't say that.

454
00:29:01,627 --> 00:29:04,427
Although it does take
an enormous amount of skill.

455
00:29:04,528 --> 00:29:08,328
I can make men do anything.

456
00:29:08,428 --> 00:29:11,128
Boys. You can make
boys do anything.

457
00:29:11,228 --> 00:29:13,128
Gas station attendants,
bartenders...

458
00:29:13,228 --> 00:29:14,727
the occasional migrant worker...

459
00:29:14,728 --> 00:29:17,428
a one-shot seduction
is child's play...

460
00:29:17,528 --> 00:29:20,428
compared to getting someone
to marry you in 3 months.

461
00:29:20,528 --> 00:29:21,927
4 months.

462
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:23,128
What?

463
00:29:24,428 --> 00:29:27,528
Well, it took you
4 months this time.

464
00:29:27,629 --> 00:29:29,828
You used to be
able to do it in 3.

465
00:29:29,829 --> 00:29:31,228
What are you saying?

466
00:29:31,229 --> 00:29:34,229
That I'm losing it?
I'm getting too old?

467
00:29:34,329 --> 00:29:35,329
I didn't say that.

468
00:29:35,429 --> 00:29:38,629
I'm in terrific shape.
Feel my butt.

469
00:29:38,729 --> 00:29:41,328
Ugh. I am not feeling
your butt again, Mother.

470
00:29:41,329 --> 00:29:43,129
We all know it's wonderful.

471
00:29:44,529 --> 00:29:47,828
I'll tell you what.
We'll play for it.

472
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,129
Winner picks the mark.

473
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,429
Great.

474
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,829
We'll cut cards.

475
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:54,329
Right. I'm gonna
trust your cards?

476
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:56,230
See that guy
over there at the bar?

477
00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:00,130
First one to get him
to buy her a drinkwins.

478
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:02,330
Deal.

479
00:30:12,431 --> 00:30:14,530
Hi.

480
00:30:14,531 --> 00:30:15,831
Hot.

481
00:30:15,931 --> 00:30:18,531
Yeah, sure is.

482
00:30:18,631 --> 00:30:20,131
Oh!

483
00:30:28,732 --> 00:30:30,632
Let me get that for you.

484
00:30:32,932 --> 00:30:34,232
Oh, my!

485
00:30:36,132 --> 00:30:37,332
Would you?

486
00:30:37,432 --> 00:30:38,732
Sure.

487
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,432
Oh, you're so kind.

488
00:30:45,632 --> 00:30:46,632
I'm Betty.

489
00:30:47,432 --> 00:30:49,431
- Hi. My name--
- Excuse me...

490
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:51,833
may I grab your nuts?

491
00:30:55,733 --> 00:30:57,432
Mmm.

492
00:30:57,433 --> 00:30:58,833
Salty.

493
00:31:02,633 --> 00:31:04,033
Are you OK?

494
00:31:04,133 --> 00:31:05,132
Can I get you a drink?

495
00:31:05,133 --> 00:31:06,233
We go with Tensy.

496
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:07,633
Stupid jerk!

497
00:31:35,635 --> 00:31:38,635
He doesn't look so bad--
in this light.

498
00:31:38,735 --> 00:31:41,934
Yeah, his liver spots
are positively glowing.

499
00:31:41,935 --> 00:31:43,634
All right, let's run
through it one more time.

500
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:45,335
I know what to do.

501
00:32:00,436 --> 00:32:01,435
Got a light?

502
00:32:01,436 --> 00:32:02,636
Yeah.

503
00:32:14,237 --> 00:32:15,837
Your trash is on fire.

504
00:32:17,037 --> 00:32:18,337
Holy shit!

505
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:54,237
Set.

506
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:55,638
Good. Now stay by the phone.

507
00:32:55,739 --> 00:32:57,038
Timing on this is crucial.

508
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,638
Duh!

509
00:32:58,639 --> 00:33:00,538
Always treating me like a child.

510
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:01,739
Child!

511
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,240
Excuse me, sir,
but smoking is not permitted.

512
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:39,140
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

513
00:33:42,041 --> 00:33:43,241
Nazi.

514
00:34:07,742 --> 00:34:10,141
Oh!

515
00:34:10,142 --> 00:34:12,141
Pardon me.

516
00:34:12,142 --> 00:34:13,342
Is no crime.

517
00:34:47,044 --> 00:34:50,744
OK, Dr. Davis, let's see
where you're going tonight.

518
00:34:57,344 --> 00:34:58,744
Good start, Page.

519
00:35:07,445 --> 00:35:08,645
Crap!

520
00:35:20,245 --> 00:35:21,444
Davis residence.

521
00:35:21,445 --> 00:35:23,044
Yeah, Arnold Davis, please.

522
00:35:23,046 --> 00:35:24,945
I'm sorry, he's just left.

523
00:35:24,946 --> 00:35:27,745
Oh, no. This is--

524
00:35:27,746 --> 00:35:29,245
He left me a message.

525
00:35:29,246 --> 00:35:32,145
I'm supposed
to meet him tonight--

526
00:35:32,146 --> 00:35:34,345
I can't read
my maid's handwriting--

527
00:35:34,346 --> 00:35:35,346
Who is this?

528
00:35:35,446 --> 00:35:36,446
This is--

529
00:35:37,646 --> 00:35:38,646
Stupid cell phone.

530
00:35:39,646 --> 00:35:40,846
Mrs. Whiler?

531
00:35:40,946 --> 00:35:43,446
Right. Right.
This is Mrs. Whiler.

532
00:35:43,546 --> 00:35:47,346
I believe he said the Glades.

533
00:35:47,447 --> 00:35:48,647
Right. And that's on?

534
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:51,346
I think it's on
the far end of Ocean.

535
00:35:51,347 --> 00:35:53,047
Great. Cutting out. Thank--

536
00:36:35,149 --> 00:36:37,348
Hi. Can I get you a drink?

537
00:36:37,349 --> 00:36:40,348
Wow. I've never heard
that one before.

538
00:36:40,349 --> 00:36:42,848
You really blow me away
with your creativity.

539
00:36:42,849 --> 00:36:45,548
- Well, I--
- Well, I...

540
00:36:45,549 --> 00:36:47,049
Your recovery is even better.

541
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:50,550
Do you even care
at all who I am?

542
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:52,949
I mean, I could be
the Antichrist or have...

543
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:54,849
the intelligence of a thermos,
but unfortunately...

544
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:57,150
those are not the matters
the male penis ponders.

545
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,950
So, please, tell me...

546
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:02,650
why did you walk
all the way over here...

547
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,850
to ask to get me a drink?

548
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,450
Well, because I'm the bartender.

549
00:37:11,151 --> 00:37:12,251
Oh.

550
00:37:13,951 --> 00:37:15,550
Martini, very dry.

551
00:37:15,551 --> 00:37:16,851
Sure.

552
00:37:19,651 --> 00:37:21,550
Our next item is
an exquisite piece...

553
00:37:21,551 --> 00:37:22,851
from the Kerner estate...

554
00:37:22,951 --> 00:37:26,151
a stunning work
by Feodor Tergeniev...

555
00:37:26,251 --> 00:37:29,651
entitled Form in Repose.

556
00:37:31,252 --> 00:37:34,851
I'm looking for
an opening bid of 130, 000.

557
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:36,151
130.

558
00:37:36,152 --> 00:37:38,452
Very good. I have 130.
Do I hear 140?

559
00:37:38,552 --> 00:37:39,952
140.

560
00:37:40,052 --> 00:37:42,351
Thank you.
Do I hear 150?

561
00:37:42,352 --> 00:37:44,352
150, 000.

562
00:37:47,152 --> 00:37:49,051
160.

563
00:37:49,052 --> 00:37:51,052
I am offer 170.

564
00:37:52,453 --> 00:37:54,753
175.

565
00:37:54,853 --> 00:37:56,653
Was that 175, sir?

566
00:37:59,353 --> 00:38:01,753
I'll take that.
175, 000.

567
00:38:03,953 --> 00:38:05,452
180.

568
00:38:05,453 --> 00:38:08,753
I have 180.
Do I hear 190?

569
00:38:13,154 --> 00:38:14,654
Do I hear 190?

570
00:38:14,754 --> 00:38:18,754
I really must hear a number
or see a paddle, sir.

571
00:38:18,854 --> 00:38:20,053
I think he--

572
00:38:20,054 --> 00:38:21,553
Yes, ma'am,
I have your bid.

573
00:38:21,554 --> 00:38:24,053
It's to you
at $180, 000.

574
00:38:24,054 --> 00:38:25,454
Going once...

575
00:38:25,554 --> 00:38:27,054
twice...

576
00:38:27,154 --> 00:38:28,853
sold--

577
00:38:28,854 --> 00:38:31,454
to the persistent
woman on my right.

578
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:38,155
Thanks.
You did good.

579
00:38:38,255 --> 00:38:39,755
Bye.

580
00:38:39,855 --> 00:38:41,855
Uh, that's $3.50.

581
00:38:41,955 --> 00:38:44,255
I'll flip you for it.
Call it.

582
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:47,055
- No, we don't really--
- Call it!

583
00:38:48,655 --> 00:38:50,055
Tails.

584
00:38:51,655 --> 00:38:55,755
Heads. Oh, too bad.
Thanks.

585
00:39:03,356 --> 00:39:05,056
Well, Jack, looks like
she got a free drink...

586
00:39:05,156 --> 00:39:06,956
and one of your balls.

587
00:39:07,056 --> 00:39:09,356
Nah, I just think she's
nervous being on her own.

588
00:39:14,156 --> 00:39:16,356
Oh, yeah.
She's a delicate flower.

589
00:39:42,158 --> 00:39:46,558
Oh, wait!
I think I see crack.

590
00:39:46,658 --> 00:39:50,158
- That's just his butt, lady.
- Let me see.

591
00:39:51,758 --> 00:39:53,058
Hmm.

592
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:56,658
Hmm. Oh.

593
00:39:58,559 --> 00:39:59,559
Oh.

594
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:02,759
Oh.

595
00:40:04,059 --> 00:40:06,059
Ooh.

596
00:40:09,659 --> 00:40:11,259
Looks good.

597
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:12,759
From where I'm standing...

598
00:40:12,859 --> 00:40:13,859
hmm.

599
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,460
Oh!

600
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,060
Oh, my God!

601
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:40,060
Oh!

602
00:40:40,061 --> 00:40:41,560
What, what?
What is the matter?

603
00:40:41,561 --> 00:40:44,960
My--my beautiful man.
He ruined.

604
00:40:44,961 --> 00:40:46,061
Ruined!

605
00:40:46,161 --> 00:40:48,560
I'm sure we can have
this expertly repaired.

606
00:40:48,561 --> 00:40:51,560
No. Man thing off,
deal off.

607
00:40:51,561 --> 00:40:55,961
What good is to me now?
He has no "pipiska."

608
00:41:41,063 --> 00:41:43,862
Mother, did you have any
trouble finding the place?

609
00:41:43,864 --> 00:41:45,164
This is beyond civilization.

610
00:41:45,264 --> 00:41:46,564
It was impossible
to find.

611
00:41:46,664 --> 00:41:48,164
Son of a bitch!

612
00:42:01,764 --> 00:42:03,164
Ow!

613
00:42:03,265 --> 00:42:04,964
Ow! Ow!

614
00:42:04,965 --> 00:42:06,564
Oh!

615
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,264
I'm so sorry.

616
00:42:08,265 --> 00:42:09,765
Get away from him!
Get away!

617
00:42:09,865 --> 00:42:13,664
I told you it was dangerous to
come to these low-class bars.

618
00:42:13,665 --> 00:42:16,064
It stings, Mama.
It stings so bad.

619
00:42:16,065 --> 00:42:17,464
Oh, mother will help you.

620
00:42:17,465 --> 00:42:19,165
The retina is detached.

621
00:42:19,265 --> 00:42:21,564
I know it! Ow!

622
00:42:21,565 --> 00:42:23,564
Are you OK now?

623
00:42:23,565 --> 00:42:25,565
Yes. You idi--

624
00:42:27,066 --> 00:42:28,066
"Idi" what?

625
00:42:32,566 --> 00:42:33,565
Yeah.

626
00:42:33,566 --> 00:42:35,065
Subject is en route.

627
00:42:35,066 --> 00:42:36,566
He'll pass the checkpoint
in 10 minutes.

628
00:42:36,666 --> 00:42:38,065
Everything set?

629
00:42:38,066 --> 00:42:39,065
Yeah. Of course.

630
00:42:39,066 --> 00:42:41,065
What's wrong, Page?

631
00:42:41,066 --> 00:42:42,466
Mother can tell
something's wrong.

632
00:42:42,566 --> 00:42:44,366
Mother knows nothing.

633
00:42:44,466 --> 00:42:45,766
I'm following
right behind him...

634
00:42:45,867 --> 00:42:47,967
so be sure
to remove the spikes.

635
00:42:48,067 --> 00:42:49,366
And he mustn't see you.

636
00:42:49,367 --> 00:42:51,267
He must think no one else
is around so we can bond.

637
00:42:51,367 --> 00:42:53,666
I know, I know.
You're driving me crazy.

638
00:42:53,667 --> 00:42:55,367
Well, you're driving me crazy.

639
00:42:55,467 --> 00:42:58,166
Well, that answers
the question of whether...

640
00:42:58,167 --> 00:42:59,867
you're already
in a relationship.

641
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:03,267
Since you can't seem
to read my subtle signals...

642
00:43:03,367 --> 00:43:05,967
I'll help you out.
Piss off!

643
00:43:10,968 --> 00:43:12,968
Everyone is a little
irritable after they choke.

644
00:43:36,869 --> 00:43:39,369
Two headlights.
That's not him. Crap.

645
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:53,370
That was wrong
on so many levels.

646
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:05,070
- You!
- What happened?

647
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:06,670
What are you doing here?

648
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:09,169
- I followed you.
- More like stalked me.

649
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:11,469
Listen, mouth breather,
I am fully capable...

650
00:44:11,471 --> 00:44:13,271
and really in the mood
to kick the shit out of...

651
00:44:13,371 --> 00:44:15,671
your psychotic, skulking ass.

652
00:44:19,971 --> 00:44:21,771
Does this look familiar?

653
00:44:23,771 --> 00:44:24,871
Might be mine.

654
00:44:24,971 --> 00:44:27,270
Well, if you're not sure...

655
00:44:27,271 --> 00:44:29,170
Thanks! Now go.

656
00:44:29,171 --> 00:44:32,070
Look, my car doesn't drive
so good with a tree in it.

657
00:44:32,072 --> 00:44:34,372
What a baby!
It's a flat. I'll fix it.

658
00:44:34,472 --> 00:44:37,071
Wait, first we better go clear
that stuff out of the road.

659
00:44:37,072 --> 00:44:38,072
Another car could--

660
00:44:38,172 --> 00:44:39,972
No! I'll do it.
Just get the spare.

661
00:44:40,072 --> 00:44:40,972
Now!

662
00:44:41,072 --> 00:44:42,871
Look, I'm willing to explore...

663
00:44:42,872 --> 00:44:44,771
the whole being
dominated thing, OK?

664
00:44:44,772 --> 00:44:46,772
But let's just take it slow.

665
00:44:53,973 --> 00:44:55,873
- Uh-oh!
- Watch out!

666
00:45:02,673 --> 00:45:03,573
Oh!

667
00:45:05,573 --> 00:45:06,972
Oh!

668
00:45:06,973 --> 00:45:08,472
What did you push me for?

669
00:45:08,473 --> 00:45:10,273
I saved you, you moron.

670
00:45:23,874 --> 00:45:25,873
That can't be good.
I'd better check it out.

671
00:45:25,874 --> 00:45:28,274
Oh, wait, wait!
I'm hurt.

672
00:45:28,374 --> 00:45:31,074
No, you're not.
Nothing could hurt you.

673
00:45:31,174 --> 00:45:32,774
Are you calling me a liar?

674
00:45:32,874 --> 00:45:35,173
All right,
where are you hurt, then?

675
00:45:35,175 --> 00:45:36,875
My ankle.

676
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,375
See?

677
00:45:46,275 --> 00:45:47,775
What the hell?

678
00:45:54,475 --> 00:45:55,975
Perfect.

679
00:45:57,276 --> 00:45:58,276
Oh!

680
00:46:00,476 --> 00:46:01,576
No!

681
00:46:08,576 --> 00:46:10,575
Jeez, they're really
piling up... up there.

682
00:46:10,576 --> 00:46:11,575
My ankle.

683
00:46:11,576 --> 00:46:13,876
Your ankle is fine.
I'm going.

684
00:46:23,677 --> 00:46:25,176
Are you mixing medications?

685
00:46:25,177 --> 00:46:27,077
You're ruining the magic, idiot.

686
00:46:28,877 --> 00:46:31,277
I'm much sorry.

687
00:46:31,377 --> 00:46:34,677
Must be glass in road.

688
00:46:37,578 --> 00:46:38,877
Ah, the statue stealer.

689
00:46:38,878 --> 00:46:40,478
Why is it whenever I see you...

690
00:46:40,578 --> 00:46:42,477
things seem to be
going into the crapper?

691
00:46:42,478 --> 00:46:45,578
You have head injury.
I rush you to hospital.

692
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:46,778
No, no, no.

693
00:46:48,078 --> 00:46:50,277
I don't. No. No.

694
00:46:50,278 --> 00:46:51,777
The police will
be along shortly...

695
00:46:51,778 --> 00:46:54,278
and they'll sort this out.

696
00:46:57,078 --> 00:46:58,078
Ooh!

697
00:46:58,779 --> 00:46:59,679
See?

698
00:46:59,779 --> 00:47:02,778
Delayed shooting head pains.

699
00:47:02,779 --> 00:47:05,878
Come. To hospital we go.

700
00:47:05,879 --> 00:47:08,078
What about your car?
You have flat tires.

701
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:09,478
Oh, is nothing.

702
00:47:09,479 --> 00:47:10,879
Ooh.

703
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,980
What the hell are you doing?
Get off me!

704
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,579
What?

705
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:26,980
- You were the one who...
- I got to go.

706
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,579
How do I look?

707
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:41,979
If I were a guy, I'd do you.

708
00:47:41,981 --> 00:47:44,180
You're sweet.

709
00:47:44,181 --> 00:47:47,081
I'm going back to the hospital
to see if I can fix...

710
00:47:47,181 --> 00:47:48,581
the mess you made last night.

711
00:47:48,681 --> 00:47:50,980
With that on,
he'll forgive anything.

712
00:47:50,981 --> 00:47:52,180
He better...

713
00:47:52,181 --> 00:47:53,380
for your sake.

714
00:47:53,381 --> 00:47:55,281
Be nice or I won't tell you
which eye looks bigger.

715
00:47:57,281 --> 00:47:58,680
Which?

716
00:47:58,681 --> 00:48:01,981
- Are you going to be nice?
- I'm always nice.

717
00:48:02,082 --> 00:48:03,381
The left.

718
00:48:03,382 --> 00:48:04,882
Here, use my eyeliner.

719
00:48:08,082 --> 00:48:09,582
Shit.

720
00:48:11,782 --> 00:48:14,181
I want my purse, jerk-off.

721
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:16,381
That's not very friendly.

722
00:48:16,382 --> 00:48:17,882
Now, I want you
to go back out...

723
00:48:17,982 --> 00:48:19,381
and this time,
when you kick the door open...

724
00:48:19,382 --> 00:48:20,681
say something nice.

725
00:48:20,682 --> 00:48:22,381
You stole my purse, dipshit...

726
00:48:22,382 --> 00:48:25,281
and you stole it so I'd have to
see your ugly-ass face again.

727
00:48:25,283 --> 00:48:29,182
No, you forgot your purse
for the second time...

728
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:30,682
because you were in such
a hurry to strand me...

729
00:48:30,683 --> 00:48:33,082
- in the middle of nowhere.
- Look, just give it to me.

730
00:48:33,083 --> 00:48:35,782
Or would you rather have
my heel up your ass?

731
00:48:35,783 --> 00:48:38,283
Who told you I'm into that?

732
00:48:42,483 --> 00:48:43,982
Pretty rough on
the boss, weren't you?

733
00:48:43,984 --> 00:48:45,883
You know, he's not
really into ass play.

734
00:48:45,884 --> 00:48:47,384
That's just, like,
his sense of humor.

735
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:49,884
He owns this place?

736
00:48:49,984 --> 00:48:52,183
Yeah, his dad left it to him.

737
00:48:52,184 --> 00:48:53,584
Of course, all these
development creeps...

738
00:48:53,684 --> 00:48:55,984
are trying to give him,
like, 3 mil for the place.

739
00:48:56,084 --> 00:48:59,384
Whole world's going to be
Gaps and Starbucks, right?

740
00:49:02,084 --> 00:49:03,683
He's loaded.

741
00:49:03,684 --> 00:49:06,084
Good, Page.

742
00:49:11,385 --> 00:49:12,285
Greetings.

743
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:16,784
Oh, it's you.

744
00:49:16,785 --> 00:49:18,785
Doctors don't want me to smoke.

745
00:49:18,885 --> 00:49:20,284
It's ridiculous.

746
00:49:20,285 --> 00:49:22,485
They depend on cigarettes.

747
00:49:22,585 --> 00:49:25,585
A perfect scapegoat
for their incompetence.

748
00:49:25,686 --> 00:49:27,886
I assume you're here
about the insurance.

749
00:49:27,986 --> 00:49:28,986
My attorneys will
take care of it.

750
00:49:29,086 --> 00:49:30,886
That won't be necessary.

751
00:49:30,986 --> 00:49:32,185
I have no want to sue you.

752
00:49:32,186 --> 00:49:33,185
Sue me?

753
00:49:33,186 --> 00:49:35,186
My people will tear you a new...

754
00:49:35,286 --> 00:49:40,786
I am only come
to see how you feel...

755
00:49:42,186 --> 00:49:46,686
my poor, poor, Babushka.

756
00:49:50,987 --> 00:49:53,386
That's very nice of you, Mrs...

757
00:49:53,387 --> 00:49:56,187
Miss.
Just call me...

758
00:49:57,887 --> 00:49:59,487
Ulga.

759
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:04,386
- Ulga?
- Mmm.

760
00:50:04,387 --> 00:50:06,387
Well, that's lovely, Ulga.

761
00:50:36,889 --> 00:50:37,888
Yes?

762
00:50:37,889 --> 00:50:40,988
I am Ulga Yevanova.
I am here to...

763
00:50:40,989 --> 00:50:44,489
Yes. We've been expecting you.

764
00:50:44,589 --> 00:50:48,888
I am Miss Madress.
I run this household.

765
00:50:48,889 --> 00:50:51,989
Oh, good for you.

766
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,690
I will announce you.

767
00:50:57,790 --> 00:50:59,390
We have a bitch alert.

768
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:07,289
Come on, bartender.
It's your night off.

769
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:09,190
Do something fun.

770
00:51:13,591 --> 00:51:15,291
Good boy.

771
00:51:37,292 --> 00:51:39,591
I love it here.

772
00:51:39,592 --> 00:51:41,292
It's the only
bloody place left...

773
00:51:41,392 --> 00:51:43,091
that doesn't make you feel
like a serial killer...

774
00:51:43,092 --> 00:51:44,592
for having a damn smoke.

775
00:51:44,692 --> 00:51:46,292
Yes, is lovely.

776
00:51:48,992 --> 00:51:51,991
I'll be your waiter
tonight--Vladimir.

777
00:51:51,992 --> 00:51:53,892
Allow me to tell you
tonight's specials.

778
00:51:53,993 --> 00:51:55,793
No need for English
tonight, Vlad.

779
00:51:55,893 --> 00:51:57,793
We have one of
your country women here.

780
00:51:57,893 --> 00:51:59,393
Oh, wonderful.

781
00:52:01,593 --> 00:52:02,693
So, tonight we have...

782
00:52:04,993 --> 00:52:05,993
Da.

783
00:52:07,693 --> 00:52:09,293
Da. Da.

784
00:52:15,494 --> 00:52:17,793
Excellent choice.
The steak tartare.

785
00:52:17,794 --> 00:52:22,594
Oh, I love a woman
who eats raw meat.

786
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,795
That's real nice!

787
00:52:58,396 --> 00:52:59,795
You're not just going
to stand there.

788
00:52:59,796 --> 00:53:00,796
Help me.

789
00:53:01,696 --> 00:53:03,495
Please.

790
00:53:03,496 --> 00:53:06,795
Isn't that the shoe you
wanted to jam up my ass?

791
00:53:06,796 --> 00:53:09,195
No, that was the 6-inch heel.

792
00:53:09,196 --> 00:53:10,996
Now come on.

793
00:53:11,796 --> 00:53:13,596
What are you doing here?

794
00:53:13,696 --> 00:53:16,596
Uh...working.

795
00:53:16,696 --> 00:53:18,596
Working?

796
00:53:18,697 --> 00:53:21,397
You some kind of wilderness
female mud wrestler?

797
00:53:22,797 --> 00:53:24,497
I am an environmentalist
studying the effect...

798
00:53:24,597 --> 00:53:27,397
of waste run of from
the neighboring wetlands.

799
00:53:27,897 --> 00:53:29,896
Oh, well...

800
00:53:29,897 --> 00:53:33,396
you environmentalists
really dress hot.

801
00:53:33,397 --> 00:53:34,597
Yeah, well...

802
00:53:34,697 --> 00:53:36,596
there's no law that says
you can't look good...

803
00:53:36,597 --> 00:53:38,497
while you're saving stuff.

804
00:53:38,598 --> 00:53:40,197
So, why are you following me?

805
00:53:40,198 --> 00:53:43,598
- I'm not following you!
- Then what are you doing here?

806
00:53:45,098 --> 00:53:46,998
Come on, I'll show you.

807
00:53:47,598 --> 00:53:50,998
You're not out here burying
high-school kids, are you?

808
00:53:52,298 --> 00:53:54,198
Well, they egged my car.

809
00:54:04,499 --> 00:54:07,298
What do you do?
Spy on people humping in boats?

810
00:54:07,299 --> 00:54:08,899
That's so perverted.

811
00:54:08,999 --> 00:54:11,298
I photograph stars.

812
00:54:11,299 --> 00:54:12,798
Look, just because
they're famous...

813
00:54:12,799 --> 00:54:15,799
doesn't mean they don't deserve
their privacy, too.

814
00:54:15,899 --> 00:54:17,399
Who you got?

815
00:54:18,799 --> 00:54:20,899
The stars up there.

816
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,200
You sneak all the way out here
to stare at space and shit?

817
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:29,499
No, I come here to get away
from the lights of the city...

818
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:32,700
so I can see
the space and shit.

819
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,000
- Why?
- Take a look.

820
00:54:43,101 --> 00:54:45,000
Jesus.

821
00:54:45,001 --> 00:54:46,800
That's the Crab Nebula.

822
00:54:46,801 --> 00:54:49,801
That is the exact color
of a sapphire ring I wanted.

823
00:54:51,101 --> 00:54:52,101
OK.

824
00:54:55,001 --> 00:54:56,600
And this...

825
00:54:56,601 --> 00:54:59,800
is the great
globular cluster in Hercules.

826
00:54:59,801 --> 00:55:01,601
I don't think
I want to see that.

827
00:55:06,502 --> 00:55:07,701
Wow.

828
00:55:07,702 --> 00:55:09,402
Good cluster.

829
00:55:09,502 --> 00:55:13,802
And I think you can also see
the Corona Borealis, too.

830
00:55:13,902 --> 00:55:16,602
Wait, wait, I'm not done
with the globular thing.

831
00:55:20,202 --> 00:55:21,202
OK...

832
00:55:46,604 --> 00:55:49,603
I love to watch a woman eat.

833
00:55:49,604 --> 00:55:52,404
It is surely one of
the most sensual acts.

834
00:56:19,505 --> 00:56:22,904
Is such joy to hear
my native tongue again.

835
00:56:22,905 --> 00:56:27,105
I deeply appreciate
what you say, and...

836
00:56:29,506 --> 00:56:31,106
what you don't say.

837
00:56:35,606 --> 00:56:39,606
Oh, William,
so much loudness.

838
00:56:39,706 --> 00:56:45,305
Can we not go somewhere
I can relate to you...

839
00:56:45,306 --> 00:56:46,306
orally.

840
00:56:49,107 --> 00:56:50,307
All right.

841
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:53,407
Who will favor us
with next song?

842
00:56:58,007 --> 00:57:00,207
We have a fellow
country woman here.

843
00:57:00,307 --> 00:57:01,807
No, I am so...

844
00:57:04,007 --> 00:57:06,707
Please, I am so not musical.

845
00:57:08,207 --> 00:57:10,706
- Please, uh...
- How about "Karabuschka?"

846
00:57:10,708 --> 00:57:12,707
I know there isn't
a Russian alive...

847
00:57:12,708 --> 00:57:14,508
who doesn't know "Karabuschka!"

848
00:57:27,108 --> 00:57:31,108
Karabuschka

849
00:57:31,209 --> 00:57:34,209
Da, da, da

850
00:57:37,409 --> 00:57:39,309
Moscow

851
00:57:41,109 --> 00:57:42,609
Leningrad

852
00:57:45,309 --> 00:57:46,309
Minsk...

853
00:57:47,609 --> 00:57:51,808
Oh, you know,
I am just fooling.

854
00:57:51,810 --> 00:57:55,910
I am so full
of good humor.

855
00:58:11,310 --> 00:58:17,609
Flew in from
Miami Beach B.O.A.C.

856
00:58:17,611 --> 00:58:21,311
Didn't get to bed last night

857
00:58:23,011 --> 00:58:28,711
On the way the paper bag
was on my knee

858
00:58:28,811 --> 00:58:32,110
Man, I had a dread ful flight

859
00:58:32,111 --> 00:58:34,111
I'm back in the U.S.S.R.

860
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:38,912
You don't know
how lucky you are, boy

861
00:58:39,012 --> 00:58:41,112
Back in the U.S.S.R.

862
00:58:43,912 --> 00:58:47,412
Been away so long
I hardly knew the place

863
00:58:47,512 --> 00:58:49,812
Gee, it's good to be back home

864
00:58:50,812 --> 00:58:54,211
Leave it till tomorrow
to unpack my case

865
00:58:54,212 --> 00:58:56,411
Honey, disconnect the phone

866
00:58:56,413 --> 00:58:58,313
I'm back in the U.S.S.R.

867
00:58:59,813 --> 00:59:03,112
You don't know
how lucky you are, boy

868
00:59:03,113 --> 00:59:04,312
Back in the U.S.

869
00:59:04,313 --> 00:59:05,713
Back in the U.S.

870
00:59:05,813 --> 00:59:08,013
Back in the U.S.S.R.

871
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:11,513
Look, there's another one.

872
00:59:14,013 --> 00:59:15,913
Oh, there's two at once.
Did you see that?

873
00:59:16,014 --> 00:59:17,114
Yeah.

874
00:59:17,214 --> 00:59:20,314
God, I never knew you could
have this much fun for free.

875
00:59:22,214 --> 00:59:25,614
Well, it's not completely free.

876
00:59:30,914 --> 00:59:34,314
So, are you ready
to tell me the truth?

877
00:59:34,414 --> 00:59:36,913
What?

878
00:59:36,915 --> 00:59:39,115
Tell me why
you're here, really.

879
00:59:40,215 --> 00:59:43,814
I told you,
I'm an environmentalist...

880
00:59:43,815 --> 00:59:46,714
student at
the University of Miami.

881
00:59:46,715 --> 00:59:48,715
What? You don't believe me?

882
00:59:50,115 --> 00:59:52,114
Well, I'd like to, but...

883
00:59:52,115 --> 00:59:53,815
What about my butt?

884
00:59:56,915 --> 00:59:59,414
- Ooh, I got to go.
- Again?

885
00:59:59,416 --> 01:00:02,715
- Yeah, I have work to do.
- It's 11:00 at night.

886
01:00:02,716 --> 01:00:05,316
I know, but I have to write
an environmental impact report.

887
01:00:05,416 --> 01:00:07,316
Will it mention me?

888
01:00:08,316 --> 01:00:10,616
- Wait! What's your name?
- Uh, Jane.

889
01:00:10,716 --> 01:00:12,015
Will I see you again?

890
01:00:12,016 --> 01:00:13,816
Try wishing on a star.

891
01:00:23,017 --> 01:00:24,817
Is that 5 people?

892
01:00:31,717 --> 01:00:33,017
Keys are in it.

893
01:00:53,418 --> 01:00:55,518
Hey, Mom.
How did it go?

894
01:00:56,118 --> 01:00:57,618
Perfect.

895
01:00:59,218 --> 01:01:03,617
His infatuation
is right on schedule.

896
01:01:03,619 --> 01:01:04,818
You know, you're home now.

897
01:01:04,819 --> 01:01:06,419
You can stop
with the accent.

898
01:01:07,619 --> 01:01:10,019
- What's that?
- What's what?

899
01:01:13,019 --> 01:01:16,318
- Mud?
- I gave myself a facial...

900
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:17,919
some special local stuff.

901
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:21,819
I think I'll to take a nice
long shower and go to bed.

902
01:01:21,919 --> 01:01:22,919
Good night.

903
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:41,619
Smoking is part of
the fun of being a kid.

904
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:44,819
We just did some tests
on some 9-year-olds.

905
01:01:44,821 --> 01:01:46,021
After a little puking...

906
01:01:46,121 --> 01:01:48,521
why, you couldn't drag them
away from the stuff.

907
01:01:49,821 --> 01:01:51,721
You're only young once.

908
01:01:51,821 --> 01:01:53,521
Why not indulge, I always say.

909
01:01:54,621 --> 01:01:57,520
Oh, darling, what matter?

910
01:01:57,521 --> 01:01:59,620
Head pain back again?

911
01:01:59,621 --> 01:02:01,721
No, no, it's all right.

912
01:02:12,522 --> 01:02:16,822
- I have a gift for you.
- A gift?

913
01:02:18,022 --> 01:02:20,822
A gift! Oh!

914
01:02:25,022 --> 01:02:32,121
Oh, a personal fire device.

915
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:34,322
I'm not insisting
you take up smoking...

916
01:02:34,323 --> 01:02:38,122
but I thought it would
give you some incentive.

917
01:02:38,123 --> 01:02:42,623
There is nothing sexier
than smoke billowing proudly...

918
01:02:42,723 --> 01:02:48,923
out of a woman's hot,
red, engorged nostrils.

919
01:02:50,824 --> 01:02:55,223
That image will haunt me.

920
01:02:55,224 --> 01:02:56,823
Still a little sleepy, my dear?

921
01:02:56,824 --> 01:03:02,024
Oh, no, no, it was
another wonderful night.

922
01:03:03,524 --> 01:03:08,223
I think that I deserve
a big kiss for that big gift.

923
01:03:08,225 --> 01:03:11,125
Oh, yes.

924
01:03:11,225 --> 01:03:13,425
Is no getting
around that.

925
01:03:21,625 --> 01:03:23,124
Oh, oh, no.

926
01:03:23,125 --> 01:03:28,824
We mustn't.
God is everywhere.

927
01:03:28,826 --> 01:03:31,526
Yes, he is, isn't he?

928
01:03:31,626 --> 01:03:33,126
Nosy bastard.

929
01:03:34,426 --> 01:03:38,026
I'll have Miss Madress
get your purse.

930
01:03:45,726 --> 01:03:47,926
Is he that repulsive to you?

931
01:03:51,027 --> 01:03:56,026
No. Is Russian
expression of happiness.

932
01:03:56,027 --> 01:03:58,327
Ptui, ptui,
oh, I am so happy.

933
01:03:58,427 --> 01:04:01,127
Save it.
I'm on to you.

934
01:04:02,727 --> 01:04:05,127
You're attracted to me?

935
01:04:05,227 --> 01:04:07,927
Oh, flattering,
but I no do females.

936
01:04:08,627 --> 01:04:10,926
I've been with him for 7 years.

937
01:04:10,928 --> 01:04:12,727
I've seen him with many women.

938
01:04:12,728 --> 01:04:14,228
I've never worried.

939
01:04:14,328 --> 01:04:16,327
Passing amusements.

940
01:04:16,328 --> 01:04:19,028
But you, oh, you're good, baby.

941
01:04:19,828 --> 01:04:22,928
I no understand.
What is you want?

942
01:04:23,028 --> 01:04:28,628
I is want your ex-commie ass
out of his life.

943
01:04:28,728 --> 01:04:30,328
I didn't put up
with his crap for years...

944
01:04:30,428 --> 01:04:32,227
just to be squeezed out
right before he kicks.

945
01:04:32,229 --> 01:04:34,528
I've put in the time,
and I expect a big payoff.

946
01:04:34,529 --> 01:04:40,328
Oh, you must believe,
I have true feelings for him.

947
01:04:40,329 --> 01:04:43,729
Oh, spare me
your Bolshevik bullshit.

948
01:04:43,829 --> 01:04:45,028
Either you disappear...

949
01:04:45,029 --> 01:04:47,429
or I tell him exactly
what I saw.

950
01:04:48,629 --> 01:04:51,729
Your dark honesty
is refreshing...

951
01:04:51,829 --> 01:04:53,928
but please, I beg you...

952
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:57,930
Leave me one more night
to bow out gracefully.

953
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:14,030
I have something for you.

954
01:05:22,031 --> 01:05:24,730
I know it's not the sapphire
you wanted, but...

955
01:05:24,731 --> 01:05:27,531
It sure isn't.

956
01:05:27,631 --> 01:05:29,931
It's a meteor fragment.

957
01:05:30,031 --> 01:05:31,530
Like the ones
we were watching?

958
01:05:31,531 --> 01:05:34,831
That's been to the far reaches
of our solar system and back.

959
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:37,231
No lousy sapphire has
ever pulled that off.

960
01:05:39,532 --> 01:05:42,832
You don't do anything
like normal people, do you?

961
01:05:43,432 --> 01:05:44,532
Some things.

962
01:06:29,934 --> 01:06:31,433
Kitchen's through there.

963
01:06:31,434 --> 01:06:34,834
Master bedroom's upstairs.
Her room is down the hall.

964
01:06:34,934 --> 01:06:36,433
You have 7 minutes.

965
01:06:36,434 --> 01:06:37,933
Here you go.

966
01:06:37,934 --> 01:06:38,934
The thing that's screwing us...

967
01:06:39,035 --> 01:06:42,135
is all this secondhand
smoke nonsense.

968
01:06:43,035 --> 01:06:44,634
They've convicted
the tobacco companies...

969
01:06:44,635 --> 01:06:46,535
without a shred of evidence.

970
01:06:49,735 --> 01:06:53,134
Hmm...is oddness.

971
01:06:53,135 --> 01:06:54,835
What?

972
01:06:54,935 --> 01:06:58,335
Costly lighter gift
you gave is missing.

973
01:06:58,435 --> 01:07:01,034
Oh, you must have
left it somewhere.

974
01:07:01,036 --> 01:07:04,135
Never. I cherish too much.

975
01:07:04,136 --> 01:07:05,736
Perhaps...

976
01:07:07,136 --> 01:07:08,935
No.

977
01:07:08,936 --> 01:07:12,836
Is inconceivablish.

978
01:07:12,936 --> 01:07:14,336
What is inconceivablish?

979
01:07:16,336 --> 01:07:19,235
Well, your housekeep
did much admire...

980
01:07:19,236 --> 01:07:25,836
and when she give me purse
to leave yesterday, was open.

981
01:07:27,437 --> 01:07:28,537
Sir, I swear to you...

982
01:07:28,637 --> 01:07:31,537
I would never take so much as
a hairpin from this household.

983
01:07:32,737 --> 01:07:35,436
Is this not clothing
you wear yesterday...

984
01:07:35,437 --> 01:07:37,737
when you see me out?

985
01:07:39,437 --> 01:07:40,537
Hello.

986
01:07:43,238 --> 01:07:44,837
She set me up.

987
01:07:44,838 --> 01:07:47,638
She could have slipped that
into my pocket any time.

988
01:07:50,738 --> 01:07:53,437
You doubt me?

989
01:07:53,438 --> 01:07:55,138
Oh, William.

990
01:08:02,839 --> 01:08:05,739
Oh, how you can sleep
on so lumpy a...

991
01:08:08,039 --> 01:08:09,538
My wife's old jewelry.

992
01:08:09,539 --> 01:08:13,339
Why you are stealing from
loyal, kind employer man?

993
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:16,439
No! It's her.
Can't you see?

994
01:08:17,139 --> 01:08:18,739
You bitch!

995
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:26,340
My cigarettes?

996
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,840
I feel like vomiting.

997
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:32,940
Oh, please, Mr. Tensy.

998
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:35,639
I have been a dedicated
and trust worthy servant...

999
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:37,239
for over 7 years.

1000
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:39,639
Look into my eyes.

1001
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:42,640
You must believe in my complete
and total innocence.

1002
01:08:55,741 --> 01:08:58,540
If it's at all possible...

1003
01:08:58,541 --> 01:09:00,641
could you slap her around
a little bit?

1004
01:09:02,841 --> 01:09:04,340
That's very good, Darling.

1005
01:09:04,341 --> 01:09:07,140
You're doing better.

1006
01:09:07,142 --> 01:09:09,342
Come on, let's hear
a little pain.

1007
01:09:10,842 --> 01:09:12,441
I've set you up with
an interview...

1008
01:09:12,442 --> 01:09:14,742
for Tensy's housekeeper
position tomorrow.

1009
01:09:14,842 --> 01:09:16,742
Tomorrow?
That's Saturday.

1010
01:09:16,842 --> 01:09:19,141
Well, there are no weekends
in conning, dear.

1011
01:09:19,142 --> 01:09:20,941
I'll go the first thing Monday.

1012
01:09:20,942 --> 01:09:22,742
No, you'll go tomorrow.

1013
01:09:22,842 --> 01:09:25,141
We can't take the chance of
someone else getting that job.

1014
01:09:25,142 --> 01:09:26,942
You have to start
getting close to him now.

1015
01:09:27,043 --> 01:09:29,642
My god, he's days away
from popping the question.

1016
01:09:29,643 --> 01:09:31,143
No way.

1017
01:09:31,243 --> 01:09:33,043
You couldn't have gotten
him that far this fast.

1018
01:09:33,143 --> 01:09:35,043
Have you really
learned so little?

1019
01:09:36,143 --> 01:09:39,243
One month flat.
That's a new record.

1020
01:09:39,343 --> 01:09:40,743
Mom's still got it.

1021
01:09:42,643 --> 01:09:44,243
Jack, I'm still
coming to the game.

1022
01:09:44,343 --> 01:09:45,843
I just may be a little late,
that's all.

1023
01:09:47,343 --> 01:09:49,342
Well, hey, I'm sure
the van can wait...

1024
01:09:49,344 --> 01:09:50,844
for, like, 5 minutes.

1025
01:09:52,144 --> 01:09:54,143
Look, I-I'll probably
make it on time anyway.

1026
01:09:54,144 --> 01:09:55,143
I gotta go.

1027
01:09:55,144 --> 01:09:56,144
Bye.

1028
01:09:58,344 --> 01:10:01,343
Sorry I'm running late,
Miss Breckenhall, but...

1029
01:10:01,344 --> 01:10:05,544
I've been losing consciousness
more frequently lately.

1030
01:10:05,644 --> 01:10:07,643
Allergy season, I think.

1031
01:10:07,644 --> 01:10:09,643
Well, it's no problem at all...

1032
01:10:09,645 --> 01:10:11,244
But please, call me Allison.

1033
01:10:11,245 --> 01:10:12,444
Oh, well...

1034
01:10:12,445 --> 01:10:13,745
Allison, I--

1035
01:10:13,845 --> 01:10:15,745
I just have a few
questions to ask you.

1036
01:10:26,345 --> 01:10:28,845
Do you smoke, Allison?

1037
01:10:28,945 --> 01:10:31,944
- No.
- No.

1038
01:10:31,946 --> 01:10:33,746
Well, uh...

1039
01:10:38,346 --> 01:10:39,945
we gotta go!

1040
01:10:39,946 --> 01:10:42,145
She said she'd be
a little late.

1041
01:10:42,146 --> 01:10:44,945
20 minutes
is not a little.

1042
01:10:44,946 --> 01:10:47,345
We've entered
stood-up territory.

1043
01:10:47,346 --> 01:10:48,945
Then I worked for
the English Ambassador...

1044
01:10:48,946 --> 01:10:51,546
to Turkey for 4 1/2 years,
until they shot him.

1045
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:53,246
Oh, they shot him?

1046
01:10:53,247 --> 01:10:54,747
But I kept cleaning...

1047
01:10:54,847 --> 01:10:56,747
right up until they
burned the embassy down.

1048
01:10:56,847 --> 01:10:58,947
Well, that was very loyal.

1049
01:10:59,047 --> 01:11:01,246
So, when should I start?

1050
01:11:01,247 --> 01:11:03,446
If you could just...

1051
01:11:03,447 --> 01:11:05,246
fill out
this application form...

1052
01:11:05,247 --> 01:11:06,246
then I can, uh...

1053
01:11:06,247 --> 01:11:08,147
verify your employment.

1054
01:11:08,247 --> 01:11:10,347
Oh, certainly.

1055
01:11:10,447 --> 01:11:12,846
Oh! Oh!

1056
01:11:12,848 --> 01:11:14,247
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

1057
01:11:14,248 --> 01:11:15,247
Oh...

1058
01:11:15,248 --> 01:11:16,948
I'll get towel.

1059
01:11:35,149 --> 01:11:38,648
Y-You seem very dedicated
to your work, Allison.

1060
01:11:38,649 --> 01:11:40,249
Something inside me--

1061
01:11:40,349 --> 01:11:43,449
this need to please my employer
in any way possible.

1062
01:11:50,049 --> 01:11:51,448
Here is towel.

1063
01:11:51,449 --> 01:11:54,449
And I find other
employment form.

1064
01:11:54,550 --> 01:11:56,649
Oh, well...

1065
01:11:56,650 --> 01:11:59,250
I-I don't think
that'll be necessary.

1066
01:11:59,350 --> 01:12:01,850
Allison seems...

1067
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:03,450
more than qualified.

1068
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:08,550
Hmm, it's still wet.

1069
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:12,550
Not bad, huh?

1070
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:15,749
Oh, what?

1071
01:12:15,751 --> 01:12:16,851
It's just a little hacky...

1072
01:12:16,951 --> 01:12:20,051
to go right for
the member massage.

1073
01:12:20,151 --> 01:12:22,051
What are you doing
the rest of today?

1074
01:12:22,151 --> 01:12:23,750
Oh, um, I don't know.

1075
01:12:23,751 --> 01:12:25,051
Beach, nap, nothing.

1076
01:12:25,151 --> 01:12:26,151
See ya.

1077
01:12:44,252 --> 01:12:46,052
Shit!

1078
01:12:46,152 --> 01:12:49,452
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1079
01:12:51,852 --> 01:12:54,552
You really are
a delicate flower.

1080
01:12:54,652 --> 01:12:56,951
Jack!

1081
01:12:56,952 --> 01:12:59,651
You missed the game.
Why didn't you go?

1082
01:12:59,653 --> 01:13:01,152
I don't know.

1083
01:13:01,153 --> 01:13:03,953
My friends have
this theory that...

1084
01:13:06,653 --> 01:13:08,153
I'm in love with you.

1085
01:13:39,554 --> 01:13:40,854
Hello, Daughter.

1086
01:13:42,955 --> 01:13:44,055
What are you doing here?

1087
01:13:44,155 --> 01:13:45,754
I thought you'd be
out with Tensy.

1088
01:13:45,755 --> 01:13:48,555
Sometimes people aren't where
they say they're going to be.

1089
01:13:48,655 --> 01:13:50,454
Oh, well, I got bored
hanging around here...

1090
01:13:50,455 --> 01:13:51,954
so I took myself out for a walk.

1091
01:13:51,955 --> 01:13:53,654
Bullshit.

1092
01:13:53,655 --> 01:13:57,355
I saw you with your boy friend.

1093
01:13:57,455 --> 01:13:59,554
You spied on me?

1094
01:13:59,555 --> 01:14:02,254
So, this is why you've been
being so nice to me.

1095
01:14:02,256 --> 01:14:03,755
I have not been nice to you.

1096
01:14:03,756 --> 01:14:07,655
You betray me
for some bartender.

1097
01:14:07,656 --> 01:14:10,555
That bartender
happens to own the bar...

1098
01:14:10,556 --> 01:14:13,255
and has a firm offer
to sell for 3 million.

1099
01:14:13,256 --> 01:14:14,555
You're not ready, Page.

1100
01:14:14,556 --> 01:14:16,055
Yeah, so not ready
that I already got him...

1101
01:14:16,056 --> 01:14:17,256
to say he loves me.

1102
01:14:17,356 --> 01:14:19,356
I mean you're not
ready to con a guy...

1103
01:14:19,456 --> 01:14:21,255
without falling
in love yourself.

1104
01:14:21,256 --> 01:14:23,055
Give me a break.
I am in complete control.

1105
01:14:23,057 --> 01:14:24,056
I saw the kiss.

1106
01:14:24,057 --> 01:14:25,757
Your eyes were closed.

1107
01:14:27,057 --> 01:14:28,356
That was the sun.

1108
01:14:28,357 --> 01:14:30,557
Last time the sun
got in my eyes...

1109
01:14:30,657 --> 01:14:31,756
I wound up
with a daughter.

1110
01:14:31,757 --> 01:14:33,057
Yeah, and that's just
about the worst thing...

1111
01:14:33,157 --> 01:14:34,857
that ever happened
to you, isn't it?

1112
01:14:37,657 --> 01:14:40,057
I'm a pro, Mother,
and I'll prove it.

1113
01:15:00,658 --> 01:15:03,058
There, nothing...

1114
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:07,458
but the best from you.

1115
01:15:07,459 --> 01:15:09,559
Well, give me a chance
to make it even better.

1116
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:30,160
Crap!

1117
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:32,759
- What's wrong?
- I got ta go.

1118
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:35,059
- Why?
- Because I'm no good for you.

1119
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:36,759
I'll be the judge
of that.

1120
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:38,559
No, I just--
you have to trust me.

1121
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:39,959
I am not a good person.

1122
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:40,959
No, you are good.

1123
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,259
You may not know it,
but I do.

1124
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:45,660
You come on tough,
but it's all just an act.

1125
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:46,759
I mean, you
don't even believe...

1126
01:15:46,761 --> 01:15:48,260
in sleeping together
before marriage.

1127
01:15:48,261 --> 01:15:50,060
You're like a Brady
or an Osmond or something.

1128
01:15:50,061 --> 01:15:51,760
Look, you don't get it, OK?

1129
01:15:51,761 --> 01:15:54,160
I haven't been
completely honest with you.

1130
01:15:54,161 --> 01:15:57,560
Look, I know you're not
really an environmentalist.

1131
01:15:57,561 --> 01:15:58,960
Who cares?

1132
01:15:58,961 --> 01:16:00,260
The important thing is...

1133
01:16:00,261 --> 01:16:02,561
I love you
and I want to be with you.

1134
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:07,161
I got ta go.

1135
01:16:14,562 --> 01:16:16,862
You win.
I drop the con.

1136
01:16:16,962 --> 01:16:20,062
- It's for the best, Dear.
- Shut up, Mother.

1137
01:16:40,263 --> 01:16:41,363
Barbara!

1138
01:16:48,363 --> 01:16:50,063
You are a lifesaver.

1139
01:16:50,164 --> 01:16:53,263
To pull that job off
on such short notice--

1140
01:16:53,264 --> 01:16:55,064
I was taught by the best.

1141
01:16:55,164 --> 01:16:56,463
I had a blast.

1142
01:16:56,464 --> 01:16:57,963
I've been out of
the game for so long...

1143
01:16:57,964 --> 01:16:59,463
I've forgotten how much
fun it could be--

1144
01:16:59,464 --> 01:17:01,663
even though we were
conning your own daughter...

1145
01:17:01,664 --> 01:17:04,663
who I haven't seen
since she was what, 4?

1146
01:17:04,664 --> 01:17:05,863
3.

1147
01:17:05,864 --> 01:17:07,464
But we weren't conning her.

1148
01:17:07,564 --> 01:17:09,164
We were protecting her.

1149
01:17:09,264 --> 01:17:11,464
She wanted to run
off on her own...

1150
01:17:11,565 --> 01:17:13,564
and this was the only
way to stop her.

1151
01:17:13,565 --> 01:17:15,965
You know, you won't be
able to stop her forever.

1152
01:17:17,265 --> 01:17:18,165
I know that.

1153
01:17:18,265 --> 01:17:21,665
You know, Page is an amazing,
brilliant, talented girl.

1154
01:17:21,765 --> 01:17:23,364
But she's still green.

1155
01:17:23,365 --> 01:17:24,364
When she's ready...

1156
01:17:24,365 --> 01:17:26,064
I'll be the first
one to tell her.

1157
01:17:26,065 --> 01:17:27,965
And you're sure
she's not ready now?

1158
01:17:30,065 --> 01:17:32,364
I just caught her
kissing some loser...

1159
01:17:32,366 --> 01:17:34,366
with her eyes closed.

1160
01:17:35,866 --> 01:17:37,266
Really?

1161
01:17:41,466 --> 01:17:42,966
I'll get this.

1162
01:17:45,766 --> 01:17:46,866
Classy.

1163
01:17:46,966 --> 01:17:48,466
I'm still learning from you.

1164
01:17:53,967 --> 01:17:55,067
Sweetie, I'm home.

1165
01:17:56,167 --> 01:17:58,067
Sounds like a good day.

1166
01:17:58,167 --> 01:17:59,867
Yeah, it was fantastic.

1167
01:17:59,967 --> 01:18:01,266
Yech, what is Tensy...

1168
01:18:01,267 --> 01:18:02,667
Like, the largest
producer of phlegm...

1169
01:18:02,767 --> 01:18:04,066
on the East Coast?

1170
01:18:04,067 --> 01:18:05,667
I just officially quit smoking.

1171
01:18:05,767 --> 01:18:08,167
Well, the good news
keeps on coming.

1172
01:18:08,267 --> 01:18:10,866
Hey, I got a killer
dress for tonight.

1173
01:18:10,867 --> 01:18:13,566
That, plus the official
letter cannot fail.

1174
01:18:13,567 --> 01:18:16,567
- You want to see?
- No. I'm going out for a walk.

1175
01:18:20,268 --> 01:18:22,168
Ok, well, uh...

1176
01:18:22,268 --> 01:18:23,368
I'm already late.

1177
01:18:28,768 --> 01:18:30,768
Jane, Jane!
Don't hang up!

1178
01:18:38,269 --> 01:18:41,268
You gotta give up
on that girl, man.

1179
01:18:41,269 --> 01:18:44,269
Yeah, there's something
weird about her.

1180
01:18:45,769 --> 01:18:47,868
Yeah, but that's what I liked.

1181
01:18:47,869 --> 01:18:50,069
Me, too.

1182
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:03,870
What are you doing here?

1183
01:19:03,970 --> 01:19:05,369
I was coming to you.

1184
01:19:05,370 --> 01:19:06,570
Let me in.

1185
01:19:06,670 --> 01:19:08,169
I have a surprise.

1186
01:19:08,170 --> 01:19:10,469
Uh, moment.
I'm, uh...naked.

1187
01:19:10,470 --> 01:19:13,270
I don't see a problem there.

1188
01:19:13,370 --> 01:19:15,170
Here I come!

1189
01:19:31,271 --> 01:19:33,770
- Oh, my.
- Completely restored.

1190
01:19:33,771 --> 01:19:36,971
Only 7,000 for a new willy.

1191
01:19:38,172 --> 01:19:40,371
It's so nice.

1192
01:19:40,372 --> 01:19:42,072
But, uh...

1193
01:19:42,172 --> 01:19:44,772
William, you know
how the Lord feels...

1194
01:19:44,872 --> 01:19:47,672
about having men in hotel room.

1195
01:19:48,672 --> 01:19:49,671
even a man who has ordered...

1196
01:19:49,672 --> 01:19:51,672
champagne and oysters
from room service?

1197
01:19:57,372 --> 01:19:59,672
It's OK. I didn't
charge it to your room.

1198
01:20:00,673 --> 01:20:03,073
I cannot anymore see you.

1199
01:20:04,273 --> 01:20:06,173
Why on earth not?

1200
01:20:06,273 --> 01:20:08,272
Oh, let us leave at that.

1201
01:20:08,273 --> 01:20:09,472
Make pain less.

1202
01:20:09,473 --> 01:20:12,673
Good-bye forever.

1203
01:20:16,473 --> 01:20:18,773
No, no. What is
this all about?

1204
01:20:24,274 --> 01:20:26,573
"We regret to in form you
that your application...

1205
01:20:26,574 --> 01:20:29,874
"for permanent residence
has been denied.

1206
01:20:29,974 --> 01:20:33,474
"you must leave the country
no later than tomorrow."

1207
01:20:34,274 --> 01:20:38,273
I try everything, but is
very political red tape...

1208
01:20:38,274 --> 01:20:41,674
to get green card,
and I am loophole less.

1209
01:20:43,175 --> 01:20:44,774
Well...

1210
01:20:44,775 --> 01:20:46,075
this is horrible.

1211
01:20:47,475 --> 01:20:49,574
And to think I was going
to ask you to marry me.

1212
01:20:49,575 --> 01:20:51,275
Marry you?

1213
01:20:51,375 --> 01:20:54,075
Yes, yes, I, uh...

1214
01:20:54,175 --> 01:20:58,575
purchased a ring
and everything.

1215
01:20:59,475 --> 01:21:01,475
But with your leaving...

1216
01:21:02,476 --> 01:21:06,176
I am but ignorant,
unintelligible foreigner...

1217
01:21:06,276 --> 01:21:09,676
but if you marry me,
I believe that puts, uh...

1218
01:21:09,776 --> 01:21:12,276
kibosh on deportation.

1219
01:21:12,376 --> 01:21:13,676
- Really?
- Yes.

1220
01:21:14,876 --> 01:21:15,976
Oh, Ulga...

1221
01:21:16,076 --> 01:21:18,375
Ulga...

1222
01:21:18,376 --> 01:21:19,376
Will you--

1223
01:21:25,077 --> 01:21:26,877
What? What?

1224
01:21:26,977 --> 01:21:31,576
- Marry me?
- Ohh...marry you?

1225
01:21:31,577 --> 01:21:34,177
Oh, is legal question.

1226
01:21:34,277 --> 01:21:38,877
Yes, I will, is binding answer.

1227
01:21:46,078 --> 01:21:47,678
Leave me alone.

1228
01:21:47,778 --> 01:21:49,077
I'm engaged!

1229
01:21:49,078 --> 01:21:51,977
We're talking a settlement
of 20 million minimum!

1230
01:21:51,978 --> 01:21:54,077
Oh, we're finally
set for life, Darling!

1231
01:21:54,078 --> 01:21:56,578
I just have time
for one quickwhoo!

1232
01:22:07,279 --> 01:22:10,379
- I said whoo.
- Why won't you talk to me?

1233
01:22:11,979 --> 01:22:13,179
There's nothing to say.

1234
01:22:13,279 --> 01:22:15,579
I scared you when I told you
I loved you, didn't I?

1235
01:22:16,979 --> 01:22:19,179
Jack, there is no love.

1236
01:22:19,279 --> 01:22:21,078
It's just a trick of
the brain...

1237
01:22:21,079 --> 01:22:24,078
a combination of
hormones and chemicals.

1238
01:22:24,079 --> 01:22:25,779
Then why are you here?

1239
01:22:29,780 --> 01:22:31,579
Tell me to my face
you don't love me.

1240
01:22:31,580 --> 01:22:33,279
I don't love you.

1241
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:37,480
Wow, that was more believable
than I thought it would be.

1242
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:48,580
Look, I know I freaked you out
by moving too fast...

1243
01:22:48,681 --> 01:22:50,381
with all that
"I love you" stuff.

1244
01:22:50,481 --> 01:22:53,081
So, let's just...

1245
01:22:53,181 --> 01:22:54,281
get married.

1246
01:22:56,481 --> 01:22:57,781
I gotta go.

1247
01:23:09,282 --> 01:23:10,482
Oh!

1248
01:23:11,882 --> 01:23:13,981
That is jarring.

1249
01:23:13,982 --> 01:23:16,682
My love, tonight
we will celebrate...

1250
01:23:16,782 --> 01:23:19,581
this ecstatic joining
of our spirits...

1251
01:23:19,582 --> 01:23:20,882
with the union...

1252
01:23:22,582 --> 01:23:25,082
of our aching bodies.

1253
01:23:26,882 --> 01:23:29,381
Oh, you have
stomach cramp again.

1254
01:23:29,382 --> 01:23:31,182
No, no, no. I ache
for you, my pumpkin.

1255
01:23:31,283 --> 01:23:33,682
- Let's hump.
- Oh, William, my religion!

1256
01:23:33,683 --> 01:23:36,582
- Humping is not yet allowed.
- Oh, of course it is.

1257
01:23:36,583 --> 01:23:38,183
I proposed, you accepted.

1258
01:23:38,283 --> 01:23:40,582
To God, everything
else is just paper work.

1259
01:23:40,583 --> 01:23:44,282
Oh, William, I insist
we wait till after wedding.

1260
01:23:44,283 --> 01:23:46,883
Ulga, I am much more
powerful than you.

1261
01:23:46,983 --> 01:23:48,883
Just relax and enjoy it.

1262
01:24:04,084 --> 01:24:07,184
Oh, always something
in your mouth.

1263
01:24:11,084 --> 01:24:12,584
Are you dead?

1264
01:24:27,785 --> 01:24:29,284
Why me?!

1265
01:24:29,285 --> 01:24:32,485
Oh, wake up,
you disgusting shit!

1266
01:24:33,986 --> 01:24:34,886
20 million.

1267
01:24:38,786 --> 01:24:41,286
- What?
- I need you here.

1268
01:24:47,086 --> 01:24:48,186
Wow.

1269
01:24:48,286 --> 01:24:49,785
That's real attractive.

1270
01:24:49,786 --> 01:24:50,886
We gotta get him out of here...

1271
01:24:50,986 --> 01:24:53,186
and make it look like
he died at his house, alone.

1272
01:24:54,287 --> 01:24:55,287
Room service.

1273
01:24:58,187 --> 01:24:59,687
Let's get him to the bedroom.

1274
01:25:02,087 --> 01:25:03,886
Ok...

1275
01:25:03,887 --> 01:25:04,887
too far.

1276
01:25:06,087 --> 01:25:07,587
Uh, balcony?

1277
01:25:12,587 --> 01:25:13,686
Oh, just--

1278
01:25:13,687 --> 01:25:15,887
just hold him.
I'll be right back.

1279
01:25:25,288 --> 01:25:26,788
Champagne and oysters.

1280
01:25:28,288 --> 01:25:29,188
All this just for you?

1281
01:25:29,288 --> 01:25:30,387
Oh, yes.

1282
01:25:30,388 --> 01:25:32,087
I mean, someone is joining me.

1283
01:25:32,088 --> 01:25:33,087
I'll open the champagne.

1284
01:25:33,088 --> 01:25:34,887
That's all right.
I'll take care of it.

1285
01:25:34,888 --> 01:25:36,387
Thank you.
It's, uh...

1286
01:25:36,389 --> 01:25:38,889
tip's included when
it's paid for, good night.

1287
01:25:43,889 --> 01:25:45,389
Aah!

1288
01:25:50,789 --> 01:25:52,588
I ask you to do
one simple thing.

1289
01:25:52,589 --> 01:25:56,088
Oh, I don't consider holding
a 500-pound corpse simple.

1290
01:25:56,089 --> 01:25:57,588
Ok, if you hadn't
flung open the door--

1291
01:25:57,590 --> 01:25:59,190
I didn't fling it!

1292
01:25:59,290 --> 01:26:01,589
Look, we just have to get
the body back to the house...

1293
01:26:01,590 --> 01:26:03,190
and everything will be fine.

1294
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:05,489
Have you seen her?

1295
01:26:05,490 --> 01:26:07,489
Dean.

1296
01:26:07,490 --> 01:26:09,090
Shit!

1297
01:26:09,190 --> 01:26:10,190
Angela!

1298
01:26:10,290 --> 01:26:11,790
I'll meet you by Tensy
in 5 minutes.

1299
01:26:11,890 --> 01:26:13,990
- He looks really pissed.
- I'll handle him. Go!

1300
01:26:28,191 --> 01:26:29,191
Oh, god.

1301
01:26:30,191 --> 01:26:31,591
Angela, stop!

1302
01:26:36,591 --> 01:26:38,590
I have missed you
so much! So much!

1303
01:26:38,591 --> 01:26:39,890
I can't stop
thinking about you.

1304
01:26:39,892 --> 01:26:41,191
I've never been so
in love with anybody...

1305
01:26:41,192 --> 01:26:42,292
in my whole, entire life.

1306
01:26:42,392 --> 01:26:44,192
I'm begging you, please.

1307
01:26:44,292 --> 01:26:45,391
Please, just give me
one more chance.

1308
01:26:45,392 --> 01:26:48,391
One more chance.
Marry me again.

1309
01:26:48,392 --> 01:26:49,891
What?

1310
01:26:49,892 --> 01:26:51,492
Get up.

1311
01:26:51,592 --> 01:26:53,192
How'd you find me?

1312
01:26:53,292 --> 01:26:54,492
The title for
the Mercedes came through.

1313
01:26:54,592 --> 01:26:55,791
It listed this place
as your temporary address.

1314
01:26:55,792 --> 01:26:57,992
I drove straight through
just so I could see you.

1315
01:26:58,092 --> 01:27:00,391
Your hair's different.
It looks really pretty.

1316
01:27:00,392 --> 01:27:01,891
I like it.
Come here, give me a kiss.

1317
01:27:01,893 --> 01:27:02,993
No.

1318
01:27:03,093 --> 01:27:04,493
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Angela, I've changed.

1319
01:27:04,593 --> 01:27:05,793
I've totally changed.

1320
01:27:05,893 --> 01:27:06,793
Look, look, look.

1321
01:27:06,893 --> 01:27:08,092
This place is crawling
with prime trim.

1322
01:27:08,093 --> 01:27:09,292
I'm barely even noticing.

1323
01:27:09,293 --> 01:27:11,493
I...can't deal
with this right now.

1324
01:27:11,593 --> 01:27:12,993
No, no, no.
Angela, listen to me.

1325
01:27:13,093 --> 01:27:14,392
I'm not leaving without you.

1326
01:27:14,393 --> 01:27:15,493
I love you...

1327
01:27:15,593 --> 01:27:16,993
and I don't care
who hears it.

1328
01:27:17,093 --> 01:27:19,892
I love her. I love her.
I love her. I love her!

1329
01:27:19,893 --> 01:27:20,892
What do you want
me to do?

1330
01:27:20,893 --> 01:27:22,493
I--I'll sing.
You want me to sing?

1331
01:27:22,594 --> 01:27:24,193
Come fly with me

1332
01:27:24,194 --> 01:27:26,693
Come fly, come fly

1333
01:27:26,694 --> 01:27:28,393
Shut up!

1334
01:27:28,394 --> 01:27:30,694
What do you want, baby?
I'll do anything.

1335
01:27:32,594 --> 01:27:33,594
Anything?

1336
01:27:34,994 --> 01:27:37,594
I had no idea
you were into this stuff.

1337
01:27:39,294 --> 01:27:43,494
I've been trying a lot
of new things lately.

1338
01:27:43,595 --> 01:27:44,695
Oh, no, no.
Wait, wait.

1339
01:27:44,795 --> 01:27:46,395
I don't know about that.

1340
01:27:46,495 --> 01:27:49,195
Are you questioning me?

1341
01:27:49,295 --> 01:27:51,695
No. No, no, no. It's just--

1342
01:27:52,795 --> 01:27:55,295
Kiss my foot and apologize.

1343
01:27:58,395 --> 01:27:59,395
I'm sorry.

1344
01:28:00,895 --> 01:28:02,195
Good boy.

1345
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:06,896
Ooh, yes.

1346
01:28:09,496 --> 01:28:15,696
Now, I'm just gonna
get some whipped cream.

1347
01:28:17,996 --> 01:28:20,996
I got no problem with that.

1348
01:28:21,796 --> 01:28:24,196
I'll be right back.

1349
01:28:27,497 --> 01:28:28,497
Hurry up.

1350
01:28:39,197 --> 01:28:42,096
Careful, we don't want
any more damage to the body.

1351
01:28:42,097 --> 01:28:43,497
Yeah.

1352
01:28:45,998 --> 01:28:46,997
Housekeeping!

1353
01:28:46,998 --> 01:28:47,998
You want your bed
turned down?

1354
01:28:49,998 --> 01:28:51,898
Housekeeping.

1355
01:28:56,098 --> 01:28:57,897
Look. I don't need anything.

1356
01:28:57,898 --> 01:28:59,198
Please, just get lost.

1357
01:29:00,998 --> 01:29:02,998
Lady!

1358
01:29:03,098 --> 01:29:04,897
You know,
I've been cleaning...

1359
01:29:04,898 --> 01:29:08,097
this room for 3 weeks,
and so far, no tip.

1360
01:29:08,099 --> 01:29:09,798
Fine. There's 20 bucks
in my pants over there.

1361
01:29:09,799 --> 01:29:10,999
20?

1362
01:29:11,099 --> 01:29:12,699
How about I sit
on your kinky face

1363
01:29:12,799 --> 01:29:14,499
for a while... while
you think about that.

1364
01:29:14,599 --> 01:29:17,599
OK, OK, OK. 50!

1365
01:29:17,699 --> 01:29:19,499
That's more like it.

1366
01:29:20,399 --> 01:29:21,999
Unbelievable.

1367
01:29:26,399 --> 01:29:28,099
Both of these
wallets yours?

1368
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,500
Two wallets?

1369
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:32,500
Untie me.

1370
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:34,900
Now, that'll be another 20.

1371
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:40,399
All right.
He's sleeping.

1372
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:41,399
He wakes up having...

1373
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:43,099
one of his famous
coughing fits...

1374
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:45,900
flails around and falls
right onto the statue...

1375
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,099
becoming penilely impaled.

1376
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:49,900
That's believable, right?

1377
01:29:50,001 --> 01:29:51,801
I just really need
a shower.

1378
01:29:53,901 --> 01:29:54,900
Where's the penis?

1379
01:29:54,901 --> 01:29:55,900
It's still there.

1380
01:29:55,901 --> 01:29:56,900
It's just the rigor
mortis is gone...

1381
01:29:56,901 --> 01:29:57,901
so there's no wood.

1382
01:29:58,001 --> 01:30:00,300
Not his, the statue's.

1383
01:30:00,301 --> 01:30:01,300
Oh. It's still
in the car.

1384
01:30:01,301 --> 01:30:03,401
I'll get it.
There you go.

1385
01:30:38,803 --> 01:30:40,903
Oh, this is--

1386
01:30:42,003 --> 01:30:43,402
This is unbelievable.

1387
01:30:43,403 --> 01:30:46,403
Oh. Oh, God.

1388
01:30:48,603 --> 01:30:51,803
Oh, God.
You are so enormous.

1389
01:30:51,903 --> 01:30:52,903
OK.

1390
01:30:54,604 --> 01:30:56,104
Oh, God, please.

1391
01:30:59,704 --> 01:31:01,603
You gold-digging whore.

1392
01:31:01,604 --> 01:31:03,403
You're already working
someone else, huh?

1393
01:31:03,404 --> 01:31:04,903
Get off of her, asshole.

1394
01:31:04,904 --> 01:31:06,403
Get off, asshole.

1395
01:31:06,404 --> 01:31:08,703
- Don't shoot him, Dean.
- Why not?

1396
01:31:08,704 --> 01:31:10,204
Because he's already dead.

1397
01:31:11,704 --> 01:31:14,004
Oh, you are one sick slut.

1398
01:31:14,105 --> 01:31:17,305
I am not a sick slut.

1399
01:31:17,405 --> 01:31:19,704
One penis coming up, mom.

1400
01:31:19,705 --> 01:31:20,904
Wendy?

1401
01:31:20,905 --> 01:31:22,905
Uh, hello.

1402
01:31:25,305 --> 01:31:26,305
Mom?

1403
01:31:28,505 --> 01:31:29,405
You're her mother?

1404
01:31:29,505 --> 01:31:31,305
It's just a nickname.

1405
01:31:31,405 --> 01:31:33,105
Oh, my God.

1406
01:31:34,806 --> 01:31:37,105
Oh, my god.

1407
01:31:37,106 --> 01:31:38,206
You two played me.

1408
01:31:38,306 --> 01:31:40,706
Oh, no. No.

1409
01:31:40,806 --> 01:31:43,206
That whole marriage
was bullshit...

1410
01:31:43,306 --> 01:31:45,005
and this one you even offed!

1411
01:31:45,006 --> 01:31:46,905
We didn't off him.

1412
01:31:46,906 --> 01:31:49,906
He coughed himself
to death.

1413
01:31:50,006 --> 01:31:50,906
Yeah, right.

1414
01:31:51,006 --> 01:31:53,605
You let your
own daughter seduce me?

1415
01:31:53,606 --> 01:31:54,605
Do you have any idea...

1416
01:31:54,606 --> 01:31:56,205
how much therapy
you people need?

1417
01:31:56,207 --> 01:31:58,406
Look, Dean.

1418
01:31:58,407 --> 01:32:01,106
I don't blame you
for being upset.

1419
01:32:01,107 --> 01:32:02,806
We did an awful thing.

1420
01:32:02,807 --> 01:32:07,307
For the first time,
I feel really bad about it...

1421
01:32:07,407 --> 01:32:11,206
but maybe, despite
all this craziness...

1422
01:32:11,207 --> 01:32:13,807
there's still hope
for us after all?

1423
01:32:13,907 --> 01:32:16,007
There's more hope for you
and him than there is for us.

1424
01:32:16,107 --> 01:32:18,807
Dean, please
tell me it's OK.

1425
01:32:18,908 --> 01:32:20,407
I love you.

1426
01:32:20,408 --> 01:32:21,508
Forget it.

1427
01:32:21,608 --> 01:32:22,607
Fine!

1428
01:32:22,608 --> 01:32:24,307
Look. You brought
this on yourself.

1429
01:32:24,308 --> 01:32:27,407
- You cheated on me.
- You set me up to cheat!

1430
01:32:27,408 --> 01:32:28,508
We can't make a scumbag...

1431
01:32:28,608 --> 01:32:30,207
do anything a scumbag
wouldn't do anyway.

1432
01:32:30,208 --> 01:32:32,608
Shut up, junior slut.
Get over there.

1433
01:32:34,208 --> 01:32:36,407
You know, you two
got some brass balls...

1434
01:32:36,408 --> 01:32:38,008
in those panties,
I'll give you that.

1435
01:32:39,309 --> 01:32:42,509
In the few moments
you have left...

1436
01:32:42,609 --> 01:32:46,508
Ii want to see some begging
and some pleading.

1437
01:32:46,509 --> 01:32:49,208
Uh, Mom?

1438
01:32:49,209 --> 01:32:53,608
Dean, you got so many tells.

1439
01:32:53,609 --> 01:32:56,408
You are not the killing type.

1440
01:32:56,409 --> 01:32:59,009
Don't screw with me.
I'm on a fine edge here.

1441
01:32:59,110 --> 01:33:00,410
Don't!

1442
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:05,510
See? No bullets.

1443
01:33:05,610 --> 01:33:08,310
Fine. So I'm not
that big on homicide...

1444
01:33:08,410 --> 01:33:09,810
but I could do worse.

1445
01:33:09,910 --> 01:33:13,209
I found all your I.D.s,
all your aliases...

1446
01:33:13,210 --> 01:33:14,409
and I'm gonna
get them to the cops...

1447
01:33:14,410 --> 01:33:17,010
when they start investigating
decomposing boy, here.

1448
01:33:17,110 --> 01:33:20,110
You two are gonna dry up
in some filthy lesbo lockdown...

1449
01:33:20,211 --> 01:33:21,711
with bad lighting!

1450
01:33:23,011 --> 01:33:25,011
I don't have to kill you
to kill you.

1451
01:33:25,111 --> 01:33:26,811
No.

1452
01:33:26,911 --> 01:33:29,210
Dean, wait!

1453
01:33:29,211 --> 01:33:31,411
Look. What if we gave
you back your money?

1454
01:33:33,411 --> 01:33:34,811
Well?

1455
01:33:36,111 --> 01:33:37,611
I stopped walking, didn't I?

1456
01:33:37,711 --> 01:33:39,211
But first
you got to help us...

1457
01:33:39,311 --> 01:33:41,211
make it look like
this creep died here...

1458
01:33:41,312 --> 01:33:42,712
alone and peaceful...

1459
01:33:42,812 --> 01:33:44,512
so there's no questions.

1460
01:33:44,612 --> 01:33:45,712
You know how to do that?

1461
01:33:45,812 --> 01:33:46,912
I'm from Jersey, aren't I?

1462
01:33:49,612 --> 01:33:53,012
Boy, Dean was really
incredible with that body.

1463
01:33:53,112 --> 01:33:56,811
Well, are you gonna
let me in on the play?

1464
01:33:56,812 --> 01:33:57,911
What play?

1465
01:33:57,912 --> 01:34:00,111
You promised
that mook 300,000.

1466
01:34:00,112 --> 01:34:01,411
When we take him
to the bank tomorrow...

1467
01:34:01,412 --> 01:34:05,011
we're only gonna be,
oh, about 300,000 short.

1468
01:34:05,013 --> 01:34:07,612
- The money will be there.
- What?

1469
01:34:07,613 --> 01:34:09,712
I don't want a big
scene about this, Page...

1470
01:34:09,713 --> 01:34:12,012
but Mrs. Vogal from the I.R.S.

1471
01:34:12,013 --> 01:34:14,613
Was more of a "protecting you
from making the worst mistake...

1472
01:34:14,713 --> 01:34:16,012
of your life" thing
than it was...

1473
01:34:16,013 --> 01:34:19,113
a "the government came
and took all our money" thing.

1474
01:34:20,213 --> 01:34:23,212
- What?
- I pulled a tiny little con...

1475
01:34:23,214 --> 01:34:24,713
to keep you from leaving.

1476
01:34:24,714 --> 01:34:27,413
Oh, you bitch!
You bitch!

1477
01:34:27,414 --> 01:34:29,713
Hey, look, wait!

1478
01:34:29,714 --> 01:34:32,213
Stop it.
You're gonna kill us!

1479
01:34:32,214 --> 01:34:33,414
Stop it!

1480
01:34:36,614 --> 01:34:39,814
There seems to be a problem with
your account, Ms. Conners.

1481
01:34:39,914 --> 01:34:41,814
It was closed yesterday.

1482
01:34:41,914 --> 01:34:44,413
That's impossible.

1483
01:34:44,415 --> 01:34:45,414
What the hell is going on?

1484
01:34:45,415 --> 01:34:46,914
Nothing, I swear.

1485
01:34:46,915 --> 01:34:48,715
Here's the signature.

1486
01:34:52,215 --> 01:34:53,415
Barbara.

1487
01:34:53,515 --> 01:34:56,515
Wait!

1488
01:34:56,615 --> 01:34:59,115
I gave my old partner
all my account numbers...

1489
01:34:59,215 --> 01:35:00,414
for the I.R.S. Scam...

1490
01:35:00,415 --> 01:35:03,315
and that hag ripped off
every penny we ever stole!

1491
01:35:03,415 --> 01:35:05,214
Tell your fairy tales
to your cellmates.

1492
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:07,515
Look. For once,
she's telling the truth.

1493
01:35:07,516 --> 01:35:09,216
And I'm gonna believe
the seed of Satan?

1494
01:35:09,316 --> 01:35:11,816
Skank, give me
the keys to my car.

1495
01:35:11,916 --> 01:35:13,015
Give me the keys
to the Mercedes.

1496
01:35:13,016 --> 01:35:15,016
That's it.
Good-bye.

1497
01:35:17,916 --> 01:35:19,715
I can't believe it.

1498
01:35:19,716 --> 01:35:20,815
I can't believe this.

1499
01:35:20,816 --> 01:35:23,015
I've blown both our lives.

1500
01:35:23,016 --> 01:35:25,016
I'm sorry, Page.

1501
01:35:25,116 --> 01:35:26,815
I'm a terrible person.

1502
01:35:26,817 --> 01:35:28,517
I'm a terrible mother.

1503
01:35:30,917 --> 01:35:32,417
I'm a terrible everything.

1504
01:35:41,917 --> 01:35:44,217
You're finally
seeing things clearly.

1505
01:35:55,318 --> 01:35:56,518
What the hell
are you doing?

1506
01:35:58,318 --> 01:35:59,218
You want money?

1507
01:35:59,318 --> 01:36:02,818
The guy who wants to marry me is
worth 1.5 in a divorce.

1508
01:36:27,219 --> 01:36:29,018
She's just gonna
screw with him again.

1509
01:36:29,019 --> 01:36:30,419
Hugely.

1510
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:33,019
I'm sorry.
I was just wondering...

1511
01:36:33,020 --> 01:36:34,919
how long you're
gonna stay this time.

1512
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:35,919
Look.

1513
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:37,519
I know that
I've been horrible...

1514
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:40,119
but all this talk
about love and marriage...

1515
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:43,319
it can make anyone act freaky.

1516
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:47,820
I know that I must seem
like a mean, selfish bitch...

1517
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:50,219
No, you seem like
the sweetest...

1518
01:36:50,220 --> 01:36:52,520
most wonderful person
I've ever met.

1519
01:36:53,621 --> 01:36:55,121
What a moron.

1520
01:36:56,621 --> 01:36:58,220
Friends...

1521
01:36:58,221 --> 01:36:59,720
employees...

1522
01:36:59,721 --> 01:37:01,821
beer wholesaler...

1523
01:37:01,921 --> 01:37:03,521
I have an announcement.

1524
01:37:05,021 --> 01:37:07,121
Jane and I
are getting married.

1525
01:37:09,421 --> 01:37:11,220
That is awesome!

1526
01:37:11,221 --> 01:37:12,221
Yeah!

1527
01:37:13,722 --> 01:37:15,421
Jane, come here.

1528
01:37:15,422 --> 01:37:19,122
So, uh, Jack,
now that you have some, uh...

1529
01:37:19,222 --> 01:37:21,221
extra responsibilities,
that doesn't mean...

1530
01:37:21,222 --> 01:37:23,621
you're gonna change your mind
and sell this place, does it?

1531
01:37:23,622 --> 01:37:25,622
No, we'll do just fine.

1532
01:37:28,322 --> 01:37:29,322
Thanks, man.

1533
01:37:32,022 --> 01:37:33,321
Sell what, honey?

1534
01:37:33,323 --> 01:37:35,123
Oh, nothing.
Just some guys offered me...

1535
01:37:35,223 --> 01:37:36,922
3 million for the bar
and the land.

1536
01:37:36,923 --> 01:37:37,922
3 million?

1537
01:37:37,923 --> 01:37:39,823
That sounds like something.

1538
01:37:39,923 --> 01:37:42,822
Well, yeah,
but this place was my dad's.

1539
01:37:42,823 --> 01:37:44,522
You know, it's home.

1540
01:37:44,523 --> 01:37:45,522
It's too late, anyway.

1541
01:37:45,523 --> 01:37:46,723
They got another lot
down the road.

1542
01:37:52,923 --> 01:37:54,422
There's no money.
I'm bailing.

1543
01:37:54,424 --> 01:37:55,523
No. Wait!
You can still get...

1544
01:37:55,524 --> 01:37:57,323
a decent settlement
out of this guy.

1545
01:37:57,324 --> 01:37:58,324
He'll lose the bar.

1546
01:37:58,424 --> 01:37:59,924
This is wrong.
It's over.

1547
01:38:00,024 --> 01:38:01,223
What the hell
is your daughter doing...

1548
01:38:01,224 --> 01:38:02,523
growing a conscience
on my score?

1549
01:38:02,524 --> 01:38:03,823
Don't make her do this.

1550
01:38:03,824 --> 01:38:05,723
I'll figure a way
to get you your money.

1551
01:38:05,724 --> 01:38:07,324
No. I'm tired of waiting.
We're doing it.

1552
01:38:08,324 --> 01:38:10,823
May I have this dance?

1553
01:38:10,824 --> 01:38:13,124
I--Jack.

1554
01:38:14,124 --> 01:38:15,123
Uh-oh.

1555
01:38:15,125 --> 01:38:17,625
- You gotta go.
- I gotta go.

1556
01:38:23,525 --> 01:38:25,124
Is that who
I think it is?

1557
01:38:25,125 --> 01:38:26,124
Jane!

1558
01:38:26,125 --> 01:38:28,125
It is. How are you, darling?

1559
01:38:28,225 --> 01:38:29,625
Pissed off.

1560
01:38:29,725 --> 01:38:31,325
We were just on our way
to see you at the hotel...

1561
01:38:31,425 --> 01:38:32,325
but we thought
we'd stop by here...

1562
01:38:32,425 --> 01:38:33,325
for a drink.

1563
01:38:33,425 --> 01:38:34,824
Hi.

1564
01:38:34,825 --> 01:38:36,724
This isn't Jack, is it?

1565
01:38:36,726 --> 01:38:39,225
Jane is always going
on and on about you.

1566
01:38:39,226 --> 01:38:41,225
I think she's in love!

1567
01:38:41,226 --> 01:38:43,826
I'm Betty,
Jane's second cousin...

1568
01:38:43,926 --> 01:38:46,026
and this is my brother.

1569
01:38:46,126 --> 01:38:48,025
Vinny--Vinny Staggliano.

1570
01:38:48,026 --> 01:38:50,826
I'm afraid you caught us
at a weird time.

1571
01:38:50,926 --> 01:38:53,225
I just asked Jane
to marry me, and--

1572
01:38:53,226 --> 01:38:54,725
Oh! That's great!

1573
01:38:54,726 --> 01:38:56,025
Congratulations.

1574
01:38:56,026 --> 01:38:58,225
Actually, I think she's having
second thoughts.

1575
01:38:58,227 --> 01:39:00,226
That's just the way our Jane is.

1576
01:39:00,227 --> 01:39:01,526
Yeah, but she gets
over it, though...

1577
01:39:01,527 --> 01:39:04,226
especially now that family's
here to give her a little shove.

1578
01:39:04,227 --> 01:39:05,226
Come on, you two...

1579
01:39:05,227 --> 01:39:06,327
why don't you
kiss and make up?

1580
01:39:06,427 --> 01:39:09,027
- I'm not really in the mood.
- Go on. Kiss.

1581
01:39:09,127 --> 01:39:11,827
That's nice.
There you go.

1582
01:39:13,627 --> 01:39:15,926
I think your relatives
are gonna like Bill's boat.

1583
01:39:15,927 --> 01:39:17,827
Who cares what they like?

1584
01:39:17,927 --> 01:39:19,227
Nice boat.

1585
01:39:23,928 --> 01:39:26,927
Ooh! Oh, oh!

1586
01:39:26,928 --> 01:39:28,427
I'm so sorry.

1587
01:39:28,428 --> 01:39:29,928
I'm so clumsy.

1588
01:39:31,728 --> 01:39:32,828
That's OK.

1589
01:39:34,028 --> 01:39:35,727
How you doing, Skippy?

1590
01:39:35,728 --> 01:39:36,927
Hey.

1591
01:39:36,928 --> 01:39:38,227
Hey, you.

1592
01:39:38,228 --> 01:39:40,427
I got the lotion.

1593
01:39:40,429 --> 01:39:42,328
Who's got the hands?

1594
01:39:42,329 --> 01:39:43,529
Don't look at me.

1595
01:39:43,629 --> 01:39:45,029
I don't like getting
all gunky.

1596
01:39:45,129 --> 01:39:48,229
Jack, would you mind?

1597
01:39:48,329 --> 01:39:49,229
Sure.

1598
01:39:52,329 --> 01:39:56,229
You are the most kind,
wonderful man.

1599
01:39:58,529 --> 01:40:00,429
Look at all the fish!

1600
01:40:06,630 --> 01:40:08,029
Got it.

1601
01:40:08,030 --> 01:40:09,330
This is gonna be a fun trip.

1602
01:40:15,430 --> 01:40:16,729
I honestly don't know why...

1603
01:40:16,730 --> 01:40:19,029
you'd want to wear
an off-the-shoulder.

1604
01:40:19,030 --> 01:40:20,930
This is what I want,
and it looks fine.

1605
01:40:21,030 --> 01:40:23,229
Fine.
What would I know?

1606
01:40:23,231 --> 01:40:26,530
I've only been married
13 times.

1607
01:40:26,531 --> 01:40:28,731
All right, I'm coming out.
You better be nice.

1608
01:40:28,831 --> 01:40:30,531
I'm always nice.

1609
01:40:39,831 --> 01:40:40,831
What's wrong?

1610
01:40:43,232 --> 01:40:44,931
Nothing.

1611
01:40:44,932 --> 01:40:47,231
Fine. If you're
gonna be sarcastic.

1612
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:49,732
I'm not being sarcastic.

1613
01:40:51,932 --> 01:40:53,431
It's perfect.

1614
01:40:53,432 --> 01:40:55,032
Really?

1615
01:40:55,132 --> 01:40:57,132
There's nothing
you would change?

1616
01:40:58,232 --> 01:40:59,831
Not a thing.

1617
01:40:59,832 --> 01:41:01,631
Oh, my god.

1618
01:41:01,632 --> 01:41:02,832
Well, I might just...

1619
01:41:02,932 --> 01:41:05,832
see what it looks like
without this in here.

1620
01:41:07,533 --> 01:41:08,733
I take it back.

1621
01:41:10,033 --> 01:41:14,232
No. No.
I...like that idea.

1622
01:41:14,233 --> 01:41:15,332
So...

1623
01:41:15,333 --> 01:41:16,733
Mother likes it?

1624
01:41:16,833 --> 01:41:19,333
- Oh, I'm not...
- she's not my mother.

1625
01:41:39,734 --> 01:41:41,333
You really are good at this.

1626
01:41:41,334 --> 01:41:42,833
I'm almost buying it.

1627
01:41:42,834 --> 01:41:44,334
Ladies and gentlemen...

1628
01:41:44,434 --> 01:41:46,233
friends and family...

1629
01:41:46,235 --> 01:41:47,934
we have come here today...

1630
01:41:47,935 --> 01:41:50,734
to celebrate
two wonderful people...

1631
01:41:50,735 --> 01:41:52,934
who have managed
to find each other...

1632
01:41:52,935 --> 01:41:56,234
in this sometimes
seemingly cold world...

1633
01:41:56,235 --> 01:41:58,035
and pledge their hearts.

1634
01:41:59,735 --> 01:42:01,735
Do you, Jack Withrowe...

1635
01:42:01,835 --> 01:42:04,734
take this woman to be
your lawful wedded wife...

1636
01:42:04,735 --> 01:42:07,334
to love her, honor her,
and cherish her...

1637
01:42:07,336 --> 01:42:09,136
until death do you part?

1638
01:42:09,236 --> 01:42:11,136
I do.

1639
01:42:11,236 --> 01:42:13,736
And do you, Jane helstrom...

1640
01:42:13,836 --> 01:42:16,836
take this man to be your
lawful wedded husband...

1641
01:42:16,936 --> 01:42:19,536
to love, honor,
and to cherish him...

1642
01:42:19,636 --> 01:42:22,336
until death do you part?

1643
01:42:25,436 --> 01:42:27,136
I do.

1644
01:42:28,137 --> 01:42:29,337
What?

1645
01:42:32,237 --> 01:42:33,837
I do.

1646
01:42:35,337 --> 01:42:37,537
I now pronounce you
husband and wife...

1647
01:42:37,637 --> 01:42:39,037
and you may kiss the bride.

1648
01:42:46,037 --> 01:42:48,036
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give to you...

1649
01:42:48,037 --> 01:42:49,837
- Mr. And Mrs. Withrowe.
- Shut up.

1650
01:42:51,038 --> 01:42:55,338
Wise men say

1651
01:42:56,338 --> 01:43:01,238
Only fools rush in

1652
01:43:03,138 --> 01:43:08,037
But I can't help

1653
01:43:08,038 --> 01:43:13,838
Falling in love with you...

1654
01:43:14,839 --> 01:43:15,838
Here.

1655
01:43:15,839 --> 01:43:17,738
Make sure he sees
you drinking a lot.

1656
01:43:17,739 --> 01:43:18,939
That won't be hard.

1657
01:43:22,039 --> 01:43:25,438
There's my wonderful new
daughter-in-law.

1658
01:43:25,439 --> 01:43:27,039
Are you avoiding me?

1659
01:43:27,139 --> 01:43:28,339
Uh, no.

1660
01:43:28,439 --> 01:43:30,339
I gotta go.

1661
01:43:32,140 --> 01:43:33,640
Don't let it bother you.

1662
01:43:33,740 --> 01:43:36,339
She's shyer than shit.

1663
01:43:36,340 --> 01:43:39,640
Uh, what is it you do,
Mr. Staggliano?

1664
01:43:41,140 --> 01:43:43,040
College professor.

1665
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:45,840
Uh, what do you teach?

1666
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:48,240
College stuff.

1667
01:43:48,340 --> 01:43:50,439
What are you,
a fucking cop?

1668
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:52,840
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1669
01:43:54,941 --> 01:43:56,740
I'll only need 30 minutes.

1670
01:43:56,741 --> 01:43:59,441
It won't work.
He loves me too much.

1671
01:43:59,541 --> 01:44:01,941
Men don't turn women down.

1672
01:44:21,842 --> 01:44:24,742
Just like our first date,
only less mud.

1673
01:44:24,842 --> 01:44:26,742
It's beautiful.

1674
01:44:33,342 --> 01:44:34,442
Happy?

1675
01:44:38,243 --> 01:44:40,443
Always know just
the right thing to say.

1676
01:44:41,443 --> 01:44:43,142
I love you...

1677
01:44:43,143 --> 01:44:44,243
Jack.

1678
01:44:44,343 --> 01:44:47,643
I love you very much.

1679
01:44:47,743 --> 01:44:49,742
You're different, aren't you?

1680
01:44:49,743 --> 01:44:52,943
I mean, you would never let
anything ruin this, would you?

1681
01:44:53,043 --> 01:44:56,543
Well, sometimes these hotel
soaps irritate my skin.

1682
01:44:57,544 --> 01:44:59,244
I'm serious.

1683
01:45:01,044 --> 01:45:04,044
Say nothing will ruin us.

1684
01:45:05,044 --> 01:45:06,744
Nothing will ever
take me away...

1685
01:45:06,844 --> 01:45:08,844
or keep me
from loving you.

1686
01:45:19,045 --> 01:45:21,545
Can I have some water?

1687
01:45:21,645 --> 01:45:23,345
I think I drank
too much champagne.

1688
01:46:24,048 --> 01:46:26,347
What are you doing
out here alone?

1689
01:46:26,348 --> 01:46:30,547
Oh, my wife celebrated herself
into an early coma.

1690
01:46:30,548 --> 01:46:31,847
Oh.

1691
01:46:31,848 --> 01:46:34,847
Well, her loss is my gain.

1692
01:46:34,848 --> 01:46:36,547
Walk me to my room.

1693
01:46:36,548 --> 01:46:38,047
I have a wedding gift
for you.

1694
01:46:38,048 --> 01:46:39,847
Oh, no, that's ok.
I was just gonna--

1695
01:46:39,848 --> 01:46:40,847
Oh, come on.

1696
01:46:40,849 --> 01:46:43,348
You can't turn down
a wedding gift, you know.

1697
01:46:43,349 --> 01:46:44,648
It's bad luck.

1698
01:46:44,649 --> 01:46:46,649
- I never heard that.
- Sure.

1699
01:46:46,749 --> 01:46:49,549
Everything to do with
weddings is bad luck.

1700
01:46:56,349 --> 01:46:58,849
Uh, I can only stay
a minute.

1701
01:46:59,849 --> 01:47:02,349
Will you just
relax?

1702
01:47:02,450 --> 01:47:04,650
OK? Sit down.

1703
01:47:08,150 --> 01:47:09,950
This hotel is so nice.

1704
01:47:10,050 --> 01:47:11,750
I'm so glad
my brother and I

1705
01:47:11,850 --> 01:47:13,450
decided to stay here, too.

1706
01:47:13,550 --> 01:47:15,450
Uh...yeah.

1707
01:47:15,550 --> 01:47:17,450
It's...

1708
01:47:17,550 --> 01:47:20,650
you, uh--ahem--mentioned
something about a gift?

1709
01:47:23,151 --> 01:47:25,950
You're so greedy.

1710
01:47:25,951 --> 01:47:30,551
But I happen to have it
right...here.

1711
01:47:34,551 --> 01:47:37,650
Cognac! Huh! Wow!

1712
01:47:37,651 --> 01:47:40,150
80 years old.

1713
01:47:40,151 --> 01:47:41,451
Uh, Jane is gonna love this.

1714
01:47:41,551 --> 01:47:42,850
Thank you so much.

1715
01:47:42,851 --> 01:47:45,751
Oh, oh, oh--
can't we just try some?

1716
01:47:45,852 --> 01:47:47,552
Please?

1717
01:47:54,752 --> 01:47:57,052
I thought you might not
want to wait alone.

1718
01:47:59,252 --> 01:48:01,351
Could be wrong. Oh!

1719
01:48:01,352 --> 01:48:03,552
It feels good going down,
doesn't it?

1720
01:48:03,652 --> 01:48:06,852
It's, uh...
it's really good.

1721
01:48:20,153 --> 01:48:21,753
No, thanks. I, uh...

1722
01:48:21,853 --> 01:48:23,452
I should be
getting back to Jane.

1723
01:48:23,453 --> 01:48:25,652
Jack, she's asleep.

1724
01:48:25,653 --> 01:48:27,253
OK? Come on.

1725
01:48:27,354 --> 01:48:28,653
You deserve to have...

1726
01:48:28,654 --> 01:48:30,953
a little bit of fun
on your wedding night.

1727
01:48:30,954 --> 01:48:32,654
It's just fruit.

1728
01:48:40,754 --> 01:48:42,254
It's just a waste of time.

1729
01:48:42,354 --> 01:48:45,353
He's just gonna throw her out
on her ass.

1730
01:48:45,354 --> 01:48:47,054
I'm not worried.

1731
01:48:47,155 --> 01:48:49,855
Is that why you're
melting down the remote?

1732
01:48:52,555 --> 01:48:54,055
Cute.

1733
01:49:06,055 --> 01:49:08,655
You've got a tiny bit
of cream...

1734
01:49:10,256 --> 01:49:11,556
right...

1735
01:49:23,456 --> 01:49:26,555
- I got to go.
- Oh, oh, oh. Why?

1736
01:49:26,556 --> 01:49:28,855
- I just can't do this.
- What's the matter?

1737
01:49:28,856 --> 01:49:33,656
Is it because you don't
find me attractive?

1738
01:49:33,757 --> 01:49:37,556
No, no. A part of me
is very, very interested...

1739
01:49:37,557 --> 01:49:39,356
but the other parts
are yelling...

1740
01:49:39,357 --> 01:49:41,056
"You just married her cousin."

1741
01:49:41,057 --> 01:49:43,657
Jane would never know,
I promise.

1742
01:49:43,757 --> 01:49:45,556
Yeah, but I would.

1743
01:49:45,557 --> 01:49:49,257
I could never do that
to someone I love.

1744
01:49:52,558 --> 01:49:54,857
You really do love her,
don't you?

1745
01:49:54,858 --> 01:49:56,557
Yeah...

1746
01:49:56,558 --> 01:49:59,057
and I really should be
getting back.

1747
01:49:59,058 --> 01:50:01,057
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

1748
01:50:01,058 --> 01:50:02,958
I feel terrible.
Please don't leave like this.

1749
01:50:03,058 --> 01:50:04,658
Can't we just, you know...

1750
01:50:04,758 --> 01:50:07,158
have a make-up drink
or something?

1751
01:50:07,258 --> 01:50:09,258
I'll be good, I promise.

1752
01:50:11,559 --> 01:50:12,659
Please?

1753
01:50:20,759 --> 01:50:22,659
That's it.
I'm going over there.

1754
01:50:22,759 --> 01:50:24,058
No. It isn't time yet.

1755
01:50:24,059 --> 01:50:25,358
I don't care,
you sick shit.

1756
01:50:25,359 --> 01:50:26,958
I can't do this to him.

1757
01:50:26,959 --> 01:50:28,159
You see? It hurts
when you screw around...

1758
01:50:28,259 --> 01:50:29,458
with people's feelings,
doesn't it?

1759
01:50:29,459 --> 01:50:30,859
Not as much as this.

1760
01:50:42,460 --> 01:50:43,860
Oh, my God.

1761
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:45,859
Jane!

1762
01:50:45,860 --> 01:50:47,060
What?

1763
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:50,560
I'm sorry.

1764
01:50:56,461 --> 01:50:58,260
While we are willing to admit...

1765
01:50:58,261 --> 01:51:01,260
some wrongdoing on
the part of my client...

1766
01:51:01,261 --> 01:51:04,360
given the extremely short
duration of the marriage--

1767
01:51:04,361 --> 01:51:05,461
No negotiation.

1768
01:51:05,561 --> 01:51:07,661
Give her whatever she wants.

1769
01:51:09,261 --> 01:51:11,360
We talked about
you not saying that.

1770
01:51:11,361 --> 01:51:13,461
Give her
whatever she wants.

1771
01:51:23,862 --> 01:51:25,462
I don't know what happened.

1772
01:51:25,562 --> 01:51:26,861
It was weird.

1773
01:51:26,862 --> 01:51:28,862
There is only one man
in the world.

1774
01:51:41,563 --> 01:51:43,862
What the hell
is taking so long?

1775
01:51:43,863 --> 01:51:45,862
Oh, relax.
You'll get your money.

1776
01:51:45,863 --> 01:51:48,562
You destroyed my daughter,
but you'll get it.

1777
01:51:48,563 --> 01:51:51,163
Hey, I was standing around
minding my own business...

1778
01:51:51,263 --> 01:51:53,163
when you bitches came along
and ripped out my heart...

1779
01:51:53,263 --> 01:51:54,562
for a game of hacky sack.

1780
01:51:54,563 --> 01:51:56,263
- Don't give me that.
- Come off it.

1781
01:51:56,363 --> 01:51:58,862
We're both the same--scum.

1782
01:51:58,864 --> 01:52:00,563
We are not the same.

1783
01:52:00,564 --> 01:52:03,463
I wasn't lying
when I said "I do."

1784
01:52:03,464 --> 01:52:06,363
No, you were lying
when you tried to nail Page.

1785
01:52:06,364 --> 01:52:09,964
Look. Where I come from,
guys make mistakes sometimes.

1786
01:52:10,064 --> 01:52:12,664
Didn't change the fact
that I loved you.

1787
01:52:14,864 --> 01:52:16,763
I just know
I wouldn't do it again.

1788
01:52:16,764 --> 01:52:21,064
- Because you got caught.
- No, because of what I lost.

1789
01:52:22,165 --> 01:52:25,065
I'm not the only guy in the
world that's ever screwed up.

1790
01:52:25,765 --> 01:52:27,064
Even a goody-goody like Jack

1791
01:52:27,065 --> 01:52:29,064
can't keep his wang
in the hangar.

1792
01:52:29,065 --> 01:52:31,964
- Yes, he can.
- What did you say?

1793
01:52:31,965 --> 01:52:33,064
Nothing.

1794
01:52:33,065 --> 01:52:34,364
No, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1795
01:52:34,365 --> 01:52:35,865
What did you say?

1796
01:52:37,065 --> 01:52:38,565
I micked him.

1797
01:52:39,866 --> 01:52:41,365
Stryctotoxy...

1798
01:52:41,366 --> 01:52:43,065
somewhere
bet ween out and awake.

1799
01:52:43,066 --> 01:52:44,166
It just makes people
easy to handle.

1800
01:52:44,266 --> 01:52:46,165
Whoa. Wait a minute.
You're kidding.

1801
01:52:46,166 --> 01:52:48,866
He said no, and you still
let her believe...

1802
01:52:48,966 --> 01:52:50,166
that he went for a soil sample?

1803
01:52:50,266 --> 01:52:52,865
You know what?
That's a new low, even for you.

1804
01:52:52,866 --> 01:52:54,866
Look. You wanted your money.

1805
01:52:54,966 --> 01:52:56,466
What was I supposed to do...

1806
01:52:56,566 --> 01:52:58,565
tell her the man
you forced us to con...

1807
01:52:58,566 --> 01:53:00,565
was the only decent guy
she ever met?

1808
01:53:00,567 --> 01:53:02,267
But you know what?
This is just too sick.

1809
01:53:02,367 --> 01:53:04,366
I thought this whole revenge
thing was gonna be fun...

1810
01:53:04,367 --> 01:53:06,267
but you've done everything
you can to ruin it.

1811
01:53:06,367 --> 01:53:07,766
I don't even want
this guy's money now.

1812
01:53:07,767 --> 01:53:09,766
- Well, I don't want it, either.
- Well, I'm not taking it!

1813
01:53:09,767 --> 01:53:11,766
- Well, neither am I!
- Well, neither am I!

1814
01:53:11,767 --> 01:53:13,667
- I'll take it.
- What?!

1815
01:53:13,767 --> 01:53:14,966
You said
you didn't want it.

1816
01:53:14,967 --> 01:53:16,867
You should tell
your daughter the truth.

1817
01:53:16,967 --> 01:53:19,967
What for? He's only gonna
end up hurting her anyway.

1818
01:53:20,067 --> 01:53:22,366
She's better off with me, OK?

1819
01:53:22,368 --> 01:53:23,468
I'll protect her.

1820
01:53:23,568 --> 01:53:25,667
From what?
From love?

1821
01:53:25,668 --> 01:53:26,968
From pain.

1822
01:53:27,068 --> 01:53:28,968
Love is pain.
Life is pain.

1823
01:53:29,068 --> 01:53:30,968
You can't protect
anybody from it.

1824
01:53:31,068 --> 01:53:32,667
It's always gonna get you.

1825
01:53:32,668 --> 01:53:34,768
But sometimes,
life can also be good.

1826
01:53:34,868 --> 01:53:37,167
But you got to be open.
You got to take chances.

1827
01:53:37,168 --> 01:53:38,768
You got to let go.

1828
01:53:38,868 --> 01:53:41,167
What self-help guru moron
taught you that?

1829
01:53:41,168 --> 01:53:42,968
Nobody had
to teach me nothing.

1830
01:53:43,069 --> 01:53:44,169
It's common sense.

1831
01:53:44,269 --> 01:53:45,968
And Deepak Chopra
is not a moron.

1832
01:53:45,969 --> 01:53:47,969
I've seen a lot
of crap in my life...

1833
01:53:48,069 --> 01:53:49,969
but the way you're cheating
her out of any chance...

1834
01:53:50,069 --> 01:53:52,169
for a decent future
really sucks.

1835
01:53:53,069 --> 01:53:54,569
Of all the lousy things
you've done...

1836
01:53:54,669 --> 01:53:56,569
you should be most
ashamed of that.

1837
01:53:56,669 --> 01:53:57,869
And what you did to me, too--

1838
01:53:57,969 --> 01:54:00,169
I don't want to completely
leave that out.

1839
01:54:00,869 --> 01:54:02,368
- Here's your money.
- I don't want the money.

1840
01:54:02,369 --> 01:54:04,368
Good luck with
psycho mom here.

1841
01:54:04,370 --> 01:54:06,770
- What was that?
- I took care of it.

1842
01:54:06,870 --> 01:54:09,270
- How?
- I don't want to talk about it.

1843
01:54:09,370 --> 01:54:10,870
Let's just get out
of this goddamn place.

1844
01:54:11,970 --> 01:54:13,069
So...

1845
01:54:13,070 --> 01:54:16,070
where are we going--
Seattle or San Francisco?

1846
01:54:17,170 --> 01:54:19,169
You know, you don't
have to stay with me.

1847
01:54:19,170 --> 01:54:22,169
There's plenty of money for
you to set up on your own...

1848
01:54:22,170 --> 01:54:23,669
and you can have
all of it.

1849
01:54:23,670 --> 01:54:25,469
Thanks, mom.

1850
01:54:25,471 --> 01:54:27,470
You're the only person
in this world...

1851
01:54:27,471 --> 01:54:28,871
I even half-trust.

1852
01:54:35,771 --> 01:54:38,070
- What are you doing?
- Turning around.

1853
01:54:38,071 --> 01:54:39,071
Why?

1854
01:54:40,971 --> 01:54:43,371
- Promise you won't attack me?
- What is it?

1855
01:54:43,471 --> 01:54:44,870
We're traveling
at high speeds.

1856
01:54:44,871 --> 01:54:46,270
It would endanger
both our lives.

1857
01:54:46,272 --> 01:54:47,572
What is it?

1858
01:54:50,172 --> 01:54:53,171
Jack turned me down...

1859
01:54:53,172 --> 01:54:57,672
so I kind of...
I micked him.

1860
01:55:07,373 --> 01:55:10,472
Oh, you are the most evil,
manipulative--

1861
01:55:10,473 --> 01:55:12,773
You're right. I am.

1862
01:55:12,873 --> 01:55:15,472
I've just been so afraid
of losing you...

1863
01:55:15,473 --> 01:55:17,773
or of you getting hurt
like me.

1864
01:55:17,873 --> 01:55:19,472
But I can't protect you.

1865
01:55:19,473 --> 01:55:22,472
I just get you hurt
in different, sickways.

1866
01:55:22,473 --> 01:55:24,172
So you might as well get hurt...

1867
01:55:24,173 --> 01:55:26,172
in your own healthy,
normal ways--

1868
01:55:26,173 --> 01:55:27,773
ways you come up with
on your own...

1869
01:55:27,874 --> 01:55:29,874
and can't blame me for.

1870
01:55:39,674 --> 01:55:43,374
Oh, it's a hug.
I can pull over for a hug.

1871
01:55:51,175 --> 01:55:52,975
Now, don't cry too much.
You'll look like hell...

1872
01:55:53,075 --> 01:55:54,975
when you go back to him, OK?

1873
01:55:55,075 --> 01:55:57,274
You should wear
the blue dress.

1874
01:55:57,275 --> 01:55:59,275
Mom...

1875
01:56:00,375 --> 01:56:02,975
Right.
Wear whatever you want...

1876
01:56:04,475 --> 01:56:06,375
except what you're wearing.

1877
01:56:21,476 --> 01:56:22,976
What are you doing here?

1878
01:56:23,076 --> 01:56:25,376
You know what I'm doing here.

1879
01:56:25,476 --> 01:56:26,776
What, you thought
I'd still want you...

1880
01:56:26,876 --> 01:56:27,776
after what you did to me?

1881
01:56:27,876 --> 01:56:29,676
You don't? OK. Fine.

1882
01:56:29,776 --> 01:56:32,276
All right, wait, wait.
OK. OK. Fine.

1883
01:56:32,377 --> 01:56:36,177
- So I still want you.
- No kidding.

1884
01:56:39,477 --> 01:56:42,176
But don't you ever
cheat on me again.

1885
01:56:42,177 --> 01:56:44,776
- Ever. Ever!
- OK. Fine!

1886
01:56:44,777 --> 01:56:45,776
I mean it.

1887
01:56:45,777 --> 01:56:46,777
Because if one day...

1888
01:56:46,877 --> 01:56:48,277
you happen to notice
some gorgeous girl

1889
01:56:48,377 --> 01:56:50,176
giving you that
"Let's screw around" look...

1890
01:56:50,177 --> 01:56:54,477
just remember,
she may be working for me.

1891
01:56:55,878 --> 01:56:56,978
All right. Fine.

1892
01:56:57,078 --> 01:56:58,277
But you?

1893
01:56:58,278 --> 01:57:00,978
No more conning.
No more.

1894
01:57:01,078 --> 01:57:02,477
If you're gonna be my wife...

1895
01:57:02,478 --> 01:57:04,078
you've got to live
a respectable life...

1896
01:57:04,178 --> 01:57:05,778
chopping cars.

1897
01:57:07,478 --> 01:57:09,577
First you got to help me
with one thing.

1898
01:57:09,578 --> 01:57:11,478
Well, first you got
to help me with one thing.

1899
01:57:26,179 --> 01:57:28,979
You're not gonna fall asleep
on me again, are you?

1900
01:57:29,079 --> 01:57:30,979
I feel pretty good
about tonight.

1901
01:57:42,280 --> 01:57:43,980
Look. I don't
want to go in there.

1902
01:57:44,080 --> 01:57:45,279
The bank owns it now.

1903
01:57:45,280 --> 01:57:46,780
There's still some stuff
they said you left.

1904
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:48,480
I cleared out everything.

1905
01:57:57,481 --> 01:57:59,481
Surprise!

1906
01:58:34,082 --> 01:58:37,982
- How?
- My name is Page.

1907
01:58:54,483 --> 01:58:56,783
I never realized
I could feel this way again...

1908
01:58:56,883 --> 01:58:59,683
that I could be so totally
in love with someone.

1909
01:59:01,484 --> 01:59:03,884
I feel the same way, Stanley.

1910
01:59:08,584 --> 01:59:11,384
- You're beautiful.
- Thank you.
