1
00:01:00,377 --> 00:01:01,562
"<i>This is where I live</i>."

2
00:01:02,171 --> 00:01:03,287
"<i>I'm a housewife</i>."

3
00:01:03,827 --> 00:01:05,165
"<i>My name is Ellen Jones</i>."

4
00:01:06,008 --> 00:01:08,023
"<i>That Tuesday in July started out</i> .."

5
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:10,596
"<i>Just like any other day
the past few months</i>."

6
00:01:11,686 --> 00:01:15,101
"<i>There was no warning it was to be
the most terrifying day of my life</i>."

7
00:01:16,737 --> 00:01:18,919
"<i>I remember thinking how tired I felt</i>."

8
00:01:19,456 --> 00:01:21,149
"<i>Even the housework seemed drudgery</i>."

9
00:01:21,756 --> 00:01:24,154
"<i>So meaningless with
George confined to his bed</i>."

10
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:26,607
"<i>No-one to see or care even</i>."

11
00:01:27,881 --> 00:01:29,068
"<i>And then I got scared</i>."

12
00:01:29,921 --> 00:01:32,524
"<i>Because I knew I was beginning
to feel sorry for myself</i>."

13
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:35,306
"<i>George was the one who was ill</i>."

14
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,923
"<i>And he needed all of my
thoughts and attention</i>."

15
00:01:38,538 --> 00:01:39,954
"<i>And above all my cheerfulness</i>."

16
00:01:41,139 --> 00:01:43,528
"<i>I tried not to think about us.
About George</i>."

17
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:45,371
"<i>How he had changed</i>."

18
00:01:46,205 --> 00:01:48,317
"<i>I told myself it was
just my imagination</i>."

19
00:01:48,632 --> 00:01:51,568
"<i>That things would be different
when he was well and strong again</i>."

20
00:01:52,707 --> 00:01:54,180
"<i>Then I thought I heard him call</i>."

21
00:01:58,074 --> 00:02:00,104
George. Did you call?

22
00:02:02,598 --> 00:02:04,373
George. Are you alright?

23
00:02:06,687 --> 00:02:07,532
Yes, Ellen.

24
00:02:08,048 --> 00:02:09,241
Do you want anything?

25
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:13,615
Not now. I've just begun work on
an insurance report for the office.

26
00:02:14,774 --> 00:02:17,476
Well, call me dear if you need me.
- Okay.

27
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:42,694
"<i>Somehow, I had an odd feeling</i>."

28
00:02:43,473 --> 00:02:45,262
"<i>There was something
about George's voice</i>."

29
00:02:46,797 --> 00:02:49,687
"<i>I found myself thinking
about the first time we met</i>."

30
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,727
"<i>How different he was in those days</i>."

31
00:02:53,802 --> 00:02:55,933
"<i>I remember I was sitting
in Dr Grahame's office</i>."

32
00:02:56,421 --> 00:02:57,436
"<i>We were talking</i>."

33
00:02:57,783 --> 00:03:00,298
I played one game of checkers
and two games of rummy.

34
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,740
And I've written letters to a wife,
a mother and a sweetheart.

35
00:03:04,182 --> 00:03:07,026
And I listened for half an hour to a
homesick young ensign from Texas.

36
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:08,951
He was awful cute.

37
00:03:09,545 --> 00:03:12,484
Now, what else can I do to help
boost the morale around here?

38
00:03:12,923 --> 00:03:14,424
You could go out to dinner with me.

39
00:03:15,105 --> 00:03:17,891
We'd get half way through the soup
and you'd get a call from the hospital.

40
00:03:17,991 --> 00:03:19,120
You're right.
- Uhuh.

41
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:21,666
I guess my courting will have
to wait until after the hostilities.

42
00:03:22,512 --> 00:03:24,943
There's a compound fracture down
the hall who's waiting to see me.

43
00:03:25,043 --> 00:03:26,823
But I'll be tied up for a while.
- Oh?

44
00:03:27,061 --> 00:03:30,072
They tell me he's feeling blue. You see,
his wife is expecting a baby any minute.

45
00:03:30,534 --> 00:03:32,130
I think he can stand some cheering up.

46
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,567
It's practically done.

47
00:03:34,044 --> 00:03:35,414
See you later, Rann.

48
00:03:37,424 --> 00:03:39,564
I'm sorry. They told me I
could find Dr Grahame in here.

49
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,063
He ought to be along any minute.
Why don't you come on in?

50
00:03:42,616 --> 00:03:43,402
Thank you.

51
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:45,030
Are you a patient here, sir?

52
00:03:46,264 --> 00:03:47,765
In a Naval hospital? No, no.

53
00:03:48,283 --> 00:03:49,670
I'm just a friend of the Doc's.

54
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:51,758
I flew in last night with
the ferry command.

55
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,383
The only thing wrong with me
is a double-barrelled hangover.

56
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:59,820
Dr Graham will be detained so
I'm taking you for an airing.

57
00:04:00,008 --> 00:04:01,823
Maybe he doesn't want
to go for an airing.

58
00:04:01,923 --> 00:04:02,738
He doesn't.

59
00:04:02,947 --> 00:04:06,037
There's nothing a woman likes
better than shoving a man around.

60
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,031
Hello.

61
00:04:37,214 --> 00:04:37,852
Hey.

62
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,160
Who are you?

63
00:04:41,392 --> 00:04:42,512
I'm Ellen Brown.

64
00:04:43,644 --> 00:04:45,822
Doesn't suit you at all.
It's much too plain.

65
00:04:46,742 --> 00:04:49,531
I'm sorry. I'd tell my parents about it
but they are still back in Kansas City.

66
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,517
Now what can I do for you, young man?

67
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:54,463
I can think of a lot of things.

68
00:04:55,179 --> 00:04:55,889
Oh?

69
00:04:56,146 --> 00:04:58,412
Well, shall we begin
with a game of cards?

70
00:04:58,713 --> 00:04:59,470
Uhuh.

71
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,666
Well, I could read the newspaper to you.

72
00:05:02,619 --> 00:05:04,006
I could write a letter for you.

73
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:05,802
I know.

74
00:05:06,562 --> 00:05:07,961
I know. I'll sit right here ..

75
00:05:08,061 --> 00:05:10,476
And you can tell me about that
wonderful baby you are expecting.

76
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:11,230
Huh?

77
00:05:11,468 --> 00:05:12,839
The baby you are expecting.

78
00:05:14,755 --> 00:05:16,059
Does Ripley know about this?

79
00:05:17,121 --> 00:05:18,185
I beg your pardon?

80
00:05:19,234 --> 00:05:20,096
Skip it.

81
00:05:23,515 --> 00:05:24,804
Which is your bad leg?

82
00:05:25,351 --> 00:05:28,236
Well, neither one of them
is working very well today.

83
00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:30,700
Oh, my head.

84
00:05:31,658 --> 00:05:33,559
Is your head bothering you?
- Terribly.

85
00:05:33,836 --> 00:05:34,708
Both of them.

86
00:05:36,362 --> 00:05:37,892
Would you like me to rub it for you?

87
00:05:38,991 --> 00:05:40,580
I couldn't think of anything nicer.

88
00:05:41,588 --> 00:05:42,231
Here.

89
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,669
Now relax.

90
00:05:44,536 --> 00:05:45,519
Close your eyes.

91
00:05:48,095 --> 00:05:49,871
Now just think of something pleasant.

92
00:05:52,372 --> 00:05:54,217
Pretty soon you'll be going
home to your wife.

93
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,857
Won't that be wonderful?
- Hmm.

94
00:05:58,525 --> 00:05:59,769
Think what she looks like.

95
00:06:00,562 --> 00:06:01,797
How pretty she is.

96
00:06:02,882 --> 00:06:03,774
Lovely.

97
00:06:04,713 --> 00:06:05,947
Beautiful blue eyes.

98
00:06:06,652 --> 00:06:07,656
A short nose.

99
00:06:08,765 --> 00:06:10,053
Soft brown hair.

100
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:13,518
And lovely kissable lips.

101
00:06:14,352 --> 00:06:17,349
Whoa. There is nothing wrong
with your morale, young man.

102
00:06:18,154 --> 00:06:20,857
I'll recommend to the doctor that you
be sent home to your wife immediately.

103
00:06:22,826 --> 00:06:24,159
Hey, wait a minute.

104
00:06:25,027 --> 00:06:26,732
You are all dressed.
- Naturally.

105
00:06:27,046 --> 00:06:28,483
George.
- Hello Ranney.

106
00:06:28,717 --> 00:06:31,628
Son of a gun. What are you doing here?
- Enjoying myself immensely.

107
00:06:31,928 --> 00:06:33,172
His leg isn't even broken.

108
00:06:33,924 --> 00:06:36,816
Hey Doc, what kind of nurses do
you have around here anyway?

109
00:06:37,042 --> 00:06:38,265
What goes on here, Ellen?

110
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:40,647
When I came in here he was
lying there all covered up.

111
00:06:41,341 --> 00:06:43,100
He let me make an
absolute idiot of myself.

112
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,788
Rubbing his head. Both of them.

113
00:06:45,964 --> 00:06:47,694
The best cure in the
world for a hangover.

114
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:50,793
Ellen, this is George Jones. An old
and untrustworthy friend of mine.

115
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:53,070
Now remember, I saw her first.
- George Jones.

116
00:06:53,606 --> 00:06:55,803
The name suits you perfectly.
Completely undistinguished.

117
00:06:56,243 --> 00:06:57,648
I wouldn't say that, honey.

118
00:06:58,654 --> 00:07:00,456
Some day you might wind up wearing it.

119
00:07:01,342 --> 00:07:02,208
Well ..

120
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:03,776
Shall we go?

121
00:07:08,075 --> 00:07:08,908
She's cute.

122
00:07:10,695 --> 00:07:13,443
It's pretty depressing have a
medical student for a room-mate.

123
00:07:13,648 --> 00:07:14,252
Oh?

124
00:07:14,352 --> 00:07:16,790
He is always dissecting
something. Including me.

125
00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:20,198
You got to know what's going on inside
if you expect to understand the outside.

126
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,426
Excuse me, sir. But you are wanted at
the hospital. There is an emergency.

127
00:07:23,566 --> 00:07:24,761
Oh Rann, I'm sorry.

128
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:26,380
So am I.

129
00:07:26,931 --> 00:07:29,086
Well, back to the salt mines.
See you folks later.

130
00:07:29,266 --> 00:07:30,367
Not if I can help it.

131
00:07:31,601 --> 00:07:34,206
I intend to keep you to myself
for the rest of the afternoon.

132
00:07:34,306 --> 00:07:35,016
Oh?

133
00:07:35,116 --> 00:07:36,638
And for the next two weeks.
- So.

134
00:07:36,986 --> 00:07:38,727
When a lonely prospector strikes gold ..

135
00:07:38,827 --> 00:07:40,958
He doesn't yell for his friend
until he stakes a claim.

136
00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:44,051
How about some lunch?
- Yes, I'd love it.

137
00:07:44,249 --> 00:07:46,378
I don't like to make love
on an empty stomach.

138
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:49,547
No. Neither do I.
Especially to a perfect stranger.

139
00:07:50,005 --> 00:07:52,599
Why, Ellen. Wherever did you
get the idea that I was perfect?

140
00:07:54,305 --> 00:07:54,978
You.

141
00:07:55,354 --> 00:07:57,829
Would you like to switch boxes
like we did when we were kids?

142
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,983
Naturally.
- You'll love it.

143
00:08:00,738 --> 00:08:03,044
Fried chicken, potato salad,
tomatoes, cookies.

144
00:08:04,523 --> 00:08:06,581
K-Rations. Canned ham.

145
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:08,762
Powdered milk. Chewing gum.

146
00:08:09,032 --> 00:08:10,384
And four cigarettes.

147
00:08:10,955 --> 00:08:11,702
Coffee.

148
00:08:12,371 --> 00:08:14,033
So measly. Is that the best you can do?

149
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:15,855
The best I can do with no ration card.

150
00:08:15,955 --> 00:08:16,541
Oh.

151
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,319
Now, if we were to combine forces.

152
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,677
And pool our resources.

153
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,530
I think we might do very well together.

154
00:08:29,363 --> 00:08:30,206
There we go.

155
00:08:31,668 --> 00:08:33,713
Goodbye George and good luck.
- Thanks for having me.

156
00:08:35,385 --> 00:08:36,371
Goodbye, darling.

157
00:08:41,037 --> 00:08:42,209
Take care of yourself.

158
00:08:44,694 --> 00:08:46,817
I'll be back, honey.
Remember that. I'll be back.

159
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,607
Of course. Of course.

160
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,310
And I'll never let you go.

161
00:08:55,597 --> 00:08:56,583
Goodbye, darling.

162
00:09:05,494 --> 00:09:06,337
Quite a guy.

163
00:09:07,777 --> 00:09:09,545
Yeah. Quite a guy.

164
00:09:12,294 --> 00:09:13,624
I'm going to marry him, Rann.

165
00:09:14,468 --> 00:09:16,484
I'm going to marry him just
as soon as he gets back.

166
00:09:17,915 --> 00:09:19,105
I figured as much.

167
00:09:20,911 --> 00:09:22,555
Are you sure he is right for you, Ellen?

168
00:09:23,614 --> 00:09:24,702
I don't know.

169
00:09:25,626 --> 00:09:28,110
It isn't something you think about.
It's just something you feel.

170
00:09:28,515 --> 00:09:29,273
You know.

171
00:09:29,998 --> 00:09:31,385
You can't do anything about it.

172
00:09:34,412 --> 00:09:35,713
I know what you mean, Ellen.

173
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,701
A guy with wings has it all over us
fellows who walk around down here.

174
00:09:56,724 --> 00:09:58,123
I'm coming up now, dear.

175
00:09:58,301 --> 00:09:59,860
Do you want me to bring you anything?

176
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:00,653
No.

177
00:10:08,184 --> 00:10:09,182
You alright?

178
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:12,022
What is it? What's the matter?
- Get a doctor.

179
00:10:13,764 --> 00:10:16,154
No, no. Not that. Get a doctor.
Another doctor. Not Grahame.

180
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:18,871
But I have to, dear. He is your doctor.
- Don't argue with me.

181
00:10:18,971 --> 00:10:21,299
Don't call Grahame. Get another doctor.
- Yes. Alright.

182
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,727
He didn't want the medicine
but I made him take it.

183
00:10:57,827 --> 00:10:58,823
Good girl.

184
00:11:07,713 --> 00:11:08,690
Still ticking?

185
00:11:09,441 --> 00:11:10,485
Sounds pretty good.

186
00:11:10,995 --> 00:11:13,187
You're evidently feeling
better that when Ellen called.

187
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:14,508
What time is it?

188
00:11:15,286 --> 00:11:16,415
Five after nine, dear.

189
00:11:17,831 --> 00:11:19,640
It took you a long
time to get here, Ranney.

190
00:11:19,832 --> 00:11:22,452
I know it seems like it but he
came just as soon as I called him.

191
00:11:23,494 --> 00:11:25,560
How long did it take?
- About twenty minutes.

192
00:11:26,377 --> 00:11:28,651
Fortunately Ellen caught me
as I was leaving on another call.

193
00:11:28,785 --> 00:11:30,710
Is there some alcohol about?
- Yes.

194
00:11:32,212 --> 00:11:33,325
Twenty minutes.

195
00:11:34,522 --> 00:11:37,326
I got that pain over forty-five
minutes ago. Why did you delay?

196
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,488
I didn't, dear.

197
00:11:39,212 --> 00:11:41,643
I lost a lot of time trying
to get another doctor.

198
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:44,571
But you needed him so badly that ..
- You know best.

199
00:11:45,967 --> 00:11:48,482
You always know best
nowadays, don't you Ellen.

200
00:11:48,797 --> 00:11:50,025
No, it isn't that.

201
00:11:50,694 --> 00:11:53,032
I just knew that he would come
sooner than anyone else.

202
00:11:53,364 --> 00:11:54,907
He's our friend, George.

203
00:11:58,023 --> 00:11:59,296
You're much better already.

204
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,679
Ranney, let's not kid each other.

205
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:04,436
We both know it. My own insurance
company wouldn't put a nickel on me.

206
00:12:04,736 --> 00:12:06,987
Now look here. All of us
are in that same boat.

207
00:12:07,535 --> 00:12:09,340
An automobile taking an unexpected turn.

208
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:11,497
A brick falling from a high building.

209
00:12:11,713 --> 00:12:13,043
A heart condition like yours.

210
00:12:13,281 --> 00:12:15,975
They're all hazards but that doesn't
necessarily mean they'll never happen.

211
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:18,933
Think of all the chances
you took during the war.

212
00:12:19,193 --> 00:12:20,545
You didn't worry about them.

213
00:12:20,724 --> 00:12:22,747
You came out feeling better
than when you went in.

214
00:12:23,465 --> 00:12:26,656
Now the only thing you have to do is lie
in bed and let us help you get well.

215
00:12:27,042 --> 00:12:29,373
Isn't that right, Ellen?
- Yes. That's what I keep telling him.

216
00:12:30,338 --> 00:12:31,839
You are lucky in many ways, George.

217
00:12:32,469 --> 00:12:35,074
You have a wonderful wife.
She's developed into a fine nurse.

218
00:12:35,174 --> 00:12:38,141
I don't think I'll be tying up her
exclusive services much longer.

219
00:12:39,903 --> 00:12:42,638
You must cut out this way of thinking.
- Yeah. I know. I know.

220
00:12:43,671 --> 00:12:46,031
Would you mind, Ellen?
I'd like to talk to George alone.

221
00:12:46,612 --> 00:12:48,040
No. Of course not.

222
00:12:50,462 --> 00:12:52,132
I'll be across the hall if you need me.

223
00:12:54,793 --> 00:12:57,283
Those were pretty morbid things
you were saying in front of Ellen.

224
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:02,223
Has she complained?
- Certainly not.

225
00:13:02,693 --> 00:13:04,109
But you got to think of her too.

226
00:13:04,515 --> 00:13:05,845
She is looking a little worn.

227
00:13:06,543 --> 00:13:09,389
Now when you get these ideas
try using a little mental therapy.

228
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,868
Next you'll be telling me
I ought to see a psychiatrist.

229
00:13:12,627 --> 00:13:15,200
That might be a very good idea.
- You doctors are all alike.

230
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:18,183
If you can't cure a patient
you tell him it's all in his mind.

231
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,497
I'm trying to help you, George.
You know that.

232
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:25,636
I'll drop in again this afternoon.

233
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:28,482
Maybe we can talk this thing out.
- Yeah. Maybe we can.

234
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,263
Ellen.
- Yes?

235
00:13:47,168 --> 00:13:50,520
Ellen, did anything particular happen
to upset George this morning?

236
00:13:51,881 --> 00:13:53,563
No. Not that I know of.

237
00:13:54,642 --> 00:13:55,972
Why, do you think he's worse?

238
00:13:56,684 --> 00:13:58,684
Frankly, I don't like his mental state.

239
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,119
I think maybe it's just the hot weather.

240
00:14:05,802 --> 00:14:06,788
It depresses him.

241
00:14:06,987 --> 00:14:09,648
He's been a very active man. It's
natural for him to be depressed but ..

242
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:10,405
Yes.

243
00:14:10,818 --> 00:14:12,893
When a man is at a low ebb
mentally and physically ..

244
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:15,363
He's prone all sorts of imaginary fears.

245
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:17,683
Yes. I know.

246
00:14:18,931 --> 00:14:21,394
I'd feel better if he were
in hospital for a while.

247
00:14:22,644 --> 00:14:24,512
No. No, I don't think so.

248
00:14:24,612 --> 00:14:26,440
You want what's best
for George don't you?

249
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,948
Well of course. That's just it.

250
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,220
I think it would upset him terribly.

251
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,973
You see, he doesn't seem to want
anyone else around him except me.

252
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:37,354
Well, this morning he didn't
even want me to call you.

253
00:14:38,195 --> 00:14:41,415
It isn't that he is disloyal Rann,
or he's lost confidence but ..

254
00:14:42,325 --> 00:14:45,574
Lately he seems to have taken
these sudden dislikes to people.

255
00:14:48,274 --> 00:14:49,117
Look, Ellen.

256
00:14:49,602 --> 00:14:51,647
You and George aren't just
patients. You are friends.

257
00:14:52,117 --> 00:14:54,019
George is up there
brooding and I don't like it.

258
00:14:54,423 --> 00:14:56,067
It could develop into something serious.

259
00:14:56,871 --> 00:14:59,715
If you won't send him to the hospital I
want you have someone here to help you.

260
00:15:01,076 --> 00:15:02,645
I'm sure you know what's best, Rann.

261
00:15:02,745 --> 00:15:04,817
But honestly, I don't know
how George will take it.

262
00:15:05,425 --> 00:15:07,470
He doesn't even seem to want
his aunt around anymore.

263
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:10,903
Ellen, I don't think it is wise for you
to try to handle this alone any longer.

264
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,188
You're stressed to the
breaking point already.

265
00:15:13,536 --> 00:15:15,295
I'll take it up with
George this afternoon.

266
00:15:18,348 --> 00:15:20,078
I'd better get back upstairs.
- No, Ellen.

267
00:15:20,256 --> 00:15:21,500
Let him relax for a while.

268
00:15:22,676 --> 00:15:23,450
Alright.

269
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,415
Give the medicine a chance to work.
- Yeah.

270
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:27,985
I want you to relax too.

271
00:15:33,587 --> 00:15:35,619
Remember now, you can call
me any time you need me.

272
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:37,749
Even if you just think you need me.
- Oh, thanks.

273
00:15:38,588 --> 00:15:40,966
I don't know what I'd do sometimes
if I didn't remember that.

274
00:15:43,436 --> 00:15:44,541
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

275
00:15:44,641 --> 00:15:46,128
You're doing fine.
- Thanks.

276
00:15:57,599 --> 00:15:59,803
Stay where you are. Don't move.

277
00:16:00,074 --> 00:16:01,308
Oh. You frightened me.

278
00:16:02,266 --> 00:16:03,717
Did I?
- Yes.

279
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:06,056
Say, what are you all dressed up for?

280
00:16:06,787 --> 00:16:09,942
And where did you get
that beautiful new tricycle?

281
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,838
It's not a tricycle.

282
00:16:12,273 --> 00:16:14,092
It's a horse. A palomino.

283
00:16:14,345 --> 00:16:15,612
My grandpa gave it to me.

284
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:18,536
Oh he did? Well, it's beautiful, Billy.

285
00:16:18,968 --> 00:16:21,186
I'm not Billy. I am Hoppy.

286
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:22,322
Hoppy?

287
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:23,992
Now who is Hoppy?

288
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,691
Don't you know who Hoppy is?

289
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:27,968
No, I'm afraid I don't.
- Don't you have television?

290
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,088
What?

291
00:16:29,361 --> 00:16:30,870
Don't you have television?
- No.

292
00:16:31,546 --> 00:16:33,207
You want to see mine?
- Sure.

293
00:16:34,574 --> 00:16:35,665
Look inside.

294
00:16:35,859 --> 00:16:37,132
Well, look at that.
- See.

295
00:16:37,232 --> 00:16:40,371
Hoppy is in there too.
Just like a real cowboy.

296
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,102
Why of course. I know him.
That's Hopalong Cassidy.

297
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,646
Well, saved many people today, Hoppy?

298
00:16:47,413 --> 00:16:49,003
Oh, six to a hundred.

299
00:16:49,422 --> 00:16:51,952
Don't try any tricks now.
- I wouldn't think of it.

300
00:16:52,621 --> 00:16:53,808
Do you have any cookies?

301
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:55,070
No I haven't.

302
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,953
See, the grocery man hasn't
come yet but I will have later.

303
00:16:59,071 --> 00:17:01,371
Do you know what I do to bad men?
- No. What do you do?

304
00:17:02,293 --> 00:17:04,451
I dynamite them into little pieces.

305
00:17:04,943 --> 00:17:06,273
Shoot them. Put them in jail.

306
00:17:07,061 --> 00:17:09,942
Oh? I don't think even the real
Hoppy would treat bad men that way.

307
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,444
Well.

308
00:17:12,061 --> 00:17:13,463
Really what I did was ..

309
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,947
Lasso them. Tie them up.

310
00:17:16,522 --> 00:17:17,566
Throw them in jail.

311
00:17:17,847 --> 00:17:20,848
Well, that sounds like a lot more
work and more dangerous too.

312
00:17:21,534 --> 00:17:24,261
I took care of you didn't I?
- Yeah, You sure did.

313
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:25,510
Can I come in?

314
00:17:26,093 --> 00:17:29,632
Honey, I'm sorry. I'm afraid not.
My husband isn't feeling well today.

315
00:17:30,168 --> 00:17:31,389
I won't make any noise.

316
00:17:31,587 --> 00:17:33,904
If I was eating cookies
I couldn't even talk.

317
00:17:34,769 --> 00:17:35,755
No. You couldn't.

318
00:17:36,051 --> 00:17:37,356
Well I tell you what you do.

319
00:17:37,547 --> 00:17:39,792
After the grocery man comes
which will be around 12 o'clock.

320
00:17:40,078 --> 00:17:42,988
You come to the back door very quietly
and I'll have some cookies for you.

321
00:17:43,239 --> 00:17:44,545
Okay?
- Okay.

322
00:17:44,921 --> 00:17:48,489
I'll ride my horse up and down and see
that no bad people make any noise.

323
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:51,071
Because I am your friend, aren't I.

324
00:17:51,641 --> 00:17:53,257
That's right, Hoppy. You are my friend.

325
00:17:53,902 --> 00:17:56,684
Toot-toot. I'm an Indian. I'm an Indian.

326
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:26,212
George.

327
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:28,507
You weren't out of bed
just now were you?

328
00:18:28,998 --> 00:18:29,682
No.

329
00:18:32,107 --> 00:18:34,397
It must be the heat. I could
have sworn I saw somebody ..

330
00:18:34,497 --> 00:18:36,192
What took you so long?
- What, dear?

331
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:38,479
What took you so long?

332
00:18:39,145 --> 00:18:40,683
Sorry, dear. I was talking to Billy.

333
00:18:41,075 --> 00:18:42,396
I should say Hoppy.

334
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:44,399
Let me change your pillow.

335
00:18:44,574 --> 00:18:47,420
You know, the boy I told you about
who just moved in to the neighborhood.

336
00:18:48,126 --> 00:18:50,977
The one with the glasses. You know.
He's an awful sweet little kid.

337
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:53,327
What were you talking
to Ranney Graham about?

338
00:18:53,582 --> 00:18:54,940
That's what I'm interested in.

339
00:18:55,122 --> 00:18:56,556
We were talking about you, dear.

340
00:18:57,195 --> 00:18:59,298
He thinks you worry too
much about yourself.

341
00:19:00,694 --> 00:19:02,224
If I didn't, I don't know who would.

342
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:10,200
George.

343
00:19:10,618 --> 00:19:13,074
Ever since you got out of bed
yesterday to see if you could walk ..

344
00:19:13,174 --> 00:19:14,332
I've had it on my mind.

345
00:19:14,981 --> 00:19:17,684
I want you to promise me not get out
of bed again while I'm out of the room.

346
00:19:18,501 --> 00:19:19,430
Alright, Ellen.

347
00:19:21,445 --> 00:19:22,309
Did you ..

348
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:24,902
Call the druggist about getting
the heat prescription filled?

349
00:19:25,391 --> 00:19:27,551
Yes, dear. He said he'd send
it up here later in the day.

350
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,207
But there is enough there
if we need it before.

351
00:19:30,655 --> 00:19:32,099
Did you tell them I'd spilled it?

352
00:19:32,229 --> 00:19:34,391
No, I didn't. Do you feel
well enough for the paper?

353
00:19:36,374 --> 00:19:37,027
Yeah.

354
00:19:38,267 --> 00:19:39,335
The editorial page?

355
00:19:39,435 --> 00:19:41,280
No. Just the front page
is alright, thank you.

356
00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:44,789
Here it is.

357
00:19:47,158 --> 00:19:48,356
You look tired, Ellen.

358
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:51,308
I'm not.

359
00:19:51,517 --> 00:19:52,990
It's just that it is so hot today.

360
00:19:56,706 --> 00:19:58,207
What are you thinking about, Ellen?

361
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,418
Well, you know I was ..

362
00:20:01,837 --> 00:20:03,110
I was just thinking that ..

363
00:20:03,767 --> 00:20:05,120
Everything in our lives.

364
00:20:05,817 --> 00:20:08,483
Every breath, every though
has been for ourselves.

365
00:20:09,421 --> 00:20:11,266
I don't think people can
do that and be happy.

366
00:20:12,209 --> 00:20:13,070
Do you?

367
00:20:13,192 --> 00:20:14,952
You're getting a little
confused, darling.

368
00:20:15,052 --> 00:20:17,687
It was me that Ranney Grahame
told to change my way of thinking.

369
00:20:17,997 --> 00:20:20,027
Oh no. I mean it was my fault too.

370
00:20:20,767 --> 00:20:21,494
I ..

371
00:20:22,465 --> 00:20:24,584
I just wasn't strong enough to help you.

372
00:20:25,981 --> 00:20:27,720
But we could change all that now.

373
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,786
It could make all the difference
in the world, George.

374
00:20:30,886 --> 00:20:32,203
Come here, Ellen.
- Yes.

375
00:20:34,303 --> 00:20:36,407
What is the first thing you do?

376
00:20:37,684 --> 00:20:38,484
When?

377
00:20:39,362 --> 00:20:42,043
When I am out of this bed again.
Away from the house.

378
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,831
I'll just be so grateful
that you are well.

379
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:49,720
I think I would ..

380
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:52,622
Try to do something for somebody ..
- I mean you.

381
00:20:54,113 --> 00:20:55,157
For your own self.

382
00:20:57,439 --> 00:20:59,152
I'd like children.
- Yeah.

383
00:21:01,163 --> 00:21:02,436
And then I'd like a garden.

384
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:05,331
A real garden.
Like the woman next door has.

385
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,110
And I'd find out about
flowers and things.

386
00:21:08,845 --> 00:21:11,011
I'd compare notes with every
other woman on the block.

387
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,850
So you'd have a garden
and children, huh?

388
00:21:14,284 --> 00:21:15,014
Yes.

389
00:21:16,144 --> 00:21:17,690
Isn't it good to plan again.

390
00:21:18,871 --> 00:21:20,973
It kinda gives you something
to hold on to, doesn't it.

391
00:21:21,641 --> 00:21:24,444
Oh my, it takes a long time
for things to sink in doesn't it.

392
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:28,951
You always said that. You said make a
plan for anything and then stick to it.

393
00:21:30,099 --> 00:21:31,110
Alright.

394
00:21:32,349 --> 00:21:34,608
Alright. Our plan now
is for you to get well.

395
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:37,958
And then afterwards ..
- You must think I'm very stupid.

396
00:21:39,421 --> 00:21:40,309
Stupid?

397
00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:42,282
Don't you think I know
you're in love with him?

398
00:21:43,331 --> 00:21:45,096
In love with whom?
- Grahame.

399
00:21:48,335 --> 00:21:50,208
Why, that's the silliest
thing I ever heard of.

400
00:21:50,483 --> 00:21:52,442
You are not as subtle as
you think you are, Ellen.

401
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,024
It's quite obvious.

402
00:21:54,441 --> 00:21:56,286
At first I thought it was
just an infatuation.

403
00:21:56,493 --> 00:21:58,124
But now I realize it is more serious.

404
00:21:58,353 --> 00:22:01,611
Serious in the way that my life is more
in danger from your heart than mine.

405
00:22:01,872 --> 00:22:05,168
George, what are you talking about?
- I almost feel sorry for you, Ellen.

406
00:22:06,401 --> 00:22:08,656
He overrated you Ellen,
just as he underrated me.

407
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:11,482
You haven't the courage on the
intelligence he thinks you have.

408
00:22:11,582 --> 00:22:12,890
Please don't talk like that.

409
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:16,084
You suppose I don't know he told you to
rake over these old coals this morning?

410
00:22:16,184 --> 00:22:17,111
No. He didn't.

411
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:20,375
You convinced me I was a failure
by making me impossible promises.

412
00:22:20,877 --> 00:22:22,626
I know something about my own sickness.

413
00:22:23,617 --> 00:22:26,519
I know what happens to a man
when you take away his self-respect.

414
00:22:26,619 --> 00:22:28,643
I know what happens when
you constantly upset me.

415
00:22:28,743 --> 00:22:31,595
George, this is wrong. I know it is.
Please don't upset yourself any more.

416
00:22:33,471 --> 00:22:35,143
That's what he told you to do, isn't it?

417
00:22:35,546 --> 00:22:38,684
Did he also tell you to delay getting
help to me like you did this morning?

418
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,740
How could you do that, Ellen?

419
00:22:41,182 --> 00:22:43,473
How can you take a man of
second-rate intelligence like that?

420
00:22:43,573 --> 00:22:45,473
I'll do anything you say.
Get another doctor.

421
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:47,706
You didn't know what you
were in for, did you, Ellen.

422
00:22:48,161 --> 00:22:49,749
Please don't talk anymore.

423
00:22:56,629 --> 00:22:57,651
Rest, darling.

424
00:23:05,145 --> 00:23:08,446
Oh, George. You just couldn't believe
those things you said about Dr Grahame.

425
00:23:08,643 --> 00:23:10,488
I don't even want to hear his name.

426
00:23:29,196 --> 00:23:30,546
Leave it half way up, Ellen.

427
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:47,356
"<i>I was so hurt I could
hardly keep from crying</i>."

428
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:52,098
"<i>Again, I reminded myself that George
was terribly ill and didn't mean it</i>."

429
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:06,722
"<i>I knew I had to keep doing
something. Anything</i>."

430
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:09,201
"<i>Anything to keep me from
hearing George's words</i>."

431
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:11,483
"<i>He didn't mean them</i>."

432
00:25:11,906 --> 00:25:13,093
"<i>He couldn't mean them</i>."

433
00:25:13,705 --> 00:25:15,379
"<i>It was his illness. The heat</i>.

434
00:25:16,597 --> 00:25:18,184
"<i>But when I took his lunch up to him</i>."

435
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,718
"<i>I'd be pleasant and cheerful
as if nothing had happened</i>."

436
00:25:25,668 --> 00:25:26,351
Hey.

437
00:25:27,684 --> 00:25:29,173
Oh. Hi, Hoppy.
- Shush.

438
00:25:29,703 --> 00:25:30,718
What's the matter?

439
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:34,209
You don't have to whisper now.
He is awake.

440
00:25:34,572 --> 00:25:35,816
I'm just fixing his lunch.

441
00:25:37,126 --> 00:25:39,497
You come for your cookies?
- Mummy says not to beg.

442
00:25:39,844 --> 00:25:41,261
But I've already had my lunch.

443
00:25:41,361 --> 00:25:43,162
You're not begging.
I want to give you them.

444
00:25:43,262 --> 00:25:44,678
There you are. Take your choice.

445
00:25:44,868 --> 00:25:45,654
Thank you.

446
00:25:46,032 --> 00:25:46,695
Say.

447
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,865
Are you catching a cold in this weather?

448
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,403
You sound just like my Mom.

449
00:25:51,989 --> 00:25:53,059
No. I'm not.
- Oh.

450
00:25:53,548 --> 00:25:55,030
I got you something too.

451
00:25:55,454 --> 00:25:56,994
A present for me?
- Uhuh.

452
00:25:57,257 --> 00:25:58,777
Oh Hoppy, how nice.

453
00:26:00,149 --> 00:26:01,884
I wonder what this could be.

454
00:26:05,726 --> 00:26:07,379
That's very nice of you.

455
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,732
Are you sure you don't
want to keep it yourself?

456
00:26:09,858 --> 00:26:11,499
We got a big television at home.

457
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,818
A real one. This is just a pretend one.

458
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:15,764
Well I know it is but it's very nice.

459
00:26:16,017 --> 00:26:17,976
I want to thank you very
much for giving it to me.

460
00:26:21,402 --> 00:26:23,590
Mummy says television is
good for when you are sick.

461
00:26:24,651 --> 00:26:26,350
Daddy says it makes him sick.

462
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,726
Mummy lets me look at
television so I stay in bed.

463
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,575
Well I think that is a very good idea.

464
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,614
I'll have to tell my husband about that.

465
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:35,984
Can I see him?

466
00:26:36,238 --> 00:26:37,997
I can play with him if
he can't go outside.

467
00:26:38,209 --> 00:26:39,857
Well, that is very nice of you but ..

468
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:42,167
I don't think he is well
enough to see people, dear.

469
00:26:42,547 --> 00:26:43,705
I won't make any noise.

470
00:26:43,951 --> 00:26:45,453
I'll just eat my cookies and look.

471
00:26:45,867 --> 00:26:46,562
Yeah?

472
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:47,665
Well.

473
00:26:47,951 --> 00:26:49,910
Perhaps in a week or two
when he's feeling better.

474
00:26:50,515 --> 00:26:53,106
Okay. My horse is sick.
I got to go and see my horse.

475
00:26:53,322 --> 00:26:54,113
Okay.

476
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:04,775
Can I take some cookies for my horse?

477
00:27:05,178 --> 00:27:07,305
By all means. Take as many as you like.

478
00:27:07,765 --> 00:27:09,690
I'll go and see my horse now.
- Alright.

479
00:27:11,222 --> 00:27:14,389
Say, honey. Are you sure you don't want
to take that television set with you?

480
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:16,840
The man can use it but
tell him not to break it.

481
00:27:17,214 --> 00:27:19,338
I got to use it later.
- Alright. I'll tell him.

482
00:27:19,828 --> 00:27:21,122
And thank you again, Hoppy.

483
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,568
Goodbye.
- Bye.

I'm feeling much better.

492
00:28:13,795 --> 00:28:15,010
Hoppy sent you a present.

493
00:28:15,654 --> 00:28:16,640
A television set.

494
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:20,006
And he says not to break it
because he has to use it later.

495
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,349
You two are getting to be great pals.

496
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:25,306
Yes. He's a darling little kid.
He's so eager to please.

497
00:28:25,785 --> 00:28:27,168
Oh honey, not now.

498
00:28:28,781 --> 00:28:31,861
Alright. But at least you will have
clean hands and face before you eat.

499
00:28:34,959 --> 00:28:35,654
Ellen.

500
00:28:36,424 --> 00:28:37,772
Has the postman come yet?

501
00:28:39,485 --> 00:28:40,643
What did you say, dear?

502
00:28:40,825 --> 00:28:42,337
The postman. Has he come yet?

503
00:28:42,684 --> 00:28:43,524
Oh, no.

504
00:28:44,487 --> 00:28:45,933
No. He is very late today.

505
00:28:47,407 --> 00:28:48,787
I guess it must be the heat.

506
00:28:50,144 --> 00:28:51,932
Give him this letter
when he comes, please.

507
00:28:52,642 --> 00:28:55,069
Oh dear. I thought you were resting.

508
00:28:55,449 --> 00:28:56,904
It was a rest in a way.

509
00:28:57,308 --> 00:28:59,042
And a relief to get that written.

510
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:02,247
A new insurance law
affects the Emerson estate.

511
00:29:02,347 --> 00:29:04,249
I've got to check the policies.
- Alright, dear.

512
00:29:05,352 --> 00:29:08,131
I'll meet him at the gate and
give it to him myself. How's that?

513
00:29:09,258 --> 00:29:09,974
Towel.

514
00:29:11,849 --> 00:29:12,805
Thank you.

515
00:29:18,396 --> 00:29:20,135
There you are.
- Looks good.

516
00:29:20,771 --> 00:29:21,645
It is good.

517
00:29:23,184 --> 00:29:23,970
Oh, Ellen.

518
00:29:25,203 --> 00:29:26,898
The letter.
- Oh. Sorry.

519
00:29:28,715 --> 00:29:30,386
And if you finish before I get back.

520
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:33,314
Don't try to put that tray on the floor.
Remember what happened last time.

521
00:29:33,494 --> 00:29:34,351
Right.

522
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:37,826
Say, you really wrote
a letter, didn't you.

523
00:30:01,482 --> 00:30:03,726
"<i>I wanted to stop a minute
and chat with the neighbors</i>."

524
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,669
"<i>But I knew George wouldn't like it</i>."

525
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,383
"<i>He didn't believe in neighbors</i>."

526
00:30:13,205 --> 00:30:14,535
"<i>And then I saw the postman</i>."

527
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,237
Yoo-hoo!

528
00:30:25,804 --> 00:30:27,730
When do you think this
heat is going to break?

529
00:30:29,696 --> 00:30:30,851
Morning, Mr Carston.

530
00:30:31,057 --> 00:30:32,481
Good morning, Mrs Jones.

531
00:30:32,672 --> 00:30:34,576
It certainly is hot, isn't it.
- Oh, it sure is.

532
00:30:34,804 --> 00:30:36,306
Especially with this mailbag.

533
00:30:36,802 --> 00:30:37,876
It does look heavy.

534
00:30:37,976 --> 00:30:40,774
If I'm all in now, I wonder what
I'm going to be like this afternoon.

535
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,671
Well I guess I'll live.
- Yeah.

536
00:30:42,887 --> 00:30:45,795
With everything so high I've got to
keep my nose to the grindstone.

537
00:30:46,686 --> 00:30:48,531
I got a pension plan.
Did I tell you about it?

538
00:30:48,648 --> 00:30:49,520
Yes, you did.

539
00:30:49,653 --> 00:30:51,722
Well, you got to follow it to a T.

540
00:30:52,031 --> 00:30:53,075
Every penny counts.

541
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:55,227
You know, my wife
doesn't understand that.

542
00:30:55,463 --> 00:30:57,360
She says I'm an old penny-pincher.
- No.

543
00:30:57,545 --> 00:30:58,572
But I told her ..

544
00:30:58,672 --> 00:31:00,717
Mr Carston, would you take
this letter for me please?

545
00:31:02,174 --> 00:31:02,920
Thanks.

546
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,436
I'll swear I bring in more
mail than I take out.

547
00:31:05,714 --> 00:31:07,942
I'm sorry. I'd run up to the
mailbox with it myself.

548
00:31:08,127 --> 00:31:10,830
But I don't like to leave the house
alone with my husband being ill and all.

549
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:14,613
Nobody figures it slows me up lugging
extra mail around in this awful heat.

550
00:31:15,194 --> 00:31:15,873
Sorry.

551
00:31:15,973 --> 00:31:18,545
My feet are throbbing.
Do your feet ever ..

552
00:31:18,978 --> 00:31:20,229
Yes, I know what you mean.

553
00:31:20,329 --> 00:31:23,755
You know, I ought to be way out on
Pine Avenue and Merritt Street by noon.

554
00:31:23,855 --> 00:31:26,178
But the rate I'm going I won't
be out there until one o'clock.

555
00:31:26,525 --> 00:31:28,640
What with everybody giving
me mail to take back.

556
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:31,041
Is that mail for me?
- Huh?

557
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:33,372
That mail. Is it mine?
- Oh yes.

558
00:31:33,553 --> 00:31:34,792
Excuse me.
- Thank you.

559
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:37,134
It's that retirement plan
that keeps me going.

560
00:31:37,403 --> 00:31:39,991
Yeah, I bet it is. Thanks again Carston.
- You're welcome.

561
00:31:40,961 --> 00:31:43,603
I'm glad to see your husband is
well enough to be up, Mrs Jones.

562
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:45,271
Goodbye.

563
00:31:46,642 --> 00:31:48,274
I wish I could lie down for a while.

564
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:04,360
George, you <i>were</i> out of bed.

565
00:32:04,858 --> 00:32:07,590
And you promised me you wouldn't ..
- I can't get leave bed in my condition.

566
00:32:08,412 --> 00:32:10,380
Dear, the postman said
he saw you at the window.

567
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,627
Did he really?

568
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:15,477
Well no, he didn't
actually say he saw you.

569
00:32:16,163 --> 00:32:18,234
The postman has got
a touch of sunstroke.

570
00:32:20,854 --> 00:32:22,631
Yeah. Me too I guess.

571
00:32:26,093 --> 00:32:27,823
That hot wind certainly
doesn't help much.

572
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:29,191
You finished?

573
00:32:29,295 --> 00:32:30,685
Yes. Very nice thank you.

574
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,373
I'm glad you got that letter off.

575
00:32:35,192 --> 00:32:36,693
Come over here, Ellen and sit down.

576
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,449
Would you like your aunt Clara to
come up and visit for a little while?

577
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:49,550
It's pretty hot for the old girl.
- She'd love it if you ask for her.

578
00:32:50,451 --> 00:32:52,590
You are the apple of her eye, you know.
- I always was.

579
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:54,768
You know.

580
00:32:54,895 --> 00:32:57,884
Aunt Clara gave me a
toy when I was a kid.

581
00:32:58,529 --> 00:32:59,716
A toy I was crazy about.

582
00:33:00,181 --> 00:33:03,067
My mother used to say she gave me too
much but I can still remember that toy.

583
00:33:03,947 --> 00:33:04,876
It was a ..

584
00:33:05,308 --> 00:33:09,074
It was a bottle with a small absolutely
perfect sailing ship built inside of it.

585
00:33:10,695 --> 00:33:11,710
You know, I was ..

586
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:14,749
I was so crazy about that toy I
wouldn't let anybody touch it.

587
00:33:15,277 --> 00:33:16,967
No?
- Not even my mother.

588
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,738
One day I was making a .. garden.

589
00:33:21,906 --> 00:33:23,606
Making a garden in the back yard.

590
00:33:24,958 --> 00:33:28,117
And a neighbor boy came running out
of my house with my ship in his hand.

591
00:33:29,253 --> 00:33:30,250
Somehow, I ..

592
00:33:30,756 --> 00:33:32,690
Got it away from him
without breaking it.

593
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:35,962
I don't know what I said to him but ..

594
00:33:36,488 --> 00:33:38,213
He looked awfully scared and white.

595
00:33:38,787 --> 00:33:42,028
And then I was frightened too, thinking
he may have broken it. The ship, I mean.

596
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:46,275
I picked up the little rake I had been
playing with and hit him with it.

597
00:33:46,637 --> 00:33:48,790
And where his face had been
so white it was all blood.

598
00:33:50,393 --> 00:33:52,581
I think I might have killed him
if mother hadn't come out.

599
00:33:53,515 --> 00:33:55,863
She took him in the house.
To the bathroom and washed his face.

600
00:33:55,963 --> 00:33:57,928
They were both so excited but I felt ..

601
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:00,877
Safe now I had my own little ship again.

602
00:34:02,846 --> 00:34:05,549
And when the neighbor boy stopped crying
mother turned to me and she said ..

603
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,658
Give it to him.

604
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,783
She sounded so strange
and quiet I knew I had to.

605
00:34:12,416 --> 00:34:15,436
He held out his hand. I could see
he hadn't learned anything so I ..

606
00:34:15,945 --> 00:34:18,227
I handed him the ship but just
as he was about to take it ..

607
00:34:18,327 --> 00:34:21,072
I let it drop on the tiled
floor and I stepped on it.

608
00:34:22,546 --> 00:34:25,361
He'd never have known what it was
but somehow or other it was mine.

609
00:34:26,701 --> 00:34:28,476
Mine more than it had ever been before.

610
00:34:28,683 --> 00:34:31,490
I remembered every little
perfect thing about that ship.

611
00:34:32,485 --> 00:34:36,539
But to them it was just a mess of broken
glass and matchsticks on the floor.

612
00:34:39,522 --> 00:34:40,365
Ellen.

613
00:34:41,532 --> 00:34:44,215
You know who that
neighbor boy looked like?

614
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,754
He looked very much like Grahame.

615
00:34:50,456 --> 00:34:54,990
And your Dr Grahame will find himself
in the same position as that little boy.

616
00:34:55,955 --> 00:34:57,743
But we are not going
to have him here again.

617
00:34:58,856 --> 00:35:01,645
But that doesn't change the fact you're
wrong about him. He's been fine to you.

618
00:35:01,745 --> 00:35:04,499
So thoughtful and given
you so much time.

619
00:35:05,124 --> 00:35:08,283
Maybe that's is because he
is a bachelor? No home life.

620
00:35:09,851 --> 00:35:11,209
He's been a good friend to us.

621
00:35:12,251 --> 00:35:14,551
Our time is limited so
you must listen carefully.

622
00:35:16,062 --> 00:35:18,682
Ranney Grahame may have you alright.

623
00:35:19,574 --> 00:35:22,330
He'll be disappointed with what he gets.

624
00:35:25,921 --> 00:35:27,138
George, please.

625
00:35:30,184 --> 00:35:32,674
George, I can't let you
talk this way anymore.

626
00:35:36,882 --> 00:35:38,028
I'll fill this up.

627
00:36:20,664 --> 00:36:22,204
I'll be downstairs if you want me.

628
00:36:22,645 --> 00:36:23,860
You'd better wait, Ellen.

629
00:36:24,232 --> 00:36:25,922
I've written to the district attorney ..

630
00:36:26,022 --> 00:36:29,434
Asking him to make a full investigation
if anything happens to me today.

631
00:36:29,753 --> 00:36:31,271
Before he can get help to me.

632
00:36:32,505 --> 00:36:34,126
Why do you torture yourself like this?

633
00:36:34,521 --> 00:36:36,370
Why do you imagine
things that don't exist?

634
00:36:36,915 --> 00:36:37,989
That letter exists.

635
00:36:38,417 --> 00:36:39,971
It proves you are trying to kill me.

636
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:41,842
But I'm not.

637
00:36:42,248 --> 00:36:43,294
I'm not!

638
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:47,202
If I can't help you George, then I am
going to get someone else in who can.

639
00:36:47,302 --> 00:36:49,000
It's not me that needs help now, Ellen.

640
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,857
You gave that letter to the postman
yourself just a while ago.

641
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:55,677
Yes. Yes, I gave him the letter. The one
that you wrote about insurance policies.

642
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:59,398
I knew you wouldn't recognise the
district attorney's name if you saw it.

643
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:01,334
Nobody ever does. Isn't that strange?

644
00:37:01,994 --> 00:37:05,175
Everybody knows he's the district
attorney but nobody ever knows his name.

645
00:37:07,453 --> 00:37:09,498
We are going to get someone else in.
Another doctor.

646
00:37:10,234 --> 00:37:11,678
Because this is all in your mind.

647
00:37:11,841 --> 00:37:13,011
My mind is fine.

648
00:37:14,356 --> 00:37:17,701
To reassure you on the point let say to
you that letter <i>was</i> about insurance.

649
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,068
I told the district attorney how much
insurance we had on each other's lives.

650
00:37:22,787 --> 00:37:26,058
If either of us died the other would
do very nicely for the rest of his life.

651
00:37:26,437 --> 00:37:28,427
Or <i>her </i>life very comfortably indeed.

652
00:37:28,938 --> 00:37:29,524
Oh.

653
00:37:30,267 --> 00:37:33,188
I also told them how you and
Dr Grahame, how you ..

654
00:37:33,864 --> 00:37:38,129
Working together to aggravate my
condition so it won't look like murder.

655
00:37:39,326 --> 00:37:40,089
George!

656
00:37:40,335 --> 00:37:41,762
I also told him how you are ..

657
00:37:42,535 --> 00:37:45,229
Gradually giving me overdoses
of the heart medicine.

658
00:37:46,192 --> 00:37:47,388
But that isn't true.

659
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,876
Anyone would know that isn't true.

660
00:37:50,048 --> 00:37:50,863
Would they?

661
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:53,609
Why is that bottle almost empty, huh?

662
00:37:54,554 --> 00:37:55,966
We only got it the other day.

663
00:37:56,476 --> 00:37:57,319
Well, you ..

664
00:37:57,614 --> 00:37:59,384
You told me you spilled it on the tray.

665
00:37:59,484 --> 00:38:02,187
You told me that yourself, George.
- You didn't tell the druggist that.

666
00:38:03,021 --> 00:38:06,242
Mr Philips will make an excellent
witness against you, Ellen.

667
00:38:06,866 --> 00:38:10,866
He'll be the first if anything happens
to me, and let me say there are others.

668
00:38:11,118 --> 00:38:12,694
The letter takes care of everything.

669
00:38:12,794 --> 00:38:15,237
The druggist, the medicine,
the doctor. He's in it too.

670
00:38:15,408 --> 00:38:18,190
You have implicated your
old friend Grahame you know.

671
00:38:18,487 --> 00:38:20,031
Nothing is going to happen to you.

672
00:38:21,809 --> 00:38:23,844
I don't know if you are
doing this to frighten me.

673
00:38:23,944 --> 00:38:26,018
But I'm going to get the letter
back from the postman.

674
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,885
You are not going
anyplace anymore, Ellen.

675
00:38:29,161 --> 00:38:30,548
Because I am going to kill you.

676
00:38:32,458 --> 00:38:34,102
I decided that definitely this morning.

677
00:38:39,402 --> 00:38:40,245
You can't ..

678
00:38:40,454 --> 00:38:42,301
You couldn't mean this, George.
You couldn't.

679
00:38:43,878 --> 00:38:45,580
George, you know I
wouldn't hurt anybody.

680
00:38:45,725 --> 00:38:47,089
Anybody! Much less you.

681
00:38:49,534 --> 00:38:52,245
George, think! It's me.
It's Ellen! Your darling.

682
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:53,974
But you did want to be rid of me.

683
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:56,464
It was in your mind. That's why
you feel so guilty, isn't it.

684
00:38:56,743 --> 00:38:57,329
No.

685
00:38:58,005 --> 00:39:00,512
The letter will take care of Grahame.
I will take care of you myself.

686
00:39:01,373 --> 00:39:03,001
I'll make it look like self-defence.

687
00:39:04,485 --> 00:39:05,555
Please don't.

688
00:39:06,813 --> 00:39:09,029
There are just too many
things against you, Ellen.

689
00:39:09,276 --> 00:39:11,980
You used to say that you were
lonesome until you met me.

690
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,128
George.

691
00:39:15,524 --> 00:39:17,072
George, you love me.
- No, Ellen.

692
00:39:17,695 --> 00:39:19,846
I love you, George.
- Since I've been sick.

693
00:39:19,946 --> 00:39:22,437
Since he's been coming to the
house you've hated the sight of me.

694
00:39:22,537 --> 00:39:23,554
No, I haven't.

695
00:39:36,478 --> 00:39:37,064
No.

696
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:38,918
No!

697
00:39:48,939 --> 00:39:50,473
"<i>It was one of those awful dreams</i>."

698
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,848
"<i>The kind I used to have
when George was overseas</i>."

699
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,484
"<i>That man lying there was George</i>."

700
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:03,418
"<i>My husband</i>."

701
00:40:04,289 --> 00:40:05,559
"<i>He was dead</i>."

702
00:40:06,312 --> 00:40:07,702
"<i>He died trying to kill me</i>."

703
00:40:13,356 --> 00:40:14,873
[ Telephone ]

704
00:40:20,033 --> 00:40:21,295
[ Telephone ]

705
00:40:27,252 --> 00:40:28,844
"<i>Hello .. hello?</i>"

706
00:40:29,685 --> 00:40:30,754
"<i>Hello?</i>"
- Yes.

707
00:40:31,292 --> 00:40:32,266
"<i>Mrs Jones?</i>"

708
00:40:32,583 --> 00:40:33,646
Yes. Who is it?

709
00:40:33,935 --> 00:40:35,580
"<i>Mr Philips down at the drugstore</i>."

710
00:40:36,445 --> 00:40:38,082
What is it that you want, Mr Philips?

711
00:40:38,182 --> 00:40:40,172
"<i>It's about that heart
medicine you want refilled</i>."

712
00:40:41,861 --> 00:40:42,553
Yes?

713
00:40:42,853 --> 00:40:44,872
"<i>I can't refill it without
another prescription</i>."

714
00:40:46,625 --> 00:40:47,351
I see.

715
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:49,280
Well, just let it go.

716
00:40:49,568 --> 00:40:51,022
<i>Let it go?</i>"

717
00:40:52,106 --> 00:40:54,260
That is until I talk with Dr Grahame.
- "<i>Oh</i>."

718
00:40:55,274 --> 00:40:59,498
"<i>By the way, according to my records you
got prescription filled the other day</i>."

719
00:40:59,903 --> 00:41:02,349
But my husband knocked that bottle
over on the tray and spilled it.

720
00:41:02,584 --> 00:41:03,227
"<i>Oh?</i>"

721
00:41:03,733 --> 00:41:05,664
"<i>You didn't tell me that
when you called before</i>."

722
00:41:05,945 --> 00:41:08,616
But that's what happened. I promise you.
That's what happened, Mr Philips.

723
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,804
"<i>Alright, alright, Mrs Jones</i>."

724
00:41:11,434 --> 00:41:13,051
"<i>You don't have to promise anything</i>."

725
00:41:13,151 --> 00:41:15,455
I didn't tell you before as I
didn't think it was necessary.

726
00:41:15,555 --> 00:41:16,668
"<i>You mean it wasn't?</i>"

727
00:41:17,108 --> 00:41:18,266
"<i>Look here, Mrs Jones</i>."

728
00:41:20,438 --> 00:41:22,758
"<i>George said the Mr Philips would
be a witness against me</i>."

729
00:41:23,258 --> 00:41:24,295
"<i>A witness</i>."

730
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,779
I'll see that you get
another prescription.

731
00:41:32,085 --> 00:41:33,901
"<i>Yes, you just get in
touch with Dr Grahame</i>."

732
00:41:35,419 --> 00:41:37,674
"<i>Why didn't I tell him about George?</i>"

733
00:41:45,634 --> 00:41:46,506
"<i>The letter</i>."

734
00:41:47,308 --> 00:41:48,724
"<i>I had to get that letter back</i>."

735
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:52,907
"<i>I couldn't tell anyone about
George until I got that letter back</i>."

736
00:41:54,195 --> 00:41:56,193
"<i>I could feel the woman
next door watching</i>."

737
00:41:57,867 --> 00:42:00,122
"<i>Maybe she'd be a
witness against me too</i>."

738
00:42:00,849 --> 00:42:03,519
"<i>She could tell them how
I ran out of the house</i>."

739
00:42:04,117 --> 00:42:05,466
"<i>And then back in again</i>."

740
00:42:06,189 --> 00:42:07,751
"<i>How strangely I was acting</i>."

741
00:42:10,023 --> 00:42:12,929
"<i>It wouldn't matter what she thought
if I could only get that letter back</i>."

742
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:16,806
"<i>Then I tried to think.
Which way did he go?</i>"

743
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:38,544
What's that for, Tex?

744
00:42:39,066 --> 00:42:39,852
Who knows?

745
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:42,089
The engine needs everything
we can put in it.

746
00:42:42,189 --> 00:42:43,449
Yeah, but what will it do?

747
00:42:44,037 --> 00:42:44,823
Who cares?

748
00:42:45,283 --> 00:42:46,169
Pardon me.

749
00:42:46,642 --> 00:42:48,630
Can you tell me, did the
postman go by here yet?

750
00:42:48,894 --> 00:42:49,995
The postman?
- Yeah.

751
00:42:50,388 --> 00:42:52,880
That old oddball found his way
through here a little while ago.

752
00:42:53,129 --> 00:42:54,902
Oh. Which way did he go? Do you know?

753
00:42:55,859 --> 00:42:57,373
Thataway.
- Oh, thanks.

754
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:00,609
The way toward Merritt Street. You know?
- Yeah, I know.

755
00:43:06,687 --> 00:43:07,685
Oh, I'm sorry.

756
00:43:17,782 --> 00:43:20,793
You know, every time I go home
at night I always tell my wife Laura.

757
00:43:21,221 --> 00:43:24,521
If it wasn't for that pension
plan I do I'd just never get up.

758
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:27,459
I'd just drop in my tracks one of
these days and that would settle it.

759
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,810
And I'd just never get up
anymore and that's all.

760
00:43:30,178 --> 00:43:31,869
You know how it is.
- Hello, Mr Carson.

761
00:43:32,536 --> 00:43:34,105
See you later, Joe.
- See you later.

762
00:43:34,406 --> 00:43:37,162
Well, Moss Jones. What are
you doing out this way?

763
00:43:38,431 --> 00:43:40,465
I was visiting a friend.
- Oh, that's nice.

764
00:43:40,796 --> 00:43:42,936
I wish I had more time for visitors.

765
00:43:43,327 --> 00:43:46,652
But by the time I get home at night I
can just hardly make it up the stairs.

766
00:43:47,603 --> 00:43:50,029
Mr Carston, remember that
letter I gave you this morning?

767
00:43:50,585 --> 00:43:53,227
I suppose so. I pick up plenty
of letters. Why, what about it?

768
00:43:53,472 --> 00:43:55,171
Well, I know it seems silly but I ..

769
00:43:55,965 --> 00:43:58,145
I mailed it by mistake.
It wasn't even finished. Yes.

770
00:43:58,245 --> 00:43:59,567
What did you do that for?

771
00:43:59,667 --> 00:44:01,490
I don't know, I guess
I was just so busy I ..

772
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:04,886
Finish it up and mail the rest tomorrow.
They'll get it in two instalments.

773
00:44:05,113 --> 00:44:06,529
You wouldn't want me to do that.

774
00:44:06,968 --> 00:44:08,492
May I have the letter please?

775
00:44:10,705 --> 00:44:13,523
So, I pick them up and carry them around
for miles and then they want them back.

776
00:44:13,865 --> 00:44:15,989
Well, I'm sorry but you
can understand why.

777
00:44:16,245 --> 00:44:18,543
I wouldn't want it to go out unfinished.
- Yeah, I guess so.

778
00:44:18,731 --> 00:44:21,520
But all these delays count. Keep me
on my feet longer than I ought to.

779
00:44:21,787 --> 00:44:23,573
It won't be much trouble will it?

780
00:44:23,942 --> 00:44:25,329
Here. Here it is.
- Thank you.

781
00:44:25,466 --> 00:44:28,224
Now look, you shouldn't have given
me this letter in the first place.

782
00:44:28,428 --> 00:44:29,160
Why?

783
00:44:29,371 --> 00:44:32,331
Giving me this letter is just
like putting it in a mailbox.

784
00:44:32,521 --> 00:44:35,382
Now, you wouldn't expect to get this
back from the mailbox would you?

785
00:44:36,224 --> 00:44:38,995
No. But surely you can make
this exception. After all, I ..

786
00:44:41,563 --> 00:44:44,059
Isn't this fellow the district attorney?

787
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:45,754
Yes.

788
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:49,293
Yes. My husband read about
some graft in the newspaper.

789
00:44:49,393 --> 00:44:51,274
And wrote to the district
attorney about it.

790
00:44:51,452 --> 00:44:53,494
Oh, your husband wrote the letter?
- Yes.

791
00:44:53,747 --> 00:44:55,203
I thought you said you wrote it.

792
00:44:55,786 --> 00:44:57,654
Well, what's the difference?
He is my husband.

793
00:44:57,754 --> 00:44:59,909
It makes all the difference
in the world, Mrs Jones.

794
00:45:00,187 --> 00:45:02,182
But why?
- It's one of our strictest rules.

795
00:45:02,605 --> 00:45:05,637
We can't return a letter to anyone
except the person who wrote it.

796
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:08,699
But Mr Carston, my husband
is sick. You know that.

797
00:45:08,976 --> 00:45:11,164
And he sent me to get the letter back.
- Yes. I know that.

798
00:45:11,462 --> 00:45:12,778
Don't be so obstinate!

799
00:45:12,878 --> 00:45:14,800
You know it's alright.
He's sick. Give it to me.

800
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,445
Obstinate? Now how do you like that?

801
00:45:16,867 --> 00:45:19,904
After standing here patiently in all
this heat trying to reason with you.

802
00:45:20,576 --> 00:45:24,014
You are the one being obstinate and
don't realise it's against the rules.

803
00:45:24,114 --> 00:45:25,905
What do you care if
it's against the rules?

804
00:45:26,005 --> 00:45:27,657
I have to care but you don't.

805
00:45:28,346 --> 00:45:29,876
You are not the one who'd get fired.

806
00:45:32,125 --> 00:45:32,911
I'm sorry.

807
00:45:33,252 --> 00:45:34,563
I'm very sorry, Mr Carston.

808
00:45:34,848 --> 00:45:37,380
I forgot what it means to you.
Your responsibility.

809
00:45:38,543 --> 00:45:39,933
It must be this terrible heat.

810
00:45:40,724 --> 00:45:41,478
Please.

811
00:45:41,867 --> 00:45:44,060
I know how anxious my husband
is to get that letter back.

812
00:45:45,003 --> 00:45:47,027
It was my fault you see,
I mailed it by mistake.

813
00:45:47,548 --> 00:45:50,196
He's awfully with me. He is
very angry with me, Mr Carston.

814
00:45:50,726 --> 00:45:52,027
Couldn't you please help me?

815
00:45:52,478 --> 00:45:54,153
Couldn't I please have the letter back?

816
00:45:55,108 --> 00:45:57,274
Well, I tell you what I'll do.
- Yes?

817
00:45:58,038 --> 00:46:00,501
I'm all through with the route
until this afternoon's delivery.

818
00:46:00,764 --> 00:46:02,895
Since it is so important like you say.
- Oh, it is.

819
00:46:03,429 --> 00:46:06,892
If you give me a lift to town in your
car so I won't lose any more time ..

820
00:46:06,992 --> 00:46:07,709
I will.

821
00:46:07,809 --> 00:46:10,964
I'll go to your house with you now and
give the letter to Mr Jones personally.

822
00:46:12,004 --> 00:46:13,953
No, you can't.
- But, Mrs Jones ..

823
00:46:14,154 --> 00:46:17,013
This way I'll be sticking to the rules
and your husband gets his letter back.

824
00:46:17,314 --> 00:46:18,930
But my husband didn't sleep last night.

825
00:46:19,278 --> 00:46:21,809
And he fell asleep just before I left
and I wouldn't want to wake him.

826
00:46:22,069 --> 00:46:24,251
I'm trying to do the right thing
by everybody concerned.

827
00:46:24,687 --> 00:46:28,305
It seems you cannot cooperate. I'm not
risking losing my job for anybody.

828
00:46:28,405 --> 00:46:31,442
Try to understand.
- I can't talk about it any longer.

829
00:46:31,672 --> 00:46:32,935
I can't waste more time.

830
00:46:33,035 --> 00:46:35,681
Do you want me to take the letter to
your husband personally or don't you?

831
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:37,246
No.

832
00:46:37,364 --> 00:46:39,985
Alright then. I'll take it to the
post office like I'm supposed to.

833
00:46:40,406 --> 00:46:42,920
You can go down there and
get it from the superintendent.

834
00:46:43,262 --> 00:46:44,617
Superintendent?
- Yeah.

835
00:46:44,816 --> 00:46:47,126
He has more authority than I have.
Maybe he'll give it to you.

836
00:46:47,226 --> 00:46:48,003
I see.

837
00:46:48,103 --> 00:46:49,695
You'd better not waste any more time.

838
00:46:49,905 --> 00:46:52,463
Once I bring the mail in
they send it out right quick.

839
00:46:52,687 --> 00:46:55,402
Once it leaves the post office
for delivery nobody can stop it.

840
00:46:55,502 --> 00:46:57,000
The post office downtown?
- Yep.

841
00:46:57,116 --> 00:46:58,595
Thanks. Oh, Mr Carston.

842
00:46:59,125 --> 00:47:00,913
How do I get there?
The shortest way I mean.

843
00:47:01,013 --> 00:47:03,195
Right down the boulevard
is the shortest. Can't miss it.

844
00:47:03,295 --> 00:47:04,723
Thanks. How much time do I have?

845
00:47:05,186 --> 00:47:07,417
About 2:30. Maybe a little over 4.

846
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:08,713
Thank you.

847
00:47:44,225 --> 00:47:45,071
Ellen.

848
00:47:46,545 --> 00:47:47,512
Ellen!

849
00:48:37,942 --> 00:48:38,728
Pardon me.

850
00:48:39,315 --> 00:48:39,970
Yes?

851
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:41,980
Have you seen Mrs Jones this morning?

852
00:48:42,473 --> 00:48:44,914
Yes. She went out about a half hour ago.

853
00:48:45,112 --> 00:48:46,341
Went out?
- Yes.

854
00:48:46,671 --> 00:48:48,473
But what about George? Mr Jones?

855
00:48:48,755 --> 00:48:50,642
She hasn't gone off and
left him alone has she?

856
00:48:51,196 --> 00:48:52,905
Well ..
- Her husband is sick you know.

857
00:48:53,403 --> 00:48:54,304
So I've heard.

858
00:48:55,159 --> 00:48:57,736
If course I never really met them.
Though I haven't lived here long.

859
00:48:57,943 --> 00:48:59,895
I can't imagine her going off like that.

860
00:49:00,966 --> 00:49:05,003
I'm, Mr Jones' aunt. I made him some
jelly consomm. I packed it in ice.

861
00:49:05,663 --> 00:49:06,585
It's melting.

862
00:49:06,837 --> 00:49:09,025
I never dreamt I wouldn't get in.

863
00:49:09,812 --> 00:49:11,285
I could tell you where the key is.

864
00:49:11,746 --> 00:49:12,528
Key?

865
00:49:12,807 --> 00:49:16,359
Perhaps you think it's nosy but I did
see her when she locked the door.

866
00:49:16,948 --> 00:49:18,278
Well, isn't that good of you.

867
00:49:18,867 --> 00:49:20,298
The front door?
- Yes.

868
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:22,279
Right over there above the door.

869
00:49:22,684 --> 00:49:23,470
Thank you.

870
00:49:23,925 --> 00:49:26,190
I don't know how you stand
it in the sun without a hat on.

871
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:27,648
You might dry up like a prune.

872
00:49:32,722 --> 00:49:35,201
The top of the green shutter.
The far side of the door.

873
00:49:36,809 --> 00:49:37,746
I've found it.

874

do for you just call me.

877
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,145
Ellen, where on earth have you been?

878
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:26,370
Have you been upstairs?

879
00:50:26,558 --> 00:50:28,933
I was just going up.
Why are you so out of breath?

880
00:50:30,088 --> 00:50:30,771
Why?

881
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:32,645
I've been running.

882
00:50:32,745 --> 00:50:35,023
Running in all this heat?
You should have more sense.

883
00:50:36,251 --> 00:50:38,619
How did you get in, aunt Clara?
- I found the key on the ledge.

884
00:50:38,993 --> 00:50:41,218
There, look at that.
Slipped right down my dress.

885
00:50:41,641 --> 00:50:42,624
Now it's ruined.

886
00:50:42,955 --> 00:50:45,412
I was worried half to death.
I thought something had happened.

887
00:50:46,402 --> 00:50:48,118
I've never known you
to go out like this.

888
00:50:48,308 --> 00:50:49,209
How is George?

889
00:50:49,528 --> 00:50:50,431
He's alright.

890
00:50:50,531 --> 00:50:52,512
I even rang the bell. Just a jab.

891
00:50:53,127 --> 00:50:54,628
Did he take one of those sedatives?

892
00:50:54,824 --> 00:50:55,455
Yes.

893
00:50:55,686 --> 00:50:58,005
People take too much medicine
nowadays if you ask me.

894
00:50:58,591 --> 00:51:01,201
When I was a girl we
had homeopathic doctors.

895
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:03,137
I wonder what happened to them.

896
00:51:03,237 --> 00:51:06,260
Anyway, they gave very little medicine
and it all tasted good, even the tonics.

897
00:51:06,624 --> 00:51:08,339
And no promises at all.

898
00:51:08,707 --> 00:51:10,781
Ellen, I've never seen you
look so tired and worn out.

899
00:51:10,881 --> 00:51:12,841
Why not ask that doctor
to give you something?

900
00:51:12,941 --> 00:51:13,784
I'm alright.

901
00:51:14,179 --> 00:51:16,123
He looks too young to
me to be a good doctor.

902
00:51:16,223 --> 00:51:18,239
But after all, if you and
George like him so much ..

903
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,902
Confidence is half the battle.

904
00:51:20,324 --> 00:51:21,835
You look awful peaky.

905
00:51:22,291 --> 00:51:24,193
Ellen, you are not letting
yourself go, are you?

906
00:51:24,513 --> 00:51:26,156
No. I know I look terrible.

907
00:51:27,226 --> 00:51:28,804

908
00:51:29,574 --> 00:51:30,831
I had some errands to do.

909
00:51:32,724 --> 00:51:33,780
I'll get you some.

910

I just thought I would go and
take care of them without ..

911

912

913
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:43,276
Yes.

914
00:51:43,376 --> 00:51:46,576
Why not go upstairs and lie down for a
bit. Take a snooze. It will do you good.

915
00:51:47,273 --> 00:51:49,004
I'm not tired. Really I'm not.

916
00:51:49,512 --> 00:51:51,193
Well, after all.

917
00:51:52,132 --> 00:51:53,874
Clara, I have so much to do today.

918

know it if you don't watch out.

921

After all, all I want to do is to help.

922
00:52:04,864 --> 00:52:06,793
From now on, I'm going
to have more time too.

923
00:52:07,122 --> 00:52:08,647
Ellen, I forgot to tell you.

924
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:09,894
I resigned.

925

Resigned?

926
00:52:11,732 --> 00:52:15,047
From the Helper's Guild after fifteen
years. I'm not helping anymore.

927
00:52:17,197 --> 00:52:17,955
I will ..

928
00:52:18,283 --> 00:52:21,617
I'll leave the kitchen door open and we
can talk as I clean out there. Alright?

929
00:52:21,717 --> 00:52:23,292
You might as well. You're so fidgety.

930
00:52:24,161 --> 00:52:27,391
Oh, Ellen. While you are on your
feet will you bring me a dishcloth?

931
00:52:28,621 --> 00:52:30,774
For fifteen years I was in that guild.

932
00:52:31,131 --> 00:52:32,952
And for the past five I was treasurer.

933
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:36,206
And for the last three they were
promising me the presidency.

934
00:52:36,619 --> 00:52:37,605
So, what happens?

935
00:52:37,765 --> 00:52:39,711
Last Tuesday they elect Paula Comstock.

936
00:52:39,811 --> 00:52:41,637
You know, Zachary's wife?
Well I was furious.

937
00:52:41,835 --> 00:52:44,562
Zachary said I was hasty.
But after fifteen years ..

938
00:52:44,868 --> 00:52:47,000
You know, I've never known
a small woman yet ..

her little hands and tiny feet.

Fifteen years, after all.

943
00:52:55,424 --> 00:52:58,629
Zachary was upset. He says I
need lots of outside activity. Lots.

944
00:52:58,882 --> 00:53:00,226
And I agreed with him.

945

"<i>I thought if she
didn't stop I'd scream</i>."

946
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,622

too much at his age.

947
00:53:11,936 --> 00:53:14,339
That's just one of the worries of
being married to an older man.

948
00:53:14,557 --> 00:53:16,849
Ellen, why don't you have
some of that jelly consomm?

949
00:53:16,949 --> 00:53:20,960
At least it was jelly when I left home.
Try it. It's tasty and full of vitamins.

950
00:53:21,435 --> 00:53:24,150
I'd like someone to enjoy it.
After all it ruined my dress.

him later that I peeped in.

Don't.

George when you came in.

But you don't understand.
- Oh yes. I understand.

963

I'll just say goodbye to him.
No. Please don't.

I didn't want to tell you this but ..

965
00:54:09,289 --> 00:54:12,820
George said that the last time you came
to see him you upset him terribly.

966
00:54:13,032 --> 00:54:15,879
And he said to tell you that if you came
again today to tell you that he just ..

Couldn't see you.

- Upset him?

970
00:54:20,597 --> 00:54:22,642
I've a good mind to tell him something.

even before he was sick.

And he is rude and selfish

something for him. Change him somehow.

he'd think no-one was home and go away."

Yes?

1020
00:58:05,418 --> 00:58:07,550
Good afternoon. I'm Mr Russell.
- Yes?

1021
00:58:08,057 --> 00:58:10,368
I'd like to see Mr Jones.
He is expecting me.

1022
00:58:11,371 --> 00:58:12,753
Expecting you?
- Yes.

1023
00:58:13,016 --> 00:58:14,424
He telephoned me the other day.

1024
00:58:16,033 --> 00:58:17,477
Well, there must be some mistake.

1025
00:58:17,850 --> 00:58:19,161
My husband is not well.

He isn't able to leave his bed.

1027
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:24,126
He told me he was ill but he did
telephone to be here this afternoon.

1028
00:58:24,534 --> 00:58:26,608
Well, nevertheless he isn't
well enough to see anyone.

1029
00:58:27,372 --> 00:58:29,375
It's a business matter, Mrs Jones.
- I'm sorry.

1030
00:58:30,556 --> 00:58:32,372
But the doctor has forbade
him to see anyone.

1031
00:58:32,636 --> 00:58:34,780
He warned me that I would get
some resistance from you.

1032
00:58:35,834 --> 00:58:36,625
He did?

1033
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,229
He explained that you were over
solicitous about his health ..

1034
00:58:39,329 --> 00:58:41,340
But that I wasn't to take you seriously.
- Oh.

1035
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:44,533
Your husband only wants me to
authenticate some legal papers.

1037
00:58:46,047 --> 00:58:48,848
It won't take but a few minutes.
- Sorry. I told you he isn't very well.

1038
00:58:50,072 --> 00:58:51,116
He's had a relapse.

1039

The doctor just left
here a few minutes ago.

1040
00:58:53,538 --> 00:58:55,940
And he said he wasn't able to
see anyone today. Not anyone.

1041

Sorry to have bothered you, Miss Jones.
- Oh, that's alright.

It was brought in just a little while
ago and wasn't even processed yet.

- Oh.

You mean I can't take
the letter with me now?

Just take the form home to Mr Jones.
Have him fill it out and ..

01:01:29,318 --> 01:01:31,964
When you bring it back I'll have the
letter here and I can give it to you.

1082
01:01:32,803 --> 01:01:33,446
Look.

1083
01:01:34,277 --> 01:01:35,656
But why is that necessary?

1084
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:37,406

to compare Mr Jones' handwriting ..

I can assure you it is my
husband's handwriting.

1088
01:01:44,479 --> 01:01:45,637
I'm sure it is.
- Yes.

1089
01:01:45,831 --> 01:01:48,365
But I must have one of
those forms for my records.

But ..

1092
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:54,587
But my husband has been very ill.

1093
01:01:55,164 --> 01:01:56,437
And everything bothers him.

1094
01:01:57,521 --> 01:02:00,673
And if I don't have this letter for him
when I go home he'll be awfully upset.

1095
01:02:00,864 --> 01:02:01,765
Why should he?

I am afraid that ..

1098
01:02:05,728 --> 01:02:07,530
He said a lot of very
strong things and ..

1099
01:02:08,113 --> 01:02:09,192
He regrets them now.

1100
01:02:10,563 --> 01:02:13,117
You can explain to him
that it won't be delivered.

1101
01:02:13,311 --> 01:02:15,140
It'll be held here until
the form comes back.

1102
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:18,677
Yes. But it is so hard to reason
with a person who is ill.

1103

Well, you know how it is.

1104

They exaggerate the
importance of everything.

And what with his heart condition
I wouldn't want to take a chance.

1106
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:31,755

for him when I go home now.

1109

I'll let you fill out the
form for your husband.

1110
01:02:42,076 --> 01:02:43,935
That's very nice of you.
- On one condition.

1111
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:47,622
I of course must make sure
of the contents of the letter.

1112
01:02:48,090 --> 01:02:49,076
What do you mean?

1113
01:02:49,273 --> 01:02:52,312
It will be strictly confidential but
the letter must be opened and read.

1114
01:02:54,021 --> 01:02:55,000
Open the letter?

1115
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:58,104
Yes. To make sure that it is the letter
to the district attorney as you say.

1116
01:02:58,283 --> 01:02:59,184
No. You can't!

1117
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:02,106
I won't have anyone prying
into my husband's mail.

1118
01:03:02,206 --> 01:03:02,942
Prying?

1119
01:03:03,042 --> 01:03:04,801

you if you'd let me finish ..

That <i>I </i>would call your husband for you.

1123

Explain the issue and ask his permission
for you to open the letter, not me.

I'm sorry.

1125
01:03:21,183 --> 01:03:23,278
I'm very Sorry.
I didn't mean to say that.

1126

But you don't seem to understand.

1127
01:03:27,329 --> 01:03:29,562
No. I don't understand, Mrs Jones.

1128
01:03:30,502 --> 01:03:35,003
And I have no alternative but to send
the letter on to the distributing room.

Is there something I can do for you?

1141
01:04:49,641 --> 01:04:51,948
Of course I know you are anxious
to get up to your husband.

1142
01:04:52,158 --> 01:04:54,295
So you run up and see if he
is comfortable and settled.

1143
01:04:54,815 --> 01:04:55,859

[ Doorbell ]

1165
01:06:23,996 --> 01:06:26,124
Doctor, I just called your
office and told the nurse ..

1166

What is it?

1167
01:06:27,849 --> 01:06:28,492
Well.

1168

George told me he wanted
to consult another doctor.

And I did too. And he just left and ..

01:07:09,371 --> 01:07:10,423
I don't know.

1183
01:07:11,335 --> 01:07:13,507
Really. George feels much
better. I'll call you tomorrow.

1184
01:07:13,607 --> 01:07:15,438
Now wait a minute.
What's happened really?

1185
01:07:15,784 --> 01:07:17,007
Well, you see.

1186
01:07:18,028 --> 01:07:18,735
After.

1187
01:07:20,658 --> 01:07:22,460
No, no! Please don't. Please!

1188
01:07:22,911 --> 01:07:25,754
Don't go up there. It's better for
everybody if you just don't go up there.

1189
01:07:31,871 --> 01:07:32,641
Ellen.

1190
01:07:34,256 --> 01:07:34,899
It ..

1191
01:07:35,608 --> 01:07:36,727
Is he dead?

1192
01:07:38,105 --> 01:07:38,793
Yes.

1193
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:40,431
Yes.

1194
01:07:41,697 --> 01:07:42,735
He had a gun.

1195
01:07:42,955 --> 01:07:44,303
He tried to kill me but ..

1196
01:07:44,851 --> 01:07:46,162
Before I could shoot he ..

1197
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:47,899
He ..

1198
01:07:49,011 --> 01:07:50,100
Take it easy.

1199
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:11,175
And so I took the gun out of
his hand. And then I hid it.

1200
01:09:11,786 --> 01:09:15,100
I had to. It looked as though he had
died protecting himself from me.

1201
01:09:15,479 --> 01:09:17,381
Alright, Ellen. But why
didn't you want me here?

1202
01:09:18,686 --> 01:09:20,247
I don't know how to tell you.

1203
01:09:22,216 --> 01:09:25,247
That letter said that we
planned his death together.

1204
01:09:25,625 --> 01:09:27,413
That you told me to
aggravate his condition.

1205
01:09:27,803 --> 01:09:29,594
To give him overdoses
of his heart medicine.

1206
01:09:30,235 --> 01:09:32,130
And if they come here
and find you here ..

1207
01:09:32,307 --> 01:09:34,128
They'll think it's true
just as George said.

1208
01:09:34,228 --> 01:09:36,534
Ellen, his mind was going.
I tried to tell you this morning.

1209
01:09:36,634 --> 01:09:38,984
He wasn't responsible.
- They won't believe me.

1210
01:09:39,761 --> 01:09:40,690
How could they?

1211
01:09:41,498 --> 01:09:44,158
I did everything wrong. Everything.
Just like he said I would.

1212
01:09:44,925 --> 01:09:47,385
The druggist and then the postman
and then the superintendent.

1213
01:09:47,485 --> 01:09:48,803
I even lied to his aunt.

1214
01:09:49,289 --> 01:09:51,859
They'll think I was guilty. All of them.
- You are not guilty, Ellen.

1215
01:09:52,043 --> 01:09:53,705
Remember that.
- I know.

1216
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:57,482
The police will be here any minute.
You'd better go. Better go right now.

1217
01:09:57,839 --> 01:09:59,022
[ Doorbell ]

1218
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:02,333
Ellen, where are you going?

1219
01:10:03,717 --> 01:10:04,989
I don't know.

1220
01:10:05,609 --> 01:10:08,001
There is no sense in running
away now. Go to the door.

1221
01:10:11,096 --> 01:10:11,802
Ellen.

1222
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,069
Go to the door.

1223
01:10:25,367 --> 01:10:26,353
Hello, Mrs Jones.

1224
01:10:26,568 --> 01:10:29,262
I got a letter for you this afternoon.

1225
01:10:29,653 --> 01:10:31,346
I didn't put it in the slot because ..

1226
01:10:32,057 --> 01:10:32,700
What?

1227
01:10:32,921 --> 01:10:35,512
I guess I should feel kinda
funny coming here like this.

1228
01:10:36,132 --> 01:10:38,170
After what happened between
you and me this noon.

1229
01:10:38,977 --> 01:10:40,877
But it is alright. I understand.

1230
01:10:42,047 --> 01:10:44,063
Here is the letter you gave
me to mail this morning.

1231
01:10:46,839 --> 01:10:47,482
What?

1232
01:10:47,891 --> 01:10:49,675
A surprise.
I didn't realise it at first.

1233
01:10:49,854 --> 01:10:51,703
A thick letter like that
and only one stamp.

1234
01:10:52,886 --> 01:10:56,999
Those public officials like the district
attorney won't accept postage-due mail.

1235
01:10:58,408 --> 01:10:59,797
"<i>Insufficient postage</i>."

1236
01:11:00,253 --> 01:11:03,522
Yeah, the other end just won't
pay the postage in these cases ..

1237
01:11:03,622 --> 01:11:06,572
And we have to return them to
the senders. How do you like that?

1238
01:11:06,902 --> 01:11:09,331
Not enough postage and we
have to deliver them twice.

1239
01:11:09,597 --> 01:11:11,244
Yes.
- A crazy business.

1240
01:11:11,777 --> 01:11:13,600
You know, some folks
might think I'm stingy.

1241
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:16,949
I know these extra stamps
cost only just a few cents but ..

1242
01:11:17,193 --> 01:11:18,397
Yes, I understand.

1243
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:21,749
The same for you as everybody else.
- Yes, I understand it.

1244
01:11:22,172 --> 01:11:25,245
Thanks again for the letter, Mr Carston.
- That's alright, Goodbye.

1245
01:11:25,452 --> 01:11:28,226
Thanks again Mr Carston for bringing it.
- You're welcome.

1246
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:37,238
0h .. it is so funny.

1247
01:11:39,591 --> 01:11:40,949
Go ahead. It will do you good.

1248
01:11:47,727 --> 01:11:48,695
You know, I ..

1249
01:11:50,328 --> 01:11:51,827
I tried so hard.

1250
01:11:52,595 --> 01:11:54,586
So hard to get it back.

1251
01:11:56,398 --> 01:11:57,470
It's alright, Ellen.

1252
01:11:57,882 --> 01:11:58,834
You got it now.

1253
01:12:43,934 --> 01:12:47,475
"<i>And then I knew what people meant
when they said their heart was broken</i>."

1254
01:12:49,108 --> 01:12:51,760
"<i>All that was left of George
and me and our marriage</i>."

1255
01:12:53,497 --> 01:12:55,364
"<i>Was that little pile of ashes</i>."

1256
01:12:57,751 --> 01:13:00,734
"<i>I knew that some way or somehow
I would have to begin to live again</i>."

1257
01:13:02,145 --> 01:13:03,404
"<i>But right then</i>."

1258
01:13:03,751 --> 01:13:06,205
"<i>All I could do was pray
to lose that one day</i>."

1259
01:13:07,538 --> 01:13:09,610
"<i>That one terrifying day</i>."

1260
01:13:35,461 --> 01:13:36,306
-(s-d)-
