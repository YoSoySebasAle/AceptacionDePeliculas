1
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:30,418
Ahhh.

2
00:03:29,936 --> 00:03:32,981
Mr. Martin.
Mr. Martin.

3
00:03:33,064 --> 00:03:34,482
Mr. Martin, come quick.

4
00:03:34,566 --> 00:03:36,276
There's a man
up at my place.
Take it easy.

5
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:38,445
No time to take it easy.
You've got to come right away.

6
00:03:38,528 --> 00:03:41,072
You know, Eli, in all the months
I've been on this job,

7
00:03:41,156 --> 00:03:44,117
there hasn't been one week
you haven't had three
or four people

8
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,660
skulking around your place.
But listen...

9
00:03:45,744 --> 00:03:47,704
You got money
in your mattress or something?

10
00:03:47,787 --> 00:03:50,749
This man wasn't skulking.
He was, I don't know what,

11
00:03:50,832 --> 00:03:52,333
staggering around like
he was lost.

12
00:03:52,417 --> 00:03:54,169
Maybe it was just
his weekend that get lost.

13
00:03:54,252 --> 00:03:56,713
Mr. Martin,
this man ain't drunk.

14
00:04:03,762 --> 00:04:05,263
If he's not.
She sure is.

15
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:08,016
Deputy, I'm telling you,
this fellow's different.

16
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,101
Well, you keep him
that way, Eli.

17
00:04:10,185 --> 00:04:11,853
I'll drop in on you
on my way back.

18
00:06:35,872 --> 00:06:36,873
Hello there.

19
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:44,923
You could have
ended up like that.

20
00:07:05,652 --> 00:07:07,362
Officer,

21
00:07:08,738 --> 00:07:10,406
I know
there's no excuse.

22
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,992
I agree with you.
May I have your...

23
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,707
I was going pretty fast,
wasn't I?

24
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,876
You were going
pretty reckless too.

25
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,503
You know,
this is an old road.

26
00:07:23,586 --> 00:07:26,839
It's tricky and dangerous,
it's lined with signs

27
00:07:26,923 --> 00:07:29,926
that say 25 miles an hour,
15 miles an hour,

28
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:32,428
"Winding road."

29
00:07:32,512 --> 00:07:34,430
Now, those signs
can be quite interesting

30
00:07:34,514 --> 00:07:36,808
if you're going slow enough
to read them.

31
00:07:37,976 --> 00:07:40,144
I've read them
all before.

32
00:07:40,228 --> 00:07:43,314
What do you think
we put them up for, pedestrians?

33
00:07:43,398 --> 00:07:45,191
Can you give me one good reason

34
00:07:45,274 --> 00:07:48,611
why any sane person would drive
the way you were driving?

35
00:07:48,695 --> 00:07:49,696
No.

36
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:52,907
You surprise me.
I was sure you would.

37
00:07:52,991 --> 00:07:55,785
Well, actually, Officer,
I'm maladjusted.

38
00:07:55,868 --> 00:07:57,495
I come from
a broken home.

39
00:07:58,496 --> 00:08:00,248
Want me to write
that down for the judge?

40
00:08:00,331 --> 00:08:02,709
You're not going to
throw the book at me,
are you?

41
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:05,461
Well, here's what
I'm going to do.

42
00:08:05,545 --> 00:08:10,258
I'm going to reach into
the hat and pull out just
one of your violations.

43
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:14,220
Forty-five miles
an hour in a 25 zone.

44
00:08:15,638 --> 00:08:17,473
Sign there, please?

45
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:30,153
Here's your copy.

46
00:08:37,535 --> 00:08:40,635
I'll save the reckless
driving charge for next time.

47
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:10,893
Operator! Operator!

48
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:12,736
The sheriff's office, quick!

49
00:10:23,212 --> 00:10:25,308
Sure looks like he put up
quite a struggle.

50
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,068
Yeah.

51
00:10:27,151 --> 00:10:29,079
Be sure and don't touch
any of this stuff, Eli.

52
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,509
Don't worry. I know
all about these things.

53
00:10:33,688 --> 00:10:36,119
No identification
of any kind.

54
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:38,171
No wallet.
Labels all cut out
of the clothing.

55
00:10:38,255 --> 00:10:41,188
All we have for sure is
that he wasn't a suicide.
Ah.

56
00:10:41,272 --> 00:10:44,205
Not with his hands tied
behind his back.

57
00:10:44,289 --> 00:10:47,222
You should have listened to me.
I told you to come up right away.

58
00:10:47,306 --> 00:10:48,814
Now, Eli.

59
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,993
Remember the story
about the boy who cried wolf.

60
00:10:51,077 --> 00:10:52,963
Don't you go trying
to put the blame on me, Sheriff.

61
00:10:53,047 --> 00:10:54,974
Nobody's blaming anybody, Eli.

62
00:10:55,058 --> 00:10:57,950
If we followed up all your stories,
we'd have to put on two extra men.

63
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:00,631
Which, by the way,
you taxpayers won't let us have.

64
00:11:03,145 --> 00:11:05,198
You know, it's no wonder
old Eli lives alone.

65
00:11:05,283 --> 00:11:07,628
No woman could stand
to listen to him all the time.

66
00:11:07,713 --> 00:11:10,101
I wish I'd listened
to him this once.

67
00:11:10,184 --> 00:11:13,621
There's not enough time in the day
to stop and measure all the ifs.

68
00:11:13,704 --> 00:11:15,212
You made the same choice I would

69
00:11:15,297 --> 00:11:17,517
and went after what you saw
instead of what you didn't see.

70
00:11:17,602 --> 00:11:19,194
That's what you're paid to do.

71
00:11:19,277 --> 00:11:22,211
I know that.
It doesn't make me
feel any better.

72
00:11:22,294 --> 00:11:24,431
If I'd gone with Eli,
that man might still be alive.

73
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:25,689
Now, look, boy.

74
00:11:25,772 --> 00:11:27,867
When I hired you,
I hired myself a good lawman.

75
00:11:27,951 --> 00:11:30,297
I didn't think about
what happened in Denver then.

76
00:11:30,382 --> 00:11:31,806
You stop thinking about it now.

77
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:38,134
You shout your mouth
and solve this case.

78
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,674
- Morning, Deputy.
- Morning.

79
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:10,147
Rising with the sun,
or just going to bed?

80
00:12:10,231 --> 00:12:12,146
Hoping to catch some worms.

81
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:15,021
I'm trying to get a line on a fellow.
Thought maybe you could help me.

82
00:12:15,104 --> 00:12:16,354
I'll do my best.

83
00:12:16,437 --> 00:12:19,769
Fellow about 55,
60 years old, tall,

84
00:12:19,852 --> 00:12:22,976
grayish hair,
distinguished-looking.

85
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:28,516
When last seen,
wearing a suit of thin,
dark gray shiny material.

86
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,682
Doesn't sound like
anybody I've seen.

87
00:12:31,557 --> 00:12:33,057
Thanks anyway.

88
00:12:34,223 --> 00:12:37,263
Oh, if he turns up, do you want me
to tell him you're looking for him?

89
00:12:37,347 --> 00:12:39,388
No, thanks.
He's turned up already.

90
00:12:50,426 --> 00:12:52,134
Oh, yeah, here it is.

91
00:12:52,218 --> 00:12:55,008
R.E. Wallace,
El Trovatore Motel.

92
00:12:55,091 --> 00:12:56,299
That's all?

93
00:12:56,382 --> 00:12:58,090
Well, that's all you asked me.

94
00:12:58,174 --> 00:13:00,590
Well, that's all you've got?
No permanent address or anything?

95
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:01,964
Nope.

96
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:04,339
Well, you must have asked
to see his driver's license.

97
00:13:04,422 --> 00:13:05,963
Why?

98
00:13:06,047 --> 00:13:09,378
Well, most people do
when they rent an automobile
to a perfect stranger.

99
00:13:09,462 --> 00:13:11,003
Oh, he didn't rent the heap.

100
00:13:11,086 --> 00:13:14,460
He bought it for a 150 bucks.
C.O.L. Cash on the line.

101
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,918
Well, registration?

102
00:13:17,001 --> 00:13:20,000
Oh, he hasn't gotten around
to fill that out yet.

103
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,875
Hey, look. You're the law.

104
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,373
What do you think? Should I
send it to him at the motel?

105
00:13:24,457 --> 00:13:26,332
No, send it to the county morgue.

106
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:09,984
Good morning.
Morning.

107
00:14:10,067 --> 00:14:12,567
Looks like it's going to be
another scorcher, don't it?

108
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:13,733
Yes, ma'am.

109
00:14:13,816 --> 00:14:16,024
Are you selling tickets
for the sheriff's rodeo,

110
00:14:16,107 --> 00:14:17,857
or are you
just raiding the place?

111
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,190
I wouldn't think of it.

112
00:14:19,273 --> 00:14:23,147
Just trying to track down
some information
on a Mr. R.E. Wallace.

113
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,146
Oh, yeah. Number 8.

114
00:14:25,229 --> 00:14:26,854
I don't think
he's here now, though.

115
00:14:26,937 --> 00:14:28,729
I don't see his old yellow car.

116
00:14:28,812 --> 00:14:30,728
You mind if I take a look
in his room?

117
00:14:30,811 --> 00:14:32,311
Why should I mind?

118
00:14:33,311 --> 00:14:35,643
Can you tell me anything
about this Mr. Wallace?

119
00:14:35,727 --> 00:14:37,934
Well, not an awful lot,
I'm afraid.

120
00:14:38,018 --> 00:14:39,392
He's been here
four or five days,

121
00:14:39,475 --> 00:14:42,183
but he's not gabby
like most of us.

122
00:14:42,266 --> 00:14:44,348
Very quiet,
fine-looking gentleman.

123
00:14:44,432 --> 00:14:48,972
I'd say a businessman of some sort,
probably from the east.

124
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,430
Has that funny way of talking.

125
00:14:51,513 --> 00:14:52,804
This is 8.

126
00:14:55,345 --> 00:14:56,428
What?

127
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,886
What in the world
could have happened?

128
00:14:58,969 --> 00:15:03,634
This is just awful.
Why everything's ruined !

129
00:15:03,718 --> 00:15:06,258
I'll certainly have plenty
to say to that Mr. Wallace.

130
00:15:06,341 --> 00:15:08,258
I don't think he did it, ma'am.

131
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:10,257
How can I ever
get it cleaned up?

132
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:14,433
Don't touch a thing, please,
as a favor to the state of Arizona.

133
00:15:23,369 --> 00:15:25,291
No label on this clothing either.

134
00:15:25,374 --> 00:15:27,253
Not even any laundry marks.

135
00:15:28,506 --> 00:15:30,510
All this expensive luggage.

136
00:15:30,595 --> 00:15:32,766
But no initials on it.
Nothing.

137
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,353
What does that mean to you?

138
00:15:34,436 --> 00:15:39,365
First I thought the killer
was trying to cover up
the identity of the victim.

139
00:15:39,448 --> 00:15:42,956
Now I think the victim
destroyed his own identification.

140
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:44,041
How do you figure that?

141
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:47,215
Any man who buys luggage
as expensive as this

142
00:15:47,299 --> 00:15:49,053
usually has his initials put on it.

143
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,976
Could be.

144
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,401
Could be, brother bloodhound.

145
00:15:55,484 --> 00:15:57,405
Don't just stand there.
He ain't treed yet.

146
00:15:57,488 --> 00:15:59,493
Get out and see
if you can pick up his track.

147
00:15:59,576 --> 00:16:04,504
It's sure funny how now,
when I got nothing to say to you,
you keep wanting me to talk.

148
00:16:04,587 --> 00:16:07,594
You've got to keep talking,
Eli, till I can make
some sense out of it.

149
00:16:07,678 --> 00:16:10,685
I can't remember crazy talk
when it don't make sense.

150
00:16:10,768 --> 00:16:12,773
Well, try. Think.
What else?

151
00:16:16,323 --> 00:16:18,035
Over.

152
00:16:18,118 --> 00:16:21,250
He did say something
about over the rim.

153
00:16:22,127 --> 00:16:25,009
Over the rim.
That must mean the Grand Canyon.

154
00:16:25,092 --> 00:16:29,226
Well, that narrows it down
to Arizona anyway.

155
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:32,693
Come on, Eli.
Did he say anything else
that you haven't told me?

156
00:16:32,777 --> 00:16:37,244
Well, but I'm not sure
I heard it right.

157
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,414
Come on.

158
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:42,131
It sounded like
"dancing in the bucket."

159
00:16:42,215 --> 00:16:44,260
Dancing in the bucket?
Uh-huh.

160
00:16:44,344 --> 00:16:46,474
At least that's what it sounded like.

161
00:16:46,975 --> 00:16:49,063
Got any idea what it could be?

162
00:16:50,274 --> 00:16:51,778
Over the rim.

163
00:16:52,863 --> 00:16:54,700
Dancing in the bucket.

164
00:16:57,081 --> 00:16:58,459
Bucket.

165
00:16:58,543 --> 00:16:59,796
Hey, wait a minute.

166
00:17:00,088 --> 00:17:08,098
You just keep your mouth shut.

167
00:18:32,421 --> 00:18:35,136
Hey, Jack! Over here!

168
00:18:38,602 --> 00:18:39,605
Mr. Ward?

169
00:18:39,688 --> 00:18:41,567
Yeah. Oh, hi, Deputy.

170
00:18:42,569 --> 00:18:44,658
Say, what do you call
that contraption out there?

171
00:18:44,741 --> 00:18:46,036
Tramcar.

172
00:18:47,873 --> 00:18:49,460
You see anything of him?

173
00:18:53,552 --> 00:18:55,181
Around here we call it
the dancing bucket.

174
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:58,188
Who's he looking for?

175
00:18:58,773 --> 00:18:59,775
Charlie Piper.

176
00:18:59,858 --> 00:19:02,572
Old Charlie's one of the guys
that works here. He's missing.

177
00:19:02,657 --> 00:19:03,826
What's he look like?

178
00:19:05,246 --> 00:19:07,793
He's about 30, maybe 35.

179
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,883
You seen anything
of a man about 60,

180
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:13,765
grayish hair, 5'11", well built?

181
00:19:13,849 --> 00:19:16,730
No. Nothing around here
but us chickens.

182
00:19:16,813 --> 00:19:20,405
You know what happened?
One time a guy did end up
down there.

183
00:19:20,488 --> 00:19:23,579
Can you imagine? He got so busy trying
to get his ladder working, he just...

184
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:26,627
walked right over the edge.

185
00:19:26,711 --> 00:19:28,757
How do you figure that?

186
00:19:28,841 --> 00:19:31,889
How long has old Charlie Piper
been missing?

187
00:19:31,972 --> 00:19:34,854
I don't know for sure.
He's a watchman around here
on the weekends.

188
00:19:34,937 --> 00:19:36,942
When we come on today,
he wasn't around.

189
00:19:37,026 --> 00:19:39,656
And you didn't think of
reporting this to the sheriff's office?

190
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,078
Hold on.
Don't take me in yet.

191
00:19:42,162 --> 00:19:44,877
We don't think nothing
of it around here,
when a guy's missing.

192
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,254
What do you mean?

193
00:19:46,339 --> 00:19:48,134
The work. Gets them.

194
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,473
See the bucket out there?

195
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:53,270
Well, that thing travels 9,000 feet
across that canyon

196
00:19:53,354 --> 00:19:55,359
to that cave on the other side.

197
00:19:56,027 --> 00:19:57,112
Inside that cave,

198
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,955
there's about 500,000 tons
of prehistoric bat guano.

199
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:03,043
Man, that's a lot of fertilizer.

200
00:20:04,588 --> 00:20:07,177
The only way
to get the stuff out's
in that bucket.

201
00:20:07,261 --> 00:20:10,518
I figure old Charlie
probably got tired
of shoveling the stuff

202
00:20:10,601 --> 00:20:12,731
and riding the bucket,
so he lit out.

203
00:20:12,815 --> 00:20:15,487
Next thing you know,
he'll be sending us postcards

204
00:20:15,571 --> 00:20:17,409
from Las Vegas or somewhere.

205
00:20:18,452 --> 00:20:19,994
Hey, Jack!

206
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,619
What about it?

207
00:20:22,703 --> 00:20:24,786
Bill, not a thing.

208
00:20:24,869 --> 00:20:26,869
All right, bring it on in.

209
00:20:27,452 --> 00:20:30,952
It's time we got back over
at the other side
and start hauling guano.

210
00:20:31,035 --> 00:20:33,077
I'll ride back over with you.

211
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,869
Have you searched
the other side yet?

212
00:20:34,952 --> 00:20:38,160
Nothing over there
but that cave and the cliff

213
00:20:38,244 --> 00:20:40,119
and a lot of tired, worn-out bats.

214
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:45,660
Well, if you find anything,
notify us, will you?

215
00:20:45,743 --> 00:20:46,910
All right.

216
00:20:46,994 --> 00:20:49,493
Want to ride over
and take a look for yourself?

217
00:20:53,827 --> 00:20:55,243
No, thanks.

218
00:21:18,993 --> 00:21:20,118
Howdy, Deputy.

219
00:21:20,201 --> 00:21:21,410
Hi.

220
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,243
Hi, Harry.
Hi, Joe.

221
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:29,534
Scotty?

222
00:21:29,617 --> 00:21:31,617
Les, what can I do
for the long arm of the law?

223
00:21:31,701 --> 00:21:34,784
Well, I could use
a double shot of bourbon,
but I'm on duty.

224
00:21:34,868 --> 00:21:36,409
Coffee.

225
00:21:36,492 --> 00:21:37,659
Say, you know Charlie Piper?

226
00:21:37,742 --> 00:21:39,534
One of my regulars.

227
00:21:39,617 --> 00:21:41,993
Did he ever say anything to you
about leaving his job?

228
00:21:42,075 --> 00:21:44,200
Well, he had dreams,
just like everybody else.

229
00:21:44,284 --> 00:21:47,284
What about you? You want to wear
that green uniform the rest of your life?

230
00:21:47,367 --> 00:21:49,450
I used to have other ideas.

231
00:21:49,534 --> 00:21:51,576
I got a terrific notion.
Yeah? What?

232
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:54,409
Well, here we are,
two healthy boys,

233
00:21:54,492 --> 00:21:56,659
you with the good looks,
me with the baby fat,

234
00:21:56,741 --> 00:21:59,492
hanging around a ghost town,
waiting for the dry rot to set in.

235
00:21:59,576 --> 00:22:02,117
Now, ain't that
a kick in the head?
I won't argue.

236
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,992
That ain't normal
for two boys like us.

237
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:07,867
I got an idea. Why don't you
go out and disconnect
the radio in your car?

238
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:10,408
Sheriff won't like it,
but that I can do.

239
00:22:10,491 --> 00:22:11,616
Good.

240
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,408
Then we'll
get rid of this thing.

241
00:22:13,491 --> 00:22:15,575
I'll take this packed house,
the whole three of them,

242
00:22:15,658 --> 00:22:18,533
throw them out, lock the door,
and (WHISTLES) we're off for Las Vegas.

243
00:22:19,366 --> 00:22:20,825
Scotty, I like you.

244
00:22:20,908 --> 00:22:22,283
And I like your notion.

245
00:22:22,366 --> 00:22:23,825
Tell you what.
I'll donate my car.

246
00:22:23,908 --> 00:22:25,449
The siren will speed things along.

247
00:22:25,533 --> 00:22:28,157
Ah, we'll go for two,
three days.

248
00:22:28,241 --> 00:22:29,366
Maybe the whole week.

249
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:31,700
We'll do nothing
but a lot of drinking
and gambling,

250
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:33,491
carousing and disturbing the peace.

251
00:22:33,575 --> 00:22:35,741
Building mind and body.

252
00:22:35,824 --> 00:22:39,032
Only one thing.
I work for the county. I'm poor.

253
00:22:39,116 --> 00:22:41,699
Friend, money can't buy
happiness.

254
00:22:41,782 --> 00:22:44,324
All the money we need
is for that first drink.

255
00:22:44,408 --> 00:22:47,199
Then along comes
this doddering, wealthy widow,

256
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:50,366
somebody about 22
and eager to buy the next round.

257
00:22:50,448 --> 00:22:52,574
Keep dreaming, Scotty.
We're one girl short.

258
00:22:52,657 --> 00:22:55,782
Tell you what. I'll drop in later,
and we'll make more definite plans.

259
00:22:55,866 --> 00:22:57,199
Thanks for including me.

260
00:22:57,283 --> 00:23:01,198
Well, don't dawdle, boy,
because youth is fading fast
over the horizon.

261
00:23:12,532 --> 00:23:15,073
None for me, thanks.
I have to drive.

262
00:23:15,156 --> 00:23:17,365
Bobby, why don't you go
inside in the back room,

263
00:23:17,448 --> 00:23:19,532
lay down for a while,
and then drive?

264
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:23,073
Did you snitch my keys
out of my car again?

265
00:23:23,156 --> 00:23:24,490
No.

266
00:23:24,574 --> 00:23:26,574
You did, didn't you?
No.

267
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:27,781
Steady now. Steady.

268
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:28,990
Oh, he'll be all right.

269
00:23:29,073 --> 00:23:32,573
Marshal.
How's law and order
in the Old West?

270
00:23:32,656 --> 00:23:34,656
Could be better.
Could be worse.

271
00:23:34,739 --> 00:23:36,323
May I see
your driver's license?

272
00:23:36,406 --> 00:23:37,906
Of course you can.

273
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,239
No, just the license, please.

274
00:23:46,281 --> 00:23:47,281
Thank you.

275
00:23:50,322 --> 00:23:52,322
You connected
with the Kendon gold mines?

276
00:23:52,406 --> 00:23:53,614
I'm not bragging.

277
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:56,197
Any relation to Janice Kendon?

278
00:23:56,865 --> 00:24:00,989
Marshal, we don't bandy
the names of womenfolk
in our saloon.

279
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:03,072
Scotty, can you keep an eye
on his car?

280
00:24:03,155 --> 00:24:05,531
Maybe he'll be in shape
to pick it up in the morning.

281
00:24:05,614 --> 00:24:08,155
Wait a minute, Sheriff.
You're not going to lock him up for this?

282
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:10,447
Nah, he can afford
to feed himself.

283
00:24:10,531 --> 00:24:12,531
I'm going to take him home.
Come on, boy.

284
00:24:40,697 --> 00:24:42,280
Here we go, friend.

285
00:24:42,363 --> 00:24:44,450
What did you
bring me here for?

286
00:24:44,534 --> 00:24:46,746
Well, isn't this
where you live?

287
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,750
I just exist here, man.

288
00:24:48,834 --> 00:24:51,505
If I want to live,
I gotta go someplace else.

289
00:24:51,589 --> 00:24:53,259
Hey, Jan!

290
00:24:53,634 --> 00:24:55,178
I'm back here.

291
00:24:55,262 --> 00:24:56,431
Come out!

292
00:24:56,514 --> 00:24:57,976
Come out wherever you are!

293
00:24:59,145 --> 00:25:00,522
Hi.

294
00:25:01,189 --> 00:25:02,693
Where did you find him?

295
00:25:03,612 --> 00:25:06,450
Well, your husband seemed to need
a little help getting home.

296
00:25:06,533 --> 00:25:08,077
What shall I do
with him, ma'am?

297
00:25:08,162 --> 00:25:11,292
Oh, he's no trouble.
You just back him up
like this and press firmly.

298
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:12,377
Aaah!

299
00:25:15,175 --> 00:25:17,429
It's all right.
He's only my brother.

300
00:25:18,138 --> 00:25:18,973
Oh.

301
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,446
He always responds
beautifully to cold water.

302
00:25:26,529 --> 00:25:28,951
Wish I knew why he had
to drink so much.

303
00:25:37,968 --> 00:25:41,098
That step's a tricky one.

304
00:25:41,181 --> 00:25:44,479
If you'll excuse me,
I think I'll slip into
something more comfortable.

305
00:25:44,562 --> 00:25:46,650
If anyone asks for me. . .
We will.

306
00:25:48,487 --> 00:25:50,240
Hi, Dad.

307
00:25:50,323 --> 00:25:53,079
If it were anybody but you,
I'd say you needed a drink.

308
00:25:53,162 --> 00:25:54,665
So I drink. So what?

309
00:25:54,748 --> 00:25:56,752
Better get in
and change your clothes.

310
00:25:56,836 --> 00:25:58,965
That's what I call a brilliant idea.

311
00:26:06,521 --> 00:26:08,859
Good afternoon.
How are you, sir?

312
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:11,321
Hotter the weather,
hotter his temper.
Sure.

313
00:26:11,405 --> 00:26:13,241
I haven't seen you
around the place before.

314
00:26:13,324 --> 00:26:15,287
Oh, I'm sorry, Dad.
This is Deputy...

315
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:17,666
Les Martin, sir.
Jim Kendon.

316
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,545
Scotch, rye or bourbon?

317
00:26:19,628 --> 00:26:21,632
Well, do you have
any beer around?

318
00:26:21,716 --> 00:26:23,010
We'd be dead if we didn't.

319
00:26:23,093 --> 00:26:25,014
Can all right?
Yes, sir. Fine.

320
00:26:26,391 --> 00:26:28,019
What have you been doing
these days

321
00:26:28,102 --> 00:26:31,150
besides chasing girls
and giving them tickets?

322
00:26:31,233 --> 00:26:32,652
They letting you in
on the murder case?

323
00:26:34,198 --> 00:26:39,499
You know, that was my old office
where they found that man.

324
00:26:39,582 --> 00:26:41,127
Yes, we know.
Thank you.

325
00:26:41,211 --> 00:26:43,340
When was the last time
you were there, sir?

326
00:26:43,423 --> 00:26:46,303
I haven't used it since
the Battle of Gettysburg.

327
00:26:46,386 --> 00:26:50,019
The only time I go over there
is when I get lonesome
for the old days.

328
00:26:50,103 --> 00:26:51,855
Well, pleased to have met you,
Mr. Martin.

329
00:26:51,939 --> 00:26:54,235
I'd better be getting back
to my fossils.

330
00:26:55,696 --> 00:26:58,451
What kind of fossils?

331
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:02,500
Dad likes to wander up
and down the canyon
picking up rocks.

332
00:27:02,584 --> 00:27:05,631
He's pretty much
retired these days.

333
00:27:05,714 --> 00:27:08,554
I think it makes him
a little sad to see the mines now.

334
00:27:08,637 --> 00:27:11,308
The way it does me.

335
00:27:11,392 --> 00:27:13,813
I go and wander around
the place sometimes.

336
00:27:13,896 --> 00:27:15,817
Watch it fall apart.

337
00:27:16,777 --> 00:27:18,823
I'm sorry.
Do you want to sit down?

338
00:27:18,906 --> 00:27:21,494
Oh, no thanks, Miss Kendon.
I've got to get back to work.

339
00:27:21,578 --> 00:27:24,458
You're a real dedicated
public servant, aren't you?

340
00:27:25,251 --> 00:27:27,255
Not dedicated enough,
I'm afraid.

341
00:27:27,338 --> 00:27:30,803
Why do you always look as though
you have something on your mind?

342
00:27:30,887 --> 00:27:32,849
Well, because I have.

343
00:27:32,932 --> 00:27:36,189
One thing I'll regret
the rest of my life is

344
00:27:36,272 --> 00:27:39,110
chasing you the other day
to give you that ticket.

345
00:27:39,195 --> 00:27:43,828
Why, Officer Martin,
that's the most gallant thing
I've ever heard.

346
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,206
Yup, that's me.

347
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:47,083
Gallant but stupid.

348
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:50,548
While I was handing out
speeding tickets,

349
00:27:50,633 --> 00:27:52,719
that's when the man
was being killed.

350
00:27:53,721 --> 00:27:55,642
Well, thanks for the drink,
Miss Kendon.

351
00:27:56,685 --> 00:27:58,438
I didn't know.

352
00:27:59,649 --> 00:28:01,277
I'm sorry.

353
00:28:18,643 --> 00:28:19,603
Ward, hi.

354
00:28:19,687 --> 00:28:21,398
You got something?

355
00:28:26,241 --> 00:28:28,662
Remember that fellow I said
had taken off for Las Vegas?

356
00:28:28,745 --> 00:28:30,874
Yeah.
Not so sure about him now.

357
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:34,214
That's his watch.
One of my boys found it
up the canyon.

358
00:28:34,298 --> 00:28:35,300
At the rim?

359
00:28:35,383 --> 00:28:37,386
Close to it.
It was over by a boulder.

360
00:28:39,891 --> 00:28:42,604
Well, you know,
even a dollar watch
wears out sometime.

361
00:28:42,688 --> 00:28:43,223
Maybe he just
threw this away.

362
00:28:43,253 --> 00:28:43,788
Not Charlie Piper.

363
00:28:43,818 --> 00:28:44,947
Like a kid about that watch.
Sort of a lucky piece, you know?

364
00:28:45,215 --> 00:28:46,538
You don't think
he'd have gone to Vegas
without this, huh?

365
00:28:46,567 --> 00:28:49,418
I don't think
he'd go anywhere without it.

366
00:30:59,494 --> 00:31:01,148
I can't hear them.

367
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:04,536
That's because you never knew Kendon
the way it used to be.

368
00:31:04,618 --> 00:31:06,602
You know, there were
10,000 people living here

369
00:31:06,685 --> 00:31:09,040
when the mines
were going full steam.

370
00:31:09,123 --> 00:31:12,016
Oh, it was
a wonderfully noisy place.

371
00:31:12,098 --> 00:31:15,115
The clatter of the big mills
and the whine of the conveyor belts.

372
00:31:15,198 --> 00:31:18,338
And every now and then,
a great big, beautiful explosion.

373
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:21,024
And all day long,
kids laughing

374
00:31:21,107 --> 00:31:23,339
and playing and howling
at each other.

375
00:31:24,165 --> 00:31:26,066
It was a rip-roaring town too.

376
00:31:26,148 --> 00:31:28,381
You know, Scotty's saloon
was just one of seven.

377
00:31:28,463 --> 00:31:29,992
Dance hall girls.

378
00:31:30,075 --> 00:31:31,975
Say, Methuselah,
how old are you?

379
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:34,124
It was less than 20 years ago.

380
00:31:34,207 --> 00:31:35,777
Look at it now.

381
00:31:36,356 --> 00:31:37,637
Yeah.

382
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:43,381
You know, for a few moments there,
I thought I could hear it too.

383
00:31:43,464 --> 00:31:45,199
Welcome to the club.

384
00:31:45,984 --> 00:31:47,141
Let me ask you something.

385
00:31:47,225 --> 00:31:49,951
Is it possible
there could still be
a lot of gold here

386
00:31:50,035 --> 00:31:52,018
without you people
knowing about it?

387
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,258
Are you kidding?

388
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,737
You're sitting on $20 million
worth of gold

389
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:58,837
and practically everybody
knows about it.

390
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:01,715
During the war, the government had to
close down all the gold mines

391
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,138
because they needed
the manpower.

392
00:32:04,221 --> 00:32:06,224
Well, the war's over.
What are they waiting for?

393
00:32:06,308 --> 00:32:08,478
For the price of gold to go up.

394
00:32:08,563 --> 00:32:10,984
I don't see anything wrong
with $35 an ounce.

395
00:32:11,067 --> 00:32:12,611
Nothing wrong with it?

396
00:32:12,695 --> 00:32:14,615
In other countries,
where there's a free market,

397
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:16,494
it averages about $50 an ounce.

398
00:32:16,578 --> 00:32:18,122
Oh, well, that is a difference.

399
00:32:18,205 --> 00:32:20,293
$24,000 a hundred pounds.

400
00:32:20,376 --> 00:32:22,589
Darn right it's a difference.
Mm-hmm.

401
00:32:24,885 --> 00:32:28,141
My father spent a fortune
sending me to college in New York

402
00:32:28,224 --> 00:32:30,145
to make me ladylike and dainty.

403
00:32:30,228 --> 00:32:33,651
You come along, and in five minutes,
I'm just a miner's brat again.

404
00:32:33,735 --> 00:32:35,906
I think you still look
ladylike and dainty.

405
00:32:35,989 --> 00:32:38,118
I'll slug anyone who says I don't.

406
00:32:39,787 --> 00:32:43,377
With all this gold here, how come
they have only one man guarding it?

407
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,882
Oh, Eli's not here to guard it.

408
00:32:45,966 --> 00:32:47,677
He just keeps the fences in repair

409
00:32:47,761 --> 00:32:50,182
so that the tourists
won't fall down the mine shafts.

410
00:32:50,265 --> 00:32:52,686
And that concludes
the lesson for today.

411
00:32:54,482 --> 00:32:55,484
All right, teacher.

412
00:33:00,243 --> 00:33:01,662
Here we go!

413
00:33:01,745 --> 00:33:02,789
Oh!

414
00:33:05,753 --> 00:33:09,218
Tell me, Les, what do you do
when you finish a day's work?

415
00:33:09,301 --> 00:33:11,347
Go home,
get your notes in order?

416
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:14,227
Oh, I generally
hang around the pool hall.

417
00:33:14,311 --> 00:33:18,068
Sometimes I get in with a group
to go stealing hubcaps.

418
00:33:18,151 --> 00:33:20,239
You need some recreation.

419
00:33:20,322 --> 00:33:23,119
You mean like a hobby,
like stamp collecting?

420
00:33:23,787 --> 00:33:27,419
Why don't you find yourself a nice,
intelligent, well-rounded girl,

421
00:33:27,502 --> 00:33:29,256
take her out
for dinner and dancing?

422
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,177
I think you're well-rounded.

423
00:33:32,261 --> 00:33:35,684
You might try my house,
say, 7:00 tomorrow evening?

424
00:33:35,767 --> 00:33:37,146
That sounds like a dare.

425
00:33:37,229 --> 00:33:38,523
Oh, it is.

426
00:33:38,815 --> 00:33:40,902
All right, you're on.
Tomorrow at 7:00.

427
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:42,488
Lightweight gloves.

428
00:33:51,005 --> 00:33:53,384
Keep an eye out for cops.

429
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:20,018
Hey, what are you
doing down there?

430
00:34:20,852 --> 00:34:22,773
What the hell business
is it of yours?

431
00:34:22,856 --> 00:34:24,484
Get up out of there.

432
00:34:29,285 --> 00:34:30,704
What's your name?

433
00:34:30,788 --> 00:34:33,000
Suds Reese.
What are you doing here?

434
00:34:33,084 --> 00:34:35,672
Minding my own business,
that's what.

435
00:34:35,755 --> 00:34:38,009
I'm hitchhiking my way
out of this lousy state,

436
00:34:38,093 --> 00:34:40,432
so I stopped for a couple of beers
and I'm sleeping them off.

437
00:34:40,515 --> 00:34:42,226
In a gold mine?

438
00:34:42,309 --> 00:34:44,313
I just wanted a cool place to sleep.

439
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:47,570
You county cops got nothing to do
but give me a hard time?

440
00:34:47,653 --> 00:34:49,030
Wait a minute.

441
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:55,083
Where did you get those?

442
00:34:55,168 --> 00:34:57,589
They're a graduation present
from me mother.

443
00:34:57,672 --> 00:34:58,966
Yeah?

444
00:34:59,049 --> 00:35:01,262
You must have skipped
a couple of grades
you shouldn't...

445
00:35:06,689 --> 00:35:08,025
Get your hands up.

446
00:35:10,738 --> 00:35:12,241
Keep 'em up.

447
00:35:13,535 --> 00:35:15,038
Now turn around.

448
00:35:16,332 --> 00:35:18,127
Spread your feet. Come on!

449
00:35:20,715 --> 00:35:22,719
I ought to break your neck.

450
00:35:22,802 --> 00:35:25,015
What are you trying to pull, huh?

451
00:35:32,821 --> 00:35:35,409
No wonder you didn't want me
to look at these. R.E.W.

452
00:35:36,411 --> 00:35:39,960
Mr. Reese, if you want
to leave this state, ever,

453
00:35:40,043 --> 00:35:42,589
you better have a real good story
about where you found those.

454
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:44,677
What kind of a way
is that to talk?

455
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,764
I found them
laying back down there.

456
00:35:46,847 --> 00:35:49,143
And you had no idea
who to give them back to, right?

457
00:35:49,227 --> 00:35:51,481
I don't know any R.E.W.

458
00:35:51,565 --> 00:35:53,860
Reese, you're coming down
to Kingman with me

459
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:55,948
just to make sure you don't.

460
00:35:56,533 --> 00:35:58,119
All right, get going.

461
00:35:58,202 --> 00:35:59,706
You heard me.
Come on now.

462
00:35:59,789 --> 00:36:01,417
What's going on out here?

463
00:36:02,836 --> 00:36:04,923
I've had
enough trouble out of you.

464
00:36:05,925 --> 00:36:09,177
Book him for assault and battery
and suspicion of murder.

465
00:36:09,261 --> 00:36:10,261
Murder?

466
00:36:10,344 --> 00:36:11,679
Suspicion of murder, huh?

467
00:36:12,554 --> 00:36:14,139
This guy sure gets around

468
00:36:14,221 --> 00:36:17,140
considering he just got out of jail
in Prescott late yesterday.

469
00:36:17,515 --> 00:36:19,308
Late yesterday in Prescott?

470
00:36:20,017 --> 00:36:21,184
You know this guy?

471
00:36:21,267 --> 00:36:23,643
He's one of my star boarders.
Suds Reese.

472
00:36:23,727 --> 00:36:25,270
He likes it,
don't you, Sudsie?

473
00:36:25,353 --> 00:36:28,646
Sure, you got the best
county jail in the county.

474
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:32,482
Then why did he slug me
when I started to look
at these binoculars?

475
00:36:33,899 --> 00:36:35,817
Old Sudsie's like that.

476
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,611
Look at the initials. R.E.W.

477
00:36:38,694 --> 00:36:40,570
That certainly could be R.E. Wallace.

478
00:36:42,322 --> 00:36:43,614
Where did you get them?

479
00:36:43,697 --> 00:36:46,324
Like I told this joker,
I found them.

480
00:36:47,532 --> 00:36:49,700
Sorry, Les. Probably true.

481
00:36:50,492 --> 00:36:52,535
Anyway, we can book him
for assault and battery.

482
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:55,412
Sheriff, the county attorney's
on the telephone again.

483
00:36:56,204 --> 00:36:58,539
I'll take it in my office.
Lock him up.

484
00:36:58,623 --> 00:37:01,457
Come on, Les.
You might as well
be in on this too.

485
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:04,208
I've met
County Attorney Houghton.

486
00:37:04,292 --> 00:37:07,544
He doesn't think very much
of the sheriff's department.

487
00:37:07,628 --> 00:37:09,670
The feeling's mutual.

488
00:37:14,506 --> 00:37:16,090
Mr. Houghton,
Sheriff Edwards.

489
00:37:16,174 --> 00:37:17,634
Oh, that's very reassuring,
Mr. Edwards.

490
00:37:17,716 --> 00:37:20,885
People around town
are beginning to wonder
if we still have a sheriff.

491
00:37:22,469 --> 00:37:26,555
I have in my office
the mayor and Mr. Sanford
of the <i>Kingman Dispatch.</i>

492
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:29,223
They have the feeling that,
though you may be on the case,

493
00:37:29,307 --> 00:37:31,141
you're not doing anything about it.

494
00:37:31,224 --> 00:37:34,851
Well, we are. Matter of fact,
I got something on it this morning.

495
00:37:34,934 --> 00:37:36,727
Communication on Charlie Piper.

496
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:38,729
Los Angeles Police Department.

497
00:37:40,021 --> 00:37:42,814
The old goat's just bluffing.
Shuffling papers.

498
00:37:42,898 --> 00:37:46,524
If we don't win the election,
it won't be his fault.

499
00:37:46,608 --> 00:37:48,109
Here it is.

500
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:51,819
Arrested for hijacking a truck.

501
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:53,111
Beat the rap.

502
00:37:53,195 --> 00:37:56,697
Apparently, the county attorney
down there wasn't doing his job.

503
00:37:57,822 --> 00:38:02,117
July 6, 1953, was tried and convicted
for the burglary of a warehouse.

504
00:38:03,534 --> 00:38:05,869
Yeah, yeah. Must have been
a different county attorney.

505
00:38:05,952 --> 00:38:07,787
Edwards, I'll tell you one thing.

506
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:11,539
Neither one of those county attorneys
would have gotten a conviction
if you'd been sheriff.

507
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:14,791
Because your Mr. Piper
would never have been arrested
in the first place.

508
00:38:14,874 --> 00:38:16,958
Look, Sam, why don't you take care
of your department

509
00:38:17,042 --> 00:38:18,543
and let me take care of mine?

510
00:38:23,213 --> 00:38:26,798
Sam Houghton backed my opponent
the last time I ran for sheriff.

511
00:38:26,881 --> 00:38:30,841
It would make him very happy
if we don't solve this case.

512
00:38:30,925 --> 00:38:33,968
Matter of fact, it might lose me
the next election.

513
00:38:34,052 --> 00:38:37,929
You mean, for both our sakes,
I'd better make some progress, huh?

514
00:38:38,012 --> 00:38:39,555
You got the message.

515
00:38:42,723 --> 00:38:44,392
What are you
all dressed up for?

516
00:38:44,475 --> 00:38:45,725
I'm not all dressed up.

517
00:38:45,809 --> 00:38:47,309
You've got shoes on.

518
00:38:47,393 --> 00:38:48,894
It gets cold
around here at night.

519
00:38:51,187 --> 00:38:53,814
If you must know, I have
a young man calling for me.

520
00:38:53,897 --> 00:38:55,898
Obviously, you can't think
too much of him

521
00:38:55,981 --> 00:38:57,941
if you're not even going
to keep him waiting.

522
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:02,527
Hi.

523
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:03,568
Hi!

524
00:39:09,197 --> 00:39:10,656
How are you, sir?
Fine, thanks.

525
00:39:10,739 --> 00:39:13,116
How about a drink?
I'll intoxicate him.

526
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:14,575
Come on, Les.

527
00:39:15,659 --> 00:39:18,744
Let's live dangerously
and take my car, huh?

528
00:39:18,828 --> 00:39:20,829
Not that dangerously.
You can drive.

529
00:39:20,912 --> 00:39:22,163
Well, in that case...

530
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,456
Good night, sir.
Good night.

531
00:39:32,335 --> 00:39:34,753
I keep coming back
to one theory.

532
00:39:34,837 --> 00:39:38,047
Could somebody be sneaking gold
out of your father's mine?

533
00:39:38,131 --> 00:39:42,633
Your somebody would have
to sneak it out by the truckload
to make it worthwhile.

534
00:39:42,717 --> 00:39:45,926
Well, if you had a big truck
and taking ways,

535
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:47,886
where would you take the gold?

536
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:50,012
I've been accused of having
fetching ways,

537
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,680
but this is the first.

538
00:39:53,305 --> 00:39:56,891
This is hardly a big girl's idea
of a gay night out.

539
00:39:57,933 --> 00:39:59,184
Can't we talk about us?

540
00:39:59,268 --> 00:40:01,018
I'm just trying to protect you.

541
00:40:01,102 --> 00:40:04,479
Somewhere in these hills,
there's a murderer on the loose.

542
00:40:04,563 --> 00:40:06,021
You frighten me.

543
00:40:06,105 --> 00:40:09,274
If you don't answer my question,
I'm really going to frighten you.

544
00:40:09,356 --> 00:40:10,691
Yes, sir.

545
00:40:10,774 --> 00:40:14,192
Well, if I were stealing gold,
we miners call it high-grading,

546
00:40:14,276 --> 00:40:15,902
I'd take it down to Mexico.

547
00:40:15,986 --> 00:40:18,195
Fifty dollars an ounce, remember?

548
00:40:19,529 --> 00:40:21,530
Would you have to know
a lot about mining

549
00:40:21,613 --> 00:40:23,407
to discover a rich vein?

550
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:26,867
Yes, and that's the last
of your questions.

551
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:28,787
Where are you taking me, Mr. Deputy?

552
00:40:28,871 --> 00:40:31,878
To Scotty's.
I want to ask him some questions.

553
00:40:32,964 --> 00:40:35,470
This is turning out to be
a fabulous evening.

554
00:40:36,053 --> 00:40:38,518
I was hoping to combine
business with pleasure.

555
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,274
Then let's get down to business.

556
00:40:42,151 --> 00:40:44,071
Ah, here we are.

557
00:40:46,745 --> 00:40:48,290
Thanks.

558
00:41:03,156 --> 00:41:04,743
Looks like
your brother's here.

559
00:41:04,828 --> 00:41:06,372
He's always here.

560
00:41:07,291 --> 00:41:09,254
What else does Bob do?

561
00:41:10,339 --> 00:41:12,636
He's supposed to be
a geologist.

562
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:13,806
Supposed to.

563
00:41:13,889 --> 00:41:14,891
How's that?

564
00:41:15,726 --> 00:41:17,982
Well, he just does it
to keep peace in the family.

565
00:41:18,065 --> 00:41:20,070
I wouldn't say he worked at it.

566
00:41:20,153 --> 00:41:22,157
Or at anything else,
for that matter.

567
00:41:22,241 --> 00:41:24,037
Except flying maybe.

568
00:41:28,213 --> 00:41:30,844
Mademoiselle Kendon.

569
00:41:30,927 --> 00:41:34,352
Reserved table, up front,
not too near the music.

570
00:41:34,436 --> 00:41:37,025
Inspector,
champagne, of course.

571
00:41:37,108 --> 00:41:38,235
Hi, Scotty.
Hi.

572
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,948
I'll join you in a minute.
All right.

573
00:41:40,032 --> 00:41:41,619
Come on.
Drinks are on me.

574
00:41:45,001 --> 00:41:46,379
Hi, Sis.

575
00:41:46,463 --> 00:41:49,218
Stud or draw, deuces wild.
You name it.

576
00:41:49,302 --> 00:41:51,098
Why didn't you come home
last night?

577
00:41:51,182 --> 00:41:52,601
Why should I?

578
00:41:52,685 --> 00:41:55,274
Well, Dad and I
were worried about you.

579
00:41:56,026 --> 00:41:59,283
I'm sorry that you were worried,
but I don't give a damn about him.

580
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,287
Look, Bobby.

581
00:42:01,997 --> 00:42:04,086
No one wants to interfere with you.

582
00:42:05,088 --> 00:42:07,385
Boy, when I think of you
driving those turns at night,

583
00:42:07,468 --> 00:42:09,807
absolutely pie-eyed.

584
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:11,560
I drive better drunk.

585
00:42:11,644 --> 00:42:13,899
That's because
you've had more practice at it.

586
00:42:15,486 --> 00:42:16,990
How's the new fellow?

587
00:42:17,992 --> 00:42:20,497
And this is
the specialty of the house
for the carriage trade.

588
00:42:20,581 --> 00:42:23,295
Ha! Speaking of
the carriage trade,

589
00:42:23,379 --> 00:42:25,216
have you seen
any strangers around?

590
00:42:25,299 --> 00:42:28,516
In a ghost town?
What would they be doing here?

591
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:31,773
Well, just in case, if you do,
anyone, anyone at all,

592
00:42:31,857 --> 00:42:33,986
get in touch with me
right away, will you?

593
00:42:34,069 --> 00:42:37,578
If I see any strangers here,
I'm going to grab them,
pull them in here, then roll them.

594
00:42:37,661 --> 00:42:39,123
Then I'll call you.

595
00:42:40,042 --> 00:42:41,545
You have my blessing.

596
00:42:41,628 --> 00:42:43,424
You're a little premature.

597
00:42:43,507 --> 00:42:45,637
You usually get
what you're after.

598
00:42:46,389 --> 00:42:47,976
I can't get you to stop drinking.

599
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,400
You've got to lose sometime.

600
00:42:51,484 --> 00:42:52,987
You've got to stop sometime.

601
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,076
Tell you what I'll do.
I'll cut for it.

602
00:42:59,502 --> 00:43:02,050
See? It's impossible.

603
00:43:04,096 --> 00:43:06,101
Okay, but take it easy, huh?

604
00:43:06,184 --> 00:43:07,729
You too, Sis.

605
00:43:09,316 --> 00:43:11,320
Hey, Scotty,
how about another drink?

606
00:43:31,365 --> 00:43:34,289
For an arm of the law,
you're very light on your feet.

607
00:43:34,372 --> 00:43:36,294
And on yours.

608
00:43:36,377 --> 00:43:38,590
You're a lot younger
than your jokes.

609
00:43:38,674 --> 00:43:39,968
Where did you learn to cha-cha?

610
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:41,973
I sent away
for a mail-order course.

611
00:43:42,056 --> 00:43:44,896
But the left foot never arrived.
Are you tired?

612
00:43:44,979 --> 00:43:47,234
Uncle.
I'm glad you said it first.

613
00:43:49,198 --> 00:43:52,580
When you're not
drag racing with policemen
or rinsing out your brother,

614
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:54,250
what do you do to keep busy?

615
00:43:54,334 --> 00:43:56,004
I'm a domestic.

616
00:43:56,087 --> 00:43:59,846
When summer comes,
Dad pretends the housekeeper
needs a long vacation.

617
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:02,018
So I keep house
for him and Bobby.

618
00:44:02,101 --> 00:44:04,690
Uh-huh. What do you do
in the winter?

619
00:44:04,774 --> 00:44:07,029
Now I know
why you became a policeman.

620
00:44:07,112 --> 00:44:09,117
You just like to sit around
asking questions.

621
00:44:09,201 --> 00:44:10,704
It's my turn now.

622
00:44:10,788 --> 00:44:11,915
All right.

623
00:44:11,998 --> 00:44:15,172
What did you do
before speeding tickets
and the cha-cha?

624
00:44:15,256 --> 00:44:17,386
Well, actually,
I started out to be a lawyer.

625
00:44:17,469 --> 00:44:19,432
Mail-order?

626
00:44:19,516 --> 00:44:21,228
University of Colorado.

627
00:44:21,311 --> 00:44:25,028
I passed my bar exams.
I practiced for two years
in Boulder City.

628
00:44:25,655 --> 00:44:27,951
But I . . .
It just didn't get me.

629
00:44:28,034 --> 00:44:29,789
Not enough excitement?

630
00:44:29,872 --> 00:44:32,503
Not enough fresh air,
I guess.
Then what?

631
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:35,175
On one of the cases
I was handling,

632
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:38,224
I met a police sergeant
from Denver. Homicide.

633
00:44:39,352 --> 00:44:42,358
And his job seemed much
more interesting than mine,

634
00:44:42,443 --> 00:44:44,447
so I became a policeman,
homicide.

635
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:45,867
A detective.
Mm-hmm.

636
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:48,414
That's interesting.
Were you a good detective?

637
00:44:48,497 --> 00:44:50,419
They seemed to think so.

638
00:44:50,502 --> 00:44:53,216
There was even talk of running me
for district attorney.

639
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,845
I'd have voted for you.

640
00:44:56,349 --> 00:44:58,311
Another round, please.

641
00:45:00,107 --> 00:45:01,986
Well, you can't finish
the chapter there.

642
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:03,782
No personal life?

643
00:45:03,865 --> 00:45:05,202
No policewomen?

644
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:09,962
Well, I did meet a girl.
We fell in love, got married.

645
00:45:10,046 --> 00:45:11,591
Had three wonderful years.

646
00:45:11,674 --> 00:45:13,095
Then she became ill.

647
00:45:14,348 --> 00:45:16,102
Everyone was
very understanding.

648
00:45:16,185 --> 00:45:19,442
I couldn't keep my mind
on what I was doing,

649
00:45:19,526 --> 00:45:23,118
and. . . I messed up
a terribly important case.

650
00:45:23,201 --> 00:45:25,706
The department
was kind of glad to see me go.

651
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:31,428
And when she died,
I just couldn't stay in the same town.

652
00:45:32,764 --> 00:45:34,977
We don't have to talk about it
if you'd rather not.

653
00:45:36,021 --> 00:45:37,900
Oh, it's finished now, I think.

654
00:45:37,984 --> 00:45:40,322
I became somewhat of
a drifter for a while.

655
00:45:40,406 --> 00:45:42,703
I had nowhere to go,
nothing to do.

656
00:45:42,786 --> 00:45:46,043
Until I ran into Sheriff Edwards
here in Kingman.

657
00:45:46,127 --> 00:45:47,923
He knew about me

658
00:45:48,007 --> 00:45:51,222
and practically bullied me
into becoming a deputy,

659
00:45:51,306 --> 00:45:53,018
bless his overweight old heart.

660
00:45:53,101 --> 00:45:54,855
I'll go along with that.

661
00:45:55,607 --> 00:45:57,528
And what about the future?

662
00:45:57,612 --> 00:45:59,616
You could still run
for district attorney.

663
00:46:00,367 --> 00:46:04,503
Well, the main thing at the moment
is to do a good job right where I am.

664
00:46:04,586 --> 00:46:06,757
There's nothing to stop you.

665
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:12,729
Hello, Deputy.

666
00:46:15,736 --> 00:46:17,657
Good evening, Mr. Houghton.

667
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:20,287
Miss Kendon, do you know
Mr. Houghton, our county attorney?

668
00:46:20,371 --> 00:46:21,874
Yes, we've met.

669
00:46:21,958 --> 00:46:23,796
I'm glad to see
you're relaxing.

670
00:46:26,803 --> 00:46:30,519
Someone ought to tell him
that all work and no play
makes Jack a dull boy.

671
00:46:30,602 --> 00:46:33,484
Yeah, well, I think
I'd better start getting real dull.

672
00:46:33,568 --> 00:46:34,776
Check, please.

673
00:46:36,484 --> 00:46:39,484
I don't know about you,
but Mr. Houghton just lost a vote.

674
00:46:39,568 --> 00:46:40,984
Mine.

675
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:50,275
(ON RADIO)
<i>I'm sorry, Mad Dog,</i>

676
00:46:50,358 --> 00:46:52,483
<i>you wouldn't have it
any other way.</i>

677
00:46:52,567 --> 00:46:56,191
<i>Well, Lieutenant,</i>
<i>I guess that closes the books</i>
<i>on Mad Dog Cooley.</i>

678
00:47:00,983 --> 00:47:02,983
Should've listened to 'em, Mad Dog.

679
00:47:29,022 --> 00:47:33,064
Well, you couldn't have picked yourself
a better time to have dropped in.

680
00:47:33,147 --> 00:47:34,855
I just made a discovery.

681
00:47:34,939 --> 00:47:38,355
That fellow who was murdered
is sitting right here next to Mr. Kendon.

682
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:39,814
Look.

683
00:47:41,438 --> 00:47:45,063
Oh. Here, have yourself an apple
while I phone the sheriff.

684
00:47:45,146 --> 00:47:46,729
Oh, peel it?

685
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:03,770
Is this the coroner's inquest?

686
00:48:03,853 --> 00:48:05,020
Yes, Miss Kendon.

687
00:48:05,104 --> 00:48:08,062
According to
your previous testimony,
before coming here,

688
00:48:08,145 --> 00:48:11,937
you were a lieutenant
in the homicide division
of the Denver Police Force.

689
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,520
Yes, sir.

690
00:48:13,603 --> 00:48:16,894
You're experienced
in homicide cases therefore.

691
00:48:16,978 --> 00:48:20,103
Well, yes, sir.
I've had some experience, yes, sir.

692
00:48:20,186 --> 00:48:23,019
Perhaps you can explain
why you seem to have
no leads at all

693
00:48:23,103 --> 00:48:25,394
as to the murderer's identity.

694
00:48:25,477 --> 00:48:27,978
As I explained
in my previous testimony...

695
00:48:28,061 --> 00:48:32,394
Is this your testimony
about your discovering this body
or the body earlier this week?

696
00:48:32,477 --> 00:48:34,060
Or the body last week?

697
00:48:34,143 --> 00:48:36,143
When you have
as many murder cases as we have,

698
00:48:36,227 --> 00:48:38,143
you have to be
a little more specific.

699
00:48:38,227 --> 00:48:39,394
I'm sorry.

700
00:48:39,477 --> 00:48:42,810
We're talking about
three unsolved murder cases.

701
00:48:43,893 --> 00:48:45,226
We have three bodies.

702
00:48:45,309 --> 00:48:47,393
It could be we have
only one murder case.

703
00:48:47,476 --> 00:48:52,809
While the manner of these three deaths
shows no similarity,

704
00:48:52,892 --> 00:48:55,351
we believe there's
a strong connection between them.

705
00:48:55,434 --> 00:48:58,350
Would you mind defining
that connection?

706
00:48:58,433 --> 00:49:02,350
When I can define it,
that will close the case.

707
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:06,891
We know generally
that John Doe and Eli Jones

708
00:49:06,975 --> 00:49:10,724
had met shortly before
John Doe was hanged.

709
00:49:10,808 --> 00:49:13,225
Both men died
in the same place,

710
00:49:13,308 --> 00:49:17,224
a place that's visited by probably
not more than a dozen people a year.

711
00:49:17,307 --> 00:49:20,516
The office of the inactive
gold mine at Kendon.

712
00:49:20,599 --> 00:49:22,307
Mm-hmm.

713
00:49:22,391 --> 00:49:24,307
And the third man?

714
00:49:24,391 --> 00:49:26,057
Charles Piper.

715
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:29,182
We know that Charles Piper
leaped or fell

716
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:32,641
or was pushed over
the rim of the Grand Canyon
at Granite Gorge.

717
00:49:32,724 --> 00:49:34,474
Yes, but we don't know why.

718
00:49:35,224 --> 00:49:37,391
When we know why,
we'll probably know who.

719
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:40,724
Well, that's a well-made phrase.
Mr. Deputy.

720
00:49:41,641 --> 00:49:43,141
Let's go back to Denver.

721
00:49:45,558 --> 00:49:46,558
Thank you.

722
00:49:46,641 --> 00:49:48,641
The last case
that you handled there...

723
00:49:49,517 --> 00:49:54,058
involved the murder
of a 16-year old boy,
one Harris Knight.

724
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:56,933
Now, according to
my investigation.

725
00:49:57,016 --> 00:49:58,517
Now, wait a minute, Sam.

726
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:01,475
This has nothing to do with this inquest,
and you know it.

727
00:50:01,559 --> 00:50:03,892
I know nothing of the kind.

728
00:50:03,975 --> 00:50:05,267
But I do know this.

729
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:06,850
I'm the county attorney,

730
00:50:06,934 --> 00:50:09,392
responsible to the good citizens
of Mohave County,

731
00:50:09,475 --> 00:50:11,892
and they're very upset,
with good reason,

732
00:50:11,976 --> 00:50:14,600
over these three
unsolved murders.

733
00:50:15,892 --> 00:50:18,934
Mr. Coroner, it's up to you
to see that he sticks to the inquest.

734
00:50:19,017 --> 00:50:20,725
I'd like to answer him, Sheriff.

735
00:50:21,725 --> 00:50:23,767
Might as well
have everything out.

736
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:26,059
You may continue the questioning.

737
00:50:29,393 --> 00:50:30,476
Mr. Martin,

738
00:50:31,393 --> 00:50:34,017
according to my investigation,

739
00:50:34,101 --> 00:50:38,268
you had the police department in Denver
holding the wrong man for trial.

740
00:50:38,351 --> 00:50:41,685
It wasn't until
you were relieved of your job
and another officer replaced you

741
00:50:41,768 --> 00:50:44,977
that the true murderer
was found and convicted.

742
00:50:46,142 --> 00:50:47,226
Yes, sir.

743
00:50:47,309 --> 00:50:49,476
In other words, you were guilty
of several mistakes

744
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:52,476
and some carelessness
in the matter of Harris Knight.

745
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:55,851
Yes, sir.

746
00:50:55,935 --> 00:50:59,935
And then again,
according to your testimony,

747
00:51:00,018 --> 00:51:01,476
the deceased, Eli Jones,

748
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:05,643
intercepted you
on the morning of the 16th
of this month

749
00:51:05,726 --> 00:51:09,435
and he begged you
to come with him
to interview a John Doe,

750
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:12,143
a man known as
R.E. Wallace,

751
00:51:13,644 --> 00:51:16,644
who was killed later the same day
in the Kendon Mine office.

752
00:51:16,727 --> 00:51:19,727
Now, have I made
any misstatements of fact
up to this point?

753
00:51:19,811 --> 00:51:20,686
No, sir.

754
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:23,811
According to your own report,

755
00:51:23,894 --> 00:51:27,727
you disregarded Eli Jones's request
and went chasing after a girl.

756
00:51:27,811 --> 00:51:29,561
I wasn't chasing after any girl.

757
00:51:29,644 --> 00:51:31,644
I was taking care
of a traffic violation.

758
00:51:31,727 --> 00:51:33,435
You gave her a ticket?
Yes, I did.

759
00:51:33,519 --> 00:51:35,310
What was the ticket for?

760
00:51:35,394 --> 00:51:37,811
Forty-five miles an hour
in a 25-mile zone.

761
00:51:37,894 --> 00:51:40,769
Well, that doesn't sound
so serious to me.

762
00:51:40,852 --> 00:51:43,228
Certainly not as serious
as murder.

763
00:51:43,311 --> 00:51:45,562
Or even a request
for help from Eli Jones.

764
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:48,562
When Eli Jones asked for help,
I didn't know of any murder.

765
00:51:48,645 --> 00:51:50,852
And I did see somebody
breaking the law.

766
00:51:50,936 --> 00:51:53,603
You can call it a mistake
only now, after the fact.

767
00:51:53,687 --> 00:51:57,270
You made a mistake
in the case of Eli Jones
and John Doe.

768
00:51:57,353 --> 00:51:59,978
You made a mistake in Denver
in the matter of Harris Knight.

769
00:52:00,061 --> 00:52:03,186
Now, why should we have
any reason to assume

770
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:05,311
that there won't be further mistakes?

771
00:52:05,395 --> 00:52:07,853
I can't give you any guarantee.
Nobody can.

772
00:52:07,937 --> 00:52:09,687
Mr. County Attorney,

773
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:13,895
our sole purpose here is to establish
the identity of the deceased

774
00:52:13,979 --> 00:52:16,145
and to determine the cause of his death.

775
00:52:16,229 --> 00:52:18,687
Mr. Coroner,
I'm just trying to do my job.

776
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:21,853
And I assume that all of us
are trying to do the same.

777
00:52:22,437 --> 00:52:23,937
It seems clear to me

778
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:27,563
that those of us
who haven't met with
violent death so far

779
00:52:27,646 --> 00:52:30,937
might be reassured
if there were fewer mistakes

780
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:32,354
and more progress.

781
00:52:32,437 --> 00:52:36,020
Perhaps this entire community
would all feel a little more secure

782
00:52:36,104 --> 00:52:39,104
if someone with a different record
was handling this case.

783
00:52:46,021 --> 00:52:47,479
You seen the morning paper?

784
00:52:57,313 --> 00:52:59,146
You want my resignation?

785
00:53:00,355 --> 00:53:02,355
No, I don't want your resignation.

786
00:53:02,438 --> 00:53:05,397
But if this sort of thing keeps up,
I'm going to have to accept it.

787
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:09,813
Hey, Martin, you've got
a stack of unanswered
phone calls out here.

788
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,438
Janice Kendon called.

789
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:14,522
Miss Kendon called to report
she's a missing person.

790
00:53:14,605 --> 00:53:15,605
Janice Kendon would like...

791
00:53:15,689 --> 00:53:18,188
Would like to send you
a food package. Where?

792
00:53:18,272 --> 00:53:20,313
I see at least you
got the messages.

793
00:53:20,397 --> 00:53:22,146
He's been working
like a dog, Miss Kendon.

794
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:23,981
He is a dog.

795
00:53:24,064 --> 00:53:25,230
Not being a girl,

796
00:53:25,313 --> 00:53:28,272
you can't imagine
how embarrassing it is
if you keep chasing a man

797
00:53:28,355 --> 00:53:30,730
and he keeps hiding from you.

798
00:53:30,814 --> 00:53:31,814
I'm sorry.

799
00:53:31,897 --> 00:53:34,480
All right, Deputy,
put your hat back on
and take the silly look off.

800
00:53:34,564 --> 00:53:36,064
You're gonna buy me
a hamburger.

801
00:53:36,147 --> 00:53:39,189
All right, you're on.
I'll just put these things away.

802
00:53:41,439 --> 00:53:45,273
Oh, I had a professor
of medieval history
had a jacket almost like this.

803
00:53:45,356 --> 00:53:46,565
Yeah? In New York?

804
00:53:46,648 --> 00:53:48,648
Of course.
That's where Norman James is.

805
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:51,481
Who's Norman James?
Your history professor?

806
00:53:51,565 --> 00:53:55,565
He is the man who makes these jackets
with the funny little round lapels.

807
00:53:55,648 --> 00:53:58,064
Oh, Les, you are a country boy.

808
00:53:58,147 --> 00:54:02,023
Back in the effete east,
you could be ostracized
for asking a question like that.

809
00:54:03,523 --> 00:54:05,065
What are you talking about?

810
00:54:05,148 --> 00:54:08,606
Norman James is the most exclusive
gentlemen's tailor in New York,

811
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:12,731
and this jazzy lapel
and these crazy pockets
are his trademark.

812
00:54:12,815 --> 00:54:14,357
Where could I find
this Norman James?

813
00:54:14,439 --> 00:54:16,481
Would he be in
the New York telephone book?

814
00:54:16,565 --> 00:54:18,731
You don't think he'd have
an unlisted business number?

815
00:54:18,815 --> 00:54:20,648
He's not all that exclusive.

816
00:54:21,648 --> 00:54:24,440
What's that for?
For being the best girl
a deputy ever had.

817
00:54:24,524 --> 00:54:26,107
Well, hey,
how about my hamburger?

818
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:28,773
Stay right there.
I'll get you a truck
full of hamburgers.

819
00:54:29,649 --> 00:54:31,607
Rush this out, will you?

820
00:54:35,482 --> 00:54:37,399
To New York Police Department.

821
00:54:38,399 --> 00:54:41,732
Contact immediately,
Norman James.

822
00:54:42,315 --> 00:54:47,232
"Norman James made suit
as described for only one customer,

823
00:54:47,315 --> 00:54:49,024
"Randall E. Whittemore,

824
00:54:49,108 --> 00:54:51,524
"Claiborne Towers, New York.

825
00:54:51,607 --> 00:54:55,732
"Whittemore, Executive Vice President
of Kendon Mining Corporation,

826
00:54:55,816 --> 00:54:57,524
"currently on extended business trip."

827
00:54:57,607 --> 00:54:59,857
Pretty smart of you
to recognize that jacket.

828
00:54:59,941 --> 00:55:02,066
We hicks out here probably
never would have known about it.

829
00:55:02,149 --> 00:55:03,649
Janice recognized it.

830
00:55:03,732 --> 00:55:06,525
Do you think Mr. Kendon
is connected with this somehow?

831
00:55:06,608 --> 00:55:09,275
Well, let's face it.
He and Whittemore belonged
to the same company.

832
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:11,441
Daughter recognized the jacket.

833
00:55:11,525 --> 00:55:14,275
What if you go out
and have a little talk with Kendon?

834
00:55:14,358 --> 00:55:15,567
Yeah.

835
00:55:16,567 --> 00:55:19,775
On second thought,
it'd probably take
half the time if I went out there.

836
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:21,067
Well, if you want.

837
00:55:21,149 --> 00:55:23,150
No, no.
You know your way around.

838
00:55:23,233 --> 00:55:25,900
Besides, why send
an old man to do a boy's job?

839
00:55:43,150 --> 00:55:44,775
Hi.
Hi.

840
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:48,609
I'd like to see
your father.

841
00:55:48,942 --> 00:55:50,859
My father?

842
00:55:50,942 --> 00:55:52,609
Isn't this rather sudden?

843
00:55:52,693 --> 00:55:54,651
It's line of duty.

844
00:55:54,734 --> 00:55:57,109
Oh. Well, he and Bob
are fighting again.

845
00:55:57,192 --> 00:55:59,526
They're in the den.

846
00:55:59,609 --> 00:56:01,026
Did you find out
about the jacket?

847
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:02,276
Yeah.
Well, that's good.

848
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,068
You're getting somewhere.
I don't know.

849
00:56:04,151 --> 00:56:06,859
This case is better in some ways,
worse in others.

850
00:56:06,943 --> 00:56:08,068
We'll not discuss
it any further.

851
00:56:08,151 --> 00:56:10,609
That's fine with me,
because I'm sick of it.

852
00:56:10,693 --> 00:56:11,818
Dad?

853
00:56:11,901 --> 00:56:14,111
Mr. Martin is paying us
an official visit.

854
00:56:14,194 --> 00:56:15,444
Howdy.
Hi.

855
00:56:15,528 --> 00:56:18,905
Well, which one of you
two's in trouble this time?

856
00:56:18,989 --> 00:56:20,573
Oh, they're not in
any trouble, sir. I am.

857
00:56:20,656 --> 00:56:21,698
Oh?

858
00:56:21,781 --> 00:56:23,575
Uh, Mr. Kendon,

859
00:56:23,658 --> 00:56:26,867
when was the last time
you saw Mr. R.E. Whittemore?

860
00:56:26,951 --> 00:56:28,868
Randall Whittemore?
Yes, sir.

861
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:30,786
Let's see.

862
00:56:30,869 --> 00:56:34,163
Last May at the stockholder's
meeting in New York.

863
00:56:34,247 --> 00:56:35,706
You haven't seen him since?

864
00:56:35,789 --> 00:56:38,165
No. Why?

865
00:56:38,249 --> 00:56:40,083
Well, the man
who was found dead

866
00:56:40,166 --> 00:56:42,710
at the Kendon mine office
was Mr. R.E. Whittemore.

867
00:56:42,793 --> 00:56:43,751
What?
Yes, sir.

868
00:56:43,835 --> 00:56:45,836
Oh, no!
I'm afraid I'll have to ask you

869
00:56:45,919 --> 00:56:48,087
to come down
and identify him
at the morgue.

870
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:50,714
Of course.

871
00:56:51,631 --> 00:56:53,048
This is shocking.

872
00:56:53,132 --> 00:56:55,049
You didn't even know
he was coming out here?

873
00:56:55,133 --> 00:56:56,633
I had no idea.

874
00:56:56,717 --> 00:56:59,135
Hello? Yes, he's here.
Just a minute.

875
00:56:59,218 --> 00:57:00,927
Bob, it's for you.
Who is it?

876
00:57:01,011 --> 00:57:02,512
I don't know. A man.

877
00:57:03,721 --> 00:57:06,556
Mr. Kendon,
isn't it kind of strange,

878
00:57:06,639 --> 00:57:08,557
Hello? Oh.
his not getting in
touch with you?

879
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,975
Yes. It is strange.
Why don't you sit down?

880
00:57:12,017 --> 00:57:13,018
I'll be there right away.

881
00:57:13,851 --> 00:57:15,060
I wonder...

882
00:57:16,519 --> 00:57:19,104
I wonder
what he was here for?

883
00:57:20,605 --> 00:57:24,690
My guess is he found
someone was taking ore
out of the Kendon Mine.

884
00:57:26,108 --> 00:57:28,067
I think you're on the wrong track.

885
00:57:28,151 --> 00:57:30,985
First place,
you don't just walk into a mine

886
00:57:31,068 --> 00:57:33,361
and fall over
a high-grade pocket.

887
00:57:33,445 --> 00:57:35,404
You have to know
something about gold mining.

888
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:38,573
A lot of people around
here know about that.

889
00:57:38,656 --> 00:57:39,865
Yes.

890
00:57:39,948 --> 00:57:41,199
But even after you
discover the ore,

891
00:57:41,283 --> 00:57:42,908
you still have to
blast it out.

892
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:44,993
Now, that's hard to do.
Quietly.

893
00:57:46,702 --> 00:57:48,620
Do you have to blast?

894
00:57:49,287 --> 00:57:51,413
I suppose under
some circumstances

895
00:57:51,496 --> 00:57:54,456
you could get it out
with jackhammer and pick.

896
00:57:54,539 --> 00:57:57,625
But you still
have to get it out
and sell it somewhere.

897
00:58:00,627 --> 00:58:03,461
Taking a few hundred pounds
of gold ore at a time, say,

898
00:58:03,544 --> 00:58:07,796
six or seven
thousand dollars' worth,

899
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:10,798
you could load it onto a truck
or even a small plane.

900
00:58:12,215 --> 00:58:14,175
Yes, I suppose so.

901
00:58:14,258 --> 00:58:16,176
Excuse me.
I think I'll make
some coffee.

902
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:18,094
None for me. Thanks.

903
00:58:19,637 --> 00:58:20,970
Mr. Kendon,

904
00:58:22,096 --> 00:58:24,598
have you told me
everything you know
about this case?

905
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:29,475
What do you mean?

906
00:58:29,558 --> 00:58:32,852
I don't have to steal
from my own mine.

907
00:58:32,935 --> 00:58:35,728
I'm sorry
I have to ask you
these questions.

908
00:58:45,609 --> 00:58:47,693
Where's she going?

909
00:58:47,777 --> 00:58:49,277
I have no idea.

910
00:58:49,361 --> 00:58:51,195
You have any idea
where Bob went?

911
00:58:52,196 --> 00:58:55,280
Well, if he's not in a bar,
where he probably is,

912
00:58:55,364 --> 00:58:57,365
he might be out
at the crop duster's strip

913
00:58:57,448 --> 00:58:59,282
where we keep
the old company plane.

914
00:59:01,367 --> 00:59:02,785
I'll be back.

915
00:59:02,868 --> 00:59:05,244
That will be a pleasure
I can forego.

916
00:59:34,551 --> 00:59:36,511
You know you're not
supposed to call me
at home.

917
00:59:38,345 --> 00:59:40,304
Well, merciful heavens,

918
00:59:40,388 --> 00:59:43,014
look who got out of the wrong side
of the bed this morning.

919
00:59:43,098 --> 00:59:44,682
You know who was there
when you called?

920
00:59:44,765 --> 00:59:46,808
The deputy sheriff.
No!

921
00:59:46,891 --> 00:59:48,850
Let's finish loading the plane.

922
00:59:48,934 --> 00:59:50,644
I dug it all myself.

923
00:59:50,727 --> 00:59:52,645
And then we're off to Rio.

924
00:59:52,728 --> 00:59:54,270
Rio? Are you crazy?

925
00:59:54,354 --> 00:59:56,188
Why the sudden change
in our plans?

926
00:59:56,271 --> 00:59:58,314
We sell the stuff in Mexico
and then we head south.

927
00:59:58,398 --> 01:00:01,316
Kid, I know places in Rio
that make Las Vegas

928
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:05,026
look like a Sunday afternoon
in Philadelphia.

929
01:00:05,110 --> 01:00:06,735
You know, you remind me
of Charlie Piper.

930
01:00:06,819 --> 01:00:09,404
I had him figured
for a lazy loafer
from the start too.

931
01:00:09,487 --> 01:00:11,780
I'm glad I got rid of him.

932
01:00:11,863 --> 01:00:15,115
I got news for you.
If I could fly this crate,
I wouldn't need you either.

933
01:00:15,198 --> 01:00:17,074
You mean you killed
Charlie Piper?

934
01:00:17,157 --> 01:00:18,826
Oh, I should have, but I didn't.

935
01:00:18,909 --> 01:00:20,284
What a character. Just like you.

936
01:00:20,368 --> 01:00:22,160
Never did anything right.

937
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:24,373
I give him a job,
busting up some rocks.

938
01:00:24,456 --> 01:00:27,086
He lets an old geezer
with a trick suit
catch him at it.

939
01:00:27,169 --> 01:00:30,134
So I said to him, "All right,
Charlie, let him follow you
up to the canyon.

940
01:00:30,217 --> 01:00:31,720
"Then you shove him over the edge."

941
01:00:31,804 --> 01:00:34,892
Gets into a fight
and he can't even lick
an old man.

942
01:00:34,976 --> 01:00:37,021
Who's going to take care of him?

943
01:00:37,105 --> 01:00:38,650
Good old Scotty.

944
01:00:38,734 --> 01:00:39,861
That's cold-blooded murder!

945
01:00:39,944 --> 01:00:41,865
Oh, come off it, kid.

946
01:00:41,948 --> 01:00:44,077
This might have been
a cut caper of yours

947
01:00:44,161 --> 01:00:46,457
to get back at your old man
for being twice the man you are.

948
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:48,711
Me? I went along for the loot.

949
01:00:48,794 --> 01:00:51,382
That's worth the lives
of two men?

950
01:00:51,466 --> 01:00:53,344
Two? (CHUCKLES)

951
01:00:53,428 --> 01:00:55,307
I forgot to tell you about Eli.

952
01:00:56,392 --> 01:00:58,145
You murdered Eli!

953
01:00:58,228 --> 01:01:00,232
What do you want from me?

954
01:01:00,316 --> 01:01:03,906
He sees a picture of the old snooper
up on the office wall in Kendon.

955
01:01:03,989 --> 01:01:06,076
If I don't get rid of him
and the picture,

956
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,665
everybody in the
whole county would know
who the guy was.

957
01:01:08,749 --> 01:01:09,918
They already know!

958
01:01:10,001 --> 01:01:11,754
Know who?

959
01:01:11,837 --> 01:01:14,218
The headman of the whole
mining combine, that's all.

960
01:01:14,301 --> 01:01:16,262
Well, now, don't that
take the cake?

961
01:01:16,347 --> 01:01:18,350
Before the day's over,
they're going to know who we are.

962
01:01:20,437 --> 01:01:24,153
Here we are all wrapped up
snug as a bug in a rug
and ready to roll.

963
01:01:24,237 --> 01:01:25,781
Now you go to work,
daddy-o.

964
01:01:25,864 --> 01:01:28,035
We put on the lap strap,
turn on the no smoking sign...

965
01:01:28,118 --> 01:01:30,081
and away we go.

966
01:01:31,083 --> 01:01:32,126
No!

967
01:01:32,710 --> 01:01:35,341
Oh, kid, come on.
Don't be that way.

968
01:01:35,424 --> 01:01:38,137
If I said anything
about your old man
you didn't like,

969
01:01:38,221 --> 01:01:40,225
I'll apologize
all along the way.

970
01:01:42,521 --> 01:01:43,898
Come on.

971
01:01:43,982 --> 01:01:45,360
I'm not going.

972
01:01:46,236 --> 01:01:49,492
Oh, kid, don't be a drag.
You know I can't fly this thing.

973
01:01:52,874 --> 01:01:54,586
Kid.

974
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:56,965
I'm going to have to knock you
off the company payroll.

975
01:02:23,933 --> 01:02:25,435
Bobby!

976
01:02:27,064 --> 01:02:28,566
Bobby! (CRYING)

977
01:02:32,282 --> 01:02:33,785
Bobby.

978
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:51,986
Doll baby,
I didn't mean to knock him off,

979
01:02:52,069 --> 01:02:53,864
but you're going to be
my ticket out of here.

980
01:02:53,948 --> 01:02:55,952
Now come on.
Your car, let's drive.

981
01:02:59,417 --> 01:03:01,337
Nobody's going to dare
to throw a rap at me

982
01:03:01,421 --> 01:03:03,340
for fear of hitting you,
how's that for a hot flash?

983
01:03:03,424 --> 01:03:04,552
Back it up.

984
01:03:04,635 --> 01:03:06,346
I kid you not.
Back it up.

985
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:15,391
Car 3 calling KOA 776.

986
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:19,767
Come in Car 3.

987
01:04:19,851 --> 01:04:21,851
<i>George, let me talk
to the sheriff</i>

988
01:04:21,934 --> 01:04:23,560
Les.

989
01:04:23,643 --> 01:04:26,145
Yeah, Scotty O'Brien's our man.

990
01:04:26,228 --> 01:04:30,146
He's killed Bob Kendon,
taken off in Janice's car
with her as hostage.

991
01:04:30,229 --> 01:04:31,396
<i>Where are you?</i>

992
01:04:31,479 --> 01:04:32,647
Crop duster's strip.

993
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:34,814
With a flat tire
and a broken radiator.

994
01:04:34,897 --> 01:04:37,274
Now, he's heading north.

995
01:04:37,357 --> 01:04:40,316
Better notify Buzz
to warm up the planes.
We're going to need them.

996
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,650
Okay. I'll pick you up.

997
01:04:41,733 --> 01:04:43,401
George, get the emergency band.

998
01:04:46,985 --> 01:04:48,236
Attention, all units.

999
01:05:36,962 --> 01:05:38,670
Faster, hon, faster.

1000
01:05:40,462 --> 01:05:42,213
I said faster!

1001
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:46,299
That's better.
That's better.

1018
01:09:59,681 --> 01:10:00,807
Come on.

1019
01:10:01,099 --> 01:10:02,517
Billy Boy!

1020
01:10:04,145 --> 01:10:06,564
Where are you, Billy Boy?

1021
01:10:08,066 --> 01:10:10,319
Scotty, you lost your marbles?

1022
01:10:10,402 --> 01:10:12,947
Look, Billy Boy,
I've got a boat waiting
for me on the other side

1023
01:10:13,031 --> 01:10:14,741
and I need a ride,
and you're gonna
give me one.

1024
01:10:14,824 --> 01:10:17,745
Now, this thing is loaded.
How do you like those apples?
Let's move.

1025
01:10:17,828 --> 01:10:19,247
Do as he says.
He killed Bob.

1026
01:10:19,331 --> 01:10:20,707
Move! Move!

1027
01:10:53,539 --> 01:10:55,834
I see her Thunderbird
outside the tram shed.

1028
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:57,503
Seen any sign of them?

1029
01:10:57,586 --> 01:10:59,130
No, they must be inside.

1030
01:10:59,214 --> 01:11:00,882
<i>We're landing now.</i>

1031
01:11:00,965 --> 01:11:02,968
We'll be right there.
Get going.

1032
01:11:13,231 --> 01:11:14,358
Billy Boy, let's go.

1033
01:11:14,441 --> 01:11:16,610
If you don't pull that switch,
I'll have to pull this trigger.

1034
01:11:16,693 --> 01:11:18,571
That's going to make
hard feelings all the way around.

1035
01:11:19,948 --> 01:11:22,785
Now, do you get the message,
or does she?

1036
01:13:31,822 --> 01:13:32,823
Stop the bucket!

1037
01:13:32,906 --> 01:13:34,617
<i>Stop the bucket!</i>

1038
01:13:45,338 --> 01:13:47,550
Help me!
Somebody, help me!

1039
01:13:51,597 --> 01:13:52,973
Help me!

1040
01:13:56,185 --> 01:13:57,855
Save me!

1041
01:13:57,938 --> 01:13:59,273
Oh, my God !

1042
01:14:03,069 --> 01:14:05,155
Somebody, help me!

1043
01:14:05,238 --> 01:14:06,907
I can't make it!

1044
01:14:13,333 --> 01:14:15,043
I can't make it!

1045
01:14:43,870 --> 01:14:45,956
Oh, Les.

1046
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:48,209
Darling, don't let me go.

1047
01:14:48,292 --> 01:14:50,587
Don't you worry about that.

1048
01:14:50,671 --> 01:14:52,757
I've no intention of it, ever.

1049
01:14:58,097 --> 01:15:01,097
Hey, Ward, take us back.

1050
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:03,816
And be careful.
