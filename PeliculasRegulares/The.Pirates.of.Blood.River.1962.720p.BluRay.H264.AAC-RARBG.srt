1
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,079
Trouble.

2
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,471
"Uh!

3
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,117
Maggie.

4
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,950
Maggie. Maggie.

5
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,620
Maggie?

6
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,799
Hey.

7
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:58,023
-Jonathon. ... -Are you still afraid?

8
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,318
I am afraid. I'm afraid of all of them.

9
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:07,783
They're hard, and they're cruel and one day we'll be found out, and-

10
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:10,035
Well, we'll just wait for that day.

11
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,412
I love you, Maggie.

12
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,263
I am going to take you away.

13
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:36,148
There must be some place outside this island where we can find happiness.

14
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,349
[Maggie gasps]

15
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,281
Do you believe me now, Standing?

16
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,949
Your son...

17
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,947
and my wife.

18
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:52,657
I would never have believed it but for the evidence of my own eyes.

19
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:55,834
-I can explain, let me talk to you. -You have sinned in the eyes of God.

20
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,208
-You will not go unpunished. -By God?

21
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,461
I am the representative of God here.

22
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:02,791
My punishment is his.

23
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,296
Amen.

24
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,969
Arrest them.

25
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,797
Get after her!

26
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,577
Come back, girl!

27
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:27,968
Piranha.

28
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,263
Maggie, no! Maggie, come back!

29
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,056
Maggie, come back!

30
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,472
[Maggie yelping]

31
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,396
No.

32
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,108
[Maggie groans]

33
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,494
A judgment.

34
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,046
Thy will be done.

35
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,215
Thou shalt not commit adultery.

36
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,889
That is the Lord's commandment.

37
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:21,938
This unhappy woman took no heed of it,

38
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,266
and she was punished by God.

39
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,066
But this man was not punished.

40
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:33,283
So it becomes our duty to judge him here.

41
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,947
Do you deny the charge laid against you?

42
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:42,455
Yes. And I claim the right to defend the virtue of a woman

43
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,831
who cannot answer for herself.

44
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:45,333
[spectators] Aye.

45
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,632
Godfrey Mason, I deny you the right to sit upon that bench.

46
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,005
I am an elect-man of this community.

47
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:52,461
[Jonathon] You are also my accuser.

48
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,764
What kind of law permits the plaintiff to sit in judgment at the accused?

49
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,091
[spectators] Aye.

50
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:04,273
Jehovah's an eye for an eye.

51
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,350
[grunting]

52
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,281
-Trial over yet? -No, not yet, Henry.

53
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,780
-They've been in there long. -What about you?

54
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,487
It's devil's work, and Tom and I don't care to witness it.

55
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,289
With that lot on the bench, I pity poor Jonathon.

56
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,538
-God save him. -And all of us.

57
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,295
He's not on trial because he's immoral.

58
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:30,170
No, it's because he stands for everything that they're against.

59
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,967
The elders are afraid of him.

60
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:35,466
They'll see this opportunity of using the father to condemn his own son.

61
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,093
Then they'll have it all their own way.

62
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,890
[chattering]

63
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,896
We're waiting for the verdict, Henry.

64
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,610
I'm afraid it's a foregone conclusion.

65
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,321
Your father will have no choice.

66
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,658
It's hard for me to believe that a father could be so harsh

67
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:07,415
as to convict his own flesh and blood.

68
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,497
Jason Standing is a sick man, Bess.

69
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,583
But he's not beyond all human feeling.

70
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,134
[gavel pounding]

71
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,811
We're waiting for you, Jason.

72
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:40,820
Jonathon Standing...

73
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:45,575
you are charged with having broken one of the most sacred laws of God.

74
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,035
Through that sin, you have caused the death

75
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,746
of the unhappy woman who was your partner in it.

76
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,792
You have been found guilty.

77
00:09:56,638 --> 00:10:00,006
And as God's deputy, here in this community,

78
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,183
it is my duty to pronounce the sentence of this court upon you.

79
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,972
Before I do, have you anything to say?

80
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,104
Yes.

81
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,145
I am not guilty.

82
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,029
The cause of Maggie's death was fear.

83
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,944
Fear of her brutal husband.

84
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,034
Yes, fear is your weapon. It's a dangerous weapon.

85
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,287
One day it will recoil on your own heads.

86
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,458
[spectators] Aye!

87
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,046
We've heard enough.

88
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,294
Proceed.

89
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,795
The Ten Commandments...

90
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,890
are the prime laws by which our settlement is governed.

91
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:48,471
And the penalty for breaking any major one of them can,

92
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,932
as you know, be death.

93
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:57,734
But because our God is merciful, so we will be merciful.

94
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,610
[spectators] Aye.

95
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:04,946
Therefore, we have decided that you shall be taken from here,

96
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,656
and tomorrow, transported to the penal colony,

97
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,832
where you will remain for 15 years.

98
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,205
-[Spectators] No! -No!

99
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,503
- No!

100
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,456
[woman] No mercy. No.

101
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,422
[murmuring]

102
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,753
Take charge of your prisoner.

103
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,927
-Shame. -Shame.

104
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,100
Have courage.

105
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,096
[spectators exclaiming]

106
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,072
Do you know what you've done, Father?

107
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:44,026
You've sent him to die. No one can live in that place.

108
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,203
You've sent Jonathon to die. Your own son.

109
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,789
Can't you see that these men are using you?

110
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:00,130
Don't, Bess. It's no good. You're only hurting yourself.

111
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:06,715
Your grandfather would be very proud of you, Jason Standing.

112
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,508
Now, Bess, no crying. I don't wanna remember you like that.

113
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,603
I'm sorry this had to happen, Jonathon.

114
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,230
You did warn me.

115
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:02,313
It was different this time. I loved Maggie.

116
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,239
You wouldn't understand that.

117
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:08,034
I'm in love too, Jonathon.

118
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,532
Yes, I know.

119
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,372
Take care of her, Henry.

120
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,958
Try to see that my father comes to no harm.

121
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:25,089
Whatever he's done, whatever he's become, it isn't for himself.

122
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,420
I'll do what I can when the time comes.

123
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:32,222
There's got to be some change in this persecuted, tyranny-ridden place.

124
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,518
It will come.

125
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,392
Perhaps not your way, Jonathon, but it will come.

126
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,144
[man] Giddap, there.

127
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,256
[whip cracking]

128
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,747
Get on!

129
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,300
Mr. Jonathon Standing.

130
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:51,797
We are honored with such illustrious company, Mr. Standing.

131
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,726
And what a fine figure we have.

132
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,430
No wonder the ladies like you.

133
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,481
We'll see to it you don't get too fat.

134
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,025
We'll start you off nice and gently.

135
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,615
Don't forget to thank your lucky stars before you eat it.

136
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:02,834
Thank yours.

137
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,078
Get out of here!

138
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:07,005
Keep back! Keep back!

139
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,834
[bird squawking]

140
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,937
Come on, get moving.

141
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:10,819
[yells]

142
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,109
Get up there, after them!

143
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:24,449
After them!

144
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,296
Look out!

145
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,928
Run. Run!

146
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,387
[dogs whimpering]

147
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,189
[whimpering continues]

148
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:53,944
[dogs barking]

149
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:04,614
[barking continues]

150
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,472
[barking continues]

151
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,565
-Straight for the swamp. -Yeah.

152
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,872
[dogs barking]

153
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:23,201
[birds squawking, chirping]

154
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,127
[gasps]

155
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,888
-Here, help me. -I got you.

156
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:18,707
-Well, that's one less for us to bury. -Yeah.

157
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:02,876
Get up.

158
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:07,718
Get up!

159
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:10,633
Get up.

160
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:24,072
Well, hello, matey. What do we got here?

161
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:27,196
-What vessel are you from, huh? -I'm not off a ship.

162
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,199
-Maybe an eagle dropped you, eh? -Who fired that shot at you?

163
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,950
-Come on. -Who put these on you?

164
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,408
-Who put them on you, eh? -Answer my questions.

165
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:36,869
-Come on. -The settlement.

166
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,418
Inland.

167
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:39,962
I was a prisoner. I escaped.

168
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,757
Oh, well, you'd better come and see our captain.

169
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,800
Aye, he's an expert on punishment.

170
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,444
Thank you, Mr. Hench.

171
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,034
My name is LaRoche.

172
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,746
I understand that you live on this island.

173
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,041
That you have been in a penal settlement,

174
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,342
where you have been undergoing punishments.

175
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:30,259
Where is the main settlement?

176
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:35,310
About 50 miles

177
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:37,478
inland to the north.

178
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,681
We were not aware the island was inhabited.

179
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,853
When was this settlement founded?

180
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,355
Oh, a hundred years ago.

181
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,936
By Whom?

182
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,897
My great-grandfather.

183
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:50,108
-A refugee? -Yes.

184
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,692
-A Huguenot? -Yes.

185
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,951
The king must be displeased to have that wealth slip through his fingers.

186
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,406
I said nothing about wealth.

187
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,246
No, of course you didn't, no.

188
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,413
Sounds like quite a paradise, this island, doesn't it?

189
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:06,750
Just the sort of place we've always dreamed of, captain.

190
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:10,212
Must have been a wrench for you, leaving the settlement.

191
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:11,967
Well, I'm going back.

192
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,889
You're going back?

193
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,762
-For revenge? -No.

194
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:16,843
To help my friends.

195
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:19,520
As they would help you, it seems.

196
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:22,440
“Do unto others as you would be done by.” Our motto, really.

197
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,392
Our motto without a doubt.

198
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,522
We'll go with you.

199
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:34,577
With me? What for? There's nothing there for you.

200
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:38,247
On the contrary, I think there is a great deal for both of us.

201
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:41,122
I'm prepared to help you, well, shall we say,

202
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:44,499
get rid of some of the undesirable elements in your settlement?

203
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:48,629
I'm talking to a pirate. What could be your purpose in wanting to help me?

204
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,585
You underestimate us, Mr. Standing.

205
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,387
Pirates sometimes have other interests besides money.

206
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,473
I will admit that there is another reason

207
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,769
for my wanting to establish friendly relations with your people.

208
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:05,313
You have apparently existed on this island for many years...

209
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:06,976
undetected.

210
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:10,609
Now for me, in my profession,

211
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:14,033
there's a great advantage in having somewhere that is safe and secure.

212
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:18,078
Where we can rest between voyages and replenish our stores.

213
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,031
Ours is a very hard life, Mr. Standing,

214
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,833
and you can well understand how very often we long

215
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,036
for a quiet haven of rest like this.

216
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:28,672
For this,

217
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:32,384
you would help me to bring a just rule to the settlement?

218
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,587
You have my word.

219
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:36,298
You need me, I need you.

220
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:45,018
Strike off this gentleman's chains.

221
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:48,397
Get him some food and some fresh clothes.

222
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,819
We leave at daybreak.

223
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,523
Come on, matey. We'll look after you.

224
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:08,455
Oh, you haven't half got something to answer for, matey.

225
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,717
[Sputters]

226
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:19,390
-Mr. Hench. -Yes, captain?

227
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:22,218
I intend to reach the settlement by tomorrow nightfall.

228
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:24,098
Tell the men they must make better time.

229
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,351
Captain, the men haven't rested in six hours.

230
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:29,275
This isn't a Sunday afternoon picnic, Mr. Hench.

231
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,853
Get a move on there, you lubbers!

232
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,609
The captain wants you to make more speed.

233
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,532
You can tell the captain to go-

234
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,859
Tell the captain what, Brocaire?

235
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,160
[Spits]

236
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,830
All right, you men. Let's move, huh?

237
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,247
Alle, alle!

238
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,996
It's all right for the captain, he doesn't need sleep.

239
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,044
You gotta have sleep.

240
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:52,965
The captain doesn't need food nor water nor sleep nor nothing.

241
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:55,214
When he hears you moaning, he won't need you.

242
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:57,591
I don't need you to tell me.

243
00:25:58,015 --> 00:25:59,631
[shouting]

244
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:13,986
[shouting continues]

245
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:39,421
Diamonds, rubies, sapphires.

246
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:40,721
You're dreaming, man.

247
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:42,765
This time it may come true.

248
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,343
What are you gonna do with your share, Mr. Hench?

249
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,179
I do not count my chickens before I see them.

250
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:51,811
And then I wait until the eggs are hatched out.

251
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:56,021
If the captain is right about this egg, I will have my own ship.

252
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:59,107
-Brocaire? -For me, no more sea.

253
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:01,863
Just an island somewhere, like this.

254
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,695
Very peaceful.

255
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:07,999
Full of beautiful golden women... and no men.

256
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:10,827
[man] Peaceful? Oh, matey,

257
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:14,334
you've got a mighty quaint idea of what's peaceful.

258
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:21,137
Mr. Standing, have you ever wondered what you'd do if you found a fortune?

259
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:24,011
I've never been near one, I haven't had occasion to think about it.

260
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:26,638
-You sure about that? -Yes, quite sure.

261
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,810
That's not what the captain thinks.

262
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:34,271
You seem to set a lot of store by what the captain thinks.

263
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,819
I'm very close to the captain, Mr. Standing.

264
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:40,364
I understand his mind, I can read him like a book.

265
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,032
He's a great man, the captain.

266
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:44,861
As strong as a lion, as cunning as a mongoose.

267
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:46,411
And as vicious as a snake.

268
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,239
A very great man indeed, Mr. Standing.

269
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:52,042
And he knows every trick of the trade.

270
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:54,336
He's not like other men, he don't even sweat.

271
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,290
What's he thinking, Mack?

272
00:27:57,384 --> 00:28:00,046
You're so close to him, you must know what he's thinking.

273
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:02,674
I was daydreaming, Mr. Standing.

274
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,550
You were talking about a fortune.

275
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:08,726
You shouldn't never take no notice of what a man says in his sleep.

276
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,803
Happy dreams, Mr. Standing.

277
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:24,450
-Captain LaRoche. -Yes?

278
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,278
We struck a bargain before we started out here.

279
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:30,410
That's quite correct. The bargain still stands.

280
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,668
I hope you don't share the same illusion as one of your men.

281
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:36,337
And what is that?

282
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:39,541
Apart from the natural advantages the settlement has to offer you,

283
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,342
there's nothing else.

284
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:45,422
There's no fortune, no money and no treasure.

285
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:48,303
I believe you have made this point before.

286
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,556
The more you stress it, the more convinced I am.

287
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:57,229
You see, my men are always dreaming about treasure.

288
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,151
I encourage this.

289
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:02,196
Men who are faced with death almost every day of their lives

290
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,898
must have an incentive.

291
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:07,827
I suggest you get some rest, Mr. Standing.

292
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:10,492
Good night.

293
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,198
Good night.

294
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:32,014
-Bye, Dad. -Bye, Son.

295
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,185
Giddyap!

296
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:45,822
Women. What are we waiting for?

297
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,165
[screaming]

298
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:06,877
Come on, come on.

299
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,007
Come on, come on.

300
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:14,969
Come on. Come on here.

301
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:30,197
No!

302
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:33,404
Oh, no, no.

303
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,744
[laughing]

304
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:44,502
Mr. Hench ain't exactly enjoying himself, matey.

305
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,259
Matey!

306
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,636
Up to your usual tricks again, I see, Mr. Hench.

307
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,721
He attacked me when I wasn't looking, captain.

308
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,726
A very strategic maneuver if I may say so.

309
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:03,149
It doesn't seem to have done him very much good.

310
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:06,149
-Are these people friends of yours? -They are friends of mine.

311
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,446
This was going to be a peaceful mission.

312
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,400
It was. Unfortunately, human nature is apt to determine

313
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,452
where peace ends and strife begins.

314
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,997
Mr. Hench, you will consider yourself severely reprimanded.

315
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:18,495
[Laughs]

316
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:19,950
Reprimanded, eh?

317
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:23,663
Just like the blooming Royal Navy, ain't we, captain?

318
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:25,748
We are ready to leave, Mr. Standing.

319
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:28,083
-Not with me. -Very well.

320
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:31,887
I think we can probably find our own way to the settlement from here.

321
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:34,431
-Your purpose in going there? -We made a bargain.

322
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:37,101
We made a bargain when I didn't know you and now I do.

323
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:39,770
As you observed earlier, Mr. Standing, we are pirates.

324
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,689
And sometimes we are inclined to harshness.

325
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:46,526
However, there is one thing I will not tolerate and that is mutiny. Tie him up.

326
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,271
Matey.

327
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,037
With your permission, Mr. Standing, we will now leave.

328
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:33,528
Dad.

329
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:36,656
Dad,Dad.

330
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:38,532
No, Timothy, no.

331
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,572
You can't help him.

332
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:44,289
Dad, they killed him?

333
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:48,836
Go and find Uncle Henry and tell him what happened.

334
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,007
Go, quickly. Go.

335
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:55,846
Uncle Henry!

336
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,512
-Uncle Henry! -What's the matter, Timothy?

337
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:01,014
Some men killed my father.

338
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:04,347
-They killed him. Some men- -Wait now, what men?

339
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:06,773
I don't know, I've never seen them before.

340
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,942
-Jonathon was with them. -Jonathon?

341
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:10,986
-Are you sure it was Jonathon? -Yes.

342
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:13,905
-Where are they now? -They went towards the settlement.

343
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,154
-Are your mother and sister all right? -Yes.

344
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,235
Take my horse and go to the settlement.

345
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,742
Warn them they may be attacked. I'll go to your mother.

346
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,197
Get out of here.

347
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:28,913
[ringing]

348
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,676
God has seen fit to warn us of catastrophe.

349
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:36,754
Let us, like Noah, take heed.

350
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,890
-Our island has been invaded. -What happened, Father?

351
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:48,144
Blackthorne has been murdered. Take the children to the great hall.

352
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:51,819
Get to the stockade, get your guns. Arm yourselves!

353
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:59,656
The gates! Close the gates!

354
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,339
Come and get the guns!

355
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,801
-What. . . ? -All right, don't push.

356
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,378
Armed with the gun.

357
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,214
All right, take it calm.

358
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,763
You take up positions. Muskets, arrange up on either side of me.

359
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,145
Take the powder.

360
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:35,563
Right, away you 90-

361
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:51,203
Load your muskets.

362
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:54,086
Hold your fire until I give the order.

363
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:19,364
If you're trying to assess their chances of fighting us off,

364
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,692
you'd do well to look at the men around you.

365
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:28,074
How many firearms do you suppose your friends have?

366
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:29,533
Mr. Standing?

367
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:33,830
If you want to save them from annihilation, go and talk to them.

368
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:37,129
Tell them that if they resist me, they can expect no mercy.

369
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,008
Tell them to let us in.

370
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:42,463
So you can rob them of their possessions and slaughter them all?

371
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,720
If I kill, it is to achieve a purpose, not for the sake of killing.

372
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,222
-You have my word on that. -Your word?

373
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,643
Well, Mr. Standing?

374
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:58,688
As you say, if they resist, the result will be the same.

375
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:00,693
A wise deduction.

376
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:02,775
I wish you every success.

377
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:06,741
Get moving.

378
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:14,836
There must be 30 at least.

379
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:16,334
All armed, I imagine.

380
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,041
We've got about 15 muskets between us.

381
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,671
God is on our side.

382
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:37,643
They come in peace.

383
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,728
God has answered our prayers.

384
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:47,611
Why, it's Jonathon.

385
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:57,288
Father, I have a message for you from the leader of these men.

386
00:36:57,382 --> 00:37:00,920
-Who are they? -They are pirates. I am their prisoner.

387
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,967
I've been forced to give you an ultimatum.

388
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,544
Proceed.

389
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,471
They are looking for plunder.

390
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:08,515
They believe there are riches in the settlement.

391
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,763
They're obsessed with the idea that there's treasure.

392
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:14,347
-You have told them this is true? -No, how could I when there is none?

393
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:17,399
They will be convinced only if you allow them to search.

394
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,692
-And if I refuse? -They will attack.

395
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:23,318
Father, I beg of you, surrender.

396
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:26,116
It's the only chance of saving the lives of our people.

397
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:28,443
This is a trick. He's in league with them himself.

398
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:31,155
Whatever I have done, I'm no traitor. My father knows this.

399
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,458
Allow him to think and speak for himself.

400
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:39,838
-What is your answer? -This is our answer.

401
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:49,089
[gunshot]

402
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,674
[Jason] Hold your fire.

403
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:11,035
Take aim.

404
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,786
Open fire.

405
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:57,824
The captain wants you.

406
00:38:57,919 --> 00:38:59,409
-Mack. -Right, mate.

407
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:06,299
Take six men and work around to the back of the stockade.

408
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:07,968
Round up the women and children.

409
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,275
Tom.

410
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,695
The horses.

411
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,153
Jonathon.

412
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,124
The gates.

413
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:58,848
Come on!

414
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:37,091
Those men at the back there, come here and fill these positions.

415
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,911
Mason! Mason!

416
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:52,382
Jason, stop firing!

417
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,089
Cease fire! Stop!

418
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,174
Stop! Cease fire!

419
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:02,259
-Cease fire! -Hold.

420
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,390
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

421
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,517
-Hold! -Hold it!

422
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:09,725
-Cease fire. Come on. -Hold.

423
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:12,732
Forby, look after the horses. Brocaire, deal with the settlers.

424
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:14,483
The rest of you stay with me.

425
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,780
Get them inside.

426
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,241
-Jonathon, Jonat- -Get back.

427
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:20,944
Get them all back.

428
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:31,621
[Laughs]

429
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,981
Fortunately for you, I have a reason for keeping you alive.

430
00:42:58,076 --> 00:42:59,658
Which of these men is your father?

431
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:02,202
I am Jason Standing. Leading elect-man of this settlement.

432
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,905
If your reason for coming here is to find loot or treasure,

433
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,660
you will search in vain.

434
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,537
I am of a different opinion.

435
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:11,416
Wealthy refugees seldom leave their treasures behind.

436
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:13,497
Tell us where it is and we will leave.

437
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:20,462
What is that building?

438
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,638
That is our place of justice and of worship.

439
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:27,844
Look after our friend and bring the others inside there.

440
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:18,607
Our terms for leaving you unmolested are very simple.

441
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:20,188
There is no treasure.

442
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:23,992
We shall remain here until one of you speaks.

443
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,820
And we shall use whatever means are necessary.

444
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:30,991
Each day that you remain silent, two of you will hang.

445
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:33,167
Oh, no. Oh, no.

446
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,420
Starting from now.

447
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:43,011
Our friends shall draw for the honor of being the first to die.

448
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:44,383
Come now, me hearties.

449
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:48,216
Join in old Mack's game of chance. Come, sir, draw one.

450
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:52,145
And you, my friend, don't be shy. There's only two of you to go.

451
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:56,270
You, grandpa, you've had a good life. You don't mind going, I'm sure.

452
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,650
Hold them up.

453
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:15,417
Jason, I-

454
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:18,664
Captain?

455
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:20,214
Take them outside.

456
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:22,542
No!

457
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:24,753
-And clear this place. -No!

458
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,713
-No! -Oh, no!

459
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:30,550
No!

460
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:33,979
You're a lucky man, Mr. Standing. Next time, it may be your turn.

461
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:36,181
The answer will be the same.

462
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,686
We do not yield to the devil.

463
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:43,146
A very noble and praiseworthy sentiment.

464
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:49,486
You may change your mind when you find how persuasive the devil can be.

465
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:56,663
He fair gives you the creeps, don't he, captain?

466
00:45:57,505 --> 00:45:58,836
I don't think he likes us.

467
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:03,959
Well, maybe he likes you better than he likes me.

468
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:09,260
[laughing]

469
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:23,569
Hello, me old matey.

470
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:25,693
[Laughs]

471
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:30,277
Hello, there. Having a good time? Have a drink.

472
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:39,002
Wait on, mateys, there. Wait for Uncle Mack.

473
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:48,629
Away, me hearties!

474
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:51,385
My, she's a hot little beastie, this one.

475
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:55,059
Hey, a nice slow canter's what I fancy.

476
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:56,386
Good for the liver.

477
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,721
Come on there. Hey, hey.

478
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:03,856
My, she's changed her complexion since we first saw her. Forward.

479
00:47:05,281 --> 00:47:06,817
Captain.

480
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,238
[gunshot]

481
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,915
I would have done it but then I haven't had to eat them.

482
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:23,713
[Laughs]

483
00:47:27,053 --> 00:47:29,340
The first cut's for the captain.

484
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:47,604
Where are you going, my pretty?

485
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,735
-Leave her alone. -I seen her first, Hench.

486
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:52,237
Mr. Hench, and I said let go of her.

487
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:55,946
You are not on board now, Mr. Hench, so this woman stays with me.

488
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,530
All right, Brocaire.

489
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:01,163
If that's the way you want it, I'm a mate to this crew.

490
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:04,621
And when I say do something, you do it.

491
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:07,002
So now I am going to slit your nose,

492
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:10,176
and then we will see how you get on with the women.

493
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:11,593
Mr. Hench?

494
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:27,026
A dispute?

495
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:28,979
No dispute, captain.

496
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:31,030
Just a friendly argument.

497
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:32,482
That's right, captain.

498
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:34,692
Just friendly.

499
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,492
You, girl...

500
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:42,666
come here.

501
00:48:43,671 --> 00:48:44,911
Up here.

502
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:59,009
Are you the cause of all this?

503
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:02,974
I asked you a question.

504
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:05,306
Is it you these two men are arguing over?

505
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:10,945
I don't care. They're both pigs.

506
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,487
[men laughing]

507
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:14,566
-Answer me, please. -Yes.

508
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,119
Well, Mr. Hench,

509
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:22,122
we have ways of settling these matters.

510
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,456
Very well, captain.

511
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:32,588
Mack.

512
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:34,256
Mr. Hench.

513
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:37,634
Mateys, clear the way for them, back with the tables.

514
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:03,080
Jonathon?

515
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:05,033
Quiet. There are guards back there.

516
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:07,118
-You all right? -Yes.

517
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:12,416
-Where have they got our people? -Most of them are in the blockhouse.

518
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:21,890
Come on.

519
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:31,355
Five of them. What do these cutthroats want?

520
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:34,483
-Treasure. A non-existent treasure. -Treasure?

521
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:39,026
-You're wrong, Jonathon. It does exist. -What do you mean?

522
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,531
My father told me about it before he died.

523
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:44,865
When our people first came to the island, they were very rich,

524
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:47,826
and they brought their possessions with them, mainly gold.

525
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,378
There's one man who knows where it's hidden, your father.

526
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:52,626
[man] I'm going inside to get some water.

527
00:50:58,013 --> 00:50:59,469
Mr. Hench.

528
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,606
Start.

529
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,089
You must stop them.

530
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,382
It's barbaric.

531
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:39,460
They are fighting over you, you should be honored.

532
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,744
Mate, kill him.

533
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:52,079
[men laughing]

534
00:52:59,051 --> 00:53:00,883
-Three left. -Bide your time.

535
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:04,880
-How many horses in the corral? -About 12.

536
00:53:06,642 --> 00:53:09,054
Then we'll release ten of the boys.

537
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:11,385
With us, that'll make one man for each horse.

538
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:14,226
I'm staying here.

539
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:16,557
-You're what? -If we're going to save our people,

540
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:19,394
somebody's got to persuade my father to give up that treasure.

541
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:21,604
-Do you think you can do that? -I can only try.

542
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:26,075
If we do release the men, don't attack the pirates until they're in the open.

543
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:28,778
They're bound to leave sooner or later, with or without the treasure.

544
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:03,946
[tapping]

545
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:17,539
[pounding]

546
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:31,056
[taps]

547
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:48,365
Oh, Mama.

548
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:56,081
You done it!

549
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:58,541
There you are!

550
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:02,417
[pounding]

551
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:04,923
Very good, Mr. Hench. Very good.

552
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:07,172
All right, girl.

553
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:13,174
Well, go on. What are you waiting for?

554
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:22,065
Go on.

555
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:47,458
[laughing]

556
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:55,467
[laughing]

557
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:57,552
You would want to play games?

558
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,596
Bess.

559
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:19,786
Go open the main gate as quickly as you can.

560
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:42,471
Silence!

561
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:44,398
-Silence! -Shut up!

562
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,068
So you're leaving us, captain?

563
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:54,530
Take the carcass to the ship and put it in my cabin.

564
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:59,239
And if it answers you back, give it a hundred lashes.

565
00:57:01,043 --> 00:57:06,664
Mr. Brocaire, stand up and salute the captain.

566
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:09,374
What's this? insubordination?

567
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:13,462
Captain, there's mutiny aboard the ship.

568
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:17,632
-What punishment do you prescribe? -That's enough.

569
00:57:17,726 --> 00:57:21,219
But it's mutiny, sir. Mutiny must be punished.

570
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:22,724
I said that's enough.

571
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:24,896
Mr. Hench,

572
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:31,025
give that man 250 lashes.

573
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:33,731
He's not at all well.

574
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:35,657
Come here.

575
00:57:35,744 --> 00:57:38,577
Yes, sir. Captain LaRoche.

576
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:42,328
It's mutiny, sir. Mutiny must be punished.

577
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:43,782
Correct.

578
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,751
You will learn that no one is indispensable.

579
00:57:57,641 --> 00:58:00,508
Come on, hurry up. Pick up some arms, get the horses.

580
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,610
[gunshot]

581
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:33,962
Stop firing.

582
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:37,712
Look to the other prisoners.

583
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:44,010
No doubt you are responsible for this.

584
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:45,890
Why didn't you join your friends?

585
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:49,599
I hoped to serve my people better by staying behind.

586
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:51,816
Hench?

587
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:55,271
-Mr. Hench? -He is here, captain.

588
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,487
Where are the men who are supposed to be on guard?

589
00:59:02,581 --> 00:59:05,915
You will find two of them over there with their necks broken.

590
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:07,583
Deal with those with necks intact.

591
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:10,206
Double the watch around the stockade. Now get out.

592
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,165
Aye, captain.

593
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:21,467
There is one way in which you can help your people

594
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,094
and save their lives.

595
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:25,847
Find the treasure.

596
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:28,645
Then let me talk to my father.

597
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:31,064
Your father, does he know where it is?

598
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:33,108
-Let me talk to him. -Very well.

599
00:59:33,195 --> 00:59:35,436
You have the whole night in which to talk.

600
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:36,816
Make the most of it.

601
00:59:47,042 --> 00:59:48,578
You wish to speak to me?

602
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:50,250
Yes, Father.

603
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:52,453
LaRoche has told me to give you his final warning.

604
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:58,759
He says that if you don't tell him where the treasure is by tomorrow morning,

605
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:02,088
he will slaughter every man, woman and child in the settlement.

606
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,932
Oh, Father, have you no conscience?

607
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,475
Conscience?

608
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:10,145
You dare to speak to me of conscience?

609
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:13,145
You who have already bartered your soul to the devil?

610
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:15,977
What value is life on earth at the cost of your soul?

611
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:18,062
People have a right to look into their own conscience.

612
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:19,738
They have a right to live.

613
01:00:20,909 --> 01:00:24,152
Father, I beg of you to show them mercy.

614
01:00:24,246 --> 01:00:26,032
Talk to your friend, the devil.

615
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:27,739
Ask him to show mercy.

616
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:32,493
If you beg me now till the end of time, the answer will be the same.

617
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:35,162
You also will die, Father.

618
01:00:35,257 --> 01:00:38,500
Do I fear death when I can face my maker with clean hands

619
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:40,129
and purity of thought?

620
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:45,214
What would be his answer?

621
01:00:49,104 --> 01:00:51,436
The answer of a God-fearing man.

622
01:00:58,155 --> 01:01:00,817
You, Jonathon Standing, are a disgrace to our name.

623
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,147
Disciple of the devil.

624
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:11,123
You would understand none of this.

625
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:14,083
I curse the very day you were born.

626
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:20,878
My grandfather's secret will die with me.

627
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:25,629
From above, he will rejoice in my decision.

628
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:29,474
His spirit has already entered mine to give me strength.

629
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:55,827
Yesterday, I ordered the execution of two of your elect-men.

630
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:58,036
You all know why.

631
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:01,374
Since then, however, I've made a discovery for myself.

632
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:06,171
If I'm right about this, we shall leave immediately,

633
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:07,880
harming no one else.

634
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,221
If I am wrong...

635
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:18,598
Remove the statue.

636
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:20,024
No! No!

637
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:22,148
You mustn't! You can't!

638
01:02:54,354 --> 01:02:55,970
All right, get to work.

639
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:21,457
We've reached bottom, captain.

640
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:23,209
There is nothing but rock.

641
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:27,544
Doesn't seem as if the treasure wants to be found, does it, captain?

642
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:35,892
Mr. Hench...

643
01:03:37,022 --> 01:03:39,263
you will see to it that no one remains alive.

644
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:40,518
Get up!

645
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:42,269
Guard the doors!

646
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,725
No one is to escape!

647
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,278
Make haste there! Make haste!

648
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:51,567
For the last time, tell them where it is before it's too late.

649
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:59,166
-No. No, don't touch it! -LaRoche!

650
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:00,617
LaRoche!

651
01:04:01,296 --> 01:04:02,286
Captain.

652
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:11,093
Halt!

653
01:04:23,735 --> 01:04:25,021
-There's your gold. -Gold.

654
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:26,693
Solid gold.

655
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:29,612
Get back.

656
01:04:34,496 --> 01:04:36,328
Now leave us in peace.

657
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:38,121
Peace?

658
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:41,496
Your friends who have escaped, do they want peace?

659
01:04:41,586 --> 01:04:44,453
Get this thing onto the strongest wagon and prepare to leave.

660
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:47,665
Yes, we shall be taking two hostages with us.

661
01:04:47,759 --> 01:04:49,341
And who will they be?

662
01:04:50,178 --> 01:04:51,714
Father and son.

663
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:55,055
Very well, release these people and start to move out.

664
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:57,303
All right, release them!

665
01:04:57,394 --> 01:04:59,135
Get them outside, quickly.

666
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:03,680
Get on the rope. Pull.

667
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:07,142
Pull.

668
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:42,810
They've left the settlement, Henry.

669
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:44,934
They've taken Jonathon and the old man.

670
01:05:45,024 --> 01:05:46,685
-Which way are they heading? -East.

671
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:49,814
Making for the mouth of the river, back to their ship.

672
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:53,522
-What about the treasure? -Well, they had something on a cart.

673
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:56,483
Looked like the statue of old Simeon Standing, the founder.

674
01:05:56,578 --> 01:05:58,819
That could be the treasure.

675
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:00,745
If it is, it's mighty heavy.

676
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:04,245
They're gonna bypass the swamp and take the main track through the bush.

677
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:06,702
They'll be in Pine Valley about an hour after sunup.

678
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:09,587
That's where we make our first strike.

679
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:11,711
All right, boys, go get some sleep.

680
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:22,555
What will happen to Jonathon and my father?

681
01:06:23,688 --> 01:06:24,803
We'll get them out, Bess.

682
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:30,313
I'm afraid I'm flying false colors for the moment, Bess.

683
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:32,360
I'm no man of action.

684
01:06:32,447 --> 01:06:34,529
Perhaps I think too much to be brave.

685
01:06:34,616 --> 01:06:36,027
That's my excuse anyway.

686
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:41,241
But I don't like fighting and killing. And I don't like what I have to do.

687
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:44,119
But now the pirates have found the treasure,

688
01:06:44,209 --> 01:06:45,825
why don't you let them take it away?

689
01:06:47,587 --> 01:06:49,419
It isn't as simple as all that, Bess.

690
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:55,717
The treasure stands for more than just gold.

691
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:57,339
To us, I mean.

692
01:06:58,556 --> 01:06:59,637
It's a...

693
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:02,679
A kind of symbol of freedom.

694
01:07:04,145 --> 01:07:06,637
It's what Jonathon's great-grandfather stood for

695
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:08,597
when he organized a flight from persecution.

696
01:07:09,776 --> 01:07:12,939
And someone thought it fit to commemorate him with a statue.

697
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,519
Somewhere along the line,

698
01:07:14,614 --> 01:07:16,946
greedy, ambitious men have betrayed old Simeon.

699
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,863
But I think he's still watching over us.

700
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:24,454
And the pirates aren't gonna take him from this island,

701
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:25,747
not if I can help it.

702
01:07:26,793 --> 01:07:28,784
Now, you'd better get some sleep yourself.

703
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:37,959
[snoring]

704
01:07:44,644 --> 01:07:46,260
[LaRoche] Mr. Hench?

705
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:54,105
Get the men moving.

706
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:56,027
All right, get stirring.

707
01:07:57,365 --> 01:07:59,572
Come on, we're moving out now.

708
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:02,363
Get up.

709
01:08:02,453 --> 01:08:03,739
And you.

710
01:08:09,711 --> 01:08:10,826
You too.

711
01:08:18,136 --> 01:08:19,718
[stammering]

712
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:23,554
Don't push us too hard today, Mr. Hench,

713
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:25,257
if you know what is good for you.

714
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:32,814
The captain knows what's good for him, all right.

715
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:33,890
Yeah.

716
01:08:33,985 --> 01:08:36,352
Don't do none of the work, just gives the orders.

717
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:39,154
“Come here. Do this. Go there.”

718
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:42,528
Then takes 10 times our share when he's divvying out the gold.

719
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:43,825
Yeah.

720
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:14,230
[gunshot]

721
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:20,895
Take cover!

722
01:09:29,624 --> 01:09:31,490
-Here we go. -Charge.

723
01:09:46,808 --> 01:09:48,094
All of them.

724
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:01,903
Jonathon, on the back. Come on.

725
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:33,267
-Father, come on. -Leave him.

726
01:10:33,354 --> 01:10:35,937
Jonathon, leave him.

727
01:10:36,023 --> 01:10:37,263
Get away.

728
01:10:37,984 --> 01:10:40,726
-Get away from me. -Jonathon!

729
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:47,157
I think you're losing one of your hostages, captain.

730
01:11:03,551 --> 01:11:05,963
Stop! Mr. Hench, get them back here!

731
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:07,384
Get back here!

732
01:11:07,472 --> 01:11:09,804
The captain wants you all back!

733
01:11:11,893 --> 01:11:13,349
Go on, on the cart.

734
01:11:13,436 --> 01:11:14,676
You too.

735
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:16,978
Come on.

736
01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:21,524
One, two, three, four, five, six.

737
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:23,897
There are about seven or eight of them left.

738
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:25,854
They know this island better than we do.

739
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:27,985
-How many have we lost? -Six.

740
01:11:28,075 --> 01:11:30,066
Six. That leaves 15.

741
01:11:30,161 --> 01:11:31,276
Fifteen against eight.

742
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:33,327
They know this island better than we do.

743
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:36,076
By my calculations, we shall reach the river by tomorrow nightfall.

744
01:11:36,167 --> 01:11:38,204
-And then? -I'm not a prophet.

745
01:11:39,504 --> 01:11:41,336
All right.

746
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:42,912
Get moving.

747
01:11:52,433 --> 01:11:54,470
-Where's Father? -Look after Henry.

748
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:57,973
Get some water and fix some bandages for the boys.

749
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,615
Don't take it so hard, Jonathon.

750
01:12:10,701 --> 01:12:13,068
I should have stayed to look after him.

751
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,036
They'll kill him, Henry.

752
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:18,080
Perhaps that's why he stayed. If the statue goes,

753
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:19,874
I don't believe your father would wish to live.

754
01:12:19,961 --> 01:12:21,372
Why not?

755
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:26,252
In his mind, he's protecting the statue, not because it's gold.

756
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:29,460
He sees the religion and ideals of your great-grandfather

757
01:12:29,554 --> 01:12:31,136
in the process of being destroyed.

758
01:12:31,222 --> 01:12:32,337
Yes, but-

759
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:38,719
Well, maybe all this has opened his eyes to the truth.

760
01:12:39,814 --> 01:12:42,522
Back in the settlement, he was too weak to fight the men

761
01:12:42,608 --> 01:12:45,691
who have long since forgotten why we came here.

762
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:47,644
Jonathon, a few months ago, you said to me:

763
01:12:47,738 --> 01:12:49,900
“Try and see that no harm comes to my father.

764
01:12:49,991 --> 01:12:52,358
Whatever he's done, he hasn't done it for himself.”

765
01:12:52,451 --> 01:12:53,737
Well, you were right.

766
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:58,326
Yes, I understand.

767
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:02,283
I only hope it isn't too late.

768
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:06,580
They're following the same trail, Henry.

769
01:13:06,674 --> 01:13:08,335
-We're all ready with the first trap. -Good.

770
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:50,757
It's too late, matey.

771
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:00,846
There'll be more of this.

772
01:14:01,479 --> 01:14:04,062
Unleash the statue. We'll carry it the rest of the way.

773
01:14:04,148 --> 01:14:05,513
We'll have to carry it.

774
01:14:05,608 --> 01:14:07,519
Isn't it time we made use of our hostage?

775
01:14:08,611 --> 01:14:10,101
[LaRoche] Yes, he can lead the way.

776
01:14:11,781 --> 01:14:12,942
Standing.

777
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:19,452
All right, I'll need six of you. The rest of you look to your guns.

778
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:24,846
Look out, the tree!

779
01:16:30,795 --> 01:16:32,035
Mr. Hench.

780
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:50,849
Mr. Hench?

781
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:53,021
What are you waiting for?

782
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:57,652
The men are going to give trouble, captain.

783
01:16:57,738 --> 01:16:59,820
At least some of them will.

784
01:16:59,907 --> 01:17:01,648
Trouble? To whom?

785
01:17:01,742 --> 01:17:04,109
They are scared. They don't want to go on.

786
01:17:04,203 --> 01:17:06,365
The only other way to go is back.

787
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:08,446
Perhaps they would prefer that?

788
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:12,743
What are your plans when you get to the river?

789
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:15,495
You tell them, captain.

790
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:28,724
We are only a few miles from the river.

791
01:17:28,811 --> 01:17:30,677
When we get there, we are going to build a raft

792
01:17:30,771 --> 01:17:33,604
and float the statue downstream until we reach the ship.

793
01:17:33,691 --> 01:17:36,023
And who's going with the statue, captain?

794
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:37,851
Whoever wishes to go.

795
01:17:37,945 --> 01:17:40,778
It'll have to be a big raft to take the statue and all of us.

796
01:17:40,865 --> 01:17:42,981
There won't be as many as there are now.

797
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:45,191
The islanders will see to that, captain.

798
01:17:45,286 --> 01:17:48,495
What are they gonna be doing while we're building the raft?

799
01:17:48,581 --> 01:17:50,948
I doubt they'll neglect us, but we still outnumber them.

800
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:53,874
We outnumbered them when the trees fell.

801
01:17:53,961 --> 01:17:56,043
Yes, captain, we outnumbered them

802
01:17:56,130 --> 01:17:59,339
when Baily and Shaw spiked their guts on the bamboo stakes.

803
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:00,586
-Yeah. -Yeah.

804
01:18:03,721 --> 01:18:05,758
We'll move on, Mr. Hench.

805
01:18:48,474 --> 01:18:52,138
It's all right for him, he has the lion's share.

806
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:55,471
-I'm all for getting back to the ship. -Yeah, well, me too.

807
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:57,146
What chance do we have on a raft?

808
01:18:57,233 --> 01:19:00,942
With luck, we shall reach the ship in an hour. Start building the raft.

809
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:03,978
Captain, this is as far as we go.

810
01:19:05,824 --> 01:19:07,815
That's right, as far as we go.

811
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:09,947
We are leaving the statue here.

812
01:19:10,037 --> 01:19:11,778
Leave it where it is.

813
01:19:12,623 --> 01:19:14,990
Leave it where it is. Back to the ship.

814
01:19:23,384 --> 01:19:24,715
And who will be next?

815
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:27,464
Oh, not me, captain.

816
01:19:27,554 --> 01:19:28,965
I'm with you.

817
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:38,516
Drop the gun...

818
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:41,265
captain.

819
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:47,522
We'll build the raft and we'll take the risks,

820
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:49,323
just like we always do.

821
01:19:49,994 --> 01:19:52,361
But you'll not be coming with us.

822
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:54,411
Take his gun, Mr. Hench.

823
01:19:56,292 --> 01:20:01,037
I like my wine in my belly, captain, not to drown in.

824
01:20:01,964 --> 01:20:05,002
All right, start felling the trees to make the raft.

825
01:20:05,092 --> 01:20:06,878
Come on, make haste there.

826
01:20:08,053 --> 01:20:10,385
If he gives any trouble, kill him.

827
01:20:11,765 --> 01:20:14,097
If I have a mind, I might do that anyway.

828
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:06,768
All right.

829
01:21:13,327 --> 01:21:15,568
[horse whinnies]

830
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:22,161
Look to your guns.

831
01:21:22,252 --> 01:21:23,583
Take cover.

832
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,481
Good girl.

833
01:22:34,408 --> 01:22:35,614
Load this.

834
01:22:45,586 --> 01:22:47,998
I've still got one for you, captain.

835
01:22:48,088 --> 01:22:49,578
[Clicks]

836
01:22:57,931 --> 01:22:59,296
-Powder! -We're out!

837
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:08,393
Make for the raft.

838
01:25:27,998 --> 01:25:29,284
Bess, look.
