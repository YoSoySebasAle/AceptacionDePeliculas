1
00:04:07,284 --> 00:04:08,918
We're not turning around. He's gone!

2
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:10,165
What do you mean, "He's gone"?

3
00:04:10,245 --> 00:04:12,356
He was still moving.
I fucking saw him still moving.

4
00:04:12,456 --> 00:04:13,881
We killed people!

5
00:04:14,082 --> 00:04:15,837
What do you mean?
Turn the fucking car around!

6
00:04:15,917 --> 00:04:17,843
He's gone! What are we supposed to do?

7
00:04:18,044 --> 00:04:20,447
Damn it, this shit's not worth it
for me to leave him there!

8
00:04:20,547 --> 00:04:21,931
We killed people, man.

9
00:04:22,132 --> 00:04:24,767
God damn it! Please, I'm begging you.
He's my fucking brother.

10
00:04:24,968 --> 00:04:26,068
I said this would happen.

11
00:04:26,261 --> 00:04:27,603
Fuck you, Archie!

12
00:04:27,804 --> 00:04:28,771
Fuck you!

13
00:04:28,972 --> 00:04:30,749
You can't go anywhere
without your brother.

14
00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:32,549
And I very almost got my head blown off,

15
00:04:32,684 --> 00:04:35,444
because he's a fucking baby
who can't look after himself.

16
00:04:35,645 --> 00:04:38,197
Fuck you! Sit still!

17
00:04:38,398 --> 00:04:39,499
God damn it!

18
00:04:40,692 --> 00:04:43,703
So then, now, look what happens to him.

19
00:04:43,904 --> 00:04:46,414
Can't be feeling responsible for that.

20
00:04:46,615 --> 00:04:48,583
If he was a man
who could look after himself,

21
00:04:48,784 --> 00:04:50,251
he'd be accepting it right now.

22
00:04:50,452 --> 00:04:51,478
Fuck you. Say that again.

23
00:04:51,578 --> 00:04:52,962
You heard me. You know it.

24
00:04:53,163 --> 00:04:54,630
Fuck you, Archie! Say that again!

25
00:04:54,831 --> 00:04:56,811
If he was a man,
he wouldn't be crying about it,

26
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,940
he'd be accepting it.

27
00:04:58,084 --> 00:04:59,769
Say that one more goddamn time.

28
00:05:00,086 --> 00:05:00,970
I said it twice.

29
00:05:01,171 --> 00:05:02,638
One more goddamn time, Archie.

30
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,932
If I said it again,
I'd say it the exact same way,

31
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:06,674
and that'd be three times I said it!

32
00:05:44,381 --> 00:05:46,024
Fuck!

33
00:06:43,607 --> 00:06:46,742
Let's go. Come on, come on, come on.

34
00:06:46,943 --> 00:06:48,211
Come on!

35
00:08:34,175 --> 00:08:35,276
Who's this?

36
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,867
- That's our truck, man.
- What?

37
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,317
What the fuck's he doing?

38
00:09:07,417 --> 00:09:08,518
Jesus, fuck!

39
00:09:45,121 --> 00:09:46,556
Fuck!

40
00:09:57,967 --> 00:09:59,903
Fuck!

41
00:10:03,264 --> 00:10:04,365
Fuck!

42
00:10:19,739 --> 00:10:23,176
- Is he giving up?
- He ain't giving up.

43
00:10:24,494 --> 00:10:26,754
What's he doing?

44
00:10:26,955 --> 00:10:29,140
What's he doing?

45
00:10:37,507 --> 00:10:39,776
He's gonna keep following us, man.

46
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,438
Okay, okay, okay.

47
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,493
Fuck you. Fuck you.

48
00:11:26,514 --> 00:11:29,158
He's moving.

49
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,370
What's going on with you, brother?

50
00:12:17,482 --> 00:12:20,376
I said what's going on, brother?

51
00:12:21,778 --> 00:12:24,329
I want my car back.

52
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:26,049
Yeah, I can see that.

53
00:12:27,283 --> 00:12:29,052
You ain't gettin' it back.

54
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,846
I want my car back.

55
00:12:32,538 --> 00:12:33,626
If you don't give it to me now,

56
00:12:33,706 --> 00:12:37,226
I'm gonna get back in that truck
and I'm gonna stay on you till you do.

57
00:12:39,545 --> 00:12:43,107
What makes you think
I won't kill you right here?

58
00:12:44,968 --> 00:12:47,936
Nothing makes me think that.

59
00:12:48,137 --> 00:12:49,864
Come on, just for a little...

60
00:14:01,336 --> 00:14:03,479
<i>Area one, all clear. Over.</i>

61
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:30,144
Do you need anything?

62
00:17:32,505 --> 00:17:36,433
I'm looking for my car.
It's got three people in it.

63
00:17:36,634 --> 00:17:39,061
It hasn't stopped here.

64
00:17:39,262 --> 00:17:41,072
They needed petrol.

65
00:17:41,597 --> 00:17:44,483
I haven't got any petrol.

66
00:17:44,684 --> 00:17:46,818
Did you see it?

67
00:17:47,019 --> 00:17:50,697
I haven't seen a car with three people
in it. Do you want to buy something?

68
00:17:50,898 --> 00:17:54,543
I've got tins of stuff and
some auto accessories and other things.

69
00:18:54,337 --> 00:18:58,390
I'm looking for a car
with three people in it.

70
00:18:58,591 --> 00:18:59,975
Have you seen it?

71
00:19:00,176 --> 00:19:02,686
No.

72
00:19:02,887 --> 00:19:04,229
Anyone else seen it?

73
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,115
I don't know.

74
00:19:06,432 --> 00:19:08,150
Who would know?

75
00:19:08,351 --> 00:19:09,818
Maybe Grandma.

76
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:12,037
Where's Grandma?

77
00:19:12,521 --> 00:19:14,915
Down there.

78
00:19:39,382 --> 00:19:42,684
I'm looking for my car.
It's got three men in it.

79
00:19:42,885 --> 00:19:45,654
Did it come through here?

80
00:19:47,264 --> 00:19:49,191
What's your name?

81
00:19:49,392 --> 00:19:52,110
Have you seen it?

82
00:19:52,311 --> 00:19:53,496
What's your name?

83
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:58,533
Have you seen it?

84
00:19:58,734 --> 00:20:00,795
Do you want something?

85
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,832
Do you want to sleep with a boy?

86
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:07,760
I've got a boy here you can sleep with.

87
00:20:10,162 --> 00:20:13,974
He's smooth like the inside of your arm.

88
00:20:40,943 --> 00:20:43,712
Stop fucking whispering.

89
00:20:51,078 --> 00:20:52,555
I need to buy a gun.

90
00:20:55,624 --> 00:20:57,926
Stop fucking whispering.
I'll fucking kill ya.

91
00:20:58,127 --> 00:21:01,480
- You understand?
- I need a gun.

92
00:21:04,216 --> 00:21:05,308
Fuck!

93
00:21:05,509 --> 00:21:08,529
Fuck this shit!

94
00:21:25,488 --> 00:21:27,673
Fucking son of a bitch.

95
00:21:30,951 --> 00:21:33,012
Shut up!

96
00:21:39,835 --> 00:21:42,104
God, no.

97
00:21:47,468 --> 00:21:48,903
No...

98
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,070
Have you got guns?

99
00:21:59,271 --> 00:22:01,540
What does it look like I'm doing up here?

100
00:22:02,733 --> 00:22:05,169
I heard you. I heard what you need.

101
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:10,007
Fucking psycho.

102
00:22:13,077 --> 00:22:15,054
Careful.

103
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:20,717
They're 300 each. That one's 300.
That one's 300.

104
00:22:20,918 --> 00:22:24,596
And that one's 300. I only take US dollars.

105
00:22:24,797 --> 00:22:26,514
I don't have 300.

106
00:22:26,715 --> 00:22:29,142
They're $300 US.

107
00:22:29,343 --> 00:22:31,070
Can you do this one for less?

108
00:22:31,512 --> 00:22:33,521
I told you how much they cost.

109
00:22:33,722 --> 00:22:34,898
I don't have $300 US.

110
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:37,159
They're 300.
You don't have 300, you can fuck off.

111
00:23:25,149 --> 00:23:28,711
I'm looking for my car. Have you seen it?

112
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:31,579
Tell me your name.
I want to know your name.

113
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,707
- Answer my question.
- Answer mine.

114
00:23:33,908 --> 00:23:38,211
Answer my question.
I'm not gonna say it again.

115
00:23:38,412 --> 00:23:39,805
Okay.

116
00:23:41,081 --> 00:23:43,925
I'll call you "my baby".

117
00:23:44,126 --> 00:23:45,853
My baby.

118
00:23:47,129 --> 00:23:48,522
There was a car

119
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:55,270
and it had three men in it
and it did what most cars do.

120
00:23:55,471 --> 00:23:57,740
It came in one direction
and left in the other.

121
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:02,745
That's all I can tell you about it.

122
00:24:02,978 --> 00:24:08,717
The only detail I can tell you
is the detail that pertains to this place.

123
00:24:09,318 --> 00:24:11,870
I can tell you what they drank.

124
00:24:12,071 --> 00:24:14,214
I can tell you what they smelled like.

125
00:24:14,907 --> 00:24:18,886
I can tell you what they said,
if they said anything

126
00:24:19,703 --> 00:24:22,797
and if I heard what it was that they said.

127
00:24:22,998 --> 00:24:25,059
What did they say?

128
00:24:26,335 --> 00:24:29,646
They didn't say anything.
They didn't stop here.

129
00:24:33,884 --> 00:24:37,437
You must really love that car, darling.

130
00:24:37,638 --> 00:24:42,242
What a thing to get worked up about
in this day and age.

131
00:24:46,522 --> 00:24:50,667
What is it about the car
that you love so much?

132
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:55,339
Can you tell me?

133
00:24:58,575 --> 00:25:00,803
What's your name, sweetheart?

134
00:25:09,545 --> 00:25:11,105
Don't be silly.

135
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:15,400
Now you're just being rude.

136
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,775
What are you doing with this car?

137
00:25:58,052 --> 00:25:59,894
It's my brother's car.

138
00:26:00,095 --> 00:26:01,989
Who's your brother?

139
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,909
Where is he?

140
00:26:06,643 --> 00:26:08,453
Where's Henry at?

141
00:26:09,438 --> 00:26:11,874
Who's your brother? Where is he?

142
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:18,496
You tell me where he is,
or I'm gonna kill you.

143
00:26:18,697 --> 00:26:20,799
Where is he?

144
00:26:28,123 --> 00:26:29,757
There's no doctor here.

145
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:32,385
I'm about
the most useful person in this town.

146
00:26:32,586 --> 00:26:36,306
If that gives you any idea
how far from having a doctor this town is.

147
00:26:36,507 --> 00:26:38,600
Is there a doctor somewhere else?

148
00:26:38,801 --> 00:26:40,485
Buy something.

149
00:26:40,803 --> 00:26:45,407
I told you what I've got. I've got
tins of things and drinks and stuff.

150
00:26:45,641 --> 00:26:47,692
I have to deal with this shit all day.

151
00:26:47,893 --> 00:26:48,943
Please.

152
00:26:49,144 --> 00:26:50,653
I'm not joking.

153
00:26:50,854 --> 00:26:53,740
You can say "please" all you like,
but I'm not joking.

154
00:26:53,941 --> 00:26:57,544
Now, pick yourself something off the shelf.

155
00:27:02,908 --> 00:27:05,052
Pay Benny.

156
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:23,937
There's a doctor in them hills there.
Head east,

157
00:27:24,138 --> 00:27:27,774
and follow the road that looks like
it leads to those hills, you'll get there.

158
00:27:27,975 --> 00:27:31,411
It's got a big yellow fridge out the front,
says "Peeples" written on it.

159
00:28:58,607 --> 00:29:01,034
Pull the gun out of your pants.

160
00:29:01,235 --> 00:29:02,994
I've got a kid in the car who needs help.

161
00:29:03,195 --> 00:29:06,757
Pull the gun out of your pants
and put it on the ground.

162
00:29:15,999 --> 00:29:18,602
He needs help.

163
00:29:52,911 --> 00:29:55,222
Is this man your friend?

164
00:30:04,506 --> 00:30:06,307
How much do you want for doing this?

165
00:30:06,508 --> 00:30:09,653
I don't want your money.

166
00:30:10,595 --> 00:30:15,784
I've gotten pretty good
living without money.

167
00:32:36,825 --> 00:32:39,961
I have to keep these guys
locked up in here now for the most part,

168
00:32:40,162 --> 00:32:44,057
'cause people take them for food.

169
00:32:54,009 --> 00:32:57,270
These guys came to me.

170
00:32:57,471 --> 00:32:58,646
People just drop them off

171
00:32:58,847 --> 00:33:02,400
and ask me to look after them
while they went away somewhere

172
00:33:02,601 --> 00:33:07,697
or because they had to go somewhere
or do something,

173
00:33:07,898 --> 00:33:11,710
and none of them ever came back.

174
00:33:15,489 --> 00:33:19,467
I guess they've gone looking for money.

175
00:33:34,633 --> 00:33:40,196
Do you want me to take a look at your cuts?

176
00:33:46,561 --> 00:33:49,289
No.

177
00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:34,959
Hey.

178
00:34:37,445 --> 00:34:39,130
How ya going?

179
00:34:41,241 --> 00:34:42,384
Well.

180
00:34:44,661 --> 00:34:49,641
Do you wanna take a chair
while I have a look at you?

181
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:07,909
It hurts.

182
00:35:08,977 --> 00:35:11,779
Do you want to take your hand away?

183
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:15,542
That doesn't look too bad.

184
00:35:16,818 --> 00:35:21,798
That looks good.
You just need to keep this clean.

185
00:35:33,376 --> 00:35:37,105
Tell me where your brother is.

186
00:35:40,216 --> 00:35:41,776
I'll take you to him.

187
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,281
Tell me where your brother is.

188
00:35:51,019 --> 00:35:54,622
He's gone south a long way from here.
I'll take you to him, I promise.

189
00:35:56,232 --> 00:35:59,961
I'm just gonna get you a T-shirt.

190
00:36:03,531 --> 00:36:04,966
Get up. We're leaving.

191
00:36:07,535 --> 00:36:11,514
Maybe we should ask what the lady says.

192
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,101
Get up.

193
00:36:26,638 --> 00:36:29,532
- What was that sound?
- It's a car coming.

194
00:36:30,058 --> 00:36:31,066
What car?

195
00:36:31,267 --> 00:36:33,495
I don't know.

196
00:36:35,438 --> 00:36:37,531
That's two cars.

197
00:36:37,732 --> 00:36:42,203
- How long till they're here?
- A minute, maybe.

198
00:36:42,404 --> 00:36:43,412
Who is it?

199
00:36:43,613 --> 00:36:45,831
Get your rifle.

200
00:36:46,032 --> 00:36:48,176
- Do you know them?
- Go and get your rifle.

201
00:37:16,354 --> 00:37:18,206
Tell me what's going on.

202
00:37:30,827 --> 00:37:32,554
Who are these people?

203
00:38:00,023 --> 00:38:01,332
Get up. We're leaving.

204
00:38:26,508 --> 00:38:27,901
Get up.

205
00:39:37,203 --> 00:39:40,348
Where are we?

206
00:39:56,556 --> 00:39:58,825
I'm hungry.

207
00:40:51,486 --> 00:40:53,796
Go and get some food?

208
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:01,137
You're gonna start talking to me.

209
00:41:02,789 --> 00:41:03,714
What?

210
00:41:03,915 --> 00:41:07,685
Don't fucking "what" me.
Where are we going?

211
00:41:10,129 --> 00:41:12,349
I can't tell you nothing more
than I already told you.

212
00:41:12,507 --> 00:41:14,429
I don't give a shit
what you think you've already told me.

213
00:41:14,509 --> 00:41:16,018
Start fucking talking to me!

214
00:41:16,219 --> 00:41:18,103
Don't.

215
00:41:18,304 --> 00:41:20,230
Do you even know where we are?

216
00:41:20,431 --> 00:41:22,983
- What?
- Where are we?

217
00:41:23,184 --> 00:41:24,276
Where are we?

218
00:41:24,477 --> 00:41:25,652
I don't know.

219
00:41:25,853 --> 00:41:27,362
You don't fucking know?

220
00:41:27,563 --> 00:41:29,110
So, how are you gonna
get to where you're going

221
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:32,293
if you don't know where the fuck you are?

222
00:41:43,287 --> 00:41:47,475
Do you even understand
what I just said, half-wit?

223
00:41:52,296 --> 00:41:55,900
We're going to Carloon.

224
00:41:58,386 --> 00:42:01,322
We're going to Carloon.

225
00:43:26,974 --> 00:43:29,818
I just asked that lady
how to get to Carloon from here.

226
00:43:30,019 --> 00:43:34,948
I was gonna do that anyway
and you would've heard me

227
00:43:35,149 --> 00:43:40,329
and you would've asked her what I said,
figured out what I said anyway.

228
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:43,324
And I was gonna tell you anyway.

229
00:43:45,493 --> 00:43:48,679
You wanna know so bad.

230
00:43:50,832 --> 00:43:53,675
But you don't know exactly
where in Carloon we're going exactly,

231
00:43:53,876 --> 00:43:57,438
so, I'm still in control here.

232
00:44:01,968 --> 00:44:03,681
You don't know exactly
where in Carloon we're going,

233
00:44:03,761 --> 00:44:05,613
so you got to take me with you.

234
00:44:10,184 --> 00:44:12,211
I'm taking you with me
because if I get to Carloon

235
00:44:12,311 --> 00:44:14,789
and your brother's not there,
I'm gonna slit your throat.

236
00:44:24,323 --> 00:44:28,552
What you want with my brother so bad?

237
00:44:30,872 --> 00:44:33,557
Who are you?

238
00:44:36,502 --> 00:44:40,514
I'm Rey. Is that what you mean?

239
00:44:40,715 --> 00:44:43,276
Why are you here?

240
00:44:48,556 --> 00:44:52,734
Me and my brother came out for the mines.
Like everybody else.

241
00:44:52,935 --> 00:44:56,372
Why's your brother in Carloon?

242
00:44:57,523 --> 00:44:59,866
That's where he was gonna go.

243
00:45:00,067 --> 00:45:03,671
Why are you here
and your brother's in Carloon?

244
00:45:07,742 --> 00:45:10,928
They had to get going in a big hurry.

245
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:14,890
Why?

246
00:45:16,751 --> 00:45:20,813
Why did he have to get going in a big hurry?

247
00:45:24,091 --> 00:45:27,361
I don't know. I can't talk about it.

248
00:45:28,429 --> 00:45:32,825
Why did your brother have to get to Carloon
in a big hurry?

249
00:45:36,938 --> 00:45:38,581
I can't talk about it.

250
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:40,950
Well, whatever it was he did,

251
00:45:41,108 --> 00:45:44,295
you got left here to die
while he was doing it.

252
00:45:46,197 --> 00:45:49,633
- It didn't happen like that.
- Really?

253
00:45:50,076 --> 00:45:52,887
How did it happen then?

254
00:45:56,582 --> 00:46:00,811
I can't talk about it no more,
just stop asking about everything.

255
00:46:05,132 --> 00:46:07,221
'Cause I believe in God
and I know Henry believes in God,

256
00:46:07,301 --> 00:46:09,811
and there's no harm
Henry would want to see me come to.

257
00:46:10,012 --> 00:46:12,031
I believe in that.

258
00:46:13,099 --> 00:46:17,036
Yet look at the harm you've come to
and where's Henry?

259
00:46:21,732 --> 00:46:23,417
He's waiting for me.

260
00:46:23,901 --> 00:46:26,253
He's not waiting for you.

261
00:46:28,781 --> 00:46:31,124
Yes, he is.

262
00:46:31,325 --> 00:46:33,052
No, he's not.

263
00:46:33,995 --> 00:46:36,889
I'll tell you what God's given you.

264
00:46:38,499 --> 00:46:40,684
He's put a bullet in you.

265
00:46:41,711 --> 00:46:45,773
And he's abandoned you out here to me,
who feels nothing for you.

266
00:46:47,508 --> 00:46:51,978
I couldn't give a fuck if you die tomorrow.

267
00:46:52,179 --> 00:46:54,940
God gave you a brother
who's not waiting for you.

268
00:46:55,141 --> 00:46:59,328
He gave you a brother who's
not even thinking about you right now.

269
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:05,626
Just because you and him
came out of the same woman's hole.

270
00:47:10,406 --> 00:47:12,119
The only thing
that means anything right now

271
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:15,761
is that I'm here and he's not.

272
00:47:20,875 --> 00:47:23,927
Your brother left you to die.

273
00:47:24,128 --> 00:47:26,355
That's what people do.

274
00:47:28,632 --> 00:47:33,279
You don't learn to fight,
your death's gonna come real soon.

275
00:49:20,494 --> 00:49:25,849
<i>This is 5-1... Passage is called 2-11.
We should be clear or clearing shortly.</i>

276
00:52:14,918 --> 00:52:16,770
4-3-7 Echo.

277
00:52:17,171 --> 00:52:19,231
4-3-7 Echo. This is K-K. Do you copy?

278
00:52:26,555 --> 00:52:28,157
Stop shooting!

279
00:52:38,817 --> 00:52:40,794
I just wanted to fight.

280
00:52:42,112 --> 00:52:44,298
I just wanted to fight him.

281
00:52:46,367 --> 00:52:47,760
Let's go.

282
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:51,221
Come on.

283
00:55:55,597 --> 00:55:59,192
<i>That lady said it would take about
eight hours to get there, in the old days.</i>

284
00:55:59,393 --> 00:56:02,955
<i>But it might take longer now 'cause
a lot of them old roads ain't there no more.</i>

285
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:07,376
And all the roads are bad now anyways
so you can't drive fast on 'em.

286
00:56:14,283 --> 00:56:16,918
She said about eight or nine hours.

287
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:19,379
She wasn't sure if it was eight or nine.

288
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:22,182
She seemed a bit confused about it.

289
00:56:23,125 --> 00:56:24,505
And why would he still be there?

290
00:56:28,463 --> 00:56:31,191
He had to wait two weeks for someone.

291
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:35,862
There's a man there he's got to meet,
it's gonna take two weeks.

292
00:56:37,014 --> 00:56:38,949
You know this? Or this is what he told you?

293
00:56:44,146 --> 00:56:45,422
Your brother can't be trusted.

294
00:56:45,522 --> 00:56:49,710
Is this something that you know
or is this something that he told you?

295
00:56:56,617 --> 00:56:58,385
Both those things.

296
00:57:11,089 --> 00:57:13,066
You work in the mines?

297
00:57:14,635 --> 00:57:15,736
No.

298
00:57:18,388 --> 00:57:20,240
What do you do then?

299
00:57:24,144 --> 00:57:26,663
I was a farmer. And now I'm here.

300
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:33,866
Then how come you learned
how to shoot so good?

301
00:57:33,946 --> 00:57:35,422
You was in the army?

302
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:51,772
When I was a little kid I grew up on a farm.

303
00:57:52,005 --> 00:57:56,267
We had these neighbors,
real old man and lady, Verna and Clarry,

304
00:57:56,468 --> 00:57:57,944
they's brother and sister.

305
00:57:59,137 --> 00:58:01,564
And they lived on this land
that's all overgrown,

306
00:58:01,765 --> 00:58:05,452
like you couldn't even tell
what they farmed, so overgrown.

307
00:58:07,187 --> 00:58:10,323
And Clarry had these eight tractors,
and none of them worked properly,

308
00:58:10,524 --> 00:58:14,869
so every morning he'd roll each one down
the hill till he got one of them started

309
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:18,465
and then use that one
to tow all the others back up.

310
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:21,927
He did that every day.

311
00:58:23,704 --> 00:58:26,106
And when they died,
their family, who we'd never met before,

312
00:58:26,206 --> 00:58:28,850
came around, cleared out their house

313
00:58:30,168 --> 00:58:32,312
and they found all this...

314
00:58:32,713 --> 00:58:35,649
They found all this weird stuff in there.

315
00:58:37,259 --> 00:58:38,568
Like...

316
00:58:40,512 --> 00:58:42,197
Like 50 therm...

317
00:58:46,059 --> 00:58:48,120
Thermionic radio valves.

318
00:58:49,229 --> 00:58:52,499
Like them real old valves
they used in old radios.

319
00:58:53,984 --> 00:58:56,336
And pyramid of pumpkins.

320
00:58:57,612 --> 00:59:01,633
And about 5,000 of these little sticks
about this long.

321
00:59:01,992 --> 00:59:07,848
And each wrapped up in newspaper
and tied up at the ends with baling twine.

322
00:59:15,047 --> 00:59:17,274
Why are you telling me this?

323
00:59:20,343 --> 00:59:22,237
I just remembered it.

324
00:59:23,096 --> 00:59:25,031
It interested me.

325
00:59:29,102 --> 00:59:32,038
Not everything has to be about something.

326
00:59:55,128 --> 00:59:59,649
I'm tryin' to stop thinking about that
little girl who died, but I can't.

327
01:00:03,512 --> 01:00:05,113
You shouldn't.

328
01:00:08,475 --> 01:00:09,993
But I can't.

329
01:00:11,478 --> 01:00:14,247
You shouldn't stop thinking about her.

330
01:00:17,317 --> 01:00:21,203
You should never stop thinking
about a life you've taken.

331
01:00:21,404 --> 01:00:24,090
It's the price you pay for taking it.

332
01:02:16,311 --> 01:02:17,903
That's it, sweetheart.

333
01:02:18,104 --> 01:02:20,206
Let's start with the eyelids.

334
01:02:21,566 --> 01:02:24,869
I want you to roll over onto your front,
put your hands behind your back.

335
01:02:25,070 --> 01:02:26,713
And do it slow.

336
01:02:28,949 --> 01:02:30,550
And do it now.

337
01:04:03,209 --> 01:04:06,104
<i>When are you gonna say something, cunt?</i>

338
01:04:10,383 --> 01:04:11,860
<i>It's over.</i>

339
01:04:12,844 --> 01:04:14,612
It's over for you.

340
01:04:17,265 --> 01:04:18,783
I know that.

341
01:04:19,476 --> 01:04:21,870
That's good that you know that.

342
01:04:23,897 --> 01:04:25,373
Do you know it, too?

343
01:04:25,732 --> 01:04:27,283
I know it, champ.

344
01:04:27,484 --> 01:04:29,085
I told you it.

345
01:04:32,155 --> 01:04:34,757
Do you know it's over for you, too?

346
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:40,546
Whatever you think's over for me
was over a long time ago.

347
01:04:40,747 --> 01:04:42,640
I'm asking about you.

348
01:04:44,292 --> 01:04:46,311
Are you threatening me?

349
01:04:46,795 --> 01:04:47,937
No.

350
01:04:49,589 --> 01:04:53,151
A threat means
there's still something left to happen.

351
01:05:03,937 --> 01:05:06,456
What are you gonna do with me?

352
01:05:13,321 --> 01:05:15,340
You're going to Sydney.

353
01:05:18,201 --> 01:05:20,428
Why don't you just shoot me?

354
01:05:27,627 --> 01:05:29,521
Why don't you do it?

355
01:05:30,296 --> 01:05:32,899
That's what everyone else is doing.

356
01:05:35,343 --> 01:05:36,473
Because me sending you to Sydney

357
01:05:36,553 --> 01:05:40,657
tells Sydney there's a reason
to keep paying us what they pay us.

358
01:05:41,933 --> 01:05:44,109
If we just shot every idiot
we wanted to shoot,

359
01:05:44,310 --> 01:05:48,957
then pretty soon they'd start to wonder
what the fuck we're doing out here.

360
01:05:52,444 --> 01:05:55,079
See, personally I don't care about you.

361
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:58,119
I don't care if you get to Sydney and
they let you off or you bribe your way out

362
01:05:58,199 --> 01:06:00,199
or whatever the fuck they do down there
these days.

363
01:06:00,285 --> 01:06:02,136
I don't give a fuck.

364
01:06:03,163 --> 01:06:05,139
I'm doing this for me.

365
01:06:06,082 --> 01:06:08,226
You're doing what for you?

366
01:06:12,172 --> 01:06:14,315
You're doing what for you?

367
01:06:20,638 --> 01:06:22,448
I murdered my wife.

368
01:06:24,309 --> 01:06:25,689
I followed her to a man's house,

369
01:06:25,852 --> 01:06:29,446
I watched him put his fingers inside her
and I killed 'em both.

370
01:06:29,647 --> 01:06:31,791
No one ever came after me.

371
01:06:32,525 --> 01:06:34,127
Ten years ago.

372
01:06:36,905 --> 01:06:39,257
I never had to explain myself.

373
01:06:41,534 --> 01:06:44,837
I never had to lie to anyone.
I never had to run and hide.

374
01:06:45,038 --> 01:06:48,141
I just buried 'em in a hole and I went home.

375
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:50,893
No one ever came after me.

376
01:06:52,086 --> 01:06:55,481
And that hurt me
more than getting my heart broken.

377
01:06:58,343 --> 01:07:00,445
Knowing it didn't matter.

378
01:07:04,224 --> 01:07:08,369
Knowing you can do something like that
and no one comes after you.

379
01:07:11,898 --> 01:07:15,835
You do a thing like what I did,
that should really mean something.

380
01:07:18,571 --> 01:07:21,174
But it just doesn't matter anymore.

381
01:07:26,246 --> 01:07:27,722
Well, champ.

382
01:07:30,708 --> 01:07:34,854
Thing you did in Abo town is the one thing
that does matter to us.

383
01:07:37,924 --> 01:07:41,527
Now you can do
all the lying and confessing you'd like.

384
01:07:42,804 --> 01:07:46,491
What feeling do you have
when you wake up in the morning?

385
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:50,036
When your feet touch the floor?

386
01:07:51,646 --> 01:07:56,751
Or before that, when you're lying there
thinking about your feet hitting the floor.

387
01:07:57,485 --> 01:08:00,004
What does that feel like for you?

388
01:08:04,450 --> 01:08:05,951
Do you know what I'm talking about?

389
01:08:06,202 --> 01:08:07,970
No, mate. I don't.

390
01:08:08,538 --> 01:08:09,421
You don't?

391
01:08:09,622 --> 01:08:13,351
No, mate. I don't know
what the fuck you're talking about.

392
01:08:15,878 --> 01:08:17,105
What the fuck?

393
01:08:25,722 --> 01:08:27,198
Is that it?

394
01:08:29,684 --> 01:08:30,910
That was easy.

395
01:08:31,686 --> 01:08:34,122
Do I shoot him again just to be sure?

396
01:08:35,189 --> 01:08:36,290
No.

397
01:08:37,734 --> 01:08:40,753
That was easy.
There were only three of 'em.

398
01:08:41,154 --> 01:08:43,756
Thought it was gonna be way more harder.

399
01:08:45,533 --> 01:08:47,093
You tied up?

400
01:09:04,969 --> 01:09:06,812
I snuck up on these two.

401
01:09:07,013 --> 01:09:09,323
They were just hanging there.

402
01:09:13,936 --> 01:09:15,872
I came through the gate here.

403
01:09:26,949 --> 01:09:30,052
I dug a hole out.
Slipped underneath the fence.

404
01:09:37,418 --> 01:09:39,520
Get the truck over there.

405
01:09:44,592 --> 01:09:46,152
Come on, man.

406
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:34,867
You want me to drive for a while?

407
01:10:35,935 --> 01:10:37,203
No.

408
01:10:53,327 --> 01:10:58,516
I know I feel comfortable with someone
when I can just sit, not talking to them.

409
01:11:04,839 --> 01:11:08,568
I just like sitting there, not talking.

410
01:11:09,969 --> 01:11:12,989
I just feel comfortable sittin' there,
you know.

411
01:11:22,607 --> 01:11:25,001
I had a pain in my side real bad.

412
01:11:27,653 --> 01:11:29,589
It's starting to hurt.

413
01:11:31,491 --> 01:11:34,468
I think maybe I gotta do something with it.

414
01:12:23,084 --> 01:12:24,769
Don't look bad?

415
01:12:28,756 --> 01:12:31,150
Let's put that bandage back on.

416
01:12:35,346 --> 01:12:37,156
I think it broke, man.

417
01:13:34,155 --> 01:13:35,539
You got any fuel?

418
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:37,008
50 US.

419
01:13:37,283 --> 01:13:38,551
50 Australian.

420
01:13:38,826 --> 01:13:40,168
US dollars.

421
01:13:40,369 --> 01:13:41,753
I'm out of US.

422
01:13:41,954 --> 01:13:43,723
I only take American money.

423
01:13:45,041 --> 01:13:46,633
What's wrong with Australian money?

424
01:13:46,834 --> 01:13:48,427
Either take it or leave it.

425
01:13:48,628 --> 01:13:50,855
It's paper. It's worthless.

426
01:13:51,756 --> 01:13:53,682
Yeah, whatever, mate, I don't care.

427
01:13:53,883 --> 01:13:56,235
It's a piece of fucking paper!

428
01:13:56,594 --> 01:13:58,311
Take it or leave it.

429
01:13:58,512 --> 01:13:59,905
How much you need, man?

430
01:14:00,806 --> 01:14:02,283
50 US.

431
01:14:06,896 --> 01:14:08,280
Have you got any .38 in there?

432
01:14:08,481 --> 01:14:09,364
Yeah.

433
01:14:09,565 --> 01:14:11,667
Let me get a box of that.

434
01:14:12,985 --> 01:14:16,130
And a box of .9 millimeter
for my friend here.

435
01:14:24,330 --> 01:14:26,098
Thank you kindly.

436
01:15:27,351 --> 01:15:29,120
There's the house.

437
01:15:30,271 --> 01:15:32,489
All them others empty.

438
01:15:32,690 --> 01:15:35,417
They ain't got people in them anymore.

439
01:15:37,778 --> 01:15:39,839
Are they alone in there?

440
01:15:42,533 --> 01:15:43,750
For now they are.

441
01:15:43,951 --> 01:15:49,098
Until them other people come, but that ain't
gonna be for another week or somethin'.

442
01:15:49,457 --> 01:15:53,009
And there's Gordon, whose house it is,
but he's old.

443
01:15:53,210 --> 01:15:54,562
Real old.

444
01:15:55,713 --> 01:15:57,606
Do you know this?

445
01:16:00,551 --> 01:16:01,986
I know it.

446
01:16:08,392 --> 01:16:11,069
We'll go there in the morning.

447
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:13,372
There'll be less trouble.

448
01:18:35,039 --> 01:18:36,807
I'm gonna kill him.

449
01:18:44,006 --> 01:18:46,150
I'm going to kill Henry.

450
01:18:50,888 --> 01:18:52,364
Go to sleep.

451
01:18:55,976 --> 01:18:59,455
There's money up there too,
we can take if we want.

452
01:19:07,821 --> 01:19:09,340
Go to sleep.

453
01:22:17,761 --> 01:22:19,530
What you doing?

454
01:22:27,104 --> 01:22:28,872
What you doing?

455
01:23:06,059 --> 01:23:07,786
Just wait there.

456
01:24:04,993 --> 01:24:06,637
They're asleep.

457
01:24:14,044 --> 01:24:17,147
There's two in the back room.
I'll take them.

458
01:24:18,590 --> 01:24:21,485
There's two in the room on the other side.

459
01:24:23,428 --> 01:24:26,898
If you take them,
we'll bring them into this front room.

460
01:24:27,099 --> 01:24:29,076
Okay? But no shooting.

461
01:24:29,518 --> 01:24:30,952
All right?

462
01:25:57,439 --> 01:25:59,166
Don't say a word.

463
01:25:59,775 --> 01:26:02,461
Slowly lift your head off the pillow.

464
01:26:06,073 --> 01:26:07,466
What the fuck?

465
01:26:11,703 --> 01:26:13,638
Kick your blanket off.

466
01:26:27,094 --> 01:26:28,904
Both of you get up.

467
01:27:03,630 --> 01:27:04,898
Henry.

468
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,068
Henry.

469
01:27:12,305 --> 01:27:13,949
Henry, wake up.

470
01:27:18,770 --> 01:27:19,913
Rey?

471
01:27:22,941 --> 01:27:24,292
You gotta get up.

472
01:27:25,485 --> 01:27:27,337
Rey, what the fuck?

473
01:27:28,697 --> 01:27:30,131
You too, Gordon.

474
01:27:30,449 --> 01:27:33,760
You gotta get up.
You both gotta get up outta bed.

475
01:27:34,953 --> 01:27:37,514
What are you doing?
Stop pointing that thing at me.

476
01:27:37,956 --> 01:27:40,934
Don't make me keep saying it.
You got to get up out of bed.

477
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:46,648
Sit down. Sit.

478
01:27:52,053 --> 01:27:53,822
Sit on your hands.

479
01:27:58,810 --> 01:27:59,995
What's going on in there?

480
01:28:01,688 --> 01:28:03,164
See, Henry?

481
01:28:03,607 --> 01:28:05,449
You gotta get up outta bed.

482
01:28:05,650 --> 01:28:07,544
Rey, who's in there?

483
01:28:08,987 --> 01:28:11,131
He won't get up outta bed.

484
01:28:12,699 --> 01:28:14,217
Put the gun down, Rey.

485
01:28:16,745 --> 01:28:17,670
You put yours down.

486
01:28:17,871 --> 01:28:20,682
Rey, put the gun down. I ain't playing.

487
01:28:21,666 --> 01:28:23,685
Why are you doing this?

488
01:28:29,841 --> 01:28:31,601
Why did you leave me there?

489
01:28:31,802 --> 01:28:33,486
Leave you where?

490
01:28:36,306 --> 01:28:39,066
You know where.
On the road, when I was shot.

491
01:28:39,267 --> 01:28:41,527
Rey, we thought you was dead.

492
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:42,871
No.

493
01:28:43,396 --> 01:28:45,865
But I wasn't.
But I wasn't dead and you left me there.

494
01:28:46,066 --> 01:28:49,753
Rey, I thought you was dead.
Now put down the fuckin' gun!

495
01:28:50,737 --> 01:28:52,589
You put yours down.

496
01:28:53,406 --> 01:28:55,133
What's going on?

497
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:58,336
I gotta piss.

498
01:28:58,537 --> 01:29:00,472
Don't you fuckin' move.

499
01:29:04,042 --> 01:29:06,344
I thought you was my brother, man.

500
01:29:06,545 --> 01:29:10,398
God damn it, Rey! I am your brother.
Now put down the fuckin' gun.

501
01:29:12,217 --> 01:29:13,726
I thought you was my brother.

502
01:29:13,927 --> 01:29:17,063
Rey, if you don't put down the gun
I'm gonna shoot you.

503
01:29:17,264 --> 01:29:18,907
All right? I ain't lyin'.

504
01:29:19,683 --> 01:29:22,443
You was supposed to be my brother, Henry.
You told Pa.

505
01:29:22,644 --> 01:29:24,537
Rey, put down the goddamn gun!

506
01:29:26,982 --> 01:29:29,029
I thought you was my brother
and you just left me there.

507
01:29:29,109 --> 01:29:30,377
What's going on in there?

508
01:30:49,189 --> 01:30:51,541
What did you do to my brother?

509
01:31:03,161 --> 01:31:04,596
Answer me.

510
01:31:05,246 --> 01:31:07,599
What did you do to my brother?

511
01:31:10,502 --> 01:31:12,395
I didn't do anything.

512
01:31:14,172 --> 01:31:15,774
Yes, you did.

513
01:31:20,136 --> 01:31:22,113
What did you do to him?
