1
00:00:46,692 --> 00:00:49,889
The beautiful North woods.
Rest and relaxation.

2
00:00:50,162 --> 00:00:54,462
Solid, but solid! Those trees. Those birds.

3
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:58,196
Those peace and quiet.
What a vacation spot!

4
00:01:05,544 --> 00:01:09,139
Flatbush was never like this.
Nothing to do but sleep.

5
00:01:09,314 --> 00:01:11,578
I'm going to pound my ear for a week.

6
00:01:12,117 --> 00:01:14,608
It sends me right down to
my bobby socks.

7
00:01:23,528 --> 00:01:26,861
Woodpeckers. What a cheerful sound!

8
00:01:29,501 --> 00:01:32,561
That ain't no woodpecker.
What gives here?

9
00:01:38,744 --> 00:01:41,542
A lumber jackson. One of the local yokels.

10
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,541
I'll fix that icky!

11
00:02:06,672 --> 00:02:09,368
You don't have to
fly off the handle like that.

12
00:02:11,143 --> 00:02:15,580
This is going to be a tough job.
Calls for a whole flock of axes.

13
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:22,013
Flock of axes? This calls for real strategy.

14
00:02:40,872 --> 00:02:42,305
This oughta do it!

15
00:02:45,644 --> 00:02:47,009
Doggone it!

16
00:02:54,453 --> 00:02:55,818
Hold it, stupid!

17
00:02:59,024 --> 00:03:01,185
So you're the one behind all this.

18
00:03:01,326 --> 00:03:05,023
Read, fat boy!
You vex me, you understand?

19
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,261
Cease that chop-chop, chubby!

20
00:03:07,332 --> 00:03:11,098
Blow, Joe. Hit the road.
I'm going to get me a little shuteye.

21
00:03:11,703 --> 00:03:14,399
And so are you. Now scram, ham!

22
00:03:15,841 --> 00:03:18,105
I guess I fixed that square for fair.

23
00:03:26,518 --> 00:03:28,509
"Paper Boy in the sixth."

24
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:33,253
Some guys don't never learn.

25
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,353
What a charming <i>chapeau.</i>
Toodle-oo, Myrtle.

26
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:11,126
Doggone squirrel!

27
00:04:30,782 --> 00:04:33,250
Wait right here, pork chop. Don't go away.

28
00:04:33,985 --> 00:04:35,953
Bon voyage, tubby.

29
00:04:43,461 --> 00:04:45,292
I thought you'd never get here.

30
00:04:46,865 --> 00:04:48,526
Which way did they go?

31
00:04:49,768 --> 00:04:53,226
They went that-a-way, Sheriff.
You can head them off at the pass.

32
00:04:55,974 --> 00:04:57,498
Wait a minute.

33
00:04:59,744 --> 00:05:01,769
That little doggone...

34
00:05:06,685 --> 00:05:10,348
And that is that. So, to bed.

35
00:05:26,204 --> 00:05:28,138
I'm not so stupid.

36
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,038
I see you, you little varmint!

37
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:49,784
You're just a bundle of nerves, butterball.
You need a vacation worse than I do.

38
00:05:57,602 --> 00:06:01,265
You rat in squirrel's clothing!
I'll fix you.

39
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:03,830
I'll kill two birds with one stone.

40
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:08,642
I'll blow up the tree
and get rid of that doggone squirrel, too.

41
00:06:46,117 --> 00:06:47,982
"Paper Boy in the sixth!"

42
00:06:54,793 --> 00:06:56,158
English
