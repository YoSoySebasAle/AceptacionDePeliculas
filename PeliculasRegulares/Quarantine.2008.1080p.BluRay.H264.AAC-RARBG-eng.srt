1
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:04,753
- Come on, life sounds. Let's go.
- Okay.

2
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:07,214
Mike down, mike down.
There you go, now go.

3
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:09,258
You'd think l'd never done this.
Ready?

4
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,844
Hey, wait a second. Ready.

5
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,887
Five, four, three....

6
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:15,806
Hi, l'm Angela Vidal.

7
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:19,143
Come with us tonight
as we travel along with--

8
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:22,312
- Sorry.
- Okay.

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,064
- Ready?
- Yeah, wait a second.

10
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:26,025
You got a little hair thing. Hold on.

11
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,193
Let me get that.

12
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,029
That right there.

13
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,990
- Okay, there we go.
- Thank you.

14
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:34,658
Okay.

15
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:38,912
Hold on.

16
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,791
Okay. Ready.

17
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,293
Hi, l'm Angela Vidal.

18
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:48,589
Come with us tonight as we paint
the town red on The Night Shift.

19
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:52,009
Sorry, a little off my A-game.
I'll get there.

20
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:55,512
That wasn't bad. The second part
just seemed a Iittle pushed, though.

21
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,682
On tonight's Night Shift,
we're in Los Angeles...

22
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,686
...traveling along with that special
breed of hero we like to call...

23
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,065
...the fire department.

24
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:25,375
We shouId have come earlier.
We could be going with them.

25
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,713
Well, that's cool. You got it?

26
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:33,383
- Yeah, that's great. That was perfect.
- We'Il wait for them to get back.

27
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,552
- You prefer Bob or Robert--?
- Bob's good.

28
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,596
- Bob, okay, sorry. Ready? Okay.
- Yeah.

29
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,182
Three, two, one.

30
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,602
Tell us, Bob, what's a normaI night
here at the station?

31
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,521
This might surprise most people...

32
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:48,398
...but 85 percent of the calls
we go out on are medical.

33
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:51,527
It can be anything from chest pain
to more serious things.

34
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:54,488
How do you handIe that
with ambulances and hospitals?

35
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,074
Most ambulances you see
are fire department.

36
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,076
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

37
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,829
And most firefighters
are also paramedics.

38
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:04,456
At least,
that's the direction it's going.

39
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,543
One more question, something
I'm sure we're aIl wondering:

40
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,421
Do firefighters still sIide down
those fabulous poles?

41
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,340
We sure do.

42
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,800
No turning back.

43
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,511
Tell my mom l loved her.

44
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,849
- See?
- That's not so bad.

45
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:25,144
I'm gIad I didn't wear a skirt.
That couId really hurt your legs.

46
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:28,814
Tell me, Bob, how do you get down
when you're wearing a skirt?

47
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,066
Pantyhose help.

48
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,734
Pantyhose.

49
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:35,571
That's what they wear under their,
what, their turnouts.

50
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:36,822
- ExactIy.
- Pantyhose.

51
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,450
- Fire-retardant pantyhose.
- You heard it here.

52
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,244
- Can l do it one more time?
- Sure.

53
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,996
I'll be right back, okay?

54
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:46,331
- We're going to the dining hall.
- All right.

55
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,668
- Couple of guys l want you to meet.
- Cool.

56
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,802
Hey.

57
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,472
- This is Jake.
- Hey.

58
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,724
- And Fletcher.
- Hi.

59
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:04,975
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

60
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:08,228
These are the men you'll be
shadowing. Wherever they go, you go.

61
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:11,398
Cool. Please, oh, please, finish eating.
We'll talk after.

62
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,192
- Well, would you like some?
- Yeah.

63
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,693
- Did you make it?
- We got--

64
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,278
I didn't make it.

65
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,905
Firemen are really good cooks.

66
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,740
- Yeah, that's what l hear.
- ExactIy.

67
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,326
- You should try some of the food.
- Yeah, I'm game.

68
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:24,912
- Please finish eating.
- We'Il get you a plate.

69
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,206
Great. Sounds great.

70
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,459
Just maybe un-tuck your shirt
and stick it up here.

71
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,045
- Okay. Okay.
- Clip it on your collar.

72
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,216
- You filming this?
- Yeah.

73
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:40,177
Elliot's been telIing me
I never give him enough B-roll...

74
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,137
...so l'm just gonna shoot it alI.

75
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,765
- Jake? Jake?
- Yeah, yeah.

76
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,559
If you could keep
from rubbing into the mike too much--

77
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,811
- Sorry, yeah.
- Don't worry about the camera.

78
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,647
- Pretend it's not even there.
- Okay.

79
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,941
Can you say something?
Give me a Ievel?

80
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:55,984
Yeah. Mike check, one--

81
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:58,654
You can just pretend it's not there.
Just taIk free.

82
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:01,240
Can you say something
more compelling?

83
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,034
I don't know what to say--

84
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,787
I mean, am l gonna have
this thing on all the time?

85
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:10,040
Yeah, just watch what you say.
We'll hear everything.

86
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,667
Shit.

87
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:14,628
You're probably not allowed
to swear on your station.

88
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,588
No. We can cut most of it out.

89
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,840
But it helps
if you're not dropping F-bombs.

90
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,677
Point noted. Filed right here.

91
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,805
So if I was to call this guy
an ass-monkey...

92
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:28,016
...that wouId be considered
a swear too, right?

93
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,228
It's gonna be a long night.

94
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,521
- So this thing?
- Yeah?

95
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:36,358
Is this some sort of torture device
when you don't get in your turnouts?

96
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,277
- That's what it is.
- Can you get it?

97
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,112
Yes. This is caIled a hook ladder.

98
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,739
We use this in the--
The firemen would use this--

99
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,491
- We should bring it down?
- Yes.

100
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,742
- Okay.
- All right.

101
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:46,994
Can you grab the hook?

102
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:49,162
So this was used
in the '20s and the '30s.

103
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,415
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

104
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,208
And as you can see...

105
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,211
...these are the rungs,
and the hook at the end...

106
00:04:56,379 --> 00:05:01,174
...they would grasp onto one window
and then pull themselves up.

107
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:05,178
And then when they got to that
windowsill, they would hook it again.

108
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,055
- And then puIl themseIves up.
- Okay.

109
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,224
Did you get the hook, Scott?
You see this?

110
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:12,102
Used in the '20s and '30s.
They stopped using it around--

111
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,229
- HoId it up higher.
- Replaced it--

112
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,647
- That's good, right?
- Good.

113
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,066
Replaced it
with a regular ladder that extends?

114
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,735
Yeah, and rope.

115
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,322
They must have tiny feet.
Those are little rungs.

116
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,824
Yeah. Firemen
were a Iot smaller back then.

117
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,869
The fires were bigger
and they were smaller.

118
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,707
- Don't tell captain we took this down.
- I'm not gonna teIl him l touched it.

119
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,960
I wanna introduce you to somebody.
This is Wilshire. Mark.

120
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,337
- Good boy.
- Hey, Wilshire.

121
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,380
- Say hi.
- Dog right out of the cartoons.

122
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:43,508
Well, there's a reason
why the DaImatians were in cartoons.

123
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,136
The fire department
has a great sense of tradition.

124
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,387
Yeah, we do.

125
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,348
Dalmatians
got along well with horses.

126
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,933
Important when the fire trucks
were horse-drawn.

127
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,518
Now they're used as mascots.

128
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,855
But what they're trained to do
is run in and stop the traffic.

129
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,940
- Kind of like Fletch.
- Yeah.

130
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:02,611
That's what l do, I run out there.
Sort of like what a siren does today.

131
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:06,698
Okay, welI, Wilshire can show you
what to do in case you catch on fire.

132
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,408
- Stop, drop and roll.
- Yeah.

133
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:11,078
So let's just pretend
you're 5 years old and on fire.

134
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:13,330
- I'm on fire.
- Wilshire's gonna teach you.

135
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,082
Tell me what to do.

136
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,250
Okay. Wilshire.

137
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:21,046
WiIshire, mark. Stay.

138
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,506
WiIshire, drop.

139
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:24,716
Drop. Drop.

140
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:28,136
WiIshire, roll.

141
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:29,638
- Good.
- Look at that.

142
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,140
Good boy. Good boy.

143
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,643
- I'm gonna live.
- Report.

144
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,603
You're not gonna be on fire.

145
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:40,524
So it's stop, drop and roll,
in case you catch on fire. Wilshire.

146
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,902
- Yeah, you know, have some fun.
- You all hang out a lot?

147
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,695
- Yeah.
- You kind of live together.

148
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,240
Yeah, we definitely live together.
Close quarters.

149
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,658
- Okay, good.
- Oh, ready?

150
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,494
So yeah, we have 48-hour shifts...

151
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,996
...so we have everything
we need in this place...

152
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:58,250
...from, you know,
a small gym to this handball court.

153
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,293
I'll show it to you.

154
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,840
- It's nice, right?
- Yeah.

155
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,428
Sir, you got a call on the office line.

156
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,638
Can you pick up a call
on the office line?

157
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,014
Non-responder.

158
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,307
- Oh, shoot.
- Yeah.

159
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,226
- I was hoping we'd get a call.
- Yeah.

160
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,895
Not a big one, a little call
so we can see action.

161
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,272
- Exciting, l guess.
- Yeah.

162
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,691
Gotta be annoying
when trying to finish a game.

163
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:23,942
Not if you're losing.

164
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,486
Every time, you know,
we go respond to a call...

165
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,155
...the points reset.

166
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:30,866
Depending on which side you're on,
it's sort of nice.

167
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,909
Works in your favor
from time to time?

168
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,245
Not in my favor.
What are you talking about?

169
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,746
I never lose.

170
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:39,458
I think I'd roller-skate
if l had access to this.

171
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,919
I can see you doing that. Yeah.

172
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,131
Okay, so this is where the men
store their boots and turnouts.

173
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,216
The pole hole is over here.

174
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,762
- The pole hole.
- Yeah, interesting name, I know.

175
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,723
- You got the locker room here.
- Yep.

176
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,016
You got the dorms here.

177
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,185
Our viewers
always like to see action...

178
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,562
...so maybe we should go
into the locker room.

179
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,898
- Let's go in the locker room.
- You got it.

180
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,693
- Right this way.
- I was kidding, l was kidding.

181
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,029
Okay, toweI up, guys.
We got a female on deck.

182
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,907
- Female on the deck.
- Oh, my God.

183
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:14,075
That's Griffin.
He can't sing very well.

184
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,328
He's got one major talent,
so come this way.

185
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,914
- He's got a huge talent.
- We're not using this.

186
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:22,751
Here. We have different hoses at
the station, and this is the Griffin hose.

187
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,212
- Griffin hose.
- What the hell?

188
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,380
You know,
I hope that's a wide-angle lens.

189
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,257
Oh, my God.

190
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,509
Stay in there.

191
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,677
Hey, put that thing away.

192
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,847
This is adding a whoIe new meaning
to the term fireman's hose.

193
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,432
- Hey, hit the floor.
- Oh, my--

194
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,559
I understand
why there are no women here.

195
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:42,062
- Plenty of female firefighters.
- In this station?

196
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,480
No, not currently.

197
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,233
Okay, l think I can be a firefighter.

198
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,528
- Yeah, it's a lot harder than it seems.
- Keep the door closed.

199
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,863
You know what?
Pick something you're good at.

200
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:55,033
I bet you $10 l can do it better.
You all can be my witnesses.

201
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,868
- That's too easy. Ten bucks?
- Yeah.

202
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,620
How about my place?

203
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,248
I think we're done here.
We got everything we need.

204
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:02,916
Here we go. Listen up.

205
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,043
Did you know
you were gonna be on camera?

206
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,003
- Behind the line. Ready?
- Yeah.

207
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,922
- Ten bucks.
- You can't be in the way.

208
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,632
- I know.
- Get on that side.

209
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,551
I'm just saying. You guys ready?

210
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,386
- You know what you're doing?
- Yes.

211
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,929
And go.

212
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,599
- Get in there.
- That's not nice.

213
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,685
That's not fair. She pushed.

214
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:24,854
- She pushed.
- Haven't got that much time.

215
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,901
- Yes. You owe her 10 bucks, man.
- Ten dollars.

216
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,153
Pay up. Oh, that's embarrassing.

217
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:35,156
- Oh, this is embarrassing.
- That's really embarrassing.

218
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,742
Okay, rolling.

219
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:42,205
Just waiting
on something to happen.

220
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,459
You wanna go back outside?
See what they're up to?

221
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,169
Why not?

222
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,882
- Careful.
- Thank you.

223
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,138
We're good.

224
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:04,436
You good?

225
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,730
I think they're talking about you.

226
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,398
WiIl you turn up his mike?

227
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:11,526
You didn't catch no eye.
Here, give me some of that.

228
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,321
I'll tell you, all right?

229
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,408
A hundred bucks
says I can bang her by the morning.

230
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,077
- Oh, come on.
- I'lI take that bet.

231
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,537
You're so busted.

232
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,789
Nice mike.

233
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,838
Missed a spot.

234
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:36,009
- Sorry, what?
- I said you missed a spot.

235
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:40,096
Oh, l know how to hit the spot.
Don't you worry about that.

236
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:44,684
I'll hold your camera.
You go kick his ass, okay?

237
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,985
That's how you do pick and roll.

238
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,695
Oh, yeah? Ls that how you do it?

239
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,114
He'lI show you how to do it later.

240
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,992
It's nighttime here...

241
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,329
...and the firefighters take turns
sleeping in these rooms here.

242
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:08,667
But if the alarm rings, they can be up
and on the truck in under one minute.

243
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,045
Let's check out the room.

244
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,131
Can you get in here?

245
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,886
It's like my college dorm
without the pink.

246
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:25,892
Attention, 222 Truck 16.

247
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,103
- Watch your back.
- Hey.

248
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,397
Looks like you got your call.

249
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,817
- Just try to keep up.
- You okay?

250
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,779
- We're going to the pole hole.
- Come on, come on.

251
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,115
- Got it?
- What you wanna do?

252
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,908
I can't slide down there.

253
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,244
Come here, come here,
come this way.

254
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,539
Careful, okay?
We have to get on that truck.

255
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,582
- There are Iike 15 stairs.
- I got it.

256
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,793
- You be careful.
- Keep going, keep going.

257
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,837
- It's this way?
- Yeah. Yeah, keep going.

258
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,714
- Be careful.
- Make a quick right.

259
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,133
Make a quick right, baby.

260
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,971
Just jump in the back.

261
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,813
- Jump in.
- Buckle up.

262
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,440
- We're almost in.
- You guys in?

263
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,692
- Yep, yep, yep.
- Yep?

264
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,486
Nice job.

265
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,871
What kind of calI is this?

266
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,372
Probably just a medical.

267
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,666
- Okay.
- We'Il find out when we get there.

268
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,918
You seem to have kept shooting.

269
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,589
Ready?

270
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,383
Ready, set. Ready, set.

271
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,887
Okay, good.

272
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:48,183
Most little girls wanna be ballerinas
or princesses when they grow up.

273
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,728
I used to tell my mom, "Someday,
I'm gonna grow up and be a fireman."

274
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,689
Tonight, I am truly Iiving the dream.

275
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,400
It's so Ioud,
I don't think we can use any of it.

276
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:00,278
Scott, l am still living the dream.

277
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,117
Thirty-seventeen, go ahead.

278
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,003
All right, we got a eight at 3 o'clock.

279
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:20,048
Keep calling out numbers.
What are you doing?

280
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,716
Well, Jake's the engineer.

281
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,302
He's actualIy
a third-generation engineer...

282
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,596
...but l have the most important job.

283
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:27,847
Navigating?

284
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,683
No,
I'm in charge of the chick-o-meter.

285
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,477
When I see a girl, l rate them.

286
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,647
So if I say
there's a eight at 3 o'clock...

287
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,608
...the guys know
they better look to the right.

288
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:43,780
You know, it's really funny. L always
thought firemen were so dignified.

289
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,533
Oh, no, no.
I signed up for brave and courageous.

290
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,829
- I don't do dignified.
- Yeah, I think we get that by now.

291
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,250
I see a nine at 2.

292
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,710
- Oh, we got a nine at 2.
- Yeah.

293
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,880
Whoa, that's a dude.

294
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,677
It's called a chick-o-meter,
not a dick-o-meter.

295
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,054
I think we're good.

296
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,974
You're fired. You can't talk anymore.

297
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,148
So where do you think
the problem is?

298
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:22,110
Do you think it's over there,
around the corner?

299
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,653
Or maybe around there?

300
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,238
You're rotten, you know that?

301
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:28,366
To the core, baby. To the core.

302
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,629
What are you taking with you?

303
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,423
Tools.

304
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:47,677
Really anything we might need
to break a lock or open a door.

305
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,138
- You're the one who called this in?
- Yeah.

306
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,431
Come, follow me.

307
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,224
Look at Probie's new turnouts.

308
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,643
I didn't know
they made them that new.

309
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,605
We're almost to the building.

310
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:01,399
Police are here. Might be more
serious than we thought.

311
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,151
Probably not.

312
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,872
A woman was screaming
bloody murder up there.

313
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,333
- It's Mrs. Espinoza.
- Two cops are up there.

314
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,543
- When did they get here?
- Five minutes ago.

315
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,004
- What's that sound?
- Sound of the building.

316
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,255
It's very oId.

317
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,091
- He insists on fixing everything.
- Wanda, please.

318
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,052
- What apartment number?
- It's up here.

319
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,596
- Go back to your apartments.
- We heard screams.

320
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,057
Well, at least get out of the way.

321
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,517
- Are they with you?
- Yeah. They're shadowing us.

322
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,353
Then they're your responsibility.

323
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,813
I teIl you not to fiIm something,
don't film it.

324
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,524
- I tell you to get lost, you get lost.
- No problem.

325
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:47,362
Here on the second floor on the right.
It's an oId woman, lives alone.

326
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,323
Probably fell.
Neighbors heard screams, called it in.

327
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,824
What are those peopIe doing?

328
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,661
You wouldn't believe
the way she screamed. It was crazy.

329
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:57,330
Neighbors say she's weird.
Doesn't talk to anybody.

330
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,665
She hasn't made a sound.

331
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,458
- Who are they?
- They're with Fire.

332
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,628
- I told them not to get in the way.
- Great. That's all we need.

333
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:14,097
Hello, ma'am, can you hear me?
It's L.A.P.D.

334
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,556
Ma'am, open up the door.

335
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:18,768
I'm here with paramedics.
We're gonna come in to help you.

336
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,146
If you're near the door,
I need you to move away from it.

337
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,899

She must have added locks.

00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,287
- I'm gonna do an intro.
- Yeah, you're good.

342
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:42,041
Okay. We're standing
outside an elderly woman's apartment.

343
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,293
Neighbors heard screams
and called 911.

344
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,754
The fire department's
about to begin the rescue.

345
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:50,550
Police say that she lives alone,
she's not very social--

346
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,680
I need you to get back,
brother, please, this time.

00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,811
- It's gonna be okay, ma'am.

- Come on, man.
- Gloves on, Danny.

384
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,941
Where's that blood coming from?

385
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,985
Hey, chief,
we're gonna need an ambulance here.

386
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,320
Copy. On our way.

387

Mrs. Espinoza,

388
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,952
All right,
I just need you to calm down, okay?

00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,039
It's all right.
Nobody's here to hurt you.

390
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,291
We can't help you
unless you calm down.

391
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,837
- An ambulance is on its way right now.
- All right.

392
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,339
Let's just clear a space.

393
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:57,135
Danny, get everybody out of here
until the ambulance gets here.

394
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,811
Get her off. Get off. Get her off.

Get him on the floor.
Get him on the floor.

396
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,443
No. We are not moving him.

397
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:17,488
- We are waiting for the ambulance.
- Do you see an ambulance?

398
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,115
We have to get him downstairs.

399
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:22,785

I got her. I got her.

403
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,251
Let's go.

404
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,378
- Get the fuck out of the way.
- Go, Scott.

405
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,338
Move that camera.

406
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,965
Come on, let's go, let's go.

407
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,968
- Did we get that?
- Move, move, move.

00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,429
- Let's go, open that door.
- Let's go.

409
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:44,223

00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,601
Tape everything, you hear me?

00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,855
- Open the door.
- It's locked.

413
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,399
How can that be?

414
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,152
- Open it, open it.
- Open.

415
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,321
- What do you mean?
- They won't let us out.

416
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,364
- Who locked those doors?
- It's not us.

417
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,242
Something is closing it from outside.

418
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:05,953
We need an ambulance.

419
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:09,415
Open the door. Open the door.

420
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,210
Is there a doctor in the house?

421
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,836
- You're a doctor?
- I'm a vet.

422
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,254
- Come on.
- Get over here.

423
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:18,049
- Put some pressure on that wound.
- Give me that rag.

00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,300
Get something.

425
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,427
- Back up, back up.
- Cover him up.

426
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,512
Why are they locking
if there's a fire?

427
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,390
There's no fire, Wanda.
There is no fire.

428
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,893
We have an officer down.
We have an officer down.

429
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,355
I need an ambulance immediateIy.
I need backup.

430
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,398
Does anybody copy?

431
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,567
I have a fucking hurt officer here.

432
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,195
What's going on?
Hey, what's happening?

433
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:40,780
Why can't we leave?

434
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,698
I know no more
than you do right now.

435
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,951
Back up.

436
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,786
My partner's on the floor bleeding.

437
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,247
- Quiet.
- Please remain calm.

438
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,874
We are working hard
to get you out of the building.

439
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,043
Please follow
the officers' instructions.

440
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,711
This will all be over shortly.

441
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,130
- What will all be over?
- What's going on?

442
00:20:58,298 --> 00:20:59,966
Why are we locked in our building?

443
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,676
Be calm. That's what that means.

444
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:04,971
Please remain calm and everything's--
Get the camera out of here.

445
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,640
Don't touch the camera.
We have every right to shoot.

446
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,851
- I'm tired of the camera.
- People need to see what's going on.

447
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,645
I'm in charge here. Turn it off--

448
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,648
If you were, you'd be worried
about getting your partner out.

449
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,149
Not whether we're shooting.

450
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:20,403
You are two steps
from being arrested, okay?

451
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,071
This man will bleed to death.

452
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:26,033
Everybody stop fighting, okay?
Stop fighting.

453
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,703
We need to get this man out of here.

454
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,789
- What's behind that door?
- That's a fabric workshop.

455
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,208
- What is it?
- Fabric, fabric.

456
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:37,920
- Is there a way out from there?
- Yeah, through the back. Come, come.

457
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,217
- Keep them back.
- Please, pIease.

458
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,928
You're not helping the situation.
Okay?

459
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,097
My husband's outside.
Said there are cops.

460
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,725
Blocked off the street.
He was getting antibiotics.

461
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,893
We gotta do something--

462
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,478
What the fuck.

463
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,063
- Jesus.
- Oh, Jesus.

464
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:59,317
- Oh, Jesus, Fletch.
- Oh, my God.

465
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,985
- Oh, Jesus.
- Okay, come on.

466
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,321
- Don't move him.
- No, we have to, we have to.

467
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,865
- Don't move him.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

468
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,617
All right, he's stiIl got a pulse.

469
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:09,869
Shit.

470
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,204
Get the vet over here.
Get the vet now.

471
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,957
- Vet, here, now.
- Get over here.

472
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,751
- Come here.
- Keep an eye on him.

473
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,878
He's still got a pulse.
Take care of him.

474
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,171
Okay, back away.

475
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,757
All right. Come with me, let's go.

476
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:25,176
Come on, come on.
You two stay here, all right?

477
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,427
Stay here.

478
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,262
Keep an eye on my partner, please.

479
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,930
Come on.

480
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:35,186
Let's get upstairs.

481
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,146
Come on, let's get upstairs.

482
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,106
I'm coming.

483
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,992
The sound's coming from in there.

484
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,744
Okay.

485
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,497
Move over.

486
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,843
Oh, Scott, don't.

487
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,222
Don't go in there, Scott.

488
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,933
Scott.

489
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,864
- Watch out.
- Oh, my God.

490
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:21,750
She's dead.

491
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,586
- She's dead.
- What?

492
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:26,213
What are you two doing here?
Get the camera back.

493
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:28,507
We need to get you guys out of here.

494
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:31,302
Ma'am. Ma'am? Ma'am? Ma'am?

495
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,346
Ma'am, listen to me.
Can you hear me, Miss Espinoza?

496
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:37,057
I need you to stay

497
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,976
All right?
We wanna heIp you here.

00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:42,021
Put your hands in the air for me,
Mrs. Espinoza.

499
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:45,274
Okay? Put your hands in the air.

500
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,905
Oh, my God.

501
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:01,957
Let's go.

502
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,544
Put the gun down. Let's go.

503
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,963
- She was coming right at us.
- Yeah.

504
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:10,216

Okay, you saw that, right?

00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,765
Okay. All right.

Okay. Okay, okay.

516
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:41,223
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know. I think--

517
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,350
Is everything okay?

518
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:47,229
We shouId probably
just get down the stairs, okay?

519
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,983
I know, I know, I know.

520
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,652
- Oh, my God.
- We just have to get downstairs.

521
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,238
Fire department.

00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:05,539

00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:19,428
- Was there a fire?
- No, it's just a precaution.

527
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:21,889
Just a precaution for what?

528
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,683
Look,
we just need you to get downstairs.

529
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:31,815
Does this have anything to do
with the cable being out?

530
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:35,152
- Come on, let's go.
- What? Wait, wait, wait.

531
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,989
- What if l don't wanna go?
- Then l'd be forced to force you.

532
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,159
Hi. L'm with the fire department.

533
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,662
We need everyone

534
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:51,585
Do you speak English?

535
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,712

Hello, ma'am?

00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:38,841
We need you to quickly and calmly

544
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,678
Excuse me, ma'am.

00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,436
Ma'am.

546
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,148
Ma'am,
we need you to get downstairs, okay?

547
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:55,649
What's wrong with her?

548
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,401
I don't know.

549
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,573
- You wanna give me a hand?
- Yeah.

550
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,409
- I don't know that that's a good idea.
- She needs help.

551
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,994
Just grab her.

552
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,747
Okay. Now lift her up.

553
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,707
Okay.

554
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,626
We're just taking you downstairs,

Oh, Jesus.

557
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:24,803
Okay? Okay?

558
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:28,432
Okay? Yeah.

559
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,727
Oh, she's really sick.

560
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:46,784
Holy shit. Did you see that?

561
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:51,914
That rat just totally came after me.
Hey, did you see that?

562
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,957
Come on.

563
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,588
Un-fucking-beIievabIe.

564
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:03,133
- Oh, my God, look at Elise.
- Somebody grab that chair.

565
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:07,262
- What's wrong with her?
- Set her down, set her down.

566
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:10,474
Can't stop the bleeding.
Get him to a hospital. He's gonna die.

567
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,392
Stay here.
I'm gonna check the exit.

568
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,561
No, no, wait.
We are under strict orders--

569
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:17,022
We're under orders
to stay in the hall. HeIp me.

570
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,983
Fuck your orders, all right?
My friend's dying!

571
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,986
- I'm coming out.
- Do not--

572
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:26,281
- Didn't catch that. You're breaking up.
- Two people have died.

573
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:30,077
Two others are in need of medical
care. Police have blocked off the exit.

574
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:33,747
They've given us no expIanation.
We're trying to find a way out.

575
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:34,998
- Oh, my God.
- Shit.

576
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,000
- Get away from the window.
- Go, go.

577
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,419
You need to remain in the buiIding.

578
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,631
We have civilians in here.

579
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,398
Briana, don't.

580
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:03,318
Attention, please.
Do not try to leave the building.

581
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:06,905
All exits have been sealed.
Just stay calm.

582
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:10,284
We will send someone in there
shortly to assess the situation.

583
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:13,287
Thank you for your cooperation.

584
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:15,789
What are we supposed to do?

585
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,959
- What are we supposed to do?
- Just wait.

586
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:34,808
There's five there. What happened?

587
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,989
Sir, sir, sir.

588
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,199
Give me your headphones.

589
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,123
No, you're not getting my question.

590
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,583
Not getting my question.

591
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,877
I'm asking
why they're calling this a BNC.

592
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,712
- What's a BNC?
- I don't know.

593
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:08,425
Hello?

594
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,801
- HeIlo?
- HeIlo?

595
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:12,471
- Is somebody there?
- HeIlo?

596
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,725
Honey, hello?

597
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:21,021
Why is the phone breaking?
Why is it not working?

598
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,941
- What's a BNC?
- Who said anything about--?

599
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,609
- You. You're stilI miked.
- Wait.

600
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:26,860
- What?
- Don't jump to--

601
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,695
What's a BNC? What is it?

602
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:31,239
They're calling this a BNC?

603
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,368
A biological,
nuclear or chemical threat.

604
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:35,953
- Oh, my God.
- Nuclear?

605
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,621
- What?
- No, don't worry, okay?

606
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,791
- It's more common than you think.
- Supposed to be reassuring?

607
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:44,252
Our cell phones don't work.
Neither do the TVs or our radios.

608
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,421
- Why are they isolating us?
- I don't know.

609
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,006
My daughter has a fever.

610
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,300
- What does she have?
- They're pointing guns.

611
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,969
You can't keep us trapped here.

612
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,762
- We're all trapped.
- That's right.

613
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,515
We are all trapped in here.
Step over here.

614
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,058
- Here.
- What will they do?

615
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,727
- Step over here, pIease.
- Jake, Jake.

616
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:05,691
There might be-- From the office on
the second floor, there is an overhang.

617
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:09,152
Maybe we can use
to jump down to the patio.

618
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:11,071
- Let's go.
- I show you.

619
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,614
I'm going with you.

620
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,455
Don't turn the light on.

621
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:22,958
I don't want anyone knowing
we're in here.

622
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,755
Careful.

623
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,358
- When l open the window--
- Yeah?

624
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,235
--Go to the right side and jump.

625
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,988
It's only two and a half meters.

626
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,871
Get away from the window.

627
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,372
- For your own safety.
- No.

628
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,249
- Step away.
- Wait, wait, wait.

629
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,834
- Step away.
- Wait, listen.

630
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:08,336
Can you see me? Can you see me?

631
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:12,007
- What are you doing?
- We have a fiIm crew in here.

632
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:14,885
Tell your boss
we have a TV crew in here.

633
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:18,847
We are filming this. Please, wait.

634
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:21,183
People are gonna see
what you're doing to us.

635
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:25,312
- Why can't we go out?
- People are gonna see this.

636
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,818
Please. Wait.

637
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,945
What are you doing in here?

638
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:36,281
- You knew about this, didn't you?
- Knew what?

639
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,533
That they're sealing us in here.

640
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:41,078
What the fuck is this?

641
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,040
- What is going on?
- You tell us.

642
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:48,627
I don't know anything and don't you
fucking put your hands on me again.

643
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:51,713
I don't know anything, okay?

644
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:53,632
Get this fucking camera out.

645
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,801
- Don't touch me.
- Don't touch that camera.

646
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:58,136
We need to show people
what's going on here.

647
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:00,138
- Only proof we have.
- Don't you get it?

648
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:03,600
You're locked in here Iike us.
You think they give a shit about you?

649
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,019
- Step back.
- Hey, hey, hey.

650
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,563
- Let's all just calm down, alI right?
- Shut up.

651
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:11,483
- Put the gun down.
- Shut up.

652
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,361
Go back downstairs now, okay?

653
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,987
Yeah, okay, okay, but--

654
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,739
Shut up!

655
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:20,617
Damn. Go back downstairs.

656
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,702
This thing is getting to all of us.

657
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,080
No one here
is gonna hurt you, okay?

658
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,874
We're trying to get out.
That's all we're trying to do.

659
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:30,418
Just put the gun down.

660
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,632
I'm sorry, man.

661
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:39,302
- I'm sorry, all right?
- Yeah.

662
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,096
I was just freaked out. Let's go.

663
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,973
- We all are.
- Go downstairs, okay?

664
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:46,226
- All right?
- Yeah, let's get downstairs, man.

665
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,687
Shit.

666
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,939
Fuck.

667
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,250
Grab his legs, okay?
Come on, let's go.

668
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,502
What we'll do
is we'll roll him on his side.

669
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:16,214
We just have to be really careful.

670
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:20,385
- What time is it?
- One-thirty-seven.

671
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:24,347
Five, four, three....

672
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:27,642
It's 1 :37 in the morning,
and everyone is scared.

673
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:30,604
They've given us no information,
cut off communication...

674
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:34,441
...from walkie-talkies and cell phones
to the building's cable and lnternet.

675
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,652
The people trapped here,
myself included...

676
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,322
...can't help but ask why.

677
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,350
How's he doing?

678
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:11,311
Well, he's not good.

679
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:23,907
Yeah.

680
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,993
Excuse me. It's Terrence, right?

681
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:30,121
- No, Lawrence.
- Lawrence, right.

682
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:34,084
Listen, I've got a ton of Vicodin
in my apartment, if that will help.

683
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,669
Yeah, that's gonna help.

684
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:37,712
I'll just-- I'll grab a bunch of stuff.

685
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,216
I basically got a pharmacy up there.

686
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,595
You can't arrest me for that,
because of self-incrimination--

687
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:49,349
Sir, you are the Ieast
of my worries right now, okay?

688
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,810
- All right, I was just asking.
- Go.

689
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,020
Do what you're gonna do, please.

690
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:57,524
I'm going. L'm going.

691
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:05,031
You ever seen
anything like this before?

692
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:08,034
No, I've never
seen anything like this.

693
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:10,495
Mostly because l'm a vet.

694
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:14,249
I don't usually treat people.
Dogs and cats, mostly.

695
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:17,877
All I can really do is l can dress
their wounds and try to comfort them.

696
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,838
How are the injured men doing?

697
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,841
They both lost a lot of bIood,
and the fireman over here...

698
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:27,387
...he's got a bunch of broken bones
and probable internal bleeding.

699
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:34,352
ApparentIy, Mrs. Espinoza attacked
and bit them in some kind of a fit.

700
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,148
But honestly,
I find that a little hard to believe...

701
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:43,320
...that an oId Iady could do
something like this to two grown men.

702
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,906
Ready? Ready to film?

703
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,117
Okay.

704
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,828
- What's your name?
- Briana.

705
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:55,457
Briana, that's a very pretty name.
How old are you, Briana?

706
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:59,169
- Five.
- And who do you live with?

707
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:02,922
With my mom
and my dad and my dog, Max.

708
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,759
Max. L haven't met Max. Where is he?

709
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:08,887
My dad took him to the vet
because he's sick.

710
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:11,765
- You sound a littIe sick yourself.
- Yeah.

711
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:15,643
- She's had it for weeks, it's not like--
- You know what?

712
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:19,230
If you don't mind, I'd like to keep
you quiet while I interview Briana.

713
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:22,192
It confuses the audience
when people talk from off-camera.

714
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,486
- Oh, God, l'm sorry.
- No, no, it's okay.

715
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:26,988
- I'lI interview you afterwards.
- No, that's fine.

716
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:28,490
- Okay.
- We don't need that.

717
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:30,658
Okay, thank you.

718
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:33,203
I don't like being sick.

719
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,955
Yeah, l don't like being sick either.

720
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:37,999
Briana, you're a very brave girI...

721
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:40,585
...and l'm really happy
we got a chance to meet.

722
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:41,836
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

723
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:43,963
She's been fearless
since she was littIe.

724
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:46,007
She's an incredibly strong child.

725
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,009
Okay? Okay.

726
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,637
Why don't you just start
by introducing yourselves?

727
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,932
Well, I'm Ber-- I'm Bernard.
This is my roommate, Sadie.

728
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,308
And this is Martini.

729
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,560
And how long
have you lived in the building?

730
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,187
I've Iived here six years.

731
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,106
I've been here two and a half years.

732
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:03,400
And what do you do for a living?

733
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:04,776
I'm an opera teacher.

734
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:08,071
Sadie's my best student, my protege.

735
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,993
- Oh, my God.
- Fletcher.

736
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,954
Where's the vet?

737
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:17,247
Oh, my God.

738
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,707
Where the hell is the doctor?

739
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:22,043
I got him, got him, got him.

740
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,839
Hold him, hold him.
Hold his neck, hold his neck.

741
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:27,090
What is that?

742
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,968
- HoId it over, hold his neck.
- Go, go, go.

743
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,178
Oh, my God, is he stilI aIive?

744
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:35,140
Hold him still, hold him still.
He's gonna go down.

745
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:39,686
Martini.

746
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,855
Sadie, stay here. Stay.

747
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:44,858
No, no, stay here, stay here.
No, the dog will come back.

748
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:46,818
Martini.

749
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,570
Hold him.

750
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,040
- Okay, I have to show you something.
- What?

751
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:03,042
Have to show you something.
Just a sec.

752
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,878
I think I know what this is.

753
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:10,300
- Come, come look, look, look.
- Oh, Jesus.

754
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,261
Her tear ducts and saIivary glands
are constantly flowing.

755
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,847
She seems
to be unable to swallow or speak.

756
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,599
She has a fever, she's confused.

757
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:20,268
She has some degree
of paralysis and delirium.

758
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:24,022
These are all rabies symptoms.

759
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,607
- Are you sure?
- I'm a vet.

760
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:28,568
Never seen it in humans,
but I know what rabies look like.

761
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,196
Are you trying to tell me
these people have rabies?

762
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,989
Tears, saliva, fever.

763
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:36,534
Tears, saliva, fever.
They have what she has.

764
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:39,913
But here's the thing. Rabies
takes months for symptoms to show.

765
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,374
This is taking minutes.
I mean, rabies never acts this fast.

766
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:45,335
How does rabies spread?
Through bites?

767
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:49,005
No, it's passed through anything wet.
Blood, saliva, any mucous membrane.

768
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:52,258
So if you get their blood on you,
you're okay.

769
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,135
But if you get their blood on you...

770
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:56,638
...and it gets into a cut,
into your mouth, eyes...

771
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:59,098
...then you're not okay.

772
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:01,017
How's it cured?

773
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:03,686
No, there's no cure.

774
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,855
People get shots in their stomach.

775
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,524
Before symptoms starts showing.

776
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:11,694
Once symptoms show,
rabies is 100 percent fatal.

777
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,572
Shit.

778
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:17,492
Yeah, shit.

779
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:22,539
- Where are you going? Where?
- I'm going up to my apartment.

780
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,415
- What?
- I am going upstairs.

781
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:25,708
You can't do that.

782
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,043
- Why?
- Come down.

783
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,336
- Why?
- What do you mean?

784
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:30,672
- Why can't l go?
- We gonna do this all night?

785
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,924
- You know why?
- Because it's not safe there.

786
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:35,718
Oh, yeah,
because it's really safe down here.

787
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,428
- You're drunk.
- You know what?

788
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:40,723
It seems to me, if this is spreading,
maybe we should separate...

789
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,892
...instead of sitting here
in a big group.

790
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,979
You done? You finished?

791
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:47,397
- You done?
- You know what?

792
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:52,277
I have a God-given right to protect
myself as I see fit, so you know what?

793
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:54,320
- I'm gonna go upstairs--
- Step back.

794
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:57,365
I'm gonna go and l'm
gonna barricade the shit out of it.

795
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:00,952
- Where do you think they're going?
- You can all sit here and rot.

796
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,954
Oh, you are so close to going to jail.

797
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:06,624
- Are you some kind of affirmative--?
- You are so close to going to jail.

798
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:08,126
- Hey.
- Hurry up, hurry up.

799
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,919
- What?
- Where are you going?

800
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:12,505
Look, this lets out
right next to our apartment.

801
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:15,341
We wanna see if there's anything
on the news about this.

802
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:16,843
- But the cable's out.
- Cable?

803
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:19,387
We still use rabbit ears on our TV.

804
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:23,182
We're going with you.
Wait, wait, wait, we're going with you.

805
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,937
It's just up here to the right.

806
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,320
You're good?

807
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:37,822
- Stop. Just stop.
- What?

808
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,282
Go back downstairs.

809
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,951
The door locked behind me.

810
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,621
Just stay there.

811
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:46,998
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

812
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,875
Hey, look out.

813
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,877
- Oh, my God!
- Look out.

814
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:54,172
No, no, no!

815
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:01,346
We can't just open the door. We need
something to hoId the dog back with.

816
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:05,391
- Find something!
- There's a fire extinguisher.

817
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,645
Oh, my God.

818
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,023
Stop, stop.

819
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,858
Listen.

820
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:19,405
Turn it off, Scott. Turn it off.

821
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,201
Oh, l forgot something.

822
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,703
- Shouldn't we shut the door?
- Close the door.

823
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,332
- Okay.
- I left the music on.

824
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,958
Folk music.

825
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:33,127
The TV's back here.

826
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:35,046
All right.

827
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:38,091
Okay.

828
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:41,052
It usually takes
a couple of seconds to....

829
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,388
There we go, all right.

830
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,807
- Fiddle with this--
- Make sure that--

831
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:47,475
No, I know what I'm doing.

832
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,519
- No, I'm--
- Yeah, I know, all right?

833
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,854
- ...third hour of our coverage.
- There.

834
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,816
- There it is.
- ...receiving conflicting reports.

835
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:58,111
--Hind me was comp-- Evacuated....

836
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,991
--that the CDC...

837
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,703
Chief.

838
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:10,331
Tell us why the CDC
is entering the building.

839
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:14,335
Precaution.
Everyone's been evacuated.

840
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,004
What?

841
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:19,298
Why would he broadcast that?

842
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:21,092
Why would he say that?

843
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,886
What the fuck is going on here?

844
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,141
- What happened?
- Power's out.

845
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:30,727
Oh, Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.

846
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:34,439
- What was that?
- Quiet.

847
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:41,195
Sadie, stay with me.
Sadie, come here.

848
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:44,031
Sadie, come over here.

849
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:47,201
Stay with me. Lt cannot be.

850
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:49,370
- Stay with me.
- You gotta close that door.

851
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:51,497
Sadie, Iook out.

852
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,209
- Get off me.
- Oh, my God.

853
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:58,171
Get off of me.

854
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:04,218
Bernard, stay with me.

855
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:14,479
Hit her again!

856
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:28,951
Oh, my God.

857
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,919
Angela, you have blood
all over your shirt.

858
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,242
- Scott.
- What?

859
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:12,328
Scott.

860
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:18,251
What do you want?

861
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:21,838
You okay?

862
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:25,091
Yeah, l'm just fine.

863
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:27,677
I mean, l just killed something
with my camera...

864
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:30,346
...and, you know, l'm just fine.

865
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,265
Yeah.

866
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:35,268
Scott.

867
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,646
What, Angela? What you...?

868
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:41,440
I need a moment now.

869
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:46,362
I'm with you.

870
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:57,748
- I'm with you, you're with me, okay?
- Okay, okay, okay, we're here.

871
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:00,751
We're here together, all right?

872
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:03,963
We get out of here as fast
as we fucking can, you hear me?

873
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,340
- Okay, okay.
- Together?

874
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:11,178
- That everybody?
- Getting the last one.

875
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:13,472
All right, keep going.

876
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:17,101
All right, it's been a long,
exhausting night for all of us...

877
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:19,520
...but we just got word from outside.

878
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:22,106
Well, it's about bloody fucking time,
isn't it?

879
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:24,442
Yes, they told me
they're sending in the CDC.

880
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:25,860
- CDC?
- What's--?

881
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,695
- Center for Disease Control.
- Why?

882
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:30,239
Yes, but relax, it's fine.
They're gonna come in.

883
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:33,326
They're gonna run blood tests
on residents to clarify things.

884
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:36,287
- Just the residents?
- No, everybody.

885
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:38,289
Everybody,
so once they check it out...

886
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:41,375
...make sure everything's okay,
we should be abIe to get out.

887
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:43,127
- Oh, thank God.
- That won't work.

888
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:46,631
- What are you talking about?
- That doesn't work, not for rabies.

889
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:50,384
- Nobody said anything about rabies.
- I did, I told you it was rabies.

890
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:52,178
How do you test for rabies?

891
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,847
There's only one way.
You gotta get a brain sampIe.

892
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,349
- Come on.
- Man, just shut up.

893
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:59,143
- What you have to do.
- Let's make sure everyone's here.

894
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:00,770
A simple "here" will be fine.

895
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:03,314
So let's get started.

896
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:05,775
- How many units per floor?
- Three.

897
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,068
- There are three.
- Okay.

898
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:09,862
Second floor, Unit A,
that's where Mrs. Espinoza lives?

899
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,364
- Yes.
- Who's in B?

900
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:13,032
- Me and Sadie.
- Here.

901
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,117
Who's in Unit C?

902
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,452
Unit C.

903
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,287
The lawyer.

904
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:19,538
- Randy.
- Elevat--

905
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:21,999
All right, third floor, Unit A.
Who's up there?

906
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:25,044
That's me, my daughter
and my husband, who's been outside--

907
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:27,004
Yes, yes, yes, we know. Thank you.

908
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:28,714
- Unit B, please.
- Us.

909
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:30,800
- My wife and me.
- Who's in Unit C?

910
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,301
- Vacant.
- Why we doing this?

911
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,136
- Vacant.
- Nobody's been there--

912
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:37,848
- Fourth floor, Unit A, who's up there?
- That was Elise. She's dead.

913
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:39,809
- What?
- She's dead?

914
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:43,396
- 4B, who's in B?
- It's me, me, here.

915
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,608
- Who's in C?
- It's them.

916
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:48,859
You two?

917
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:51,737
They don't understand you.
Them and her father.

918
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:55,199
- And her father's upstairs?
- Sick, he's paralytic.

919
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:57,618
Maybe this is all his fault.

920
00:49:57,786 --> 00:50:01,372
- How do you know? You don't know--
- Listen up, all right, let's finish up.

921
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,874
- Okay.
- Somebody knows.

922
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:06,752
What was I even gonna say?
Who lives in the attic?

923
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:11,465
A man from Boston. He rents it,
but I haven't seen him in months.

924
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:14,343
Wait, if her father's upstairs,
should we bring him down?

925
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:17,179
What if he's the cause?
We can't bring sick people here.

926
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:20,516
- Your daughter's sick, isn't she?
- She has fever. Hardly the same.

927
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,935
Yeah, so we should bring
her father downstairs.

928
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,687
- Hey, hey.
- Stop, stop it.

929
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,439
- Hey.
- Stop fighting.

930
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:28,649
- Listen.
- How many times you gonna do this?

931
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:30,609
Nobody's going.
We're gonna stay here.

932
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:33,779
They'll let us know
when they wanna move us, period.

933
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:35,531
Can we finish?

934
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:36,824
- Fine.
- Thank you.

935
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,576
The cleaning lady.

936
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:39,910
Yeah, the cleaning lady.

937
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:42,705
- The cleaning Iady was here.
- I saw her this morning.

938
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,540
She's deceased.

939
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,000
- What?
- What did he say?

940
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:47,877
- What?
- She's gone.

941
00:50:57,554 --> 00:51:00,264
Stand back from the door.

942
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:02,933
Open the door.

943
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:05,519
- Show me your hands.
- L.A.P.D.

944
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:21,035
CDC's now making their way
into the building.

945
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:22,995
There are security measures in place.

946
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:25,164
We still have no idea
what's happening.

947
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:28,084
From the look of the precaution
that they're taking...

948
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:30,586
...it's something very serious.

949
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:35,508
I want you
to just keep this area clear.

950
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,666
This is....

951
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:10,709
This is bIood from my partner here.

952
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:15,089
He's in the back. This blood
is from the second firefighter.

953
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:21,887
You, turn it off. Turn it off now.

954
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:23,139
Now. Turn it off.

955
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:24,974
Okay, okay, it's off.

956
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,143
Jesus.

957
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:30,688
Okay, everyone here.
Everybody here is good.

958
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:33,566
The two guys are in the back.
That's all we can tell you.

959
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:36,235
- I don't know anything else right now.
- Okay.

960
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:39,113
Just take me to the injured.
Everyone else stays here.

961
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:41,282
You heard him. Stay here.

962
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,411
Clear this area.

963
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:53,252
They tell us to stay caIm,
and they come dressed Iike that?

964
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:57,715
- It's gonna be all right.
- What? You honestly believe that?

965
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:08,517
I'm gonna open it.

966
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:17,193
Can you see?

967
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,652
That's good. That's good.

968
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:21,906
I'm gonna take samples
from both men.

969
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:38,714
Up here. Up here.

970
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,216
- Okay.
- Can you get up there?

971
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:42,134
Yeah, okay, cool.

972
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:45,346
Hey, hoId this, hold this.

973
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:49,934
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

974
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:51,644
You got it?

975
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,231
Okay, give it to me.

976
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:57,441
Give me the camera, come on.

977
00:53:57,609 --> 00:54:00,069
Give me the camera.

978
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,491
- Can you see?
- Yeah.

979
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:07,493
What's happening?

980
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,412
- They're handcuffing him.
- Who?

981
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,331
Fletcher.

982
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,761
The other one's got a syringe.

983
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:40,276
He just gave Fletcher a shot.

984
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:07,261
- Oh, shit.
- What?

985
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:09,555
He's got a drill.

986
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:17,855
- Oh, Jesus.
- What?

987
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:20,524
I think the vet was right.

988
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:30,659
I think he's taking a brain sampIe.

989
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:56,101
- HoIy shit.
- Scott?

990
00:55:57,145 --> 00:55:58,979
Hey, look out.

991
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:12,659
Angela, run. Run!

992
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:16,413
The vet's in there.
He's still in there.

993
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:18,665
- Open the door.
- We can't, he's been bitten.

994
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:21,585
- Come on, let him out.
- I'm not infected, you're wrong.

995
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,295
I'm not infected. L'm all right.

996
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:25,756
- They didn't get me.
- What are you talking about?

997
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:29,259
- Are you sure he's been bitten?
- Yes, and l'm not taking any chances.

998
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:32,137
Back away tiIl the infected people
have been handcuffed.

999
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:34,098
Infected with what?

1000
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:37,601
- Would you get that out of my face?
- What happens happens in the open.

1001
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:40,521
They have a right to shoot this,
okay?

1002
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,651
- You okay?
- Lawrence.

1003
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,319
Lawrence, you okay?

1004
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:49,655
God, this isn't right.

1005
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,281
Calm down, calm down. No.

1006
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:55,536
- It's not right.
- It would not be right to let him out--

1007
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:03,627
You telI us what's going on.

1008
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:05,671
- I'm not authorized to tell--
- Bullshit.

1009
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,215
You Ieft my friend
because he tried to kill you.

1010
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:09,466
Tell us what you know.

1011
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:12,428
- Tell us what you know.
- Yeah, okay, goddamn, okay.

1012
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:15,514
We got a call from a vet
who had a sick dog brought in.

1013
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:19,059
They ran the routine tests,
it was nothing they'd ever seen before.

1014
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:21,395
Then it started
attacking the other animaIs.

1015
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:23,730
And within an hour,
all the injured animals...

1016
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:26,692
...showed the same kind
of aggression.

1017
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:30,571
Yeah. The dog's collar
led us to this building.

1018
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:33,949
Was the dog's name Max?

1019
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,617
Yes.

1020
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:42,791
- She only has bronchitis.
- Bullshit, bronchitis.

1021
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:45,586
- No, don't you dare.
- Kathy.

1022
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:47,379
- Bronchitis.
- We need to find out.

1023
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,423
Relax, ma'am. Relax.
We have to be sure.

1024
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:50,883
No, get away from me.

1025
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:53,135
Dog spread the infection
through his saliva.

1026
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,428
We just gotta check.

1027
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:56,096
- Let him do a check, ma'am.
- No.

1028
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:57,389
That's all we gotta do.

1029
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:59,975
That's all she has, just bronchitis.

1030
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:02,311
- No.
- Go, go.

1031
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,605
Get back. Get back.

1032
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:06,940
Get back. Watch out.

1033
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:10,277
Run, Briana. Run, sweetheart.

1034
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:12,404
- Get the girl.
- No, get away from her.

1035
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:14,531
- HoId her. Hold her.
- Run!

1036
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:16,700
- Run, sweetie, please!
- Get the handcuffs.

1037
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:19,536
- Come on, come on.
- No, let me go.

1038
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:21,371
Don't hurt her. Please!

1039
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:23,373
Please,
you need to get us out of here.

1040
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:26,043
Stop it! Stop it!

1041
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:27,836
- Cuff her.
- No.

1042
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,087
Come here. Come.

1043
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:30,672
- Honey.
- She's cuffed.

1044
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,090
- Honey.
- Back away.

1045
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:35,677
Back away.
Calm down, calm down, calm down.

1046
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:37,596
- No.
- Father.

1047
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:38,847
- Father.
- What father?

1048
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:41,308
- Her father's sick in bed.
- Nobody told me that.

1049
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:43,143
We thought everyone was down here.

1050
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:45,562
All right, here. Take this.

1051
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,481
Get the girl and inject her with it.

1052
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:49,858
- No, no.
- And you, bring everybody down here.

1053
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,777
Bring Briana. Okay.

1054
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:54,571
Kathy, we're gonna get her.
We're gonna bring her down.

1055
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:56,406
- Run, honey!
- Going up.

1056
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:58,325
- We're not gonna hurt you.
- Get away!

1057
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:02,621
Get away from her! Honey.

1058
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:04,915
Briana.

1059
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,375
Run!

1060
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,794
Honey.

1061
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:11,713
Briana.

1062
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,966
Get away from her.

1063
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:15,592
Oh, God.

1064
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,011
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

1065
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:24,810
Okay, okay. AIl right.

1066
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:28,605
Briana?

1067
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:31,984
Oh, God.

1068
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:37,906
- Where the hell's the old lady?
- The old lady's gone.

1069
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:43,120
Briana?

1070
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:45,998
Okay. Just take it easy, okay?

1071
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:57,342
Briana?

1072
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:07,811
Oh, Briana.

1073
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:10,731
- Briana?
- Briana?

1074
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:12,816
Shit.

1075
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:15,402
Shit, I'm sorry.

1076
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:19,489
Briana?

1077
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:28,248
Oh, shit.

1078
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:34,630
Briana?

1079
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:39,384
Oh, l think she's in here, Jake.

1080
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,347
Hell.

1081
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:47,434
She's over there. She's over there.

1082
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:49,311
You all right?

1083
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:52,230
Now, l need you
to give me your hand, okay?

1084
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,232
Okay?

1085
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,652
What happened to her eyes?

1086
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:05,243
Please don't stop. Please, don't.

1087
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:07,162
Get her off me.

1088
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:09,456
Go, go.

1089
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:12,084
She bit me. Go, Jake!

1090
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:18,548
- Get out of here.
- Go, go, go.

1091
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:20,717

- Go, go, go.

1093
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:24,596
They're getting out.

1094
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:26,515
No, no, no.

1095
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:28,308
- Go back.
- They're getting out.

1096
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:32,354
Oh, they're getting out. Run, run!

1097
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:47,994
Don't go. Wait!

They're getting close. Run.

01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:57,796
Okay. Run! Run!

1100
01:01:57,964 --> 01:01:59,965
Don't leave me.

1101
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:03,051
- Don't leave me.
- I'm not gonna leave her.

1102
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:05,554
- Don't leave me.
- We have to get out of here.

1103
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:09,224
It's not right! It's not right!

1104
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:18,692
- Come on.
- No, no, not that way. This way.

1105
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:26,074
Hurry up, come on.
Where are the others?

1106
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:27,325
Come on, let's go.

1107
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:31,163
Hurry up.

1108
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:33,999
- Lock it, lock it, lock it!
- Hurry up.

1109
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:52,809
Help me, help me.

1110
01:03:10,244 --> 01:03:11,328
- Were you bitten?
- No.

1111
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:15,457
- You?
- No.

1112
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:20,212
Scott?

1113
01:03:20,379 --> 01:03:22,964
- Were you bitten?
- No.

1114
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,634
Angie?

1115
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:27,844
No.

1116
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:32,557
- Hey, what about you?
- No, no.

1117
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:35,769
Hey, you.

1118
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:37,229
On the floor.

1119
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:40,649
- Hey, you been bitten?
- No, no.

1120
01:03:41,108 --> 01:03:43,777
Jake, did you find the little girl?

1121
01:03:43,945 --> 01:03:45,987
Who gives a shit about the little girl?

1122
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:48,490
All right.
We've lost control of the building.

1123
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,367
We're fucked.

1124
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:52,494
Damn it.

1125
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:55,372
I don't understand.

1126
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,876
I don't understand.
They were biting her face off.

1127
01:04:00,044 --> 01:04:01,920
I don't know
what the fuck is happening.

1128
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:03,755
- Damn it.
- I don't understand.

1129
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:06,758
We could aIl be infected by now.
We gotta get out of here.

1130
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:08,176
I'm not moving. I'm done.

1131
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:10,720
- I'm not moving.
- Hey, we wait here, we wait here.

1132
01:04:10,888 --> 01:04:12,639
- We have to get out of here.
- Listen.

1133
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:16,768
We have to stay here and wait
till somebody come and get us.

1134
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:18,603
They're not gonna come and get us.

1135
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:20,939
- Oh, yes, they will.
- They are not gonna come!

1136
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:23,900
They don't give a shit about us!
They're gonna let us die!

1137
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:26,653
They don't care about us.

1138
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:30,282
Scott, we're gonna die!

1139
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:33,243
- Oh, fuck.
- She's right.

1140
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:35,036
- Who was that?
- It was the doctor.

1141
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:36,413
What?

1142
01:04:36,914 --> 01:04:38,582
- I'm gonna kill you.
- I've been bit.

1143
01:04:38,749 --> 01:04:39,916
You Ieft us down there.

1144
01:04:40,084 --> 01:04:41,668
Piece of shit.

1145
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:43,795
I've been bitten.

1146
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:45,755
He's been bitten.

1147
01:04:45,923 --> 01:04:47,966
He's been bitten. Get back.

1148
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:49,426
Close those doors.

1149
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:52,345
Somebody close
those fucking doors.

1150
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:58,226
It won't hold him.

1151
01:04:59,812 --> 01:05:01,771
It's not gonna hold him for long.

1152
01:05:01,939 --> 01:05:03,690
- Get back.
- She's bleeding.

1153
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:05,817
She's bleeding.

1154
01:05:10,823 --> 01:05:12,282
Sadie.

1155
01:05:13,117 --> 01:05:14,618
No.

1156
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:16,244
We have to kiIl her.

1157
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:18,747
No, no.

1158
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:24,586
Hey, hey, hey,
you're not gonna fucking touch her.

1159
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,296
We gotta get out. Gotta get out.

1160
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:29,049
Gotta get out of here.
Gotta get out of here. Come on.

1161
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:31,426
Help me get out of here.

1162
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:33,803
Let me get out of here, please.

1163
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:36,056
Hey, hey.

1164
01:05:36,223 --> 01:05:38,558
Please. Hey!

1165
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:40,936
Hey. Hey.

1166
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:42,812
Please, get me--

1167
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:44,356
Oh, my God.

1168
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:46,608
Sniper!

1169
01:06:12,343 --> 01:06:14,010
Scott.

1170
01:06:15,721 --> 01:06:19,182
They're not gonna let us out
of here alive, are they?

1171
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:20,934
No.

1172
01:06:21,852 --> 01:06:23,853
I don't think so.

1173
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:29,776
- There might be a way out.
- What?

1174
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:33,321
Jake, there might be a way out.

1175
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:39,369
How? How do we get out of here?

1176
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,337
Listen, Jake.

1177
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:53,341
There is a drain cover in the basement
that joins up with the sewers.

1178
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:57,470
- We need the key, we need the key.
- The keys are in our apartment.

1179
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,315
Come with us.

1180
01:07:09,483 --> 01:07:12,110
Come with us!
You have to come with us!

1181
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:14,529
I won't leave him. I can't leave him.

1182
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:16,823
Leave him aIone.

1183
01:07:19,493 --> 01:07:22,162
Oh, my God!

1184
01:07:22,329 --> 01:07:24,789
We have to get out of here!

Okay, so this place was locked up.
