1
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,293
Good morning, Jack.

2
00:03:00,591 --> 00:03:01,736
Hey, Kathleen.

3
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:04,684
Morning, hon.

4
00:03:04,943 --> 00:03:06,732
New neighbors moving in, huh?

5
00:03:07,215 --> 00:03:08,197
I reckon.

6
00:03:08,431 --> 00:03:09,740
Have you met them?

7
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:11,818
No, not yet.

8
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,541
Are we still on for tomorrow morning?

9
00:03:13,648 --> 00:03:15,786
- Of course.
- You wear a hat.

10
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,923
'Cause I want to keep
that hot head of yours cool.

11
00:03:19,888 --> 00:03:20,903
Okay.

12
00:03:45,553 --> 00:03:47,408
Hey, man, thank you so much.

13
00:03:47,665 --> 00:03:50,250
- No problem. Are you the new owner?
- Yes. I am.

14
00:03:50,353 --> 00:03:53,102
Welcome to the neighborhood.
I'm Robbie Levinson. I live next door.

15
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,477
Okay, Chris Boyd.

16
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,359
You need any help unloading?

17
00:03:56,465 --> 00:03:58,505
Oh, no. That's all right.
I got some help coming.

18
00:03:58,608 --> 00:03:59,885
- You sure?
- Mmm-hmm.

19
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:02,445
Okay, well, if you change your mind,
I'm right over here.

20
00:04:02,544 --> 00:04:05,065
- I appreciate it. It was nice to meet you.
- You, too.

21
00:04:05,168 --> 00:04:06,096
God bless.

22
00:04:20,626 --> 00:04:22,251
Are you gonna get out of bed?

23
00:04:23,025 --> 00:04:24,170
What time is it?

24
00:04:24,273 --> 00:04:25,800
It's time to get up.

25
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,534
I have to buy a new housewarming present.

26
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:56,938
For who?

27
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,985
- New neighbor's moving in.
- When?

28
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,321
Right now. I just met him.

29
00:05:03,186 --> 00:05:04,364
What's he like?

30
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:06,508
Seems nice.

31
00:05:07,763 --> 00:05:09,039
You could close this.

32
00:05:09,138 --> 00:05:10,250
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

33
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:16,907
Why am I doing this again?

34
00:05:17,203 --> 00:05:18,796
Because you owe me.

35
00:05:18,963 --> 00:05:21,002
You're gonna owe me after this one.

36
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:24,999
Howdy.

37
00:05:25,106 --> 00:05:26,284
Hey, man.

38
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:29,201
Why don't you hop up?
Let's get this thing unloaded.

39
00:05:29,298 --> 00:05:30,443
All right.

40
00:05:34,611 --> 00:05:35,723
Trey!

41
00:05:38,355 --> 00:05:41,322
Sorry. Must be a little too excited.

42
00:05:41,971 --> 00:05:43,760
I'm getting married, you know.

43
00:05:43,859 --> 00:05:46,193
- Yeah, I heard.
- See you after work.

44
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,680
Wait. I thought we were having lunch today.

45
00:05:49,107 --> 00:05:52,456
Oh, you're right. Like I said,
see you at noon, at the diner.

46
00:05:57,139 --> 00:05:58,666
Alton, come on, man!

47
00:05:58,771 --> 00:05:59,786
Trey!

48
00:06:01,907 --> 00:06:03,434
Dude, you see that?

49
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,394
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

50
00:06:24,052 --> 00:06:25,678
Everywhere you go.

51
00:06:28,084 --> 00:06:30,091
Sure you don't need an extra hand?

52
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:40,244
Open it.

53
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,991
Let me see what my
hard-earned money's got me.

54
00:06:43,892 --> 00:06:44,820
Ohhh.

55
00:06:45,621 --> 00:06:47,409
Well, it took long enough to get here.

56
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:51,345
Make it official, get it framed, so I can retire.

57
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:55,185
Yeah right, like that'll happen.
You'd drive yourself crazy.

58
00:06:55,285 --> 00:06:56,943
Not to mention Mom.

59
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:01,684
- You got it?
- Yeah, yeah. Hey, could I get a clamp?

60
00:07:02,805 --> 00:07:04,431
- Clamp.
- Thank you.

61
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:07,533
I can't believe we've had so many cats
to spay this week.

62
00:07:09,269 --> 00:07:10,829
- Get the scissors?
- Oh, yeah.

63
00:07:10,933 --> 00:07:12,340
Jim, what are you looking for?

64
00:07:12,437 --> 00:07:13,582
Nothing.

65
00:07:13,813 --> 00:07:15,723
I can help you. I know where everything is.

66
00:07:15,829 --> 00:07:17,007
I've got it.

67
00:07:17,461 --> 00:07:19,087
Okay, okay.

68
00:07:19,445 --> 00:07:20,655
- Beautiful.
- Yes.

69
00:07:20,757 --> 00:07:22,098
Where are the Rascos?

70
00:07:22,197 --> 00:07:24,499
On the shelf in front of you. See them?

71
00:07:27,318 --> 00:07:28,495
Stubborn.

72
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,059
- Big news there.
- Yeah.

73
00:07:30,165 --> 00:07:31,791
So are you, though.

74
00:07:32,214 --> 00:07:34,254
- What?
- Stubborn.

75
00:07:34,357 --> 00:07:35,601
I am not.

76
00:07:36,341 --> 00:07:37,836
All right, all right, I am sometimes.

77
00:07:37,941 --> 00:07:40,527
But I have an excuse.
I've always been that way.

78
00:07:42,422 --> 00:07:44,211
He's changing.
I don't know what's going on.

79
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:46,448
Of course he's changing, Mom.
He's getting old.

80
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,924
Watch your mouth.

81
00:07:49,078 --> 00:07:50,769
Maybe you should go on a date.

82
00:07:51,574 --> 00:07:52,949
Got someone in mind?

83
00:07:53,334 --> 00:07:56,084
You two should get out of the house
and talk to each other.

84
00:07:56,182 --> 00:07:58,549
Yeah, well, he's not much
of a conversationalist.

85
00:07:58,742 --> 00:08:01,044
He has that group, you know,
that he talks to,

86
00:08:01,142 --> 00:08:03,564
so... Whatever.

87
00:08:04,118 --> 00:08:07,184
Of course, it would help
if we had something to talk about.

88
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:08,301
Like?

89
00:08:09,174 --> 00:08:12,818
Like, I don't know... a child, maybe.

90
00:08:13,174 --> 00:08:14,898
- Or something.
- Or something.

91
00:08:16,535 --> 00:08:18,226
I could donate an egg.

92
00:08:22,071 --> 00:08:23,380
I was only kidding.

93
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:25,617
Thank you. Please, no eggs, no eggs.

94
00:08:25,846 --> 00:08:28,050
Mom brought up grandkids again today.

95
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:30,064
She is relentless.

96
00:08:39,703 --> 00:08:41,645
We should... We should look into it.

97
00:08:42,423 --> 00:08:43,667
Seriously?

98
00:08:43,863 --> 00:08:45,270
Why not?

99
00:08:45,367 --> 00:08:47,538
Now we're gonna be legit and all.

100
00:08:51,255 --> 00:08:53,394
Let's worry about one thing at a time.

101
00:08:57,975 --> 00:08:59,251
You want a baby?

102
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,138
You want a baby, don't you?

103
00:09:15,704 --> 00:09:17,843
"When Isaac
was a young boy,

104
00:09:18,135 --> 00:09:20,241
"God commanded Abraham

105
00:09:20,407 --> 00:09:22,960
"to take his son up to Mount Moriah

106
00:09:23,192 --> 00:09:25,647
"and offer him up as a sacrifice to God."

107
00:09:26,968 --> 00:09:31,311
Now, the reason he did that
was he wanted to test Abraham's faith.

108
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,542
You're late.

109
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,439
Excuse me, children.

110
00:09:38,585 --> 00:09:40,886
You think you can try
and be here on time?

111
00:09:40,984 --> 00:09:43,318
I mean, everything we do
sets an example for these children.

112
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,911
I'm sorry.

113
00:09:45,016 --> 00:09:47,121
Children, Christopher's going
to finish the story.

114
00:09:47,225 --> 00:09:50,072
I have to go work on my sermon.
I'll see you later.

115
00:09:50,488 --> 00:09:51,536
Bye.

116
00:09:54,168 --> 00:09:56,208
"This was a test of Abraham's faith.

117
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,868
"Abraham loved his son,
but he didn't hesitate

118
00:09:58,968 --> 00:10:00,495
"to do what he was told,

119
00:10:00,665 --> 00:10:02,770
"for his faith in God was strong."

120
00:10:03,577 --> 00:10:06,392
- Didn't wear a hat, did you?
- I got sunscreen on.

121
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:08,144
Okay.

122
00:10:09,017 --> 00:10:11,864
Hey, how old were you
when you got married?

123
00:10:14,073 --> 00:10:15,960
Sixteen big ones.

124
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:19,668
- Barely old enough to wipe my own ass.
- Really?

125
00:10:20,345 --> 00:10:22,931
Well, I had to,

126
00:10:23,993 --> 00:10:26,328
otherwise Charlie would have been a bastard.

127
00:10:27,898 --> 00:10:30,996
He still turned out to be a bastard,
just a different kind.

128
00:10:31,705 --> 00:10:33,680
- Will you hand me the shovel?
- Oh, sure.

129
00:10:33,785 --> 00:10:35,029
Thank you.

130
00:10:35,162 --> 00:10:37,267
So, you had a shotgun wedding.

131
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,407
Yeah, I guess I did!

132
00:10:41,754 --> 00:10:43,991
Didn't have much of a choice back then.

133
00:10:45,753 --> 00:10:48,437
How come you asking me
so many personal questions?

134
00:10:48,794 --> 00:10:50,703
Don't tell me you got a girl.

135
00:10:51,578 --> 00:10:52,560
Sorry.

136
00:10:55,642 --> 00:10:58,872
Trey convinced me to have
a commitment ceremony.

137
00:10:59,194 --> 00:11:00,306
A what?

138
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:03,033
It's like a wedding. Only not legal.

139
00:11:04,826 --> 00:11:06,736
Well, what do you need that for?

140
00:11:06,907 --> 00:11:08,433
Yeah, my point exactly.

141
00:11:09,691 --> 00:11:12,025
Well, you kids.

142
00:11:12,763 --> 00:11:15,064
I don't know, but whatever it is,

143
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,264
you just count me in.

144
00:11:19,643 --> 00:11:21,912
- I like that one.
- Which one?

145
00:11:22,234 --> 00:11:23,412
- That one.
- No.

146
00:11:23,898 --> 00:11:25,175
It's too gaudy.

147
00:11:25,274 --> 00:11:27,641
Come on, we agreed on something
more simple.

148
00:11:27,738 --> 00:11:30,608
Okay, pick one. I'm happy if you're happy.

149
00:11:31,547 --> 00:11:34,394
Okay, can we see the one
in the corner, please?

150
00:11:34,491 --> 00:11:35,898
Sure, absolutely.

151
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,264
We can always order something from
our catalog, as well.

152
00:11:38,363 --> 00:11:39,508
Okay.

153
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:43,061
Thanks.

154
00:11:45,691 --> 00:11:47,862
Are you two having a wedding?

155
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,188
God forbid, don't call it a wedding.

156
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,462
It's just a small ceremony.

157
00:11:53,563 --> 00:11:55,418
I love that, I think that's so cool.

158
00:11:55,516 --> 00:11:58,777
When two people... Yeah.

159
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:00,978
Congratulations.

160
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,985
Six years and I finally get this guy to commit.

161
00:12:06,747 --> 00:12:07,827
This is the one.

162
00:12:08,348 --> 00:12:10,682
Sammy was telling pretty good jokes today.

163
00:12:12,284 --> 00:12:15,251
What do you call 100 faggots
at the bottom of the ocean?

164
00:12:15,548 --> 00:12:16,889
A good start.

165
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,020
How do you save a faggot from drowning?

166
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:27,383
Take your foot off his head. Oh, shit.

167
00:12:28,317 --> 00:12:29,910
Come on, man, what's up?

168
00:12:31,676 --> 00:12:33,913
You just shut the fuck up, all right?

169
00:12:35,037 --> 00:12:37,011
- What's your problem?
- Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

170
00:12:37,116 --> 00:12:38,643
I don't like to hear the word "faggot."

171
00:12:38,748 --> 00:12:40,723
- All right? It makes me sick to my stomach.
- Well, you tell him.

172
00:12:40,828 --> 00:12:42,072
Makes me want to fucking puke,

173
00:12:42,172 --> 00:12:44,277
- so just shut up.
- Jesus Christ!

174
00:12:46,045 --> 00:12:48,347
Those fucking guys living next door.

175
00:12:50,204 --> 00:12:52,790
You know, we could always
do something about it.

176
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:55,766
Yeah, I'm gonna do something.

177
00:13:00,156 --> 00:13:01,651
All right, then.

178
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,075
Good one, Connor.

179
00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:10,588
You see the difference in the follow-through?

180
00:13:10,685 --> 00:13:12,092
Yeah, I guess.

181
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:14,332
You'll get it.

182
00:13:14,621 --> 00:13:16,214
Let's go in. I'm hungry.

183
00:14:17,183 --> 00:14:18,492
Come on, sweetie.

184
00:14:27,006 --> 00:14:28,828
Oh, hey.

185
00:14:29,823 --> 00:14:30,750
Phoebe!

186
00:14:31,743 --> 00:14:32,725
Sorry about that.

187
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:34,325
She's really a sweet dog
once she gets to know you.

188
00:14:34,431 --> 00:14:36,155
You're going to hell.

189
00:14:36,671 --> 00:14:38,296
You know that, don't you?

190
00:14:39,711 --> 00:14:43,770
Christ didn't die for your sins
so you could go off and do perverted shit.

191
00:14:44,831 --> 00:14:46,009
I'm Jewish.

192
00:14:46,111 --> 00:14:47,998
You just watch your back.

193
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,108
Are you threatening me?

194
00:14:53,472 --> 00:14:55,414
Just read the Bible.

195
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:58,101
Go get yourself some God,
that's all I'm saying.

196
00:14:58,207 --> 00:14:59,734
That's all you're saying.

197
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,810
Come on, girl.

198
00:15:09,536 --> 00:15:10,551
Who was that?

199
00:15:10,656 --> 00:15:12,183
You don't want to know.

200
00:15:13,408 --> 00:15:15,775
Look at me. You been drinking?

201
00:15:16,384 --> 00:15:19,002
My next door neighbors
are a couple of faggots.

202
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,364
How do you like that, Pastor?

203
00:15:31,968 --> 00:15:33,878
No! Back the other way!

204
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,404
Come here. Come here, you, come here.

205
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:43,063
Hey, sis.

206
00:15:43,168 --> 00:15:45,503
Hey. Time to go, bud.

207
00:15:46,592 --> 00:15:48,021
So, how was shopping?

208
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:52,023
Well, we ordered the rings,
if that's what you mean.

209
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,622
Guess you can't back out now.

210
00:15:53,729 --> 00:15:56,412
Yeah, just hope I don't puke
in front of everyone.

211
00:15:56,705 --> 00:16:00,698
Hey, game tomorrow.
Don't forget your hat this time, huh?

212
00:16:01,057 --> 00:16:02,169
I won't.

213
00:16:02,465 --> 00:16:03,675
I'll make sure.

214
00:16:04,225 --> 00:16:06,167
Bye, Uncle Trey. Bye, Uncle Robbie.

215
00:16:06,273 --> 00:16:08,510
- Thanks.
- Bye-bye.

216
00:16:09,249 --> 00:16:11,671
Hey, so what was bothering you before?

217
00:16:12,609 --> 00:16:14,649
Well, I ran into our new neighbor.

218
00:16:15,073 --> 00:16:17,495
Apparently, he's got a problem with the gays.

219
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:18,721
Yeah?

220
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:22,551
At least we can forget the housewarming gift.

221
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:38,078
Let's have a baby.

222
00:16:39,522 --> 00:16:41,497
If only it were that simple.

223
00:16:43,074 --> 00:16:44,798
It could be fun trying.

224
00:16:48,578 --> 00:16:50,269
I'll make you a deal.

225
00:16:50,882 --> 00:16:51,897
Okay.

226
00:17:00,707 --> 00:17:04,733
Let's get all this wedding stuff
out of the way first, okay.

227
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:08,058
And then we can talk about having kids.

228
00:17:08,162 --> 00:17:09,373
But...

229
00:17:11,203 --> 00:17:13,308
Only after taking a parenting class.

230
00:17:15,363 --> 00:17:18,560
What? A parenting class?

231
00:17:18,723 --> 00:17:20,795
Yeah, I want to make sure we do things right,

232
00:17:20,899 --> 00:17:22,208
for the right reasons.

233
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:24,860
Robbie, you don't always have to do
everything by the book.

234
00:17:24,963 --> 00:17:27,549
- All I'm asking is that we...
- Okay, okay, okay.

235
00:17:27,971 --> 00:17:29,432
Okay, I'll do it.

236
00:17:31,234 --> 00:17:32,314
You will?

237
00:17:35,107 --> 00:17:36,514
Whatever it takes.

238
00:18:47,813 --> 00:18:49,820
Oh, hi, I'm Chris.

239
00:18:51,076 --> 00:18:53,727
Hi. I know who you are.

240
00:18:54,437 --> 00:18:55,931
I know all about you.

241
00:18:56,613 --> 00:18:57,823
What do you want?

242
00:18:57,925 --> 00:18:59,452
I was just bringing by
something from my church...

243
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:00,702
What do you got there?

244
00:19:00,805 --> 00:19:02,366
It's from my church.

245
00:19:02,981 --> 00:19:05,370
Oh. You a church pusher?

246
00:19:06,117 --> 00:19:07,940
No, ma'am, I'm...

247
00:19:08,453 --> 00:19:10,078
I already go to church.

248
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:13,981
"Judge not, and ye shall not be judged,"

249
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:16,226
thou hypocrite.

250
00:19:17,765 --> 00:19:19,904
I don't want none of your horseshit.

251
00:19:20,901 --> 00:19:23,040
All right. I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am.

252
00:19:23,142 --> 00:19:24,516
Just a minute.

253
00:19:24,741 --> 00:19:26,847
You listen to me, altar boy.

254
00:19:27,653 --> 00:19:29,475
You best leave all us alone.

255
00:19:29,829 --> 00:19:32,001
And let me tell you one thing, too.

256
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:36,187
You mess with my boys over here
and you are messing with me,

257
00:19:36,293 --> 00:19:40,571
and believe you me,
you do not wanna mess with me.

258
00:19:42,342 --> 00:19:43,935
I may be a girl,

259
00:19:44,134 --> 00:19:46,817
but I ain't stupid and I ain't afraid.

260
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,376
And I got my eye on you.

261
00:19:51,622 --> 00:19:52,800
You can go now.

262
00:19:53,894 --> 00:19:56,578
Get your little fanny back to Sunday school.

263
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,866
It's nice having you here.

264
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:08,102
When you get married and have children
of your own,

265
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:10,534
you'll understand what I'm talking about.

266
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,582
Speaking of that,

267
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,462
you haven't said anything about Katelyn
in a while.

268
00:21:16,424 --> 00:21:19,141
How's she doing?
Does she like graduate school?

269
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,517
I wouldn't know.

270
00:21:22,184 --> 00:21:23,973
What's that supposed to mean?

271
00:21:24,488 --> 00:21:27,041
It means I wouldn't know. We broke up.

272
00:21:27,368 --> 00:21:30,238
- What happened?
- What did you do to that girl?

273
00:21:30,632 --> 00:21:32,868
Get on the phone right now
and apologize to her.

274
00:21:32,968 --> 00:21:34,943
I didn't do anything. It was two months ago.

275
00:21:35,048 --> 00:21:37,220
And you're just getting around
to telling us now?

276
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,400
Yeah.

277
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:41,863
- You sure made me look like a damn fool.
- How?

278
00:21:42,089 --> 00:21:46,050
I told Pastor Phillips that she was gonna be
our daughter-in-law, that's how.

279
00:21:46,152 --> 00:21:47,647
I never said anything.

280
00:21:49,161 --> 00:21:50,306
What is wrong with you, son?

281
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:51,586
Pastor, please, let's just...

282
00:21:51,689 --> 00:21:54,275
No, he takes a lot of pleasure
in disappointing me.

283
00:21:54,376 --> 00:21:55,304
He does.

284
00:21:55,401 --> 00:21:57,288
We just thought you two were getting
along so well...

285
00:21:57,385 --> 00:21:59,207
Mother! It's none of your business.

286
00:21:59,305 --> 00:22:01,476
Hey, don't you smart talk
your mother like that.

287
00:22:01,577 --> 00:22:03,006
- May I be excused?
- No!

288
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,390
Chris, please, Chris.

289
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:07,555
Hey, wait a minute, come here.
We're not finished talking.

290
00:22:11,689 --> 00:22:14,985
<i>A common misconception</i>
<i>about becoming a Christ follower,</i>

291
00:22:15,081 --> 00:22:16,707
<i>I hear this all the time.</i>

292
00:22:16,906 --> 00:22:20,135
<i>People see a contradiction in a God of mercy</i>

293
00:22:20,553 --> 00:22:22,113
<i>sending his people to hell.</i>

294
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:26,112
<i>Well, God does not send us to hell.</i>
<i>We are already on the way there.</i>

295
00:22:26,217 --> 00:22:28,803
<i>We were born sinners. God is...</i>

296
00:22:44,266 --> 00:22:45,640
Who's Vince Morgan?

297
00:22:52,906 --> 00:22:54,368
I just stopped by his office.

298
00:22:54,474 --> 00:22:55,751
You met with him?

299
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,596
All I did was ask some questions. That's it.

300
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:02,248
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I was going to.

301
00:23:02,731 --> 00:23:03,876
It's no big deal.

302
00:23:03,978 --> 00:23:05,866
Trey, you went to an adoption agency
without me,

303
00:23:05,963 --> 00:23:08,134
without even telling me. That's a big deal.

304
00:23:08,235 --> 00:23:11,104
A customer came by and gave me his card.

305
00:23:11,211 --> 00:23:12,585
I went and talked to him.

306
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:13,795
You're always doing this.

307
00:23:13,899 --> 00:23:15,906
Okay, okay, okay, I'm sorry, okay?

308
00:23:16,107 --> 00:23:17,284
We had an agreement.

309
00:23:17,387 --> 00:23:19,624
You're right. I shouldn't have done it.

310
00:23:19,851 --> 00:23:22,120
I'd at least think you'd want me there. Just...

311
00:23:22,219 --> 00:23:25,896
Robbie, I said I was sorry, okay?

312
00:23:26,731 --> 00:23:29,186
I was wrong once again. Can we drop it?

313
00:23:36,043 --> 00:23:38,148
- Hello.
- <i>Yeah, is Robbie there?</i>

314
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:39,179
Just a second.

315
00:23:42,731 --> 00:23:44,008
This is Robbie.

316
00:23:45,515 --> 00:23:48,679
God, I completely forgot.
Let me just get to my computer.

317
00:23:49,131 --> 00:23:51,433
I'll take her. Come here.

318
00:24:22,636 --> 00:24:25,254
Yeah, you can still fund a SEP.

319
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:29,921
Actually, you have until you file the return.

320
00:24:30,445 --> 00:24:33,674
Look, you want to see what kind
of difference that would make?

321
00:24:34,445 --> 00:24:36,933
Oh, boy. That's good. We'll do it again.

322
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,548
Give me kisses, give me kisses.

323
00:24:43,308 --> 00:24:44,999
Take it! Go take it.

324
00:24:48,044 --> 00:24:50,946
Where is it? No stick, no kiss.

325
00:24:51,117 --> 00:24:54,183
I can save you $800. Okay.

326
00:24:54,797 --> 00:24:59,172
Well, if you want,
you could pick it up next week.

327
00:25:03,597 --> 00:25:05,899
What is it, Pheebs? A squirrel?

328
00:25:07,501 --> 00:25:08,646
A squirrel?

329
00:25:24,014 --> 00:25:25,192
This is Robbie.

330
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:26,503
Hey, can you talk?

331
00:25:27,565 --> 00:25:28,678
What's wrong?

332
00:25:28,846 --> 00:25:30,023
Nothing.

333
00:25:30,701 --> 00:25:31,912
<i>I just had a thought.</i>

334
00:25:32,013 --> 00:25:33,475
Hold on one sec.

335
00:25:34,318 --> 00:25:35,267
Hello?

336
00:25:35,374 --> 00:25:36,356
<i>Listen, I need a favor.</i>

337
00:25:36,462 --> 00:25:38,567
<i>I need to know if you can watch Connor</i>
<i>this weekend.</i>

338
00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:40,131
I thought Dan was coming up to get him.

339
00:25:40,237 --> 00:25:42,409
<i>Well, now he's not, apparently.</i>

340
00:25:47,566 --> 00:25:49,420
<i>...this Houston conference...</i>

341
00:25:49,518 --> 00:25:51,755
Stella, Stella, it's fine.

342
00:25:51,855 --> 00:25:53,611
When has anything like this
ever been a problem?

343
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,085
- <i>You sure?</i>
- Yeah.

344
00:25:55,374 --> 00:25:56,749
- Yeah, bring him up.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

345
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:58,602
Okay. All right, bye.

346
00:26:01,006 --> 00:26:02,435
Hey, you still there?

347
00:26:03,534 --> 00:26:04,461
Hello?

348
00:26:05,422 --> 00:26:06,350
Trey.

349
00:26:08,046 --> 00:26:09,061
Call back.

350
00:27:02,128 --> 00:27:04,168
Hey, sweetie. Hey.

351
00:27:04,304 --> 00:27:06,060
Hey, honey. How you doing?

352
00:27:12,624 --> 00:27:14,446
Trey?

353
00:27:16,592 --> 00:27:17,519
Trey!

354
00:27:22,576 --> 00:27:23,689
Trey!

355
00:27:39,984 --> 00:27:40,999
Trey?

356
00:27:44,784 --> 00:27:48,167
Oh, God. Oh, my God. What happened?

357
00:27:50,192 --> 00:27:51,370
What happened?

358
00:27:57,073 --> 00:27:58,000
Trey!

359
00:27:59,184 --> 00:28:00,112
Trey!

360
00:28:12,145 --> 00:28:14,284
Hello? I need an ambulance.

361
00:28:31,825 --> 00:28:34,673
- Clamp it there.
- There you go.

362
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:45,002
I'm Jim and I'm an alcoholic.

363
00:28:46,034 --> 00:28:47,757
I want to welcome Mike to the group.

364
00:28:47,858 --> 00:28:49,068
Hi, Mike.

365
00:28:50,322 --> 00:28:52,264
Mike, you, uh... You pretty much just told...

366
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:54,923
Jim. Let's go.

367
00:28:55,026 --> 00:28:56,651
- Why?
- Come on, let's go.

368
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:02,760
There wasn't anybody at the park
when you found him?

369
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:03,815
No.

370
00:29:04,915 --> 00:29:07,598
Can you think of anybody
who might have done this?

371
00:29:08,051 --> 00:29:09,163
My neighbor.

372
00:29:09,459 --> 00:29:10,768
Your neighbor?

373
00:29:10,867 --> 00:29:13,518
Chris. Boyd.

374
00:29:14,482 --> 00:29:16,206
He moved in a few weeks ago.

375
00:29:54,068 --> 00:29:56,588
Trey McCoy's family? It's fine.

376
00:29:58,164 --> 00:30:00,881
He's very critical. He's in a coma.

377
00:30:02,835 --> 00:30:05,738
Now, there's a possibility his back
may be broken,

378
00:30:05,876 --> 00:30:09,171
but we won't know for sure
until we're finished with his X-rays.

379
00:30:09,268 --> 00:30:13,229
What concerns us most right now
are the head injuries that he's received.

380
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:15,665
He has a large fracture on the back
of his skull

381
00:30:15,764 --> 00:30:18,251
that's causing fluid to build up on his brain.

382
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:22,857
Now, we're optimistic that the pressure
from this fluid will subside soon,

383
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,188
but until then, we just have to wait and see.

384
00:30:27,956 --> 00:30:29,898
- I want to see him.
- Of course.

385
00:30:41,492 --> 00:30:42,507
What?

386
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:44,654
Where were you last night?

387
00:30:47,157 --> 00:30:48,139
Why?

388
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:50,860
You still asleep, man?

389
00:30:50,965 --> 00:30:52,045
I was.

390
00:30:52,565 --> 00:30:54,637
<i>I tried calling you last night.</i>
<i>Where were you?</i>

391
00:30:54,741 --> 00:30:55,985
I was out.

392
00:30:57,013 --> 00:30:59,152
<i>So? Well, didn't you check your machine?</i>

393
00:30:59,253 --> 00:31:00,660
No, I got in late.

394
00:31:02,133 --> 00:31:03,278
Mmm-hmm.

395
00:31:22,421 --> 00:31:23,828
- Let's go. This way.
- Yeah.

396
00:31:26,197 --> 00:31:27,375
Mr. Boyd?

397
00:31:29,622 --> 00:31:30,964
Nobody here.

398
00:31:47,478 --> 00:31:49,169
Howdy. What can I do for you?

399
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,791
Pastor, I'm Detective Fisher.
This is Detective Loy.

400
00:31:51,894 --> 00:31:54,098
We're looking for your son Christopher.

401
00:31:54,198 --> 00:31:56,434
A woman detective. That's nice to see.

402
00:31:57,111 --> 00:31:58,671
Do you know where he is?

403
00:31:58,775 --> 00:31:59,920
What is this about?

404
00:32:00,022 --> 00:32:01,932
One of his neighbors was attacked last night

405
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:03,926
and we want to ask him some questions.

406
00:32:04,023 --> 00:32:05,266
Come on in.

407
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:06,708
Thank you.

408
00:32:07,415 --> 00:32:10,731
Martha, you want to get this nice young lady
and her friend something to drink?

409
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:13,806
Oh, please don't.
That's quite all right, ma'am.

410
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:18,573
Pastor, did you see your son at all
last night between 8:00 and 9:00?

411
00:32:18,743 --> 00:32:22,289
Well, why don't you ask him yourself?
Martha, go get Chris, would you?

412
00:32:22,391 --> 00:32:23,951
- He's here?
- Yeah.

413
00:32:24,727 --> 00:32:26,865
You're thinking this might have
something to do with him?

414
00:32:26,967 --> 00:32:27,982
No, sir.

415
00:32:28,087 --> 00:32:30,160
That's what we're trying to find out.

416
00:32:30,263 --> 00:32:31,954
He's a possible witness.

417
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:33,494
My boy, Chris.

418
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:37,581
Mr. Boyd, we'd like to speak with you.

419
00:32:37,688 --> 00:32:41,233
Well, he'll tell you he was with me
till about what, 10:00 last night?

420
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:42,644
Thank you, Pastor.

421
00:32:42,936 --> 00:32:46,002
I'd like to speak to your son alone,
if you don't mind.

422
00:32:46,584 --> 00:32:49,617
I got here about 5:00 or 5:30.

423
00:32:51,031 --> 00:32:52,493
How long were you here?

424
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:55,054
Well, I told you he was here till after 10:00.

425
00:32:58,263 --> 00:32:59,605
Where did he go?

426
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,814
Home.

427
00:33:01,176 --> 00:33:03,794
Did you leave here at all
between 5:00 and 10:00?

428
00:33:03,896 --> 00:33:05,074
No, ma'am.

429
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,214
How about when you got home,

430
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,964
did you notice anything suspicious
in the neighborhood?

431
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,041
Mr. Boyd?

432
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:15,729
I didn't notice anything, no.

433
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:20,945
When was the last time that you saw
either one of your neighbors,

434
00:33:21,048 --> 00:33:22,957
Mr. McCoy or Mr. Levinson?

435
00:33:23,608 --> 00:33:25,845
I don't know. A couple of days ago?

436
00:33:26,649 --> 00:33:29,398
Ever have any arguments,

437
00:33:29,592 --> 00:33:31,315
conflicts, that sort of thing?

438
00:33:31,416 --> 00:33:32,725
With my neighbors?

439
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,383
Yes.

440
00:33:34,617 --> 00:33:37,202
No, like I said, I just moved in

441
00:33:37,305 --> 00:33:38,581
a couple of weeks ago.

442
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,207
I don't even know them.

443
00:33:47,672 --> 00:33:50,574
Robbie Levinson? I'm Detective Fisher.

444
00:33:52,985 --> 00:33:55,440
- How's he doing?
- Not good.

445
00:33:56,185 --> 00:33:57,876
Is my neighbor in jail yet?

446
00:33:58,009 --> 00:33:59,187
No. He's not.

447
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:00,434
Why not?

448
00:34:00,633 --> 00:34:03,284
We don't have enough evidence
to arrest anybody yet.

449
00:34:03,386 --> 00:34:05,360
Look, I'm telling you, he did it.

450
00:34:06,553 --> 00:34:08,048
He has an alibi.

451
00:34:08,282 --> 00:34:09,459
An alibi?

452
00:34:09,977 --> 00:34:11,286
His parents.

453
00:34:13,786 --> 00:34:15,247
And you believe him?

454
00:34:15,354 --> 00:34:17,743
We really don't have a choice at this point.

455
00:34:18,361 --> 00:34:20,816
You told the responding officer
that he had threatened you.

456
00:34:20,921 --> 00:34:23,888
Did he specifically threaten you
with bodily harm?

457
00:34:26,073 --> 00:34:27,764
Not specifically, no.

458
00:34:28,346 --> 00:34:29,393
What did he say?

459
00:34:29,498 --> 00:34:32,313
He spouted off a bunch of crap
about Jesus and God.

460
00:34:32,474 --> 00:34:34,962
He said I was going to hell.
He's a homophobe.

461
00:34:35,225 --> 00:34:36,371
I know.

462
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:38,864
God, he was pissed when he found out
about us.

463
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:40,082
How so?

464
00:34:40,314 --> 00:34:41,525
He just was.

465
00:34:41,882 --> 00:34:43,508
What do you mean you know?

466
00:34:43,642 --> 00:34:44,886
Know what?

467
00:34:45,498 --> 00:34:48,345
I said he was a homophobe,
and you said you knew.

468
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:51,185
We found an arrest on his record.

469
00:34:52,122 --> 00:34:53,366
An arrest?

470
00:34:54,267 --> 00:34:58,642
A few years ago he and a friend of his
were caught vandalizing a man's home.

471
00:35:01,722 --> 00:35:02,770
A gay man?

472
00:35:04,026 --> 00:35:04,954
Yes.

473
00:35:06,075 --> 00:35:09,009
He said that they had been harassing him
for weeks.

474
00:35:09,147 --> 00:35:11,285
Hmm, and what happened?

475
00:35:11,866 --> 00:35:13,143
The charges were dropped.

476
00:35:16,091 --> 00:35:18,328
Come on, that's got to prove something.

477
00:35:19,515 --> 00:35:20,944
He's a suspect.

478
00:35:23,067 --> 00:35:23,995
Okay.

479
00:35:24,955 --> 00:35:27,257
Well, the doctor said there's a chance

480
00:35:27,355 --> 00:35:30,552
that Trey will remember what happened
when he wakes up, so...

481
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:52,341
I brought you a sandwich.

482
00:35:55,067 --> 00:35:58,679
Oh, Jim. I just...

483
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:05,937
I'm not hungry. Thanks.

484
00:36:18,588 --> 00:36:21,141
I knew that piece of shit
was gonna be trouble.

485
00:36:25,084 --> 00:36:27,223
You think he attacked Mr. McCoy?

486
00:36:27,325 --> 00:36:29,048
Oh, you're damn right I do.

487
00:36:29,692 --> 00:36:30,903
May I sit?

488
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:35,099
You're in charge.

489
00:36:39,516 --> 00:36:41,785
He says he wasn't around here that night.

490
00:36:42,589 --> 00:36:43,799
That's horseshit.

491
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:45,527
I'm sorry. What do you mean?

492
00:36:45,629 --> 00:36:47,734
I mean horseshit. I saw him.

493
00:36:47,964 --> 00:36:49,459
You saw him?

494
00:36:49,565 --> 00:36:51,191
What did I just say?

495
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,536
What time?

496
00:36:53,885 --> 00:36:55,292
It was after <i>Dr. Phil.</i>

497
00:36:56,509 --> 00:36:58,297
You're gonna have to help me.

498
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:01,716
<i>Dr. Phil</i> is over at 7:00. Where you been?

499
00:37:03,069 --> 00:37:04,563
Where did you see him?

500
00:37:05,053 --> 00:37:08,631
I went out to turn off my sprinklers
and I seen him come up the road.

501
00:37:09,118 --> 00:37:11,157
Did you see him after that?

502
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,588
No. He must have left.

503
00:37:14,589 --> 00:37:16,662
- Do you know when?
- No, I don't know when.

504
00:37:16,765 --> 00:37:19,416
I don't know,
it was sometime after he showed up.

505
00:37:23,293 --> 00:37:25,432
You gonna let him get away with this?

506
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:28,338
No.

507
00:37:30,045 --> 00:37:31,387
It's Trey and Robbie.

508
00:37:33,758 --> 00:37:35,285
They're like my boys.

509
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,779
You have a close relationship with them?

510
00:37:39,806 --> 00:37:42,555
Lady, you have kids?

511
00:37:44,606 --> 00:37:45,718
I have one.

512
00:37:45,822 --> 00:37:48,637
And you don't know that I would do
anything for them?

513
00:37:57,854 --> 00:37:59,447
Hey.

514
00:38:01,503 --> 00:38:03,390
Hey, honey.

515
00:38:04,958 --> 00:38:07,227
I'm sorry that I've been such an ass

516
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:09,116
about the whole wedding thing.

517
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:11,707
I don't know what's the matter with me.

518
00:38:12,894 --> 00:38:14,716
I know it's important to you.

519
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,388
I know.

520
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:24,477
And you know what?

521
00:38:27,391 --> 00:38:29,399
I do want to start a family.

522
00:38:35,807 --> 00:38:38,491
And I swear that I won't be so uptight
from now on.

523
00:38:40,543 --> 00:38:43,358
That alone should be worth
waking up for, right?

524
00:38:52,704 --> 00:38:54,711
For those of you who don't know,

525
00:38:54,816 --> 00:38:59,158
Trey McCoy was attacked a few days ago
and is recovering in hospital.

526
00:39:00,384 --> 00:39:02,457
I've spoken to his dad

527
00:39:02,976 --> 00:39:04,764
and he wants you all to know how much

528
00:39:04,864 --> 00:39:07,711
he and his family greatly appreciate
the support

529
00:39:07,808 --> 00:39:09,783
they've received from all of you.

530
00:39:10,144 --> 00:39:11,670
<i>I would ask that you continue</i>

531
00:39:11,776 --> 00:39:13,718
<i>to keep Trey in your prayers and thoughts</i>

532
00:39:13,824 --> 00:39:15,351
<i>while he's in recovery.</i>

533
00:39:16,096 --> 00:39:18,518
<i>We will begin today's service with a prayer.</i>

534
00:39:20,864 --> 00:39:24,279
<i>Father, we ask that we may find comfort</i>

535
00:39:24,385 --> 00:39:29,120
<i>in every sorrow and may see</i>
<i>our way through darkness into light.</i>

536
00:39:30,976 --> 00:39:33,878
Sin is the ruin and misery

537
00:39:33,985 --> 00:39:35,414
of the human soul.

538
00:39:36,513 --> 00:39:38,553
It is destructive in its nature

539
00:39:39,137 --> 00:39:40,926
and God has declared

540
00:39:41,441 --> 00:39:43,099
through many scriptures

541
00:39:43,361 --> 00:39:45,849
that he will punish the unrepentant sinner.

542
00:39:47,777 --> 00:39:50,527
And they should be cast down
into the fires of hell,

543
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:52,512
because they not only hate God,

544
00:39:54,305 --> 00:39:57,403
they shame him and they do not fear him.

545
00:39:58,017 --> 00:39:59,675
God is love

546
00:40:00,737 --> 00:40:03,290
and religion is the law of love.

547
00:40:04,289 --> 00:40:07,355
<i>When a soul</i>
<i>becomes filled with the love of God,</i>

548
00:40:07,457 --> 00:40:10,359
<i>with a desire for all that is good,</i>

549
00:40:11,426 --> 00:40:14,143
<i>it's become possessed</i>
<i>of a new hold on existence.</i>

550
00:40:16,257 --> 00:40:18,811
<i>There are dark clouds of God's wrath</i>

551
00:40:18,913 --> 00:40:21,117
hanging directly over your heads,

552
00:40:21,857 --> 00:40:23,800
full of the dreadful storm,

553
00:40:24,386 --> 00:40:27,899
and the screaming of thunder,
and were it not for God's restraining hand,

554
00:40:28,001 --> 00:40:30,652
it would immediately burst forth upon you.

555
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,632
You are in God's hands,

556
00:40:33,474 --> 00:40:36,540
and it is uncertain what he will do with you.

557
00:40:36,994 --> 00:40:39,482
No situation in life is hopeless.

558
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:45,307
<i>Winter has its bright spots,</i>
<i>sickness its comforts,</i>

559
00:40:46,178 --> 00:40:49,975
<i>and the sharpest affliction, some solace.</i>

560
00:40:52,066 --> 00:40:55,001
<i>Where there is nothing else, there is hope.</i>

561
00:40:56,354 --> 00:40:58,329
<i>Whatever is good is given to all.</i>

562
00:40:59,106 --> 00:41:00,667
<i>The sun shines for all.</i>

563
00:41:01,858 --> 00:41:05,055
<i>Let us not forget what God explicitly tells us,</i>

564
00:41:06,083 --> 00:41:08,832
and that is to love thy neighbor as thyself.

565
00:41:09,346 --> 00:41:13,143
Sinners! You have despised
the mighty power of God.

566
00:41:13,282 --> 00:41:16,512
Consider the danger that you are in.

567
00:41:17,826 --> 00:41:19,517
<i>It is a great furnace,</i>

568
00:41:20,259 --> 00:41:22,299
<i>a wide and bottomless pit,</i>

569
00:41:22,403 --> 00:41:25,305
<i>full of fire and brimstone,</i>
<i>that you are held over.</i>

570
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:27,992
Trust in the good of mankind

571
00:41:28,963 --> 00:41:31,451
and in the beauty of God.

572
00:41:31,811 --> 00:41:33,186
The wrath of God!

573
00:41:33,315 --> 00:41:34,395
Acceptance.

574
00:41:34,787 --> 00:41:35,835
Abomination!

575
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:38,398
God is love.

576
00:41:38,532 --> 00:41:40,354
And He will punish you!

577
00:41:44,323 --> 00:41:48,415
Trey. Trey? Trey!

578
00:41:49,092 --> 00:41:51,874
Help! Somebody help, please!

579
00:41:51,972 --> 00:41:54,460
- Trey! Oh, please!
- I need assistance over here in 2.

580
00:41:54,563 --> 00:41:56,254
- Please!
- Please, ma'am,

581
00:41:56,356 --> 00:41:57,763
can I get you just to stand back a little bit?

582
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,005
Thank you.

583
00:42:04,963 --> 00:42:06,873
We did everything we could.

584
00:42:08,548 --> 00:42:10,785
He had a severe hemorrhage,

585
00:42:12,164 --> 00:42:14,531
and we were not able to stop the bleeding.

586
00:42:16,036 --> 00:42:18,141
I'm very sorry, he passed away.

587
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,324
No!

588
00:42:27,364 --> 00:42:30,463
Mom, Trey didn't make it.

589
00:42:35,557 --> 00:42:38,459
No, I don't really want to talk about it, but...

590
00:42:40,388 --> 00:42:41,763
I'm at the hospital...

591
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,900
No, don't...

592
00:42:44,357 --> 00:42:45,284
Just...

593
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,290
Just take your time.

594
00:42:52,037 --> 00:42:53,379
And come tomorrow.

595
00:42:59,078 --> 00:43:01,980
No, I'm... I'm fine. Bye.

596
00:43:14,405 --> 00:43:16,544
<i>Hi, this message is for Trey McCoy.</i>

597
00:43:16,646 --> 00:43:18,751
<i>This is Carla with First Class Weddings.</i>

598
00:43:18,853 --> 00:43:21,406
<i>Wanted to let you know we got</i>
<i>your invitations in early,</i>

599
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:23,681
<i>and you can pick them up</i>
<i>whenever you're ready.</i>

600
00:43:23,782 --> 00:43:25,408
<i>Okay, thanks a lot...</i>

601
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:22,565
Mommy, I had a bad dream.

602
00:48:31,277 --> 00:48:34,124
Shh, it's okay.

603
00:48:34,605 --> 00:48:36,644
<i>It's okay, Mommy's here.</i>

604
00:48:37,868 --> 00:48:39,494
<i>Mommy's here.</i>

605
00:49:27,789 --> 00:49:29,098
Where did you get this?

606
00:49:29,198 --> 00:49:30,660
"God Hates Homos."

607
00:49:30,766 --> 00:49:31,781
What?

608
00:49:32,366 --> 00:49:33,576
It's a website.

609
00:49:34,861 --> 00:49:36,007
Amazing.

610
00:49:36,238 --> 00:49:38,278
So, did you find anything else?

611
00:49:38,798 --> 00:49:41,417
The case is being transferred to Homicide.

612
00:49:42,606 --> 00:49:43,686
Homicide.

613
00:49:44,046 --> 00:49:45,705
Yes, but does that mean you're not
on the case or...

614
00:49:45,806 --> 00:49:47,595
No, I am.

615
00:49:47,758 --> 00:49:50,758
But I'll be working with Sergeant Esposito
from Homicide.

616
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:53,956
He's been around a long time. He's good.

617
00:49:54,062 --> 00:49:56,396
Okay, so what happens now?

618
00:49:57,999 --> 00:50:00,650
The investigation continues
just as it has been.

619
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:02,926
I know you're frustrated.

620
00:50:03,022 --> 00:50:05,837
Frustrated?
Come on, that asshole should be in jail.

621
00:50:06,094 --> 00:50:09,390
Just sit tight, Robbie,
and we'll find something.

622
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:11,310
We will.

623
00:50:11,694 --> 00:50:13,734
<i>Screw the justice system,</i>

624
00:50:14,895 --> 00:50:17,066
'cause otherwise it's gonna screw you.

625
00:50:19,759 --> 00:50:21,319
That's pretty cynical.

626
00:50:21,871 --> 00:50:22,983
Yeah, well...

627
00:50:24,463 --> 00:50:27,529
I've been around a long time,
and I've seen a lot of crap.

628
00:50:27,695 --> 00:50:30,729
And believe you me,
it ain't never about justice.

629
00:50:32,304 --> 00:50:33,830
I know that for sure.

630
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:38,729
What happened?

631
00:50:41,744 --> 00:50:44,133
My second husband happened, that's what.

632
00:50:46,192 --> 00:50:48,047
You never told me you had
a second husband.

633
00:50:48,143 --> 00:50:50,315
Yeah, well it's not a subject
I really like to bring up.

634
00:50:50,415 --> 00:50:52,106
I'm not real proud of it.

635
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,083
What did he do?

636
00:51:00,112 --> 00:51:04,487
Well, first off, he liked to beat
the shit out of me.

637
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,018
Oh, honey.

638
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,641
But I didn't know it till after
I married the son of a bitch.

639
00:51:09,744 --> 00:51:11,337
But, the point is...

640
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,404
Do you think that the law was there
to protect me?

641
00:51:16,016 --> 00:51:16,943
Do you?

642
00:51:17,552 --> 00:51:19,079
Because you think again.

643
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:24,394
I had to protect myself from him and the law.

644
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,462
Now, you listen to me, Robbie.

645
00:51:29,489 --> 00:51:31,463
You hear what I'm gonna tell you.

646
00:51:32,113 --> 00:51:36,368
You cannot rely on anybody but yourself,

647
00:51:36,465 --> 00:51:39,214
and you cannot trust anybody but yourself.

648
00:51:43,953 --> 00:51:47,882
<i>Onward, Christian soldiers</i>

649
00:51:47,985 --> 00:51:51,400
<i>marching as to war</i>

650
00:51:52,017 --> 00:51:55,727
<i>with the cross of Jesus</i>

651
00:51:55,825 --> 00:51:58,695
<i>going on before</i>

652
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:02,985
<i>Christ, the royal Master</i>

653
00:52:03,377 --> 00:52:07,119
<i>leads against the foe</i>

654
00:52:07,313 --> 00:52:10,990
<i>Forward into battle</i>

655
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:14,985
<i>see his banners go</i>

656
00:52:15,089 --> 00:52:18,919
<i>Onward, Christian soldiers</i>

657
00:52:19,025 --> 00:52:22,571
<i>marching as to war</i>

658
00:52:22,802 --> 00:52:26,730
<i>with the cross of Jesus</i>

659
00:52:26,834 --> 00:52:29,965
<i>going on before</i>

660
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:31,275
Hey, what do you think you're doing here?

661
00:52:31,378 --> 00:52:33,320
- I came to the service.
- You're not allowed here.

662
00:52:33,425 --> 00:52:34,473
Well, why not?

663
00:52:34,578 --> 00:52:36,815
- This is no place for...
- Fags?

664
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:39,432
What are you afraid of? That it's contagious?

665
00:52:39,538 --> 00:52:40,967
I said get out, man.

666
00:52:42,258 --> 00:52:44,201
Don't you want more of us to beat to death?

667
00:52:44,306 --> 00:52:45,615
You stay away from me.

668
00:52:45,714 --> 00:52:47,405
- You're not gonna get away with it.
- Now, I'm warning you.

669
00:52:47,506 --> 00:52:49,197
- Or what?
- You leave me alone.

670
00:52:49,298 --> 00:52:52,811
Let me ask you a question.
Did God tell you to do it, huh?

671
00:52:52,915 --> 00:52:54,322
Did it make you feel powerful?

672
00:52:54,418 --> 00:52:56,426
Does your God approve of murder?

673
00:53:15,987 --> 00:53:19,532
<i>Let me ask you a</i>
<i>question. Did God tell you to do it, huh?</i>

674
00:53:19,635 --> 00:53:21,195
<i>Did it make you feel powerful?</i>

675
00:53:21,299 --> 00:53:23,372
<i>Does your God approve of murder?</i>

676
00:54:04,788 --> 00:54:06,195
What do you think?

677
00:54:06,804 --> 00:54:08,626
Nothing physical linking Boyd?

678
00:54:09,556 --> 00:54:11,378
There has to be something

679
00:54:11,476 --> 00:54:13,865
besides the strong circumstantial evidence.

680
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:18,090
Yeah, I think you're missing
the obvious here, Fisher.

681
00:54:31,125 --> 00:54:32,651
- Mr. Levinson?
- Yes.

682
00:54:33,076 --> 00:54:35,443
Sergeant Esposito, Dallas Homicide.

683
00:54:36,693 --> 00:54:38,122
Is there any news?

684
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:39,889
May I come in?

685
00:54:41,141 --> 00:54:43,443
I don't understand why
this is taking so long.

686
00:54:43,541 --> 00:54:45,231
It seems like you guys
are dragging your feet.

687
00:54:45,333 --> 00:54:46,762
Is that so?

688
00:54:47,029 --> 00:54:49,876
I noticed in the original report

689
00:54:49,973 --> 00:54:53,268
that you and Mr. McCoy had an argument
just before the incident.

690
00:54:53,813 --> 00:54:56,464
- What are you talking about?
- I just wanna know what happened.

691
00:54:56,566 --> 00:54:58,027
We had a disagreement.

692
00:54:58,134 --> 00:54:59,410
What about?

693
00:54:59,542 --> 00:55:00,654
Why does that matter?

694
00:55:00,758 --> 00:55:03,125
- Did you two fight a lot?
- No.

695
00:55:03,221 --> 00:55:05,393
What do all these questions have to do
with my next door neighbor?

696
00:55:05,493 --> 00:55:09,039
Well, your neighbor tells me he saw
you and Mr. McCoy fight quite a bit.

697
00:55:09,142 --> 00:55:10,189
And you believe him?

698
00:55:10,294 --> 00:55:12,563
He also tells me you've been harassing him.

699
00:55:12,661 --> 00:55:14,352
He killed my partner.

700
00:55:14,454 --> 00:55:15,981
He and two other people
say he couldn't have.

701
00:55:16,085 --> 00:55:17,067
They're lying.

702
00:55:17,174 --> 00:55:20,622
Well, why would a respected Pastor,
a man of God, lie to the police?

703
00:55:21,014 --> 00:55:22,159
To protect his son.

704
00:55:22,262 --> 00:55:24,815
A word of advice, stay away from Chris Boyd.

705
00:55:24,982 --> 00:55:26,836
He's been arrested for gay-bashing,
for Christ's sake.

706
00:55:26,934 --> 00:55:29,520
All I know is what the evidence tells me.

707
00:55:29,717 --> 00:55:32,532
And your fingerprints were the only ones
on that bat.

708
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:35,027
I explained that.

709
00:55:35,414 --> 00:55:39,091
Mr. Levinson, you want to tell me
about the life insurance policy?

710
00:55:40,662 --> 00:55:42,767
We both had one on each other.

711
00:55:45,366 --> 00:55:47,374
Did you kill your boyfriend?

712
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:50,099
This isn't happening.

713
00:55:50,198 --> 00:55:51,987
It's a simple question.

714
00:55:54,902 --> 00:55:56,495
Get out of my house.

715
00:56:08,374 --> 00:56:10,709
"And gave us the day and the night,

716
00:56:10,807 --> 00:56:12,912
"and God made the sky above,

717
00:56:13,367 --> 00:56:14,774
"and God made the water below."

718
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:16,278
Where's Chris Boyd?

719
00:56:16,375 --> 00:56:18,230
Check the activity room.

720
00:56:27,351 --> 00:56:29,740
- You're interrupting a meeting.
- What did you tell them?

721
00:56:29,847 --> 00:56:31,505
- Back off!
- You're a liar!

722
00:56:31,608 --> 00:56:32,688
Back off!

723
00:56:34,711 --> 00:56:36,337
Yes, we need help.

724
00:56:40,055 --> 00:56:42,608
- What's going on here?
- Kathleen, call Stella!

725
00:56:42,712 --> 00:56:44,752
Where you taking him and why?

726
00:56:45,432 --> 00:56:47,985
Well, well, well, Ms. Slansky.

727
00:56:48,408 --> 00:56:50,317
Nice to see you again, Kathleen.

728
00:56:50,488 --> 00:56:52,593
Mr. Esposito.

729
00:56:54,296 --> 00:56:56,631
Committing another act of justice, I see.

730
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:59,411
Now, I figured I'd run into you
again eventually.

731
00:56:59,544 --> 00:57:01,846
Now you stay on the right side
of the law this time,

732
00:57:01,944 --> 00:57:04,115
otherwise I'll be taking you down, too.

733
00:57:04,312 --> 00:57:06,646
Your boy here's been arrested for assault.

734
00:57:08,088 --> 00:57:10,096
You leave him alone, you mother...

735
00:57:21,784 --> 00:57:23,507
She been coaching you, son?

736
00:57:27,833 --> 00:57:30,037
- What are you doing?
- Sit down.

737
00:57:30,136 --> 00:57:31,543
I don't want to sit.

738
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,710
Close the door and sit down.

739
00:57:38,008 --> 00:57:39,317
You could have told me

740
00:57:39,417 --> 00:57:41,522
that you were questioning Robbie Levinson
as a suspect.

741
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:43,152
When you've been doing this as long as
I have...

742
00:57:43,257 --> 00:57:44,305
He didn't do it.

743
00:57:44,409 --> 00:57:45,936
Are you familiar with this case?

744
00:57:46,041 --> 00:57:48,758
You mean my case? Yeah, I'm familiar with it.

745
00:57:48,857 --> 00:57:51,378
Well, then you know that his fingerprints
are all over the murder weapon,

746
00:57:51,481 --> 00:57:53,870
which just happened to belong to the victim.

747
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,795
He was covered in the victim's blood,

748
00:57:55,897 --> 00:57:57,271
and to top it all off, he's about to collect

749
00:57:57,369 --> 00:57:58,798
half a million dollars in life insurance.

750
00:57:58,905 --> 00:58:00,400
I mean, what am I missing here?

751
00:58:00,505 --> 00:58:03,571
The whole goddamn story. And Chris Boyd.

752
00:58:03,673 --> 00:58:06,390
Oh, yes, right, Chris Boyd is lying.
Show me the proof.

753
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:08,312
Kathleen Slansky's statement.

754
00:58:08,697 --> 00:58:10,192
Oh, come on.

755
00:58:10,874 --> 00:58:12,019
About that.

756
00:58:12,281 --> 00:58:14,737
You do me a favor,
you ask that old broad about her husband,

757
00:58:14,841 --> 00:58:16,467
her dead husband.

758
00:58:16,569 --> 00:58:18,577
I mean, look at the facts, Fisher.

759
00:58:19,482 --> 00:58:22,035
You cannot just ignore Boyd's past.

760
00:58:22,138 --> 00:58:24,756
Oh, all too convenient for Levinson,
wouldn't you think?

761
00:58:24,858 --> 00:58:27,345
Just because a man has had run-ins
with homos...

762
00:58:27,642 --> 00:58:29,169
Homosexuals, doesn't mean he's a killer.

763
00:58:29,274 --> 00:58:31,641
Yeah, well neither does being a homo.

764
00:58:32,186 --> 00:58:34,520
Look, it looks like
an open and shut case to me.

765
00:58:34,618 --> 00:58:36,505
I've already talked to the DA about
making a case.

766
00:58:36,602 --> 00:58:37,944
You did what?

767
00:58:39,194 --> 00:58:41,845
You are not going to just shut me out of this.

768
00:58:41,946 --> 00:58:45,492
This is Homicide, Fisher.
Stick to something you can handle.

769
00:58:47,386 --> 00:58:49,393
Robbie, what is wrong with you?

770
00:58:49,499 --> 00:58:51,571
They're putting a restraining order
out on me.

771
00:58:51,674 --> 00:58:53,714
- What?
- Yeah, to stay away from him.

772
00:58:54,139 --> 00:58:56,048
I should have seen this coming.

773
00:58:56,155 --> 00:58:58,010
This isn't like you.

774
00:58:58,875 --> 00:59:02,224
Hey, promise me
you won't do something like this again.

775
00:59:02,331 --> 00:59:04,087
He's lying to the police.

776
00:59:05,915 --> 00:59:07,028
Robbie.

777
00:59:14,395 --> 00:59:17,494
Hey. You should get some rest.

778
00:59:18,523 --> 00:59:19,570
I'm fine.

779
00:59:19,675 --> 00:59:22,358
- Fine? You haven't slept for days.
- You noticed?

780
00:59:24,443 --> 00:59:25,872
I'm sorry.

781
00:59:26,747 --> 00:59:28,023
I can't sleep.

782
00:59:28,667 --> 00:59:29,943
I'm not like you.

783
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:33,270
I can't pretend that everything's
back to normal.

784
00:59:33,723 --> 00:59:36,309
My life will never be normal again.

785
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:38,228
Not like me?

786
00:59:38,748 --> 00:59:42,009
What, you think my life is all of a sudden
back to normal?

787
00:59:42,107 --> 00:59:44,376
You know, how am I supposed to know, Jim?

788
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:48,598
You never talk to me about your hurt.
You never say anything to me.

789
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:54,774
At least, when you were a mean drunk, you...

790
00:59:55,452 --> 00:59:58,037
You told me how you were feeling,
you know?

791
01:00:01,692 --> 01:00:03,318
You know, just forget it.

792
01:00:04,668 --> 01:00:05,912
Excuse me.

793
01:00:06,044 --> 01:00:09,012
So, apparently this is about me.

794
01:00:09,181 --> 01:00:11,482
Have I done something that I'm unaware of?

795
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:13,587
You're treating me like the enemy.

796
01:00:13,916 --> 01:00:15,542
What the hell is going on?

797
01:00:15,645 --> 01:00:17,052
I told you what's going on.

798
01:00:17,148 --> 01:00:19,287
- Please, let's just drop it.
- No, let's not just drop it.

799
01:00:19,388 --> 01:00:22,290
Barbara, I know there is something else
happening here.

800
01:00:22,748 --> 01:00:26,229
- How can I help you if you're not gonna...
- I don't want your help!

801
01:00:27,324 --> 01:00:28,885
You can't help me.

802
01:00:30,108 --> 01:00:32,280
Please, I'm just trying to do the laundry.

803
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:34,453
- Let me do something.
- Oh, please, just leave me alone.

804
01:00:34,556 --> 01:00:35,571
I want to do something.

805
01:00:35,677 --> 01:00:37,051
I really need you to leave me alone right now.

806
01:00:37,149 --> 01:00:39,570
- Barbara, this is doing you no good...
- Stop!

807
01:00:40,445 --> 01:00:41,722
- You want to help me?
- Yes.

808
01:00:41,821 --> 01:00:44,505
- You want to know what you can do for me?
- Try me.

809
01:00:46,301 --> 01:00:48,472
I want my son back.

810
01:00:50,109 --> 01:00:52,280
Can you do that for me?

811
01:04:02,849 --> 01:04:04,737
I don't want to color anymore.

812
01:04:04,834 --> 01:04:06,689
I want you to play with me.

813
01:04:07,554 --> 01:04:09,528
Give Mommy one more minute.

814
01:04:22,850 --> 01:04:24,344
I don't know anything about it. I swear.

815
01:04:24,449 --> 01:04:26,905
I was at my friend Sammy's. Ask him.

816
01:04:27,298 --> 01:04:29,916
I'm gonna need to get
contact information for Sammy.

817
01:04:30,018 --> 01:04:31,709
- Can you give me that?
- Yeah.

818
01:05:02,435 --> 01:05:04,377
You ever been in trouble
with the law before, Alton?

819
01:05:04,483 --> 01:05:06,370
Nope. Never.

820
01:05:07,139 --> 01:05:09,441
Never? Hmm.

821
01:05:11,459 --> 01:05:13,663
What about your arrest six years ago?

822
01:05:15,683 --> 01:05:18,530
- Look, that was Chris's idea.
- Oh.

823
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:20,987
What? It wasn't me, okay?

824
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:23,674
- Isn't it obvious who did it?
- Who?

825
01:05:26,723 --> 01:05:27,836
Chris.

826
01:05:34,339 --> 01:05:36,478
Did Chris tell you he did it?

827
01:05:36,996 --> 01:05:38,043
No.

828
01:05:38,179 --> 01:05:40,830
So to save your own ass,
you're saying he did it.

829
01:05:40,932 --> 01:05:43,266
Yeah, no. No, I didn't mean...

830
01:05:44,324 --> 01:05:47,139
Look, he wouldn't tell me
where he'd been that night.

831
01:05:51,107 --> 01:05:54,075
He wasn't at home
because he was at his parents'.

832
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:55,741
Not when I talked to his mom.

833
01:05:55,844 --> 01:05:58,659
- You called his mother?
- Yeah. She said he wasn't there.

834
01:05:59,492 --> 01:06:01,117
You're lying to me.

835
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:02,649
No.

836
01:06:22,756 --> 01:06:24,644
So, why do you think he did it?

837
01:06:26,405 --> 01:06:29,088
Because, he hates fag... Gay people.

838
01:06:29,604 --> 01:06:31,131
More than you do?

839
01:06:31,749 --> 01:06:32,763
Yeah.

840
01:08:02,374 --> 01:08:04,447
- Mrs. McCoy?
- Who are you?

841
01:08:04,775 --> 01:08:08,190
I'm Martha Boyd. Christopher Boyd's mother.

842
01:08:08,295 --> 01:08:11,142
I hope you don't mind,
I got your address from the phone book.

843
01:08:11,239 --> 01:08:12,995
Please, may I come in?

844
01:08:25,159 --> 01:08:28,737
- Could we sit and talk for just a minute?
- You can talk to me here.

845
01:08:29,127 --> 01:08:30,240
All right.

846
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:33,447
I just...

847
01:08:34,119 --> 01:08:35,974
I just really wanted to reach out to you,

848
01:08:36,072 --> 01:08:39,367
you know, from one mother to another.
I mean, I know we don't know each other

849
01:08:39,463 --> 01:08:42,529
but I feel that we are somewhat connected,

850
01:08:42,695 --> 01:08:45,117
what with all the stories in the paper

851
01:08:45,223 --> 01:08:47,907
and the things people are saying.

852
01:08:48,007 --> 01:08:51,455
I mean, you can imagine the embarrassment
this is causing our church.

853
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,218
Get out of my house.

854
01:08:54,792 --> 01:08:58,087
Mrs. McCoy, you need to know

855
01:08:58,184 --> 01:09:02,439
that Christopher would never,
ever do something like this.

856
01:09:02,824 --> 01:09:04,166
My son is a...

857
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:07,077
He's a decent, kind, God-fearing young man.

858
01:09:07,272 --> 01:09:08,549
Oh, really.

859
01:09:08,904 --> 01:09:10,497
My son is dead.

860
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:12,480
I know.

861
01:09:14,696 --> 01:09:16,868
I know what you must be going through.

862
01:09:17,993 --> 01:09:19,072
Tell you what,

863
01:09:19,176 --> 01:09:22,722
Christopher has done
some pretty foolish things in his life,

864
01:09:23,176 --> 01:09:25,249
especially when he was a little boy.

865
01:09:25,448 --> 01:09:28,383
By God's grace,
he's always been able to stay on track.

866
01:09:28,489 --> 01:09:31,488
But every time he would get into trouble,

867
01:09:31,593 --> 01:09:33,698
I couldn't help but feel that, somehow,

868
01:09:33,801 --> 01:09:36,168
I had failed as a mother.

869
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:41,764
I really do hope that
you don't blame yourself

870
01:09:41,865 --> 01:09:43,774
for the choices your son made.

871
01:09:45,257 --> 01:09:47,526
Excuse me? Choices?

872
01:09:49,129 --> 01:09:52,163
Well, you know what I mean.

873
01:09:52,393 --> 01:09:54,914
By living his life the way he did,

874
01:09:55,177 --> 01:09:57,861
surely you understand that he was a target.

875
01:10:01,385 --> 01:10:02,530
Get out.

876
01:10:04,234 --> 01:10:05,761
Get out!

877
01:10:53,866 --> 01:10:55,360
Sit down, Christopher.

878
01:11:06,987 --> 01:11:09,409
You live your life in spite of me, boy?

879
01:11:10,763 --> 01:11:11,690
Hmm?

880
01:11:13,419 --> 01:11:14,498
Answer me.

881
01:11:16,043 --> 01:11:17,930
What do you want me to say?

882
01:11:20,395 --> 01:11:22,020
What is wrong with you?

883
01:11:28,268 --> 01:11:30,919
You mind telling me what this is all about?

884
01:11:34,028 --> 01:11:34,955
Hmm?

885
01:11:38,828 --> 01:11:40,038
That's not me.

886
01:11:41,708 --> 01:11:43,268
How about that one?

887
01:11:44,268 --> 01:11:45,195
Hmm?

888
01:11:46,508 --> 01:11:49,356
That's not me. Are you having me followed?

889
01:11:49,452 --> 01:11:52,169
- What were you doing in that evil place?
- Nothing.

890
01:11:52,268 --> 01:11:54,821
What were you doing in there, son?
You tell me.

891
01:11:56,108 --> 01:11:59,108
That filthy, sinning faggot

892
01:11:59,212 --> 01:12:00,739
came on to me!

893
01:12:01,452 --> 01:12:03,591
And I told him to get out of my face.

894
01:12:04,268 --> 01:12:05,992
And he wouldn't leave me alone,

895
01:12:06,092 --> 01:12:08,132
and he wouldn't listen to me,
and it was disgusting.

896
01:12:08,237 --> 01:12:10,179
What were you doing in there
in the first place?

897
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:11,910
- I got lost.
- You liar!

898
01:12:12,013 --> 01:12:13,769
Now how about this time, this time,

899
01:12:13,868 --> 01:12:16,585
and the time before that,
and the time before that?

900
01:12:21,773 --> 01:12:24,140
You'll not humiliate me any longer.

901
01:12:24,364 --> 01:12:26,252
Now, you will not betray God.

902
01:12:27,469 --> 01:12:31,047
What have I done to deserve
such defiance from you, son?

903
01:12:33,452 --> 01:12:35,176
I didn't do anything wrong.

904
01:12:35,437 --> 01:12:37,804
I told him he was gonna go to hell.

905
01:12:37,933 --> 01:12:39,689
I told him to read the Bible.

906
01:12:43,213 --> 01:12:46,890
It was those fags that live next door,
wasn't it, those boys over there?

907
01:12:46,990 --> 01:12:47,917
Huh?

908
01:12:48,558 --> 01:12:50,019
I seen you with them.

909
01:12:52,461 --> 01:12:55,810
They tried to recruit you?
Is that what happened?

910
01:12:57,613 --> 01:13:00,231
You wouldn't do that on your own.
Not my son.

911
01:13:04,173 --> 01:13:06,246
They got to you, didn't they?

912
01:13:09,485 --> 01:13:10,914
I was too late.

913
01:13:16,045 --> 01:13:17,223
Too late?

914
01:13:17,454 --> 01:13:18,883
I was too late.

915
01:13:20,590 --> 01:13:21,801
You did it.

916
01:13:23,758 --> 01:13:24,871
Didn't you?

917
01:13:26,350 --> 01:13:29,547
You know what God does to those
said to be beyond repentance.

918
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:32,711
You killed that boy next door?

919
01:13:34,670 --> 01:13:37,736
I wasn't gonna let them
take my own flesh and blood.

920
01:13:39,406 --> 01:13:42,505
Now this disgusting filth has got to end.

921
01:13:43,406 --> 01:13:45,446
In the name of God, it has got to stop,

922
01:13:45,551 --> 01:13:47,438
and if somebody doesn't do something,

923
01:13:47,534 --> 01:13:51,146
this plague is going to infest
the entire country.

924
01:13:53,998 --> 01:13:55,908
Come back to God, son.

925
01:13:56,014 --> 01:13:57,323
You're sick.

926
01:13:58,735 --> 01:14:00,491
Come back to God, son.

927
01:14:02,895 --> 01:14:04,204
Christopher.

928
01:14:31,247 --> 01:14:32,808
Chris?

929
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,033
Is that you? I thought I heard you come in.

930
01:14:38,832 --> 01:14:40,457
Is something wrong?

931
01:14:41,487 --> 01:14:43,178
Why do you put up with him?

932
01:14:46,287 --> 01:14:48,076
What are you talking about?

933
01:14:57,296 --> 01:15:00,013
You should've gotten out
when you had the chance.

934
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,204
Chris, aren't you staying for supper?

935
01:15:11,824 --> 01:15:15,173
"He that is joined unto the Lord
is one spirit."

936
01:15:17,424 --> 01:15:18,853
"Flee fornication.

937
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:24,328

01:15:25,425 --> 01:15:27,497

01:15:28,401 --> 01:15:30,310
"sins against his own body."

"Know ye not that your body is the temple
of the Holy Ghost which is in you?"

941
01:15:39,921 --> 01:15:43,718
"What shall we say then?
Shall we continue in sin,

942
01:15:43,857 --> 01:15:46,726
"that grace may abound?" God forbid.

01:15:46,833 --> 01:15:48,808

956
01:16:29,906 --> 01:16:30,834
<i>You're sick.</i>

957
01:16:32,178 --> 01:16:34,088
<i>Come back to God, son.</i>

958
01:16:36,722 --> 01:16:37,900
<i>Christopher...</i>

959
01:16:38,418 --> 01:16:41,069
- Where did you get this?
- Their church.

960
01:16:41,170 --> 01:16:44,367
I see.
And you, what do you know about this?

961
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:47,209
I know it proves he killed my son.

962
01:16:47,314 --> 01:16:48,776
Were you there when it was recorded?

963
01:16:48,882 --> 01:16:49,831
No.

964
01:16:51,283 --> 01:16:54,698
You have the confession, all right,
so what happens now?

965
01:16:54,899 --> 01:16:56,655
Confession? Confession for what?

966
01:16:56,754 --> 01:16:58,696
Are you an idiot? I mean, it's right there!

967
01:16:58,803 --> 01:17:00,428
No, I didn't hear anyone confess to anything.

968
01:17:00,531 --> 01:17:01,676
You got to be kidding me.

969
01:17:01,779 --> 01:17:03,273
With all due respect, Mrs. McCoy,

970
01:17:03,379 --> 01:17:05,648
this doesn't even prove
it is who he says it is.

971
01:17:05,746 --> 01:17:07,601
And if you broke into that church
to get this tape,

972
01:17:07,699 --> 01:17:09,226
you're in more trouble than you're already in.

973
01:17:09,330 --> 01:17:12,397
- Why, 'cause I got the truth?
- Because you broke the law.

974
01:17:12,595 --> 01:17:14,286
You can't just record people
without them knowing it.

975
01:17:14,387 --> 01:17:16,754
You could get 20 years alone just for this.

976
01:17:18,835 --> 01:17:22,064
You got to be kidding me.
You know exactly what's on that tape.

977
01:17:22,164 --> 01:17:23,440
You believe him?

978
01:17:23,828 --> 01:17:25,737
Why are you protecting this guy?

979
01:17:27,156 --> 01:17:28,781
What's this really about?

980
01:17:34,099 --> 01:17:36,466
Esposito. Oh, yeah, sure.

981
01:17:38,547 --> 01:17:41,133
Excuse me, Mrs. McCoy, just sit tight.

982
01:17:50,292 --> 01:17:52,812
<i>Father, where are you now?</i>

983
01:17:52,916 --> 01:17:54,705
<i>You let me drown</i>

984
01:17:54,804 --> 01:17:57,193
<i>How could you forsake me?</i>

985
01:17:58,356 --> 01:18:00,211
<i>Oh God, please hear me now</i>

986
01:18:00,308 --> 01:18:01,999
<i>I'm going down</i>

987
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:04,337
<i>No way to believe...</i>

988
01:18:04,436 --> 01:18:06,444
<i>Jesus was crucified</i>

989
01:18:11,764 --> 01:18:14,131
<i>By a 45</i>

990
01:18:15,061 --> 01:18:17,744
<i>This is Chris,</i>
<i>leave a message.</i>

991
01:18:17,908 --> 01:18:20,723
<i>Chris, it's your mother.</i>

992
01:18:21,077 --> 01:18:24,274
<i>I'm worried about you. Call me, okay?</i>

993
01:18:24,372 --> 01:18:26,609
<i>I'm bound for Hell, ya see</i>

994
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:29,650
<i>With all that surrounds me</i>

995
01:18:36,149 --> 01:18:37,393
Mrs. McCoy?

996
01:18:54,453 --> 01:18:55,468
Hey.

997
01:18:59,158 --> 01:19:01,547
- Wait a minute.
- You leave me alone.

998
01:19:01,653 --> 01:19:03,147
I need to talk to you.

999
01:19:07,958 --> 01:19:09,234
Where you going?

1000
01:19:09,333 --> 01:19:11,024
It's none of your business.

1001
01:19:11,702 --> 01:19:13,458
Your father killed Trey.

1002
01:19:22,262 --> 01:19:23,823
I know you know.

1003
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:27,376
You have to tell somebody.

1004
01:19:27,734 --> 01:19:29,228
You have to tell the police.

1005
01:19:29,334 --> 01:19:31,701
Hey, why can't you look at me, huh?

1006
01:19:32,727 --> 01:19:34,832
Why can't you even look at me?

1007
01:19:34,934 --> 01:19:37,073
Turn your head, just for a second.

1008
01:19:37,879 --> 01:19:39,853
I'm not telling anybody anything.

1009
01:20:19,351 --> 01:20:21,239
So, what about Phoebe?

1010
01:20:21,943 --> 01:20:24,082
She's fine. She's at Stella's.

1011
01:20:24,183 --> 01:20:26,125
And have you said anything to Stella about...

1012
01:20:26,232 --> 01:20:28,403
No. Of course not.

1013
01:20:31,959 --> 01:20:34,676
Look, Barbara,
I can do this on my own, okay?

1014
01:20:34,775 --> 01:20:37,809
- I mean, they're gonna put me in jail anyway.
- You can't talk me out of this.

1015
01:20:37,911 --> 01:20:39,602
I just want you to understand
what you're getting...

1016
01:20:39,704 --> 01:20:41,264
Don't try, Robbie.

1017
01:20:41,624 --> 01:20:42,551
Okay.

1018
01:20:47,064 --> 01:20:48,754
I'm just worried about you.

1019
01:20:49,592 --> 01:20:51,632
My life cannot possibly...

1020
01:20:54,232 --> 01:20:56,086
Here you go, hon.

1021
01:20:58,104 --> 01:20:59,119
Thank you.

1022
01:21:02,105 --> 01:21:05,782
My life cannot possibly be destroyed
any more than it already has been.

1023
01:21:08,088 --> 01:21:11,187
I want justice.

1024
01:21:14,169 --> 01:21:16,056
That's all I want.

1025
01:22:22,394 --> 01:22:26,191
Mrs. Boyd, I know you said
that Chris was here the whole night.

1026
01:22:26,298 --> 01:22:28,665
But something about that just isn't right.

1027
01:22:28,826 --> 01:22:32,503
Alton Kachim called here that night
looking for Chris.

1028
01:22:33,659 --> 01:22:37,587
No, I'm sorry, darling,
he left about half an hour ago.

1029
01:22:38,138 --> 01:22:39,764
Did your husband tell you to lie?

1030
01:22:39,867 --> 01:22:41,361
No, I wasn't lying.

1031
01:22:41,658 --> 01:22:43,185
No, they were together.

1032
01:22:43,355 --> 01:22:46,224
My husband went out to talk to Chris.
He told me.

1033
01:22:47,611 --> 01:22:49,815
Mrs. Boyd, where is your husband now?

1034
01:22:49,915 --> 01:22:53,144
He's working. He works late.

1035
01:22:59,067 --> 01:23:00,245
What is this?

1036
01:23:01,499 --> 01:23:02,776
Don't answer it.

1037
01:23:03,771 --> 01:23:05,200
Who are you?

1038
01:23:06,171 --> 01:23:08,724
I'm Trey McCoy's mother.

1039
01:23:09,147 --> 01:23:10,292
Remember him?

1040
01:23:10,491 --> 01:23:12,499
Do you have any idea who I am?

1041
01:23:12,635 --> 01:23:14,806
Oh, yeah.

1042
01:23:16,059 --> 01:23:17,466
You murdered my son.

1043
01:23:18,011 --> 01:23:19,418
That's insane.

1044
01:23:23,771 --> 01:23:26,805
Well, he must be on his way home.

1045
01:23:27,579 --> 01:23:29,106
Where's your son?

1046
01:23:30,556 --> 01:23:32,661
He's been very upset.

1047
01:23:32,860 --> 01:23:35,129
He hasn't been returning my phone calls.

1048
01:23:36,635 --> 01:23:39,767
Mrs. Boyd, here's my card.
Have your husband call me.

1049
01:23:43,996 --> 01:23:45,557
I'll go to the police.

1050
01:23:45,723 --> 01:23:47,130
That's what we want.

1051
01:23:49,244 --> 01:23:51,732
Then maybe you could explain this.

1052
01:23:53,212 --> 01:23:55,448
<i>You killed that boy next door?</i>

1053
01:23:55,548 --> 01:23:58,614
<i>I wasn't gonna let them</i>
<i>take my own flesh and blood.</i>

1054
01:24:00,252 --> 01:24:03,154
<i>Now this disgusting filth has got to end.</i>

1055
01:24:04,380 --> 01:24:06,453
<i>In the name of God, it has got to stop,</i>

1056
01:24:06,556 --> 01:24:08,214
<i>and if somebody doesn't do something,</i>

1057
01:24:08,316 --> 01:24:11,928
<i>this plague is going to infest</i>
<i>the entire country.</i>

1058
01:24:14,876 --> 01:24:16,403
<i>Come back to God...</i>

1059
01:24:17,341 --> 01:24:21,302
You took my only child from me.

1060
01:24:22,108 --> 01:24:24,564
Your child was an unrepentant,

1061
01:24:24,797 --> 01:24:28,342
plague-carrying abomination,
just like that one there.

1062
01:24:29,341 --> 01:24:31,381
Is that why you did it?

1063
01:24:31,485 --> 01:24:32,914
Tell me.

1064
01:24:33,373 --> 01:24:34,300
Why?

1065
01:24:35,805 --> 01:24:38,554
Read the Holy Bible, the word of God.

1066
01:24:39,389 --> 01:24:41,560
<i>I didn't kill your son, God did.</i>

1067
01:24:41,789 --> 01:24:43,961
I was merely his servant.

1068
01:24:44,157 --> 01:24:45,270
Get up.

1069
01:24:45,790 --> 01:24:46,869
Do it.

1070
01:24:48,605 --> 01:24:50,329
Put your hands on your head.

1071
01:24:57,598 --> 01:24:59,932
What are going to do
with that tape?

1072
01:25:00,446 --> 01:25:03,829
We won't do anything with it
if you just do what we say.

1073
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:09,914
Put those on.

1074
01:25:16,798 --> 01:25:19,187
Your plan won't work. It makes no sense.

1075
01:25:19,294 --> 01:25:21,629
A lot of things don't make sense.

1076
01:25:23,678 --> 01:25:26,810
You're crazy if you think
they're gonna believe you over me.

1077
01:25:35,103 --> 01:25:36,313
Get in.

1078
01:26:48,223 --> 01:26:49,401
Go in.

1079
01:26:59,296 --> 01:27:00,441
Why would I come here?

1080
01:27:00,545 --> 01:27:01,493
Because you know we have the tape,

1081
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:02,549
and you want to make sure we don't use it.

1082
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:04,729
- Now, get on the floor.
- Why?

1083
01:27:04,832 --> 01:27:06,359
- Get on the floor!
- No.

1084
01:27:10,272 --> 01:27:11,200
You okay?

1085
01:27:11,457 --> 01:27:12,831
Oh, yeah, I'm okay.

1086
01:27:28,448 --> 01:27:30,139
My wife is waiting for me.

1087
01:27:30,241 --> 01:27:31,321
Good.

1088
01:27:32,577 --> 01:27:34,749
You think God will forgive you for this?

1089
01:27:57,090 --> 01:28:00,767
Help! Somebody help!

1090
01:28:00,866 --> 01:28:03,419
Three, two, one.

1091
01:28:12,898 --> 01:28:14,108
Come on.

1092
01:28:16,193 --> 01:28:19,455
Operator, there's a strange man
in my neighbor's yard.

1093
01:28:29,123 --> 01:28:31,195
Okay, I'm ready.

1094
01:28:31,938 --> 01:28:33,367
Ready for what?

1095
01:28:37,474 --> 01:28:39,579
I don't know if I can do this.

1096
01:28:39,683 --> 01:28:41,788
- We can't go back now.
- Do what?

1097
01:28:41,891 --> 01:28:43,417
Don't look at me!

1098
01:28:43,523 --> 01:28:45,628
Don't do this. Don't do this.

1099
01:28:46,210 --> 01:28:48,479
You can do it, Mom. Barbara...

1100
01:28:48,579 --> 01:28:50,586
- Barbara, don't do this, now.
- Do it!

1101
01:28:50,691 --> 01:28:52,447
Don't listen to him.

1102
01:28:57,603 --> 01:28:59,032
Oh, Robbie.

1103
01:29:00,387 --> 01:29:02,013
I'm okay.

1104
01:29:03,555 --> 01:29:04,482
Barbara.

1105
01:29:04,579 --> 01:29:05,789
Stay there.

1106
01:29:05,891 --> 01:29:07,647
You people are insane!

1107
01:29:16,868 --> 01:29:18,111
Stop that!

1108
01:29:27,107 --> 01:29:28,514
Pick it up.

1109
01:29:28,963 --> 01:29:30,873
That's mine. Where'd you get that?

1110
01:29:30,979 --> 01:29:33,151
- Pick up the gun!
- No, I won't!

1111
01:29:33,251 --> 01:29:35,423
Please, please!

1112
01:29:37,699 --> 01:29:39,739
- Go.
- I want to see.

1113
01:29:39,844 --> 01:29:42,561
No, you got to hurry.
They're already on their way.

1114
01:29:48,868 --> 01:29:50,045
I got it.

1115
01:30:00,868 --> 01:30:02,112
Look at me.

1116
01:30:02,212 --> 01:30:05,179
You lied to me. You're gonna kill me.

1117
01:30:07,141 --> 01:30:09,442
- I'll confess.
- It's too late.

1118
01:30:09,573 --> 01:30:11,460
Listen now,
I'll do anything you want.

1119
01:30:11,556 --> 01:30:13,564
Just think about what you're doing now.

1120
01:30:13,668 --> 01:30:15,675
I got a family, I'm begging you.

1121
01:30:15,781 --> 01:30:19,130
Please, please. Think about this.

1122
01:30:21,764 --> 01:30:24,896
You know my boy? He's like you.

1123
01:30:25,092 --> 01:30:27,002
Think about him now.

1124
01:30:43,301 --> 01:30:45,690
"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want,

1125
01:30:45,798 --> 01:30:48,318
"He maketh me to lie down in green pastures,

1126
01:30:48,422 --> 01:30:50,396
"He layeth me beside..."

1127
01:31:09,766 --> 01:31:11,969
A man lies with another man,

1128
01:31:12,806 --> 01:31:14,780
he does that which is detestable.

1129
01:31:16,998 --> 01:31:18,973
He shall be put to death.

1130
01:31:19,174 --> 01:31:22,786
"And the blood shall be on his own head."

1131
01:32:11,175 --> 01:32:14,143
- Is someone going to help this boy?
- Yes, ma'am.

1132
01:32:15,367 --> 01:32:16,993
Is he gonna be all right?

1133
01:32:39,304 --> 01:32:41,126
- Does that feel good?
- Mmm-hmm.

1134
01:32:42,248 --> 01:32:43,622
Listen, I can stay a couple of hours.

1135
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:45,509
Jim said he could
come back later and get me.

1136
01:32:45,608 --> 01:32:48,291
It's okay. Stella's gonna be here in a little bit.

1137
01:32:53,928 --> 01:32:55,172
How you doing?

1138
01:32:55,272 --> 01:32:56,581
Been better.

1139
01:32:58,856 --> 01:33:02,533
We found Chris Boyd.
We've notified him of the death of his father.

1140
01:33:02,632 --> 01:33:04,541
He's agreed to make a statement.

1141
01:33:05,032 --> 01:33:06,341
A statement?

1142
01:33:06,952 --> 01:33:08,327
Against his father.

1143
01:33:13,256 --> 01:33:16,518
I guess that's all.
I just thought you might want to know.

1144
01:33:19,208 --> 01:33:20,353
Mr. Levinson,

1145
01:33:22,377 --> 01:33:23,686
we're not perfect.

1146
01:33:39,625 --> 01:33:41,032
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

1147
01:33:41,513 --> 01:33:42,626
Fisher.

1148
01:33:44,329 --> 01:33:45,507
Sergeant.

1149
01:33:45,737 --> 01:33:48,704
I... I owe you an apology.

1150
01:33:50,089 --> 01:33:52,991
Wow. Thank you.

1151
01:33:55,626 --> 01:33:58,626
I got a question for you, though.
Just hypothetical.

1152
01:33:59,241 --> 01:34:01,958
If you were going to go out
and shoot to kill someone,

1153
01:34:02,057 --> 01:34:05,603
wouldn't you do it with a fully-loaded gun?
Just to be on the safe side?

1154
01:34:05,706 --> 01:34:08,705
I've never gone out to shoot to kill someone.

1155
01:34:09,706 --> 01:34:12,073
Well, maybe you could explain to me
why Boyd showed up

1156
01:34:12,170 --> 01:34:14,504
with only two bullets in that gun of his.

1157
01:34:14,698 --> 01:34:16,258
What are you getting at?

1158
01:34:16,362 --> 01:34:19,013
It's just a little strange to me.

1159
01:34:20,938 --> 01:34:22,848
Well, I guess it doesn't matter.

1160
01:34:23,274 --> 01:34:26,208
It's something to think about. See you.

1161
01:34:26,826 --> 01:34:27,939
See you.
