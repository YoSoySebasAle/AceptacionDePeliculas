1
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:51,230
Have a shot, kid.
A little nerve tonic.

2
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,818
I'm not nervous, Cragie.
I just gotta take a leak.

3
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:59,863
- Then do it now.
- On some poor bastard's grave?

4
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,281
What do you give a shit?

5
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:05,786
If someone was smart, they'd rip out
these graves and plant tomatoes.

6
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,664
These people are no good.
They're dead.

7
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:28,350
Say, hey, Cub fans.

8
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,686
Baby, I sure hope
you all are down there...

9
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:33,313
'cause we got the big game today.

10
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,690
Today is our day, baby.

11
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,659
Dig this, man.

12
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,744
All you cats on the home team,
listen up.

13
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,580
Spider's getting ready
to make the big play.

14
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:54,293
If you mothers drop that ball,
the Spider's--

15
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,882
- What's happening, Doc?
- There you are.

16
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,802
You take too fucking long.
Every day you're late.

17
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:10,017
- Get your ass in the car.
-  I got everything we need.

18
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,769
- Got a million places to go.
-  Let's get out of here.

19
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:17,733
- They'll be waiting.
- Okay, home team, ready in the bullpen.

20
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,902
Covering you, shortstop.
Double play. We'll get the nut.

21
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:28,410
- Center's in.
- Where's Cragie?

22
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:33,040
- Talk to me, left field.
- Damn it. Left field is in position.

23
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,167
Okay, guys,
run around first base.

24
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,045
- Double play, you got them in sight?
-  Yeah, we got the eyes on them.

25
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:40,505
- He's heading for the alley.
-  What the fuck is this?

26
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:44,885
I get up early. This guy has my nose
in his pocket at 6:30 in the morning.

27
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:48,013
I come around these funky
neighborhoods. I'm sick of it.

28
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:53,268
I've been on the phone three days.
I'm glad to get out, though.

29
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:56,396
You can't tell nobody
about this kind of stress.

30
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:57,689
How's somebody gonna relate?

31
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:05,947
All right, boys, here we go.

32
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:10,035
Nice and easy.
Nice and easy.

33
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,170
Leave a space
for the good guys.

34
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:23,298
I ain't ever letting her
out of my sight.

35
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,847
This is lovely. Look at this.
The other guys went to Brazil.

36
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:35,644
Took 12 people for a party.
This is my vacation. Ain't this nice?

37
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:43,068
- Spider, this ain't my style.
-  I can dig it, baby.

38
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,904
It's too much like real work
even for me.

39
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:50,492
You'll have everything you want
in two hours. All the action you need.

40
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,037
Trick or treat, smell my feet.

41
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,469
Come on, baby.

42
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:12,973
- Back off.
- Come on, baby.

43
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:16,852
- Do your thing, Pancho.
- Hey, man, we're clean.

44
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,271
- You think we're goddamn fools?
- Watch it.

45
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,400
- Don't you know these guys, Spider?
- We ought to get married.

46
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:28,113
We just want to do a little business.
Does this guy speak English?

47
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:33,702
-  Fuck, this is routine.
-  I can't believe this.

48
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:39,082
- Do this every fucking time.
- I should have taken a Valium.

49
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,170
Found you a present.

50
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:45,088
These things will test your head.

51
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:50,385
- I know these people, trust me.

52
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,528
I like the way it sounds.
Where's that money?

53
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:11,406
That's mine until it's yours.

54
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,756
I don't like people
that don't want to shake my hand.

55
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,719
I don't care where they come from.
I don't give a fuck what they represent.

56
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:36,765
I don't dig motherfuckers
that don't shake my hand.

57
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:51,238
- Come on, Eenie. Move your ass.
- What are those guys up to?

58
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:54,074
They're going to work.
What do you think?

59
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:57,285
- Let's go.
-  At this hour?

60
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,371
Don't worry about it.
Let it roll.

61
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:03,291
They got a hard-ass for a boss,
like us.

62
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:11,925
I just want to get out of here
real quick with my deal...

63
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,971
and I want to find out
what's going on here today.

64
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,246
Holy Christ.

65
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,956
Told you this was
the right place.

66
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,207
Scares me shitless.

67
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:50,672
- Tell him that's a nice decoration.
- Watch it.

68
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,216
Cool it, man.
Forget about that man's old lady.

69
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,719
Give me a break, man.

70
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,988
- Victor's got the best.
- The best.

71
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:19,117
You Comacho dudes are too much.
I can't believe you guys.

72
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:25,582
This really looks all right.
I feel some rocks up in here.

73
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,501
- Gonna make a lot of people very happy.
-  Damn right it's good.

74
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:35,967
By the numbers.

75
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:40,388
I know they got a good reputation.
I'm just doing this because...

76
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,182
my people expect me to do this.

77
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,434
I'm not trying to insult the guy.

78
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,523
He said you got
diarrhea of the mouth, baby.

79
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:54,444
Tell him that's too bad.
I thought he had more class than that.

80
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:57,030
That's the color I need.
Let's go.

81
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,615
How's that?

82
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,828
Everybody, get ready.

83
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,966
Right field is clear
if those painters are out of the way.

84
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,301
What are you talking about?

85
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:21,096
A crew of painters
went into the building next door.

86
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:24,683
- They're gonna wreck that building.
- Call them in.

87
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,310
- Let's move! Move!

88
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:40,073
Like I told you, Vic,
you can always depend on the Spider.

89
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,533
Go!

90
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,738
Get the door, Cragie.

91
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,493
Move it!

92
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:29,330
The plank! Let's go! Out!

93
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:39,549
Sh.

94
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,389
In the bag!

95
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,604
Get it in there!
Get the girl!

96
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,857
Let's get going! Come on!

97
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,225
Forget him!
We're out of here!

98
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,403
-  Got one in the hallway!
-  Up against the wall. Let's go.

99
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,365
They're going out the front!

100
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,590
Come on! Come on!

101
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,770
- Shit!
- Just get in here!

102
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,566
- Go, go, go!

103
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,034
Motherfucking son of a bitch!

104
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,120
Damn it!

105
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,268
Cragie! Cragie?

106
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:58,479
It's okay. I got the son of a bitch.
Cover the stairs.

107
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,339
Jesus.

108
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:30,094
Citywide units,
we have an officer shot.

109
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,221
Request for additional ambulances.

110
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,058
Several gunshot victims.
Use caution.

111
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,769
There are plainclothes units
on the scene. Zone-free radio.

112
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,687
- Damn.

113
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,402
I told you to stay in there.

114
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:51,449
- Take it easy, Kopalas.
- Sarge--

115
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,409
The kid didn't dust him.

116
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:57,622
I did. Him or me, Sarge.

117
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:03,628
The kid saw the whole thing.
Tell him, Nick.

118
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,386
Yeah, that's what happened.

119
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,518
Stay here, Cragie.

120
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,533
Keep this clear.

121
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,251
Did you Miranda that guy?

122
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:49,132
Come on, don't do that.
Do you know how much these things cost?

123
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,468
Eddie, listen to this.

124
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,303
A bait shop.

125
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,264
We get some worms, some minnows.

126
00:16:56,432 --> 00:17:00,935
We don't even have to get real worms.
We'll get those rubber ones.

127
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:15,450
You goddamn Dr. Jekyl!
He's a butcher.

128
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,337
You know, Sarge, I don't think
these guys know who their friends are.

129
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:29,714
I'm tired of this shit.

130
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:36,137
Efren, what's gonna happen to you
when Luis comes up from Bogota, huh?

131
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,805
I'll tell you what will happen.

132
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:41,976
Your asses will be freeze-dried
and fried. Your goose is cooked.

133
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:45,063
You must know who did it!
Who'd you fuck over lately?

134
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,564
- Luis ain't gonna like it--

135
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,858
You want a tune-up, fuckface?

136
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:53,696
Sarge, you know why a Comacho
is like a cue ball?

137
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:58,785
The harder you hit them, the better
the English gets. You want to play pool?

138
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,456
Save it, Brennan.

139
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,504
Book them.

140
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,384
Come on, talk to me.

141
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,013
What do you know?

142
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,606
- What about Vito and Eenie?
-  Keep your eyes closed.

143
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,442
- Come on.

144
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,735
Come on.

145
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,446
-  Yeah. All right.
- Ready?

146
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,365
Now open.

147
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:39,826
Oh!

148
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:43,371
- Happy birthday, Mom.
- I'm so glad you're here.

149
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,706
- Happy birthday, Molly.
- Molly.

150
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:51,087
Molly, come here. Come on.

151
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:57,718
Pack me a bag for the lake.
Come on, I'm in a hurry!

152
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,388
- But why?
- Business.

153
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,057
Move. Do what I tell you.

154
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,685
Papa.

155
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,694
- Don't do it, Mama.
- Hey, none of your lip today!

156
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,536
I cannot believe you.

157
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:24,954
Nothing's changed.

158
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,790
Today is Mom's birthday.
She deserves better than this,

159
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,750
- and so do we.

160
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:38,885
Tony, sorry I'm late.
Got stuck in traffic.

161
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,595
Picked up something nice.

162
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:45,099
Fucking Victor Comacho's alive.
Vito and Eenie are dead.

163
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,476
Jesus Christ.
You pulled that hit?

164
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:50,354
-  Don't go, Diana.
- I can't stay here, Grandma.

165
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:54,192
You put somebody on the house,
and you look after her.

166
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,069
You gone fucking crazy?
You're starting a war.

167
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,529
You're putting the whole outfit
on the line.

168
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,948
They're probably out looking
to start your uncle right now.

169
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:04,911
Keep your mouth shut! What Mr. Scalese
don't know, won't hurt him!

170
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,126
Happy birthday.

171
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,386
Cragie, you're assigned to headquarters
until the hearing.

172
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:26,390
Hearing?
Who called for a hearing?

173
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,936
That goddamn little punk tried
to shoot me in the back!

174
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:33,940
Sit down.

175
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,864
-  Lucy Partida.
- That Commie piece of shit?

176
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:47,703
Shut up! Partida demanded
a formal hearing. You'll be under oath.

177
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:50,998
The department will provide you
with a lawyer unless you got one.

178
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,335
A Citizens Review Board member
is waiting to talk to you.

179
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:57,004
Doesn't sound like
you've got anything to worry about.

180
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,592
Kopalas, you work with Cusack
until this is over.

181
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:03,302
Yes, sir.

182
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,972
All right, that will be all.

183
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,018
Thank you, sir.

184
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:20,444
- Where did they take Dorato?
- County. He'll be okay.

185
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:24,865
Listen, I don't have time
to nursemaid a rookie.

186
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,701
- I don't need a partner.
- That's right.

187
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,829
You don't need a partner.
You need a goddamn keeper!

188
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:33,582
Jesus Christ, how do I explain
this one downtown?

189
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,168
We gave you 600 man-hours.

190
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:39,672
You took a month to plan the thing,
and what do you have to show for it?

191
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:45,094
Eight bodies, one dead informant,
one of my best men shot!

192
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:49,015
You'll have me back on the beat,
busting perverts in the park.

193
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,642
We've got a bigger problem.

194
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,603
This Luis Comacho is crazy.

195
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,314
He won't take this lying down.

196
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,899
That's all I need:
a goddamn war.

197
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,235
What about this business
with Cragie?

198
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,071
You know what I think of Cragie.

199
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,991
All right,
I'll deal with downtown.

200
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,661
You find out who burned
the Comachos before they do.

201
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:13,748
Kates.

202
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:16,000
Eddie, you had a good setup.

203
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,918
Too bad it went to hell.

204
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,588
Yeah.

205
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:32,767
Luis, the war does no good
for any of us.

206
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,812
It can only make what's bad
worse.

207
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:41,317
Get them out of here,
and fix them up.

208
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:44,820
I want them beautiful
for their mother.

209
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:52,578
My brothers,
I promise you blood for blood.

210
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:13,557
How you doing, Sarge?

211
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,144
I really appreciate your help.

212
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:20,064
It's quite all right.

213
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,316
It's so overwhelming.

214
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,447
Hey, I'd like to talk to you.

215
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,376
One day I would like
to give you a gift...

216
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,378
of a Colombian necktie.

217
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,589
Very special.

218
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,175
You slit the throat,
pull out the tongue.

219
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:53,347
And on you,
it would look beautiful.

220
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,516
Why don't you give it to me
right now?

221
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,853
Come. We're running late.

222
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:08,404
Eddie, you better grow eyes
in the back of your head.

223
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,573
Come on! Good shot again.

224
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,658
That's it.
Keep going. Keep it up.

225
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:16,203
- Come on. Good combination.

226
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:17,913
Come on, Eddie.

227
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,373
Look out.

228
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,460
Come on. Again.

229
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,378
He's running.

230
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,922
- Shit! Ah, man.
- You okay?

231
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:33,345
Out of my way, you side of beef.
Hey, partner.

232
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,891
I'm all right, man.

233
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,438
- How's the foot?
-  Swinging. Listen to this.

234
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:46,317
Two g's, we open up a beef
and sausage stand outside Wrigley Field.

235
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,028
You dish out the beef.
I take in the cash.

236
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:52,740
Free games.
I have a contact downtown.

237
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,659
How can we watch the games
if we're hawking hot dogs?

238
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,247
I never thought of that.

239
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:03,792
Davis, I want
to have a word with you, man.

240
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,546
Amano, when you're through playing
with that, I want to talk to you.

241
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,716
Joey, I want you to
help me get some signatures

242
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,219
- on this petition for Cragie.
-  Yeah, no problem.

243
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:16,180
I figured
on the 14th at lunchtime.

244
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,473
Sure.

245
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:23,771
Beautiful.

246
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:27,691
Gus, put that thing down
and sit up for a minute.

247
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,404
I want you to sign this.
It's for Cragie. All right?

248
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,823
Attention all senior personnel.

249
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:37,743
There will be a demonstration
of the Prowler tactical assist robot...

250
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,995
at 1600 hours.

251
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:43,374
- Your attendance is required.
- Good shot, Eddie.

252
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:48,295
Cusack, how about taking the gloves off
long enough to sign this for Cragie?

253
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,548
- Is it about the hearing?
-  You bet.

254
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:55,135
- I pass.
- What the fuck's the matter with you?

255
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,473
He's burned out, Brennan.
You know it.

256
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:03,644
Get off your high horse.
He made a couple mistakes.

257
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,020
The man was a hero.

258
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:07,147
What do a bunch of civilians know...

259
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:09,942
about coming up some shithouse staircase
scared out of your shorts?

260
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,365
They only know
we're supposed to protect them.

261
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:20,077
If Cragie doesn't get off the streets,
he'll kill somebody else...

262
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,870
or he'll get somebody killed.

263
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,914
Maybe even you, Brennan.

264
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:28,877
Thanks a lot, Sarge.
You're a real prince.

265
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:31,088
Here we go.
Come on, good shot.

266
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,548
Come on, one more time,
Eddie.

267
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,926
The Prowler's
standard weapons complement...

268
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:39,013
includes one recoilless rifle...

269
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,348
two Mark-19 grenade launchers...

270
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:44,685
and twin 50-caliber machine guns.

271
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:47,187
I have sufficient firepower
to neutralize...

272
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:50,024
a wide variety
of security threats.

273
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:54,612
As you can see, this lightweight
handheld control unit enables you...

274
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,405
to direct my movements...

275
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:59,867
while simultaneously operating
the various weapons systems...

276
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:03,203
in manual or full-automatic mode.

277
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:08,250
In full-automatic mode, my infrared
heat sensors and Doppler radar...

278
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:11,086
mean that I am able to acquire
moving targets at night...

279
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,797
without assistance
from the operator.

280
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,508
That concludes
the program demonstration.

281
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:20,471
Now our factory representative
will discuss the features...

282
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:24,183
of the simplified Mark-2
handheld control system.

283
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,226
After the gyros are locked...

284
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:30,439
any movement of the hand controller
is duplicated by the Prowler.

285
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:35,444
The simple control system means even
semiskilled employees can operate--

286
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:38,656
He's talking about you, Cusack,
so pay attention.

287
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:41,909
You've all got to qualify on this.
It's the future.

288
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,787
As they say,
even a child can operate it.

289
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:49,875
You're looking at the perfect cop.
The damn thing follows orders.

290
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,836
Another gun without a brain.

291
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:56,799
The machine guns can be linked to
the laser range and guidance system...

292
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:59,009
for target orientation.

293
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,804
If the commander would like
to pick someone to elude Prowler...

294
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:05,182
I'll show you
our target acquisition system.

295
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,060
Halt. Police.
Throw down your weapon.

296
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:12,272
We will not harm you. Please place
your hands above your head.

297
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,109
- Drop it.
- You are under arrest.

298
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:18,529
Please do not resist.
Thank you for your cooperation.

299
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:46,473
Eenie Verona
is the gentleman's name.

300
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:49,143
Looks like you did
a hell of a job on him.

301
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:52,646
- Know him?
- Yeah, he's just a punk thief.

302
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:56,859
- Looks like he graduated.
- He sure flunked house painting.

303
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:58,652
He had an uncle.

304
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,656
Served time together.
What the hell's his name?

305
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,492
- Gagleoni?
- Gamiani.

306
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,912
Gamiani. I think we should
get to know him better.

307
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:15,395
This Gamiani
is a real swinger, huh?

308
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,652
- Good-bye.
- Take it easy, baby.

309
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,445
I'll be back real quick.

310
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,280
Here we go.

311
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:13,120
He's the most active one.

312
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,873
He's got great eyes, doesn't he?

313
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,333
- What about the lion over there?
- Yeah.

314
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,462
Look at that one
standing up by the cage.

315
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,715
He's trying to figure out
what we're doing.

316
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,133
- Yeah.

317
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:31,013
His pretty white breast.

318
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,015
Isn't that pretty?
Is that a leopard?

319
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,155
- I'll be back in a second, okay?
- Okay.

320
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,741
Kind of young for that old guy,
don't you think?

321
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:54,161
What's going on?
Eddie, this isn't panning out.

322
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:57,289
Why don't you watch, kid?
Learn something.

323
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:05,172
- What are you doing here?
- Your papa worries.

324
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,925
Get out of here, Lou,
and leave me alone.

325
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:11,637
Come on.
Let's go see the ducks.

326
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:13,472
I don't want to see the ducks.

327
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,182
What's wrong with ducks?

328
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,260
Yeah, come on.

329
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:54,513
-  Hey!
- Hi!

330
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,014
Hey, guys!

331
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,399
Diana, thanks again!

332
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:41,328
-  What's so funny?

333
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,164
Enough already.

334
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:47,626
We're following them,
they're following her...

335
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,504
and nobody knows nothing.

336
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:51,797
-  Come on.

337
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:54,007
Let's find out something.

338
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,218
Stay here.

339
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,822
God.

340
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:33,964
- How are you?
- Congratulations.

341
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:37,717
I'm glad you made it.
Excuse me, this is Mrs. Wilson.

342
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:41,096
- This is my friend, Diana.
- Nice to meet you.

343
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,598
- This must be a lucky break then.
-  It is.

344
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:46,518
I just sold my first piece
to Mrs. Wilson here.

345
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:49,354
Terrific.
I like your new stuff.

346
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:52,274
Especially the dead dog series.
When did you do that? It's great.

347
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,571
Hello. Would you like
some hors d'oeuvres?

348
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,325
- Bye-bye.
- Thanks for stopping by.

349
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,703
I'll see you downstairs later.

350
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,913
He is really a character.

351
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:09,416
She's a great girl.
I'd love to help.

352
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:12,294
We should set up a date,
and I'll help you hang it.

353
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:14,588
I'd be delighted.

354
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:17,716
Excuse me.

355
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:21,052
Who was that girl you were talking to
in the black slacks?

356
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,430
- I think I know her.
- Diana Luna.

357
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:50,123
- You understand it?
- Sure. Don't you?

358
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,667
Mm-mm.

359
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,921
I'm Eddie Cusack.

360
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:03,303
- I'd make it Eddie the cop.
- That obvious, huh?

361
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:10,477
Listen, I don't know where my father is,
and I don't give a damn.

362
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:14,439
I have nothing to do
with my father's business...

363
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:16,733
Uncle Scalese's business
or any of it.

364
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,985
So why don't you leave me alone?

365
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,243
It was nice meeting you.

366
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,748
I thought I was feeling good,
but--

367
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:35,001
Happy? Whoo!

368
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,628
You bet!

369
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:40,715
- Can I use your phone?
- Yeah. Right over there.

370
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:44,844
Whoo!

371
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,933
Whoo!

372
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,561
Kobas, this is Sergeant Cusack.

373
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:56,690
I want a team to cover a house
on the southwest side.

374
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:59,401
Luna. L-u-n-a. Anthony.

375
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:02,237
Yeah, Crazy Tony Luna.

376
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:05,699
I don't know if he's around,
but if he shows up bring him in.

377
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:06,908
Thanks.

378
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,417
Catch you later.

379
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:20,297
That's a very nice choice.

380
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,861
Oh, yeah.

381
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,656
Hey, you comfortable?

382
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,908
They're wasting the show.

383
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:54,914
- Tony's not even in town.
- They'll get the word.

384
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:58,918
Mrs. Luna,
come away from the window.

385
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,946
- How about yourself?
- Don't worry about me.

386
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:30,867
- I'll take care of him.
- Take care.

387
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:38,875
Wait here.

388
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:44,798
- I can back you up.
- Stay by the radio.

389
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,345
-  Felix, you all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

390
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:04,150
Get me yesterday's numbers
on Phoenix, huh?

391
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:14,536
What are you doing here?

392
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,249
Off, asshole.

393
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,842
Cusack.

394
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:36,850
The modern age's answer
to the crystal ball.

395
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:40,145
Marvelous,
if you know how to read it.

396
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,857
If you've got some extra cash,
buy oranges.

397
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:48,403
The price is low, and I can promise you
there will be a trucking strike.

398
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:49,946
Is that a bribe, Mr. Scalese?

399
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:52,866
It's a prediction.

400
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:54,200
Nah.

401
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,494
I wouldn't try
to bribe Eddie Cusack.

402
00:40:57,329 --> 00:41:00,457
They tell me you're incorruptible,
untarnished.

403
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:03,710
I hear they call you Stainless Steel
on the street.

404
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,880
Me? I think you're
a pain in the ass.

405
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:09,799
I'm looking for one
of your nephews.

406
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,597
Tony Luna.

407
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:17,682
Good-bye, Mr. Cusack.

408
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:21,060
There's a shitstorm coming, old man,
and you can stop it.

409
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:23,396
Good-bye, Mr. Cusack.

410
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:29,569
- Nobody talks, right?
- That's right, Sergeant.

411
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:33,656
Just like the cops.
Just like the Comachos.

412
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,909
Nobody talks.

413
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,008
I'll find Tony Luna...

414
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:56,763
and I'll nail his ass
and anyone else connected to him.

415
00:41:56,931 --> 00:42:00,141
- You got that?
- You punk!

416
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:02,143
Nobody threatens me.

417
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,103
It's not a threat.

418
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:06,940
Ohh!

419
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,236
It's a prediction.

420
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:21,412
Roger, Homicide.
We're at Lincoln Park Conservatory.

421
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:24,457
Victim is a male Caucasian.
Multiple knife wounds.

422
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:27,710
Coroner's on the scene.
Request for laboratory backup.

423
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:41,057
Tony Luna's bagman.

424
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,895
They call that a Colombian necktie.

425
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:50,358
They found Tony's restaurant manager
hanging from a meat hook in the kitchen.

426
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,694
Looked like someone tried
to carve a canoe out of him.

427
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:56,155
Tony's used car lot on Ashland
is burning as we speak.

428
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:59,993
- Head salesman is fried zucchini.
-  Jesus.

429
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,120
It's starting.

430
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,664
- Let's go.

431
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,601
-  Good morning, Mrs. Luna.
- Good morning.

432
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:28,354
Don't the eggplants
look wonderful?

433
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,362
They're all over
the place;

434
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:19,155
in the house and out in the street.

435
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:20,573
Looks like a war zone.

436
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,867
-  How many victims, 10-21?
- Five so far.

437
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:25,495
Four adult females, one adult male;
all Caucasian.

438
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:30,458
This is Cusack. Was there a girl,
late teens, brownish hair?

439
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:33,503
Negative. We got four adult
females pretty chewed up.

440
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,546
The youngest looks about 40.

441
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:37,882
What kind of people
are these guys?

442
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:50,395
What's it about?

443
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,355
I'm not going.
I don't have to go.

444
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:56,025
Your mother got killed.
Take it easy.

445
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:58,236
Just put your jacket on.

446
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:00,947
Let's get out of here.

447
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:10,790
Stick with me.

448
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:08,681
Run.

449
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:27,283
Stay here.

450
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:32,682
Cut the chica.

451
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:33,933
Angel!

452
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:36,602
Let her go.

453
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:40,565
Take out your weapons.

454
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:42,525
Left hand.

455
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:48,114
Up against the wall.
Move it!

456
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,993
You heard me, Angel.

457
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,203
Diana, come here.

458
00:47:56,748 --> 00:48:00,543
- Back!

459
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,087
Let her go.

460
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:15,308
Eddie!

461
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:28,487
Come on!

462
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:33,844
Wait.

463
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:36,681
Whoa.

464
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,854
-  Angel!

465
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:53,030
One more step,
I'll cut her head off!

466
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:55,533
Give it up.

467
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,540
Get your ass up.

468
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:31,212
Shit!

469
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:45,226
No! No!

470
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:22,865
Is it true?

471
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:28,787
Yeah.

472
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:01,487
Keep your goddamn pants on.

473
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:07,993
Eddie, what the hell is going on?
Come on in.

474
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:18,212
Fred Pirelli, Diana Luna.

475
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:21,340
Hi, kid.

476
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:27,179
She won't go into protective custody,
and I couldn't leave her alone.

477
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:32,768
I hate putting you on the spot
like this.

478
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:36,188
I spent 30 years "on the spot."

479
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,149
Can you put her up
until I find her old man?

480
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:42,069
Whatever you need.

481
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:46,865
Brennan, I heard you're
gonna retire when you sober up.

482
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:49,535
In that case, I'll never retire.

483
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:53,038
Dorato, you only have to buy one boot.
You're getting off cheap.

484
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:55,082
Are you serious?
I'm sick about it.

485
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:58,294
These boots were handmade in Italy.
They cost me 17.50...

486
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:00,129
- with the police discount.

487
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:03,590
Hey, Eddie.
Yeah, it's me.

488
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:05,092
Yeah.

489
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:08,345
Why don't you come by
and tip a few?

490
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:11,181
Come on. Come on.

491
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:13,892
Have a few beers with me.
It will do you good.

492
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,978
- Aw, come--

493
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:18,188
Do I know--?
I know it's late.

494
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:22,901
Hey, Eddie,

495
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:24,820
I have to talk to you.

496
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:32,745
Yeah, at Mike's.

497
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,956
All right, great.
Thanks, pal.

498
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:48,969
What the fuck
are you doing?

499
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:52,723
Try and relax, Flash.

500
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:55,768
This will be a slide, man.
Easy in, easy out.

501
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:57,436
Piece of cake, man.
Nothing to it.

502
00:55:57,604 --> 00:56:01,190
German fucking chocolate.
You got it.

503
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:03,275
- Sure you checked it out?
- Trust me.

504
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:05,944
- Are you sure?
- You know the drill.

505
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:08,364
- I go to the back, you go to the bar.
- Right.

506
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:11,075
You order a drink.
What will you order?

507
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:14,453
- What's the difference?
- You have to know what you're ordering.

508
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,121
You're making me nervous.

509
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:18,791
- Relax. Have a toothpick.
- Fuck a toothpick.

510
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:20,751
Let's go get some money.

511
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:37,976
You ought to crash, babe.

512
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:39,895
You had a heck of a day.

513
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:43,357
- How you doing?
-  How are you?

514
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,487
Hurry up. I got a lot of women
who want to sign it.

515
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:51,323
- It's a piece of art.
- It's a piece of shit.

516
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,158
- Just don't become a ballerina.
- Yeah.

517
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:13,929
What's up?

518
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:25,274
- How you doing?
- Open house tonight.

519
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:29,486
Give me a Black Russian
and a Courvoisier.

520
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:32,072
Straight up.

521
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:39,371
Where's all the dancing girls,
shaving their legs?

522
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:56,013
All right, get your hands up,
motherfuckers!

523
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:59,057
Which of you two guys
is the brains of the outfit?

524
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:03,187
You stupid motherfucker.
Dumb cocksucker.

525
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:05,230
Bring that piece of shit over here.

526
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:07,399
- Come here.
- Worm brain motherfucker!

527
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:10,736
Spread them.
Kiss the bar.

528
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:12,988
Old lady told me he was fucked-up
in the head. Do I listen?

529
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:16,992
"Gonna be a piece of cake, man.
Nothing to it. Gonna be a slide, man."

530
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,996
- Should have listened to my old lady.
- Screw her. Everybody else has.

531
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:25,417
- Cuff them and get them out of here.
- Give me your paw.

532
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:26,919
They get dumber every day.

533
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:29,880
Just let her get some sleep.

534
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:32,257
That's what I need too.

535
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:35,844
-  Get some and take care.
-  I'll call you tomorrow.

536
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:47,231
- Here's some tea.
- Thanks.

537
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:07,125
What do you do
if you don't have someone?

538
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:13,006
You find someone.

539
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:18,095
Will you hold me?

540
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:30,440
You'll be fine.

541
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:37,823
I'll see you tomorrow.

542
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:44,496
You're lucky my hands are cuffed.

543
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:46,498
I'll kick your ass,
handcuffed or not.

544
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:49,710
- You'd be black and blue.
- You can't, man.

545
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:51,628
Shoot me, so I don't have to listen
to him anymore.

546
00:59:51,796 --> 00:59:53,630
- Hey, man--
- Shut up.

547
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:57,384
- You think you're John Wayne?
- I'll make you Jane Wayne.

548
00:59:57,552 --> 01:00:01,430
-  Who ordered the Courvoisier?
- Hi, Sarge.

549
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,056
Hey, Sarge.

550
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:07,185
- What's this?
- These morons tried to rob us.

551
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:09,771
We called the station
45 minutes ago for a wagon.

552
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:12,316
They didn't believe us.
They thought we were kidding.

553
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:14,776
Eddie, partner, come here.

554
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:20,157
How you doing?
I want you to meet two friends of mine.

555
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:23,869
This is Ruby, a dental hygienist.
Very oral.

556
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:28,373
Marlene here works for a proctologist.
Don't turn your back on her.

557
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:31,084
Have a drink.
I have a proposition for you.

558
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:32,210
Later.

559
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:34,796
Let me plant two words
in your brain:

560
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,715
alligator farming.

561
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:40,385
- "Alligator farming"?
- Yeah.

562
01:00:40,553 --> 01:00:42,095
Yeah.

563
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:45,057
It'll work.

564
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:54,399
Thanks.

565
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:59,112
- How's the girl?
- She's fine.

566
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:03,367
That fucker.
Why is he down here?

567
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:05,202
- Want a beer?
- Nah.

568
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:08,246
Val, give me
another Southern Comfort.

569
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:14,836
I really want to be a good cop.

570
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:18,507
Sometimes I get so scared, you know?

571
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:22,260
- Only a fool doesn't get scared.
- It's so easy for you.

572
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:25,222
You got all the answers.

573
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:30,394
For me, I don't know.

574
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:46,201
Cragie planted the gun
on that kid.

575
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:51,957
He just wasted him,
blew him away...

576
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:55,836
and I went
right along with it.

577
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:59,089
My partner.

578
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:04,302
I don't know what I'm gonna do
about that hearing tomorrow.

579
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:08,014
Tell the truth.

580
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:15,647
See? You make it sound so easy.

581
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:19,609
I got a wife and a kid...

582
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:22,612
and you're telling me
to commit suicide.

583
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:26,324
How am I supposed to live with these
guys if I sell out my own partner?

584
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:27,659
And if you don't?

585
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:34,875
- Cragie gets away with it.
- And the chance to do it again.

586
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:37,294
It was a mistake.
It was an accident.

587
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:41,173
- That kid was killed because of it.
- Don't you think I know it?

588
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:53,393
I see that boy's face
every time I close my eyes.

589
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:57,731
Tell it like it is, Nick.

590
01:02:59,066 --> 01:03:00,817
I'll back you up.

591
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:10,160
- See you guys later.
-  Yeah, Eddie.

592
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:12,245
Look what's here.

593
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:15,040
Nice to see you out with the boys
for a change.

594
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:16,291
Cragie.

595
01:03:17,084 --> 01:03:19,920
They tell me my sergeant
wouldn't sign for me.

596
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:23,632
- Want to tell me why?
- You know why.

597
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:25,884
No, tell me.

598
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:28,136
Mister, you don't belong
on the streets anymore.

599
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:30,806
Fuck you.
Where do you get off?

600
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:33,308
Right about here.

601
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:39,564
Good night, Sarge.

602
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:43,276
If it was dark, Officer...

603
01:03:43,444 --> 01:03:45,111
how were you sure Vega had a gun?

604
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:49,574
We got lucky. There was a glint of light
reflecting off the weapon's barrel.

605
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:53,954
Officer Cragie,
you have heard Mrs. Munoz's testimony.

606
01:03:54,121 --> 01:03:55,539
Yes, ma'am.

607
01:03:55,706 --> 01:03:57,958
You heard her tell this panel
that she saw you...

608
01:03:58,125 --> 01:04:00,043
lay the gun
in her grandson's hand.

609
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:02,921
I'm not saying
the woman made this up...

610
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:07,008
but there's no way she could see
anything from where she was standing...

611
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:08,885
in a hallway that dark.

612
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,805
Like you said,
she's the boy's grandmother.

613
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:28,029
Young lady, you are about
to have the house specialty:

614
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:30,073
Eggs Pirelli.

615
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:33,660
You got your protein,
carbohydrates...

616
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:36,705
vitamin D, vitamin C.

617
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:39,541
Good for you. Strength.
Eat now.

618
01:04:52,346 --> 01:04:54,681
- Eat.

619
01:04:57,852 --> 01:05:00,729
Right after you heard
Officer Cragie's gun discharge,

620
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,188
what did you do then?

621
01:05:02,356 --> 01:05:04,983
I immediately advanced
down the hall.

622
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:06,651
What did you see?

623
01:05:06,819 --> 01:05:09,988
The deceased, Vega...

624
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:11,656
lying on the floor.

625
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:13,909
Officer Cragie
was checking his vital signs.

626
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:16,077
What happened then?

627
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:20,206
We recovered a .25-caliber automatic
from the teenager's right hand.

628
01:05:20,374 --> 01:05:24,836
Did you see that weapon in Vega's hand
before Officer Cragie fired?

629
01:05:27,381 --> 01:05:28,673
Yes, ma'am.

630
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:31,509
No more questions.

631
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:36,765
You made that uniform look good.

632
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,016
That guy next to me--

633
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:42,687
Handsome devil, huh?
That's Eddie's dad.

634
01:05:42,855 --> 01:05:45,440
Better than a good cop.

635
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:49,611
He was killed
in the line of duty, '71.

636
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:53,531
- An accident.

637
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:28,650
- What do you want?
- Gas company.

638
01:06:31,278 --> 01:06:33,238
-  How you doing?

639
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:37,534
I can't comment on that.
It was over before I got there.

640
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:39,786
Aren't you his superior officer?

641
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:42,122
Cragie's in my unit, yes.

642
01:06:42,289 --> 01:06:45,291
Did you request that Officer Cragie
be on your team?

643
01:06:45,459 --> 01:06:47,919
- I did not.
-  Sergeant...

644
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:52,173
I have here a department document
dated 24 September of last year.

645
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:56,928
It is a request by you to have Officer
Cragie transferred to another unit.

646
01:06:57,096 --> 01:07:00,306
- Are you familiar with this document?
- I am.

647
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:02,892
Why did you request this transfer?

648
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:10,275
Thirty years is too long for anyone to
look at the city's guts, Mrs. Partida.

649
01:07:10,609 --> 01:07:13,278
Are you saying Officer Cragie
is not fit...

650
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:15,447
to work the streets of Chicago?

651
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:20,702
That's what I'm saying.

652
01:07:23,581 --> 01:07:26,416
Come on, lady.
Give the guy a break.

653
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:39,554
- Fuck me? No, fuck you.
- Why are you arguing with him?

654
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:43,099
He didn't want me on tactical.

655
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:56,154
Operator, please check 555-6610 for me.

656
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:59,282
Seems to me the man
has his tongue stuck to his asshole.

657
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:02,410
That don't bother him.
He's the fucking white knight.

658
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:06,164
Sorry, the number is out of
service. I'll report it if you want.

659
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:09,667
You want to take on the world
by yourself?

660
01:08:09,835 --> 01:08:11,419
Now you'll get your chance.

661
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:41,366
We just got here, Sarge.

662
01:08:45,871 --> 01:08:49,958
- Wasn't he a friend of yours?
- More than a friend.

663
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:59,342
- Where's the girl?
- There was nobody else.

664
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:13,231
Squad, this is 1462.
I need backup.

665
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:17,569
Have 64 and 63 meet me at the billiard
parlor on 18th near Halsted.

666
01:09:17,736 --> 01:09:19,320
Ten-four, 1462.

667
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:26,327
-  1463, come in.
-  Brennan, chow time.

668
01:09:29,081 --> 01:09:33,042
1463, you've got
1462 requesting backup.

669
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:35,545
Meet him at the pool hall,
18th and Halsted.

670
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:42,093
Unit 1463 here. We can't respond.
We have a drug purchase in progress.

671
01:09:44,096 --> 01:09:45,430
You want to reassign that?

672
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:47,473
Can anybody assist
for 18th and Halsted?

673
01:09:47,641 --> 01:09:49,100
Got a one-man TAC team
going into a pool hall.

674
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:53,396
5447, we have a call from zone
10 for a backup.

675
01:09:53,564 --> 01:09:56,274
Tactical Sergeant 1462
needs assistance...

676
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:58,484
at the pool hall
at 18th and Halsted.

677
01:09:58,652 --> 01:10:01,279
Can you help him out?
He's a one-man unit.

678
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:04,324
We got a dead dog here
blocking traffic on Washington.

679
01:10:04,491 --> 01:10:06,701
We're waiting
for animal control.

680
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:09,454
We're tailing a
suspicious vehicle southbound on Wells.

681
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:12,248
Jack, do you have a backup
for 18th and Halsted?

682
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:15,168
You heard what happened.
Who the hell will back him up?

683
01:10:15,336 --> 01:10:19,923
- You're playing fucking games.
- If you want to respond, take a cab.

684
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:22,342
This car ain't going no place
for that son of a bitch!

685
01:10:22,509 --> 01:10:26,930
Zone 10, we're not
getting any help for car 62.

686
01:10:27,097 --> 01:10:30,225
Can somebody assist car 62?
He's alone.

687
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:32,810
- Zone 20?
-  You're breaking up here.

688
01:10:32,978 --> 01:10:35,313
We're going in
for a radio check.

689
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:57,168
You don't want to be in here.

690
01:10:57,336 --> 01:10:59,754
If I want your opinion,
I'll beat it out of you.

691
01:11:29,243 --> 01:11:30,368
Where is he?

692
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,834
I don't know what
you're talking about!

693
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:39,502
I want Luis, you fucking punk.

694
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:41,421
Get out of here.

695
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:56,561
Talk, asshole.

696
01:11:58,063 --> 01:12:00,315
He's on his way.

697
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:21,711
Who wants the first one? Hm?

698
01:12:25,382 --> 01:12:27,383
You, amigo?

699
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:32,096
How about you, huh?

700
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:50,782
Gun, cabron.

701
01:13:13,722 --> 01:13:14,722
Take him apart.

702
01:13:58,392 --> 01:14:00,017
Grab his legs!

703
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:03,020
Grab his legs!
Grab his legs!

704
01:14:03,188 --> 01:14:04,856
Grab his legs.

705
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:12,780
- Victor!

706
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:21,205
- Victor!

707
01:14:24,084 --> 01:14:25,501
Save him.

708
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:41,267
When the sun comes up,
you give me Luna...

709
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:43,561
or the girl dies...

710
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:45,855
slowly.

711
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:57,867
You don't understand, huh, Eddie?
I told you, man,

712
01:14:58,035 --> 01:15:00,578
don't fuck with the Comachos.

713
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:22,016
Eddie?

714
01:15:23,602 --> 01:15:24,894
Eddie?

715
01:15:26,438 --> 01:15:27,522
Eddie!

716
01:15:29,149 --> 01:15:30,733
Where the fuck is he?

717
01:15:43,997 --> 01:15:45,373
Cusack?!

718
01:15:52,464 --> 01:15:54,006
Hey, Eddie?

719
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:59,303
- Jesus Christ, are you all right?
-  I'll live.

720
01:15:59,471 --> 01:16:01,639
I'd have been here,
but those guys kept it from me.

721
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:03,808
I've been talking
to my friend, Maggie...

722
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:06,018
who works on a computer
at the Federal building.

723
01:16:06,186 --> 01:16:09,105
- You're going to die.
- They have Diana Luna.

724
01:16:09,273 --> 01:16:10,314
I'm trying to tell you...

725
01:16:10,482 --> 01:16:13,317
she got a wire that Tony Luna's
been laying down in Wisconsin...

726
01:16:13,485 --> 01:16:16,779
and he's coming in town tonight
at the Union Station at 10:00.

727
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:21,492
Hey, Eddie.

728
01:16:22,703 --> 01:16:24,078
Hey, Eddie!

729
01:17:14,504 --> 01:17:15,713
Hello, Uncle Felix.

730
01:17:17,215 --> 01:17:19,133
You're a bad boy, Tony.

731
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:22,887
I told you leave it alone,
but, no, you had to start this.

732
01:17:23,764 --> 01:17:25,056
You were always that way.

733
01:17:26,016 --> 01:17:28,726
You're like a kid.
You see something, you grab it.

734
01:17:32,105 --> 01:17:35,149
- Give it to me.
- For what?

735
01:17:44,576 --> 01:17:45,910
I'm only here to cooperate.

736
01:17:49,581 --> 01:17:51,415
There's someone with us, boss.

737
01:17:53,377 --> 01:17:54,794
Move it.

738
01:18:56,523 --> 01:18:58,482
This bitch is crazy!

739
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:02,945
Get rid of him!

740
01:19:16,835 --> 01:19:20,045
- Don't fuck with me, old man!
- Tony, we won't hurt you!

741
01:20:24,903 --> 01:20:28,364
You tell Luis,
I've got Tony Luna.

742
01:20:29,241 --> 01:20:31,033
I want a time and a place.

743
01:20:35,539 --> 01:20:36,914
Got it.

744
01:20:58,603 --> 01:21:01,438
Cusack, where are you going
with my car?

745
01:21:11,283 --> 01:21:12,867
Hello, my angel.

746
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:15,786
Have you had a nice night?

747
01:21:15,954 --> 01:21:17,955
I have wonderful news for you.

748
01:21:18,123 --> 01:21:21,083
- Look at me.
- Look at the man, huh?

749
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:24,545
Daddy's on his way.

750
01:21:25,839 --> 01:21:28,382
He's dead.

751
01:21:40,186 --> 01:21:43,147
Beautiful job.
Look at the way it came across.

752
01:21:43,315 --> 01:21:46,358
Watch. It will be a screen pass
to the right.

753
01:21:46,526 --> 01:21:48,319
Eddie, how are you?

754
01:21:49,321 --> 01:21:51,113
Eddie's a good guy.

755
01:22:14,512 --> 01:22:16,347
You're learning about football.

756
01:22:16,514 --> 01:22:19,058
To learn about me,
you'll have to learn about football.

757
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:48,545
I want two guys up there.

758
01:22:50,048 --> 01:22:52,549
- How many are up front?
- I got two up there.

759
01:22:52,717 --> 01:22:55,719
Make it four.
We'll be prepared for anything.

760
01:22:55,887 --> 01:22:57,846
I don't trust this son of a bitch.

761
01:22:58,014 --> 01:23:00,432
Victor, take the girl back.

762
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:05,729
- I have a present for Luna.
- I have two guys up the middle.

763
01:23:05,897 --> 01:23:08,565
That's great.
Efren, come with me.

764
01:23:45,061 --> 01:23:49,648
Victor, when this is over,
Luna goes back to Bogota with me.

765
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:11,670
I don't know.

766
01:24:11,838 --> 01:24:14,715
I was watching films with my girl,
and the next thing I know...

767
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:17,676
he locked the door
and took the truck.

768
01:24:17,844 --> 01:24:18,802
I don't know what happened.

769
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:20,429
What's going on?

770
01:24:20,597 --> 01:24:22,473
Cusack took off
with a truckload of armor.

771
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:26,185
- He's a one-man army now.
- The son of a bitch is crazy.

772
01:24:26,352 --> 01:24:29,480
Okay, no more games.
Where's Cusack?

773
01:24:29,647 --> 01:24:31,482
He's saving the world.

774
01:24:52,295 --> 01:24:56,131
Eddie's out there alone, and you're
going to let him die? Fuck all of you.

775
01:24:56,299 --> 01:24:59,510
- Cool it, kid.
- "Cool it"? No.

776
01:24:59,677 --> 01:25:03,430
No, no, no. You fucking cool it.
I won't lie for you anymore.

777
01:25:03,598 --> 01:25:05,891
I saw him lay a gun on that kid.
He blew him away, and I saw it.

778
01:25:06,059 --> 01:25:08,769
- You fucking little bastard.
- Goddamn you!

779
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:14,691
What's this for, partner,
your next fuckup?

780
01:25:16,152 --> 01:25:19,780
You better be straight.
Your badge is on the line.

781
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:22,282
If I can't do this right,
you can have it.

782
01:25:24,702 --> 01:25:27,955
Get someone in the air.
We have to find Cusack.

783
01:25:56,317 --> 01:25:59,111
- Get out there.

784
01:26:14,419 --> 01:26:16,461
This is Kates. Listen to me.

785
01:26:16,629 --> 01:26:19,381
We have a sergeant in a green truck.

786
01:26:19,549 --> 01:26:21,758
We're looking for him.
Who do you have in the air?

787
01:26:21,926 --> 01:26:24,261
City wide--

788
01:27:12,894 --> 01:27:15,646
- Go get him!
- Come on! Let's go!

789
01:27:34,415 --> 01:27:35,958
Get the girl!

790
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:06,029
- Hold on! Ahh!

791
01:28:21,462 --> 01:28:23,046
Ahh!

792
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:05,774
This concludes
our demonstration.

793
01:30:05,942 --> 01:30:07,317
If you have further questions...

794
01:30:07,485 --> 01:30:10,529
our factory representative
will be happy to answer them.

795
01:31:13,384 --> 01:31:16,094
Get up, you son of a bitch!
Get the fuck up!

796
01:31:31,444 --> 01:31:33,862
Come on, Eddie!
We told you we'd get you!

797
01:31:39,202 --> 01:31:40,368
Come on, asshole!

798
01:31:41,370 --> 01:31:43,163
We got him, Pompas!

799
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:44,915
Come out, you chickenshit!

800
01:31:54,133 --> 01:31:55,091
Ahh!

801
01:32:04,477 --> 01:32:06,728
Come out, you bastard!

802
01:32:06,896 --> 01:32:10,357
Come on, Luis, we got him! Pompas!

803
01:32:10,858 --> 01:32:11,691
Efren!

804
01:32:13,653 --> 01:32:14,736
Ahh!

805
01:33:04,203 --> 01:33:06,997
Cusack!
You just killed that girl!

806
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:18,294
You know where to find me.

807
01:35:35,855 --> 01:35:37,063
Hey, Eddie.

808
01:35:38,691 --> 01:35:41,693
Partner, I got a great idea.

809
01:35:42,486 --> 01:35:44,612
Mail-order Christmas trees.

810
01:35:45,656 --> 01:35:47,365
Think about it.

811
01:35:51,662 --> 01:35:53,413
See you tomorrow?

812
01:36:04,091 --> 01:36:05,091
Yeah.

813
01:40:46,331 --> 01:40:47,165
