1
00:00:03,335 --> 00:00:05,537
[intense music]

2
00:00:33,265 --> 00:00:35,634
[music continues]

3
00:01:17,976 --> 00:01:19,444
[screaming]

4
00:01:29,854 --> 00:01:32,290
Headquarters,
send over the homicide squad.

5
00:01:32,357 --> 00:01:34,192
Tenth and Sylvan Avenue.

6
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:37,762
Attention, car 48,
car 40.

7
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:41,366
'Go to Tenth and Sylvan ,
report to Inspector Patten'

8
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:42,700
'at the old Mitchell home.'

9
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:45,169
This is Mr. Glenn speaking.

10
00:01:45,236 --> 00:01:48,740
Oh good gracious!
I'll run over right away.

11
00:01:48,807 --> 00:01:50,608
This is Dr. Stuart speaking.

12
00:01:50,675 --> 00:01:54,012
What?
We'll be right over.

13
00:01:56,081 --> 00:01:58,083
[engine revving]

14
00:02:00,919 --> 00:02:04,856
Yeah, yeah, I got it right here.
Herbert Wynn, yeah.

15
00:02:04,923 --> 00:02:08,493
Shot? What was it,
murder or suicide?

16
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,030
No-no. Oh, I see.
When did it happen?

17
00:02:12,095 --> 00:02:14,632
At the old Mitchell residence
on Sylvan Avenue, huh?

18
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:16,667
Oh, yeah-yeah,
I know the old Mitchell estate.

19
00:02:16,734 --> 00:02:18,469
Who found the body?

20
00:02:18,536 --> 00:02:20,905
Body found by his aunt,
Juliet Mitchell

21
00:02:20,972 --> 00:02:24,142
who collapsed, and is now under
care of her personal physician.

22
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:25,710
Alright, stick on the case.

23
00:02:25,777 --> 00:02:28,747
I'll hold a rewrite man here
in case anymore comes in.

24
00:02:38,756 --> 00:02:40,125
So this is romance.

25
00:02:40,191 --> 00:02:42,160
Three pair of tonsils
and a breakaway kidney.

26
00:02:42,226 --> 00:02:44,529
- All in one day.
- I'm busy too, Adams.

27
00:02:44,596 --> 00:02:45,963
I think,
I'm losing my mind.

28
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,533
Probably it's gone away
someplace with mine.

29
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,176
- 'It wasn't your play.'
- 'It was.'

30
00:03:02,346 --> 00:03:04,382
Well, Russian Bank.

31
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:07,418
A nice game of Russian Bank,
it just picks me up.

32
00:03:07,485 --> 00:03:08,719
Like a psychopathic ward.

33
00:03:08,786 --> 00:03:10,755
- You got a date?
- Oh, no such luck.

34
00:03:10,822 --> 00:03:14,425
I smell so of chloroform, no one
but a guy with a gas mask

35
00:03:14,492 --> 00:03:16,495
would make a pass at me.

36
00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:20,932
Oh, I'm tired with my board.

37
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:23,167
I think I'll donate
my body to science

38
00:03:23,234 --> 00:03:25,904
and commit suicide.

39
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,539
Stop. You forgot to put
the nine on the eight.

40
00:03:28,606 --> 00:03:30,942
You can all stop
as far as I'm concerned.

41
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:32,577
'This place is getting
in your hair?'

42
00:03:32,644 --> 00:03:36,581
It's in my hair, my eyes, my
teeth, my nose and it itches.

43
00:03:36,648 --> 00:03:38,015
I'm beginning
to envy the patients.

44
00:03:38,082 --> 00:03:41,052
Things happen to them,
they live or they die.

45
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:43,587
Thrills in our routine are
as common as wisecracks

46
00:03:43,654 --> 00:03:45,490
in an algebra book.

47
00:03:45,556 --> 00:03:48,092
(female #2)
'It's your play.'

48
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,828
I'm going to bed.

49
00:03:51,929 --> 00:03:55,567
Oh, why doesn't someone do
something to break the monotony?

50
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:01,940
You called me
for the same thing.

51
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:04,775
If we're going to play, please
show a little sportsmanship.

52
00:04:04,842 --> 00:04:06,877
Can either of you
do any acrobatic dancing?

53
00:04:06,944 --> 00:04:10,114
It would be much more
interesting.

54
00:04:10,181 --> 00:04:11,182
[knock on door]

55
00:04:11,249 --> 00:04:13,250
Come in.

56
00:04:13,317 --> 00:04:16,821
Miss Adams, report to
the superintendent at once.

57
00:04:16,888 --> 00:04:19,190
Yeah and snap in to it.

58
00:04:21,192 --> 00:04:22,561
[door closing]

59
00:04:24,696 --> 00:04:26,764
Here's the address,
and ask for Dr. Stuart.

60
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:29,000
The old Mitchell house.
I know where that is.

61
00:04:29,066 --> 00:04:30,668
Take a taxi.
Something must've happened.

62
00:04:30,734 --> 00:04:32,203
You'll be told.

63
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,838
Do I report back to you?

64
00:04:33,905 --> 00:04:35,307
No, to..

65
00:04:36,941 --> 00:04:40,144
I may as well tell you,
this is an unusual case.

66
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:42,446
You're really working
for police headquarters.

67
00:04:42,513 --> 00:04:46,618
'Inspector Patten will introduce
himself to you when you arrive.'

68
00:04:46,685 --> 00:04:48,486
'Now, there may be
some excitement.'

69
00:04:48,553 --> 00:04:51,188
'Nervous strain involved in it.'

70
00:04:51,255 --> 00:04:53,624
'If you don't want to go,
I'll send someone else.'

71
00:04:53,691 --> 00:04:57,995
But on the other hand, I think
you're fitted to the job.

72
00:04:58,062 --> 00:05:01,299
If you don't mind a change
from a hospital routine.

73
00:05:01,366 --> 00:05:05,170
Mind a change?
Oh, lady, if you only knew.

74
00:05:14,278 --> 00:05:16,781
[car engine revving]

75
00:05:25,456 --> 00:05:27,192
Here's a dollar.
Keep the change.

76
00:05:30,194 --> 00:05:33,198
- There is no change.
- Then we're even.

77
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:42,807
Dr. Stuart, please.

78
00:05:42,874 --> 00:05:44,909
There's Dr. Stuart,
right there.

79
00:05:46,277 --> 00:05:47,845
- Miss Adams?
- Yes, Dr. Stuart.

80
00:05:47,912 --> 00:05:49,314
Your patient
Miss Mitchell is upstairs.

81
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,349
Nervous shock case.
She's at a dangerous age.

82
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,017
- What shocked her?
- It's rather serious.

83
00:05:53,084 --> 00:05:55,653
Her nephew shot himself tonight,
and she found the body.

84
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,955
Oh!

85
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:06,297
This is your room. Your patient
is in the adjoining room.

86
00:06:06,363 --> 00:06:08,133
Thank you.

87
00:06:17,008 --> 00:06:19,310
Sure you didn't
open it yourself?

88
00:06:19,377 --> 00:06:20,511
Positive, sir.

89
00:06:20,578 --> 00:06:23,348
Well, a man might get out
that window with a ladder.

90
00:06:23,414 --> 00:06:25,983
If he did it, he'd leave
footprints a yard deep.

91
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,519
- The nurse is here, inspector.
- Downstairs?

92
00:06:28,586 --> 00:06:30,221
No. In the room
she's been assigned.

93
00:06:30,287 --> 00:06:32,190
Fine, I'll see her
right away.

94
00:06:32,257 --> 00:06:35,293
Now don't stall.
It won't do you any good.

95
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,694
Did you this one?

96
00:06:36,761 --> 00:06:38,096
I didn't touch it, sir.

97
00:06:38,162 --> 00:06:41,166
I swear it on the holy book.
I found it that way.

98
00:06:41,232 --> 00:06:44,068
When Miss Juliet screamed,
and I came running up.

99
00:06:44,135 --> 00:06:47,405
But somebody did it.
That I'll swear to.

100
00:06:47,472 --> 00:06:51,109
He couldn't kill himself,
not the kind he was.

101
00:06:52,643 --> 00:06:54,812
But somebody did it.

102
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:57,315
And that's where they got away.

103
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:09,227
Why don't they go away?

104
00:07:10,728 --> 00:07:14,733
Tell 'em,
he was cleaning his gun.

105
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:19,136
Cowards like him
don't shoot themselves.

106
00:07:19,203 --> 00:07:22,039
There-there, now don't talk
and don't fret.

107
00:07:22,106 --> 00:07:26,311
He's alright, now.
Safe in his savior's arms.

108
00:07:30,548 --> 00:07:32,083
What was that?

109
00:07:33,584 --> 00:07:35,920
How do you do?

110
00:07:35,987 --> 00:07:38,122
Are you feeling better now?

111
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:41,126
I'm the new nurse.
Adams is the name.

112
00:07:41,192 --> 00:07:43,128
How do you do?

113
00:07:53,838 --> 00:07:55,906
- Who was that?
- That's the coroner.

114
00:07:55,973 --> 00:07:58,342
They were expecting him
for the autopsy.

115
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:01,012
Autopsy, I won't permit it.
I won't have that--

116
00:08:01,078 --> 00:08:02,647
Now, you must be quiet.
Please.

117
00:08:02,713 --> 00:08:04,949
Let go of me.
Let me go.

118
00:08:05,016 --> 00:08:06,918
Please, please.

119
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,622
(Nurse Adams)
'Dr. Stuart, Dr. Stuart.'

120
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:13,358
Yes.

121
00:08:13,424 --> 00:08:15,226
Please, hurry.

122
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,802
She's fainted.
Hypodermic of amyl nitrate.

123
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:27,939
Yes, doctor.
It's ready.

124
00:09:11,949 --> 00:09:13,384
Is she alright?

125
00:09:13,451 --> 00:09:15,185
That's good.

126
00:09:15,252 --> 00:09:17,221
Did you butt in
just to ask that?

127
00:09:17,288 --> 00:09:19,457
Say, listen, there's a cop
around here named Patten

128
00:09:19,523 --> 00:09:22,126
that'll wring your neck
if you mess things up.

129
00:09:26,964 --> 00:09:29,901
No kidding.
The feet fooled me.

130
00:09:29,967 --> 00:09:32,603
No bunion.
I beg your pardon, inspector.

131
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,506
Don't apologize, I liked
the way you dodged the issue.

132
00:09:35,573 --> 00:09:37,108
Sit down.

133
00:09:38,642 --> 00:09:41,945
You've had hospital experience,
police and emergency cases?

134
00:09:42,012 --> 00:09:43,781
Yes along with the rest.

135
00:09:43,847 --> 00:09:45,883
Alright, now tell me something.

136
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,018
If a bullet passes through
a man's head

137
00:09:48,085 --> 00:09:49,520
what's the outstanding result?

138
00:09:49,587 --> 00:09:50,921
A hole, I suppose.

139
00:09:50,988 --> 00:09:52,690
(inspector)
'And in case of suicide?'

140
00:09:52,757 --> 00:09:54,125
Powder burns. Why?

141
00:09:54,191 --> 00:09:56,661
There were no powder marks
on that kid's body.

142
00:09:56,727 --> 00:09:59,296
He cleaned his gun, alright.
But he didn't kill himself

143
00:09:59,363 --> 00:10:00,798
He didn't commit suicide.

144
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:02,432
- You mean, he--
- I mean, murder.

145
00:10:02,499 --> 00:10:03,567
Who?

146
00:10:03,634 --> 00:10:05,303
That's what
we're gonna find out.

147
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,737
What you're gonna find out.

148
00:10:06,804 --> 00:10:07,971
- Me?
- Sure.

149
00:10:08,038 --> 00:10:09,273
You're working for me now.

150
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,977
Oh, I see.
Well, what's my rank?

151
00:10:13,044 --> 00:10:15,579
- Uh, what?
- My rank, my title.

152
00:10:15,646 --> 00:10:18,416
If I'm gonna be with
the police force, what am I?

153
00:10:18,483 --> 00:10:21,118
A female cop
or a disinfected stool pigeon?

154
00:10:21,185 --> 00:10:22,686
Ah, let's see.

155
00:10:22,753 --> 00:10:26,023
You're a Pinkerton. That's it.
Miss Pinkerton of Scotland Yard.

156
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,858
Oh, that's swell.

157
00:10:27,925 --> 00:10:29,193
Well, what next?

158
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,562
Well, for the moment,
just listen.

159
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:34,831
Young Wynn was killed
by somebody he knew.

160
00:10:34,898 --> 00:10:36,467
He was unlacing his shoe.

161
00:10:36,533 --> 00:10:39,604
And looking up at the face
of whoever shot him.

162
00:10:41,171 --> 00:10:42,206
[knock on the door]

163
00:10:42,273 --> 00:10:44,442
(Mary)
'Miss Adams.'

164
00:10:44,508 --> 00:10:46,344
Yes.

165
00:10:47,444 --> 00:10:50,281
- You're coming, now?
- Yes, I am.

166
00:11:00,658 --> 00:11:02,793
Oh, then,
I-I won't disturb her.

167
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,328
I'll look in again tomorrow.

168
00:11:04,394 --> 00:11:07,832
Yes, do so. I hope she'll be
well enough to see you.

169
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:10,467
(Dr. Stuart)
'Oh, inspector.'

170
00:11:10,534 --> 00:11:12,502
Shake hands with Arthur Glenn,
Miss Mitchell's lawyer.

171
00:11:12,569 --> 00:11:15,772
- Just the man I wanna see.
- Anything I can do to help?

172
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,241
Yes, there's one point.

173
00:11:17,308 --> 00:11:19,243
Did young Wynn carry
any life insurance?

174
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,245
He did carry some insurance.

175
00:11:21,312 --> 00:11:23,681
I don't know how much.
I'll look it up.

176
00:11:23,747 --> 00:11:26,084
Much obliged.

177
00:11:31,755 --> 00:11:33,324
Goodnight.

178
00:11:38,863 --> 00:11:41,265
Oh-oh. Excuse me.

179
00:11:41,332 --> 00:11:44,135
- Keep your eyes open.
- Yes, sir.

180
00:12:01,619 --> 00:12:03,688
[wind blowing]

181
00:12:14,164 --> 00:12:16,167
[scratching on door]

182
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:28,780
Well, hello fella,
come on in. Come on.

183
00:12:31,716 --> 00:12:32,750
Come on in.

184
00:12:32,817 --> 00:12:35,486
You could stay in here tonight,
palsy-walsy.

185
00:12:56,173 --> 00:12:58,275
Come here, you. Get right out.
Come here!

186
00:12:58,342 --> 00:13:00,311
Now, you get right outside.

187
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:03,648
You can't stay here.
Right out, go on.

188
00:13:07,285 --> 00:13:10,221
Would you please
do me a favor and go to bed.

189
00:13:10,287 --> 00:13:14,491
Do as she says, Mary.

190
00:13:14,558 --> 00:13:17,595
- Goodnight, Miss Juliet.
- Goodnight.

191
00:13:17,662 --> 00:13:18,696
Goodnight.

192
00:13:23,234 --> 00:13:25,202
Shall I take
one of these pillows away?

193
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:27,839
- No-no.
- Alright.

194
00:13:39,617 --> 00:13:41,486
[wind howling]

195
00:13:48,592 --> 00:13:52,296
Nurse, nurse.
Oh, oh.

196
00:13:54,732 --> 00:13:56,734
I can't breathe.

197
00:13:56,801 --> 00:13:58,669
Yes you can.
Now breathe deeply.

198
00:13:58,735 --> 00:14:00,771
That's it.

199
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:09,547
Stay here. Don't leave me.
I'm afraid.

200
00:14:11,315 --> 00:14:13,618
Something might happen.

201
00:14:13,684 --> 00:14:16,420
Something terrible.

202
00:14:20,257 --> 00:14:22,627
[clock chiming]

203
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,785
- What?
- Shh.

204
00:15:43,474 --> 00:15:45,142
Your breakfast
is downstairs, miss.

205
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:46,743
Oh, good morning.

206
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:49,880
A swell nurse I am.
Need more sleep than my patient.

207
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:10,901
Slip away from her
and hide this.

208
00:16:10,968 --> 00:16:13,804
She's been watching me
all night.

209
00:16:15,072 --> 00:16:17,875
Don't you worry about her.

210
00:16:55,245 --> 00:16:56,814
[door closing]

211
00:17:08,457 --> 00:17:10,927
In here, miss.

212
00:17:25,075 --> 00:17:26,644
[doorbell ringing]

213
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,213
Is that the doorbell?

214
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:32,383
Yes, miss. Excuse me.

215
00:17:57,641 --> 00:18:00,077
Morning, Hugo.
You're looking fit this morning.

216
00:18:00,143 --> 00:18:01,679
Thank you, sir.

217
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,751
No one is allowed in here, miss.

218
00:18:40,817 --> 00:18:43,553
I was just looking
for something to read.

219
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,790
At breakfast, miss?

220
00:18:51,194 --> 00:18:52,529
Well, frankly, Hugo

221
00:18:52,596 --> 00:18:54,965
I come from a long distinguished
line of billy goats.

222
00:18:55,032 --> 00:18:57,801
And we always like to gobble
a few chapters of Shakespeare

223
00:18:57,867 --> 00:19:00,738
before we tackle
our corn flakes.

224
00:19:15,252 --> 00:19:16,821
Miss Adams.

225
00:19:43,647 --> 00:19:45,683
- Morning, Miss Pinkerton.
- Adams to you.

226
00:19:45,749 --> 00:19:48,518
Did you get out
on the wrong side of the bed?

227
00:19:48,585 --> 00:19:50,153
I haven't been anywhere
near a bed.

228
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,523
I'm a mattress loving maiden.
I don't belong here.

229
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:55,992
Neither do I. I oughta be in a
hospital, examining my head.

230
00:19:56,059 --> 00:20:00,163
- Why are you so candid?
- Look at this, will you?

231
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,599
'I don't see anything.
unless for that white spot.'

232
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,234
Is that a defect
in the film?

233
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,537
Defect? Don't let the
photographer hear you say that.

234
00:20:06,603 --> 00:20:10,407
That's the answer to this case.
If only had sense to know it.

235
00:20:10,474 --> 00:20:12,041
That's the corner
of a newspaper.

236
00:20:12,108 --> 00:20:14,211
There was a newspaper
by the body.

237
00:20:14,277 --> 00:20:15,445
What's that
got to do?

238
00:20:15,512 --> 00:20:16,880
It's got everything
to do.

239
00:20:16,946 --> 00:20:19,115
Wynn took out a $100,000
life insurance

240
00:20:19,182 --> 00:20:20,317
before he shot himself.

241
00:20:20,384 --> 00:20:22,152
Glenn, Miss Mitchell's
attorney just told me.

242
00:20:22,219 --> 00:20:25,388
100,000. Then he killed
himself to leave that to the--

243
00:20:25,455 --> 00:20:26,824
That's what he did, alright.

244
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,359
The Mitchell family were broke,
down to the last cent.

245
00:20:29,426 --> 00:20:31,995
He spent all the money
shot his health to pieces.

246
00:20:32,061 --> 00:20:33,630
Well, he was through,
I guess.

247
00:20:33,697 --> 00:20:38,302
But was he smart?
Wait, watch this.

248
00:20:38,368 --> 00:20:39,937
Now, I'm gonna kill
myself, see.

249
00:20:40,004 --> 00:20:42,973
Only insurance companies don't
pay off quickly on suicide.

250
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,609
It's got to look
like a murder or an accident.

251
00:20:45,676 --> 00:20:47,244
Alright, now here's
what I do.

252
00:20:47,311 --> 00:20:50,113
First, I take some oil and rags,
like he did.

253
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,349
The kinda stuff
used to clean a gun.

254
00:20:52,415 --> 00:20:54,851
Then I take the paper
like this.

255
00:20:54,918 --> 00:21:00,157
Kneel down, take my gun,
shoot a hole through the paper.

256
00:21:00,223 --> 00:21:02,225
Once I fall,
the paper falls into place.

257
00:21:02,292 --> 00:21:04,261
When you pick it up,
it's alright.

258
00:21:04,328 --> 00:21:05,562
'What about the powder burn?'

259
00:21:05,629 --> 00:21:08,031
Inside, instead of on me,
smart, huh?

260
00:21:08,098 --> 00:21:11,101
It's been done lots of times.
I must have overlooked.

261
00:21:11,168 --> 00:21:13,937
In the meantime, somebody got
in here and took that newspaper.

262
00:21:14,004 --> 00:21:16,372
- That's what they were hiding.
- Did you see it?

263
00:21:16,439 --> 00:21:19,643
The lady got out, and I caught
her when she sneaked back.

264
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,111
Her feet were
black with dirt.

265
00:21:21,178 --> 00:21:22,746
She hid something
under her pillow.

266
00:21:22,813 --> 00:21:24,981
Morning, Mary went
to the library to hide it.

267
00:21:25,048 --> 00:21:26,783
It might have been
the newspaper.

268
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,018
Probably thrown out by now.

269
00:21:28,084 --> 00:21:29,853
Where do they keep
the newspapers here?

270
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,487
There's an incinerator
in the backyard.

271
00:21:31,554 --> 00:21:32,956
Hugo burns them, I guess.

272
00:21:33,023 --> 00:21:34,991
You wait until dark,
and take a look.

273
00:21:35,058 --> 00:21:37,227
Keep your eyes open.
I'll get down to headquarters.

274
00:21:37,294 --> 00:21:39,863
Maybe, some cop picked it up,
and took it there.

275
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,698
- Gee, I hope so.
- Ah, just my luck.

276
00:21:41,765 --> 00:21:44,968
This is the first case they've
assigned to me all by myself.

277
00:21:45,035 --> 00:21:47,805
And here I go and bungle
it right off the bat.

278
00:21:47,871 --> 00:21:49,906
Probably be walking
the beat next time.

279
00:21:49,973 --> 00:21:51,141
Oh, now stop, will you?

280
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:54,345
You'll have me crying
on your shoulder.

281
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,255
I've kept your breakfast
on the table, miss.

282
00:22:06,323 --> 00:22:07,290
It's getting cold.

283
00:22:07,357 --> 00:22:10,761
My breakfast?
Oh, yes. Of course.

284
00:22:57,574 --> 00:22:58,942
Could you hear what they said?

285
00:22:59,009 --> 00:23:02,779
No. But she's too friendly
with that inspector.

286
00:23:02,846 --> 00:23:05,315
Don't let her go in there.

287
00:23:37,114 --> 00:23:39,583
'What are you looking for?
Footprints or ladder marks?'

288
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,084
How should I know?

289
00:23:41,151 --> 00:23:45,255
Well, maybe you don't,
but what are you doing here?

290
00:23:45,322 --> 00:23:47,457
After all, you're a nurse,
you'll understand.

291
00:23:47,524 --> 00:23:50,093
I've got to talk to somebody,
or I'll go crazy.

292
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,729
You're a friend of the late
Herbert Wynn, aren't you?

293
00:23:52,796 --> 00:23:56,100
- Oh, yes. He, we--
- Sweethearts?

294
00:23:56,166 --> 00:24:00,103
Yes. Oh, it seems so impossible
that he's dead.

295
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,138
- I know who killed him.
- He shot himself.

296
00:24:02,205 --> 00:24:04,374
No-no, he didn't.
Don't let them tell you that.

297
00:24:04,441 --> 00:24:06,476
He was murdered.
I know who did it.

298
00:24:06,543 --> 00:24:10,180
Come on, we better go in the
house. Someone might hear us.

299
00:24:31,735 --> 00:24:35,773
Wait a minute. I've got to see
how my patient is.

300
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:10,874
Take everything she'll tell and
hold her till somebody comes.

301
00:25:10,941 --> 00:25:12,208
Yeah.

302
00:25:12,275 --> 00:25:13,843
We'll tail her
if she leaves.

303
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:16,547
Make it snappy.

304
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,924
Don't be frightened, kid.

305
00:25:27,991 --> 00:25:29,759
Now, what were
you gonna tell me?

306
00:25:29,826 --> 00:25:31,895
I don't know.
Maybe, I better not.

307
00:25:31,962 --> 00:25:34,031
Better get it off your chest.

308
00:25:34,097 --> 00:25:37,200
Alright, first of all,
I was engaged to Herbert Wynn.

309
00:25:37,267 --> 00:25:38,801
They killed him
for his insurance.

310
00:25:38,868 --> 00:25:41,437
They were desperate. The bank
was gonna take the house.

311
00:25:41,504 --> 00:25:43,873
- Who killed him?
- Hugo, I think.

312
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,708
Old lady knew.
She was in it.

313
00:25:45,775 --> 00:25:47,644
They were all in it.
They hated him.

314
00:25:47,711 --> 00:25:50,847
He was afraid. He knew
someone was after him.

315
00:25:50,914 --> 00:25:52,883
One night,
he saw someone in the dark.

316
00:25:52,949 --> 00:25:55,285
After that he always
took his gun along.

317
00:25:55,352 --> 00:25:56,719
He couldn't have
shot himself.

318
00:25:56,786 --> 00:25:58,288
Oh, you must believe me.

319
00:25:58,354 --> 00:26:01,158
I do, only you
ought to tell the police.

320
00:26:01,224 --> 00:26:03,025
But I can't.
My family.

321
00:26:03,092 --> 00:26:06,263
It would be awful
if my name came into it.

322
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:10,300
I must go now. I don't want
anyone to see me here.

323
00:26:13,103 --> 00:26:14,605
Wait a minute.

324
00:26:15,772 --> 00:26:16,939
What is your name?

325
00:26:17,006 --> 00:26:20,910
I can't tell you, I can't.
It's impossible.

326
00:26:20,977 --> 00:26:23,547
Goodbye, then.

327
00:26:46,403 --> 00:26:48,272
[engine revving]

328
00:28:30,774 --> 00:28:33,243
[screaming]

329
00:28:39,516 --> 00:28:43,086
You must have fainted.
Are you hurt, miss?

330
00:28:46,356 --> 00:28:49,159
Oh.

331
00:28:49,226 --> 00:28:50,893
Hurt? I'm dead.

332
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,596
Something hit you, miss?

333
00:28:52,662 --> 00:28:54,598
No, I tripped.

334
00:28:54,664 --> 00:28:58,234
I saw something
go through that door.

335
00:28:58,301 --> 00:29:00,203
No one got out there, miss.

336
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:02,272
That door is locked
and bolted.

337
00:29:02,338 --> 00:29:05,442
Always has been.
We never use it.

338
00:29:05,509 --> 00:29:07,077
What were you doing down there?

339
00:29:07,143 --> 00:29:09,445
I, I couldn't sleep.

340
00:29:09,512 --> 00:29:11,515
That is, I heard a noise.

341
00:29:11,581 --> 00:29:15,084
So, I got this,
and went in the parlor.

342
00:29:15,151 --> 00:29:18,388
I watched and then,
I must have dozed.

343
00:29:18,455 --> 00:29:20,056
You say, you heard a noise?

344
00:29:20,123 --> 00:29:22,726
I don't know what,
a kind of knocking

345
00:29:22,792 --> 00:29:25,829
or creeping more like.

346
00:29:25,896 --> 00:29:27,463
Why don't you go outside
and look?

347
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:30,266
I think, I'll stay down
in the parlor, miss.

348
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:32,069
Well, just as you say.
Only--

349
00:29:32,135 --> 00:29:35,171
Perhaps, you had better
go to your room.

350
00:29:35,238 --> 00:29:39,242
Okay, but it's a cinch
I won't sleep now.

351
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,850
- Goodnight, miss.
- Goodnight.

352
00:31:20,676 --> 00:31:23,713
'"County Coroner
James A. Klempf'

353
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:26,116
'"last night wrote finis
to the inquiry'

354
00:31:26,182 --> 00:31:29,985
'started by police into the
mysterious tragic death

355
00:31:30,052 --> 00:31:33,423
"of youthful Herbert Wynn.

356
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:37,928
Autopsy proves beyond a doubt
that the death was accidental."

357
00:31:47,337 --> 00:31:48,971
It's a great relief, Juliet.

358
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:50,306
(Juliet)
'In what way?'

359
00:31:50,373 --> 00:31:51,807
In every way.

360
00:31:51,874 --> 00:31:54,677
The poor boy is gone,
and we can't bring him back.

361
00:31:54,744 --> 00:31:59,181
'This means security for you and
I'm most happy for your sake.'

362
00:31:59,248 --> 00:32:00,616
'Now, the insurance
will be paid.'

363
00:32:00,683 --> 00:32:05,555
Oh, no.
But I don't want blood money.

364
00:32:05,621 --> 00:32:08,424
Oh, don't look at it
that way.

365
00:32:08,491 --> 00:32:12,328
Don't you see,
there's no taint on the money.

366
00:32:12,394 --> 00:32:14,964
It's due,
legally and fairly.

367
00:32:15,031 --> 00:32:16,899
It's a Godsend, Miss Juliet.

368
00:32:16,966 --> 00:32:19,002
That'll do, Mary.

369
00:32:20,603 --> 00:32:23,873
It'll help,
I don't deny that.

370
00:32:25,875 --> 00:32:29,846
But I wish it could
have come some other way.

371
00:32:29,913 --> 00:32:32,916
So do I.
So do all of us.

372
00:32:34,183 --> 00:32:37,286
But let's be thankful.

373
00:32:37,353 --> 00:32:39,456
Times are hard, Juliet.

374
00:32:39,522 --> 00:32:42,225
I know they are,
for me at least.

375
00:32:42,292 --> 00:32:44,460
By this indemnity.

376
00:32:44,527 --> 00:32:46,462
(male #1)
'Have you read this?'

377
00:32:46,529 --> 00:32:48,431
Ah, brilliant that coroner.

378
00:32:48,498 --> 00:32:50,333
Sees all and knows nothing.

379
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,767
If he thinks for one minute

380
00:32:51,834 --> 00:32:53,703
he's closed this case,
he's crazy.

381
00:32:54,537 --> 00:32:56,973
[dog barking]

382
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,374
Well, what's the matter, fella?

383
00:32:58,441 --> 00:33:00,644
You still hungry after
all those pork chops.

384
00:33:02,345 --> 00:33:04,781
Right here.

385
00:33:07,984 --> 00:33:10,320
There.

386
00:33:10,386 --> 00:33:12,555
Don't forget
if you meet me in the dark.

387
00:33:12,621 --> 00:33:14,057
I'm your palsy-walsy.

388
00:33:25,168 --> 00:33:26,936
Get out of here.

389
00:33:27,003 --> 00:33:28,904
[dog barking]

390
00:33:28,971 --> 00:33:31,808
You ought to be killed.

391
00:33:48,157 --> 00:33:49,726
Bedtime, Miss Mitchell.

392
00:33:49,793 --> 00:33:53,462
The doctor wants you to drink
this before you go to sleep.

393
00:33:53,529 --> 00:33:57,033
Doctors are all alike.
Even Stuart.

394
00:33:58,835 --> 00:34:01,905
I don't trust any of 'em.
Never did.

395
00:35:15,612 --> 00:35:16,946
[screaming]

396
00:35:23,552 --> 00:35:25,822
Go around on that side.

397
00:35:25,889 --> 00:35:27,123
Come on, Patten.

398
00:35:33,062 --> 00:35:34,197
[Miss Adams screaming]

399
00:35:39,969 --> 00:35:41,603
- What's in there?
- My room.

400
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,439
But you can't open it.
It's locked.

401
00:35:43,505 --> 00:35:49,178
- I don't have the key.
- I can't, eh?

402
00:35:49,245 --> 00:35:50,613
Are you sure
you are alright?

403
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,648
Yes, I'm alright.
He went through that door.

404
00:35:52,715 --> 00:35:54,484
(Patten)
'Quick, boys.
Wynn's room.'

405
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,369
Stand aside.
I'll shoot the lock.

406
00:36:13,435 --> 00:36:14,771
[gunshot]

407
00:36:28,751 --> 00:36:31,421
(Patten)
'Stick 'em up.'

408
00:36:31,487 --> 00:36:33,055
'Come on.'

409
00:36:33,122 --> 00:36:34,891
'Come on out here.'

410
00:36:39,629 --> 00:36:42,331
They don't make doors
like that anymore.

411
00:36:42,398 --> 00:36:44,133
It's solid oak.

412
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,467
Pretty calm, aren't you?

413
00:36:45,534 --> 00:36:47,704
Don't bother,
I haven't a gun.

414
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:50,139
I'm looking for
a bunch of keys.

415
00:36:57,846 --> 00:36:59,615
How did you
get in the house?

416
00:36:59,682 --> 00:37:01,584
Maybe, I found the doors open.

417
00:37:09,325 --> 00:37:10,893
Riley, take a look around

418
00:37:10,959 --> 00:37:14,631
and see if this fellow threw
a bunch of keys out the window.

419
00:37:16,933 --> 00:37:19,068
- I'm arresting you.
- For what?

420
00:37:19,134 --> 00:37:20,636
Housebreaking?

421
00:37:20,703 --> 00:37:22,538
That'll do until
we find the keys.

422
00:37:22,604 --> 00:37:23,673
And then what?

423
00:37:23,739 --> 00:37:26,409
Suspicion of
first degree murder.

424
00:37:26,476 --> 00:37:27,877
You won't need
the bracelets.

425
00:37:27,944 --> 00:37:30,113
Take him downstairs
to the front door and wait.

426
00:37:30,179 --> 00:37:32,615
I want to see
if Miss Adams is alright.

427
00:37:32,682 --> 00:37:34,617
Alright, come on,
get down here.

428
00:37:37,352 --> 00:37:40,323
Here's some keys, chief.
I found 'em under the window.

429
00:37:41,523 --> 00:37:43,425
'Herbert Wynn's keys.'

430
00:37:43,492 --> 00:37:44,727
Where did you get these?

431
00:37:44,794 --> 00:37:46,762
That would be telling
stories out of school.

432
00:37:46,829 --> 00:37:49,032
Alright, take him down.
Book him for murder.

433
00:37:54,671 --> 00:37:56,539
Wrong again,
Sherlock Holmes.

434
00:37:56,606 --> 00:37:58,174
That boy did not kill Wynn.

435
00:37:58,241 --> 00:37:59,975
Ah, just like a woman.

436
00:38:00,042 --> 00:38:01,644
You mustn't let those
good-looking eyes

437
00:38:01,711 --> 00:38:03,479
and that calm, innocent,
baby-face fool you.

438
00:38:03,545 --> 00:38:06,515
If I wanna be fooled,
I'd put myself in your shoes.

439
00:38:06,582 --> 00:38:08,151
Now, this is no time
to argue.

440
00:38:08,217 --> 00:38:10,586
I've got the murderer,
or at least an accomplice.

441
00:38:10,653 --> 00:38:12,455
- That's certain.
- He didn't do it.

442
00:38:12,522 --> 00:38:14,223
- Who did?
- Wynn killed himself.

443
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:16,726
Now look. You're so
infernally smart.

444
00:38:18,694 --> 00:38:20,797
'A newspaper?'

445
00:38:20,863 --> 00:38:22,831
What did he break in here
tonight for?

446
00:38:22,898 --> 00:38:24,300
Well, I'm no mind-reader.

447
00:38:24,366 --> 00:38:26,936
Maybe we should call in
a detective on the case.

448
00:38:27,002 --> 00:38:28,537
Well, this paper
doesn't mean anything.

449
00:38:28,604 --> 00:38:32,208
He broke in here that night, and
used the keys to open the door.

450
00:38:32,275 --> 00:38:35,111
- Did the same thing tonight.
- Walked like a ghost I suppose.

451
00:38:35,177 --> 00:38:37,546
He did not walk through
that door like a ghost.

452
00:38:37,613 --> 00:38:40,583
He knew the combination of that
secret door all the time.

453
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:43,519
Let me see that paper again.

454
00:38:43,586 --> 00:38:45,154
Well, it's ten days old.

455
00:38:45,221 --> 00:38:47,190
Well, don't the powder burns
prove something?

456
00:38:47,256 --> 00:38:48,591
No, not necessarily.

457
00:38:48,658 --> 00:38:50,225
He could've arranged that
ten days ago.

458
00:38:50,292 --> 00:38:52,661
Brought it to make it
look like a suicide.

459
00:38:52,728 --> 00:38:54,497
You are pulling rabbits
out of a hat.

460
00:38:54,564 --> 00:38:57,533
Well, anyway, the handsome young
man will have to give me

461
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,802
mighty good reasons
for having those keys.

462
00:38:59,868 --> 00:39:01,203
You know, all juries

463
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:03,639
are not made up of susceptible
good-looking blondes

464
00:39:03,706 --> 00:39:05,274
like yourself, Adams.

465
00:39:06,942 --> 00:39:09,879
Remind me to hate you,
will you, Patten?

466
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,715
[bell tolling]

467
00:39:17,253 --> 00:39:19,088
'What was it?
What was it?'

468
00:39:19,154 --> 00:39:21,924
Oh, they caught a fellow named
Elliott, in Mr. Herbert room.

469
00:39:21,991 --> 00:39:24,160
They are gonna charge him
with the murder.

470
00:39:24,227 --> 00:39:25,460
Charlie Elliott?

471
00:39:25,527 --> 00:39:28,197
A young, dark haired boy?

472
00:39:28,264 --> 00:39:29,665
'Yes.'

473
00:39:29,732 --> 00:39:32,268
Oh! Oh!

474
00:39:33,569 --> 00:39:34,737
Oh.

475
00:39:35,971 --> 00:39:38,507
Send for Arthur Glenn
at once.

476
00:39:38,574 --> 00:39:42,511
Well, not now. He's gone home,
and it's getting very late.

477
00:39:42,578 --> 00:39:44,246
Well, then, in the morning.

478
00:39:44,313 --> 00:39:46,315
The first thing.

479
00:39:46,382 --> 00:39:48,084
'I must make a statement.'

480
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,287
A statement?

481
00:39:52,354 --> 00:39:54,957
'Yes, a statement.'

482
00:39:56,993 --> 00:40:01,397
(Juliet)
'Knowing that I have
not long to live.'

483
00:40:01,464 --> 00:40:05,501
'And that I soon
must face my maker.'

484
00:40:05,567 --> 00:40:07,803
I make this statement.

485
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:11,373
To prevent a great injustice..

486
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,709
...being done.

487
00:40:13,775 --> 00:40:16,879
I make it of my own
free will.

488
00:40:16,946 --> 00:40:20,550
And in full possession
of my faculties.

489
00:40:20,616 --> 00:40:23,085
But I request..

490
00:40:23,152 --> 00:40:28,523
...what I'm about to say
should be kept secret.

491
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:29,825
Except--

492
00:40:29,892 --> 00:40:31,860
If this is to be
of confidential nature

493
00:40:31,927 --> 00:40:34,397
I better take it down myself.

494
00:40:34,464 --> 00:40:36,832
Would you mind, Miss Adams?

495
00:40:36,899 --> 00:40:38,334
No, of course not.

496
00:40:45,874 --> 00:40:49,045
I think you better
step out too, Miss Lenz.

497
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:51,247
Certainly.

498
00:40:54,183 --> 00:40:57,386
You might wait in Miss Adams'
room where I can call you.

499
00:40:57,453 --> 00:40:59,322
Alright.

500
00:41:18,474 --> 00:41:19,809
[door closes]

501
00:41:32,855 --> 00:41:34,223
Psst.

502
00:41:41,364 --> 00:41:43,533
- What do you want?
- You've gotta help me.

503
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:45,067
I'm half mad.

504
00:41:45,133 --> 00:41:47,102
If you think you can create
a sensation

505
00:41:47,169 --> 00:41:48,737
by going crazy,
you are mistaken.

506
00:41:48,804 --> 00:41:50,372
The house is already
full of nuts.

507
00:41:50,439 --> 00:41:53,008
One more night of this,
and I'll lead the parade.

508
00:41:53,075 --> 00:41:54,843
Charlie got arrested
and charged for murder.

509
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:55,978
It's all my fault.

510
00:41:56,045 --> 00:41:57,413
What? How is it your fault?

511
00:41:57,479 --> 00:42:00,048
- What you gotta do with it?
- It is my fault.

512
00:42:00,115 --> 00:42:01,683
I sent him here last night.

513
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:03,118
To get something
from Herbert's room.

514
00:42:03,185 --> 00:42:04,687
You left something in there?

515
00:42:04,754 --> 00:42:06,922
Yes. I don't care
what you think of me.

516
00:42:06,989 --> 00:42:08,957
I used to go there
to his room.

517
00:42:09,024 --> 00:42:10,492
Herbert gave the keys to me.

518
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:13,762
I gave 'em to Charlie last night
and that's how he got in.

519
00:42:13,829 --> 00:42:17,032
Never mind. Tell me what
you want, I'll get it for you.

520
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:18,868
I can't tell,
until I find it.

521
00:42:18,934 --> 00:42:21,704
My family are strict
and they didn't like Herbert

522
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:23,339
But please, I can't
tell you anymore.

523
00:42:23,406 --> 00:42:25,374
- I can't.
- Then I can't let you in.

524
00:42:25,441 --> 00:42:27,243
But Charlie's life
may depend on it.

525
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:30,312
That's a fine thing to say.
If they catch you nosing in--

526
00:42:30,379 --> 00:42:32,815
Oh, you've got to!
Let me in, please.

527
00:42:32,882 --> 00:42:34,583
Well, alright, come on.

528
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:37,153
I can't make anymore mistakes
than the detectives.

529
00:43:12,955 --> 00:43:14,156
Well, I like your nerve.

530
00:43:14,223 --> 00:43:16,058
Getting powder
all over my things.

531
00:43:16,626 --> 00:43:17,826
Crown you.

532
00:43:17,893 --> 00:43:20,062
So sorry, my dear.
So sorry.

533
00:43:22,264 --> 00:43:24,133
Paula Brent, aren't you?

534
00:43:24,199 --> 00:43:26,835
No accounting
for people's tastes, I suppose.

535
00:43:26,902 --> 00:43:28,303
I'm afraid
I don't understand you.

536
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:31,306
Indeed. Allow me
to introduced myself.

537
00:43:31,373 --> 00:43:34,944
I am Florence Lenz,
L-E-N-Z.

538
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:37,012
Oh, I've heard about you.

539
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:40,682
[knock on door]
So, you're the girl--

540
00:43:40,749 --> 00:43:42,217
- Miss Lenz.
- Yes.

541
00:43:42,284 --> 00:43:45,521
Will you and Ms. Adams step in
and witness this signature.

542
00:43:45,587 --> 00:43:47,089
Certainly.

543
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:05,107
You understand this statement
is confidential.

544
00:44:30,532 --> 00:44:32,601
Sign here.

545
00:44:32,668 --> 00:44:35,638
(Arthur)
'You are witnessing
simply the signature.'

546
00:44:37,906 --> 00:44:39,542
Now, Miss Lenz.

547
00:44:44,746 --> 00:44:47,516
Thank you. You wish to read
this over now, Juliet?

548
00:44:49,685 --> 00:44:51,420
After I've rested.

549
00:44:52,488 --> 00:44:54,056
Wait downstairs.

550
00:44:57,259 --> 00:44:59,261
You are over-tired,
Miss Mitchell.

551
00:45:03,899 --> 00:45:06,168
- Hello, Arthur.
- Good morning.

552
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,273
A long statement?

553
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:15,011
Why, she hasn't the strength.

554
00:45:18,147 --> 00:45:19,749
(Miss Adams)
'Oh, doctor.'

555
00:45:30,392 --> 00:45:32,494
Well, exhaustion naturally.

556
00:45:32,561 --> 00:45:35,031
Some uh, amyl nitrate,
hypodermic.

557
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:32,955
Hmm.

558
00:46:33,022 --> 00:46:35,558
[Juliet moaning]

559
00:46:38,426 --> 00:46:40,028
Miss Adams!
Miss Adams!

560
00:46:40,095 --> 00:46:42,731
'Yes, doctor.'

561
00:46:42,798 --> 00:46:44,667
What was in that hypodermic?

562
00:47:11,393 --> 00:47:14,730
She's dead.
Get me that hypodermic.

563
00:47:14,797 --> 00:47:17,032
But, doctor, it was
the regular injection.

564
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:19,268
Get me that hypodermic,
do you hear me?

565
00:47:19,335 --> 00:47:21,470
I've washed it out, doctor.

566
00:47:26,408 --> 00:47:29,344
You've washed it, alright.
Used alcohol too.

567
00:47:29,411 --> 00:47:32,081
- You didn't waste time.
- I'm not trained to waste time.

568
00:47:32,147 --> 00:47:34,416
- Where are the tablets?
- In my room.

569
00:47:41,556 --> 00:47:44,192
It's arsenic.
And five grain tablets too.

570
00:47:44,259 --> 00:47:46,095
One would have been enough.

571
00:47:46,161 --> 00:47:49,097
Oh, but this...this
says amyl nitrate.

572
00:47:49,164 --> 00:47:50,399
Then arsenic was substituted.

573
00:47:50,466 --> 00:47:52,234
That's a very clever deduction.

574
00:47:52,301 --> 00:47:55,070
Do I have to tell you
what this means to you.

575
00:47:55,137 --> 00:47:56,538
It's either a case
of negligence--

576
00:47:56,605 --> 00:47:59,074
Doctor, you don't think
I did it intentionally.

577
00:47:59,141 --> 00:48:00,642
You couldn't!
You couldn't!

578
00:48:00,709 --> 00:48:02,878
Nevertheless, this calls
for a investigation.

579
00:48:02,945 --> 00:48:03,912
Having some trouble, doctor?

580
00:48:03,979 --> 00:48:06,347
Oh, you might call it that.

581
00:48:06,414 --> 00:48:08,616
Patten, Miss Mitchell is dead.

582
00:48:08,683 --> 00:48:10,585
- What?
- She died five minutes ago.

583
00:48:10,652 --> 00:48:12,688
No, no, I'll correct
that statement.

584
00:48:12,754 --> 00:48:15,024
She was killed
five minutes ago.

585
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:16,458
Five grains of arsenic
was substituted

586
00:48:16,524 --> 00:48:18,594
for a regular hypodermic.

587
00:48:18,661 --> 00:48:21,429
And I, uh, I'm due at hospital
on a surgical case.

588
00:48:21,496 --> 00:48:23,298
I'll notify the coroner
from there.

589
00:48:23,365 --> 00:48:24,866
There is one more thing.

590
00:48:24,933 --> 00:48:28,204
'I want this nurse held
on charges of gross negligence.'

591
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:30,738
'Or a possible complicity
to homicide.'

592
00:48:30,805 --> 00:48:31,906
Goodbye.

593
00:48:31,973 --> 00:48:33,309
Goodbye.

594
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:53,128
Did you fix that hypodermic?

595
00:48:53,195 --> 00:48:54,462
Yes, for heaven sakes--

596
00:48:54,529 --> 00:48:57,232
'No, no, I'm not
suspecting you, am I?'

597
00:48:57,299 --> 00:48:59,134
'Use the brains
you were born with.'

598
00:48:59,201 --> 00:49:00,769
We've gotta work fast.

599
00:49:00,836 --> 00:49:03,171
Now, somebody got here
and switched those tablets.

600
00:49:03,238 --> 00:49:04,706
Who was it?

601
00:49:04,772 --> 00:49:07,542
Who was in this room today,
besides yourself and the doctor?

602
00:49:07,609 --> 00:49:10,078
Florence Lenz and Paula Brent.

603
00:49:10,145 --> 00:49:11,680
'Brent? How did she get in?'

604
00:49:11,747 --> 00:49:13,715
I let her in.
She begged me to.

605
00:49:13,782 --> 00:49:15,717
Wanted to find something
in Herbert's room

606
00:49:15,784 --> 00:49:17,352
and Charlie's
life depended on it.

607
00:49:17,419 --> 00:49:18,820
And you fell for that.

608
00:49:18,887 --> 00:49:21,490
What do you mean?
I believe the kid, that's all.

609
00:49:21,556 --> 00:49:23,158
Detectives are not
supposed to believe.

610
00:49:23,225 --> 00:49:25,994
- Who said I was a detective?
- You aren't. That's certain.

611
00:49:26,061 --> 00:49:27,429
Why'd I let you into this?

612
00:49:27,496 --> 00:49:29,865
Let me into it?
You dragged me into it.

613
00:49:29,931 --> 00:49:31,433
I've lost a lot of sleep.

614
00:49:31,499 --> 00:49:34,502
and scared myself so much.
I'm in shape for an asylum.

615
00:49:34,569 --> 00:49:36,038
Never mind.
Where is Brent?

616
00:49:36,105 --> 00:49:38,807
Up in young Wynn's
room, I suppose.

617
00:49:38,874 --> 00:49:41,877
Look, do me a favor.
Let me go back to the hospital.

618
00:49:41,944 --> 00:49:44,112
Go up and hold her
until I get there.

619
00:49:44,179 --> 00:49:47,149
I must examine Miss. Mitchell's
room before anything is touched.

620
00:49:47,216 --> 00:49:48,951
Now step on it.

621
00:49:49,851 --> 00:49:51,487
Pinkerton.

622
00:50:16,879 --> 00:50:18,313
Did you find it?

623
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:19,982
- No, I didn't.
- What's this?

624
00:50:20,049 --> 00:50:25,420
- Don't take it, you mustn't--
- I'll take a look at that.

625
00:50:25,487 --> 00:50:27,021
(Patten)
'Married!'

626
00:50:27,088 --> 00:50:30,124
Secretly married to Herbert Wynn
and in love with young Elliott.

627
00:50:30,191 --> 00:50:31,793
Well, this is news.

628
00:50:31,859 --> 00:50:34,629
I want to thank you, Miss Brent
for establishing the motive.

629
00:50:34,696 --> 00:50:37,699
Now I understand, why Elliott
felt that Wynn had to be killed.

630
00:50:37,766 --> 00:50:39,535
- You are wrong.
- I hardly think so.

631
00:50:39,601 --> 00:50:41,369
I'm holding you under arrest
for investigation.

632
00:50:41,436 --> 00:50:42,871
Why? You can't.

633
00:50:42,938 --> 00:50:44,706
- My people wouldn't--
- Take her to headquarters.

634
00:50:44,773 --> 00:50:46,575
But, why? I haven't
committed any crime.

635
00:50:46,642 --> 00:50:47,809
I'm holding you
for investigation

636
00:50:47,876 --> 00:50:49,511
in the murder
of Miss Mitchell

637
00:50:49,577 --> 00:50:51,213
Is Miss Mitchell dead?

638
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,482
Yes. She was murdered
a few minutes ago.

639
00:50:57,185 --> 00:50:59,621
You see.
That finishes the case.

640
00:50:59,688 --> 00:51:02,257
I think I can link
both murders by night time.

641
00:51:02,324 --> 00:51:03,891
It's a cinch.
There is a connection.

642
00:51:03,958 --> 00:51:05,927
I think young Elliott
is the missing link.

643
00:51:05,994 --> 00:51:07,962
Now, listen, young fella.
You are badly mistaken.

644
00:51:08,029 --> 00:51:09,798
Those kids haven't
done a thing wrong.

645
00:51:09,865 --> 00:51:12,334
When I get a hunch
it's usually good.

646
00:51:12,401 --> 00:51:13,902
They are innocent I tell ya.

647
00:51:13,969 --> 00:51:17,038
Oh, you've got yourself all
worked up over this thing.

648
00:51:17,105 --> 00:51:18,540
Your nerves are all shot.

649
00:51:18,607 --> 00:51:20,409
What you need is a good rest.

650
00:51:20,476 --> 00:51:23,479
What I need
is a good shoulder to cry on.

651
00:51:27,115 --> 00:51:28,550
Say, you married?

652
00:51:28,616 --> 00:51:30,686
- No, are you?
- Uh-huh.

653
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:36,524
[clearing throat]

654
00:51:36,591 --> 00:51:39,394
Inspector, they want
to see you downstairs.

655
00:51:39,461 --> 00:51:41,630
Well, now..

656
00:51:41,696 --> 00:51:43,932
...ah, now, that's better.
That's better.

657
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,634
Uh, ah, alright.

658
00:51:51,874 --> 00:51:54,410
[engine revving]

659
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,656
Hey, who are you?

660
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:09,457
The Morning Eagle.

661
00:52:09,524 --> 00:52:11,192
The Morning Eagle, eh?

662
00:52:11,259 --> 00:52:12,995
Well, go feather your nest.

663
00:52:17,632 --> 00:52:19,701
I'm sorry you won't
cooperate with me.

664
00:52:19,768 --> 00:52:21,769
I've given you every chance.

665
00:52:21,836 --> 00:52:25,040
I must warn you that
you're hurting your own case.

666
00:52:25,107 --> 00:52:27,375
And his too.

667
00:52:27,442 --> 00:52:29,511
- Bring in Elliott
- Okay.

668
00:52:35,016 --> 00:52:37,519
Charlie.

669
00:52:37,586 --> 00:52:40,155
I'm sorry, honey.
My arms are in use.

670
00:52:42,357 --> 00:52:44,693
[softly]
Take them off.

671
00:52:46,561 --> 00:52:48,197
Take 'em off.

672
00:52:58,507 --> 00:53:00,642
(Charlie)
'Love me?'

673
00:53:00,709 --> 00:53:03,745
'Then that's all that matters
isn't it, honey?'

674
00:53:03,811 --> 00:53:09,051
We won't need you, Miss. Brent.
Move over here.

675
00:53:09,117 --> 00:53:11,820
(Patten)
'I suppose you know
why we brought you here.'

676
00:53:11,887 --> 00:53:13,722
To reenact my hideous
cold blooded crime

677
00:53:13,789 --> 00:53:16,424
for the edification
of you numbskulls, I suppose.

678
00:53:16,491 --> 00:53:19,861
Oh, you'll have plenty of time
to wisecrack in the cooler.

679
00:53:19,928 --> 00:53:21,896
You might as well begin
at the beginning.

680
00:53:21,963 --> 00:53:24,732
Tell us why you came here.
Was it a friendly call?

681
00:53:24,799 --> 00:53:26,335
I told you there's
nothing friendly.

682
00:53:26,401 --> 00:53:29,804
I came to see Wynn and tell him
not to bother my girl.

683
00:53:29,871 --> 00:53:31,439
You mean quit bothering
his own wife.

684
00:53:31,506 --> 00:53:34,342
- I didn't know about that.
- Just what did you know?

685
00:53:34,409 --> 00:53:37,245
Wynn had infatuated her.

686
00:53:37,312 --> 00:53:38,980
I guess he was a smooth worker.

687
00:53:39,047 --> 00:53:41,415
I knew she was in some
kind of mess.

688
00:53:41,482 --> 00:53:42,818
I didn't ask for particulars.

689
00:53:42,884 --> 00:53:45,453
So, I came to Wynn.
I was gonna have a showdown.

690
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,957
- And kill him if necessary.
- No. Sock him, maybe.

691
00:53:49,024 --> 00:53:51,393
I never hated anybody
bad enough to kill 'em.

692
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:52,894
Go on.

693
00:53:52,961 --> 00:53:56,164
I took the keys from her.
She didn't want me to have 'em.

694
00:53:56,231 --> 00:53:59,233
- We had a tussle over--
- Get the keys to talk to Wynn.

695
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:01,669
- Juliet could've rung the door.
- I've explained all that.

696
00:54:01,736 --> 00:54:03,505
Wynn knew I didn't like him.

697
00:54:03,572 --> 00:54:05,407
He wouldn't talk,
if I hadn't surprised him.

698
00:54:05,474 --> 00:54:09,344
Oh. I see. What did you do,
when you got inside?

699
00:54:09,411 --> 00:54:10,512
I came upstairs.

700
00:54:10,578 --> 00:54:12,547
I saw light
in Wynn's room and then..

701
00:54:12,614 --> 00:54:13,581
And then what?

702
00:54:13,648 --> 00:54:15,016
I came into the room.

703
00:54:15,083 --> 00:54:16,051
I saw him.

704
00:54:16,117 --> 00:54:18,687
He was on the floor.
He was dead.

705
00:54:18,754 --> 00:54:21,889
I didn't kill him.
He was dead when I got in.

706
00:54:21,956 --> 00:54:23,425
(Patten)
'Did you call the police?'

707
00:54:23,491 --> 00:54:26,061
- 'Did you try and assist--'
- 'You know what I did.'

708
00:54:26,127 --> 00:54:27,895
I heard somebody
coming up the stairs.

709
00:54:27,962 --> 00:54:30,131
I knew it'd look bad,
so I got out.

710
00:54:30,198 --> 00:54:31,966
Out the window.
How'd you get down?

711
00:54:32,033 --> 00:54:34,001
As far as you're
concerned, I flew down.

712
00:54:34,068 --> 00:54:36,238
I got him down
and brought him here.

713
00:54:36,305 --> 00:54:37,873
I was afraid
of what he'd do.

714
00:54:37,939 --> 00:54:39,407
He whistled from the roof.

715
00:54:39,473 --> 00:54:42,844
So, I dragged the ladder
over here and got him down.

716
00:54:42,911 --> 00:54:45,046
That's a mighty
nice story Elliott.

717
00:54:45,113 --> 00:54:47,115
What with your looks
and your manner

718
00:54:47,181 --> 00:54:48,583
you'll get
courtroom sympathy.

719
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:50,619
But that isn't
all you going to get.

720
00:54:50,686 --> 00:54:52,987
There's just one thing
you left out.

721
00:54:53,054 --> 00:54:55,890
Let's take a look
at this dummy.

722
00:54:55,957 --> 00:54:58,326
This was how Wynn
looked when you saw him.

723
00:54:58,393 --> 00:55:00,528
- No.
- Well, how did he look?

724
00:55:00,595 --> 00:55:04,933
Arrange the body to look exactly
as it was when you saw it.

725
00:55:21,249 --> 00:55:24,853
Nice work. Looks like
a real suicide, alright.

726
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,922
Did you as neat a job
when you fixed the real corpse?

727
00:55:27,989 --> 00:55:29,657
- The real corpse--
- Let's quit stalling.

728
00:55:29,724 --> 00:55:31,493
Your story would
be swell if somebody

729
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:33,361
hadn't seen you
move the body.

730
00:55:33,428 --> 00:55:34,495
Got the statement, then?

731
00:55:34,562 --> 00:55:36,030
Here it is.

732
00:55:36,097 --> 00:55:39,134
Statement was dictated by
Miss. Mitchell on her deathbed.

733
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,768
I'll read it to you.

734
00:55:40,835 --> 00:55:43,705
Uh, you'll hear it
in court anyway.

735
00:55:43,772 --> 00:55:46,173
I'll tell you what
she said and save time.

736
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,677
She saw you
move the body, Elliot.

737
00:55:48,744 --> 00:55:50,078
That was her
dying testament.

738
00:55:50,145 --> 00:55:52,347
That's a lie. I don't know
anything about it.

739
00:55:52,414 --> 00:55:55,917
She didn't see you shoot him,
but she saw you move the body.

740
00:55:55,983 --> 00:55:58,987
I never touched the body.
He was dead when I got here.

741
00:55:59,053 --> 00:56:00,855
Why make it look
like a suicide?

742
00:56:00,922 --> 00:56:02,924
I didn't. If she
said that, she's lying.

743
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:05,660
She saw you, alright.
And you got away fast enough.

744
00:56:05,727 --> 00:56:07,328
But you won't
get away this time.

745
00:56:07,395 --> 00:56:10,399
Not through that window or by
someone bringing you a ladder.

746
00:56:10,465 --> 00:56:13,501
'Well, guess
that's all we need.'

747
00:56:13,568 --> 00:56:16,204
'You've cleared things up
quite a bit for me, Elliott.'

748
00:56:16,271 --> 00:56:19,007
- Take him away, boys.
- Come on.

749
00:56:23,678 --> 00:56:27,215
Young Elliott must be in there
telling his middle name.

750
00:56:27,282 --> 00:56:29,784
I wonder why the inspector
wouldn't let us in?

751
00:56:29,851 --> 00:56:32,153
He's afraid we'll
catch the real guy.

752
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:34,790
Yeah.

753
00:56:42,663 --> 00:56:44,265
Any particulars
from you, chief?

754
00:56:44,332 --> 00:56:47,769
Not now, boys. Carey'll give you
all the dope at headquarters.

755
00:56:58,112 --> 00:57:00,482
Oh, Miss Pinkerton,
don't look like that.

756
00:57:00,548 --> 00:57:02,083
Your face is a mile long.

757
00:57:02,149 --> 00:57:03,918
Remember, this all
was a silver lining.

758
00:57:03,985 --> 00:57:06,154
I don't see one
around this madhouse.

759
00:57:06,221 --> 00:57:07,388
Well, here's one.

760
00:57:07,455 --> 00:57:09,924
Mary has promised
to cook us some late supper.

761
00:57:09,991 --> 00:57:12,260
I could use it.
How about you?

762
00:57:12,326 --> 00:57:15,363
I've been hungry all my life
for one thing or another.

763
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:16,498
You mean..

764
00:57:16,564 --> 00:57:20,001
I mean, right now,
I'm hungry for...food.

765
00:57:41,923 --> 00:57:44,092
I'll have an ice cream soda
for every time

766
00:57:44,158 --> 00:57:45,427
you've solved this crime.

767
00:57:45,494 --> 00:57:46,861
Oh, now.
Please don't kid me.

768
00:57:46,928 --> 00:57:48,296
You know I'm having
enough difficulty

769
00:57:48,363 --> 00:57:50,265
trying to be intelligent
down at headquarters.

770
00:57:50,332 --> 00:57:52,700
Why can't we talk about
something besides the case

771
00:57:52,767 --> 00:57:53,935
once in a while?

772
00:57:54,001 --> 00:57:56,938
Alright. Let's
talk about you.

773
00:57:57,005 --> 00:57:59,274
You're coming to the movies
with me, aren't you?

774
00:57:59,341 --> 00:58:02,444
- And me, so young.
- Coffee, Miss.

775
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:05,113
Yes.

776
00:58:06,781 --> 00:58:08,216
As you were saying.

777
00:58:08,282 --> 00:58:10,885
'All we need is one
tiny link to bind Elliott'

778
00:58:10,952 --> 00:58:12,353
'with the murder
of Miss Mitchell.'

779
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:14,089
'Or at least
a sound motivation.'

780
00:58:14,155 --> 00:58:16,124
Then we can forget clues
murders and confessions

781
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:19,494
and go places and do
things in the big way.

782
00:58:19,561 --> 00:58:21,229
Um, thanks.

783
00:58:21,296 --> 00:58:23,431
Uh, where's Hugo
tonight, Mary?

784
00:58:23,498 --> 00:58:25,099
I made him
go to bed, sir.

785
00:58:25,166 --> 00:58:27,068
I was afraid he'd
have a collapse.

786
00:58:27,135 --> 00:58:30,138
He's so upset about
Miss. Mitchell's death.

787
00:58:30,205 --> 00:58:32,874
- Cream, sir?
- No thanks.

788
00:58:35,343 --> 00:58:37,112
Hugo was devoted
to the old lady.

789
00:58:37,178 --> 00:58:38,813
There's a great
deal he knows

790
00:58:38,879 --> 00:58:40,615
that he's
not telling.

791
00:58:40,682 --> 00:58:41,917
[door opening]

792
00:58:44,786 --> 00:58:46,121
I'm going
to investigate.

793
00:59:00,968 --> 00:59:03,438
[dog barking]

794
00:59:08,309 --> 00:59:11,046
What is it?
Someone upstairs?

795
00:59:19,921 --> 00:59:22,057
[screaming]

796
00:59:27,761 --> 00:59:30,198
[screaming continues]

797
00:59:32,067 --> 00:59:34,102
Help! Help!

798
00:59:45,313 --> 00:59:46,281
[gunshot]

799
00:59:48,349 --> 00:59:49,618
[gunshot]

800
00:59:50,685 --> 00:59:51,953
[gunshot]

801
00:59:55,623 --> 00:59:58,059
- We got him, chief.
- I'll be right down.

802
01:00:03,731 --> 01:00:06,367
- Are you hurt?
- Uh, I'm getting used to it.

803
01:00:06,434 --> 01:00:08,603
You screamed loud enough
to bring out the militia.

804
01:00:08,670 --> 01:00:10,839
If you think it's any fun
having a Frankenstein

805
01:00:10,905 --> 01:00:14,776
leap at you every ten minutes
you're badly mistaken.

806
01:00:14,843 --> 01:00:16,478
Look!

807
01:00:24,052 --> 01:00:25,954
Hmm, chloroform.

808
01:00:33,961 --> 01:00:36,231
He's coming
out of it, alright.

809
01:00:36,297 --> 01:00:40,034
Now, listen. Miss Adams
just about saved your life.

810
01:00:40,101 --> 01:00:43,037
I think you better
tell us everything you know.

811
01:00:43,104 --> 01:00:44,939
I'll tell, alright.

812
01:00:45,006 --> 01:00:47,409
Listen. First get Miss Lenz.

813
01:00:50,278 --> 01:00:55,684
Get Florence Lenz
and I'll, I'll tell everything.

814
01:00:57,451 --> 01:00:59,587
(Patten)
'This is your
last chance. Understand?'

815
01:00:59,654 --> 01:01:03,391
It's no use. Lock me up.
I don't care what you do.

816
01:01:03,458 --> 01:01:05,259
I don't know anything about it.

817
01:01:05,326 --> 01:01:06,894
Alright.

818
01:01:06,961 --> 01:01:10,465
Wait. Leave me alone with her.
Maybe I can get something.

819
01:01:12,634 --> 01:01:16,203
Now, stop crying.
Try to. There.

820
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:17,705
I don't know
anything about it.

821
01:01:17,772 --> 01:01:20,541
You do. You know this
was an insurance swindle.

822
01:01:20,608 --> 01:01:22,777
That Wynn was to fake death
and disappear.

823
01:01:22,844 --> 01:01:24,279
I don't know anything.

824
01:01:24,345 --> 01:01:26,314
Can't you see we're
trying to help you?

825
01:01:26,381 --> 01:01:29,217
We know everything.
Hugo talked.

826
01:01:29,284 --> 01:01:31,585
- Yes. And it involved you.
- Hugo.

827
01:01:31,652 --> 01:01:34,255
He said, the man behind
this case would marry you

828
01:01:34,321 --> 01:01:37,191
after Wynn disappeared.
Hugo was to get a split.

829
01:01:37,258 --> 01:01:38,960
I don't know
anything about it.

830
01:01:39,026 --> 01:01:40,761
How can we help you
like this?

831
01:01:40,828 --> 01:01:43,464
Wynn made a mess of things
when he married Paula.

832
01:01:43,531 --> 01:01:46,367
He couldn't go through with
the suicide so he was murdered.

833
01:01:46,434 --> 01:01:48,269
- With his own gun.
- Suppose he was.

834
01:01:48,336 --> 01:01:50,604
- It has nothing to do with me.
- Only this.

835
01:01:50,671 --> 01:01:53,875
Next to go was Miss Mitchell.
'Cause she got the money.

836
01:01:53,942 --> 01:01:55,843
And name the killer
in her will.

837
01:01:55,909 --> 01:01:58,913
You put the arsenic tablets
in the tube on my tray.

838
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:00,782
Like the murderer
told you to do.

839
01:02:00,849 --> 01:02:02,250
It's not true.
It's not true.

840
01:02:02,317 --> 01:02:05,220
I didn't know
they were poisoned.

841
01:02:07,889 --> 01:02:10,825
Well, we can't stall around
any longer. Come on.

842
01:02:10,892 --> 01:02:12,293
She's changed her mind.
She'll talk.

843
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,929
Good. Now we know
Miss Mitchell was killed

844
01:02:14,996 --> 01:02:16,797
to make her will
become effective.

845
01:02:16,864 --> 01:02:20,201
Your testimony is what we need
to tie the two murders together.

846
01:02:20,268 --> 01:02:23,037
Are you willing
to make the identification?

847
01:02:23,104 --> 01:02:25,673
Yes.

848
01:02:30,544 --> 01:02:33,715
- Did you want to see me?
- Yes. Stand over there please.

849
01:02:44,792 --> 01:02:46,327
Is this the man?

850
01:02:46,394 --> 01:02:49,163
Now, look here. You said you're
going to make the identification

851
01:02:49,230 --> 01:02:50,531
and you're going through it.

852
01:02:50,598 --> 01:02:52,566
Did anyone in this room
give you tablets?

853
01:02:52,633 --> 01:02:55,603
Poison tablets. And tell to put
them in that medical tube.

854
01:02:55,669 --> 01:02:57,104
Yes.

855
01:02:57,171 --> 01:02:59,273
Do you identify
the prisoner as the man?

856
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:00,541
- 'Yes.'
- You rotten little liar.

857
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:02,577
Don't you call me names
you murderer.

858
01:03:02,643 --> 01:03:03,845
You made me one too.

859
01:03:03,912 --> 01:03:06,080
I thought those were
sleeping powders not arsenic.

860
01:03:06,147 --> 01:03:08,749
- Keep your mouth shut.
- Go on. This is good.

861
01:03:08,816 --> 01:03:11,452
Tell me one thing. Did Glenn
manufacture the powder burn

862
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:12,987
newspaper stunt for an alibi?

863
01:03:13,053 --> 01:03:15,056
Yes. Miss Mitchell
found it and hid it

864
01:03:15,122 --> 01:03:16,558
so she'd get
the insurance money.

865
01:03:16,624 --> 01:03:18,392
She didn't know
it was a murder.

866
01:03:18,459 --> 01:03:20,962
- You're all crazy.
- Oh, but you're not.

867
01:03:21,029 --> 01:03:23,597
You tried killing Hugo
so that he wouldn't talk.

868
01:03:23,664 --> 01:03:25,733
Then the statement
we witnessed was a fake.

869
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:28,369
Yes. We signed a blank
piece of paper folded over.

870
01:03:28,436 --> 01:03:30,404
Mr. Glenn wrote
the fake statement later.

871
01:03:30,471 --> 01:03:32,039
He thought
it would convict Elliot

872
01:03:32,106 --> 01:03:33,640
and stop further
investigation.

873
01:03:33,707 --> 01:03:35,343
That's all boys.
Take him downtown.

874
01:03:35,410 --> 01:03:36,845
She goes with him.

875
01:03:36,911 --> 01:03:39,480
Don't you worry.
He'll help you. I know he will.

876
01:03:39,546 --> 01:03:42,250
- Thanks.
- Thank you, doctor.

877
01:03:51,125 --> 01:03:53,294
- And that--
- Wraps that up.

878
01:03:53,361 --> 01:03:55,663
What about Charlie Elliott
languishing in yon jailhouse?

879
01:03:55,730 --> 01:03:58,099
He'll be out before
Miss Brent decides which dress

880
01:03:58,165 --> 01:03:59,366
she'll wear
to their wedding.

881
01:03:59,433 --> 01:04:00,968
You're a great
detective.

882
01:04:01,035 --> 01:04:02,603
I sometimes wonder
how far you'll get

883
01:04:02,670 --> 01:04:05,406
if these wicked criminals didn't
go around catching themselves.

884
01:04:05,472 --> 01:04:07,475
Come to think of it,
you've arrested practically

885
01:04:07,541 --> 01:04:09,810
everyone in this cast
except me.

886
01:04:09,877 --> 01:04:11,646
[telephone ringing]

887
01:04:11,712 --> 01:04:14,149
Oh, just as I'm
getting a break.

888
01:04:16,584 --> 01:04:18,219
Oh.

889
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:24,459
Hello.

890
01:04:25,326 --> 01:04:28,263
Yeah. Yeah.

891
01:04:29,764 --> 01:04:33,534
Yeah! Okay.

892
01:04:33,601 --> 01:04:36,004
Has Charlie Elliot confessed and
started the whole thing again?

893
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:39,140
No. A new case. At The Old Mills
hotel at Caesar Lake.

894
01:04:39,207 --> 01:04:42,009
And they've assigned me to it.
It's a swell double murder.

895
01:04:42,076 --> 01:04:45,480
Bodies found in the lake.
Lots of clues. Wanna come along?

896
01:04:45,546 --> 01:04:48,582
Me? Not for all the tea
in China. I'm going back

897
01:04:48,649 --> 01:04:50,618
to the hospital where
it's peaceful and calm.

898
01:04:50,685 --> 01:04:52,853
I want a change.
I got it and how.

899
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:55,690
Oh, but this is a big case.
I can smell it.

900
01:04:55,757 --> 01:04:57,791
You can smell
for the both of us.

901
01:04:57,858 --> 01:05:00,261
No, wait a minute, please.
There's something else--

902
01:05:00,328 --> 01:05:02,897
[screaming]

903
01:05:05,966 --> 01:05:08,803
A mouse.

904
01:05:13,874 --> 01:05:15,810
[theme music]
