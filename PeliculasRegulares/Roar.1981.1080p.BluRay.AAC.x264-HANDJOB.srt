1
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:29,747
Okay Pop, hello buddy.

2
00:05:29,956 --> 00:05:31,999
Hello lions. What are you doin'?

3
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,335
What's that rogue,
Togar doin' here?

4
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,631
God Togar, why
today of all days?

5
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:55,398
Okay, come on. Let's play chase.

6
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:17,003
The closer we
get, more excited I get.

7
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:18,272
It should be great seeing him

8
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:19,297
after three years.

9
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:20,840
Yeah, I
couldn't believe how fast

10
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,759
he split for Africa
after he got his grants.

11
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:26,095
And the zoo let him take
the little cubs he raised.

12
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:28,139
You'd think he'd
take the kids he raised.

13
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:29,575
Well he
was going to send for us,

14
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:31,392
but he said it
was too dangerous.

15
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:34,145
He certainly didn't leave
because he didn't love us.

16
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:35,747
And you know how
depressed he used to get

17
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:39,108
with his cats kept in
cages all the time.

18
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,321
I wonder where he is.

19
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:45,239
Why don't we try to
find our own way there?

20
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:46,741
You're joking.

21
00:06:46,908 --> 00:06:51,287
Where could he be?

22
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:55,225
Boy you guys wait 'til my
family gets here tonight.

23
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:58,085
Are they gonna love you.

24
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:39,710
Oops, sorry Hank.

25
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,239
And I thought you
came to help me.

26
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:42,338
I did.

27
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:44,191
I came to speak for you
with that committee,

28
00:07:44,215 --> 00:07:45,800
and take you to
pick up your family.

29
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:47,969
Well come on ashore a while.

30
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:49,470
Are you crazy?

31
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:53,182
The committee is on their
way here to renew your grant.

32
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:54,642
Monster.

33
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,144
Come on, you gotta
help me clean the house.

34
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:59,188
Mmm, not today;
today doesn't seem like

35
00:07:59,397 --> 00:08:02,191
a good day to come in.

36
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:06,070
Hey where are you going?

37
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:15,204
Not my jacket!

38
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:26,257
Throw it here.
Come on over here.

39
00:08:31,137 --> 00:08:34,348
Stay
there. How's she doing?

40
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:36,600
Look.

41
00:08:41,147 --> 00:08:42,147
This is a madhouse.

42
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:43,816
No it isn't. It's
just like life.

43
00:08:43,983 --> 00:08:45,985
You get the funny
with the tragic.

44
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:47,273
It's just with them you get

45
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:48,599
the gentle and
the ferocious too.

46
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:51,907
Be careful of the bad,
and enjoy the good.

47
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:53,114
You aren't careful enough.

48
00:08:53,284 --> 00:08:54,428
Well for my
studies I have to get

49
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:58,789
as close to them as possible.

50
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:01,542
You know, actually, the
closer you get to them,

51
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:05,046
the more they'd like you
and the safer you'd be.

52
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,548
But look! He's
going to jump on us.

53
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:11,552
No no no no,
they're just playing.

54
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:15,056
They like to play the
old cat and mouse game.

55
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,222
Here I'll cover ya.

56
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,018
Oh big John.

57
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:23,022
No, if you just look at
'em, or you run at em.

58
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:27,026
No look.

59
00:09:27,193 --> 00:09:31,864
What? Oh ah ah ah ah,
you leave him alone.

60
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,955
Oh that's Johnny Lion, you
never have to worry about John.

61
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:42,958
Are you scaring him?

62
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,252
You know you gotta
watch out for Mark.

63
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:48,756
No, he's okay. This is Charlie.

64
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:52,384
And you gotta watch
out for Barry, okay?

65
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,266
It's just playing
I'm tellin' ya.

66
00:09:59,475 --> 00:10:00,810
But you could get killed.

67
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:04,897
The cats got a little
excited, that's all.

68
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:14,281
Are you
okay? You're crazy.

69
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:20,496
Oh Mativo, there's Robbie.

70
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:22,289
You've never met Robbie.

71
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:23,958
He's always out
guarding his borders

72
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,543
in the daytime,

73
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,109
and you're always
too afraid to come

74
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:28,963
and visit me at night.

75
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:32,758
Now he's the nicest
cat in the world.

76
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:35,928
And he's also the top cat here.

77
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:38,055
Yeah. He's the boss.

78
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:39,557
I work for him.

79
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:40,765
Hey Rob,

80
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:46,313
Well come here. I want
you to meet Mativo.

81
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:51,110
See actually it's Robby
I'm worried about.

82
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:55,489
Their whole life is
based on dominance.

83
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:57,658
That's why we have such
a great harmony here,

84
00:10:57,867 --> 00:11:01,537
because Robbie is such a
gentle and loving ruler.

85
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:09,336
He also knows he has to protect
the others from outsiders.

86
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:12,256
Right now he's very
worried about Togar.

87
00:11:12,423 --> 00:11:15,301
He's also worried that if the
others see that he's worried

88
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:20,097
or afraid, that then they'll
start challenging him

89
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:23,434
like they've been
each other all day.

90
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:29,565
No matter how afraid
he is at this moment,

91
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:33,235
he still knows he has
to see this through.

92
00:11:34,195 --> 00:11:38,032
The whole meaning of his
life is before him, Mativo.

93
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,164
That's why you have to help me.

94
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:47,291
I have to what? Why?

95
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,127
Because I have to
help him, Mativo.

96
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:55,424
And he could get killed.

97
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,846
Don't worry, I'm gonna help ya.

98
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:05,100
I don't think you
should count on me.

99
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:07,811
But Only yesterday
they were so happy.

100
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,188
Now look at them.

101
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,148
Finally on the verge
of finding paradise,

102
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:12,877
and the only thing
lacking is my family

103
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:13,776
to share it with me.

104
00:12:13,943 --> 00:12:15,778
And Togar comes in wrecking it.

105
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:17,404
Here comes trouble.

106
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:21,992
It's a grand committee,
but Prentiss is with them.

107
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:29,333
Listen my friend, let me talk.

108
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,211
Good morning everybody.

109
00:12:32,378 --> 00:12:33,605
I would like to
open this meeting

110
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:36,882
by reminding you all that

111
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:40,135
Hank's original idea
was a comparative study

112
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:42,888
of the great cats of the wild.

113
00:12:43,097 --> 00:12:45,891
And while observing
the African cats

114
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,520
in their natural habitat,
he will raise several cats

115
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,981
of each species.

116
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:55,359
Be they African or otherwise.

117
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:59,154
And to become almost like
a member of the pride.

118
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:04,243
Hey it has stripes! It must
be another Tigon or a Liger.

119
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:09,039
The mother's a lioness,
the father must be a tiger.

120
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:10,958
Say hello to Henry
the Jaguar, would ya?

121
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,166
Not today.

122
00:13:15,296 --> 00:13:17,006
What are you trying to prove?

123
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,174
That you can have lions
socializing with people?

124
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:21,802
No, but we can't keep
exterminating them.

125
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:24,596
We can't keep
eliminating their land.

126
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:26,307
We can't keep
exterminating everything

127
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:29,143
that we fear, or that
inconveniences us.

128
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:31,020
Let the zoos keep them alive.

129
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:33,731
Prentiss, your actions
aren't necessary.

130
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:35,333
The government knows
there's a better way.

131
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:36,108
They're moving the people out of

132
00:13:36,317 --> 00:13:38,110
the migration paths.

133
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:39,546
I don't know what kind of person

134
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,090
could look in the
eyes of 200 elephants

135
00:13:41,155 --> 00:13:43,115
and put out those lights.

136
00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:44,533
They run frantically in panic

137
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:46,062
trying to protect
their children--

138
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:47,304
Do you think your lions
would run and panic?

139
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:48,996
You better start with me first.

140
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:51,874
No I'll start with
the tigers first.

141
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:55,002
That'll teach you for
bringing them to Africa.

142
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:07,014
I gotta go help your uncles;
they're killing each other.

143
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:17,191
Stop it! Stop It! Hey! Hey!

144
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:23,280
Calm down!

145
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:34,458
Togar!

146
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:51,725
Togar! Togar!

147
00:15:15,124 --> 00:15:19,253
You stay out of it. You let
Robbie take care of him.

148
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:22,548
Yeah, you guys are smart;
you stayed out of it.

149
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:25,926
Oh Craig, hi Tommy, Jimmy.

150
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:30,055
Oh aw. You hide in here?

151
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:38,272
I don't blame you, all
those guys are fighting.

152
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:20,814
Over the
side! This way! Git!

153
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:27,112
That's my jacket.

154
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:46,089
Help!

155
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,680
Hank!

156
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:04,233
Hank get out here!

157
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,711
Hank! Hank!

158
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,179
Hank get out here!

159
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:00,122
Get him off me!

160
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:10,423
Run!

161
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:14,219
Woah hey.

162
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:40,912
Come on, go in the house
and get some bandages.

163
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:42,748
Oh what the hell's
wrong with you?

164
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,125
All you got's a few scratches.

165
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:47,544
You're lucky Togar
didn't getcha.

166
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:58,055
I think you should take our bus.

167
00:18:58,263 --> 00:18:59,014
It goes right by there.

168
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:02,017
Oh no, well I
think we should wait.

169
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:05,520
No; if you wait until
tonight, and it doesn't come,

170
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:07,397
there is no other
bus for two days.

171
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:12,027
And there is no place
for you to stay here.

172
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:15,280
Well what'll we do?

173
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:19,326
Will he know where to take us?

174
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:24,164
Oh come on. I'll
tell him for you.

175
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:48,355
Hey, she's dry.
Alice has no milk.

176
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:50,148
Listen, I have to go change.

177
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:51,315
I'll go back to my boat.

178
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:52,358
Okay.

179
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:54,236
Maybe I'll come with you.

180
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:02,369
If he claws ya--

181
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:03,954
What do I do now?

182
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:05,664
just stand up to
them, don't let them

183
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:06,998
get away with anything.

184
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:08,959
You gotta let 'em see
how strong you are.

185
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:11,670
Come on lions. We have to
clean the house for Madelaine.

186
00:20:11,837 --> 00:20:13,130
Come on lions.

187
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:18,760
Come on lions.

188
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:21,179
Come on Diane. Come on Michael.

189
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:23,932
Come on Patrick.

190
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:29,479
Are you sure there aren't
any more big ones in here?

191
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:38,655
Well hello Gary.

192
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:41,275
Why didn't you go with your--

193
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:44,601
Why didn't you go
with your friends?

194
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:50,876
Come on, you should
go with your friends.

195
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:58,175
Aw come on.

196
00:20:58,383 --> 00:20:59,583
You really changed this place.

197
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:02,095
New curtains, new
drapes, new everything.

198
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:04,681
Come on, go with your friends.

199
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:08,226
Come on. Oh yes.

200
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:09,978
You have to go
with your friends.

201
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:11,938
Come on.

202
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:20,947
Come on.

203
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:25,160
Aw don't worry Davie.
Robbie can handle Togar.

204
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:29,080
Your father's tougher
than you think.

205
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:32,167
Come on.

206
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:34,544
Oh come on, you'll hurt my hand.

207
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:39,007
See I got a hand hurt.

208
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:47,182
Come on. Come on Davie.

209
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:01,446
I think I drove Togar as
far away as 200 miles.

210
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:04,574
This is the first
time he's come in.

211
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:06,183
I have a hunch that
Robbie and Togar

212
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:08,078
could be brothers.

213
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:10,705
You know Bugsy and Robbie
were both rogue lions.

214
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:13,124
I found them dying
from battle wounds.

215
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,043
Now if Togar were sick or dying,

216
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,712
these guys'd
probably accept him.

217
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:19,172
But the way he is now, --

218
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:20,381
Vicious alright.

219
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:21,925
Well he can't help that.

220
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:24,719
As a loner he's too slow to
catch his normal dinners.

221
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:27,305
And the hungrier he gets,
the more desperate he gets.

222
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:30,016
The more desperate he gets,
the more ferocious he gets,

223
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:32,727
because the only way he
can eat most of the time

224
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:36,940
is by taking his meals
from whole prides of lions.

225
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:38,984
You gotta be pretty
ferocious to do that.

226
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:43,613
Sooner or later, he's
gonna get killed.

227
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,907
Come on Gary.

228
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:11,683
Billy.

229
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:16,605
Hey, don't try to frighten me.

230
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:19,024
Leave that alone!

231
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:22,277
That's my jacket!

232
00:23:25,947 --> 00:23:28,408
Hey Hank, come and help me.

233
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:33,163
He's got my jacket!

234
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:36,666
Gimme that Jacket.
That's my jacket!

235
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:49,596
Hank!

236
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:55,936
Hank! Help!

237
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:01,733
Help! Help!

238
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:09,449
Get back. Come on.
You leave him alone.

239
00:24:09,658 --> 00:24:14,162
Leave him alone.
Hey! Leave him alone.

240
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:20,710
They almost killed me.

241
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:22,921
You know you're
not supposed to run.

242
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:26,049
My head knew it,
but my feet didn't.

243
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:33,765
Oh. Hi babe. Oh.

244
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:39,187
Put them out.

245
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:41,481
They're trying to
stay away from Togar.

246
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:42,690
Come on.

247
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:44,192
Why do they have to be in here?

248
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:45,753
Why this open door
policy you have here

249
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:47,153
anyway with them?

250
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,448
All the doors are closed except
for here and the bathroom.

251
00:24:50,615 --> 00:24:52,951
There's nothing they can
tear up here or the bathroom.

252
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,452
Put them out.

253
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:55,954
Mativo this is their home!

254
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:57,348
What do you think
you're running?

255
00:24:57,372 --> 00:24:58,415
A country club for lions?

256
00:24:58,581 --> 00:24:59,749
Come on, sit down here.

257
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:09,968
Sit down. You're okay. Oh.

258
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:18,018
Sit down. You're okay, sit down.

259
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:33,116
Hey no more fighting.

260
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:34,993
Come here.

261
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,163
Aww. Sit down. You're okay.

262
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:39,039
Poor David You are okay.

263
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:40,623
You are okay.

264
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:44,085
These stupid lions
are frightening me.

265
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:45,045
And you want to bring Madelaine

266
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:46,546
and the children into this?

267
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:49,132
This'll be great for 'em.

268
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:53,053
Not boxed in like
back in Chicago.

269
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:58,308
Hey, wait a minute.

270
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:34,552
I just thought he had
a cataract starting.

271
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:37,472
That's Billy. He's great.

272
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:43,144
They're right. You be on something.
I couldn't last a day.

273
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:45,563
Expect her to sleep
with the lions are you?

274
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:49,901
What do you care if
I sleep with my wife?

275
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:59,077
Mom, did you know that a man

276
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:02,205
can have as many wives
as he wants to here?

277
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:04,582
And what is that
supposed to mean?

278
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:06,231
I mean how could
you be away from dad

279
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,669
for so long?

280
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:10,046
You know that your father
and I were having problems,

281
00:27:10,213 --> 00:27:12,274
and we thought it would be
better to be apart for a while.

282
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:14,843
You know, absence makes
the heart grow fonder?

283
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:16,278
The heart maybe, but what about

284
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:18,346
the sex glands?

285
00:27:18,513 --> 00:27:20,807
Sex is all you think
about lately young lady.

286
00:27:21,015 --> 00:27:22,201
You'd better watch it,
or you're gonna get

287
00:27:22,225 --> 00:27:25,145
your little tail in trouble.

288
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:27,031
Some day I hope you'll
understand the beauty

289
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:28,731
of restraint and self-denial.

290
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:31,985
Well I hope it wasn't
restraint and self-denial

291
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:35,947
that drove dad away.

292
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:40,410
- Hey Mativo.
- Yeah?

293
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:41,762
You know what my kids used to do

294
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:43,496
every time I started to sing?

295
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:48,042
They'd hold their hands over
their ears and say, oh no.

296
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:50,336
Or they'd turn on the radio.

297
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:54,299
Hey, hey, don't
let them in the boat.

298
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:57,760
You're crazy.

299
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:08,605
I think he said
it's just over the hill.

300
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:45,808
I can't steer!

301
00:28:49,354 --> 00:28:52,649
I think we are sinking.

302
00:28:59,322 --> 00:29:02,533
Abandon ship!

303
00:29:07,205 --> 00:29:11,376
Hey Mativo. Hey Mativo,
climb out over that way.

304
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:26,599
Don't swim, they'll get you.

305
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:41,239
Mom, come here and look.

306
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:46,160
It's fantastic.

307
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:47,161
Dad?

308
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:48,328
Dad.

309
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:51,040
Hey dad.

310
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:06,180
Dad?

311
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,643
Hank?

312
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,320
Hello?

313
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:21,612
Hank?

314
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:23,948
Dad?

315
00:30:24,115 --> 00:30:27,243
We're here.

316
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:31,998
Dad?

317
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:36,836
Oh dear.

318
00:30:37,003 --> 00:30:40,131
Hey dad.

319
00:30:44,177 --> 00:30:45,178
Hank?

320
00:30:53,728 --> 00:30:55,146
This is really a nice place.

321
00:30:55,313 --> 00:30:59,817
Come on up.
This place is really wild.

322
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:03,237
I'd give
anything for some sleep.

323
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:07,825
I don't understand.

324
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:13,373
Is that a tarantula?

325
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:17,251
Huh? You simple minded jerk!

326
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:20,755
Stop that!

327
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:41,484
Look.

328
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:54,080
Oh my god.

329
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,961
Where could he be?

330
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:14,058
Jerry, run and
open all the windows.

331
00:32:14,267 --> 00:32:18,187
Then we'll dust everything
and surprise your father.

332
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:33,411
Melanie?

333
00:32:43,004 --> 00:32:44,172
Hey a motorcycle.

334
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,215
I just saw a
thing. I think it was a pelican.

335
00:32:46,424 --> 00:32:49,218
It's a Kawasaki.

336
00:32:50,887 --> 00:32:54,807
Holy mackerel! Look at that!

337
00:32:56,225 --> 00:32:58,936
I don't believe what I'm seeing.

338
00:32:59,103 --> 00:33:00,313
Those can't be Dad's lions.

339
00:33:15,578 --> 00:33:20,041
Oh god. Look
what the cat dragged in.

340
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,050
Melanie?

341
00:34:12,093 --> 00:34:12,843
Mom.

342
00:34:13,052 --> 00:34:15,596
Get in here. Get in here.

343
00:34:19,392 --> 00:34:23,145
Jerry. John!

344
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:45,209
Where's mom and Mel?

345
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,128
They're downstairs. Come on.

346
00:34:47,295 --> 00:34:50,840
What is going on down there?

347
00:34:56,012 --> 00:34:58,014
Let's go down.

348
00:34:58,222 --> 00:34:59,599
Woah!

349
00:35:05,104 --> 00:35:07,106
Woah Uh!

350
00:35:11,569 --> 00:35:14,322
Go back.

351
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,828
Boy have we got troubles.

352
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:22,117
Where'd they all come from?

353
00:35:28,711 --> 00:35:29,711
Nice lion.

354
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:33,049
Nice lion.

355
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,813
Oh no!

356
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:58,194
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

357
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:04,158
Help? Uhh.

358
00:38:21,592 --> 00:38:22,592
Woah!

359
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:24,153
Melanie? Are you alright?

360
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:25,865
Yeah but I'm scared, Mom.

361
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:28,659
Oh I know honey, so am I.

362
00:39:54,184 --> 00:39:57,855
Oh honey stay here.
I'll go get the boys.

363
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:01,233
Hey. Hello.

364
00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:02,234
John?

365
00:40:02,401 --> 00:40:05,738
I'm in here.

366
00:40:28,552 --> 00:40:32,056
John are you alright?

367
00:40:34,934 --> 00:40:36,977
Where's Jerry?

368
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:38,729
Help! Help!

369
00:40:38,896 --> 00:40:41,190
Jerry. Jerry?

370
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:43,067
Oh god!

371
00:40:48,739 --> 00:40:49,865
Are you alright?

372
00:40:50,032 --> 00:40:51,575
You coulda suffocated!

373
00:40:51,742 --> 00:40:53,661
You coulda died dummy!

374
00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:56,080
Shut
up. I almost died.

375
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:57,122
What kinda jerk

376
00:40:57,289 --> 00:41:00,084
would hide himself in an icebox?

377
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,044
Okay?

378
00:41:02,211 --> 00:41:04,672
Yeah.

379
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:10,469
Get me outta here!

380
00:41:10,636 --> 00:41:15,099
Help! Mom! John! Jerry!

381
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:19,269
In here.

382
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:21,479
Jerry hurry.

383
00:41:21,647 --> 00:41:22,856
Right here!

384
00:41:23,065 --> 00:41:24,650
Come on.
One, two, three.

385
00:41:32,533 --> 00:41:34,326
Maybe there's some
guns 'round here.

386
00:41:34,535 --> 00:41:35,828
We gotta find a gun.

387
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:38,080
I think we ought
to split while we can.

388
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:41,542
Yeah sure with 8,000
lions and tigers outside.

389
00:41:41,709 --> 00:41:44,086
Well if we stay here, we'll
end up being eaten alive.

390
00:41:44,294 --> 00:41:45,796
We're not gonna get eaten.

391
00:41:46,005 --> 00:41:48,085
When Dad gets here, he'll
show us how to handle them.

392
00:41:48,132 --> 00:41:50,050
Until then, we'll just
board up the windows.

393
00:41:50,217 --> 00:41:51,510
Wait a minute.
Who voted you in?

394
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:53,762
I did. I suppose you
wanna make a run for it?

395
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:56,140
Right on. I'll take the
motorcycle and go get help.

396
00:41:56,348 --> 00:41:58,228
I know bikes, and I know
the road we came in on.

397
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,477
That's not gonna help;
that's letting you escape,

398
00:42:00,644 --> 00:42:02,104
and leaving us here.

399
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:48,127
- John! Shoot 'em!
- No!

400
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:54,299
- John! Shoot 'em!
- No!

401
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:30,377
Give me your handkerchief John.

402
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:41,889
I wanna go home.

403
00:44:42,055 --> 00:44:43,473
Madelaine's gonna kill me.

404
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,392
It'll go much faster
if you go up there

405
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:46,977
and borrow some bicycles.

406
00:44:47,144 --> 00:44:48,145
Okay.

407
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:49,062
I'll take the tigers.

408
00:44:49,271 --> 00:44:50,582
I'll go 'round back
of the village.

409
00:44:50,606 --> 00:44:51,648
Good move.

410
00:45:28,101 --> 00:45:31,438
Don't tell
me, he said, you said.

411
00:45:31,647 --> 00:45:33,232
I'm not interested
in your bickering.

412
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:34,900
Who asked you to go over there?

413
00:45:35,067 --> 00:45:36,902
I can go on
any property to kill animals

414
00:45:37,069 --> 00:45:39,571
that I deem are a
danger to human lives.

415
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,949
Don't tell me
you care about his family.

416
00:45:42,115 --> 00:45:44,785
I'm telling you there'll be
no culling of cats, elephants,

417
00:45:44,993 --> 00:45:46,745
or any animals ever again.

418
00:45:46,912 --> 00:45:48,348
Well you should
have been at his madhouse

419
00:45:48,372 --> 00:45:49,998
and seen those
cats this morning.

420
00:45:50,165 --> 00:45:51,583
I don't care what you say.

421
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:54,336
You are not going to go out
there and slaughter his animals.

422
00:45:54,544 --> 00:45:56,104
We cull elephants
if there are too many.

423
00:45:56,255 --> 00:45:58,882
Prentiss, you're
completely out of line.

424
00:45:59,049 --> 00:46:01,510
You are not going
to kill those cats.

425
00:46:01,718 --> 00:46:03,220
You can tell me
what you're gonna do.

426
00:46:03,387 --> 00:46:04,530
And you can tell
me what the rest of

427
00:46:04,554 --> 00:46:07,766
this committee's gonna do, Rick.

428
00:46:07,975 --> 00:46:09,935
But I'll be damned if
you're gonna tell me

429
00:46:10,102 --> 00:46:13,188
what I'm gonna do.

430
00:46:17,484 --> 00:46:19,361
We can't store two tigers.

431
00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:21,488
Well I tried
to make them go home.

432
00:46:21,697 --> 00:46:22,406
How come they are not doing

433
00:46:22,614 --> 00:46:23,657
what you are telling them.

434
00:46:23,824 --> 00:46:24,533
Well they're not trained pets.

435
00:46:24,741 --> 00:46:26,576
They're just friends.

436
00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:32,082
Stay off my back.

437
00:46:36,128 --> 00:46:37,796
Come on. Where are you going?

438
00:46:38,005 --> 00:46:39,840
Come on down.

439
00:46:40,048 --> 00:46:42,134
You go. I'm not going.

440
00:46:42,301 --> 00:46:43,427
You know, you're right.

441
00:46:43,593 --> 00:46:45,012
I can't go to the
airport with them.

442
00:46:45,178 --> 00:46:47,014
They'll go right in with me.

443
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:49,349
Hey I got an idea for ya.

444
00:46:49,558 --> 00:46:50,851
Hang down off that branch.

445
00:46:51,059 --> 00:46:51,852
- Huh?
- Let your feet

446
00:46:52,019 --> 00:46:53,061
hang down here.

447
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:54,062
- What?
- Kick your feet.

448
00:46:54,271 --> 00:46:55,063
They'll jump right
up and try to getcha.

449
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:55,772
Then they'll stay here.

450
00:46:55,981 --> 00:46:56,690
I can sneak away.

451
00:46:56,857 --> 00:46:59,234
No, no. I'm not doing that.

452
00:46:59,443 --> 00:47:02,029
- Listen.
- Uh huh?

453
00:47:02,195 --> 00:47:04,072
Take your shirt off, okay?

454
00:47:04,281 --> 00:47:06,283
And dangle it down.

455
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:10,078
Hold it by the sleeve.

456
00:47:11,705 --> 00:47:16,376
There you go.

457
00:47:28,388 --> 00:47:31,183
Hurry back!

458
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:23,652
Why did you bring us here.

459
00:48:23,819 --> 00:48:25,320
We're just gonna die.

460
00:48:25,487 --> 00:48:26,947
No we are not going to die.

461
00:48:28,323 --> 00:48:28,907
Your father is going
to be here soon.

462
00:48:29,074 --> 00:48:30,074
And it'll be all over.

463
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,119
Well why isn't he here now?

464
00:48:32,285 --> 00:48:35,163
He knew we were coming!

465
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:38,542
You can belly-ache all you
want about him staying away.

466
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:41,586
But if he's not here
it's because he's dead.

467
00:48:41,753 --> 00:48:45,382
And he's not coming. I know it.

468
00:49:11,283 --> 00:49:12,301
Boy I've been ready to do this

469
00:49:12,325 --> 00:49:14,327
for a long time.

470
00:49:14,536 --> 00:49:17,080
Don't you think we should wait?

471
00:49:18,498 --> 00:49:19,958
We shouldn't load
anything smaller

472
00:49:20,125 --> 00:49:23,128
than a .30-06 for a lion.

473
00:50:02,125 --> 00:50:03,125
Lenny?

474
00:50:05,295 --> 00:50:08,089
Aw Leonard, Leonard, Leonard.

475
00:50:08,298 --> 00:50:09,382
Okay.

476
00:50:13,637 --> 00:50:15,931
Okay, okay.

477
00:50:54,928 --> 00:50:56,638
Come on. Put your
bike in the trunk.

478
00:50:56,805 --> 00:50:58,125
They must be in
the house already.

479
00:50:58,181 --> 00:51:00,141
They took the bus yesterday.

480
00:51:00,308 --> 00:51:01,308
Nikki, get in the car.

481
00:51:01,434 --> 00:51:03,103
Come on. Get in the back.

482
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:04,471
Come on Greg, get in with us.

483
00:51:04,646 --> 00:51:06,064
Come on Greg.

484
00:51:06,273 --> 00:51:07,649
That's a good boy.

485
00:51:07,857 --> 00:51:08,692
That's a good boy.

486
00:51:08,858 --> 00:51:11,611
Turn around.

487
00:51:19,786 --> 00:51:22,414
He is trying to
close me in the trunk!

488
00:51:22,622 --> 00:51:25,292
Hey come on, get in.

489
00:51:30,213 --> 00:51:33,967
Hey, well come on. Get in.

490
00:51:34,134 --> 00:51:36,094
Crazy. With them in the back?

491
00:51:36,303 --> 00:51:37,387
They'll bite my head off.

492
00:51:37,596 --> 00:51:39,514
Either get in or
walk, 'cause I'm goin'.

493
00:51:39,723 --> 00:51:42,100
Make them walk.

494
00:51:42,267 --> 00:51:43,768
This is madness.

495
00:51:43,935 --> 00:51:45,812
If somebody sees them
this far from my place

496
00:51:46,021 --> 00:51:47,647
They'll shoot 'em.

497
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,152
These are your friends huh?

498
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:53,599
And do you know
what your friends

499
00:51:53,653 --> 00:51:56,156
are probably doing to
your family right now?

500
00:51:56,364 --> 00:51:58,325
They are making dinner of them.

501
00:51:58,491 --> 00:52:00,660
They are eating them.

502
00:52:00,869 --> 00:52:02,037
Tivo, shut up.

503
00:52:02,203 --> 00:52:03,663
They are sitting
around eating them,

504
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:05,040
cracking their bones.

505
00:52:05,206 --> 00:52:06,206
Shut up.

506
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:07,602
They are licking
their bones clean.

507
00:52:07,626 --> 00:52:10,837
Shut up!

508
00:52:11,046 --> 00:52:12,047
Who are you?

509
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:16,051
Come on.

510
00:52:42,619 --> 00:52:44,412
Hey! Don't go so fast.

511
00:52:44,621 --> 00:52:45,914
It's too bumpy.

512
00:52:46,122 --> 00:52:49,793
I have to Mativo.

513
00:52:56,049 --> 00:52:58,259
By the way, do they know

514
00:52:58,426 --> 00:53:00,553
that they should not run?

515
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,000
You should have sent them a list

516
00:53:02,138 --> 00:53:05,892
of rules and regulations
before they came.

517
00:53:15,026 --> 00:53:19,114
Aw. Poor Leonard.

518
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:14,646
Let's get out of here.

519
00:55:14,854 --> 00:55:15,854
Only Melanie was right.

520
00:55:15,897 --> 00:55:19,234
Let's go take the boat.

521
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:35,041
Jerry okay, you go
first. Go ahead.

522
00:55:46,386 --> 00:55:47,428
Woah. Melanie.

523
00:55:47,637 --> 00:55:48,888
Oh there's a tiger!

524
00:56:14,163 --> 00:56:16,374
Faster!

525
00:56:32,557 --> 00:56:34,100
Go John!

526
00:56:43,151 --> 00:56:44,652
John. John!

527
00:56:49,282 --> 00:56:51,826
John, jump out!

528
00:57:05,924 --> 00:57:09,260
Jerry! You're going
the wrong way!

529
00:57:18,227 --> 00:57:21,314
Go John! Go!

530
00:57:31,741 --> 00:57:33,743
Melanie get in the boat.

531
00:57:45,964 --> 00:57:47,131
Going right into shore.

532
00:57:47,298 --> 00:57:48,424
Jerry watch out.

533
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:00,395
Go back this way.

534
00:58:00,561 --> 00:58:02,772
Come on, sport.

535
00:58:09,946 --> 00:58:12,824
Boy that was close.

536
00:58:21,666 --> 00:58:23,835
Get away!

537
00:58:24,002 --> 00:58:25,002
Get away from me!

538
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:25,605
Put her down!

539
00:59:25,772 --> 00:59:28,024
Help me! Help me!

540
00:59:28,232 --> 00:59:29,650
Let go of her!

541
00:59:33,571 --> 00:59:37,075
Help! Help! Help!

542
00:59:43,998 --> 00:59:46,793
Help me!

543
01:00:39,053 --> 01:00:42,390
Aw less then ten
miles to go and we're stuck.

544
01:00:42,598 --> 01:00:43,598
What's wrong?

545
01:00:43,724 --> 01:00:44,993
The jack won't work in the sand.

546
01:00:45,017 --> 01:00:46,662
And the more I dig, the
more the car slides.

547
01:00:46,686 --> 01:00:47,812
I'll have to run.

548
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:49,730
But you know you're
not supposed to run.

549
01:00:49,939 --> 01:00:51,299
You hold the tigers
back, would ya?

550
01:00:51,357 --> 01:00:52,900
- So they don't tackle me.
- What?

551
01:00:53,109 --> 01:00:54,402
Just use this. Use this.

552
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:58,114
Use this. Go like that.

553
01:01:24,473 --> 01:01:26,100
Hey Prentiss, did you see that?

554
01:01:26,309 --> 01:01:28,519
Got 'em right through the neck.

555
01:01:28,686 --> 01:01:29,955
- Sooner or later--
- If we're not--

556
01:01:29,979 --> 01:01:30,646
the lions are gonna get us.

557
01:01:30,855 --> 01:01:32,148
he'll be back.

558
01:01:32,356 --> 01:01:33,375
- I'm gonna go for help.
- Why stay here?

559
01:01:33,399 --> 01:01:33,983
Now let's make sure
that all the other doors

560
01:01:34,192 --> 01:01:35,193
in the house are secure.

561
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,111
I hate this place here!

562
01:01:37,278 --> 01:01:39,113
I don't think there's
a good decision.

563
01:01:52,585 --> 01:01:53,377
- John?
- Hey!

564
01:01:53,544 --> 01:01:55,171
I'm gonna get help!

565
01:01:55,338 --> 01:01:56,380
And leave us here?

566
01:01:56,589 --> 01:01:57,882
I'm gonna get help.

567
01:01:58,090 --> 01:01:59,967
I thought it was suicide!

568
01:02:00,134 --> 01:02:01,134
Good luck, son.

569
01:02:20,279 --> 01:02:22,031
Oh no!

570
01:03:49,535 --> 01:03:52,913
Ow. Get out of here.

571
01:03:55,374 --> 01:03:59,587
Open the door. Come on.

572
01:03:59,795 --> 01:04:02,048
Go on. Get out of
here. Leave it!

573
01:04:02,214 --> 01:04:05,134
Go on. Leave it.

574
01:04:11,223 --> 01:04:13,309
Jerry open the door. Come on.

575
01:04:13,476 --> 01:04:16,729
You think I'm crazy?

576
01:04:57,103 --> 01:04:58,103
What kind of jerk

577
01:04:58,145 --> 01:05:00,272
would go off the
roof on a motorcycle?

578
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:04,026
Get off of her!

579
01:05:12,201 --> 01:05:13,828
Ugh heavy.

580
01:05:19,041 --> 01:05:20,126
No!

581
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:31,178
Melanie. John, Jerry!

582
01:05:31,971 --> 01:05:32,971
Where are you?

583
01:05:33,055 --> 01:05:36,934
John! Jerry! Hurry!

584
01:05:37,101 --> 01:05:41,147
Melanie! Get up.

585
01:05:41,355 --> 01:05:45,401
No no no!

586
01:05:45,568 --> 01:05:47,653
What's wrong?

587
01:05:47,862 --> 01:05:50,990
Hey what are
you doin' on the floor?

588
01:05:53,784 --> 01:05:58,038
John I can't get my
leg out! Ow ow ow ow!

589
01:05:58,247 --> 01:05:59,915
Come on, hurry.
Get out. I'll hold 'em.

590
01:06:00,082 --> 01:06:03,419
I'll hold 'em.

591
01:06:03,586 --> 01:06:07,047
Melanie come here.

592
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:18,726
Oh.
Oh my goodness.

593
01:06:19,727 --> 01:06:21,395
Jerry help your sister.

594
01:06:21,604 --> 01:06:23,189
He's just tryin' to kiss her.

595
01:06:23,355 --> 01:06:26,108
Still trying to open the door.

596
01:06:52,801 --> 01:06:55,596
You think
we have enough ammunition?

597
01:06:55,763 --> 01:06:57,056
I've got twenty in this belt,

598
01:06:57,223 --> 01:06:59,141
and thirty in the other.

599
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:02,645
Remember where all the cheetahs,
leopards, and tigers drop.

600
01:07:02,853 --> 01:07:05,439
We skin them on the way back.

601
01:07:05,606 --> 01:07:10,152
The lions are worthless.
Leave them for the hyenas.

602
01:07:42,142 --> 01:07:46,981
No! Get away.
Go on! Go on! Go!

603
01:11:48,305 --> 01:11:49,973
No!

604
01:11:51,683 --> 01:11:52,976
Come on!

605
01:12:49,867 --> 01:12:52,870
Hey mom, up on the roof!

606
01:12:56,206 --> 01:12:59,918
Mom go over the track!

607
01:13:34,328 --> 01:13:36,872
Come on mom.

608
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:41,418
See ma? It's another
house. It's completely safe.

609
01:13:41,627 --> 01:13:42,627
It's a good thing,

610
01:13:42,753 --> 01:13:45,172
because I can't
walk another step.

611
01:13:45,339 --> 01:13:46,840
I'm so tired my legs

612
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:48,175
are gonna buckle under me.

613
01:13:48,383 --> 01:13:51,261
I just have to
sleep for a while.

614
01:14:52,781 --> 01:14:56,076
Oh Donnie Lion!

615
01:14:58,912 --> 01:15:02,165
Come on my friend. Get up.

616
01:15:02,332 --> 01:15:05,335
Let's run again.

617
01:17:58,175 --> 01:18:02,888
Togar! Hey! Ahh!

618
01:18:22,490 --> 01:18:25,827
Togar not that way!

619
01:18:26,036 --> 01:18:30,081
Oh you poor stupid jerks.

620
01:18:30,248 --> 01:18:32,709
Togar not that way!

621
01:19:19,214 --> 01:19:22,092
Let's try to get 'em outside.

622
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:30,100
I don't think they're
tryin' to hurt us at all.

623
01:19:30,267 --> 01:19:33,812
Come on. Come on lion.

624
01:19:33,979 --> 01:19:37,107
Come
on lion. Come on.

625
01:20:00,171 --> 01:20:01,531
- Come on. Come on.
- Yeah, faster.

626
01:20:02,299 --> 01:20:04,467
Come on.

627
01:20:06,177 --> 01:20:09,180
Melanie, John,
get away from those lions.

628
01:20:09,389 --> 01:20:11,141
Mom, if they wanted to get us,

629
01:20:11,349 --> 01:20:13,560
they would have done it
while we were asleep.

630
01:20:13,727 --> 01:20:14,894
Come on.

631
01:20:16,354 --> 01:20:17,394
Are you sure it's alright?

632
01:20:20,317 --> 01:20:21,026
Make sure
the mother isn't around.

633
01:20:21,234 --> 01:20:22,569
They're cute.

634
01:20:30,744 --> 01:20:32,787
Oh look at!

635
01:20:40,086 --> 01:20:44,049
You're really friendly.

636
01:20:44,257 --> 01:20:48,636
Oh she's beautiful, isn't she?

637
01:21:08,114 --> 01:21:11,493
John.

638
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,166
Oh look at.

639
01:21:26,674 --> 01:21:30,845
You're really friendly.

640
01:21:31,054 --> 01:21:33,765
Oh she's beautiful isn't she?

641
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:39,979
Togar! Togar! Togar!

642
01:21:40,146 --> 01:21:44,526
Madelaine!

643
01:22:03,336 --> 01:22:07,715
John.

644
01:22:07,924 --> 01:22:08,924
Hello lion.

645
01:22:43,710 --> 01:22:46,421
Togar! Togar!

646
01:22:46,629 --> 01:22:51,009
Togar! Togar! Madelaine!

647
01:23:08,651 --> 01:23:10,028
Oh hello lions.

648
01:23:11,529 --> 01:23:14,532
Yeah you guys stay
away from Robbie.

649
01:23:32,634 --> 01:23:35,637
Hey kids how are ya?

650
01:23:38,014 --> 01:23:41,100
Oh oh. Woah!

651
01:23:49,234 --> 01:23:52,111
I better go help your ma.

652
01:23:56,866 --> 01:24:00,161
Hey Lynn, get off.
Come on, get up.

653
01:24:00,328 --> 01:24:01,829
Don't hit her Jerry, hug her.

654
01:24:01,996 --> 01:24:04,582
She wants you to hold her.

655
01:24:06,251 --> 01:24:07,794
Are you okay?

656
01:24:08,002 --> 01:24:10,213
I'm just so happy you're here.

657
01:24:14,384 --> 01:24:16,970
You're okay. Don't worry.

658
01:24:17,136 --> 01:24:18,136
Don't worry?

659
01:24:24,435 --> 01:24:26,020
Look at her.

660
01:24:29,691 --> 01:24:30,775
Oh I sure love ya.

661
01:24:30,984 --> 01:24:35,113
Oh I love you too.

662
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:38,283
Hey. Come on.

663
01:24:38,449 --> 01:24:41,327
Go away. Get away.

664
01:24:43,997 --> 01:24:46,207
Hi little gal.

665
01:24:57,969 --> 01:25:00,179
Listen, don't say anything
about Prentiss, okay?

666
01:25:00,346 --> 01:25:01,723
But he was killing your lions.

667
01:25:01,889 --> 01:25:03,576
I don't want you to say
anything about that either.

668
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,768
Don't spoil the reunion.
I'll tell them later.

669
01:25:05,977 --> 01:25:07,979
Listen I want you
to meet my family.

670
01:25:08,187 --> 01:25:09,227
This is my wife Madelaine.

671
01:25:09,397 --> 01:25:10,477
- Hello Madelaine.
- Mativo.

672
01:25:10,565 --> 01:25:11,608
This is my son, John.

673
01:25:11,774 --> 01:25:12,817
Hello how are you?

674
01:25:13,026 --> 01:25:13,735
Hello, nice to meet you.

675
01:25:13,901 --> 01:25:14,569
This is my daughter, Melanie.

676
01:25:14,777 --> 01:25:15,778
Melanie, Mativo.

677
01:25:15,987 --> 01:25:16,571
- Melanie, how are you?
- Hello.

678
01:25:16,738 --> 01:25:17,738
My son Jerry.

679
01:25:17,780 --> 01:25:18,865
Jerry huh.

680
01:25:19,032 --> 01:25:20,551
Come on this way. I
have a surprise for you.

681
01:25:20,575 --> 01:25:22,118
Boy are we glad to see you.

682
01:25:22,285 --> 01:25:23,995
What are y'all
doin' wearin' my clothes?

683
01:25:27,582 --> 01:25:31,085
Oh no. What happened?

684
01:25:31,294 --> 01:25:32,454
Jerry, get back. Form a line.

685
01:25:32,754 --> 01:25:34,130
They all want to meet you.

686
01:25:34,339 --> 01:25:35,339
We've already met 'em.

687
01:25:39,344 --> 01:25:41,929
Isn't this fantastic?

688
01:25:42,096 --> 01:25:42,889
What do you think?

689
01:25:43,097 --> 01:25:43,931
You guys gonna stay a while?

690
01:25:44,098 --> 01:25:45,224
Sure dad.

691
01:25:45,391 --> 01:25:47,351
I don't have to be back
to Chicago 'til next week.
