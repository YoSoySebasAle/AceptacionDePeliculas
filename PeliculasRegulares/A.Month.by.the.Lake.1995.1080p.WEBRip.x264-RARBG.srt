1
00:00:21,155 --> 00:00:23,691
The story
begins on Lake Como,

2
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:27,095
many years ago during
that last fantastic Summer

3
00:00:27,128 --> 00:00:28,396
before the war.

                                                                        

8
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:56,056
Hello.

9
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,729
                                                                                     Returning
to the lake

10
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:04,432
has always seemed
like coming home.

11
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:06,400
Everyone is so friendly.

12
00:01:06,434 --> 00:01:07,401
Everyone is welcome.

13
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:10,538
The Villa Barbianello
basks all day

14
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:11,639
in the lakeside sun,

15
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:16,144
which is hotter than usual
for late April.


18
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:41,802
Oh! Oh, it's always
you running away!

19
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:43,271
Buon giorno,
Miss Bentley.

20
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:45,573
To Bellinzona to fetch
the new nanny.

21
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,775
Oh, of course.
I totally forgot.

22
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:49,643
I hope she's strictly.

23
00:01:49,677 --> 00:01:51,612
When will you
be back?

24
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:52,380
Tomorrow afternoon,

25
00:01:52,413 --> 00:01:55,416
in time for a nice cup
of tea. Hmm?

26
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,251
                                                                                     I'll miss you at dinner.

27
00:01:57,285 --> 00:01:59,520
Arrivederci,
Miss Bentley.

28
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:01,455
Likewise, Miss Bentley.

29
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:02,890
Toodle-oo!
Arrivederci!

30
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:04,358
Arrivederci!

31
00:02:04,392 --> 00:02:05,493
Bye!


32
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:08,196
                                                                                     Father and I
came here every Summer

33
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,463
for 16 years.

34
00:02:09,497 --> 00:02:13,667
In a way I'm surprised
that the place is still here.

35
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:16,404
It should have died with him.


37
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:21,409
So far, I'm the only
English guest.

38
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:22,443
Quite alone.

39
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,212
Until today that is.

40
00:02:24,245 --> 00:02:26,680
We have a new arrival.

41
00:02:26,714 --> 00:02:27,915
I like his ears.

42
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,283
Did you
visit Oxford?

43
00:02:29,317 --> 00:02:31,819
Oh, yes, it was
just perfect.

44
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:33,020
Oh, no, no.

45
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:36,224
                                                                                            Yes, I think my most
favorite English city

46
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:38,226
of all is Oxford.

47
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:40,528
It's lovely the way the
river flows through it.

48
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:43,431
                                                                                           Oh, and that beautiful bridge.

49
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:44,598
And the swans.

50
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:46,834
                                                                                           I want that bridge for my garden.

51
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:49,937
                                                                                            It might prove
a little awkward at customs.

52
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:50,904

53
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:52,773
                                                                                            She's gonna be wanting

54
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:54,275
a thatched roof next!

55
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:55,209
So, tell me, Major,

56
00:02:55,243 --> 00:02:56,977
just exactly where
are you from?

57
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,579
I mean, what city
in England ?

58
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:01,915


59
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:13,327
Oh!

60
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:15,563
No, the man in the hat.

61
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:16,664
He's inglese.

62
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:19,567
Um, Major Wilshaw.

63
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,369
Grazie.

64
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:22,770
Buon giorno, Enrico.

65
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:24,372
Buon giorno,
Signorina Bentley.

66
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:26,507
A small cup of
coffee, please.


68
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:29,943
Thank you.

69
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:41,855
Major Wilshaw...

70
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,758
Wilshire. Yes.

71
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:45,593
Excuse me.
I wondered

72
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:48,962
if I could just look
at your newspaper.

73
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:49,730
I won't keep it.

74
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,499
I just wanted to
look something up.

75
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:52,700
Do, by all means.

76
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,302
It's, uh, last week's,
I'm afraid.

77
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:59,006
Oh, I'm used to being
behind the times.

78
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:04,345
Is it doing well?
Hmm?

79
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:05,879
The financial index.

80
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,615
Oh!

81
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,320
Better than of late.
Thank you.

82
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:13,787
No, no.
Will you join me?

83
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:15,889
Oh, I don't wish
to intrude.

84
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,925
No, no, you're not.

85
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,829
Nice to hear spoken
English again.

86
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:25,065
Well, you were surrounded
by English last night.

87
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,700
Yes, American

88
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:28,502
Not quite the same thing.

89
00:04:28,536 --> 00:04:32,039
Why, there used to be
so many of US here.

90
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:35,343
You've obviously
been before.

91
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:37,044
Yes, many times.

92
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:39,480
So where are they?


94
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:42,516
I don't know.

95
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,786
Talk of war,
I suppose.

96
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:48,689
You staying long?

97
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:50,758
Well, I don't know.

98
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,626
Family at home?

99
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,397
Heavens.
A lot of questions.

100
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:58,699
Hmm.

101
00:05:00,368 --> 00:05:04,338
Sorry. It was
very rude of me.

102
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:07,441
Oh, I must be off.
I'll be late.

103
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:09,977
Thank you so much
for the coffee.

104
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,512
No, no, not at all.

105
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:14,482
Um...drink this evening?

106
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:15,716
So 7:30?

107
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:18,452
Oh! Thank you.

108
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:29,129
Tell me, Major,
why do you...

109
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,465
Carry 2 tennis rackets?

110
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:36,470
Oooh, you never know
who might like a game.

111
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:39,139
                                                                                     I'm going to
stay here another month.

112
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,943
I've always had a thing
about men's ears,

113
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:47,014
and I'm quite transfixed
by Major Wilshaw's.

114
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:50,618
He has the ears of a gentle
and kind man.

115
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:53,120
I wonder if I'm right.


118
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:56,890
Hello.

119
00:05:56,924 --> 00:05:57,925
                                                                                  
Miss Bentley!

120
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:01,629
Oh, ha ha!
Welcome back!

121
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:02,596
Thank you.

122
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,966
Miss Bentley, I'm pleased
to introduce to you

123
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:09,937
enchanting new addition
to our happy family--

124
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,572
Miss Beaumont.

125
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:14,508
Uh,
excuse me, ladies.

126
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:15,409
I must go

127
00:06:15,443 --> 00:06:18,646
to change myself
before dinner.

128
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:22,450
Well, you-you're not
quite what I imagined.

129
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:23,684
Old and starchy?

130
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:27,421
Well, um, you are
rather unsevere.

131
00:06:27,455 --> 00:06:30,491
You haven't seen me
in action.

132
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:32,693
Oh. Well.

133
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,095
I'm sorry
to be a bother,

134
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:38,098
but you don't have
anything to eat, do you?

135
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:39,066
I'm famished.

136
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:42,703
Well, um, there's a piece
of Kendal mint cake,

137
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:43,704
if you'd like.

138
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,206
It's all I've got left,
I'm afraid.

139
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,307
Whatever.

140
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,545
You better come in.
Sorry about the mess.

141
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:52,813
Here. Here we are.


143
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,186
Did you have far to come?

144
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:02,456
No. Switzerland.

145
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,858
Finishing school.

146
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:07,461
Finished me nearly.

147
00:07:07,495 --> 00:07:09,630
After a couple of terms,
I just left.

148
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:11,599
And you didn't want
to go back to America?

149
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:14,134
                                                                                            My mother's
not ready for me yet.

150
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,504
I've been exiled to Europe
for the school year,

151
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:17,671
and that's that.

152
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:18,772
But a nanny?

153
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:23,210
It wasn't my idea,
I assure you.

154
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,855
Are you
a photographer?

155
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:38,125
Well, that's a matter
of opinion.

156
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:40,060
Cigarette?

157
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:42,896
No thanks.

158
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:48,201
So what's
it like here?

159
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:49,136
Well, I love it,

160
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:52,573
but then I'm not
as young as you.

161
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:58,512
Well...I'm sure I'll find
something to occupy myself.

162
00:07:58,546 --> 00:07:59,312
I do hope so.

163
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:02,783
I would so hate
for you to be bored.

164
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:07,621
Dinner soon.
I'd better go.

165
00:08:09,557 --> 00:08:12,960
Thanks for
keeping me going.

166
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:21,602


167
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:28,876
Ah, there you are!

168
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:29,943
I am.

169
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:31,144
I wondered where
you got to.

170
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,680
We were going to
meet for a drink.

171
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:35,549
Well, I assume it
was an invitation,

172
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,550
not a summons.

173
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:37,317


174
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,853
Oh, dear.
Now I've made you cross.

175
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:40,588
Hmm?

176
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:42,322
Your ears
have gone bright red.

177
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,423
What?

178
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:46,293
I've made a study of ears.
Yours are definitely cross.

179
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:48,696
What utter nonsense,
Miss Bentley.

180
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:52,566
Hmm. I'm flattered,
Major .

181
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,534
You know my name.

182
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:56,570
Ah, Miss Bentley.

183
00:08:56,604 --> 00:08:57,805
Buona sera!

184
00:08:57,838 --> 00:08:59,807
Buona sera.

185
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,942
Buona sera.
Buona sera.


188
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:11,752
No, no, we bring them too,
and I can't cope.

189
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:13,286
Oh, they're cherubs--

190
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,923
heavenly creatures!

191
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:18,659
Aren't I right,
Signora Bonizzoni ?

192
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,093
Why not?


194
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:23,463
                                                                                     Bon appetit!

195
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,633
                                        
Grazie.


197
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:35,876
Julia...


199
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,118
Buona notte!

200
00:09:49,657 --> 00:09:51,024
We've not been
introduced.

201
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:52,893
My name is Wilshaw.
Major Wilshaw.

202
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:53,794
How do you do?

203
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:54,795
Beaumont, Miss.

204
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:56,329
                                                                                                 French name.
Gallic blood?

205
00:09:56,363 --> 00:09:59,232
Yes, but on
my mother's side.

206
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,768
Staying long?

207
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:01,769
A few days.

208
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:04,171
                                                                                                 I'm not
staying long myself.

209
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:06,039
Back to your wife?

210
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:09,009
Uh...alas, no.

211
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:11,645
Come along, angels!

212
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:16,984
Angels? Do these angels
believe in magic, I wonder?

213
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:21,889
Whoo!

214
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:23,691
Ha ha!

215
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:24,692
Delightful.

216
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:27,761
Now, we've had a long day
and we must go to bed.

217
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:29,096
Buona notte, Major 

218
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,363
Buona notte!

219
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:32,866
Buona notte.

220
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:39,707
Miss Bentley,

221
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,309
would you be so kind
to take these 2 ladies

222
00:10:4L,342 --> 00:10:44,812
to the Lido, so they
will not be lost?

223
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:46,814

With pleasure.

224
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,381
Ciao.


227
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:07,467
Morning, Major 
Good game?

228
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,971
Good morning!
Not much competition.

229
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,372

My word.

230
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,141
Pray, that good?

231
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,744
Well, shortage of partners,
in fact.

232
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:18,311
Do you play?

233
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:21,314
Oh, not
for years. Heh.

234
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:22,916
I'll give you a game,
if you like.

235
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,985
Oh,
I don't know.

236
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,320
Go on,
Miss Bentley.

237
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,521
Don't be shy.

238
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:31,825
I'll book a court then.
This afternoon suit you?


240
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:46,139
Root for Miss Bentley!

241
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:48,942
                                                                                           We're rooting
for you, dear.

242
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:49,877


243
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,880
Ok.

244
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,851
Did you ask them?

245
00:11:57,885 --> 00:11:58,618
Just being friendly.

246
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:01,088
I wish it weren't
quite so public.

247
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:03,757
I shall be
very gentle.

248
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:04,858
Rough or smooth?

249
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:06,827
Uh, smooth.

250
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,830
Rough.
Me to serve.

251
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:25,813
Right, let's play!


255
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,960
Prego, Signora .

256
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:42,863
Ohh, grazie.

257
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:44,497
Sorry.

258
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,434
Heh.

259
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:50,804
Sorry!

260
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,986
Ohh! Ha ha ha!

261
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:06,887
Bravo!

262
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,255
30-love!

263
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,458
But I didn't know
we were scoring yet!

264
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:14,261
Of course!

265
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:24,537
Ohh ho ho ho ho!

266
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:28,341
Bravo! Ha ha!


268
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:39,552
Yes!

269
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,524
Sorry.

270
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,996
40-15!

271
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:57,938
Out!

272
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:05,012

273
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:09,049
40-30.

274
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,098
Yes! 

275
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:29,036
Deuce. Sorry!



277
00:14:38,145 --> 00:14:39,246
Sorry!

278
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,115
Will you please
stop saying that?

279
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,227
Aah!

280
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:56,129
               

281
00:14:56,163 --> 00:14:57,330
Nice.

282
00:14:57,364 --> 00:14:58,531
Miss Bentley!

283
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:02,469


284
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:04,237
Whoo hoo hoo!


288
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:25,625
Aaah!


290
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:33,000
Are you all right?

291
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,034
We'll get it later.

292
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:36,203
Oh, no, we won't.


295
00:15:45,012 --> 00:15:47,380
Ball, please!


297
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:56,990
Listen, I never said
I couldn't play.

298
00:15:57,024 --> 00:15:59,526
I just said I hadn't
played for years!

299
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:00,693
It doesn't matter!

300
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:02,462
It seems to matter
very much!

301
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:05,598
And you attracted
those wretched Italians!

302
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:08,135
I didn't know they were
going to be there

303
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:11,404
any more than I knew
about your lot!

304
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,241
Well, you
encouraged them!

305
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:16,076
Oh, piffle!

306
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:18,378
I tell her
time and again

307
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:22,082
not to touch the water.
Drink it boiled,

308
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:23,250
and time and again,

309
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:25,252
I catch her putting
her glass to her lips,

310
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:27,654
ready to die
for her big-headedness.

311
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:31,391
Their sanitation
is not like ours.

312
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:32,525
I mean, it isn't.

313
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,161
Good evening.
Oh, heh heh.

314
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:35,662
And how was your day?

315
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,397
Just perfect,
Major.

316
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,999
                                                                                                 Oh, I'm so glad.

317
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:42,535
               

318
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:46,106
                                                                                                 Oh, how nice
to see you.


320
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:49,309
                                                                                            Major 


322
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,788


323
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:22,209
Bellagio.
Day return, please.

324
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:24,177

1 and 1/2, please.


326
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:27,314
Thank you.


327
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:38,291
Ah.

328
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:44,231
Hmm.


331
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:11,124
Buon giorno, Signora  

332
00:18:11,158 --> 00:18:13,193
We'll pretend
I haven't seen you,

333
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:14,161
if you like.

334
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:16,163
Bit late for that,
isn't it?

335
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:17,797
Sorry. Heh.

336
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,699
Pax?

337
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:21,301
Pax.


339
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:25,805
Ohh, thank goodness.

340
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,176
Beautiful.

341
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:31,444
My father
adored this lake.

342
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:33,780
Oh, so that's
who you came here with.

343
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:36,449
He painted every view
imaginable. Heh.

344
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:40,420
I do a spot of painting
myself when I've the time.

345
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:43,356
He was a good artist.
Nothing very bohemian.

346
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:47,560
Society portraits,
and houses, horses,

347
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,896
you know,
that sort of thing.

348
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:53,833
He--he was
painting a duchess

349
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,336
the evening he died.
The next morning,

350
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:58,471
she demanded
her money back.

351
00:18:58,505 --> 00:18:59,639


352
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:01,308
But he wouldn't
have found

353
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:03,210
anything odd
in that.

354
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:06,446
Ha. But you did.

355
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,381
Yeah.

356
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:15,222
Was that long ago?

357
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:18,191
January. He'd been
ill for years.

358
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:20,627
Oh, I'm sorry.

359
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,428
Your mother?

360
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:23,863
Oh, she ran off
when I was a child.

361
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:27,534
I couldn't even
describe her. Heh.

362
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:30,403
On your own, then?

363
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:33,606
You're inquisitive,
Major.

364
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,376
Well, does it matter?

365
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:40,313
My father taught me
it's better to observe

366
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:41,681
than to be observed.

367
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:46,353
In your case, that's
a wasteful philosophy.

368
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:49,222
Never trust
flattery.

369
00:19:49,256 --> 00:19:50,022
You should try.

370
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:53,260
You're not a bad sort,
Miss Bentley.

371
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:57,264
Well, that's a compliment
I can understand.

372
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:15,715
We ought to keep
an eye on the tide.

373
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:17,250
It's three o’clock

374
00:20:17,284 --> 00:20:19,519
The steamer leaves
at ten to four

375
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,621
Well, we don't want
to get too late.

376
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,990
It's the last one.

377
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,560
Hands and the ears.

378
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:29,262
The bane
of father's life.

379
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:32,399
He could never
get them right.

380
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:35,402
You can tell so much
about someone

381
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:36,603
by their ears.

382
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:39,872
Yes. Mine,
for instance--

383
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:40,640
red.

384
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:43,276
Ha ha ha!
Only when you're angry.

385
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:46,446
But they're really
very nice.

386
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:47,514
Ahh.

387
00:20:47,547 --> 00:20:50,383
I think we ought
to be getting back.

388
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:53,353
Oh, it's
so peaceful here.

389
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:54,754
Mm.


391
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:01,461
What'd you say
the time was?

392
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:04,464
It's three o’clock exactly!

393
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:06,566
No, it's five to four!

394
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,636
But my watch
keeps perfect time.

395
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:11,338
Sit down!

396
00:21:11,371 --> 00:21:13,306
Oh, God!

397
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,542
I forgot to wind it.

                                                                                                 Miss Bentley,
will you sit down?!

400
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:24,984
Don't go so fast!

401
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:26,786
You try
to keep up!

402
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:28,488
I can't! It's miles!

403
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:30,423
You have
another suggestion?



405
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:34,427
Signora,
where you go?

406
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:35,395
Sorry?

407
00:21:35,428 --> 00:21:36,829
Are you lost?

408
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,332
We missed the boat.
My fault.

409
00:21:39,366 --> 00:21:42,369
It's a long way to walk.
I give you a ride.

410
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:43,470
Well, I--
I don't know.

411
00:21:43,503 --> 00:21:46,339
Your husband
can come with me!

412
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:47,974
I'm not
her husband!

413
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:48,841
Good God!

414
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:49,976
                                                                                            Major 
you go with me!

415
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:53,346
                                                                                                 No, I do not.
If you were sensible,

416
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,114
Miss Bentley,
you'd stay here with me!

417
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:58,918
I'm not halfway
sensible, Major!

418
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:00,420
                                                                                            Ha ha ha!

419
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:02,455
Bye-bye!
Bye!

420
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:03,656
Ciao!

421
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:04,824

Arrivederci!

422
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:06,959

Bye, now!

423
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,461
Driver!

424
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:10,530
Stop! Stop! Stop!

425
00:22:10,563 --> 00:22:12,532


426
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:23,443
That man--

427
00:22:23,476 --> 00:22:25,745
he is
your boyfriend?

428
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:28,415
Absolutely not!

429
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:30,049
He's not my type!

430
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,518
Uh-huh.

431
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:34,421
And I'm certainly
not his.

432
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:37,390
And who is your type?


434
00:23:05,852 --> 00:23:07,820
                                                                                            Move over!

435
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:10,423
Move over, damn you!

436
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:13,926
Ah!


438
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:22,535
Oh, push over!





443
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:39,085
Hey, Enrico !

444
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:51,598
Whoo! Ohh!

445
00:23:51,631 --> 00:23:52,999
Ay-ay-ay-ah!

446
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:55,134
Whoo-hoo! Ha ha!

447
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:58,571
Oh, wasn't that
breathtaking, Major ?

448
00:23:58,605 --> 00:24:01,874
I haven't had
such excitement for years!

449
00:24:01,908 --> 00:24:04,210
I knew you were an
odd one, Miss Bentley,

450
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:06,479
but this really
takes the cap.

451
00:24:06,513 --> 00:24:08,247
Biscuit!
What?



453
00:24:12,852 --> 00:24:14,253
Miss Bentley?

454
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:17,490
Miss Bentley--


455
00:24:17,524 --> 00:24:18,491
Miss Bentley.

456
00:24:18,525 --> 00:24:20,960
Maria.

457
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:22,795
What time is it?


459
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:26,666
11:00?

460
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:29,268
Ohh, crikey!


462
00:24:39,746 --> 00:24:43,015
Where did these
come from?

463
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:49,556
"Pax again."

464
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:53,960
Pronti!

465
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:57,063
Lovely. Enrico 
UN belle sorriso.


467
00:24:58,297 --> 00:24:59,632
Heh.

468
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:00,667
Great.

469
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,569
Oh! Grazie.

470
00:25:02,602 --> 00:25:05,572
Grazie.


472
00:25:13,713 --> 00:25:16,248
                                                                                            Don't you want
to go upstairs?

473
00:25:16,282 --> 00:25:17,650
Uh-uh.

474
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:21,888
Order me a gin.
I'll be right down.

475
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,025
Signora .

476
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:28,094
A gin and vermouth,

477
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:30,997
and a jug
of boiled water

478
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,199
with lots of ice.

479
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:35,902
I think it's only fair
to warn you,

480
00:25:35,935 --> 00:25:37,870
the ice isn't made
with boiled water.

481
00:25:37,904 --> 00:25:40,573
Miss Bentley,

482
00:25:40,607 --> 00:25:42,909
I don't give a heck.

483
00:25:42,942 --> 00:25:46,078
Oh! Hello.
How was the expedition?

484
00:25:46,112 --> 00:25:48,948
We went down
to the village market

485
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:49,882
for this,
that, and the other.

486
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:52,619
We would've asked you
to join us, of course,

487
00:25:52,652 --> 00:25:54,253
but you weren't
at breakfast.

488
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:57,089
I overslept,
I'm afraid.

489
00:25:57,123 --> 00:25:59,759
You were
ever so thoughtful

490
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:00,827
to send
those flowers.

491
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,361
I think I should've
sent some to you.

492
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,665
I lose my sense of humor
sometimes.

493
00:26:05,698 --> 00:26:07,299
Ha.

494
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:09,902
Well, I shall miss this place.

495
00:26:09,936 --> 00:26:11,938
Well, not for
a while yet, I hope.

496
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:13,806
Yes, yes,
I'm off in the morning.

497
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,942
But you--you've
only just arrived.

498
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:19,345
Besides, you fit in
so well here. Heh.

499
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:21,380
Well, it's very kind
of you to say so,

500
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,616
but it's all arranged,
I'm afraid.

501
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:24,984
Then unarrange it.

502
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:25,818


503
00:26:25,852 --> 00:26:28,688
Life's not that simple,
Miss Bentley.

504
00:26:28,721 --> 00:26:31,057
Would that it were.

505
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,960
I tell you what, though.
As a peace offering,

506
00:26:33,993 --> 00:26:35,928
would you do me
the great honor

507
00:26:35,962 --> 00:26:36,829
of dining with me
tonight?

508
00:26:36,863 --> 00:26:41,267
Oh, thank you. Yes,
that would be lovely.

509
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,802
Good.

510
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:44,103
7:30?

511
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:46,138
Uh...heh.

512
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:51,644
I don't often make
the same mistake twice.

               





516
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,063
Miss Bentley,
come and join us.

517
00:27:44,897 --> 00:27:46,866
                                                                                           Buona sera,
Miss Bentley.

518
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:50,069
Ciao.

519
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,148
Come on.

520
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:04,083
Ahhhhhh.

521
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:06,252
You'll like it.

522
00:28:16,896 --> 00:28:18,865
Penny?

523
00:28:20,332 --> 00:28:21,067
Shilling, then.

524
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:25,471
Heh. So, you will
leave tomorrow?

525
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:26,973
I'm afraid so.

526
00:28:27,006 --> 00:28:28,474
Work beckons,
and all that.

527
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:30,076
But I'm not sure
that the business

528
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:32,812
doesn't run itself better
when I'm away.

529
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:34,881
Perhaps you like to feel
you're needed.

530
00:28:34,914 --> 00:28:38,050
Well, it's only recently
that I've allowed myself

531
00:28:38,084 --> 00:28:40,820
to leave it at all.

532
00:28:44,123 --> 00:28:46,759
Can't you stay
a little longer?

533
00:28:46,793 --> 00:28:48,360
No, I've made my plans,

534
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:50,863
and I must
stick to them.

535
00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:54,767
Don't, um,
don't you have any reason

536
00:28:54,801 --> 00:28:57,469
for going back
to England ?

537
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,776
None whatsoever.

538
00:29:05,912 --> 00:29:07,780
Tell me,

539
00:29:07,814 --> 00:29:09,916
were you never married?

540
00:29:09,949 --> 00:29:13,786
No. Uh, yes,
I would've been,

541
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,422
but he already had
a wife.

542
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:19,191
Fourteen years
that went on.

543
00:29:19,225 --> 00:29:22,228
Became such a habit
that when she died,

544
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:26,933
well, I suppose
he couldn't face--

545
00:29:28,167 --> 00:29:30,436
anyway, I never
saw him again.

546
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:32,504
Were you
ever married?

547
00:29:32,538 --> 00:29:35,174
Before the war, I was
engaged to be married,

548
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:37,343
but by the time
it was all over,

549
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:38,510
that had changed.

550
00:29:38,544 --> 00:29:42,348
One lost a lot of friends
in the war,

551
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:45,217
and, uh,
I found it hard

552
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:48,821
to make attachments
after that.

553
00:29:48,855 --> 00:29:53,092
It seems we've both
been unlucky in love.

554
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,161
Mm.

555
00:29:55,194 --> 00:29:57,830
Perhaps we should stick
to tennis.

556
00:29:57,864 --> 00:29:59,866


557
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,844
                                                                                Major ,
your carriage awaits!

558
00:30:11,878 --> 00:30:14,881
Good gracious me.
What on earth's going on?

559
00:30:14,914 --> 00:30:17,349
Oh, I couldn't let
my friend go in a taxi.

560
00:30:17,383 --> 00:30:18,918
No, no, no, no, no.
Ha ha.

561
00:30:18,951 --> 00:30:20,186
Today it will be
my pleasure

562
00:30:20,219 --> 00:30:21,921
to take you
to the station myself.

563
00:30:21,954 --> 00:30:23,189
Why, that's terribly
kind of you.

564
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:24,924
Quite sure?
It's a long way.

565
00:30:24,957 --> 00:30:26,558
You will be doing me
a favor.

566
00:30:26,592 --> 00:30:28,995
My family this morning
are going to the Lido,

567
00:30:29,028 --> 00:30:31,030
which, you know,
I do not enjoy.

568
00:30:31,063 --> 00:30:34,133
Uh, Miss Bentley,
do you like to come with us

569
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,134
to say "cheerio"?

570
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:38,938
Oh, no, thank you. I'm not
very good at all that.

571
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:39,872
Never mind.

572
00:30:39,906 --> 00:30:43,242
Uh, Major, we depart,
or we miss your train.

573
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:45,311
                                                                                                 Indeed.

574
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:53,152
So, good-bye, then.

575
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,523
I suppose it is.

576
00:31:00,492 --> 00:31:03,095

578
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:08,300
Scusi!


580
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:13,906
Ciao.

582
00:31:15,007 --> 00:31:18,010
Grazie.
Prego.

583
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,049
Major !

584
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,653
Dear Major,
I'm so sorry you're going

585
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:31,257
before we've had a chance
to get to know each other.

586
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:32,558
Such a waste.

587
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:34,160
Here.

588
00:31:36,996 --> 00:31:39,098
Souvenir.

589
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:48,040
Better not miss your train!

590
00:31:48,074 --> 00:31:50,042
No.


592
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:14,100
Arrivederci!


 
594
00:32:18,037 --> 00:32:20,039
That was a cruel
thing to do.

595
00:32:20,072 --> 00:32:22,608
What do you mean? He went
away happy, didn't he?

596
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:25,277
He took you
seriously.

598
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,361
Finish?

599
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:43,762
Sì, finito.

600
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,465
                           

601
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:47,233
No.

602
00:32:47,266 --> 00:32:48,734
Meringata?

603
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:51,237
Crema di amaretti?

604
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,271
No, thanks.

605
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,073
No hungry?
Mm-mm.

606
00:32:54,106 --> 00:32:57,009
No good.
Too thin.


609
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:04,583
Hello.


612
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:29,141
Major  !

613
00:33:29,175 --> 00:33:32,311
Major !

614
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:35,381
Major, are you there?!

615
00:33:35,414 --> 00:33:37,649
Oh.

616
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:40,186
I'm--I'm sorry. Um...

617
00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:44,790
Wrong room.
Scusate. Sbagliate.

618
00:33:44,823 --> 00:33:47,393
                           

619
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:58,770
I thought you'd mistaken
the time of your train.

620
00:33:58,804 --> 00:34:00,339
No, no, I didn't.

621
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:04,110
Oh, you
unarranged things, then?


623
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:11,250
Are you all right?

624
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:12,684
Yes, perfectly.

625
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:14,786
Oh, good. Heh.

626
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,589
So, are you going
to tell me?

627
00:34:17,623 --> 00:34:18,357
Tell you what?

628
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,726
Well, something
changed your mind.

629
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:23,362
Ohh, yes.

630
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,531
Well, you know,

631
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:28,534
an unexpected impulse,
I suppose.

632
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,869
You probably
don't have such things.

633
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,439
Oh, come on, Major.

634
00:34:33,472 --> 00:34:36,408
               
You and I have wild,

635
00:34:36,442 --> 00:34:38,410
unconquerable desires.

636
00:34:38,444 --> 00:34:39,411
               

637
00:34:39,445 --> 00:34:43,615
Yes, but one that stops you
dead in your tracks,

638
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:45,551
like a voice.

639
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:49,221


640
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:56,762
Do--
I'm not sure i--

641
00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:57,863
do you feel that--

642
00:34:57,896 --> 00:34:59,631
what? Sorry.
Do I feel what?

643
00:34:59,665 --> 00:35:02,534
That life has
a predetermined pattern?

644
00:35:02,568 --> 00:35:04,403
Lordy, I hope not.

645
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,572
So how long
will you stay

646
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:09,675
now that you're back?

647
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:10,809
Won't you be missed?

648
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:12,244
No, not really.

649
00:35:12,278 --> 00:35:13,812
I have my own business,
you see.

650
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:18,650
Industrial engineering,
light metal, and so forth.

651
00:35:18,684 --> 00:35:21,620
No, it more or less
runs itself nowadays.

652
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:23,455
I assumed
you were in the army.

653
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:25,724
Yes. Sappers--
long time ago.

654
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:29,628
So perhaps you should
stay a whole month.

655
00:35:30,229 --> 00:35:35,234
At least until another
impulse strikes you.

656
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:36,702


657
00:35:36,735 --> 00:35:39,671
Well...

658
00:35:39,705 --> 00:35:42,841
Yeah, we'll see.


661
00:35:59,758 --> 00:36:02,394
Hey, presto!

662
00:36:02,428 --> 00:36:03,128
Ah!

663
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,631
Surprised
to see me?

664
00:36:08,234 --> 00:36:09,868
That trick's
already in danger

665
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:11,837
of becoming stale.

666
00:36:12,404 --> 00:36:14,506
Know what you said when
I left this morning--

667
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,942
that we should get to know
each other properly?

668
00:36:16,975 --> 00:36:18,244
Did I say that?

669
00:36:18,277 --> 00:36:22,214
You did.
I remember every word.

670
00:36:22,748 --> 00:36:25,717
Miss Beaumont,
how long are you staying for?

671
00:36:25,751 --> 00:36:27,653
Oh, I really can't say.

672
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,888
Will you join me
for a drink this evening?

673
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:32,424
W-Well...

674
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:34,260
                                                                                     Major!

675
00:36:34,293 --> 00:36:35,727
Miss Bentley.

676
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:37,663


677
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:40,832
Hello.
Ah! Hello.

678
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:42,000
Hello.


680
00:36:43,569 --> 00:36:44,836
Want anything
from town?

681
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,672
I'm just going
to pick up

682
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:47,739
a couple of things.

683
00:36:47,773 --> 00:36:49,375
Must have something
new to wear

684
00:36:49,408 --> 00:36:51,843
if I'm going to stay
another month.

685
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:54,446
No, no.
No, thanks.

686
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,681
Want me to take
the children?

687
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,616
Oh, would it be
too much trouble?

688
00:36:57,649 --> 00:36:59,785
Oh,
absolutely not.

689
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:01,787
Uh, did--do--

690
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,722
Miss Beaumont!

691
00:37:45,531 --> 00:37:46,565
They left an hour ago.

692
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:48,634
They've gone
for the day.

693
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:49,435
Hmm?

694
00:37:49,468 --> 00:37:52,604
The Bonizzonis.

695
00:37:53,539 --> 00:37:55,941
With Miss Beaumont,
of course.

696
00:37:55,974 --> 00:37:56,875
I know. She told me.

697
00:37:56,908 --> 00:38:00,479
You needn't have
got up so early.

698
00:38:01,547 --> 00:38:07,319
Oh, well.
Can't sit around all day.


700
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:35,614
Major.

701
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,783
Buon giorno, Signora .

702
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:38,584
Just to let you know

703
00:38:38,617 --> 00:38:40,786
that I shan't be in
for lunch today.

704
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,654
Are you going
somewhere nice?

705
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:45,524
Yes, I thought I'd take
the steamer for Menaggio.

706
00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:46,825
Ah. Well, if you hurry,

707
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:49,795
you will catch
Miss Bentley.

708
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:51,730
Ah.

709
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:55,734
Is there a bus
for Trumetsa?

710
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:57,869
A bus?

711
00:38:57,903 --> 00:38:59,838
Of course.

712
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:06,978

Hey, stop! Stop!

713
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:10,816
Oh, no!

714
00:39:24,896 --> 00:39:29,435
You--oh!

715
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:39,911


716
00:39:39,945 --> 00:39:43,549
Maggiore, I have
a message for you.

717
00:39:43,582 --> 00:39:46,017
Shh, shh.
Grazie.

718
00:39:47,553 --> 00:39:49,521
You waiting for someone?

719
00:39:49,555 --> 00:39:51,490
Uh, yes,
Miss Beaumont.

720
00:39:51,523 --> 00:39:54,826
She was coming down
for a swim at eleven o’clock.

721
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,061
What time is it now?

722
00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:58,597
Oh, it's quarter past.

723
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,699
She hates getting up
on her day off.

724
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:02,601
Some people do, you know.

725
00:40:02,634 --> 00:40:04,703
Yeah.

726
00:40:07,172 --> 00:40:09,675
I don't suppose--

727
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,579


728
00:40:13,612 --> 00:40:14,379
No.

729
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,982
You're asking me
to come for a swim?

730
00:40:17,983 --> 00:40:19,718
Uh, yes.

731
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,687
Yes, I'm so sorry.

732
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,689
Uh, yes,
of course I am.

733
00:40:23,722 --> 00:40:24,990
Ah.

734
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:26,958
Thank you.

735
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:34,065
Should we go?

736
00:40:42,073 --> 00:40:44,676
There you are.
Where have you been?

737
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:47,012
Well, I've been
waiting since eleven o’clock

738
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:49,147
I--i thought you'd
changed your mind.

739
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:52,518
I've been here,
by the wretched boat,

740
00:40:52,551 --> 00:40:54,052
where you said.

741
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:57,188
Oh, good lord, I--

742
00:40:57,222 --> 00:40:59,024
I'm so sorry.

743
00:40:59,057 --> 00:41:03,762
Well...if we're going.

744
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:29,154
I'm going to
grab some huts.

745
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:34,760
Be nice to him.

746
00:41:34,793 --> 00:41:35,827
Be serious.

747
00:41:35,861 --> 00:41:37,729
I think he may be,
that's all.

748
00:41:37,763 --> 00:41:38,997
That's his funeral,
then.

749
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:42,568
Well, now you mention it,
he is getting on a bit.

750
00:41:42,601 --> 00:41:45,604
I should introduce
him to my mother.

751
00:41:45,637 --> 00:41:46,705
Sad, really.

752
00:41:46,738 --> 00:41:52,143
A man that rich
going lonely to his grave.

753
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:54,212
Only two of them left,
I'm afraid.

754
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:56,648
Do you mind sharing?

755
00:41:58,283 --> 00:42:00,719
Terribly sorry.

756
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:16,568
Liven things up a bit
in the evenings--

757
00:42:16,602 --> 00:42:18,604
I thought I might
do a conjuring show.

758
00:42:18,637 --> 00:42:20,772
Children are very keen
on the idea.

759
00:42:20,806 --> 00:42:22,307
Might be rather fun,
what.

760
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,009
              
Hmm. Good idea.

761
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:27,178
You could make
one of us disappear.

762
00:42:36,021 --> 00:42:37,122
Coming in?

763
00:42:37,155 --> 00:42:39,825
It's a bit chilly.

764
00:42:46,798 --> 00:42:49,234


765
00:42:53,739 --> 00:42:57,108
I didn't know
you swam so well.

766
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:16,061
It's me, Vittorio,
you remember?

767
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:18,196
Oh, hello again.

768
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:23,134
Sit down.

769
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:38,116
Haven't seen you
at the Lido before.

770
00:43:38,149 --> 00:43:39,751
How did you get
so brown?

771
00:43:39,785 --> 00:43:41,352
You always come
in the mornings.

772
00:43:41,386 --> 00:43:43,722
I usually come
in the afternoons

773
00:43:43,755 --> 00:43:45,757
when you're napping.

774
00:43:47,926 --> 00:43:50,829


775
00:44:17,222 --> 00:44:19,190
Would you like to have
a drink with me?

776
00:44:19,224 --> 00:44:22,961
I don't think my friend
would like it.

777
00:44:24,029 --> 00:44:26,031
He can be
very jealous.

778
00:44:26,064 --> 00:44:28,066
Well, it's good
to be jealous.

779
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:30,902
Well, I'm not sure.

780
00:44:31,903 --> 00:44:35,306
You're much too close.

781
00:44:39,978 --> 00:44:42,013
You like
the gardens, huh?

782
00:44:42,047 --> 00:44:43,281
Yes.

783
00:44:44,282 --> 00:44:46,752
Vittorio...Vittorio.

784
00:44:46,785 --> 00:44:49,020
Maggiore and--

785
00:44:49,054 --> 00:44:51,823



787
00:45:00,165 --> 00:45:02,734
What's happening?


790
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:02,260
Excuse me.

791
00:46:03,228 --> 00:46:04,863
Please let me through.

792
00:46:04,896 --> 00:46:06,898
Excuse me.

793
00:46:11,202 --> 00:46:12,871
Signora fascista,

794
00:46:12,904 --> 00:46:14,272
photograph, please.

795
00:46:14,305 --> 00:46:16,307
Smile, please.


799
00:46:30,155 --> 00:46:30,889
Hey!


801
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:35,927
Whoo! Ha!

802
00:46:35,961 --> 00:46:38,229
Oh, you're hurt!

803
00:46:39,197 --> 00:46:41,366
I--I'll take you
to my sister's house.

804
00:46:41,399 --> 00:46:43,401
She will make it well.
She's a nurse.

805
00:46:43,434 --> 00:46:45,303
Oh, no,
it's nothing.

806
00:46:45,336 --> 00:46:46,237
It's not safe!

807
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:48,373
Quickly, Signorina,
we must go from here!

808
00:46:48,406 --> 00:46:50,308
Quickly!

809
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:53,478
I'm perfectly all right.
You can let go now.

810
00:46:53,511 --> 00:46:54,212
My sister is a doctor.

811
00:46:54,245 --> 00:46:56,147
I really have to be
going back.

812
00:46:56,181 --> 00:46:57,916
Why are you
always in a hurry?

813
00:46:57,949 --> 00:46:58,483
I'm not!

814
00:46:58,516 --> 00:47:00,952
Then do as you're told!

815
00:47:05,456 --> 00:47:08,193
Sorella!

816
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,265
Prego.

817
00:47:20,038 --> 00:47:24,442
Uh, I don't know
where she can be.

818
00:47:24,475 --> 00:47:27,378
She has a very
masculine taste.

819
00:47:27,412 --> 00:47:30,148
Oh, really,
I might have known.

820
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:32,183
Give me that key.
For heaven's sake,

821
00:47:32,217 --> 00:47:33,051
I'm old enough
to be your mother.

822
00:47:33,084 --> 00:47:35,120
English girls and
Italian men are good.

823
00:47:35,153 --> 00:47:37,923
I am an English woman.
There's a difference.

824
00:47:37,956 --> 00:47:38,990
Oh, crikey.

825
00:47:39,024 --> 00:47:40,959
I am Italian.

826
00:47:40,992 --> 00:47:41,492
Aah!

827
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:43,594
You will not regret.

828
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:47,365
Unh!

829
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:52,070

830
00:47:52,103 --> 00:47:54,205
Signore Balsari.

831
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:58,509
You are definitely
not a gentleman!

832
00:47:58,543 --> 00:48:00,912
Ah, you're very strong.

833
00:48:00,946 --> 00:48:03,048
So are you,
but you won't hurt me.

834
00:48:03,081 --> 00:48:05,616
You better give me
that key.

835
00:48:12,357 --> 00:48:14,525
I do not
understand you.

836
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:19,998


837
00:48:21,499 --> 00:48:23,168
Please.


839
00:48:37,015 --> 00:48:41,119
So now you're going
back to your Major.

840
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:44,155
To make love to him?

841
00:48:44,189 --> 00:48:46,457
Or does he prefer
the pretty girl--

842
00:48:46,491 --> 00:48:47,692
the young one?

843
00:48:47,725 --> 00:48:48,659
This is siesta time.

844
00:48:48,693 --> 00:48:50,261
What do you think
they are doing?

845
00:48:50,295 --> 00:48:52,663
Nothing like that,
I can assure you.

846
00:48:52,697 --> 00:48:55,233


847
00:48:57,535 --> 00:48:59,971
Your Major ...

848
00:49:00,005 --> 00:49:01,239
He would be very angry

849
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:03,074
if he thought
you had been with me.

850
00:49:03,108 --> 00:49:05,076
I don't think
he'd believe it.

851
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:09,114
Yes, but I'm sure
he would be jealous.

852
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:12,250
Would you be
so interested in him

853
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:14,219
if this girl is not there?

854
00:49:14,252 --> 00:49:15,253
Yes.

855
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:16,954
Yes?

856
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:19,157
Well, no.

857
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:20,125
No.

858
00:49:20,158 --> 00:49:21,626
I don't know.

859
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:23,528
You want
I should tell him?

860
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:26,397
Oh, don't you dare.

861
00:49:26,431 --> 00:49:29,434
I try only to help.

862
00:49:29,467 --> 00:49:31,302
Scusa.

863
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:34,439
Mama!

864
00:49:37,742 --> 00:49:38,909
Vittorio,

865
00:49:38,943 --> 00:49:42,613
how would you like to have
your photograph taken?

866
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:44,015
Why?

867
00:49:44,049 --> 00:49:45,183
Never mind why.

868
00:49:45,216 --> 00:49:48,086
I like taking photographs.

869
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:59,264
All right. All right!

870
00:49:59,297 --> 00:50:01,499
Over there.

871
00:50:03,068 --> 00:50:04,435
Over there.

872
00:50:04,469 --> 00:50:05,670
There?

873
00:50:05,703 --> 00:50:07,305
There.

874
00:50:12,277 --> 00:50:14,145
This is not my room.

875
00:50:14,179 --> 00:50:16,747
This is my friend's,
guido.

876
00:50:16,781 --> 00:50:17,615


877
00:50:17,648 --> 00:50:19,184
Papa--my papa--

878
00:50:19,217 --> 00:50:21,219
he makes motor tires
in Milano.

879
00:50:21,252 --> 00:50:23,554
He has a big contract
for the army.

880
00:50:23,588 --> 00:50:25,123
So when the war comes,

881
00:50:25,156 --> 00:50:27,558
we will be many times
millionaire.

882
00:50:27,592 --> 00:50:30,361
I'm sure.

883
00:50:30,395 --> 00:50:31,696
You know Hatfield?

884
00:50:31,729 --> 00:50:34,299
A little village
near London?

885
00:50:34,332 --> 00:50:37,235
Heh. For one year
we lived there.

886
00:50:37,268 --> 00:50:39,304
I had a good time.

887
00:50:39,337 --> 00:50:40,805
Incredible.

888
00:50:40,838 --> 00:50:42,440
English girls.

889
00:50:42,473 --> 00:50:43,174
Tell me--

890
00:50:43,208 --> 00:50:49,180
why so many
are called "Doris"?

891
00:50:50,315 --> 00:50:52,283
Beautiful.

892
00:50:52,317 --> 00:50:54,519
Beautiful.

893
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:56,754
                               

894
00:50:57,722 --> 00:50:59,357


895
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:00,057
Well, I'm not,

896
00:51:00,091 --> 00:51:03,661
so don't expect me
to tell you.

897
00:51:04,262 --> 00:51:06,597
It's finished?

898
00:51:06,631 --> 00:51:08,699
Already?
Mm-hmm.

899
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:09,334
You come again?

900
00:51:09,367 --> 00:51:12,337
Don't think so.
Thank you.

901
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:14,639


902
00:51:14,672 --> 00:51:16,241
Ooh, I must be off.

903
00:51:16,274 --> 00:51:17,275
With a bit of luck,

904
00:51:17,308 --> 00:51:19,310
they'll be wondering
where I've got to.

905
00:51:19,344 --> 00:51:20,811
You want I take you there?

906
00:51:20,845 --> 00:51:22,413
Mm.

907
00:51:23,348 --> 00:51:26,617
Oh, yes. Yes.




911
00:51:34,225 --> 00:51:35,593
Yes!

912
00:51:38,296 --> 00:51:40,698
Hey!

913
00:51:42,367 --> 00:51:44,702


914
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:47,738
Oh, Miss Bentley.
Are you all right?

915
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:49,607
Yes, of course I am.

916
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:50,875
We wonder
what happen to you.

917
00:51:50,908 --> 00:51:52,877
Major said you disappeared
from the beach,

918
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:54,779
and then there was
a big parade.

919
00:51:54,812 --> 00:51:55,780
We imagine--
oh, I don't know.

920
00:51:55,813 --> 00:51:58,649
It was so unlike you.
I even phoned the police.

921
00:51:58,683 --> 00:52:00,918
Oh, you needn't have.
You're so kind.

922
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,788
Honestly, I can
look after myself.

923
00:52:03,821 --> 00:52:06,357
I'm sure you can.

924
00:52:06,391 --> 00:52:09,894
I'm happy
you're not afraid.

925
00:52:09,927 --> 00:52:11,762
But me--

926
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:14,499
me, I am afraid.

927
00:52:16,567 --> 00:52:21,138
Of so many things.
So many things.

928
00:52:22,507 --> 00:52:24,942
But whatever happens
to us all,

929
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,877
I want you to know

930
00:52:26,911 --> 00:52:29,480
this will always be
your home.

931
00:52:29,514 --> 00:52:33,551
Signora, thank you.

932
00:52:34,685 --> 00:52:36,421
Si, si.

933
00:52:36,454 --> 00:52:37,855


934
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:40,725
Si, Signora.

935
00:52:43,761 --> 00:52:47,365
You disappeared rather
swiftly this morning.

936
00:52:47,398 --> 00:52:48,233
Did I?

937
00:52:48,266 --> 00:52:49,033
I thought so.

938
00:52:49,066 --> 00:52:50,735
I didn't want to be
the gooseberry.

939
00:52:50,768 --> 00:52:51,802
I don't know
what you mean.

940
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:53,638
The three of us
went off together,

941
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:55,306
and so I thought...

942
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:57,575
Then you weren't
at lunch, either.

943
00:52:57,608 --> 00:52:59,310
No, I was at a cafe.

944
00:52:59,344 --> 00:53:01,412
With your young
Italian friend?

945
00:53:01,446 --> 00:53:03,581
Yes.
He's rather nice.

946
00:53:03,614 --> 00:53:05,316
Hmm.

947
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:06,717
I didn't think
you were a pickup.

948
00:53:06,751 --> 00:53:08,786
He's what
thousands of women

949
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:12,523
would give
their eyeteeth for.

950
00:53:12,557 --> 00:53:14,892
Well, I find it most
surprising in you.

951
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:15,626
He's a boy.

952
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:20,365
Miss Beaumont's
hardly antique.

953
00:53:20,398 --> 00:53:22,233
I don't know what
you're talking about.

954
00:53:22,267 --> 00:53:25,870
Well, I'm sorry
I made you angry.

955
00:53:25,903 --> 00:53:28,306
You didn't.

956
00:53:28,339 --> 00:53:31,409
We were simply worried,
that's all.

957
00:53:31,442 --> 00:53:33,478
Quite understandably,
as it turned out,

958
00:53:33,511 --> 00:53:36,747
with these political
shenanigans going on.

959
00:53:36,781 --> 00:53:38,783
You might've been
hurt, you know.

960
00:53:38,816 --> 00:53:40,518


961
00:53:43,588 --> 00:53:46,657
Miss Bentley,
the conjuring show--

962
00:53:46,691 --> 00:53:48,826
I really need
a collaborator

963
00:53:48,859 --> 00:53:50,828
for one of the tricks.

964
00:53:50,861 --> 00:53:52,830
Ooh.

965
00:53:52,863 --> 00:53:54,932
What does it entail?

966
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:58,369
Well, I thought that
we might rehearse it

967
00:53:58,403 --> 00:53:59,937
a bit tomorrow night.

968
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:01,839
Oh.

969
00:54:01,872 --> 00:54:04,775
Oh, I can't tomorrow night.

970
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:06,844
I'm dining in Como

971
00:54:06,877 --> 00:54:10,515
with my Italian boy.





974
00:54:19,424 --> 00:54:20,758
Hello?

975
00:54:20,791 --> 00:54:21,559
Come in.

976
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:23,294
                                                               
Oh, Major.

977
00:54:23,328 --> 00:54:24,462
Signore Bonizzoni                  

978
00:54:24,495 --> 00:54:25,496
is waiting for us
in the car.

979
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:26,731
He sent me up to see
if you were ready.

980
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:31,068
I'm trying to get these
wretched children dressed.

981
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:33,037
Angeli, button it,

982
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:35,740
or I'll choke you
to death.

983
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:38,042
Do you think
we should wake her up?

984
00:54:38,075 --> 00:54:39,910
Oh, let her sleep.

985
00:54:39,944 --> 00:54:41,512
She must need it
after yesterday.

986
00:54:41,546 --> 00:54:46,083
Poor old dear
must be exhausted.

987
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:48,853
"Old dear"?

988
00:54:49,954 --> 00:54:51,589
Hmm.

989
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:55,560
Little cow.

990
00:54:56,093 --> 00:54:59,029

991
00:55:06,937 --> 00:55:09,440
                               


993
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:21,085
Hello.

994
00:55:21,118 --> 00:55:23,954
I've wondered
where you've been.

995
00:55:23,988 --> 00:55:25,823
I haven't seen you
all day.

996
00:55:25,856 --> 00:55:28,926
Well, you spent most
of the day with the Major.

997
00:55:28,959 --> 00:55:31,929
He tells me you're
off to Como for dinner.

998
00:55:31,962 --> 00:55:35,566
Oh, news travels fast.

999
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,868
Gosh!

1000
00:55:37,902 --> 00:55:40,605
Did you take those?

1001
00:55:40,638 --> 00:55:41,739
Uh-huh.



1003
00:55:43,541 --> 00:55:47,878
You hot ticket, you.

1004
00:55:47,912 --> 00:55:51,382
Oh, whoever
would've thought it.

1005
00:55:51,416 --> 00:55:53,618
I insist you give me
all the details.

1006
00:55:53,651 --> 00:55:56,120
I'll tell you everything
later, my dear girl,

1007
00:55:56,153 --> 00:55:57,422
but not now.

1008
00:55:57,455 --> 00:55:59,490
You'll make me late
for dinner.

1009
00:55:59,524 --> 00:56:01,626
Ooh.

1010
00:56:08,065 --> 00:56:10,735

1016
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:43,968
                               


1019
00:56:52,142 --> 00:56:55,880
These pictures were definitely
of the same young man?

1020
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:56,747
Oh, yes.

1021
00:56:56,781 --> 00:56:59,517
Whatever else, she's
a good photographer.

1022
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:02,653
I'd know that face
anywhere.

1023
00:57:02,687 --> 00:57:03,988
With no shirt?

1024
00:57:04,021 --> 00:57:07,925
Well, I didn't make
a close inspection.

1025
00:57:07,958 --> 00:57:11,696
She certainly is
quite a girl, I'd say.

1026
00:57:11,729 --> 00:57:13,464
Wow. You women--

1027
00:57:13,498 --> 00:57:16,000
you really are
extraordinary.

1028
00:57:16,033 --> 00:57:18,736
You never cease
to surprise me.

1029
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:20,037
               
Good.

1030
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:23,140
I'd hate to be
predictable.

1031
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:24,174
Like you--

1032
00:57:24,208 --> 00:57:28,012
everything you do
is so...

1033
00:57:30,114 --> 00:57:31,982
Obvious.

1034
00:57:32,016 --> 00:57:35,019
Some girls like that.

1035
00:57:35,052 --> 00:57:36,086
They feel safe.

1036
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,622
               

1037
00:57:37,655 --> 00:57:40,558
Miss Bentley says
you have money.

1038
00:57:40,591 --> 00:57:42,159
Oh, does she?

1039
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:45,530
Well, she hasn't any right
to say that, has she?

1040
00:57:45,563 --> 00:57:47,898
I think she was
trying to get me

1041
00:57:47,932 --> 00:57:49,033
interested in you.

1042
00:57:49,066 --> 00:57:50,735
Ah.

1043
00:57:50,768 --> 00:57:52,503
And did she succeed?

1044
00:57:52,537 --> 00:57:57,041
Wouldn't you
like to know?

1045
00:57:59,143 --> 00:58:02,780
You drink rather a lot,
don't you?

1046
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:06,250
Didn't you,
at my age?

1047
00:58:08,853 --> 00:58:11,556
Do you know
what you remind me of,

1048
00:58:11,589 --> 00:58:15,660
sitting there
all prim and upright?

1049
00:58:15,693 --> 00:58:16,260
               

1050
00:58:16,293 --> 00:58:19,664
Go on. What?
Ha. Ha ha.

1051
00:58:19,697 --> 00:58:22,032
               

1052
00:58:22,066 --> 00:58:23,968
A candlestick.

1053
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:25,703
Ha ha ha ha!

1054
00:58:25,736 --> 00:58:27,905
Candlestick.

1055
00:58:27,938 --> 00:58:29,173
I think
I could probably

1056
00:58:29,206 --> 00:58:30,775
just blow you
right out.

1057
00:58:30,808 --> 00:58:32,610
Ooh hoo hoo hoo!

1058
00:58:32,643 --> 00:58:35,713
Ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!

1059
00:58:35,746 --> 00:58:37,848
Ooh.


1061
00:58:42,953 --> 00:58:46,591
God, you're so boring.

1062
00:58:46,624 --> 00:58:49,193
I want to have fun.

1063
00:58:51,962 --> 00:58:55,800
Well, look, let's go
and dance, shall we?

1064
00:58:56,333 --> 00:59:00,037
In this mortuary?

1065
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:02,573


1070
00:59:32,737 --> 00:59:35,105

Yoo-hoo!

1071
00:59:35,139 --> 00:59:36,173
Hey, candlestick!

1072
00:59:36,206 --> 00:59:38,175
Ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha!

1073
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:40,911
This is the style!

1074
00:59:40,945 --> 00:59:44,915
Come on, old man,
show me what you're made of.


1078
00:59:57,928 --> 01:00:01,198
Major                                                                                  wilshaw:
Oh! Hoo!

1079
01:00:01,231 --> 01:00:04,301
Miss                                                                                         Whoo!


1081
01:00:11,876 --> 01:00:12,576
Go!

1082
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:17,782
Candlestick,
set yourself alight!

1083
01:00:20,317 --> 01:00:22,052

1084
01:00:22,086 --> 01:00:24,655
A-whoo hoo hoo!

1085
01:00:24,689 --> 01:00:26,190
Ho ho!

1086
01:00:26,223 --> 01:00:27,391
Ah ha ha ha!
Ohh!

1087
01:00:27,424 --> 01:00:29,894
Oh, bugger!

1088
01:00:29,927 --> 01:00:31,762
Oh!

1089
01:00:31,796 --> 01:00:32,396
               

1090
01:00:32,429 --> 01:00:35,299
Oh!
Ho ho! Ho ho!

1091
01:00:35,332 --> 01:00:39,169
* ah ho ho ho ho

1092
01:00:39,203 --> 01:00:42,873

Whoo hoo!

1093
01:00:44,241 --> 01:00:45,843
Oh, shh, shh, shh.

1094
01:00:45,876 --> 01:00:48,112
Ooh. Ahh.

1095
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:50,781

1096
01:00:59,389 --> 01:01:02,259
If you're going
to kiss me,

1097
01:01:02,292 --> 01:01:03,928
you can kiss me.

1098
01:01:03,961 --> 01:01:07,898
Don't creep
all over me.

1099
01:01:12,937 --> 01:01:15,239
               

1100
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:21,345
Ohh!

1101
01:01:21,378 --> 01:01:23,914
Idiot.


1103
01:02:16,266 --> 01:02:19,469
You should be in bed.



1105
01:02:35,385 --> 01:02:36,553
                                                                                  
Hello?

1106
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:39,456
                                                                                                                                                                                 Can you spare me a minute, please?

1107
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:42,492
I'm very busy.

1108
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:47,131
Well, for the conjuring
show this evening.

1109
01:02:47,164 --> 01:02:49,499
You see, I--I'm still
rather hoping

1110
01:02:49,533 --> 01:02:52,302
that you might perhaps
give me a hand.

1111
01:02:52,336 --> 01:02:53,470
Oh, well...

1112
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:57,007
I wish you'd find
somebody else.

1113
01:02:57,041 --> 01:02:59,043
Well, you're
the only person

1114
01:02:59,076 --> 01:02:59,810
that I can trust.

1115
01:02:59,844 --> 01:03:01,545
I'm hopeless
at that sort of thing.

1116
01:03:01,578 --> 01:03:04,381
It's terribly simple.

1117
01:03:04,414 --> 01:03:07,217
You see, I invite--

1118
01:03:07,251 --> 01:03:10,220
I invite everyone
to write something down

1119
01:03:10,254 --> 01:03:11,555
on a piece of paper.

1120
01:03:11,588 --> 01:03:13,824
Um, well, I mean,

1121
01:03:13,858 --> 01:03:17,895
like, well,
"shall we join the ladies?"

1122
01:03:17,928 --> 01:03:21,565
And then they seal it up,
put it back in the envelope.

1123
01:03:21,598 --> 01:03:23,400
But for the trick
to work,

1124
01:03:23,433 --> 01:03:24,935
I really need
to know now

1125
01:03:24,969 --> 01:03:27,571
what it is that
you are going to write.

1126
01:03:27,604 --> 01:03:31,275
Well, that sounds
awfully like cheating.

1127
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:34,611
Well, just think of it
as a game--

1128
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:36,346
something
for the children.

1129
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:37,381
Those little monsters?

1130
01:03:37,414 --> 01:03:42,887
Well, all right,
then--for me.

1131
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:45,055
Please?

1132
01:03:46,356 --> 01:03:50,494
Just say the first thing
that comes into your head.

1133
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:54,064
Spring
in the mountains.

1134
01:03:55,432 --> 01:03:57,902
Very good.

1135
01:03:57,935 --> 01:04:02,039
Aha. Tremendous.
"Spring in the mountains."

1136
01:04:02,072 --> 01:04:04,474
Yes. Very good.
Thanks.

1137
01:04:04,508 --> 01:04:07,011
You appear to be
leaking, Major.

1138
01:04:07,044 --> 01:04:08,612
Oh, God.

1139
01:04:08,645 --> 01:04:10,881


1140
01:04:12,082 --> 01:04:15,585
Oh, hell's bells.

1141
01:04:16,286 --> 01:04:19,389
I still haven't got it
right.


1146
01:04:45,515 --> 01:04:47,517
Ladies and gentlemen,

1147
01:04:47,551 --> 01:04:49,519
Signores, Signoras,

1148
01:04:49,553 --> 01:04:51,555
will you give me
your kind attention?

1149
01:04:51,588 --> 01:04:54,358
A few examples
of the magic art.


1151
01:04:55,625 --> 01:04:57,161
Ladies and gentlemen,

1152
01:04:57,194 --> 01:04:59,163
Paulo the magic wanderer

1153
01:04:59,196 --> 01:05:01,431
would like to borrow
an egg.

1154
01:05:01,465 --> 01:05:03,600
Can anyone
oblige me with--

1155
01:05:03,633 --> 01:05:08,072
oh, I say.
I think I can see one.





1158
01:05:12,476 --> 01:05:13,543
Ha ha ha!

1159
01:05:13,577 --> 01:05:14,444
Oh!

 
1161
01:05:15,479 --> 01:05:18,482
Oh, what a lovely egg.

1162
01:05:18,515 --> 01:05:19,316
Thank you very much.

1163
01:05:19,349 --> 01:05:20,650
I shall put it
in my hat--

1164
01:05:20,684 --> 01:05:23,553
keep it nice and safe,
you see?

1165
01:05:23,587 --> 01:05:25,122
Now...

1166
01:05:25,522 --> 01:05:27,257
You know, I say,

1167
01:05:27,291 --> 01:05:31,561
you've got one
under yours, too.

1168
01:05:31,595 --> 01:05:33,130
Ha ha!

1169
01:05:33,163 --> 01:05:35,232
How clever.

1170
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:36,033

1171
01:05:36,066 --> 01:05:39,503
Lovely. Now I think
I need one more.

1172
01:05:39,536 --> 01:05:42,539
Signora Bonizzoni,
how lovely.

1173
01:05:42,572 --> 01:05:45,575

Oh ho ho ho ho!


1175
01:05:46,543 --> 01:05:50,347
three lovely fresh eggs.

1176
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:54,751
And now I need
my magic wand.

1177
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:57,621


1178
01:05:58,322 --> 01:06:00,490
Pow.


1180
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:08,398
The magic words--

1181
01:06:08,432 --> 01:06:11,035
abracadabra,
sack of potatoes,

1182
01:06:11,068 --> 01:06:12,669
corned beef and cabbage.

1183
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:14,571
And...

1184
01:06:14,604 --> 01:06:17,141
Hey, presto!

1185
01:06:17,174 --> 01:06:18,542
               

1186
01:06:18,575 --> 01:06:20,510


1187
01:06:20,544 --> 01:06:21,678
                                                                                            Bravo!

1188
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:23,147
Bravo!

1189
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:24,981
Bravo!
Bravo!

1190
01:06:32,622 --> 01:06:33,557
Signore Bonizzoni

1191
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:36,593
would you very kindly
distribute these for me?

1192
01:06:36,626 --> 01:06:39,096
Great pleasure.

1193
01:06:39,129 --> 01:06:41,231
Thank you.

1194
01:06:42,266 --> 01:06:43,533
There you go.

1195
01:06:43,567 --> 01:06:45,269
Miss Bentley.

1196
01:06:45,302 --> 01:06:46,236
Now, it's very easy.

1197
01:06:46,270 --> 01:06:49,606
Each of you writes down
on your piece of paper

1198
01:06:49,639 --> 01:06:51,641
a very simple phrase,

1199
01:06:51,675 --> 01:06:53,443
like "water on the brain"

1200
01:06:53,477 --> 01:06:56,246
or "better late
than never."

1201
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:58,515
You put it in the envelope,
you seal it up,

1202
01:06:58,548 --> 01:07:00,484
and then, without
opening the envelopes,

1203
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:01,751
I shall tell you
what is written

1204
01:07:01,785 --> 01:07:04,088
inside each one of them.


1206
01:07:07,457 --> 01:07:09,293
Easy one.

1207
01:07:09,326 --> 01:07:11,061
A light.

1208
01:07:11,095 --> 01:07:13,597
Lights.
Light.

1210
01:07:23,273 --> 01:07:24,208
Miss Beaumont.

1211
01:07:24,241 --> 01:07:27,111
Grazie.
Ha ha ha!

1212
01:07:30,747 --> 01:07:33,250
Miss Bentley.

1213
01:07:37,721 --> 01:07:40,390


1214
01:07:44,828 --> 01:07:48,498
I am now ready
to read your minds.

1215
01:07:50,734 --> 01:07:54,271
The first envelope.

1216
01:07:55,772 --> 01:07:59,276
Yes, yes, I think--

1217
01:07:59,776 --> 01:08:01,278
yes.

1218
01:08:01,311 --> 01:08:03,580
I think
I can penetrate the veil

1219
01:08:03,613 --> 01:08:05,182
of this first mind.

1220
01:08:05,215 --> 01:08:11,521
The words which this
envelope contains are...

1221
01:08:11,555 --> 01:08:13,690
"Spring in the mountains."



1223
01:08:16,726 --> 01:08:18,728
Did anyone write that?


1225
01:08:20,597 --> 01:08:22,799
"Spring in the mountains"?

1226
01:08:24,401 --> 01:08:25,335
I did.


1228
01:08:27,204 --> 01:08:28,272
Ohh.

1229
01:08:28,305 --> 01:08:29,406
Ah!

1230
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:31,241
Bravo!


1232
01:08:41,318 --> 01:08:42,919
Oh, yes.

1233
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:44,688
"Spring in the mountains."

1234
01:08:44,721 --> 01:08:46,190
There we are.

1235
01:08:46,223 --> 01:08:48,392
Now, uh...

1236
01:08:48,425 --> 01:08:50,160
The next envelope.

1237
01:08:50,194 --> 01:08:51,761
Um...

1238
01:08:51,795 --> 01:08:53,830
Yes, I think...

1239
01:08:53,863 --> 01:08:56,233
Yes, I think...

1240
01:08:56,266 --> 01:08:56,933
I, um--

1241
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:59,703
Patience, Signores, Signoras.

1242
01:08:59,736 --> 01:09:02,639
The words...

1243
01:09:03,307 --> 01:09:06,610
Did anyone write
"candlestick"?

1244
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:10,880
Hmm?

1245
01:09:10,914 --> 01:09:12,416
               

1246
01:09:12,449 --> 01:09:14,318
Did you?

1247
01:09:14,351 --> 01:09:16,953
               

1248
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:18,322
I did.

1249
01:09:18,355 --> 01:09:19,623


1253
01:09:39,776 --> 01:09:43,413
Hmm. Well, now...

1254
01:09:43,447 --> 01:09:47,251
I think something's
gone wrong.

1255
01:09:47,751 --> 01:09:49,686
Um...

1256
01:09:50,254 --> 01:09:52,756
I'm really--
I'm terribly sorry.

1257
01:09:52,789 --> 01:09:54,824
Uh, yes.

1258
01:09:54,858 --> 01:09:57,561
I think that's it.

1259
01:09:57,594 --> 01:10:00,264


1260
01:10:01,465 --> 01:10:05,001
Thank you, Major,
for such a wonderful show.

1261
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:09,639
He's very kind to
give us so much pleasure.

1262
01:10:09,673 --> 01:10:12,409
                                                                                           Bravo!


1264
01:10:18,782 --> 01:10:22,352
Now for something
not so good.

1265
01:10:22,386 --> 01:10:24,788
My dear signore Bonizzoni                                                                                          
and his family

1266
01:10:24,821 --> 01:10:28,292
must return to Milan
the day after tomorrow.


1268
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:32,296
But we must not be sad.

1269
01:10:32,329 --> 01:10:35,699
This is a special evening
for good friends,

1270
01:10:35,732 --> 01:10:39,269
so I have arranged a party
in the dining room

1271
01:10:39,303 --> 01:10:42,439
to celebrate
this wonderful evening

1272
01:10:42,472 --> 01:10:44,874
of enchantment.



1274
01:10:46,776 --> 01:10:49,479
The coming back
of happiness.

1275
01:10:49,513 --> 01:10:51,047
                                                                                          Brava!


1280
01:11:12,536 --> 01:11:15,772
Grazie, maggiore.

1281
01:11:19,476 --> 01:11:22,612
Oh ho ho! Signora Fascioli.

1282
01:11:22,646 --> 01:11:23,680
Grazie.


1284
01:11:24,348 --> 01:11:26,783
Ha ha.
I have a good idea.

1285
01:11:26,816 --> 01:11:27,817
What about a picnic?

1286
01:11:27,851 --> 01:11:31,455
A farewell final picnic,
tomorrow in the mountains.

1287
01:11:31,488 --> 01:11:32,922
Like lost deers, huh?

1288
01:11:32,956 --> 01:11:33,857
Oh, yes.

1289
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:36,660
The trouble is,
we are one more this time--

1290
01:11:36,693 --> 01:11:37,427
and my little car.

1291
01:11:37,461 --> 01:11:39,396
Oh, no, but
we could hire another.

1292
01:11:39,429 --> 01:11:41,898
The Major and I could
perhaps stand for that.

1293
01:11:41,931 --> 01:11:43,600
Invite your
Italian boyfriend.

1294
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:44,868
He drives, doesn't he?

1295
01:11:44,901 --> 01:11:46,069
An Italian boyfriend?

1296
01:11:46,102 --> 01:11:47,070
No, he's--

1297
01:11:47,103 --> 01:11:47,737
wonderful!

1298
01:11:47,771 --> 01:11:49,839
We just had a swim
together.

1299
01:11:49,873 --> 01:11:50,674
Oh.

1300
01:11:50,707 --> 01:11:52,409
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought it was lunch.

1301
01:11:52,442 --> 01:11:54,778
And dinner.
And photographs.

1302
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:56,413
Well, of course.
Invite him.

1303
01:11:56,446 --> 01:11:58,415
The car
will be most useful.

1304
01:11:58,448 --> 01:11:59,483
What is his name?

1305
01:11:59,516 --> 01:12:00,917
Balsari.
Vittorio Balsari.

1306
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:03,353
Vittorio Balsari.
Oh.

1307
01:12:03,387 --> 01:12:05,121
Nice boy.
I know his father.

1308
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:07,023
Major,
a good trick, that--

1309
01:12:07,056 --> 01:12:08,692
the one with
the envelopes.

1310
01:12:08,725 --> 01:12:09,659
Thank you.

1311
01:12:09,693 --> 01:12:10,394
How's it done?

1312
01:12:10,427 --> 01:12:13,363
Easy. It's as old
as the hills.

1313
01:12:13,397 --> 01:12:15,832
Good night.

1314
01:12:19,469 --> 01:12:20,537
Wait a minute,
young lady.

1315
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:21,971
What did you mean
by that?

1316
01:12:22,005 --> 01:12:23,373
That joke's
an old Chestnut.

1317
01:12:23,407 --> 01:12:24,408
I learned it
at school.

1318
01:12:24,441 --> 01:12:26,510
Don't be so spiteful!
He thinks the world of you!

1319
01:12:26,543 --> 01:12:27,377
Then he's an idiot!

1320
01:12:27,411 --> 01:12:29,012
No, he's not!
He's kind!

1321
01:12:29,045 --> 01:12:30,013
Maybe he tries too hard.

1322
01:12:30,046 --> 01:12:32,816
All he requires is
a little indulgence from you.

1323
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:34,951
If it means
so much to you,

1324
01:12:34,984 --> 01:12:38,855
why don't you
indulge him yourself?

1325
01:12:39,656 --> 01:12:40,690
Everything all right?

1326
01:12:40,724 --> 01:12:42,459


1329
01:13:04,113 --> 01:13:05,549
Ohh!




1332
01:13:15,659 --> 01:13:17,927
Uhh. Ohh.


1336
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:33,176
Sorry.

1337
01:13:33,209 --> 01:13:35,545
Don't worry. I should've
locked the door.

1338
01:13:35,579 --> 01:13:38,482
No. I should've
knocked.

1339
01:13:39,015 --> 01:13:42,118
I'm sorry
about last night.

1340
01:13:44,554 --> 01:13:46,490
I probably deserved it.

1341
01:13:46,523 --> 01:13:49,225
You probably did.

1342
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:52,462
God, you remind me
of my mother.

1343
01:13:53,196 --> 01:13:56,099
And you remind me of mine.

1344
01:13:56,132 --> 01:13:58,968


1345
01:14:01,137 --> 01:14:03,607
Well...

1346
01:14:07,677 --> 01:14:10,580
The Major might say...

1347
01:14:10,614 --> 01:14:13,049
Pax.

1348
01:14:13,082 --> 01:14:15,251
Pax.

1349
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:16,986
But you did lead him on.

1350
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:19,155
You made
a complete ass of him.

1351
01:14:19,188 --> 01:14:21,257
Admit it.

1352
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:25,529
Is that all
the thanks I get?

1353
01:14:25,929 --> 01:14:26,696
If I hadn't led him on,

1354
01:14:26,730 --> 01:14:30,033
he wouldn't still
be here, would he?

1355
01:14:30,066 --> 01:14:31,835
True?

1356
01:14:34,103 --> 01:14:36,272
Hmm.

1357
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:38,542
True.

1358
01:14:39,175 --> 01:14:40,944
True.

1359
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:43,580


1360
01:14:45,849 --> 01:14:48,652
Good morning, everybody!

1361
01:14:48,685 --> 01:14:52,221
What a wonderful day.

1362
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:54,658
Oh, morning, Major.

1363
01:14:54,691 --> 01:14:56,225
Vittorio.

1364
01:14:56,259 --> 01:14:57,727
I'm not late, am I?

1365
01:14:57,761 --> 01:14:59,195
Oh, no, no, no.



1367
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:06,736
To our holiday!

1368
01:15:06,770 --> 01:15:09,005
Viva!
Hey!

1369
01:15:09,038 --> 01:15:10,940
Very nice.

1370
01:15:10,974 --> 01:15:13,176
Major, will you
come back to the lake?

1371
01:15:13,209 --> 01:15:15,311
Oh, by George,
yes, I hope so.

1372
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:18,147
Oh. Miss Bentley,
of course.

1373
01:15:18,181 --> 01:15:20,016
Well, we'll see.

1374
01:15:20,049 --> 01:15:22,919
You must prefer Como.

1375
01:15:22,952 --> 01:15:25,989
Well, Como--
Como is very nice,

1376
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:27,323
but not so nice
as this.


1378
01:15:28,658 --> 01:15:30,760
I hate Como.

1379
01:15:30,794 --> 01:15:32,161
It's so boring.


1381
01:15:33,096 --> 01:15:35,09
The nicest place

1382
01:15:35,131 --> 01:15:36,766
I've been to
in Italy

1383
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,568
is a little town

1384
01:15:38,602 --> 01:15:39,669
in one of the valleys

1385
01:15:39,703 --> 01:15:41,671
between Bolsano
and Venice.

1386
01:15:41,705 --> 01:15:43,773
They grow tobacco.

1387
01:15:43,807 --> 01:15:47,143
Stupid, though. I can't
remember its name.

1388
01:15:47,176 --> 01:15:48,812
Venezia.

1389
01:15:48,845 --> 01:15:51,247
Vittorio's family
have a palazzo there.

1390
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,081
In Venice?

1391
01:15:52,115 --> 01:15:56,586
My family has 4 houses
and 27 servants.

1392
01:15:56,620 --> 01:15:58,054
Hmm. Well,
you won't have them

1393
01:15:58,087 --> 01:15:59,689
much longer though,
will you?

1394
01:15:59,723 --> 01:16:00,724
They'll all be
called up

1395
01:16:00,757 --> 01:16:01,524
if there's going
to be a war.

1396
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:02,959
You're right.

1397
01:16:02,992 --> 01:16:05,194
This country's
not just for tourists.

1398
01:16:05,228 --> 01:16:08,732
My father's factory
has to work 24 hours a day

1399
01:16:08,765 --> 01:16:09,565
for the army.

1400
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:12,368
Very soon, we shall
all be in uniform.

1401
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:13,236
I sincerely hope

1402
01:16:13,269 --> 01:16:15,605
that that will not
prove to be the case.

1403
01:16:15,639 --> 01:16:16,773
Yes.

1404
01:16:16,806 --> 01:16:18,908
This is
a beautiful place

1405
01:16:18,942 --> 01:16:19,943
and a beautiful day.

1406
01:16:19,976 --> 01:16:21,945
Why do we talk
of such things?

1407
01:16:21,978 --> 01:16:22,946


1408
01:16:22,979 --> 01:16:25,081
You're
absolutely right.

1409
01:16:25,114 --> 01:16:27,183
Besides...

1410
01:16:27,216 --> 01:16:29,986
I'd look ridiculous
in uniform.


1412
01:16:32,321 --> 01:16:35,959
Well, now, who's for
a game of cricket?

1413
01:16:35,992 --> 01:16:36,760
Good idea.

1414
01:16:36,793 --> 01:16:38,161
Oh, bellissimo.

1415
01:16:38,194 --> 01:16:38,862
Come on, Major.

1416
01:16:38,895 --> 01:16:41,064
Vittorio...




1419
01:16:46,235 --> 01:16:48,271
Ahem.


1421
01:16:55,044 --> 01:16:57,280
Guess what?

1422
01:16:57,313 --> 01:17:00,116
The Bonizzoni’s
have given me notice.

1423
01:17:00,149 --> 01:17:01,117
It seems I'm not

1424
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:05,288
the world's greatest
nanny after all.

1425
01:17:07,724 --> 01:17:09,358
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1426
01:17:09,392 --> 01:17:10,393
               

1427
01:17:10,426 --> 01:17:11,360
Liar.

               

1429
01:17:16,299 --> 01:17:18,101
So--so, you...

1430
01:17:18,134 --> 01:17:19,335
You're going home?

1431
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:20,103
God, no.

1432
01:17:20,136 --> 01:17:22,205
My mother would
have me arrested.

1433
01:17:22,238 --> 01:17:26,309
She already thinks i'm
a delinquent as it is.

1434
01:17:26,342 --> 01:17:29,078
She's probably right.

1435
01:17:31,715 --> 01:17:33,817
And then what?

1436
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:40,824
When one door closes...

1437
01:17:43,927 --> 01:17:46,830
Good luck!

1438
01:17:51,467 --> 01:17:54,070
               

1439
01:17:54,103 --> 01:17:55,204
Oh!

1440
01:17:55,238 --> 01:17:57,106
Too late.

1441
01:17:57,140 --> 01:17:59,675

1443
01:18:07,216 --> 01:18:11,420
The ball!

1444
01:18:11,454 --> 01:18:13,790
Oh!

1445
01:18:13,823 --> 01:18:16,225
1, 2...

1446
01:18:16,259 --> 01:18:17,927
3. Ha ha!

1447
01:18:17,961 --> 01:18:19,262
I win, I win!


1452
01:18:58,101 --> 01:19:00,536

Aah! Ohh!

1453
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:02,305
Where are you going?

1454
01:19:05,308 --> 01:19:07,443
For a stroll.

1455
01:19:29,565 --> 01:19:31,367
Penny.

1456
01:19:33,069 --> 01:19:35,972
How long are you
staying for?

1457
01:19:36,005 --> 01:19:37,540
Two days.

1458
01:19:37,573 --> 01:19:39,008
Two?

1459
01:19:39,042 --> 01:19:39,742
Mm-hmm.

1460
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:42,078
I thought you said
a whole month.

1461
01:19:42,111 --> 01:19:44,147
I did...

1462
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:46,782
But I changed my mind.

1463
01:19:49,085 --> 01:19:51,921


1464
01:19:52,521 --> 01:19:54,824
Ah.

1465
01:19:54,858 --> 01:19:58,027
Ah. Mmm.

1466
01:20:03,599 --> 01:20:05,201
Ah.

1467
01:20:06,202 --> 01:20:08,171
               

1468
01:20:08,204 --> 01:20:10,106
Ah.

1469
01:20:15,378 --> 01:20:18,547
Oh oh!

1470
01:20:18,581 --> 01:20:20,984
Oh oh!

1471
01:20:21,017 --> 01:20:23,352
Damn.

1472
01:20:23,386 --> 01:20:25,121
Oop.

1473
01:20:25,154 --> 01:20:28,024
Ahem.

1474
01:20:28,057 --> 01:20:30,159
We must go home now!

1475
01:20:30,193 --> 01:20:32,862
Oh oh!


1478
01:20:45,374 --> 01:20:47,977
This is
the BBC world service

1479
01:20:48,011 --> 01:20:48,912
from London.

1480
01:20:48,945 --> 01:20:50,413
The time is six o’clock.

1481
01:20:50,446 --> 01:20:52,448
Today,
Winston Churchill, MP,

1482
01:20:52,481 --> 01:20:54,550
had a private meeting
with Von Ribbentrop,

1483
01:20:54,583 --> 01:20:56,185
the foreign minister
of Germany,

1484
01:20:56,219 --> 01:20:59,055
to discuss a case for
an Anglo-German alliance

1485
01:20:59,088 --> 01:21:01,024
in which Germany
would stand guard

1486
01:21:01,057 --> 01:21:01,925
for the British Empire.

1487
01:21:01,958 --> 01:21:04,493
In exchange,
Germany requested

1488
01:21:04,527 --> 01:21:05,995
the return
of her colonies

1489
01:21:06,029 --> 01:21:08,331
and that Britain
grant her a free hand

1490
01:21:08,364 --> 01:21:09,332
in Eastern Europe.

1491
01:21:09,365 --> 01:21:11,434
It was clearly indicated
by Churchill

1492
01:21:11,467 --> 01:21:14,203
that the British government
would not concede

1493
01:21:14,237 --> 01:21:15,371
to such terms.

1494
01:21:15,404 --> 01:21:17,373
Great Britain would never
disinterest herself

1495
01:21:17,406 --> 01:21:19,042
in the fortunes
of the continent

1496
01:21:19,075 --> 01:21:20,243
to an extent
which would enable Germany

1497
01:21:20,276 --> 01:21:24,280
to gain domination
of central and Eastern Europe.

1498
01:21:24,313 --> 01:21:25,681
Von Ribbentrop replied,

1499
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:28,284
"The Fuhrer is resolved
that nothing will stop him,

1500
01:21:28,317 --> 01:21:31,654
and that war
is inevitable."

1501
01:21:31,687 --> 01:21:34,323


1502
01:21:46,202 --> 01:21:47,670
May I join you?

1503
01:21:47,703 --> 01:21:50,339
Yes.

1504
01:21:53,242 --> 01:21:54,277
That looks rather good.

1505
01:21:54,310 --> 01:21:56,112
I'll have one of those,
too, please.


1507
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:04,153
You go ahead, please.

1508
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:10,159
The sun's really quite warm

1509
01:22:10,193 --> 01:22:12,695
when you consider
that it's only May.

1510
01:22:12,728 --> 01:22:14,430
Mmm.

1511
01:22:15,731 --> 01:22:17,066
Yes, it's really been

1512
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:18,367
exceptionally warm
all month.

1513
01:22:18,401 --> 01:22:20,336
Yes, I've heard even
the Italians say,

1514
01:22:20,369 --> 01:22:23,106
"it has been
exceptionally warm."

1515
01:22:23,139 --> 01:22:25,508
It's awfully
quiet here

1516
01:22:25,541 --> 01:22:27,210
without
the Bonizzonis.

1517
01:22:27,243 --> 01:22:30,346
Mm, yes, very cheerful,
weren't they?

1518
01:22:30,379 --> 01:22:32,115
Mmm.

1519
01:22:36,485 --> 01:22:38,254


1520
01:22:38,287 --> 01:22:39,255
You were saying.

1521
01:22:39,288 --> 01:22:40,623
No, I was
only going to say,

1522
01:22:40,656 --> 01:22:42,358
you seem to have
got up rather early.

1523
01:22:42,391 --> 01:22:44,327
Were you thinking
of going for a swim?

1524
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:47,230
No, I was thinking of going
up into the mountains again.

1525
01:22:47,263 --> 01:22:48,131
Apparently there's a bus

1526
01:22:48,164 --> 01:22:50,733
that takes you
most of the way.

1527
01:22:50,766 --> 01:22:54,003
Don't suppose
you'd care to come?

1528
01:23:00,376 --> 01:23:02,645
I really ought
to do my packing.

1529
01:23:02,678 --> 01:23:05,048
Well, it shouldn't
take too long.

1530
01:23:05,081 --> 01:23:06,782
We could be back
by three o’clock.

1531
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:08,351
Oh, I can't.

1532
01:23:08,384 --> 01:23:10,153
I've simply got
too much to do.

1533
01:23:10,186 --> 01:23:12,355
Well, you've got until tomorrow.
What time's your train?

1534
01:23:12,388 --> 01:23:14,123
Well, and then
there's another thing.

1535
01:23:14,157 --> 01:23:16,459
I really ought to get
my sleeper ticket.

1536
01:23:16,492 --> 01:23:18,194
I've got an open one.

1537
01:23:18,227 --> 01:23:20,163
I should've got it
yesterday.

1538
01:23:20,196 --> 01:23:23,132
Oh, very well.

1539
01:23:24,433 --> 01:23:29,305
I expect you'd rather say
good-bye to Como, anyway.

1540
01:23:40,149 --> 01:23:42,118
Maggiore.

1541
01:23:45,388 --> 01:23:48,457

1544
01:25:05,534 --> 01:25:07,536
Good God.

1545
01:25:08,371 --> 01:25:09,838
What?

1546
01:25:09,872 --> 01:25:14,177
Your ears have gone
bright red.

1547
01:25:14,210 --> 01:25:16,512
Well...

1548
01:25:19,348 --> 01:25:21,850
I'll tell you what.

1549
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:26,589
If you don't stay
for a month,

1550
01:25:26,622 --> 01:25:30,293
I shall chuck you
in the lake.

1551
01:25:33,796 --> 01:25:36,565
I dare you.

1553
01:26:01,890 --> 01:26:06,429
Oh, yes. Lake is magical,

1554
01:26:06,462 --> 01:26:07,863
for as we kissed,

1555
01:26:07,896 --> 01:26:11,634
I could swear
that music played.

1556
01:26:13,302 --> 01:26:15,571
Now the war's over,
we've come back.

1557
01:26:15,604 --> 01:26:18,274
To our relief,
the villa is still here.

1558
01:26:18,307 --> 01:26:21,377
Last night
we drank champagne,

1559
01:26:21,410 --> 01:26:24,480
and we raised our glasses
to Miss Beaumont.

1560
01:26:24,513 --> 01:26:27,650
After all, it's thanks to her
we are together.

1561
01:26:27,683 --> 01:26:29,252
And she was magical, too.

1562
01:26:29,285 --> 01:26:34,357
Our holidays are planned
till the end of time.

1563
01:26:34,390 --> 01:26:39,528
Every year we'll spend
springtime in the mountains,

1564
01:26:39,562 --> 01:26:45,434
and every Summer,
a month by the lake.
