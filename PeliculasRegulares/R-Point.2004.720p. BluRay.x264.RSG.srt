00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:41,430
<i>Nah Trang, Vietnam
01-07-1972, 1:30 AM</i>

2
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,170
Come in, Butterfly.

3
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,420
Donkey three, come in, Butterfly.

4
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,410
Butterfly, come in, Donkey three.

5
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,880
Come in, Butterfly.

6
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,410
Go and report this, hurry!

7
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:35,610
We're dying like hell!

8
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,720
Butterfly, Butterfly.

9
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,120
Come in, Donkey three. Come in, Donkey three. Over.

10
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,190
Who the f*** is this?

11
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,070
Donkey three was your unit, right?

12
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,720
No, it's not possible.

13
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,100
My men are all dead!

14
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,530
Then how is that they sent a transmission 3 days ago!

15
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,880
And it's the 3rd time this month!

16
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,780
Who the f*** sent the transmissions then?

17
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,210
I swear, they're all dead!

18
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:47,920
I collected their tags myself.

19
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,190
With these hands!

20
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:58,360
Who did this to you? Viet Cong?

21
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,800
There are no f***ing Viet Cong in R-Point!

22
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,870
I watched all of them f***ing die!

23
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,390
I'm telling you, this is paradise!

24
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,400
What? I'm coming!

25
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,010
Lieutenant CHOI!

26
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,330
Hello, how are you?

27
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,290
Alright.

28
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,980
Damn, she's hot!

29
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,490
Sleep.

30
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,100
Don't shoot.

31
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:08,890
Don't move!

32
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,040
Don't move!

33
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,990
Private KIM!

34
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,800
F***, I saw this coming!

35
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:00,790
I'll take it.

36
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,000
It came earlier than I expected.

37
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,580
Investigation Division, yes sir!

38
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:15,540
He's here, sir.

39
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,320
Two damn decorations!

40
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,130
You're an excellent soldier CHOI.

41
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,680
And the only survivor of the battle at Honbawoo...

42
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,790
I heard you're ill.

43
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,940
I'm fine now. I'll be released in 2 days.

44
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,500
Have some tea.

45
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,890
It's Ho Chi Minh's favorite.

46
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,650
No, thank you, sir.

47
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,990
You never go to battle without shedding some blood...

48
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,520
whether it's yours or the enemy's.

49
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,500
That's why no one likes being in your platoon, right?

50
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,800
Confidential

51
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,590
This is a list of the men who went missing 6 months ago.

52
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,560
This case requires a competent leader like you.

53
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,650
I'd like to have my old platoon back.

54
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,190
According to us, yesterday's incident never happened.

55
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,090
Is this an order?

56
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,630
Congratulations on being back in the fight.

57
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,140
What the...? That's disgusting!

58
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,280
Move your hands!

59
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,490
He's clean.

60
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,500
What're you here for?

61
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,960
I traded my medical certificate for 50 bucks.

62
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,870
Why?

63
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,190
50 bucks is enough to buy a cow.

64
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,440
And I want to buy my mom one.

65
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,690
A f***ing cow.

66
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,470
Sergeant JANG, 18 years old?

67
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:00,280
That means you were recruited at 16?

68
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,410
16?

69
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,420
Yes, sir.

70
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,450
The recruitment documents were issued to my old brother...

71
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,260
And I used them to enlist, without my family knowing.

72
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,260
He's a f***ing kid?

73
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,360
He fooled us all?

74
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,220
You saying a f***ing kid like that

75
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:26,330
is the same rank as me?

76
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,850
What's going on?

77
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,430
Can't go home until we get cleaned up.

78
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:35,630
What's the f***ing big deal? So we got syphilis.

79
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,570
My family's expecting to see me at the port.

80
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,160
No need to give you a long speech.

81
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,420
Once again,

82
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,840
the region you're assigned to is a non-combat zone.

83
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,960
A f***ing 'non-combat' zone.

84
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,520
If you complete the mission,

85
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,720
you're going home on a f***ing "plane".

86
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,000
Remember, it' a plane, not a ship.

87
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,440
You'll have hot stewardesses serving you juice, get it?

88
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,900
Sergeant PARK, I'm in!

89
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,180
Corporal BYUN!

90
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,180
Sergeant OH!

91
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:23,410
Double check all your gear!

92
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,360
Attention!

93
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,210
Salute, sir,

94
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,470
I'm Sergeant JIN!

95
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,890
CHOI Tae-in, First Lieutenant!

96
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,530
These are the men, sir.

97
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:39,470
Attention.

98
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,680
That's alright. At ease.

99
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,080
At ease.

100
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,850
When are we going?

101
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,110
Just relax, man.

102
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:55,690
You know that bastard!

103
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,380
You mean Sergeant JIN?

104
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:01,420
He's a cold-blooded killer. Been here for 3 years and...

105
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,660
I've seen a picture of him holding a VC soldier's head cut off!

106
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,250
You dumb ass! Everybody does that crap here!

107
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,380
Have you?

108
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:16,500
Damn right, was no big deal. Nothing scares me!

109
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,480
Cut that f***ing racket out!

110
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,200
Just a few days away from going home too.

111
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,710
f***.

112
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,760
Pisses me off.

113
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,830
It's not looking good.

114
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,430
We got a moron and a psychopath!

115
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,440
We're f***ing doomed!

116
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:55,250
I'll be back in a week! Hear me?

117
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,720
You believe this f***ing weather?

118
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,680
It's my first time on a ship.

119
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,680
You were a pen pusher, right? No, then what missions...

120
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:27,830
How about a souvenir photo?

121
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,680
Sounds good! Damn good idea!

122
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,710
You think you're here on a picnic or something?

123
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:40,830
No, sir.

124
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:44,610
Why not? Let's do it.

125
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,560
Sure, it's damn good!

126
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,670
Just wait!

127
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:58,480
Here we go, one, two, three!

128
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,650
<i>R-POINT: Day 1</i>

129
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,820
These f***ing mosquitoes!

130
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:53,790
Damn, I'm missing the welcome home party at Pusan!

131
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,310
Cease fire!

132
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,650
Cease fire!

133
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,260
It's coming from 11:00.

134
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:55,420
Sergeant JANG, get the f*** out of there!

135
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,140
I can't.

136
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,610
Move, son of a bitch!

137
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,400
Run like hell, on my count!

138
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,660
1, 2...

139
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,680
Corporal JOH, give it to me!

140
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,400
Cover me!

141
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:40,250
These bastards have been dead for ages.

142
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:57,850
Search her.

143
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:08,890
What's this?

144
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:14,190
If you touch a dead person's things, your fingers'll rot off.

145
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,400
I just had a look!

146
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,610
Take care of her.

147
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,180
You f***ing baby! You can't do it, can you?

148
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,190
Corporal LEE, finish her.

149
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:07,590
You pussy. Don't have the balls, huh?

150
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:18,990
Let me do this.

151
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,290
Move out.

152
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,200
Sergeant JIN, take the lead.

153
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,950
This is where R-Point begins.

154
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,500
Let's take a break.

155
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,860
Break time.

156
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,970
We almost there?

157
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:32,460
Yeah.

158
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,380
Give me a smoke then.

159
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:40,380
What? A gravestone!

160
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,810
What does... it say?

161
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:48,410
Hey, read it out aloud.

162
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:51,390
How weird! I don't like this.

163
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:54,420
There used to be a lake here.

164
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:59,580
Cut the crap! There's nothing but trees.

165
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:05,620
"Hundreds of years ago, the Chinese killed Vietnamese

166
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,200
and dumped them into the lake."

167
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:12,700
"After that they filled the lake, and built a temple on it."

168
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,710
Bullshit! You lying son of a bitch!

169
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:20,180
That's why it's so foggy.

170
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,560
"Wherever you go, I'll be there."

171
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,060
"lf you have blood on your hands..."

172
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,900
I can't read the rest.

173
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,280
You're a f***ing story teller.

174
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,990
No, he's right.

175
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,580
Let's go.

176
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:46,490
Let's go.

177
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,680
This shit's creepy!

178
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,710
What the...? "bloody hand are"...what?

179
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:00,220
I've had blood on my hands, so what?

180
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:00,920
Hey, Corporal LEE!

181
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,820
What?

182
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,860
Don't disrespect it.

183
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,520
Don't be a pussy.

184
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,490
I ain't afraid of shit.

185
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,210
Hey asshole, wait up!

186
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,410
Hurry!

187
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:21,110
"Can't go back"

188
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:40,750
Sergeant PARK. You're in the military band, right?

189
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:46,890
Mr. Sex Machine PARK is all dried up in Vietnam.

190
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:51,300
So you blow... the bugle or what?

191
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:55,980
You idiot! "The bugle"?

192
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,610
It's called a Saxophone!

193
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:02,800
If you play one of those, you can't get it up, right?

194
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,440
What asshole said that?

195
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,120
My cock's got more power than any of yours!

196
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:15,040
That's why all the hot bitches wanna f*** me.

197
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:19,730
There isn't a single vocalist in Korea I haven't screwed.

198
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:22,630
I'm the god father of the bitches!

199
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,700
You wanna stand up and let the f***ers know we're here?

200
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,720
No, sir.

201
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,890
One, two, one, two...

202
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:38,750
Butterfly, come in. Mole three has met Romeo, over.

203
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:40,810
Butterfly.

204
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,400
Hand it over when you get through.

205
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:52,920
Why are you cutting up your clothes?

206
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,140
You have no idea? Never been on a mission, right?

207
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,830
We believe we can survive by doing this.

208
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,550
Sorry, sir.

209
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,080
What a nutcase.

210
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:22,140
What did you do before coming to Vietnam?

211
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,200
It might freak you out.

212
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,890
I washed corpses.

213
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,240
Bullshit!

214
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,400
He means it.

215
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,410
Don't try to f*** with me!

216
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:43,390
His father's an undertaker.

217
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:47,480
You saw him reading Chinese characters well.

218
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,970
'Cause they use Chinese characters a lot in that line.

219
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,600
Is he serious?

220
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,480
Yes, sir.

221
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,180
I got a strange feeling. Something's not right here.

222
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:09,490
What do you mean?

223
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:16,780
No sunshine, it's damp with moisture, and foggy.

224
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:22,000
It's not a good place for graves.

225
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:29,590
It's not good for people, living or dead, except maybe...

226
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,810
Except who?

227
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:42,680
Well, there must be some.

228
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,020
I'm asking you, "who"?

229
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,240
Ghosts.

230
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,820
Cut the crap, you son of a bitch!

231
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:02,390
I'm out of here. How about you?

232
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,500
Hey, wait up!

233
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,000
Corporal JOH.

234
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,850
Wait up!

235
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,640
Assholes!

236
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,530
Salute!

237
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:42,410
You scared the hell out of me, you idiot!

238
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:58,980
Lieutenant.

239
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,430
It's working now.

240
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,570
Mole three, come in, Butterfly.

241
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,370
Donkey Three has met Romeo.

242
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:22,030
We've reached the check point.

243
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,110
Our coordinates are D270W279

244
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:32,410
We are in section R5,

245
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:35,990
reporting at 06:30. And from 07:00...

246
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,280
Room one first floor, clear.

247
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,710
Basement, clear!

248
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,890
Fucking made in the USA.

249
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:49,850
It's a piece of shit, here.

250
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:54,770
What's this?

251
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,960
Come on!

252
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,650
Hey, wait up!

253
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:04,280
Our mission is to find

254
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,800
their whereabouts, dead or alive.

255
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:13,010
The surrounding area covering 3.5 km

256
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:15,170
from this spot is "R-Point".

257
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:18,610
This region is considered

258
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:22,120
to be "sacred" to the Vietnamese.

259
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,490
Remember, we only have 7 days to complete our mission, and cleanly.

260
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:30,270
We'll move in 2 units.

261
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:33,060
What battalion did the missing men belong to?

262
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,530
It's f***ing irrelevant to you!

263
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,400
Battalion 53!

264
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:39,220
Battalion 5...3?

265
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:44,360
You're from the 53rd, right? You know them then?

266
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,970
Bullshit!

267
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,030
I don't know shit about them.

268
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,820
Today, Sergeant JIN's unit is scouting R-5,

269
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:55,020
the rest of you search this area.

270
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,180
Move!

271
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,240
The sooner you find them, the sooner you go home.

272
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:06,090
It's been long enough for them to turn into ghosts or something by now.

273
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,970
Dammit!

274
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:41,550
We're basically a bunch of chumps, right, Sergeant OH?

275
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,620
Sergeant OH?

276
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:49,800
Sergeant OH!

277
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,030
Sergeant OH.

278
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,520
Where are you?

279
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,420
Sergeant OH!

280
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,180
This isn't funny, quit it!

281
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:42,360
Sergeant OH! How many times do I have to call....

282
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:46,530
You freaked me out! Why didn't you answer me?

283
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:50,370
Jung-Suk, wait for me

284
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,180
Are you listening to me?

285
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:26,980
Quit messing with me!

286
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,750
I don't like this shit, sir!

287
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,700
Corporal LEE!

288
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:01,280
Let's take a break.

289
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:12,990
What are you eating?

290
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:17,120
What're you grubbing on?

291
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,960
You f***ing brat!

292
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,410
Here, have all you want.

293
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:25,580
It's antibiotics, you asshole.

294
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,730
Fuck you!

295
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,840
For your information, it doesn't help.

296
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,310
What? Missing?

297
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,430
Give me the map.

298
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,640
What's your location?

299
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,500
Got it.

300
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:49,680
We're heading for R-6, we'll meet up there!

301
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,410
Corporal JOH!

302
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,620
Corporal JOH!

303
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:08,990
Corporal JOH!

304
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,890
We're here to find the missing men and one of us is missing? Shit!

305
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,400
It's so creepy!

306
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,380
What's this smell?

307
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,280
I almost shot you!

308
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:21,090
You came out of nowhere!

309
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,750
Have you found him?

310
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,000
Not yet, sir.

311
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:45,380
Lieutenant!

312
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,370
I'm telling the truth!

313
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,210
You asshole!

314
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,310
Sergeant JIN!

315
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:10,900
The Lieutenant saved your ass, you're lucky.

316
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:22,050
Alright, we've got lights!

317
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,430
What?

318
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,610
"Jung-sook, wait for me" is written on your helmet, right?

319
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:34,690
What'd you say?

320
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:40,570
Have you f***ing lost it?

321
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,160
What's your problem?

322
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:50,120
What're you doing?

323
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,460
Cut the "Jung-sook" shit out!

324
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:59,310
I'm right, ain't I?

325
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:01,240
You son of a bitch!

326
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,350
What's going on?

327
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:15,600
Who are those bastards?

328
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:24,370
What? Yankees?

329
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:28,100
How come they're here this late?

330
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,080
Stay calm.

331
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,320
I'm Sergeant First Class Beck from C&E.

332
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,710
I'm Lieutenant CHOI.

333
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,920
Anyway, what made you come up here at night?

334
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,420
We can only come up here at night, Lieutenant.

335
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,570
We can't operate the chopper in the day because of fog.

336
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:56,120
We usually come up here every four days to check the batteries.

337
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,430
Is that your camp, Lieutenant?

338
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,090
Why?

339
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:06,020
Is this building your governmental property?

340
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:09,710
I ain't got nothing to do with the mother f***ing U.S government

341
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,250
Let me tell you guys something.

342
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:14,260
Keep your rusty dick beaters off my shit in this room.

343
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:16,890
Don't worry.

344
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,560
What made you come up here?

345
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,460
We came up to look for my soldiers.

346
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,610
You gotta be shitting me... right?

347
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,900
We came to find our soldiers who've been missing for the last six months.

348
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:39,240
You know it was a retreat for French soldiers?

349
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:42,510
Yeah, a retreat for French soldiers.

350
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:46,510
Fuck, a lot of French soldiers were exterminated here.

351
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:49,240
It all happened so fast.

352
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:54,320
But I can sure as hell tell you one thing, it wasn't the VC that did it.

353
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,170
Hell during that time the VCs didn't exist.

354
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:00,530
There's nothing alive here in R-point.

355
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:03,500
Neither ROK soldiers nor VCs can survive here.

356
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,700
What do you mean by that?

357
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,810
You haven't heard the rumors about this place?

358
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:10,680
What rumors?

359
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,100
Don't worry about it.

360
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,810
Hey, good bye guys!

361
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:19,920
Hey Sergeant, don't waste your time on these fools.

362
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,040
Goodbye, come again !

363
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,120
Let's go.

364
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,120
Thanks for the beer.

365
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,120
Hey come on Sergeant, let's go.

366
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,390
You know why my soldiers are urging me?

367
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,880
They wanna make a bet as soon as possible.

368
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:35,910
Bet?

369
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:40,000
That in four days when we come back, you won't still be alive.

370
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,460
What do you mean?

371
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,010
I already told you. This is R-point.

372
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,510
No one can survive.

373
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,930
Let me make myself clear.

374
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:52,390
Don't touch my shit on the 2nd floor.

375
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:56,210
By the way, good luck.

376
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:58,890
You're gonna need it, Lieutenant.

377
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:11,710
Salute!

378
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,500
Have a drink. No, thank you, sir.

379
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,960
Sit down and drink.

380
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,810
Thank you, sir.

381
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:23,740
Hey, I found this. Try and fix it.

382
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:26,990
You think you can?

383
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:27,620
Sure, sir.

384
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,290
You can?

385
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,320
Salute!

386
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,820
Is it working?

387
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,930
Local transmissions are fine,

388
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:37,720
but not with headquarters.

389
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:39,770
Is the transmitter fine?

390
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:41,070
Yes.

391
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:47,280
By the way, is a French unit stationed nearby?

392
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,360
French army?

393
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:53,310
I got a transmission from Jacques... a French army corporal.

394
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,520
He said that he's in the army with his twin brother Paul.

395
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,870
What the hell are you talking about?

396
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,080
We're the only ones in this area.

397
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,720
No, he said his unit is stationed nearby and...

398
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,210
that he's dropping by sometime soon.

399
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,760
You speak French?

400
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,900
No, sir. Are you trying to mess with Lieutenant?

401
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,600
Get some more sleep.

402
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,380
Watch it, kid.

403
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,350
Come here, you son of a bitch!

404
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:34,280
What's with you? You asshole!

405
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:38,790
You were f***ing lying, right?

406
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,160
About what?

407
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,750
About the helmet shit!

408
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:46,590
"Jung-sook, wait for me"?

409
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,030
Yeah, it was yours, right?

410
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:52,090
Who the f*** told you about that?

411
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,800
About that? About what?

412
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,180
How did you know that bastard came to Vietnam?

413
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,360
Got no idea what you're talking about!

414
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,480
You sneaky shit.

415
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:06,860
How come you knew the helmet story?

416
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,960
What's with you?

417
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,120
I saw it myself!

418
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,580
Not more bullshit, you bitch!

419
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,930
No way, it's not possible.

420
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:22,040
Don't even think about messing with me! Spit it out!

421
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,460
Are you f***ing drunk?

422
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,420
I've had enough of this shit already!

423
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,630
Tell me the damn truth, come on!

424
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,810
That helmet belongs to...

425
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,770
one of missing bastards.

426
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:43,810
The ones we're here for.

427
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:49,490
How many more nights do we gotta get through, if we survive tonight?

428
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,610
Five nights, sir.

429
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:54,650
No sweat! We got shit to worry about!

430
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:58,620
Just 5 f***ing nights? I'm gonna make it for sure!

431
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:04,960
What's that?

432
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,730
Oh, the Ventures!

433
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,340
You fixed it?

434
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:20,910
Oh, baby, the Ventures! Come on!

435
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,900
We're f***ing dying!

436
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:49,740
Fuck!

437
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:10,210
Don't come any closer!

438
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:12,510
Don't come any closer! I don't...

439
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:15,400
No, No!

440
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:33,880
Damn! I still got the goose bumps.

441
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,340
What the f*** was that anyway?

442
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,860
You think I got a clue?

443
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,100
Shithead!

444
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,400
What're you doing?

445
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,750
I got a question.

446
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:56,920
What's that stench you always got?

447
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,440
What the f*** are you talking about?

448
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,420
If I stink, you smell like shit!

449
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:05,310
No,

450
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,760
something's going on!

451
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,650
What?

452
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:10,230
You're posted in the kitchen!

453
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:13,480
You've crossed the f***ing line, jerk.

454
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:16,440
You realize you're insulting he king of dangerous missions in Vietnam?

455
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,320
What a joke! Sergeant Cook?

456
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,040
What?

457
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,720
This is some news!

458
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,210
Everybody's gotta know.

459
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:28,220
If you do, I'll kill you, asshole.

460
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:31,200
Oh, you will? Alright, go ahead.

461
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:36,220
What? You scared?

462
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:37,200
Hey!

463
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,460
Just do me a favor.

464
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:44,050
What?

465
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,120
I'm begging you.

466
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:00,310
Don't come any closer!

467
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:04,510
I don't. No, No!

468
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:09,300
What is it you got there?

469
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,530
Damn, what's the problem?

470
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:17,400
I'm asking you! My daughter's photo, so what?

471
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,440
Let me see.

472
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,370
You're such an asshole.

473
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,850
She's the most beautiful thing in the world!

474
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:33,940
How is it that you have syphilis with such a cute kid back home?

475
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,190
You f***ing loser!

476
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:40,170
Watch your mouth, kid!

477
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:46,960
You'd have to have joined up earlier if you wanna talk shit.

478
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:53,000
If you say one word, you're dead!

479
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,140
I'm not f***ing joking, got it?

480
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:03,400
What's that?

481
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:07,790
Hey, Private JUNG!

482
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:10,190
Private JUNG!

483
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:13,890
That jerk doesn't show any respect!

484
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,190
<i>R-POINT: Day 2</i>

485
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:39,420
Kitchen duty, huh?

486
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:42,210
How come you know that shit?

487
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:49,700
We're sure lucky to have you around!

488
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:51,010
Yes, sir.

489
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:54,830
Once a cook, forever a cook.

490
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:58,100
Don't move, I'm gonna f***ing kill you.

491
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:01,800
Breakfast, please. I'm hungry.

492
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,880
Sir, Private JUNG's missing!

493
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:09,650
He was supposed to be on duty from 6:00, but...

494
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:11,990
You should've reported it earlier.

495
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:12,920
I'm doing now, sir!

496
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:13,820
Son of a bitch!

497
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,250
Fuck Sergeant JIN! To hell with him!

498
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,430
Fuck!

499
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:33,200
Just 2 weeks away from being discharged. I'm screwed!

500
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,880
Does it hurt?

501
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:45,100
Hey.

502
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,800
Go and take one more look around.

503
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:52,930
You mean alone?

504
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:55,620
I'm not in the mood right now.

505
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:59,180
I promise to hook you up with a hot chick back in Seoul.

506
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:10,750
You're not lying, right?

507
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:12,210
You got my f***ing word.

508
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:13,180
What's this?

509
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:15,010
I can trust you, right?

510
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:16,870
Don't worry about it, just do your job.

511
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:19,660
When I'm back in Seoul...

512
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:23,620
Leave it to the sex machine PARK.

513
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:27,370
You're gonna hook me up with a hot chick?

514
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:29,920
What the f***?

515
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:25,130
Viet congs are around.

516
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:26,730
We getting through to headquarters yet?

517
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:29,920
Sorry, sir, not yet.

518
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,500
Lieutenant!

519
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,520
Our mission is to find the missing men.

520
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:37,650
Keep that in mind.

521
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:10,350
Sergeant OH.

522
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:13,230
Yes, sir!

523
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:14,810
You're curious, aren't you?

524
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:17,290
Yes, sir?

525
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,050
I want to have a look at his face.

526
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:23,910
What, sir?

527
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,250
Set up a booby trap, kid.

528
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:27,980
Yes, sir.

529
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:39,220
Everything's f***ed up around here.

530
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:39,920
What is?

531
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:44,670
Just do your job, corpse cleaner.

532
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:57,890
Where was he from?

533
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,600
You mean... Private JUNG?

534
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:06,830
When you were out scouting with him...

535
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:11,260
Did he say anything?

536
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:16,630
Was he in our unit? I don't remember.

537
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:18,590
Which battalion did he belong to?

538
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:29,100
Hey, kid! Give this to the Lieutenant.

539
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:36,310
Poor kid! Whatever happens,

540
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:37,980
we're gonna get back alive!

541
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:39,160
What the f***?

542
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:42,380
Hey, you son of a bitch...

543
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:45,370
get me Captain PARK!

544
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:49,370
Make it quick, asshole!

545
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:52,370
Captain PARK here. Lieutenant CHOI, sir!

546
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:57,600
Are you f***ing with me?

547
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,700
What do you mean, sir?

548
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:01,880
Are you screwing this mission up?

549
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:07,010
Private JUNG's one of the missing men!

550
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:09,380
What?

551
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:12,730
Lieutenant, have you f***ing lost it?

552
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:16,370
Listen to me!

553
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:19,600
JUNG is one of the men you're there to look for!

554
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,670
I don't understand, sir.

555
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:24,940
You a f***ing idiot?

556
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:29,900
How many are in your unit now?

557
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:34,940
We got one down, and 9 left, sir.

558
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:39,120
You're f***ing out of your mind for sure.

559
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:44,250
You started the mission with 9, got it?

560
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:47,320
I have the mission file in front of me right now.

561
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,850
You were 9 to begin with!

562
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:50,020
You mean you picked up a ghost?

563
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:52,060
You're joking, right?

564
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,280
Do I sound like I'm f***ing joking?

565
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,250
Give me Sergeant JIN!

566
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:06,940
Are you listening to me, Lieutenant CHOI?

567
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:14,250
It's bizarre, but...

568
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,000
I don't remember his face.

569
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,340
I mean Private JUNG.

570
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:25,880
He was with us at the dock, right?

571
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:27,960
What?

572
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:34,740
He wasn't with us from the start...

573
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:41,820
but I remember he was there at the beach.

574
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:43,840
You dumbass, what're you talking about?

575
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:48,740
He was with us when we were taking the picture.

576
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,880
I don't remember seeing him at the dock.

577
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:58,720
Good, I wanna be in it too.

578
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,220
Okay, one more time!

579
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:03,700
You take the it.

580
00:54:07,550 --> 00:54:11,000
You know how to use the camera?

581
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,100
Wind it.

582
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:22,140
Enough already, I don't wanna hear any more!

583
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:37,380
Sergeant OH!

584
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:41,230
Did you get it yet?

585
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:43,730
Oh, for f***'s sake.

586
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:46,700
Be patient, I'll get it in a couple of days.

587
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,300
You take care of this.

588
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:52,420
Make sure you get it.

589
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:56,500
You know it's for my girl, Jung-sook.

590
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,840
I'm sick of your Jung-sook stories.

591
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:04,980
Aren't you going on a mission?

592
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:08,710
Hey, hurry up!

593
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:09,870
Take care.

594
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:33,490
See you soon!

595
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:38,580
Jung-sook, wait for me.

596
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:59,200
You think those assholes can handle it on their own, sir?

597
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,020
That's why I put you on the mission.

598
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:11,150
Do whatever it takes to close the case.

599
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:49,900
<i>R-POINT: Day 3</i>

600
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:50,660
You knew the whole time, didn't you!

601
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:55,150
Cut it out!

602
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:58,110
Where're you going?

603
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:00,800
Going to shit, goddammit!

604
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:47,070
A lot of French soldiers were exterminated here

605
00:59:47,890 --> 00:59:49,560
It all happened so fast.

606
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:09,220
I got a transmission from Jacques and...

607
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:11,790
Paul and Jacques rest in peace here.

608
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:16,500
he said his twin brother Paul is in the same army.

609
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:38,690
Don't touch it!

610
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:44,630
You like this camera, don't you?

611
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:46,460
You got any idea how much I paid for it?

612
01:00:46,930 --> 01:00:49,060
It cost me 4 months salary.

613
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:53,440
But I know it's not yours.

614
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:58,300
You got it without getting one drop of blood on your hands?

615
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:02,420
You motherf***er!

616
01:01:05,050 --> 01:01:06,060
Who are you?

617
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:16,370
He's on the edge.

618
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:51,470
Oh, no! You're dead, it can't be you!

619
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:21,530
I saw the photo.

620
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:26,400
Why didn't you tell them he was one of the missing...

621
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,100
I don't care whether he's f***ing missing or not.

622
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:32,260
Don't tell the men about it.

623
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:33,060
What?

624
01:02:35,410 --> 01:02:37,450
We need to bring them back alive.

625
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,210
It's the booby trap!

626
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:51,240
No...

627
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:52,260
Sergeant OH!

628
01:02:54,830 --> 01:02:59,630
Believe me, I didn't do it on purpose.

629
01:02:59,630 --> 01:03:01,890
He must have triggered the trap.

630
01:03:03,610 --> 01:03:06,300
Hang on, Sergeant OH!

631
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:08,760
What happened? Snap out of it!

632
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:12,220
Sergeant OH!

633
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:17,280
Come on!

634
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:22,320
Oh, please, don't kill me, I'm begging you.

635
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:26,010
I didn't mean to lie... Forgive me!

636
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:30,250
What're you doing?

637
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:33,870
Save me!

638
01:03:43,610 --> 01:03:46,280
I'm sorry!

639
01:04:28,930 --> 01:04:30,820
Something's going on.

640
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:34,330
There's gotta be something they're not telling us.

641
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:40,300
Ghosts!

642
01:04:45,310 --> 01:04:47,820
R-Point's f***ing haunted!

643
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:52,260
You f***ing idiot!

644
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,540
Fucking 'Ghosts'?

645
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:00,330
Look around! Open your eyes.

646
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:02,370
You see any f***ing ghosts?

647
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:05,880
You son of a bitch.

648
01:05:09,630 --> 01:05:11,520
All you got to do is...

649
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:15,310
find the missing radio operator's tags, got it?

650
01:05:20,210 --> 01:05:24,520
Any of you say a word about this ghost shit,

651
01:05:25,350 --> 01:05:27,500
and you'll be thrown in jail.

652
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:40,870
What're you gonna do, sir?

653
01:05:43,530 --> 01:05:45,000
Why don't we abort this mission?

654
01:05:45,530 --> 01:05:47,720
You think they'll believe this f***ing story?

655
01:05:54,510 --> 01:05:58,640
But we can't lie to our men forever.

656
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:03,380
All we need is to find any clue about the radio operator?

657
01:06:04,190 --> 01:06:06,520
Sorry, but it doesn't look like it's possible.

658
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:11,820
We'll scout this region from the spot we arrived.

659
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:13,310
Alright, then.

660
01:06:14,510 --> 01:06:19,080
We should split into two groups instead of one.

661
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:24,910
Looks like we're all on different pages,

662
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:27,920
some like playing ball and some don't.

663
01:06:44,350 --> 01:06:47,940
<i>R-POINT: Day 4</i>

664
01:06:59,310 --> 01:07:00,990
Fall in.

665
01:07:02,510 --> 01:07:06,710
Give a status report every 30 minutes.

666
01:07:07,410 --> 01:07:10,030
Once again, today we're covering R-5 and R-2.

667
01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:12,510
Under no circumstances

668
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:15,950
will you stray from your designated zones, got it?

669
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:17,620
Yes, sir.

670
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:22,600
Break into 2 teams.

671
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:24,400
Yes, sir!

672
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:30,790
You bugle player!

673
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:31,690
You!

674
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:32,730
Yes, sir!

675
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,450
And you!

676
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:35,500
Yes, sir.

677
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:36,320
Get in this line.

678
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,700
I want to be in your unit, sir!

679
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:45,490
I do, too, sir!

680
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:52,580
You f***ing pussies. You think this is a game?

681
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:56,760
I want one more asshole!

682
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:01,530
I'm ordering you, one more!

683
01:08:01,530 --> 01:08:02,840
Enough.

684
01:08:04,110 --> 01:08:05,370
Move out.

685
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:19,210
Isn't this the way we took before?

686
01:08:19,210 --> 01:08:20,420
Let's go to bamboo woods.

687
01:08:21,210 --> 01:08:22,110
Why, sir?

688
01:08:26,530 --> 01:08:27,600
I need to check something out.

689
01:08:56,830 --> 01:08:57,920
Sergeant JIN!

690
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:58,920
This is R-7, sir.

691
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,250
I know.

692
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:02,120
But Lieutenant told us not to stray from...

693
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:03,580
Shut up and come with me.

694
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:23,760
Sergeant JIN!

695
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,390
This must be the Lieutenant's.

696
01:09:43,890 --> 01:09:47,280
Search this area, now!

697
01:09:49,610 --> 01:09:51,160
What the hell are you doing?

698
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:01,900
You screwed us up, Lieutenant!

699
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:18,580
Corporal BYUN, look around over here.

700
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,060
We don't have time, move!

701
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:27,640
What we need are tags from one of the missing men.

702
01:10:36,430 --> 01:10:37,710
Sergeant!

703
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:59,210
Why isn't the woods coming up?

704
01:10:59,210 --> 01:11:01,540
We should've reached it by now.

705
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:05,420
What the hell's going on?

706
01:11:07,730 --> 01:11:08,820
What does it say?

707
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:15,820
Hey Cook, you can read it, right?

708
01:11:15,820 --> 01:11:17,830
You know?

709
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:21,150
"...can't go back"

710
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:28,730
Who can't go back?

711
01:11:30,510 --> 01:11:33,370
Lieutenant, is it true?

712
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:37,270
Does that thing really say "...can't go back"?

713
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:40,110
Mole three, come in. Mole one, do you copy?

714
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:41,060
Mole one, do you copy?

715
01:11:42,530 --> 01:11:44,120
Mole three, come in. Mole one, come in.

716
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:45,280
Mole three, come in. Mole one.

717
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:48,380
Mole three, Mole one, do you copy?

718
01:11:59,110 --> 01:12:00,900
Sergeant JIN, where're you going?

719
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:04,400
I'll be right back. Keep trying to get the reach the Lieutenant.

720
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:13,660
Lieutenant!

721
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:39,500
Aren't these... the Yankees we met?

722
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:45,320
What the hell's going on?

723
01:13:46,110 --> 01:13:48,380
Then we met their f***ing corpses?

724
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:51,910
Hey, Cook, tell me the truth.

725
01:13:51,910 --> 01:13:55,480
Are these the f***ers we met?

726
01:13:57,030 --> 01:14:01,920
Lieutenant, does that mean we're fighting against ghosts?

727
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,820
Get me Sergeant JIN on the line!

728
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:05,270
What're we gonna...?

729
01:14:05,270 --> 01:14:06,790
Send the transmission!

730
01:14:17,110 --> 01:14:19,300
Mole one, come in, Mole three.

01:14:19,610 --> 01:14:22,680
Mole three, do you copy?

732
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:26,080
It's dead.

733
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:29,520
Head back to base, on the double!

734
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:33,400
Sergeant JIN! Sergeant!

735
01:14:35,570 --> 01:14:37,100
Sergeant JIN!

736
01:14:44,610 --> 01:14:48,000
Where're you?

737
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:49,880
What the hell is this here for?

738
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:53,690
Which means...

739
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:56,840
He fell off here, damn!

740
01:14:58,010 --> 01:15:01,880
Private JUNG gets his head chopped off and now Sergeant OH's dead.

741
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:04,930
I'm sick of weird shit going on.
I'm not sticking around anymore.

742
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:21,820
Does all this mean that we can't get out of here, sir?

743
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:25,510
Tell me something.

744
01:15:25,510 --> 01:15:27,360
What's the first thing you wanna do when you get home?

745
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:28,440
I wanna...

746
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:36,330
Go on a picnic to the Royal Palace with my wife and daughter.

747
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:39,790
I'm telling you, it's going to happen.

748
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:09,590
Corporal JOH!

749
01:16:18,350 --> 01:16:20,400
It's the missing men!

750
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:17,410
Corporal JOH...

751
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:29,220
Who's there?

752
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:43,610
Sergeant OH?

753
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:47,260
Sergeant PARK?

754
01:17:49,890 --> 01:17:51,180
Sergeant PARK?

755
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:24,440
Donkey three, Butterfly, come in.

756
01:18:29,030 --> 01:18:32,090
Come in, Butterfly.

757
01:18:34,740 --> 01:18:39,710
We're dying, do you copy?

758
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,980
Butterfly, do you copy?

759
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,610
This is Donkey three.

760
01:18:56,330 --> 01:18:59,080
Come in, Butterfly.

761
01:19:02,030 --> 01:19:07,070
We're getting massacred.

762
01:19:11,910 --> 01:19:14,060
Butterfly, do you copy?

763
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:18,770
This is Donkey three!

764
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:24,600
Sergeant PARK?

765
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:25,380
What?

766
01:19:25,910 --> 01:19:28,830
Something's chasing us.

767
01:19:29,420 --> 01:19:30,210
What?

768
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:37,760
I told you to cut the bullshit out, asshole!

769
01:19:38,530 --> 01:19:39,770
Corporal LEE!

770
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:44,370
I'm scared...

771
01:19:45,790 --> 01:19:48,300
that OH is gonna kill me.

772
01:19:49,610 --> 01:19:51,900
He blames me, I know it!

773
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:56,910
Cut the crap, you son of a bitch!

774
01:19:57,330 --> 01:20:00,810
If you see something, just shoot.

775
01:20:19,510 --> 01:20:23,000
Cease fire!

776
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,530
You son of a bitch, it's us!

777
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:32,580
Lieutenant, are you all right?

778
01:20:42,230 --> 01:20:43,610
What the hell are you doing?

779
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:47,480
Hey Cook, are you all right?

780
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:50,380
Hang on!

781
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:52,680
Do something, son of a bitch!

782
01:20:53,710 --> 01:20:57,740
You think I can make it?

783
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:01,020
Yeah, don't worry.

784
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:04,910
Don't lie to my face, bitch!

785
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:11,580
No, you can't die.

786
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,130
Calm down.

787
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:17,460
I'm not going to die.

788
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:23,860
I won't die before I go on a picnic with my wife and daughter...

789
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:31,000
Get through this and I'll treat you as my own older brother.

790
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,690
Please don't die, I'll do whatever you tell me to.

791
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:39,020
You've finally grown up, kid.

792
01:21:44,430 --> 01:21:50,050
Whatever happens...

793
01:21:51,370 --> 01:21:53,370
make it back home.

794
01:21:58,210 --> 01:21:59,260
Sergeant MAH.

795
01:21:59,260 --> 01:22:04,120
Hey, Cook, get up!

796
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:08,940
Don't die on me!

797
01:22:17,730 --> 01:22:19,630
I saw this coming.

798
01:22:19,630 --> 01:22:22,580
You f***ing nut!

799
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:26,850
Sergeant JANG!

800
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:30,700
Get off!

801
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:32,440
Look, I was right!

802
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:35,090
The ghost was coming after me.

803
01:22:35,090 --> 01:22:37,800
What else was I supposed to do?

804
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:43,060
You killed him, and you're trying to say it was a ghost?

805
01:22:44,890 --> 01:22:46,940
Let me go!

806
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:50,100
I'm possessed by an evil spirit now!

807
01:23:13,220 --> 01:23:14,180
Move out.

808
01:23:29,030 --> 01:23:32,570
Mole three, come in, Butterfly.

809
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:35,120
Butterfly...

810
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:50,110
Give it up.

811
01:23:50,710 --> 01:23:56,450
Tomorrow the Americans will be here, so we can ask for help.

812
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:05,810
Come with me.

813
01:24:05,810 --> 01:24:08,410
Lieutenant!

814
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:11,180
It's a waste of time.

815
01:24:20,070 --> 01:24:21,380
What's this?

816
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:27,200
What's this?

817
01:24:32,910 --> 01:24:36,100
Get this shit downstairs.

818
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:45,140
Then who were... those Americans?

819
01:24:47,210 --> 01:24:48,680
They're not coming.

820
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,410
What do you mean?

821
01:24:53,410 --> 01:24:57,210
You knew it and didn't tell us the f***ing truth.

822
01:24:57,210 --> 01:24:58,880
Put your weapons down.

823
01:24:59,780 --> 01:25:02,970
You were in on it, weren't you? Kissing his ass!

824
01:25:04,110 --> 01:25:09,230
Hurry up and arrest these sons of bitches.

825
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:15,750
Get this equipment downstairs.

826
01:25:16,230 --> 01:25:17,500
Don't try to f*** with us!

827
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:19,630
What good is this junk?

828
01:25:21,410 --> 01:25:22,300
Put your weapon down.

829
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:29,180
If you come any closer, I'll fire.

830
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:37,310
If you wanna live, follow my orders.

831
01:25:42,330 --> 01:25:43,450
Hurry!

832
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:46,950
<i>R-POINT: Day 5</i>

833
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:19,720
Butterfly, come in, Mole three.

834
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:25,740
Do you copy? Come in, Mole three.

835
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:27,700
Lieutenant, it's working.

836
01:26:28,610 --> 01:26:31,200
Mole three, come in, Butterfly.

837
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:34,210
Urgent. Send backup right away.

838
01:26:34,210 --> 01:26:36,210
What situation?

839
01:26:36,510 --> 01:26:38,240
We need backup!

840
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:40,500
Send a chopper to R-Point right now!

841
01:26:41,110 --> 01:26:42,560
It's too dark.

842
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:46,300
05:50 am is the earliest we can get to you.

843
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:48,680
Cut the shit and send a f***ing chopper now!

844
01:26:49,420 --> 01:26:52,120
We're losing time.

845
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:55,700
Confirm, a chopper will be there by 05:50...

846
01:26:57,010 --> 01:27:00,640
Butterfly!

847
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:09,900
Do you copy? You son of a bitch!

848
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:13,580
You don't know what the hell is going on here!

849
01:27:20,530 --> 01:27:21,630
Listen carefully.

850
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:26,890
We'll make it out of here alive.

851
01:27:33,510 --> 01:27:34,970
To your stations!

852
01:27:47,570 --> 01:27:48,880
Open the goddamn door!

853
01:27:49,450 --> 01:27:52,090
It's Sergeant JIN, we should let him in!

854
01:27:52,730 --> 01:27:55,120
No, don't open it!

855
01:27:56,830 --> 01:27:58,200
No!

856
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:17,380
Sergeant, you're alive, sir!

857
01:28:37,410 --> 01:28:39,200
We shouldn't have come here.

858
01:28:41,110 --> 01:28:43,270
Your name and official rank.

859
01:28:44,810 --> 01:28:46,760
What're you doing, sir?

860
01:28:49,220 --> 01:28:52,180
You wanna play boss until the end, huh!

861
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:57,180
Your last chance, name and rank!

862
01:29:01,070 --> 01:29:05,000
Sergeant 1st Class JIN Chang-rok, 8335107.

863
01:29:14,050 --> 01:29:17,280
Are you f***ing happy now, bastard?

864
01:29:30,430 --> 01:29:31,760
Sergeant.

865
01:29:32,870 --> 01:29:35,960
Please help me... get back home alive.

866
01:29:38,230 --> 01:29:42,310
I was the one that found the tags...

867
01:29:44,010 --> 01:29:48,100
You promised to get me on the airplane home, so...

868
01:29:49,410 --> 01:29:51,460
You wanna live, huh?

869
01:29:52,410 --> 01:29:53,870
I don't wanna die,

870
01:29:54,820 --> 01:29:57,110
I wanna live.

871
01:29:57,110 --> 01:29:59,090
I wanna live.

872
01:29:59,910 --> 01:30:03,880
I'm too f***ing young to die!

873
01:30:05,410 --> 01:30:10,090
What did I do to deserve this shit?

874
01:30:21,010 --> 01:30:22,680
Step away from him!

875
01:30:50,950 --> 01:30:52,670
Put your weapons down.

876
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:44,490
Corporal BYUN!

877
01:31:46,020 --> 01:31:47,390
Lower your weapon.

878
01:32:03,010 --> 01:32:07,450
Mole three, come in, Butterfly.

879
01:32:07,450 --> 01:32:08,910
Butterfly, do you copy?

880
01:32:08,910 --> 01:32:12,480
Give it up! The f***ing thing's gone!

881
01:32:13,710 --> 01:32:16,090
The chopper's on its way.

882
01:32:16,730 --> 01:32:18,390
It's coming for sure.

883
01:32:34,610 --> 01:32:37,770
Corporal LEE, your name and rank!

884
01:32:41,990 --> 01:32:44,370
I'm ordering you!

885
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:51,000
Corporal LEE Jae-pil, 8327602.

886
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:53,420
And you!

887
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:58,090
Corporal JOH Byung-hoon, 8327603.

888
01:33:07,010 --> 01:33:07,850
Sergeant JANG!

889
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:15,110
Wake up, come on!

890
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:22,360
Sergeant JANG Young-soo, 8123018.

891
01:34:18,210 --> 01:34:20,480
They're coming.

892
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:27,970
They're coming, I told you!

893
01:34:27,970 --> 01:34:30,180
Corporal BUYN, snap out of it!

894
01:34:30,820 --> 01:34:32,600
Name and rank.

895
01:34:36,030 --> 01:34:40,940
Lieutenant, they're coming.

896
01:34:42,540 --> 01:34:46,820
I'm asking you for the last time.

897
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:56,960
Get down!

898
01:35:40,630 --> 01:35:43,370
Sergeant JANG, hang on!

899
01:35:45,330 --> 01:35:46,570
My eyes...

900
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:49,580
l can't see.

901
01:35:54,710 --> 01:35:56,040
Just hang on.

902
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:06,800
Corporal LEE!

903
01:36:08,350 --> 01:36:09,610
Pull yourself together!

904
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:17,230
Why are they doing this to us?

905
01:36:17,230 --> 01:36:20,170
What did we do wrong?

906
01:36:21,630 --> 01:36:24,540
We don't f***ing deserve this!

907
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:29,300
We haven't done anything

908
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:30,990
to deserve this shit!

909
01:36:36,620 --> 01:36:37,680
Do you really...

910
01:36:39,740 --> 01:36:40,810
mean it?

911
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:48,540
Oh, no!

912
01:37:28,540 --> 01:37:29,740
Lieutenant!

913
01:37:31,110 --> 01:37:35,280
Where are you, sir?

914
01:37:36,610 --> 01:37:38,830
Lieutenant!

915
01:37:39,510 --> 01:37:43,660
I lost my tags.

916
01:37:45,060 --> 01:37:48,810
Without it, my dead body can't be sent home.

917
01:37:48,810 --> 01:37:52,910
Even my ashes won't make it home.

918
01:37:52,910 --> 01:37:54,400
Just get a hold of yourself!

919
01:37:56,340 --> 01:37:57,820
Just stay calm!

920
01:37:57,820 --> 01:37:59,260
I lost my tags.

921
01:37:59,260 --> 01:38:01,150
You're gonna make it.

922
01:38:02,350 --> 01:38:03,610
Listen to me,

923
01:38:04,300 --> 01:38:06,170
we're going to make it back alive.

924
01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:10,190
You're just injured. You'll be fine.

925
01:38:10,900 --> 01:38:12,030
Why aren't you afraid?

926
01:38:13,100 --> 01:38:14,360
Just believe me.

927
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:18,060
We'll get back alive, understand?

928
01:40:14,540 --> 01:40:15,940
Lieutenant...

929
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:19,200
Where are you?

930
01:40:20,210 --> 01:40:21,700
Sergeant JANG, take your rifle.

931
01:40:23,910 --> 01:40:24,740
Take your weapon!

932
01:40:42,530 --> 01:40:43,680
Aim it to the left.

933
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:46,970
More to the left.

934
01:41:06,820 --> 01:41:07,650
Fire!

935
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,590
Fire!

936
01:41:37,020 --> 01:41:37,650
Sir?

937
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:43,130
What's going on?

938
01:41:43,770 --> 01:41:45,410
You're there, right?

939
01:41:47,430 --> 01:41:48,940
Lieutenant!

940
01:41:51,530 --> 01:41:54,010
Answer me, are you there?

941
01:41:58,310 --> 01:42:01,360
Lieutenant, you're still there, right?

942
01:42:06,050 --> 01:42:08,720
Oh, say something, please.

943
01:42:11,420 --> 01:42:16,010
Lieutenant, answer me.

944
01:42:24,930 --> 01:42:28,200
You're there, aren't you?

945
01:42:30,010 --> 01:42:33,530
You're fooling around, right, sir?

946
01:42:45,930 --> 01:42:48,670
I need to go back home with the money I earned.

947
01:42:50,630 --> 01:42:54,730
My mom's dying to see me!

948
01:42:58,730 --> 01:43:02,000
But I'm a little scared.

949
01:43:04,110 --> 01:43:06,590
I'm afraid my mom won't recognize me

950
01:43:08,410 --> 01:43:09,470
because

951
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:12,830
I've changed so much.

952
01:43:19,090 --> 01:43:23,120
Because I can't... see anything now.

953
01:43:25,830 --> 01:43:30,280
My home's too far away.

954
01:43:38,110 --> 01:43:40,080
Hey, Cook,

955
01:43:41,120 --> 01:43:43,850
take your angels to the Royal Palace!

956
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:50,780
LEE, BYUN and JOH!

957
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:57,930
You bastards, stop playing tricks on me!

958
01:44:00,630 --> 01:44:01,580
Damn,

959
01:44:03,130 --> 01:44:04,940
it's time to go home, right?

960
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:11,160
We haven't spotted anyone, except an injured soldier,

961
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:14,090
but he's completely lost it.

962
01:44:16,010 --> 01:44:18,200
We've searched R-Point,

963
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:20,830
but the other 8 haven't been found.

964
01:44:21,900 --> 01:44:26,090
We're heading back, with the only survivor. Over!

965
01:44:41,640 --> 01:44:48,200
Mole three, come in, Butterfly.

966
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:51,180
Come in, Butterfly, do you copy?

967
01:44:52,610 --> 01:44:56,060
Butterfly, please, come in.
