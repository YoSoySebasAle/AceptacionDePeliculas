1
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,176
JOAQUINITO!

2
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:14,314
DOWN! DOWN!
ON THE GROUND!

3
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,183
EVERYBODY OFF THAT PLATFORM.

4
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:17,585
LET'S GO.

5
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:19,720
HERE, CHICK, CHICK,
CHICK, CHICK.

6
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,956
HERE, CHICK, CHICK,
CHICK, CHICK.

7
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,762
SHUT YER YAP AND SHUFFLE
THEM FEET, AMIGO!

8
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:30,230
WE'RE NOT FALLING
FOR THAT DODGE.

9
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:38,539
LITTLE MONKEY RUN RIGHT IN HERE.
I SEEN HIM.

10
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:41,375
SPREAD OUT AND KEEP LOW.
WE'LL FLUSH HIM OUT!

11
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,343
TRY NOT TO SHOOT US,
GREENHORN.

12
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,948
THERE HE IS!
GET ON HIM, BOY!

13
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:57,224
THOUGHT I HAD HIM.
SHEE-IT.

14
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:59,259
Y'ALL FELLAS MIND STANDING GUARD A MINUTE?

15
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:00,761
I GOT TO IRRIGATE.

16
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:03,263
I DON'T WANT 'EM TO CATCH ME WITH MY PANTS DOWN.

17
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,700
THEM GOOGOOS'RE ALL
HALFWAY TO DAGUPAN BY NOW.

18
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,370
GODDAMN.
O LORD, HAVE MERCY.

19
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,105
AAAAH!

20
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:15,075
AAAH! AAAAH!

21
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:16,309
SOMEBODY HIT?

22
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,746
NO, IT'S JUST SHANKER
DRAINING THE SNAKE.

23
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:21,949
I'M SICK, SERGEANT.
I GOTTA GO BACK.

24
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:23,016
IT BURNS ME.

25
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:26,720
OL' DEADEYE HERE
MISSED ONE.

26
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,157
I EXPECT HE'LL GET
ANOTHER CHANCE.

27
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:58,686
I NEED TO KNOW
WHO THE HEAD MAN IS.

28
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,590
BUSCA LA CABEZA.

29
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:25,112
THIS BUNCH
LOOK ALMOST WHITE.

30
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:29,583
TIME TO JOIN THE PARTY, FELLAS.

31
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,152
VAMOOSE.

32
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:33,954
ARE YOU WITH US, SHANKER?

33
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,189
I'M DYIN' HERE, SARGE.

34
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,926
SERVES YOU RIGHT.

35
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:07,855
THE CABEZA DE BARRIO...
IS THAT ONE.

36
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:10,758
THESE HERE WERE LOCKED UP OUT BACK, LIEUTENANT.

37
00:08:10,758 --> 00:08:13,627
WE HAVE BEEN PRISONERS
OF THE INSURRECTOS...

38
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:16,296
AND OF THESE POOR COWARDS
AND SINNERS.

39
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:17,497
YOU SPEAK ENGLISH.

40
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,600
I COMPREHEND
THIS LANGUAGE, YES.

41
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,102
THE CABEZA IS THIS ONE.

42
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:25,005
YOU.

43
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:27,641
ON YOUR FEET.

44
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:33,614
WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

45
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:36,717
SU NOMBRE.

46
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,729
WHERE ARE
ALL THE YOUNG MEN?

47
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:25,165
THEY HAVE GONE AWAY TO FIGHT IN THIS UNHOLY REBELLION.

48
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:27,635
I'M ASKING HIM.
I KNOW THIS ONE.

49
00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:30,270
HE IS A LIAR.
ASK HIM.

50
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,105
AS YOU WISH.

51
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:44,852
HE SAYS THEY ARE HIDING.
WHERE?

52
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,424
HE WON'T TALK.

53
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,427
HIS OWN BROTHER IS THE JEFE OF THE INSURRECTOS.

54
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,263
THEY HAVE BEEN
KEEPING US PRISONERS

55
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,531
SINCE THE SURRENDER
IN BATANGAS.

56
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,634
TELL HIM...

57
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:03,671
THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHERE THE INSURRECTOS ARE.

58
00:10:03,671 --> 00:10:05,238
IF THEY DON'T SURRENDER,

59
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:07,407
WE WILL HUNT THEM DOWN
AND KILL THEM.

60
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:10,077
YOU ARE CAPABLE OF THIS?

61
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:11,078
TELL HIM.

62
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:12,372
HIS NAME IS
RAFAEL DACANAY,

63
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:15,042
AND HE HAS BEEN
CABEZA DE BARRIO HERE,

64
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:17,210
AS WAS HIS FATHER
BEFORE HIM,

65
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,979
FOR TEN YEARS.

66
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:21,815
IT IS HE WHO COLLECTS THE TAX
FOR THE GOVERNMENT.

67
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:23,583
GOOD DUTY
IF YOU CAN GET IT.

68
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,085
AND WHAT HE IS
NOT ABLE TO COLLECT,

69
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:27,420
HE MUST PAY
FROM HIS OWN POCKET.

70
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,655
NOT SO GOOD.

71
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:30,323
BRASS ON THE HORIZON,
LIEUTENANT.

72
00:11:34,594 --> 00:11:37,164
EVERYTHING LOCKED DOWN HERE, LIEUTENANT?
YES, SIR.

73
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:39,699
WE TOOK THE BARRIO
WITH NO RESISTANCE--

74
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,568
ONLY A COUPLE OF RUNAWAYS.

75
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:45,038
PICK TEN YOU CAN TRUST
AND WORK OUT THE BILLETING.

76
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,306
SIR?

77
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:48,308
CAN'T HAVE THE MONKEYS
SNEAKING IN BEHIND US

78
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:50,944
WHILE WE'RE CHASING AGUINALDO
UP THE ISLAND.

79
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:52,813
I NEED A GARRISON HERE.

80
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:54,547
MY BOYS ARE HOT TO GO,
COLONEL.

81
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,684
STAYING HERE WOULD BE--
I NEED A GARRISON.

82
00:11:57,684 --> 00:11:59,352
YES, SIR.

83
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:06,093
HELL, FOR ALL I KNOW,
OLD AGGY'S HIDING RIGHT IN THIS VILLAGE.

84
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:09,496
YOU COULD SMOKE HIM OUT
AND END THE WAR.

85
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:14,001
LORD KNOWS I CAN'T TELL
ONE FROM THE OTHER.

86
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:15,468
MAY I THANK YOU,
COLONEL,

87
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:18,538
THAT YOU DELIVER US
FROM CAPTIVITY.

88
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:21,208
THIS IS PADRE HIDALGO.

89
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,944
THE LOCAL INSURRECTOS
HAD HIM CAGED UP IN THE BODEGA

90
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:26,146
ALONG WITH A COUPLE OF DONS
THEY CAUGHT.

91
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:28,982
WE'LL GET YOU BACK TO MANILA
AS SOON AS WE CAN, PADRE.

92
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:30,918
THESE ARE MY CHILDREN.

93
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:33,486
THEIR SOULS ARE IN MY CARE.

94
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,455
I CANNOT LEAVE THIS PLACE.

95
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:40,760
YOU GOT YOURSELF
AN INTERPRETER, LIEUTENANT.

96
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,895
ZUÑIGA!

97
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,834
YOU VAMOS WITH US.

98
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:48,435
YOU HOLD ONTO A SIGNALIST
AND SOME COOLIES

99
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:51,104
TO HANG THE WIRE TOMORROW,
AND YOU KEEP IT SINGIN'.

100
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:54,174
GET THESE PEOPLE UP OUT OF THE DIRT,
FOR GOD'S SAKE.

101
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:57,077
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE WINNING
THEIR HEARTS AND MINDS!

102
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:00,247
YES, SIR!

103
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,752
WHATLEY AND NINE
I CAN TRUST, SERGEANT.

104
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:09,022
WHATLEY, THOMAS...

105
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:12,659
CASEY, DORTMUNDER...

106
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:15,028
LYNCH, PEDERSON,

107
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:18,631
FITZSIMMONS, ANDREWS,

108
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,600
SHANKER AND McBRIDE--

109
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,535
YOU WILL REMAIN HERE ON GUARD!

110
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:26,907
THE REST OF YOU FALL OUT
AND FORM UP BEHIND THE COLONEL.

111
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:29,176
ON THE DOUBLE!
WHOSE SHACK IS THAT?

112
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:32,012
IT BELONGS TO
THIS SAME MAN.

113
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:33,746
IN THAT CASE, TELL HIM
HE'S GOT FIVE MINUTES

114
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,215
TO REMOVE
HIS PERSONAL ITEMS.

115
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:37,084
THAT'LL BE MY HEADQUARTERS.

116
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:40,187
TELL HIM WE'RE STAYING HERE TO PROTECT
HIS VILLAGE FROM THE LADRONES.

117
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:41,955
TELL HIM HE'S STILL HEAD MAN,

118
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:44,824
WHICH MEANS IF THERE'S TROUBLE,
IT'S HIS HEAD.

119
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:48,328
HOLD THAT FIRE!

120
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:51,231
DO NOT SHOOT!
DO NOT SHOOT!

121
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:04,844
IT IS THE TIME OF THE ANGELUS.

122
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,180
THIS IS HIS DUTY.

123
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:19,927
PRAYERS.

124
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:22,829
EVERY DAY AT THE SIX.
IT IS OUR CUSTOM.

125
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:27,000
HAVE SOMEBODY CLIMB UP THERE AND
YANK THE CLAPPER OUT OF THAT BELL.

126
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,401
LYNCH.

127
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:50,943
WHEN THE SUN IS UP,

128
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,313
YOUR GOOGOO JUST LAYS AROUND

129
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:56,249
EATING BANANAS
AND WATCHING CHICKEN FIGHTS.

130
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,017
BUT THE MINUTE IT GETS DARK,

131
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,220
HE LIKES TO CREEP UP
THROUGH THE JUNGLE

132
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,122
WITH THAT BOLO HE CARRIES,

133
00:17:02,122 --> 00:17:04,224
AND THEN CHOP-CHOP!

134
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:05,958
WE LOST MORE GOOD AMERICANS
THAT WAY

135
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,927
THAN WE EVER DONE
IN BATTLE.

136
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:10,630
DEADEYE'S RELIEVING YOU,
PRIVATE. GET SOME SLEEP.

137
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:14,467
I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE OVER HERE
KILLING SPANIARDS.

138
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:16,403
JUST KILL SOME
IN YOUR DREAMS.

139
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:21,108
CHANGE YOUR POSITION
EVERY NOW AND THEN.

140
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:25,078
THEY CAN'T SHOOT FOR SHIT,
BUT NO SENSE MAKING AND EASY TARGET.

141
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:26,779
RIGHT.

142
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,281
FOUR HOURS, SON.

143
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:30,717
DON'T LET US DOWN.

144
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:40,793
POSTED?
FOUR CORNERS.

145
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:44,097
I TOLD THE REST OF THE BOYS
TO SLEEP WITH THEIR BOOTS ON

146
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:45,465
JUST IN CASE.

147
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:48,801
MY FEET HAVEN'T BEEN DRY
SINCE CALOOCAN.

148
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,537
GRAB A SPOT.

149
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:53,573
EASY DUTY HERE.

150
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,342
MIGHT BE.

151
00:17:55,342 --> 00:17:58,645
PLAY CARDS...

152
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:00,180
AND SWAT FLIES.

153
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:04,184
YOU WERE OUT WEST.

154
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:07,687
REGULAR ARMY.
FIFTEEN YEARS.

155
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:10,857
DRAGGIN' REDSKINS
BACK TO THE RESERVATION.

156
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:14,561
YOU?

157
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:17,764
BEFORE I VOLUNTEERED
FOR THIS MESS,

158
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:20,133
I BUILT HOUSES...

159
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:21,768
GREAT, BIG ONES.

160
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,236
LIEUTENANT.

161
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,973
THAT PADRE...

162
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:29,876
HE'S GOT HIS OWN DEAL
RUNNIN' HERE.

163
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:33,045
I WOULDN'T TRUST HIM.

164
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:36,849
RELIGION IS A CIVILIZING INFLUENCE, SERGEANT.

165
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,386
AND IF HE CAN HELP
KEEP A LEASH ON THESE PEOPLE,

166
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:43,055
HE'S WELCOME TO THEIR SOULS.
YES, SIR.

167
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:45,558
AND I DON'T TRUST HIM.

168
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:31,358
TO YOUR POSTS!

169
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,562
DON'T SHOOT
TILL YOU SEE SOMETHING!

170
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:49,976
THEY COMIN'?

171
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:51,110
I DON'T KNOW.

172
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,613
I THOUGHT THERE WAS
SOMETHING OUT THERE.

173
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:59,986
WELL, THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING
OUT THERE, DAMNIT.

174
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:02,254
WHAT DO WE DO,
SARGE?

175
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:04,924
WE WAIT TILL
THE SUN COMES UP.

176
00:22:07,527 --> 00:22:10,430
I'LL LET THE OTHERS KNOW.

177
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:17,670
THERE DAMN WELL BETTER BE
A DEAD GOOGOO OUT THERE, BOY.

178
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:21,808
ATTAGO, DEADEYE.

179
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:25,512
AT LEAST YOUR AIM
IS GETTING BETTER.

180
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:47,434
I ATTENDED SEMINARY
IN VALLADOLID,

181
00:22:47,434 --> 00:22:50,169
BUT I WAS BORN IN TOLEDO.
THE ALHAMBRA.

182
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:51,704
YOU HAVE BEEN THERE?

183
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:54,841
NO. I STUDIED THE BUILDING.

184
00:22:54,841 --> 00:22:57,444
SO YOU DECIDED
TO BE A MISSIONARY.

185
00:22:57,444 --> 00:23:00,146
THE FILIPINAS ARE
A COLONY OF SPAIN--

186
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:01,681
"WERE."

187
00:23:01,681 --> 00:23:04,350
WERE A COLONY OF SPAIN.

188
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,986
SERVICE HERE IS NOT ONLY
A RELIGIOUS DUTY,

189
00:23:06,986 --> 00:23:08,287
BUT A PATRIOTIC ONE.

190
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:10,322
WE ARE SOLDIERS OF GOD.

191
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:11,858
THE PEOPLE HERE LISTEN TO YOU?

192
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:16,195
THEY LISTEN, BUT THEY
DO NOT ALWAYS OBEY.

193
00:23:16,195 --> 00:23:18,064
I'M GOING TO NEED YOUR HELP.

194
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:19,966
WHICH I OFFER FREELY

195
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:23,002
IN ANY MATTER THAT DOES ENDANGER
THE MORALS OF MY FILIGRESES.

196
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:26,072
I DON'T THINK THAT'S
GOING TO BE A PROBLEM.

197
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:28,040
YOU'RE NOT A CATHOLIC.

198
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,443
NO.

199
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:33,613
I MUST WARN YOU
THAT THE MORAL PATH

200
00:23:33,613 --> 00:23:36,449
IS NOT ALWAYS
THE MOST OBVIOUS.

201
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:52,599
CAN YOU WALK?

202
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,934
IF IT GETS ME
TO THE CLAP SHACK,

203
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,136
I'LL CRAWL BACK
TO MANILA.

204
00:23:57,136 --> 00:24:00,573
I'M PUTTING THESE PEOPLE
IN YOUR CARE.

205
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:02,809
NO SWEAT, SARGE.

206
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:07,947
ALL RIGHT, YOU DAGOES--

207
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,582
VAMOOSE!

208
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,866
THERE ARE TWO HARVESTS.

209
00:24:59,866 --> 00:25:02,602
ONLY DURING JULY AND AUGUST
DOES THE LAND REST.

210
00:25:02,602 --> 00:25:05,071
AND THE VILLAGERS
OWN THE LAND TOGETHER?

211
00:25:05,071 --> 00:25:07,373
HE OWNS THIS LAND,
AND THAT.

212
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:09,308
THE PEOPLE ARE KASAMAS--

213
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:12,579
THEY WORK FOR A PORTION
OF WHAT THEY HARVEST.

214
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:16,315
SO AMIGO HERE HAS GOT
THE WHOLE DEAL SEWED UP.

215
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:17,650
THE LANDS BEYOND,

216
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,619
AND MANY MORE YOU CANNOT SEE,
ARE MINE.

217
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:23,556
WHEN I AM PRISONER, THE PEOPLE,
THEY DO NOT CARE FOR THEM.

218
00:25:23,556 --> 00:25:25,324
BUT IF THEY'RE WORKING
FOR SHARES...

219
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:26,726
THIS IS THE POLO--

220
00:25:26,726 --> 00:25:29,195
A WORK THAT IS A DUTY
OVERSEEN BY THE CHURCH

221
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:30,597
AND THE GUARDIA CIVIL.

222
00:25:30,597 --> 00:25:32,665
AND YOU RAKE IN ALL THE PROFITS.
I'VE SEEN ENOUGH.

223
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:36,102
TELL HIM THE PEOPLE CAN DO FOR THE CROP JUST LIKE ALWAYS,

224
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:38,537
ONLY THAT DIKE THERE,
THAT'S THE DEAD LINE.

225
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:42,341
ANYONE STEPS PAST THAT WITHOUT PERMISSION,
WE SHOOT THEM.

226
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:45,745
AND TELL HIM FROM NOW ON
HE CAN WORK HIS OWN DAMN FIELDS

227
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:47,647
WITH EVERYONE ELSE.

228
00:25:47,647 --> 00:25:50,082
IT WOULD PLEASE ME
TO DO THIS.

229
00:26:18,344 --> 00:26:19,846
ALL RIGHT! HUSTLE, BOYS!

230
00:26:19,846 --> 00:26:21,914

00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,583

234
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:30,923
SO'S YOU CAN INFECT THE REST OF THE WHORES IN SAMPALOC.

235
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,825
THAT'S A NICE
LITTLE CREW YOU GOT.

236
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:34,426
YEAH, THAT'S, UM,
THAT'S CHOP-CHOP,

237
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,996
AND THE SOURPUSS THERE

238
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:38,831
THAT'S, UM, "SKINNY,"

239
00:26:38,831 --> 00:26:40,800
AND THAT ONE THERE,
THAT'S "MOON."

240
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,468
THERE'S A GANG HANGING WIRE
UP FROM SANTA ANA

241
00:26:42,468 --> 00:26:45,104

OR YOU JUST GOLDBRICKING?

244
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:51,043

CAPITAN.

275
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:52,738
CAPITAN...

276
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:35,681
YOUR FILIPINO...

277
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:40,286
IS LIKE A MIX BETWEEN
A MEXICAN AND A CHINAMAN.

278
00:33:40,286 --> 00:33:42,554
THE MISSING LINK.
A STUNTED RACE.

279
00:33:42,554 --> 00:33:45,357
HELL, EVEN THEIR HORSES
ARE PUNY.

280
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,959
WE MISSED OUT ON
THEM CUBAN WOMEN.

281
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,561
WHORES ARE WHORES.

282
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:51,497
NOT THE WHORES--

283
00:33:51,497 --> 00:33:54,300
THEM TOBACCO-ROLLING
SEÑORITAS,

284
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,635
THE ONES THEY SHOW
ON THE CIGAR BOXES.

285
00:33:56,635 --> 00:33:58,970
YOU'RE AS GREEN
AS DEADEYE HERE.

286
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:02,374
MAYBE I OUGHTA GIVE THESE GOOGOO DOLLS A TUMBLE.

287
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,476
WIND UP LIKE SHANKER.

288
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:06,745
SHANKER DIPPED IT IN
THE WRONG PUDDLE IS ALL.

289
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:10,116
CAN'T GO PICKING YOUR PUTAS
WHEN YOU'RE BLIND DRUNK.

290
00:34:10,116 --> 00:34:12,084
SOMEBODY BLIND DRUNK?

291
00:34:12,084 --> 00:34:13,585
BEENO.
YOU'RE SHITTIN' ME.

292
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:15,954
UNH-UNH. SOME OLD-TIMER
IN THE VILLE HERE MAKES IT.

293
00:34:15,954 --> 00:34:18,257
I THINK IT'S FROM COCONUT PALMS.
I DON'T CARE...

294
00:34:18,257 --> 00:34:20,092
IF IT'S FROM
BUFFALO PISS.

295
00:34:20,092 --> 00:34:21,527
HAND IT OVER.

296
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,849
WE'RE ON AN OPEN CIRCUIT
HERE IN THE FIELD.

297
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:39,885
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO LOOP US
INTO THE MAIN LINES,

298
00:38:39,885 --> 00:38:41,587
SO EVERYTHING THAT
WE SEND OR RECEIVE

299
00:38:41,587 --> 00:38:43,789
WILL BE RELAYED ON FROM
THE STATION AT SANTA ANA.

300
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:46,925
FROM NOW ON,
YOU SLEEP NEXT TO THIS RIG.

00:38:48,226 --> 00:38:49,961
IT MAKES A SOUND.

303
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:50,896
ENOUGH TO WAKE YOU?

304
00:38:50,896 --> 00:38:53,064
LIKE A BUCKET
OF COLD WATER.

305
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:29,160
DUTCH! YOU OUT THERE?

306
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,629
YEAH, YEAH!

307
00:40:30,629 --> 00:40:32,498
I GOT THE
QUICK-STEP AGAIN.

308
00:40:32,498 --> 00:40:35,100
OH, BOY,
WHEN IT HITS YOU...

309
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,302
I'M HERE TO RELIEVE YOU.

310
00:40:37,302 --> 00:40:39,671
HE STILL OUT THERE?

311
00:40:42,708 --> 00:40:45,243
WHO?
THE AMIGO.

312
00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:47,579
WITH THE WATER BUFFALO.

313
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:51,717
HOW LONG YOU BEEN IN THERE?

314
00:41:58,316 --> 00:42:00,185
ANYTHING?

315
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:02,754
I TESTED IT LAST NIGHT.

316
00:42:02,754 --> 00:42:05,591
BUT YOU'RE GETTING
NOTHING BACK FROM SANTA ANA?

317
00:42:05,591 --> 00:42:07,726
LINE MUST BE DOWN SOMEWHERE.

318
00:44:06,678 --> 00:44:08,413
WHOO!

319
00:44:26,798 --> 00:44:28,433
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
THE PRINCIPLE.

320
00:44:28,433 --> 00:44:30,201
WELL, YOU'VE SEEN OUR BATTERY, RIGHT? YEAH.

321
00:44:30,201 --> 00:44:33,138
THERE'S COPPER SULFATE SOLUTION
ON THE BOTTOM,

322
00:44:33,138 --> 00:44:35,173
AND ZINC SULFATE SOLUTION ON THE TOP-- WHOA.
WHOA.

323
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:36,842
I SAID I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT,

324
00:44:36,842 --> 00:44:38,476
NOT THAT I WANT TO
UNDERSTAND IT.

325
00:44:38,476 --> 00:44:40,045
DOWN!

326
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,883
TWO AT A TIME,
IN RUSHES.

327
00:44:44,883 --> 00:44:46,985
FIND YOURSELF
SOME COVER.

328
00:45:00,131 --> 00:45:02,067
OH, GOD.

329
00:45:15,246 --> 00:45:17,048
HEY.

330
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:20,485
DON'T TELL NOBODY ABOUT THAT AMIGO SLIPPIN' OFF MY WATCH.

331
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,416
FOUND 'EM TWO MILES
DOWN THE SOUTH ROAD.

332
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:54,752
GOT THE LINE BACK UP,
BUT THEY CAN CUT IT ANYTIME THEY WANT.

333
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:57,455
MURDERERS.

334
00:45:57,455 --> 00:46:00,191
ASK HIM WHAT
HE KNOWS ABOUT THIS.

335
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:07,532
WHAT HE SAYING?
HE'S A LIAR.

336
00:46:07,532 --> 00:46:09,000
WHAT'S HE SAYING?!

337
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,370
HE SAYS HE HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS.

338
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:18,810
TELL HIM HE CAN HELP
BURY THIS BUNCH.

339
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:20,611
AND YOU CAN DO THE CEREMONY.

340
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,180
THESE MEN
WERE HEATHENS.

341
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:23,648
WHAT CAN I DO FOR THEM?

342
00:46:23,648 --> 00:46:24,916
MAKE SOMETHING UP.

343
00:46:24,916 --> 00:46:27,152
WHATLEY!
YES, SIR!

344
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:45,837
NEXT DAMN HOLE I DIG...

345
00:46:45,837 --> 00:46:48,139
IS GONNA BE YOURS, AMIGO.

346

347
00:47:34,419 --> 00:47:36,554
LONG MESSAGE.

348
00:47:36,554 --> 00:47:38,689
MILITARY PARLANCE, SIR.

349
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,291
WHAT'S THE GIST OF IT?

350
00:47:40,291 --> 00:47:42,961
THEY WANT US
TO HOLD THE FORT.

351
00:48:58,736 --> 00:49:01,039
THEY'RE ALL AROUND US.

352
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:02,307
FALL BACK!

353
00:49:03,508 --> 00:49:04,675
FALL BACK!

354
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:08,079
EVERYBODY FALL BACK!

355
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:17,388
HOLD FIRE!

356
00:49:17,388 --> 00:49:20,791
HOLD FIRE TILL
YOU SEE A FACE!

357
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,227
TAKE COUNT.

358
00:49:22,227 --> 00:49:24,062
DORTMUNDER!
YO!

359
00:49:24,062 --> 00:49:25,596
LYNCH!
YO.

360
00:49:25,596 --> 00:49:27,698
PEDERSON!
YO!

361
00:50:20,651 --> 00:50:22,853
CAUGHT ONE IN THE BACK.

362
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,522
ONE OF OURS?

363
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:29,026
THAT'S A MAUSER WOUND.
OURS'D MAKE A BIGGER HOLE.

364
00:50:44,609 --> 00:50:46,010
IS IT SAFE?

365
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:48,746
WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE TO YOU?

366
00:50:51,949 --> 00:50:55,153
HER NAME WAS
ESPERANZA BANAAG.

367
00:50:55,153 --> 00:50:58,423
HER FATHER WAS WITH
THE INSURRECTOS.

368
00:50:58,423 --> 00:51:02,093
HE WAS KILLED BY OUR GUARDIA
FOUR YEARS AGO.

369
00:54:34,739 --> 00:54:36,474
NICE DIGS.

370
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:44,782
EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT CHASING
THE DIRTY DAGOES DOWN IN CUBA,

371
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:47,918
SO ME AND MY BUDDY TOM
SIGNED UP,

372
00:54:47,918 --> 00:54:51,722
ONLY HE GOT SO SICK IN CAMP
BACK IN SAN FRANCISCO

373
00:54:51,722 --> 00:54:55,059
THEY DIDN'T EVEN
LET HIM ON THE BOAT.

374
00:54:55,059 --> 00:54:57,795
HELL, THE TRIP OVER HERE
WOULD HAVE KILT HIM.

375
00:54:59,364 --> 00:55:01,866
DOWN IN THE HOLD...

376
00:55:01,866 --> 00:55:04,869
THREE BUNKS,
ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER,

377
00:55:04,869 --> 00:55:06,170
AND...

378
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:08,072
THE FOOD THEY GIVE YOU...

379
00:55:09,674 --> 00:55:12,477
IF WE HADN'T GOTTEN
TO STOP AT HAWAII--

380
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:17,014
YOU EVER BEEN TO HAWAII?

381
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:21,686
'COURSE
YOU HAVEN'T.

382
00:55:26,557 --> 00:55:29,627
YOU'RE AWFUL PRETTY
FOR A...

383
00:55:31,529 --> 00:55:33,964
WELL, YOU KNOW,
FOR ONE OF YOU.

384
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:40,571
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYIN', DO YOU?

385
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:45,009
THEM HAWAIIAN GIRLS
WAS PRETTY TOO,

386
00:55:45,009 --> 00:55:47,978
THEY WERE DARK LIKE YOU....

387
00:55:47,978 --> 00:55:50,548
MAYBE DARKER,
BUT...

388
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:55,420
REAL PRETTY, YOU KNOW?

389
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:03,093
MOST DAYS I WISH I'D JUST
STAYED HOME IN LUBBOCK.

390
00:56:06,797 --> 00:56:09,133
THAT LITTLE FELLA
WHO OWNED THIS PILE

391
00:56:09,133 --> 00:56:12,537
WAS SOME KIND OF MUCKITY-MUCK
IN THE GOVERNMENT.

392
00:56:12,537 --> 00:56:15,806
WE SHIPPED HIM OFF TO GUAM.

393
00:56:15,806 --> 00:56:17,141
POST AND BEAM.

394
00:56:17,141 --> 00:56:18,443
HUH?

395
00:56:18,443 --> 00:56:20,310
THE, UH...

396
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:23,814
THE ROOF HERE SITS SQUARE
ON THE FOUR CORNER POSTS...

397
00:56:23,814 --> 00:56:26,417
SO THE WALLS
BEAR NO WEIGHT.

398
00:56:26,417 --> 00:56:28,218
EARTHQUAKE COUNTRY.

399
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,488
WHAT'S YOUR BAILIWICK AGAIN?

400
00:56:30,488 --> 00:56:32,356
SAN ISIDRO.

401
00:56:32,356 --> 00:56:35,560
ZONE TWO, HUH?
YES, SIR.

402
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:38,362
THEM INDIANS
BEEN UP TO MISCHIEF?

403
00:56:38,362 --> 00:56:39,997
SNIPING MOST NIGHTS.

404
00:56:39,997 --> 00:56:42,733
THEY CUT OUR TELEGRAPH LINES
ONCE A WEEK.

405
00:56:44,101 --> 00:56:45,770
MURDERED OUR COOLIES, SIR.

406
00:56:50,675 --> 00:56:52,577
WE TAKE A TOWN,

407
00:56:52,577 --> 00:56:54,512
AND IF WE DON'T
GARRISON IT,

408
00:56:54,512 --> 00:56:56,747
THEY'RE BACK IN BUSINESS
A DAY LATER.

409
00:56:56,747 --> 00:57:00,184
IF WE DO GARRISON IT,
THEY SIT OUT IN THE DAMN JUNGLE!

410
00:57:00,184 --> 00:57:03,521
IT'S AWFUL HARD TO TELL THE INDIANS FROM THE AMIGOS, SIR.

411
00:57:03,521 --> 00:57:06,356
WELL, GENERAL MacARTHUR
IS TAKING COMMAND,

412
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:10,795
AND HE WANTS US TO PUT SOME
TEETH INTO GENERAL ORDER 100.

413
00:57:10,795 --> 00:57:14,064
THEM GLOVES ARE COMING OFF, GENTLEMEN.

414
00:57:14,064 --> 00:57:17,768
FROM NOW ON THERE'S NO MORE
EASY COME AND GO.

415
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:19,937
WE CONCENTRATE
THE POPULATION

416
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:23,407
AND ISOLATE THE LADRONES
OUT IN THE BOONDOCKS.

417
00:57:23,407 --> 00:57:24,909
CONCENTRATE, SIR?

418
00:57:24,909 --> 00:57:27,377
WITHOUT THE SUPPORT
OF THE PEOPLE,

419
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:29,647
THEM BANDITS WILL STARVE.

420
00:57:30,881 --> 00:57:34,351
NOW, WE MAKE IT
VERY SIMPLE FOR 'EM.

421
00:57:34,351 --> 00:57:37,888
YOU'RE EITHER UNDER
AMERICAN PROTECTION,

422
00:57:37,888 --> 00:57:40,224
UNDER AMERICAN CONTROL,

423
00:57:40,224 --> 00:57:43,661
OR YOU'RE CONSIDERED TO BE HOSTILE,
ARMED OR NOT.

424
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:48,766
THERE IS TO BE NO TRAVEL
BETWEEN BARRIOS

425
00:57:48,766 --> 00:57:51,769
WITHOUT SAFE CONDUCT PAPERS,

426
00:57:51,769 --> 00:57:55,239
WHILE TRANSPORT AND
SANITARY IMPROVEMENTS

427
00:57:55,239 --> 00:58:00,945
WILL BE UNDERTAKEN AND SUPERVISED BY GARRISON COMMANDERS.

428
00:58:00,945 --> 00:58:04,882
AND THERE WILL BE A CURFEW
AT SUNDOWN,

429
00:58:04,882 --> 00:58:08,519
AND VIOLATORS WILL BE SHOT.

430
00:58:08,519 --> 00:58:14,592
NOW, WE HAVE DONE WITH THE CARROT
FOR THE MOMENT, GENTLEMEN...

431
00:58:14,592 --> 00:58:17,928
AND IT IS TIME
TO EMPLOY THE STICK.

432
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:51,862
NOW WHAT?

433
00:59:22,593 --> 00:59:25,495
IF IT DON'T STOP RAININ',
I'M GONNA SHOOT MYSELF.

434
00:59:25,495 --> 00:59:27,097
BE MY GUEST.

435
00:59:27,097 --> 00:59:28,799
CALL YOU.

436
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,302
KINGS.
SHIT ON A STICK.

437
00:59:33,738 --> 00:59:35,973
NO, YOU CAN'T PLAY.
WHAT?

438
00:59:35,973 --> 00:59:38,208
AT LEAST NOT TILL YOU
PAY ME WHAT YOU OWE ME,

439
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:40,645
SO'S I CAN PAY
THIS SIGNAL CORPS SUMBITCH,

440
00:59:40,645 --> 00:59:42,713
WIPE THAT GRIN OFF
HIS COUNTENANCE.

441
00:59:42,713 --> 00:59:46,250
I CAN'T PLAY CARDS,
WHAT THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

442
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:48,686
THAT SUICIDE DEAL
SOUNDED PRETTY GOOD.

443
00:59:48,686 --> 00:59:51,789
USE MY RIFLE.
THE BARRELS GOT COBWEBS IN IT.

444
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:24,789
OH.

445
01:00:26,423 --> 01:00:29,794
YOU STARTLED ME,
SKEAKIN' UP LIKE THAT.

446
01:00:33,397 --> 01:00:35,032
WHAT'S THAT, COFFEE?

447
01:00:38,368 --> 01:00:40,270
SOME KIND OF SOUP.

448
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:43,540
OH!

449
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:45,275
DAMN, IT'S HOT.

450
01:00:49,346 --> 01:00:51,381
DID YOU MAKE THIS FOR ME?

451
01:00:54,018 --> 01:00:56,954
GEE, THAT'S SWELL OF YA.

452
01:00:56,954 --> 01:00:59,656
IT'S NOT THAT SPICY STUFF,
IS IT?

453
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:05,162
OH, THAT'S GOOD.

454
01:01:05,162 --> 01:01:08,232
I LIKE A LITTLE PEPPER
IN MY GREENS,

455
01:01:08,232 --> 01:01:11,802
BUT SOME OF THE STUFF
YOU FOLKS EAT--

456
01:01:23,714 --> 01:01:27,752
SERGEANT RUNNELS'D NAIL MY HIDE
TO A WALL IF HE CAUGHT YOU HERE,

457
01:01:27,752 --> 01:01:30,254
BUT...
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN.

458
01:01:36,293 --> 01:01:40,030
I SURE AM SORRY ABOUT
KILLING ALL YOUR BUFFALOS.

459
01:07:37,221 --> 01:07:40,990
I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP
TO TAKE A SHIT...

460
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:42,459
SONNY!

461
01:07:42,459 --> 01:07:45,061
YOU FELL DOWN THE STEPS,
YOU FELL IN A PUDDLE...

462
01:08:22,632 --> 01:08:25,135
"ME WANT AMIGO."

463
01:08:36,813 --> 01:08:39,216
JESUS,
YOU'RE A MESS...

464
01:08:39,216 --> 01:08:41,351
SWILLIN' THAT TUBA DOWN.

465
01:08:41,351 --> 01:08:42,619
GET YOUR PANTS DOWN.

466
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:45,189
FALL IN THE DAMN SLIT TRENCH
AND DROWN.

467
01:08:45,189 --> 01:08:47,123
HA HA HA!

468
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:48,825
TAKE MY HAND.

469
01:08:48,825 --> 01:08:49,926
HEY.

470
01:08:49,926 --> 01:08:51,661
THERE'S SOMEBODY
LOOSE IN THE CAMP!

471
01:08:51,661 --> 01:08:53,197
HEY, GIL--

472
01:08:53,197 --> 01:08:54,764
HEY!

473
01:08:54,764 --> 01:08:55,899
HOLD UP THERE!

474
01:09:01,171 --> 01:09:02,539
DON'T YOU MOVE!

475
01:09:05,108 --> 01:09:07,311
GET TO YOUR POST, DAMNIT!

476
01:09:07,311 --> 01:09:08,812
FULL ALERT!

477
01:09:17,086 --> 01:09:18,855
WHO THE HELL IS THIS?

478
01:09:18,855 --> 01:09:20,990
WHAT WAS THIS ONE DOING?

479
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:24,394
FAR AS I CAN TELL,
HE WAS LEADING THE OTHER ONE TO YOU, LIEUTENANT.

480
01:09:24,394 --> 01:09:26,730
ONE MAN WITH A BOLO?

481
01:09:26,730 --> 01:09:30,166
MAYBE HE'S ONE OF THEM AMOKKERS,
HOPPED UP ON BEENO.

482
01:09:32,469 --> 01:09:34,238
PUT HIM BACK IN LOCK-UP.

483
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:36,706
YES, SIR.
COME ON, YOU.

484
01:09:38,642 --> 01:09:41,245
GET THE REST OF THESE PEOPLE
BACK INSIDE.

485
01:09:41,245 --> 01:09:43,012
YES, SIR. LYNCH.

486
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:44,080
COME ON, SARGE.

487
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:46,883
COME ON, LET'S GO. MOVE!

488
01:09:46,883 --> 01:09:48,585
COME ON, LET'S GO!

489
01:09:50,987 --> 01:09:52,856
SOMEBODY GOT SHOT.

490
01:11:22,746 --> 01:11:26,049
THESE THINGS
ARE JUST FALLIN' APART.

491
01:11:29,386 --> 01:11:34,190
WHAT IS THIS,
FIVE WEEKS OF RAIN?

492
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:38,528
IT'S A WONDER MORE PEOPLE IN THIS
COUNTRY AREN'T BUGHOUSE CRAZY.

493
01:11:41,565 --> 01:11:43,600
WHO SAYS THEY'RE NOT?

494
01:12:55,539 --> 01:12:58,241
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU DO NOT APPOINT A CABEZA,

495
01:12:58,241 --> 01:13:00,009
AS WAS DONE BEFORE.
SATURNINO HERE--

496
01:13:00,009 --> 01:13:03,112
HE WILL BE JUST AS ELIGIBLE
FOR THE JOB AS EVERYONE ELSE.

497
01:13:03,112 --> 01:13:05,815
THE WHOLE POINT OF THE ORDER IS TO GET
THEM USED TO THE WORKINGS OF DEMOCRACY.

498
01:13:05,815 --> 01:13:08,552
THESE ARE CHILDREN!
AND CHILDREN NEED TO LEARN WHAT'S GOOD FOR THEM!

499
01:13:08,552 --> 01:13:10,620
IN YOUR ARMY,
ARE THE OFFICERS ELECTED?

500
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:12,622
LOOK, THIS COMES FROM THE TOP.

501
01:13:12,622 --> 01:13:15,492
ELECTIONS WILL BE HELD.

502
01:13:37,447 --> 01:13:39,082
WHAT'S HE ASKING?

503
01:13:39,082 --> 01:13:42,151
HE DOUBTS THEIR CHOICE
WILL BE ACCEPTED.

504
01:13:42,151 --> 01:13:46,523
TELL HIM THAT IN AMERICA,
THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE IS SACRED.

505
01:13:54,230 --> 01:13:56,500
HOW MANY MEN OVER TWENTY-ONE
HAVE WE GOT?

506
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:11,948
NOT MUCH OF A TURNOUT.

507
01:14:11,948 --> 01:14:14,584
WELL, LET'S GET THIS
OVER WITH.

508
01:14:14,584 --> 01:14:17,053
YOU COULD
LET THE WOMEN VOTE.

509
01:14:17,053 --> 01:14:18,755
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

510
01:14:44,714 --> 01:14:48,251
THREE TO ONE THEY GO FOR
WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYANT.

511
01:14:49,719 --> 01:14:51,521
WE'LL COUNT THEM
IN THE CHAPEL.

512
01:14:51,521 --> 01:14:53,823
WE'LL COUNT THEM RIGHT HERE.

513
01:14:55,358 --> 01:14:56,993
VERY WELL.

514
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:11,541
A SURPRISING
DEMONSTRATION

515
01:15:11,541 --> 01:15:13,877
FOR MEN WHO CANNOT
READ OR WRITE.

516
01:15:17,714 --> 01:15:19,515
IS THIS
WHO I THINK IT IS?

517
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:21,150
NOW DO YOU SEE?

518
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:24,087
YOU WILL FORCED TO CONTRADICT YOURSELF BEFORE THEM.

519
01:15:24,087 --> 01:15:27,691
THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE
IS SACRED.

520
01:15:29,225 --> 01:15:32,128
COME ON OUT.

521
01:16:30,153 --> 01:16:33,623
AND SHE CAN'T JUST STAY
WHERE WE HAD HER?

522
01:16:36,559 --> 01:16:39,428
SHE HAS
THE COUGHING DISEASE.

523
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:40,630
TUBERCULOSIS?

524
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:42,231
THIS ONE, YES.

525
01:16:42,231 --> 01:16:46,235
DACANAY WISHES PERMISSION
TO BUILD HER HOUSE AGAIN.

526
01:16:56,813 --> 01:16:59,048
AND WHO'S GONNA BUILD IT?

527
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:27,376
GET A FEW OF OUR SHOVELS
ON THAT.

528
01:17:30,379 --> 01:17:31,748
YES, SIR.

529
01:18:03,112 --> 01:18:07,917
I MUSTA TORCHED A HUNDRED OF THESE
DAMN THINGS BETWEEN HERE AND MANILA.

530
01:18:07,917 --> 01:18:10,386
NEVER THOUGHT
I'D PUT ONE UP.

531
01:19:14,784 --> 01:19:18,988
I DIDN'T THINK THE LITTLE
MONKEYS HAD IT IN 'EM.

532
01:19:32,902 --> 01:19:34,804
THEY ARE A VERY
CLEVER PEOPLE.

533
01:19:34,804 --> 01:19:38,007
ALWAYS SMILING,
EVEN WHEN AT LABOR.

534
01:19:38,007 --> 01:19:39,608
IT'S NOT SUCH A BAD THING.

535
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:43,546
ONE MUST NEVER FORGET WHAT LIES BEHIND THE SMILE.

536
01:19:51,087 --> 01:19:52,621
WHAT DOES HE WANT?

537
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:53,957
ON THE DAY OF OUR SAINT

538
01:19:53,957 --> 01:19:56,225
FOR WHICH THE BARRIO
IS NAMED

539
01:19:56,225 --> 01:19:58,561
IS THE TRADITION TO CELEBRATE WITH A FIESTA.

540
01:19:58,561 --> 01:20:00,196
A CELEBRATION.

541
01:20:00,196 --> 01:20:01,597
PARTLY RELIGIOUS
AND PARTLY PROFANE--

542
01:20:01,597 --> 01:20:04,367
LIKE SO MANY THINGS
IN THIS POOR COUNTRY.

543
01:20:04,367 --> 01:20:09,038
MIGHT BE NICE TO LET THE FOLKS
BLOW OFF SOME STEAM.

544
01:20:14,243 --> 01:20:16,579
THE DRUMMER USED TO COME AROUND OUR PLACE ONCE A MONTH.

545
01:20:16,579 --> 01:20:20,349
SELL YOU STORE GOODS,
HARNESS LEATHER, LAMP OILS.

546
01:20:20,349 --> 01:20:22,952
YEAH. WHAT DO YOU
SUPPOSE THIS IS?

547
01:20:22,952 --> 01:20:25,054
DON'T TOUCH IT.

548
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:39,996
*

549
01:22:26,742 --> 01:22:28,111
HEY.

550
01:22:29,745 --> 01:22:31,247
UH...

551
01:22:31,247 --> 01:22:35,084
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS
ALL RIGHT, BUT I...

552
01:22:35,084 --> 01:22:37,620
I SEEN THIS
THEY WERE SELLING,

553
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:42,525
AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD
LOOK NICE ON YOU.

554
01:22:42,525 --> 01:22:44,927
FOR YOU.

555
01:22:44,927 --> 01:22:46,195
TAKE IT.

556
01:22:46,195 --> 01:22:49,065
CAN YOU PUT IT ON?

557
01:22:51,067 --> 01:22:52,468
PUT IT ON?

558
01:22:54,070 --> 01:22:55,438
TOO RISKY, HUH?

559
01:22:55,438 --> 01:22:59,342
YOU'D PROBABLY CATCH HELL
FROM YOUR PARENTS.

560
01:23:05,014 --> 01:23:06,615
LOOK, I'M JUST GONNA...

561
01:23:09,352 --> 01:23:11,287
OUT IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY,

562
01:23:11,287 --> 01:23:14,357
I KNOW WE CAN'T LIKE...

563
01:23:14,357 --> 01:23:18,494
UM...
I'M JUST GONNA...

564
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:23,632
STICK PRETTY CLOSE
TO YOU, ALL RIGHT?

565
01:23:23,632 --> 01:23:28,037
IF I GET ON YOUR NERVES,
YOU JUST TELL ME TO GO SHOO.

566
01:23:28,037 --> 01:23:30,439
SHOO.

567
01:23:32,675 --> 01:23:35,078
I'VE HAD HOME-BREW
OUTTA PEACHES,

568
01:23:35,078 --> 01:23:36,479
HOME-BREW OUTTA APPLES,

569
01:23:36,479 --> 01:23:40,249
HOME-BREW OUTTA, UH, CORN,
SUGAR CANE,

570
01:23:40,249 --> 01:23:44,220
BUT THIS TUBA
IS THE DAMNDEST STUFF.

571
01:23:50,793 --> 01:23:52,061
WHATEVER YOU SAY, JOE.

572
01:23:52,061 --> 01:23:53,662
JUST KEEP IT COMIN'.

573
01:23:53,662 --> 01:23:55,498
HILARIO...

574
01:24:24,927 --> 01:24:27,896
NOT A BAD TUNE.

575
01:24:27,896 --> 01:24:31,734
IT IS THE AIR THAT OUR CAZADORES
HEAR WHEN THEY MARCH INTO BATTLE.

576
01:24:34,303 --> 01:24:37,039
NICE OF THEM TO PLAY IT
FOR YOU.

577
01:24:37,039 --> 01:24:40,042
THEY ARE WONDERFUL MIMICS.

578
01:24:40,042 --> 01:24:43,446
IF THEY
ADMIRE A MELODY...

579
01:24:52,255 --> 01:24:53,422
NO, NO, NO!

580
01:24:53,422 --> 01:24:56,292
YOU DON'T PUT SAUCE
ON BARBECUE!

581
01:24:56,292 --> 01:24:57,960
HOLY MOLEY,
WHERE YOU FROM?

582
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:59,094
SOUTH CAROLINA.

583
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:00,596
WELL, THAT EXPLAINS A LOT.

584
01:25:58,487 --> 01:26:00,323
WHERE DID THEY LEARN THAT?

585
01:26:00,323 --> 01:26:03,626
AS I SAID, THEY ARE
WONDERFUL MIMICS.

586
01:26:05,261 --> 01:26:07,029
YOU SHOULD STAND UP.

587
01:26:07,029 --> 01:26:10,165
*

588
01:26:15,538 --> 01:26:17,673
WHY IS EVERYONE
TAKING OFF THEIR HATS?

589
01:26:17,673 --> 01:26:20,376
THEY BELIEVE THIS IS
YOUR NATIONAL ANTHEM.

590
01:26:25,948 --> 01:26:27,015
YOU'RE DRUNK.

591
01:26:27,015 --> 01:26:28,784
I'M OFF DUTY, SARGE.

592
01:26:28,784 --> 01:26:30,085
IT'S 10:00,

593
01:26:30,085 --> 01:26:32,755
AND YOU GOT SENTRY
ON THE SOUTH END.

594
01:26:32,755 --> 01:26:36,359
THERE AIN'T ANY BANDIDOS
LEFT OUT THERE.

595
01:26:36,359 --> 01:26:39,161
IF I CATCH YOU SLEEPING...

596
01:26:39,161 --> 01:26:40,329
OHH.

597
01:26:40,329 --> 01:26:43,832
YOU GONNA WAKE UP
IN THE HOOSEGOW.

598
01:26:43,832 --> 01:26:46,101
MOVE.

599
01:26:46,101 --> 01:26:49,104
I TAKE BACK EVERY GOOD THING I EVER SAID ABOUT YOU.

600
01:26:59,315 --> 01:27:00,949
AH.

601
01:27:10,693 --> 01:27:12,861
THE THING IS...

602
01:27:12,861 --> 01:27:16,365
WHEN YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE
YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR...

603
01:27:16,365 --> 01:27:18,233
YOU...

604
01:27:21,404 --> 01:27:23,339
YOU'VE GOT YOUR ORDERS,

605
01:27:23,339 --> 01:27:25,341
AND YOU'VE GOT
ALL YOUR PEOPLE...

606
01:27:25,341 --> 01:27:27,476
THEIR LIVES.

607
01:27:29,745 --> 01:27:33,382
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
I'M TALKING ABOUT, DO YOU?

608
01:27:33,382 --> 01:27:36,251
OR MAYBE YOU DO.

609
01:27:38,954 --> 01:27:40,022
NICE PARTY.

610
01:27:53,369 --> 01:27:55,504
*

611
01:30:13,809 --> 01:30:15,177
NO.

612
01:30:53,415 --> 01:30:56,018
GODDAMNIT!

613
01:30:57,953 --> 01:30:59,588
TO YOUR POSTS!

614
01:31:08,664 --> 01:31:10,766
YOU'RE UP EARLY, SIR.

615
01:31:10,766 --> 01:31:14,903
THERE'S A SENTRY BACK THERE WHO DESERVES A FIRING SQUAD.

616
01:31:17,606 --> 01:31:19,675
WHAT IS ALL THIS?

617
01:31:19,675 --> 01:31:23,278
A FIESTA--
SAINT ISIDRO THE LABORER.

618
01:31:23,278 --> 01:31:25,914
YOU'RE GETTIN' PRETTY
COMFORTABLE HERE.

619
01:31:25,914 --> 01:31:28,450
IT'S BEEN QUIET, SIR.

620
01:31:28,450 --> 01:31:30,586
NO SNIPING, NO THIEVERY...

621
01:31:30,586 --> 01:31:33,556
SAN JUAN HAS BEEN HIT
ONCE A WEEK.

622
01:31:33,556 --> 01:31:36,692
AND THEY BURNED
HALF OF ROSARIO DOWN.

623
01:31:36,692 --> 01:31:38,260
AND BOTH
OF THOSE BARRIOS

624
01:31:38,260 --> 01:31:40,563
HAVE GARRISONS TWICE THE SIZE OF YOURS.

625
01:31:40,563 --> 01:31:42,364
WHY DO YOU THINK
THAT IS?

626
01:31:42,364 --> 01:31:46,602
WE HAVE MADE EFFORTS AT--
AT UNDERSTANDING, SIR--

627
01:31:46,602 --> 01:31:47,836
IT'S BECAUSE
THE LADRONES

628
01:31:47,836 --> 01:31:50,172
HAVE PEOPLE WORKING
FOR THEM HERE!

629
01:31:50,172 --> 01:31:55,310
THEY'RE GIVING THEM
FOOD, INFORMATION...

630
01:31:55,310 --> 01:32:00,082
WE GET A TELEGRAPH MESSAGE
ONCE A WEEK MAYBE.

631
01:32:00,082 --> 01:32:01,817
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT INFORMATION THEY--

632
01:32:01,817 --> 01:32:04,152
A SUPPLY TRAIN WAS AMBUSHED ON THE SOUTH ROAD

633
01:32:04,152 --> 01:32:06,855
OUTSIDE OF SANTA CLARA
YESTERDAY!

634
01:32:06,855 --> 01:32:09,658
KILLED A TEAMSTER,
RAN THE MULES OFF

635
01:32:09,658 --> 01:32:13,762
AND PINNED THE REST DOWN TILL A
SQUAD WANDERED UP FROM MACAPAL,

636
01:32:13,762 --> 01:32:16,198
AND YOU'RE THROWING PARTIES FOR THE NATIVES!

637
01:32:18,433 --> 01:32:20,468
NOW, WHAT BECAME
OF THAT HEAD MAN?

638
01:32:20,468 --> 01:32:22,304
HE'S, UH...
HUH?!

639
01:32:22,304 --> 01:32:23,305
HE'S RIGHT HERE, SIR.

640
01:32:32,414 --> 01:32:36,251
I WILL BET YOU A FIFTH
OF KENTUCKY BOURBON

641
01:32:36,251 --> 01:32:39,722
THAT THIS MONKEY
KNOWS WHERE THEIR HIDEOUT IS!

642
01:32:43,325 --> 01:32:45,794
CHIEF! ZUÑIGA!

643
01:32:49,097 --> 01:32:51,600
YOU GENTLEMEN KNOW THE DRILL.

644
01:33:44,086 --> 01:33:50,225
GARRISONED IN SOME
LITTLE CORNER OF NOWHERE,

645
01:33:50,225 --> 01:33:56,031
NOTHING MUCH TO DO,
NO ACTION.

646
01:33:56,031 --> 01:34:01,336
ALL YOUR SOLDIERING SKILLS
BEGIN TO SLIP AWAY.

647
01:34:01,336 --> 01:34:06,508
I SAT ON AN INDIAN RESERVATION
FOR FIVE YEARS...

648
01:34:06,508 --> 01:34:13,181
WATCHED MY MEN TURN INTO DRUNKS
AND WHOREMONGERS.

649
01:34:15,117 --> 01:34:18,386
A LITTLE RABBIT HUNT WILL DO
YOUR FELLOWS A WORLD OF GOOD.

650
01:34:22,424 --> 01:34:24,259
ANYTHING TO REPORT?

651
01:34:28,964 --> 01:34:31,266
WHERE IS CREIGHTON?
DAMNIT!

652
01:34:31,266 --> 01:34:34,737
HE SAYS
THE MAN CONFESSES.

653
01:34:34,737 --> 01:34:37,139
HE KNOWS WHERE
THE INSURRECTOS HIDE.

654
01:34:37,139 --> 01:34:39,808
YOU'RE STILL HERE?

655
01:34:39,808 --> 01:34:42,210
I AM.

656
01:34:42,210 --> 01:34:45,247
YOU THINK
HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH?

657
01:34:45,247 --> 01:34:48,250
I HEAR THE CONFESSIONS
OF MANY MEN, COLONEL,

658
01:34:48,250 --> 01:34:51,186
BUT THEY ARE ONLY
TORTURED BY THEIR SINS.

659
01:35:05,233 --> 01:35:07,169
RAFAEL! RAFAEL!

660
01:35:08,536 --> 01:35:09,938
RAFAEL.

661
01:35:17,913 --> 01:35:21,049
THAT'S NOT TORTURE, PADRE.

662
01:35:22,650 --> 01:35:25,620
FIVE MINUTES ON THE TRAIL,

663
01:35:25,620 --> 01:35:27,722
HE'LL BE
AS GOOD AS NEW.

664
01:37:06,955 --> 01:37:08,857
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM HERE?

665
01:37:09,791 --> 01:37:11,159
MAYBE HE NEEDS WATER.

666
01:37:11,159 --> 01:37:13,561
HE HAD HIS FILL OF THAT
THIS MORNING.

667
01:37:13,561 --> 01:37:18,100
WHAT THE SON OF A MONKEY NEEDS
IS A DOSE OF LEAD.

668
01:38:23,798 --> 01:38:25,433
CORPUS CHRISTI.

669
01:38:25,433 --> 01:38:26,368
AMEN.

670
01:38:30,038 --> 01:38:31,539
CORPUS CHRISTI.

671
01:38:31,539 --> 01:38:32,474
AMEN.

672
01:38:35,944 --> 01:38:37,712
CORPUS CHRISTI.

673
01:38:37,712 --> 01:38:38,646
AMEN.

674
01:39:58,060 --> 01:40:00,462
THAT'S GOVERNMENT
PROPERTY, SOLDIER.

675
01:40:00,462 --> 01:40:02,697
WELL, THE GOVERNMENT
CAN COME AND GET IT.

676
01:40:02,697 --> 01:40:05,600
SHOULDN'T NOBODY DO NOTHING
BUT SLEEP IN THIS HEAT.

677
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:08,803
THAT'S WHAT THEM GOOGOO BANDIDOS ARE DOING RIGHT NOW,

678
01:40:08,803 --> 01:40:13,841
STRETCHED OUT IN HAMMOCKS
NEXT TO A NICE COOL STREAM.

679
01:40:13,841 --> 01:40:15,477
THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING?

680
01:40:15,477 --> 01:40:16,911
HELL NO.

681
01:40:16,911 --> 01:40:19,847
WE'RE GOING ON AN ALL-DAY STROLL TO NOWHERE.

682
01:40:19,847 --> 01:40:21,149
YOU THINK SO?

683
01:40:21,149 --> 01:40:22,817
THAT LITTLE AMIGO
UP THERE

684
01:40:22,817 --> 01:40:25,820
COULDN'T WALK A STRAIGHT LINE IN A CATTLE CHUTE.

685
01:40:25,820 --> 01:40:28,490
THEM FELLAS WORKED HIM OVER
PRETTY GOOD.

686
01:40:28,490 --> 01:40:31,493
FIRST CHANCE HE GET,
HE'S GONNA GIVE US THE SLIP.

687
01:40:31,493 --> 01:40:33,795
AND THAT'S THE BEST THING
THAT'S HAPPEN TO US TODAY.

688
01:41:13,335 --> 01:41:15,470
HE SAYS THIS IS IT.

689
01:41:15,470 --> 01:41:17,839
WE'VE BEEN GOING IN CIRCLES,
DAMNIT!

690
01:41:17,839 --> 01:41:20,508
IF ANYBODY CAMPED HERE,
IT WAS A LONG WAY BACK.

691
01:41:20,508 --> 01:41:23,945
AND ANYBODY WHO'S OUT HERE,
UNLESS THEY'RE BLIND,

692
01:41:23,945 --> 01:41:26,381
KNOWS WE'RE COMING BY NOW.

693
01:41:39,861 --> 01:41:42,430
* IN THE LAND OF DOPEY DREAMS

694
01:41:42,430 --> 01:41:44,432
* LOVELY, PEACEFUL PHILIPPINES

695
01:41:44,432 --> 01:41:48,303
* WHERE THE BOLO MAN
IS HIKING NIGHT AND DAY *

696
01:41:48,303 --> 01:41:50,438
* WHERE TAGALOGS
STEAL AND LIE *

697
01:41:50,438 --> 01:41:52,407
* AND AMERICANOS DIE *

698
01:41:52,407 --> 01:41:54,242
* THERE YOU HEAR
THE SOLDIERS SING *

699
01:41:54,242 --> 01:41:56,578
* THIS EVENING LAY

700
01:41:56,578 --> 01:42:00,648
* DAMN, DAMN,
DAMN THE FILIPINOS *

701
01:42:00,648 --> 01:42:04,319
* CROSS-EYED
KHAKIAK LADRONES *

702
01:42:04,319 --> 01:42:06,354
* UNDERNEATH THE STARRY FLAG

703
01:42:06,354 --> 01:42:08,323
* CIVILIZE 'EM WITH A KRAG *

704
01:42:08,323 --> 01:42:12,927
* THEN RETURN US
TO OUR OWN BELOVED HOMES *

705
01:42:42,023 --> 01:42:46,160
I'M TELLING YOU,
IT'S NOT JUST THE BEENO.

706
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:49,364
I'M GETTIN CHILLS OUT HERE
IN THE BLAZING SUN.

707
01:42:49,364 --> 01:42:51,899
MY KNEES FEEL SHAKY.

708
01:42:51,899 --> 01:42:53,235
YOU GOT THE RUNS?

709
01:42:53,235 --> 01:42:54,636
I HAD THOSE
EVER SINCE MANILA.

710
01:42:54,636 --> 01:42:57,138
THIS HERE IS A WHOLE
DIFFERENT DEAL.

711
01:42:57,138 --> 01:43:00,242
HEY, IF SHANKER
CAN GET SENT HOME--

712
01:43:09,116 --> 01:43:10,117
GET OFF OF THERE!

713
01:43:10,117 --> 01:43:11,553
I CAN'T MOVE!

714
01:43:27,101 --> 01:43:30,538
THEY DON'T HAVE THE AMMO
TO KEEP THIS UP, PEOPLE!

715
01:43:30,538 --> 01:43:34,041
FIX BAYONETS!
GET READY TO CHARGE!

716
01:43:34,041 --> 01:43:38,613
ON THE LIEUTENANT'S ORDERS,
WE GO OVER THE TOP AND FLUSH THEM OUT!

717
01:43:57,299 --> 01:43:59,033
READY!

718
01:43:59,033 --> 01:44:00,335
CHARGE!

719
01:44:01,903 --> 01:44:03,338
CHARGE!

720
01:44:14,882 --> 01:44:16,351
AAH!

721
01:44:22,390 --> 01:44:25,927
DUTCH? CAN YOU SEE WHERE I'M HIT?
I CAN'T FEEL NOTHIN'.

722
01:44:25,927 --> 01:44:28,530
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, KID.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

723
01:45:20,214 --> 01:45:23,084
DAMNIT.

724
01:45:28,255 --> 01:45:29,957
LEAVE 'EM THERE.

725
01:45:29,957 --> 01:45:33,127
COLONEL, THE FAMILIES OF THESE MEN ARE IN THIS BARRIO.

726
01:45:33,127 --> 01:45:36,431
THEN LET 'EM GET A GOOD LOOK.

727
01:45:51,345 --> 01:45:54,416
COLONEL?

728
01:45:54,416 --> 01:45:56,984
THAT'LL DO.
GET SOME PEOPLE ON IT.

729
01:45:56,984 --> 01:46:01,889
SIR, HE MAY HAVE RUN US AROUND TODAY,
BUT THE AMBUSH--

730
01:46:01,889 --> 01:46:04,626
WE TOOK THREE CASUALTIES
TODAY, LIEUTENANT.

731
01:46:04,626 --> 01:46:08,763
WE LOST OUR SCOUT,
TWO AMERICAN BOYS.

732
01:46:08,763 --> 01:46:10,698
ONLY KILLED FIVE
OF THE ENEMY.

733
01:46:10,698 --> 01:46:15,503
WE LET THE MONKEYS GET AWAY WITH THOSE NUMBERS,
AND THEY'LL NEVER GIVE UP!

734
01:46:15,503 --> 01:46:17,171
I HAVE TO LIVE
WITH THESE PEOPLE.

735
01:46:17,171 --> 01:46:20,341
NO, LIEUTENANT!
YOU GOTTA MAKE WAR ON THESE PEOPLE!

736
01:46:20,341 --> 01:46:24,412
YOU LET THE BLEEDING HEARTS SORT
OUT THE REST WHEN WE'RE GONE.

737
01:46:27,915 --> 01:46:30,585
NO, NO, NO.
IT IS NO. IT IS NO.

738
01:46:30,585 --> 01:46:32,420
IT SAYS NO,
AND IT IS CONFUSED,

739
01:46:32,420 --> 01:46:33,921
AND IT SAYS NO!

740
01:46:36,491 --> 01:46:38,826
NO, NO, NO, HOBO,
NO, HOBO, HOBO.

741
01:46:38,826 --> 01:46:40,928
I'M THINKING THE SAME THING.
I COULD GET HOME,

742
01:46:40,928 --> 01:46:43,197
BUT YOU HAVE TO GET ME
OUT OF HERE.

743
01:46:43,197 --> 01:46:46,400
I CAN--I CAN MOVE UP,
YOU CAN MOVE ME UP!

744
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:48,603
HOW YOU DOIN', SON?

745
01:46:48,603 --> 01:46:52,607
I CAN'T FEEL NOTHIN'
BELOW MY BELT.

746
01:46:52,607 --> 01:46:57,244
WELL, YOU TOOK ONE
IN THE HIP.

747
01:46:57,244 --> 01:46:59,647
IT CAME OUT CLEAN,
BUT...

748
01:46:59,647 --> 01:47:03,718
IT MUST HAVE NICKED
YOUR SPINE ON ITS WAY.

749
01:47:03,718 --> 01:47:06,420
TAKE IT ALL THE WAY UP.
TAKE IT ALL THE WAY UP...

750
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:08,155
WILL YOU MAKE HIM
SHUT UP?

751
01:47:17,098 --> 01:47:20,968
FELLAS SAY THAT YOU'VE BEEN
TO A HANGING, CORPORAL.

752
01:47:20,968 --> 01:47:23,370
BACK HOME.

753
01:47:23,370 --> 01:47:26,508
WE STRUNG UP A NIGGER
THAT STABBED A WHITE MAN.

754
01:47:26,508 --> 01:47:28,743
YOU DO THE HONORS, THEN.

755
01:51:25,079 --> 01:51:26,881
ANYTHING BACK FROM MANILA?

756
01:51:26,881 --> 01:51:29,851
I SENT A LINE-CHECK
TO SANTA ANA FIRST THING.

757
01:51:29,851 --> 01:51:31,485
EVERYTHING'S CLEAR.

758
01:51:31,485 --> 01:51:32,553
STAY WITH IT.

759
01:51:32,553 --> 01:51:34,822
IF COLONEL HARDACRE
FINDS OUT--

760
01:51:34,822 --> 01:51:37,859
HE WON'T FIND OUT, WILL HE?

761
01:51:42,163 --> 01:51:45,632
THE AMIGO DID LEAD US
INTO AN AMBUSH, SIR.

762
01:51:45,632 --> 01:51:48,069
MAYBE.

763
01:51:50,537 --> 01:51:53,074
THEY CAN'T BEAT US.

764
01:51:53,074 --> 01:51:56,043
I DON'T KNOW
WHY THEY EVEN BOTHER.

765
01:51:56,043 --> 01:51:58,846
IT'S THEIR COUNTRY, SIR.

766
01:52:06,187 --> 01:52:09,991
LIEUTENANT, I MUST INFORM YOU
THAT I MUST LEAVE THIS PLACE.

767
01:52:09,991 --> 01:52:13,160
ABOVE ALL THINGS,
I AM A SPANIARD.

768
01:52:13,160 --> 01:52:14,495
LIVING UNDER THE RULE
OF OTHERS--

769
01:52:14,495 --> 01:52:17,498
BEFORE YOU LEAVE,
THROW ON YOUR CEREMONIAL GEAR

770
01:52:17,498 --> 01:52:19,466
AND DO WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO FOR THE AMIGO.

771
01:52:22,569 --> 01:52:24,071
THIS ONE'S HEAD MAN NOW.

772
01:52:24,071 --> 01:52:26,340
TELL HIM TO WATCH HIS STEP.

773
01:52:57,204 --> 01:52:59,273
I THOUGHT I'D
CATCH YOU SLEEPING.

774
01:52:59,273 --> 01:53:01,608
AND I THOUGHT YOU'D BE BACK
IN THE STATES BY NOW.

775
01:53:01,608 --> 01:53:03,577
OH, THEY SAY I'M CURED.

776
01:53:03,577 --> 01:53:05,112
CURED FROM THE CLAP?

777
01:53:05,112 --> 01:53:07,648
THAT'S A BIGGER LONG SHOT
THAN US CATCHING AGUINALDO.

778
01:53:07,648 --> 01:53:10,217
YOU'RE SHITTIN' ME.

779
01:53:10,217 --> 01:53:12,753
IT JUST CAME IN
ON THE WIRE FROM MANILA.

780
01:53:12,753 --> 01:53:14,688
THEY NAILED AGGY?

781
01:53:14,688 --> 01:53:16,490
HOT DAMN!
HO HO HO!

782
01:53:16,490 --> 01:53:19,193
YEAH, AND HE'S ASKED OUR LITTLE
BROWN BROTHERS TO GIVE UP THE GAME.

783
01:53:19,193 --> 01:53:21,362
MacARTHUR'S ORDERED
GENERAL AMNESTY,

784
01:53:21,362 --> 01:53:23,430
LETTIN' PRISONERS
GO LEFT AND RIGHT.

785
01:53:23,430 --> 01:53:25,766
ANY INSURRECTO THAT WANTS
TO THROW IN THE TOWEL

786
01:53:25,766 --> 01:53:28,669
GETS 30 PESOS MEXICAN
FOR HIS RIFLE.

787
01:53:28,669 --> 01:53:30,537
THEY CAN HAVE MINE.

788
01:53:30,537 --> 01:53:32,874
WE GOTTA CELEBRATE.

789
01:53:32,874 --> 01:53:34,708
HERE WE GO!

790
01:53:34,708 --> 01:53:36,377
CHAMPAGNE GLASS
RIGHT HERE.

791
01:53:36,377 --> 01:53:38,145
OH, YEAH.

792
01:55:16,843 --> 01:55:23,550
I STRETCHED A COUPLE APACHES BACK IN THE TERRITORY.

793
01:55:23,550 --> 01:55:26,220
THEY CONSIDER IT A...

794
01:55:26,220 --> 01:55:30,591
PARTICULARLY
IGNOBLE DEATH.

795
01:55:31,925 --> 01:55:35,096
IT MAKES AN IMPRESSION
ON THE OTHERS.

796
01:55:35,963 --> 01:55:40,001
WITH THIS BUNCH,
WHO KNOWS?

797
01:55:46,974 --> 01:55:51,445
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD.

798
01:56:06,793 --> 01:56:11,065
"MILITARY NECESSITY ADMITS
OF ALL DIRECT DESTRUCTION..."

799
01:56:12,799 --> 01:56:17,704
"...OF LIFE OR LIMB
OF ARMED ENEMIES, HOWEVER,

01:56:17,704 --> 01:56:21,342
"MEN WHO TAKE UP ARMS

01:56:49,670 --> 01:56:53,474
HEAD MAN OF
THE BARRIO OF SAN ISIDRO

809
01:56:53,474 --> 01:56:56,843
SHALL HANG BY THE NECK
UNTIL HE IS DEAD.

810
01:57:09,923 --> 01:57:12,593
YOU THINK
THIS IS A SHITHOLE,

811
01:57:12,593 --> 01:57:14,961
YOU OUGHT TO SEE
SAN ISIDRO.

812
01:57:14,961 --> 01:57:16,630
THEY HAD A SMOKER
THE OTHER DAY.

813
01:57:16,630 --> 01:57:18,232
WAS ANYONE KILLED?

814
01:57:18,232 --> 01:57:19,900
A COUPLE ON BOTH SIDES.

815
01:57:19,900 --> 01:57:21,001
YOU KNOW WHO GOT IT?

816
01:57:21,001 --> 01:57:23,237
THEY DIDN'T SEND NAMES.

817
01:57:23,237 --> 01:57:25,406
THERE'S SOME GOOGOO
THEY'RE GONNA STRETCH.

818
01:57:25,406 --> 01:57:28,142
COURSE, THEN THIS MESSAGE CAME IN--

819
01:57:28,142 --> 01:57:30,744
DAMN! I'D BETTER SEND
ALONG THE HAPPY NEWS.

820
01:57:30,744 --> 01:57:33,214
WELL, THAT'S WHAT I CALL
CUTTIN' IT CLOSE.

821
01:59:00,534 --> 01:59:01,735
AAH!

822
01:59:04,638 --> 01:59:07,341
I WAS JUST PART
OF THE CROWD, SIR.

823
01:59:07,341 --> 01:59:09,476
I DIDN'T TIE THE ROPE.

824
02:00:09,936 --> 02:00:12,673
SIGN OR MAKE YOUR MARK
RIGHT HERE.

825
02:00:14,541 --> 02:00:17,578
YEAH. ALL RIGHT,
GIVE HIM SOME MONEY.

826
02:00:21,615 --> 02:00:23,684
COME ON.

827
02:00:26,353 --> 02:00:28,922
SIGN OR MAKE YOUR MARK
RIGHT HERE.

828
02:00:32,293 --> 02:00:35,028
THIS THING CAN STILL SHOOT.

829
02:00:35,028 --> 02:00:38,499
WELL, THEN THIS IS
YOUR LUCKY DAY, AMIGO.
