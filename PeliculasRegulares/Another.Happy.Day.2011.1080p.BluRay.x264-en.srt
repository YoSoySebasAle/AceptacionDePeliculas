1
00:00:59,724 --> 00:01:02,424
Do you think mom is hot?

2
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:05,093
No. Not really.

3
00:01:05,163 --> 00:01:06,493
Why?

4
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:10,523
I don't know. She's not my type.

5
00:01:10,573 --> 00:01:11,779
You don't think she's pretty?

6
00:01:11,803 --> 00:01:14,643
Like, even if she wasn't mom?

7
00:01:14,673 --> 00:01:17,542
Uh, look, every opinion
is subjective.

8
00:01:17,582 --> 00:01:21,542
You know, maybe she's pretty
in the universal sense.

9
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,452
I mean, who the fuck knows?

10
00:01:23,482 --> 00:01:25,641
I'm just saying she
doesn't do it for me.

11
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:29,121
Do you think other people
think she's hot?

12
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:30,621
I don't know.

13
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:33,121
I mean, some people
fucking like McDonald's.

14
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:34,651
I like McDonald's.

15
00:01:34,691 --> 00:01:38,530
Right, and apparently,
you think mom is hot, so.

16
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,530
What took you so long?

17
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,560
Find yourself a nice morbidly
obese rest stop suitor.

18
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,569
To take that much needed edge
off the family road trip?

19
00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:49,299
- I just got that.
- Yeah, me too.

20
00:01:49,339 --> 00:01:50,499
Mom?

21
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:52,569
Shut up and get
in the car, Elliot.

22
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:54,155
Ben, who gave you
money for that shit?

23
00:01:54,179 --> 00:01:55,309
Dad.

24
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:58,908
Guess her bathroom tryst
was not satisfying.

25
00:02:05,087 --> 00:02:06,917
Seat belts.

26
00:02:06,957 --> 00:02:08,217
We good?

27
00:02:08,257 --> 00:02:10,557
Um, okay.

28
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:13,207
And action!

29
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:19,226
So, Lynn. Where are we headed?

30
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:21,136
We're going to Annapolis,
Maryland.

31
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:22,656
Hmm. And why?

32
00:02:22,706 --> 00:02:25,135
Why are we going
to Annapolis, Maryland?

33
00:02:25,175 --> 00:02:27,405
Because my oldest son,
your brother,

34
00:02:27,445 --> 00:02:28,635
Is getting married.

35
00:02:28,675 --> 00:02:30,375
Hmm. Now what is his name?

36
00:02:30,415 --> 00:02:32,075
Dylan.

37
00:02:33,115 --> 00:02:35,084
And, um, his bride to be?

38
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:36,514
Does she hail from Annapolis?

39
00:02:36,544 --> 00:02:38,414
Yes. She does.

40
00:02:38,454 --> 00:02:40,314
And what is her name?

41
00:02:40,354 --> 00:02:42,614
Her name is Heather, Elliot.
Heather.

42
00:02:42,654 --> 00:02:47,053
And do you like this
Heather Elliot?

43
00:02:47,093 --> 00:02:49,393
She's very sweet.

44
00:02:49,423 --> 00:02:51,293
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

45
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:54,303
So then, you have
three sons, correct?

46
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,592
And a daughter.
Your sister Alice.

47
00:02:56,632 --> 00:02:59,692
And does this... this Alice.

48
00:02:59,732 --> 00:03:02,532
Is she, uh, from
a previous marriage maybe.

49
00:03:02,572 --> 00:03:04,372
Or the current one?

50
00:03:04,412 --> 00:03:06,071
She's from a previous one.

51
00:03:06,111 --> 00:03:10,201
Hmm. And, um,
this daughter, Alice,

52
00:03:10,251 --> 00:03:12,911
Does she live with you
or the ex-husband?

53
00:03:12,951 --> 00:03:14,441
She lives with us, Elliot.

54
00:03:14,481 --> 00:03:16,580
Hmm, and this Dylan character.

55
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,140
Let's return to him
for a moment.

56
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,380
Does he also reside with us?

57
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,050
That's not funny, Elliot.

58
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:27,139
Ok, I'm not trying to be funny.
I'm just trying to establish the residency.

59
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,489
Of the two eldest children.

60
00:03:28,529 --> 00:03:30,929
Yeah, well, I've had enough.

61
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:33,159
Okay, well, maybe we'll circle.

62
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,959
Back around to that
a little later.

63
00:03:34,998 --> 00:03:37,488
We won't circle back
around to anything later.

64
00:03:37,538 --> 00:03:40,198
Okay, well, um,
moving right along then.

65
00:03:40,238 --> 00:03:42,038
Moving right along.

66
00:03:42,078 --> 00:03:45,877
Uh, let's see.
This daughter, Alice.

67
00:03:45,907 --> 00:03:47,177
Is she coming to the wedding?

68
00:03:47,217 --> 00:03:51,047
Why are you doing this, Elliot?

69
00:03:51,087 --> 00:03:52,517
Why... why am l...

70
00:03:52,547 --> 00:03:55,046
You know, to document. Document.

71
00:03:55,086 --> 00:03:57,456
The... the travels
and the wedding.

72
00:03:57,486 --> 00:03:59,516
And just family time.

73
00:03:59,556 --> 00:04:01,256
I'm not interested.

74
00:04:01,296 --> 00:04:04,416
In what? You're not interested
in keeping a record?

75
00:04:04,466 --> 00:04:05,565
No.

76
00:04:07,335 --> 00:04:10,235
Okay, then how will we know that
any of this even took place?

77
00:04:10,265 --> 00:04:11,855
You know, that it existed.

78
00:04:11,935 --> 00:04:13,125
That what took place?

79
00:04:13,165 --> 00:04:17,124
The wedding.
All that surrounds matrimony.

80
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:19,474
I'm sure they hired
a videographer.

81
00:04:19,504 --> 00:04:22,374
True, but those guys don't
really dig deep enough.

82
00:04:22,414 --> 00:04:24,244
Okay, you know what, Elliot?
I have...

83
00:04:24,284 --> 00:04:28,143
Mom! Watch out! Watch out!
Jesus fuck! Fuck.

84
00:04:28,183 --> 00:04:30,203
Turn that fucking
camera off, Ben!

85
00:04:30,253 --> 00:04:32,343
Turn it off!

86
00:04:35,322 --> 00:04:37,382
Taylor, like, told me
that mom and dad.

87
00:04:37,422 --> 00:04:39,362
Bought grandma and
grandpa this house.

88
00:04:39,392 --> 00:04:41,422
I don't wanna hear another
word from either of you.

89
00:04:41,462 --> 00:04:43,482
For the next 24 hours.

90
00:04:43,532 --> 00:04:45,461
Well, is that, like, true?

91
00:04:45,501 --> 00:04:47,121
Do you think I'm kidding?

92
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:49,361
I will take away every fucking
privilege you have.

93
00:04:49,401 --> 00:04:51,601
Oh ho, and you are
quite privileged.

94
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:53,231
That goes for you too, Elliot.

95
00:04:53,271 --> 00:04:55,000
Alice gets here in three days.

96
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,270
Please, I'm begging you.

97
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,240
Don't make this any more
difficult for me.

98
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,440
Than it already is.

99
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,580
I won't.

100
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,040
And no smoking.

101
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,170
Your grandfather already
has one foot in the grave.

102
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,309
But not from smoking.

103
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:08,049
It doesn't matter.

104
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:10,379
Oh, and just so you're prepared,

105
00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:14,019
The last time you went to rehab,
I told them you were in Sweden.

106
00:05:14,059 --> 00:05:17,318
Sweden? What?

107
00:05:18,358 --> 00:05:22,318
Jesus. I don't know
anything about Sweden.

108
00:05:22,368 --> 00:05:24,958
Oh, shit.

109
00:05:24,997 --> 00:05:28,457
Oh. Fantastic.

110
00:05:28,507 --> 00:05:31,297
What happened?

111
00:05:31,337 --> 00:05:32,807
Dad's heart slowed down again.

112
00:05:32,837 --> 00:05:33,967
Was he okay? Is he alive?

113
00:05:34,007 --> 00:05:35,406
He's fine. He's all right.

114
00:05:35,446 --> 00:05:37,966
They're just making sure everything's okay.
Don't go in there.

115
00:05:39,876 --> 00:05:41,576
Dad?

116
00:05:41,616 --> 00:05:44,346
You can't say the
pacemaker doesn't do its job.

117
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:45,575
- Mom?
- He's stable, Doris.

118
00:05:45,615 --> 00:05:47,015
Mom, are you okay?

119
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:51,545
Yes, I'm fine thanks,
don't worry.

120
00:05:51,595 --> 00:05:53,425
Does that feel good?

121
00:06:00,364 --> 00:06:04,204
Well, I don't understand.
He has a heart attack...

122
00:06:04,234 --> 00:06:05,893
No, no, no.
It wasn't a heart attack.

123
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:07,873
The fentanyl just set
off his pacemaker.

124
00:06:07,903 --> 00:06:09,393
Slowed down his heart.

125
00:06:09,443 --> 00:06:11,773
Yeah, well, why didn't you
take him to the hospital?

126
00:06:11,813 --> 00:06:12,933
I mean, I don't think he...

127
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:14,873
Why don't you go
get settled now.

128
00:06:14,913 --> 00:06:17,982
I know you're worried, ma'am,
but he's stable. In fact, he's fine.

129
00:06:18,012 --> 00:06:19,842
Just needs to rest up a bit.
Take it easy.

130
00:06:19,882 --> 00:06:22,058
In the morning, Doris,
you can give his doctor a call.

131
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:24,112
See what he thinks,
but his vitals are solid.

132
00:06:24,152 --> 00:06:25,851
Yeah. I know.

133
00:06:25,891 --> 00:06:28,361
Thank you so much
for coming, Jason.

134
00:06:28,391 --> 00:06:29,981
I really appreciate it.

135
00:06:30,061 --> 00:06:32,191
Has that wife of yours
had the baby yet?

136
00:06:32,231 --> 00:06:34,321
- Two more weeks.
- Oh, good.

137
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:36,960
I gotta tell you girls,
your mother is just a doll.

138
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,260
You. Thanks again.

139
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,316
- You're welcome.
- Hey, can I ask you something?

140
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,300
If you took one of these
say with, like, Aderol.

141
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,500
And you're about 130 pounds.

142
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,339
Could... could you stroke?

143
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:49,809
When's dinner coming?

144
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:52,939
I don't know. Just be patient.

145
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,968
So, you all right? You feeling all right?
You look a little pale there.

146
00:06:56,018 --> 00:06:58,448
You need vitamin D. I read...
You read that report, Donna.

147
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,988
It's not like I'm sick, I'm just
not really into the sun.

148
00:07:01,018 --> 00:07:02,417
So it's like a trend
or something?

149
00:07:02,418 --> 00:07:04,278
I think it's the Goth thing.

150
00:07:04,328 --> 00:07:05,947
No, it's not Goth. I'm not Goth.

151
00:07:05,987 --> 00:07:07,927
But you always wear black.

152
00:07:07,957 --> 00:07:10,003
That's Goth. He's Goth.
Brandon, isn't Elliot Goth?

153
00:07:10,027 --> 00:07:12,273
Oh, god, Donna, do you remember
when he was 12 years old?

154
00:07:12,927 --> 00:07:14,557
Brandon pantsed him,

155
00:07:14,597 --> 00:07:17,726
He was wearing Lynn's
pantyhose under his jeans?

156
00:07:17,766 --> 00:07:19,496
Hysterical!

157
00:07:19,536 --> 00:07:21,296
You don't still do that, do you?

158
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,845
Go from fried chicken
to grilled chicken.

159
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:34,005
- Food's here!
- It's here.

160
00:07:34,055 --> 00:07:36,214
What it is, is global warming.

161
00:07:36,254 --> 00:07:38,400
That's exactly what it is.
I'm telling you right now.

162
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:40,484
The record temperature,
the hottest summer ever.

163
00:07:40,524 --> 00:07:42,324
Was back in the 1950s.

164
00:07:42,354 --> 00:07:44,754
- Tell me how that makes sense.
- Where do you get this?

165
00:07:44,794 --> 00:07:46,224
Actually, since 1880,

166
00:07:46,363 --> 00:07:48,453
Average temperatures around
the world have risen

167
00:07:48,493 --> 00:07:50,223
1.4 degrees Fahrenheit.

168
00:07:50,263 --> 00:07:52,203
What is he? Doogie Howser?

169
00:07:52,233 --> 00:07:54,893
No, because Doogie Howser
was a resident surgeon.

170
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:58,432
I was scared to death when I saw
that ambulance in the driveway.

171
00:07:58,472 --> 00:08:00,842
- He's in bad shape.
- He's not in bad shape.

172
00:08:00,872 --> 00:08:03,741
He just hates sitting around
all day with nothing to do.

173
00:08:03,742 --> 00:08:05,071
But he's a fighter, mother.
He is.

174
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:06,911
Lord knows,
we've been through this before.

175
00:08:06,951 --> 00:08:09,127
You couldn't kill him with
a double barreled shotgun.

176
00:08:09,151 --> 00:08:12,481
The doctor said his heart
only had 30% capacity.

177
00:08:12,521 --> 00:08:13,851
Yeah, but he's in good spirits.

178
00:08:13,891 --> 00:08:14,941
Well, that's good.

179
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,420
Lack of oxygen!

180
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,390
I would just like
to say to everyone,

181
00:08:25,299 --> 00:08:27,959
That I make fantastic Martinis.

182
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:29,589
Sit down.

183
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,329
That's original recipe,
crispy, extra crispy.

184
00:08:46,177 --> 00:08:50,177
Yo, wait until you see
Heather's friends, man.

185
00:08:50,217 --> 00:08:51,917
Dude, your dick
will be dying, son.

186
00:08:51,957 --> 00:08:54,717
It's fucking... fucking fire.

187
00:08:54,787 --> 00:08:57,056
My dick will be dying?

188
00:08:57,096 --> 00:08:59,356
Tell you, man, these bitches
are fucking delish.

189
00:08:59,396 --> 00:09:02,196
Just like top notch, you know?

190
00:09:02,226 --> 00:09:05,785
It's just that pussy
you dream of.

191
00:09:05,835 --> 00:09:08,135
Intriguing.

192
00:09:08,165 --> 00:09:09,695
Hope you don't mind, man.

193
00:09:09,735 --> 00:09:11,725
I keefed the nuggs with
a little bit of llello.

194
00:09:11,775 --> 00:09:13,835
No, it sure as shit
beats the two packs.

195
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:16,804
Of Coricidin cough & cold
I ate last night.

196
00:09:16,874 --> 00:09:19,034
What do you mean Alice isn't
coming until Friday?

197
00:09:19,074 --> 00:09:21,674
Nothing, just that Alice
will be here Friday.

198
00:09:21,714 --> 00:09:23,404
The rehearsal dinner
is on Saturday.

199
00:09:23,444 --> 00:09:27,113
I know that, Bonnie,
but everything will be fine.

200
00:09:27,153 --> 00:09:28,913
Can't she come any earlier?

201
00:09:28,953 --> 00:09:31,113
No, she can't.
She has things to do.

202
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,713
And... and this way,

203
00:09:32,753 --> 00:09:34,693
Lee doesn't have
to drive down tomorrow.

204
00:09:34,763 --> 00:09:37,092
Lee is driving?
I thought he always hired a car.

205
00:09:37,132 --> 00:09:40,252
Bonnie, please. I just got here.

206
00:09:40,292 --> 00:09:42,778
- Don't get all worked up, Lynn.
- I'm not getting worked up.

207
00:09:42,802 --> 00:09:43,803
I'm just asking.

208
00:09:43,872 --> 00:09:45,792
Could we please not
get into a whole thing?

209
00:09:45,831 --> 00:09:47,801
I'm not getting
into a whole thing!

210
00:09:47,841 --> 00:09:49,931
Hey, ladies.
Can't we just get along?

211
00:09:49,971 --> 00:09:51,441
Hey, who was it that said that?

212
00:09:51,471 --> 00:09:54,811
- The guy... the police beating.
- Black guy.

213
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:56,240
He's blind.

214
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,340
Who?

215
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,870
The dog. Pinky bones.

216
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,110
Thank Christ.

217
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,919
What a gift from god.

218
00:10:05,949 --> 00:10:09,679
If the dog could see his outfit,
he'd fucking immolate himself.

219
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:11,689
My mom designed that outfit.

220
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:13,249
She opened up a business.

221
00:10:13,289 --> 00:10:16,058
Well, that's what she said.

222
00:10:16,098 --> 00:10:18,328
I think it's a good idea.
Trying to be supportive.

223
00:10:27,737 --> 00:10:31,767
Oh, this poor dog.

224
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,867
That's fucking fashion.

225
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:37,006
It's a dog, man. That's abusive.

226
00:10:37,046 --> 00:10:38,662
That's what I've always
said about Lynn.

227
00:10:38,686 --> 00:10:40,176
She has to make
everything about her.

228
00:10:40,216 --> 00:10:42,232
And her family and her
problems and their issues.

229
00:10:42,256 --> 00:10:44,086
It's not about her,
it's about Dylan.

230
00:10:44,126 --> 00:10:45,745
It's his wedding.

231
00:10:45,785 --> 00:10:48,395
He wants her at the wedding, right?
He wants Alice at the wedding.

232
00:10:48,425 --> 00:10:51,085
And she has her therapist
so she can talk to Paul.

233
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,995
I mean, who goes to a therapist
to talk to their ex-husband?

234
00:10:54,035 --> 00:10:56,864
I don't know why you ask me
these kinds of questions.

235
00:10:56,934 --> 00:10:58,834
Well, 'cause Elliot's
doctors just wanted...

236
00:10:58,864 --> 00:11:00,424
No, there isn't.

237
00:11:00,474 --> 00:11:04,834
So nobody in your family
had any history of depression,

238
00:11:04,874 --> 00:11:07,063
Or obsessive
compulsive disorder...

239
00:11:07,113 --> 00:11:09,103
- No. No.
- Severe an...

240
00:11:09,143 --> 00:11:11,803
Well, where'd he come from, mom?
The planet Mars?

241
00:11:11,843 --> 00:11:13,903
Oh, maybe so.

242
00:11:13,983 --> 00:11:17,782
But didn't dad's dad
have some kind of a...

243
00:11:17,822 --> 00:11:19,842
Didn't he drink heavily?

244
00:11:19,882 --> 00:11:24,152
Well, yeah,
but that was, you know.

245
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:26,951
Did he die of drinking?

246
00:11:26,991 --> 00:11:29,261
No, of course not.

247
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:33,731
He, um, you know. He...

248
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:35,730
What?

249
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:39,630
He shot himself.

250
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,930
He shot himself?

251
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,340
Yeah.

252
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,430
Well, I'd say that's something.

253
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,969
It was a different time, Lynn.
It was during the depression.

254
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:51,039
A lot of people shot themselves.

255
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:53,609
You know, I wasn't
crazy about Sweden

256
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:57,278
I mean, it was...
it was freezing.

257
00:11:57,318 --> 00:12:00,418
Really? Even in June?

258
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:03,018
Yeah, you know, maybe it was.

259
00:12:03,058 --> 00:12:05,147
Just my preconceived
notions of Sweden.

260
00:12:05,197 --> 00:12:08,257
Pro... probably.

261
00:12:08,297 --> 00:12:10,057
It's probably just
psychosomatic.

262
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:13,367
- I have anxiety.
- Careful.

263
00:12:13,397 --> 00:12:15,126
I'm on medication.

264
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,766
Well, we all know that.

265
00:12:20,946 --> 00:12:24,006
<i>Limited spectrum of our
intellect and what we are.</i>

266
00:12:25,775 --> 00:12:28,875
<i>Our ancestors struggled
and fought and died...</i>

267
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:59,302
Oh, no fucking way.

268
00:12:59,342 --> 00:13:04,682
It's gonna be weird, like,
meeting mom's ex-husband.

269
00:13:04,712 --> 00:13:07,551
I guess so.

270
00:13:07,581 --> 00:13:11,921
I've never even, like,
seen a picture of him before.

271
00:13:11,951 --> 00:13:13,721
I did.

272
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,150
Well, what's he look like?

273
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,160
Kind of generic.

274
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,290
Know who he looked like?
He looked like T.J.

275
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,890
Our old babysitter.

276
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:28,769
But didn't Paul used to be,
like, physically abusive?

277
00:13:30,099 --> 00:13:31,939
Yeah, I think so.

278
00:13:31,969 --> 00:13:37,168
So are you gonna,
like, kick his ass?

279
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:41,078
Ben... Ben, why would
I kick his ass?

280
00:13:41,118 --> 00:13:42,638
I don't know.

281
00:13:42,678 --> 00:13:47,417
'Cause he, like,
used to hit mom and shit?

282
00:13:47,457 --> 00:13:50,247
Yeah.

283
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:53,777
I've hit mom before.

284
00:14:21,314 --> 00:14:24,614
Come on.

285
00:14:27,253 --> 00:14:28,813
Fuck.

286
00:16:31,301 --> 00:16:35,100
Alice, are you sure you feel
strong enough to come down here?

287
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:41,100
No. Okay, okay.

288
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,909
Okay, I'm just asking.

289
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:47,739
No, no, that will be fine.

290
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:53,189
I am just going to talk
to Paul very calmly.

291
00:16:53,219 --> 00:16:56,918
I'm gonna do just what
Dr. Marcus said to.

292
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,048
Why would there be a fight?

293
00:16:59,088 --> 00:17:01,028
It's just going
to be me and Paul.

294
00:17:01,058 --> 00:17:04,588
And that... that therapist
whose profile we saw online.

295
00:17:05,497 --> 00:17:08,957
Don't worry, Alice.

296
00:17:09,997 --> 00:17:12,027
Exactly, exactly.

297
00:17:12,067 --> 00:17:14,767
That's the plan.
That's all. That's the plan.

298
00:17:19,576 --> 00:17:23,036
Jesus fuck.

299
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:26,475
Dude, I gotta drop a deuce!

300
00:17:38,064 --> 00:17:39,894
Oh, shit.

301
00:17:39,924 --> 00:17:44,194
Donna, go ask your father
what he wants for breakfast.

302
00:17:44,234 --> 00:17:46,462
Come on, come on.

303
00:17:46,463 --> 00:17:48,523
Let's go see. Let's go see.

304
00:17:48,573 --> 00:17:50,123
Let's go see what
granddad wants.

305
00:17:50,173 --> 00:17:53,763
- Say hello, granddaddy!
- Oh, hi, baby.

306
00:17:53,803 --> 00:17:56,032
Hey. Daddy, what do you
want for breakfast?

307
00:17:56,072 --> 00:17:58,702
A bowl of life.

308
00:17:58,742 --> 00:18:00,642
Ah, we're all out of life.

309
00:18:00,682 --> 00:18:02,082
Oh.

310
00:18:02,112 --> 00:18:04,412
Are you crying?

311
00:18:04,452 --> 00:18:08,111
- No, no, no. That, it's...
- are you sure?

312
00:18:08,151 --> 00:18:09,981
Yes.

313
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:14,511
Okay, well, what do you
want for breakfast?

314
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:18,590
Pancakes. Well done.

315
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:22,500
Okay, come on.
Who's a stinky pinky?

316
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:26,489
Say I'm a stinky pinky.
Boo-do-boo-do-boo. Yay.

317
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:28,159
I think daddy's been crying.

318
00:18:28,209 --> 00:18:30,109
Was he watching
"The Price is Right"?

319
00:18:30,139 --> 00:18:31,609
Yeah.

320
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:34,529
It's that darn home
defibrillator.

321
00:18:34,579 --> 00:18:36,668
Commercial they always play.

322
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,808
It just makes him so emotional.

323
00:18:38,848 --> 00:18:40,708
Did he say what he
wants for breakfast?

324
00:18:40,748 --> 00:18:44,708
Delicious. Mmmm.
Yeah, pancakes. Well done.

325
00:18:44,758 --> 00:18:46,747
Have you eaten?

326
00:18:46,787 --> 00:18:48,717
No, I have to go get ready.

327
00:18:48,757 --> 00:18:50,117
For what?

328
00:18:50,157 --> 00:18:53,127
I'm... I'm gonna go see Paul.

329
00:18:53,157 --> 00:18:56,026
Oh. I just don't get it.

330
00:18:56,066 --> 00:18:58,656
What don't you get, mom?

331
00:18:58,696 --> 00:19:00,826
I think you're just
asking for trouble.

332
00:19:00,866 --> 00:19:03,426
I don't understand why we
can't just have a nice time.

333
00:19:03,466 --> 00:19:04,935
Mom, l...

334
00:19:04,975 --> 00:19:07,065
You always have to stir
the pot, don't you?

335
00:19:15,514 --> 00:19:17,004
What're you doing
in my bathroom?

336
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:18,514
I was just dropping a deuce.

337
00:19:18,554 --> 00:19:20,044
- A what?
- A deuce.

338
00:19:20,084 --> 00:19:21,954
Like, deuce deuce,
which is, like,

339
00:19:21,984 --> 00:19:24,454
Gangsta rap for tony 2 pistol,

340
00:19:24,494 --> 00:19:27,513
But subtract one deuce
and you just get 2?

341
00:19:27,563 --> 00:19:30,323
Like, the number?

342
00:19:30,363 --> 00:19:32,423
Dropping a number 2?

343
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:33,933
Taking a poop?

344
00:19:33,963 --> 00:19:35,722
What is wrong with you?

345
00:19:35,762 --> 00:19:36,992
Well, I was diagnosed with...

346
00:19:37,032 --> 00:19:39,092
I know what you were
diagnosed with, Ben.

347
00:19:39,132 --> 00:19:41,302
I'm your mother.

348
00:19:46,111 --> 00:19:49,941
Is it my genes? Is it my...

349
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:53,001
Am I a bad mother?

350
00:19:53,051 --> 00:19:56,020
Well, actually,
I was thinking about it,

351
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:59,950
And both Elliot
and I have problems,

352
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,080
So I was wondering if it was
dad's genes, you know?

353
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,560
But then Alice is
also fucked up, so...

354
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,749
Don't cuss, Ben.

355
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:07,779
Sorry, I won't, but, like,

356
00:20:07,859 --> 00:20:11,799
The only one who
is normal is Dylan.

357
00:20:11,829 --> 00:20:15,388
And you didn't raise
him, like, at all.

358
00:20:15,468 --> 00:20:18,128
So I concluded that
it must be you.

359
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:21,468
'Cause, like, you're the
only common denominator.

360
00:20:27,547 --> 00:20:29,207
I love you so much.

361
00:20:29,247 --> 00:20:31,877
Come here. Give me hug.

362
00:20:34,717 --> 00:20:36,086
Did you wash your hands?

363
00:20:36,116 --> 00:20:38,556
Mmm-hmm.

364
00:20:38,586 --> 00:20:41,956
Okay, go ahead.

365
00:20:52,905 --> 00:20:54,994
I'm... I'm on my way now.

366
00:20:55,034 --> 00:20:59,594
- Bye. Uh-huh.
- Bye.

367
00:20:59,644 --> 00:21:03,514
Ben, will you come take these
to your grandfather, please?

368
00:21:15,552 --> 00:21:18,952
You know this whole
well done pancake thing,

369
00:21:18,992 --> 00:21:21,652
It's just been in the
last two weeks.

370
00:21:21,692 --> 00:21:25,061
His whole life, he liked
them golden and fluffy.

371
00:21:25,101 --> 00:21:28,431
Now he wants them blacker than
the lady on the syrup bottle.

372
00:21:28,471 --> 00:21:31,901
Mom, you are such
a southern girl.

373
00:21:31,941 --> 00:21:33,871
Don't tell anyone I said that.

374
00:21:33,901 --> 00:21:37,470
Whatever, you're, like, twice
as old as civil rights anyway.

375
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,540
Just take a tile, Donna.

376
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,980
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

377
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,610
So was granddaddy still crying
when you went in there?

378
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:47,779
I don't know. He wasn't there.

379
00:22:07,667 --> 00:22:11,797
All right, blood.
Come on to the head.

380
00:22:12,037 --> 00:22:14,097
Granddad?

381
00:22:14,137 --> 00:22:15,696
Granddad's not here.

382
00:22:15,746 --> 00:22:16,747
Whatever.

383
00:22:31,495 --> 00:22:33,655
Daddy, you in here?

384
00:22:40,264 --> 00:22:42,094
Oh.

385
00:22:44,134 --> 00:22:45,463
Sorry.

386
00:22:45,503 --> 00:22:47,443
Okay, sorry.

387
00:22:50,743 --> 00:22:52,573
Hello, Lynn. I'm Dr. Stanwyck.

388
00:22:52,613 --> 00:22:54,373
It's nice to meet you.

389
00:22:54,413 --> 00:22:55,413
Come on in.

390
00:22:55,414 --> 00:22:56,415
Thanks.

391
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,576
- Hello, Lynn.
- Hey.

392
00:22:57,582 --> 00:22:59,482
- You look great.
- Thank you.

393
00:22:59,512 --> 00:23:00,782
Hi, Lynn.

394
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:02,712
Hi. I didn't realize that...

395
00:23:02,752 --> 00:23:05,981
Of course, don't be silly.
Why wouldn't I be here?

396
00:23:06,021 --> 00:23:09,351
You did say that this
was a family crisis.

397
00:23:09,391 --> 00:23:10,861
Yeah, I told Paul
it was pressing.

398
00:23:10,921 --> 00:23:12,411
Exactly.

399
00:23:12,461 --> 00:23:14,651
Let's all sit down.

400
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:22,500
So as Lynn explained
to me over the phone,

401
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,299
Your son, Dylan...

402
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,069
Our son. Our son.

403
00:23:26,109 --> 00:23:28,299
Right, right. I understand.

404
00:23:28,339 --> 00:23:31,609
Dylan and Alice are the
children you and Paul had, Lynn.

405
00:23:31,649 --> 00:23:33,769
Now, Dylan has asked Alice.

406
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:36,278
To be the maid of honor
at his wedding, Sunday.

407
00:23:36,318 --> 00:23:37,748
Is that right so far?

408
00:23:37,788 --> 00:23:39,688
- Yes.
- That's right, that's right.

409
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:43,658
And, um, Alice...

410
00:23:43,718 --> 00:23:45,947
It's not a very easy time
for her right now.

411
00:23:45,987 --> 00:23:48,387
So, I was thinking that
it'd be a good idea.

412
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:52,687
If Paul and I could, um,

413
00:23:52,727 --> 00:23:55,666
Talk through some issues
before she came down on Friday.

414
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:59,496
Daddy!

415
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:04,236
Daddy!

416
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:07,435
Where are you?

417
00:24:07,475 --> 00:24:09,175
How is any of this my fault?

418
00:24:09,845 --> 00:24:12,675
I haven't seen or spoken
to my daughter in 7 years.

419
00:24:12,715 --> 00:24:15,304
And I have no clue as to why.

420
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:17,614
- It's not what I wanted.
- No, it's what Alice wanted.

421
00:24:17,654 --> 00:24:20,384
Is that really what Alice wanted
or is that what you wanted?

422
00:24:20,424 --> 00:24:23,300
You haven't made any effort.
To make it any better over last 7 years.

423
00:24:23,524 --> 00:24:25,013
If that's even the truth,

424
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:27,683
Then I will ask Alice
to explain it to me.

425
00:24:27,723 --> 00:24:29,953
Because I wanna start
resolving this once and for all.

426
00:24:29,993 --> 00:24:31,763
And put it behind us.

427
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:35,532
No, that is exactly what I'm
trying to get you not to do.

428
00:24:35,572 --> 00:24:38,432
Lynn...

429
00:24:38,472 --> 00:24:39,872
Not speak with his daughter?

430
00:24:39,902 --> 00:24:41,272
Is this some sort of scheme.

431
00:24:41,342 --> 00:24:43,742
To get me down here to tell me.

432
00:24:43,772 --> 00:24:47,571
That I can't speak to my own
daughter at my son's wedding?

433
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,881
Maybe this isn't for you
to decide anymore.

434
00:24:49,911 --> 00:24:51,881
Maybe that's what
you're afraid of.

435
00:24:51,921 --> 00:24:53,911
I mean, Alice is old enough
to decide herself.

436
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,580
That's right.

437
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,590
This is between me
and Alice, Lynn.

438
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,280
It doesn't concern you.

439
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,480
Patty, seriously,

440
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,290
This has absolutely nothing
to do with you.

441
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:04,590
I think this has everything
to do with me.

442
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:05,631
I am her stepmother.

443
00:25:05,659 --> 00:25:07,149
How could you be her stepmother.

444
00:25:07,199 --> 00:25:09,389
When she doesn't even
consider him her father?

445
00:25:09,429 --> 00:25:10,799
- Well, he is.
- No, he isn't.

446
00:25:10,829 --> 00:25:11,929
- Yes, he is.
- Yes, I am.

447
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,629
No, you're not.

448
00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:16,938
Being a father entails
certain responsibilities.

449
00:25:16,968 --> 00:25:18,208
Yeah, so does being a mother.

450
00:25:18,238 --> 00:25:19,638
Okay, everybody, look.

451
00:25:19,678 --> 00:25:22,408
I understand this is an
emotionally charged issue,

452
00:25:22,448 --> 00:25:26,377
But let's try to stay
on course here.

453
00:25:26,417 --> 00:25:29,817
I don't think Lynn means to say
that what Alice is going through.

454
00:25:29,847 --> 00:25:31,216
Is your fault, Paul.

455
00:25:31,217 --> 00:25:32,647
Fine.

456
00:25:32,687 --> 00:25:34,533
But I should be able
to talk to my daughter...

457
00:25:34,557 --> 00:25:35,687
Yes, you should.

458
00:25:35,726 --> 00:25:37,986
About whatever's
going on in her life.

459
00:25:38,026 --> 00:25:39,996
If my daughter is going through.

460
00:25:40,026 --> 00:25:42,616
Some sort of self-destructive
phase then I want to he...

461
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,855
Wait, what, what?
You think this is a phase?

462
00:25:45,895 --> 00:25:48,365
- That's not what he said.
- That's exactly what he said!

463
00:25:48,405 --> 00:25:50,425
It's not what he meant.

464
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:52,435
I'm just trying
to protect my daughter.

465
00:25:52,475 --> 00:25:53,525
- From who?
- From what?

466
00:25:53,575 --> 00:25:54,974
From you!

467
00:25:55,004 --> 00:25:57,204
- What did he...?
- I just explained it to you!

468
00:25:57,244 --> 00:26:01,074
You just so enjoy trying
to tear this family apart.

469
00:26:01,114 --> 00:26:02,774
Isn't that what
this is all about?

470
00:26:02,814 --> 00:26:05,213
So that's his story now?

471
00:26:05,253 --> 00:26:07,373
Is that the story you tell
everybody, Paul?

472
00:26:07,413 --> 00:26:10,913
That I wanted to leave
alone with my daughter.

473
00:26:10,953 --> 00:26:12,923
And not raise my son.

474
00:26:12,953 --> 00:26:16,452
Is that what you told her when
you were crying on her shoulder?

475
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:18,522
Did you leave out the part.

476
00:26:18,592 --> 00:26:20,922
Where you said, go, Lynn, go?

477
00:26:20,962 --> 00:26:22,902
Go and take Alice.

478
00:26:22,932 --> 00:26:26,761
But if you take Dylan,
I'll take both your kids.

479
00:26:26,801 --> 00:26:28,947
- What else did you leave out?
- All I know is that...

480
00:26:28,971 --> 00:26:30,641
I love my daughter.

481
00:26:30,671 --> 00:26:33,271
And apparently,
she doesn't know that, Lynn,

482
00:26:33,311 --> 00:26:35,430
And I don't understand it.

483
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,810
I don't understand that.

484
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,840
I don't give a fuck
what you understand,

485
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,679
Because what I know
is that my daughter.

486
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,679
Has been silently slicing
at her arms and legs.

487
00:26:45,719 --> 00:26:48,349
With a straight-edged
razor for six years.

488
00:26:48,389 --> 00:26:50,859
A straight-edged razor!

489
00:26:50,889 --> 00:26:55,518
Now what don't you understand,
you solipsistic fuck?

490
00:26:57,298 --> 00:26:59,628
Daddy?

491
00:26:59,668 --> 00:27:01,568
Daddy?

492
00:27:01,598 --> 00:27:03,568
Scared.

493
00:27:03,598 --> 00:27:06,566
Daddy?

494
00:27:06,567 --> 00:27:10,237
Oh, daddy. Oh, my god.

495
00:27:10,277 --> 00:27:11,637
Daddy.

496
00:27:14,747 --> 00:27:17,376
What the hell are
you doing out here?

497
00:27:17,416 --> 00:27:19,816
Don't say that word.

498
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:22,686
Third time in a month.

499
00:27:22,716 --> 00:27:25,845
I just can't take it anymore.

500
00:27:25,885 --> 00:27:27,685
Are you filming this?

501
00:27:27,725 --> 00:27:28,785
Um...

502
00:27:28,825 --> 00:27:30,725
Oh.

503
00:27:30,755 --> 00:27:34,695
You're treating me
like an animal.

504
00:27:34,735 --> 00:27:37,854
Well, that's what's going on.

505
00:27:37,894 --> 00:27:41,134
It's either this, daddy,
or the old folks home.

506
00:27:41,164 --> 00:27:43,224
You make the choice. Okay.

507
00:27:43,274 --> 00:27:44,893
Okay, boys lift it.

508
00:27:44,943 --> 00:27:47,603
I'm not an animal.

509
00:27:49,873 --> 00:27:52,273
She's running a little late.

510
00:27:52,313 --> 00:27:54,453
I hope you're ready because
we have so much planned.

511
00:27:54,483 --> 00:27:56,883
Brandon. How you doing, buddy?

512
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:20,270
Heather looks beautiful.
She lost a lot of weight.

513
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,860
Yeah. She looks great.

514
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,669
I saw Paul today.

515
00:28:25,709 --> 00:28:29,409
Dad told me. How'd it go?

516
00:28:29,449 --> 00:28:30,669
Oh, it went very well.

517
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,269
I think we're really
making progress.

518
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:34,009
Yeah. Really?

519
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:37,678
Well, doesn't he look wonderful?

520
00:28:37,718 --> 00:28:39,688
How long has it been
since you've seen him?

521
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,988
- Six months?
- Four months.

522
00:28:42,028 --> 00:28:45,457
Six months. Well.

523
00:28:45,497 --> 00:28:48,227
I'm glad that at least you have
this little bit of time.

524
00:28:48,267 --> 00:28:49,987
To spend with your mother.

525
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:57,436
Shit.

526
00:28:57,466 --> 00:29:01,496
Patty keeps asking me if I'm
gonna walk her to her seat.

527
00:29:01,546 --> 00:29:05,405
Oh. Absolutely.
I understand completely.

528
00:29:05,445 --> 00:29:09,114
Are you kidding me?

529
00:29:09,115 --> 00:29:11,175
You're my mother.

530
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:18,614
Ugh. I bet she has something
ridiculous like a vibrator.

531
00:29:18,654 --> 00:29:20,800
On the bed or something
ridiculous, she's disgusting.

532
00:29:20,824 --> 00:29:22,754
Listen, listen.
So I open the bathroom door,

533
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:26,783
And I find Elliot in the buff,

534
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:28,853
Completely naked...

535
00:29:30,203 --> 00:29:31,823
Putting on Lynn's lipstick.

536
00:29:46,481 --> 00:29:47,711
Hey. What's up?

537
00:29:47,751 --> 00:29:50,841
Just bonding with family.

538
00:29:50,921 --> 00:29:52,481
But they're all over there.

539
00:29:52,521 --> 00:29:53,781
Yes, Ben. I realize that.

540
00:29:53,821 --> 00:29:56,089
Thank you.

541
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:59,290
So, uh, what're you doing then?

542
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:02,230
Nothing, Ben.

543
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:06,219
I'm doing absolutely nothing.

544
00:30:06,269 --> 00:30:07,729
Does everyone seem
happy out there?

545
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:10,399
Yeah, of course, dad.

546
00:30:10,439 --> 00:30:13,108
Um, the grass.

547
00:30:13,109 --> 00:30:15,728
Does it seem a bit
overgrown to you?

548
00:30:15,778 --> 00:30:17,208
No, not at all.

549
00:30:17,238 --> 00:30:18,468
Landscapers do a great job.

550
00:30:18,508 --> 00:30:19,924
You don't have to
worry about that.

551
00:30:19,948 --> 00:30:21,208
It's my property.

552
00:30:21,248 --> 00:30:23,678
I feel like I should be
taking care of it myself.

553
00:30:23,718 --> 00:30:27,517
Yeah, but it's a good thing
that you don't have to, right?

554
00:30:30,387 --> 00:30:34,717
You know that Elliot hasn't
even said a word to me?

555
00:30:34,757 --> 00:30:36,556
What?

556
00:30:36,596 --> 00:30:39,786
Didn't even say hello.

557
00:30:39,826 --> 00:30:41,626
You know Elliot's...

558
00:30:41,666 --> 00:30:42,895
Elliot's having a tough time.

559
00:30:42,896 --> 00:30:45,695
17 is not an easy age.

560
00:30:45,735 --> 00:30:49,535
I don't understand what's
so tough about his life.

561
00:30:49,575 --> 00:30:50,795
He's a good looking kid,

562
00:30:50,835 --> 00:30:52,735
You got all the money
in the world,

563
00:30:52,775 --> 00:30:54,435
And he goes to all
the best schools.

564
00:30:54,475 --> 00:30:56,234
He gets thrown out
of the best schools, dad.

565
00:30:56,274 --> 00:30:58,744
You guys are just too
lenient with him.

566
00:30:58,784 --> 00:31:01,514
You don't discipline him enough.

567
00:31:01,554 --> 00:31:03,844
He has to have
some consequences.

568
00:31:03,884 --> 00:31:06,722
Okay, we do discipline him.

569
00:31:06,723 --> 00:31:11,052
Elliot has a chemical imbalance
in his brain.

570
00:31:11,053 --> 00:31:12,393
It's real.

571
00:31:12,423 --> 00:31:13,623
He has depression,

572
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:15,562
Obsessive compulsive disorder,

573
00:31:15,592 --> 00:31:17,752
He has Tourette's
syndrome for god's sake.

574
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:20,092
He suffers from severe anxiety.

575
00:31:20,132 --> 00:31:22,532
And he has difficulty
managing his emotions.

576
00:31:25,441 --> 00:31:28,301
Now he's in therapy
and he's doing much better.

577
00:31:30,611 --> 00:31:33,541
If you say so, baby.

578
00:31:33,581 --> 00:31:36,440
<i>Hello, Tiffany.
Are you over the shock yet?</i>

579
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,500
<i>I am. Ready to play?</i>

580
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,740
<i>I am, thank you.</i>

581
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,410
<i>Okay, I wanna start you off...</i>

582
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:42,180
<i>They're slashing
regular health care.</i>

583
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,280
<i>Like cancer surgery
or having a broken leg fixed...</i>

584
00:31:47,259 --> 00:31:50,949
Did you see the girl,
remember Brandon was talking to?

585
00:31:54,699 --> 00:31:57,168
Life is just
closing in on you, Dylan.

586
00:31:57,198 --> 00:31:59,828
No. No. She's cool.

587
00:31:59,868 --> 00:32:02,998
What? You're just gonna keep
saying it over and over again?

588
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:04,528
You know this isn't Peter Pan.

589
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,383
We can all clap our hands
and say we believe,

590
00:32:06,407 --> 00:32:08,437
But it still doesn't mean
you're gonna enjoy.

591
00:32:08,477 --> 00:32:11,177
Only having sex with Tinkerbell
for the rest of your life.

592
00:32:12,077 --> 00:32:13,137
Tinkerbell's hot, man.

593
00:32:13,177 --> 00:32:14,617
Tinkerbell's very small.

594
00:32:14,647 --> 00:32:16,476
Oh, yeah, yeah.

595
00:32:16,516 --> 00:32:18,106
What're you doing later tonight?

596
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:19,655
- I don't know.
- I don't know, man.

597
00:32:19,656 --> 00:32:22,016
Maybe I'll have a drinking
contest with granddad.

598
00:32:22,086 --> 00:32:24,456
You know, every time
there's a Fox news alert.

599
00:32:24,486 --> 00:32:26,185
We could throw back
a shot of prune juice.

600
00:32:26,225 --> 00:32:28,785
- First to shit loses.
- All right, all right.

601
00:32:28,825 --> 00:32:30,125
Think I'll win?

602
00:32:30,165 --> 00:32:32,155
Well, if you fucking
get bored of that...

603
00:32:32,195 --> 00:32:34,355
- lmpossible.
- We're gonna go to a party.

604
00:32:34,395 --> 00:32:35,664
- Oooh.
- You should come.

605
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:37,034
Yeah, good deal.

606
00:32:37,104 --> 00:32:38,750
I should tell my mom,
but she'll be cool.

607
00:32:38,774 --> 00:32:40,174
Yeah, we're gonna get out.

608
00:32:40,204 --> 00:32:42,803
We'll fucking roll out of here
in, like, 20 minutes, so.

609
00:32:42,804 --> 00:32:45,489
I should probably take a shower.
I haven't showered in a week.

610
00:32:45,513 --> 00:32:47,743
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Take a shower. You know.

611
00:32:47,773 --> 00:32:49,643
You know, um...

612
00:32:49,683 --> 00:32:51,583
You know, wash that hair
and, uh,

613
00:32:51,613 --> 00:32:53,673
Throw on a little bit
of mommy's lipstick.

614
00:32:53,713 --> 00:32:58,082
Whatever it is that you need to
do to get ready for the night.

615
00:32:58,122 --> 00:32:59,782
Look there's...

616
00:32:59,822 --> 00:33:01,722
There's a lot more
to that though.

617
00:33:01,762 --> 00:33:03,222
Just fucking with you.

618
00:33:03,262 --> 00:33:05,661
You'll get a kick out
of the real story.

619
00:33:05,691 --> 00:33:08,061
I'm just fucking with you, man.
I'm not trying to...

620
00:33:08,091 --> 00:33:09,581
Just sayin'.

621
00:33:11,701 --> 00:33:16,070
Whatever it is you like
to do, do it.

622
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,400
You made a very big mistake.

623
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,000
Who're you talking to?

624
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,300
Your father.

625
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,740
Oh, cool.

626
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:25,299
So, listen, I'm thinking
I'm going to go out.

627
00:33:25,349 --> 00:33:27,399
With Brandon later.

628
00:33:27,449 --> 00:33:31,469
Lee, let me call you
back in a minute.

629
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,709
Nope. It's 10 P.M.

630
00:33:34,249 --> 00:33:35,448
So?

631
00:33:36,288 --> 00:33:38,308
What do you mean, so?

632
00:33:38,358 --> 00:33:40,548
Well, I mean why can't I go?

633
00:33:41,088 --> 00:33:42,458
Because I said so.

634
00:33:42,498 --> 00:33:44,628
Because Brandon
is five years older.

635
00:33:45,267 --> 00:33:47,997
And I don't like you
hanging out with him.

636
00:33:48,027 --> 00:33:50,057
So what am I supposed to do?

637
00:33:50,097 --> 00:33:52,157
Sit around and play
fucking rummy cube.

638
00:33:52,207 --> 00:33:54,437
With your demented family?

639
00:33:55,476 --> 00:33:58,166
You could spend some time
with your grandfather.

640
00:33:58,206 --> 00:34:01,266
Oh, great. Yeah.
The guy's a fucking zombie.

641
00:34:02,716 --> 00:34:04,945
Don't be so mean, Elliot.

642
00:34:04,975 --> 00:34:06,275
Oh, well, sorry, mom.

643
00:34:06,315 --> 00:34:08,175
He watches Fox news
while he sleeps.

644
00:34:08,215 --> 00:34:10,375
That's like the textbook
definition of zombie.

645
00:34:17,624 --> 00:34:19,994
Have you been drinking?

646
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:22,894
No. Of course not.

647
00:34:25,403 --> 00:34:28,093
Have you been doing
any drugs with Brandon?

648
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:32,303
No. I fucking promise.

649
00:34:32,343 --> 00:34:34,463
Don't lie to me, Elliot.

650
00:34:34,503 --> 00:34:36,732
I'm not lying to you, mom.

651
00:34:36,772 --> 00:34:38,402
Then why are you acting out?

652
00:34:38,442 --> 00:34:41,102
I'm not acting out.

653
00:34:42,452 --> 00:34:45,381
Elliot, I swear to god,

654
00:34:45,421 --> 00:34:46,941
If you have relapsed,

655
00:34:47,021 --> 00:34:49,421
You're going right back
to Silver Hill.

656
00:34:49,451 --> 00:34:51,251
I can't take any more chances.

657
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:52,981
I'm not! Mom!

658
00:34:53,021 --> 00:34:56,120
Just stop being such
a fucking bitch!

659
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,180
Don't talk to me that way!

660
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,160
Then stop accusing me
of shit I didn't do!

661
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,600
Okay, just lower your voice.

662
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:08,029
Why do you gotta be
such a fucking bitch?

663
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:09,539
What the fuck is your problem?

664
00:35:09,569 --> 00:35:12,169
Elliot, back away.

665
00:35:12,209 --> 00:35:14,255
- Why? I'm not doing anything.
- Just back away now.

666
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:15,325
Elliot, please.

667
00:35:15,348 --> 00:35:17,138
- I'm not doing anything.
- Just back away.

668
00:35:17,178 --> 00:35:20,008
- You fucking cunt!
- No, no, no!

669
00:35:28,357 --> 00:35:31,157
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick,

670
00:35:31,187 --> 00:35:34,357
Jack go under the limbo stick.

671
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:43,036
Yo, bachelor party.

672
00:35:43,066 --> 00:35:45,055
Shit's gonna be off the ho-ok.

673
00:35:45,105 --> 00:35:47,695
Oh, my bad, my bad.

674
00:35:47,735 --> 00:35:49,225
Not cool.

675
00:35:49,275 --> 00:35:51,135
Yo, where'd that
nigga Elliot go?

676
00:35:51,175 --> 00:35:56,404
It's just so scary.
Doesn't it scare you?

677
00:35:56,444 --> 00:36:00,044
Are you even aware of it
when it's happening?

678
00:36:00,084 --> 00:36:02,274
Yeah, but it's like...

679
00:36:02,324 --> 00:36:04,554
It's like this
switch gets flipped.

680
00:36:04,584 --> 00:36:07,493
And something snaps
inside of me and l...

681
00:36:09,663 --> 00:36:11,453
And...

682
00:36:11,493 --> 00:36:15,192
Well, where does it come from?

683
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:20,222
Because your reactions
to things are so extreme.

684
00:36:20,272 --> 00:36:23,132
It's just not normal.

685
00:36:23,172 --> 00:36:26,611
It's like...

686
00:36:26,641 --> 00:36:31,101
The moment I get here,
I'm forced to lie.

687
00:36:31,141 --> 00:36:34,481
Lie about being
in fucking Sweden.

688
00:36:34,511 --> 00:36:36,210
And, you know,

689
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:39,240
Trying to hide the fact
that I have fucking issues.

690
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:42,780
So you can't...
you can't escape.

691
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:45,589
I know.

692
00:36:45,629 --> 00:36:48,319
Like they only see you
in these stages.

693
00:36:48,389 --> 00:36:51,559
These intermittent
stages of your life,

694
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,359
Which are usually embarrassing.

695
00:36:53,399 --> 00:36:56,658
Because growing up
fucking sucks.

696
00:36:56,698 --> 00:36:58,298
They just cling on to them.

697
00:36:58,338 --> 00:37:02,538
And bring them up
whenever you're around.

698
00:37:05,377 --> 00:37:08,967
That's because
that's all they have.

699
00:37:09,017 --> 00:37:12,347
They don't know you, Elliot.

700
00:37:12,387 --> 00:37:16,616
So, it's just like, the only
thing that ties us together.

701
00:37:16,656 --> 00:37:20,886
Are these horrible, fucking
moments of our lives.

702
00:37:20,956 --> 00:37:24,186
I mean shit you wish had
never happened.

703
00:37:24,226 --> 00:37:26,385
It's like everything
you're trying to avoid.

704
00:37:26,425 --> 00:37:29,555
You don't want Alice
to come here.

705
00:37:29,595 --> 00:37:32,585
And deal with all the traumatic
shit of her childhood.

706
00:37:32,635 --> 00:37:35,004
And you're trying
to explain to them.

707
00:37:35,034 --> 00:37:37,594
That this could be really
fucking detrimental.

708
00:37:37,634 --> 00:37:40,034
But they don't understand.

709
00:37:40,074 --> 00:37:41,934
They never will.

710
00:37:43,174 --> 00:37:46,473
So you drive yourself crazy,

711
00:37:46,513 --> 00:37:49,543
Alice cuts herself and I just...

712
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:54,243
Turn into fucking Glenn Beck.

713
00:38:02,492 --> 00:38:05,831
So...

714
00:38:05,861 --> 00:38:08,461
Are you gonna tell
dad about this?

715
00:38:10,601 --> 00:38:14,970
Yeah, I have to.

716
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:00,490
It's exactly where
it's supposed to be.

717
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:04,270
I'm Lynn Hellman.

718
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,529
Uh, hi. Foreman Fred.

719
00:40:06,569 --> 00:40:09,039
May I help you with anything?

720
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:10,909
Well, not unless
you have a solution.

721
00:40:10,939 --> 00:40:12,909
On how to get a twelve foot
stake into the ground.

722
00:40:12,949 --> 00:40:15,808
Without damaging
the irrigation system.

723
00:40:15,878 --> 00:40:17,978
Did you just wake up?

724
00:40:18,018 --> 00:40:20,138
No.

725
00:40:20,188 --> 00:40:22,787
You know, I was just thinking
that maybe the tent.

726
00:40:22,788 --> 00:40:24,218
Wasn't in the right position.

727
00:40:24,258 --> 00:40:27,887
That maybe if we move it
and if you face it this way...

728
00:40:27,927 --> 00:40:31,057
We, Lynn, um, spent a lot of
time with Dylan and Heather.

729
00:40:31,097 --> 00:40:32,827
Going over all this.

730
00:40:32,867 --> 00:40:34,673
I'm sure they would've
appreciated your input.

731
00:40:34,697 --> 00:40:36,957
About a month ago,
but irregardless,

732
00:40:36,996 --> 00:40:39,196
I think that Fred and I've
got it covered, don't we?

733
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:40,796
We certainly do.

734
00:40:40,866 --> 00:40:43,066
Of course, I have taken
orders from this little lady.

735
00:40:43,106 --> 00:40:45,235
For how many years?

736
00:40:45,275 --> 00:40:46,905
- 15 years?
- Oh, Jesus.

737
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,375
Am I getting old?

738
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:50,505
You, on the other hand,
you haven't aged a day.

739
00:40:50,545 --> 00:40:52,521
Well, you know I'm not gonna
ever let you see me.

740
00:40:52,545 --> 00:40:54,145
Without my full fluff and fold.

741
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:56,414
And a mighty fine
fluff and fold it is.

742
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:59,884
Oh, you. You are a sweetheart.

743
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:01,884
You're gonna get me
in trouble with Paul.

744
00:41:01,924 --> 00:41:05,483
I think this pollen
is giving me a migraine now.

745
00:41:05,523 --> 00:41:08,183
I'm just gonna go inside.
Go inside.

746
00:41:08,223 --> 00:41:10,039
Well I'll make sure
and share your thoughts.

747
00:41:10,063 --> 00:41:11,293
With Heather and Dylan.

748
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:12,953
I know they'll appreciate it.

749
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:14,962
Donna. Donna!

750
00:41:15,032 --> 00:41:16,402
Donna?

751
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,902
- Like that hat, Donna!
- Thank you, thank you.

752
00:41:18,942 --> 00:41:22,302
I can not the way she just
waltzed on to our property.

753
00:41:22,342 --> 00:41:24,242
Somebody had to help
Heather with the wedding.

754
00:41:24,272 --> 00:41:25,902
- Her mother has lupus.
- It's not lupus.

755
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:28,311
She says it's lupus.
It's chronic fatigue.

756
00:41:28,341 --> 00:41:29,971
We all know what that's about.

757
00:41:30,011 --> 00:41:31,881
Whatever it is,
she can't help at all.

758
00:41:31,911 --> 00:41:34,081
It's just so sad. Poor Heather.

759
00:41:34,121 --> 00:41:36,180
Paul's company put up
the entire tent for free.

760
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,880
Saved her family a fortune.

761
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,010
All that flirting is so
inappropriate.

762
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:44,460
And that... and that...
that tarzan outfit.

763
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:46,859
Lynn, you're wearing a robe.

764
00:41:46,899 --> 00:41:48,889
- I just woke up.
- Oh.

765
00:41:48,929 --> 00:41:50,519
I had a horrible night's sleep.

766
00:41:50,569 --> 00:41:52,859
Don't get defensive.
No one cares.

767
00:41:52,899 --> 00:41:56,388
No one cares.

768
00:41:56,438 --> 00:42:00,838
Do you think Alice,
like, might wanna kill herself?

769
00:42:00,878 --> 00:42:02,868
No, of course not.

770
00:42:02,908 --> 00:42:05,237
But, like, one day
do you think she'll...

771
00:42:05,277 --> 00:42:09,217
No, Ben. No.

772
00:42:09,247 --> 00:42:12,217
She's gonna be fine.

773
00:42:12,257 --> 00:42:13,567
I guess.

774
00:42:15,286 --> 00:42:16,876
No, totally.

775
00:42:20,326 --> 00:42:22,416
All right?

776
00:42:22,466 --> 00:42:24,955
I was wondering,

777
00:42:24,995 --> 00:42:28,055
Do you think autistic
people know they're autistic?

778
00:42:30,105 --> 00:42:32,465
I think it depends
on how severe it is,

779
00:42:32,505 --> 00:42:37,064
But in most cases, I imagine so.

780
00:42:37,104 --> 00:42:39,264
Yeah, because,

781
00:42:39,314 --> 00:42:42,434
I know I was diagnosed with,
like, mild Asperger's syndrome,

782
00:42:42,484 --> 00:42:45,383
But I didn't think
I was autistic.

783
00:42:45,413 --> 00:42:50,873
No, you're definitely not.
Why? Did someone say that?

784
00:42:50,923 --> 00:42:52,713
Yeah.

785
00:42:52,793 --> 00:42:55,852
Donna was talking about
it to Bonnie and grandma.

786
00:42:55,892 --> 00:42:57,522
With you in the room?

787
00:42:57,562 --> 00:42:59,122
Yeah, but they were whispering.

788
00:42:59,162 --> 00:43:01,222
They didn't know I could hear.

789
00:43:01,262 --> 00:43:03,692
But I've got, like,
amazing hearing.

790
00:43:03,732 --> 00:43:08,721
I mean, like, I could
hear shit below 20 Hertz.

791
00:43:08,771 --> 00:43:10,701
I just don't understand.

792
00:43:10,741 --> 00:43:13,331
Why you have to redesign
the whole dress.

793
00:43:13,371 --> 00:43:15,200
I'm just putting
sleeves on it, mom.

794
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,300
It's not that big a deal.

795
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,310
Maybe not to you.

796
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:21,070
What's that supposed to mean?

797
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:23,719
All I'm saying is that
I think that Alice.

798
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,449
Would like to fit in
with the rest of the party.

799
00:43:26,489 --> 00:43:28,849
Rather than standing out
like a sore thumb.

800
00:43:35,188 --> 00:43:38,058
Okay, you know what?
This is not up for debate.

801
00:43:38,098 --> 00:43:40,068
Now don't get all
huffy and puffy.

802
00:43:40,098 --> 00:43:41,758
I'm not getting
all huffy and puffy.

803
00:43:41,798 --> 00:43:44,498
Now, you're in a state.
Am I right?

804
00:43:51,507 --> 00:43:55,106
Hello? Oh, hi, Paul.

805
00:43:55,146 --> 00:43:57,116
Oh, it's fantastic.

806
00:43:57,146 --> 00:43:59,946
We're all so
excited around here.

807
00:43:59,986 --> 00:44:02,006
Yeah, right.

808
00:44:02,046 --> 00:44:07,355
Joe, he's...
he's getting weaker.

809
00:44:07,385 --> 00:44:09,285
Yeah, he keeps...

810
00:44:09,325 --> 00:44:12,955
I once saw this PBS special with
all these great doo-wop singers.

811
00:44:12,995 --> 00:44:15,014
Donna, please, shhh.

812
00:44:15,064 --> 00:44:16,964
What? Oh, Paul?

813
00:44:16,994 --> 00:44:19,264
She'll be on the phone
for at least 20 minutes.

814
00:44:19,304 --> 00:44:21,080
- They do this every couple...
- I know that.

815
00:44:21,104 --> 00:44:24,874
Yeah, that's Lynn.

816
00:44:27,403 --> 00:44:31,313
I know. Oh, yeah.
That's right. Oooh, when?

817
00:44:31,343 --> 00:44:33,603
I could just about
kill you right now.

818
00:44:33,643 --> 00:44:36,272
In that case,
you'll have to pop inside.

819
00:44:36,312 --> 00:44:39,442
I'll make you a cup of coffee.

820
00:44:39,482 --> 00:44:41,922
Good. All right.

821
00:44:41,952 --> 00:44:44,222
Well then I'll see the two of
you real soon, huh?

822
00:44:44,252 --> 00:44:47,921
Okay, Paul, say hello
to the girls for me.

823
00:44:47,961 --> 00:44:50,261
Yeah. Bye-bye.

824
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,930
Mom?

825
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:02,200
Mmm?

826
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,170
Mom, what did you just do?

827
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:05,669
What?

828
00:45:05,709 --> 00:45:07,899
Did you just invite them over?

829
00:45:07,979 --> 00:45:11,609
Oh, good lord.

830
00:45:11,649 --> 00:45:13,309
Are you pretending
to be oblivious,

831
00:45:13,349 --> 00:45:15,078
Or do you really not get it?

832
00:45:15,118 --> 00:45:16,708
Get what?

833
00:45:16,748 --> 00:45:19,948
How that might make me feel?

834
00:45:20,518 --> 00:45:24,248
Suddenly,
there was such a racket.

835
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:27,747
Seems like every guy on the ship
was yelling his head off.

836
00:45:27,797 --> 00:45:29,697
So I got out of the room,
I ran up the stairs.

837
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:34,597
All the way up to the top deck
to see what was going on,

838
00:45:34,637 --> 00:45:38,905
And there's a woman
standing there.

839
00:45:38,906 --> 00:45:43,366
So I look over and I'm looking.

840
00:45:43,406 --> 00:45:46,345
And all of a sudden, I realize.

841
00:45:46,375 --> 00:45:49,775
That's Doris.

842
00:45:49,815 --> 00:45:52,645
Standing there waiting for me.

843
00:45:58,384 --> 00:46:00,554
Granddad?

844
00:46:07,733 --> 00:46:11,253
Dude, did he just die on camera?

845
00:46:15,032 --> 00:46:16,232
It's okay.

846
00:46:16,272 --> 00:46:17,742
You don't joke about that.

847
00:46:17,772 --> 00:46:19,832
Look, I'm sorry.

848
00:46:19,872 --> 00:46:22,862
I didn't... I didn't mean to
cause any sort of...

849
00:46:22,912 --> 00:46:24,272
False alarm, don't worry.

850
00:46:24,312 --> 00:46:26,127
- What happened?
- He did look dead, though.

851
00:46:26,151 --> 00:46:27,387
He looked, like, really dead.

852
00:46:27,411 --> 00:46:28,671
Did something happen to dad?

853
00:46:28,711 --> 00:46:31,771
- No.
- Yeah, something did happen.

854
00:46:31,821 --> 00:46:33,181
No, nothing happened.

855
00:46:33,221 --> 00:46:36,050
Something happened.
We thought he was dead.

856
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:37,990
- Elliot...
- we have it on camera.

857
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:39,290
What did you do to him, Elliot?

858
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:41,690
What did I do... nothing, mom.

859
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:43,629
What're you doing
with that camera?

860
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:46,759
Okay, he was telling a story
about World War II, and...

861
00:46:46,799 --> 00:46:48,159
You brought up politics?

862
00:46:48,199 --> 00:46:50,229
No, I didn't bring up politics.

863
00:46:50,269 --> 00:46:52,789
- For fuck's sake.
- Elliot!

864
00:46:52,839 --> 00:46:55,138
Oh, you guys have never
heard the fuck word before?

865
00:46:55,168 --> 00:46:57,608
Okay, Elliot,
just go to your room.

866
00:46:57,638 --> 00:46:59,868
Mom, I'm not six years old
and I don't have a room.

867
00:46:59,908 --> 00:47:01,038
This isn't my house.

868
00:47:01,078 --> 00:47:02,448
Last I heard,

869
00:47:02,478 --> 00:47:04,846
Your name was on
the fucking title.

870
00:47:04,847 --> 00:47:07,317
Oh, oh, oh.

871
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:11,747
- You are a real asshole.
- Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

872
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,703
- You know that.
- I wasn't supposed to say it.

873
00:47:13,727 --> 00:47:14,827
Ok, just get out.

874
00:47:15,186 --> 00:47:18,556
- Get out!
- Yeah, I'm on my way.

875
00:47:18,596 --> 00:47:22,656
- Hey, aren't you...
- eat shit, Paul.

876
00:47:22,696 --> 00:47:24,755
Some manners that kid has.

877
00:47:24,795 --> 00:47:26,265
Oh, fuck you, Paul.

878
00:47:28,965 --> 00:47:33,235
I'm sorry, I apologize.
I'm sorry.

879
00:47:33,275 --> 00:47:37,764
Um, would anyone
like some tea or coffee?

880
00:47:37,844 --> 00:47:40,004
Pass those, would you, dear?

881
00:47:43,154 --> 00:47:44,983
- Paul wants some.
- Oh, they look delicious.

882
00:47:45,013 --> 00:47:49,283
Wait till you all see Alice.
Oh, god. What a beauty.

883
00:47:49,323 --> 00:47:51,913
And she's just
as smart as a whip.

884
00:47:51,953 --> 00:47:53,583
Really quick, yeah.

885
00:47:53,623 --> 00:47:56,252
Really looking forward to having
a conversation with her.

886
00:47:56,292 --> 00:48:00,562
Although, Lynn doesn't think
it's such a good idea.

887
00:48:00,632 --> 00:48:02,192
I didn't say that, Paul.

888
00:48:02,232 --> 00:48:04,292
Good. I'm glad there's
no problem then.

889
00:48:04,332 --> 00:48:07,501
I'm just trying to make sure
Alice doesn't walk into.

890
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:10,441
A, um, emotionally
volatile atmosphere.

891
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:14,031
It's a wedding, Lynn.
Weddings aren't volatile.

892
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,710
You know, Paul, I don't think
you really understand.

893
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:21,080
Just how fragile
Alice is right now.

894
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,210
And it's not your fault.

895
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:23,950
At all.

896
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:26,179
You see, the psychology
of self-injuring.

897
00:48:26,219 --> 00:48:28,159
Is very complicated.

898
00:48:28,189 --> 00:48:31,959
And I think what
Alice is... was doing.

899
00:48:31,989 --> 00:48:35,948
In her case is she was
trying to convert.

900
00:48:35,998 --> 00:48:39,698
Her emotional pain
into something tangible.

901
00:48:39,738 --> 00:48:42,198
Like a physical pain.

902
00:48:42,238 --> 00:48:45,967
I... I think we do understand.

903
00:48:46,037 --> 00:48:50,537
Usually this kind of thing is
about seeking attention.

904
00:48:52,947 --> 00:48:55,006
What, did I say
something stupid?

905
00:48:55,046 --> 00:48:57,345
- Okay, Patty, could I just...
- No.

906
00:48:57,346 --> 00:48:59,476
It has become a fad these days.

907
00:48:59,516 --> 00:49:01,076
It's not a fad.

908
00:49:01,116 --> 00:49:04,616
- I think that...
- I don't care what you think.

909
00:49:05,655 --> 00:49:08,955
I am just trying
to explain to you.

910
00:49:08,995 --> 00:49:11,355
What's going on
with our daughter.

911
00:49:11,395 --> 00:49:13,025
And I think in her case,

912
00:49:13,065 --> 00:49:15,154
It's about her trying
to gain control.

913
00:49:15,194 --> 00:49:17,664
Over what?

914
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:19,104
Over everything.

915
00:49:19,174 --> 00:49:21,504
Everything in this
child's entire life.

916
00:49:21,534 --> 00:49:23,204
Has been beyond her control.

917
00:49:23,244 --> 00:49:24,833
Our divorce,

918
00:49:24,873 --> 00:49:27,603
The fact that she was forced
to spend summers with you.

919
00:49:27,643 --> 00:49:31,043
The fact that she grew up
without her brother.

920
00:49:31,083 --> 00:49:34,013
All of it. She had no
control over any of it.

921
00:49:34,053 --> 00:49:35,482
But you did.

922
00:49:40,722 --> 00:49:44,452
No, mom. I didn't.

923
00:49:47,531 --> 00:49:51,991
Paul, tell me if I'm crazy,

924
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:56,590
Because I really don't remember
anymore, I really don't.

925
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,160
I mean, I blocked
so much of it out.

926
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,830
That I don't know what's
true and what's not.

927
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:05,499
The night before I left,

928
00:50:05,539 --> 00:50:07,539
We were in the kitchen.

929
00:50:07,579 --> 00:50:10,949
And you were screaming at me
about something, l...

930
00:50:10,979 --> 00:50:12,949
I think you...

931
00:50:12,989 --> 00:50:15,578
I think you lost your
keys or something.

932
00:50:15,618 --> 00:50:18,988
And Alice was
holding on to my leg.

933
00:50:19,018 --> 00:50:22,218
And you were screaming.
You were really screaming.

934
00:50:22,258 --> 00:50:25,247
And she was terrified.
She wouldn't let go.

935
00:50:25,297 --> 00:50:28,787
And then you grabbed me
by my shirt,

936
00:50:28,827 --> 00:50:31,857
And you punched me in the face.

937
00:50:31,897 --> 00:50:33,597
You grabbed me by my shirt.

938
00:50:33,637 --> 00:50:37,866
And you punched me
right in the face.

939
00:50:37,906 --> 00:50:39,876
Now tell me, Paul,

940
00:50:42,616 --> 00:50:46,175
Did that actually happen?

941
00:50:51,255 --> 00:50:53,045
Yeah, it happened.

942
00:51:08,863 --> 00:51:10,493
It must feel good.

943
00:51:10,533 --> 00:51:14,093
To get something like
that off your chest.

944
00:52:48,993 --> 00:52:52,053
Hey, granddad.
Have you seen my camera?

945
00:52:52,093 --> 00:52:54,223
Nope.

946
00:52:54,263 --> 00:52:57,662
Oh, there it is.

947
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:28,459
Last night
I didn't sleep as usual.

948
00:53:28,489 --> 00:53:30,759
I got to thinking,

949
00:53:31,799 --> 00:53:35,758
Maybe around, like, 4 A.M or so,

950
00:53:35,798 --> 00:53:38,928
That you know,
it seems like there's been.

951
00:53:38,968 --> 00:53:43,568
An inordinate amount
of drama since we got here.

952
00:53:43,608 --> 00:53:45,077
And it made me think that,

953
00:53:45,107 --> 00:53:46,837
If we come down here
for a funeral,

954
00:53:46,877 --> 00:53:49,867
Instead of a wedding,

955
00:53:49,917 --> 00:53:53,647
We might actually all
be getting along.

956
00:53:53,687 --> 00:53:56,806
Now, begs the question
what does that mean?

957
00:53:56,856 --> 00:54:01,376
And the only conclusion
I've been able to come to,

958
00:54:01,456 --> 00:54:05,825
Is that death is actually
a more unifying force.

959
00:54:05,855 --> 00:54:08,625
Within family than love.

960
00:54:08,665 --> 00:54:10,755
That's a mind blowing concept.

961
00:54:10,795 --> 00:54:15,704
It is a despicable thing to say.

962
00:54:15,734 --> 00:54:17,964
Really?

963
00:54:18,034 --> 00:54:20,974
Really.

964
00:54:21,004 --> 00:54:25,773
I mean, I know this sounds
kind of cynical, but...

965
00:54:25,813 --> 00:54:29,013
I mean, take 9/11 for instance.

966
00:54:30,053 --> 00:54:32,383
I know I was young
when it happened,

967
00:54:32,413 --> 00:54:35,752
But honestly,
when I think about it,

968
00:54:35,782 --> 00:54:41,092
It may have been the only time
in my entire life.

969
00:54:41,122 --> 00:54:45,821
That I ever really,
truly felt connected.

970
00:54:45,861 --> 00:54:48,421
To every single member
of my family.

971
00:54:48,461 --> 00:54:51,591
Like some strange,
intangible nexus.

972
00:54:51,671 --> 00:54:53,731
Just unveiled itself
for a moment.

973
00:54:53,771 --> 00:54:56,140
I know it's still there.

974
00:54:56,170 --> 00:54:58,660
That's not what I'm saying.

975
00:54:58,710 --> 00:55:02,610
I guess I just think it's
weird that it takes tragedy.

976
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,879
To bring it out.

977
00:55:05,909 --> 00:55:10,979
Well, l... perhaps it's just
the way you were brought up.

978
00:55:14,459 --> 00:55:16,688
Mmm.

979
00:55:16,728 --> 00:55:20,988
I am myself
and my circumstances.

980
00:55:21,028 --> 00:55:23,328
Did you hear about Alice?

981
00:55:23,368 --> 00:55:24,957
Yeah. I feel bad for her.

982
00:55:24,997 --> 00:55:26,517
Supposedly, it's bad.

983
00:55:26,567 --> 00:55:28,373
It's such a bizarre
thing to do to yourself.

984
00:55:28,397 --> 00:55:29,557
I don't get it.

985
00:55:29,607 --> 00:55:31,313
Now they're gonna sew
sleeves on her dress.

986
00:55:31,337 --> 00:55:32,597
She's so gruesome.

987
00:55:32,637 --> 00:55:35,036
Lynn says it's this
generation's anorexia.

988
00:55:35,076 --> 00:55:36,806
Anorexia, I can understand.

989
00:55:36,846 --> 00:55:38,936
Everybody wants to look good,
but this is just gross.

990
00:55:38,976 --> 00:55:40,736
It is.

991
00:55:40,776 --> 00:55:42,876
You don't do it, do you?
Any of your friends do it?

992
00:55:42,916 --> 00:55:44,336
No, of course not.

993
00:55:44,416 --> 00:55:46,045
See, so it's not
generational Donna.

994
00:55:46,085 --> 00:55:48,354
I didn't say it, Lynn said it.

995
00:55:48,355 --> 00:55:49,615
I just hope she looks nice.

996
00:55:49,655 --> 00:55:51,055
Well, it may not matter.

997
00:55:51,085 --> 00:55:52,431
Why? What do you got?

998
00:55:52,455 --> 00:55:53,785
Lynn said something about.

999
00:55:53,825 --> 00:55:56,694
Not wanting to bring Alice
into this environment.

1000
00:55:58,364 --> 00:56:00,010
How could she do
such a thing, you know?

1001
00:56:00,034 --> 00:56:01,424
Do what?

1002
00:56:01,464 --> 00:56:03,264
Alice isn't coming
to the wedding!

1003
00:56:03,304 --> 00:56:04,763
What?

1004
00:56:05,803 --> 00:56:07,793
That is not necessarily a given.

1005
00:56:07,833 --> 00:56:09,303
She wants everything about her.

1006
00:56:09,333 --> 00:56:11,919
Because she wants all the attention.
She's just like her mother.

1007
00:56:11,943 --> 00:56:13,703
Who said she's not coming?

1008
00:56:13,743 --> 00:56:15,042
Donna said that Lynn said it.

1009
00:56:15,072 --> 00:56:17,012
- I did not.
- Yes, you did.

1010
00:56:17,042 --> 00:56:20,412
How could she do that?
How could she just not come?

1011
00:56:20,452 --> 00:56:22,812
I dunno.

1012
00:56:25,421 --> 00:56:26,881
What?

1013
00:56:28,921 --> 00:56:31,551
How could she do that?
How could she not come?

1014
00:56:31,591 --> 00:56:34,561
How can she ruin
her brother's wedding?

1015
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:35,960
What is wrong with you?

1016
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:38,520
Who said she's not coming, mom?

1017
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:42,360
You should just tell her
to stop all this silly drama.

1018
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,969
This isn't about her.

1019
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:46,999
It's about Heather and Dylan.
It's their day.

1020
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:49,409
I know that! She is coming!

1021
00:56:49,469 --> 00:56:51,339
Who said she's not coming?

1022
00:56:51,379 --> 00:56:53,609
It doesn't matter who
said it for god's sakes, Lynn!

1023
00:56:53,649 --> 00:56:55,308
It was said!

1024
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:57,294
You should've just told
her to call her father.

1025
00:56:57,318 --> 00:56:58,908
And to resolve this whole thing.

1026
00:56:58,948 --> 00:57:00,608
Instead now it's all ruined.

1027
00:57:00,648 --> 00:57:03,678
Oh, fine.

1028
00:58:12,711 --> 00:58:14,381
Hey, everybody.

1029
00:58:20,990 --> 00:58:22,890
Oh, thank god.

1030
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:25,219
What's up, Alice?

1031
00:58:25,259 --> 00:58:26,819
- How are you?
- I'm good.

1032
00:58:26,859 --> 00:58:28,989
Yeah? Mom.

1033
00:58:29,029 --> 00:58:31,929
- Hi.
- How are you?

1034
00:58:31,969 --> 00:58:33,469
- I'm good. I'm good.
- You look good.

1035
00:58:33,499 --> 00:58:34,769
Thank you. Hi!

1036
00:58:34,798 --> 00:58:36,358
I'm not waiting
to give you a hug.

1037
00:58:36,408 --> 00:58:37,668
Good.

1038
00:58:37,708 --> 00:58:39,258
Thank you so much
for being here.

1039
00:58:39,308 --> 00:58:41,238
Hey, what's cooking everybody?

1040
00:58:41,278 --> 00:58:45,577
Let's do all the introductions
and be pseudo polite...

1041
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:48,246
For the love of granddad's
elusive god,

1042
00:58:48,247 --> 00:58:50,277
Can we just get dinner?

1043
00:58:50,317 --> 00:58:52,547
And school. How's school?
Do you have a boyfriend?

1044
00:58:52,587 --> 00:58:55,416
I know you do. You must because
you're too freaking gorgeous.

1045
00:58:55,456 --> 00:58:57,386
I suppose. It's good.

1046
00:58:57,426 --> 00:58:59,876
Bonnie, it's summer now.

1047
00:59:00,926 --> 00:59:02,726
Donna, can you please
pass the roast?

1048
00:59:02,796 --> 00:59:04,426
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1049
00:59:04,466 --> 00:59:06,195
- No boyfriend?
- No.

1050
00:59:06,225 --> 00:59:07,525
There must be someone out there.

1051
00:59:07,565 --> 00:59:10,155
No, l... I can cut it.

1052
00:59:10,205 --> 00:59:11,211
I don't mind.

1053
00:59:11,235 --> 00:59:14,435
Donna. Donna, please stop it.

1054
00:59:14,475 --> 00:59:16,234
She can eat like everyone else.

1055
00:59:16,274 --> 00:59:18,204
I bet you there's someone
waiting in the wings.

1056
00:59:18,244 --> 00:59:20,644
I think you lost
your keys or something.

1057
00:59:20,674 --> 00:59:22,304
But you were screaming at me.

1058
00:59:22,344 --> 00:59:25,573
And Alice was holding
on to my leg.

1059
00:59:25,613 --> 00:59:28,553
And she was terrified.
She wouldn't let go.

1060
00:59:28,583 --> 00:59:32,643
And then you grabbed me
by my shirt...

1061
00:59:32,683 --> 00:59:35,812
Shit, Alice. I'm sorry.

1062
00:59:35,852 --> 00:59:36,898
It's all right.

1063
00:59:36,922 --> 00:59:39,322
I didn't think about it.

1064
00:59:39,362 --> 00:59:44,522
Dude, are you, like, crying?

1065
00:59:46,631 --> 00:59:49,791
I think Alice handled
the family very well.

1066
00:59:51,501 --> 00:59:54,940
Yeah, she and Dylan
were cracking up.

1067
00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:57,310
About that dog in the outfit.

1068
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:59,710
A cowboy.

1069
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:02,810
I just don't know what I'm
supposed to do about Paul.

1070
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:05,719
That's a tough one.

1071
01:00:08,289 --> 01:00:11,739
I just don't get
what the appeal is.

1072
01:00:11,789 --> 01:00:14,228
Of Paul?

1073
01:00:14,229 --> 01:00:16,628
No, the cowboy dog.

1074
01:00:16,658 --> 01:00:19,358
Are you even listening to me?

1075
01:00:19,398 --> 01:00:21,888
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

1076
01:00:22,928 --> 01:00:24,957
I just can't get over that dog.

1077
01:00:24,997 --> 01:00:27,267
Well, try, Lee.

1078
01:00:31,837 --> 01:00:34,896
He had these little holsters
and...

1079
01:00:34,946 --> 01:00:37,506
Little chaps he was wearing.

1080
01:00:45,515 --> 01:00:48,245
So I'm pretty sure
grandma's a sociopath.

1081
01:00:48,285 --> 01:00:50,345
No, I'm serious.

1082
01:00:50,395 --> 01:00:51,985
I think it requires
investigation.

1083
01:00:52,025 --> 01:00:54,684
I think you should write
your thesis paper on this.

1084
01:00:54,724 --> 01:00:57,954
Yeah, call it
<i>"Heart of Darkness 4."</i>

1085
01:00:57,994 --> 01:01:01,294
Thesis papers don't
have such poetic titles.

1086
01:01:01,334 --> 01:01:03,464
Yeah.

1087
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:09,733
What the fuck are you doing
with drugs, Elliot?

1088
01:01:09,773 --> 01:01:12,903
You got out of your fourth
rehab three months ago.

1089
01:01:12,943 --> 01:01:14,812
Alice, come on.

1090
01:01:14,842 --> 01:01:16,372
Weed's not a real drug.

1091
01:01:16,412 --> 01:01:18,442
It's like a teddy bear.

1092
01:01:18,482 --> 01:01:19,852
Or a gecko.

1093
01:01:21,882 --> 01:01:23,752
You're not fucking around
with anything else?

1094
01:01:23,792 --> 01:01:25,721
No, of course not.

1095
01:01:25,751 --> 01:01:27,551
Seriously, Elliot.

1096
01:01:27,591 --> 01:01:29,851
You fucking scared us.

1097
01:01:29,891 --> 01:01:31,291
I promise.

1098
01:01:33,831 --> 01:01:35,630
You really wanna
open the floodgates.

1099
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:37,530
On the self-destructive
behavior,

1100
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:38,860
Little Miss Mutilation?

1101
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:41,270
No, it wasn't good.
You were really fucked up.

1102
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:44,959
I know. I get it.

1103
01:01:45,009 --> 01:01:47,569
I'm not doing
the bad shit anymore.

1104
01:01:50,509 --> 01:01:52,709
I'm just doing normal,
teenage drugs.

1105
01:02:12,567 --> 01:02:17,196
Wow. I see tablespoons,

1106
01:02:17,236 --> 01:02:20,326
Teaspoons,

1107
01:02:20,406 --> 01:02:23,806
Dinner forks,

1108
01:02:23,846 --> 01:02:25,535
Dessert forks.

1109
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:29,235
But nary a knife in sight.

1110
01:02:29,275 --> 01:02:31,545
- Really?
- Yup.

1111
01:02:31,585 --> 01:02:32,705
Mmm-mmm.

1112
01:02:32,745 --> 01:02:35,244
The knives have migrated.

1113
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:38,654
Maybe grandma's just baby
proofing the house.

1114
01:02:38,684 --> 01:02:39,744
For granddad.

1115
01:02:39,784 --> 01:02:41,314
Do they honestly think.

1116
01:02:41,354 --> 01:02:44,883
That access to a butter
knife is my problem?

1117
01:02:44,923 --> 01:02:49,193
Are you fucking kidding?
Abso-fucking-lutely they do.

1118
01:02:49,233 --> 01:02:53,033
Dude, granny baker's already
swapped out your lady bic.

1119
01:02:53,063 --> 01:02:55,732
With a bucket of nair.

1120
01:03:01,872 --> 01:03:04,362
I need an ambulance right away.

1121
01:03:04,412 --> 01:03:08,111
To number 9 Overlook
Drive, please.

1122
01:03:08,151 --> 01:03:10,481
Yes.

1123
01:03:10,521 --> 01:03:13,541
Uh-huh.

1124
01:03:13,591 --> 01:03:15,380
Don't touch him.

1125
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:17,860
Yes, he's still breathing.

1126
01:03:17,890 --> 01:03:19,550
Thank you.

1127
01:03:23,130 --> 01:03:25,259
Don't worry.
This is what happens.

1128
01:03:36,608 --> 01:03:40,808
<i>- Are you on drugs?
- What?</i>

1129
01:03:40,848 --> 01:03:43,708
<i>Did you, like, take something?</i>

1130
01:03:43,748 --> 01:03:46,767
<i>Uh, yeah.</i>

1131
01:03:46,817 --> 01:03:49,377
<i>What'd you take?</i>

1132
01:03:50,417 --> 01:03:51,887
<i>Fentanyl.</i>

1133
01:03:53,427 --> 01:03:56,216
<i>What's Fentanyl?</i>

1134
01:03:56,256 --> 01:03:58,556
<i>It's like morphine.</i>

1135
01:03:58,596 --> 01:04:01,186
<i>81 times more potent.</i>

1136
01:04:03,226 --> 01:04:06,285
<i>Are you, like, afraid of dying?</i>

1137
01:04:08,105 --> 01:04:11,735
<i>Every second. Every day, yeah.</i>

1138
01:04:15,874 --> 01:04:18,274
<i>Doesn't make any sense.</i>

1139
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:22,044
<i>I know.</i>

1140
01:04:29,453 --> 01:04:32,083
<i>What's it feel like?</i>

1141
01:05:26,537 --> 01:05:30,567
Oh, in case your
mother didn't tell you,

1142
01:05:30,607 --> 01:05:33,267
I won't be at the
rehearsal dinner.

1143
01:05:33,307 --> 01:05:37,376
I'll be at the hospital
with your grandfather.

1144
01:05:45,325 --> 01:05:47,785
Where's Paul?

1145
01:05:47,825 --> 01:05:49,555
Doesn't look like he's here.

1146
01:05:49,595 --> 01:05:50,855
Well, like, why isn't he here?

1147
01:05:50,895 --> 01:05:54,325
How the fuck should I know?

1148
01:05:54,365 --> 01:05:55,764
I just think it's weird, like,

1149
01:05:55,794 --> 01:05:57,774
What if he got into
a car accident or something?

1150
01:05:57,804 --> 01:06:00,294
Ben, shut the fuck up.
You're killing me.

1151
01:06:00,334 --> 01:06:02,394
Whatever.

1152
01:06:09,443 --> 01:06:12,823
Where's your sister?
Where's Alice?

1153
01:06:14,153 --> 01:06:17,312
Lee, would you go
check on Alice?

1154
01:06:17,352 --> 01:06:18,442
I'm... I'm wearing heels.

1155
01:06:18,482 --> 01:06:19,822
Alrighty.

1156
01:06:21,422 --> 01:06:23,442
Why didn't you wear a shirt?

1157
01:06:23,492 --> 01:06:25,081
What do you mean?
This is a shirt.

1158
01:06:25,121 --> 01:06:27,181
No, it isn't a shirt.
That's a sweatshirt.

1159
01:06:27,231 --> 01:06:28,232
That's a shirt.

1160
01:06:29,361 --> 01:06:31,451
What's the holdup? You ready?

1161
01:06:31,501 --> 01:06:33,561
You ready?

1162
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,500
What do I say to him, dad?

1163
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:43,270
Who?

1164
01:06:45,309 --> 01:06:47,439
Paul, what... you know.

1165
01:06:47,479 --> 01:06:50,279
What do I say to him?

1166
01:06:51,319 --> 01:06:53,369
What'll we talk about?

1167
01:06:54,818 --> 01:07:00,158
Well, uh, you know I
understand it's... it's awkward,

1168
01:07:00,188 --> 01:07:04,358
But, oh, he'll probably, uh,

1169
01:07:04,398 --> 01:07:07,387
He'll probably ask you
what you've been up to.

1170
01:07:07,427 --> 01:07:13,097
And you'll tell him
and... and...

1171
01:07:13,137 --> 01:07:15,266
You'll ask him
and he'll tell you.

1172
01:07:15,306 --> 01:07:18,326
And go on from there.

1173
01:07:18,376 --> 01:07:20,306
It's... it's a rehearsal dinner.

1174
01:07:20,346 --> 01:07:22,036
It's not the camp David accords.

1175
01:07:22,106 --> 01:07:25,475
Hey, are you hot?

1176
01:07:25,675 --> 01:07:27,445
Feeling good? Absolutely.

1177
01:07:36,354 --> 01:07:38,294
Hey. Good to see you, Paul.

1178
01:07:38,324 --> 01:07:40,314
Lee, good to see you.

1179
01:07:40,364 --> 01:07:45,553
Oh, my god.
You guys look so big.

1180
01:07:45,593 --> 01:07:47,223
Wow.

1181
01:07:47,263 --> 01:07:48,463
Coming in for one.

1182
01:07:48,503 --> 01:07:50,163
Paul, how's it going, man?

1183
01:07:50,203 --> 01:07:51,223
Hanging in there.

1184
01:07:51,273 --> 01:07:53,173
Hey, how are you doing, man?

1185
01:07:53,203 --> 01:07:55,572
We met briefly, exchanged...
I don't know if you remember,

1186
01:07:55,602 --> 01:07:57,042
But it was powertul for me.

1187
01:07:57,072 --> 01:07:59,672
Alice, if you're comfortable,

1188
01:07:59,712 --> 01:08:02,572
I'm gonna take these
two virtuous maidens,

1189
01:08:02,612 --> 01:08:04,582
I'm going to defile them,

1190
01:08:04,611 --> 01:08:07,081
With my thoughts and opinions.

1191
01:08:07,121 --> 01:08:09,141
On the current state
of organized religion.

1192
01:08:09,181 --> 01:08:11,651
Which are controversial,
Paul, rest assured.

1193
01:08:11,691 --> 01:08:14,820
I'm sorry, he has problems.

1194
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:19,090
Well, that's sort of evident.

1195
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:23,430
Um, so, but you do not.

1196
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:27,029
You, uh, you're all grown up.

1197
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:28,499
It's amazing.

1198
01:08:28,539 --> 01:08:31,029
Sorry I missed it.

1199
01:08:31,069 --> 01:08:33,199
But, um, thank you for coming.

1200
01:08:33,239 --> 01:08:34,638
It means a lot to everybody.

1201
01:08:34,678 --> 01:08:37,268
Yeah. I mean, Charlie and Sam,

1202
01:08:37,308 --> 01:08:39,368
I hardly recognize them.

1203
01:08:39,408 --> 01:08:40,409
They're so grown up.

1204
01:08:40,448 --> 01:08:42,608
They always ask about you.

1205
01:08:42,648 --> 01:08:45,047
They're like how come Alice
doesn't live with us anymore?

1206
01:08:45,087 --> 01:08:48,147
Wait, is that how
they remember it?

1207
01:08:48,187 --> 01:08:49,563
Like when I come
for the summers?

1208
01:08:49,587 --> 01:08:51,033
They don't ever
think I lived there.

1209
01:08:51,057 --> 01:08:52,317
No, no, no, no.

1210
01:08:52,357 --> 01:08:54,732
- Why would they think that?
- It's not anything specific.

1211
01:08:54,756 --> 01:08:57,126
It's, uh, just more of a...

1212
01:08:57,166 --> 01:09:00,356
They were the little kids
and you were the big sister.

1213
01:09:00,396 --> 01:09:05,125
And it's in the past and
that's where it should stay.

1214
01:09:05,165 --> 01:09:09,575
Um, and hopefully, everything's
forgiven, you know?

1215
01:09:09,605 --> 01:09:13,445
What, uh... the degree?

1216
01:09:13,475 --> 01:09:17,534
What, uh, is that
something interesting?

1217
01:09:17,584 --> 01:09:20,674
Yeah. It is interesting.

1218
01:09:20,714 --> 01:09:22,914
It's, um, child development.

1219
01:09:22,954 --> 01:09:24,923
- Uh-huh.
- Mmm-hmm.

1220
01:09:24,953 --> 01:09:28,153
So that means that you
would be a... a...

1221
01:09:28,193 --> 01:09:32,053
Take care of babies,
pediatrician or...?

1222
01:09:32,093 --> 01:09:35,322
No, child development
is more psychology.

1223
01:09:35,362 --> 01:09:36,363
Psychology.

1224
01:09:36,432 --> 01:09:37,992
Yeah, of course.

1225
01:09:38,032 --> 01:09:41,092
Must've gotten that
from your mother.

1226
01:09:41,132 --> 01:09:42,462
Got what?

1227
01:09:42,502 --> 01:09:46,941
You know, the thing. With Lynn.

1228
01:09:47,011 --> 01:09:50,601
The therapist.
You know. Everything.

1229
01:09:50,641 --> 01:09:54,131
That wasn't just her.

1230
01:09:54,181 --> 01:09:59,120
Is everyone here now?

1231
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:03,020
Okay. You wanna head in?

1232
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:04,649
That's right.
And right down here.

1233
01:10:04,689 --> 01:10:06,449
That's excellent guys.

1234
01:10:06,489 --> 01:10:09,519
Now we're just going to split
off, okay perfect, thank you.

1235
01:10:12,359 --> 01:10:15,528
And right this way, sweetie.
Right over here.

1236
01:10:15,568 --> 01:10:17,558
That was great.
That was excellent.

1237
01:10:17,598 --> 01:10:22,538
And now if we could have the
groom walk his mom to her seat.

1238
01:10:26,377 --> 01:10:28,637
Okay, um...

1239
01:10:28,677 --> 01:10:31,507
It, uh... I just...

1240
01:10:31,547 --> 01:10:34,177
Dylan, didn't you tell her?

1241
01:10:34,217 --> 01:10:36,116
Tell me what, Lynn?

1242
01:10:38,316 --> 01:10:40,446
Uh...

1243
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:44,146
I mean do you think that you can
just waltz right back into his...

1244
01:10:44,196 --> 01:10:45,525
- Well...
- life?

1245
01:10:45,555 --> 01:10:47,525
Did she push you
to do this to me?

1246
01:10:47,565 --> 01:10:49,995
No, no. No.

1247
01:10:50,025 --> 01:10:53,195
No, it's just that...

1248
01:10:56,004 --> 01:10:59,164
She's my mother, Patty.

1249
01:11:03,604 --> 01:11:07,563
And...

1250
01:11:10,413 --> 01:11:12,943
Weren't you the one who said.

1251
01:11:12,983 --> 01:11:16,512
<i>"That parenting entails..."</i>

1252
01:11:16,582 --> 01:11:20,522
<i>"certain responsibilities",</i>
right?

1253
01:11:20,562 --> 01:11:24,122
Well, I'm the one
that drove him to school.

1254
01:11:24,162 --> 01:11:25,491
I'm the one that put him to bed.

1255
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:27,021
I'm the one who tickled his back.

1256
01:11:27,061 --> 01:11:30,001
When he was afraid
and had a nightmare.

1257
01:11:30,031 --> 01:11:32,231
I'm the one who
washed his clothes.

1258
01:11:32,271 --> 01:11:36,030
Not you! Not you!

1259
01:11:36,070 --> 01:11:39,440
I was the one who was
always there, not you.

1260
01:11:42,210 --> 01:11:44,240
Patty, why don't we
get a breath of air.

1261
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:45,969
We are outside, Paul!

1262
01:11:46,009 --> 01:11:48,449
Fine. Back off.

1263
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:50,509
Just calm down.

1264
01:11:50,549 --> 01:11:55,578
I'm... I'm sorr... sorry.

1265
01:11:55,618 --> 01:11:58,058
I'm telling you, Lee,
now she's really gonna be.

1266
01:11:58,088 --> 01:11:59,558
On the fucking warpath.

1267
01:11:59,588 --> 01:12:01,558
The fucking warpath.

1268
01:12:04,068 --> 01:12:06,497
How you doing back there,
Elliot?

1269
01:12:06,527 --> 01:12:10,127
I'm contemplating
the symbolic nature.

1270
01:12:10,167 --> 01:12:13,157
Of this seating arrangement.

1271
01:12:15,076 --> 01:12:17,636
Here come the Hellmans
no sense of equilibrium

1272
01:12:17,676 --> 01:12:20,236
the family members catalyst
like yellow cake and Tritium

1273
01:12:20,276 --> 01:12:22,906
from a fight we'll blow
our way to center stage

1274
01:12:22,946 --> 01:12:25,345
this is rage, this is rage,
this is a crew with some rage

1275
01:12:25,385 --> 01:12:28,145
let's slay the beast to save
the feast, animals in a cage

1276
01:12:28,185 --> 01:12:30,045
get 'em, no cops
on this green earth

1277
01:12:30,085 --> 01:12:32,401
going to keep us from rising
we fuck up genes, these rings

1278
01:12:32,425 --> 01:12:33,855
and all the things
we brutalizing

1279
01:12:33,925 --> 01:12:36,354
not one yuppie on this family
will be my own relation

1280
01:12:36,394 --> 01:12:37,854
right hand up I go seven

1281
01:12:37,894 --> 01:12:39,984
sieg heils at Hellman nation?

1282
01:12:40,024 --> 01:12:41,514
Oh, shit, Elliot!

1283
01:12:41,564 --> 01:12:45,102
Coming all the way from MIC
straight to Annapolis.

1284
01:12:45,103 --> 01:12:46,593
Just to fucking kill it!

1285
01:12:46,633 --> 01:12:47,633
In one, my goodness.

1286
01:12:47,733 --> 01:12:50,503
Oh, my goodness, bitches.

1287
01:12:50,543 --> 01:12:55,172
Oh my god, making my baby
batter boil, boy. Woo.

1288
01:12:55,372 --> 01:12:56,642
They're like 6.5s.

1289
01:12:56,672 --> 01:12:58,372
Oh, my god. Look at that one.

1290
01:12:58,412 --> 01:13:00,972
Look at that one, she's a
motherfucking thoroughbred!

1291
01:13:01,012 --> 01:13:02,982
Oh, she's all classy and shit.

1292
01:13:03,012 --> 01:13:05,351
I bet she's got black,
satin sheets.

1293
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:08,581
Mmm, little runway strip
to park my plane in that.

1294
01:13:08,621 --> 01:13:10,111
Mmm! Get my dick wet tonight.

1295
01:13:10,151 --> 01:13:11,551
I'd tap that.

1296
01:13:11,591 --> 01:13:14,181
Boy, you don't even know
shit about tapping shit.

1297
01:13:14,231 --> 01:13:16,420
Yeah, I do. I found this
book on my mom's bed.

1298
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:18,260
All about the g-spot.

1299
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:20,160
I've been trying it out
on a few bitches.

1300
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:23,920
You know how I can
be totally certain.

1301
01:13:23,970 --> 01:13:25,429
That you're full
of shit right now?

1302
01:13:25,469 --> 01:13:26,959
I'm not, but how?

1303
01:13:26,999 --> 01:13:30,369
Because if your mom really
knew where her g-spot was,

1304
01:13:30,409 --> 01:13:33,008
She wouldn't have to make
costumes for dogs.

1305
01:13:33,009 --> 01:13:35,568
Oh! Snap, nigga!

1306
01:13:35,608 --> 01:13:37,978
- Seriously, you understand?
- What're you guys laughing at?

1307
01:13:38,018 --> 01:13:40,178
- Baby batter.
- Shut the fuck up, Ben.

1308
01:13:40,218 --> 01:13:43,878
Hey, Elliot, better dance
with me tomorrow night.

1309
01:13:43,918 --> 01:13:48,917
Um, dancing isn't
particularly my thing.

1310
01:13:48,957 --> 01:13:51,287
Wait, that's not true.
You can do the macarena.

1311
01:13:51,327 --> 01:13:53,297
Really, Elliot?

1312
01:13:53,327 --> 01:13:55,542
You don't know what the fuck
you're talking about, Ben.

1313
01:13:55,566 --> 01:13:57,672
Yeah, I do. 'Cause mom taught
you and you taught me.

1314
01:13:57,696 --> 01:14:01,836
You were good. Remember?

1315
01:14:02,066 --> 01:14:05,005
You guys know about
my brother Ben, right?

1316
01:14:05,035 --> 01:14:07,135
You know how he
has severe autism?

1317
01:14:08,975 --> 01:14:11,175
You don't wanna talk
about it too much,

1318
01:14:11,215 --> 01:14:15,164
Because if you talk about severe
autism to the retard too much,

1319
01:14:15,214 --> 01:14:17,474
Then he gets low self-esteem,
and that's not good.

1320
01:14:17,514 --> 01:14:19,074
Right, Ben?

1321
01:14:19,154 --> 01:14:20,514
Isn't that right?

1322
01:14:23,384 --> 01:14:25,983
Samantha, care for a smoke?

1323
01:14:26,023 --> 01:14:28,353
You don't?

1324
01:14:28,393 --> 01:14:30,333
It would make you look
so much more attractive.

1325
01:14:31,993 --> 01:14:34,792
Oh, my god, she is
such a fucking bitch.

1326
01:14:34,832 --> 01:14:39,362
Better to be pale.
It's better to...

1327
01:14:41,172 --> 01:14:43,432
- Is he all right?
- He's fine.

1328
01:14:43,472 --> 01:14:46,131
I'll tell you, you
can't find a better beer.

1329
01:14:46,171 --> 01:14:48,511
Than this Michelob Ultra.

1330
01:14:48,541 --> 01:14:53,411
It's almost zero carbs.
How 'bout that?

1331
01:14:53,451 --> 01:14:54,541
Interesting.

1332
01:15:15,868 --> 01:15:18,838
Is he all right?

1333
01:15:18,868 --> 01:15:20,838
He's fine.

1334
01:15:20,878 --> 01:15:23,068
We have them made
for us in Indiana.

1335
01:15:23,108 --> 01:15:25,407
- And really, the money is...
- Right.

1336
01:15:25,447 --> 01:15:28,007
Now the deal with GM,
was for carriages?

1337
01:15:28,047 --> 01:15:30,786
- They don't look the same.
- Cubic zirconias look the same.

1338
01:15:30,787 --> 01:15:32,617
I know, but I'm talking...

1339
01:15:32,647 --> 01:15:34,533
It's just a status thing.
I just don't get that.

1340
01:15:34,557 --> 01:15:36,257
It's interesting,

1341
01:15:36,286 --> 01:15:40,086
Most people think that when
rock 'n' roll first hit...

1342
01:15:40,126 --> 01:15:42,456
Boom... that there
was nothing else.

1343
01:15:42,496 --> 01:15:46,925
Not true, because what most
people don't remember.

1344
01:15:46,965 --> 01:15:50,765
Was that there was
this strange time,

1345
01:15:50,805 --> 01:15:52,425
Maybe three or four years,

1346
01:15:52,465 --> 01:15:56,424
When everything sort of
coincided so that you had...

1347
01:15:56,474 --> 01:15:59,374
You had your Perry Comos
and your Bill Haleys.

1348
01:15:59,444 --> 01:16:00,964
And your Pat Boones.

1349
01:16:01,014 --> 01:16:04,943
And you had people
like Jill Corey.

1350
01:16:04,983 --> 01:16:06,083
You remember?

1351
01:16:06,113 --> 01:16:07,713
No.

1352
01:16:07,753 --> 01:16:09,559
Yeah, you do, because
I played you that song.

1353
01:16:09,583 --> 01:16:11,113
<i>"Make Like A Bunny Honey".</i>

1354
01:16:11,153 --> 01:16:13,743
I'm gonna go call granny
and check on everybody.

1355
01:16:13,823 --> 01:16:15,182
See how they are
at the hospital.

1356
01:16:15,222 --> 01:16:17,452
Good. Tell them we're
praying for them.

1357
01:16:22,132 --> 01:16:24,362
- Hey.
- Hey.

1358
01:16:24,402 --> 01:16:27,461
Look, um,
I just want to say l...

1359
01:16:27,501 --> 01:16:31,331
I think we got off on the wrong
foot back at the house.

1360
01:16:31,371 --> 01:16:35,330
And... and all I really
wanted to convey to you.

1361
01:16:35,370 --> 01:16:37,930
Was that... that I really
have missed you.

1362
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:40,710
That we, all, have missed you.

1363
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:42,980
Your mother said that you
weren't feeling good.

1364
01:16:43,010 --> 01:16:45,709
And so I just didn't
know what to expect.

1365
01:16:45,779 --> 01:16:47,409
Well, after
everything you heard,

1366
01:16:47,449 --> 01:16:49,039
I hope I didn't disappoint you.

1367
01:16:49,149 --> 01:16:50,179
Disappoint me?

1368
01:16:50,219 --> 01:16:53,489
No, no way, no. No.

1369
01:16:53,519 --> 01:16:55,248
What does that mean?

1370
01:16:55,288 --> 01:16:58,058
Sorry, I'm just being
kind of awkward.

1371
01:16:58,098 --> 01:17:01,898
Um...

1372
01:17:01,928 --> 01:17:04,368
Dylan told me that you
gave him a big promotion.

1373
01:17:04,398 --> 01:17:06,427
That's... yeah,
that's really great.

1374
01:17:06,497 --> 01:17:08,227
- He deserves it.
- Yeah.

1375
01:17:08,267 --> 01:17:11,297
Done a great job, but he's
gotta build towards something,

1376
01:17:11,337 --> 01:17:12,337
Like you're doing.

1377
01:17:12,407 --> 01:17:14,137
Yeah, thanks.

1378
01:17:14,177 --> 01:17:16,976
I mean, I had to take
some time off, but, um,

1379
01:17:17,006 --> 01:17:19,106
I'm doubling up on courses
for September.

1380
01:17:19,146 --> 01:17:20,336
So I can graduate on time.

1381
01:17:20,616 --> 01:17:22,016
- That's good.
- Yeah.

1382
01:17:22,046 --> 01:17:24,885
I'm... I'm so happy you
finally found something.

1383
01:17:24,915 --> 01:17:29,085
I mean, I really love it.
You know. I...

1384
01:17:29,125 --> 01:17:31,385
I don't know, I feel like maybe

1385
01:17:31,425 --> 01:17:35,054
I have something to
offer there in a way.

1386
01:17:35,094 --> 01:17:39,254
Alice, I know everybody thinks.

1387
01:17:39,334 --> 01:17:44,703
That I don't understand
everything.

1388
01:17:44,773 --> 01:17:46,933
And maybe they're right.

1389
01:17:46,973 --> 01:17:51,103
But I want to. I do.

1390
01:17:51,143 --> 01:17:53,133
Thanks, Paul.

1391
01:17:53,173 --> 01:17:56,272
And you know, if you ever
want to just phone me,

1392
01:17:56,312 --> 01:17:58,842
Or just wanna talk,

1393
01:17:58,882 --> 01:18:00,902
Maybe you're feeling
down or something,

1394
01:18:00,952 --> 01:18:03,882
I just don't want to
lose touch with you again.

1395
01:18:03,922 --> 01:18:06,081
If that's what you want.

1396
01:18:09,691 --> 01:18:13,091
Yeah, I mean, I'd...
I'd really like that.

1397
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:19,030
Maybe we could, um,

1398
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:23,060
Get lunch, or something.

1399
01:18:35,248 --> 01:18:39,618
I mean, um, maybe it could...

1400
01:18:41,158 --> 01:18:44,917
Maybe it could
just be me and you.

1401
01:18:59,066 --> 01:19:01,096
She's my wife.

1402
01:19:01,136 --> 01:19:03,666
Alice...

1403
01:19:11,015 --> 01:19:12,645
I know.

1404
01:19:23,324 --> 01:19:25,723
Uh, excuse me, barkeep.

1405
01:19:25,763 --> 01:19:27,093
Yeah?

1406
01:19:27,123 --> 01:19:30,363
Um, can I get three shots...
double shots.

1407
01:19:30,393 --> 01:19:32,363
Of your finest whiskey, please?

1408
01:19:32,403 --> 01:19:35,832
Um, how old are you?

1409
01:19:35,902 --> 01:19:37,962
Okay, I'm 17,

1410
01:19:38,002 --> 01:19:40,702
This is my family
and this is hell.

1411
01:19:40,742 --> 01:19:44,042
I beg you.
Have some fucking sympathy.

1412
01:19:44,072 --> 01:19:45,671
I call it my Thursday list.

1413
01:19:45,711 --> 01:19:47,331
Alice is hysterical
in the parking lot.

1414
01:19:47,381 --> 01:19:48,441
Give me my purse.

1415
01:19:48,481 --> 01:19:50,311
Grab the kids. I need to pee.

1416
01:19:50,351 --> 01:19:51,781
Alrighty.

1417
01:19:54,650 --> 01:19:57,180
Um, do you, like, drink often?

1418
01:19:57,220 --> 01:19:59,590
Only really when I'm on opiates.

1419
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:01,750
Okay.

1420
01:20:01,790 --> 01:20:05,059
But, like,
what I was, like, saying,

1421
01:20:05,099 --> 01:20:10,059
Is that, like, my mother
really is the one who, like,

1422
01:20:10,129 --> 01:20:13,189
Raised Dylan, not your mother.

1423
01:20:13,239 --> 01:20:17,898
And, like, I don't mean that in,
like, an offensive way,

1424
01:20:17,938 --> 01:20:19,908
It's just, like, the truth.

1425
01:20:19,938 --> 01:20:22,808
And, like, I guess,
like what I want to say.

1426
01:20:22,848 --> 01:20:27,607
Is that, like, I think it's,
like, pretty disrespectful.

1427
01:20:27,687 --> 01:20:31,677
That, like, your mother
forced Dylan to choose her.

1428
01:20:31,717 --> 01:20:33,947
To walking down the aisle.

1429
01:20:33,987 --> 01:20:36,076
Mmm.

1430
01:20:36,126 --> 01:20:39,386
So, yeah.

1431
01:20:44,795 --> 01:20:48,255
You wanna know
something hilarious?

1432
01:20:48,305 --> 01:20:50,025
Sure.

1433
01:20:50,105 --> 01:20:51,225
You sure?

1434
01:21:35,210 --> 01:21:37,440
Sounds like you're finished.

1435
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:38,880
What?

1436
01:21:38,910 --> 01:21:40,900
Sounds like you're finished.

1437
01:21:40,950 --> 01:21:42,210
Wait, what?

1438
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:43,440
Come on out, Lynn.

1439
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:44,779
Why?

1440
01:21:44,819 --> 01:21:48,119
Come out of the stall, Lynn.

1441
01:21:48,159 --> 01:21:49,259
Okay, but, um...

1442
01:21:49,289 --> 01:21:51,159
Oh, my god. There you are.

1443
01:21:51,189 --> 01:21:53,205
I've been, like, looking,
like, all over for you.

1444
01:21:53,229 --> 01:21:55,099
You will never,
ever, ever believe.

1445
01:21:55,128 --> 01:21:56,318
What Elliot just said to me.

1446
01:21:56,358 --> 01:21:58,848
He's, like, so arrogant,
and also.

1447
01:21:58,898 --> 01:22:00,798
A complete, drunk drug addict.

1448
01:22:00,828 --> 01:22:03,888
He ordered, like, three double
shots of, like, whatever,

1449
01:22:03,938 --> 01:22:06,097
And I was like, um,
do you drink often?

1450
01:22:06,167 --> 01:22:08,727
And he was like,
I like to mix it with opiates.

1451
01:22:08,777 --> 01:22:09,897
So gross.

1452
01:22:09,937 --> 01:22:11,237
- They're disgusting.
- So gross.

1453
01:22:11,277 --> 01:22:12,937
The whole family's disgusting.

1454
01:22:12,977 --> 01:22:15,776
I know. They're disgusting.
I hate them.

1455
01:22:15,816 --> 01:22:17,646
Who was that?

1456
01:22:17,686 --> 01:22:19,276
Like, didn't even
wash her hands.

1457
01:22:19,316 --> 01:22:20,976
Good god, Paul.

1458
01:22:21,016 --> 01:22:23,176
Can't you keep
that fucking pit bull.

1459
01:22:23,216 --> 01:22:24,655
Of your wife under control?

1460
01:22:24,685 --> 01:22:28,915
Elliot says that Lynn says
that when dad met you,

1461
01:22:28,955 --> 01:22:31,325
You were a stripper.

1462
01:22:31,365 --> 01:22:33,725
And a coke whore.

1463
01:22:34,764 --> 01:22:36,094
- Mmm.
- Is that true?

1464
01:22:36,134 --> 01:22:37,934
- Really.
- Is that true?

1465
01:22:39,964 --> 01:22:41,964
Baby, it's ridiculous.

1466
01:22:42,004 --> 01:22:44,164
Mom, now you promise me
that's not true.

1467
01:22:44,204 --> 01:22:46,693
- That piece of shit!
- You lying whore.

1468
01:22:46,743 --> 01:22:47,933
What? What?

1469
01:22:47,973 --> 01:22:49,843
Have you been telling your kids.

1470
01:22:49,873 --> 01:22:51,533
That I was a stripper
and a coke whore?

1471
01:22:51,583 --> 01:22:53,633
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

1472
01:22:53,683 --> 01:22:55,742
- I didn't say that!
- Lynn, did you say that?

1473
01:22:55,812 --> 01:22:58,282
- No, of course not!
- That's what Elliot told me!

1474
01:22:58,322 --> 01:23:00,112
Fuck him!
He's a fucking asshole!

1475
01:23:00,152 --> 01:23:01,672
Oh, what a good mother you are.

1476
01:23:01,722 --> 01:23:03,652
You're such a good mother.
So sweet.

1477
01:23:03,692 --> 01:23:05,951
Elliot has Tourette's syndrome!
He'll say anything!

1478
01:23:05,991 --> 01:23:07,751
He has no filter!

1479
01:23:07,791 --> 01:23:09,790
Meanwhile you come
waltzing into this family.

1480
01:23:09,791 --> 01:23:11,521
And you try to
rip us fucking apart!

1481
01:23:11,561 --> 01:23:15,090
I tried to rip your family
apart? Are you joking me?

1482
01:23:15,130 --> 01:23:17,790
I raised Dylan. I'm not
the one who abandoned him.

1483
01:23:22,610 --> 01:23:26,199
You could go fuck yourself!
You fucking redneck...

1484
01:23:31,619 --> 01:23:33,309
Let go of her!

1485
01:23:33,349 --> 01:23:35,908
Goddamnit, let go of her!

1486
01:23:37,958 --> 01:23:40,008
You found someone to
fight back, didn't you?

1487
01:23:40,058 --> 01:23:42,078
You're goddamn right,
I'll fucking tear you apart!

1488
01:23:42,128 --> 01:23:43,958
She's gone!

1489
01:23:56,606 --> 01:23:59,596
Get out. Get out.
You son of a bitch.

1490
01:23:59,636 --> 01:24:01,182
Think you just insulted
yourself, mom.

1491
01:24:01,206 --> 01:24:03,206
Shut up and go fuck yourself!

1492
01:24:03,246 --> 01:24:04,805
- What did I do?
- Go fuck yourself.

1493
01:24:04,845 --> 01:24:06,505
The hell is going on?

1494
01:24:06,545 --> 01:24:08,065
She grabbed me. She grabbed me.

1495
01:24:08,115 --> 01:24:11,105
And she... she strangled me.

1496
01:24:11,155 --> 01:24:12,815
- What? Who?
- Patty!

1497
01:24:12,855 --> 01:24:13,945
Patty assaulted me, Lee.

1498
01:24:13,985 --> 01:24:15,784
- Really?
- Really?

1499
01:24:15,824 --> 01:24:17,984
- And this motherfucker...
- Okay, that's weird, mom.

1500
01:24:18,024 --> 01:24:20,514
This motherfucker has been
drinking and doing drugs.

1501
01:24:20,594 --> 01:24:22,084
Calm down, calm down.

1502
01:24:22,124 --> 01:24:25,093
I had a few, I had anxiety,
I had a fucking panic attack.

1503
01:24:25,133 --> 01:24:26,853
Let's just get in the car.
Get in the car.

1504
01:24:26,893 --> 01:24:28,623
Shut up!

1505
01:24:28,663 --> 01:24:30,133
In the car.

1506
01:24:30,163 --> 01:24:32,163
- She's pissed.
- Oh, she's pissed, Ben?

1507
01:24:32,203 --> 01:24:34,193
Thank you for telling
me that she's pissed.

1508
01:24:34,233 --> 01:24:36,702
Otherwise I would
have no idea, Ben.

1509
01:24:39,042 --> 01:24:42,072
- Door is locked.
- Oh, this fucking thing.

1510
01:24:44,012 --> 01:24:45,601
Lee, open the door.

1511
01:24:45,681 --> 01:24:48,711
Goddamnit.

1512
01:24:48,751 --> 01:24:50,841
Now why the hell they
can't make these things.

1513
01:24:50,881 --> 01:24:52,151
A little bit simpler?

1514
01:24:52,191 --> 01:24:54,520
It's 12:13 ante meridian,

1515
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:56,466
And I'm reporting to you
live and on the scene.

1516
01:24:56,490 --> 01:24:58,220
Outside the home
of Joe and Doris Baker.

1517
01:24:58,260 --> 01:24:59,780
In the heart of Queen Anne City,

1518
01:24:59,830 --> 01:25:01,090
Annapolis, Maryland,

1519
01:25:01,130 --> 01:25:03,100
Where just moments ago.

1520
01:25:03,130 --> 01:25:06,589
The diabolical force,
known as the Hellman family,

1521
01:25:06,629 --> 01:25:09,119
Has finally submerged this
quaint, waterfront town.

1522
01:25:09,199 --> 01:25:11,969
Into complete and utter chaos.

1523
01:25:12,009 --> 01:25:15,168
With their overly sensitive
self-destructive daughter,

1524
01:25:15,208 --> 01:25:17,068
Alice Scissorhands,

1525
01:25:17,108 --> 01:25:19,168
And the rather unseemly
and highly inappropriate.

1526
01:25:19,208 --> 01:25:20,838
Behavior of their mama familias,

1527
01:25:20,878 --> 01:25:22,908
Some have begun to wonder,

1528
01:25:22,948 --> 01:25:25,747
How will tomorrow's
events unfold?

1529
01:25:25,787 --> 01:25:30,547
Oh, wait, one moment.

1530
01:25:30,587 --> 01:25:32,857
I'm getting something.

1531
01:25:32,887 --> 01:25:35,516
Preliminary reports
are suggesting.

1532
01:25:35,556 --> 01:25:39,186
That no matter the outcome,
Doris Baker is.

1533
01:25:39,226 --> 01:25:43,636
And will remain quietly furious.

1534
01:25:43,666 --> 01:25:46,795
The question that begs to be
answered however, is,

1535
01:25:46,835 --> 01:25:50,865
Will they unite
for just one day?

1536
01:25:50,905 --> 01:25:54,774
Or will all hell break loose and
split this family in two.

1537
01:25:54,814 --> 01:25:57,044
Like a Maryland blue crab?

1538
01:26:02,614 --> 01:26:07,023
This is Elliot Hellman reporting
to you live for Fuck News.

1539
01:26:07,053 --> 01:26:08,453
Back over to you, Ben.

1540
01:26:15,692 --> 01:26:18,022
What's the name
of that tea I like?

1541
01:26:18,062 --> 01:26:19,972
Which one?

1542
01:26:21,972 --> 01:26:24,022
The one I drink.

1543
01:26:24,072 --> 01:26:25,531
Green tea.

1544
01:26:25,571 --> 01:26:27,001
No, no, it's chamomile.

1545
01:26:27,041 --> 01:26:29,131
So why are you asking me?

1546
01:26:29,171 --> 01:26:31,401
I'm asking what it's name is.

1547
01:26:31,441 --> 01:26:36,170
Surrender. Surrender.

1548
01:26:36,210 --> 01:26:41,670
Yeah. Surrender to sleep.

1549
01:26:45,089 --> 01:26:49,619
Jesus Christ, Lee.

1550
01:26:49,659 --> 01:26:51,789
Why don't you just ask for it?

1551
01:26:55,698 --> 01:26:58,628
No, no.
Never turn that light on.

1552
01:27:18,156 --> 01:27:20,386
Mom, can I talk to you
for a minute?

1553
01:27:20,416 --> 01:27:22,816
No, Lynn, you can't.

1554
01:27:22,856 --> 01:27:27,485
Why is it you have never learned
when to just keep quiet?

1555
01:27:27,525 --> 01:27:29,555
I just wanted...

1556
01:27:29,595 --> 01:27:33,035
I know what you want.
We all know what you want, Lynn.

1557
01:27:33,065 --> 01:27:34,724
'Cause you never had the decency.

1558
01:27:34,764 --> 01:27:36,664
Or the respect or the
consideration.

1559
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:38,964
To keep anything private.

1560
01:27:39,004 --> 01:27:41,974
I'm just trying
to make things better.

1561
01:27:42,004 --> 01:27:45,443
Yeah, yeah.
For who, Lynn? For me?

1562
01:27:45,473 --> 01:27:48,033
Huh? Sitting here in
the middle of the night.

1563
01:27:48,083 --> 01:27:50,773
And I can't sleep.

1564
01:27:50,813 --> 01:27:54,842
I'm totally exhausted
and I can't get to sleep.

1565
01:27:54,882 --> 01:27:56,682
You're gonna make
things better for me?

1566
01:27:59,522 --> 01:28:01,992
The doctor said he's stable.

1567
01:28:02,022 --> 01:28:04,791
They can't do anything
else for him.

1568
01:28:07,561 --> 01:28:10,551
Just keep him comfortable.

1569
01:28:10,601 --> 01:28:13,401
It's all...

1570
01:28:13,431 --> 01:28:17,100
It's all I've done
my whole life,

1571
01:28:17,140 --> 01:28:19,470
Kept him comfortable.

1572
01:28:27,349 --> 01:28:32,439
I was seventeen years old
when I met your father.

1573
01:28:32,489 --> 01:28:34,978
He was so handsome.

1574
01:28:37,388 --> 01:28:39,387
So tall.

1575
01:28:39,388 --> 01:28:44,587
And strong and shy.

1576
01:28:48,667 --> 01:28:50,357
I miss him.

1577
01:28:52,707 --> 01:28:54,936
I miss the man I married.

1578
01:28:54,976 --> 01:28:56,766
I miss him when he's here.

1579
01:28:56,806 --> 01:28:58,366
And I miss him
when he's not here.

1580
01:29:00,846 --> 01:29:02,866
Tonight I was lying
in bed and I thought.

1581
01:29:02,916 --> 01:29:05,705
When did this happen?

1582
01:29:05,745 --> 01:29:08,585
When did he disappear?

1583
01:29:10,555 --> 01:29:14,425
When did I first fall asleep.

1584
01:29:14,455 --> 01:29:17,584
In an empty bed?

1585
01:29:17,624 --> 01:29:19,824
In an empty house?

1586
01:29:24,593 --> 01:29:28,033
What did I do to deserve this?

1587
01:29:31,073 --> 01:29:34,003
What did I ever do
that was so bad?

1588
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:39,872
And I know it's coming. I know.

1589
01:29:42,452 --> 01:29:47,441
Every time I wake up, before
I open my eyes and listen,

1590
01:29:47,481 --> 01:29:52,391
Hear if he's still breathing.

1591
01:29:54,790 --> 01:29:57,620
I don't know what
I'm going to do...

1592
01:30:01,060 --> 01:30:04,499
When I wake up and he's not.

1593
01:30:04,529 --> 01:30:09,469
When there's nothing
but the silence.

1594
01:30:09,509 --> 01:30:12,739
Just silence.

1595
01:30:12,779 --> 01:30:14,109
What am I going to do, Lynn?

1596
01:30:18,078 --> 01:30:20,448
Okay, okay, okay.

1597
01:30:20,478 --> 01:30:24,078
So?

1598
01:30:24,118 --> 01:30:28,647
There it goes, huh?
There it goes, Lynn.

1599
01:30:28,687 --> 01:30:31,657
You got me.

1600
01:30:31,697 --> 01:30:34,357
That's what you came
down here for, isn't it?

1601
01:32:32,935 --> 01:32:35,404
I wasn't ready.

1602
01:32:35,434 --> 01:32:38,464
I'm still not ready.

1603
01:32:38,504 --> 01:32:42,344
Things don't change, mom.

1604
01:32:44,743 --> 01:32:46,733
People don't change.

1605
01:32:53,153 --> 01:32:54,842
They don't matter.

1606
01:32:54,892 --> 01:32:59,692
You do, Alice. You do.

1607
01:32:59,722 --> 01:33:03,452
And you can't let them
tell you who you are.

1608
01:33:03,492 --> 01:33:04,931
Or what you're capable of,

1609
01:33:04,961 --> 01:33:08,270
Because if you do,
then they win.

1610
01:33:08,271 --> 01:33:10,270
I'm not like you, mom. I'm not.

1611
01:33:10,271 --> 01:33:12,671
I wish... I can't just
block it all out.

1612
01:33:12,701 --> 01:33:15,540
Don't do this, Alice.

1613
01:33:15,570 --> 01:33:18,870
Don't let them control the way
you feel about yourself.

1614
01:33:19,510 --> 01:33:23,310
I can't help it. I can't.

1615
01:33:23,350 --> 01:33:25,749
You're your own person.

1616
01:33:25,779 --> 01:33:27,839
And you're strong.

1617
01:33:27,879 --> 01:33:31,409
You're so goddamn strong, Alice.

1618
01:33:31,449 --> 01:33:34,358
And when it was just you and me,

1619
01:33:34,359 --> 01:33:37,858
And we didn't have a fucking
soul on our side,

1620
01:33:39,598 --> 01:33:41,758
I looked to you.

1621
01:33:42,798 --> 01:33:45,357
I always looked to you.

1622
01:34:20,294 --> 01:34:22,734
You know,
if you don't mind, ladies,

1623
01:34:22,764 --> 01:34:24,254
I would just like to say how.

1624
01:34:24,304 --> 01:34:26,393
Unbelievably gorgeous
you two look today.

1625
01:34:26,433 --> 01:34:29,373
Just tremendous, you know?
Stunning. Marvelous.

1626
01:34:29,403 --> 01:34:31,179
You know what, Elliot,
I would appreciate it.

1627
01:34:31,203 --> 01:34:33,212
If you did not speak
for the next 24 hours.

1628
01:34:33,213 --> 01:34:34,672
Why?

1629
01:34:34,712 --> 01:34:36,442
'Cause mom caught you
doing drugs and shit.

1630
01:34:36,482 --> 01:34:38,542
And, like, it's your
fault Patty went nuts.

1631
01:34:38,582 --> 01:34:40,482
Oh, I mean, yeah. That's true.

1632
01:34:40,512 --> 01:34:42,528
But I thought maybe we
could've moved on from that.

1633
01:34:42,552 --> 01:34:43,842
You know, as a family.

1634
01:34:43,882 --> 01:34:46,351
I just don't have the energy
to move on from that.

1635
01:34:46,421 --> 01:34:49,451
As a family.

1636
01:34:49,491 --> 01:34:51,921
- Oooh, shit.
- "Oooh, shit" is right.

1637
01:34:51,961 --> 01:34:53,721
What, you too? No understanding.

1638
01:34:53,791 --> 01:34:55,936
What's the matter, dad?
You never got drunk or stoned.

1639
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:56,990
When you were my age?

1640
01:34:57,030 --> 01:34:58,199
Not with the frequency.

1641
01:34:58,200 --> 01:35:00,330
And degree of enthusiasm
that you do now.

1642
01:35:00,370 --> 01:35:04,569
You, mom? You never skin popped
a little "D" back in the '70s?

1643
01:35:04,599 --> 01:35:06,199
You know what, Elliot,
do me a favor.

1644
01:35:06,269 --> 01:35:09,209
Just go ahead.
Go, go, go get high.

1645
01:35:09,279 --> 01:35:11,839
Go O.D. Ruin your fucking life.

1646
01:35:11,879 --> 01:35:14,538
Because I'm giving up.
I'm just giving up.

1647
01:35:14,578 --> 01:35:16,568
Really? That is awesome!
Wait, really?

1648
01:35:16,618 --> 01:35:18,348
Let's not get into
this right now.

1649
01:35:18,388 --> 01:35:19,794
Can I? 'Cause that
would be great.

1650
01:35:19,818 --> 01:35:21,518
- Elliot!
- What?

1651
01:35:21,548 --> 01:35:24,577
Why do you have to be
such a fucking dick?

1652
01:35:24,617 --> 01:35:26,677
What are you so pissy about?

1653
01:35:26,757 --> 01:35:28,817
Your chamber maiden dress?

1654
01:35:28,857 --> 01:35:31,957
See?

1655
01:35:31,997 --> 01:35:34,595
You're just so immature,
you know?

1656
01:35:34,596 --> 01:35:36,826
When are you gonna
grow the fuck up?

1657
01:35:36,866 --> 01:35:40,266
You know, sometime near the end.

1658
01:35:52,845 --> 01:35:55,614
Oh, there's me!

1659
01:36:13,903 --> 01:36:19,202
And so he sees a road sign
with a trumpet exed out on it.

1660
01:36:19,242 --> 01:36:21,672
And he says to me, dad,

1661
01:36:21,712 --> 01:36:25,111
How come people aren't allowed
to play the trumpet here?

1662
01:36:25,141 --> 01:36:27,111
I said, aw, Dylan,

1663
01:36:27,211 --> 01:36:29,581
It means you're not allowed
to honk your car horn.

1664
01:36:31,411 --> 01:36:35,150
But I just wanna raise
a toast to Dylan.

1665
01:36:35,190 --> 01:36:36,850
And his lovely bride, Heather.

1666
01:36:36,890 --> 01:36:40,550
I know they're gonna have a long
and wonderful life together.

1667
01:36:40,590 --> 01:36:45,289
I also wanna take a moment to
thank Patty, my lovely bride,

1668
01:36:45,329 --> 01:36:48,319
For putting together the
reception and the tent,

1669
01:36:48,359 --> 01:36:50,199
And such a lovely slide show.

1670
01:36:50,229 --> 01:36:52,599
That so wonderfully
captured our family.

1671
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:54,998
And last before I sit down,

1672
01:36:55,038 --> 01:36:57,728
I just wanted to say
thank you to Alice.

1673
01:36:57,768 --> 01:37:00,538
For coming home on such
a joyous occasion.

1674
01:37:00,578 --> 01:37:02,638
I know it means
a lot to her brother.

1675
01:37:02,678 --> 01:37:04,477
And it means a lot
to the whole family.

1676
01:37:04,507 --> 01:37:07,537
So, thank you, Alice.

1677
01:37:11,247 --> 01:37:15,246
And I always loved
Marilyn Monroe, obviously.

1678
01:37:17,226 --> 01:37:21,456
So I said, now when you get up
to bat, you remember,

1679
01:37:21,496 --> 01:37:25,125
I'm Marilyn Monroe,
and you're Joe DiMaggio.

1680
01:37:25,165 --> 01:37:28,255
So you look over at me.

1681
01:37:28,295 --> 01:37:31,295
And I'm gonna blow
you a little kiss.

1682
01:37:31,335 --> 01:37:34,704
And you are gonna hit it
right out of the park.

1683
01:37:34,774 --> 01:37:38,474
And you know what? He did.

1684
01:37:38,514 --> 01:37:41,604
Okay, let's say
most of the time.

1685
01:37:41,644 --> 01:37:45,543
But did you notice today,

1686
01:37:45,583 --> 01:37:48,213
When you stepped up to bat,

1687
01:37:48,253 --> 01:37:51,083
I blew you a little kiss.

1688
01:37:52,753 --> 01:37:56,122
Anyways, I love you, Dylan.

1689
01:37:56,162 --> 01:37:58,531
And I am so happy.

1690
01:37:58,532 --> 01:38:02,092
That you hit another
homer with Heather.

1691
01:38:02,132 --> 01:38:06,061
And I know in my
heart of hearts,

1692
01:38:06,101 --> 01:38:10,231
That you two are a match
made in heaven.

1693
01:38:10,271 --> 01:38:12,201
I love you.

1694
01:38:12,241 --> 01:38:15,300
I love you.

1695
01:38:20,010 --> 01:38:22,749
Lynn? Lynn.

1696
01:38:22,750 --> 01:38:26,779
Would you like to come up
and share any stories.

1697
01:38:26,819 --> 01:38:29,249
Of Dylan when he was
a little boy?

1698
01:38:35,088 --> 01:38:37,788
Come on, give her
a little encouragement.

1699
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:05,785
Um, I'm Dylan's mother, Lynn.

1700
01:39:05,825 --> 01:39:10,385
And, uh, I'm not very good
at this kind of thing.

1701
01:39:10,455 --> 01:39:15,584
I... I don't really have
any stories right now.

1702
01:39:15,634 --> 01:39:19,324
I didn't expect to speak.

1703
01:39:19,404 --> 01:39:24,304
So, I guess, l...

1704
01:39:24,334 --> 01:39:29,803
I guess I just wanna say
how grateful I am to...

1705
01:39:29,843 --> 01:39:34,542
To be a part of this
moment in your life.

1706
01:39:34,612 --> 01:39:38,312
And how happy I am
for the both of you.

1707
01:39:38,352 --> 01:39:41,012
I am.

1708
01:39:44,052 --> 01:39:47,060
And I'm sorry I don't
have any funny stories.

1709
01:39:47,061 --> 01:39:49,491
From when you were a little boy.

1710
01:39:52,661 --> 01:39:55,630
I just know that l...

1711
01:39:55,670 --> 01:40:00,030
I just know that I love
you so much right now.

1712
01:40:00,070 --> 01:40:03,600
I love you so much, Dylan.

1713
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:08,669
You've grown into
such an amazing man.

1714
01:40:08,709 --> 01:40:12,048
And when I look at you now,

1715
01:40:12,049 --> 01:40:15,478
I'm so proud of you.

1716
01:40:15,518 --> 01:40:19,108
I'm so proud of the
man you've become.

1717
01:40:21,588 --> 01:40:23,148
That's all.

1718
01:42:42,384 --> 01:42:43,574
Hey, Lee.

1719
01:42:43,614 --> 01:42:44,673
Hey.

1720
01:42:44,713 --> 01:42:46,183
You know,

1721
01:42:46,223 --> 01:42:51,053
You never get a band
at these things anymore.

1722
01:42:51,093 --> 01:42:55,152
God, we had a fantastic band.

1723
01:43:00,432 --> 01:43:03,062
You know, Ben, I think my
youngest daughter.

1724
01:43:03,102 --> 01:43:05,471
Has a little crush on you.

1725
01:43:08,401 --> 01:43:11,671
Alice, do you think, uh,
maybe you and I could.

1726
01:43:11,711 --> 01:43:13,371
Have a word in private?

1727
01:43:13,411 --> 01:43:14,500
Just...

1728
01:43:14,540 --> 01:43:17,310
I'd rather not, Paul.

1729
01:43:17,350 --> 01:43:20,340
Just for a second. I was just...

1730
01:43:20,380 --> 01:43:22,440
No.

1731
01:43:22,490 --> 01:43:24,010
It won't take long.

1732
01:43:24,050 --> 01:43:29,509
Paul, no.

1733
01:43:31,059 --> 01:43:36,118
Okay. Read you loud and clear.

1734
01:43:36,168 --> 01:43:39,498
Just like when you
were a little girl.

1735
01:43:39,538 --> 01:43:42,198
Message received. Okay.

1736
01:43:42,238 --> 01:43:44,667
Lee, it's good seeing you.

1737
01:43:47,407 --> 01:43:52,247
That was, like, the most
bad ass thing I've ever seen.

1738
01:44:14,534 --> 01:44:17,894
Mom, can I talk to you
for a minute?

1739
01:44:17,934 --> 01:44:21,264
Excuse me.

1740
01:44:26,943 --> 01:44:31,573
Mom, don't you have
anything to say to me?

1741
01:44:31,613 --> 01:44:33,373
What do you want me to say?

1742
01:44:33,413 --> 01:44:38,282
I wanna know why
you weren't on my side.

1743
01:44:40,392 --> 01:44:42,682
You're my mother.

1744
01:44:42,722 --> 01:44:46,161
Why didn't you help me
fight for my children?

1745
01:44:46,191 --> 01:44:49,031
Why couldn't you help me
fight for Dylan?

1746
01:44:49,061 --> 01:44:51,051
Christ's sakes, Lynn.

1747
01:44:51,101 --> 01:44:55,000
It's Dylan's wedding.
Can't you just let it be?

1748
01:44:55,030 --> 01:44:57,160
Um, have you guys seen Elliot?

1749
01:44:57,200 --> 01:44:59,430
Because, no one knows
where he went.

1750
01:45:04,340 --> 01:45:06,569
How you doing, grampa?

1751
01:45:06,609 --> 01:45:08,439
I'm doing okay.

1752
01:45:08,479 --> 01:45:11,419
But I gotta get out there
and do some yard work.

1753
01:45:11,449 --> 01:45:13,888
Yeah, I feel you.

1754
01:45:13,889 --> 01:45:15,408
Try to plow some of these
bridesmaids.

1755
01:45:15,448 --> 01:45:17,048
If that's what you're
talking about.

1756
01:45:17,088 --> 01:45:20,348
That isn't what
I'm talking about.

1757
01:45:27,567 --> 01:45:32,197
Elliot! Elliot?

1758
01:45:54,424 --> 01:45:57,394
Elliot!

1759
01:45:57,424 --> 01:46:01,554
Now.. we gotta watch out
what we're doing.

1760
01:46:01,594 --> 01:46:04,493
It's dark out here.

1761
01:46:04,533 --> 01:46:08,263
Okay. Here we go.

1762
01:46:27,551 --> 01:46:30,951
So he has nothing to lose.

1763
01:46:30,991 --> 01:46:33,481
And he breaks up
with his fiance?

1764
01:46:33,521 --> 01:46:36,490
Lee. Lee?
I don't know what to do.

1765
01:46:36,530 --> 01:46:39,980
It's very late and I don't
know where Elliot is.

1766
01:46:40,030 --> 01:46:42,050
And I'm getting scared.

1767
01:46:42,100 --> 01:46:45,469
Well, where could he be?

1768
01:46:45,499 --> 01:46:49,559
His name is Elliot Hellman,
about six one, six two...

1769
01:46:49,609 --> 01:46:51,539
Okay, we're off.

1770
01:47:02,318 --> 01:47:04,477
Hey, uh, Aunt Lynn?

1771
01:47:04,517 --> 01:47:06,147
What?

1772
01:47:06,187 --> 01:47:08,987
I don't know if I saw Elliot
for sure, for sure,

1773
01:47:09,027 --> 01:47:12,477
But I think I saw him
in an inner tube.

1774
01:47:12,527 --> 01:47:15,016
Inner tube?

1775
01:47:15,056 --> 01:47:18,966
Yeah. Like, uh,
in the Chesapeake.

1776
01:47:18,996 --> 01:47:21,266
Oh, god.

1777
01:47:21,296 --> 01:47:22,826
What?

1778
01:47:22,906 --> 01:47:25,565
Is this the harbor master?

1779
01:47:25,605 --> 01:47:31,045
Okay, I think my wife's sister's
kid is out in the bay.

1780
01:47:31,075 --> 01:47:33,405
I think he's in an inner tube.

1781
01:47:41,954 --> 01:47:46,153
The fuck is that?

1782
01:48:49,277 --> 01:48:50,837
<i>Everything must change.</i>

1783
01:48:58,516 --> 01:49:01,246
<i>Nothing remains the same.</i>

1784
01:49:09,935 --> 01:49:12,985
<i>Everyone must change.</i>

1785
01:49:17,474 --> 01:49:22,204
<i>No one and nothing
remains the same.</i>

1786
01:49:29,483 --> 01:49:33,013
<i>Now the young's the old.</i>

1787
01:49:38,822 --> 01:49:43,452
<i>And mysteries do unfold.</i>

1788
01:49:48,531 --> 01:49:51,061
<i>Cause that's the way of time.</i>

1789
01:49:58,910 --> 01:50:03,040
<i>Nothing and no one
remains the same.</i>

1790
01:50:08,279 --> 01:50:13,019
<i>There are not so.</i>

1791
01:50:14,558 --> 01:50:18,318
<i>Many things in life.</i>

1792
01:50:18,358 --> 01:50:22,448
<i>You can be sure of.</i>

1793
01:50:24,497 --> 01:50:27,867
<i>Whoo.</i>

1794
01:50:29,267 --> 01:50:32,757
<i>Except the rain
comes from the clouds.</i>

1795
01:50:35,876 --> 01:50:39,466
<i>Sunlight from the sky.</i>

1796
01:50:39,516 --> 01:50:45,975
<i>And hummingbirds do fly.</i>

1797
01:50:48,015 --> 01:50:52,255
<i>Young becomes the old.</i>

1798
01:50:57,294 --> 01:51:02,894
<i>And mysteries do unfold.</i>

1799
01:51:09,873 --> 01:51:12,863
<i>That's the way of time.</i>

1800
01:51:18,242 --> 01:51:23,152
<i>Nothing, no one
remains unchanged.</i>

1801
01:51:27,391 --> 01:51:32,411
<i>There are so little things.</i>

1802
01:51:34,490 --> 01:51:38,229
<i>So few things in life.</i>

1803
01:51:38,230 --> 01:51:41,860
<i>You can be sure of.</i>

1804
01:51:49,479 --> 01:51:54,468
<i>Except rain comes
from the clouds.</i>

1805
01:51:56,778 --> 01:51:59,338
<i>Sunlight from the sky.</i>

1806
01:52:01,818 --> 01:52:07,047
<i>And humming birds do fly.</i>

1807
01:52:09,057 --> 01:52:13,957
<i>Everything's changed.</i>

1808
01:52:19,096 --> 01:52:22,156
<i>Everything.</i>

1809
01:52:25,305 --> 01:52:32,215
<i>Everything must change</i>
