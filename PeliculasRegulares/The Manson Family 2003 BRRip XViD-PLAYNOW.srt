1
00:01:23,444 --> 00:01:24,891
You better wise up,

2
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,119
the time is gonna come

3
00:01:26,214 --> 00:01:29,461
when all men will judge
themselves before God.

4
00:01:29,551 --> 00:01:31,054
It’ll be the worst hell.

5
00:01:31,153 --> 00:01:32,632
The worst Hell on Earth.

6
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,397
It’ll make Nazi Germany
look like a picnic.

7
00:01:35,491 --> 00:01:37,495
And you gotta be ready
for that, right now,

8
00:01:37,594 --> 00:01:38,733
right here right now,

9
00:01:38,828 --> 00:01:40,400
just like that!

10
00:01:40,497 --> 00:01:43,069
And that’s where
we’re at all the time.

11
00:01:43,165 --> 00:01:44,543
<i>Whatever is
necessary, you do it.</i>

12
00:01:44,633 --> 00:01:47,015
<i>When somebody needs to be
killed, there’s no wrong.</i>

13
00:01:47,104 --> 00:01:48,642
<i>You do it and move you on.</i>

14
00:01:48,738 --> 00:01:52,450
<i>There’s a revolution
coming very soon.</i>

15
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:54,352
You’ve lit the fuse yourself.

16
00:01:54,443 --> 00:01:57,155
We’re gonna cut and
chop all you fuckers up.

17
00:01:57,247 --> 00:02:00,459
L.A. will burn to the ground.

18
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,695
Los Angeles will
burn to the ground.

19
00:02:03,788 --> 00:02:07,203
<i>Once again, you’ve judged
a reflection of yourselves.</i>

20
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,736
<i>We are what you made us.</i>

21
00:02:08,826 --> 00:02:11,900
<i>And when your so betrayed.</i>

22
00:02:11,994 --> 00:02:15,138
<i>[Unintelligible]</i>

23
00:02:15,232 --> 00:02:16,770
<i>I don’t know who
fired the shot.</i>

24
00:02:16,867 --> 00:02:18,313
<i>I don’t know who
killed the congressman</i>

25
00:02:18,401 --> 00:02:21,409
<i>as far as I’m
concerned I killed him,</i>

26
00:02:21,505 --> 00:02:22,780
<i>you understand
what I’m saying,</i>

27
00:02:22,873 --> 00:02:24,785
<i>I killed him.</i>

28
00:02:24,874 --> 00:02:26,048
<i>He had no business coming.</i>

29
00:02:26,143 --> 00:02:28,319
<i>I told him not to come.</i>

30
00:02:31,483 --> 00:02:33,896
<i>Die with a degree of dignity</i>

31
00:02:33,985 --> 00:02:35,192
<i>Lay down your
life with dignity</i>

32
00:02:35,286 --> 00:02:38,499
<i>Don’t lay down
with tears and agony.</i>

33
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,500
<i>There’s nothing to death</i>

34
00:02:39,591 --> 00:02:40,365
<i>It’s like Mac said,</i>

35
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:41,939
<i>it’s just stepping
over to another plain.</i>

36
00:02:42,026 --> 00:02:44,200
<i>Don’t be this way,</i>

37
00:02:44,295 --> 00:02:46,642
<i>stop these hysterics.</i>

38
00:02:46,731 --> 00:02:50,774
<i>This is not the way for
people who are socialistic
communist to die.</i>

39
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,842
<i>No way for us to die,</i>

40
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:55,921
<i>we must die
with some dignity.</i>

41
00:02:56,675 --> 00:02:58,716
<i>we must die
with some dignity</i>

42
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,091
<i>We will have no choice,</i>

43
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,994
<i>now we have some choice.</i>

44
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,005
<i>You think their gonna
allow this to be done.</i>

45
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:12,866
<i>Allow us to get by with this</i>

46
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:22,717
<i>[Unintelligible]</i>

47
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:25,411
<i>It has never been
done before you think.</i>

48
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:27,546
<i>Its been done by
every tribe in history.</i>

49
00:03:27,642 --> 00:03:30,820
<i>Every tribe facing annihilation.</i>

50
00:03:30,913 --> 00:03:32,985
<i>In the Amazon their
doing it right now</i>

51
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,891
<i>they refuse to bring any
babies into the world.</i>

52
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:37,158
<i>they save every child
that comes into this world.</i>

53
00:03:37,252 --> 00:03:40,633
<i>Because they don’t want to
live in this kind of world.</i>

54
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,863
<i>So be patient, be patient.</i>

55
00:03:45,126 --> 00:03:47,233
<i>I tell you, I don’t care
how many screams you hear,</i>

56
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,775
<i>I don’t care how
many anguished cries,</i>

57
00:03:48,863 --> 00:03:51,106
<i>Death is a million
times preferable</i>

58
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:53,010
<i>to ten more
days of this life.</i>

59
00:03:53,102 --> 00:03:54,479
<i>If you knew what
was ahead of you,</i>

60
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:55,674
<i>if you knew what
was ahead of you,</i>

61
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,778
<i>you’d be glad to be
stepping over tonight.</i>

62
00:03:58,874 --> 00:04:01,380
Death, death, death is common.

63
00:04:03,012 --> 00:04:03,922
One week from tonight,

64
00:04:04,012 --> 00:04:05,288
join me, Jack Wilson,

65
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:07,591
for a special edition
of Crime Scene.

66
00:04:07,684 --> 00:04:12,194
We’re gonna journey back to
August 9th and 10th 1969.

67
00:04:12,288 --> 00:04:14,236
We’re waiting for our
father to be set free.

68
00:04:14,323 --> 00:04:16,271
Two nights of Murder

69
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:18,171
that sent terror
through Los Angeles

70
00:04:18,262 --> 00:04:20,541
and ultimately, the world.

71
00:04:20,631 --> 00:04:22,270
Judgment Day
is coming people!

72
00:04:22,366 --> 00:04:23,675
Next week on Crime Scene,

73
00:04:23,767 --> 00:04:26,544
we’re going to bring you face
to face with the evil few,

74
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:29,881
that forever poisoned
the Love Generation.

75
00:04:29,973 --> 00:04:32,421
As I talk with the members
of Charlie’s Family.

76
00:04:32,508 --> 00:04:34,114
Hear the jailhouse
confessions of Leslie,

77
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,485
the homecoming queen,

78
00:04:35,578 --> 00:04:36,524
twisted by Charlie

79
00:04:36,613 --> 00:04:38,424
into a knife wielding maniac.

80
00:04:38,514 --> 00:04:40,427
Bobby, the unknown
lynchpin of the family

81
00:04:40,516 --> 00:04:41,860
who committed
the first murder.

82
00:04:41,951 --> 00:04:43,761
Sadie, now a born
again Christian,

83
00:04:43,852 --> 00:04:45,996
once Charlie’s most
outrageous disciple.

84
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:48,231
Patty, a former
Sunday School teacher.

85
00:04:48,325 --> 00:04:50,307
She found Jesus
Christ in Charlie.

86
00:04:50,394 --> 00:04:52,398
And Tex, the former High
School football Captain,

87
00:04:52,496 --> 00:04:54,375
who became Charlie’s
bloodiest butcher.

88
00:04:54,464 --> 00:04:56,241
In Charlie they found a Daddy,

89
00:04:56,334 --> 00:04:59,112
a lover, and a Savior.

90
00:04:59,203 --> 00:05:02,381
And it only took his words
to ignite within them

91
00:05:02,473 --> 00:05:04,455
a rampage of hate and Murder.

92
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,784
The actual killers.

93
00:05:05,877 --> 00:05:07,652
Bringing into focus
for the first time,

94
00:05:07,744 --> 00:05:11,893
their years as members
of Charlie’s Family.

95
00:05:13,453 --> 00:05:18,236
<i>Father cares, you can
tell in his voice he cares.</i>

96
00:05:19,258 --> 00:05:22,367
Oh, we did so many
drugs, and it made sense,

97
00:05:22,461 --> 00:05:24,636
I mean we were sure
that it would work.

98
00:05:25,665 --> 00:05:26,609
How’s your day Jack?

99
00:05:26,698 --> 00:05:27,974
Well, she’s up
for parole you know,

100
00:05:28,067 --> 00:05:29,240
at the end of the year.

101
00:05:29,335 --> 00:05:33,151
My parole hearings
are taped and broadcast.

102
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:36,018
There’s no return
address on this one, hmm.

103
00:05:36,108 --> 00:05:37,418
Let me see.

104
00:05:40,179 --> 00:05:42,059
What the hell is that?

105
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:47,960
Take a look at this,

106
00:05:48,055 --> 00:05:51,062
To the Pig Producer
of the Charlie movie.

107
00:05:51,158 --> 00:05:53,334
How much more,

108
00:05:53,427 --> 00:05:54,337
am I supposed to suffer,

109
00:05:54,428 --> 00:05:57,879
for something that I did
when I was 20 years old.

110
00:05:57,967 --> 00:05:59,274
Hook up the
half inch machine,

111
00:05:59,366 --> 00:06:01,246
I wanna see what
the hell it is.

112
00:06:01,335 --> 00:06:02,371
You got it.

113
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,784
<i>The powers of the serpent,</i>

114
00:06:04,874 --> 00:06:05,908
<i>that live inside all...</i>

115
00:06:06,007 --> 00:06:07,487
Charlie.

116
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:10,116
...that is true on
the line of infinity,

117
00:06:10,212 --> 00:06:12,353
infinity speaks in all life

118
00:06:12,447 --> 00:06:15,260
in the voice of
the lost Child...

119
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:15,954
Kill it.

120
00:06:16,051 --> 00:06:17,326
Hey, you know,
maybe whoever sent it

121
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,364
thinks you’ll use it.

122
00:06:18,453 --> 00:06:20,264
There’s no way in hell
I’m gonna use that thing.

123
00:06:20,356 --> 00:06:22,429
Every time they even make
a mention of the murders,

124
00:06:22,525 --> 00:06:24,006
the Family Murders,

125
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:25,233
it is Charlie,
Charlie, Charlie,

126
00:06:25,328 --> 00:06:28,002
The, the Prince
of Evil, right?

127
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,078
Very seldom have
I ever seen them mention

128
00:06:30,164 --> 00:06:32,306
the kids that
put in the knives

129
00:06:32,401 --> 00:06:33,540
and the bullets
in the victims

130
00:06:33,635 --> 00:06:34,945
That’s what gets me.

131
00:06:35,037 --> 00:06:37,782
Bobby and Gypsy and I

132
00:06:37,872 --> 00:06:39,855
were sort of this...

133
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:42,255
traveling family of our own.

134
00:06:42,345 --> 00:06:44,884
I already had that shit
down, when I met him.

135
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,086
I had my girls, he had his.

136
00:06:56,692 --> 00:06:57,672
This is really getting...

137
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,833
Relax.

138
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,604
Heavy Bobby I’m...

139
00:07:00,697 --> 00:07:01,802
I’m getting really bad vibes.

140
00:07:01,898 --> 00:07:03,174
On acid.

141
00:07:04,601 --> 00:07:05,706
They’re eating my skin!

142
00:07:05,802 --> 00:07:06,874
Help me!

143
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,042
Volcanoes are beautiful!

144
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:09,517
Fire is beautiful!

145
00:07:09,607 --> 00:07:12,419
No, No, No!

146
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:14,422
[Screaming]

147
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:15,718
Let it die!

148
00:07:15,812 --> 00:07:17,191
I’m gonna die!

149
00:07:17,281 --> 00:07:18,227
Let it die.

150
00:07:18,316 --> 00:07:19,555
Let it die.

151
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:20,289
Let it die.

152
00:07:20,385 --> 00:07:21,329
Let it go.

153
00:07:21,418 --> 00:07:22,693
Let it go.

154
00:07:22,787 --> 00:07:23,925
Let it go where it wants...

155
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,263
let it go.

156
00:07:25,357 --> 00:07:26,771
Let it go.

157
00:07:26,859 --> 00:07:27,964
Let it go.

158
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,406
Let it die, Let it die.

159
00:07:30,495 --> 00:07:33,000
Bobby met Charlie.

160
00:07:33,097 --> 00:07:35,341
If anybody was
influenced, it was him.

161
00:07:35,434 --> 00:07:37,211
By me.

162
00:07:37,303 --> 00:07:39,911
And so I met Charlie.

163
00:07:40,005 --> 00:07:42,454
Making music is
how I met Charlie,

164
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,682
when I joined a band
called the Milky Way,

165
00:07:44,777 --> 00:07:45,916
Charlie was in it.

166
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:47,116
He was a fine Musician,

167
00:07:47,213 --> 00:07:48,247
very intense,

168
00:07:48,345 --> 00:07:52,026
very vivid from being
locked up all that time.

169
00:07:52,118 --> 00:07:53,997
And he was a great lyricist.

170
00:07:54,088 --> 00:07:57,300
I was, like a
lot of kids my age,

171
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,464
looking for God.

172
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:02,371
On a quest for God.

173
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:04,067
Stumbling around,

174
00:08:04,163 --> 00:08:06,646
taking drugs.

175
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:09,411
Kind of like a blind
girl in a Forest,

176
00:08:09,504 --> 00:08:12,008
Let me hit that now.

177
00:08:15,275 --> 00:08:19,353
Linda, I want you to come to
the Ranch with me this time.

178
00:08:19,447 --> 00:08:21,487
Just for a few days.

179
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:24,361
Charlie acts from his soul.

180
00:08:24,452 --> 00:08:27,699
Charlie is the man that
we’ve all been waiting for.

181
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:30,067
I was living in this
apartment, with my Dog,

182
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:32,003
and my life was
really routine.

183
00:08:32,093 --> 00:08:34,631
I’d just go to work,
go home, go shopping.

184
00:08:34,728 --> 00:08:37,177
Go to work, go
home, go shopping.

185
00:08:37,264 --> 00:08:39,075
And, it was really a drag.

186
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,841
And then Charlie blows in

187
00:08:40,935 --> 00:08:42,678
and he just
changed everything.

188
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:43,943
And I dropped it all.

189
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:45,075
And I just took off.

190
00:08:45,173 --> 00:08:46,619
He brought out all
these things in me

191
00:08:46,707 --> 00:08:48,450
that I was just
sticking in slots.

192
00:08:48,543 --> 00:08:50,081
When Charlie got out,

193
00:08:50,178 --> 00:08:51,317
he was 33,

194
00:08:51,413 --> 00:08:54,329
he’d been locked
up since he was 13.

195
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:55,623
And he was lonely.

196
00:08:55,718 --> 00:08:56,822
And this was the first time

197
00:08:56,918 --> 00:08:59,026
he had a group of women
that cared about him,

198
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,430
that loved him.

199
00:09:00,522 --> 00:09:02,127
And Charlie loved those girls.

200
00:09:02,224 --> 00:09:04,605
He treated them
with plenty of respect.

201
00:09:04,694 --> 00:09:07,267
Well, I was trying to get
close to Charlie’s girls.

202
00:09:07,363 --> 00:09:09,470
It’s astounding that
Charlie even knew Dennis,

203
00:09:09,565 --> 00:09:11,707
and that we were
all living in this

204
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,614
rock stars mansion
in the first place.

205
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,350
But then Dennis wised up

206
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,943
and kicked us all out.

207
00:09:20,877 --> 00:09:23,793
There’s a lot of
acid at the ranch.

208
00:09:23,881 --> 00:09:25,862
Well of course I went
where the girls went.

209
00:09:25,948 --> 00:09:27,088
I followed them
out to the ranch,

210
00:09:27,184 --> 00:09:29,530
and tried to integrate
myself with Charlie.

211
00:09:32,388 --> 00:09:35,897
I came to you with all
the love in my heart.

212
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:38,032
And you slaughtered me man.

213
00:09:38,128 --> 00:09:39,939
You slaughtered me.

214
00:09:40,031 --> 00:09:41,136
And now I gotta hide,

215
00:09:41,233 --> 00:09:42,406
I gotta hide my soul

216
00:09:42,501 --> 00:09:43,880
so you won’t kill me.

217
00:09:43,969 --> 00:09:45,644
And that’s why the
kids have to hide,

218
00:09:47,772 --> 00:09:48,844
They come out and
their parents say

219
00:09:48,941 --> 00:09:50,251
shut up get back
inside of yourself.

220
00:09:50,343 --> 00:09:51,720
You don’t need
to be so bright,

221
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,314
cause then we’ve got
to judge ourselves.

222
00:09:53,412 --> 00:09:56,590
They hate to
look at themselves.

223
00:09:56,682 --> 00:09:59,597
They hate to look at the
truth in themselves man.

224
00:09:59,685 --> 00:10:01,962
They persecute themselves.

225
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:07,763
Charlie,

226
00:10:07,861 --> 00:10:09,433
this is Tex.

227
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,135
You can have anything I got.

228
00:10:11,231 --> 00:10:12,871
Charlie wasn’t
the leader at all.

229
00:10:12,966 --> 00:10:16,349
He followed us around
and took care of us.

230
00:10:23,609 --> 00:10:25,215
Are you ready to die?

231
00:10:27,713 --> 00:10:29,251
Yes I am.

232
00:10:31,183 --> 00:10:33,429
Then live forever!

233
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,504
Being accepted by
the Family and Charlie

234
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:40,565
was like an answer

235
00:10:40,661 --> 00:10:43,702
an answer to an
unspoken prayer.

236
00:11:18,533 --> 00:11:20,515
Before his
Helter Skelter trip,

237
00:11:20,602 --> 00:11:23,017
everything was beautiful.

238
00:11:23,105 --> 00:11:25,212
All we did was smoke grass,

239
00:11:25,307 --> 00:11:27,050
and drop acid,

240
00:11:27,142 --> 00:11:28,055
and make love,

241
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,591
as much as possible.

242
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,289
We were forced to
examine our souls,

243
00:11:33,382 --> 00:11:35,865
not privately, or secretly,

244
00:11:35,952 --> 00:11:37,661
but before Charlie

245
00:11:37,753 --> 00:11:40,637
and the entire family.

246
00:11:40,725 --> 00:11:43,674
I mean, really, everything
that everything was for,

247
00:11:43,761 --> 00:11:46,676
was for fucking.

248
00:11:46,763 --> 00:11:49,337
That’s what everything
was for, Man.

249
00:11:49,433 --> 00:11:52,144
To unify ourselves with LSD.

250
00:11:52,236 --> 00:11:54,014
I mean, if we
weren’t fucking,

251
00:11:54,105 --> 00:11:55,517
we were leading up to it.

252
00:11:55,606 --> 00:11:56,848
It was heavy.

253
00:11:56,942 --> 00:11:59,423
And if we weren’t leading
up to it, we were fucking.

254
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,681
I didn’t have any
experience with group sex,

255
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:26,048
but I warmed up to it.

256
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:27,744
The girls kept telling me,

257
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,219
that it was my
parents’ hang ups,

258
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:31,188
that I had to
deprogram myself

259
00:12:31,277 --> 00:12:33,053
from their inhibitions.

260
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,791
That’s what Charlie said the
whole universe was about, man

261
00:13:07,881 --> 00:13:10,831
it was all one big fuck.

262
00:13:10,918 --> 00:13:12,228
Everything was in and out,

263
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,233
smoking, and
eating, and drinking.

264
00:13:14,322 --> 00:13:17,363
It was all just one big fuck.

265
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:20,340
We’re not hippies,

266
00:13:20,428 --> 00:13:22,775
we’re slippies.

267
00:13:31,506 --> 00:13:33,043
Well, the ranch
was fairly isolated.

268
00:13:33,141 --> 00:13:34,486
You had to take a back road

269
00:13:34,576 --> 00:13:36,580
from the Santa Susanna Pass
to get there,

270
00:13:36,678 --> 00:13:38,886
and it was owned by this

271
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,590
eighty year old,
blind guy named George.

272
00:13:41,683 --> 00:13:43,063
Well, Charlie never
really believed

273
00:13:43,152 --> 00:13:44,429
that George was
completely blind.

274
00:13:44,521 --> 00:13:45,591
He would have
one of the girls

275
00:13:45,688 --> 00:13:47,260
strip down in front
of him from time to time,

276
00:13:47,357 --> 00:13:50,933
just to see if there
was some sort of reaction.

277
00:13:51,026 --> 00:13:53,942
Charlie was always
trying to cultivate George

278
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:55,204
with the girls, you know,

279
00:13:55,299 --> 00:13:56,608
to help cook and clean,

280
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,977
and make love to him.

281
00:13:59,068 --> 00:14:01,175
And of course we helped
out around the ranch.

282
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,253
Whatever, shoveling manure,

283
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:04,819
grooming the horses,

284
00:14:04,907 --> 00:14:06,720
whatever it took
to keep up a good front,

285
00:14:06,811 --> 00:14:08,759
and make us look
good with George.

286
00:14:08,846 --> 00:14:10,052
And for the most part,

287
00:14:10,147 --> 00:14:12,926
we got along with
the other ranch hands.

288
00:14:13,017 --> 00:14:15,363
Goddamn it move you
hippie bastards!

289
00:14:15,452 --> 00:14:17,024
Except for Shorty.

290
00:14:17,121 --> 00:14:18,795
Freaks!

291
00:14:21,226 --> 00:14:23,103
Excuse me.

292
00:14:25,363 --> 00:14:26,239
Charlie tried,

293
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,073
but Shorty was just
that one ranch hand

294
00:14:28,165 --> 00:14:30,170
that he couldn’t
work his magic on.

295
00:14:30,268 --> 00:14:32,716
Charlie wasn’t
looking for attention.

296
00:14:32,804 --> 00:14:35,480
Which is why he
got so much of it.

297
00:14:52,256 --> 00:14:53,703
You people sure
have strange concepts

298
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,865
of boyfriend, girlfriend.

299
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:07,010
Hi Tex.

300
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,817
Hey Tex.

301
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,722
Sadie.

302
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:18,629
I didn’t know what to make
of Bobby when I met him.

303
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:21,759
He seemed like a spoiled,
super hippy, you know?

304
00:15:21,856 --> 00:15:23,460
Arrogant, always trying to use

305
00:15:23,557 --> 00:15:24,866
a power that he
didn’t really have,

306
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,532
to influence the
rest of the group.

307
00:15:28,263 --> 00:15:30,403
What’s the problem?

308
00:15:30,498 --> 00:15:31,739
Last night, you said

309
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:33,177
we were going
swimming this morning.

310
00:15:33,268 --> 00:15:35,546
I didn’t know you were
going to be in the
barn, fucking Bobby.

311
00:15:35,636 --> 00:15:37,744
Look, I don’t belong
to you Tex, you got that.

312
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,513
I don’t belong to anybody.

313
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:41,816
I can do anything I want,

314
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:43,584
and so can you.

315
00:15:43,678 --> 00:15:45,455
Then why in hell did you bring
me here in the first place?

316
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:47,687
I brought you here
to meet everyone.

317
00:15:47,783 --> 00:15:49,388
I brought you here
to meet Charlie.

318
00:15:49,484 --> 00:15:50,965
Charlie, Charlie,
Charlie, Charlie

319
00:15:51,052 --> 00:15:53,260
Sometimes our
group lovemaking could
be pretty comical,

320
00:15:53,354 --> 00:15:55,166
other times it
was devastating.

321
00:15:55,257 --> 00:15:56,795
But that’s how
we were growing.

322
00:15:56,893 --> 00:15:58,806
We were forming
a bond as a family.

323
00:15:58,895 --> 00:16:01,674
And Charlie was directing
all these energies,

324
00:16:01,764 --> 00:16:03,575
but no one could direct them.

325
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,578
Charlie wasn’t our leader.

326
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:07,410
He didn’t want
us hanging on him,

327
00:16:07,503 --> 00:16:09,245
like our parents wanted
us to hang onto them.

328
00:16:09,337 --> 00:16:10,477
We didn’t need them.

329
00:16:10,572 --> 00:16:12,485
Charlie let us be beautiful.

330
00:16:38,668 --> 00:16:40,616
<i>I’m willing to
die for Charlie,</i>

331
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,480
<i>because he’s me.</i>

332
00:16:44,775 --> 00:16:45,685
Well, we believed

333
00:16:45,775 --> 00:16:49,353
that we were cleansing
ourselves, spiritually.

334
00:16:49,448 --> 00:16:53,399
The goal was to achieve
an inner harmony,

335
00:16:53,484 --> 00:16:54,589
as a group,

336
00:16:54,685 --> 00:16:56,633
as an example to
the rest of the world.

337
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,895
Which we saw as
phony and desperate.

338
00:16:58,988 --> 00:17:01,302
We talk this way
about Charlie,

339
00:17:01,392 --> 00:17:02,531
and people say,

340
00:17:02,626 --> 00:17:04,039
people like you,

341
00:17:04,128 --> 00:17:06,168
say that we’re brainwashed.

342
00:17:06,265 --> 00:17:07,939
But we’ve seen
Charlie do things

343
00:17:08,033 --> 00:17:10,606
that no human being
has done before.

344
00:17:10,702 --> 00:17:12,479
We saw him pick up
a bird in the desert

345
00:17:12,571 --> 00:17:13,813
and breath on it

346
00:17:13,906 --> 00:17:15,285
and bring it back to life.

347
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:16,513
And he said,

348
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:17,986
See I told you
you were perfect.

349
00:17:18,076 --> 00:17:21,586
You must always think
of yourself as perfection.

350
00:17:21,682 --> 00:17:22,989
And I bought it,

351
00:17:23,082 --> 00:17:24,859
and him and the
whole brainwash.

352
00:17:24,951 --> 00:17:27,330
Man, I’ve been trying to
get a buzz off everybody.

353
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:28,695
Nobody has nothing.

354
00:17:28,788 --> 00:17:29,995
Awwhhh.

355
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,035
Clem!

356
00:17:31,123 --> 00:17:33,127
I need to get high.

357
00:17:33,225 --> 00:17:34,638
Pack me a bowl.

358
00:17:34,727 --> 00:17:35,604
Please.

359
00:17:35,694 --> 00:17:37,369
That was the last one.

360
00:17:37,463 --> 00:17:38,841
Oh, you’ve got to be kidding,

361
00:17:38,931 --> 00:17:40,676
there isn’t any more.

362
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:41,712
No!

363
00:17:41,802 --> 00:17:42,645
Goddamn it!

364
00:17:42,737 --> 00:17:43,944
Goddamn it!

365
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:46,020
Goddamn it,
Charlie, that sucks.

366
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,520
Hmmmm... yeah.

367
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:48,713
I know some knuckleheads,

368
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:51,725
we can burn
for at least a lid.

369
00:17:51,812 --> 00:17:54,591
C’mon, let’s go.

370
00:17:54,681 --> 00:17:56,287
Whoa, whoa now,

371
00:17:56,383 --> 00:17:57,522
whoa there,

372
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:58,598
whoa there Sadie!

373
00:17:58,685 --> 00:17:59,596
Hey, hey, hey,

374
00:17:59,686 --> 00:18:00,894
Charlie, Charlie,
let go of my leg.

375
00:18:00,988 --> 00:18:03,028
Whoa whoa hey hey.

376
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,430
Hey, whoa Sadie.

377
00:18:05,526 --> 00:18:06,528
Whoa.

378
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:09,134
Hold on now.

379
00:18:09,231 --> 00:18:11,441
Oh my,

380
00:18:11,534 --> 00:18:14,346
you’ve got some
dirty feet here, Sadie.

381
00:18:14,436 --> 00:18:15,974
Let’s clean them.

382
00:18:16,071 --> 00:18:17,243
There was a love there.

383
00:18:17,338 --> 00:18:18,411
A very strong, a
very true love there.

384
00:18:18,507 --> 00:18:19,417
And if I hadn’t felt it,

385
00:18:19,507 --> 00:18:21,750
I wouldn’t have
followed Charlie.

386
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:37,866
A Joint!

387
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,703
You’ve got, you’ve got pot!

388
00:18:39,795 --> 00:18:41,743
Oh thank God,

389
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,673
Charlie has a joint.

390
00:18:42,765 --> 00:18:44,804
Would you light this.

391
00:18:56,245 --> 00:18:59,093
<i>But until I see all of
you knowing who you are</i>

392
00:18:59,183 --> 00:19:01,097
<i>I’m going to be
very much what I am.</i>

393
00:19:01,186 --> 00:19:04,227
<i>God Almighty God.</i>

394
00:19:04,322 --> 00:19:05,597
Who do you think
sent that tape?

395
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:08,104
Maybe it was a practical
joke by some kids.

396
00:19:08,192 --> 00:19:09,433
You know, Charlie has been

397
00:19:09,527 --> 00:19:11,599
sort of an underground hero
for a lot of these kids.

398
00:19:11,696 --> 00:19:13,233
Wait a minute,
I want to show you something.

399
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,811
I meant to show you
this the other day.

400
00:19:14,899 --> 00:19:17,381
I picked it up at the Dark
Fantasy Comic Book store,

401
00:19:17,467 --> 00:19:19,711
but look at this,

402
00:19:19,803 --> 00:19:22,013
Row after row of
Charlie faces, look at that.

403
00:19:22,306 --> 00:19:23,912
And then I realized,

404
00:19:24,008 --> 00:19:26,685
that it’s been all been
leading to right now.

405
00:19:26,777 --> 00:19:28,123
You know,
it’s like the family,

406
00:19:28,214 --> 00:19:31,391
this is the last time.

407
00:19:31,484 --> 00:19:33,795
Because now, I’ve
got the perfect body,

408
00:19:33,885 --> 00:19:35,331
the one I’ve wanted all along.

409
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,231
The strongest one.

410
00:19:37,322 --> 00:19:40,774
The one that’s gonna make it
through for the last time.

411
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,804
Charlie told us

412
00:19:41,893 --> 00:19:45,276
that Children were the
real leaders of the Family.

413
00:19:45,364 --> 00:19:47,744
They were the ones
who lead the way.

414
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:51,114
Since we waited on
them they set the pace.

415
00:19:51,203 --> 00:19:54,245
Jesus Christ and his
children were just kids.

416
00:19:54,341 --> 00:19:56,345
They were living
free, without guilt,

417
00:19:56,442 --> 00:19:57,617
and without shame.

418
00:19:57,711 --> 00:19:59,020
They were able to
take off their clothes

419
00:19:59,112 --> 00:20:00,889
and lie in the sun
and be one, together.

420
00:20:00,981 --> 00:20:02,791
We took hundreds of
acid trips together,

421
00:20:02,882 --> 00:20:04,659
smoked a lot
of pot together,

422
00:20:04,752 --> 00:20:06,130
because we wanted
to be like Charlie,

423
00:20:06,219 --> 00:20:07,894
because to us,

424
00:20:07,988 --> 00:20:09,731
he was living perfection.

425
00:20:09,823 --> 00:20:11,804
We wanted to mirror him.

426
00:20:27,241 --> 00:20:28,722
We had so much sex.

427
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,224
We had every kind of
sex you can imagine.

428
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,795
We did things you’d
never even think of.

429
00:20:33,882 --> 00:20:37,424
It’s a miracle I’m not
dead from diseases by now.

430
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:39,124
I had no standards,

431
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,758
I would sleep with anybody.

432
00:20:40,854 --> 00:20:42,062
Anybody I wanted to,

433
00:20:42,156 --> 00:20:44,159
or anybody
Charlie wanted me to.

434
00:20:44,257 --> 00:20:46,239
He would always give
me to the meanest biker

435
00:20:46,327 --> 00:20:47,568
or the craziest whoever,

436
00:20:47,661 --> 00:20:49,941
because he said I could
out freak anyone with sex.

437
00:20:50,032 --> 00:20:51,512
Alright, go ahead
and print that.

438
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,675
You know when the trial
started for the Family,

439
00:20:54,769 --> 00:20:56,182
it was really
the milestone

440
00:20:56,271 --> 00:20:57,683
in the death of
the Hippie Movement,

441
00:20:57,772 --> 00:20:59,219
everyone really
thinks Patty Hearst...

442
00:20:59,308 --> 00:21:01,756
<i>Martin Luther King
died with love!</i>

443
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,483
<i>Kennedy died,
talking about something</i>

444
00:21:03,578 --> 00:21:04,820
<i>he couldn’t even understand,</i>

445
00:21:04,914 --> 00:21:06,326
<i>some kind of generalized love</i>

446
00:21:06,415 --> 00:21:07,623
<i>and he never
even backed it up!</i>

447
00:21:07,717 --> 00:21:08,626
<i>He sucked out!</i>

448
00:21:08,717 --> 00:21:09,527
<i>Bullshit!</i>

449
00:21:09,619 --> 00:21:10,724
<i>Love is the only weapon</i>

450
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,764
<i>with which I’ve got to fight?</i>

451
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,494
<i>I’ve got a hell of a
lot of weapons to fight!</i>

452
00:21:13,589 --> 00:21:14,796
<i>I’ve got my clothes,</i>

453
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:15,837
<i>I’ve got compasses,</i>

454
00:21:15,927 --> 00:21:16,905
<i>I got guns,</i>

455
00:21:16,993 --> 00:21:18,098
<i>I got dynamite,</i>

456
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,766
<i>I’ve got a hell
of a lot to fight!</i>

457
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:21,937
<i>I’ll fight, I’ll fight!</i>

458
00:21:22,033 --> 00:21:24,173
[Unintelligible]

459
00:21:24,268 --> 00:21:25,713
<i>I call on you
to stop this now,</i>

460
00:21:25,801 --> 00:21:27,578
<i>if you have any
respect at all.</i>

461
00:21:27,671 --> 00:21:29,585
<i>Are we Black, proud,
socialists, or what are we?</i>

462
00:21:29,973 --> 00:21:30,884
Hey now, that reminds
me of something.

463
00:21:31,209 --> 00:21:32,883
Remember the bookstore
where I got the poster?

464
00:21:32,977 --> 00:21:36,689
OK they had both of Charlies
Albums there, both of them.

465
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,389
On either vinyl or CDs.

466
00:21:39,483 --> 00:21:41,259
Well, he finally
made the record bins.

467
00:21:41,354 --> 00:21:43,335
I think it’s ridiculous.

468
00:21:45,057 --> 00:21:46,504
Yeah, but did you buy them?

469
00:21:46,591 --> 00:21:48,664
So Terry, what was it
like to talk to Charlie?

470
00:21:48,761 --> 00:21:51,141
You could take him
in very small doses.

471
00:21:51,228 --> 00:21:53,302
I mean, he’d throw
ten things at you,

472
00:21:53,398 --> 00:21:54,673
you’d be on three,

473
00:21:54,766 --> 00:21:57,080
he’d be on seven and getting
real physical about it.

474
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:58,308
He’d, he’d bend over,

475
00:21:58,404 --> 00:22:00,113
he’d pick up a
handful of rocks

476
00:22:00,206 --> 00:22:02,050
and he’d toss them
into the air and say

477
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:06,183
See, you can throw it all away
and it’ll come back to you.

478
00:22:08,181 --> 00:22:11,165
We’re flashing with
divine harmony this morning.

479
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:15,134
I just wrote two songs
while the sun was rising.

480
00:22:15,254 --> 00:22:17,635
Very, very, Groovy.

481
00:22:17,724 --> 00:22:19,967
Charlie was not
willing to sell out

482
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:21,096
to the Record producers,

483
00:22:21,195 --> 00:22:23,767
which is the first and
most important requirement

484
00:22:23,862 --> 00:22:26,675
before the industry is
willing to handle an artist.

485
00:22:26,765 --> 00:22:28,178
Do you want
professional sound!

486
00:22:28,267 --> 00:22:29,543
Maybe something you can use?

487
00:22:29,636 --> 00:22:31,173
I suggest you get
in the booth and ...

488
00:22:31,271 --> 00:22:32,979
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

489
00:22:33,072 --> 00:22:34,986
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

490
00:22:35,075 --> 00:22:36,181
What’s the problem here, huh?

491
00:22:36,277 --> 00:22:39,158
Many musicians say they
don’t care about the money,

492
00:22:39,246 --> 00:22:40,783
yet they commit themselves

493
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,452
to be at given places,

494
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:43,824
at certain times,

495
00:22:43,917 --> 00:22:45,626
and to produce what sells.

496
00:22:45,719 --> 00:22:47,962
Whether they
believe it or not.

497
00:22:48,055 --> 00:22:50,037
Charlie didn’t
want that success.

498
00:22:50,124 --> 00:22:52,037
Charlie wanted success
on his own terms,

499
00:22:52,126 --> 00:22:53,902
he didn’t want
to be imprisoned.

500
00:22:53,993 --> 00:22:56,568
I know what’s best
for us man, I know!

501
00:22:56,664 --> 00:22:58,736
Do you know anything about
the acoustics in this studio?

502
00:22:58,832 --> 00:22:59,904
Do you know anything about EQ?

503
00:23:00,001 --> 00:23:01,378
Do you know
anything about mixing?

504
00:23:01,468 --> 00:23:04,181
I know about the Energy
Rays of a free love society,

505
00:23:04,273 --> 00:23:06,379
and I know your cold
heartless technology

506
00:23:06,474 --> 00:23:08,045
hasn’t defined that yet?

507
00:23:08,143 --> 00:23:09,248
Amen, Charlie.

508
00:23:09,344 --> 00:23:10,621
But it’s there,

509
00:23:10,713 --> 00:23:11,713
it’s here,

510
00:23:11,812 --> 00:23:12,952
It’s here, dig?

511
00:23:13,048 --> 00:23:13,925
Like a thought,

512
00:23:14,015 --> 00:23:14,858
it’s a thought,

513
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,294
it’s in a thought,

514
00:23:16,384 --> 00:23:19,198
it’s in a thought
from me to you?

515
00:23:19,288 --> 00:23:21,064
I don’t have to
take this shit!

516
00:23:21,157 --> 00:23:23,469
Jerry, Jerry, Jerry,
Jerry, Jerry c’mon man!

517
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:25,096
Charlie, what
are you doing,

518
00:23:25,193 --> 00:23:27,540
you don’t go slapping people!

519
00:23:27,629 --> 00:23:29,772
Well fuck you and
your bullshit Studio!

520
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:31,974
Hey, is that
what you think Man?

521
00:23:32,069 --> 00:23:33,742
Charlie does things his way.

522
00:23:33,835 --> 00:23:36,446
He don’t conform to the pig
rules of the establishment.

523
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,578
So Terry, you worked in
the studio with Charlie.

524
00:23:38,675 --> 00:23:40,087
Now you’re his Producer.

525
00:23:40,176 --> 00:23:42,249
What, what did you think
of him, as a musician,

526
00:23:42,345 --> 00:23:43,381
as an artist?

527
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,464
Charlie was at the edge.

528
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:49,499
Just the whole sixties scene,

529
00:23:49,587 --> 00:23:50,964
L.A.

530
00:23:51,053 --> 00:23:53,628
Things kind of built
to a critical mass

531
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:55,136
and at one point,
I actually thought,

532
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:56,137
Well, maybe there is something

533
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:58,266
we could do with this, but,

534
00:23:58,363 --> 00:24:00,002
But the music was
really crap, wasn’t it?

535
00:24:00,098 --> 00:24:02,377
Yes, the music was crap.

536
00:24:02,467 --> 00:24:05,212
We’re so formal
over here, on the BBC.

537
00:24:05,304 --> 00:24:12,991
<i>[Charlie singing]
Just come and
say you love me,</i>

538
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:17,393
<i>give up your world,</i>

539
00:24:17,482 --> 00:24:19,464
<i>c’mon, you can be...</i>

540
00:24:19,984 --> 00:24:22,229
I mean things looked
good for Charlie

541
00:24:22,322 --> 00:24:23,893
and everybody was just goofing

542
00:24:23,991 --> 00:24:25,698
with their
head in the clouds.

543
00:24:25,991 --> 00:24:27,062
Well, we gave
up our own birthdays

544
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,606
and renounced our families.

545
00:24:28,695 --> 00:24:31,338
Charlie didn’t allow
any clocks, calendars,

546
00:24:31,431 --> 00:24:34,278
or anything like
that on the ranch.

547
00:24:34,367 --> 00:24:37,580
Dennis and Bobby
were donating food,

548
00:24:37,671 --> 00:24:39,845
cars, women whatever.

549
00:24:39,939 --> 00:24:41,785
It was always submit,

550
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:43,445
give something to Charlie.

551
00:24:43,543 --> 00:24:45,717
Submit everything you had,

552
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,884
submit your ego.

553
00:24:52,185 --> 00:24:55,192
If you do not give me
the deed to the ranch,

554
00:24:55,288 --> 00:24:57,327
I will throw you on
the rail road track!

555
00:24:57,424 --> 00:24:58,871
Ahaaaahhhhaaaaahhhhhh!

556
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:00,030
Help!

557
00:25:00,126 --> 00:25:02,972
Save me, save me!

558
00:25:03,064 --> 00:25:04,407
We’d just drop acid

559
00:25:04,497 --> 00:25:08,245
and share out of this big
pile of clothes and costumes,

560
00:25:08,335 --> 00:25:10,213
and role play the day away.

561
00:25:10,303 --> 00:25:14,085
Changing situations
and characters.

562
00:25:24,585 --> 00:25:26,465
Well, you’re
all going to be clearing
out of here pretty soon,

563
00:25:26,554 --> 00:25:28,058
because George is
getting real tired

564
00:25:28,156 --> 00:25:30,159
of you giving his
ranch a bad name.

565
00:25:33,495 --> 00:25:35,944
I don’t understand
all you little creeps.

566
00:25:36,032 --> 00:25:37,238
Charlie’s not Jesus Christ,

567
00:25:37,332 --> 00:25:38,403
he’s not the Devil.

568
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,479
He’s just a little con man,

569
00:25:39,567 --> 00:25:41,913
he’s spent half his
life in jail goddamn it!

570
00:25:42,003 --> 00:25:44,214
Well once the bikers and
ex-cons moved onto the ranch,

571
00:25:44,308 --> 00:25:45,651
it became a chop shop

572
00:25:45,742 --> 00:25:47,313
for stolen cars,
and dune buggies.

573
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:51,487
And Shorty began taking
down license plate numbers.

574
00:25:51,581 --> 00:25:53,723
Now Shorty was married
to this black go-go dancer,

575
00:25:53,817 --> 00:25:55,196
and that just
burned Charlie up

576
00:25:55,285 --> 00:25:58,701
because it went
totally against his
racial philosophies.

577
00:25:58,788 --> 00:26:01,168
Hey you nigger lover!

578
00:26:01,257 --> 00:26:03,604
I heard your wife
takes it up the ass.

579
00:26:03,692 --> 00:26:05,038
Is that true?

580
00:26:05,129 --> 00:26:08,045
Well loose lips sink ships.

581
00:26:09,934 --> 00:26:12,416
He never said,
in so many words

582
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:14,178
that he was Christ,

583
00:26:14,271 --> 00:26:16,778
but he would imply.

584
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,617
Like, when he’d look at me

585
00:26:18,709 --> 00:26:21,454
and smile and he’d say

586
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:23,824
“Don’t you know who I am?”

587
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,555
I made love to
Charlie last night.

588
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:27,028
Yeah?

589
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:28,724
How was it?

590
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:30,164
Well, it was...

591
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,461
C’mon...

592
00:26:31,555 --> 00:26:32,695
Like what was it like?

593
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:33,793
It was,

594
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:36,170
it was great.

595
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,541
It was kind of scary.

596
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:42,776
He said all these
really nice things to me.

597
00:26:42,869 --> 00:26:45,373
Then when he
started to come...

598
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,113
he got real tense.

599
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:52,887
And then he climaxed
and I came but...

600
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:55,551
I got all...

601
00:26:55,646 --> 00:26:56,354
tense.

602
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,986
It was like,
I couldn’t move my arms

603
00:26:58,084 --> 00:27:01,159
for about a minute at all.

604
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:04,363
I was paralyzed.

605
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:06,939
It was real scary.

606
00:27:07,026 --> 00:27:09,305
That’s because
your ego was dying.

607
00:27:09,395 --> 00:27:10,966
Until you give of
yourself completely,

608
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:14,013
and your ego’s dead,

609
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,017
you can’t be at the now.

610
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:18,584
See what I’m saying?

611
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:21,051
But it happens, you know.

612
00:27:22,842 --> 00:27:23,981
<i>Stop this nonsense.</i>

613
00:27:24,077 --> 00:27:25,216
<i>Don’t carry this on any more.</i>

614
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:28,854
<i>You’re exciting the children.</i>

615
00:27:28,949 --> 00:27:31,192
<i>No, no sorrow that it’s over.</i>

616
00:27:31,286 --> 00:27:33,530
<i>I’m glad it’s over.</i>

617
00:27:34,622 --> 00:27:36,866
<i>Hurry, hurry my
children, hurry.</i>

618
00:27:36,957 --> 00:27:39,703
<i>Hold it down, we’ve got time.</i>

619
00:27:41,895 --> 00:27:43,068
<i>It’s an act of suicide,</i>

620
00:27:43,163 --> 00:27:44,838
<i>commit an act of
revolutionary suicide.</i>

621
00:27:44,932 --> 00:27:49,011
We are now at
the end of reason.

622
00:28:08,324 --> 00:28:12,037
We are motion itself.

623
00:28:12,127 --> 00:28:15,771
We are eternal revolution.

624
00:28:32,816 --> 00:28:34,354
If you get behind the
wheel you’ll kill us both!

625
00:28:34,451 --> 00:28:36,558
Now give me the keys.

626
00:28:36,653 --> 00:28:38,101
Give me the keys,
I’ll be back in the morning.

627
00:28:38,188 --> 00:28:39,827
No.

628
00:28:39,923 --> 00:28:41,494
Give them to me.

629
00:28:41,591 --> 00:28:44,132
No, I’ll take us home.

630
00:28:44,228 --> 00:28:45,367
C’mon have a drink.

631
00:28:45,462 --> 00:28:47,171
I gotta go home.

632
00:28:47,264 --> 00:28:48,677
Thanks for nothing!

633
00:28:57,609 --> 00:28:59,489
I’m sorry.

634
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:08,466
Hey Simi,

635
00:29:08,553 --> 00:29:10,033
what’s the matter?

636
00:29:10,121 --> 00:29:13,197
Nothing.

637
00:29:13,291 --> 00:29:14,464
Do you want some of this?

638
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:15,766
Hunh-uh.

639
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,309
Tex was trying
to please Charlie.

640
00:29:18,397 --> 00:29:20,277
What are you doing?

641
00:29:20,366 --> 00:29:21,813
Come here.

642
00:29:24,069 --> 00:29:24,913
Charlie loved it

643
00:29:25,005 --> 00:29:27,452
when they brought young
girls into the Family.

644
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:29,077
“Young Love”
is what he called it.

645
00:29:29,174 --> 00:29:30,780
Go get me some young love.

646
00:29:30,876 --> 00:29:32,323
Hey, I’ll take you home,

647
00:29:32,411 --> 00:29:33,413
I’ll take you home.

648
00:29:33,512 --> 00:29:34,822
Don’t worry about it.

649
00:29:34,914 --> 00:29:37,693
I’ll get the keys to the
bread truck from Charlie.

650
00:29:40,186 --> 00:29:41,325
Okay enough.

651
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,836
Go get the
keys from Charlie.

652
00:29:43,924 --> 00:29:46,999
Only if you promise

653
00:29:47,093 --> 00:29:50,306
to come to a party with me.

654
00:29:50,397 --> 00:29:51,935
What party?

655
00:29:52,033 --> 00:29:54,312
We throw parties
here all the time.

656
00:29:54,402 --> 00:29:56,178
Everybody wants to meet you.

657
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:59,482
Just come to this one,

658
00:29:59,573 --> 00:30:00,747
okay?

659
00:30:05,147 --> 00:30:06,593
OK.

660
00:30:06,682 --> 00:30:07,922
OK?

661
00:30:16,192 --> 00:30:17,832
Terry was supposed to come in

662
00:30:17,927 --> 00:30:20,307
and record us in our
natural environment.

663
00:30:20,396 --> 00:30:23,608
Charlie thought a record
deal was coming too.

664
00:30:23,698 --> 00:30:24,679
When I showed up,

665
00:30:24,767 --> 00:30:26,476
the ranch was in full swing.

666
00:30:26,569 --> 00:30:28,880
Yeah, we had
high expectations.

667
00:30:28,972 --> 00:30:30,885
Charlie had us clean the
place from top to bottom.

668
00:30:30,973 --> 00:30:32,750
We had zuzus,

669
00:30:32,842 --> 00:30:35,120
hundreds of
joints were rolled.

670
00:30:35,211 --> 00:30:36,246
And the girls,

671
00:30:36,345 --> 00:30:37,826
well they prepared this

672
00:30:37,914 --> 00:30:41,296
outstanding vegetarian feast.

673
00:30:41,384 --> 00:30:42,887
The food that those
stores threw away

674
00:30:42,985 --> 00:30:44,330
was perfectly good,

675
00:30:44,421 --> 00:30:47,962
and we only took the very
best of what was there.

676
00:30:48,057 --> 00:30:50,700
<i>[Charlie singing]
Oh garbage dump,</i>

677
00:30:50,793 --> 00:30:54,299
<i>oh garbage dump,</i>

678
00:30:54,397 --> 00:30:58,042
<i>Why are you called
a garbage dump,</i>

679
00:30:58,134 --> 00:30:59,273
The first day
I came to the ranch,

680
00:30:59,369 --> 00:31:01,180
Charlie sent me
on a garbage run.

681
00:31:01,271 --> 00:31:02,615
He said take
some clean clothes

682
00:31:02,706 --> 00:31:04,051
’cause you’ll get all dirty.

683
00:31:04,142 --> 00:31:05,314
And so I went
down to the market

684
00:31:05,409 --> 00:31:07,083
and I hopped in the can,

685
00:31:07,177 --> 00:31:09,319
and we went through
everything and got all dirty

686
00:31:09,413 --> 00:31:11,759
and we just took the
best of everything.

687
00:31:11,849 --> 00:31:13,420
And we took it and cleaned it

688
00:31:13,516 --> 00:31:14,553
and took the skins off

689
00:31:14,652 --> 00:31:16,531
and cut all the spots out.

690
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,295
Nobody goes hungry here.

691
00:31:18,389 --> 00:31:22,397
<i>You could feed the world
with my garbage dump,</i>

692
00:31:22,493 --> 00:31:25,136
<i>You could feed the world
with my garbage dump,</i>

693
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,436
Charlie I’m sorry man.

694
00:31:26,531 --> 00:31:27,841
I’m sorry I couldn’t make it.

695
00:31:27,933 --> 00:31:30,006
I was uh,

696
00:31:30,101 --> 00:31:33,952
I was tied up in
a meeting, okay.

697
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:35,747
Hey, hey whoa, Charlie,

698
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,877
Charlie, ease up man,

699
00:31:36,976 --> 00:31:38,854
I never promised
you I’d be there.

700
00:31:38,943 --> 00:31:43,056
I said I’d come
if I could, okay.

701
00:31:43,149 --> 00:31:45,152
Yeah.

702
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:47,858
It’s like I tried to
explain to you before, OK.

703
00:31:47,952 --> 00:31:49,093
The record execs

704
00:31:49,189 --> 00:31:51,967
don’t think your stuff
is marketable right now.

705
00:31:52,058 --> 00:31:53,403
What I suggest that we do

706
00:31:53,493 --> 00:31:55,476
is we’ll sit on
it until spring

707
00:31:55,562 --> 00:31:57,772
and who knows you,

708
00:31:57,864 --> 00:32:01,007
by then you could be
the biggest name since,

709
00:32:01,101 --> 00:32:03,049
since Jim Morrison.

710
00:32:06,373 --> 00:32:07,513
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

711
00:32:07,608 --> 00:32:09,749
what do you mean
make up my mind.

712
00:32:09,843 --> 00:32:12,292
This one little
space in time,

713
00:32:12,378 --> 00:32:16,490
where Charlie was there.

714
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:18,258
But he wasn’t there.

715
00:32:18,352 --> 00:32:20,230
Little freak.

716
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,031
Ahhh, ahhh!

717
00:32:23,123 --> 00:32:24,867
Nobody cares about my music.

718
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:26,133
Nobody cares.

719
00:32:26,228 --> 00:32:27,937
Charlie felt betrayed.

720
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,408
His album was
going to make us rich

721
00:32:29,497 --> 00:32:32,310
and it was going to spread
his message to the world.

722
00:32:32,401 --> 00:32:33,904
I mean it didn’t
slow us down,

723
00:32:34,002 --> 00:32:36,612
we all the makings
for a great party.

724
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:39,587
When Simi came
with the family,

725
00:32:39,675 --> 00:32:42,214
she was a virgin
and she was scared.

726
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:44,656
She was scared stiff.

727
00:32:44,746 --> 00:32:46,421
Charlie’s about the
hippest guy I ever met.

728
00:32:46,515 --> 00:32:49,966
He’s going to open doors in
this little brain of yours.

729
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:51,864
So will this.

730
00:32:51,955 --> 00:32:53,799
What’s that?

731
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:56,429
This is LSD.

732
00:32:56,527 --> 00:32:58,474
Here take two.

733
00:32:58,561 --> 00:33:00,007
We’ve already dropped.

734
00:33:00,095 --> 00:33:01,473
The whole Family’s
tripping tonight.

735
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:02,942
I haven’t done any
hard drugs before.

736
00:33:03,031 --> 00:33:04,808
It’s not a hard drug.

737
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,349
Oh, we don’t do
any hard drugs.

738
00:33:08,837 --> 00:33:10,284
It’s just, it’s just acid.

739
00:33:10,373 --> 00:33:13,824
It’s not like it’s heroin
or cocaine or anything.

740
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,081
It’s a groove.

741
00:33:15,176 --> 00:33:16,782
I don’t know how.

742
00:33:16,878 --> 00:33:18,121
What do you mean
you don’t know how.

743
00:33:18,214 --> 00:33:19,694
It’s just like going
to the doctor’s office.

744
00:33:19,783 --> 00:33:21,695
Stick out your
tongue and say Ahhh.

745
00:33:21,785 --> 00:33:23,197
Say, Ahhh.

746
00:33:23,286 --> 00:33:25,235
Well, I guess,

747
00:33:25,322 --> 00:33:28,169
I’ve always wondered,

748
00:33:28,259 --> 00:33:30,467
what it’s like,

749
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,165
you know, to trip.

750
00:33:32,261 --> 00:33:34,403
It’s a groove.

751
00:33:34,498 --> 00:33:35,705
Say Ahhh.

752
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,078
Ahhh...

753
00:33:38,169 --> 00:33:41,882
Say Ahhh.

754
00:33:41,972 --> 00:33:45,253
Ahhhh

755
00:33:45,343 --> 00:33:47,723
On her first big
experience with the family

756
00:33:47,813 --> 00:33:50,056
we all tripped on acid.

757
00:33:50,149 --> 00:33:54,796
And she plum
tripped out on that.

758
00:33:54,886 --> 00:33:56,560
She flipped completely out.

759
00:33:56,655 --> 00:33:58,260
We were all
tripping right along

760
00:33:58,356 --> 00:34:00,236
and we balled her brains out.

761
00:34:00,326 --> 00:34:01,635
It wasn’t rape,

762
00:34:01,727 --> 00:34:03,035
she loved it.

763
00:34:03,128 --> 00:34:06,476
Ahhhh!

764
00:34:14,007 --> 00:34:15,885
It it’s like...

765
00:34:15,975 --> 00:34:17,388
she would start fighting

766
00:34:17,477 --> 00:34:20,485
and she’s fighting and
scared and fighting.

767
00:34:20,581 --> 00:34:24,897
And then she’d calm
down and go “uhhhh”.

768
00:34:24,985 --> 00:34:27,468
And then she’d realize
what was happening to her,

769
00:34:27,555 --> 00:34:32,166
and she’d get all
scared and frightened.

770
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,901
And and Charlie was
sitting in the corner

771
00:34:34,994 --> 00:34:38,503
just directing the operation.

772
00:35:15,137 --> 00:35:19,112
Yes I knew who
Simi Sherry was.

773
00:35:19,208 --> 00:35:21,247
And I know she was raped.

774
00:35:21,343 --> 00:35:22,755
But that was
Bobby and Charlie,

775
00:35:22,844 --> 00:35:24,621
I had nothing to do with that.

776
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,901
No, she just vanished.

777
00:35:34,992 --> 00:35:37,099
Never heard from her again.

778
00:35:37,195 --> 00:35:39,871
I pray for her now
in my nightly prayers.

779
00:35:39,963 --> 00:35:41,740
I just thank God she
got out when she did

780
00:35:41,832 --> 00:35:44,144
or else she might have
ended up in prison too.

781
00:35:44,235 --> 00:35:46,239
<i>You’ve got the nerve
to pray for me.</i>

782
00:35:46,337 --> 00:35:47,443
<i>I’m just as...</i>

783
00:35:47,539 --> 00:35:48,573
<i>you’re just as...</i>

784
00:35:48,671 --> 00:35:51,053
<i>disgusting as I am!</i>

785
00:35:51,141 --> 00:35:52,281
<i>It’s your fault.</i>

786
00:35:52,376 --> 00:35:53,788
<i>I’ve always hated you!</i>

787
00:35:53,878 --> 00:35:56,258
<i>You ruined me!</i>

788
00:35:56,347 --> 00:35:58,830
<i>You ruined my whole life!</i>

789
00:36:03,221 --> 00:36:04,860
<i>All my life!</i>

790
00:36:04,956 --> 00:36:06,836
<i>We struggle.</i>

791
00:36:06,926 --> 00:36:08,965
<i>I mean we struggle
with ourselves you know.</i>

792
00:36:09,061 --> 00:36:11,635
<i>Charlie, I am not going to
give up all my possessions</i>

793
00:36:11,731 --> 00:36:13,770
<i>and come live with you, man.</i>

794
00:36:15,933 --> 00:36:17,379
Suddenly there
was a lot more talk

795
00:36:17,468 --> 00:36:19,678
about fear and its usefulness.

796
00:36:19,772 --> 00:36:20,842
Be like an animal,

797
00:36:20,938 --> 00:36:22,682
be like a coyote.

798
00:36:22,775 --> 00:36:24,381
Use fear to help you exist

799
00:36:24,477 --> 00:36:26,858
and to live in the now.

800
00:36:26,947 --> 00:36:31,491
Well, I think I tried to make
myself believe I was a witch.

801
00:36:31,584 --> 00:36:35,058
I was, Yanna, the good witch.

802
00:36:35,154 --> 00:36:36,998
Charlie just shifted gears.

803
00:36:37,091 --> 00:36:38,535
We ignored the establishment

804
00:36:38,623 --> 00:36:41,164
and we ignored reality
even more than we before.

805
00:36:41,261 --> 00:36:44,303
We just continued on with
the “Magical Mystery Tour”.

806
00:36:44,398 --> 00:36:46,504
Charlie got that
from the Beatles.

807
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:47,978
He called life,

808
00:36:48,067 --> 00:36:49,240
or the flow of life,

809
00:36:49,335 --> 00:36:50,372
“The Magical Mystery Tour”.

810
00:36:50,471 --> 00:36:51,314
We were all part if it,

811
00:36:51,405 --> 00:36:52,578
one mind, one soul,

812
00:36:52,673 --> 00:36:56,386
one body
within it, and with it.

813
00:36:56,477 --> 00:37:00,087
It’s a total
state of paranoia,

814
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,024
it’s,

815
00:37:01,116 --> 00:37:04,258
it’s man when
you’re that aware,

816
00:37:04,352 --> 00:37:07,266
you,

817
00:37:07,353 --> 00:37:09,997
you can feel everything,

818
00:37:10,091 --> 00:37:12,197
you can see
everything that moves,

819
00:37:12,292 --> 00:37:14,775
you can hear everything
that makes a sound,

820
00:37:14,862 --> 00:37:16,400
you could smell every smell.

821
00:37:16,498 --> 00:37:18,981
And when you’re that aware,

822
00:37:19,067 --> 00:37:20,844
you’re at the now.

823
00:37:20,936 --> 00:37:22,245
This is when we
started going out

824
00:37:22,337 --> 00:37:25,014
on “Creepy Crawl” missions.

825
00:37:25,107 --> 00:37:26,883
Well, not breaking
and entering.

826
00:37:26,976 --> 00:37:28,147
Creepy Crawling.

827
00:37:28,242 --> 00:37:29,552
You what?

828
00:37:29,644 --> 00:37:31,456
We Creepy Crawled them.

829
00:37:31,547 --> 00:37:32,719
A few of us would drive

830
00:37:32,813 --> 00:37:34,158
into some wealthy
neighborhood,

831
00:37:34,249 --> 00:37:35,285
and we’d pick a house

832
00:37:35,383 --> 00:37:37,695
and we’d steal right from
under these people’s noses

833
00:37:37,785 --> 00:37:38,959
while they slept.

834
00:37:39,054 --> 00:37:40,797
You had to be super aware.

835
00:37:40,889 --> 00:37:43,269
You had to be aware
of every move you made.

836
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:45,272
Well sometimes we’d drop acid

837
00:37:45,362 --> 00:37:48,004
to heighten our
awareness level.

838
00:37:48,097 --> 00:37:50,545
We Creepy Crawled probably
fifty houses or more,

839
00:37:50,632 --> 00:37:51,772
and we never got caught.

840
00:37:51,868 --> 00:37:53,474
Not once.

841
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:56,650
You stay positive.

842
00:37:56,739 --> 00:37:57,743
You confront your fears.

843
00:37:57,842 --> 00:37:59,049
You say yes to your fears,

844
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:01,124
submit to them
and overcome them.

845
00:38:03,112 --> 00:38:04,184
No sense makes sense.

846
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:05,283
You can’t get caught

847
00:38:05,382 --> 00:38:07,329
if you don’t got
thought in your head.

848
00:38:09,953 --> 00:38:11,663
Sometimes we would steal

849
00:38:11,757 --> 00:38:13,635
from the people’s houses
that we broke into,

850
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:15,467
other times we’d just
move the furniture around

851
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,009
to freak them out when
they woke up in the morning.

852
00:38:18,096 --> 00:38:20,203
I was a master criminal.

853
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:25,108
<i>I can’t believe
you’ve ever been alive.</i>

854
00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:27,241
<i>You don’t deserve to live.</i>

855
00:38:27,337 --> 00:38:29,251
<i>I hate you.</i>

856
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:34,924
<i>You gotta go too!</i>

857
00:38:35,013 --> 00:38:37,496
<i>Take me Elizabeth!</i>

858
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:40,295
<i>My name is Cassandra!</i>

859
00:38:40,387 --> 00:38:42,527
<i>You killed me first!</i>

860
00:38:44,723 --> 00:38:45,931
<i>Charlie developed this game.</i>

861
00:38:46,025 --> 00:38:47,301
<i>We’d take really strong LSD</i>

862
00:38:47,394 --> 00:38:49,433
<i>and sit in a circle
around an empty chair.</i>

863
00:38:49,529 --> 00:38:50,770
<i>Charlie called
it the fear chair.</i>

864
00:38:50,863 --> 00:38:53,276
<i>We’d stare at this chair
while Charlie spoke.</i>

865
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:55,574
<i>He told us to imagine
a rich establishment pig</i>

866
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,079
<i>sitting in the chair.</i>

867
00:38:57,169 --> 00:38:58,912
<i>Now it’s the pig’s
trial he’d say,</i>

868
00:38:59,005 --> 00:39:00,645
<i>and we’d stare at
this imaginary person</i>

869
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,584
<i>and project his fear
right back at him,</i>

870
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:03,914
<i>keeping him immobilized</i>

871
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:06,015
<i>with his own projected fear.</i>

872
00:39:06,113 --> 00:39:07,788
Keep judging
yourselves in Charlie,

873
00:39:07,881 --> 00:39:09,658
but don’t look in the mirror!

874
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,801
<i>I don’t remember exactly when</i>

875
00:39:27,901 --> 00:39:30,144
<i>my mind crossed over from
reality to imagination,</i>

876
00:39:30,237 --> 00:39:31,513
<i>but there was no escaping it.</i>

877
00:39:31,605 --> 00:39:33,918
<i>Things seemed so
doom-laden that summer.</i>

878
00:39:34,008 --> 00:39:35,546
<i>Everything that Charlie
preached seemed like</i>

879
00:39:35,644 --> 00:39:37,319
<i>absolute, divine driven truth.</i>

880
00:39:37,412 --> 00:39:39,952
<i>And, Charlie wasn’t
preaching about death
of the ego anymore.</i>

881
00:39:40,049 --> 00:39:41,426
<i>Now he meant violent death.</i>

882
00:39:41,516 --> 00:39:42,620
<i>Physical death.</i>

883
00:39:42,717 --> 00:39:44,220
<i>And when he said death is
beautiful, he meant it.</i>

884
00:39:44,319 --> 00:39:45,229
<i>Death is beautiful,</i>

885
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:47,802
<i>because it it’s what
people feared the most.</i>

886
00:39:47,889 --> 00:39:49,234
<i>Death is merely
an illusion anyway,</i>

887
00:39:49,324 --> 00:39:52,205
<i>because the infinite
soul can never die.</i>

888
00:39:52,294 --> 00:39:53,432
If you’re not dead,

889
00:39:53,527 --> 00:39:55,476
you will be soon.

890
00:40:14,118 --> 00:40:16,064
Tex was in bad shape.

891
00:40:16,152 --> 00:40:18,601
Charlie had told us all
we had to “cease to exist”,

892
00:40:18,689 --> 00:40:21,035
but Tex never could.

893
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:23,073
Free the mind,

894
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,665
and your ass is
bound to follow.

895
00:40:25,762 --> 00:40:27,608
It’s like he wanted it
both ways you know.

896
00:40:27,698 --> 00:40:29,646
One minute he’d be
bad mouthing Charlie,

897
00:40:29,734 --> 00:40:31,682
and the next minute
he’d be saying shit like

898
00:40:31,769 --> 00:40:34,217
“I am Charlie
and Charlie is me”.

899
00:40:34,305 --> 00:40:36,413
You dig man?

900
00:40:45,617 --> 00:40:49,500
Well, here we are.

901
00:40:49,586 --> 00:40:50,726
Give me the money.

902
00:40:50,822 --> 00:40:52,304
You bring it out,
I’ll pay the dude.

903
00:40:52,391 --> 00:40:53,394
No man, no fronts.

904
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:54,869
The man doesn’t
front for anybody.

905
00:40:54,959 --> 00:40:56,702
He’d be running it
fifty yards from the house

906
00:40:56,795 --> 00:40:57,865
and taking the
money right back.

907
00:40:57,963 --> 00:40:59,067
That’s not a fucking front.

908
00:40:59,163 --> 00:41:01,646
Hey look he’s not gonna
change his rules for me.

909
00:41:01,733 --> 00:41:02,712
Now do you want this or not,

910
00:41:02,801 --> 00:41:03,711
because I don’t care.

911
00:41:03,801 --> 00:41:06,183
We can go right now.

912
00:41:06,271 --> 00:41:08,149
C’mon Lotsapoppa.

913
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,686
Give me the money.

914
00:41:09,774 --> 00:41:11,483
I’ll be back in a flash.

915
00:41:19,486 --> 00:41:23,460
I don’t like this.

916
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:45,815
Lotsapoppa called the
ranch madder than hell,

917
00:41:45,913 --> 00:41:47,826
and Charlie took the call.

918
00:41:49,584 --> 00:41:50,586
Who is it.

919
00:41:50,684 --> 00:41:52,222
It’s Charlie, man.

920
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:54,131
And Charlie, talked to him,

921
00:41:54,222 --> 00:41:55,725
soothed him out, cooled him.

922
00:41:55,823 --> 00:41:57,532
And said don’t come down here,

923
00:41:57,625 --> 00:41:58,570
I’ll come over there

924
00:41:58,659 --> 00:42:00,139
and we’ll settle this thing.

925
00:42:05,032 --> 00:42:06,068
Where you going?

926
00:42:06,166 --> 00:42:07,307
Hey baby, what’s your name?

927
00:42:07,403 --> 00:42:08,644
Get the fuck off of me!

928
00:42:08,737 --> 00:42:10,513
You poor child,
you must be Rosina.

929
00:42:10,605 --> 00:42:11,346
Hey man!

930
00:42:11,439 --> 00:42:12,316
I’m talking to you!

931
00:42:12,407 --> 00:42:14,014
Get over here!

932
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:16,922
Marnie, would you untie
this poor girls hands?

933
00:42:17,012 --> 00:42:18,516
Where you going?

934
00:42:18,614 --> 00:42:20,118
Look motherfucker,
you keep her tied up!

935
00:42:20,216 --> 00:42:21,059
Aw, come on man,

936
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:22,631
this little woman
couldn’t out muscle you.

937
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:24,667
Alright motherfucker, get up!

938
00:42:24,754 --> 00:42:25,858
Get up!

939
00:42:25,954 --> 00:42:28,870
And put that fucking
gun on the table!

940
00:42:28,957 --> 00:42:30,233
Easy!

941
00:42:30,326 --> 00:42:31,329
Easy it’s going.

942
00:42:31,428 --> 00:42:32,601
I said easy!

943
00:42:32,695 --> 00:42:33,833
It’s going easy.

944
00:42:33,929 --> 00:42:37,472
Oh the race war was something
we believed in totally.

945
00:42:37,567 --> 00:42:39,517
It wasn’t the
reason for the murders,

946
00:42:39,603 --> 00:42:42,951
but the belief that there was
going the be a great race war

947
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,649
was something that
hung in the atmosphere

948
00:42:45,742 --> 00:42:46,780
and drove us crazy.

949
00:42:46,878 --> 00:42:50,795
Charlie thought Lotsapoppa
was a Black Panther.

950
00:42:50,881 --> 00:42:53,455
Nothing has changed since
we talked on the phone man.

951
00:42:53,551 --> 00:42:58,470
And if Tex ain’t got every
last cent of that money,

952
00:42:58,555 --> 00:42:59,830
he’s wasted.

953
00:42:59,923 --> 00:43:01,335
I’m gonna kill him.

954
00:43:01,424 --> 00:43:03,566
He’s gonna be wiped
out, you dig it?

955
00:43:03,661 --> 00:43:07,271
That’s not necessary.

956
00:43:07,364 --> 00:43:09,141
Take it as a gift from me.

957
00:43:09,233 --> 00:43:10,042
Gift?

958
00:43:10,135 --> 00:43:10,578
Please.

959
00:43:10,668 --> 00:43:13,618
OK.

960
00:43:19,643 --> 00:43:22,218
And here you are.

961
00:43:22,314 --> 00:43:23,795
Kill me.

962
00:43:23,882 --> 00:43:26,420
My life in exchange
for my brother.

963
00:43:26,517 --> 00:43:27,361
Shoot me.

964
00:43:27,452 --> 00:43:29,456
Amen Charlie.

965
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:34,370
He’s whatever a person
wants to make of him.

966
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:36,669
He’s a mirror, actually,

967
00:43:36,762 --> 00:43:38,766
a reflection of yourself.

968
00:43:38,864 --> 00:43:40,436
Get up.

969
00:43:40,533 --> 00:43:43,517
They’ll both be right
here when you get back.

970
00:43:44,504 --> 00:43:48,978
If we don’t fuck’em to death.

971
00:43:51,711 --> 00:43:53,818
I’ll get Tex for you.

972
00:43:56,749 --> 00:43:58,492
Marnie, I’ll be back soon.

973
00:43:58,584 --> 00:44:01,660
Now you making
sense little man.

974
00:44:01,756 --> 00:44:04,204
What are you gonna do?

975
00:44:04,291 --> 00:44:06,831
Shoot me?

976
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,639
How could I shoot you
with an empty gun?

977
00:44:13,735 --> 00:44:16,216
There are no
bullets in it man.

978
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:21,750
Alright you little fuck.

979
00:44:21,843 --> 00:44:23,449
<i>[Gunshot]</i>

980
00:44:23,545 --> 00:44:24,889
<i>[Scream]</i>

981
00:44:27,349 --> 00:44:28,590
Drop it.

982
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,297
In everything that’s
ever been written,

983
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:37,272
people always overlook how
important that shooting was,

984
00:44:37,361 --> 00:44:40,104
and the impact that
it had on the future.

985
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:43,243
Charlie was terrified

986
00:44:43,332 --> 00:44:44,971
that the Black Panthers
would come down on us

987
00:44:45,066 --> 00:44:47,311
for shooting Lotsapoppa.

988
00:44:47,403 --> 00:44:51,183
That’s a really nice shirt
you’re wearing there.

989
00:44:51,273 --> 00:44:55,193
I like it, I really do.

990
00:44:55,279 --> 00:44:56,726
Could I have it?

991
00:44:56,814 --> 00:44:59,591
I sure would like to have it.

992
00:45:04,386 --> 00:45:08,203
I remember hearing
about the cop who shot the
sixteen year old black kid.

993
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:10,534
We had the race
riots in Watts,

994
00:45:10,626 --> 00:45:12,130
the Black Panthers
in San Francisco,

995
00:45:12,228 --> 00:45:14,608
Martin Luther King had
just been assassinated.

996
00:45:14,697 --> 00:45:17,773
So Charlie’s rap didn’t
seem too far out at all.

997
00:45:17,867 --> 00:45:19,907
It didn’t seem
like it was going to
happen a month from now,

998
00:45:20,004 --> 00:45:21,541
it was happening right now.

999
00:45:21,638 --> 00:45:23,643
Right now.

1000
00:45:31,915 --> 00:45:33,988
I love you.

1001
00:45:34,084 --> 00:45:35,793
I do.

1002
00:45:37,388 --> 00:45:40,166
I think that’s really the
crux of the entire story here.

1003
00:45:40,257 --> 00:45:43,264
That, that was the springboard
for these killings.

1004
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,638
That was the first
domino to tip over,

1005
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:47,838
and it, it lead to the rest.

1006
00:45:50,202 --> 00:45:51,307
It’s gone man.

1007
00:45:51,403 --> 00:45:53,214
Here, pack him
some more in there.

1008
00:45:53,305 --> 00:45:54,752
You fucking guys geeking.

1009
00:45:54,841 --> 00:45:56,150
I ain’t geeking
on nothing, man.

1010
00:45:56,242 --> 00:45:59,283
I mean, I guess not,
this shit fucking sucks.

1011
00:45:59,379 --> 00:46:01,190
I can hardly geek
off of it myself.

1012
00:46:01,281 --> 00:46:03,661
Give me some more.

1013
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:04,922
Hey man you
want one of these?

1014
00:46:05,016 --> 00:46:06,224
It feels good and everything,

1015
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:07,491
but I don’t need
it or anything.

1016
00:46:07,587 --> 00:46:08,589
Well, who does?

1017
00:46:08,688 --> 00:46:10,169
You guys take too big of hits.

1018
00:46:10,257 --> 00:46:11,166
Jesus Christ!

1019
00:46:11,256 --> 00:46:13,000
You fucking whine so much man.

1020
00:46:13,092 --> 00:46:14,471
Why don’t you take your turn?

1021
00:46:14,561 --> 00:46:16,567
Thank you, finally.

1022
00:46:16,665 --> 00:46:18,543
I thought I said
it was fucking empty

1023
00:46:18,632 --> 00:46:20,306
last time you handed it to me.

1024
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,745
He is god!

1025
00:46:21,835 --> 00:46:25,218
Why do you think
they’re sending him
to the gas chamber?

1026
00:46:25,306 --> 00:46:27,914
<i>[Gunshot]</i>

1027
00:46:28,008 --> 00:46:29,751
Now you try.

1028
00:46:36,783 --> 00:46:38,389
Squeeze the trigger.

1029
00:46:38,485 --> 00:46:39,727
You’re pulling.

1030
00:46:39,819 --> 00:46:41,392
Don’t put it in your mouth.

1031
00:46:41,489 --> 00:46:43,164
Squeeze.

1032
00:46:44,193 --> 00:46:46,071
Stop it.

1033
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:57,085
I want to talk to you
and your people Charlie.

1034
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:04,116
Never point a gun at anyone.

1035
00:47:09,384 --> 00:47:11,333
You tell me what
happened to Simi!

1036
00:47:11,421 --> 00:47:12,455
Simi who?

1037
00:47:12,554 --> 00:47:13,761
We opened up her mind.

1038
00:47:13,855 --> 00:47:14,699
She split.

1039
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:15,393
Her parents called.

1040
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:17,165
She hasn’t been
home for five days.

1041
00:47:17,259 --> 00:47:19,799
Goddamn hippies better
be straight with me.

1042
00:47:19,895 --> 00:47:23,243
You better watch what
you’re saying Shorty.

1043
00:47:23,332 --> 00:47:25,440
Or I’m gonna have
your head in a box.

1044
00:47:25,535 --> 00:47:26,948
Snitches?

1045
00:47:27,037 --> 00:47:29,780
Snitches will
be taken care of.

1046
00:47:29,871 --> 00:47:32,185
Chief it’s, it’s 6:00.

1047
00:47:32,275 --> 00:47:33,550
Already?

1048
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:34,588
It sure is.

1049
00:47:34,678 --> 00:47:36,090
You know, not
everybody in the world’s

1050
00:47:36,179 --> 00:47:37,989
a workaholic like
you happen to be.

1051
00:47:38,081 --> 00:47:40,291
And Annette’s
had the day off,

1052
00:47:40,384 --> 00:47:41,796
and I’ll bet ya,

1053
00:47:41,886 --> 00:47:43,025
when I get home,

1054
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,364
I just might have a couple
of steaks on the grill,

1055
00:47:45,457 --> 00:47:47,803
and maybe a cheap
bottle of wine waiting.

1056
00:47:47,892 --> 00:47:48,927
Well, I think I’m
going to hang around

1057
00:47:49,025 --> 00:47:50,472
for about another
hour or so, anyway.

1058
00:47:50,561 --> 00:47:51,563
A lot to do.

1059
00:47:51,662 --> 00:47:54,169
Well, I’ll see you about
nine in the morning, OK?

1060
00:47:54,266 --> 00:47:55,243
Alright, sounds good.

1061
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:56,539
Say hi to Annette for me.

1062
00:47:56,633 --> 00:47:57,271
Sure will.

1063
00:47:57,369 --> 00:47:58,073
See you tomorrow.

1064
00:47:58,169 --> 00:47:59,706
Goodnight.

1071
00:48:30,837 --> 00:48:33,343
Charlie’s the only
complete man I’ve ever met.

1072
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,649
He won’t let any woman
talk him into anything.

1073
00:48:35,743 --> 00:48:39,387
He won’t take any
back talk or whining.

00:48:39,479 --> 00:48:41,688
Ahhhh!

00:48:41,782 --> 00:48:43,090
Tex!

1076
00:48:45,018 --> 00:48:47,194
Oh, we’ve missed you,
Charlie’s missed you

1077
00:48:47,287 --> 00:48:48,459
Where the hell have you been?

1078
00:48:48,556 --> 00:48:50,230
Are you staying?

1079
00:48:50,325 --> 00:48:51,895
Yeah.

1080
00:48:51,992 --> 00:48:53,266
Yeah.

1081
00:48:55,664 --> 00:48:56,700
What’s that?

1082
00:48:56,798 --> 00:49:00,613
You’ve got a lot
of catching up to do.

1083
00:49:02,201 --> 00:49:03,876
He never really gave orders.

1084
00:49:03,971 --> 00:49:04,848
He was so evil

1085
00:49:04,939 --> 00:49:07,753
he would just scare us to
death with his preachings.

1086
00:49:07,843 --> 00:49:09,117
Every night he’d tell us

1087
00:49:09,209 --> 00:49:10,450
that there was going
to be a race war,

1088
00:49:10,544 --> 00:49:11,889
and that whitey and the blacks

1089
00:49:11,979 --> 00:49:12,958
were going to go to war,

1090
00:49:13,046 --> 00:49:14,288
and it was going
to he the worst war

1091
00:49:14,382 --> 00:49:15,726
the world had ever seen.

1092
00:49:15,815 --> 00:49:17,057
And he said that
we had to be ready

1093
00:49:17,151 --> 00:49:18,393
to save the children

1094
00:49:18,486 --> 00:49:19,898
and rescue the
homeless babies,

1095
00:49:19,987 --> 00:49:22,231
and carry them off into
the desert to safety.

1096
00:49:22,323 --> 00:49:24,967
And he said we had to start
collecting dune buggies,

1097
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:26,540
and guns and supplies

1098
00:49:26,627 --> 00:49:28,632
and all these other
things to help us survive.

1099
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:32,204
And then he would just calmly
pull out this buck knife

1100
00:49:32,301 --> 00:49:33,839
and he said I don’t know
about the rest of you,

1101
00:49:33,936 --> 00:49:35,780
but I’m going to
start carrying a knife.

1102
00:49:35,871 --> 00:49:39,549
There’s no good or no
evil, there just is.

1103
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,749
Did you have any idea

1104
00:49:41,843 --> 00:49:44,052
you were going to be
one of the apostles?

1105
00:49:44,145 --> 00:49:45,524
Hmm?

1106
00:49:45,614 --> 00:49:46,754
An Apostle?

1107
00:49:46,849 --> 00:49:49,059
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

1108
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:53,468
C’mon Tex, why else would
you and I be here right now?

1109
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:56,039
Why would any of us be here?

1110
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:59,042
Oh.

1111
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:00,838
Charlie.

1112
00:50:00,931 --> 00:50:02,970
That’s right.

1113
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:05,913
C’mon Patty.

1114
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:06,639
Tex...

1115
00:50:06,736 --> 00:50:08,879
Well, you know
who he is don’t you?

1116
00:50:08,973 --> 00:50:11,215
It’s all true Tex!

1117
00:50:11,307 --> 00:50:13,016
I know about these things,

1118
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:14,750
I know it’s all true!

1119
00:50:14,846 --> 00:50:17,294
I used to teach Sunday School.

1120
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:21,994
I was studying to be a
nun before I met Charlie.

1121
00:50:22,086 --> 00:50:23,259
The Gospel
according to Charlie

1122
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:24,960
is all you girls know.

1123
00:50:25,056 --> 00:50:27,060
You’re absolutely
fucking right Tex,

1124
00:50:27,158 --> 00:50:29,505
because Charlie is Christ

1125
00:50:29,594 --> 00:50:31,405
and Christ is love,

1126
00:50:31,496 --> 00:50:32,805
and Charlie is love.

1127
00:50:32,898 --> 00:50:36,074
That makes Charlie
and Christ one.

1128
00:50:36,167 --> 00:50:38,912
The Beatles laid it all
out on the White Album.

1129
00:50:39,004 --> 00:50:41,112
The four angels
with the faces of men

1130
00:50:41,207 --> 00:50:42,585
and the hair of women,

1131
00:50:42,675 --> 00:50:44,678
that’s the Beatles.

1132
00:50:44,777 --> 00:50:46,918
And the Breastplates of Fire.

1133
00:50:47,013 --> 00:50:50,930
That’s their
electric guitars, see?

1134
00:50:51,016 --> 00:50:54,001
You know who the fifth
angel is, don’t you?

1135
00:50:54,087 --> 00:50:56,765
Don’t you?

1136
00:50:56,857 --> 00:50:59,965
I’m just so sick of this
mind-fucking bullshit.

1137
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:01,267
You better be ready.

1138
00:51:01,362 --> 00:51:03,639
Two weeks everybody’s
carrying a knife,

1139
00:51:03,729 --> 00:51:04,936
and Charlie’s teaching us

1140
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:07,638
the best way to slit
a person’s throat.

1141
00:51:09,636 --> 00:51:11,675
Just like there’s no
past and no future.

1142
00:51:11,771 --> 00:51:13,183
Just now,

1143
00:51:13,272 --> 00:51:15,117
that’s all
that’s important.

1144
00:51:15,207 --> 00:51:16,655
The time is gonna come

1145
00:51:16,742 --> 00:51:19,886
when all men will judge
themselves before God.

1146
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,585
It’ll be the worst hell,

1147
00:51:21,681 --> 00:51:22,991
the worst hell on earth.

1148
00:51:23,082 --> 00:51:25,622
It’ll make Nazi Germany
look like a picnic.

1149
00:51:25,719 --> 00:51:27,826
And you gotta be ready
for that right now,

1150
00:51:27,921 --> 00:51:30,734
right here right
now just like that.

1151
00:51:30,824 --> 00:51:34,606
And that’s where
we’re at all the time.

1152
00:51:34,896 --> 00:51:36,434
Charlie set up
Helter Skelter patrols.

1153
00:51:36,531 --> 00:51:38,069
We kept 24 hour a day lookouts

1154
00:51:38,165 --> 00:51:41,081
posted with shotguns
around the ranch.

1155
00:51:41,167 --> 00:51:42,672
It was perfect
timing for Charlie,

1156
00:51:42,769 --> 00:51:44,946
because the Family was
starting to drift apart.

1157
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,181
But now we were being pushed

1158
00:51:47,274 --> 00:51:50,657
to the last safe corner
of the earth, the desert.

1159
00:51:50,745 --> 00:51:52,659
Now, the District
Attorney made up the lie

1160
00:51:52,748 --> 00:51:55,857
that Charlie was trying to
start this black, white war

1161
00:51:55,951 --> 00:51:57,489
to bring on Armageddon.

1162
00:51:57,586 --> 00:51:59,431
Charlie didn’t start the war.

1163
00:51:59,521 --> 00:52:01,161
As far as we
were all concerned

1164
00:52:01,256 --> 00:52:03,239
it was already coming down.

1165
00:52:03,326 --> 00:52:05,239
Helter Skelter is
the name of a song

1166
00:52:05,328 --> 00:52:09,405
performed by
The Beatles, period.

1167
00:52:09,498 --> 00:52:11,480
Helter Skelter
was very real to us.

1168
00:52:11,567 --> 00:52:13,207
For all we knew
it was happening.

1169
00:52:13,301 --> 00:52:14,715
All the events
were taking place.

1170
00:52:14,803 --> 00:52:17,447
And we thought we really
had to get to the desert.

1171
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:20,318
That the desert was the only
way that we could be saved.

1172
00:52:20,409 --> 00:52:22,186
We’d still make
music and orgy,

1173
00:52:22,279 --> 00:52:24,956
but now it had this
dark underbelly to it.

1174
00:52:25,049 --> 00:52:27,554
Everything was Biblical
and Apocalyptic.

1175
00:52:27,651 --> 00:52:31,365
We will kill anyone who
gets in our way, period!

1176
00:52:31,655 --> 00:52:34,367
What are we gonna do Charlie?

1177
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:38,502
Creepy Crawl
some pig’s house?

1178
00:52:38,596 --> 00:52:41,045
Of course I loved Charlie.

1179
00:52:41,132 --> 00:52:45,050
I felt like he was
the Messiah come again.

1180
00:52:45,136 --> 00:52:48,585
You know the Second
Coming of Christ.

1181
00:52:59,651 --> 00:53:00,960
King of the Jews.

1182
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:28,518
Drink from this.

1183
00:53:28,615 --> 00:53:29,720
For this is my blood,

1184
00:53:29,815 --> 00:53:31,353
the blood of the new covenant,

1185
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:35,028
which is shed for many.

1186
00:53:35,122 --> 00:53:38,664
And the flames blew up
like the devil’s breath!

1187
00:54:00,014 --> 00:54:02,052
Shed for many.

1188
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,137
I’m the Devil!

1189
00:54:15,097 --> 00:54:16,441
I’m the Devil!

1190
00:54:19,034 --> 00:54:20,014
The Devil!

1191
00:54:20,103 --> 00:54:22,015
Charlie, I’m the Devil!

1192
00:54:23,438 --> 00:54:24,818
Rise!

1193
00:54:24,907 --> 00:54:26,252
Rise!

1194
00:54:26,342 --> 00:54:27,617
Rise!

1195
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:29,055
Rise!

1196
00:54:29,145 --> 00:54:30,557
Rise!

1197
00:54:30,646 --> 00:54:32,127
Rise!

1198
00:54:32,215 --> 00:54:33,194
Rise!

1199
00:54:33,283 --> 00:54:35,025
Rise!

1200
00:55:03,448 --> 00:55:05,156
<i>Neither repented
they of their murders,</i>

1201
00:55:05,249 --> 00:55:06,320
<i>nor of their sorceries,</i>

1202
00:55:06,417 --> 00:55:07,897
<i>nor of their fornications,</i>

1203
00:55:07,984 --> 00:55:09,430
<i>nor of their thefts.</i>

1204
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,829
<i>And they had a King over them,</i>

1205
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,564
<i>which is the Angel of
the Bottomless Pit.</i>

1206
00:55:13,658 --> 00:55:16,335
<i>Whose name in the
Hebrew tongue is Abaddon,</i>

1207
00:55:16,428 --> 00:55:17,737
<i>but in the Latin tongue,</i>

1208
00:55:17,829 --> 00:55:22,145
<i>hath his name is Exterminans.</i>

1209
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:28,850
And I started to
space it real bad.

1210
00:55:28,941 --> 00:55:30,181
And I fucking looked over

1211
00:55:30,276 --> 00:55:32,279
and Charlie looked
like the Devil, man.

1212
00:55:32,377 --> 00:55:34,552
I said, “Man, I
think we’re in hell”.

1213
00:55:34,645 --> 00:55:36,821
And he said,
“Yeah, ain’t it groovy”

1214
00:56:20,661 --> 00:56:22,336
I was getting some
real weird pictures.

1215
00:56:22,430 --> 00:56:24,844
So I get out while
the getting was good.

1216
00:56:24,933 --> 00:56:26,276
What do you mean
leaving, you can’t?

1217
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:27,905
Will you go with me?

1218
00:56:28,003 --> 00:56:28,845
Why?

1219
00:56:28,936 --> 00:56:30,418
You can’t leave.

1220
00:56:30,506 --> 00:56:32,317
I overheard Tex and Sadie,

1221
00:56:32,408 --> 00:56:34,721
and they’re watching you.

1222
00:56:34,811 --> 00:56:36,484
I gotta get out of here.

1223
00:56:36,578 --> 00:56:37,387
Why?

1224
00:56:37,479 --> 00:56:38,755
What is going on?

1225
00:56:38,848 --> 00:56:40,293
I’m sacred.

1226
00:56:40,382 --> 00:56:42,990
What’s wrong?

1227
00:56:43,085 --> 00:56:45,066
Charlie asked me

1228
00:56:45,153 --> 00:56:47,158
if I would kill somebody.

1229
00:56:47,256 --> 00:56:51,640
What’s in the bag Sunshine?

1230
00:56:51,726 --> 00:56:53,503
Hi Sadie.

1231
00:57:01,739 --> 00:57:04,050
You can’t kill.

1232
00:57:04,139 --> 00:57:06,646
Kill.

1233
00:57:09,713 --> 00:57:11,819
Bunch of people with their
backs up against the wall,

1234
00:57:11,914 --> 00:57:13,360
willing almost to...

1235
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:14,224
Kill someone?

1236
00:57:14,317 --> 00:57:15,091
Oh, yeah.

1237
00:57:15,184 --> 00:57:15,926
In a split second.

1238
00:57:16,019 --> 00:57:18,627
Kill crazy and
throw your life away.

1239
00:57:31,802 --> 00:57:33,682
Any traces of my own
will or personality

1240
00:57:33,772 --> 00:57:35,378
had totally
dissolved by this time.

1241
00:57:35,474 --> 00:57:37,387
I was just as
extension of Charlie,

1242
00:57:37,476 --> 00:57:40,687
and I took my role of
enforcer very seriously.

1243
00:57:40,778 --> 00:57:41,724
Where were you going?

1244
00:57:41,813 --> 00:57:42,553
What’s the big deal?

1245
00:57:42,646 --> 00:57:44,321
I just wanted to be
by myself for a while.

1246
00:57:44,415 --> 00:57:45,292
She was wearing these.

1247
00:57:45,383 --> 00:57:46,728
I like to see in focus.

1248
00:57:46,817 --> 00:57:48,389
You were running away.

1249
00:57:48,486 --> 00:57:50,058
I wasn’t running away!

1250
00:57:50,154 --> 00:57:51,533
Look what’s the big
deal all of a sudden?

1251
00:57:51,623 --> 00:57:52,764
You guys are
acting like the ranch

1252
00:57:52,859 --> 00:57:54,167
has become a military camp.

1253
00:57:54,259 --> 00:57:55,068
Take them off.

1254
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:56,903
Charlie told you
not to wear them.

1255
00:57:56,996 --> 00:57:57,737
Stop it!

1256
00:57:57,830 --> 00:57:59,903
I want to wear them!

1257
00:58:01,867 --> 00:58:03,779
Don’t you ever leave the
ranch without telling anyone!

1258
00:58:03,868 --> 00:58:05,578
Going out to Death
Valley, you know,

1259
00:58:05,671 --> 00:58:08,517
it made a lot of sense.

1260
00:58:08,606 --> 00:58:11,250
Somewhere that we could
raise our children,

1261
00:58:11,343 --> 00:58:13,450
and let them teach us

1262
00:58:13,546 --> 00:58:16,155
some of the things
that we need to learn.

1263
00:58:16,249 --> 00:58:18,529
In a place that’s
closer to the land,

1264
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,123
and the stars,

1265
00:58:20,221 --> 00:58:22,031
and the spirit of life.

1266
00:58:22,122 --> 00:58:25,164
Do it again and
I’ll kill you!

1267
00:58:25,259 --> 00:58:26,331
We’ll hang you in a tree,

1268
00:58:26,428 --> 00:58:28,272
and we’ll cut
your tongue out!

1269
00:58:28,362 --> 00:58:32,872
You got no idea how desperate
things were out there.

1270
00:58:32,966 --> 00:58:34,310
I’m not talking frustration,

1271
00:58:34,401 --> 00:58:36,007
I’m talking lunacy.

1272

[Chanting]

1273
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:56,700
Charlie thought that Gary had
inherited a lot of money.

1274
00:58:56,792 --> 00:59:00,039
So Charlie asked
Gary to join the Family

1275
00:59:00,129 --> 00:59:01,871
and come with
us to the desert.

1276
00:59:01,964 --> 00:59:02,943
Gary said no,

1277
00:59:03,031 --> 00:59:07,142
so Charlie told Bobby and
I to try to convince him.

1278
00:59:07,235 --> 00:59:10,242
I’ve given you, given you
all help in times of need.

1279
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:12,342
But I’m not following
Charlie into the desert.

1280
00:59:12,441 --> 00:59:14,045
I have my life, and it’s here.

1281
00:59:14,142 --> 00:59:15,816
We’re not asking
you to change Gary.

1282
00:59:15,911 --> 00:59:17,723
You can bring your, your...

1283
00:59:17,814 --> 00:59:18,519
Gohanza.

1284
00:59:18,613 --> 00:59:19,822
Your Gohanza out there.

1285
00:59:19,916 --> 00:59:21,988
You can have everything
there that you have here.

1286
00:59:22,083 --> 00:59:23,358
We love you Gary.

1287
00:59:23,451 --> 00:59:24,796
We need you, man.

1288
00:59:24,887 --> 00:59:25,524
I need you.

1289
00:59:25,621 --> 00:59:27,398
No, alright?

1290
00:59:27,490 --> 00:59:28,299
You’re still my brother,

1291
00:59:28,391 --> 00:59:29,392
and my sister,

1292
00:59:29,491 --> 00:59:30,995
but I must be true to myself.

1293
00:59:31,093 --> 00:59:31,902
Last chance.

1294
00:59:31,995 --> 00:59:33,373
It’s gonna take a lot of
money for a move of this kind.

1295
00:59:33,462 --> 00:59:34,943
I’ll give you
forty dollars, okay.

1296
00:59:35,031 --> 00:59:36,203
How about twenty grand?

1297
00:59:36,298 --> 00:59:37,109
How about it?

1298
00:59:37,201 --> 00:59:38,443
We need that money Gary.

1299
00:59:38,535 --> 00:59:39,606
The whole thing with Gary

1300
00:59:39,703 --> 00:59:40,945
was that he had burned me

1301
00:59:41,038 --> 00:59:43,041
on a thousand
tabs of mescaline.

1302
00:59:43,139 --> 00:59:45,646
I went there simply
to get my money back.

1303
00:59:45,743 --> 00:59:46,984
I think you should
leave right now.

1304
00:59:47,077 --> 00:59:48,113
Bullshit.

1305
00:59:48,212 --> 00:59:49,316
We ain’t kidding Gary.

1306
00:59:49,411 --> 00:59:51,655
Bobby, what are you doing?

1307
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:52,990
Look, I don’t know
what Charlie told you,

1308
00:59:53,083 --> 00:59:54,290
but I don’t have
twenty thousand dollars,

1309
00:59:54,385 --> 00:59:55,523
and I’m not paying.

1310
00:59:55,618 --> 00:59:56,428
You’re bullshitting me!

1311
00:59:56,521 --> 00:59:58,024
Stop it Bobby.

1312
00:59:58,122 --> 01:00:00,365
Get out of my house!

1313
01:00:00,458 --> 01:00:01,233
Watch him.

1314
01:00:01,326 --> 01:00:02,168
I’m gonna find it.

1315
01:00:02,259 --> 01:00:03,137
He’s not gonna find anything.

1316
01:00:03,228 --> 01:00:04,300
Shut up!

1317
01:00:17,844 --> 01:00:19,654
We trashed this place,
we turned it upside down,

1318
01:00:19,744 --> 01:00:21,987
I don’t know what else...

1319
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:24,563
I don’t know if he has it.

1320
01:00:24,649 --> 01:00:25,560
Alright, fine.

1321
01:00:25,651 --> 01:00:27,326
OK.

1322
01:00:27,419 --> 01:00:28,421
Alright, fine.

1323
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:30,901
We’ll be here.

1324
01:00:30,990 --> 01:00:33,338
You’re making terrible causes.

1325
01:00:33,427 --> 01:00:35,101
Causes you’ll answer
for in later life.

1326
01:00:35,195 --> 01:00:36,267
Charlie’s pissed at you man.

1327
01:00:36,364 --> 01:00:38,073
You can’t change the
causes you’ve made,

1328
01:00:38,165 --> 01:00:40,944
but you can counter
them with positive ones.

1329
01:00:41,034 --> 01:00:42,173
What the hell.

1330
01:00:42,269 --> 01:00:44,218
You too Sadie.

1331
01:00:44,304 --> 01:00:45,545
Just go.

1332
01:00:45,639 --> 01:00:48,418
Tell that to Charlie.

for what was going on.</i>

1339

over and over again</i>

1340

have any money, and,</i>

1341

Let him in.

know what to do.

you’re doing by this.

about that money Jack!

Don’t man.

Don’t come back
without the money, man.

1359

During my trial

1360
01:02:49,769 --> 01:02:53,185
the prosecution wanted to
involve Charlie in my case.

1361
01:02:53,272 --> 01:02:56,884
Which is difficult because he
was never there at any time.

1362
01:02:56,977 --> 01:02:59,549
I cut Gary, when
we were fighting.

1363
01:02:59,645 --> 01:03:00,625
And it wasn’t his ear,

1364
01:03:00,714 --> 01:03:03,698
it was more like this
little slash on his cheek.

1365
01:03:03,783 --> 01:03:05,128
Take this.

1366
01:03:05,219 --> 01:03:07,201

01:03:19,433 --> 01:03:22,144
I think at that point Charlie
knew what was going on,

01:03:22,236 --> 01:03:23,408
but we didn’t.

ready for what was happening.

someone to fix his ear.

have bandages...

that fucking money is, Gary!

I’m gonna rip
this place apart,

here much longer.

what do you want to do?

01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:54,414
Well call the

Charlie always has
an answer, right?

the right answer,

01:07:27,292 --> 01:07:30,504
I had a lot of anxiety
over getting busted.

1431
01:07:30,596 --> 01:07:36,176
I split the ranch on the
pretence of ditching the car.

1432
01:07:36,267 --> 01:07:40,048
Some cops woke me up
one morning on the
side of the road.

1433
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:41,414
Called in the car,

1434
01:07:41,507 --> 01:07:43,421
found the knife in the car,

1435
01:07:43,509 --> 01:07:45,650
hauled my ass in,

1436
01:07:45,745 --> 01:07:50,255
effectively negating all of
my creative efforts forever.

1437
01:08:03,595 --> 01:08:05,305
This is all your
fault Charlie!

1438
01:08:05,398 --> 01:08:06,401
Shut up!

1439
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:07,606
You shut up!

1440
01:08:07,702 --> 01:08:08,840
As long as any
of us are in jail,

1441
01:08:08,936 --> 01:08:10,245
we’re all in jail, you know.

1442
01:08:10,337 --> 01:08:11,977
I’m walking around out here,

1443
01:08:12,072 --> 01:08:14,111
but I’m in jail with
every single young person

1444
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:16,349
that should be free, you know.

1445
01:08:16,444 --> 01:08:18,221
I’m in the Hall of
Justice with Charlie,

1446
01:08:18,312 --> 01:08:21,421
and I’m on death
row with Bobby.

1447
01:08:21,516 --> 01:08:22,551
Wow, they got Bobby.

1448
01:08:22,650 --> 01:08:24,564
It was for the
love of brother.

1449
01:08:28,457 --> 01:08:30,496
This had nothing to do
with the race war, no,

1450
01:08:30,592 --> 01:08:32,370
no blacks against
whites, no Armageddon,

1451
01:08:32,461 --> 01:08:33,964
it no White Album,

1452
01:08:34,062 --> 01:08:35,203
no Helter Skelter,

1453
01:08:35,298 --> 01:08:36,779
that wasn’t what it was about.

1454
01:08:36,867 --> 01:08:38,347
Then he went on about
how we were a family

1455
01:08:38,434 --> 01:08:41,179
and we weren’t going
to let one of our
brothers rot in jail.

1456
01:08:41,271 --> 01:08:42,808
Girls loved Bobby
enough to do this,

1457
01:08:42,905 --> 01:08:44,284
as they took these
people’s lives,

1458
01:08:44,373 --> 01:08:46,183
they were willing to
give their own lives.

1459
01:08:46,274 --> 01:08:48,723
And that’s what they’re doing
right now on death row.

1460
01:08:48,811 --> 01:08:50,691
It’s for the love of brother.

1461
01:08:50,779 --> 01:08:53,626
We knew that Charlie was
willing to give his life.

1462
01:08:53,916 --> 01:08:55,795
He brought up the
subject of Lotsapoppa,

1463
01:08:55,885 --> 01:08:57,389
and how that
had been my mess,

1464
01:08:57,487 --> 01:09:00,095
and how he had to
clean that one up.

1465
01:09:00,190 --> 01:09:01,762
That he had taken a life,

1466
01:09:01,858 --> 01:09:04,398
and now it was my turn
to repay that debt.

1467
01:09:04,495 --> 01:09:07,809
Well the girls, decided
if they found, the police,

1468
01:09:07,898 --> 01:09:09,243
if they found more bodies,

1469
01:09:09,333 --> 01:09:11,007
with, with writing
on the wall in blood,

1470
01:09:11,101 --> 01:09:12,810
that, that they’d assume
the killer was on the loose,

1471
01:09:12,903 --> 01:09:14,282
and they’d let Bobby go.

1472
01:09:14,371 --> 01:09:15,818
He told me that
the girls had a plan,

1473
01:09:15,907 --> 01:09:17,442
and that they needed me
to help them carry it out.

1474
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:19,648
He said, go to
Terry’s old place,

1475
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:21,053
take all the money you find,

1476
01:09:21,145 --> 01:09:22,820
and kill anyone there.

1477
01:09:22,913 --> 01:09:25,590
I was getting into
my Creepy Crawl clothes

1478
01:09:25,682 --> 01:09:28,598
and me and Tex were
sneaking some speed,

1479
01:09:28,686 --> 01:09:30,496
and getting ready to go.

1480
01:09:33,058 --> 01:09:34,868
Linda, get up.

1481
01:09:38,163 --> 01:09:41,304
Wake up!

1482
01:09:41,397 --> 01:09:42,969
Now, you’re gonna need
your drivers license,

1483
01:09:43,066 --> 01:09:44,241
a change of clothes.

1484
01:09:44,335 --> 01:09:45,838
Put on dark clothes
like I’m wearing.

1485
01:09:45,936 --> 01:09:47,282
And bring your knife.

1486
01:09:47,371 --> 01:09:48,352
Linda.

1487
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:50,512
I want you to go
wherever Tex tells you.

1488
01:09:50,608 --> 01:09:54,082
Everybody, do
whatever Tex says.

1489
01:09:54,179 --> 01:09:55,854
He knows what to do,

1490
01:09:55,948 --> 01:09:57,953
listen to him.

1491
01:09:58,051 --> 01:10:01,263
And leave a sign.

1492
01:10:01,354 --> 01:10:03,266
You girls know what I mean.

1493
01:10:03,355 --> 01:10:05,098
Something witchy.

1494
01:10:05,190 --> 01:10:06,466
So I led them there.

1495
01:10:06,559 --> 01:10:08,302
I had been there
three times before.

1496
01:10:08,394 --> 01:10:10,137
I would step
out of this casket

1497
01:10:10,229 --> 01:10:12,712
like some freaky
vampire or something,

1498
01:10:12,799 --> 01:10:14,610
and I would
point at my victim

1499
01:10:14,701 --> 01:10:15,680
Shut up!

1500
01:10:15,769 --> 01:10:16,440
And I would dance
in front of him.

1501
01:10:16,535 --> 01:10:17,572
I wish you’d shut up!

1502
01:10:17,671 --> 01:10:19,710
Shut up, shut the fuck up!

1503
01:10:19,806 --> 01:10:20,879
We’re driving!

1504
01:10:20,976 --> 01:10:22,353
Go!

1505
01:10:27,514 --> 01:10:29,428
I had the girls
wait in the car

1506
01:10:29,517 --> 01:10:30,860
while I climbed
the telephone pole

1507
01:10:30,950 --> 01:10:32,363
and cut the wire.

1508
01:10:32,452 --> 01:10:33,762
I went down an embankment,

1509
01:10:33,855 --> 01:10:36,862
climbed a fence and
over some barbed wire.

1510
01:10:36,957 --> 01:10:37,993
We were headed
toward the house

1511
01:10:38,093 --> 01:10:40,666
when we saw a car
coming up the driveway.

1512
01:10:40,761 --> 01:10:41,467
Down!

1513
01:10:41,563 --> 01:10:42,770
Get Down!

1514
01:10:49,171 --> 01:10:50,411
Hey!

1515
01:10:54,043 --> 01:10:55,649
Please I won’t say anything!

1516
01:11:01,818 --> 01:11:04,232
It’s starting, come on.

1517
01:11:07,756 --> 01:11:09,260
I turned the engine off,

1518
01:11:09,358 --> 01:11:10,565
rolled the car
back a few yards,

1519
01:11:10,660 --> 01:11:13,143
and I told
Linda to keep watch.

1520
01:11:13,230 --> 01:11:14,539
Then I went up to the house,

1521
01:11:14,631 --> 01:11:16,306
I slit a screen,

1522
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:17,403
climbed in,

1523
01:11:17,501 --> 01:11:19,948
went to the front door
and I let Sadie in.

1524
01:11:30,379 --> 01:11:32,761
Go check for other people.

1525
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:34,853
What time is it?

1526
01:11:34,951 --> 01:11:35,726
Who are you?

1527
01:11:35,819 --> 01:11:36,696
What do you want?

1528
01:11:36,786 --> 01:11:37,526
I’m the Devil,

1529
01:11:37,619 --> 01:11:39,226
and I’m here to do
the Devil’s business.

1530
01:11:39,322 --> 01:11:41,966
Linda, Linda,
I need your knife.

1531
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:44,302
What’s wrong with you?

1532
01:11:44,394 --> 01:11:47,777
Listen for sounds.

1533
01:11:47,865 --> 01:11:48,970
Now Sadie came back in

1534
01:11:49,066 --> 01:11:50,240
with a woman dressed
in a nightgown,

1535
01:11:50,335 --> 01:11:51,781
and told me that
there was another couple

1536
01:11:51,870 --> 01:11:55,116
in one of the bedrooms.

1537
01:11:55,206 --> 01:11:56,115
Watch her!

1538
01:11:56,206 --> 01:11:56,913
What?

1539
01:11:57,008 --> 01:11:58,819
Watch her!

1540
01:11:58,910 --> 01:12:00,788
No!

1541
01:12:04,382 --> 01:12:05,589
Move!

1542
01:12:05,683 --> 01:12:08,223
I’m scared.

1543
01:12:08,319 --> 01:12:10,393
Be careful with
her goddamn you!

1544
01:12:10,489 --> 01:12:12,563
Silence!

1545
01:12:12,658 --> 01:12:15,037
One more word
and you will die.

1546
01:12:15,126 --> 01:12:17,370
He means it!

1547
01:12:19,298 --> 01:12:21,007
Get over there.

1548
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:22,672
Stand there!

1549
01:12:26,639 --> 01:12:28,917
<i>The methamphetamine crystal
that I had snorted earlier</i>

1550
01:12:29,009 --> 01:12:30,751
<i>was blurring
everything together.</i>

1551
01:12:30,843 --> 01:12:32,449
<i>Time was telescoping.</i>

1552
01:12:32,546 --> 01:12:33,685
<i>As soon as I had a thought</i>

1553
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:36,263
<i>I was already
physically acting on it.</i>

1554
01:12:36,350 --> 01:12:37,854
<i>To me these people
were not human,</i>

1555
01:12:37,952 --> 01:12:39,021
<i>they were less than human,</i>

1556
01:12:39,118 --> 01:12:40,998
<i>they were artificial.</i>

1557
01:12:57,304 --> 01:12:58,181
Let her go,

1558
01:12:58,272 --> 01:12:59,879
can’t you see she’s pregnant.

01:13:07,682 --> 01:13:09,027

01:13:09,118 --> 01:13:11,099
oh God please!

1562
01:13:11,185 --> 01:13:11,995
Shut up!

1563
01:13:12,088 --> 01:13:13,500
Shut up!

1564
01:13:23,231 --> 01:13:26,773
Please, we’ll give
you anything you want.

1565
01:13:28,937 --> 01:13:32,354
I want all the
money you have here.

1566
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:36,085
I have money in my bedroom.

1567
01:13:36,179 --> 01:13:38,354
Please, let me get it for you.

1568
01:13:38,446 --> 01:13:40,326
Sadie, go with her.

1569
01:13:43,018 --> 01:13:46,434
How much did you get?

1570
01:13:46,521 --> 01:13:49,506
Seventy two dollars.

1571
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:51,437
Seventy two dollars,
is that all you have?

1572
01:13:51,528 --> 01:13:53,271
How much, do you want?

1573
01:13:53,365 --> 01:13:55,471
I want thousands!

1574
01:13:55,565 --> 01:13:56,511
We have more,

1575
01:13:56,601 --> 01:13:57,739
we can get more, much more,

1576
01:13:57,834 --> 01:13:59,280
if you just give us time.

1577
01:13:59,368 --> 01:14:02,376
Please, please?

1578
01:14:02,472 --> 01:14:03,611
You know I’m not kidding.

01:17:15,808 --> 01:17:17,985
Please let me have my baby!

1610
01:17:18,078 --> 01:17:19,923
Look bitch, I don’t
give a shit about you,

1611
01:17:20,014 --> 01:17:21,460
I don’t care if you’re
gonna have a baby.

1612
01:17:21,549 --> 01:17:23,495
You’d better be ready,
’cause you’re gonna die,

1613
01:17:23,582 --> 01:17:25,529
and I don’t feel
a thing about it.

1614
01:17:43,202 --> 01:17:44,581
Kill her.

1615
01:17:44,671 --> 01:17:46,709
Kill her!

1616
01:17:47,609 --> 01:17:52,324
[Screaming]

1617
01:18:23,947 --> 01:18:26,452
<i>You have to have a
real love in your heart</i>

1618
01:18:26,548 --> 01:18:30,057
<i>to do this for people.</i>

1619
01:18:30,153 --> 01:18:31,634
Well, what’s the big deal?

1620
01:18:31,722 --> 01:18:35,468
A million babies are
born and die each day.

1621
01:18:35,558 --> 01:18:37,665
Tex told me to dip
a towel in her blood

1622
01:18:37,761 --> 01:18:39,800
and write something that
would shock the world.

1623
01:18:39,897 --> 01:18:41,639
So I did.

1624
01:19:02,987 --> 01:19:03,900
Charlie was waiting for us

1625
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:05,058
when we got
back to the ranch,

1626
01:19:05,155 --> 01:19:07,570
sitting naked
in the moonlight.

1627
01:19:07,658 --> 01:19:09,697
He asked us if we had any
remorse for what we’d done,

1628
01:19:09,794 --> 01:19:12,608
and of course the
right answer was “no”.

1629
01:19:12,697 --> 01:19:14,680
I remember Patty
telling me about it

1630
01:19:14,767 --> 01:19:18,479
and then I went through a
change and, and I thought,

1631
01:19:18,570 --> 01:19:21,144
right on, I guess we did it.

1632
01:19:21,441 --> 01:19:22,613
Well, the next night,

1633
01:19:22,707 --> 01:19:26,591
Charlie gathered up Clem,
Sadie, Leslie, Patty and me,

1634
01:19:26,678 --> 01:19:28,626
and, told us to come with him.

1635
01:19:28,713 --> 01:19:29,693
Well, um.

1636
01:19:29,782 --> 01:19:33,755
Charlie made sure that he,

1637
01:19:33,852 --> 01:19:36,233
he sort of made
me feel really guilty

1638
01:19:36,323 --> 01:19:39,169
and said that
I should want to do it,

1639
01:19:39,258 --> 01:19:40,831
because it was
going to help Bobby.

1640
01:19:40,927 --> 01:19:42,134
Linda drove of course,

1641
01:19:42,228 --> 01:19:44,402
because she had the
only valid drivers license.

1642
01:19:44,496 --> 01:19:46,775
And we went to this house that
Charlie had once partied at

1643
01:19:46,868 --> 01:19:48,245
and he said we’re gonna do

1644
01:19:48,334 --> 01:19:50,145
the one on the
right of that house.

1645
01:19:50,236 --> 01:19:53,847
He said that the night
before had been too messy,

1646
01:19:53,940 --> 01:19:57,550
and that this time we were
gonna do it differently.

1647
01:19:57,644 --> 01:19:58,920
So he went inside

1648
01:19:59,012 --> 01:20:00,391
and he tied up the
couple who lived there

1649
01:20:00,481 --> 01:20:02,258
with some leather laces,

1650
01:20:02,350 --> 01:20:03,522
and he came back out

1651
01:20:03,616 --> 01:20:05,894
and he told uh,
Patty and Leslie and me

1652
01:20:05,985 --> 01:20:07,364
to go in and kill them.

1653
01:20:07,454 --> 01:20:10,462
Charlie, can’t, can’t we
just, can we just go now?

1654
01:20:10,557 --> 01:20:11,764
Can we just go now Charlie?

1655
01:20:11,858 --> 01:20:12,896
But don’t tell them
what you’re gonna do.

1656
01:20:12,995 --> 01:20:15,672
Don’t scare them,
that way they won’t fight.

1657
01:20:16,464 --> 01:20:18,241
Where are you taking her?

1658
01:20:18,332 --> 01:20:20,143
Shut him up!

1659
01:20:24,071 --> 01:20:26,145
We’ve got money.

1660
01:20:26,241 --> 01:20:28,052
You don’t have to do this!

1661
01:20:28,143 --> 01:20:30,250
You’re gonna kill
us, aren’t you!

1662
01:20:35,851 --> 01:20:38,027
Please don’t,
please don’t, stop!

1663
01:20:38,121 --> 01:20:39,122
You don’t have to do this.

1664
01:20:39,221 --> 01:20:40,600
I’ve got money.

1665
01:20:40,688 --> 01:20:42,567
I’ve got money, you
don’t have to do this.

1666
01:20:42,657 --> 01:20:45,642
No, leave me alone!

1667
01:20:45,728 --> 01:20:47,573
You don’t have to do this!

1668
01:20:47,664 --> 01:20:48,904
Oh!

1669
01:20:48,997 --> 01:20:49,943
No.

1670
01:20:50,033 --> 01:20:50,773
Where is she?

1671
01:20:50,867 --> 01:20:51,938
Where is she?

1672
01:20:52,035 --> 01:20:53,811
Rosemary!

1673
01:20:53,902 --> 01:20:56,180
Rosemary!

1674
01:20:56,272 --> 01:20:57,412
Shut up pig!

1675
01:20:57,506 --> 01:20:58,383
Shut up pig!

1676
01:20:58,475 --> 01:21:00,547
Because I was...

1677
01:21:00,644 --> 01:21:02,319
I was in love with Bobby.

1678
01:21:10,220 --> 01:21:12,896
[Screaming]

1679
01:21:13,323 --> 01:21:14,895
No, No, No!

1680
01:21:14,992 --> 01:21:16,473
Leno, Leno!

1681
01:21:16,561 --> 01:21:17,835
Help Leno!

1682
01:21:17,929 --> 01:21:18,704
Leno!

1683
01:21:18,796 --> 01:21:20,368
Leno!

1684
01:21:23,134 --> 01:21:23,907
Leno!

1685
01:21:24,001 --> 01:21:24,947
Leno!

1686
01:21:25,036 --> 01:21:28,316
[Screaming]

1687
01:21:37,582 --> 01:21:39,085
Die pig, die!

1688
01:21:42,988 --> 01:21:45,994
Die, pig die!

1689
01:22:06,246 --> 01:22:09,752
Did you kill her?

1690
01:22:09,848 --> 01:22:12,560
No Patty did.

1691
01:22:12,652 --> 01:22:14,930
Oh, you gotta stab.

1692
01:22:26,333 --> 01:22:27,973
Stab.

1693
01:22:37,945 --> 01:22:39,984
<i>If you are willing
to be killed,</i>

1694
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:43,293
<i>you must be willing to kill.</i>

1695
01:22:43,384 --> 01:22:45,263
<i>You gotta stab.</i>

1696
01:22:57,165 --> 01:22:59,877
I know now...

1697
01:22:59,969 --> 01:23:01,779
that...

1698
01:23:01,870 --> 01:23:03,510
that what I did,

1699
01:23:03,605 --> 01:23:09,289
was to Rosemary and Leno,

1700
01:23:09,378 --> 01:23:12,191
and not to things,

1701
01:23:12,281 --> 01:23:15,460
and not pigs.

1702
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:21,402
God, I’m so sorry.

1703
01:23:21,491 --> 01:23:23,370
I just want to
get out of here,

1704
01:23:23,459 --> 01:23:29,438
so I can make something
good with my life.

1705
01:23:29,532 --> 01:23:32,104
Oh, I had Patty
write on the walls,

1706
01:23:32,201 --> 01:23:34,046
and the refrigerator
with their blood.

1707
01:23:34,137 --> 01:23:36,278
The girls got something to
eat from the refrigerator,

1708
01:23:36,373 --> 01:23:37,479
I took a shower.

1709
01:23:37,574 --> 01:23:40,419
And then we just hitch
hiked back to the ranch.

1710
01:23:42,279 --> 01:23:43,452
They’re willing to be in jail.

1711
01:23:43,547 --> 01:23:45,530
They know that they’re
in jail for everybody.

1712
01:23:45,617 --> 01:23:47,063
And maybe we’ll all
have to go to jail

1713
01:23:47,151 --> 01:23:48,222
before we can get them out.

1714
01:23:48,319 --> 01:23:49,823
Maybe we’ll have to go
up to the jail and say,

1715
01:23:49,921 --> 01:23:51,094
Hi, take me.

1716
01:23:51,188 --> 01:23:52,760
But they know they’re
facing the gas chamber,

1717
01:23:52,857 --> 01:23:53,858
and they don’t care.

1718
01:23:53,957 --> 01:23:55,063
That’s what people
don’t understand,

1719
01:23:55,159 --> 01:23:56,504
they don’t care,

1720
01:23:56,595 --> 01:23:57,630
and they’re willing to die

1721
01:23:57,728 --> 01:24:00,041
for all young
people to be free.

1722
01:24:00,331 --> 01:24:02,813
Snitches will
be taken care of.

1723
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:04,539
Charlie said,

1724
01:24:04,636 --> 01:24:07,142
Charlie said
they had to kill Shorty.

1725
01:24:07,238 --> 01:24:10,451
He had to have Clem
chop his head off.

1726
01:24:10,542 --> 01:24:13,526
I heard that
Shorty wouldn’t die

1727
01:24:13,612 --> 01:24:15,320
unless they
chopped his head off.

1728
01:24:15,414 --> 01:24:17,123
Charlie said he knew too much.

1729
01:24:17,215 --> 01:24:19,255
He actually punched her out.

1730
01:24:19,352 --> 01:24:20,331
Shorty?

1731
01:24:20,419 --> 01:24:21,397
Charlie.

1732
01:24:21,486 --> 01:24:22,831
So we cut him into ribbons.

1733
01:24:22,922 --> 01:24:23,902
Shorty?

1734
01:24:23,989 --> 01:24:25,060
Right.

1735
01:24:25,158 --> 01:24:26,159
First we dosed him.

1736
01:24:26,258 --> 01:24:28,069
Then we hogtied him
while he was tripping.

1737
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:29,197
We stuck needles
under his fingernails.

1738
01:24:29,295 --> 01:24:30,171
And in his eyes.

1739
01:24:30,262 --> 01:24:31,299
Through his nipples.

1740
01:24:31,397 --> 01:24:32,934
And cock!

1741
01:24:33,031 --> 01:24:35,539
It’s not nice
to snitch Shorty.

1742
01:24:35,636 --> 01:24:36,944
He pissed himself.

1743
01:24:37,036 --> 01:24:38,540
Piss and blood.

1744
01:24:38,638 --> 01:24:40,119
Then we drug him
through the mud

1745
01:24:40,207 --> 01:24:42,712
And he was
screaming for his life

1746
01:24:42,809 --> 01:24:43,879
And Charlie gave the word

1747
01:24:43,978 --> 01:24:45,582
And we stabbed him like Caesar

1748
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:48,788
Everybody, the whole family.

1749
01:24:51,818 --> 01:24:52,891
He just wouldn’t die,

1750
01:24:52,988 --> 01:24:55,629
we just kept stabbing
and stabbing and stabbing

1751
01:24:55,723 --> 01:24:58,228
and stabbing, and
stabbing, and stabbing

1752
01:24:58,325 --> 01:25:01,401
So Clem cut his head off.

1753
01:25:01,496 --> 01:25:02,841
We cut him into nine pieces.

1754
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:05,243
And buried him in nine places.

1755
01:25:05,333 --> 01:25:09,285
His legs are buried
right under you.

1756
01:25:09,370 --> 01:25:12,115
It’s not nice to snitch.

1757
01:25:12,208 --> 01:25:13,620
The girls made up that story

1758
01:25:13,709 --> 01:25:15,691
about us chopping him
up into nine pieces.

1759
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:18,990
Even the prosecutor
put that in his book.

1760
01:25:19,081 --> 01:25:21,120
But when Clem led the
Police out to the ranch,

1761
01:25:21,216 --> 01:25:23,564
they found the skeleton
intact of course.

1762
01:25:23,652 --> 01:25:24,460
No, no!

1763
01:25:24,553 --> 01:25:25,464
Pull over!

1764
01:25:25,554 --> 01:25:27,057
Get out!

1765
01:25:35,264 --> 01:25:36,744
God help me!

1766
01:25:42,605 --> 01:25:43,515
It’s ready.

1767
01:25:43,605 --> 01:25:44,882
The revolution is ready,

1768
01:25:44,974 --> 01:25:46,681
and as soon as Charlie
gets out it’s on.

1769
01:25:46,774 --> 01:25:48,723
The revolution is on!

1770
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:50,884
And if you try
to hurt Charlie,

1771
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:53,360
you’ll all die!

1772
01:25:53,450 --> 01:25:54,622
He is God,

1773
01:25:54,717 --> 01:25:55,458
Perfect.

1774
01:25:55,553 --> 01:25:56,463
As perfection is.

1775
01:25:56,554 --> 01:25:58,627
Because it’s exactly
the same thing.

1776
01:25:58,722 --> 01:25:59,666
I had a brother once,

1777
01:25:59,757 --> 01:26:01,965
who was shot
and killed like that,

1778
01:26:02,059 --> 01:26:03,437
for nothing in the war.

1779
01:26:03,526 --> 01:26:05,906
I mean, it’s exactly
the same thing.

1780
01:26:05,996 --> 01:26:09,276
Every single day
love is being killed.

1781
01:26:09,367 --> 01:26:10,779
We’re all in this together.

1782
01:26:10,868 --> 01:26:14,148
You gotta stab.

1783
01:26:14,237 --> 01:26:16,413
As long as Charlie
is locked away

1784
01:26:16,507 --> 01:26:18,511
in his asylum,
prison, grave,

1785
01:26:18,609 --> 01:26:20,818
you can say anything
you want about him.

1786
01:26:20,911 --> 01:26:23,863
You can make more bogus books
and movies about his life.

1787
01:26:23,950 --> 01:26:24,951
You can joke about him,

1788
01:26:25,050 --> 01:26:26,690
you can pretend to be him,

1789
01:26:26,785 --> 01:26:30,236
you can say and do
anything you want.

1790
01:26:30,323 --> 01:26:32,235
But the truth is,

1791
01:26:32,324 --> 01:26:35,366
you don’t have the
soul to face him.

1792
01:26:35,461 --> 01:26:37,067
You’re a lot of vultures.

1793
01:26:37,162 --> 01:26:38,437
You are.

1794
01:26:38,531 --> 01:26:41,640
You live off the sacrifice
of the young people.

1795
01:26:41,733 --> 01:26:43,112
You’re bloodsuckers,

1796
01:26:43,202 --> 01:26:45,046
you are,

1797
01:26:45,136 --> 01:26:49,648
with your little
phallic symbols you know?

1798
01:26:49,742 --> 01:26:51,553
We’re waiting for our
father to be set free.

1799
01:26:51,644 --> 01:26:53,751
He’s a genius,
you don’t realize.

1800
01:26:53,846 --> 01:26:55,886
It’s the second
crucifixion of Christ!

1801
01:26:55,983 --> 01:26:58,898
Judgment Day
is coming, people!

1802
01:27:01,022 --> 01:27:02,400
Leslie’s lawyer,

1803
01:27:02,489 --> 01:27:03,992
Ronald.

1804
01:27:04,091 --> 01:27:06,334
The press called him
“Leslie’s Hippy Lawyer”

1805
01:27:06,426 --> 01:27:08,374
And we all thought
he was pretty cool.

1806
01:27:08,461 --> 01:27:10,501
But, he was just
like the others.

1807
01:27:10,597 --> 01:27:12,977
He was the first of
the retaliation murders.

1808
01:27:17,806 --> 01:27:19,617
We are all facing
the gas chamber!

1809
01:27:19,708 --> 01:27:21,052
Hey, hey man,

1810
01:27:21,142 --> 01:27:22,418
what do you
think would happen

1811
01:27:22,511 --> 01:27:24,994
if one night seventy
five heads were cut off?

1812
01:27:27,282 --> 01:27:28,820
Excuse me.

1813
01:27:28,918 --> 01:27:31,059
<i>You have just
judged yourselves!</i>

1814
01:27:31,153 --> 01:27:33,396
<i>You better lock your doors
and watch your own kids!</i>

1815
01:27:33,488 --> 01:27:35,059
<i>Your whole system’s a game,</i>

1816
01:27:35,156 --> 01:27:36,227
<i>you blind, stupid people,</i>

1817
01:27:36,323 --> 01:27:39,307
<i>your children will
turn against you!</i>

1818
01:27:42,831 --> 01:27:43,468
Death!

1819
01:27:43,565 --> 01:27:45,548
That’s what
you’re all gonna get!

1820
01:27:50,137 --> 01:27:51,140
<i>I will fight!</i>

1821
01:27:51,239 --> 01:27:52,150
<i>I will fight!</i>

1822
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:53,151
<i>I will fight!</i>

1823
01:27:53,242 --> 01:27:55,349
<i>I will fight!</i>

1824
01:27:55,444 --> 01:27:59,294
Your children will rise up,

1825
01:27:59,382 --> 01:28:01,158
and kill you.

1826
01:28:01,248 --> 01:28:03,128
<i>Let the night roar</i>

1827
01:28:03,218 --> 01:28:05,131
<i>because they can hear us!</i>

1828
01:28:07,689 --> 01:28:11,734

1830
01:28:35,552 --> 01:28:37,262
Wait a minute!

1831
01:28:38,155 --> 01:28:40,469
Wait a minute!

1832

1834
01:28:53,071 --> 01:28:54,518
What the fuck.

1835
01:28:56,674 --> 01:28:59,658

You taught him!

1845

You taught him!

1846
01:29:34,982 --> 01:29:37,260
Ahhhhh!

1847
01:29:41,522 --> 01:29:43,024
Ahhhhh!

<i>You can tell in

1850
01:29:58,874 --> 01:30:01,287
Why you wearing
that shirt Todd?

1851
01:30:01,376 --> 01:30:02,355
Um.

1852
01:30:02,443 --> 01:30:03,549
This is Charlie.

1853
01:30:03,645 --> 01:30:04,681
Show Dennis the back.

1854
01:30:04,780 --> 01:30:05,589
Yeah.

1855
01:30:05,681 --> 01:30:07,287
Man Dennis has seen
this shirt before.

1856
01:30:07,383 --> 01:30:10,856
No, man I forget,
what does that shirt say?

1857
01:30:14,856 --> 01:30:16,394
What?

1858
01:30:16,491 --> 01:30:18,530
What the fuck is
that supposed to mean?

1859
01:30:18,627 --> 01:30:20,233
Charlie doesn’t surf?

1860
01:30:20,329 --> 01:30:21,934
C’mon man, let’s
get out of here.

1861
01:30:22,029 --> 01:30:23,636
Let’s go man.

1862
01:30:23,732 --> 01:30:25,715
I thought you guys
knew about this shit?

1863
01:30:25,802 --> 01:30:26,940
No.

1864
01:30:27,036 --> 01:30:27,743
Yeah, yeah.

1865
01:30:27,838 --> 01:30:28,680
I mean, you know,

1866
01:30:28,771 --> 01:30:30,411
before Charlie wasted all
them people and everything,

1867
01:30:30,506 --> 01:30:31,383
you know,

1868
01:30:31,474 --> 01:30:32,749
before they sent him out
to the clink, you know,

1869
01:30:32,842 --> 01:30:34,152
he used to surf.

1870
01:30:34,243 --> 01:30:36,419
You know, Charlie don’t
surf no more, he’s in jail.
