00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:17,999
[Whispering]

2
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,992
Happy birthday, son.

3
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,995
Here! They were your fathers.

4
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:34,870
Hey.

5
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,278
Hey, these aren't ordinary dice.
They're very special.

6
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,790
Watch.

7
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,189
Numbers 1, 2, or 3 means you
can sit there and keep sulking,

8
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,192
but numbers 4, 5, and 6 means you

9
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,637
have to forget about all your so-called friends
and make the most of the party. Agreed?

10
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,230
Agreed?

11
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,110
Good.

12
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,355
Here we go.

13
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,799
It's settled!

14
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,116
You don't have any say in the matter.

15
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,070
YOUNG ROLAND: 5.

16
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,595
You go first.

17
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,393
Get on the raft.

18
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,516
No.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,434
I said get on the raft, Matthew.

20
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,276
Come on, Matthew boy, it's easy.

21
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,879
- No!
- Ðœom!

22
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,555
Help!

23
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,950
Mom!

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,797
Matthew! Hang on, boy!

25
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,115
Hang on!

26
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,629
Help!

27
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,917
Stay calm, I'm nearly there, sweetheart.

28
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,312
- Give me your hand!
- Help!

29
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,994
Come on, Matthew! Give me your hand!
Give me your hand, boy!

30
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,796
Got you.

31
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,155
Hold on!

32
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,753
Hold on, Matthew! Hold on

33
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,276
[screams]

34
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,357
No!

35
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,631
No!

36
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,595
Matthew!

37
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,352
Hey, you guys, dinner's ready!

38
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,949
Hello?

39
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,715
- What are they doing out there?
- They're playing with their toy soldiers.

40
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,315
- Cute, huh?
- They're a bit old for soldiers, aren't they?

41
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,348
Well, I thought dragging Jonathan down the aisle
might knock it out of him.

42
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,998
It did for a while,

43
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,793
but recently...

44
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,073
the best man's had other ideas!
And I've been happily married to the two of them ever since.

45
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,757
JONATHAN WHEATS: Up here, we have the outliers,
Down here we have the bad guys, the French..

46
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,112
And when the sun goes down, the bad guys

47
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,512
are going to sneak up towards the big guys
and kick the living daylights out of them.

48
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,399
French divisional assault
on the Pratzen Heights,

49
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,836
Austerlitz, December the 2nd 1805.

50
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,271
December 2nd 1805?

51
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,475
I can't believe you still
remember this garbage.

52
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,797
Well, I remember when this garbage
used to take up most of our weekends.

53
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,113
The old times have changed. Now I've got
more important things on my mind.

54
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,429
Like what?

55
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,033
Like Mary.

56
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,556
No.

57
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,348
- Michelle?
- No.

58
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,555
Melissa?

59
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,989
Margaret?

60
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,316
You are turning into
one big walking hormone.

61
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,679
You know I can have her
off the property by midnight.

62
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,429
You want to bet?

63
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,158
No, no, I think you're taking on
a huge responsibility.

64
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,119
It's a specialized job that requires
a very special person, Mary.

65
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,638
My name is Margaret.

66
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,269
Margaret.

67
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,550
Sorry.

68
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,672
What is he doing here?

69
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,868
- Doesn't he ever give up?
- He's just spinning the ball around the park.

70
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,715
God. He was on first base by the
appetizer and second base, by the time we got to the potatoes.

71
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,758
If he gets to dessert, he'll
think he's on a home run.

72
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,909
We'll see about that.

73
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,315
- You haven't heard the worst of it.
- What?

74
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,669
She didn't drive.

75
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,950
Oh god.

76
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,917
Michael, I still say this is the dumbest game
you have ever come up with.

77
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,228
Beats bridge.

78
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,958
I've played this
naked with baby oil.

79
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,639
- Really?

80
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,998
OK, OK, it's my go.

81
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,675
Left hand green, left
hand green, left hand green!

82
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,035
- Left hand green!
- Yes!

83
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,712
- I'm going to go.
- Jonathan!

84
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,517
Thanks for a great evening!
Wish we didn't have to go.

85
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,511
- Well then, don't! Stay for another couple of drinks.

86
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,555
Oh, no, no, no. It's almost midnight and
I've got a big day tomorrow. Bye.

87
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,314
There you go.

88
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,199
- Are you sure you don't mind driving her home, Michael?
- Not at all.

89
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,755
Oh, I almost forgot.

90
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,436
If you two aren't doing anything on the 26th,
I have two tickets to "La boheme" that I can't use.

91
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,035
- "La boheme?"
- Oh, you've got to be joking.

92
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,476
- You shut up!
- I won them at an agency raffle.

93
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,037
- So how about it?
- Thank you! We'd love them!

94
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,630
Good.

95
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,110
Bye!

96
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,874
- What's "La boheme?"
- It's a musical.

97
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,589
Ah shit!

98
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,830
Hello?

99
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,634
Baby, it's only me.

100
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,477
Hi. Listen, can you hold on? I'll be right back.
I'm having a small problem.

101
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,396
OK, guys. Cool it!

102
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,955
One elephant.

103
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,635
Two elephants.

104
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,235
Three elephants...

105
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,470
Hello?

106
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,670
Hello?

107
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,791
PA: Ladies and gentlemen, this
evening's performance of "La boheme" is about to begin.

108
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,791
Would you please take your seats?

109
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,157
When it rains, it pours.
Right, Mrs. Waterson?

110
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,470
Damn.

111
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,235
Damn, damn!

112
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,469
Damn, damn!

113
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,557
God damn you, Jonathan, when are we going
to get a new roof?

114
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,438
Hi, it's Jonathan.
I'm at the opera house. Where are you?

115
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,509
Oh, no!

116
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,668
No, no!

117
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,714
Surprise!

118
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,794
Jesus Beth, can't you take a joke...

119
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,550
ROLAND COPPING: Yes?

120
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,510
Oh, fine.

121
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,433
Thank you very much.

122
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,029
Good bye.

123
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,433
JUDGE: There's no doubt in my mind, Mrs. Wheats,
that you considered your life to be at risk.

124
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,951
And in extreme conditions, you acted
with resourcefulness and courage.

125
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,555
I only hope that the scars that you and your husband
now possess will heal as quickly as possible.

126
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:50,556
It is my opinion that the deceased was a tragic victim of his own misguided judgement.

127
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,515
And it will be my recommendation that no charges
be laid against Elizabeth Mary Wheats

128
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,195
by the Department of
Public Prosecutions.

129
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:03,550
And it is the finding of this inquest, that death occurred by accident.

130
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,999
You may stand down.

131
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,109
Jonathan!

132
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,951
Don't worry, I'll get it.

133
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,390
Yes?

134
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,193
- Mrs. Wheats?
- Yes.

135
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,553
Roland Copping, Carton Insurance.

136
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,950
Oh, yes, please.

137
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,432
Please come in.

138
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,711
My husbands' out back in the study.

139
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,629
BETH: Jonathan!

140
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,236
Sweetheart!

141
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,030
- I'm busy, Beth!
BETH: The
insurance man is here!

142
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,589
All right, I'm coming.

143
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,635
Therapy?

144
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,751
Well, I guess you could call it that.

145
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,032
Do you mind if I, uh...

146
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,718
- Hello. Jonathan Wheats.
- Roland Copping, Carton Insurance.

147
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,477
Oh, I'm sorry. It's the painting.
It reminds me of my childhood.

148
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,312
- Would you like to come into the lounge room and we can...
- Certainly. Absolutely.

149
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,397
Ah, little soldiers.

150
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,799
You know, I never really had
much time for them myself. But emm...
They don't really do much, do they?

151
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,675
They just sort of...

152
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,755
stand there.

153
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,919
Can I get you a drink? Beer, wine...

154
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,999
whiskey?
- Coke.

155
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,276
- I think we can handle that.
- Splendid.

156
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,833
Smells new.

157
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,275
Yes, it is.

158
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,517
Well, I'll try not to take up too much
of your time, Mr. Wheats.

159
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,990
It's about your claims.

160
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,115
One for property
damage, one for theft.

161
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,879
Damage: one sofa, video recorder,
CD player, lampshades...

162
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,476
Carpets, table, two broken cabinets.

163
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,395
Theft:

164
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,916
One set of
solid silver cutlery.

165
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,676
- The only thing stolen?
- Yes.

166
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,509
What a shame. They're really
fine-looking pieces, too.

167
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,275
- Victorian?
- They're Georgian. They're our family heirloom.

168
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,519
Thief with taste, eh?

169
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,031
Well, that's a rare thing these days.

170
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,388
So is this the room
where the guy, you know, got the...

171
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:32,950
Yes.

172
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,990
Mr. Copping, the guy was a really good
friend of ours, so I'd prefer not to discuss
the subject in front of my wife.

173
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,595
It's been six months and our lives are
just starting to get back to normal, so...

174
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,235
Understood.

175
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,476
- Please.
- Mum's the word. Mum's the word.

176
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,075
Thank you.

177
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,156
Well...

178
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,397
Everything seems to be in order.

179
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,950
The police have got their hands full, of course,
trying to trace the missing cutlery

180
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,032
and whoever was driving the getaway car. But...

181
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,995
To be quite honest, I don't reckon there's
much chance of you seeing either of them again,
which is...

182
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,599
a bit of a shame, really.

183
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,757
Would you like to see anything else?

184
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,038
No, no, no. I've taken up too much
of your time already, Mr. Wheats.

185
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,476
I'll just get straight home
and start processing the claim.

186
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,039
- Which should take how long, Mr. Copping?
- Oh, if all goes well, maybe two, three weeks.

187
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,991
So we'll be seeing you again?

188
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,189
Most definitely.

189
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:57,196
- Well, would you like my card, just in case?
- No, that's OK. I've got that.

190
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,432
Of course, if you've got any other questions,
you can always call me at home on this number.

191
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,828
- Fine. No problem.
- Excellent. Well, goodnight.

192
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,478
Oh, thanks for the Coke.

193
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,150
Hi.

194
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,119
What are you doing?

195
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,195
Remembering.

196
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,070
Hi!

197
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,672
Sorry I'm late.

198
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:36,916
Beth?

199
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,352
Come into the dining room.

200
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,876
What?

201
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,593
Come over here and sit down.

202
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,999
What are you doing?

203
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,110
- Sit.

204
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,393
- What's going on?

205
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,756
Fun.

206
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,110
Remember when we used to have fun?

207
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,236
- Oh really?
- And I have an even bigger surprise.

208
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,439
Why do you want to do this?

209
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,512
Because Michael would have.

210
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,876
It's been seven months, Jonathan,

211
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,032
and it's time we let it go.

212
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,996
So let's do it with a bang. Let's do something
he'd be proud of.

213
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,910
For one night in our lives,
let's think with out dicks.

214
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,270
Shit!

215
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,988
Good evening, Jonathan.

216
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,718
Hello, Beth. Sorry about the hour.

217
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,834
- I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
- No, not at all.

218
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:17,072
I actually need to run a few details
pass Beth, if that's all right.

219
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,072
At 10 o'clock at night?

220
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,990
No Mr. Copping, to be perfectly
honest, that's not all right.

221
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,755
Don't you think business hours would be
a better time to discuss details?

222
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,595
I am interrupting something, aren't I?
Um, well, look, if you could just
spare me a couple of minutes,

223
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,798
I could get rid of these questions and I'll
probably be out of your hair for good.

224
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,352
I don't think I have anything to say that
I haven't said 100 times already.

225
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,473
If you have any questions,
I suggest you read the police report.

226
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,833
- I think I'll come back tomorrow.
- That's a good idea.

227
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,589
Oh, for God's sake!

228
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,273
No. Let's just get this over with.

229
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,235
Thank you.

230
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,551
Shouldn't be just a couple of minutes.

231
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,956
Now about this accomplice.

232
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,755
When approximately did you hear the
getaway car driving off?

233
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,913
I mean, what time?

234
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,753
I don't remember exactly.

235
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,476
It was the neighbor's who reported that.

236
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,311
I was too busy trying to get to the opera.

237
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:33,072
So we'll assume whoever this... mystery
accomplice was saw you go inside,

238
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,993
waited around in the hope that
Michael would get wise and come out,

239
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,753
heard the first scream and then
just took off?

240
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,113
No I recall it took off just
after I entered the front door.

241
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,794
- I can't tell you the exact time.
- You do remember now?

242
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,598
- No, I don't remember.
- So do you recall?

243
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,476
I...

244
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,757
- I don't know why you're...
- Well, what do I take as fact, Beth,
recall or remember?

245
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,359
- Did you identify a driver?
- No! Mr. Copping, please!

246
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,749
Oh, I'm sorry.

247
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,033
It's an old habit I picked up from my father.

248
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,152
He was a war hero, you know.

249
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,072
This was grand-dad's.

250
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,748
It's very old.

251
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,312
You see how they shine?

252
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:33,073
It's always said that in the right hands
they would become transparent,

253
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,391
the numbers would just melt together.

254
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,911
They can do wonderful things.

255
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,439
Mr. Copping...

256
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,355
What are you talking about?

257
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,755
My dice.

258
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,232
Well, they're very nice dice, but...

259
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,274
I don't see what relevance they have
to your being here.

260
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,629
What relevance.

261
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,876
1 to 3 says we continue our discussion now...

262
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,838
...4 to 6 says I return tomorrow.

263
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,113
Very well, Mr. Wheats, I shall return tomorrow.

264
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,039
- I'll make sure I'm in.
- Now just hold on a minute!

265
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,759
Goodness me, look at the time!
Doesn't it fly when you're having fun?

266
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,673
Mr. Copping, if you have any questions,
I'd suggest you ask them now.

267
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,670
Right.

268
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,390
What, have either of
you seen this fork before?

269
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,989
Yes, it's ours.

270
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,477
I mean, it looks like ours.

271
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,078
- Where did you get this?
- These things turn up.

272
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,789
Jonathan?

273
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,679
Well, I'll leave it with you, shall I?
Till morning, when I return for the search.

274
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,672
- What?
- Well, new evidence requires a
new search, Beth - boring, I know.

275
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,390
But it is standard
company policy, I can assure you.
Don't worry, I'll see myself out.

276
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,629
Good night!

277
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,912
Well, at least we know what
happened to Rosemary's baby.

278
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,956
What the hell is going on around here?

279
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,879
The guy was here to assess the damage
to the table,not to play Yahtzee on it.

280
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,637
Jesus Christ!

281
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,156
If you think I'm going to let that
nutcase tear apart my house, then...

282
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,278
Sorry, Beth, but that eye was
going to bother me all...

283
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,196
...night.

284
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,309
Good night, again.

285
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,994
Goddamn it!

286
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,117
Don't you dare walk out on this!

287
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,394
Jonathan, you get your ass back in here!

288
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,915
One elephant!

289
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,589
Two elephants!

290
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,913
Three goddamn elephants!

291
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,631
Do you mind? I'm creating.

292
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:54,874
You know, we spent all morning
at school today making these cities
out of egg cartons.

293
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,710
I didn't know what to say then. So I said,
well, maybe one or two trees grow

294
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,997
and then Edward decided to tell them
the truth about Christmas.

295
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,050
And that they couldn't grow any trees
because of the yellow goop, anyway.
And I said, well, what happens at Christmas time?

296
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,594
This is why I was asking him
what the matter was.

297
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,554
And I saw in the corner little Jack looking...

298
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,829
Jonathan?

299
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,114
Hi, there.

300
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,390
I'm sorry.

301
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,435
It's just that man gives me the creeps.

302
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,189
Come here.

303
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,589
I'll get it.

304
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,757
Waky-waky, Beth! Rise and shine.

305
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,236
Jonathan, top of the morning to you.

306
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,515
You're early.

307
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,435
You're late.

308
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,235
Oh Christ!

309
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,313
Just let me have a shower and you
can unleash the sniffer dogs.

310
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:13,791
That won't be necessary. I have decided
to approve your claim immediately.

311
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,275
That's great.

312
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,835
How come?

313
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,948
Simple, really.

314
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,191
Just retracing the steps.

315
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,518
Michael Allen, he breaks into his
best friend's house, and having

316
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:33,355
just removed the first load of goods,
he finds himself trapped inside by the...

317
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,791
unexpected arrival of the now missing
cutlery's owner, Mrs. Beth Wheats.

318
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,516
Realizing that the game's up,
he decides on a bit of fun.

319
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,513
So wielding the old

320
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,633
Sunday roast carver,

321
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,438
he takes the joke a little
bit too far, as usual.

322
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,277
His reward - oh dear!

323
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,316
A six inch crossbow bolt
right through the heart.

324
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,839
And the mystery accomplice does not
speed off into the night with the goods.

325
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,192
What are you talking about?

326
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,031
Well, the mystery accomplice stands
patiently outside the opera house,

327
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,954
awaiting the arrival of his
faithful wife.

328
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,231
- What?
- What are you insinuating?

329
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,198
I'm not insinuating anything, Johnny
old boy. I'm stating a fact.

330
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,917
Your husband, Mrs. Wheats,

331
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,159
is the mystery accomplice.

332
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,475
Get out!

333
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,196
Let's not get overexcited here,
Johnny boy.

334
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:45,076
- Let's discuss this like gentlemen.
- Get out.

335
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,152
Don't make things any worse for yourself.

336
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,589
I dropped my...

337
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,876
Out!

338
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,399
You forgot this.

339
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,639
Well, goody.

340
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,515
I'll swap you.

341
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:10,434
The fork I gave you last night
was a very good copy.

342
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,155
This one, though,

343
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,995
is for real.

344
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,271
You shouldn't have checked
your hiding spot, Jonathan.

345
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,350
What?

346
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,189
Jonathan?

347
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,356
What the hell is going on?

348
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,839
Talk to me!

349
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,628
Close the door.

350
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,309
Jonathan?

351
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,390
Oh, no!

352
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,232
It was so simple.

353
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,033
You spend half your life
drowning in interest rates,

354
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:35,195
dishing out stupid premiums and
up-to-you hilton mortgages.

355
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,594
Then one day you come home
after going out to dinner.

356
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,558
Your house has been stripped, and
whamo, you can buy the new car.

357
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,555
It's simple.

358
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,713
Everybody does it.

359
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,672
Nothing could go wrong.

360
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,358
Except you coming home.

361
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:12,238
If it was all so goddamn simple,
why didn't you just tell me?

362
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,469
How many...

363
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,990
Look, I didn't have a choice.
He started putting words
in my mouth - insurance claim,

364
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,355
the accomplice, the getaway car.

365
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,832
I mean, what... what getaway car?

366
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,712
I didn't know what to say so
I didn't say anything at all.

367
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,472
I understand why you and Michael did it.

368
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,873
I understand why you played along.

369
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,433
But I don't understand
why you didn't tell me.

370
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,677
Well, what difference does it make now?

371
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,268
Whether it's fraud or perjury
or manslaughter,

372
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,353
I'm going to go to jail.

373
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,349
Call him.

374
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,236
Let's hear what he has to say.

375
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,593
- Ronald Copping.
- Hello, it's Jonathan Wheats.

376
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,911
- Yes, Jonathan.
- I think we have to talk.
Would you liketo come to my house?

377
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,356
- Oh, I'd love to. Shall we say 10:00 AM?
- That'll be fine.

378
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,911
- Excellent. Well, I'll see you then.

379
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,997
OK, Cesar, 1 to 3 says they'll play.

380
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,992
2, 3, 4, 5.

381
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,718
I think I'll have another hotel on Mayfair,

382
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,400
and just a little bit of cash
for the decorating.

383
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,473
Come on, Beth. Your go.

384
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,839
Your go, Beth.

385
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,590
5.

386
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,472
1, 2, 3, 4...

387
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,955
Oh, dear!

388
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:44,636
Do not pass go. Do not collect 200 pounds.
Go directly to jail.

389
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,193
What do you want?

390
00:38:50,393 --> 00:38:51,693
[I've Got You Under My Skin" starts playing]

391
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,552
You're not going to count it?

392
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,039
Oh, I don't think there's any need.
If you're short, I'll be the first to let you know.

393
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,193
Look, I'm sorry about all these mucky dealings,
you know, but in the great card game of life...

394
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,395
Get out!

395
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,874
It has been a pleasure.
Hope to see you again soon.

396
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,473
Don't hold your breath.

397
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,793
3 to 5 says I leave them alone.

398
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,072
1, 2!

399
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,473
Welcome back, Beth!

400
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,999
Thanks, gang.
It's good to be back.

401
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:41,519
You have me walking my cat.
I'm looking very tall there, aren't I?

402
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,149
That's great.

403
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,276
Jenny, is that me on a beach?

404
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,514
- Did we collect shells on that beach?
- Yes.

405
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,750
That's a beautiful one.

406
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,637
And Ethan, where did you
have me go on my holiday?

407
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,872
Is that a ski resort?

408
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:01,916
No?

409
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,356
It's a car accident.

410
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,956
Well, you are far off.

411
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,875
- Hey, you all right?
- Jonathan?

412
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,870
I know.

413
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,879
I know. Just hang on a minute.
I'm coming to get you.

414
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,033
I want the set.

415
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,595
The whole set.

416
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,476
And this.

417
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:02,195
All right, that's enough! First time was fair. You've got your money.

418
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:06,193
This is straight blackmail. I'm not going to stand for it!
I'm going to go to the police.

419
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,670
Oh, really?

420
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:12,195
Well, right here, there's the telephone.
Go on, call the police.

421
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,635
Can I have my cutlery now, please?

422
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,476
No.

423
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,832
Give him the silverware, Jonathan.

424
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,076
No!

425
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,151
- Give him the silverware!
- Like hell I will!

426
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,351
All right. Now let's get one thing quite clear.
You're not going to get anything else out of me!

427
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,838
Well, it has been a pleasure
doing business with you both...

428
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,230
...again.

429
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:03,435
Oh, probably not a good time, Beth, but I'd like
to lend you these to help out with your paintings.

430
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,635
Get out.

431
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,233
- He's not going to stop.
- Oh, yes he is.

432
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,236
- He's going to take everything we own.
- He wouldn't dare!

433
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,676
Excuse me, can I help you?

434
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:50,358
Oh, I am sorry. I knocked earlier
and nobody answered.

435
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,719
- Well, we were probably in the shower.
Can I help you?
- I'm from Copping Insurance.

436
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,872
Roland Copping sent me down to
do the valuation you requested?

437
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,116
Get away.

438
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,078
Get away from my car!

439
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,318
Get away from my car!

440
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:14,753
The car is next, fine!
I don't mine handing over the lease.

441
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,912
While he's at it, he might as well
pick up the mortgage on the house!

442
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:25,829
Why?

443
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,637
Why is he doing this to us?

444
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:30,836
No!

445
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,276
No!

446
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,991
This has got to stop.

447
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,676
I can't take this anymore.

448
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:00,196
ROLAND COPPING: You know, the most honest
and unique period of life is childhood.

449
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:04,592
I mean, the only way that child is going
to learn that jumping off the monkey bar
is going to hurt him

450
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,877
is by taking the chance and jumping
off the monkey bar.

451
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:12,039
Which I suppose makes children
the biggest gamblers of all.

452
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,512
Still, doesn't last forever.

453
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,913
Kids grow up,

454
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,270
don't they?

455
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,353
What do you want, Roland?

456
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,751
Whatever it is, just ask.

457
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,949
But please, leave my wife out of it.

458
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,437
I'll tell you what we're going to do.

459
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,993
We're going to roll with the dice.

460
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,951
Now, if it lands on a 1, 2, or 3,

461
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,916
you get to walk out of here scot-free.

462
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:50,752
And by that, I promise,
cross my heart, hope to die,
you'll never, ever hear from me again.

463
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:53,910
But...

464
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,831
If it lands on a 4, 5, or 6...

465
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,550
You get to be my slave for one hour.

466
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:06,556
And by that, I mean you have to do
exactly as I tell you for 60 minutes.

467
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,229
Fair?

468
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,715
Here.

469
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,715
You roll.

470
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,039
You're out of your mind.

471
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,874
- Hello?
- Yes, is Mr. Wall there, please??

472
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,671
- No.
- Is Mrs. Wall there?

473
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:26,115
- No.
- Are there any Walls there?

474
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,358
Hey, listen, you've
got a major wrong number.

475
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,598
This is a telephone box
in the middle of nowhere.

476
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,116
So there aren't any walls there?

477
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,193
I'm afraid not.

478
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,919
Well, you'd better get out quick
because the roof's falling down.

479
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,393
Na, na, na, na!
[inaudible] I fooled you!

480
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:47,989
Oh my god!

481
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:51,795
My god!

482
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,389
[non-english speech]

483
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:04,709
Oh, shit!

484
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:27,629
Jonathan?

485
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:31,989
Jonathan?

486
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:45,990
Hello?

487
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,998
Ah, Betty old girl. What's cooking good looking?

488
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,268
What do you want?

489
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,870
Oh, lots of money would be nice.

490
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:59,990
- Sorry, we're out.
- Antique cutlery?

491
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,833
- No.
- Then I suppose dinner is out of the question.

492
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:05,957
- Listen, you asshole!
- May I speak to Jonathan, please?

493
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:07,916
No.

494
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:12,877
- You can speak to me. What is it you want?
- A car, Beth. I'm sick of mine.

495
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,079
Which car, Roland?

496
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:16,836
Both of them.

497
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,076
OK.

498
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,838
Here's what we're going to do.

499
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:28,639
I'm going to pretend I never got this call.
I'm going to hang up the phone.

500
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,472
I'm going to go back to work.

501
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,958
And I am going to attempt
to lead a normal life.

502
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,477
I'm calling your
bluff, Mr. Copping.

503
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,394
Somebody has to draw the line
around here somewhere.

504
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:46,190
And I guess it's going to have to be me.
Because I'm damned if I'm going to sit back
and let you destroy my marriage!

505
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,317
Am I to understand that this round
is between you and I, Beth?

506
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,071
It's a beautiful day.

507

SPEAKER [ON TAPE]:
I enjoy my work.

508
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,118
It's very challenging.

509
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,716
I enjoy my work. It's very challenging.

510
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,756
SPEAKER [ON TAPE]:
I won't get angry today.

511
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,197
Let's not jump to any conclusions.

00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,629
Mrs. Wheats.

Mrs. Wheats.

514
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:22,829
Excuse me.

515
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,669
Detective.

516
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,599
How are you today?

517
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,755
Not bad. What can I do for you?

518
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,313
Is Mr. Wheats inside?

519
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,351
No, No, he's not.

520
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,154
Oh, well, he said he wanted us to meet him here.

521
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,709
- Oh, really? Why?
- Your crossbow.

522
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,113
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you like this.

523
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,519
Oh, it's all right.

524
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,349
Mrs. Wheats...

525
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,795
I don't quite understand what's going on.

526
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:01,919
You see, your husband phoned us this morning
and asked us to bring this back here.

527
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,871
Well, I wish he called me.

528
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,039
It's all right.

529
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:14,158
Shall we move in there?
Thank you.

530
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,758
So how is your investigation going?

531
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,039
Nothing new, I'm frankly.
No leads at all, as a matter of fact.

532
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:30,031
You see, stolen goods of this nature
are always the most difficult kind.

533
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,353
And well, your things being solid silver and all,

534
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:40,038
well, I wouldn't take any bets on them
turning up in a pawn shop.

535
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:44,990
As sad as this must be to hear, I'm afraid
we're just going to have to say good bye
to your silverware.

536
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,635
Which is a great shame, I know.

537
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,431
It was a beautiful set.

538
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:57,634
- Yes.
- From what your husband tells me,

539
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,471
impossible to replace.

540
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,599
No. I mean, yes.

541
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,239
I'm not sure...

542
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:12,869
Oh my god.

543
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,229
Oh my god.

544
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,274
I am so sorry.

545
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:22,118
Quick, into the kitchen.

546
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:34,078
I am so sorry!

547
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,235
Don't worry about it, Mrs. Wheats.

548
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,755
It's just that whenever I think of the silverware,

549
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:42,588
I throw up.

550
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,231
I'll get some disinfectant.

551
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,230
Hi, Wendy, it's Beth Wheats.

552
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:09,908
Is Jonathan there?

553
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:13,551
What do you mean he took the afternoon off?

554
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:11,835
Oh, shit!
Oops.

555
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:07,108
Nice goose!

556
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:14,831
Have we had a visitor, Cesar?

557
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,635
Jonathan, you bloody little jenius!

558
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,797
You did it! You did it!

559
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:40,838
Are you with us, Jonathan?

560
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:30,435
- Jonathan?
- "Deck the hall with bells of holly,
tra-la-la-la-la, la-la, la-la."

561
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:35,516
Hello, Beth. You put your tree
out early this year?

562
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:38,478
At least you don't have to
eat with your fingers anymore.

563
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:39,995
What is the matter with you?

564
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:43,796
Are you completely insane?
What more do you want from us?

565
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,551
Oh, the holiday in Tahiti. The house in the country.

566
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:52,393
But for the moment, I'd be content with the BMW.
Where's Jonathan?

567
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:09,700
ROLAND COPPING:
Afternoon, nurse!

568
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:48,070
Hello?

569
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:57,700
Excuse me?

570
01:05:04,270 --> 01:05:05,550
Hello?

571
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:03,956
Metthew!

572
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:18,955
Beth, hi, honey!
I'm home! Did you have a good day?

573
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:23,594
Oh yes, yes I did! Two police turned up
with their crossbow,

574
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:26,558
and your silverware was hung
out to dry on a Christmas tree!

575
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,831
Jesus, what happened to you?

576
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:34,912
- And why weren't you at the office?
Where the hell have you been?
- I've been on a little field trip.

577
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:41,350
And if I do say so myself, I think I've struck gold.
Everyone's got an Achilles heel.

578
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:44,716
- And Roland Copping's got a whopper.
- Did you hear me?

579
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:45,750
Hello?

580
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:48,350
He sent the police over this afternoon!

581
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:52,398
He set us up. I almost got arrested!

582
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:55,077
And then I threw up on them.

583
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:57,635
Good girl!

584
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:03,795
I should have thought about this earlier.
The first day he came in here, he gave us
his card, which said please call home.

585
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:09,634
He doesn't have an office. He only works
from home. It was like an invitation, and it's
there. It's all there.

586
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:12,399
Where's the mobile phone?

587
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:17,191
Listen to you. You sound like a madman.
What the hell is going on?

588
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:20,397
I don't have time to explain.
I'll tell you everything when I'm set up.

589
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,311
Jonathan, tell me now!

590
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:27,195
I found a hole, Beth. A hole.

591
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:31,397
I went there today, to his house.
I followed him.

592
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:37,435
There might be a way out. There's a chance
that we can turn the tables, but we have to play him
at his own game.

593
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,478
That's it, isn't it?

594
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:56,397
Whether it's playing
with toy soldiers

595
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:59,629
or ripping off insurance companies,

596
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:04,792
it's all just a game?

597
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:08,470
Yes.

598
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:14,232
But it's his game, and at
the moment, we're losing.

599
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,353
Get out of my way.

600
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:22,557
- One elephant, two elephants, three elephants...
- Stop it!
- four...

601
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:24,639
I've had enough!

602
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,592
I don't want to play anymore.

603
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:30,870
So.

604
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:32,559
What are the options?

605
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:37,112
We can go to the police and maybe
spend, what, the next 10 years in jail,

606
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:40,272
or we can give him everything and
let him suck us completely dry,

607
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:42,388
or we can fight.

608
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:45,151
We play or we pay.

609
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:50,715
And I can win. Just 48 hours, that's all I need.
Just two days and this whole thing will be over.

610
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:54,636
Two days, huh?

611
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:58,353
Two days to win this one and it will all be over?

612
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,030
Oh, really?

613
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,835
And then what? What happens next?

614
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:07,436
Another insurance claim?
Or is that too small now?

615
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:10,838
How about insider trading?
Does that sound attractive?

616
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,831
Where does it stop, Jonathan?

617
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,115
Please.

618
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:19,636
I can't do this on my own.

619
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:31,868
Hello, Roland.

620
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:34,909
Jonathan?

621
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,156
I've always had a soft spot
for German craftsmanship.

622
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,474
Fear not. She'll have a good, safe home.

623
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:53,076
Oh, I took out a cover note this morning,
just in case you decided to cancel the insurance.

624
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,316
Last chance, Jonathan.

625
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:50,193
- Roland Copping.

626
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:52,713
- We have to talk.

627
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:54,833
- Is that you, Beth?
- Yes.

628
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:58,996
- Fine. Well, when would you like to get together?
- How about tonight?

629
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:01,075
- Tonight?

630
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,068
- Is that a problem?

631
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:04,556
- No.

632
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:06,589
- It's not a problem.

633
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:09,513
- It's not a problem at all.

634
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,272
See you next year, Mr. Copping.

635
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:47,393
I really am very pleased
you came to my party, Beth.

636
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:50,957
Is anybody else coming?

637
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:53,156
No.

638
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:58,356
I know you didn't know it was my birthday,
so I don't expect a present.

639
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:00,993
But I would like to give you one.

640
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:32,275
If you really want to give us a present,

641
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:35,112
stop what you're doing.

642
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:37,792
My life is falling apart.

643
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:41,353
My husband thinks it's all
some kind of weird game.

644
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,432
So here's the deal.

645
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,313
You can have the house.

646
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:53,389
You can have the car. You can have everything.
I don't want it anymore.

647
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:55,229
And in return...

648
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:58,157
You let us go.

649
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,956
I wish it were that simple.

650
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:03,599
But the choice isn't mine.

651
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:09,395
You know, choice is a wonderful thing,
but too much of it can lead to hesitation.

652
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:13,518
And he who hesitates
loses his parking space.

653
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:17,318
So you have to find that middle ground.

654
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:20,909
And I've found 6.

655
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:23,435
Oh, for God's sake!

656
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:25,509
Cut it out!

657
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:26,835
I can't.

658
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:28,589
Well, I can.

659
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:32,068
You can't hurt me anymore, Roland.

660
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:35,313
You can't take anything
more away from me.

661
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,119
Because I have... nothing...

662
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:41,117
left to give you.

663
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:45,118
I don't care what number your
goddamn dice rolls because I

664
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,630
don't give a shit anymore!

665
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,877
Happy birthday, Roland.

666
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:55,070
And in a really weird way...

667
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:57,589
Thank you.

668
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,039
Where are you going?

669
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:15,510
4 to 6 and I call Jonathan.

670
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:30,233
- Beth, have you got them?
- Yes.

671
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:33,677
- I have them.
- Good girl!

672
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,436
- Where are you?
- I'm in a phone booth.

673
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:39,279
OK, now go, get out of there,
as quick as you can.

674
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:40,556
Right.

675
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:41,630
Hey.

676
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:44,074
Love you.

677
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:47,915
Wait.

678
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:57,837
Give me back my dice.

679
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:02,669
[MUMBLED] Jonathan!

680
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:06,954
What's the matter? Aren't you at your sisters?

681
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:10,755
No, she's at her favorite uncle's.
Hello, John-John.

682
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:14,993
Roland, where's Beth?

683
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:19,793
Oh, I'm sure she'd love to speak to you,
but she's a little bit tied up at the moment.

684
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:22,917
As to her whereabouts, I think
you'll find her at my house.

685
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:28,351
And I'd get over here pretty quickly, if I were you,
before she gets added to one of my collections.

686
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:31,113
She's got nothing to do with it, Roland!
Leave her out of it!

687
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:33,596
Oh, but she's been stealing, Jonathan.

688
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:37,158
And all little girls who steal
deserve a good spanking.

689
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:42,793
I gather you're up to something.
Where, may I ask, are you?

690
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:46,676
Over here.

691
01:15:58,480 --> 01:15:59,708
Good evening, Jonathan.

692
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:13,676
Beth!

693
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,756
Here, pass you a piece of watermelon.

694
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:23,236
Beth!

695
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:30,677
Another step closer and she
never rides a bike again.

696
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:34,957
Very, very clever, Johnny.

697
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:39,519
But you've really overstepped
your mark this time.

698
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:41,233
You wouldn't dare.

699
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:43,189
Oh, wouldn't I?

700
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:47,115
No doubt about it, you're very good.

701
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:49,951
Probably the best yet.

702
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:54,677
But you've got to think ahead.
You've got to learn three-dimensional thinking.

703
01:16:58,360 --> 01:16:59,509
3, 3, 3.

704
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:02,789
3, 3, 3.

705
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:05,396
3?

706
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:10,392
That's right, your home number.
If I dial the last three,

707
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:13,191
the phone will ring, correct?

708
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:14,950
Yes.

709
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:17,279
Let's go for a walk.

710
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:19,598
I want to show you something.

711
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:22,715
No tricks.

712
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,793
You've got the gun.

713
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:28,794
Just come and take a look at something.

714
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:32,396
Come on.

715
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,113
Indulge me.

716
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:37,316
OK.

717
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:40,429
But remember, the future halves
of your wife are at stake.

718
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:43,872
But remember, the future halves
of your wife are at stake.

719
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:57,315
- What are you up to?
- A surprise. You like surprises, don't you?

720
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,919
Very much.
You had me a little worried.

721
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:03,914
You worked a little quicker than I had anticipated.
I might have had you over a barrel.

722
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:09,589
You shouldn't have relied on your wife. Women are
inconsistent. That's why I never married.

723
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:15,474
Do this, do that. I just avoided the problem. Surely you understand
that, Jonathan.

724
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:19,552
The perfect bachelor,
with a life devoted to...

725
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:24,756
Matthew?

726
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:27,036
Matthew?

727
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:31,592
Oh my god, Matthew! What have they done to you?
No worries, Matthew.

728
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:35,673
All I have to do is to press the redial button, the phone
will ring, set off the answering machine, and - smash! -

729
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:40,709
Matthew has to swim. Again.
I'm serious, Roland.

730
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,355
You... bastard!

731
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:00,273
Flattery will get you nowhere.

732
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:05,349
Let's go upstairs.

733
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:10,556
Come on.

734
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:18,995
How could you?

735
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:22,956
He's a quadriplegic.
He can't even speak.

736
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:25,350
Oh really?

737
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:29,077
I'd thought he had a lot to say.

738
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:34,956
He told me all about your father, the war hero,
the man who died in action...

739
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:37,600
Or was it just the man who didn't
want to come home?

740
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:40,355
He told me all about his
present state of health.

741
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:45,193
Achieved whilst trying to humor his brother
with the roll of a silly, little dice.

742
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:50,470
And the dice, given as an afterthought to a
spoiled, unpopular, little brat

743
01:19:50,530 --> 01:19:53,190
because nobody turned up to his party.

744
01:19:57,640 --> 01:19:58,868
So what happens now?

745
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,151
I'll tell you what we're going to do.

746
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:05,999
We're going to roll for it.

747
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:09,072
Numbers 1, 3, and 5

748
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:11,273
Beth and I walk away from here.

749
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:13,354
2, 4, and 6?..

750
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:18,797
50/50 odds. That's quite a gamble, Jonathan.

751
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:22,673
I'm prepared to take it.

752
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:32,710
You roll.

753
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:51,715
Bad luck, Roland.

754
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:54,669
You lose.

755
01:20:58,320 --> 01:20:59,275
Like hell I did.

756
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:08,991
So long, Beth. It's been a pleasure having you.

757
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:13,350
Beth!

758
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:40,113
Surprise.

759
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:43,077
You vicious son of a bitch.

760
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:54,789
This is for me.

761
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:56,756
And this is

762
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:58,833
And this is for my brother!

763
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:29,916
Matthew!

764
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:31,556
Matthew!

765
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:33,439
Matthew!

766
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,035
Help!

767
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:57,755
Help!

768
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:06,716
Beth?

769
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:10,190
What are you doing?

770
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:15,232
I'm calling the police.

771
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,949
- No!
- I'm calling the police!

772
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:25,749
It's over.

773
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:31,475
Help!
