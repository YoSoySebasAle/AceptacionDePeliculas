1
00:01:04,437 --> 00:01:06,156
Lizzie Borden...
Violette Noziére...

2
00:01:06,277 --> 00:01:12,156
Ulrike Meinhof... Kim
Gordon... Patty Hearst...

3
00:01:12,277 --> 00:01:14,156
Camille Henrot...

4
00:01:17,956 --> 00:01:21,356
Bernadine Dohrn, Aileen Wuornos,

5
00:01:21,437 --> 00:01:24,356
Angela Davis, Jennifer Urmila.

6
00:01:27,116 --> 00:01:31,516
Jeanne Manning...

7
00:01:31,637 --> 00:01:35,516
Winona Rider, Winona Rider!

8
00:01:40,116 --> 00:01:43,677
Those are the real revolutionaries...

9
00:01:43,796 --> 00:01:45,677
Oh fuck...

10
00:01:45,796 --> 00:01:48,197
-Winona Rider.

11
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:51,716
Shoplifting is always revolutionary.

12
00:01:51,796 --> 00:01:53,357
Oh my God...

13
00:01:57,156 --> 00:01:58,716
I'd better go.

14
00:01:58,796 --> 00:02:01,877
I have to make dinner for Marie.
- Okay.

15
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:04,557
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay, bye.

16
00:02:06,997 --> 00:02:08,557
Did I say Gudrun Ensslin?

17
00:04:25,876 --> 00:04:27,717
Marie?

18
00:05:41,637 --> 00:05:44,517
Lake? Are you there?

19
00:05:45,756 --> 00:05:47,357
Lake?

20
00:05:51,596 --> 00:05:55,716
You and your books. Aren't
they supposed to be obsolete?

21
00:05:59,316 --> 00:06:00,876
What do you want?

22
00:06:00,996 --> 00:06:02,556
How was work?

23
00:06:07,276 --> 00:06:09,036
Thanks for cleaning up.

24
00:06:09,957 --> 00:06:13,556
I fixed you something,
it's in the fridge, nuke it 3 minutes.

25
00:07:09,716 --> 00:07:11,276
Pull him out. This way.

26
00:08:14,117 --> 00:08:16,357
I don't want to be a lifeguard.

27
00:08:16,436 --> 00:08:18,837
It was my stupid idea
in the first place.

28
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,517
-What are you going
to do for money?

29
00:08:21,637 --> 00:08:24,876
-Everyone is always
so worried about money.

30
00:08:24,957 --> 00:08:26,677
-I think this is just
our gap year anyway.

31
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:29,197
-For me, it's going to be
a permanent gap. I'll never

32
00:08:29,316 --> 00:08:31,716
be able to afford tuition.

33
00:08:31,797 --> 00:08:35,036
-You can always get
out of town together.

34
00:08:35,156 --> 00:08:37,556
-Are you serious?

35
00:08:37,637 --> 00:08:39,357
-Always.

36
00:08:42,876 --> 00:08:44,436
Shit...

37
00:08:50,996 --> 00:08:55,036
Looking pretty rough, Marie.
- Gee, thanks.

38
00:08:55,156 --> 00:08:57,397
Hi Desiree!
- Hi!

39
00:08:57,477 --> 00:09:00,717
- How did you get all banged up?
- I had a little dispute

40
00:09:00,837 --> 00:09:03,077
with a dancer at the club.

41
00:09:03,157 --> 00:09:06,717
She wasn't sharing hertips.

42
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:09,077
-What's your degree, I still don't
get why you can't find

43
00:09:09,101 --> 00:09:10,556
a better job.
- Lake, stop.

44
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:13,916
-It's not that easy, Lake.

45
00:09:13,996 --> 00:09:16,556
-Woman in the nigger
of the world.

46
00:09:20,197 --> 00:09:22,397
What?

47
00:09:22,517 --> 00:09:26,277
Yoko Ono.
- She's right.

48
00:09:26,397 --> 00:09:29,597
Anyway smartie, a gentleman
I used to know when I was

49
00:09:29,676 --> 00:09:31,916
in college came into the club
the other night and offered

50
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,597
me a position.
- Where?

51
00:09:35,717 --> 00:09:39,436
- At an assisted living facility.
- You mean an old folks home?

52
00:09:41,556 --> 00:09:43,957
Who knows? If things work out,
I might even be able

53
00:09:44,037 --> 00:09:48,756
to get you a job there.
- At an old folks home...

54
00:10:11,356 --> 00:10:13,116
Disgusting!

55
00:10:31,876 --> 00:10:34,717
You were supposed to be
finished bed pans an hour ago.

56
00:10:34,837 --> 00:10:37,876
-Sorry, I got involved
in a pretty heated game

57
00:10:37,996 --> 00:10:39,556
of Chinese checkers.
- It's not your job

58
00:10:39,676 --> 00:10:42,556
to fraternize with patients. Anyway,
your mother wants

59
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:45,236
to see you in the office. Now.

60
00:10:53,356 --> 00:10:54,916
I have to see Lake
and get back to work.

61
00:10:54,996 --> 00:10:57,077
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

62
00:11:01,356 --> 00:11:04,236
Alright...
- Hi mom!

63
00:11:04,356 --> 00:11:08,277
- Lake, can't you knock first?
- Mom, I didn't know you'd be

64
00:11:08,356 --> 00:11:11,277
in a meeting.
- I told you not to call me

65
00:11:11,356 --> 00:11:17,116
mom at work. Say hello
to Mister Nelson.

66
00:11:17,197 --> 00:11:18,756
-Hello...

67
00:11:18,876 --> 00:11:22,277
-Look, he got me these for
the car. Aren't they nice?

68
00:11:25,556 --> 00:11:29,277
Hey, how are you getting
along at the wrinkle ranch?

69
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:33,957
- The wrinkle ranch, really?
- Oh well now son, let's...

70
00:11:34,037 --> 00:11:37,277
Let's not get off on the wrong foot.
I want all the employees

71
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:39,957
here at Coup de Coeur to feel
like part of the family.

72
00:11:42,236 --> 00:11:43,957
Can I go now?

73
00:12:00,597 --> 00:12:04,996
Who are you?
- I'm Lake. I've been asked

74
00:12:05,077 --> 00:12:09,037
to give you...
To help you clean up.

75
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:01,236
Are you ready for your
afternoon medication?

76
00:15:02,996 --> 00:15:04,717
Here we go.

77
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:07,277
Oh, that's the way
it's going to be.

78
00:15:07,356 --> 00:15:10,876
Okay then...

79
00:15:10,996 --> 00:15:12,717
open up.

80
00:15:12,837 --> 00:15:17,397
You can do this, come on.
Come on Mister Peabody, open up.

81
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:25,517
Fine... That's it. Very good.
Take the glass of water now.

82
00:15:26,037 --> 00:15:27,756
I know...

83
00:15:30,157 --> 00:15:33,436
Very good. Very good.

84
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:37,597
Boy, there are bed pans that
need to be sterilized.

85
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:42,436
Take your chariot
and come with me. Now!

86
00:15:42,517 --> 00:15:45,916
-The clarion call
of Coup de Coeur.

87
00:15:46,037 --> 00:15:49,116
Bed pans...

88
00:15:49,197 --> 00:15:51,717
-I'll see you
around, M. Peabody.

89
00:15:51,796 --> 00:15:54,436
-See you where ever you are.

90
00:16:01,556 --> 00:16:03,116
What kind of medication
is he on?

91
00:16:03,236 --> 00:16:05,796
-It's none of your business.

92
00:16:05,876 --> 00:16:07,957
-It must be pretty
strong, he seems...

93
00:16:08,077 --> 00:16:10,957
-M. Peabody is
a very sick old man.

94
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,957
Are you giving him
psychotropic drugs?

95
00:16:15,077 --> 00:16:17,637
-Where did you learn that word?
In the school yard?

96
00:16:17,717 --> 00:16:19,637
Boy, you don't know what
you're talking about.

97
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,157
Hey!

98
00:16:43,597 --> 00:16:45,316
Hey!

99
00:16:45,436 --> 00:16:48,157
- You're new.
- Yeah.

100
00:16:48,277 --> 00:16:51,316
What about you?
- I've been here a few months.

101
00:16:51,436 --> 00:16:56,517
It's pretty disgusting.
Old geezers pissing all over

102
00:16:56,597 --> 00:17:00,157
themselves.

103
00:17:00,277 --> 00:17:02,197
-It doesn't bother me.

104
00:17:03,957 --> 00:17:05,517
Let's be friends.

105
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:09,197
Sure.

106
00:17:35,796 --> 00:17:37,837
And then she waved...

107
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:39,717
-Yeah, not bad.

108
00:17:39,837 --> 00:17:43,357
-Well I think she's great.

109
00:17:43,436 --> 00:17:44,997
-She's alright.

110
00:17:49,477 --> 00:17:51,877
So tell me about the old men.

111
00:17:51,997 --> 00:17:56,717
- I gave one a sponge bath.
- Was it gross?

112
00:17:56,837 --> 00:17:59,676
-Not really.
Somebody has to do it.

113
00:17:59,757 --> 00:18:04,556
-You're amazing.
You're always taking care of other people.

114
00:18:04,676 --> 00:18:07,077
- What do you mean?
- I don't know, you're always

115
00:18:07,197 --> 00:18:10,757
picking up after Marie and
you like giving old men sponge

116
00:18:10,837 --> 00:18:14,396
baths.
- I didn't say I liked it.

117
00:18:28,036 --> 00:18:31,597
You see what I mean?

118
00:18:31,717 --> 00:18:34,117
You're such a saint.

119
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:35,916
-I'm not a saint.

120
00:18:40,717 --> 00:18:43,436
Oh my God! That's blood.

121
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:46,597
- What?
- The blood of a saint.

122
00:18:46,717 --> 00:18:49,396
- I'm not a saint.
- But you are.

123
00:18:49,516 --> 00:18:52,796
-I'm the revolutionary
and you are the saint.

124
00:18:52,877 --> 00:18:55,276
-What makes you think
you're so revolutionary?

125
00:18:55,357 --> 00:18:58,436
You couldn't even
make your own list.

126
00:18:58,516 --> 00:19:01,276
- Hey, are you okay?
- Oh, of course!

127
00:19:01,396 --> 00:19:03,316
-Have you heard
the show tonight?

128
00:19:03,396 --> 00:19:05,117
-Totally!

129
00:19:05,237 --> 00:19:08,477
Oh, this is Lake.
- Hi.

130
00:19:08,556 --> 00:19:11,477
- What happened to you?
- Oh actually that's nothing.

131
00:19:11,556 --> 00:19:14,316
That is just a little bit
of stigmata because Lake's

132
00:19:14,396 --> 00:19:17,477
an actual saint.
- Ah, that's all.

133
00:19:17,597 --> 00:19:21,156
-No really, he's like
an actual saint. Saint Lake.

134
00:19:21,237 --> 00:19:23,316
- Desiree?
- Okay I've got to get back

135
00:19:23,477 --> 00:19:24,997
to my band.
- Okay, see you later.

136
00:19:26,757 --> 00:19:28,316
It was nice to meet you.

137
00:19:52,117 --> 00:19:54,837
M. Peabody!
- M. Peabody!

138
00:19:54,957 --> 00:19:57,516
-Come back! M. Peabody!

139
00:20:00,436 --> 00:20:02,196
What is he doing?
- Oh he's done this before.

140
00:20:02,276 --> 00:20:04,676
He says he needs
to get to the ocean.

141
00:20:04,757 --> 00:20:07,477
He's totally delirious.

142
00:22:54,636 --> 00:22:57,516
Tada!

143
00:22:57,636 --> 00:22:59,436
-This is definitely
better than your last job.

144
00:22:59,477 --> 00:23:02,676
-No kidding! Naomie Klein is doing
a signing here next week

145
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:05,197
and I am in charge
of setting it up.

146
00:23:05,316 --> 00:23:09,237
- She's on your list?
- I cannot believe it.

147
00:23:09,357 --> 00:23:11,796
-Are you going to ask Naomie
about the cover of No Logo?

148
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:14,396
-What about it?

149
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:18,036
-It's become so iconic, it's like a logo.
I wonder how

150
00:23:18,156 --> 00:23:21,396
she feels about that.
- I don't know,

151
00:23:21,477 --> 00:23:23,237
ask her yourself.

152
00:23:24,396 --> 00:23:28,117
Desiree, I'd like
to show you something.

153
00:23:28,237 --> 00:23:30,117
- Okay.
- Are you with a customer?

154
00:23:30,237 --> 00:23:32,518
-No, actually, this gentleman
found everything that he was

155
00:23:32,542 --> 00:23:34,796
looking for. So...
- Excellent. I could really

156
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:37,117
use your help.
- Okay, cool.

157
00:23:48,796 --> 00:23:52,396
The new Atwood? Get out!
She's on my list too.

158
00:23:52,676 --> 00:23:56,916
Your list?
- Never mind.

159
00:23:57,036 --> 00:24:00,597
-It's an advanced copy,
I thought you'd like it.

160
00:24:00,717 --> 00:24:02,237
-I love it.

161
00:24:06,197 --> 00:24:10,276
Um, Desiree, are you
busy on Friday night?

162
00:24:10,357 --> 00:24:12,156
-Why? Do you want me
to pick up a shift?

163
00:24:12,237 --> 00:24:15,117
-Um, no I um...

164
00:24:15,197 --> 00:24:17,757
I'm asking you over for dinner.

165
00:24:24,717 --> 00:24:26,276
Ah yeah.

166
00:24:26,396 --> 00:24:28,636
Yeah, I'm free.

167
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:31,957
-Excellent. Great.

168
00:25:04,077 --> 00:25:06,997
He's been moved to room 219.
His son called and had him

169
00:25:07,117 --> 00:25:09,877
upgraded to a private room.
- His son?

170
00:25:09,997 --> 00:25:13,077
Nobody told me?
- Right, next time we'll make

171
00:25:13,156 --> 00:25:14,916
sure to consult you first.

172
00:25:25,877 --> 00:25:31,117
What's this game called again?
It seems pretty easy.

173
00:25:31,237 --> 00:25:34,276
-Beginners always say that.

174
00:25:35,597 --> 00:25:40,477
It's called Gin Rummy.
- Why is it called that?

175
00:25:40,597 --> 00:25:45,156
-Apparently the game's inventor
had a preference for gin.

176
00:25:45,276 --> 00:25:47,516
And it became known as Movie Star Gin
in the 30's, it was

177
00:25:47,597 --> 00:25:50,997
the Hollywood elite past time between
takes on movies sets

178
00:25:51,117 --> 00:25:53,516
with a quick game.

179
00:25:53,597 --> 00:25:56,037
- That's really interesting.
- When you've been around as long

180
00:25:56,117 --> 00:25:58,516
as I have my dear, you learn
a thing or two about even

181
00:25:58,597 --> 00:26:01,676
the most trivial of pursuits.

182
00:26:04,117 --> 00:26:07,036
Gin.

183
00:26:07,117 --> 00:26:09,837
- Do you play poker?
- I've been known to win a hand

184
00:26:09,957 --> 00:26:12,676
or two. We must play sometime.
- Are you ready for your

185
00:26:12,796 --> 00:26:14,357
afternoon medication?

186
00:26:16,477 --> 00:26:18,197
It's time.

187
00:26:18,316 --> 00:26:20,197
-We are kind
in the middle of something.

188
00:26:20,316 --> 00:26:22,316
-If you would just leave
them, I promise, I'll take

189
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:26,237
them in a little while.
- It's more effective

190
00:26:26,357 --> 00:26:28,156
if you take them on schedule.

191
00:26:28,237 --> 00:26:34,036
- Like the trains in Germany.
- Oh you devil.

192
00:26:34,156 --> 00:26:35,877
-Excuse me.

193
00:26:38,837 --> 00:26:41,396
Not again M. Abernati!

194
00:26:41,477 --> 00:26:46,717
-Don't worry, I'll make
sure he takes them.

195
00:26:46,837 --> 00:26:48,396
-You're sure?

196
00:26:50,837 --> 00:26:54,877
Alright, but don't forget.

197
00:27:03,357 --> 00:27:04,916
Give me these pills.

198
00:27:15,036 --> 00:27:19,916
We wouldn't want you
to have an unfair advantage.

199
00:27:20,036 --> 00:27:22,156
-There's a photo in that top drawer,
would you hand it

200
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,300
to me, please.

201
00:27:38,036 --> 00:27:45,436
Look at him. So smooth like the
cactus liked off his whiskers.

202
00:27:47,717 --> 00:27:49,796
And that's me.

203
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:54,316
I was in rather good
shape don't you think?

204
00:27:54,396 --> 00:27:56,957
-I guess so.

205
00:27:57,077 --> 00:27:58,636
I like the way you look now.

206
00:28:00,556 --> 00:28:02,957
When medication are you on?

207
00:28:13,237 --> 00:28:18,316
Anaïs Nin. There's a feminist you
don't want to fuck with.

208
00:28:18,436 --> 00:28:20,477
She's on my list.

209
00:28:20,597 --> 00:28:25,156
-What is this list you're
always talking about?

210
00:28:25,276 --> 00:28:27,477
-Private joke.

211
00:28:30,117 --> 00:28:33,516
Ouh! Alice Monroe. I love
Lives of Girls and Women.

212
00:28:36,597 --> 00:28:41,357
Margaret Laurence, Jest of God.
- What can I say, I love

213
00:28:41,436 --> 00:28:46,357
Canadian feminist writers.
- So, can I borrow these?

214
00:28:46,436 --> 00:28:51,516
-To tell you the truth,
I have a thing about lending

215
00:28:51,636 --> 00:28:54,837
my books, but you're welcome
to come over anytime you want

216
00:28:54,957 --> 00:28:57,676
to read.

217
00:28:57,796 --> 00:29:00,357
-Seriously.

218
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:10,197
Oh wow! SCUM Manifesto.

219
00:29:10,316 --> 00:29:12,556
-First edition.

220
00:29:14,316 --> 00:29:15,877
I'm impressed.

221
00:29:19,316 --> 00:29:21,357
But...

222
00:29:25,477 --> 00:29:28,237
Now, I might have to kill you.

223
00:29:28,316 --> 00:29:31,717
- Seriously?
- I'm not kidding.

224
00:29:36,676 --> 00:29:40,396
Your hair is nice.
- Thank you, so is yours.

225
00:33:19,997 --> 00:33:22,556
This band sounds like
The Pixies. Hut the good part

226
00:33:22,676 --> 00:33:24,717
of The Pixies, Kim Deal.

227
00:33:26,676 --> 00:33:30,717
Kelley is hotter.
- They're both hot.

228
00:33:30,837 --> 00:33:32,877
They're on my list.

229
00:33:43,516 --> 00:33:45,396
Don't be anal.

230
00:33:54,877 --> 00:33:56,396
I have to pee.

231
00:33:59,036 --> 00:34:00,757
Don't forget to wash your hands.

232
00:35:49,477 --> 00:35:51,037
Hit me.

233
00:35:51,156 --> 00:35:57,876
-Not just yet. First
we need another tip off.

234
00:36:20,156 --> 00:36:22,557
I hope we have enough
for Vermouth.

235
00:36:22,676 --> 00:36:27,916
- 'Muth', dear, 'muth'.
Remember just a tad.

236
00:36:38,037 --> 00:36:40,916
You don't want
to bruise the gin.

237
00:36:41,037 --> 00:36:45,237
Old men and gin
bruise so easily.

238
00:37:00,717 --> 00:37:02,596
M. Peabody, what's
going on in there?

239
00:37:12,557 --> 00:37:15,797
Are you both out of your minds?
- It was his idea.

240
00:37:15,876 --> 00:37:20,436
-Great. Pick up
your shoes. Let's go.

241
00:37:23,636 --> 00:37:25,796
Do you know what your mother
would say if she found out

242
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:29,156
about this?
- How will she find out?

243
00:37:29,237 --> 00:37:33,636
-What am I going to do with you?
Aille, aille, aille get dressed.

244
00:37:33,757 --> 00:37:35,477
Let's go.

245
00:37:37,237 --> 00:37:39,317
Come on, hurry up.

246
00:37:41,916 --> 00:37:43,636
Come on, come on.

247
00:37:48,277 --> 00:37:50,676
I really don't know what
I'm going to do with you.

248
00:38:03,757 --> 00:38:05,876
Sorry, I haven't been
around much lately.

249
00:38:05,957 --> 00:38:07,997
I've been working a lot.

250
00:38:10,277 --> 00:38:11,836
So have I.

251
00:38:19,116 --> 00:38:21,037
Are you sure there isn't
something else?

252
00:38:26,957 --> 00:38:28,876
Lake, tell me.

253
00:38:30,636 --> 00:38:32,517
You know that you can talk
to me about anything.

254
00:38:32,636 --> 00:38:34,517
-Are you sure about that?

255
00:38:45,317 --> 00:38:48,037
I think there might
be something wrong with me.

256
00:38:50,636 --> 00:38:52,396
I think I may have a...

257
00:38:55,156 --> 00:38:57,876
A fetish.

258
00:38:59,676 --> 00:39:02,876
You mean like leather?
- Not that bad.

259
00:39:10,156 --> 00:39:12,557
I saw your sketchbook.

260
00:39:14,356 --> 00:39:17,076
Is that what you're
talking about?

261
00:39:17,197 --> 00:39:20,076
Those drawings?

262
00:39:25,517 --> 00:39:27,916
Okay, this is like freaking
me out a little bit,

263
00:39:28,037 --> 00:39:31,757
so um... I have to give the car
back to my dad. Do you want me

264
00:39:31,876 --> 00:39:38,116
to drop you off?
- No, thanks. I think I'll walk.

265
00:39:54,237 --> 00:39:57,436
I'm not a saint.

266
00:42:46,116 --> 00:42:48,676
What's wrong with
you today, boy?

267
00:42:50,957 --> 00:42:53,197
I think I broke up
with my girlfriend.

268
00:42:57,317 --> 00:42:59,876
What was her name again?

269
00:42:59,957 --> 00:43:04,517
- Desiree.
- Ah yes, Desiree.

270
00:43:04,636 --> 00:43:09,717
-Such a poetic name,
the desired one.

271
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:14,037
Did I tell you that historically
she was the fiancée...

272
00:43:14,156 --> 00:43:17,396
-Of Napoléon, yeah, you told me.

273
00:43:21,156 --> 00:43:25,876
Would you like to talk about it?

274
00:43:25,997 --> 00:43:28,037
-No, that's okay.

275
00:43:38,836 --> 00:43:40,557
Melvin,

276
00:43:42,517 --> 00:43:44,076
Do you ever think
about the future?

277
00:43:51,836 --> 00:43:56,916
If you could go anywhere
in the world, where would you

278
00:43:57,037 --> 00:43:59,596
want to go?

279
00:43:59,676 --> 00:44:02,596
-I've always wanted to visit
the Pacific ocean again,

280
00:44:02,717 --> 00:44:06,436
but maybe that's a little
too pie in the sky.

281
00:44:06,517 --> 00:44:10,596
At this point, I'd settle
for some fresh air.

282
00:45:32,356 --> 00:45:33,916
Hey bro.

283
00:45:36,197 --> 00:45:37,916
There you go.

284
00:45:40,197 --> 00:45:42,076
Okay, that's good.

285
00:46:26,076 --> 00:46:27,636
Melvin?

286
00:46:38,076 --> 00:46:39,636
I'm going to get
you out of here.

287
00:47:38,116 --> 00:47:39,717
What did you do to him?

288
00:47:40,636 --> 00:47:43,116
Lake, have
a drink. What's wrong?

289
00:47:43,237 --> 00:47:44,997
-I'm talking about Melvin,
Mr. Peabody.

290
00:47:47,477 --> 00:47:49,717
You and this old man...

291
00:47:50,477 --> 00:47:52,557
it's just not right!
- I don't know what you're

292
00:47:52,676 --> 00:47:54,316
talking about.
- You know what I'm talking

293
00:47:54,396 --> 00:47:56,876
about. Everybody knows what
I'm talking about. It's disgusting.

294
00:47:57,676 --> 00:47:59,717
Didn't I raise you right?

295
00:47:59,836 --> 00:48:01,556
-Mom, you're drunk,
you're imagining things.

296
00:48:04,356 --> 00:48:06,396
Don't lie to your mother!

297
00:48:06,517 --> 00:48:08,916
Of course I'm drunk.

298
00:48:08,997 --> 00:48:12,237
My son is fucking
an 80 year old man!

299
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:15,237
-Mom, what's disgusting is how
those old men are being treated.

300
00:48:15,356 --> 00:48:17,757
It's like Night of the
Living Dead in that place.

301
00:48:17,836 --> 00:48:19,916
-Don't make excuses
about what you're doing.

302
00:48:21,876 --> 00:48:24,156
And don't walk away
while I'm talking to you.

303
00:48:43,037 --> 00:48:45,757
Lake, open the door!

304
00:48:47,237 --> 00:48:50,116
Lake, open the door now.

305
00:48:51,237 --> 00:48:52,957
- Where are you going?
- For a drive.

306
00:48:53,037 --> 00:48:54,957
-Not with my car, you're not.

307
00:48:58,237 --> 00:48:59,797
Give me the keys.

308
00:48:59,876 --> 00:49:02,116
Give me my goddamn keys!

309
00:49:02,237 --> 00:49:03,797
-You mean these?

310
00:49:21,916 --> 00:49:23,876
Mom!

311
00:49:23,997 --> 00:49:28,836
I'm sorry!

312
00:49:28,916 --> 00:49:31,156
I'm sorry!

313
00:49:44,277 --> 00:49:47,676
Forget about those, they're
the worst car accessory.

314
00:49:48,596 --> 00:49:51,997
You're taking away my dice.
I love those dice.

315
00:49:52,116 --> 00:49:54,076
-We're not going to have
anything from Mr. Nelson

316
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,660
in the car.

317
00:50:20,477 --> 00:50:24,356
Thanks Desiree.
I owe you big time.

318
00:50:24,477 --> 00:50:28,717
- Is Marie okay?
- She'll live.

319
00:50:43,517 --> 00:50:45,916
Okay Melvin.
- Lake, this is crazy.

320
00:50:45,997 --> 00:50:47,557
-Can you help me?

321
00:50:49,517 --> 00:50:53,557
His arm, his arm's on me, okay.
- The other arm, Melvin.

322
00:50:53,676 --> 00:50:55,717
Come on, the other arm.

323
00:50:55,836 --> 00:50:58,277
Okay.

324
00:50:58,396 --> 00:51:00,276
I'm going to go and check
if we can get through.

325
00:51:06,197 --> 00:51:07,916
All clear.

326
00:51:15,037 --> 00:51:19,277
This doesn't really feel like breaking out.
It's too easy.

327
00:51:22,876 --> 00:51:24,436
Shit...

328
00:51:33,197 --> 00:51:38,076
Who was that?
- That's a saint.

329
00:51:55,717 --> 00:51:57,596
Okay…

330
00:52:00,356 --> 00:52:05,757
Oh... God! Okay.

331
00:52:05,876 --> 00:52:07,797
You got him?

332
00:52:16,076 --> 00:52:18,797
Where are you taking him?
- He said he wants to see

333
00:52:18,876 --> 00:52:22,436
the Pacific ocean again
and something about a pie

334
00:52:22,636 --> 00:52:24,636
in the sky.

335
00:52:24,717 --> 00:52:27,797
-In this beater
you're taking him.

336
00:52:27,916 --> 00:52:31,477
-I just have to get him out
of here. It's like horror

337
00:52:31,557 --> 00:52:33,317
hospital in there, so...

338
00:52:33,396 --> 00:52:37,477
It doesn't matter where we are.
- Are you sure that's where

339
00:52:37,596 --> 00:52:42,477
you're going?
- Why else would I be doing it?

340
00:52:46,916 --> 00:52:49,356
-Okay, I've been thinking about
this a lot since the last time

341
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:54,477
I saw you. What I wanted
to tell you is um...

342
00:52:54,596 --> 00:53:00,317
I think that what you are doing
and what you are is really

343
00:53:00,436 --> 00:53:01,997
brave.

344
00:53:03,957 --> 00:53:06,238
And the fact that you're acting on it,
you know, like it's

345
00:53:06,277 --> 00:53:10,836
revolutionary. All these ideas
that people have about like

346
00:53:10,957 --> 00:53:15,356
aging and beauty and what makes
somebody desirable, you're

347
00:53:15,436 --> 00:53:20,517
going against that.
You're fighting against nature.

348
00:53:22,037 --> 00:53:24,436
And do you see how
radical that is?

349
00:53:28,717 --> 00:53:30,477
And what I also wanted
to tell you is that...

350
00:53:33,197 --> 00:53:34,757
If you were a girl,

351
00:53:37,356 --> 00:53:39,916
You'd be on my list.

352
00:53:40,037 --> 00:53:42,277
-Desiree...

353
00:53:42,396 --> 00:53:47,757
-But the fucked up part is
that what you are means

354
00:53:47,876 --> 00:53:52,957
that we can't be together anymore.
You know that right?

355
00:53:55,076 --> 00:53:56,957
I don't know what I am.

356
00:54:07,757 --> 00:54:10,277
My God, I wish we were
the ones escaping.

357
00:54:12,076 --> 00:54:15,477
I'll text you.

358
00:54:15,596 --> 00:54:17,116
-Okay, go.

359
00:54:17,237 --> 00:54:18,957
Go.

360
00:54:30,277 --> 00:54:32,317
I love you.

361
00:55:51,836 --> 00:55:53,396
Hey!

362
00:56:05,836 --> 00:56:08,396
Did you have any more
roommates after that?

363
00:56:08,517 --> 00:56:13,076
-Here and there.
I was even married once.

364
00:56:13,197 --> 00:56:15,237
If you can believe that.

365
00:56:15,356 --> 00:56:20,436
- Married? To a woman?
- At the time it was the only

366
00:56:20,517 --> 00:56:23,957
option. It was the 70's.

367
00:56:24,037 --> 00:56:26,436
Even in the theater world,
if you weren't married after

368
00:56:26,557 --> 00:56:31,116
the age of 40, there was
something wrong with you.

369
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:38,436
Were you in love with her?
- It was a kind of love.

370
00:56:38,557 --> 00:56:44,596
Miraculously, we even conceived
one drunken winter's night.

371
00:56:44,717 --> 00:56:46,957
Two years after our son was born,
she divorced me

372
00:56:47,076 --> 00:56:50,116
and took him away to another city.
From that point on,

373
00:56:50,237 --> 00:56:53,277
I was a confirmed bachelor.

374
00:59:24,396 --> 00:59:27,277
Good afternoon, young lady,
I wonder if you could direct

375
00:59:27,396 --> 00:59:30,636
me to the notions department.
- Notions, what's that?

376
00:59:30,717 --> 00:59:33,797
-My apologies, sowing kits,
needles, threads, that sort

377
00:59:33,876 --> 00:59:37,116
of thing. I'm afraid I've
lost a button on my jacket.

378
00:59:37,237 --> 00:59:41,317
-Yeah, it's down isle 4,
at the end on the bottom.

379
00:59:41,396 --> 00:59:44,317
-Ah, thank you. This is my grandson.
We're traveling

380
00:59:44,396 --> 00:59:47,477
across the country together.
- He's your grandson?

381
00:59:47,557 --> 00:59:52,797
-Yes. Although some days,
I really wish he weren't.

382
00:59:52,916 --> 00:59:56,477
He's quite the locker, isn't he?

383
00:59:56,596 --> 01:00:00,477
Well, I'll be right back.
You two, stay out of trouble.

384
01:00:00,596 --> 01:00:06,156
-Such a cute old man.
My own grandpa's mean as a snake.

385
01:00:06,277 --> 01:00:08,156
My parents put him into
some retirement home,

386
01:00:08,277 --> 01:00:11,477
Sunny Valley or something.
I don't blame them though,

387
01:00:11,596 --> 01:00:14,836
in his case elder abuse
would be entirely justified.

388
01:00:16,596 --> 01:00:20,317
Um, I need a map of Canada.
- Sure thing.

389
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:30,836
It's cute that you're
traveling with your grandpa.

390
01:00:30,957 --> 01:00:32,676
Where are you guys headed?

391
01:00:32,797 --> 01:00:36,676
- We haven't really decided.
- Are you staying in Ontario?

392
01:00:36,797 --> 01:00:38,517
-Yeah.

393
01:00:38,636 --> 01:00:41,356
-Maybe I can help you.

394
01:00:41,477 --> 01:00:44,037
When I was a kid, my family and I
used to go rent a cottage

395
01:00:44,116 --> 01:00:48,517
around here. It's really pretty,
there are a lot of lakes.

396
01:00:48,636 --> 01:00:51,116
- Are there a lot of people...
- Would you mind paying for this

397
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:57,380
dear boy, I left my wallet
in the car and don't forget

398
01:01:01,317 --> 01:01:03,557
I'll have cigarettes.

399
01:01:03,636 --> 01:01:05,396
Any brand.

400
01:01:09,876 --> 01:01:14,676
One of the few advantages
of being old: invisibility.

401
01:01:14,797 --> 01:01:16,797
- You're crazy.
- Am I?

402
01:01:16,916 --> 01:01:19,957
-We have to start planning for the future.
Money isn't going

403
01:01:20,076 --> 01:01:22,317
to hold out forever.

404
01:01:25,596 --> 01:01:27,957
Sun block?
- Who knows, we might end up

405
01:01:28,076 --> 01:01:30,116
in Palm Springs.

406
01:01:30,237 --> 01:01:33,797
-I already told you,
I like your wrinkles.

407
01:01:36,596 --> 01:01:38,156
I'm going to keep this.

408
01:01:39,916 --> 01:01:42,477
If people only knew
how you treat me.

409
01:02:17,636 --> 01:02:20,676
What did he want?
- That boy?

410
01:02:20,797 --> 01:02:24,197
He saw the map and he wanted
to know if I needed directions.

411
01:02:28,636 --> 01:02:36,636
So, we're here and we're
trying to get to... Here.

412
01:02:43,156 --> 01:02:45,276
To be honest, I'm not sure
I'm up for such a long trip

413
01:02:45,317 --> 01:02:48,557
so soon after Coup de Coeur.
That place really took

414
01:02:48,676 --> 01:02:52,557
the vinegar out of me.
- What are you saying?

415
01:02:52,676 --> 01:02:56,557
-What I'm saying is perhaps
we should rest for a few days

416
01:02:56,676 --> 01:02:58,876
before pressing on.

417
01:03:06,676 --> 01:03:08,676
You haven't been telling
anyone about us, have you?

418
01:03:08,757 --> 01:03:12,596
-Don't be silly,
they would never understand.

419
01:03:12,676 --> 01:03:14,916
-What about your son?

420
01:03:15,037 --> 01:03:19,596
-I wouldn't worry about my son.
He paid for the home,

421
01:03:19,676 --> 01:03:23,156
but he hasn't been
in touch for many years.

422
01:03:23,277 --> 01:03:27,916
He hasn't introduced me
to my own grandchildren.

423
01:03:28,037 --> 01:03:30,357
He never really got used to
the idea of having an old queen

424
01:03:30,381 --> 01:03:34,461
like me for a father.
It always embarrassed him.

425
01:03:41,557 --> 01:03:43,957
What were you talking
to that guy about?

426
01:03:44,037 --> 01:03:46,436
- What guy?
- At the dinner.

427
01:03:46,557 --> 01:03:48,156
You seemed to be talking a lot.

428
01:03:48,237 --> 01:03:52,436
- I already told you, directions.
- And why were you laughing?

429
01:03:52,557 --> 01:03:56,037
-I suppose I made a joke,
you know how I am.

430
01:03:56,156 --> 01:03:58,436
-It must have been pretty
funny then I guess.

431
01:03:58,557 --> 01:04:01,957
-What are you harping on this?

432
01:04:02,076 --> 01:04:04,477
Don't tell me you're jealous.

433
01:04:04,557 --> 01:04:07,477
Jealous of an old
sack of bones like me?

434
01:04:07,557 --> 01:04:09,637
-Because I asked you to be careful
about what you say

435
01:04:09,661 --> 01:04:12,797
to people. Learn to keep your mouth
shut in public and I don't

436
01:04:12,916 --> 01:04:15,636
have to be this way.
- I'd never thought I'd live

437
01:04:15,757 --> 01:04:17,317
to see the day...

438
01:04:17,396 --> 01:04:20,156
-I'm going for a walk.

439
01:04:28,757 --> 01:04:30,477
Are you coming?

440
01:04:41,573 --> 01:04:43,933
You look very nice tonight.
- I'll have you know I was quite

441
01:04:43,957 --> 01:04:46,356
the snappy dresser in my day.

442
01:04:52,436 --> 01:04:55,836
Two gin and tonics, please.
- I need to see some ID, love.

443
01:04:57,957 --> 01:05:01,676
Oh dear, I may have left
my wallet back in my room.

444
01:05:01,797 --> 01:05:05,876
- Are you serious?
- He's 81.

445
01:05:05,997 --> 01:05:09,517
-Not my rule. Everybody
has to have ID.

446
01:05:09,636 --> 01:05:11,356
-Here it is.

447
01:05:17,156 --> 01:05:19,237
Looks like you drinking
for free tonight.

448
01:05:19,356 --> 01:05:22,557
- What do you mean?
- It's his birthday.

449
01:05:22,636 --> 01:05:26,356
He's 82 years young.
- Let me see that.

450
01:05:30,836 --> 01:05:33,717
Why didn't you tell me?
- I don't know, I already feel

451
01:05:33,836 --> 01:05:37,116
like enough of a fossil.
I've never been one much

452
01:05:37,237 --> 01:05:40,557
for celebrating birthdays.
- What about you?

453
01:05:40,676 --> 01:05:42,876
- I love birthdays.
- No, man I need to see

454
01:05:42,997 --> 01:05:45,717
your ID.
- Oh sorry.

455
01:05:48,836 --> 01:05:52,396
I must have left it in
the car. I'll be right back.

456
01:06:08,197 --> 01:06:10,916
Gin and tonic,
love, happy birthday.

457
01:06:49,717 --> 01:06:51,477
I heard it's your birthday.

458
01:06:54,076 --> 01:06:55,636
Cheers.

459
01:06:58,396 --> 01:07:01,797
How old are you anyway?
- 75.

460
01:07:19,277 --> 01:07:21,477
This is my seat.

461
01:07:25,596 --> 01:07:27,836
Can you hold
this for me, please?

462
01:08:02,797 --> 01:08:04,717
Fucking hell!
- That's enough!

463
01:08:27,997 --> 01:08:32,557
That was supposed to be for you.
- I gathered that.

464
01:09:13,837 --> 01:09:15,397
Happy birthday, Melvin.

465
01:09:25,357 --> 01:09:30,437
That time of year thou
mayst in me behold,

466
01:09:30,516 --> 01:09:35,277
When yellow leaves, or none,
or few, do hang upon those

467
01:09:35,357 --> 01:09:40,437
boughs which shake against
the cold, bare ruined

468
01:09:40,516 --> 01:09:44,437
choirs, where late
the sweet birds sang.

469
01:09:44,556 --> 01:09:48,956
In me thou seest the
twilight of such day,

470
01:09:49,036 --> 01:09:53,277
As after sunset fadeth in
the west, which by and by

471
01:09:53,397 --> 01:09:57,956
black night doth take
away, death's second self,

472
01:09:58,036 --> 01:10:02,277
that seals up all in rest.

473
01:11:03,797 --> 01:11:06,757
You know, I have been thinking
about you said before and

474
01:11:06,837 --> 01:11:13,197
it's not just about the sex.
I really think I'm in love

475
01:11:13,277 --> 01:11:15,516
with you.

476
01:11:17,476 --> 01:11:20,717
I know it sounds crazy, but...

477
01:11:20,797 --> 01:11:22,516
That's how I feel.

478
01:11:28,156 --> 01:11:30,197
Did you hear what I said?

479
01:11:32,797 --> 01:11:34,556
Melvin?

480
01:11:38,116 --> 01:11:40,717
Melvin?

481
01:11:40,837 --> 01:11:43,036
Melvin!

482
01:11:47,837 --> 01:11:49,397
Melvin...

483
01:14:42,996 --> 01:14:47,757
That was a nice service.
- 5 people, including

484
01:14:47,837 --> 01:14:50,237
the organist.
- Yeah, that was sad.

485
01:14:51,996 --> 01:14:55,237
It's nice that his son came.
- I thought Marie was going

486
01:14:55,357 --> 01:14:58,397
to start making out with
him in front of the casket.

487
01:14:58,516 --> 01:15:01,917
- I love Marie.
- You know, if those two get

488
01:15:02,036 --> 01:15:05,757
together, that kind of makes
Melvin my grandfather.

489
01:15:05,877 --> 01:15:07,757
I mean retroactively.

490
01:15:09,877 --> 01:15:11,596
So you're okay?

491
01:15:11,717 --> 01:15:13,437
-I guess so.

492
01:15:17,197 --> 01:15:19,596
Oh, I forgot.

493
01:15:22,797 --> 01:15:26,956
Revolutionary...
- I got you one too.

494
01:15:27,036 --> 01:15:30,116
- What?
- Okay.

495
01:15:31,877 --> 01:15:35,277
No... Desiree.

496
01:15:44,717 --> 01:15:46,277
I love it.
- It's perfect.

497
01:15:54,556 --> 01:15:58,156
I'll text you, okay?
- Okay.

498
01:16:04,437 --> 01:16:06,837
Bye.
- Bye.

499
01:17:05,797 --> 01:17:07,556
Hi!

500
01:17:07,636 --> 01:17:09,717
I'm Lake.

501
01:17:09,837 --> 01:17:13,397
-Hi young man!

502
01:17:13,476 --> 01:17:17,853
- Are you here everyday?
- Most week days.

503
01:17:17,877 --> 01:17:19,877
-Maybe I'll see you around.
