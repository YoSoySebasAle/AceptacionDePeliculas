1
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,030
<i>Talk to me, Ray.</i>

2
00:00:39,048 --> 00:00:42,163
<i>Low on gas and almost
out of ammo, Johnny.</i>

3
00:00:42,187 --> 00:00:47,434
<i>God damn it. This isn't supposed
to be happening in this area.</i>

4
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:49,403
- Retreat! Let's go!
- Move it! Move it!

5
00:00:49,427 --> 00:00:52,189
To RP tango.

6
00:00:54,364 --> 00:00:56,744
Charlie company overrun.
Requesting firepower.

7
00:00:56,768 --> 00:00:59,947
<i>Can't hang around, pal. Gotta go home
and refuel, come back for them.</i>

8
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:03,416
<i>If we go, there'll be no one left
to come back for.</i>

9
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,602
- Move it! Move! Move!
- Retreat! Retreat!

10
00:01:20,501 --> 00:01:22,017
<i>We're hit!</i>

11
00:01:22,298 --> 00:01:26,386
<i>Mayday! Mayday! Dragonfly 2 going down!</i>

12
00:01:33,783 --> 00:01:38,747
Come on, Ray. Let's go. Come on, Ray.

13
00:01:38,885 --> 00:01:40,890
Come on, Ray, let's go!

14
00:01:50,803 --> 00:01:53,615
Move! Move!

15
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:56,079
On your knees.

16
00:03:00,705 --> 00:03:03,334
What's going on?

17
00:03:04,276 --> 00:03:07,175
Hey, you will not.

18
00:03:07,179 --> 00:03:11,526
No, you can't. No! No!

19
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,796
- No!
- You're all right, Ray. Just stay cool.

20
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,120
- Johnny, help me.
- You're all right.

21
00:03:19,528 --> 00:03:22,169
No! Ray!

22
00:04:13,415 --> 00:04:17,937
Here come the visa crew. Log 'em in.

23
00:04:17,986 --> 00:04:20,868
Murdock, Alvin.

24
00:04:21,156 --> 00:04:24,316
Purvell, Robert.

25
00:04:24,326 --> 00:04:28,330
Su, Joyce.

26
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,093
Rosenbaum, Naomi.

27
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,800
What the hell is that?

28
00:04:38,741 --> 00:04:41,831
That is Kate Abbott.

29
00:04:42,712 --> 00:04:45,713
The new security officer.

30
00:04:58,996 --> 00:05:01,896
VIP request. We need to process it.

31
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,776
Okay.

32
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,913
- Sorry, Sally.
- What's the rush, Sam?

33
00:05:05,937 --> 00:05:10,378
Security breach.
Everybody in the conference room in 10.

34
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:12,326
Nero Franks, Maltese national.

35
00:05:12,327 --> 00:05:14,805
Over the weekend, he tried to board
an Oceanic Airlines flight

36
00:05:14,813 --> 00:05:16,558
from Heathrow to Chicago.

37
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:18,827
Alarms went off when Franks
presented his passport.

38
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:22,430
It didn't have the new digital watermark.
Franks tried to run.

39
00:05:22,454 --> 00:05:25,823
MI5 thought he was a suicide
bomber and took him out. Take a look.

40
00:05:25,848 --> 00:05:28,236
Nero Franks was a
scientist with no priors,

41
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:29,823
working for a German chemical outfit.

42
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:32,273
His specialty was
combustible gas munitions.

43
00:05:32,297 --> 00:05:33,808
The Brits and the Germans
are still looking

44
00:05:33,832 --> 00:05:36,978
for a possible terrorist connection,
but no joy so far.

45
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:39,080
So here's the issue for us, people.

46
00:05:39,104 --> 00:05:41,482
Now our enemies know
they can't forge visas.

47
00:05:41,506 --> 00:05:43,918
That means they'll be looking
for ways to get real ones,

48
00:05:43,942 --> 00:05:45,520
the kind you hand out every day.

49
00:05:45,544 --> 00:05:49,357
We're working with all the British security
agencies,but they're stretched really thin.

50
00:05:49,381 --> 00:05:52,290
Budget cuts, plus they have
homegrown terrorists to worry about.

51
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,290
We're not saying that u hv
to give the 3rd degree.

52
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,868
90% of our applicants
are straightforward.

53
00:05:56,868 --> 00:06:00,682
It's the remaining 10%
that I lose sleep over.

54
00:06:00,682 --> 00:06:03,495
Any app that tweaks u the
wrong way,take it straight 2 Kate.

55
00:06:03,495 --> 00:06:05,373
She excelled at this work in Washington.

56
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:08,144
What Sam really means is
you'll need someone to blame

57
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:10,272
if the wrong guy gets through,
so use me.

58
00:06:10,396 --> 00:06:13,750
What I'm really interested in
is anyone with scientific expertise,

59
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:17,474
specialists in chemicals or gases.
Any questions?

60
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:20,129
All right, gang. Back to work.

61
00:06:29,506 --> 00:06:32,670
That's fine, madam.
Your visa will be ready tomorrow.

62
00:06:32,694 --> 00:06:35,506
She's never seen the ball drop
in Times Square on New Year's Eve.

63
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,474
Have a good stay
in the United States, sister.

64
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:39,298
Thank you, sir.

65
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,580
So do you promise to watch me
when I'm on <i>American idol?</i>

66
00:06:41,937 --> 00:06:44,596
Oh, absolutely.

67
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,417
What?

68
00:06:46,441 --> 00:06:50,642
- Have a good stay.
- Thank you very much. Bye-bye.

69
00:07:13,068 --> 00:07:16,352
Dr. Balan, good afternoon.

70
00:07:17,006 --> 00:07:20,128
I was told my paperwork is in order.

71
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,989
This won't take long.

72
00:07:23,013 --> 00:07:25,765
Romanian citizen.

73
00:07:29,352 --> 00:07:31,758
You have listed a medical conference
as the reason

74
00:07:31,782 --> 00:07:35,150
- for visiting the United States.
- Yes.

75
00:07:37,461 --> 00:07:40,881
This conference is for pediatricians.
You're a general practitioner.

76
00:07:41,505 --> 00:07:44,011
I work in a clinic
for newly arrived immigrants.

77
00:07:44,035 --> 00:07:47,448
Many of my patients are children.

78
00:07:47,472 --> 00:07:52,052
Dr. Balan, it also says that you consult
for Vicker's Pharmaceuticals.

79
00:07:52,076 --> 00:07:54,955
I'm curious why we don't have
a letter from them.

80
00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:56,223
I've only been there a few months.

81
00:07:56,247 --> 00:07:59,659
- Is there a problem?
- I certainly hope not.

82
00:07:59,683 --> 00:08:03,362
- Let me see this file.
- I'm not done with my review.

83
00:08:03,386 --> 00:08:04,946
A word.

84
00:08:13,665 --> 00:08:16,778
You don't think it's strange that a GP,
who also happens to be a researcher,

85
00:08:16,802 --> 00:08:18,547
wants to attend a pediatrics conference?

86
00:08:18,571 --> 00:08:21,984
There's nothing odd about moonlighting
as a consultant to make a few extra bucks.

87
00:08:22,008 --> 00:08:24,486
Besides, Naomi already did
the background check.

88
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,421
- Balan's fine.
- I'll be the judge of that.

89
00:08:26,445 --> 00:08:30,692
- Look, I know you were a high-flyer in D.C.
- I am not here on vacation.

90
00:08:30,716 --> 00:08:33,228
Even when it's slow, we're not
processing people fast enough.

91
00:08:33,252 --> 00:08:34,997
We're seriously understaffed.

92
00:08:35,021 --> 00:08:38,501
So when paperwork gets held up by security,
people start missing flights,

93
00:08:38,525 --> 00:08:40,836
and I'm the one that has to deal
with their complaints.

94
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,500
Unless you wanna suffer
the Ambassador's wrath.

95
00:08:42,695 --> 00:08:45,696
I'm doing my job, Bill.

96
00:08:46,098 --> 00:08:47,898
We all are.

97
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:03,292
We have a problem.
A new security expert.

98
00:09:03,316 --> 00:09:06,136
From Washington.

99
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:11,835
Her name is Kate Abbott.
She knows about Vicker's.

100
00:09:11,859 --> 00:09:14,312
So no visa?

101
00:09:14,336 --> 00:09:16,446
She's trouble, I'm telling you.

102
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,479
I'll take care of her.

103
00:09:37,686 --> 00:09:40,503
This way, please.

104
00:09:46,161 --> 00:09:51,179
- Sweet of you to stop in.
- There's something you need to see.

105
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,103
I'll have it done tomorrow.

106
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,726
Lisa.

107
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,495
- Hey.
- I'm so sorry.

108
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,431
It's okay. I saved us
a bottle of bubbles.

109
00:10:43,455 --> 00:10:45,539
Oh! You're the best.

110
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:47,901
So how did it go?

111
00:10:47,925 --> 00:10:52,002
Would you believe I sold every damn one?

112
00:10:50,826 --> 00:10:53,774
- No.
- Yes.

113
00:10:53,798 --> 00:10:55,762
But I saved those for you.

114
00:10:55,786 --> 00:10:58,813
I know you have a thing
for the underworld.

115
00:10:58,837 --> 00:11:01,478
Thank you.

116
00:11:01,502 --> 00:11:04,439
Oh, wow.

117
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:10,601
So all work and no play, huh?

118
00:11:12,585 --> 00:11:14,064
It's complicated.

119
00:11:14,586 --> 00:11:18,194
Is everything a state secret with you?

120
00:11:23,062 --> 00:11:26,342
It's so beautiful.

121
00:12:31,598 --> 00:12:34,746
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hi, Naomi. It's Kate.

122
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,814
I'm so sorry it's so late.

123
00:12:36,838 --> 00:12:39,284
<i>It's okay. Is something wrong?</i>

124
00:12:38,108 --> 00:12:41,254
You remember a guy
you processed a while ago,

125
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:46,182
Sri Lankan researcher
by the name of Fazli Sameer?

126
00:12:46,206 --> 00:12:52,260
<i>Uh, yeah, I was checking him out
when Bill pulled the file.</i>

127
00:12:52,874 --> 00:12:53,975
Why?

128
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:57,735
<i>He said I had too much on my plate,
and he'd handle it.</i>

129
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:03,005
Okay, all right. Thanks so much. Bye.

130
00:15:36,192 --> 00:15:39,906
Actually, Dr. Balan
did ask me for a reference.

131
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,215
Request slipped through the cracks.

132
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:44,577
I'll get my secretary
to draft one today.

133
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:48,380
Oh, would it be possible to see
Dr. Balan's security clearance?

134
00:15:48,404 --> 00:15:49,949
What's this really about?

135
00:15:49,973 --> 00:15:52,957
- I just thought since I was here, it'd be...
- About that.

136
00:15:53,576 --> 00:15:56,993
If you were even remotely familiar
with the British Defense Ministry's

137
00:15:57,017 --> 00:15:59,692
- standards on secrecy...
- We're on the same side here.

138
00:15:59,716 --> 00:16:03,701
You need to present a proper written
authorization from the Home Office

139
00:16:03,725 --> 00:16:06,599
to even inquire
about security clearances.

140
00:16:06,623 --> 00:16:10,667
- Dr. Perry, I...
- It's time for you to leave.

141
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,101
Get Inspector Anderson for me, please.

142
00:16:46,999 --> 00:16:49,946
- Hey, Howie.
- Hey, sweetie. What's up?

143
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:52,515
Listen, I need the list
of this month's visa files.

144
00:16:52,539 --> 00:16:53,977
Yeah.

145
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:01,680
There's no authorization.

146
00:17:01,948 --> 00:17:05,429
Oh, Parker probably forgot to call.

147
00:17:09,088 --> 00:17:10,963
Could you remind him?

148
00:17:10,987 --> 00:17:13,325
Yes. Oh.

149
00:17:14,161 --> 00:17:16,772
- Bye.
- Bye. Bye-bye.

150
00:17:16,796 --> 00:17:18,021
You wanted to see me?

151
00:17:18,045 --> 00:17:20,881
Miss Abbott. I believe you know
Inspector Paul Anderson

152
00:17:20,905 --> 00:17:23,823
- from Counter Terrorism command?
- Good morning.

153
00:17:23,837 --> 00:17:26,015
Why are you making inquiries
into the security status

154
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:28,485
of a British resident, Dr. Emil Balan?

155
00:17:28,509 --> 00:17:30,653
He applied for a visa to come
to the United States.

156
00:17:30,677 --> 00:17:34,657
So you took it upon yourself to go to
his workplace and interrogate his superior

157
00:17:34,681 --> 00:17:37,181
rather than contacting my office?

158
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:40,313
Dr. Balan needs his visa today.
I just thought it would be faster.

159
00:17:40,337 --> 00:17:45,119
- Not to go through proper channels?
- What's this about, Paul?

160
00:17:44,524 --> 00:17:46,770
The director, Perry,
contacted me personally

161
00:17:46,794 --> 00:17:51,275
to complain that Ms. Abbott had been
making unauthorized inquiries.

162
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:55,579
Then he called his friend,
the Home Secretary,

163
00:17:55,603 --> 00:18:00,164
who asked me
if you have issued the visa.

164
00:18:01,107 --> 00:18:03,909
No, I haven't.

165
00:18:04,043 --> 00:18:05,461
Is there a problem?

166
00:18:06,012 --> 00:18:07,924
Ambassador Crane.

167
00:18:07,948 --> 00:18:11,976
- Inspector. Sorry I'm late.
- I didn't know you were joining us.

168
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,032
I didn't either.
The Home Secretary just called.

169
00:18:15,056 --> 00:18:18,417
So what's the problem?

170
00:18:19,995 --> 00:18:22,878
I can't discuss the details
of an ongoing investigation.

171
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:26,678
We're talking about a medical professional
with serious political connections.

172
00:18:26,702 --> 00:18:30,344
Is this really a matter
of national security?

173
00:18:30,206 --> 00:18:31,668
Sam?

174
00:18:34,644 --> 00:18:38,606
It's her call. I'm standing by it.

175
00:18:39,182 --> 00:18:43,129
I'll inform the Home Secretary
accordingly.

176
00:18:43,153 --> 00:18:47,334
But let me tell you something about Balan
that you probably don't know.

177
00:18:47,358 --> 00:18:49,803
A few years ago,
his wife applied for a visa

178
00:18:49,827 --> 00:18:52,899
for emergency medical treatment
in the United States.

179
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:59,445
She died because some bureaucrat
kept asking for one more piece of paper.

180
00:18:59,469 --> 00:19:01,351
Under the circumstances,

181
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:07,207
you might consider showing her widower
a little compassion, Ms. Abbott.

182
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,383
Ambassador.

183
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:16,748
Congratulations. You're already making
enemies in high places.

184
00:19:16,772 --> 00:19:18,282
Keep it up.

185
00:19:18,306 --> 00:19:23,811
Sam, get control of this situation.

186
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,201
You okay?

187
00:19:37,015 --> 00:19:39,458
Yeah.

188
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:46,018
- Thanks for backing me up.
- You have great instincts, Kate.

189
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:58,458
Bill.

190
00:19:58,482 --> 00:20:01,281
- Can I talk to you for a sec?
- Sure.

191
00:20:03,219 --> 00:20:07,534
Sorry, Kate, I'll have to take this.
I'll meet you guys at the restaurant.

192
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:09,669
- All right, see you there.
- Okay. Gaston's, right?

193
00:20:09,693 --> 00:20:12,171
See you there.

194
00:20:15,064 --> 00:20:19,747
- <i>You need to do it now.</i>
- Okay, I understand.

195
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:45,095
Thanks, mate.

196
00:21:01,377 --> 00:21:03,058
- After you.
- Thanks.

197
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:16,320
I think this is our table.
Classy. Look at that bar.

198
00:21:23,652 --> 00:21:26,884
- Naomi, have you ever...
- This place is really nice.

199
00:21:26,908 --> 00:21:30,390
That bar looks amazing.

200
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:33,191
Bill's crazy about this place.

201
00:21:33,215 --> 00:21:35,627
What you told me last night
about Bill pulling that file...

202
00:21:35,651 --> 00:21:39,768
Kate, it's the guy's birthday party.
We're supposed to be having fun.

203
00:21:39,792 --> 00:21:42,791
Oh, um... he pre-ordered
the pressed duck for all of us.

204
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,637
- Okay.
- Um, we're six, please.

205
00:21:45,661 --> 00:21:48,200
Wait. Did anyone remember
to pick up the present for Bill?

206
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:51,076
- What? That was you.
- I'm pretty sure...

207
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,541
- Not playing a part of this.
- All right, guys, pony up.

208
00:21:57,205 --> 00:21:58,950
- Is this enough?
- I know.

209
00:21:58,974 --> 00:22:01,935
It's like we're here for the free food.

210
00:22:15,925 --> 00:22:18,086
Hi. I'm here to pick up a gift.

211
00:22:25,201 --> 00:22:28,315
- That's beautiful.
- Yes. It's a great choice.

212
00:22:28,339 --> 00:22:31,858
- I'll wrap it up for you.
- Thank you.

213
00:22:36,947 --> 00:22:40,188
What's taking Bill so long?

214
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:44,819
- All right, here comes the good part.
- What do you mean?

215
00:22:44,955 --> 00:22:46,403
Is that what we're eating?

216
00:22:54,231 --> 00:22:56,338
That's disgusting.

217
00:22:58,035 --> 00:22:59,977
Thank you.

218
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:57,500
Help.

219
00:24:00,297 --> 00:24:02,805
Naomi.

220
00:24:03,668 --> 00:24:06,887
Alvin! Joyce!

221
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:27,090
Help.

222
00:24:27,191 --> 00:24:29,414
There's someone hurt.

223
00:25:19,683 --> 00:25:21,964
Abbott's still alive.

224
00:25:22,385 --> 00:25:23,785
Where?

225
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:27,568
Following the Embassy survivor protocol.
That's what they're trained to do.

226
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:29,911
Make sure she doesn't survive.

227
00:25:35,633 --> 00:25:38,012
- What are you hearing, Sally?
- A restaurant blew.

228
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:42,072
- The place looks like a killing zone.
- Gas made the explosion?

229
00:25:42,096 --> 00:25:45,186
According to first responders'
radio chatter, it was a bomb.

230
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,421
I'm working on getting
security video feeds.

231
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:49,390
- Where was the hit?
- Just a few blocks away.

232
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:50,624
Do we have anyone in the area?

233
00:25:50,648 --> 00:25:53,427
The visa crew took Bill
to lunch at Gaston's.

234
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:55,660
Christ. Waring Lane.

235
00:26:07,497 --> 00:26:10,417
Oh, God.

236
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:15,853
- American Embassy.
- All right, sir.

237
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:22,424
- How long until this is fully out?
- Hours.

238
00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:24,849
How many?

239
00:26:25,451 --> 00:26:29,766
Four of yours, two waiters,
saleswoman from the glassware shop,

240
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,401
and five passersby.

241
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:34,336
And more than a dozen wounded.

242
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,140
The blast originated
where your people were seated.

243
00:26:37,164 --> 00:26:39,980
- Has anyone claimed responsibility?
- No.

244
00:26:40,004 --> 00:26:44,313
The bomb took out most of the security
cameras near the restaurant.

245
00:26:44,337 --> 00:26:48,239
Don't know how much
of the feed we'll recover.

246
00:26:48,475 --> 00:26:51,107
Is that all of 'em?

247
00:26:51,545 --> 00:26:54,292
We found this in the shop.

248
00:26:54,316 --> 00:26:57,196
Abbott must have been in there
when the bomb went off.

249
00:26:57,886 --> 00:26:59,606
Do you think she's dead?

250
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:03,412
We can't find her.

251
00:27:17,372 --> 00:27:20,686
Joyce, Robert, Alvin, Naomi,
they're all dead.

252
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,821
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

253
00:27:21,845 --> 00:27:24,056
Bill Talbot was supposed to be
at that restaurant.

254
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,458
He stayed behind
to take a secure link call.

255
00:27:26,482 --> 00:27:28,197
<i>If he was running late,
he should be somewhere</i>

256
00:27:28,221 --> 00:27:30,296
<i>between the Embassy and the restaurant.</i>

257
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,560
Get a lock on the trackers
on Bill and Kate's IDs right now.

258
00:27:34,623 --> 00:27:38,069
Okay. That was the search team.
There's still no sign of Abbott.

259
00:27:38,093 --> 00:27:39,838
So what do we know about her?

260
00:27:39,862 --> 00:27:43,442
Only child, born and raised in Montana,
parents are deceased.

261
00:27:43,466 --> 00:27:44,910
Stanford University.

262
00:27:43,734 --> 00:27:47,813
Then a two-year scholarship for graduate
studies at the University of London.

263
00:27:47,837 --> 00:27:49,716
She applied to the State Department,

264
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,652
scored high enough to get into
the Bureau of Diplomatic Security.

265
00:27:52,676 --> 00:27:56,039
She single-handedly unraveled a plot
to bomb the American Embassy in 20...

266
00:27:56,063 --> 00:27:59,059
Okay, so she knows the city
and she's good at her job.

267
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:00,260
Tell me something I don't know.

268
00:28:00,284 --> 00:28:03,930
Well, she's better than good.
London's considered a senior posting.

269
00:28:03,954 --> 00:28:07,901
She speaks four languages, three of them
being Russian, Arabic, and Mandarin.

270
00:28:07,925 --> 00:28:10,445
- Wait. She's CIA?
- We don't know.

271
00:28:11,361 --> 00:28:15,876
Okay, until proven otherwise,
we assume Abbott is alive.

272
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,312
<i>That makes her a material witness
and quite possibly a suspect.</i>

273
00:28:19,336 --> 00:28:23,183
<i>Get her details out to the police,
MI5, the media.</i>

274
00:28:22,007 --> 00:28:25,887
<i>If she's wandering around injured,
surely a security camera will pick her up.</i>

275
00:28:25,911 --> 00:28:27,655
<i>No, she'll know better than that.</i>

276
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,258
But put her friends, especially
that photographer, Lisa Carr,

277
00:28:30,282 --> 00:28:33,561
under surveillance.
Abbott might reach out to her.

278
00:28:33,585 --> 00:28:36,943
I had a lock on Kate's locator,
but the signal keeps breaking up.

279
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:39,434
<i>Kate knows we're tracking
her Embassy ID.</i>

280
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:42,570
She's following protocol,
heading for the safe zone in the park.

281
00:28:42,594 --> 00:28:46,057
<i>- Talbot's already there.</i>
- I'll be there in two minutes.

282
00:29:13,927 --> 00:29:16,849
- Kate.
- Bill.

283
00:29:18,365 --> 00:29:20,911
- Thank God you're all right. Okay?
- Okay.

284
00:29:20,935 --> 00:29:23,447
- Bill, they're all dead.
- I know, I know.

285
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:25,716
- All right, come here.
- Bill, I tried to save them.

286
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,518
- There's nothing left.
- Let's walk here.

287
00:29:27,542 --> 00:29:29,921
- I tried to save them.
- I know. Relax.

288
00:29:29,945 --> 00:29:33,858
There was... there was a man
with a gun outside. He almost...

289
00:29:33,882 --> 00:29:38,844
Why couldn't you have left things
alone, Kate? Now I have no choice.

290
00:29:50,797 --> 00:29:53,200
Kate...

291
00:29:54,568 --> 00:29:56,562
Bill.

292
00:30:01,641 --> 00:30:04,563
Look, look. Over there, see?

293
00:30:09,884 --> 00:30:12,485
Danny! Come here!

294
00:30:18,594 --> 00:30:20,794
Get away! She's got a gun!

295
00:30:23,901 --> 00:30:25,349
It was an accident.

296
00:30:27,404 --> 00:30:29,724
- He tried...
- Someone call the police!

297
00:30:38,649 --> 00:30:41,881
Somebody help him!

298
00:30:52,263 --> 00:30:55,063
Someone call the police!

299
00:31:03,907 --> 00:31:07,989
Yeah, yeah, Lancaster gate. Yeah.

300
00:31:11,383 --> 00:31:13,823
Excuse me.

301
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:20,490
Damn it.

302
00:31:38,911 --> 00:31:44,020
<i>Witnesses saw Abbott holding a gun
and Talbot staggering toward the fountain.</i>

303
00:31:43,317 --> 00:31:47,007
And this time, we have video evidence.

304
00:31:48,189 --> 00:31:50,701
Please, Paul,
give me the chance to find her.

305
00:31:50,725 --> 00:31:52,883
I'm sorry, Sam. I have my orders.

306
00:31:55,529 --> 00:32:00,511
Look, I know that you track your people
using GPS chips in their IDs.

307
00:32:00,535 --> 00:32:02,445
It's how you knew
that Talbot and Abbott were here.

308
00:32:02,469 --> 00:32:05,086
Hang on a second.

309
00:32:08,976 --> 00:32:12,691
- Where's Bill's ID?
- I'm sure we'll find it. My point is this,

310
00:32:12,715 --> 00:32:16,194
assuming Abbott still has her ID,
you can find her,

311
00:32:16,218 --> 00:32:19,164
and it's best I'm there when you do.

312
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:21,199
The kid's video went viral.

313
00:32:21,223 --> 00:32:23,268
The Home Secretary saw it,
got on to the Foreign Office.

314
00:32:23,292 --> 00:32:27,539
Now she's wanted for deadly assault
and questioning in a terrorist incident.

315
00:32:27,563 --> 00:32:30,542
Kate has diplomatic immunity.
You can't touch her.

316
00:32:30,566 --> 00:32:33,503
You know we won't take chances
with people like that, Sam.

317
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:50,784
Come in.

318
00:32:55,157 --> 00:32:56,639
Who are you?

319
00:32:56,663 --> 00:32:59,972
Trevor. I work with Fred.

320
00:32:59,996 --> 00:33:04,918
I only work with Fred. Shut the door.

321
00:33:08,272 --> 00:33:12,234
He's ill. Do you want my help or not?

322
00:33:20,781 --> 00:33:24,998
The signal is active.
You'd better hurry.

323
00:33:25,022 --> 00:33:26,767
What's happening
with those trackers, Sally?

324
00:33:26,791 --> 00:33:30,404
<i>Someone must have taken Bill Talbot's.
It's moved away from the park.</i>

325
00:33:30,428 --> 00:33:32,991
At the moment, it's stationary
off Russell Square.

326
00:33:33,015 --> 00:33:35,009
There's still a problem with Kate's.

327
00:33:35,033 --> 00:33:37,378
The tracker must have got damaged
in the explosion.

328
00:33:37,402 --> 00:33:38,979
<i>What's the last location
we have for her?</i>

329
00:33:39,003 --> 00:33:41,516
Lamb's market off Curzon street.

330
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:45,752
- And you're sure no one else can track her?
- Absolutely. Only you and me.

331
00:33:45,776 --> 00:33:47,173
I need to get to her, Sally.

332
00:33:47,197 --> 00:33:49,907
That's exactly what Anderson
is expecting you to do,

333
00:33:49,931 --> 00:33:52,766
<i>and he'll be right behind you
with an SAS team.</i>

334
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,962
Kate knows what to do, Sam.

335
00:33:53,986 --> 00:33:56,131
<i>It's more important
we find Talbot's tracker.</i>

336
00:33:56,155 --> 00:34:00,676
<i>Whoever has it might be able to tell us
what really happened in that park.</i>

337
00:34:11,869 --> 00:34:14,510
The fireworks in Dubai.

338
00:34:15,406 --> 00:34:17,086
That was you, right?

339
00:34:30,491 --> 00:34:34,472
Now you can follow

340
00:34:34,496 --> 00:34:36,534
whoever has one of these.

341
00:34:37,097 --> 00:34:38,910
And the second item?

342
00:34:38,934 --> 00:34:42,213
Straight from the lab
used by the security services.

343
00:34:42,237 --> 00:34:45,077
Dials you into their field agent
communication system...

344
00:34:49,943 --> 00:34:53,268
You shouldn't have asked about Dubai.

345
00:35:34,255 --> 00:35:37,545
<i>We're in the Italian Gardens
on the north side of Kensington Gardens,</i>

346
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:39,485
<i>where a short time ago...</i>

347
00:35:43,552 --> 00:35:45,069
- Sally?
- <i>The Met has issued a warrant</i>

348
00:35:45,093 --> 00:35:46,531
<i>for Kate's arrest.</i>

349
00:35:46,625 --> 00:35:51,084
<i>horrific explosion earlier today
at a popular restaurant not far from here.</i>

350
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:53,911
<i>This is Sam Parker. Leave a message.</i>

351
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,223
God damn it.

352
00:35:56,247 --> 00:36:01,288
<i>And Bill Talbot's tracker
fell off the grid five minutes ago.</i>

353
00:36:13,131 --> 00:36:17,812
<i>taken by a witness here.
We can show you these images now.</i>

354
00:36:17,836 --> 00:36:20,281
<i>There is a woman seen
running from the scene...</i>

355
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:22,416
- <i>Section 5.</i>
- Sally, it's me.

356
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,120
<i>Where are you? I've been monitoring you,
but your tracker keeps shorting out.</i>

357
00:36:26,144 --> 00:36:28,573
<i>You have to give me your location, Kate.</i>

358
00:36:28,597 --> 00:36:32,020
<i>Kate? Kate?</i>

359
00:36:44,595 --> 00:36:46,541
Damn.

360
00:36:46,965 --> 00:36:49,911
<i>Sam, what's going on?
Did you find Talbot's tracker?</i>

361
00:36:49,935 --> 00:36:52,713
- No, just a dead guy.
- What?

362
00:36:52,737 --> 00:36:54,248
Talk to me about Kate.

363
00:36:53,072 --> 00:36:57,219
She called in two minutes ago,
hung up before I could get a location.

364
00:36:57,243 --> 00:37:01,564
Sam, you need to get back here.
The Ambassador's on the warpath.

365
00:37:02,549 --> 00:37:05,561
He must have missed Abbott.

366
00:37:05,585 --> 00:37:07,932
Tell the pickup teams to stand down.

367
00:37:07,956 --> 00:37:10,875
Let's see what's so interesting
about that hotel.

368
00:37:11,091 --> 00:37:13,370
What do I have to do to convince you?

369
00:37:13,394 --> 00:37:17,107
Oh, come on, please, give me a break.

370
00:37:17,131 --> 00:37:19,010
Just one phone call.

371
00:37:20,133 --> 00:37:23,080
Look, it was a present.

372
00:37:24,004 --> 00:37:28,326
It's sterling, okay? Please.

373
00:37:34,916 --> 00:37:38,798
- Local call only.
- Okay.

374
00:37:46,341 --> 00:37:47,610
- Hello.
- It's me.

375
00:37:47,634 --> 00:37:49,702
<i>Kate. Oh, my God. I've been watching
the news. Where are you?</i>

376
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:53,645
- Lisa, please, I need clothes and money.
- <i>All right, I'll go to your place.</i>

377
00:37:53,669 --> 00:37:55,981
Uh, no, no, no. It's not safe, um...

378
00:37:56,005 --> 00:37:58,216
Can you just come meet me
and bring me some of your things?

379
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,386
- Where?
- Somewhere where there's a lot of people.

380
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:04,233
St. Pancras station
by the Christmas market. Two hours.

381
00:38:27,671 --> 00:38:31,313
What's the composition of the gas?

382
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:35,823
A precise mixture of hydrogen,
methane, and fluorine.

383
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:39,058
The volume in New York
will be four times greater.

384
00:38:39,082 --> 00:38:41,164
So will the results.

385
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:49,057
Made to the exact specifications
necessary to trigger this device.

386
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:55,050
I'm curious. Why not use
a detonator in New York?

387
00:38:55,632 --> 00:38:57,812
At major events,

388
00:38:57,836 --> 00:39:02,049
the police carry
beeper-size radiation detectors.

389
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:04,577
There's bomb-sniffing dogs,

390
00:39:04,601 --> 00:39:07,455
Hazmat units.

391
00:39:07,479 --> 00:39:12,260
If there's any sign of an alert,
even a false alarm,

392
00:39:12,284 --> 00:39:16,403
the first thing the authorities do
is kill all communications,

393
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:20,067
jam radio frequencies,

394
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:24,213
shut down all cell phone towers.

395
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:27,203
Then we have the counter snipers

396
00:39:27,227 --> 00:39:30,446
placed in a 500-meter radius.

397
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:32,678
However,

398
00:39:32,702 --> 00:39:35,956
I shall be firing
outside their perimeter.

399
00:40:05,542 --> 00:40:08,344
Soon, my friend.

400
00:40:12,316 --> 00:40:14,717
So now there's only the girl.

401
00:40:15,686 --> 00:40:21,048
Just make sure my shipment
gets to New York, that's all I ask.

402
00:40:29,575 --> 00:40:32,580
<i>The large gas explosion
ripped through the housing estate</i>

403
00:40:32,604 --> 00:40:34,215
<i>- in tower hamlets.</i>
- Thanks.

404
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:37,918
<i>What have you got for me, Maureen?
The president is demanding answers.</i>

405
00:40:37,942 --> 00:40:41,922
I just spoke with the British Home
Secretary. They don't have her. Do we?

406
00:40:41,946 --> 00:40:44,909
Abbott's tracker was damaged in the blast.
We lost her signal for the moment,

407
00:40:44,933 --> 00:40:47,728
but even if we get it back,
the Brits have snatch teams ready to go.

408
00:40:47,752 --> 00:40:51,165
If I try to make a move on Abbott
and happen to get lucky on her location,

409
00:40:51,189 --> 00:40:54,435
- I lead her right to Anderson.
- Sam, she's a liability.

410
00:40:54,459 --> 00:40:57,670
Kate had nothing to do
with Bill's murder.

411
00:40:57,694 --> 00:40:59,173
Go ahead.

412
00:40:59,197 --> 00:41:02,343
Um, this morning Kate took
the monthly visa list.

413
00:41:02,367 --> 00:41:05,379
The flash drive contains
all of the background checks

414
00:41:05,403 --> 00:41:07,081
and references on the applicants.

415
00:41:07,105 --> 00:41:10,184
If we find there's been
a possible terrorist breach,

416
00:41:10,208 --> 00:41:13,088
that's usually the first place we look.

417
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:16,331
- She said you'd okayed it.
- Did you?

418
00:41:19,349 --> 00:41:20,844
No.

419
00:41:21,318 --> 00:41:23,442
<i>What about the backup systems?</i>

420
00:41:23,722 --> 00:41:27,001
Five files were permanently
deleted earlier today.

421
00:41:27,025 --> 00:41:30,103
The entry log shows
that it was Abbott's ID.

422
00:41:30,127 --> 00:41:33,174
It gets worse.
We checked the security log.

423
00:41:33,198 --> 00:41:36,076
Abbott has been working a lot of nights
when there's no one around.

424
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:39,047
It's possible that she created documents
to get somebody into the country,

425
00:41:39,071 --> 00:41:41,266
and then erased the records
to cover herself.

426
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:44,187
May I remind you that just five
weeks ago, you sent her over here

427
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:47,645
with glowing recommendations
because we needed the best.

428
00:41:47,669 --> 00:41:50,458
If I recall correctly,
she was one of your protegees,

429
00:41:50,482 --> 00:41:52,394
although I'm sure you'll deny that now.

430
00:41:52,418 --> 00:41:55,531
I was skeptical at first,
but it turns out you were right.

431
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:59,167
- She's an extraordinary asset.
<i>- Yeah, just not for us.</i>

432
00:41:59,191 --> 00:42:01,536
That's complete bullshit,

433
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,840
and deep in your scared little souls
you all know it.

434
00:42:05,298 --> 00:42:07,133
We don't assume the worst
of our best people

435
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:11,079
and we damn sure don't sell them out
at the first sign of trouble.

436
00:42:09,903 --> 00:42:13,452
But most of all,
we don't forget motivation,

437
00:42:13,476 --> 00:42:15,459
and Kate's is sterling.

438
00:42:16,342 --> 00:42:19,223
She lost some
of her best friends on 9/11.

439
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,960
Then why is she still running?

440
00:42:39,635 --> 00:42:42,297
She's on the move.

441
00:42:58,685 --> 00:43:01,665
- Where's Kate?
- The last time we got a signal?

442
00:43:01,689 --> 00:43:04,402
Leicester Square,
and that was 10 minutes ago.

443
00:43:04,426 --> 00:43:06,537
It was barely registering.

444
00:43:06,561 --> 00:43:11,523
Jesus, you look how I feel.
How are you holding up?

445
00:43:10,932 --> 00:43:13,912
We're monitoring
Anderson's communications.

446
00:43:13,936 --> 00:43:17,576
His people are looking hard,
but in all the wrong places.

447
00:43:20,141 --> 00:43:22,461
How did it go upstairs?

448
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:25,093
They want me to try to bring in Kate,
use Anderson if I have to.

449
00:43:31,355 --> 00:43:36,357
From Anderson's forensic lab.
Don't ask how I got it.

450
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,406
The bomb has traces of chromium.

451
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:43,076
- We haven't seen that since...
- Paris, two years ago.

452
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,944
The Watchmaker.

453
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:48,215
<i>Or whatever he calls himself these days.</i>

454
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:53,252
<i>Whoever wanted the visa crew dead
paid for the best operator in the business.</i>

455
00:43:53,276 --> 00:43:58,686
<i>He's had so much reconstructive surgery,
no one knows what the hell he looks like.</i>

456
00:44:05,855 --> 00:44:08,501
She's in St. Pancras station.

457
00:44:08,525 --> 00:44:10,309
I'll have to take the chance.

458
00:44:22,138 --> 00:44:23,751
And where's Abbott's friend?

459
00:44:21,975 --> 00:44:25,521
<i>She just turned off the Euston Road
into St. Pancras station.</i>

460
00:44:25,545 --> 00:44:28,425
All right, stay with her. I'm on my way.

461
00:44:51,303 --> 00:44:54,316
<i>Please allow
passengers off the train first.</i>

462
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:57,980
<i>Please allow passengers
off the train first.</i>

463
00:45:05,784 --> 00:45:13,269
<i>For your safety and security,
CCTV is in operation in every station.</i>

464
00:46:14,057 --> 00:46:18,259
Code Lucifer. Repeat, code Lucifer.

465
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:19,845
Lisa.

466
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:22,550
Suspected suicide bomber
at northeast entrance.

467
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:26,061
Okay, move. Move, move, move, move!

468
00:46:33,944 --> 00:46:35,090
What's the matter?

469
00:46:34,514 --> 00:46:36,792
Did you bring the money?
Did you bring it?

470
00:46:36,816 --> 00:46:38,443
Kate, you've got to tell me something.

471
00:46:38,467 --> 00:46:41,648
Stay here. Don't move
until someone tells you to.

472
00:46:41,653 --> 00:46:44,051
What?

473
00:46:44,222 --> 00:46:46,662
Kate. Kate!

474
00:47:07,413 --> 00:47:09,574
Move! Move!

475
00:47:11,517 --> 00:47:14,118
Move, move, move! Abbott!

476
00:47:27,166 --> 00:47:29,900
You had your chance to help me, Sam.

477
00:47:30,336 --> 00:47:33,337
Make sure he doesn't follow us.

478
00:47:52,711 --> 00:47:53,873
Abbott?

479
00:47:53,897 --> 00:47:57,464
There's no way out, Abbott.
It's a dead end.

480
00:48:08,076 --> 00:48:10,714
This way, sir.

481
00:48:12,948 --> 00:48:15,604
Damn it.

482
00:48:18,819 --> 00:48:20,776
It's this way.

483
00:48:23,792 --> 00:48:26,432
Abbott!

484
00:48:27,662 --> 00:48:29,382
Abbott, stop!

485
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:43,952
Stop!

486
00:48:45,948 --> 00:48:47,431
Stop!

487
00:48:48,485 --> 00:48:51,132
Follow her!

488
00:48:59,095 --> 00:49:01,148
Abbott!

489
00:49:01,172 --> 00:49:04,242
No, this way!

490
00:49:09,038 --> 00:49:11,790
- I think she went this way.
- Shit. Shit.

491
00:49:11,814 --> 00:49:14,146
Shit!

492
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:15,455
Shit!

493
00:49:15,479 --> 00:49:17,324
We can seal them off from the street.

494
00:49:17,348 --> 00:49:20,360
What, you think she's gonna take
an officially marked tourist exit?

495
00:49:19,184 --> 00:49:23,055
There are hundreds
of other ways out of here!

496
00:49:23,387 --> 00:49:25,548
She could be anywhere.

497
00:49:45,544 --> 00:49:47,947
What?

498
00:50:09,477 --> 00:50:12,148
Jesus.

499
00:50:33,661 --> 00:50:37,480
Fucking technology.

500
00:50:37,748 --> 00:50:39,148
Bitch.

501
00:52:17,838 --> 00:52:19,677
Sam?

502
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:24,761
Oh, come on.
You know I didn't do any of this.

503
00:52:38,866 --> 00:52:40,169
Gotcha.

504
00:52:40,193 --> 00:52:42,839
You sure it was the same guy you saw
after the restaurant explosion?

505
00:52:42,863 --> 00:52:45,341
Yes, and he was in the park
after Bill tried to kill me.

506
00:52:45,365 --> 00:52:48,438
So he could have followed you here.

507
00:52:48,462 --> 00:52:51,117
Give me your ID.

508
00:52:51,737 --> 00:52:54,217
We don't need anybody else tracking you.

509
00:52:54,241 --> 00:52:56,759
You think he's tracked me all this time?

510
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:10,234
- Sam, who is he?
- His code name is The Watchmaker.

511
00:53:10,258 --> 00:53:13,703
He's one of the most wanted
assassins in the world.

512
00:53:13,727 --> 00:53:15,326
You doing okay?

513
00:53:17,464 --> 00:53:20,676
How did you know I would come here?

514
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,745
I didn't.

515
00:53:22,769 --> 00:53:25,329
I just came looking for answers.

516
00:53:58,407 --> 00:54:00,807
What are we doing with our lives?

517
00:54:02,043 --> 00:54:05,471
I put everything into this.

518
00:54:05,514 --> 00:54:08,995
And what am I now? A suspect? A target?

519
00:54:09,019 --> 00:54:10,681
Maybe both.

520
00:54:14,859 --> 00:54:17,086
We're doing this because...

521
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:20,774
we believe in that old-fashioned idea
of country, right?

522
00:54:20,798 --> 00:54:24,510
Or at least protecting
our fellow citizens.

523
00:54:24,534 --> 00:54:26,337
Our friends.

524
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:29,310
Right now, I'm doing it
to protect my own hide.

525
00:54:30,273 --> 00:54:32,193
That's good thinking.

526
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:36,612
What's that?

527
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:38,960
It's the flash drive I got from Howie.

528
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:42,064
Last month we processed
over 600 visa applications,

529
00:54:42,088 --> 00:54:47,301
and Bill personally intervened in five
of those cases, including Balan's.

530
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:50,472
Now for each applicant he used
a different member of the visa team,

531
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:54,709
and when I started asking questions,
he ignored me, slammed them through.

532
00:54:54,733 --> 00:54:57,814
So what's the connection
between the applicants?

533
00:54:58,002 --> 00:54:59,915
I don't know yet.

534
00:54:59,939 --> 00:55:04,155
But we do know Balan is an expert
in combustible gases.

535
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:09,511
Maybe Bill had the answer.

536
00:55:10,281 --> 00:55:14,163
Bill said something strange in the park.
"Now I have no choice."

537
00:55:14,187 --> 00:55:16,898
He must have kept some information
about the people he let in.

538
00:55:16,922 --> 00:55:22,220
- A little leverage, in case he needed it.
- Who puts a padlock on a bedroom door?

539
00:55:39,579 --> 00:55:42,797
Hello, my lovely.

540
00:55:48,321 --> 00:55:50,721
God.

541
00:55:52,792 --> 00:55:56,354
- Is this Bill's son?
- Yeah.

542
00:55:58,431 --> 00:56:01,995
Johnny died in Afghanistan.

543
00:56:02,435 --> 00:56:05,062
Something about this
just doesn't add up.

544
00:56:05,086 --> 00:56:08,694
It's like Bill was expecting him to walk
through the door at any minute.

545
00:56:08,743 --> 00:56:10,469
Take it apart.

546
00:56:10,946 --> 00:56:13,394
Everything.

547
00:56:40,443 --> 00:56:43,014
Look at this.

548
00:56:53,056 --> 00:56:57,003
<i>Hi, Dad. I'm doing okay.</i>

549
00:56:57,027 --> 00:56:59,972
<i>Hope you are, too.</i>

550
00:56:59,996 --> 00:57:02,120
<i>It'll be Christmas soon.</i>

551
00:57:02,299 --> 00:57:05,224
<i>Wish we could be together.</i>

552
00:57:06,235 --> 00:57:09,248
Johnny's been alive all this time.

553
00:57:09,272 --> 00:57:12,451
- Do you think there's a chance?
- I doubt it. Look at his eyes.

554
00:57:12,475 --> 00:57:14,054
He's swimming in dope.

555
00:57:14,078 --> 00:57:18,318
Someone kept him alive for as long
as possible to get this footage.

556
00:57:18,382 --> 00:57:21,179
But how did they know it was
Bill's son, or who Bill was?

557
00:57:21,203 --> 00:57:23,731
They must have someone
with access to army records.

558
00:57:23,755 --> 00:57:27,202
Doesn't have to be a major player.
A guy inputting data could be enough.

559
00:57:27,226 --> 00:57:29,303
Once they knew it was Bill,
they threatened to kill his son

560
00:57:29,327 --> 00:57:32,840
- if he didn't give them what they wanted.
- Which makes Bill's actions understandable.

561
00:57:32,864 --> 00:57:34,364
But not excusable,

562
00:57:34,388 --> 00:57:37,019
because once Bill got his people into
the States, it was only a matter of time

563
00:57:37,043 --> 00:57:40,247
before he eliminated everyone
who handled the paperwork.

564
00:57:40,271 --> 00:57:42,850
Then he got the bastard
who murdered them to come after me.

565
00:57:42,874 --> 00:57:46,187
The Watchmaker would never deal
with low-level guys like Bill.

566
00:57:46,211 --> 00:57:50,868
His business is
with whoever had Bill's son.

567
00:57:49,815 --> 00:57:52,094
You said there were four others
besides Balan?

568
00:57:52,118 --> 00:57:56,406
Yeah, and every single one
of them is in America.

569
00:58:02,862 --> 00:58:05,799
We need to move now.
I'll get archer to meet us out front.

570
00:58:10,102 --> 00:58:12,744
Come on, come on, come on.

571
00:58:17,984 --> 00:58:20,978
- What's wrong?
- Let's get the hell out of here.

572
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:29,999
Sam?

573
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:43,947
Kate.

574
00:58:50,311 --> 00:58:52,390
Kate.

575
00:59:54,713 --> 00:59:57,258
- Sally.
- Kate?

576
00:59:57,282 --> 01:00:00,661
- Is Sam still alive?
<i>- Barely.</i>

577
01:00:00,685 --> 01:00:04,085
<i>He's pretty badly hurt, Kate.</i>

578
01:00:04,922 --> 01:00:09,304
Hold on. Anderson's on the scene.
He's coming on the line with Crane.

579
01:00:09,328 --> 01:00:12,807
Madam Ambassador,
I'm at Bill Talbot's apartment.

580
01:00:12,831 --> 01:00:15,009
Sam Parker's been critically injured.

581
01:00:15,033 --> 01:00:16,411
Jesus.

582
01:00:16,435 --> 01:00:20,548
Witnesses saw Abbott running from
the scene, and we found her Embassy ID.

583
01:00:20,572 --> 01:00:22,676
<i>- Where is she now?
- We don't know.</i>

584
01:00:23,274 --> 01:00:28,604
If you get her in your sights,
do not hesitate. Do you understand?

585
01:00:28,628 --> 01:00:30,780
Yes, I do.

586
01:00:30,982 --> 01:00:34,728
The longer she lives,
the more people die.

587
01:00:34,752 --> 01:00:36,930
Kate.

588
01:00:35,754 --> 01:00:38,234
- I'm here.
- I'm so sorry.

589
01:00:38,258 --> 01:00:40,179
<i>They think you tried to kill him.</i>

590
01:00:40,203 --> 01:00:44,863
What? That's insane.

591
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:47,576
I need to get into the Embassy.
To the vault.

592
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:50,627
- <i>The building's on total lockdown.</i>
- There's no other way.

593
01:00:50,651 --> 01:00:53,282
<i>Kate, listen to me.
The place is crawling with marines.</i>

594
01:00:53,306 --> 01:00:57,987
You know I'm innocent.
And I know I'm right about this plot.

595
01:00:58,011 --> 01:01:01,264
You have to get me in, Sally.

596
01:01:26,018 --> 01:01:29,448
- <i>I'm at the north roll-up door.</i>
- I'm buzzing you in now.

597
01:01:29,455 --> 01:01:33,024
I'm shutting down the cameras
in the stairwell and the vault.

598
01:01:33,048 --> 01:01:36,871
In and out, as fast as you can.

599
01:02:08,853 --> 01:02:12,535
<i>Attention. Security breach
at basement level.</i>

600
01:02:29,941 --> 01:02:33,326
Oh, God. No.

601
01:02:33,551 --> 01:02:36,269
<i>There's a terrorist
headed for the States.</i>

602
01:02:37,319 --> 01:02:40,132
Emil Balan. He's traveling
on a Romanian passport.

603
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:44,136
Oceanic Airlines, flight 428,
out of Heathrow to JFK.

604
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,119
They have to stop him, Sally.

605
01:03:12,454 --> 01:03:15,768
<i>We missed her. She got herself a new
passport, and then wasted the hard drive.</i>

606
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:19,438
<i>The name she used, the passport number,
they're gone. She could be anyone.</i>

607
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:23,542
Get Abbott's picture to security
at all London airports and train stations.

608
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:25,445
Yes, yes, yes, what is it?

609
01:03:40,281 --> 01:03:44,129
- The purpose of your visit, doctor?
- Medical conference.

610
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:48,267
There's still time to stop Balan,
Madam Ambassador, if you act now.

611
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:51,370
No. Don't you see what Abbott's doing?

612
01:03:51,394 --> 01:03:57,080
She is trying to get us to chase
a shadow instead of her.

613
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:25,927
You're supposed to have left
for New York.

614
01:04:26,061 --> 01:04:29,181
I'm not sure I'm going.

615
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,481
What the hell are you talking about?

616
01:04:36,071 --> 01:04:40,285
I found your reaction
to that little explosion quite instructive.

617
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:45,951
The way your eyes lit up,
the greed I saw in them.

618
01:04:46,414 --> 01:04:49,328
Fortunes are made
when there's blood on the streets,

619
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:51,363
and very soon there's gonna be
a great deal of blood

620
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:53,948
on the streets of New York, won't there?

621
01:04:53,972 --> 01:04:57,794
Just as there was after 9/11.

622
01:04:56,893 --> 01:05:00,407
However, when the New York
exchanges reopened,

623
01:05:00,431 --> 01:05:05,144
people who bet against the market
made a fortune.

624
01:05:05,168 --> 01:05:10,483
This isn't an act of terror
or a bold political statement.

625
01:05:10,507 --> 01:05:13,419
Balan may wish to avenge
his wife's death,

626
01:05:12,243 --> 01:05:15,421
but for you...

627
01:05:15,445 --> 01:05:18,134
it's just about making money.

628
01:05:18,315 --> 01:05:22,997
$100 billion is in play. I would say
the word "just" doesn't quite fit.

629
01:05:23,021 --> 01:05:25,433
If I stay home, you won't make a penny.

630
01:05:25,457 --> 01:05:27,785
- What do you want?
- Half.

631
01:05:28,493 --> 01:05:32,206
Half of your short-selling profits
on the New York exchanges

632
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:37,625
the day they reopen for trade. Simple.

633
01:05:37,836 --> 01:05:40,276
Is the girl dead?

634
01:05:46,411 --> 01:05:47,811
Very.

635
01:06:07,934 --> 01:06:12,615
<i>For security reasons,
please do not leave baggage unattended.</i>

636
01:06:12,639 --> 01:06:18,522
<i>Baggage left unattended will be removed
and may be destroyed.</i>

637
01:06:26,052 --> 01:06:30,534
- I'll grab these, too.
- Yeah, got it.

638
01:06:42,136 --> 01:06:44,537
- There you go. Thanks.
- Thank you.

639
01:06:47,941 --> 01:06:49,501
Thank you.

640
01:06:57,819 --> 01:07:00,198
Your flight boards in 15 minutes,
Miss Harrison.

641
01:07:00,222 --> 01:07:02,766
Thank you.

642
01:07:02,790 --> 01:07:04,270
- Good morning.
- Hi.

643
01:07:15,504 --> 01:07:18,284
- Just one way, Miss Harrison?
- Yes.

644
01:07:18,308 --> 01:07:22,021
- Is everything all right, ma'am?
- Death in the family.

645
01:07:22,045 --> 01:07:24,965
- Safe travels.
- Thank you.

646
01:07:41,831 --> 01:07:43,377
Now this is taking too long.

647
01:07:43,401 --> 01:07:48,081
I'm doing the best I can,
Madam Ambassador.

648
01:07:59,550 --> 01:08:01,662
Excuse me, ma'am. You'll have
to shut that down for landing.

649
01:08:01,686 --> 01:08:04,204
Okay.

650
01:08:24,208 --> 01:08:27,730
- Ma'am.
- I'm shutting it down.

651
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:04,115
Gonna get us both killed.

652
01:09:19,967 --> 01:09:22,413
It doesn't make sense. Why Paris?

653
01:09:22,437 --> 01:09:26,983
Abbott has no history there,
no friends to help her.

654
01:09:27,007 --> 01:09:32,330
And why risk flying?
It's safer to take the Eurostar.

655
01:09:36,251 --> 01:09:38,298
She's going to New York.

656
01:09:51,733 --> 01:09:54,880
- Welcome home.
- Thank you.

657
01:09:54,904 --> 01:09:59,284
<i>This is not a normal breach. Abbott
is a security officer and a serious threat.</i>

658
01:09:59,308 --> 01:10:01,720
<i>- Find her.</i>
- Understood, Madam Ambassador.

659
01:10:01,744 --> 01:10:04,136
Hey, listen up. We got a red flag.

660
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:05,991
- Red flag.
- Let's go.

661
01:10:06,015 --> 01:10:10,896
US passport number 212683550.

662
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:16,101
Suspect is traveling as Harrison, Amy,
coming off USS827.

663
01:10:16,125 --> 01:10:19,171
Real name, Katherine Abbott.
Photo's on the way.

664
01:10:19,195 --> 01:10:21,407
Jamieson, let's get the details
to Immigration.

665
01:10:21,431 --> 01:10:25,494
- Miller, let's alert customs and NYPD.
- Yes, ma'am.

666
01:10:28,972 --> 01:10:31,884
As soon as her picture comes in,
I want you to get it out to every taxi

667
01:10:31,908 --> 01:10:36,631
and bus driver and the rental
car agencies. Stay alert, people.

668
01:10:44,721 --> 01:10:48,523
Careful, ma'am. You're in New York now.

669
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:52,360
Taxi, madam?

670
01:10:52,629 --> 01:10:54,097
You're a gypsy, right?

671
01:10:54,098 --> 01:10:57,111
Madam, I'm an independent contractor
with 14 years' experience.

672
01:10:57,135 --> 01:10:59,446
Okay. No medallion? No radio either?

673
01:10:59,470 --> 01:11:01,648
Please, I want no trouble
with the police.

674
01:11:01,672 --> 01:11:04,006
That makes two of us.

675
01:11:04,030 --> 01:11:07,154
- 500 bucks for the night.
- In cash, plus gas.

676
01:11:07,178 --> 01:11:09,223
- It's New Year's Eve.
- Okay. Let's go.

677
01:11:09,247 --> 01:11:12,847
I have an address in lower Manhattan.

678
01:11:18,690 --> 01:11:21,769
Red, increase 3%.

679
01:11:21,793 --> 01:11:23,972
Green, maintain present level.

680
01:11:23,996 --> 01:11:27,636
Yellow, reduce 1%.

681
01:11:27,833 --> 01:11:31,675
Bit too slow, but maintain levels.

682
01:11:36,242 --> 01:11:37,964
And stop.

683
01:11:39,512 --> 01:11:42,744
Lock the cylinders.

684
01:11:46,419 --> 01:11:51,783
Don't worry about the tanks or equipment,
but make sure you pack up everything else.

685
01:11:51,791 --> 01:11:55,334
I'm going to look after the loading.

686
01:12:01,385 --> 01:12:05,816
- Take the BQE to the Brooklyn bridge.
- Very good.

687
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:09,587
You like TV? We have TV.

688
01:12:09,611 --> 01:12:11,623
<i>This is a live shot of preparations</i>

689
01:12:11,647 --> 01:12:15,159
<i>for tonight's New Year's Eve
celebrations in Times Square.</i>

690
01:12:15,183 --> 01:12:17,895
<i>As you can see, the famous
New Year's Eve ball,</i>

691
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:20,832
<i>which is displayed year round,
is not in place.</i>

692
01:12:20,856 --> 01:12:25,938
<i>It has been taken down for some
last-minute checks on the new LED lights.</i>

693
01:12:26,495 --> 01:12:28,935
Wait.

694
01:12:46,482 --> 01:12:49,294
<i>It has almost 3,000 waterproof crystals,</i>

695
01:12:49,318 --> 01:12:51,664
<i>ranging between
four and five inches each,</i>

696
01:12:51,688 --> 01:12:55,801
<i>and will be illuminated
by over 32,000 LEDs.</i>

697
01:12:55,825 --> 01:12:57,703
<i>To prevent the ball from overheating,</i>

698
01:12:57,727 --> 01:13:04,250
<i>a coolant gas is piped into the ball
just before it is attached to the pole.</i>

699
01:13:03,567 --> 01:13:06,247
Change of plan. Take me to Times Square.

700
01:13:26,891 --> 01:13:29,550
Paperwork?

701
01:13:37,501 --> 01:13:39,314
All right. You're good to go.

702
01:13:39,338 --> 01:13:42,948
- Thank you. Happy New Year.
- You too, sir.

703
01:13:51,349 --> 01:13:54,639
Can't you go any faster?

704
01:14:13,739 --> 01:14:15,699
Go.

705
01:15:08,230 --> 01:15:12,350
Sorry, ma'am.
This whole area is closed off.

706
01:15:16,071 --> 01:15:18,619
Great. I'm just gonna get out here.

707
01:16:15,833 --> 01:16:17,433
Thanks.

708
01:16:37,689 --> 01:16:39,169
Oh, my God.

709
01:18:31,341 --> 01:18:33,981
No. No.

710
01:18:42,886 --> 01:18:44,606
Hurry.

711
01:18:47,224 --> 01:18:49,784
Come on.

712
01:18:53,063 --> 01:18:54,208
Can I help you, ma'am?

713
01:18:54,232 --> 01:18:55,976
The guys that just came in,
where'd they go?

714
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,160
Uh, 1501.

715
01:19:03,258 --> 01:19:05,585
Come on, come on.

716
01:19:05,609 --> 01:19:10,092
Help! I need the cops. Someone call 911.

717
01:19:20,329 --> 01:19:22,107
We have to go.

718
01:19:22,131 --> 01:19:25,371
We have less than five minutes.

719
01:20:39,975 --> 01:20:42,488
You just had to be here.

720
01:20:42,512 --> 01:20:45,224
I've been waiting 10 years
for this moment,

721
01:20:45,248 --> 01:20:48,648
to see the Americans pay
for what they have done.

722
01:20:53,722 --> 01:20:57,302
- How far will the explosion travel?
- Not this far.

723
01:20:57,326 --> 01:20:59,207
Good.

724
01:21:47,179 --> 01:21:49,864
No.

725
01:21:50,682 --> 01:21:52,923
Bitch! Come on.

726
01:21:53,645 --> 01:21:55,709
Come on.

727
01:21:59,558 --> 01:22:00,998
Fuck you.

728
01:22:17,343 --> 01:22:20,029
Kate...

729
01:22:24,451 --> 01:22:28,365
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

730
01:22:28,389 --> 01:22:30,550
six, five,

731
01:22:30,574 --> 01:22:34,137
four, three, two, one.

732
01:22:34,161 --> 01:22:35,489
Time's up.

733
01:22:35,513 --> 01:22:37,652
Happy New Year!

734
01:22:56,650 --> 01:22:59,560
- Freeze!
- Don't move!

735
01:23:11,967 --> 01:23:14,145
Abbott.

736
01:23:14,169 --> 01:23:16,611
Abbott, it's for you.

737
01:23:22,210 --> 01:23:23,651
Hello?

738
01:23:24,647 --> 01:23:27,527
- I always liked your instincts.
<i>- Oh, Sam.</i>

739
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:33,599
You're alive.

740
01:23:33,623 --> 01:23:36,168
Yeah. You, too, from what I hear.

741
01:23:36,192 --> 01:23:39,044
<i>Mostly.</i>

742
01:23:39,762 --> 01:23:43,363
So I guess this is what
we're doing with our lives.

743
01:23:44,366 --> 01:23:46,403
Yeah,

744
01:23:46,427 --> 01:23:48,114
it is.

745
01:23:48,138 --> 01:23:52,617
<i>Kate, there were over a million people
out there tonight,</i>

746
01:23:52,641 --> 01:23:55,882
<i>and you saved them all.</i>
