1
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,760
Mmm.

2
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,974
You know, I thought I
maybe drive into town.

3
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:26,411
You want something?

4
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:29,412
No.

5
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,146
A hunter?

6
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:04,147
No, they would travel
in pairs, I think.

7
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,719
Come on.

8
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:11,790
Come on!

9
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,025
What's going on?

10
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,365
You have a gun?

11
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,366
Why would you
have a gun?

12
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:33,312
Jack?

13
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:36,313
Jack?

14
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:49,526
Jack?

15
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:59,102
Is he dead?

16
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:02,608
Jack.

17
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,609
Go to the house
and call the police.

18
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:10,313
Go!

19
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:53,545
Yeah?

20
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:56,214
It's Jack. I'm here.

21
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:58,150
What do you mean, "here"?

22
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,185
Rome.

23
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,557
There is a bar near the main station.

24
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:08,026
Caffe Ligeti,
Via Volturna.

25
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,094
Wait there.

26
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,350
Jack.

27
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:07,719
Pavel.

28
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,720
It's been a while.

29
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,826
Who was the girl?

30
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,827
A friend.

31
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:20,999
A friend?

32
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,969
Who were the Swedes?

33
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,970
I'm working on that.
It's going to take some time.

34
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,409
Did she set you up?

35
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,410
She had nothing
to do with it.

36
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:38,781
Pity.

37
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,187
You can't stay here.
I've made arrangements

38
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,188
for you to leave town
while I sort this out.

39
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,031
Take a right
outside the bar.

40
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:56,032
Then second left.
Via Magenta.

41
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:59,502
You'll find a dark blue Fiat
Tempra with Pescara plates.

42
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:04,709
I've marked a small town on the map.

43
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,711
Catelvecchio.

44
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,712
Stay there. Lay low,
till you get my call.

45
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:15,318
Don't talk to anyone.

46
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,556
And above all, don't
make any friends, Jack.

47
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:24,694
You used to know that.

48
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:09,007
Hello.
['Giorno.]

49
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:12,008
Hello.
[Buongiorno.]

50
00:15:13,355 --> 00:15:14,855
Where are you from?

51
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,947
America.

52
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:17,181
Ah, American.
[Ah, l'americano.]

53
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:18,516
Yes, American.
[Si, il americano.]

54
00:15:18,603 --> 00:15:22,203
No 'il Americano',
L'Americano! L'Americano!

55
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:04,729
Can I help you?

56
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,564
I'm no good
with machines.

57
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:09,367
You are American.
Si.

58
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,102
You speak Italian?

59
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,503
A little.
[Poco.]

60
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:14,372
On vacation?

61
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:16,441
A working vacation.

62
00:16:16,465 --> 00:16:17,465
Work?

63
00:16:17,489 --> 00:16:18,889
What kind of work?

64
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,113
I'm a photographer.

65
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,948
Fotografia?
Si.

66
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:26,684
What kind of photographs?
[Che genere di fotografia?]

67
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:29,487
Pictures of architecture,
landscape...

68
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,222
People?
No people.

69
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:34,158
Just for publications,
for magazines.

70
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,159
Magazines.
Which magazines?

71
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:40,064
Different ones.
Uh...

72
00:16:40,088 --> 00:16:41,466
...different publications

73
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:42,667
All right.
[Va bene.]

74
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,936
You must share a glass
of wine with me.

75
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:47,138
Come tonight.
Very kind. No.

76
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:50,139
You want to know
the truth about Abruzzo?

77
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:53,242
A priest
sees everything.

78
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,937
Yeah?

79
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:54,138
It's Jack.

80
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,942
You don't answer
the cell I gave you.

81
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:00,878
I'm no good
with machines.

82
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:03,879
You don't make this
easy for me, Jack.

83
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,218
I've got
a job for you.

84
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:09,320
It's a custom fit.

85
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:12,321
You don't even have
to pull the trigger.

86
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,591
I'll think about it.

87
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:31,307
The quality of
the brandy is good.

88
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:36,214
Smooth.

89
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:39,215
The only good thing
to come from the francesi.

90
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,964
You study our history?

91
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:58,701
No.

92
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:02,505
You come to Italy
to make a guide book

93
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,475
and you don't care
about history?

94
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,646
I take pictures.

95
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,983
Of course.

96
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,986
You are American.

97
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:20,556
You think you can
escape history.

98
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,729
You live for the present.

99
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,730
I try to, Father.

100
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,050
Hello.
[Buongiorno.]

101
00:20:53,074 --> 00:20:55,374
I would like this cheese ...
[Vorrei una formaggiona...]

102
00:20:55,998 --> 00:20:57,598
A wheel of Pecorino?
[Una caciottina del Pecorino?]

103
00:20:57,622 --> 00:20:58,822
Yes, Pecorino.
[Pecorino, si.]

104
00:20:59,046 --> 00:21:00,246
How much?
[Quanto costa?]

105
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,270
12 euro.

106
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:12,469
Thank you.
[Grazie.]

107
00:21:16,593 --> 00:21:17,693
Here is the change.

108
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:20,610
Thank you.
[Grazie.]

109
00:21:20,935 --> 00:21:23,135
And I thank you.

110
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,294
Thank you.
[Grazie.]

111
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,662
You are welcome.
[Prego.]

112
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:40,663
You're welcome.

113
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:44,302
Here, your coffee.
[Ecco, suo caffe.]

114
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,437
Thank you.
[Grazie.]

115
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:47,938
What you want, sir?
[Signore, desidera?]

116
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:50,074
Yes. Long coffee... American coffe.
[Si. Caffe lungo... Caffe americano.]

117
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:51,242
One american.
[Un americano.]

118
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:54,243
Yes, thank you.
[Si. Grazie.]

119
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,249
I'm Edward.

120
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,250
Mathilde.

121
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,127
Range?

122
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:12,997
150-175 meters.

123
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,199
Time?

124
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,935
Five seconds.
Seven at the most.

125
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:19,570
Targets?

126
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:21,005
One.

127
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,373
Firing rate?

128
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:24,508
Rapid.

129
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,110
Magazine capacity?

130
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:29,111
Large.
Preferably a 5.56.

131
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:32,350
The weapon must be
fairly light and compact.

132
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,617
How compact?

133
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:36,354
As compact as possible.

134
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,355
You want an automatic rifle
to fit inside a woman's purse?

135
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:42,193
A small vanity case
would be permissible.

136
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:45,194
A small briefcase
would be possible.

137
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,764
Noise?

138
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:48,332
Silencer.

139
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,334
I can only give you
a suppressor.

140
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:52,269
It'll dampen
the decibels

141
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:55,072
and dislocate
the sound source

142
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:57,742
and reduce
the muzzle flash.

143
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,477
I can't make you silent,
but I can make you invisible

144
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:02,146
as long as you're willing
to lose some range.

145
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:05,147
Two o'clock.

146
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:08,817
Light blue shirt, sunglasses.
Is he with you?

147
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:13,591
I didn't see him.

148
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:16,592
In any case,
I'm alone.

149
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:19,764
Here, one american.
[Ecco, il suo americano.]

150
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:22,765
Thank you.
[Grazie.]

151
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:29,071
I can accept
a slight loss of range.

152
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:32,243
You want a weapon
with the firing capacity

153
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:35,244
of a submachine gun
and the range of a rifle.

154
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,415
Can you do it?

155
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:51,081
Clarke.

156
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:53,684
A package.
[Un pacchetto.]

157
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:56,685
Clarke.

158
00:28:50,009 --> 00:28:51,809
I'm Clara.
[Sono Clara.]

159
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:09,813
Thank you.
[Grazie.]

160
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:12,814
See you tonight.

161
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:58,762
All the sheep in my flock
are dear to me,

162
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:01,632
but some are
dearer than most,

163
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,633
especially those that
have lost their way.

164
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:09,504
Fabio. Meccanico.
''Car doctor.''

165
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:15,309
 But I think his work
is not always legal.

166
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:38,567
Did you ever want to be
anything but a priest?

167
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:44,104
Have you ever wanted to be
anything other than a photographer?

168
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:47,542
I do what I'm good at.

169
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:50,712
You have the hands
of a craftsman,

170
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:53,951
not an artist.

171
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,952
You are good
with machines,

172
00:30:57,021 --> 00:31:00,921
yet you told me just the
opposite when we first met.

173
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:04,593
Hmm?

174
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,365
Journalism...

175
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:11,366
cannot make you
a rich man.

176
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:16,104
Perhaps you are
rich already?

177
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:23,380
A man can be rich

178
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,381
if he has God
in his heart.

179
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:32,787
I don't think God's very
interested in me, Father.

180
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,770
Fabio.

181
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:56,540
I've got some damage
to my car.

182
00:32:56,764 --> 00:32:57,964
Sorry, I'm too busy.

183
00:32:58,288 --> 00:33:00,488
I'm the friend of Father Benedetto.

184
00:33:02,056 --> 00:33:03,156
The American?
[Americano?]

185
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:04,448
Yes.
[Si.]

186
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:07,749
I'm taking photographs
in the mountains.

187
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:13,355
Okay, okay.

188
00:33:21,979 --> 00:33:24,579
You need models for you photographs?

189
00:33:24,903 --> 00:33:26,603
Beautiful Italian girls?

190
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:30,071
No, I need tools for
a broken drive shaft.

191
00:33:35,295 --> 00:33:36,695
You're a mechanic?

192
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:38,519
It's a hobby.

193
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,888
My garage,

194
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:47,889
your garage.

195
00:33:48,037 --> 00:33:50,837
Do you want me to take
a look at the bumper?

196
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,862
Yes, thank you.
[Si, grazie.]

197
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:09,306
How much?
[Quanto costa?]

198
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:11,130
Nothing!
[Niente!]

199
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:14,976
Thank you.
[Grazie.]

200
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,600
Is Clara here?

201
00:38:00,624 --> 00:38:02,124
She's not here tonight.

202
00:38:03,048 --> 00:38:05,048
Would you like a drink?

203
00:38:05,472 --> 00:38:07,672
No thanks. Perhaps another time.

204
00:38:58,896 --> 00:39:00,096
Letter from a friend.

205
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,520
<i>Three dead in Dalarna

206
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:09,257
Hello again, Edward.

207
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:07,748
Does this place
get many visitors?

208
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:11,052
This is the only way
to get here.

209
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:14,390
Did you check it for
footprints and tire tracks?

210
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:17,391
Three days ago I walked
the river, both sides.

211
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:21,495
Let's check again.

212
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,234
Rounds?

213
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:34,235
I prepared two kinds,
10 jacketed, 10 expanding.

214
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:38,441
I'd like 20 of each.

215
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:40,543
And 10 explosive.

216
00:44:40,544 --> 00:44:42,979
Not a problem.
Will mercury do?

217
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:45,980
Mercury will do
very nicely.

218
00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:50,584
I brought my own target.

219
00:44:58,896 --> 00:45:01,896
Right there.

220
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:48,177
Muzzle velocity?

221
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:49,912
About 360 miles an hour.

222
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:52,913
That's including 20 miles an hour
off for the sound suppression.

223
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:55,685
Ruger?

224
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:57,553
M14.

225
00:45:57,554 --> 00:46:00,123
I've not had one before.

226
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:03,124
You'll find it easy.

227
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:06,529
I've re-balanced it for the
weight of the suppressor.

228
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,598
The fulcrum's two centimeters
forward from the grip,

229
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,299
but that shouldn't matter
if you're firing,

230
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:13,300
I'm assuming you are,
from a fixed position.

231
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,371
There's no major
recoil issues.

232
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:18,372
You should be able to hold
any target, even the smallest.

233
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:53,174
Go to the flower.
Fire into these reeds,

234
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:57,545
say, two steps
away from me.

235
00:46:57,915 --> 00:47:00,915
Two bursts,
five seconds apart.

236
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,309
The sound suppression
is superb.

237
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:03,310
I couldn't place
the direction of fire.

238
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,486
I shall require the rounds and the
weapon by the first of next month.

239
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:11,587
In the meantime,

240
00:48:11,588 --> 00:48:13,422
could you tighten the
adjusting screws on the sight?

241
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:16,292
They're too loose.
What about the case?

242
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:20,093
It's a briefcase. Samsonite.
Black. Combination locks.

243
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:22,064
You have a number
you prefer?

244
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:25,065
014.
014.

245
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:30,638
What do you want
done with these?

246
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:43,017
How thoughtful.

247
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:45,454
''Asprinio.''
I don't know it.

248
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:48,224
It's like Moscato,
only frizzante.

249
00:48:48,225 --> 00:48:51,225
It wouldn't look right
if the picnic wasn't touched.

250
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:53,329
You chilled the wine,
I thought...

251
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:56,330
Had to be chilled.
Italian cops.

252
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,773
Don't move.

253
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,615
So beautiful.

254
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:17,651
It's endangered.

255
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:24,560
You like coming here.

256
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:27,096
It serves a purpose.

257
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:29,465
You've never taken a woman
here before?

258
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:32,466
No.

259
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,040
Perhaps you do not have
a woman in your life?

260
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:09,503
Thank you, for a lovely day, Mr. Butterfly.

261
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:54,283
Sergio Leone.

262
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:57,284
Italiano.

263
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:17,638
No.

264
00:53:59,726 --> 00:54:01,426
You're acting strange.

265
00:54:10,726 --> 00:54:12,426
Strange?

266
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:16,251
Yes.
[Si.]

267
00:54:16,975 --> 00:54:18,675
Almost as if...

268
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:23,223
It's like you can't stop
thinking about something.

269
00:54:27,831 --> 00:54:30,831
Or someone.

270
00:54:43,632 --> 00:54:45,632
Mister Butterfly.
[Signor Farfalla.]

271
00:54:54,157 --> 00:54:57,092
You don't have to act.

272
00:54:57,093 --> 00:55:00,093
Act?

273
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:01,930
You might have to
with other clients,

274
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:04,366
but you don't
have to with me.

275
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:07,303
I want you to be
exactly who you are.

276
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:10,304
I came here to get pleasure,
not to give it.

277
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:25,485
Maybe I pretend very well.

278
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:37,264
You give me more tips
than the other girls get.

279
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:43,036
I don't sleep
with the other girls.

280
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:40,522
Hi, Mister Butterfly.
[Ciao, Signor Farfalla.]

281
00:57:40,523 --> 00:57:42,424
How are you?
Good, thank you.

282
00:57:42,425 --> 00:57:44,293
This is my friend Anna.

283
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:45,461
Hi.

284
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:47,729
Pleasure, Anna.
[Piacere, Anna.]

285
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:50,599
Do you want to join
me for some coffee?

286
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:53,600
We're going to see an American
movie. Anna's learning English.

287
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:57,804
I would love to
go to America.

288
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:01,808
But perhaps we can
see each other soon?

289
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:05,614
On Wednesday I'm free.

290
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:07,716
Okay, I'll be there.

291
00:58:07,717 --> 00:58:10,619
Where?

292
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:13,255
Our usual place?

293
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:15,491
Our usual place.

294
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:18,492
I forgot.
Where is our usual place?

295
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:31,607
Let's go someplace new.

296
00:58:31,608 --> 00:58:34,608
You can decide.

297
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,314
Locanda Grapelli?
Great!

298
00:58:39,315 --> 00:58:41,850
Locanda Grapelli,
good food.

299
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,652
Mmm-hmm. Grapelli.

300
00:58:43,653 --> 00:58:45,654
See you there?
I'll see you there.

301
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:48,655
At 8:00?
At 8:00.

302
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:51,727
Goodbye, Mister Butterfly.
[Arrivederci, Signor Farfalla.]

303
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:54,728
Anna, it's nice
to meet you.

304
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:22,120
Another two prostitutes murdered.

305
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:20,173
Fuck.

306
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:09,351
Yeah?

307
01:03:09,352 --> 01:03:12,087
The Swedes found me.

308
01:03:12,088 --> 01:03:13,722
Stay put.

309
01:03:13,723 --> 01:03:15,056
Finish the job.

310
01:03:15,057 --> 01:03:18,057
How the fuck did they know
I was here?

311
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:21,795
Because you've lost
your edge, Jack.

312
01:04:43,279 --> 01:04:45,113
Good morning.
[Buongiorno.]

313
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:46,982
You're up early!

314
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:49,983
I needed some air.

315
01:04:50,253 --> 01:04:52,454
I walk here to meditate.

316
01:04:52,455 --> 01:04:57,555
I thank God for certain
favors he has granted me,

317
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:03,261
and I ask him to look after those
of my friends who are sinners.

318
01:05:07,303 --> 01:05:09,504
All men are sinners.

319
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:12,407
Some are greater sinners
than others.

320
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:14,910
But those who seek peace

321
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:17,911
have much sinning
in their history.

322
01:05:18,614 --> 01:05:20,582
Maybe.

323
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:24,483
Forgive me, this is the
priest in me speaking, but

324
01:05:26,355 --> 01:05:30,455
you have done much
sinning, Signor Clarke.

325
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:33,593
And you still do.

326
01:05:35,831 --> 01:05:39,531
Something happened
here last night.

327
01:05:42,004 --> 01:05:44,873
Everything I've done,
I've had good cause to do.

328
01:05:44,874 --> 01:05:46,374
Do you wish to tell me?

329
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:48,677
To confess?
Yes.

330
01:05:48,678 --> 01:05:50,145
For what reason?

331
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:52,247
For your own sake.

332
01:05:52,248 --> 01:05:53,982
Perhaps I can
pray for you?

333
01:05:53,983 --> 01:05:56,952
Perhaps.

334
01:05:56,953 --> 01:06:01,053
I wonder how many bastards
have been made here.

335
01:06:04,593 --> 01:06:07,228
You work in metal.

336
01:06:07,229 --> 01:06:10,229
You were given some steel
by Fabio, the car doctor.

337
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:16,102
Where was he
conceived, Father?

338
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:18,807
Fabio, the car doctor.

339
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:21,808
Why do you ask me that?

340
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:24,978
You have each other's photos.
You have each other's eyes.

341
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:31,350
Was he conceived here, under the trees
at night, like all the other bastards?

342
01:06:33,689 --> 01:06:36,689
I do not remember, Signore.

343
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:41,327
It was many years ago.

344
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:47,500
In the end it is I
who confesses to you.

345
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:50,238
Do you want me
to do the same?

346
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:53,074
For your own good.

347
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:57,275
You cannot doubt the
existence of Hell. You live in it.

348
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:00,847
It is a place without love.

349
01:07:00,983 --> 01:07:03,983
Perhaps I have no right
to wear these robes.

350
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:09,221
But I do have a heart
full of a father's love.

351
01:07:10,326 --> 01:07:13,326
Something close
to his heart!

352
01:07:15,097 --> 01:07:18,997
And for that I am
both grateful and happy.

353
01:07:24,907 --> 01:07:29,007
What do you have,
my friend?

354
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:17,090
Hi.
[Ciao.]

355
01:08:17,526 --> 01:08:20,526
I was not sure
you were coming.

356
01:08:21,063 --> 01:08:22,697
I wasn't sure
you meant me to.

357
01:08:22,698 --> 01:08:25,698
Of course yes.
[Certo che si.]

358
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:32,841
Good evening.
[Buonasera. Buonasera. Buonasera.]

359
01:08:32,842 --> 01:08:34,676
Thank you.
[Grazie.]

360
01:08:34,677 --> 01:08:37,412
Here you are. Thank you.
[Prego. Grazie.]

361
01:08:37,413 --> 01:08:40,215
Thank you.
[Grazie.]

362
01:08:40,239 --> 01:08:43,839
Can you bring us a bottle of mineral water,
and Montepulciano d'Abruzzo...

363
01:08:43,863 --> 01:08:45,020
English menu?

364
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:46,021
No, thank you.
[No, grazie.]

365
01:08:46,045 --> 01:08:47,745
German? Dutch?

366
01:08:48,169 --> 01:08:49,869
Gentleman speaks Italian as good as me.

367
01:08:50,193 --> 01:08:54,193
I repeat, a bottle of mineral water,
and Montepulciano d'Abruzzo.

368
01:08:56,917 --> 01:08:58,917
- Carbonated?
- Non carbonated.

369
01:09:02,841 --> 01:09:03,841
Small town people...

370
01:09:20,623 --> 01:09:23,623
Can I ask you something?
Sure.

371
01:09:27,429 --> 01:09:30,429
Are you married?

372
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,500
No.

373
01:09:36,438 --> 01:09:38,806
I was sure
this was your secret.

374
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:41,807
Why do I have
to have a secret?

375
01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:46,746
You're a good man,
but...

376
01:09:47,283 --> 01:09:50,283
...you have a secret.

377
01:09:53,756 --> 01:09:55,356
Excuse me.
[Mi scusi.]

378
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:57,025
No, no, really.
[No, no, davvero.]

379
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,760
Thanks you. No.
[Grazie. No.]

380
01:09:58,761 --> 01:10:00,495
He thinks
we are a couple.

381
01:10:00,496 --> 01:10:01,696
That's okay.

382
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:02,697
Thank you.
[Grazie.]

383
01:10:03,298 --> 01:10:05,298
Thank you.
[Grazie.]

384
01:14:32,067 --> 01:14:33,601
Ready.
[Pronto.]

385
01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:36,602
I need some more time.

386
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:39,407
You're testing my patience.

387
01:14:39,408 --> 01:14:42,408
Just give me
a few more days.

388
01:14:44,112 --> 01:14:47,112
You'll get two days,
then you make a drop.

389
01:15:33,228 --> 01:15:35,029
Hi.
[Ciao.]

390
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:38,030
Hi.
[Ciao.]

391
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:46,908
Where we go?

392
01:15:46,909 --> 01:15:48,976
Someplace beautiful.

393
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,200
Are we going on a picnic?

394
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:54,982
A picnic.

395
01:15:54,983 --> 01:15:57,983
Yeah. A picnic.

396
01:15:58,487 --> 01:16:01,022
I have to practice
my English.

397
01:16:01,023 --> 01:16:04,023
Today, we are going
to have a picnic.

398
01:16:05,661 --> 01:16:08,661
It is a beautiful day.

399
01:16:38,226 --> 01:16:40,962
Where we go?

400
01:16:40,963 --> 01:16:43,963
You'll see.

401
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:53,439
I think it's good
we stay close to the road.

402
01:16:54,009 --> 01:16:57,009
Don't worry. I've been this way
many times taking photographs.

403
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:17,164
Only you come here?

404
01:17:17,165 --> 01:17:20,165
Yes.

405
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:33,981
Wow.

406
01:17:34,005 --> 01:17:35,905
Like a paradise, here.
[Come paradiso, qui.]

407
01:17:47,295 --> 01:17:49,296
I'm going to swim
in the water.

408
01:17:49,297 --> 01:17:50,631
You come?

409
01:17:50,632 --> 01:17:53,367
It's cold.

410
01:17:53,368 --> 01:17:56,368
Maybe.

411
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,880
Come!

412
01:18:10,052 --> 01:18:13,052
Come, Mr. Farfalla.

413
01:18:13,155 --> 01:18:16,155
It's beautiful, no?

414
01:18:22,931 --> 01:18:25,931
We make love
in the water?

415
01:18:30,806 --> 01:18:33,040
What's wrong?

416
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:34,308
We should have our lunch.

417
01:18:34,309 --> 01:18:37,309
Ah! Ah.

418
01:18:39,347 --> 01:18:42,316
Look. It's a bullet.

419
01:18:42,317 --> 01:18:43,784
Maybe the hunters
are here.

420
01:18:43,785 --> 01:18:46,785
I don't think so.

421
01:18:49,024 --> 01:18:52,024
I'm cold.

422
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:21,120
Edward.

423
01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:24,890
Is that your real name?

424
01:19:46,815 --> 01:19:49,815
Will you put this
behind me?

425
01:19:54,055 --> 01:19:57,055
What?

426
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:00,294
What?

427
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:01,700
What's wrong?

428
01:20:06,467 --> 01:20:08,002
Nothing.

429
01:20:21,116 --> 01:20:22,950
Thank you.
[Grazie.]

430
01:20:22,951 --> 01:20:25,951
I just don't understand what the
hell you're doing with a gun.

431
01:20:26,054 --> 01:20:27,788
A friend of mine
give to me.

432
01:20:27,789 --> 01:20:30,357
The two prostitutes were
killed in Pescara, all right?

433
01:20:30,358 --> 01:20:32,660
Did you see what
they do to them?

434
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:34,795
The police showed me
the photographs.

435
01:20:34,796 --> 01:20:36,330
I want to feel safe
with clients.

436
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:37,998
Does it make you
feel safe with me?

437
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:39,233
You're not a client.

438
01:20:39,234 --> 01:20:40,534
Then why is it
in your bag?

439
01:20:40,535 --> 01:20:43,535
Because I work tonight.

440
01:20:57,519 --> 01:20:59,720
There's a processione.

441
01:20:59,721 --> 01:21:01,522
A procession?

442
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:04,523
Yes. Tomorrow.

443
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:08,160
In Castel del Monte.

444
01:21:08,597 --> 01:21:11,597
We go to this together?

445
01:21:11,633 --> 01:21:13,467
Maybe.

446
01:21:13,468 --> 01:21:16,468
Really?

447
01:21:16,571 --> 01:21:18,405
And after...

448
01:21:18,406 --> 01:21:20,708
After that,
after tomorrow,

449
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:23,709
and the next day...

450
01:21:23,812 --> 01:21:26,812
I can't stay
forever, Clara.

451
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:37,324
It's time to go home.

452
01:21:37,325 --> 01:21:40,325
Take me home with you
I can't.

453
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:08,587
Stay forever.

454
01:22:30,878 --> 01:22:32,680
Yeah?

455
01:22:32,681 --> 01:22:35,681
I'll make the delivery
and then I'm out.

456
01:22:39,387 --> 01:22:42,387
Pavel?

457
01:22:46,561 --> 01:22:49,463
Okay, Jack.

458
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:52,464
You're out.

459
01:23:29,804 --> 01:23:30,637
Hello?

460
01:23:30,638 --> 01:23:33,638
Now, you listen
to me carefully.

461
01:26:25,513 --> 01:26:27,915
One coffe.
[Una caffè.]

462
01:26:28,416 --> 01:26:30,116
Two.
[Due.]

463
01:26:40,695 --> 01:26:42,796
I see you've brought
it in with you.

464
01:26:42,797 --> 01:26:45,797
Everything's here
as we agreed.

465
01:26:46,501 --> 01:26:49,403
What's this?

466
01:26:49,404 --> 01:26:52,404
Candy for your trip.

467
01:26:57,111 --> 01:27:00,111
I thought you might
have a sweet tooth.

468
01:27:04,018 --> 01:27:07,018
That's very kind of you.

469
01:27:14,295 --> 01:27:17,295
I guess I'll be reading
about this in the Tribune.

470
01:27:20,401 --> 01:27:22,836
Yes.

471
01:27:22,837 --> 01:27:25,837
I expect so.

472
01:27:44,058 --> 01:27:46,658
I'm just going to
the ladies, wait here.

473
01:28:52,193 --> 01:28:53,293
Okay?

474
01:28:53,294 --> 01:28:54,961
I'm fine. You?

475
01:28:54,962 --> 01:28:56,930
Just fine.

476
01:28:56,931 --> 01:28:58,965
You won't need your gun.

477
01:28:58,966 --> 01:29:01,966
You never know.

478
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:18,950
Final payment.

479
01:29:22,623 --> 01:29:24,524
Buy yourself
a retirement clock.

480
01:29:50,651 --> 01:29:53,651
Goodbye, Mr. Butterfly.

481
01:30:46,073 --> 01:30:48,008
Hello?

482
01:30:48,009 --> 01:30:49,843
What happened?

483
01:30:49,844 --> 01:30:52,844
There wasn't
the opportunity.

484
01:30:52,947 --> 01:30:54,414
Find one.

485
01:30:54,415 --> 01:30:57,415
I'm following
him now.

486
01:32:41,622 --> 01:32:43,590
Boo!

487
01:32:49,997 --> 01:32:52,997
I was looking for you.

488
01:32:53,334 --> 01:32:55,569
I'm here.

489
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:57,470
What are you
doing tonight?

490
01:32:57,471 --> 01:32:59,606
I work tonight.

491
01:32:59,607 --> 01:33:02,607
Don't.

492
01:33:06,647 --> 01:33:09,647
If I ask you to come away
with me, would you?

493
01:33:09,917 --> 01:33:12,917
Come away with you?

494
01:33:13,054 --> 01:33:16,054
Why not?

495
01:33:19,994 --> 01:33:21,761
Together?
Together.

496
01:33:21,762 --> 01:33:23,196
Forever?

497
01:33:23,197 --> 01:33:24,464
Forever.

498
01:33:29,704 --> 01:33:31,204
I love you.
[Io ti amo.]

499
01:33:31,205 --> 01:33:32,305
Love you.
[Ti amo.]

500
01:33:32,306 --> 01:33:34,174
Love you.
[Ti amo.]

501
01:33:38,546 --> 01:33:41,546
I want you to take this
and meet me at the river.

502
01:33:41,782 --> 01:33:44,782
Eduardo.
Go! Go!

503
01:34:05,673 --> 01:34:08,673
Who do you work for?

504
01:34:08,976 --> 01:34:11,344
Who?

505
01:34:11,345 --> 01:34:14,345
Same man

506
01:34:14,715 --> 01:34:17,450
as you,

507
01:34:17,451 --> 01:34:18,752
Jack.

508
01:34:44,979 --> 01:34:47,979
I'm sorry, Father.

509
01:38:59,533 --> 01:39:01,968
Eduardo!

510
01:39:01,969 --> 01:39:04,037
Eduardo!
