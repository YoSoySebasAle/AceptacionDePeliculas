1
00:02:04,977 --> 00:02:05,900
He's lying.

2
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:07,836
I'll kill him!

3
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,110
He wanted me, too.

4
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:18,096
I'd do it again and again and again!

5
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,334
<i>Men, I hate the whole breed.</i>

6
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,794
<i>Never mind the speeches, let me alone.</i>

7
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,129
<i>He made me do it.</i>

8
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,797
<i>No, [have nothing to say.</i>

9
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,550
<i>Don't be so serious, Judge.</i>

10
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,635
<i>It's my funeral.</i>

11
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,094
Keeping me healthy to kill me.

12
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,929
I'm famous, Bavian.

13
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,348
The papers all hate me, don't they?

14
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:44,432
No, I'm not sorry.

15
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,559
One week more.

16
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,812
Six days... five days...

17
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:50,980
It goes fast, doesn't it?

18
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,607
Did you mail my letter to Paul Bavian?

19
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:57,111
Three more days, one for each man.

20
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,696
Why doesn't he come?

21
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,116
Why doesn't he come?
Why doesn't he come?

22
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,559
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

23
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:15,922
But Doctor, if you were trying to tell me
Ruth Rogen's insane, you're too late.

24
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,256
The courts have held otherwise.

25
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,384
I am not.

26
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:22,720
I am telling you she might be the cause
of other people going insane.

27
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,722
What do you mean?

28
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,934
Warden, have you ever noticed
that when a criminal is executed

29
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,937
for some unusual crime,

30
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:33,189
there is frequently an epidemic
of similar crimes?

31
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,816
Sure!

32
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,693
A lot of imitators.

33
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,176
I wonder.

34
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:44,701
I wonder if they are imitators.

35
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,869
Perhaps their will has been subdued.

36
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:51,290
Now, Doctor, just because you are
supposed to have psychic powers.

37
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,750
Just a moment, please.

38
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:56,295
Perhaps they've been possessed
by another personality,

39
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:02,635
a powerful and malignant personality
without, well, without a body of its own.

40
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,929
- Like Ruth Rogen?
- Precisely.

41
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,014
Like Ruth Rogen will be tomorrow.

42
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:10,393
Well, that's a very interesting theory,
Doctor, if you can prove it.

43
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:13,062
I'm not trying to convince you, Warden,
I only want you help.

44
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,815
Well, what do you want of her body
after the execution?

45
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:18,818
I've been experimenting lately
with mitogenic rays.

46
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:22,697
- What are they?
- Ultraviolet rays given off by the body.

47
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:27,577
Now, if my experiments are correct,
I might be able to prevent her personality

48
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:31,539
from escaping after death
and committing other crime.

49
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,040
But why Rogen?

50
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,835
She's a proper remarkable subject.

51
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,421
So notorious a criminal should,
I imagine, have quite a number

52
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:43,551
of what you would call imitators.

53
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:47,138
Now, here's my point, Warden.

54
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:50,808
If there are no similar crimes committed,

55
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:54,729
well, I should at least have negative proof
that my theory is correct.

56
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:57,398
Hmm.

57
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:01,652
Seems sort of creepy, when you think of it.

58
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:04,530
Well, we'll see what we can do.

59
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,199
- Have to get her permission, of course.
- Naturally.

60
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,742
She's rather difficult to handle.

61
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,952
- You'd better let me do most of the talking.
- All right.

62
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,746
Come on.

63
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,332
Let me alone. Let me alone, I tell you.

64
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:16,233
Can't I have any peace?

65
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,656
Get out! Get out of here!

66
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,677
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,388
I thought it might interest you.

68
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:34,310
Nothing's going to interest me
except a message from the governor.

69
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,104
And I won't get that.

70
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,213
No.

71
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,925
I'm afraid you won't.

72
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:47,490
You have nothing to
lose by doing what I ask.

73
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,618
No, and nothing to gain.

74
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:52,328
Listen to me, my body's my own.

75
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,288
The law gives me that much.

76
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:57,792
Take my body away
and then guarantee I can have it forever.

77
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:59,418
Funny, isn't it?

78
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,337
You do the laughing.

79
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,631
I'm offering you a chance
to do something for humanity.

80
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,132
Humanity!

81
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,510
There's only one of them
I want to do anything for.

82
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,096
Just one.

83
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,765
I wrote for him to come here,
but he's too smart.

84
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:16,435
The doctor may be giving you
a chance for even that.

85
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,145
I suppose he can bring me back
after I'm dead.

86
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,605
No, no, no, I didn't say that, I'm...

87
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,775
Well, you can't tell what he'll do.

88
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,486
Dr. Houston is one of
the world's greatest psychologists.

89
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,637
He's too modest to tell you everything.

90
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,311
If I thought I could come back
and walk around and talk...

91
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:39,625
...if I could use my hands,

92
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:43,004
if I could use my hands
just for a few minutes...

93
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:46,424
You have nothing to lose, Ruth.

94
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,742
No, I have nothing to lose.

95
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,537
Nothing to lose.

96
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:56,374
I'll send you a paper to sign.

97
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:25,231
Here.

98
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:05,664
Been to see her in jail, Mr. Bavian?

99
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,625
No.

100
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:10,211
- Well, look...
- Be careful.

101
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:11,796
Don't do that.

102
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,423
You're a heartless man, Mr. Bavian.

103
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:18,636
I wouldn't treat a dog
the way you treated her.

104
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,514
Not that it's any of my business.

105
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,057
It certainly isn't.

106
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:26,769
Just the same,
I know what goes on in my house,

107
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:30,815
and if any man treated me
the way you treated her,

108
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,983
- I'd have shotten him.
- Stop it. You've been drinking.

109
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,152
What if I have?

110
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,530
I'm thinking of that poor girl.

111
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:41,200
She's waiting there, waiting in jail,

112
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:45,538
to the death chair waiting for them
to come and fetch her.

113
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:48,749
Go to bed, you'll sleep it off.

114
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,192
You're no gentleman.

115
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:27,729
Oh, there are all of my pets out again.

116
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,192
Oh!

117
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,817
Why don't you clean the transom
once in a while?

118
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,485
Then you can see more clearly.

119
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,905
Well, I just looked in because I thought,
why, you might have been in bed.

120
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,157
What do you want?

121
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,533
There's a letter for you.

122
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,018
Why, it's been here the whole afternoon.

123
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,925
It's from the poor creature.

124
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,510
How do you know?

125
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,578
The handwriting!

126
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,446
This is a lie.

127
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,656
Her finger marks were found on his throat.

128
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,909
She must be crazy,
why should I tell the police?

129
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:55,245
She may be crazy, but you're not!

130
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,373
What do you mean?

131
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:03,736
You're not going to get within reach
of those hands of hers, are ya, dearie?

132
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,269
Roma.

133
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,562
Can I do anything?

134
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,963
No, thanks, Grant.

135
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,926
Better alone for a while, Grant.

136
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,787
Well, that's over.

137
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,582
How about a little snack?

138
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:24,442
I starved all through the funeral.

139
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:33,385
Grant, we've got to do something
to help Roma.

140
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,429
I know we have, Doctor.

141
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:37,306
What about a trip? A sea trip?

142
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,309
Fine, we can take the yacht!

143
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,145
- What about Bermuda?
- Yes.

144
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:47,381
Say,
have you ever eaten truffles in Bermuda?

145
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,986
No, I can't say I have.

146
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,905
Oh, Schmitt?

147
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:56,116
Schmitt? Schmitt?

148
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,328
Yes, sir?

149
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,830
Tell Henri to fry me some truffles.

150
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:06,293
- Truffles, sir?
- With butter and cinnamon.

151
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:07,735
Very good, sir.

152
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,634
Hello, King.

153
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,997
Sure you won't have anything?

154
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,356
No, thanks.

155
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:14,921
It seems strange that I should get back
just in time to see him die.

156
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,965
Long trip from South America.

157
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,033
I guess you had a reason for it.

158
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:23,347
Did you ask her yet?

159
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:24,723
Ask her what?

160
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,684
Well, to marry you, of course.

161
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,811
After what's happened?

162
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,271
Why not?

163
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,464
Might be the best thing for her.

164
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,892
<i>Ladies and gentlemen!</i>

00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,186

Excuse me, Miss Courtney,

00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:01,385
<i>♪ So lay your head on my shoulder, dear ♪♪</i>

179
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,440
Well, that closes that case.

180
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:42,110
Say, Doc, this paper says
you were at the execution

181
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,487
of that Rogen woman this morning.

182
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:44,738
<i>I was.</i>

183
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:48,265
It says she insisted you walk
to the death chamber with her.

184
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,229
Guess she had a crush on you.

185
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,776
It's a good thing
you didn't meet sooner, eh, Doc?

186
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:04,382
Tell me, Doctor, was she really crazy?

187
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:08,470
Grant, I believe she was quite sane,

188
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:11,932
but undoubtedly one of the most
dangerous women in criminal history.

189
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:14,851
Well, she's not dangerous anymore.

190
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,229
No?

191
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:22,567
She may be more dangerous now
than when they had her locked in a cell.

192
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:25,803
Oh, now listen, Doc, that's too much.

193
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,449
Ooh, hello, Roma.

194
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:32,577
What's this?

195
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,163
The first of the vultures.

196
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,541
Well, I'm not surprised.

197
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,751
There will be a regular campaign
to get your money,

198
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,587
but I have other plans for it.

199
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:47,133
Paul Bavian, Spiritualist.

200
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,970
- Fraud!
- Why are you so sure?

201
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:55,600
Now listen, Roma, this fellow is
simply playing on your misfortune.

202
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:58,436
Why, it's a business with him.

203
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:03,149
Doctor, do you believe I could talk to John
if I gave him the chance?

204
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:08,697
Roma, my dear,
life does continue after death.

205
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,699
There's not a doubt of it.

206
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:17,330
But communication, well,
that's a different matter, unfortunately.

207
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:18,915
Why, of course.

208
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,959
John can't talk.

209
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:24,069
Here, I'll put an end to this right now.

210
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:30,427
Say, look here, Mr. Baboon,
or whatever your name is,

211
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:33,346
- my name's Hammond.
- What's that?

212
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,682
<i>Hammond!</i>

213
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:41,479
<i>If that doesn't mean anything to you,
I'm the manager of the Courtney Estate.</i>

214
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,608
I understand, yes.

215
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:47,110
<i>And you're not going to get one cent
from this estate,</i>

216
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,446
<i>not while I'm alive and running it!</i>

217
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,031
<i>You understand?</i>

218
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,616
Perfectly.

219
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,786
<i>Oh, I know your game,
widows and orphans, eh?</i>

220
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,456
<i>Well, now, just let me tell you...</i>

221
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,567
Hello? Hello? Hello?

222
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,839
Thank you for everything, Doctor.

223
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:11,843
Anything, any time.

224
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,219
I'll see you to the door, Doctor.

225
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:16,163
- Thanks.
- Excuse me, Roma.

226
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,768
Hello?

227
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,836
Grant,
I've been thinking about that letter.

228
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,090
You heard what Nick and the doctor said.

229
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:53,927
Dr. Houston said there was an afterlife.

230
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:56,388
I'm going to that medium.

231
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:59,849
Roma, you're only making things
harder for yourself.

232
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:02,060
I don't care.

233
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,521
Will you go with me?

234
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:06,255
Of course, I will.

235
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,911
I just dropped in to see
if you got your phone message.

236
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,455
Yes, I did, thank you very much.

237
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,999
Now drop out again.

238
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:11,713
Miss Roma Courtney is calling on you
at half past nine.

239
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,655
Ain't that nice?

240
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:18,595
You ain't going to forget
your old landlady, are you?

241
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:20,430
- Never.
- Is that a promise?

242
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:23,975
Absolutely. Now get out, and hurry,
I have a lot of work to do, come.

243
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,769
Work to do, eh?

244
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:29,147
Yes, I suppose you've got
to get all your wires in order

245
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:31,775
so that you can give her
a fake message from her brother.

246
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,383
Fake message?

247
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,640
Fake message, huh?

248
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,790
What do you mean by that?

249
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:48,792
I know all about Miss Courtney.

250
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:53,630
Poor thing, with all her sorrow,
she doesn't know what she's doing.

251
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:59,928
I think I ought to tell her,
as one woman to another.

252
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:02,013
She's got a lot of money.

253
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,515
She'll never miss it.

254
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:05,183
How much are you going to get?

255
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:08,686
Enough for both of us, eh, dearie?

256
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,438
So you're going to try blackmail, ah?

257
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,440
- Now is that nice?
- Blackmail?

258
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:16,152
Oh, no, dearie,
I wouldn't do anything dishonest.

259
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:22,224
With all I know about you,
I wouldn't tell the police we're partners.

260
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,103
Partners, eh?

261
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:31,417
I knew I wouldn't have to force you,
dearie.

262
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,819
You're a gentleman!

263
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:38,574
Shake?

264
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,146
What'd you got in your hand,
you young devil?

265
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,232
Oh, it's all right.

266
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:56,633
It's only a scratch.

267
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:02,556
You wouldn't hurt an old friend,
would you, dearie?

268
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,898
It's only a joke, isn't it?

269
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:17,130
It's only a joke!

270
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:18,739
Joke!

271
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:34,338
Only a joke.

272
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,744
Thank you.

273
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,874
Mr. Wilson?

274
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,337
Many distinguished people
have signed this register.

275
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:05,822
You were very wise to come, Miss Courtney.

276
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:09,409
The invisibles who speak through my lips
have given me no peace.

277
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:12,078
Your brother John has been most persistent.

278
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:14,038
Are you sure?

279
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,457
Are you sure it is my brother?

280
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:19,919
Well, perhaps you'll be
the best judge of that yourself.

281
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,279
All right, we will.

282
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,842
What do we do now?

283
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:28,303
Mr. Wilson, if you will pardon me,

284
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:31,097
I'm very sensitive as
well as being psychic.

285
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:34,642
Hostility effects me the same
as static effects radio reception,

286
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,520
so if you'll pardon me,
for Miss Courtney's sake,

287
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,772
would you please keep an open mind?

288
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:43,735
- Please, Grant.
- All right, I'm sorry.

289
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,404
When I see it, I'll believe it.

290
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:49,848
Well, perhaps tonight, you may even see.

291
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:56,539
We were stupid to come, Roma.

292
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:59,917
- Why, this fella's a fake.
- Maybe.

293
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,818
I must be sure.

294
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:15,082
I must ask you, Mr. Wilson, to please turn
out this light when I go into a trance.

295
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:32,349
I must warn you, listen carefully,
the message may be brief.

296
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:45,612
I suppose that's my cue.

297
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:14,933
Hm.

298
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:29,924
Roma.

299
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,468
Can you hear me?

300
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:36,222
Listen, you must guard yourself.

301
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:38,850
Hammond wants our money.

302
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:41,561
He murdered me.

303
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:43,187
You are next.

304
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,672
John! John!

305
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,922
Roma, are you all right?

306
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:10,965
Did you see it?

307
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:11,800
It was John.

308
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:13,384
Yes, dear, I saw.

309
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,803
What happened?

310
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,513
You know what happened,
you cheap faker.

311
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:20,016
Almost scared her to death
with your phony tricks.

312
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,459
- Ms. Courtney.
- Grant, wait.

313
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,814
What happened?

314
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,924
I'll call you.

315
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,749
Mm, mhm.

316
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:46,107
Hm.

317
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,306
Ha-ha-ha.

318
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,766
"Cheap faker," eh?

319
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:04,793
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

320
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:44,433
This is the way to morning room.

321
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,418
He's probably gone to bed.

322
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:52,149
- Good evening.
- Reynolds, Dr. Houston in?

323
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,777
He's in the laboratory, Miss,
he can't be disturbed.

324
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:55,885
Please don't go in there!
Dr. Houston made strict orders.

325
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,806
You can't go in there, please!

326
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:22,245
We'd better wait outside.

327
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,793
Come on, we shouldn't be here.

328
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:36,444
Doctor!

329
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:38,345
Roma!

330
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,326
- What are you doing here?
- I'm sorry, we...

331
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,953
Get back, please!

332
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,413
Doctor...

333
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:49,415
That woman, she just moved.

334
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:51,584
No, dear.

335
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:53,544
She's dead.

336
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:56,714
It was merely a galvanic action.

337
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:58,299
Now, Roma, please go.

338
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:00,217
- No, I must talk to you.
- Not here, dear, please.

339
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,553
Well, doctor, what's the matter?

340
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:06,682
I've been conducting
a very trying experiment, Grant.

341
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:10,269
The woman in there
was Ruth Rogen.

342
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,771
You remember, the case.

343
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:13,522
Yes, I do.

344
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:16,901
Well it may sound crazy, but...

345
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:19,695
There's danger of contagion.

346
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,822
No, dear, not from the body.

347
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,949
That's harmless.

348
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:27,161
But there's...

349
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,372
there's something else.

350
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:31,457
Please.

351
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:33,441
Please, Roma.

352
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:41,258
Tell me, Roma, why did you
come here tonight?

353
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,844
We went to see
that Spiritualist, and...

354
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,930
and I saw John.

355
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:47,264
But it was all staged.

356
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,724
I've been trying
to convince Roma.

357
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,184
It couldn't have been.

358
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,727
I saw John and so did you,
and you know it.

359
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,772
Wait a moment, dear.

360
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,399
How do you know
it was staged, Grant?

361
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:58,567
He said John was murdered
by Hammond.

362
00:36:58,591 --> 00:36:59,902
Isn't that enough?

363
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,654
Murdered by Hammond?

364
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:03,364
That's absurd.

365
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:05,574
Roma, you don't believe
anything like that for a moment.

366
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,493
I don't know what to believe.

367
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:09,245
It was John talking, and...

368
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:11,497
Hammond was with him
when he died.

369
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:14,441
Oh, oh, I don't know.

370
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,674
Roma, dear girl, we've all known
Nicky Hammond far too long

371
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:23,867
to believe anything like that
without real proof.

372
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,054
Of course, the whole thing's a trick
to get money out of Roma.

373
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,306
I wonder if it is a trick.

374
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:32,101
Roma.

375
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:35,563
Invite him to your house
for another séance.

376
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:38,232
Then, if he should...

377
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,067
Well...

378
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,926
let's wait and see.

379
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,161
That's strange,
those windows are shut.

380
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:52,913
Mm, and cold as ice.

381
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,124
Roma, you must go at once!

382
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:57,668
I'll arrange for your séance.

383
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,420
What do you say
the name of this man was?

384
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,237
Paul Bavian.

385
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,182
Ohh.

386
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:14,042
Get out of here, Grant, quickly!

387
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:30,785
What are those marks?

388
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:31,994
Ruth Rogen.

389
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:34,330
She tried to get possession
of Roma's body.

390
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:36,773
Thank heaven she failed.

391
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,844
Hello, Sickle.

392
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:52,139
7-9-9-7-0.

393
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,475
Raymond.

394
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:56,811
This is Dr. Houston speaking.

395
00:38:56,835 --> 00:39:00,105
Will you please send immediately
for the body of Ruth Rogen?

396
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:02,233
Yes, I have finished.

397
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:04,217
At once, please.

398
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,410
Yes.

399
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,788
At Ms. Courtney's house?

400
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:17,373
At eight o'clock?

401
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:19,625
Tonight?

402
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:22,545
Yes, I understand,
I'll be there.

403
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:24,296
Yes.

404
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,656
Good bye.

405
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:49,280
Thank you,
now the contact is completed.

406
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:50,531
As you know,
spirit communication

407
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:53,450
may take any one of many forms.

408
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:54,869
Levitation,

409
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,954
moving lights, voices

410
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:58,664
raps, materialization,

411
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:00,666
or automatic writing.

412
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,544
In automatic writing,
the medium himself,

413
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:05,796
while in a trance,
writes the message.

414
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,049
Consequently, this method
may be open to question.

415
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,051
Independent writing,

416
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,804
the messages received
independently of the medium.

417
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,890
Consequently, tonight,

418
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,434
we will experiment
by this means.

419
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,895
But I warn you again,
I promise you nothing.

420
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:23,272
The invisible
that you wish to hear from

421
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,190
may not be able to reach me.

422
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,817
But if I succeed,

423
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,194
My reward lies in the knowledge
that I have been of service

424
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,488
to a gracious lady.

425
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:34,992
Also, I feel very flattered
that so eminent a scientist

426
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:37,119
such as Dr. Houston

427
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,662
would be present

428
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,789
at a Seance conducted by
someone with a person

429
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:44,376
as myself.

430
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,296
I would like to have a handkerchief
from you, if you please.

431
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,048
One of yours will do.

432
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:51,592
- Hm.
- Thank you.

433
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:54,911
It will eliminate any idea of trickery.

434
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:08,359
If you'll excuse me a moment,
I want to light the incense.

435
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:10,802
It will assist me in concentrating.

436
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:27,878
Would one of you be
good enough to turn out

437
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,612
the overhead lights?

438
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:35,827
This is gonna turn into a job.

439
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:35,172
What's this?

440
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:37,466
Ahh!

441
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:39,676
Yes.

442
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,428
Hey, look here.

443
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:44,681
You can't get away
with this, you know.

444
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,225
You think you can blackmail me?

445
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:47,726
Come on, get up.

446
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,978
- Get up, get up, get up!
- Hammond, control yourself.

447
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:52,523
- It won't do any good.
- It's all right.

448
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:54,691
Get him out of this house,
or I'll throw him out.

449
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,235
Well the whole thing's
ridiculous.

450
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:58,195
Nobody would believe
such a charge for a moment.

451
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:00,054
Doctor, quick, she's fainted!

452
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:04,118
Roma, Roma!

453
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:05,911
Grant, take her over
to the sofa.

454
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:08,020
Quick, quickly!

455
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,920
No, no, no, here.

456
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:17,113
I knew something like this
would happen.

457
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:11,626
Doctor,
what's the matter with her?

458
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:40,821
Dear.

459
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:47,161
Roma.

460
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:19,169
Thank you
for a wonderful séance.

461
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:21,171
Well it's a pleasure
to serve you.

462
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,215
The whole thing's
nothing but trickery.

463
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:25,759
Now get out!

464
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:28,053
You keep out of this.

465
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:30,222
Why...

466
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:31,765
Roma.

467
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,600
Dr. Houston, Dr. Houston!

468
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,394
- What?
- Something terrible has happened.

469
00:46:35,418 --> 00:46:37,020
It's Mr. Hammond.

470
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:39,630
- I think that he's dying.
- Dying?

471
00:46:45,094 --> 00:46:47,364
I think perhaps I'd better go.

472
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:50,016
Yes, let's both go.

473
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:01,444
Dead.

474
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:06,365
Come on.

475
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:16,810
- Where's Ms. Courtney?
- She's just leaving

476
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:19,003
- with that gentleman, sir.
- Leaving?

477
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,025
Roma, come back!

478
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:24,651
Roma!

479
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,445
2-9-3-5-4-4.

480
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:27,779
I've got the license number,
we can trace it.

481
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:30,848
- We've got to!
- Come on!

482
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:51,970
This... this isn't the place,
is it?

483
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:53,430
Yes.

484
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:55,998
Wait there for me.

485
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,531
- How much is this?
- Dollar and a half.

486
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,557
- Too much.
- Make it a dollar.

487
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:49,986
Well this can't be yours.

488
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,263
Of course it is.

489
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,080
Nice, isn't it?

490
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:01,772
Come in.

491
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:10,614
How did you know
about this place?

492
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:16,954
Belonged to a friend of mine.

493
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:27,441
Ruth Rogen.

494
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:30,569
Did you know her?

495
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:32,863
Why, yes, I did.

496
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:34,489
Oh interesting.

497
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:36,599
How well did you know her?

498
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:42,664
If you don't mind,
I'd rather not discuss that.

499
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:46,251
Why not, there's nothing
to be afraid of now, is there?

500
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:49,337
Why should I be afraid?

501
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:50,922
Some men were, I hear.

502
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:53,008
She told me of one.

503
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:55,534
So much afraid of her
he gave her away to the police.

504
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:59,306
Do you suppose he'd be
afraid now if he thought

505
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,016
Ruth Rogen were alive?

506
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,144
Why... no.

507
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:07,397
Suppose you were that man.

508
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:09,691
As a matter of fact, I was.

509
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:11,735
She threatened me,
she refused to give me up.

510
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:13,987
- And she meant it.
- I can believe that.

511
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,989
Ms. Courtney, how did you
ever come in contact

512
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:18,575
with such a woman?

513
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:21,578
Doesn't matter...
Why the formality?

514
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:23,038
All right, Roma.

515
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:24,939
That's better.

516
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:41,848
Do I remind you of her?

517
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,250
I don't know,
perhaps it's being in this room.

518
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:48,921
No, you are nothing like her.

519
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:03,745
Isn't she beautiful?

520
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,664
Yes, but repulsive.

521
00:51:05,688 --> 00:51:07,374
Like a...

522
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:11,461
female spider that kills her mate
when she's through.

523
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:14,113
She would have killed me too
if I hadn't gotten rid of her first.

524
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,825
You did get rid of her.

525
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:22,222
Aren't you lucky?

526
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:24,665
Lucky, yes, to be here with you.

527
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:31,147
You do care for me,
don't you, Roma?

528
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,632
Yes, haven't I shown you I do.

529
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:43,535
What do you mean
by coming in here?

530
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:45,662
What are you doing here?

531
00:51:45,686 --> 00:51:46,913
Get out.

532
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,207
- Get out of my house.
- This isn't your house.

533
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:50,542
- I'm in charge here.
- Get out and let me on.

534
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:51,918
Can't you get out!

535
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,128
Roma!

536
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:55,213
- Ah, you're crazy.
- Crazy, I'll kill you!

537
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:56,530
Roma!

538
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:01,386
- I'm sorry I lost my temper.
- Sorry?

539
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:03,680
- I'm going to call the police.
- Wait a minute.

540
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:05,557
Ruth Rogen was a friend of mine.

541
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:08,101
It's all right that we're here, Max.

542
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,936
How do you know my name?

543
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,771
I never saw you before.

544
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,189
Are you sure?

545
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:14,608
Yes.

546
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:16,776
I'm sure... get out!

547
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,278
Wait a minute.

548
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:20,280
I'm going to call the police.

549
00:52:20,304 --> 00:52:23,825
Let's go.

550
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:26,453
Where do we go?

551
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:29,164
Why not go aboard your yacht?

552
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:31,124
Yacht?

553
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:32,751
Ohh.

554
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:34,753
Oh yes.

555
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:36,111
Let's go.

556
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,466
Ha-ha-ha.

557
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:41,950
Ha-ha, ha-ha-ha.

558
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,681
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha-ha.

559
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,333
Are you sure we're alone?

560
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:14,793
Yes, there's no one aboard now.

561
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:16,652
Mm.

562
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:35,772
Let's have a drink first, Paul.

563
00:53:35,796 --> 00:53:37,899
Hm-hm-hm, all right.

564
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,359
Where... where's the bar?

565
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:41,176
Over there.

566
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,243
Mm.

567
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:49,643
Hm.

568
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:31,596
- Are you sure this is the place?
- Yes sir,

569
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,765
this is where I brought 'em.

570
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:36,166
- All right, wait for us.
- Okay.

571
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,064
Have you seen two people
come in here tonight?

572
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:43,066
- A man and a girl?
- Yeah, what about 'em?

573
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:44,984
- Where are they?
- Well how should I know?

574
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:48,446
I found them in Ruth Rogen's
apartment, and kicked 'em out.

575
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,865
- Ruth Rogen.
- What were they doing there?

576
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,158
They were drinking.

577
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,494
The girl stole the key
when I wasn't looking.

578
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:56,371
The girl?

579
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:58,206
Are you sure it was the girl?

580
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:00,124
Yeah.

581
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:02,836
Grant, I knew it.

582
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,879
It was the girl
who brought him here.

583
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:06,297
Roma couldn't have done it,

584
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:08,007
she didn't even know
about the place,

585
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:10,426
but the other one did.

586
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:14,097
The other one... did.

587
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:16,432
Grant, we've...

588
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:18,935
We've got to... find her.

589
00:56:18,959 --> 00:56:20,353
Doc!

590
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:22,188
- Give me a hand, will you?
- Well here, get him into

591
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,172
this chair here.

592
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,779
Doctor.

593
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:31,865
Take it easy now, don't worry.

594
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:34,742
It wasn't your fault.

595
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:37,352
We'll find Roma, I know we will.

596
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:07,692
That's it!

597
00:57:07,716 --> 00:57:10,111
Look after him,
and see that he gets home.

598
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:13,531
Sure, he'll get home.

599
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:15,557
But what about my boat?

600
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:32,884
Hm-hm-hm.

601
00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:34,802
Wonderful wine.

602
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:36,679
And right off your own boat.

603
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:39,766
Ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha.

604
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:41,959
- Yes.
- Ha-ha.

605
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:48,691
Hm-hmm.

606
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:50,944
What are you trying to do,
get me drunk?

607
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:52,737
No, why should I?

608
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:54,572
Exactly, why should you?

609
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:57,200
Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha.

610
00:57:57,224 --> 00:57:59,410
A beautiful girl like you,

611
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:01,329
I assure you, it isn't necessary.

612
00:58:01,353 --> 00:58:03,939
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

613
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:11,047
You know, Roma,

614
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:14,300
You're a lucky girl.

615
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:17,011
You have beautiful pearls.

616
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,888
You have a yacht.

617
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,223
And you have me.

618
00:58:20,247 --> 00:58:22,749
Ha-ha-ha.

619
00:58:30,716 --> 00:58:34,070
Why, Paul, what's the matter?

620
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:36,114
For a moment when you did that
you made me think...

621
00:58:36,138 --> 00:58:39,659
I thought we weren't
gonna talk about her.

622
00:58:39,683 --> 00:58:42,519
Somehow everything that you do
makes me think of her.

623
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:47,417
Hm, you're still afraid
of Ruth Rogen.

624
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:49,669
No, at times, I'm afraid of you.

625
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:51,421
Afraid of me?

626
00:58:51,445 --> 00:58:53,840
Why did you ever
take me to her place?

627
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:56,384
How did you ever
happen to know her?

628
00:58:56,408 --> 00:58:58,761
Why is it that sometimes
you look like her?

629
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,722
Answer me.

630
00:59:00,746 --> 00:59:02,581
You're imagining things.

631
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:15,135
I think we'd better go.

632
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:20,057
Just one last drink.

633
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:45,624
This isn't a new experience
being turned down by you.

634
01:00:04,476 --> 01:00:06,913
Erg, ugh.

635
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:08,581
Now do you recognize me?

636
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:10,333
I am Ruth Rogen.

637
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:13,669
I'm gonna kill you before I leave
this body you like so much.

638
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:15,362
Erg.

639
01:00:23,495 --> 01:00:27,916
Roma!

640
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:40,154
- Let me go, let me go!
- You don't know what you're doing.

641
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:43,241
- Let me go, get out of my way!
- Stop it!

642
01:00:43,265 --> 01:00:45,827
- Now you listen to me.
- Ha-ha-ha-ha.

643
01:00:45,851 --> 01:00:49,080
Ha-ha.

644
01:00:49,104 --> 01:00:51,958
All right, ha-ha-ha.

645
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:54,234
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

646
01:01:04,244 --> 01:01:05,996
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

647
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:10,125
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

648
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:32,772
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

649
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,705
Roma, darling.

650
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,845
Roma.

651
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:31,724
Wake up.

652
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,476
I am awake.

653
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:36,229
- What are we doing here?
- Well don't you remember?

654
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:39,023
- No.
- He Shangai'd ya, then you fell asleep.

655
01:02:39,047 --> 01:02:41,651
Ha-ha-ha, where are the others?

656
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:43,778
They left.

657
01:02:43,802 --> 01:02:45,345
Well I'm sorry.

658
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:48,932
Are you?
