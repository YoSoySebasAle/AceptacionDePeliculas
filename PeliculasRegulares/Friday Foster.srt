00:41:38,847 --> 00:41:40,248
AND THAT SOMEBODY IS
TRYING TO KILL YOU?

529
00:41:40,316 --> 00:41:41,583
SO YOU'RE OUT
OF THE SLAMMER.

530
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:43,085
I THOUGHT I WOULDN'T SEE YOU
UNTIL VISITING HOURS.

531
00:41:43,152 --> 00:41:44,586
HOW WAS THE BREAD
AND WATER?

532
00:41:44,653 --> 00:41:46,054
YOU GOT SOMETHING
FOR ME, COLT?

533
00:41:46,122 --> 00:41:47,522
THAT'S DEPENDING
ON WHETHER OR NOT

534
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:48,523
YOU DIDN'T SPEND UP
ALL YOUR MONEY

535
00:41:48,591 --> 00:41:50,192

AND BAIL BONDSMEN.

536

SOMETHING FOR YOU

537

TOMORROW.

538
00:41:53,462 --> 00:41:54,395
LIKE WHAT?

539
00:41:54,463 --> 00:41:55,664
LIKE A BUNCH OF FLOWERS

540
00:41:55,731 --> 00:41:57,566
SENT TO CLORIS BOSTON'S
FUNERAL FROM A NO-NAME FRIEND.

541

542
00:41:59,068 --> 00:42:02,303
TELL ME, DO YOU KNOW A FELLOW
NAMED DAVID LEE HART?

543
00:42:02,371 --> 00:42:04,739
THE SENATOR?

544
00:42:04,807 --> 00:42:07,091
CLORIS BOSTON HAD
A SENATOR STASHED AWAY?

545
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:10,194
SURE. CLORIS HAD QUITE
A FEW FRIENDS IN D.C.

546
00:42:10,262 --> 00:42:12,930
SHE WOULD FLY DOWN THERE
FOR THESE WEEKEND DATES.

547
00:42:12,999 --> 00:42:15,266
SOME BROTHER NAMED
FORD MALOTTE SET THEM UP.

548
00:42:15,334 --> 00:42:16,767
THAT'S A COINCIDENCE.
HE'S THE MAN--

549
00:42:16,835 --> 00:42:19,371
AND I USE THE TERM LOOSELY--
THAT I'M GOING TO SEE.

550
00:42:19,438 --> 00:42:20,805
ALL RIGHT.
WHEN DO WE GO?

551
00:42:20,873 --> 00:42:22,040

ANYPLACE.

552

THIS BLACK WIDOW THING,

THAT SHE WAS NOT DEALING.

557

THIS IS THE MAN THAT'S
BEEN TRYING TO KILL ME!

564

WITH FRIDAY.

568
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:51,068
BUT, MONK, NOW YOU SEE
WHY I HAVE TO GO TO D.C.?

569
00:42:51,237 --> 00:42:53,454

YOU COULD BE HURT
OR SOMETHING.

701
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:56,207
DANGER.

702
00:52:56,274 --> 00:52:58,209
YOU KNOW YOU LOVE ME.
WHERE'S THE INVITATION?

703
00:52:58,276 --> 00:52:59,910
THAT'S RIGHT.
THE INVITATION.

704
00:53:01,279 --> 00:53:03,214
OH, YOU DIDN'T.

705
00:53:03,281 --> 00:53:05,216
I GOT IT.

706
00:53:05,283 --> 00:53:07,218
HERE IT IS.

707
00:53:07,285 --> 00:53:10,787
YOU SCARED ME
FOR A MOMENT. OH, BOY.

708
00:53:12,623 --> 00:53:15,125
ARE YOU SURE THIS
IS GOING TO WORK?

709
00:53:16,794 --> 00:53:19,230
IT AIN'T THE SIZE
OF THE SHIP.

710
00:53:19,297 --> 00:53:21,165
IT'S THE MOTION
OF THE OCEAN.

711
00:53:21,233 --> 00:53:23,167
<i>WELL, WATCH THIS OCEAN.</i>

712
00:53:30,742 --> 00:53:34,678
MMM, MMM! MAN,
THAT'S SOME FINE LADY

713
00:53:34,746 --> 00:53:36,180
YOU WORKING FOR.

714
00:53:36,248 --> 00:53:38,349
SAY, MAN,
WHAT'S SHE INTO?

715
00:53:38,416 --> 00:53:40,517
OH, WELL,
SHE'S INTO, UH...

716
00:53:40,585 --> 00:53:42,853
WELL, YOU KNOW,
SHE'S, UH...

717
00:53:44,256 --> 00:53:45,689
DON'T BOTHER
TO ANNOUNCE US.

718
00:53:45,757 --> 00:53:48,259
JUST TELL MY HUSBAND
I'LL BE IN THE POWDER ROOM.

719
00:53:57,769 --> 00:54:00,704
YOU MUST BE THE REVEREND
NOBLE FRANKLIN.

720
00:54:00,772 --> 00:54:03,774
WHY, YES. MY, MY,

721
00:54:03,841 --> 00:54:06,377
YOU ARE AN ATTRACTIVE
YOUNG LADY.

722
00:54:06,444 --> 00:54:08,379
WHY, THANK YOU,
REVEREND FRANKLIN.

723
00:54:08,446 --> 00:54:10,814
OH, JUST CALL ME
NOBLE, SISTER.

724
00:54:10,882 --> 00:54:13,583
YOU SEE, I'M NOT ONE
TO STAND ON CEREMONIES.

725
00:54:13,651 --> 00:54:16,620
NOW, WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU?

726
00:54:16,687 --> 00:54:18,622
UH, OH, IT'S SO SILLY.

727
00:54:18,689 --> 00:54:20,157
SPEAK UP, SISTER.

728
00:54:20,225 --> 00:54:22,092
I'M A VERY
UNDERSTANDING MAN,

729
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,894
VERY UNDERSTANDING.

730
00:54:23,962 --> 00:54:26,997
YOU SEE, I'M A CHURCH REPORTER
FOR OUR NEWSLETTER,

731
00:54:27,065 --> 00:54:30,000
AND I WOULD LOVE TO DO A STORY
AND TAKE PICTURES OF YOU.

732
00:54:30,068 --> 00:54:32,169
NO PROBLEM AT ALL.
WHERE'S YOUR CAMERA?

733
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:34,889
YOU SEE, THAT'S JUST IT.
I FORGOT IT,

734
00:54:34,956 --> 00:54:36,223
AND I COULD JUST KICK
MYSELF FOR BEING SO--

735
00:54:36,291 --> 00:54:38,492
I SEE. DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

736
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:41,261
I CAN SET UP A SPECIAL
APPOINTMENT FOR YOU

737
00:54:41,329 --> 00:54:42,763
UP AT JERICHO.

738
00:54:42,831 --> 00:54:45,766
UH, JERICHO?
UH, WHERE'S THAT?

739
00:54:45,834 --> 00:54:48,002
THAT'S MY ESTATE,
MY MEDITATIVE RETREAT

740
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:50,237
UP THE RIVER.

741
00:54:50,305 --> 00:54:52,873
AND, UH, WE COULD
SPEND SOME TIME

742
00:54:52,941 --> 00:54:54,875
FOR, UH, PURPOSES.

743
00:54:54,943 --> 00:54:56,377
WELL, YOU KNOW,

744
00:54:56,445 --> 00:54:58,879
THEN AGAIN, REVEREND,
I'M NOT SO SURE.

745
00:54:58,947 --> 00:55:01,882
REVEREND FRANKLIN NOT ONLY
HAS A WAY WITH A PRAYER,

746
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:03,384
BUT BEAUTIFUL WOMEN,
AS WELL.

747
00:55:03,452 --> 00:55:05,386
I DON'T THINK
I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE.

748
00:55:05,454 --> 00:55:06,887
OH, YES.
SENATOR HART,

749
00:55:06,955 --> 00:55:09,923
I WANT YOU TO MEET
MISS FRIDAY FOSTER,

750
00:55:09,991 --> 00:55:13,427
A VERY, VERY PRETTY
CHURCH REPORTER.

751
00:55:13,495 --> 00:55:15,696
AND WHAT CHURCH ARE YOU
A REPORTER FOR?

752
00:55:15,764 --> 00:55:18,399
YOU SEE, SENATOR HART,
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY THE TRUTH.

753
00:55:18,467 --> 00:55:19,667
I REALLY CAME HERE
TO SEE YOU,

754
00:55:19,735 --> 00:55:21,535
REGARDING A MUTUAL FRIEND.

755
00:55:21,603 --> 00:55:24,638
I'M SORRY WE MISSED YOU
AT THE FUNERAL.

756
00:55:24,706 --> 00:55:26,206
FUNERAL? WHOSE?

757
00:55:26,274 --> 00:55:28,509
CLORIS BOSTON.

758
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:34,314
I THINK WE OUGHT TO GET
TO KNOW EACH OTHER BETTER.

759
00:55:34,383 --> 00:55:35,783
EXCUSE US, REVEREND.

760
00:55:35,851 --> 00:55:37,317
Reverend: SURE,

761
00:55:37,386 --> 00:55:39,820
AND YOU STILL
HAVE AN INVITATION

762
00:55:39,888 --> 00:55:41,822
TO COME UP TO JERICHO,

763
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:43,891
YOU FINE SISTER, YOU.

764
00:55:43,958 --> 00:55:46,394
YOUR FLOWERS WERE
A COMFORT TO CLORIS.

765
00:55:46,461 --> 00:55:48,896
IT WAS THE LEAST
I COULD DO.

766
00:55:48,963 --> 00:55:50,398
SHE WAS A FRIEND.

767
00:55:50,465 --> 00:55:51,899
JUST A FRIEND?

768
00:55:51,966 --> 00:55:54,902
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT
THE D.C. GRAPEVINE SAYS.

769
00:55:54,969 --> 00:55:56,904
A SMART GIRL LIKE YOU

770
00:55:56,971 --> 00:55:59,473
SHOULDN'T BELIEVE
IN GOSSIP, SHOULD YOU?

771
00:56:04,762 --> 00:56:06,696
EXCUSE ME, DAVID.

772
00:56:06,764 --> 00:56:08,698
I SPOKE
WITH THE CONGRESSMAN,

773
00:56:08,766 --> 00:56:11,701
AND HE HAS AGREED
TO THE MEETING.

774
00:56:11,769 --> 00:56:14,004
GOOD. UH,
FRIDAY FOSTER,

775
00:56:14,072 --> 00:56:16,040
THIS IS MY
EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT

776
00:56:16,107 --> 00:56:17,574
CHARLES FOLEY.

777
00:56:17,642 --> 00:56:19,109
MISS FOSTER.

778
00:56:19,177 --> 00:56:20,644
MR. FOLEY.

779
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:23,147
UH, CHARLES,
MISS FOSTER AND I

780
00:56:23,214 --> 00:56:25,149
ARE GOING
TO MY PLACE

781
00:56:25,216 --> 00:56:28,652
TO, UH, DISCUSS SOME
MUTUAL INTERESTS,

782
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:31,155
SO WATCH THE STORE,
WILL YOU?

783
00:56:31,222 --> 00:56:33,657
YES, SIR. NICE
MEETING YOU, MISS FOSTER.

784
00:56:33,725 --> 00:56:35,258
WHILE YOU'RE
IN WASHINGTON,

785
00:56:35,326 --> 00:56:38,345
IF I CAN BE OF ANY
ASSISTANCE WHATSOEVER,

786
00:56:38,413 --> 00:56:39,847
FEEL FREE TO CALL.

787
00:56:39,915 --> 00:56:42,817
WHEN YOU DO,
JUST ASK FOR CHARLEY.

788
00:56:42,884 --> 00:56:44,201
THANK YOU.

789
00:56:44,268 --> 00:56:46,303
I'LL REMEMBER THAT...
CHARLEY.

790
00:56:52,393 --> 00:56:53,994
Hart: AFTER
ONE DIVORCE

791
00:56:54,062 --> 00:56:56,330
AND 12 YEARS
IN WASHINGTON,

792
00:56:56,397 --> 00:56:59,399
ONE GETS TO KNOW
HIS PEOPLE.

793
00:57:01,569 --> 00:57:03,503
MORE BRANDY?

794
00:57:03,571 --> 00:57:07,007
<i>MORE BRANDY AND I MIGHT
LOSE ALL MY INHIBITIONS.</i>

795
00:57:07,075 --> 00:57:08,508
MAYBE WORSE.

796
00:57:08,576 --> 00:57:10,577
LOOK WHAT HAPPENED
TO CLORIS.

797
00:57:12,247 --> 00:57:14,514
CLORIS WAS ONLY A PAL.

798
00:57:14,582 --> 00:57:16,416
JUST A FRIEND.

799
00:57:18,419 --> 00:57:20,787
SO WE MADE IT
A FEW TIMES,

800
00:57:20,856 --> 00:57:22,857
BUT OUR RELATIONSHIP
WAS ONLY PHYSICAL.

801
00:57:25,193 --> 00:57:27,694
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

802
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:32,532
IF I COULD CHANGE IT,
I REALLY WOULD.

803
00:57:42,043 --> 00:57:45,545
WILL YOU BELIEVE ME?
TRUST ME?

804
00:57:47,382 --> 00:57:49,783
THEN YOU CAN START
TRUSTING ME.

805
00:57:49,851 --> 00:57:53,353
YOU CAN TELL ME
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON.

806
00:57:55,206 --> 00:57:56,724
OK.

807
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:01,595
FIND YOURSELF A CERTAIN
MR. BLAKE TARR,

808
00:58:01,663 --> 00:58:03,330
AND IT WILL ALL
COME AS CLEAR

809
00:58:03,398 --> 00:58:05,599
AS MONDAY'S WASH.

810
00:58:05,667 --> 00:58:09,186
I'M TOLD HE'S THE MAN
BEHIND IT ALL.

811
00:58:10,755 --> 00:58:15,158
NOW, WHY WOULD HE PLAN
HIS OWN ASSASSINATION?

812
00:58:15,226 --> 00:58:17,862
IT'S ALL PART
OF A BIG POWER PLAY

813
00:58:17,929 --> 00:58:19,346
TO MAKE YOU BELIEVE

814
00:58:19,414 --> 00:58:20,580
IT'S SOMETHING
IT ISN'T.

815
00:58:20,648 --> 00:58:23,017
AND WHAT'S
YOUR POWER PLAY?

816
00:58:23,084 --> 00:58:26,020
ARE YOU SOMETHING
YOU'RE NOT, TOO?

817
00:58:50,545 --> 00:58:53,513
NOW, WHAT WILL
ALL THE GOSSIPS SAY?

818
00:58:53,581 --> 00:58:59,253
OH, THEY WILL PROBABLY
SAY THAT I MADE LOVE

819
00:58:59,321 --> 00:59:01,021
TO ONE OF THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL WOMEN

820
00:59:01,089 --> 00:59:03,490
D.C. HAS EVER SEEN.

821
00:59:03,558 --> 00:59:06,126
YOU'RE VERY SURE
OF YOURSELF, AREN'T YOU?

822
00:59:06,194 --> 00:59:08,412
AREN'T YOU?

823
00:59:24,262 --> 00:59:25,812
WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT,

824
00:59:25,881 --> 00:59:28,349
IT'S JUST AS WELL
THE GIRL WASN'T KILLED.

825
00:59:28,416 --> 00:59:30,351
YOU REALLY
THINK SO, HUH?

826
00:59:30,418 --> 00:59:31,852
HERE YOU ARE, SIR.

827
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,354
I THOUGHT YOU SAID

828
00:59:33,421 --> 00:59:35,022
<i>SHE CAME FROM
GLANCE MAGAZINE.</i>

829
00:59:35,090 --> 00:59:36,523
I DID.

830
00:59:36,591 --> 00:59:38,359
IT SEEMS SHE CAME
TO WASHINGTON

831
00:59:38,426 --> 00:59:40,060
AND BLUFFED HER WAY
INTO THE RECEPTION

832
00:59:40,128 --> 00:59:43,197
SPECIFICALLY TO MEET
WITH SENATOR HART.

833
00:59:43,265 --> 00:59:45,232
IT SEEMS SHE TIED
THE MURDER OF HER FRIEND

834
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:47,234
TO THE SENATOR.

835
00:59:47,302 --> 00:59:50,204
DID THE SENATOR
TELL HER ANYTHING?

836
00:59:50,272 --> 00:59:51,705
NO.

837
00:59:51,773 --> 00:59:52,839
WELL, THAT'S GOOD,
ISN'T IT?

838
00:59:52,908 --> 00:59:55,342
DID SHE TELL THE
SENATOR ANYTHING?

839
00:59:55,410 --> 00:59:58,345
ONLY THAT SHE'D HEARD
ABOUT BLACK WIDOW.

840
00:59:58,413 --> 01:00:01,415
AREN'T YOU WORRIED
ABOUT THAT, CHARLES?

841
01:00:01,482 --> 01:00:05,235
THAT'S WHY I THINK
SHE CAN BE OF USE TO ME,

842
01:00:05,303 --> 01:00:07,504
IF THE SENATOR
WILL GO ALONG,

843
01:00:07,672 --> 01:00:10,123
AND I THINK HE WILL,
OR ELSE I'LL HAVE TO TELL HIM

844
01:00:10,592 --> 01:00:14,678
HOW THOSE THOUSANDS OF
CONTRIBUTORS TO HIS CAMPAIGN

845
01:00:14,745 --> 01:00:16,880
IS REALLY JUST
ONE BIG CONTRIBUTOR--

846
01:00:17,182 --> 01:00:18,398
ENOS HARTMAN GRIFFITH,

847
01:00:18,433 --> 01:00:21,869
WHO IS NOW WILLING
TO GO ALONG WITH ME.

848
01:00:21,936 --> 01:00:23,670
WELL, BY HERSELF,
SHE'S NOTHING,

849
01:00:23,738 --> 01:00:25,672
<i>BUT WITH GLANCE
MAGAZINE BEHIND HER,</i>

850
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:27,173
SHE MAY BE ABLE
TO HELP YOU

851
01:00:27,241 --> 01:00:28,909
FLUSH OUT BLAKE TARR.

852
01:00:28,976 --> 01:00:32,696
THE SENATOR HAS ALREADY
PUT A BUG IN HER EAR.

853
01:00:32,764 --> 01:00:36,199
HE SAID THAT BLAKE TARR
IS THE ONE THAT CAN TELL HER

854
01:00:36,267 --> 01:00:39,186
ABOUT THE MURDER
OF HER FRIEND CLORIS.

855
01:00:39,254 --> 01:00:41,688
WELL, HE'S CERTAINLY
RIGHT ABOUT THAT,

856
01:00:41,756 --> 01:00:42,923
ISN'T HE, CHARLES?

857
01:00:42,991 --> 01:00:44,942
BLAKE TARR
IS THE ANSWER

858
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:47,578
TO ALL OUR PROBLEMS,
MR. GRIFFITH.

859
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,698
WELL, THAT'S WHAT THE
SENATOR SAID, MR. RILEY.

860
01:00:51,766 --> 01:00:54,134
HIS OFFICE WOULD
GIVE US FULL COOPERATION.

861
01:00:58,273 --> 01:01:00,440
Colt: WHY DON'T YOU PUT
SOME SUGAR IN YOUR CEREAL?

862
01:01:00,508 --> 01:01:04,278
NAH...I DON'T
LIKE IT TOO SWEET.

863
01:01:05,513 --> 01:01:07,380
HEY, BLACKHAWK,
YOU GOT ANY MONEY?

864
01:01:07,448 --> 01:01:09,049
I'VE GOT BARRELS
OF IT. WHY?

865
01:01:09,117 --> 01:01:10,550
I GOT SOME
DYNAMITE PERFUME,

866
01:01:10,618 --> 01:01:12,052
OUT-OF-SIGHT WATCHES,

867
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:13,453
LADIES' LINGERIE,

868
01:01:13,521 --> 01:01:15,422
AND A WHOLE LOT
OF OTHER STUFF FOR SALE.

869
01:01:15,489 --> 01:01:16,957
SO NOW YOU'RE
HUSTLING, HUH?

870
01:01:17,025 --> 01:01:20,294
NOPE...STRICTLY
BLACK CAPITALISM.

871
01:01:20,361 --> 01:01:22,262
<i>Friday: IF GLANCE

01:28:27,770 --> 01:28:30,705
OH, COLT, LOOK
AT ALL THIS STUFF!

1216
01:28:30,773 --> 01:28:33,208
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN SO
MANY BEAUTIFUL THINGS?

1217
01:28:33,276 --> 01:28:34,709
MY GOD!

1218
01:28:34,777 --> 01:28:38,713
I BROUGHT YOU A LITTLE
SOMETHING, BUT, UH...

1219
01:28:38,781 --> 01:28:41,716
IT'S TOO LITTLE
AND TOO LATE.

1220
01:28:41,784 --> 01:28:45,220
OH, COLT. OH!

1221
01:28:45,288 --> 01:28:47,189
OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL!

1222
01:28:47,257 --> 01:28:48,774
IT'S CHEAP!

1223
01:28:50,292 --> 01:28:53,228
YOU KNOW, BETWEEN
SENATOR HART AND BLAKE TARR,

1224
01:28:53,295 --> 01:28:56,364
I FEEL LIKE, UH...
A LIGHTWEIGHT.

1225
01:28:56,533 --> 01:28:57,582
YOU SHOULD.

1226
01:28:57,918 --> 01:28:59,668
I'M GOING TO KILL HIM.

1227
01:28:59,735 --> 01:29:03,172
OH, COLT, BUT WHEN
IT COMES DOWN TO IT,

1228
01:29:03,239 --> 01:29:04,939
YOU'RE MY MAIN MAN.

1229
01:29:05,007 --> 01:29:06,441
SHALL WE GO?

1230
01:29:06,509 --> 01:29:07,942
BY ALL MEANS.

1231
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:09,744
I GOT THE CHARIOT
DOWNSTAIRS.

1232
01:29:09,812 --> 01:29:10,745
DINNER...

1233
01:29:10,813 --> 01:29:11,746
DANCING...

1234
01:29:11,814 --> 01:29:12,747
FLOWERS...

1235
01:29:12,815 --> 01:29:13,748
MOONLIGHT...

1236
01:29:13,816 --> 01:29:15,584
AND, UH...

1237
01:29:15,652 --> 01:29:17,186
Both: NO KIDS.
