1
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:24,060
( blowtorch sizzling )

2
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:34,570
Man: control, rescue team is
in the main service corridor.

3
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:36,197
control:
Affirmative, colonel.

4
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:38,783
- What's it look like in there?
- The main power is out.

5
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:42,370
- Switching to night vision.
- Man #2: Oh my dear God.

6
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:44,580
- Man #3: What the hell?
- control, we have massive

7
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:46,374
casualties over here.

8
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:49,377
control: confirmed. We expected
that when we saw the hull damage.

9
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:52,588
- Was it decompression?
- Negative on that, control.

10
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:55,049
lt almost looks like a wild animal
tore through the crew.

11
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:57,093
- Man #2: What the hell happened here?
- ( rapid beeping )

12
00:02:57,261 --> 00:03:00,221
- Sir, l'm showing four live ones.
- Four?

13
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,265
There's supposed
to be 137 crewmen.

14
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,267
Raiders never hit a ship
this big before.

15
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,853
- We should call in reinforcements.
- cut the chatter, marines.

16
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,646
Locate those life signs, Private.

17
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:10,690
They're in engineering.
Near the shock point core.

18
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:13,109
That's it then.
Lock and load, marines.

19
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:15,403
- ( explosion )
- Hey, look out!

20
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:17,613
- What's happening?
- The engines are firing.

21
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,991
How is that possible?

22
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:29,375
( whispering voices )

23
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,676
lt's over.

24
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:41,679
They're dead. Finally.

25
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:45,182
( sobbing )
lt's finished.

26
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,853
lt's not finished.
This is too big to end here.

27
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:50,897
We've been in contact
with a higher power.

28
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,983
God damn it! l've had enough
of your crazy shit, Stross.

29
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,943
You can't see because
you're not a true vessel.

30
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,820
Will you two shut the hell up?!

31
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,947
We still need to work
together, all right?

32
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:01,782
- We've got to get--
- Quiet.

33
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,285
- Listen. Do you hear that?
- ( banging )

34
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,454
Woman: Oh my God.

35
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:08,289
They've come for us.

36
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,625
lt can't be more of them.
We destroyed that damn thing.

37
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,793
l won't let them hurt her.

38
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:16,047
This is Abraxis Rescue Team.
ldentify yourselves.

39
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,132
- Thank God you're here.
- l knew they'd come.

40
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,594
l'm Dr. lsabel cho, chief medical officer of the USG
O'Bannon.

41
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,305
You just get away now. Nobody's taking my baby
away from me again.

42
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:25,640
Drop the weapon now!

43
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:29,143
- Nickolas, it's all right.
- Kuttner, don't do it.

44
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,687
- Put 'em down.
- No, please, you have no idea

45
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:34,482
- what we've been through.
- ( grunting )

46
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,193
They sent you, didn't they?

47
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:39,195
They think that they
can control this.

48
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:42,782
They are all fools. can't you see?
lt's already happening.

49
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,910
convergence is here.
We shall all be made whole!

50
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:47,495
Aggh!

51
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:52,833
Fools.

52
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:56,087
control, we've got one blue casualty
and four survivors in custody.

53
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,464
Bringing 'em in.

54
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,307
( mechanical whirring )

55
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,659
Man #1 : What the fuck do you think
really happened over there?

56
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,704
The bodies had these looks
on their faces like whatever

57
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,331
killed those people
drove 'em crazy first.

58
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,041
Man #2:
What's command saying?

59
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,919
Man #1 : command's treating the whole thing as a
navigational accident.

60
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,963
Accident my ass.

61
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:41,215
Man #3: lt almost looked like
they killed each other.

62
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:44,218
Man #1 : lf you ask me, something
went seriously fubar out there

63
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:47,638
and the big guys back home
are trying to cover their big fat ass--

64
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,682
Oh, excuse us.

65
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,892
We didn't see you.

66
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:56,022
They sent an interrogation unit
all the way out here?

67
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,065
Man #3: What kind of shit
did those bastards

68
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,693
from the O'Bannon get into?

69
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,821
l don't know,
but they are righteously fucked now.

70
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:12,413
Scans confirm the target
has been destroyed.

71
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,081
lt's unrecoverable.

72
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:17,418
Unfortunate,
but not a complete loss.

73
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:19,670
- What of the survivors?
- Only four, l'm afraid.

74
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:22,506
l'm informed our specialist
is among them.

75
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,426
Luckily, yes. We're prepping
for debriefing now, sir.

76
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:28,763
l am authorizing
enhanced interrogation techniques.

77
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,099
l see. Do you think that
will be necessary?

78
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:33,768
We don't have time for subtlety.

79
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:37,521
There have been questions raised
about what happened at Aegis 7.

80
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:41,358
When word of the O'Bannon gets out, people will
demand answers.

81
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,987
lf you can't provide them,
l shall be forced

82
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:48,449
to re-evaluate
my confidence in your abilities.

83
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:50,284
Of course, sir.

84
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:53,454
You have seven hours
before your ship docks at the Sprawl.

85
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:56,874
This situation needs
to be resolved by then.

86
00:06:57,042 --> 00:07:00,252
Yes, sir, l understand perfectly.

87
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,090
What are you standing
around for?

88
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,592
Have the first subject
brought in.

89
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,594
lt's time to go to work.

90
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,679
lt's everywhere,
all around us,

91
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,640
- inside us-- the patterns.
- Hey!

92
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:13,933
- Guards!
- l see it all now.

93
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,602
- Will somebody talk to me?
- Human life is only a passing phase.

94
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,146
l'm not supposed to be here.
Hey, is anybody out there?

95
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,315
God damn it,
somebody open this door.

96
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:24,068
lt's okay, Vivian.
Don't worry, pumpkin, we're safe now.

97
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:26,320
Everything's gonna be just fine.

98
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:29,406
Soon we'll be back with Mommy
and then we'll all be together.

99
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,659
Man: This is fucking crazy.

100
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:34,161
l mean, it just doesn't make
any goddamn sense.

101
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,413
We survived that horror show
back on the O'Bannon

102
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,458
just to be locked up here?
You know the reason we're in here

103
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,961
is because that fucking lunatic
shot a marine.

104
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:45,339
lf anybody should be
in here, it's him.

105
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:46,841
lt's okay, baby girl.

106
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:50,636
He's just a little scared.
Don't pay any mind.

107
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,388
l don't have anything to do
with this crazy bastard.

108
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:54,849
- l don't even know these people.
- Borges, will you calm down?

109
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,101
You're not helping matters.

110
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,019
They have deeper reasons
for detaining us

111
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,021
than Mr. Kuttner's outburst,
Mr. Borges.

112
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,691
There's a great design
behind everything that's happened.

113
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:05,276
And we're each a part of it now.

114
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:08,988
Seriously, am l the only one
who didn't go batshit crazy

115
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,031
back on that damn planet?

116
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,700
Stross is right about one thing.

117
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:15,202
We might have a problem.
l did a tour on one of these

118
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,454
with a med unit a few years ago.

119
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,040
We're on board
a government interceptor ship

120
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,252
in a holding cell
where they detain terrorists.

121
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,879
So what does that mean?

122
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,548
lt means the government
might want someone to blame

123
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,091
for what happened
on the O'Bannon.

124
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,552
And that will most certainly
be us, Alejandro.

125
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,888
This may well be the last time
we see each other.

126
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,681
Don't touch me!

127
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,933
lsabel, what's the matter?

128
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:41,812
Well, it's about fucking time.
What's going on?

129
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,231
- Why are you holding us here?
- Step back.

130
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,901
Hey hey hey,
take it easy.

131
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,778
- No problem here.
- Nickolas Kuttner,

132
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,447
- you will come with us.
- Huh-uh.

133
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:53,407
l'm not leaving my little girl.

134
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,409
Don't do that.
Let me talk to him, okay?

135
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,119
Get your hands off me!

136
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,496
l'm not letting you
take me away from her.

137
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:00,831
- ( electricity crackles )
- ( screams )

138
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,918
Stop. Stop it!
He's had enough.

139
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,586
You'll kill him.

140
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:14,470
- What the hell is going on?
- l don't know.

141
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,316
( whispering voices )

142
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,378
Let me go, God damn it.

143
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,421
She needs me.
You bastards, can't you see her?

144
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,298
- ln the chair, if you please.
- She's right there.

145
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:54,510
- ( electricity crackles )
- ( screams )

146
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:57,137
No no, she needs me.
l have to protect her.

147
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,014
She needs her father.

148
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,350
No no, Vivian, Vivian!

149
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,269
Let me go!
Let me go!

150
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,938
Mr. Kuttner, please calm yourself.
We have some questions.

151
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:09,024
l'm not telling you shit
until l see my daughter.

152
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:12,236
Mr. Kuttner,
the mind holds

153
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:15,990
countless rational
and irrational fears.

154
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:19,118
For you, the fear
is being burned alive.

155
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,662
- ( beeps )
- ( gasps )

156
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:27,543
No! No!
( screaming )

157
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,967
( panting )

158
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,347
That was simply an electronically induced
hallucination,

159
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:44,268
created in the brain,
but the mind is reality,

160
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:46,645
is it not?

161
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,605
State your name and occupation.

162
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:52,026
Nickolas Kuttner, ex-marine,

163
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,988
security officer
on the cDc O'Bannon.

164
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,740
What the hell do you want
from me?

165
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,701
You are not here
to ask questions, Mr. Kuttner.

166
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,203
We are going to ask the questions.

167
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:06,206
You are going to answer them

168
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:09,376
honestly and completely.

169
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,337
Do you understand?

170
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,422
Yeah, l understand.

171
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,175
We want you to start
from the beginning.

172
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,093
We want you tell us

173
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:21,221
about the mission to Aegis 7.

174
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,390
Aegis 7.

175
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:26,310
The O'Bannon got word
to ship out about a week ago.

176
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:30,314
We were ordered to Titan, where we picked up a
team of civilian tech heads.

177
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:33,567
Mission specs were sealed
so nobody knew where we were headed.

178
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,652
After we were underway
a few days,

179
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,405
the captain called a briefing.

180
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:41,742
Stross:
ls that your daughter, Mr. Kuttner?

181
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,079
She's beautiful. My son has
the exact same color eyes.

182
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,580
Mind your business, Stross.

183
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:48,082
He doesn't wanna talk
about it, Nolan.

184
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:51,126
His little girl died in an accident
back home a few weeks ago.

185
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,212
Oh God, that's terrible.

186
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,964
l don't know what l'd do
if anything happened to my little boy.

187
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,675
Dr. cho, how's it going, girl?

188
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,095
Hey, Stross, l saw your wife earlier.

189
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,846
She seemed a little stressed.

190
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,681
Alexis is always stressed.

191
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:08,060
So, lsabel, wanna go grab a drink
at the Hole after this?

192
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,437
They got 12-credit specials
after 0500.

193
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:13,482
l'm sorry. l can't.
l've got two rookies

194
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,401
with artificial gravity sickness
to deal with.

195
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,694
Ugh! Boring, Doc.

196
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,197
You stay locked in med bay
all the time,

197
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,116
you'll never get a man
interested in you.

198
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,369
Have some fun.
Personally, l think starting any mission

199
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:28,288
without a drink or six is a bad idea.

200
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,958
l'll grab a beer with you
if the offer's open.

201
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:33,585
Oh, l don't usually drink
with tech heads,

202
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,212
but sure, why not?

203
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,131
l'm no lowly tech head,
thank you very much.

204
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:40,509
l'm gravimetric
control engineer, first class.

205
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,761
So what do you guys know
about this mission l don't?

206
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,639
That is what we called you
here to tell you, Mr. Nayim.

207
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:49,059
commander Sergenko,
l didn't realize you were on this ship.

208
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:50,644
Excuse me, sir.

209
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:53,689
l'm Alejandro Borges with
the engineering team from Titan Station.

210
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:56,400
l understood this was just
a routine gravimetric stabilization gig.

211
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:57,985
What's with all the secrecy?

212
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:00,779
This isn't your standard
asteroid patch-up job, son.

213
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,489
This is big time.

214
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:06,243
lt must be. Dragging our sorry asses
all the way to the edge of the galaxy--

215
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,871
Sergenko:
Eyes up and mouth shut, people.

216
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,372
Good morning, captain.

217
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,584
Good morning.
This is why we're here.

218
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,128
- l'm here 'cause it's double wages.
- ( chuckles )

219
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,714
The planet is Aegis 7.

220
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:22,134
lt was virtually destroyed
in a mining accident three weeks ago.

221
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,719
As you can see,

222
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,013
the impact has made
the planet unstable.

223
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:27,514
- Unstable?
- Damn!

224
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,224
That's where we come in.

225
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:32,895
Ourjob is to hold Aegis 7 together.

226
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,522
Borges: You've got to be kidding!
There is no way--

227
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,192
The captain is not
yet finished speaking.

228
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,527
After we achieve orbit,

229
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:43,739
eight drop ships will deliver
gravity stabilizers

230
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:46,033
to these key points.

231
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:48,785
The artificial gravity web
generated should be enough

232
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,537
to stabilize the planet.

233
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:53,749
Are you serious?
With only eight units?

234
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:57,002
That planet is practically
one huge bomb ready to explode.

235
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,879
How long do you think
a few gravity stabilizers

236
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:00,380
will hold something
like that together?

237
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,050
This is what you
signed on for, Mr. Borges.

238
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:05,969
lt's too late for you
to back out now.

239
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,889
Any other questions?

240
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,474
When do we drop, captain?

241
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:13,310
0500. Dismissed.

242
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,771
Stross, cho, Kuttner, Rin,

243
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:19,316
we would like to speak with you.

244
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:22,611
l understand some of you
have heard rumors

245
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,322
about what happened
on Aegis 7.

246
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,282
You can speak freely.

247
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,576
Rin: l've heard

248
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:33,580
they found something on
the planet surface so terrible

249
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:35,582
a guy called clarke

250
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,626
dropped a whole continent on it.

251
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:40,337
Something-- something alien.

252
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:43,257
- Bullshit.
- captain: The rumors are true.

253
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,134
They discovered an alien artifact

254
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,596
65 million years old.

255
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,598
cho:
My God! lt's actually real?

256
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,559
Kuttner:
What the hell is it?

257
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,310
Sergenko:
No one knows for sure.

258
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:58,438
lt's supposed
to contain certain properties.

259
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,065
What kind of properties?

260
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,609
That's classified, Dr. cho,

261
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,319
even to me.

262
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,613
And l assume the artifact
was destroyed upon impact.

263
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,365
correct,

264
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:11,285
but satellite imaging
reveals fragments have survived.

265
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:14,496
Your team's mission is
to locate and secure

266
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:17,082
whatever can be salvaged
of the artifact.

267
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,084
On a planet that could
explode any minute?

268
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,962
lt will be well worth the risk,
Mr. Kuttner.

269
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,964
Let's cut to the chase, captain.

270
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,632
Just how much
are these fragments worth?

271
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,303
Two million credits a kilo.

272
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,388
You know,

273
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:34,808
l hear Aegis 7 is beautiful
this time of year.

274
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:42,691
Man:
Shuttle 1 , prepare for launch.

275
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,319
- Nayim: We're dropping in three.
- You're playing hologames

276
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:49,406
- three minutes before a drop, Pawling?
- Yeah, l can't pause it right now.

277
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:51,825
Aren't you a little young
to be on this operation anyway?

278
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,745
- ( laughs )
- My cousin's a genius at two things:

279
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:57,080
hologames and gravity stabilizers.

280
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,541
We'd be screwed without him.
The real question is,

281
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,419
what are you guys doing here?
You're not engineers.

282
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,963
We're surveying
for gravity fluctuations.

283
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,506
Fluctuations?

284
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,384
The whole planet's one big
goddamn fluctuation.

285
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:10,969
What the hell
are you surveying?

286
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:14,890
Locking onto gravity stabilizer.
Releasing docking clamps.

287
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:18,060
Ready to drop.
Hold onto your breakfast, kiddies.

288
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:21,355
Man:
Shuttle 1 , drop in five, four,

289
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:25,359
three, two, drop.

290
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,331
Nayim:
Entering lower atmosphere.

291
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,084
Here's where the ride
gets fun, folks.

292
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,127
Yee-haw!

293
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:48,256
- l always hate this part.
- crazy bastard, level us out!

294
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,642
( explosion )

295
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,908
Kuttner:
Will you look at that?

296
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,576
Borges: God damn!

297
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,328
cho:
Holy shit!

298
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:22,207
This isn't a planet.
lt's a freakin' disaster in process.

299
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,961
Borges: This is nearly total gravimetric
and geothermal disruption.

300
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:29,339
lt seems impossible
the planet's held together this long.

301
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:30,841
Almost as if--

302
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:34,428
- As if what?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.

303
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,096
l need more data.

304
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:37,848
Okay, Noah, Omar,

305
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,434
ourjob is to keep that stabilizer
from overloading.

306
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,728
Let these guys go do

307
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,648
whatever the fuck it is
they're really doing here.

308
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:50,318
The scanners are calibrated to
the frequency of the mortar fragments.

309
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,279
Sweep out in branching formation.

310
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:55,407
Maintain radio contact at all times.
Any questions?

311
00:17:57,452 --> 00:17:59,453
Back here at 0900.

312
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,385
- ( explosion )
- Ho!

313
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:18,430
This is bullshit.
Rin, come in.

314
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,599
This rock is getting
more unstable by the minute

315
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,142
and l haven't found a damn thing.

316
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,269
Kuttner, l've lost track
of your signal.

317
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:25,937
- Rin.
- come in, do you read me?

318
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,148
- come in.
- Rin, you copy?

319
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:30,358
- ( beeping )
- Holy shit. Rin, come in.

320
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,361
l've got something.
( panting )

321
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,573
This way, l think.

322
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:38,825
l gotta be right on top of it.

323
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:42,954
Will you look at this?

324
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:46,541
( whispering voices )

325
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,378
( screaming )

326
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:55,550
Oh God! This is--

327
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,969
( wailing )

328
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:03,266
What is it?
l don't--

329
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:05,268
l don't understand.

330
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:07,521
Ahhhh!

331
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,356
Vivian: ♪ Twinkle twinkle ♪

332
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:12,359
♪ Little star ♪

333
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:15,904
- ♪ How l wonder what you are. ♪
- lt can't be.

334
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:19,157
Papa, what are we, Papa?

335
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,034
What are human beings?

336
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:24,579
Vivian, no, wait!

337
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,456
Where did you go?

338
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,750
"Daddy will always keep you safe."

339
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:31,503
- That's what you said to me.
- ( whooshes )

340
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,381
( woman screams )

341
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,970
( screams )

342
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:43,932
No, not again!

343
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,060
This isn't possible.
This isn't possible.

344
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:50,063
come in, do you read me?
come in, Kuttner.

345
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:52,566
- Rin.
- Where the hell are you?

346
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,735
Sergenko wants us back at the ship.
This place is coming apart.

347
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,446
- Something just happened.
- Kutt, do you copy?

348
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,657
Yeah.

349
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:03,410
- Yeah, l copy.
- Rin out.

350
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:06,621
- Papa?
- Vivian.

351
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,874
l miss you so much, Papa.

352
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,168
Oh, baby, l miss you too.

353
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,921
- Why didn't you take care of me?
- ( growling )

354
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:18,174
l tried to take-- no!
Get away from her.

355
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,427
- ( roars )
- Get away from her, no!

356
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:23,430
No! Vivian.

357
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:25,765
What's happening?

358
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,977
( screams )
Get away from me.

359
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,562
Get away from me!

360
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,523
Kutt, what's with you?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

361
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:44,117
Kuttner, all l got from you was static.
What happened?

362
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:46,119
l'm not sure.

363
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:48,580
l saw--

364
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,832
- l saw--
- Nickolas, what's wrong?

365
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,334
Are you in pain?

366
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,169
He's been acting weird
since l found him.

367
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:56,338
- ( screeching )
- lt could be his suit pressure.

368
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,632
What do you want?
Keep away from me.

369
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,176
Take it easy, Kutt.
Everything's cool.

370
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:03,845
Kuttner, what is that
in your hand?

371
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,972
- Borges: lt looks like a fragment.
- Vivian: Papa!

372
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,724
Vivian!

373
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:10,644
- They've got me, Papa.
- No! Vivian!

374
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,646
- Kuttner, stand down.
- Leave me alone.

375
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,398
They've got my daughter
and l'm gonna save her.

376
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:17,150
- Vivian!
- cho: Someone stop him.

377
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:18,777
- Kutt, where are you going?
- Vivian!

378
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:21,154
Stross: He's got a piece of
the artifact. lt's affecting his mind.

379
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,114
Sergenko:
Get after him.

380
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,826
Kuttner, what are
you doing here?

381
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:30,330
You're gonna have to wait, man.
We got a problem with the power flow.

382
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,375
- Papa!
- Vivian?

383
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,377
Papa, help me.

384
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,379
Keep away from my daughter.

385
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:40,674
- ( grunting )
- What's he doing? He's gone nuts!

386
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,054
- What the hell is your problem, man?
- l won't let them hurt you, Vivian.

387
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:48,723
l won't let you have her.
Leave her alone!

388
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:51,726
- ( growling )
- Get away

389
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:54,229
from my--

390
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:56,022
Papa! Papa!
Help me, Papa!

391
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,985
Leave her alone!

392
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:09,285
( groaning )
My head.

393
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,996
What happened?

394
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,539
Viv, where are you, honey?

395
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:15,959
Noah, no! Shh!

396
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:18,378
Don't speak.
You'll be okay.

397
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:19,921
l need help here!

398
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:23,717
Borges, Pawling.

399
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,010
What happened?

400
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,220
- Did the monsters get him?
- You bastard!

401
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:29,681
( grunts )

402
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:37,480
Oh, Nick.
What have you done?

403
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:40,191
Rin, Stross,
lock Kuttner in the ship now.

404
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,068
The stabilizer's overloading.

405
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:44,070
Noah, can you hear me?
Noah!

406
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:45,405
- Let me see him.
- Noah!

407
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:47,198
Alejandro, you have
to let me see him.

408
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,743
( groaning )

409
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:55,623
Stross: Make sure
those bonds are secure.

410
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,959
The artifact's influence
can cause homicidal outbursts.

411
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:01,171
And how do you know that, huh?
What's really going on here?

412
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:04,924
Rin, Rin, where's Vivian?
We can't leave without my daughter.

413
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,010
What the hell happened
to him out there?

414
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:09,888
Papa.
Goodbye, Papa.

415
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:11,639
Vivian! Vivian!

416
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,933
No! No!

417
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:17,479
Let me go! Let me go. No!

418
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:20,482
No! Let me go!

419
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,943
- Let me go. She needs me. Let me go!
- ( beeps )

420
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,321
- ( electricity crackles )
- ( screams )

421
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:31,034
( Vivian laughing )

422
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:34,204
There you are.
There you are, baby girl.

423
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:37,290
- Prep the subject for cryosleep.
- Wait.

424
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,000
Woman:
Yes sir.

425
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:41,252
Mr. Kuttner will be
of great use to us.

426
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,632
Guards, restrain the subject.

427
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,301
Guard: Hold it right there!

428
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:51,304
What do you think
you're doing?

429
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:53,890
Don't hurt me, please.
l was ordered to do it.

430
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:55,850
You won't take me away from her.

431
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:58,478
She needs her father.
l have to find her.

432
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:00,355
l have to keep her safe.

433
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:02,398
Hurry, you fool.
Alert security.

434
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,317
Tell them he must not be harmed.

435
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:06,236
Vivian!

436
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,862
Where are you, Vivian?

437
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,698
lt's Daddy, baby.
Don't be afraid.

438
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:17,789
- ( groaning )
- ( Vivian humming )

439
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:20,500
Vivian.

440
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:23,336
Wait.

441
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:26,589
Don't go, Vivian.
come back.

442
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:28,883
Daddy's hurt, baby girl.

443
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:30,718
Just please.

444
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,056
Please wait for me.

445
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,350
Where did you go?

446
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:41,354
- Papa.
- Viv.

447
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:42,730
No!

448
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:46,067
Don't-- don't leave me.

449
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:49,404
Don't leave me again.

450
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,907
( beeps )

451
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:01,207
Papa, get up.

452
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,459
You have to get up, Papa.

453
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:07,213
- Vivian.
- l'm here, Daddy.

454
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:09,299
Pumpkin.

455
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,301
You have to hurry, Papa.
They're coming.

456
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,428
They wanna take you away
from me.

457
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:18,558
l'm here, Daddy.
come to me.

458
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:20,810
We can be together.

459
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:22,604
Together.

460
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,564
Always.

461
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:26,691
Always and forever, Papa.

462
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,735
Always and forever.

463
00:25:28,903 --> 00:25:30,236
- There he is.
- What's he doing?

464
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:32,071
- He's opening the airlock!
- He's gone crazy.

465
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,907
Stop him! No!

466
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,121
Vivian: ♪ Twinkle twinkle ♪

467
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:42,415
♪ Little star ♪

468
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:46,127

471
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:07,899
He came into direct contact
with a shard.

472
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,609
The Overseer will
not be pleased.

473
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:11,778
But we still have the others.

474
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:13,363
Bring in Alejandro Borges.

475
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,490
Stross:
Humanity is just the beginning,

476
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:17,075
the chrysalis
for something greater,

477
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:18,576
something older, wiser.

478
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:21,621
We will become.
We must become.

479
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:23,915
Stross, l'm serious, man.
l will pay you real money

480
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:26,084
to just shut the fuck up.

481
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:28,169
What do you think
those alarms were all about?

482
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:30,338
Oh, uh, Kuttner's dead.

483
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:33,132
Stop it.
You don't know that.

484
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,134
But l do.
l can sense it.

485
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,386
We are all one.

486
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:40,306
This separate limited existence
of living matter is just an illusion,

487
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:41,557
a passing dream.

488
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:44,811
Great. Thanks for creeping
me out yet again, Doc.

489
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,191
( panting )

490
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:54,112
( whimpering )

491
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,322
( screams )

492
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,166
Woman: Are you ready
to cooperate, Mr. Borges?

493
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,171
Okay, all right, anything.

494
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,340
Just no more spiders.

495
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:18,344
Man: Tell us about the disaster
on Aegis 7.

496
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:21,681
Tell us about the shard.

497
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:24,767
l... didn't even know

498
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:26,519
about the damn shard.

499
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:28,688
l was just there to do a job.

500
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:30,857
Okay, Noah, Omar,

501
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:33,735
ourjob is to keep that stabilizer
from overloading.

502
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,987
Let these guys go do

503
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:38,823
whatever the fuck it is
they're really doing here.

504
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,284
Something's up
with their little expedition.

505
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:43,870
Suspicious as hell.

506
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:45,371
Nayim:
What do you mean?

507
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,415
They're here to measure
gravity fluctuations?

508
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:50,543
- l don't buy it for a second.
- ( loud rumbling )

509
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:54,130
The planet's breaking up.

510
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:55,757
Move your asses.
We got work to do.

511
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:59,135
Pawling: Looks like l'm gonna have
an interesting first day on the job.

512
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:02,180
Nayim: l knew six stabilizers
couldn't hold it.

513
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:04,766
Borges: We've got to hold her.
There are still teams on the ground.

514
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,434
Pawling:
The power flow's out of balance.

515
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:09,771
Gravity fluctuating. Go to manual.
Noah, do you have it?

516
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,940
- Just a second. Almost there.
- Noah!

517
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,568
- Got it! Yes!
- Nayim: Good work, kid. l'm impressed.

518
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:18,321
- That's my coz.
- Whoa! Whoa there!

519
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:21,866
Shh. Settle down, big boy.
That's it.

520
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:27,830
Pawling:
Sliced, diced, dead.

521
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:31,417
God, come on, there's gotta be
a harder setting than impossible.

522
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:33,002
Eh, the movie was better.

523
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:36,422
Hey, l never asked you, Borges,
how did you end up with that arm?

524
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,508
Not much to tell, really.

525
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:42,095
Mining accident. l lost it when
a grav stabilizer l was working blew.

526
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,430
My coz is being
humble again, Nayim.

527
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:48,059
Alejandro there saved
five guys off that rig. He's a hero.

528
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:51,437
We lost 15 men that day.
l'm no hero.

529
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:54,982
l'm sorry.
Life takes us strange places.

530
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,068
l was going to be a priest
when l was young.

531
00:28:57,236 --> 00:29:00,321
You're a Unitologist, Omar?
You really believe aliens

532
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,907
- created the human race?
- Look at us.

533
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,451
We have perfect symmetry
and a brain as powerful

534
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:09,038
as the most advanced computer.
And this came out of nothing?

535
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:10,790
( coughs ) Bullshit.

536
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:14,752
Laugh if you wish, my friend,
but human life was created

537
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,339
by alien beings.
And when we die, we return to them.

538
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:24,929
- Grav flux is starting up again.
- We've got an overload.

539
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,514
Nayim:
Gravity web is destabilizing.

540
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:28,808
She won't hold.
We could drop a dozen stabilizers

541
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:31,936
on this planet and it still wouldn't keep what's left
from blowing.

542
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,021
Borges: We need to hold it
until the teams get back.

543
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,648
Noah, can you balance the flow?

544
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:38,317
- Kuttner, what are you doing here?
- ( Kuttner muttering )

545
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,069
- What's he doing?
- l won't let you!

546
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:42,488
- ( grunting )
- Omar.

547
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:45,825
- Wait wait.
- What the hell is your problem, man?

548
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:49,454
- We don't have time for this shit.
- l won't let them hurt you, Vivian.

549
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,664
- Run, baby, run!
- Who's Vivian?

550
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:53,666
What the hell
are you talking about?

551
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:56,169
Monster!
Get away from her!

552
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:59,672
- Almost got it. There!
- Noah.

553
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,466
Yes, we're stable.

554
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,427
l'll kill you. l'll kill you all.

555
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:06,971
No!

556
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:08,848
Noah!

557
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:11,267
Oh my God.
Oh my God. Noah.

558
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:13,603
- Stabilize.
- Don't speak.

559
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,605
You'll be okay.
l need help here!

560
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,106
What happened?
Did the monsters get him?

561
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:19,942
You bastard!

562
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,197
- cho: Let me see him.
- Noah, can you hear me? Noah!

563
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,032
Alejandro,
you have to let me see him.

564
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,701
He's bleeding out.
We have to get him back to the ship.

565
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:31,537
Doc, is he gonna be okay?

566
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:36,125
- l'm so sorry.
- ( explosion )

567
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:39,212
Nayim: The stabilizer
is overloading. l can't hold it.

568
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:42,298
Alejandro, Alejandro,
they need you.

569
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:44,217
Nayim:
The whole power grid is failing.

570
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:47,345
Alejandro, l'm sorry, my friend.

571
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:50,765
Automatic systems are a total loss.

572
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:58,231
lt's a cascade failure.
There's nothing we can do.

573
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:01,484
- We have to get out of here.
- This is Sergenko. All units evacuate.

574
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:03,361
Get back
to the shuttles, everyone.

575
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:06,822
Move! Go go, move it!

576
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:11,744
Run, get to the ship now!

577
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:14,413
The lava is flowing this way.

578
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:17,250
That's Nolan and Rin up ahead.

579
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,876
There's a chasm ahead.

580
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:21,462
Don't stop.
Jump it, come on! Jump!

581
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,047
( screaming )

582
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:25,258
- This way.
- l can't run anymore.

583
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,926
- ( screams )
- Gotcha!

584
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:29,262
Thank you. Rin.

585
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:32,932
- Rin! Rin!
- ( screams )

586
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,600
Nolan.

587
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:37,603
- l'm okay.
- Don't stop. Get to the ship.

588
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:40,106
Sergenko:
Rin, l'm sorry.

589
00:31:40,274 --> 00:31:43,109
You were a good soldier.

590
00:31:43,277 --> 00:31:46,362
- Oh my God.
- Go around, hurry!

591
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,489
- commander Sergenko.
- Too late.

592
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:51,617
Borges, take this.

593
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:54,287
lt's more important
than you know. Protect it.

594
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,289
Get out of here,
all of you.

595
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:59,500
That's an order.
Get on the ship.

596
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,460
( screams )

597
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:04,297
Sergenko!

598
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,968
- What is happening?
- Gravity increasing.

599
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:11,220
( screaming )

600
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:20,354
- Nayim: ls everyone all right?
- Omar! Omar, above you. Look out!

601
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:22,773
- Omar! Omar!
- Borges, we can't help him.

602
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,818
- We have to go.
- We must get to the ship.

603
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:28,904
( grunts )
What the fuck is happening?

604
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,198
- Get me out of this.
- Shut the fuck up,

605
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,783
you crazy motherfucker!

606
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:36,829
Buckle up, guys.
We have to get off the planet.

607
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,834
Someone cut me loose,
God damn it.

608
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:43,836
Hold on.

609
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:45,963
Stross:
The planet's going.

610
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,643
Why is the engineer
flying the goddamn ship?

611
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,646
- Borges!
- l'm barely a pilot, okay?

612
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,690
- l think l'm gonna throw up.
- Aim for Kuttner.

613
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,280
Shit!
We've lost Shuttle 4.

614
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:14,075
We must get the shard back
to the O'Bannon.

615
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:18,621
What are they doing?

616
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:20,289
The ship is too close to the planet.

617
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:22,625
They need to clear the gravity well
before they shock point out.

618
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:26,504
That bastard's not
leaving us behind. Hold on!

619
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,518
Borges, we have to go faster.

620
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:42,687
lt's tearing apart now.

621
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,231
The engines--
look out for the engines.

622
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:47,942
Hold on!

623
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,494
- cho: Borges!
- This is bullshit.

624
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:01,831
We're coming in too fast.

625
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,833
l told you we shouldn't
have let him drive.

626
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,168
Shit shit shit!

627
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:15,302
Get those fires out now,
move it! come on! come on!

628
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,888
Are you all right?
Someone call medical.

629
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:21,517
That son of a bitch!

630
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:26,313
Man:
Full power to the engines.

631
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,191
- Woman: No contact with survey teams.
- ( crew chattering )

632
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,068
Are we far enough
to shock point?

633
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:33,696
- You! You knew!
- Hold on, son.

634
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:37,074
- We've got a situation here.
- She's going.

635
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:45,541
Emergency power
to shock point drive.

636
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:47,835
- Shocking out, in eight...
- collision alert.

637
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:50,463
seven, six, five...

638
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,465
four, three...

639
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:55,217
- We're not gonna make it.
- two...

640
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:58,095
( screaming )

641
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,812
- Look out!
- ( explosions )

642
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:11,817
Emergency thrusters.

643
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:15,154
Fly with the blast.
Ride it, ride it, God damn it!

644
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:17,573
Firing thrusters.

645
00:35:20,494 --> 00:35:23,662
Damage report.
Damage report!

646
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,040
Hull breach
in section B.

647
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:29,376
Shock point drive is down. We have
heavy casualties in engineering, sir.

648
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,087
Weapons control,
vaporize any planetary debris

649
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,340
that gets too close.
Lieutenant Marcus,

650
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:36,175
send out a distress signal.

651
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:37,718
Sir, those rocks
will tear us to pieces.

652
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:40,721
We won't survive very long
without the shock point drive.

653
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:42,973
l understand
the situation, Ensign Voigt.

654
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,518
Borges, get your team down
to the engine room

655
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:48,395
and repair that drive.

656
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:51,524
Mr. Borges,
l gave you an order.

657
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,526
l'm not fixing shit
until you explain

658
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:57,154
why this fucking rock
was worth my cousin's life, sir.

659
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:58,906
What are you talking about?

660
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:01,784
captain, Kuttner had some
sort of psychotic breakdown.

661
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:04,036
Engineer Pawling
was killed, as were most

662
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:06,038
of the engineering teams.

663
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:07,832
Follow me, all of you.

664
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,668
First Officer, l want a full
damage report in five minutes.

665
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:14,672
Yes sir.
Okay, ladies, man your stations.

666
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,633
The bodies have been
taken to cold storage.

667
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:20,469
Kuttner is under observation
in sick bay.

668
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:23,305
captain, perhaps it would be
best to keep the shard

669
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:26,517
under quarantine until we know
more about its properties.

670
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:30,062
Mmm, of course.
l was hoping for more, but--

671
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,523
You were hoping for more?

672
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,733
You sent us
on a suicide mission

673
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,318
for a lump of rock?

674
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:38,904
This is much more
than just a lump of rock, son.

675
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:41,282
The high l.Q. boys back home

676
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,742
say this will change
the face of science itself--

677
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,328
And that's worth all the people
who died back there?

678
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:49,373
Easy, Alejandro. l'm sure
the captain couldn't predict

679
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,375
the shard's influence on Kuttner.

680
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,252
Look, son, the shard--

681
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:56,714
it's worth a lot of money.

682
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:59,925
Enough for you to take care
of Engineer Pawling's family

683
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:01,969
for the rest of their lives.

684
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:03,846
You son of a bitch!

685
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:06,599
- Borges!
- Take it easy, Alejandro.

686
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:08,559
- ( loud bang )
- What the fuck was that?

687
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:11,353
Pieces of the planet
are still impacting the ship.

688
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:13,939
We need to get clear
of the debris field.

689
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:15,816
Mr. Borges, if l didn't need you

690
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:17,234
to save the ship,

691
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:19,278
you would be
in the brig for that.

692
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:22,531
Now get your ass down
to the engine room

693
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,408
and repair
the shock point drive,

694
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,994
or we're all dead!

695
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,748
Alejandro?

696
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,210
How old was Pawling?

697
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,379
cho: About 19.

698
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:41,508
l'm sorry, Noah,

699
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,470
l got you this job.

700
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:46,639
lt's all my fault.

701
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:52,144
And you never came into direct
contact with the fragment?

702
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:55,314
No, l swear. l never
touched the damn thing.

703
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:59,234
Lie detection states
99.9% truth.

704
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,945
He never touched it.

705
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:04,490
Thank you, Mr. Borges.
You've been most cooperative.

706
00:38:04,658 --> 00:38:05,741
What's happening?

707
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,493
We'll have you escorted
to guest quarters

708
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:09,536
for the remainder
of your trip to the Sprawl.

709
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:13,248
You mean l can go?
Seriously?

710
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,501
You'll have to go through
med scans of course,

711
00:38:15,669 --> 00:38:19,338
but you'll be back home
to your family as soon as we dock.

712
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,842
Oh, thank God.
Thank you. Thank you.

713
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,220
- Right this way, Mr. Borges.
- l can't believe it.

714
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:29,056
l'm actually going home.
l gotta tell you guys,

715
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:32,101
a couple times back on
the O'Bannon, l honestly thought

716
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,477
l was a dead man.

717
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,407
Have them remains taken
to cold storage

718
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:50,577
- and bring in Nolan Stross.
- Yes sir.

719
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:56,709
( panting )

720
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:01,213
No no,
what are you doing?

721
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:03,966
Please don't.
Don't do this!

722
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:07,052
No! Stop! Let me out! No!

723
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,722
l'll be good. Let me out.
Oh God, please let me out!

724
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,557
claustrophobia.

725
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:13,726
Most horrible.

726
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,145
Now l take it
you're ready to talk sense.

727
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:18,731
We're on a bit of a deadline.
l'm sure you understand.

728
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,442
Yes yes, l understand--

729
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,737
better than you
could possibly comprehend.

730
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,780
Dr. Stross, you have been
chief research scientist

731
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:29,742
on the O'Bannon
for a little over a year now.

732
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,827
One year, two months
and nine days.

733
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:34,079
And all that while
you've also been clandestinely

734
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:36,749
a part of our government's
secret investigation

735
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:39,168
into the alien marker.

736
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:40,627
ls that correct?

737
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,129
That's correct.

738
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:44,757
Since l was already a part
of the O'Bannon's crew,

739
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:48,260
they decided to send us in
after the lshimura incident.

740
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:50,596
l was to examine
any fragments in the marker

741
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:52,139
and make a thorough report.

742
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:54,058
l see.

743
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:57,478
Now why don't you share with me
the results of your investigation?

744
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:00,064
After we returned
to the O'Bannon,

745
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,816
l went to check on my family.

746
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:06,070
My family means
a great deal to me.

747
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:11,784
The shock point drive
is down?

748
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:14,286
But how are we gonna get
home without it?

749
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:17,164
An engineering team is working
around the clock to fix it, Alexis.

750
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:20,292
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be fine.

751
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,253
- Won't it, little fella?
- Nolan, level with me.

752
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:26,799
Does all this have anything to do
with that other research you're doing?

753
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,801
- The government stuff?
- Alexis,

754
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,636
can you please not grill me

755
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:32,971
during the few moments a day
l get with my son?

756
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:37,142
l need to go. The captain wants me
to examine the artifact

757
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,978
- we found on the planet.
- What kind of artifact?

758
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,106
- The classified kind.
- What about that doctor

759
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,566
you're always with?
ls she classified too?

760
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:45,734
Alexis.

761
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:47,986
You spend more time
with her than with us.

762
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:50,906
She's a colleague. Why would
l have brought you on this trip

763
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:52,491
if there was anything going on?

764
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:56,078
Because you're the senior science
officer and l pestered to come along.

765
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:58,789
- l've gotta get to the lab.
- You can't keep running there

766
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:00,666
every time l wanna
have a discussion

767
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:03,001
about our relationship.

768
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,087
Don't wait up.

769
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:07,506
- ( baby crying )
- Oh, sweetie.

770
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:09,591
( shushing )

771
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:13,137
l'm here.
Mommy's here.

772
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:22,312
- ( knock on door )
- come in.

773
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,984
caleb, l really should be
starting the analysis of the shard.

774
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:28,485
captain?

775
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:31,196
l want some answers,
Mr. Stross.

776
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:34,116
l nearly lost my ship
recovering that damn thing.

777
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:36,410
l know l'm just supposed
to turn it over to you.

778
00:41:36,578 --> 00:41:38,370
You'll have to take that up
with home base.

779
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:39,621
l have.

780
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:42,374
They tell me all matters
connected with the shard

781
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:45,878
are need-to-know only.
My goddamn ship's scientist

782
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:49,339
needs to know more about this
mission than l do apparently.

783
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:52,009
Excuse me for saying so, sir,
but you don't look well.

784
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:54,761
lt's the shard.

785
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,681
l can hear it talking to me.

786
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:00,809
caleb, have you discussed this
with Dr. cho?

787
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:03,187
( loud rumbling )

788
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,898
Just get the damn thing
out of my sight,

789
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,858
but l'm warning you, Stross,

790
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:11,028
whatever the hell is going on,
you keep it in your lab.

791
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:13,989
We're in deep enough
shit here as it is.

792
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:31,882
lt's even more astonishing than
l could have possibly imagined.

793
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,467
What is, Doctor?

794
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:35,177
The structure is similar
to a hologram.

795
00:42:35,345 --> 00:42:38,305
Every particle contains all
the information of the whole.

796
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:41,099
What made this
cuneiform-like symbol?

797
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,352
There's no scratching
or sign of cutting--

798
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,980
as if the crystal itself
gave birth to it.

799
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:49,066
What?

800
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:52,110
- What's happening?
- ( voices whispering )

801
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:55,614
The shard, it's--

802
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:58,325
Oh, my head.

803
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:01,286
Some form
of telepathic encoding?

804
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:03,163
Dr. Stross,
are you feeling well?

805
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:04,623
l'm fine.
l'm fine.

806
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:10,212
My God, it's a form of DNA,
a blueprint.

807
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,381
Nolan, what are you doing?

808
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:15,300
lsabel, you won't believe it.
Sandra, that will be all.

809
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:16,969
- Thank you.
- But, Doctor, we need to run

810
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:20,138
- a spectral analysis--
- That will be all, Miss Burns.

811
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:23,016
lsabel, it's amazing.
The shard, it's the key

812
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:24,977
to an alien language,

813
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,437
a guide to DNA chains
l've never seen before.

814
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,482
This may contain the secret
to the future of human evolution.

815
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,735
Nolan, are you okay?
You seem a little hyperactive.

816
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:35,445
Try and understand,

817
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,240
this is the finding of a lifetime.

818
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:42,119
( kissing )

819
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:48,500
Well, don't let it
go to your head, hmm?

820
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:51,420
But this could alter
the very destiny of humanity,

821
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,922
- change everything.
- Shh! We'll talk about that later.

822
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,675
But right now...
( laughs )

823
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:01,888
The shard seems to generate
some sort of carrier wave

824
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:04,433
so advanced my instruments
can barely detect it.

825
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,436
Though l have a theory
that when it comes into contact

826
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:10,814
with dead human tissue,
it reanimates the cells,

827
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:13,358
possibly into a new
and more evolved form.

828
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:16,820
can you explain what happened
to Kuttner on the planet?

829
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:18,947
Well, it seems most humans
when influenced

830
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:20,949
by the marker
become hyperpsychotic.

831
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:23,994
Only a very small percent
are resilient to its effects.

832
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:26,872
Kuttner was already on the edge--
his grief over his daughter.

833
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,458
The shard pushed him over
into a delusional state.

834
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:32,794
And you believe the shard was
originally created by aliens?

835
00:44:32,962 --> 00:44:34,921
A higher intelligence
most definitely,

836
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:38,216
what a primitive mind
would call God. ( gasps )

837
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:39,843
God, he says.

838
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:45,140
Stross, maybe you
should get some sleep.

839
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:49,186
Stross, Stross?
can you hear me?

840
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:51,521
( voices whispering )

841
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:56,401
( screams )

842
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:02,240
The shard somehow
transmits nightmares,

843
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:05,702
dreams and visions,
but the knowledge, it emanates.

844
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,873
l need a test subject.

845
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:15,629
( distant explosion )

846
00:45:22,178 --> 00:45:24,679
Already the signal from the shard

847
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,932
permeates the dead flesh
of the subject.

848
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,017
l've never seen
anything transform

849
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:30,727
an entire host cell so quickly.

850
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:33,855
lt's-- it's beautiful.

851
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:36,274
Damn it!
How can l be expected

852
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:39,986
to complete my experiments
under these conditions?

853
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,324
What?
That's not possible.

854
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,328
( whispering voices )

855
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:50,330
- ( growls )
- ( screams ) Oh no!

856
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:52,666
lt's all your fault, Doctor.

857
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:56,628
They will all suffer
because of you.

858
00:45:56,796 --> 00:45:58,797
( panting )

859
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:00,465
H-hallucination.

860
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:02,676
lt was just a hallucination.

861
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:04,803
The door-- l broke the seal.

862
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:06,972
l wasn't thinking. ( gasps )

863
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,099
Good Lord,
what have l done?

864
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:11,810
- Dr. Stross, l've got the analysis--
- Sandra, get out!

865
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:14,062
( Sandra screams )

866
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:18,483
Oh no.
No, get away.

867
00:46:18,651 --> 00:46:20,986
lt's not my fault.
The shard-- it tricked me.

868
00:46:21,154 --> 00:46:22,779
Leave me alone!

869
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:40,672
Hold the light steady, will ya?

870
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,425
- ( growling )
- lt's still after me.

871
00:46:43,593 --> 00:46:46,803
Here, it won't find me in here.

872
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,599
No!

873
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:53,185
- Oh my God, no! Oh God.
- ( men screaming )

874
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:56,313
( panting )

875
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:59,441
Oh God. Oh God,
l need help.

876
00:46:59,609 --> 00:47:02,319
The captain.
The captain.

877
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,115
captain, l have to tell you.
lt's about the shard.

878
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:10,368
Not right now, Stross.
l've got the engine room on the horn.

879
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:13,163
l need that shock point
back online now, Borges.

880
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:16,541
Thanks to that class-A
clusterfuck down on the planet,

881
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:18,710
captain, l barely
have any engineers left.

882
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:20,879
lt'll be a miracle
if we can pull this thing off.

883
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:23,298
- Mister, l have taken all the shit--
- ( screaming )

884
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:26,968
- What the hell is going on?
- We're under attack.

885
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:30,388
Borges. Borges!
God damn it.

886
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:32,432
Lieutenant Marcus,
take a security team down there.

887
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,060
- captain, please, listen to me.
- Not now, Stross!

888
00:47:35,228 --> 00:47:37,896
Woman: We have a code 3
emergency in the engine room.

889
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:41,066
All personnel report
to their stations.

890
00:47:41,234 --> 00:47:43,527
This is not a drill.
Repeat, this is not a drill.

891
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,320
- ( alarm blaring )
- Alexis, the baby.

892
00:47:45,488 --> 00:47:47,739
Emergency stations, move it.
Move it!

893
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:50,659
Oh oh God.

894
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:53,286
( screaming )

895
00:48:04,966 --> 00:48:07,217
Alexis.

896
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:08,677
Lex, are you here?

897
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:12,013
Alexis, l made
a horrible mistake.

898
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:14,975
The shard.
l'm not thinking clearly.

899
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:17,185
- ( baby cooing )
- Alexis?

900
00:48:17,353 --> 00:48:20,855
Son, son, is that you?

901
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:22,857
- ( screeching )
- Get off of me!

902
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:24,943
( grunting )

903
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:27,112
- Where's my son?
- Alexis: Nolan!

904
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,906
That's my baby! No!

905
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:32,450
You monster!

906
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:35,704
Get away from my family.

907
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,539
( screams )

908
00:48:37,707 --> 00:48:40,667
( panting ) Nolan.

909
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:45,797
( shouts )

910
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:49,217
( panting )

911
00:48:49,385 --> 00:48:52,387
Nolan? Nolan, something's happening.
The bodies--

912
00:48:52,555 --> 00:48:55,640
they're turning into creatures.
lt has to be the shard.

913
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:58,184
Oh God.

914
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,606
Oh my God.

915
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,446
Seeing those dead creatures
must have truly affected her.

916
00:49:09,614 --> 00:49:12,699
lsabel changed after that,
but l had to do it.

917
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:15,285
Those things were
threatening my family.

918
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:18,788
Dr. Stross,
where is your family now?

919
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:22,375
l-- l locked them
in their quarters.

920
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:25,587
Did your men find them?
Are they safe? What about the baby?

921
00:49:25,755 --> 00:49:28,506
- His heart rate is 160.
- l need to see them.

922
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:30,175
convergence is coming.
We have to be together

923
00:49:30,343 --> 00:49:33,970
- when the change arrives.
- Dr. Stross, where is your family?

924
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:35,388
ln my quarters, l told you.

925
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:37,932
- Yes, you did.
- ( beeps )

926
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,894
- ( electricity crackles )
- Where is your family?

927
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:44,147
Safe in quarters.
Saved them-- l saved them.

928
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:46,024
lnteresting.

929
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:48,693
l've never seen
such a complete block before.

930
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:51,655
- lncrease the voltage.
- ( screaming )

931
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:54,115
l won't!
l won't remember.

932
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:58,161
- You can't make me remember.
- Really quite extraordinary.

933
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:01,748
( beeps )

934
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:05,210
You're just doing what it
wants you to do, all of you.

935
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:09,673
You're gonna kill me now,
aren't you?

936
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,800
Like you did Kuttner
and Borges.

937
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,968
We don't want
to kill you, Dr. Stross.

938
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:17,263
- You don't?
- Of course not.

939
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:20,433
You came into direct contact
with the marker.

940
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:23,144
lt actually communicated
with you.

941
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:26,398
Your mind holds the key
to its language.

942
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:30,068
You're exactly
what we've been looking for.

943
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:32,445
What is that?

944
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:33,947
What are you doing?

945
00:50:34,115 --> 00:50:37,117
Please stop.
l did everything l was asked to do.

946
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:39,703
Why are you doing this
to me? Stop.

947
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,621
Stop it.
Please stop.

948
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:44,541
Not this, please.
Please please!

949
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:47,627
lnterrogator: Unfortunate...
about the claustrophobia.

950
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:49,629
Woman: They will be pleased,
won't they, sir?

951
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:51,464
Stross is everything
they wanted.

952
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:54,801
Not quite everything.
Bring in lsabel cho.

953
00:50:57,972 --> 00:50:59,472
Woman:
Sprawl, this is Abraxis.

954
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,892
- Requesting permission to dock.
- Man: Permission granted, Abraxis.

955
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,478
- Welcome home.
- ( lsabel screaming, crying )

956
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:16,489
You are making this
unnecessarily difficult, Doctor.

957
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:19,325
We merely wish to know
about the shard's full effects

958
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:21,369
upon the O'Bannon's crew.

959
00:51:21,537 --> 00:51:24,456
You're talking
to the wrong person.

960
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,833
Nolan studied the artifact.

961
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:29,669
And we want to know more
about Nolan Stross.

962
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:32,839
Did he reveal the details
of his investigation to you?

963
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:36,426
- You were having an affair.
- Why is that relevant?

964
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:39,179
Dr. cho, l have no wish
to cause you further discomfort,

965
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,723
but if you do not
answer my question,

966
00:51:41,891 --> 00:51:45,351
l shall be forced
to intensify my methods.

967
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,270
Do you understand me?

968
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:50,315
Yes.

969
00:51:50,483 --> 00:51:53,651
Tell me about your affair
with Dr. Stross.

970
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:57,655
l-- the affair lasted
several months.

971
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:00,158
We'd been working together
for a year.

972
00:52:00,326 --> 00:52:01,826
l didn't plan it.

973
00:52:01,994 --> 00:52:03,912
lt was just something
that happened.

974
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,289
He told me he was
going to leave his wife,

975
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:08,708
but l didn't want him to.

976
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:11,836
l tried to stay away,
but l couldn't.

977
00:52:12,004 --> 00:52:14,380
For the first time in my life

978
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:17,217
l was in love.

979
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:19,260
After we found
the shard on Aegis 7,

980
00:52:19,428 --> 00:52:23,264
Nolan started acting
strange, erratic.

981
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:25,642
Do you know what's
the most fascinating thing

982
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:28,394
- about the crystal structure, lsabel?
- Hmm?

983
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:30,814
The patterns there
are almost familiar,

984
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,774
like a dream
l've nearly forgotten.

985
00:52:32,942 --> 00:52:36,194
l think you've lost me.

986
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:38,571
l only speak English
and Korean.

987
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:41,741
This is going to shape
reality itself, lsabel.

988
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:45,495
Nolan, l want you
to come to sick bay.

989
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:47,747
Let me run some
psych scans.

990
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:50,917
Remember what that thing
did to Kuttner?

991
00:52:51,085 --> 00:52:52,752
l don't need psych scans.

992
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,463
You have no comprehension
of what l'm doing here.

993
00:52:55,631 --> 00:52:57,674
l've nearly grasped
its sacred language--

994
00:52:57,842 --> 00:52:59,968
the ultimate source
of human life itself.

995
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:02,387
Nolan, you're starting
to scare me.

996
00:53:02,555 --> 00:53:04,430
l think it's time
for you to leave.

997
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:06,182
l have work to do.

998
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:09,394
All right.

999
00:53:09,562 --> 00:53:11,813
l need to check
on Kuttner anyway.

1000
00:53:13,566 --> 00:53:15,942
So how's our patient today?

1001
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:18,111
Resting comfortably, Doctor.

1002
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:20,238
Are you feeling better,
Nickolas?

1003
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:22,615
Head hurts,
still can't remember much.

1004
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:25,326
Do you remember seeing
your daughter?

1005
00:53:25,494 --> 00:53:28,454
Of course.
She's out playing right now.

1006
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:31,457
- She'll be back soon.
- Of course she will.

1007
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:36,337
Those engineers better
get the drive working.

1008
00:53:36,505 --> 00:53:38,339
l need to get Vivian home
to her mother.

1009
00:53:38,507 --> 00:53:41,968
l'm sure they're doing
their best. l have to go.

1010
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:43,469
Try and get some rest, okay?

1011
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:46,848
Whenever l close my eyes,
all l see are monsters.

1012
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:52,103
All right, Doctors. We have
a dozen DOAs to process.

1013
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:54,898
Ripley and Wells should have
finished the prep by now.

1014
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,900
The captain
wants a full report by--

1015
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,902
( gasps )
oh my God.

1016
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:02,447
- Man: Good Lord.
- The bodies are gone.

1017
00:54:02,615 --> 00:54:04,699
What could have done this?

1018
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:07,452
By the Great Marker.

1019
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:09,454
ls that Dr. Ripley?

1020
00:54:09,622 --> 00:54:11,706
call the captain.

1021
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:13,875
- We've got to--
- ( growling )

1022
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:17,712
( snarling )

1023
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,714
Get out! Get out!

1024
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:21,507
Shut the door!

1025
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,718
Run! Get out of there!

1026
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:25,887
- Shut the door!
- ls that door gonna hold?

1027
00:54:26,055 --> 00:54:28,014
- Did everyone get out?
- What is it?

1028
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:30,516
- ( alarm blaring )
- Emergency stations.

1029
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:33,102
Everyone get
to your posts now!

1030
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,271
- Move it!
- ( screaming )

1031
00:54:36,315 --> 00:54:39,442
- Kuttner: Doc, what's going on?
- My God, this can't be happening.

1032
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,444
- Doc!
- lt can't be.

1033
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:44,948
- Am l going crazy?
- ( crashing )

1034
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,449
What the fuck is that?

1035
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:47,992
- Oh no.
- Get me out of here.

1036
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,953
Get me off off this table now.

1037
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,205
lt's the monsters, isn't it?

1038
00:54:52,373 --> 00:54:55,458
l knew they'd be back.

1039
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:58,586
- ( screaming )
- ( snarling )

1040
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:04,050
come on!
come on, you bastard.

1041
00:55:04,218 --> 00:55:06,219
Here l am,
right here.

1042
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:15,561
What the hell is it?

1043
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:17,355
The shard's behind this.

1044
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:20,108
l can feel it.

1045
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:22,360
( explosion )

1046
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:28,074
- Where's the rest of the crew?
- l don't know.

1047
00:55:28,242 --> 00:55:30,660
- We have to find Vivian.
- l'm sure she's safe.

1048
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:34,330
Look, if the shard's doing this,
then we need to find Nolan.

1049
00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:37,333
come on.

1050
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:39,335
All this blood--

1051
00:55:39,503 --> 00:55:41,421
what happened
to all the bodies?

1052
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:44,215
Man: They changed.
They became one.

1053
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:47,135
l saw it.
l saw it happen.

1054
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:48,970
Kuttner:
chief, is that you?

1055
00:55:49,138 --> 00:55:51,055
They want you too.

1056
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:53,182
They want you both dead!

1057
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,351
- Oh shit!
- chief, what are you doing?

1058
00:55:57,563 --> 00:55:59,647
- ( screaming )
- Let's go. This way.

1059
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:01,566
Right behind you.

1060
00:56:01,734 --> 00:56:03,609
- Where are we now?
- This is Nolan--

1061
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:06,195
l mean, Dr. Stross' quarters.
Wait here.

1062
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:09,782
- Keep your eyes open.
- No shit. You think?

1063
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:14,912
Nolan?
Nolan, something's happening.

1064
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,707
The bodies,
they're turning into creatures.

1065
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:20,960
Nolan, is that your wife?

1066
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:22,712
The baby.

1067
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:26,007
Nolan, what have you done?

1068
00:56:26,175 --> 00:56:29,761
lsabel, we have to
warn the others.

1069
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:32,138
- l accidentally released the infection.
- Keep away from me.

1070
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:34,640
Keep away from me!

1071
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,684
- You monster!
- Doc?

1072
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:38,102
- Stross: lsabel.
- You monster!

1073
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:39,645
What is it?
What's the matter with you?

1074
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:41,397
- ( gunfire )
- Look out. There's another one.

1075
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:43,775
- How many of these things are there?
- On your left.

1076
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,651
- Aim for its eyes.
- lt's still coming!

1077
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,695
- Get out of the halls.
- Get to safety.

1078
00:56:47,863 --> 00:56:50,698
- Look out!
- ( screaming )

1079
00:56:53,077 --> 00:56:56,370
- lt's still coming!
- Stross, what the hell is going on?

1080
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:59,457
- What are these things?
- They are the future, captain.

1081
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:01,375
They're what we were always
meant to become,

1082
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:04,670
- glorious and immortal.
- God damn it, Nolan. Get it together.

1083
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:06,339
What's wrong with you, man?

1084
00:57:06,507 --> 00:57:08,341
captain,
we've got more company.

1085
00:57:08,509 --> 00:57:11,636
Too many to fight.
We need a way out.

1086
00:57:11,804 --> 00:57:14,305
Vivian. Baby, is that you?
Vivian, wait.

1087
00:57:14,473 --> 00:57:17,308
- come back. lt's not safe down there.
- Kuttner.

1088
00:57:17,476 --> 00:57:19,435
- Where the hell's he going?
- No, he's right.

1089
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:22,230
- They can't follow us through there.
- Then hurry. Move your ass.

1090
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:24,357
- He went into the vent.
- Get moving!

1091
00:57:24,525 --> 00:57:26,442
- l'll cover you.
- Keep going all of you.

1092
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:29,362
- Hustle it up, Pallas.
- Right behind you, captain.

1093
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:32,156
No!
Let go, you son of a bitch.

1094
00:57:32,324 --> 00:57:34,158
- Ow!
- Officer Pallas.

1095
00:57:34,326 --> 00:57:35,701
caleb, get them out of here!

1096
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:38,955
- Officer Pallas. Leslie. Leslie!
- There's nothing you can do.

1097
00:57:39,123 --> 00:57:42,667
She's gone. She's gone!

1098
00:57:42,835 --> 00:57:44,377
She--

1099
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:47,088
she was a good officer,
a good shipmate.

1100
00:57:47,256 --> 00:57:48,714
We need to keep going, captain.

1101
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:50,967
Those things may find a way
into the vent.

1102
00:57:51,135 --> 00:57:53,553
come on, Vivian went this way.

1103
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,514
By all means, let's follow the ghost
of his dead daughter.

1104
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:58,224
l'm not entirely comfortable

1105
00:57:58,392 --> 00:58:00,726
depending on someone
who has obviously lost his mind.

1106
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:04,105
Yeah, l know exactly
what you mean.

1107
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:10,069
Vivian says we should
go down there.

1108
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:12,613
cho: l think we're over
the science section.

1109
00:58:12,781 --> 00:58:14,949
captain: This is your lab,
right, Stross?

1110
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:16,492
Sounds quiet enough.

1111
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,371
lt's all clear.

1112
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:23,749
- come on.
- Something's got him.

1113
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:26,169
No! Borges, it's us.

1114
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:29,213
- lt's Kuttner.
- l know who it is.

1115
00:58:29,381 --> 00:58:32,633
- ( gun cocks )
- Take you with me.

1116
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:35,636
Stop it. Stop it!
We don't have time for this shite!

1117
00:58:35,804 --> 00:58:38,347
calm down, Alejandro.

1118
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,474
l only want safety
for my daughter.

1119
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:42,476
Your daughter's dead, asshole.

1120
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:45,479
Just like my cousin you killed.

1121
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:49,317
No, Vivian, don't listen.
He's confused. He's just scared.

1122
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:51,777
Borges, what's the situation
with the shock point drive?

1123
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:53,529
Did you get it operational?

1124
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:56,240
Fuck no. The engine room
is totally fucked!

1125
00:58:56,408 --> 00:58:57,742
We barely got out.

1126
00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:01,287
- We?
- Sorry, captain. We were overrun.

1127
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:03,706
captain:
They got the bridge as well.

1128
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:05,791
Let me take a look at that arm.

1129
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,294
Pretty rough laceration,
but you'll be okay.

1130
00:59:08,462 --> 00:59:10,963
- l'll need some help here.
- l'll help, love.

1131
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:13,507
lsabel, what is wrong with you?

1132
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:15,801
Keep away from me,
you sick bastard,

1133
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:18,679
or l swear l'll throw you out there
with the rest of the monsters.

1134
00:59:18,847 --> 00:59:21,933
Stross, we could
use you over here.

1135
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:25,353
- Yes, captain.
- What the hell is going on?

1136
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,856
Why is my crew turning
into goddamn monsters?

1137
00:59:29,024 --> 00:59:30,775
Homo sapiens
are the true monster.

1138
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:33,194
These are higher forms of life.

1139
00:59:33,362 --> 00:59:36,864
We're becoming them,
and soon we will all become one.

1140
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:39,659
- What did you say?
- lgnore him. He's not well.

1141
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:42,787
No no, there's an old
Unitologist proverb:

1142
00:59:42,955 --> 00:59:45,665
all forms of life will unite
in convergence

1143
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:47,375
and we shall be one.

1144
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:50,211
My mom said that we were living
in the end of days.

1145
00:59:50,379 --> 00:59:52,797
- convergence is coming soon.
- ( loud bang )

1146
00:59:52,965 --> 00:59:55,174
By the look of things,
it seems like your mom was right.

1147
00:59:55,342 --> 00:59:56,968
So how the hell do we stop it?

1148
00:59:57,135 --> 01:00:00,513
Stross, you're the only one
who understands those things.

1149
01:00:00,681 --> 01:00:02,348
How can we stop them?

1150
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:05,476
Nolan, look, we need you, okay?

1151
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:09,105
The necromorphs are animated
by the signal from the shard.

1152
01:00:09,273 --> 01:00:11,399
We have to stop the carrier wave.

1153
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:14,610
Then give me that goddamn thing.
l'll stop it.

1154
01:00:16,238 --> 01:00:17,405
Didn't even scratch it.

1155
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:20,074
There's no way you can
destroy it, only shatter it.

1156
01:00:20,242 --> 01:00:23,035
And every piece will retain
the properties of the original,

1157
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:24,620
like a hologram.

1158
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:26,455
There's got to be a way.

1159
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,291
No no.

1160
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:31,127
lt was designed by an intelligence
we can't begin to comprehend.

1161
01:00:31,295 --> 01:00:33,212
You would have to cast it
into the heart of a star.

1162
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:35,256
Or a reactor core?

1163
01:00:35,424 --> 01:00:38,759
Yes.
Yes, that might do it.

1164
01:00:38,927 --> 01:00:41,512
Then we take this thing
to the engine room and we destroy it.

1165
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,432
Are you serious? The engine room
is fucking crawling

1166
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:48,602
- with those things.
- Then we fight our way through them.

1167
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:53,566
We don't have a lot of choice.

1168
01:00:53,734 --> 01:00:56,402
The ship can't take much more.
What do we have for weapons?

1169
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:59,447
Just your gun and these bone saws
we grabbed in medical.

1170
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:03,159
l was working on those things
until you guys showed up.

1171
01:01:03,327 --> 01:01:06,912
captain: Are you actually building
something out of all this junk?

1172
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,874
Flamethrower,
a few incendiary grenades.

1173
01:01:10,042 --> 01:01:12,877
Found some plasma cutters--
charges are pretty low.

1174
01:01:13,045 --> 01:01:15,755
Okay then.
can you travel, Lieutenant Marcus?

1175
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:18,090
- Yes sir.
- Then everybody arm yourselves.

1176
01:01:18,258 --> 01:01:20,176
Let's go.

1177
01:01:20,344 --> 01:01:22,303
Kuttner:
God damn, it's quiet.

1178
01:01:22,471 --> 01:01:24,722
cho: Those things couldn't have
gotten the whole crew, could they?

1179
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:27,933
- captain: Everybody stay together.
- Borges: Wait. What was that?

1180
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:30,936
l thought l heard something.

1181
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:34,065
- lt's clear. This way.
- ( metal rattles )

1182
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:35,816
l know l heard something.

1183
01:01:35,984 --> 01:01:38,235
- Look out!
- Marcus, get out of here!

1184
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:41,655
Aw shit!

1185
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:44,617
cho: Move it.
lt's right behind you.

1186
01:01:44,785 --> 01:01:48,371
- l think we're just pissing it off.
- Got any better ideas?

1187
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:51,499
- Yeah, run!
- cho: This way!

1188
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:53,667
Hurry! Down here.

1189
01:01:56,004 --> 01:01:58,214
- Jenny?
- Lana, don't get too close to it.

1190
01:01:58,382 --> 01:02:00,549
lt's all right.
lt's my roommate Jenny.

1191
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:03,969
Praise the Marker.
Jenny, are you okay?

1192
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:06,180
Lana, no. Get away from it.

1193
01:02:06,348 --> 01:02:08,307
- Lana!
- ( screaming )

1194
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:13,604
- captain: They're right behind us.
- Borges: come on, Doc, we gotta go.

1195
01:02:14,606 --> 01:02:16,524
Let's see if this
bad boy works.

1196
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:21,195
( explosion )

1197
01:02:22,656 --> 01:02:25,074
Finally. The engine room's
through that door.

1198
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:27,326
We're not too far
from the reactor core.

1199
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:29,036
We're not there yet. Look!

1200
01:02:29,204 --> 01:02:32,164
( snarling )

1201
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:37,169
Let's go! Move it!

1202
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:41,757
We've got a hull breach!

1203
01:02:41,925 --> 01:02:43,926
Hold on to something.

1204
01:02:48,974 --> 01:02:51,600
( alarm blaring )

1205
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,352
We're losing oxygen.

1206
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,020
Get to the engine room.

1207
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:57,690
We can seal the airlock there.

1208
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:01,986
- Help me! Oh God, help me!
- Hold on.

1209
01:03:02,154 --> 01:03:04,363
- captain: Hang on, son.
- l'm coming for you.

1210
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:06,657
Almost got you.

1211
01:03:06,825 --> 01:03:08,325
A little closer.

1212
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:10,786
No!

1213
01:03:10,954 --> 01:03:13,789
- No!
- cho: Nickolas, look out!

1214
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:15,624
Kuttner!

1215
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:18,419
( grunting )
Got you.

1216
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:21,630
Thanks.

1217
01:03:23,675 --> 01:03:26,385
come on, move it.
Get your asses up here.

1218
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:29,805
- We have a problem.
- What now?

1219
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:31,849
The power is out
to the airlock door.

1220
01:03:32,017 --> 01:03:34,226
lt's damaged on our side.

1221
01:03:34,394 --> 01:03:36,770
lt has to be closed
from out there.

1222
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:39,148
Kuttner: Anyone out there
will be torn to pieces.

1223
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:40,983
- l'll do it.
- No, you'll be trapped.

1224
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:43,944
- cho: captain, we'll find another way.
- You will do as you're ordered, Doctor.

1225
01:03:44,112 --> 01:03:45,529
You too, Mr. Borges.

1226
01:03:45,697 --> 01:03:48,324
Send this thing back to hell
where it belongs.

1227
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:50,743
And tell my wife she was right.

1228
01:03:50,911 --> 01:03:52,786
l should have retired
before this trip.

1229
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:04,590
All right, you bastards!

1230
01:04:04,758 --> 01:04:07,426
come and get me!

1231
01:04:12,891 --> 01:04:15,601
My God. He's gone.

1232
01:04:15,769 --> 01:04:17,686
The captain's gone.

1233
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:20,105
- Now what?
- l'll tell you what.

1234
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:23,317
We throw that damn thing
into the core like he told us.

1235
01:04:23,485 --> 01:04:25,611
This way.

1236
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:30,616
There it is.
The shock point drive.

1237
01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:34,286
The most powerful machine
mankind has ever created.

1238
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:35,746
cho:
How do we do it?

1239
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:37,373
We throw it into the core

1240
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:39,875
over the edge
of the platform. There.

1241
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:43,796
( screaming )

1242
01:04:43,964 --> 01:04:45,798
cho:
No, the shard!

1243
01:04:45,966 --> 01:04:48,634
l've got it.
Oh shit.

1244
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:51,136
( low roaring )

1245
01:04:57,936 --> 01:05:01,647
l am so fucking sick
of these fucking things.

1246
01:05:01,815 --> 01:05:04,483
You and me both.

1247
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:09,572
Oh shit!

1248
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:15,786
There's too many!

1249
01:05:15,954 --> 01:05:18,706
- cho: No!
- Borges: Get off,

1250
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:20,416
you son of a bitch!

1251
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:25,879
( whispering voices )

1252
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:30,009
Get away from him!

1253
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:31,510
What is Stross waiting for?

1254
01:05:31,678 --> 01:05:34,430
Throw it into the core!
Destroy it.

1255
01:05:34,598 --> 01:05:37,433
Kuttner:
Stross. Stross!

1256
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,060
( voices whispering )

1257
01:05:40,228 --> 01:05:42,688
Nolan, what the hell
are you doing?

1258
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:46,734
Destroy that thing now!

1259
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:49,695
- God damn it, Stross. Gimme that!
- Don't you see, lsabel?

1260
01:05:49,863 --> 01:05:54,074
- lt's too important to destroy--
- Oh shut up! ( grunts )

1261
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:58,871
Throw it!
Throw it now!

1262
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:08,881
( explosion )

1263
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:28,901
- lt's over.
- They're dead.

1264
01:06:29,069 --> 01:06:30,736
Finally.

1265
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:33,405
lt's finished.
( gasps )

1266
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:36,659
You know the rest.

1267
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:39,828
lt's a pity you didn't come
into direct contact

1268
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:42,206
with the shard.

1269
01:06:42,374 --> 01:06:45,334
You have a fine mind
and a strong will.

1270
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:49,046
l'm sure it would have...
resonated with you,

1271
01:06:49,214 --> 01:06:52,633
as it did with Stross.

1272
01:06:52,801 --> 01:06:54,760
Oh my God.

1273
01:06:54,928 --> 01:06:58,555
You knew what would happen if we
found the fragments, didn't you?

1274
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:00,683
We are not ignorant
of the marker's capabilities.

1275
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:03,977
You didn't just want the fragments.
You wanted us exposed to that thing!

1276
01:07:04,145 --> 01:07:06,563
All that horror,
all those deaths--

1277
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:08,107
you did it on purpose.

1278
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:11,819
You have nothing to fear.
ln the end, you won't suffer.

1279
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:13,946
- l promise.
- l don't understand.

1280
01:07:14,114 --> 01:07:17,241
During our session
we docked at the Sprawl.

1281
01:07:17,409 --> 01:07:20,119
There is someone here
who would like to speak to you.

1282
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:23,122
Ah, my dear Dr. cho.

1283
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:25,457
lt's a pleasure
to finally meet you.

1284
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:27,668
l'm so sorry
about any discomfort

1285
01:07:27,836 --> 01:07:29,503
this process may
have caused you,

1286
01:07:29,671 --> 01:07:32,297
but you must understand
how important this project is.

1287
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:35,801
Project?
What project? Who are you?

1288
01:07:35,969 --> 01:07:38,637
l? l am a simple Overseer

1289
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:40,806
to a greater purpose.

1290
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:43,809
We are working to change
the face of humanity, my dear.

1291
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:46,228
come with me and l'll explain.

1292
01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:49,898
Doctor, you and your team

1293
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:52,401
did a fine job.

1294
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:55,028
- My compliments.
- Yes sir.

1295
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:57,030
Thank you, sir.

1296
01:07:57,198 --> 01:07:59,032
l'm very happy
that you're pleased.

1297
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,785
Very pleased indeed.

1298
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:03,871
Good day.

1299
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:05,414
Praise the Great Marker.

1300
01:08:05,582 --> 01:08:08,917
l thought ourjobs
might be in jeopardy.

1301
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:11,003
Do you think
we might be promoted?

1302
01:08:11,171 --> 01:08:14,715
l'm sure the Overseer will see
that we are appropriately rewarded.

1303
01:08:14,883 --> 01:08:17,259
( gun cocks )

1304
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:27,853
Overseer: As a doctor,
you must see that the marker

1305
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:30,606
is the greatest discovery
in the history of humanity.

1306
01:08:30,774 --> 01:08:33,692
lt has the potential
to alter human DNA,

1307
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:36,445
to save our flawed dying species.

1308
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:38,906
lt turns people
into mindless monsters.

1309
01:08:39,073 --> 01:08:41,533
ls that the kind of nightmare
you want to unleash?

1310
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:44,536
lts power is controllable
under the right circumstances.

1311
01:08:44,704 --> 01:08:46,705
We just need some more time

1312
01:08:46,873 --> 01:08:49,249
to continue our research
into the marker.

1313
01:08:49,417 --> 01:08:53,545
Regrettably, these recent events
have become too public.

1314
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:56,256
We need an airtight cover story

1315
01:08:56,424 --> 01:08:58,550
and we'd like you
to help us with that.

1316
01:08:58,718 --> 01:09:01,386
You want me to just forget
everything that's happened?

1317
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:03,597
To my shipmates on the O'Bannon

1318
01:09:03,765 --> 01:09:05,641
and all those colonists on Aegis 7?

1319
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:09,770
We have significant resources
dedicated to this project, Dr. cho.

1320
01:09:09,938 --> 01:09:12,356
You'd be an important part
of the team.

1321
01:09:12,524 --> 01:09:16,068
ln a few years, you could be heading
the whole medical sciences division.

1322
01:09:16,236 --> 01:09:19,947
Please consider helping us
with this great work.

1323
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:21,907
l won't do it.

1324
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:23,992
You're playing God
with human life.

1325
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,036
People deserve to know the truth.

1326
01:09:26,204 --> 01:09:27,830
( sighs ) lsabel,

1327
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:30,916
l'm truly sorry you feel that way.

1328
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:33,085
What-- ( grunting )

1329
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:38,674
Secure the patient.

1330
01:09:38,842 --> 01:09:41,927
What are you doing? Stop it.
Get your hands off of me.

1331
01:09:42,095 --> 01:09:43,637
Stop! Let me go!

1332
01:09:43,805 --> 01:09:45,931
Everything is ready.

1333
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:47,558
You may proceed.

1334
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:51,353
- What are you going to do to me?
- Someone has to be held responsible.

1335
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:53,939
- ( whirring )
- No! Please don't do this.

1336
01:09:54,107 --> 01:09:57,067
Please, oh God! No!

1337
01:09:57,235 --> 01:10:00,320
No!

1338
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:06,660
Woman: Authorities today announced
the arrest of a suspect connected

1339
01:10:06,828 --> 01:10:09,121
to a recent series of terrorist attacks

1340
01:10:09,289 --> 01:10:12,291
on the USG lshimura, the USG O'Bannon

1341
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:14,543
and a mining colony on Aegis 7.

1342
01:10:14,711 --> 01:10:16,753
lsabel cho, a former medical officer

1343
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:18,130
assigned to the O'Bannon,

1344
01:10:18,298 --> 01:10:19,548
was rescued from a lifepod

1345
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:22,301
recovered after the O'Bannon's
engines were sabotaged

1346
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:23,802
and the ship destroyed.

1347
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:27,139
lnterrogators have received
a full confession from Miss cho,

1348
01:10:27,307 --> 01:10:29,641
and sentencing is scheduled
for next week...

1349
01:10:29,809 --> 01:10:31,643
The cover story is working well.

1350
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:34,354
People believe what
they wish to believe, Dr. Edgars.

1351
01:10:34,522 --> 01:10:35,814
- Yes.
- ( door opens )

1352
01:10:35,982 --> 01:10:39,151
Ah, it appears
Dr. Stross has arrived.

1353
01:10:39,319 --> 01:10:42,696
Excellent. That makes two
who have come into contact

1354
01:10:42,864 --> 01:10:46,325
- with the marker.
- Two? Who is the second?

1355
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:48,577
The engineer
who destroyed Aegis 7.

1356
01:10:48,745 --> 01:10:51,788
We found him half crazed
in an escape shuttle.

1357
01:10:51,956 --> 01:10:53,290
lmagine our luck.

1358
01:10:53,458 --> 01:10:56,501
Synchronicity reveals the will
of the cosmos, Dr. Edgars.

1359
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:58,837
Of course, Overseer.

1360
