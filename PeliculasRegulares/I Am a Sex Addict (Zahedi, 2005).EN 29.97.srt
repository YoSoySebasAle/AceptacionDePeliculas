1
00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:23,612
Hi. My name's Caveh,
and I'm about to be married.

2
00:00:23,682 --> 00:00:28,381
Um, this isn't my first time.
I've actually been married twice before.

3
00:00:28,454 --> 00:00:31,946
Um, but I'm pretty sure
it's going to be the last time.

4
00:00:32,024 --> 00:00:33,616
Um...

5
00:00:33,692 --> 00:00:37,059
How can I know that for sure?
I can't, obviously.

6
00:00:37,129 --> 00:00:40,758
My last two marriages fell apart because
I used to have this sex addiction problem,

7
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,926
and I don't really have that anymore.

8
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,970
Well, at least not in the way I used to.

9
00:00:46,038 --> 00:00:47,505
Um...

10
00:00:47,573 --> 00:00:51,669
You see, about ten years ago I started going
to these Sex Addicts Anonymous meetings.

11
00:00:51,743 --> 00:00:55,076
Hi. My name's Caveh.
I'm a sex addict.

12
00:00:55,147 --> 00:00:57,081
ALL: Hi, Caveh.

13
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,552
For me, it all started in Paris
about seven years ago.

14
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,322
Actually, I wasn't able
to raise enough money to go to Paris,

15
00:01:13,398 --> 00:01:15,593
so I'm just going to shoot it here
in San Francisco,

16
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:17,157
which is where I live now.

17
00:01:17,236 --> 00:01:19,466
So if you could just pretend this is Paris...

18
00:01:26,912 --> 00:01:29,005
...and that I'm 23 years old.

19
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,315
So anyway, I was walking
down the street one day...

20
00:01:38,524 --> 00:01:42,483
...when I saw this prostitute.

21
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:47,031
<i>The first thing that struck me</i>
<i>was what she was wearing.</i>

22
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:50,731
<i>But then I noticed her</i>
<i>uncanny resemblance to my wife.</i>

23
00:01:51,803 --> 00:01:55,034
<i>I thought it was strange that I should be</i>
<i>so turned on by this woman,</i>

24
00:01:55,107 --> 00:01:59,009
<i>and yet no longer the least bit</i>
<i>attracted to my wife.</i>

25
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,840
You fucking shut the fuck up!

26
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:03,245
<i>This is Caroline, my wife.</i>

27
00:02:03,315 --> 00:02:05,215
<i>How I ended up marrying her</i>

28
00:02:05,284 --> 00:02:09,414
<i>instead of the person I was</i>
<i>really in love with is a long story.</i>

29
00:02:09,488 --> 00:02:13,549
<i>But I should probably start by explaining</i>
<i>that I never would have married Caroline</i>

30
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,718
<i>if it hadn't been for the fact</i>
<i>that she was French...</i>

31
00:02:17,696 --> 00:02:19,561
<i>... and that her visa was about to expire.</i>

32
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:23,031
<i>Actually, let me back up a second.</i>

33
00:02:26,538 --> 00:02:28,301
<i>This is Anna.</i>

34
00:02:28,373 --> 00:02:31,774
<i>She was my first real girlfriend</i>
<i>and the love of my life.</i>

35
00:02:33,478 --> 00:02:36,709
<i>We had met in college</i>
<i>and had been together for two years.</i>

36
00:02:38,183 --> 00:02:41,710
<i>Now, I should probably explain</i>
<i>that ever since I was a kid,</i>

37
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:45,018
<i>I was obsessed</i>
<i>with finding my soul mate.</i>

38
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,422
<i>Every time I would meet a girl</i>
<i>I would think,</i>

39
00:02:47,492 --> 00:02:48,823
<i>"Is she the one?</i>

40
00:02:48,994 --> 00:02:50,427
<i>"Is she the one?</i>

41
00:02:50,495 --> 00:02:52,156
<i>Or is she the one?"</i>

42
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:55,926
<i>I was constantly falling in love</i>
<i>at the drop of a hat,</i>

43
00:02:56,001 --> 00:02:59,937
<i>but the girls I was attracted to</i>
<i>never seemed to be attracted to me.</i>

44
00:03:01,373 --> 00:03:03,671
<i>Things went on like this for years,</i>

45
00:03:03,742 --> 00:03:07,041
<i>and I was starting to despair</i>
<i>of ever finding a soul mate.</i>

46
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,077
<i>And then I met Anna.</i>

47
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,777
<i>She had the most beautiful soul</i>
<i>of anyone I had ever met.</i>

48
00:03:15,354 --> 00:03:18,448
<i>And the two years we spent together</i>
<i>were the happiest of my life.</i>

49
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:23,461
<i>It seemed that nothing</i>
<i>could ever come between us</i>

50
00:03:23,528 --> 00:03:25,325
<i>and that we would always be together.</i>

51
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,492
<i>The only problem was</i>
<i>that I was a philosophy major</i>

52
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,333
<i>and believed in free love.</i>

53
00:03:35,974 --> 00:03:39,102
<i>To me, monogamy was a form</i>
<i>of private property,</i>

54
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,941
<i>and I was against private property.</i>

55
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:43,606
Let me try one more a different way.

56
00:03:45,417 --> 00:03:49,877
<i>Our role models at the time were</i>
<i>Jean Paul Satre and Simone de Beauvoir</i>

57
00:03:49,955 --> 00:03:52,890
<i>because they were said to have had</i>
<i>a polygamous relationship</i>

58
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,926
<i>which had lasted their entire lives.</i>

59
00:03:54,993 --> 00:03:57,484
(birds chirping)

60
00:03:57,562 --> 00:04:00,554
<i>Anna had had affairs,</i>
<i>and so had I.</i>

61
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:03,591
<i>Of course, we both got jealous at times,</i>

62
00:04:03,669 --> 00:04:07,002
<i>but we believed that jealousy</i>
<i>was something to be transcended</i>

63
00:04:07,072 --> 00:04:09,939
<i>and that it was possible to love</i>
<i>more than one person at a time...</i>

64
00:04:10,008 --> 00:04:11,532
(beach music playing)

65
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,874
<i>... which is how I ended up</i>
<i>becoming involved with Caroline.</i>

66
00:04:17,516 --> 00:04:20,280
<i>We had met in Paris</i>
<i>a few months earlier</i>

67
00:04:20,352 --> 00:04:22,217
<i>and had spent three</i>
<i>idyllic days together.</i>

68
00:04:22,287 --> 00:04:26,986
I know I said that we couldn't afford
to shoot in Paris, and we really can't,

69
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:29,527
but the actress playing Caroline,

70
00:04:29,594 --> 00:04:34,054
her visa expired and she actually
had to go back to France

71
00:04:34,132 --> 00:04:36,862
before we could finish the film.

72
00:04:36,935 --> 00:04:39,665
Actually, let me back up a little.

73
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:43,435
You see, I had a really hard time
finding a French actress to play my wife.

74
00:04:43,508 --> 00:04:45,499
And then one day
I saw this woman on the street

75
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,772
who looked a lot like the real Caroline.

76
00:04:47,846 --> 00:04:51,043
So I started talking to her
and found out that she was French.

77
00:04:51,116 --> 00:04:52,845
So I asked her to audition.

78
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:56,547
CAVEH: So what do you do for money?
What's your business?

79
00:04:56,621 --> 00:04:58,179
I have a make-up company.

80
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,247
CAVEH: Oh, really?
Are you a make-up artist?

81
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:03,089
Well, actually,
I teach people to do make-up.

82
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:05,220
CAVEH: Really? So you're
a make-up artist teacher?

83
00:05:05,297 --> 00:05:06,491
Yes, I am.

84
00:05:06,565 --> 00:05:08,123
Now, I should probably explain

85
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,101
that the real Caroline
was also a make-up artist,

86
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:15,799
which I took as a sign that I had found
the perfect person to play the role.

87
00:05:15,874 --> 00:05:19,776
But then a few months later,
when we were about to do re-shoots,

88
00:05:19,845 --> 00:05:21,745
something really weird happened.

89
00:05:21,813 --> 00:05:25,010
Okay, something really weird
just happened.

90
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:30,715
I was looking for a French prostitute

91
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:33,223
to act in the movie
for the prostitute scene.

92
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,020
Where is it?

93
00:05:35,093 --> 00:05:36,458
There it is.

94
00:05:36,528 --> 00:05:41,295
I found this face that says Rebecca Lord.

95
00:05:41,366 --> 00:05:42,993
So I open it...

96
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:47,230
And I'm like...

97
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:50,035
"Porn Star Rebecca Lord, French."

98
00:05:50,108 --> 00:05:54,169
And I'm like, "Wow, she looks
so much like Caroline."

99
00:05:56,081 --> 00:05:58,140
I go down.

100
00:05:58,216 --> 00:06:01,049
I'm like, "She looks
so much like Caroline."

101
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:04,247
And then it says here,

102
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,984
"working first as a make-up artist."

103
00:06:07,058 --> 00:06:08,616
That's what Caroline was.

104
00:06:09,561 --> 00:06:14,225
And then it says that she'll be visiting
San Francisco August 7th through 11th.

105
00:06:14,299 --> 00:06:16,324
That's when we're shooting
our re-shoots.

106
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,596
And I'm like, "Wait a minute.

107
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:23,767
Caroline... is a prostitute?"

108
00:06:28,146 --> 00:06:29,841
And then there's all these movies.

109
00:06:30,982 --> 00:06:33,143
Here's her list of credits.

110
00:06:38,456 --> 00:06:40,117
<i>Sluts of France.</i>

111
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:48,196
So I had inadvertently cast a porn star
to play my French wife.

112
00:06:48,834 --> 00:06:51,132
But anyway, getting back to the story.

113
00:06:54,105 --> 00:06:55,902
<i>We had met in Paris a few months earlier</i>

114
00:06:55,974 --> 00:06:58,807
<i>and had spent three idyllic days together.</i>

115
00:07:00,812 --> 00:07:02,780
<i>I had been totally honest with Caroline</i>

116
00:07:02,848 --> 00:07:05,749
<i>about my relationship with Anna</i>
<i>and had even asked her...</i>

117
00:07:05,817 --> 00:07:08,115
Do you ever get jealous?

118
00:07:08,186 --> 00:07:09,278
<i>To which she had answered...</i>

119
00:07:09,354 --> 00:07:12,016
Life is too short for that.

120
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,650
<i>I was blown away by her answer</i>

121
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:18,184
<i>and I found myself starting</i>
<i>to fall in love with Caroline.</i>

122
00:07:19,331 --> 00:07:22,494
<i>But I still believed that Anna</i>
<i>was the true love of my life.</i>

123
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:27,770
<i>But then a month later,</i>
<i>Caroline flew to the States to see me,</i>

124
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:30,433
<i>and it was then that the trouble started.</i>

125
00:07:30,508 --> 00:07:33,443
<i>You see,</i>
<i>Anna became jealous of Caroline</i>

126
00:07:33,511 --> 00:07:36,446
<i>and insisted that I choose between them.</i>

127
00:07:36,514 --> 00:07:38,744
<i>I didn't want to choose between them.</i>

128
00:07:38,817 --> 00:07:40,876
<i>I wanted to be able to see them both.</i>

129
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,648
<i>But then Anna got</i>
<i>a summer internship in New York,</i>

130
00:07:44,723 --> 00:07:48,716
<i>and Caroline and I ended up</i>
<i>spending the summer together.</i>

131
00:07:48,793 --> 00:07:52,024
<i>Which is why when her visa expired.</i>

132
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:55,726
<i>I offered to marry her</i>
<i>so that she could stay in the States.</i>

133
00:07:55,934 --> 00:08:00,462
Now, I should probably explain
that I wasn't exactly the marrying type.

134
00:08:00,538 --> 00:08:03,507
In fact, I was totally against marriage.

135
00:08:03,575 --> 00:08:06,567
You see, I had grown up
during the Vietnam War

136
00:08:06,645 --> 00:08:09,705
<i>and I saw marriage as pat</i>
<i>of the same capitalist system</i>

137
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,840
<i>that had produced</i>
<i>the genocide in Vietnam.</i>

138
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:13,578
(explosions)

139
00:08:18,556 --> 00:08:19,784
(screaming)

140
00:08:19,858 --> 00:08:22,224
<i>But I was also influenced</i>
<i>by performance at...</i>

141
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:23,386
(screaming)

142
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,487
<i>... and by the idea of life itself</i>
<i>as a kind of performance piece.</i>

143
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,866
<i>And to me the institution of marriage</i>
<i>was so inherently absurd</i>

144
00:08:32,938 --> 00:08:36,066
<i>that I tried to subvert it</i>
<i>by treating it as performance art.</i>

145
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:37,233
I do.

146
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:41,006
<i>Except that the joke,</i>
<i>as it turned out, was on me.</i>

147
00:08:41,079 --> 00:08:44,446
<i>Because when Anna found out</i>
<i>that I had gotten married to Caroline,</i>

148
00:08:44,516 --> 00:08:46,507
<i>she didn't take it so well.</i>

149
00:08:46,584 --> 00:08:48,142
(phone slams)

150
00:08:48,219 --> 00:08:50,414
<i>And then I did something</i>
<i>incredibly dumb.</i>

151
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:54,415
<i>You see, Caroline and I were</i>
<i>about to run out of money...</i>

152
00:08:56,061 --> 00:09:00,998
<i>... and the idea of having to get a job was,</i>
<i>in my mind, a fate worse than death.</i>

153
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,534
<i>The only occupation I was interested in</i>

154
00:09:04,602 --> 00:09:07,230
<i>was that of famous filmmaker.</i>

155
00:09:07,305 --> 00:09:09,603
<i>But the few experimental films</i>
<i>that I had made</i>

156
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:13,906
<i>hadn't exactly been greeted</i>
<i>with enthusiasm by the film world.</i>

157
00:09:14,913 --> 00:09:17,905
(indistinct)

158
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:25,886
<i>To remedy this situation,</i>

159
00:09:25,957 --> 00:09:30,189
<i>I had recently written a script</i>
<i>about the French poet Arthur Rimbaud</i>

160
00:09:30,261 --> 00:09:33,253
<i>which I was convinced</i>
<i>would revolutionize cinema...</i>

161
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:39,333
<i>... and which Caroline insisted it would</i>
<i>be easy to raise money for in France.</i>

162
00:09:40,472 --> 00:09:43,964
It will be easy to raise money
for this in France.

163
00:09:45,276 --> 00:09:48,803
<i>But moving to France</i>
<i>turned out to be a disaster.</i>

164
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:54,576
<i>Most of the film producers I approached</i>
<i>wouldn't even talk to me.</i>

165
00:09:54,652 --> 00:09:58,520
<i>The few that did</i>
<i>just told me that I was nobody.</i>

166
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:03,325
<i>Meanwhile, my relationship</i>
<i>with Caroline had started to unravel.</i>

167
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:04,862
(crying)

168
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:08,922
<i>Caroline was insanely jealous of Anna</i>
<i>and would cry hysterically</i>

169
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,525
<i>whenever I would write her a letter</i>
<i>or talk to her on the phone.</i>

170
00:10:11,603 --> 00:10:13,127
Hi, how are you doing?

171
00:10:13,204 --> 00:10:16,503
<i>I was starting to feel trapped,</i>
<i>and it was hard not to blame Caroline</i>

172
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:21,068
<i>for having gotten in the way</i>
<i>of my relationship with Anna.</i>

173
00:10:21,146 --> 00:10:24,274
<i>And then one day,</i>
<i>I got a letter from Anna</i>

174
00:10:24,349 --> 00:10:26,977
<i>saying that she was going</i>
<i>to be in Amsterdam</i>

175
00:10:27,052 --> 00:10:29,452
<i>and asking</i>
<i>if I would like to meet her there.</i>

176
00:10:30,188 --> 00:10:31,177
(crying)

177
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:32,587
<i>I was ecstatic.</i>

178
00:10:32,657 --> 00:10:36,184
<i>I felt that I was finally being given a chance</i>
<i>to get back together with Anna.</i>

179
00:10:37,328 --> 00:10:41,458
<i>But Caroline knew that if I left</i>
<i>I would never come back,</i>

180
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:43,524
<i>so she decided to jump out a window.</i>

181
00:10:45,737 --> 00:10:47,705
<i>The thought of being responsible</i>
<i>for her death</i>

182
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,570
<i>- was way more guilt than I could handle.</i>
- (siren wails)

183
00:10:50,642 --> 00:10:53,611
- Caroline! Caroline!
- No! No!

184
00:10:53,678 --> 00:10:56,044
(grunting)

185
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,810
<i>So I agreed never to see Anna again.</i>

186
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:08,551
<i>It was by far the most</i>
<i>painful decision I ever made.</i>

187
00:11:09,561 --> 00:11:12,121
<i>But I did it because years</i>
<i>of going to Sunday school</i>

188
00:11:12,197 --> 00:11:15,428
<i>had taught me to equate virtue</i>
<i>with sacrifice.</i>

189
00:11:17,602 --> 00:11:20,162
- Can I come down?
- MAN: One more time.

190
00:11:20,238 --> 00:11:24,436
<i>I should probably also explain</i>
<i>that when I was in college</i>

191
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:26,272
<i>I had once asked my friend Arnold...</i>

192
00:11:26,344 --> 00:11:29,336
(coughs)

193
00:11:29,414 --> 00:11:33,043
What's your, like, ultimate goal in life?

194
00:11:33,118 --> 00:11:34,449
<i>And he had said...</i>

195
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:36,384
To be a saint.

196
00:11:36,454 --> 00:11:38,445
<i>I'd been blown away by his answer...</i>

197
00:11:39,924 --> 00:11:42,916
<i>... and I decided that I too</i>
<i>would try to become a saint.</i>

198
00:11:44,929 --> 00:11:48,387
<i>Which is why,</i>
<i>when Caroline asked me</i>

199
00:11:48,466 --> 00:11:52,027
<i>to cut all ties with the only person</i>
<i>I had ever truly loved,</i>

200
00:11:52,103 --> 00:11:53,900
<i>I agreed.</i>

201
00:11:53,972 --> 00:11:55,940
(ting)

202
00:11:57,475 --> 00:11:59,306
<i>When I found out much later</i>

203
00:11:59,377 --> 00:12:02,141
<i>that Anna had gotten married</i>
<i>to someone else,</i>

204
00:12:02,213 --> 00:12:04,443
<i>I was devastated.</i>

205
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:09,510
<i>I had still been secretly hoping that Caroline</i>
<i>and I would eventually break up</i>

206
00:12:09,587 --> 00:12:12,715
<i>and that Anna and I</i>
<i>would one day get back together.</i>

207
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:16,351
<i>But now I realized that it was really over.</i>

208
00:12:20,431 --> 00:12:23,059
<i>I tried my best to transcend my feelings</i>

209
00:12:23,134 --> 00:12:27,298
<i>and to resign myself</i>
<i>to a life of quiet desperation.</i>

210
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:30,569
<i>But the truth is I was incredibly angry.</i>

211
00:12:30,642 --> 00:12:32,542
<i>I was angry at God,</i>

212
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,373
<i>I was angry at Caroline,</i>

213
00:12:34,445 --> 00:12:36,936
<i>and I was angry at myself.</i>

214
00:12:37,015 --> 00:12:40,212
<i>But mostly I was angry at Caroline.</i>

215
00:12:41,619 --> 00:12:45,020
<i>And then one day</i>
<i>I was walking down the street</i>

216
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:48,820
<i>when I saw... this prostitute.</i>

217
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:53,591
<i>There was something about her</i>

218
00:12:53,665 --> 00:12:57,533
<i>that turned me on in a way</i>
<i>that I had never been turned on before.</i>

219
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,495
<i>It was as if I had been hypnotized.</i>

220
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,649
<i>And then I suddenly found myself saying</i>
<i>something that I had never said before.</i>

221
00:13:13,718 --> 00:13:15,481
<i>I said the words...</i>

222
00:13:17,322 --> 00:13:22,259
Now, I should probably explain that I had
always considered myself a feminist

223
00:13:22,327 --> 00:13:25,763
and had even marched
in an anti-pornography rally once.

224
00:13:28,066 --> 00:13:29,533
<i>Which is why</i>

225
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,933
when I suddenly found
myself saying the words...

226
00:13:33,571 --> 00:13:36,267
...I half expected the prostitute
to run screaming...

227
00:13:36,341 --> 00:13:37,501
(gasps)

228
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,403
<i>... or to slap me in the face.</i>

229
00:13:42,146 --> 00:13:46,674
<i>The fact that she didn't,</i>
<i>but smiled instead and said...</i>

230
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:50,345
<i>... made my head spin.</i>

231
00:14:06,371 --> 00:14:09,636
<i>Afterwards, I was a nervous wreck.</i>

232
00:14:11,776 --> 00:14:13,767
<i>I couldn't get her out of my mind.</i>

233
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:28,182
- CAROLINE: Hi.
- Hi.

234
00:14:38,269 --> 00:14:42,330
<i>I thought that if I masturbated,</i>
<i>I would get her out of my system.</i>

235
00:14:43,274 --> 00:14:45,242
<i>But it didn't work.</i>

236
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:51,537
<i>So after several days</i>
<i>of compulsive masturbation,</i>

237
00:14:51,616 --> 00:14:54,141
<i>I decided that I needed a new strategy.</i>

238
00:15:04,395 --> 00:15:07,956
<i>You see, I knew that she was</i>
<i>just a regular person.</i>

239
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:12,731
<i>But in my mind, I had somehow made her</i>
<i>into an image of erotic salvation.</i>

240
00:15:12,804 --> 00:15:13,793
(harp music plays)

241
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:18,570
<i>And it seemed that the only way to get her</i>
<i>off the erotic pedestal that I had put her on</i>

242
00:15:18,643 --> 00:15:20,873
<i>was to have a real conversation with her.</i>

243
00:15:25,016 --> 00:15:27,985
<i>Unfortunately, she wasn't there.</i>

244
00:15:42,033 --> 00:15:46,367
<i>I was mad at myself for having wasted</i>
<i>so many hours of my day,</i>

245
00:15:46,437 --> 00:15:48,701
<i>but I didn't want to leave empty-handed.</i>

246
00:16:18,669 --> 00:16:24,437
<i>I asked that same question to every</i>
<i>prostitute that was there that day.</i>

247
00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:26,841
<i>I might even have asked</i>
<i>some of them twice.</i>

248
00:16:28,012 --> 00:16:31,379
<i>Afterwards, I felt strangely euphoric.</i>

249
00:16:32,316 --> 00:16:36,514
<i>And I returned home feeling that I had</i>
<i>finally gotten this thing out of my system.</i>

250
00:16:36,587 --> 00:16:38,748
(moaning)

251
00:16:38,823 --> 00:16:40,484
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

252
00:16:40,558 --> 00:16:44,016
<i>Instead of fantasizing</i>
<i>about just the one prostitute,</i>

253
00:16:44,095 --> 00:16:46,495
<i>I was now fantasizing about all of them.</i>

254
00:16:48,266 --> 00:16:50,359
<i>I went back the next day...</i>

255
00:16:50,435 --> 00:16:53,199
<i>and the next day...</i>

256
00:16:53,271 --> 00:16:55,171
<i>and the next.</i>

257
00:16:57,008 --> 00:16:59,670
<i>At first it was enough just to talk to them...</i>

258
00:17:01,712 --> 00:17:03,373
<i>... and to fantasize</i>
<i>about them afterwards.</i>

259
00:17:03,448 --> 00:17:05,746
(moaning)

260
00:17:07,218 --> 00:17:11,154
<i>But after a while, just talking to them</i>
<i>was no longer enough.</i>

261
00:17:19,864 --> 00:17:22,458
Now, I know that a lot of guys
in my situation

262
00:17:22,533 --> 00:17:25,024
would have just gone ahead
and had sex with the prostitute

263
00:17:25,102 --> 00:17:27,127
and not told their wife about it.

264
00:17:27,205 --> 00:17:29,673
But I had this thing about honesty.

265
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,072
<i>You see, when I was a kid,</i>

266
00:17:32,143 --> 00:17:35,442
<i>my mother found out that my father</i>
<i>had been cheating on her</i>

267
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:39,040
<i>and made him drive my sister and me</i>
<i>to this other woman's apartment</i>

268
00:17:39,116 --> 00:17:42,210
<i>in order to humiliate him in front of us.</i>

269
00:17:42,286 --> 00:17:44,880
<i>I was too young to know what sex was,</i>

270
00:17:44,956 --> 00:17:47,322
<i>but I knew that it was a very bad thing</i>

271
00:17:47,391 --> 00:17:50,690
<i>and that it was responsible</i>
<i>for my parents' divorce.</i>

272
00:17:50,761 --> 00:17:53,958
<i>I was only eight years old at the time,</i>

273
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,022
<i>but I began to hate my father.</i>

274
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,001
<i>And I vowed to myself</i>
<i>that I would never be like him.</i>

275
00:18:05,176 --> 00:18:07,770
(crying)

276
00:18:12,984 --> 00:18:17,751
You know, if you really need
to see a prostitute, you can.

277
00:18:17,822 --> 00:18:21,758
I don't want to see a prostitute.
I want to try to resist.

278
00:18:21,826 --> 00:18:23,521
But I think I need your help.

279
00:18:23,594 --> 00:18:25,789
What do you want me to do?

280
00:18:25,863 --> 00:18:28,161
I just need to be able to talk to you.

281
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:31,201
I think if I can talk to you about it,
I'll be less tempted,

282
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:33,032
and it'll be easier for me to resist.

283
00:18:33,104 --> 00:18:35,698
You can talk to me about it.

284
00:18:35,773 --> 00:18:37,400
I can?

285
00:18:37,475 --> 00:18:39,807
Of course.

286
00:18:39,877 --> 00:18:41,401
Ohh.

287
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,044
God, I feel so much better.

288
00:18:48,719 --> 00:18:51,279
Are you tempted to have
intercourse with a prostitute

289
00:18:51,355 --> 00:18:55,553
or just to get a blow job?

290
00:18:55,626 --> 00:18:57,526
Oh, no. Just get a blow job.

291
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:00,826
I would never want to have intercourse
with one. That would gross me out.

292
00:19:00,898 --> 00:19:03,389
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

293
00:19:03,467 --> 00:19:06,197
You're the only person I'd ever want
to have intercourse with.

294
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,703
You promise?

295
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:10,468
Yeah, I promise.

296
00:19:14,512 --> 00:19:17,879
Is there anything I can do
to make you less tempted?

297
00:19:20,818 --> 00:19:24,379
Maybe if you could give me
blow jobs more often?

298
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:26,082
I don't mind.

299
00:19:26,157 --> 00:19:29,217
I can even give you a blow job
right now if you like.

300
00:19:31,429 --> 00:19:32,589
Okay.

301
00:19:36,767 --> 00:19:39,361
<i>I felt guilty accepting her offer,</i>

302
00:19:39,437 --> 00:19:41,803
<i>but I thought it might be a good idea.</i>

303
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,039
(moans)

304
00:19:54,118 --> 00:19:56,916
<i>I was still fantasizing</i>
<i>that she was a prostitute,</i>

305
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:59,718
<i>but the fact that she knew</i>
<i>and accepted this part of me</i>

306
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,088
<i>made it different than before.</i>

307
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:07,096
<i>It made it something we were sharing,</i>
<i>something that we were doing together.</i>

308
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:10,395
<i>And I felt that I was seeing Caroline</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

309
00:20:10,468 --> 00:20:12,493
(moaning)

310
00:20:13,604 --> 00:20:17,005
After I came, I was still hard.

311
00:20:17,074 --> 00:20:20,168
This was something that had
never happened to me before.

312
00:20:20,244 --> 00:20:23,179
It was as if my no longer
having to repress my sexuality

313
00:20:23,247 --> 00:20:27,343
had suddenly unleashed a backlog
of repressed sexual energy.

314
00:20:27,418 --> 00:20:29,818
So Caroline offered to give me
another blow job.

315
00:20:29,887 --> 00:20:34,324
(moaning loudly)

316
00:20:34,392 --> 00:20:37,919
To my astonishment, I was still hard.

317
00:20:37,995 --> 00:20:41,021
So Caroline offered to give me
yet another blow job.

318
00:20:41,098 --> 00:20:44,499
(moaning loudly)

319
00:20:44,568 --> 00:20:48,197
Afterwards, I was still hard.

320
00:20:48,272 --> 00:20:52,800
I had never seen anything like it,
and I actually started to get scared.

321
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:58,076
I was afraid that my erection had become
permanent and would never go away.

322
00:20:58,149 --> 00:21:00,617
Caroline offered to give me
yet another blow job,

323
00:21:00,685 --> 00:21:03,176
but I had recently
gotten a job as a film critic

324
00:21:03,254 --> 00:21:05,848
and I didn't want to be late
to my first screening.

325
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:13,792
On the way there
my erection finally subsided.

326
00:21:21,939 --> 00:21:25,136
At that moment I was filled
with boundless love for Caroline,

327
00:21:25,209 --> 00:21:27,677
and I felt closer to her than ever before.

328
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:33,312
As part of our newfound intimacy,

329
00:21:33,384 --> 00:21:36,285
I started pointing out to Caroline
the women I was attracted to.

330
00:21:36,353 --> 00:21:38,344
I like that one.

331
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,856
That one?
She's gross!

332
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,984
Not to me.

333
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,427
- I like that one, too.
- You're kidding, right?

334
00:21:46,497 --> 00:21:48,522
No, I'm serious.
She's exactly my type.

335
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:49,998
But she's so vulgar.

336
00:21:50,067 --> 00:21:53,798
I know. That's what I like
about her. It's true.

337
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:58,834
Did you see that woman?
I would love to have sex with her.

338
00:22:04,315 --> 00:22:07,512
It was great to be able
to be totally honest with Caroline,

339
00:22:07,585 --> 00:22:10,577
and I felt that I was finally having
the kind of open and honest relationship

340
00:22:10,654 --> 00:22:12,884
that I'd always dreamed of.

341
00:22:13,524 --> 00:22:16,220
Whoa! Look at those lips.

342
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,557
I would love a blow job from her.

343
00:22:21,332 --> 00:22:22,822
Did you see that?

344
00:22:25,402 --> 00:22:29,498
<i>But after a while,</i>
<i>Caroline couldn't take it anymore.</i>

345
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:49,516
- What's the matter?
- What do you think?

346
00:22:49,593 --> 00:22:53,290
I'm sick and tired of you
staring at other women all the time!

347
00:22:53,364 --> 00:22:55,491
- It's humiliating!
- What do you want me to do?

348
00:22:55,566 --> 00:22:58,364
You want me to hide the fact
that I'm attracted to somebody?

349
00:22:58,435 --> 00:23:03,498
How would you like it if you saw me drooling
over every guy I was attracted to? Huh?

350
00:23:03,574 --> 00:23:06,509
Well, I'd probably feel a little jealous,
but I'd try to transcend it.

351
00:23:07,778 --> 00:23:09,211
I would!

352
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,441
Didn't you say you wanted me
to be totally honest?

353
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,483
CAROLINE:
Well, I've changed my mind!

354
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:20,786
But my not being able
to be totally honest with her

355
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:23,088
made me feel alienated once again.

356
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:28,097
<i>And I started obsessing about the various</i>
<i>women I would see on the street.</i>

357
00:23:28,165 --> 00:23:29,598
<i>I remember this one time,</i>

358
00:23:29,667 --> 00:23:33,626
<i>I saw a woman on the subway</i>
<i>that I was particularly attracted to.</i>

359
00:23:35,673 --> 00:23:39,632
<i>I don't know what I was thinking.</i>
<i>but I suddenly started following her.</i>

360
00:23:44,682 --> 00:23:48,641
<i>For some reason, I was dying</i>
<i>to reach out and touch her butt.</i>

361
00:23:55,693 --> 00:23:57,627
<i>And I was trying to get up</i>
<i>the courage to do this</i>

362
00:23:57,695 --> 00:24:00,664
<i>when her boyfriend suddenly appeared.</i>

363
00:24:04,702 --> 00:24:09,662
<i>But I had been so turned on by her</i>
<i>that all I wanted to do was masturbate.</i>

364
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:15,679
<i>The only place I could find</i>
<i>was a confessional.</i>

365
00:24:20,718 --> 00:24:23,846
<i>There was something</i>
<i>about masturbating in a confessional</i>

366
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:26,253
<i>that appealed to my sense</i>
<i>of transgression.</i>

367
00:24:26,323 --> 00:24:32,284
<i>And it wasn't long before I had masturbated</i>
<i>in every cathedral in Paris.</i>

368
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:37,090
<i>Meanwhile, Caroline and I had</i>
<i>started fighting more and more,</i>

369
00:24:37,167 --> 00:24:39,931
<i>and I had started threatening</i>
<i>to have sex with a prostitute</i>

370
00:24:40,004 --> 00:24:42,097
<i>in order to get her</i>
<i>to stop fighting with me.</i>

371
00:24:42,172 --> 00:24:44,367
I'm going to go have sex with a prostitute!

372
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:48,468
Fine! Go get your dick sucked
by a prostitute! See if I care!

373
00:24:54,485 --> 00:24:56,214
Pssh!

374
00:24:56,287 --> 00:25:00,280
<i>And then one day I somehow</i>
<i>managed to convince myself</i>

375
00:25:00,357 --> 00:25:04,657
<i>that I was hurting her more by constantly</i>
<i>threatening to have sex with a prostitute</i>

376
00:25:04,728 --> 00:25:06,389
<i>than I would by just doing it</i>

377
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,795
<i>and getting it out of my system</i>
<i>once and for all.</i>

378
00:25:30,788 --> 00:25:33,655
<i>I wanted to reach out and touch her butt,</i>

379
00:25:33,724 --> 00:25:36,284
<i>but I felt shy.</i>

380
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,521
<i>I didn't know if that was allowed.</i>

381
00:26:24,174 --> 00:26:26,938
(water running)

382
00:26:33,017 --> 00:26:34,848
(turns water off)

383
00:27:10,654 --> 00:27:12,645
(moaning)

384
00:27:38,882 --> 00:27:40,179
Uh...

385
00:27:52,696 --> 00:27:54,561
Um...

386
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:10,974
(opens wrapper)

387
00:28:23,527 --> 00:28:25,051
<i>I was certainly tempted,</i>

388
00:28:25,129 --> 00:28:30,499
<i>but I had every intention of resisting having</i>
<i>intercourse until she said the words...</i>

389
00:28:33,303 --> 00:28:38,468
<i>For some reason, those words triggered</i>
<i>a chemical reaction in my brain.</i>

390
00:28:38,542 --> 00:28:40,976
<i>And it was suddenly as if I had no choice.</i>

391
00:28:49,052 --> 00:28:50,383
<i>I'm not sure why...</i>

392
00:28:51,288 --> 00:28:54,121
<i>... but the fact that her delivery</i>
<i>was so unconvincing</i>

393
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:56,318
<i>just turned me on even more.</i>

394
00:28:56,393 --> 00:28:58,384
(moaning)

395
00:29:26,156 --> 00:29:27,885
There's something I have to tell you.

396
00:29:27,958 --> 00:29:31,621
I know.
You had sex with a prostitute.

397
00:29:35,866 --> 00:29:37,356
How'd you know?

398
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,226
I can tell.

399
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:43,998
You're not mad at me?

400
00:29:45,175 --> 00:29:47,609
No, I'm not mad at you.

401
00:29:51,448 --> 00:29:53,780
I think it was the right thing to do

402
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:56,375
because now I've finally
gotten it out of my system.

403
00:30:00,624 --> 00:30:02,114
I love you.

404
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:05,990
I know. Just please,
go take a shower.

405
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:32,055
So, tell me what happened.

406
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:37,723
I told her the whole story.

407
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:41,753
But when I got to the part about
the intercourse, she got pretty upset.

408
00:30:41,832 --> 00:30:43,459
You had intercourse?

409
00:30:44,601 --> 00:30:46,091
Yeah.

410
00:30:46,169 --> 00:30:47,864
But I used a condom.

411
00:30:47,938 --> 00:30:50,168
You promised you weren't going to!

412
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,208
I know, I'm sorry.

413
00:30:53,744 --> 00:30:57,339
I tried not to, but I couldn't help myself.

414
00:31:00,417 --> 00:31:04,478
She said the words "rape me,"
and I just got really turned on after that.

415
00:31:05,555 --> 00:31:10,356
<i>Now, I think I should explain that this was</i>
<i>especially difficult for Caroline to hear</i>

416
00:31:10,427 --> 00:31:13,294
<i>because she herself had been raped.</i>

417
00:31:14,898 --> 00:31:18,766
<i>I had hoped that being completely honest</i>
<i>would bring us closer together,</i>

418
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,269
<i>but I had seriously miscalculated.</i>

419
00:31:27,377 --> 00:31:30,278
I don't want to have sex tonight.

420
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:32,747
I wasn't suggesting it.

421
00:31:32,816 --> 00:31:35,478
It's not to punish you, you know.

422
00:31:35,552 --> 00:31:36,541
I know.

423
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:40,147
It's just, I need more time to get over it.

424
00:31:40,223 --> 00:31:42,657
I understand.
Take all the time you need.

425
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,187
Thanks.

426
00:31:51,168 --> 00:31:53,830
<i>I was surprised at how little time</i>
<i>it took for her to get over it.</i>

427
00:31:53,904 --> 00:31:54,996
(moaning)

428
00:31:55,072 --> 00:31:56,937
<i>It only took three days.</i>

429
00:31:58,575 --> 00:32:03,012
<i>After that, everything seemed</i>
<i>pretty much back to normal.</i>

430
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:07,244
<i>Except for one thing...</i>
<i>Caroline started having fainting spells.</i>

431
00:32:09,152 --> 00:32:11,143
Caroline! Caroline!
What's the matter?

432
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:14,554
I don't know.
I don't feel well.

433
00:32:14,624 --> 00:32:18,822
<i>We went to see several doctors to try</i>
<i>to figure out what was wrong with her,</i>

434
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:21,386
<i>but none of them</i>
<i>could ever find anything.</i>

435
00:32:21,465 --> 00:32:23,092
She's perfectly fine.

436
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:31,902
You know, it's been over two months
since we've had sex.

437
00:32:34,378 --> 00:32:37,176
If you want me to suck you,
I'll suck you.

438
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:38,976
That's not why I'm saying it.

439
00:32:39,049 --> 00:32:41,711
I'm saying it because I think
maybe you're mad at me.

440
00:32:42,786 --> 00:32:47,314
I'm not mad at you.
I just haven't been feeling well.

441
00:32:48,859 --> 00:32:50,053
Okay.

442
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:58,867
Are you sure you don't want me
to give you oral sex?

443
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:02,200
Caveh, I really don't feel well.

444
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:03,466
Okay.

445
00:33:09,713 --> 00:33:12,113
This went on for a whole year,

446
00:33:12,182 --> 00:33:15,948
during which my desire to have sex
with a prostitute gradually returned.

447
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,134
<i>I tried to escape my marital unhappiness</i>

448
00:33:39,209 --> 00:33:41,109
<i>by throwing myself into my work...</i>

449
00:33:41,178 --> 00:33:42,338
Higher!

450
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:45,042
I said higher!

451
00:33:45,115 --> 00:33:47,879
<i>... but I was unable to raise money</i>
<i>for any of my film projects.</i>

452
00:33:47,951 --> 00:33:49,111
Higher!

453
00:33:51,521 --> 00:33:54,922
What's the matter with you?
Can't you jump higher than that?

454
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:04,223
<i>Out of desperation, I had applied</i>
<i>to film school back in the States.</i>

455
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:15,311
<i>Soon after we moved to Los Angeles,</i>

456
00:34:15,378 --> 00:34:19,041
<i>Caroline confessed to me that she</i>
<i>had fallen in love with my friend Gary...</i>

457
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:22,608
<i>... and then she fell in love</i>
<i>with my friend Keith...</i>

458
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:26,953
<i>... and then she fell in love</i>
<i>with my friend Teddy.</i>

459
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:30,220
<i>A week later</i>
<i>she and Teddy moved in together,</i>

460
00:34:30,293 --> 00:34:32,693
<i>and a year later they were married.</i>

461
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,191
<i>This is the real Caroline.</i>

462
00:34:36,266 --> 00:34:39,497
<i>I asked her to play herself in the movie,</i>
<i>but she declined.</i>

463
00:34:41,238 --> 00:34:43,638
<i>I tried to stay in touch over the years,</i>

464
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:47,666
<i>but after a while Caroline</i>
<i>stopped returning my calls.</i>

465
00:34:50,146 --> 00:34:53,980
I realize I haven't made it seem
like I was in love with Caroline,

466
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,985
but the truth is I really was,

467
00:34:57,053 --> 00:35:00,079
as much as I was capable
of loving anyone.

468
00:35:00,156 --> 00:35:03,057
I mean, I was only 26 at the time.

469
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:11,999
<i>After the break-up, all I could think about</i>
<i>was finding someone to have sex with.</i>

470
00:35:26,016 --> 00:35:28,075
Hi, can I get in?

471
00:35:28,151 --> 00:35:29,448
How much?

472
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:31,578
How much do you want to spend?

473
00:35:33,557 --> 00:35:34,717
Thirty?

474
00:35:34,791 --> 00:35:36,554
Okay. Can I get in?

475
00:35:36,626 --> 00:35:38,116
Okay.

476
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,960
- Hi, my name's Candy.
- Hi, I'm Bob.

477
00:35:47,037 --> 00:35:49,767
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

478
00:36:06,756 --> 00:36:10,624
- Where are we going?
- Pull over right here.

479
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:27,466
Can I have the money now?

480
00:36:27,544 --> 00:36:29,774
Oh, sure.

481
00:36:31,615 --> 00:36:33,310
Um...

482
00:36:33,383 --> 00:36:34,941
Do you have any change?

483
00:36:35,018 --> 00:36:38,146
No, but If you give me 40,
I'll make it extra good.

484
00:36:38,722 --> 00:36:40,019
Um...

485
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:42,887
Okay.

486
00:36:46,763 --> 00:36:48,128
Look out for cops, okay?

487
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:53,560
(moaning)

488
00:37:05,982 --> 00:37:07,540
Bye.

489
00:37:18,228 --> 00:37:20,958
<i>Afterwards, I felt euphoric.</i>

490
00:37:22,899 --> 00:37:24,594
<i>But by the time I got home,</i>

491
00:37:24,668 --> 00:37:27,501
<i>I felt empty and depressed.</i>

492
00:37:28,304 --> 00:37:32,001
<i>And I vowed never to have sex</i>
<i>with a prostitute again.</i>

493
00:37:34,644 --> 00:37:36,077
<i>But then a few days later,</i>

494
00:37:36,146 --> 00:37:40,048
<i>I found myself unable to stop obsessing</i>
<i>about that same prostitute.</i>

495
00:37:56,933 --> 00:37:58,195
Wanna date?

496
00:37:58,268 --> 00:37:59,565
<i>It was becoming a pattern.</i>

497
00:37:59,636 --> 00:38:02,628
<i>Every time I would have sex</i>
<i>with a prostitute,</i>

498
00:38:02,706 --> 00:38:05,675
<i>I would feel empty</i>
<i>and depressed afterwards,</i>

499
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:08,142
<i>and I would vow never to do it again.</i>

500
00:38:08,211 --> 00:38:12,170
And yet I honestly believed
that if I just did it enough times,

501
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:15,615
my desire to have sex with a prostitute
would eventually go away.

502
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,266
(moaning)

503
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:44,477
And then I met Christa.

504
00:38:44,547 --> 00:38:47,175
<i>I was walking down the hallway</i>
<i>at film school</i>

505
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,582
<i>when I saw her for the first time.</i>

506
00:38:49,652 --> 00:38:51,313
Hi.

507
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:56,551
<i>It was unusual for a woman</i>
<i>I had never met to say hi to me.</i>

508
00:38:57,427 --> 00:39:01,090
<i>Because she did, I assumed</i>
<i>she wanted to have sex.</i>

509
00:39:06,536 --> 00:39:09,528
<i>And then a few days later,</i>
<i>I saw her again.</i>

510
00:39:18,281 --> 00:39:19,714
Excuse me.

511
00:39:21,117 --> 00:39:23,381
Do you know
how to open these?

512
00:39:23,453 --> 00:39:25,045
I can't figure it out.

513
00:39:25,622 --> 00:39:27,249
I can try.

514
00:39:31,361 --> 00:39:32,521
Here you go.

515
00:39:32,595 --> 00:39:34,825
It just twists off, huh?

516
00:39:38,134 --> 00:39:39,567
You like Capra?

517
00:39:39,636 --> 00:39:41,399
I love Capra.

518
00:39:42,539 --> 00:39:45,337
- Hi, my name's Caveh.
- Hi, I'm Christa.

519
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,535
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

520
00:39:49,312 --> 00:39:53,442
<i>So anyway, she invited me to a party</i>
<i>she was giving that Friday night...</i>

521
00:39:55,251 --> 00:39:57,719
<i>... and I went,</i>
<i>hoping to have sex with her.</i>

522
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:03,087
- Is Christa here?
- Yeah, come on in.

523
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:05,389
(music playing)

524
00:40:10,166 --> 00:40:12,828
<i>I failed to get her to have sex with me.</i>

525
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:16,864
<i>But I did get her to lend me</i>
<i>a copy of her screenplay.</i>

526
00:40:17,907 --> 00:40:19,932
<i>It was one of the best screenplays</i>
<i>I'd ever read.</i>

527
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:31,316
<i>And I felt that I had finally found</i>
<i>someone that I could relate to.</i>

528
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:35,824
<i>I called her immediately</i>
<i>and asked her out.</i>

529
00:40:46,669 --> 00:40:48,296
<i>It was then that it happened,</i>

530
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:52,863
<i>I looked into her eyes</i>
<i>and I saw her soul.</i>

531
00:40:54,477 --> 00:40:58,379
<i>Until then, she had just been someone</i>
<i>that I wanted something from.</i>

532
00:40:59,549 --> 00:41:03,383
<i>But at that moment I suddenly</i>
<i>saw that she was a real human being,</i>

533
00:41:03,453 --> 00:41:06,354
<i>with needs and feelings of her own.</i>

534
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:09,280
<i>It scared the shit out of me.</i>

535
00:41:19,669 --> 00:41:24,902
<i>And then one night we were watching</i>
Vivre Sa Vie <i>by Jean-Luc Godard,</i>

536
00:41:24,974 --> 00:41:27,738
<i>about a woman who becomes a prostitute.</i>

537
00:41:29,212 --> 00:41:31,146
You know what I heard?

538
00:41:31,915 --> 00:41:32,973
What?

539
00:41:33,049 --> 00:41:36,450
I heard that Godard has
a prostitute fetish in real life.

540
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:38,350
Can you believe that?

541
00:41:38,888 --> 00:41:40,321
Yeah.

542
00:41:42,158 --> 00:41:46,288
I can't.
He seems so sensitive to women.

543
00:41:46,362 --> 00:41:47,852
Well, that doesn't mean anything.

544
00:41:47,931 --> 00:41:52,891
I mean, I'm sensitive to women,
and I have a prostitute fetish.

545
00:41:54,671 --> 00:41:56,468
You're kidding, right?

546
00:41:56,539 --> 00:41:58,234
No, I'm serious.

547
00:42:00,009 --> 00:42:01,533
I can't believe that.

548
00:42:01,611 --> 00:42:04,239
Well, it's true.

549
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:08,273
Caveh, how is that possible?
I mean, how can you justify that to yourself?

550
00:42:08,351 --> 00:42:10,842
Well, I agree it's not
super spiritual or anything,

551
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,855
but I don't think it's so terrible either.

552
00:42:13,923 --> 00:42:17,882
Caveh, it's like rape!
Those women have no choice.

553
00:42:17,961 --> 00:42:20,794
Everybody has a choice.
Or else nobody does.

554
00:42:20,863 --> 00:42:22,626
I can't believe you're saying this.

555
00:42:22,699 --> 00:42:24,428
Well, it's true.

556
00:42:26,769 --> 00:42:28,066
What are you doing?

557
00:42:28,137 --> 00:42:31,436
I'm sorry. I have to leave.
I feel like I'm going to be sick.

558
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:34,169
Why, because I've had sex
with prostitutes?

559
00:42:34,243 --> 00:42:35,870
Caveh, you don't understand.

560
00:42:35,945 --> 00:42:39,779
I literally feel like
I'm going to throw up. I have to go.

561
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:43,284
Christa!

562
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:44,615
(door slams)

563
00:42:50,727 --> 00:42:53,093
<i>A few days later, I saw her again.</i>

564
00:42:53,162 --> 00:42:54,652
Hi.

565
00:42:54,831 --> 00:42:55,991
Hi.

566
00:43:01,938 --> 00:43:04,338
- Still feeling nauseous?
- No.

567
00:43:05,174 --> 00:43:07,267
Sure you don't mind
being seen with me?

568
00:43:07,343 --> 00:43:09,038
Stop it.

569
00:43:09,112 --> 00:43:12,707
I'm sorry. I just felt like
you thought I was disgusting.

570
00:43:12,782 --> 00:43:14,750
I don't think that.

571
00:43:15,918 --> 00:43:18,318
It's not like I'm still doing it.

572
00:43:18,388 --> 00:43:20,481
I know. I'm sorry.

573
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:23,385
I don't want to have to
hide anything from you.

574
00:43:23,459 --> 00:43:25,984
- Don't you want me to be honest?
- I do.

575
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,394
Caveh, let's make up.

576
00:43:39,275 --> 00:43:42,005
<i>A few weeks later</i>
<i>it was my birthday.</i>

577
00:43:43,179 --> 00:43:46,580
<i>And I convinced Christa to take</i>
<i>Ecstasy with me to celebrate.</i>

578
00:43:49,852 --> 00:43:52,480
- Okay.
- Thank you.

579
00:43:55,358 --> 00:43:59,294
<i>That night, we felt closer</i>
<i>to each other than ever before.</i>

580
00:43:59,362 --> 00:44:03,924
<i>But Ecstasy isn't just a love drug.</i>
<i>It's also a truth serum.</i>

581
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,900
I love you so much.

582
00:44:05,968 --> 00:44:07,526
I love you, too.

583
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,571
- You do?
- I do.

584
00:44:12,742 --> 00:44:15,506
I don't want there to be
any secrets between us.

585
00:44:17,213 --> 00:44:18,703
Caveh, I don't.

586
00:44:20,883 --> 00:44:22,373
I don't either.

587
00:44:22,819 --> 00:44:25,481
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

588
00:44:25,555 --> 00:44:27,546
- You'll tell me the truth?
- Yeah.

589
00:44:28,591 --> 00:44:33,028
There isn't anything that you've never
told me before, is there?

590
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:36,025
I can take it.

591
00:44:36,099 --> 00:44:38,567
- Yeah, there's one thing.
- What?

592
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:41,694
I've been wanting to tell you
but I've been scared.

593
00:44:41,771 --> 00:44:45,673
- Caveh, you can tell me anything.
- Okay. Okay.

594
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:50,611
- Sometimes when we're having sex...
- Yeah?

595
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,910
...I fantasize about other women.

596
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,554
<i>Christa was devastated by my confession</i>

597
00:44:59,622 --> 00:45:02,523
<i>and became hyper-sensitive</i>
<i>about other women.</i>

598
00:45:04,594 --> 00:45:07,358
<i>She would notice them</i>
<i>even before I would</i>

599
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:11,491
<i>and immediately scrutinize my face</i>
<i>for any sign of interest.</i>

600
00:45:11,567 --> 00:45:15,162
<i>It was unnerving after a while.</i>
<i>So I tried to be upfront about it.</i>

601
00:45:15,238 --> 00:45:16,762
She's pretty sexy.

602
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,501
She's more your type
than I am, isn't she?

603
00:45:19,575 --> 00:45:21,338
What are you talking about?

604
00:45:26,983 --> 00:45:30,578
And then one day I was on my way
to meet Christa for lunch

605
00:45:30,653 --> 00:45:33,019
when I decided to stop and get some gas.

606
00:45:40,897 --> 00:45:43,627
<i>There was something about the way</i>
<i>the woman was bending over</i>

607
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,394
<i>that turned me on.</i>

608
00:45:55,845 --> 00:45:57,836
- Hi. I'm really sorry I'm late.
- Caveh, I've been waiting.

609
00:45:57,914 --> 00:46:00,747
I know, I'm sorry.
I had a little masturbatory episode.

610
00:46:00,816 --> 00:46:02,044
What?

611
00:46:03,686 --> 00:46:05,779
I had to stop for gas, and...

612
00:46:05,855 --> 00:46:08,323
Did you just say
"a little masturbatory episode"?

613
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:09,983
Yeah. I had to stop for gas,

614
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:13,495
and there was this woman who was
kind of bending over to put gas in her car,

615
00:46:13,563 --> 00:46:15,827
and she was really sexy,

616
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:20,995
and I just got really turned on
at the way she was bending over,

617
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:26,133
and I stopped at my apartment
so I could, you know, masturbate.

618
00:46:26,209 --> 00:46:29,007
But it was really no big deal.
I just thought I should tell you.

619
00:46:29,078 --> 00:46:30,238
I just...

620
00:46:37,286 --> 00:46:39,083
- I just don't want to talk about it.
- What about truth?

621
00:46:39,155 --> 00:46:42,386
- I don't want you to tell me every single day.
- Don't you want to know the truth?

622
00:46:42,458 --> 00:46:44,653
I already know these things
are happening, Caveh.

623
00:46:44,727 --> 00:46:47,287
I know you. I know you.
I understand you.

624
00:46:47,363 --> 00:46:49,854
And believe me,
it will be much better with us.

625
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,331
Don't tell me.

626
00:46:52,501 --> 00:46:55,334
- I don't want to know.
- Okay, fine.

627
00:46:55,404 --> 00:46:56,894
Don't tell me.

628
00:46:58,874 --> 00:47:03,573
And then one night I happened to watch
a news program on massage parlors.

629
00:47:03,646 --> 00:47:07,104
<i>Vice investigators say</i>
<i>they've recently found seven brothels</i>

630
00:47:07,183 --> 00:47:09,208
<i>masquerading as massage parlors.</i>

631
00:47:09,285 --> 00:47:12,721
<i>Police say these busts</i>
<i>are just the tip of the iceberg</i>

632
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:17,054
<i>and that many massage parlors</i>
<i>are actually fronts for prostitution.</i>

633
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:20,493
<i>This is Maya Ellington</i>
<i>reporting for Channel 3 News.</i>

634
00:47:34,043 --> 00:47:35,340
Want a massage?

635
00:47:35,411 --> 00:47:36,435
Um...

636
00:47:36,512 --> 00:47:38,639
Yeah. Um...

637
00:47:38,714 --> 00:47:40,511
How much?

638
00:47:40,583 --> 00:47:43,313
Forty dollars for half-hour.

639
00:47:43,386 --> 00:47:44,853
Um...

640
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,979
Does that include everything?

641
00:47:47,056 --> 00:47:49,456
That includes a half-hour.

642
00:47:49,525 --> 00:47:51,015
Um...

643
00:47:51,093 --> 00:47:54,153
- Who gives the massages?
- Different girls.

644
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:56,790
- Are you one of them?
- No.

645
00:47:56,866 --> 00:47:58,231
Um...

646
00:47:58,301 --> 00:48:00,098
Can I see what they look like?

647
00:48:00,169 --> 00:48:02,603
No. You have to pay first.

648
00:48:05,308 --> 00:48:07,435
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

649
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:09,000
- I'm sorry.
- Get out of here!

650
00:48:09,078 --> 00:48:10,067
I'm sorry.

651
00:48:10,146 --> 00:48:12,114
You get out of here!

652
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:13,705
Get out of here!

653
00:48:16,085 --> 00:48:18,986
<i>I visited every massage parlor in L.A.</i>

654
00:48:22,325 --> 00:48:24,259
<i>At first, it turned me on</i>

655
00:48:24,327 --> 00:48:27,922
<i>just to grab the receptionists' breasts</i>
<i>and get thrown out.</i>

656
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:32,732
<i>But after a while, even this</i>
<i>was no longer exciting enough.</i>

657
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:38,598
And then one day I had an idea.

658
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:51,247
I think maybe the reason I haven't
been able to get over my prostitute fetish

659
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:54,551
is because I've never really
gone all the way with one.

660
00:48:54,623 --> 00:48:55,988
What do you mean?

661
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:58,492
Greg was my best friend at the time.

662
00:48:58,561 --> 00:49:03,658
<i>We had met at UCLA and had made</i>
<i>a few student films together.</i>

663
00:49:03,733 --> 00:49:08,067
I mean, I've never really treated one
the way I do in my fantasies.

664
00:49:08,137 --> 00:49:09,570
Which is how?

665
00:49:09,638 --> 00:49:11,606
Which is pretty violent.

666
00:49:11,674 --> 00:49:15,371
Like in my fantasies
I'll grab whoever it is by the hair

667
00:49:15,444 --> 00:49:19,403
and I'll make her say things like
"I wanna suck your dick" and stuff,

668
00:49:19,482 --> 00:49:22,383
and maybe call her a bitch or a slut,

669
00:49:22,451 --> 00:49:26,387
and then start fucking her really hard
in the mouth and make her gag and stuff.

670
00:49:26,455 --> 00:49:27,717
Interesting.

671
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:30,350
But in real life, I've never done that.

672
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:32,257
Why not?

673
00:49:32,328 --> 00:49:35,263
Because I want them to like me.

674
00:49:35,331 --> 00:49:37,026
I see.

675
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:41,229
So what I'm thinking is that maybe
if I went to a prostitute one last time

676
00:49:41,303 --> 00:49:44,898
and just did everything
I always fantasize about doing,

677
00:49:44,974 --> 00:49:49,843
then I think maybe I could get it
out of my system once and for all.

678
00:49:49,912 --> 00:49:52,745
Will they let you do those things?

679
00:49:52,815 --> 00:49:54,009
Um...

680
00:49:54,083 --> 00:49:56,017
I assume.

681
00:49:57,486 --> 00:49:59,477
Sounds like it's worth a try.

682
00:50:01,757 --> 00:50:03,247
It is, right?

683
00:50:03,325 --> 00:50:05,725
Yeah, give it a try.

684
00:50:05,795 --> 00:50:08,855
But I couldn't do it behind Christa's back.

685
00:50:08,931 --> 00:50:12,128
I mean, I had to tell her, right?

686
00:50:13,269 --> 00:50:14,668
Are you serious?

687
00:50:14,737 --> 00:50:17,433
Christa, I can't keep repressing my lust.
It's not healthy.

688
00:50:17,506 --> 00:50:19,497
What do you want me to do?
Say okay?

689
00:50:19,575 --> 00:50:21,099
- Yeah.
- Well, it's not okay.

690
00:50:21,177 --> 00:50:24,044
If you have sex with a prostitute,
it's over between us!

691
00:50:24,113 --> 00:50:27,310
Christa, please, try to understand.
It's just something that I have to do.

692
00:50:27,383 --> 00:50:30,113
I can't believe you'd be willing
to sacrifice our relationship

693
00:50:30,186 --> 00:50:32,746
just in order to fulfill some sick fantasy!

694
00:50:32,822 --> 00:50:34,813
I have no intention
of sacrificing our relationship.

695
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:36,881
I'd be doing this
to strengthen our relationship.

696
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:42,759
Christa, how is this constructive?

697
00:50:45,067 --> 00:50:48,400
The last thing I wanted was to lose Christa,

698
00:50:48,471 --> 00:50:51,201
so I decided to get professional help.

699
00:50:51,273 --> 00:50:56,677
CAVEH: My mother had like
a phobia about changing my diapers.

700
00:50:56,745 --> 00:51:02,684
So she had like this aversion
to, you know, diapers.

701
00:51:03,252 --> 00:51:06,016
Any recent dreams you can remember?

702
00:51:06,088 --> 00:51:08,022
Um...

703
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:13,426
I had this dream
where I was sitting on the toilet,

704
00:51:13,496 --> 00:51:16,624
and then I was getting
smaller and smaller,

705
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:18,462
and then I fell in.

706
00:51:22,338 --> 00:51:24,067
I need you, Mommy!

707
00:51:24,139 --> 00:51:26,630
- Louder.
- I need you, Mommy!

708
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:29,007
- Harder.
- I need you, Mommy!

709
00:51:29,078 --> 00:51:30,978
- That's it.
- I need you, Mommy!

710
00:51:31,146 --> 00:51:33,341
- That's it.
- I need you, Mommy!

711
00:51:33,415 --> 00:51:36,578
- Louder!
- I need you, Mommy!

712
00:51:36,652 --> 00:51:38,984
<i>But none of it seemed to help.</i>

713
00:51:40,322 --> 00:51:43,883
<i>Finally, after weeks</i>
<i>of struggling to resist,</i>

714
00:51:43,959 --> 00:51:47,087
<i>I decided to do what I had been</i>
<i>struggling for weeks not to do,</i>

715
00:51:47,162 --> 00:51:49,687
<i>even if it meant losing Christa.</i>

716
00:51:58,974 --> 00:52:00,305
Take off clothes.

717
00:52:01,377 --> 00:52:02,742
Suck me.

718
00:52:02,811 --> 00:52:04,802
You give me money?

719
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,108
Oh, yeah.

720
00:52:07,016 --> 00:52:09,576
Um, twenty now,

721
00:52:09,652 --> 00:52:12,382
and twenty later
if you do everything I say.

722
00:52:15,658 --> 00:52:17,558
No, standing up.

723
00:52:22,464 --> 00:52:24,125
Yeah.

724
00:52:24,199 --> 00:52:26,497
(moaning)

725
00:52:27,536 --> 00:52:29,333
Yeah.

726
00:52:29,405 --> 00:52:31,703
Oh, wait.
First say, "I wanna suck your dick."

727
00:52:31,774 --> 00:52:35,574
No, wait.
First say, "I wanna suck your dick."

728
00:52:36,745 --> 00:52:40,010
No understand very good English.

729
00:52:41,417 --> 00:52:46,582
Say, "I want to suck your dick."

730
00:52:48,424 --> 00:52:50,187
No understand.

731
00:52:51,694 --> 00:52:53,992
Say "I"...

732
00:52:54,063 --> 00:52:58,193
No, wait. Say "I"..."I"...

733
00:52:58,267 --> 00:53:01,896
Say "I."
"I"..."I"...

734
00:53:01,971 --> 00:53:03,632
"I." Say "I."

735
00:53:03,806 --> 00:53:06,707
"I." Say "I."

736
00:53:06,775 --> 00:53:12,680
<i>The fact that she had no idea what I was</i>
<i>saying took a lot of the thrill out of it.</i>

737
00:53:12,748 --> 00:53:15,911
Okay, fine, just suck it.

738
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:19,451
(moaning)

739
00:53:21,457 --> 00:53:24,119
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

740
00:53:24,193 --> 00:53:28,186
Suck it. Yeah, suck it, you bitch.

741
00:53:28,263 --> 00:53:31,061
Yeah, suck it, slut.

742
00:53:31,133 --> 00:53:32,464
Yeah.

743
00:53:32,534 --> 00:53:34,525
(moaning)

744
00:53:35,704 --> 00:53:39,140
Oh, yeah, you love it, don't you?
You little slut.

745
00:53:39,208 --> 00:53:41,199
(moaning)

746
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:45,237
Hold on, hold on.

747
00:53:45,314 --> 00:53:46,338
Um...

748
00:53:46,415 --> 00:53:48,178
Stand over here.

749
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:51,185
Get over here. Yeah.

750
00:53:55,090 --> 00:53:57,081
(moaning)

751
00:54:10,039 --> 00:54:14,100
<i>Afterwards, the most</i>
<i>amazing thing happened.</i>

752
00:54:14,176 --> 00:54:17,339
<i>She patted me affectionately</i>
<i>on the butt and said...</i>

753
00:54:17,413 --> 00:54:18,778
Come again.

754
00:54:24,086 --> 00:54:28,386
<i>I had gone there to express that pat</i>
<i>of myself which I was most ashamed of,</i>

755
00:54:28,457 --> 00:54:32,951
<i>and yet she had smiled at me afterwards</i>
<i>with acceptance and compassion.</i>

756
00:54:33,028 --> 00:54:36,361
<i>I felt that I had just had</i>
<i>a mystical experience</i>

757
00:54:36,432 --> 00:54:39,094
<i>and that something inside me</i>
<i>had finally changed.</i>

758
00:54:41,203 --> 00:54:43,433
<i>That night I went over to Christa's</i>

759
00:54:43,505 --> 00:54:46,269
<i>to tell her that I was ready to be</i>
<i>in a committed relationship.</i>

760
00:54:46,809 --> 00:54:49,642
- What do you want?
- I want to get back together.

761
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:52,169
(lock bolts)

762
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:55,114
<i>Christa was understandably skeptical</i>
<i>about my transformation...</i>

763
00:55:00,189 --> 00:55:04,649
<i>... but I eventually managed</i>
<i>to convince her that I was finally cured.</i>

764
00:55:06,995 --> 00:55:09,327
Now at this point in the film,

765
00:55:09,398 --> 00:55:13,095
there's supposed to be a scene
in which Christa is giving me a blow job.

766
00:55:13,168 --> 00:55:15,534
Not a real blow job, a fake blow job.

767
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:20,041
But the actress playing Christa
has refused to do the scene.

768
00:55:21,009 --> 00:55:26,174
Do you feel like it's domineering
or something to women?

769
00:55:26,248 --> 00:55:32,118
No, it's just something that I'm
not comfortable with doing on screen.

770
00:55:32,187 --> 00:55:33,779
Could you please do it anyway?

771
00:55:33,856 --> 00:55:35,016
No.

772
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:38,617
So if you could just imagine
that she's giving me a blow job,

773
00:55:38,694 --> 00:55:41,663
and if you could also imagine
the following voice-over...

774
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:46,662
<i>And sex suddenly became very different.</i>

775
00:55:46,735 --> 00:55:49,704
<i>Instead of fantasizing</i>
<i>that Christa was a stranger,</i>

776
00:55:49,772 --> 00:55:53,799
<i>I tried to just be present</i>
<i>to what was happening.</i>

777
00:55:53,876 --> 00:55:55,935
<i>And it was overwhelming.</i>

778
00:55:56,011 --> 00:55:58,844
<i>I felt almost too loved.</i>

779
00:55:58,914 --> 00:56:02,907
<i>I couldn't believe that another</i>
<i>human being could love me enough</i>

780
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:05,146
<i>to actually want to take my penis,</i>

781
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:08,348
<i>which I had always</i>
<i>considered ugly and dirty,</i>

782
00:56:08,423 --> 00:56:10,152
<i>into her mouth,</i>

783
00:56:10,225 --> 00:56:12,989
<i>or would be willing</i>
<i>to swallow my semen.</i>

784
00:56:19,768 --> 00:56:21,395
- Hey, sweetie.
- CHRISTA: Hi.

785
00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:24,928
I missed you.
How's it going?

786
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:26,531
All right.

787
00:56:26,608 --> 00:56:28,098
Why, what's the matter?

788
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:34,374
There's something I have to tell you.

789
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:36,310
What?

790
00:56:38,687 --> 00:56:42,214
Remember I told you I was going
to see a movie with Robby tonight?

791
00:56:42,291 --> 00:56:43,622
Yeah.

792
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:47,658
Well...

793
00:56:49,665 --> 00:56:51,292
Afterwards...

794
00:56:53,635 --> 00:56:57,162
I couldn't help myself,
and we started making out.

795
00:56:57,706 --> 00:57:00,266
What do you mean
you couldn't help yourself?

796
00:57:00,342 --> 00:57:03,641
I don't know. It just happened.
I wasn't planning it or anything.

797
00:57:05,447 --> 00:57:07,472
What do you mean by "making out"?

798
00:57:08,584 --> 00:57:10,711
We just like kissed and stuff.

799
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:14,111
What do you mean "and stuff"?

800
00:57:15,624 --> 00:57:18,149
We just fooled around a little.

801
00:57:20,929 --> 00:57:22,487
And then what happened?

802
00:57:23,966 --> 00:57:26,764
I'm supposed to see him
tomorrow night for dinner.

803
00:57:26,835 --> 00:57:30,635
But I'm going to tell him I made a mistake
and I can't keep seeing him in that way.

804
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:34,940
Caveh, I'm sorry.

805
00:57:40,782 --> 00:57:45,810
<i>I felt incredibly jealous, but I tried</i>
<i>my best to transcend my feelings.</i>

806
00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:51,382
I can't do this.
I feel like I'm kissing Robby.

807
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:54,156
I feel I can taste
his saliva in your mouth.

808
00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:58,493
Well, how do you think I feel
when you have sex with a prostitute?

809
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:04,064
I could see her point,

810
00:58:04,139 --> 00:58:07,540
and I knew that I had no right to be jealous
after everything that I had put her through.

811
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:10,134
But I just couldn't help myself.

812
00:58:11,713 --> 00:58:13,908
That night, I called Robby
at 3:00 in the morning

813
00:58:13,982 --> 00:58:17,975
and I asked him as a personal favor to me
to please stop making out with Christa.

814
00:58:18,053 --> 00:58:20,248
And he agreed.

815
00:58:20,322 --> 00:58:23,018
Thanks, Robby.
I really appreciate it.

816
00:58:23,592 --> 00:58:27,221
<i>But he lied.</i>
<i>They made out again the next night.</i>

817
00:58:27,296 --> 00:58:30,823
- You promised you wouldn't.
- I know. I'm sorry.

818
00:58:30,899 --> 00:58:32,992
What were you thinking, Christa?

819
00:58:33,068 --> 00:58:35,798
I don't know.
I just couldn't help myself.

820
00:58:37,406 --> 00:58:40,000
<i>She was starting to sound like me.</i>

821
00:58:40,075 --> 00:58:42,908
<i>Christa continued</i>
<i>to spend time with Robby,</i>

822
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:44,969
<i>and I just got more and more jealous,</i>

823
00:58:45,047 --> 00:58:46,844
<i>more and more needy,</i>

824
00:58:46,915 --> 00:58:48,940
<i>and more and more insecure.</i>

825
00:58:49,017 --> 00:58:50,143
(arguing)

826
00:58:50,218 --> 00:58:53,210
<i>So we started going to couples therapy.</i>

827
00:58:53,288 --> 00:58:56,553
So, Caveh,
what are you thinking right now?

828
00:59:03,031 --> 00:59:06,000
I was thinking that I'm attracted to you.

829
00:59:10,339 --> 00:59:13,740
<i>Meanwhile, our fighting</i>
<i>started to escalate out of control.</i>

830
00:59:13,809 --> 00:59:15,367
(yelling)

831
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:21,775
<i>And before I knew it, my desire to have sex</i>
<i>with a prostitute had returned.</i>

832
00:59:28,090 --> 00:59:30,285
- How much?
- What do you want?

833
00:59:30,359 --> 00:59:33,522
- How much for a blow job?
- 50 bucks.

834
00:59:33,595 --> 00:59:35,256
Let me think about it.

835
00:59:42,904 --> 00:59:47,136
<i>After that night,</i>
<i>I started cruising regularly,</i>

836
00:59:47,209 --> 00:59:49,040
<i>sometimes until dawn.</i>

837
00:59:52,014 --> 00:59:53,481
And then I met Devin.

838
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,516
Austin, Texas

839
00:59:55,584 --> 00:59:57,017
Fuck.

840
00:59:57,085 --> 00:59:59,781
<i>I had been invited</i>
<i>by the Austin Film Society</i>

841
00:59:59,855 --> 01:00:02,255
<i>to show a film that</i>
<i>Greg and I had co-directed.</i>

842
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:05,526
<i>Devin was one of the organizers.</i>

843
01:00:05,594 --> 01:00:06,583
Hey.

844
01:00:07,863 --> 01:00:11,162
<i>That night we ended up</i>
<i>getting stoned together,</i>

845
01:00:11,233 --> 01:00:14,259
<i>and I found myself suddenly</i>
<i>feeling very attracted to her.</i>

846
01:00:16,505 --> 01:00:17,665
(coughs)

847
01:00:21,343 --> 01:00:25,803
<i>And then on my last day in Austin,</i>
<i>we decided to take mushrooms together.</i>

848
01:00:47,736 --> 01:00:51,638
<i>Tripping with Devin was one of the most</i>
<i>mystical experiences of my life.</i>

849
01:00:54,276 --> 01:00:56,676
<i>I felt like we</i>
<i>understood each other in a way</i>

850
01:00:56,745 --> 01:00:58,872
<i>that I had never thought possible</i>
<i>between two people.</i>

851
01:01:14,296 --> 01:01:18,960
<i>After we came down, I told her the whole</i>
<i>story of my relationship with Christa.</i>

852
01:01:19,034 --> 01:01:21,901
You know, I bet she's
probably fucking Robby right now.

853
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:24,734
- Caveh, you're crazy.
- Why am I crazy?

854
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:28,867
Because you should be happy for her.
You should hope she's having a good fuck.

855
01:01:29,711 --> 01:01:32,441
You know, you're right. I should.

856
01:01:32,514 --> 01:01:34,880
You know, I don't even
believe in monogamy.

857
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:37,748
Fuck, man, neither do I.

858
01:01:39,554 --> 01:01:42,079
<i>It seemed to me that I had</i>
<i>finally found the soul mate</i>

859
01:01:42,157 --> 01:01:44,421
<i>that I had been searching for all my life.</i>

860
01:01:44,493 --> 01:01:46,586
Ow! What are you doing?

861
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:49,391
You see, there's this person here,
his name is Caveh.

862
01:01:49,464 --> 01:01:51,932
He's real. He exists.

863
01:01:52,868 --> 01:01:55,769
- You mean me?
- Yeah, I mean you.

864
01:01:55,837 --> 01:02:00,968
Look, as noble as it is to try to sacrifice
yourself and your needs for her,

865
01:02:01,042 --> 01:02:04,341
you have to be true to yourself
because you're real, too.

866
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,906
But the problem is I can't stand to hurt her.

867
01:02:08,483 --> 01:02:12,249
You're hurting her more by prolonging
a relationship that isn't working

868
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,447
than by ending it right now.

869
01:02:14,523 --> 01:02:17,356
Yeah, but I'm also scared.

870
01:02:17,425 --> 01:02:21,885
I'm afraid of being lonely and horny

871
01:02:21,963 --> 01:02:25,729
and desperate and always on the prowl.

872
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,062
I hate that.

873
01:02:27,636 --> 01:02:30,935
Those don't sound like very good
reasons for staying together.

874
01:02:31,006 --> 01:02:33,236
You're right.

875
01:02:34,442 --> 01:02:35,739
(sighs)

876
01:02:36,978 --> 01:02:39,003
I agreed with everything she said,

877
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:42,277
but I wondered whether Devin would
be able to accept my prostitute fetish

878
01:02:42,350 --> 01:02:44,147
any better than Christa.

879
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:48,812
But Christa's really been trying.
I mean, I'm fucked up, too.

880
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:54,055
Like, for example,
I have this prostitute fetish.

881
01:02:54,129 --> 01:02:58,930
Big fucking deal.
Everybody's got stuff like that.

882
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,968
<i>When Devin said those words,</i>

883
01:03:01,036 --> 01:03:06,099
<i>it suddenly struck me that it wasn't</i>
<i>my prostitute fetish that was the problem.</i>

884
01:03:06,174 --> 01:03:08,335
<i>It was Christa that was the problem.</i>

885
01:03:22,891 --> 01:03:24,654
<i>On the way back to L.A.,</i>

886
01:03:24,726 --> 01:03:27,661
<i>I made up my mind</i>
<i>to break up with Christa.</i>

887
01:03:29,664 --> 01:03:32,690
<i>We had been together for 3 years.</i>

888
01:03:33,902 --> 01:03:36,268
<i>This is the real Christa.</i>

889
01:03:36,338 --> 01:03:40,274
<i>For the first few years after our break-up</i>
<i>we weren't on the best of terms.</i>

890
01:03:41,076 --> 01:03:43,670
<i>But now things are better between us.</i>

891
01:03:43,745 --> 01:03:47,146
<i>She's since gotten married</i>
<i>and recently had a baby.</i>

892
01:03:55,023 --> 01:03:58,322
<i>After the break-up,</i>
<i>I couldn't stop thinking about Devin.</i>

893
01:04:00,295 --> 01:04:03,264
<i>For the next month,</i>
<i>I wrote to her every day.</i>

894
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,492
<i>And when I received an invitation</i>
<i>from two European film festivals,</i>

895
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:10,697
<i>I invited Devin to come along.</i>

896
01:04:13,775 --> 01:04:15,868
(moaning)

897
01:04:15,944 --> 01:04:19,141
<i>Our first few days together were idyllic.</i>

898
01:04:21,883 --> 01:04:24,215
<i>But then things got more complicated.</i>

899
01:04:32,627 --> 01:04:34,254
I think she likes you.

900
01:04:34,329 --> 01:04:36,923
- CAVEH: You think?
- DEVIN: Definitely.

901
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:40,559
I don't know. She's not really my type.
Not slutty enough.

902
01:04:40,635 --> 01:04:42,034
Yeah, right.

903
01:04:48,209 --> 01:04:53,306
You know, if you want to see prostitutes
while we're in Europe, feel free.

904
01:04:53,381 --> 01:04:56,248
You can just go,
"Hey, Devin, catch you later,"

905
01:04:56,318 --> 01:04:58,377
and go and do your thing.

906
01:05:00,622 --> 01:05:03,250
You know, I was thinking
about what you said earlier,

907
01:05:03,325 --> 01:05:09,286
and I just wanted to say that I really do
want to get over my prostitute fetish.

908
01:05:09,364 --> 01:05:10,888
You know, I do.

909
01:05:10,965 --> 01:05:13,331
But it did occur to me

910
01:05:13,401 --> 01:05:16,734
that maybe if I could get you to watch
while I had sex with one,

911
01:05:16,805 --> 01:05:18,636
that might be really healing for me.

912
01:05:27,248 --> 01:05:30,877
Caveh, that would be so intense for me.

913
01:05:30,952 --> 01:05:32,249
Really?

914
01:05:33,588 --> 01:05:36,113
Yeah, it would

915
01:05:36,191 --> 01:05:40,287
It's just that like a lot of it
has to do with shame,

916
01:05:40,362 --> 01:05:43,627
and I think that if you were watching,

917
01:05:43,698 --> 01:05:46,496
then it would be something
that we were doing together.

918
01:05:46,568 --> 01:05:51,562
And then I think that might help me
to not feel so much shame about it,

919
01:05:51,639 --> 01:05:56,770
and then hopefully like I wouldn't feel
the need to do it as much.

920
01:05:56,845 --> 01:05:58,972
The next day we rented a car

921
01:05:59,047 --> 01:06:02,414
and drove to Milan to see
Leonardo da Vinci's <i>The Last Supper.</i>

922
01:06:04,486 --> 01:06:05,783
Hey, a prostitute!

923
01:06:07,589 --> 01:06:09,784
Do you want to stop
and check her out?

924
01:06:09,858 --> 01:06:11,689
I don't know.

925
01:06:14,462 --> 01:06:16,430
Well, if you don't mind.

926
01:06:16,498 --> 01:06:18,693
Nah, go for it.

927
01:06:44,726 --> 01:06:46,694
So what do you think?

928
01:06:46,761 --> 01:06:48,353
Do you wanna watch?

929
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:52,421
If it's really important to you, I will.

930
01:06:53,768 --> 01:06:55,531
Thanks, Devin.

931
01:06:55,603 --> 01:06:57,400
I really appreciate it.

932
01:07:11,719 --> 01:07:13,778
She doesn't want you to watch.

933
01:07:13,855 --> 01:07:15,880
So what do you want to do?

934
01:07:17,725 --> 01:07:19,056
I don't know.

935
01:07:23,064 --> 01:07:24,531
Let's just go.

936
01:07:24,599 --> 01:07:25,793
Okay.

937
01:07:46,054 --> 01:07:49,717
<i>On our last day in Italy,</i>
<i>I saw the girl from the boardwalk again.</i>

938
01:07:58,366 --> 01:08:02,735
<i>Her name was Paola, and it turned out</i>
<i>that she was an aspiring actress.</i>

939
01:08:03,738 --> 01:08:07,139
<i>She had seen my movie and liked it.</i>

940
01:08:11,312 --> 01:08:12,438
DEVIN: Hey.

941
01:08:12,614 --> 01:08:14,514
Hey.

942
01:08:14,582 --> 01:08:17,710
- How'd it go?
- Great. She gave me her shoes.

943
01:08:17,785 --> 01:08:18,945
No way. Cool.

944
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:20,988
Yeah, she saw my movie. We kissed.

945
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:23,319
You kissed? Lucky you.

946
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:25,791
It was an okay kiss.
Not like yours.

947
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:27,225
Ohh.

948
01:08:28,129 --> 01:08:30,825
Mm. Did you even notice
how I kept on riding

949
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:32,890
when you decided to go
and check her out?

950
01:08:32,967 --> 01:08:34,434
No, I guess I didn't.

951
01:08:34,502 --> 01:08:36,470
Yeah. I just wanted to point it out

952
01:08:36,538 --> 01:08:38,529
'cause I don't think most girlfriends
would have done that,

953
01:08:38,606 --> 01:08:40,767
just take off and let you do your thing.

954
01:08:40,842 --> 01:08:42,935
Yeah, I guess you're right.

955
01:08:43,011 --> 01:08:47,710
I'd just like a little appreciation,
'cause most girlfriends wouldn't stand for it,

956
01:08:47,782 --> 01:08:49,773
let alone make it easier for you.

957
01:08:49,851 --> 01:08:51,341
Yeah, that's true.
Thanks, Devin.

958
01:08:51,419 --> 01:08:54,217
- Yeah, right.
- No, I really appreciate it.

959
01:08:54,289 --> 01:08:55,916
Yeah.

960
01:08:55,990 --> 01:08:58,220
- But just do me one favor, okay?
- What?

961
01:08:58,293 --> 01:08:59,692
- Just one.
- Okay.

962
01:08:59,761 --> 01:09:02,321
Just don't fuck her in our bed, okay?

963
01:09:03,932 --> 01:09:05,024
Okay.

964
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,330
<i>I was surprised that she would care,</i>

965
01:09:08,403 --> 01:09:11,668
<i>but I chose to be touched</i>
<i>rather than alarmed.</i>

966
01:09:14,309 --> 01:09:17,972
<i>Paola had invited me to have a drink</i>
<i>with her and her friends that night.</i>

967
01:09:19,013 --> 01:09:21,481
<i>I had asked Devin</i>
<i>if she wanted to come along,</i>

968
01:09:21,549 --> 01:09:23,813
<i>secretly hoping she would decline.</i>

969
01:09:25,019 --> 01:09:26,748
<i>But she didn't decline.</i>

970
01:09:28,022 --> 01:09:30,422
<i>I couldn't decide where to sit,</i>

971
01:09:30,491 --> 01:09:34,951
<i>I wanted to sit next to Paola,</i>
<i>but I felt I should sit next to Devin.</i>

972
01:09:36,497 --> 01:09:39,295
<i>I decided to compromise</i>
<i>by sitting next to neither,</i>

973
01:09:39,367 --> 01:09:41,767
<i>thereby remaining equidistant from both,</i>

974
01:09:41,836 --> 01:09:44,999
<i>like Christ in da Vinci's</i>
The Last Supper.

975
01:09:57,819 --> 01:10:00,982
I'm going to head back to the hotel.
I'll see you later.

976
01:10:01,055 --> 01:10:02,818
Don't you want to go swimming?

977
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:06,417
No. Why don't you go
with your Italian friend?

978
01:10:07,428 --> 01:10:09,919
I'd rather go with you.

979
01:10:09,998 --> 01:10:13,161
Nah, go with her.
See ya.

980
01:10:30,451 --> 01:10:32,146
Are you sure
you don't want to swim naked?

981
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:33,915
Yes, I'm sure.

982
01:10:34,656 --> 01:10:36,248
No, it'll be fun.

983
01:10:36,324 --> 01:10:38,451
- No.
- Really.

984
01:10:45,133 --> 01:10:46,862
Are you sure you don't want
to sleep together?

985
01:10:46,934 --> 01:10:50,461
Yes, I'm sure.
But maybe when you come to Torino.

986
01:10:50,538 --> 01:10:52,165
Great, I'll probably be old by then.

987
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:54,071
I'll write to you.

988
01:10:54,142 --> 01:10:55,268
(sighs)

989
01:10:55,343 --> 01:10:56,970
Okay.

990
01:10:57,045 --> 01:11:01,311
And if ever you need someone
to act in one of your movies,

991
01:11:01,382 --> 01:11:03,009
just give me a call.

992
01:11:03,084 --> 01:11:05,416
<i>That was the line</i>
<i>that made me hate myself.</i>

993
01:11:05,486 --> 01:11:06,783
Okay.

994
01:11:06,854 --> 01:11:09,755
<i>I felt like a sleazy</i>
<i>Hollywood film director.</i>

995
01:11:15,163 --> 01:11:19,657
<i>On the way home, I had</i>
<i>a nightmarish vision of my future.</i>

996
01:11:19,734 --> 01:11:24,671
<i>I saw myself 20 years later,</i>
<i>aging and still alone.</i>

997
01:11:27,508 --> 01:11:32,343
<i>By the time I got back to the hotel,</i>
<i>I was feeling empty and depressed.</i>

998
01:11:33,481 --> 01:11:38,009
<i>All I wanted was to get into bed</i>
<i>and snuggle up next to Devin.</i>

999
01:11:49,664 --> 01:11:51,063
Devin!

1000
01:11:54,302 --> 01:11:56,031
Devin!

1001
01:12:07,515 --> 01:12:10,348
- So did you fuck her?
- No, I didn't.

1002
01:12:10,418 --> 01:12:12,648
Why not? She wanted you.

1003
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:14,654
Not enough, apparently.

1004
01:12:15,690 --> 01:12:18,352
Well, I almost fucked somebody.

1005
01:12:18,426 --> 01:12:20,257
Who?

1006
01:12:20,328 --> 01:12:22,455
Some dude that I met in a bar.

1007
01:12:22,530 --> 01:12:24,395
Here.

1008
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:25,796
Sorry.

1009
01:12:27,235 --> 01:12:29,362
<i>I felt jealous and insecure,</i>

1010
01:12:29,437 --> 01:12:31,871
<i>but I wanted to believe</i>
<i>that Devin and I were engaged</i>

1011
01:12:31,939 --> 01:12:35,136
<i>in a high-minded experiment</i>
<i>in self-transcendence.</i>

1012
01:12:37,745 --> 01:12:40,509
<i>The next day we flew to Munich.</i>

1013
01:12:40,581 --> 01:12:42,572
(groaning)

1014
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:45,244
Fuck, I've got such a fucking hangover.

1015
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:50,017
Excuse me, miss,
can I have a scotch, please?

1016
01:12:50,091 --> 01:12:51,854
- STEWARDESS: One scotch?
- Yeah.

1017
01:12:54,262 --> 01:12:58,255
- I thought you had a hangover.
- I do. That's why I need a drink.

1018
01:12:58,966 --> 01:13:00,558
Is that a good idea?

1019
01:13:00,635 --> 01:13:03,365
It's the only way.

1020
01:13:05,206 --> 01:13:08,039
It's true.
I know what I'm doing.

1021
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:11,205
Okay.

1022
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:15,515
But this is my last drink.
I promise.

1023
01:13:23,724 --> 01:13:25,191
You promised you weren't
going to drink anymore.

1024
01:13:25,259 --> 01:13:29,252
Well, the guy kept buying me beers.
I couldn't really turn him down.

1025
01:13:29,330 --> 01:13:32,265
- Why not?
- Free beers, man.

1026
01:13:32,333 --> 01:13:36,770
<i>It was starting to dawn on me</i>
<i>that Devin had a drinking problem.</i>

1027
01:13:36,838 --> 01:13:38,328
Now, I should probably explain

1028
01:13:38,406 --> 01:13:42,502
that the actress playing Devin
had a drinking problem in real life.

1029
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:51,309
(humming)

1030
01:13:53,888 --> 01:13:54,877
(laughs)

1031
01:13:54,956 --> 01:13:57,720
The cause of and answer to
all of life's problems.

1032
01:13:57,792 --> 01:14:00,022
<i>But getting back to the story...</i>

1033
01:14:00,094 --> 01:14:02,062
(TV playing)

1034
01:14:02,129 --> 01:14:04,996
Devin, stop it. You said that was
going to be your last one.

1035
01:14:05,933 --> 01:14:09,164
Why don't you go fuck a prostitute
and leave me alone?

1036
01:14:10,304 --> 01:14:14,741
Devin, what are you talking about?
You said you were going to stop drinking!

1037
01:14:15,476 --> 01:14:17,341
I guess I changed my mind.

1038
01:14:18,679 --> 01:14:21,443
Devin, I think you've had enough.

1039
01:14:22,350 --> 01:14:25,012
Well, that's funny, Caveh,
because I don't think I have.

1040
01:14:30,291 --> 01:14:31,781
Fuck!

1041
01:14:31,859 --> 01:14:34,419
You fucking prick!
That shit's expensive!

1042
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:44,294
<i>I was starting to miss Christa.</i>

1043
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:52,037
<i>That night, I spoke</i>
<i>to every prostitute in Munich.</i>

1044
01:14:52,113 --> 01:14:53,102
Um...

1045
01:14:56,651 --> 01:14:57,845
<i>Blasen?</i>

1046
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:00,854
<i>- Blasen?</i>
<i>- Blasen. Ja. Blasen.</i>

1047
01:15:06,193 --> 01:15:10,653
<i>After conversing with the street prostitutes,</i>
<i>I made the rounds of the brothels.</i>

1048
01:15:33,821 --> 01:15:37,348
<i>There was one prostitute</i>
<i>I found especially tempting.</i>

1049
01:15:45,132 --> 01:15:47,600
<i>I was dying to have sex with her,</i>

1050
01:15:47,668 --> 01:15:50,034
<i>but I managed to resist.</i>

1051
01:15:51,372 --> 01:15:53,306
<i>And I returned to the hotel</i>

1052
01:15:53,374 --> 01:15:57,504
<i>excited to tell Devin</i>
<i>that I had successfully resisted.</i>

1053
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:05,751
<i>The next day the film festival organizers</i>

1054
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:09,756
<i>insisted that we pay a $300 fine</i>
<i>for damages to the room</i>

1055
01:16:09,824 --> 01:16:12,691
<i>and that we leave town</i>
<i>immediately after my screening.</i>

1056
01:16:15,896 --> 01:16:21,835
I am not having another drink
for a long time, I can tell you that.

1057
01:16:24,105 --> 01:16:25,595
Well, good. I'm glad.

1058
01:16:30,678 --> 01:16:34,114
<i>Devin had a bad hangover</i>
<i>and slept all afternoon.</i>

1059
01:16:35,249 --> 01:16:39,049
<i>It was our last day in Munich,</i>
<i>so I decided to go sightseeing.</i>

1060
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:41,213
(music playing)

1061
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:53,590
Cheers.

1062
01:16:54,869 --> 01:16:56,734
Fuck you, Devin.

1063
01:17:06,881 --> 01:17:08,849
Where are you going?

1064
01:17:09,517 --> 01:17:11,382
I'm gonna get a blow job.

1065
01:17:11,452 --> 01:17:13,943
Okay, I'll come with you.

1066
01:17:15,823 --> 01:17:17,381
I don't want you to.

1067
01:17:17,458 --> 01:17:20,086
Why not? I thought
you wanted me to watch.

1068
01:17:20,161 --> 01:17:24,188
Didn't you say you wanted your girlfriends
to watch so you could feel "accepted"?

1069
01:17:24,265 --> 01:17:26,460
Well, I'm mad at you right now.

1070
01:17:26,534 --> 01:17:29,992
Well, hey, pal, it's your big chance.

1071
01:18:06,907 --> 01:18:09,341
- Do you speak English?
- Yes.

1072
01:18:10,010 --> 01:18:10,999
Um, hi.

1073
01:18:11,078 --> 01:18:13,638
Um, I'm looking for a woman
who was here last night.

1074
01:18:13,714 --> 01:18:15,477
She had black hair.
Is she here?

1075
01:18:15,549 --> 01:18:20,248
She's going to be busy for another hour.
Maybe I can help you.

1076
01:18:20,321 --> 01:18:21,948
Um...

1077
01:18:22,022 --> 01:18:23,990
I was really hoping to see her.

1078
01:18:24,058 --> 01:18:25,491
I am very good.

1079
01:18:25,559 --> 01:18:29,859
I'm sure that's true,
but I need to think about it.

1080
01:18:29,930 --> 01:18:31,227
Okay.

1081
01:18:35,369 --> 01:18:37,667
I don't see the one I came for.

1082
01:18:37,738 --> 01:18:41,265
So why don't you get your dick sucked
by one of these?

1083
01:18:42,276 --> 01:18:44,972
Because I liked the other one better.

1084
01:18:45,045 --> 01:18:47,104
- Well, if she's not here...
- She is here.

1085
01:18:47,181 --> 01:18:50,378
She says she's with a customer.
She'll be done in an hour.

1086
01:18:50,451 --> 01:18:54,387
An hour?
We're going to wait an hour?

1087
01:18:56,891 --> 01:18:59,291
I need another drink.

1088
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:02,887
Devin, we can't afford another drink.

1089
01:19:02,963 --> 01:19:05,431
What do you mean
we can't afford another drink?

1090
01:19:05,499 --> 01:19:08,991
You bring your girlfriend to a brothel
and you won't even buy her a drink?

1091
01:19:09,069 --> 01:19:12,402
Devin, we only have 200 marks left.
It's just enough for me to get a blow job.

1092
01:19:12,473 --> 01:19:14,464
It's not enough for a drink and a blow job.

1093
01:19:14,542 --> 01:19:17,033
Man, fuck you, Caveh.
I want a drink.

1094
01:19:17,111 --> 01:19:19,545
Devin, you haven't even finished
what's in your glass.

1095
01:19:23,083 --> 01:19:24,675
There, it's finished.

1096
01:19:35,029 --> 01:19:36,189
Here.

1097
01:19:37,331 --> 01:19:38,923
Thank you.

1098
01:19:38,999 --> 01:19:42,992
Excuse me. The woman
you wanted is available now.

1099
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:44,401
Follow me.

1100
01:19:52,746 --> 01:19:56,910
I'm sorry, I was looking
for a different woman with black hair.

1101
01:19:56,984 --> 01:20:00,715
- She was here last night.
- She's not here tonight.

1102
01:20:04,725 --> 01:20:07,694
- That wasn't her.
- What do you mean?

1103
01:20:07,761 --> 01:20:09,661
The one I wanted isn't here tonight.

1104
01:20:09,730 --> 01:20:12,722
We waited a fucking hour
and she's not here?

1105
01:20:14,235 --> 01:20:15,463
Yeah.

1106
01:20:16,637 --> 01:20:19,071
So what do you want to do?
Do you want to go?

1107
01:20:21,542 --> 01:20:23,169
I'm not sure.

1108
01:20:24,044 --> 01:20:25,534
I can't decide.

1109
01:20:26,313 --> 01:20:28,713
Well, why don't you
fuck one of those?

1110
01:20:29,583 --> 01:20:31,813
I don't know.
I really wanted that one.

1111
01:20:31,885 --> 01:20:34,683
You know, I'm not that attracted
to any of the other ones.

1112
01:20:35,356 --> 01:20:38,655
We came all the way here.
You might as well do it.

1113
01:20:44,265 --> 01:20:47,359
So, you want to go upstairs with me?

1114
01:20:47,434 --> 01:20:50,528
Um, maybe. I'm not sure.

1115
01:20:50,604 --> 01:20:53,266
I can give you very much pleasure.

1116
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:55,467
I'm sure that's true.

1117
01:21:00,214 --> 01:21:02,239
So, are you ready?

1118
01:21:02,316 --> 01:21:05,308
Um, I don't know.
I can't decide.

1119
01:21:05,386 --> 01:21:07,183
Maybe I can help you decide.

1120
01:21:07,254 --> 01:21:08,414
Um...

1121
01:21:08,489 --> 01:21:11,720
- What do you think?
- Well, it's certainly very tempting.

1122
01:21:14,028 --> 01:21:15,256
Where are you going?

1123
01:21:15,329 --> 01:21:18,457
Don't worry about her.
She'll be fine.

1124
01:21:18,532 --> 01:21:21,990
- Where are they going?
- She won't hurt her.

1125
01:21:23,003 --> 01:21:25,836
Um, I'm sorry.
I have to go.

1126
01:21:42,222 --> 01:21:45,020
Fuck you, Caveh!
Fuck you! Fuck you!

1127
01:21:45,092 --> 01:21:47,617
- Devin, calm down.
- Fuck you!

1128
01:21:47,695 --> 01:21:48,923
What did she say to you?

1129
01:21:48,996 --> 01:21:52,193
She was actually concerned
about me, unlike you!

1130
01:21:52,266 --> 01:21:54,996
She said, "Come with me,
and I'll take care of you

1131
01:21:55,069 --> 01:21:57,060
and I'll make you feel better."

1132
01:21:58,238 --> 01:21:59,967
Did she mean sexually?

1133
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:03,498
It's all you can think about, isn't it?

1134
01:22:03,577 --> 01:22:05,204
Well, is that what she meant?

1135
01:22:05,279 --> 01:22:06,837
I'm getting out!

1136
01:22:06,914 --> 01:22:09,678
Devin, no, wait!
Stop it! Close it!

1137
01:22:18,692 --> 01:22:23,493
<i>When we got back to the hotel,</i>
<i>Devin insisted on giving me a blow job.</i>

1138
01:22:23,564 --> 01:22:28,001
<i>I told her I didn't want one,</i>
<i>but she held me down and forced me.</i>

1139
01:22:29,203 --> 01:22:32,764
<i>I was scared the whole time that</i>
<i>she was going to bite my penis off.</i>

1140
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:34,865
(moaning)

1141
01:22:36,510 --> 01:22:39,411
<i>The next morning we flew to New York.</i>

1142
01:22:50,891 --> 01:22:52,085
How much?

1143
01:23:11,412 --> 01:23:13,505
Let me pull it out for you.

1144
01:23:15,682 --> 01:23:17,274
Get down on your knees.

1145
01:23:17,351 --> 01:23:20,377
I'm not getting down on my fucking knees.
There's broken glass.

1146
01:23:20,454 --> 01:23:22,115
Oh. Sorry.

1147
01:23:39,206 --> 01:23:42,903
<i>The next day</i>
<i>we went our separate ways.</i>

1148
01:23:44,645 --> 01:23:48,411
<i>I wanted to say "I love you,"</i>
<i>but I couldn't.</i>

1149
01:23:49,450 --> 01:23:54,752
<i>But as I headed towards the gate,</i>
<i>I felt able to say it and wanted to.</i>

1150
01:23:56,356 --> 01:23:58,290
<i>But it was too late.</i>

1151
01:24:01,862 --> 01:24:03,921
<i>This is the real Devin.</i>

1152
01:24:03,997 --> 01:24:06,522
<i>We remained friends over the years,</i>

1153
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:11,435
<i>and she later appeared in a film I made</i>
<i>called</i> I Don't Hate Las Vegas Anymore.

1154
01:24:11,505 --> 01:24:14,963
<i>By then she had already</i>
<i>been diagnosed with cancer</i>

1155
01:24:15,042 --> 01:24:18,842
<i>and had just undergone chemotherapy.</i>

1156
01:24:19,847 --> 01:24:22,042
<i>She died three years later.</i>

1157
01:24:31,558 --> 01:24:35,790
<i>On the way home,</i>
<i>I felt an overwhelming sense of loss.</i>

1158
01:24:36,930 --> 01:24:38,693
<i>Ever since I had met Devin,</i>

1159
01:24:38,765 --> 01:24:41,256
<i>I had believed that I had</i>
<i>finally found the one person</i>

1160
01:24:41,335 --> 01:24:43,269
<i>who could accept me the way I was.</i>

1161
01:24:45,806 --> 01:24:49,207
<i>But now I realized that I had been wrong.</i>

1162
01:24:51,245 --> 01:24:55,579
<i>I had once read somewhere that</i>
<i>everyone who comes into our lives</i>

1163
01:24:55,649 --> 01:24:59,517
<i>is a mirror for something inside us</i>
<i>that we're not seeing.</i>

1164
01:24:59,586 --> 01:25:01,383
<i>So I asked myself</i>

1165
01:25:01,455 --> 01:25:06,358
<i>how Devin might be a mirror for something</i>
<i>inside me that I wasn't seeing.</i>

1166
01:25:06,894 --> 01:25:09,624
<i>At first I couldn't see it.</i>

1167
01:25:09,696 --> 01:25:13,826
<i>Devin was an alcoholic,</i>
<i>I wasn't an alcoholic.</i>

1168
01:25:14,735 --> 01:25:19,104
<i>But then it suddenly occurred to me</i>
<i>that even though I wasn't an alcoholic,</i>

1169
01:25:19,172 --> 01:25:23,131
<i>I was kind of like an alcoholic about sex.</i>

1170
01:25:31,151 --> 01:25:32,675
- Caveh?
- Yeah, hi.

1171
01:25:32,753 --> 01:25:34,118
Hi.

1172
01:25:34,187 --> 01:25:37,418
<i>Back in L.A. I went to see a therapist</i>

1173
01:25:37,491 --> 01:25:40,983
<i>who suggested I attend</i>
<i>a Sex Addicts Anonymous meeting.</i>

1174
01:26:21,501 --> 01:26:26,097
<i>I scanned the faces of the other men</i>
<i>in the room for signs of perversion,</i>

1175
01:26:26,173 --> 01:26:28,266
<i>but they looked just like anybody else.</i>

1176
01:26:32,045 --> 01:26:34,240
Good evening, my name is Ken.

1177
01:26:34,314 --> 01:26:36,544
I'm a recovering sex addict.

1178
01:26:36,617 --> 01:26:38,278
ALL: Hi, Ken.

1179
01:26:38,352 --> 01:26:43,119
Welcome to the Monday night male-only
meeting of Sex Addicts Anonymous.

1180
01:26:43,190 --> 01:26:45,158
This is a closed meeting.

1181
01:26:45,225 --> 01:26:48,888
Only those desiring
their own sexual abstinence, please.

1182
01:26:48,962 --> 01:26:50,793
In S.A.A., we define abstinence

1183
01:26:50,864 --> 01:26:54,322
not as the complete elimination
of all sexuality from the addict's life,

1184
01:26:54,401 --> 01:26:57,268
but only of those
compulsive sexual behaviors

1185
01:26:57,337 --> 01:27:01,103
that lead to pitiful
and incomprehensible demoralization.

1186
01:27:01,174 --> 01:27:02,732
We leave it up to the individual to decide

1187
01:27:02,809 --> 01:27:05,869
which compulsive behaviors
he wishes to abstain from.

1188
01:27:05,946 --> 01:27:07,743
I said that I'm a sex addict.

1189
01:27:07,814 --> 01:27:10,544
Are there any other sex addicts present?

1190
01:27:14,454 --> 01:27:17,446
Hi, everybody. My name's Sasha
and I'm a sex addict.

1191
01:27:17,524 --> 01:27:18,786
ALL: Hi, Sasha.

1192
01:27:18,859 --> 01:27:22,795
Last week I finally took all my porn
and I just put it in a garbage bag

1193
01:27:22,863 --> 01:27:26,458
and I just hauled it out
'cause I was just so sick of it.

1194
01:27:26,533 --> 01:27:29,127
And I think of all the hundreds
and thousands of hours

1195
01:27:29,202 --> 01:27:32,729
I'm wasting in my car cruising...

1196
01:27:32,806 --> 01:27:34,364
...staying in sex clubs all night

1197
01:27:34,441 --> 01:27:37,842
when there's absolutely nobody
that I want to have sex with at all.

1198
01:27:37,911 --> 01:27:42,644
And it really started to affect
my work, my marriage...

1199
01:27:42,716 --> 01:27:44,445
<i>Everyone had a different addiction.</i>

1200
01:27:44,518 --> 01:27:47,282
<i>Ken was into gay bath houses.</i>

1201
01:27:47,354 --> 01:27:50,721
<i>Ron was a compulsive masturbator.</i>

1202
01:27:50,791 --> 01:27:53,658
<i>And Tom was a voyeur.</i>

1203
01:27:53,727 --> 01:27:56,355
<i>But their stories</i>
<i>all had one thing in common...</i>

1204
01:27:56,430 --> 01:27:59,160
<i>that the more they had</i>
<i>indulged their addictions,</i>

1205
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:01,928
<i>the stronger their addictions had become.</i>

1206
01:28:02,002 --> 01:28:05,130
I'm in my hallway and I'm bleeding,

1207
01:28:05,205 --> 01:28:09,301
and I just realized that that's it,
I'm at fucking rock bottom.

1208
01:28:09,376 --> 01:28:14,780
And I really need some support tonight,
'cause it's been a really hard week.

1209
01:28:15,348 --> 01:28:18,545
(clapping)

1210
01:28:20,053 --> 01:28:23,750
It's 9:15. This is the time
we usually set aside for newcomers.

1211
01:28:23,824 --> 01:28:26,691
Would any of the newcomers like to share?

1212
01:28:31,264 --> 01:28:32,629
Yes.

1213
01:28:42,042 --> 01:28:45,978
<i>As you can see, I'm not</i>
<i>very good at crying on camera.</i>

1214
01:28:46,046 --> 01:28:48,742
But I did actually break down and cry

1215
01:28:48,815 --> 01:28:51,579
at that first Sex Addicts Anonymous
meeting that I went to,

1216
01:28:51,651 --> 01:28:54,848
and I actually happened
to tape record the meeting.

1217
01:28:54,921 --> 01:28:59,381
And this is actually the tape
that I made at that first meeting.

1218
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:03,329
This was in 1991.

1219
01:29:03,396 --> 01:29:05,694
And I'm just going to play it for you

1220
01:29:05,766 --> 01:29:09,668
so you can hear what it sounded like.

1221
01:29:11,471 --> 01:29:14,634
CAVEH: <i>I feel really moved</i>
<i>by what everybody is saying.</i>

1222
01:29:14,708 --> 01:29:16,767
- MAN: <i>What's your name?</i>
<i>- My name's Robert.</i>

1223
01:29:16,843 --> 01:29:19,209
ALL: <i>Hi, Robert.</i>

1224
01:29:19,279 --> 01:29:21,213
I didn't use my real name.

1225
01:29:22,849 --> 01:29:23,838
<i>(blows nose)</i>

1226
01:29:23,917 --> 01:29:25,111
I'm blowing my nose.

1227
01:29:25,185 --> 01:29:27,050
<i>I used to be married and...</i>

1228
01:29:31,558 --> 01:29:33,082
<i>It's hard to talk.</i>

1229
01:29:36,196 --> 01:29:38,824
<i>I started seeing prostitutes and...</i>

1230
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:42,632
<i>... it destroyed my marriage and...</i>

1231
01:29:45,038 --> 01:29:46,505
<i>Then I got...</i>

1232
01:29:48,341 --> 01:29:50,605
<i>... involved with somebody else and...</i>

1233
01:29:52,379 --> 01:29:54,609
<i>... that just ended recently...</i>

1234
01:29:54,681 --> 01:29:56,080
<i>(crying)</i>

1235
01:29:56,149 --> 01:29:57,776
<i>... for the same reason.</i>

1236
01:29:58,585 --> 01:30:00,951
Ooh, I hit the record button.

1237
01:30:02,088 --> 01:30:03,885
Anyway, that was, uh...

1238
01:30:04,791 --> 01:30:07,521
That was that.
I mean, there's more, but...

1239
01:30:08,595 --> 01:30:10,062
Let's go back to the movie.

1240
01:30:10,130 --> 01:30:13,395
<i>I started going to meetings</i>
<i>regularly after that</i>

1241
01:30:13,466 --> 01:30:17,527
<i>and was eventually able to stop</i>
<i>having sex with prostitutes long enough</i>

1242
01:30:17,604 --> 01:30:19,037
<i>to get married again.</i>

1243
01:30:21,141 --> 01:30:24,269
<i>Unfortunately, that marriage</i>
<i>didn't work out so well.</i>

1244
01:30:25,245 --> 01:30:28,373
<i>Two years later, as our marriage</i>
<i>was falling apart,</i>

1245
01:30:28,448 --> 01:30:33,078
<i>I had sex with a prostitute</i>
<i>and told my wife.</i>

1246
01:30:33,153 --> 01:30:35,383
<i>She filed for divorce soon after.</i>

1247
01:30:37,023 --> 01:30:39,423
Hi, my name's Caveh.
I'm a sex addict.

1248
01:30:39,492 --> 01:30:41,016
ALL: Hi, Caveh.

1249
01:30:41,094 --> 01:30:42,721
<i>It wasn't easy,</i>

1250
01:30:42,796 --> 01:30:46,391
<i>but after several more years of going</i>
<i>to meetings at least once a week,</i>

1251
01:30:46,466 --> 01:30:50,061
<i>I was eventually able to stop having sex</i>
<i>with prostitutes altogether.</i>

1252
01:30:50,136 --> 01:30:54,004
It's hard to explain
how I was eventually able to stop.

1253
01:30:54,074 --> 01:30:56,634
It wasn't just one thing.

1254
01:30:56,710 --> 01:31:02,012
But the way I think about it is in terms
of the story of Orpheus and the Sirens.

1255
01:31:05,051 --> 01:31:07,679
<i>The Sirens were these mythical creatures</i>

1256
01:31:07,754 --> 01:31:09,949
<i>whose singing was so seductive</i>

1257
01:31:10,023 --> 01:31:13,390
<i>that anyone hearing them</i>
<i>would go insane with desire.</i>

1258
01:31:15,562 --> 01:31:19,225
<i>Sailors would fling themselves</i>
<i>overboard to try to reach them,</i>

1259
01:31:19,299 --> 01:31:21,995
<i>only to die upon the rocks below.</i>

1260
01:31:23,536 --> 01:31:27,495
<i>But when Jason and the Argonauts</i>
<i>had to sail past the Sirens,</i>

1261
01:31:27,574 --> 01:31:31,010
<i>Orpheus, the greatest singer</i>
<i>in ancient Greece,</i>

1262
01:31:31,077 --> 01:31:33,011
<i>came up with an ingenious idea.</i>

1263
01:31:33,079 --> 01:31:34,410
(ting)

1264
01:31:35,582 --> 01:31:37,709
<i>He simply started singing.</i>

1265
01:31:38,852 --> 01:31:41,377
<i>And because his song was so beautiful,</i>

1266
01:31:41,454 --> 01:31:44,617
<i>the oarsmen had ears only for his song</i>

1267
01:31:44,691 --> 01:31:46,784
<i>and didn't even hear the Sirens.</i>

1268
01:31:48,595 --> 01:31:50,722
<i>And I feel like</i>
<i>that's what happened to me.</i>

1269
01:31:52,098 --> 01:31:54,328
<i>I heard a more beautiful song.</i>

1270
01:32:06,379 --> 01:32:09,371
- And then I met Mandy.
- Hi.

1271
01:32:09,449 --> 01:32:12,350
<i>- This is Mandy.</i>
- We just went swimming.

1272
01:32:12,419 --> 01:32:16,480
<i>We met in a dance class</i>
<i>and fell in love soon afterwards.</i>

1273
01:32:18,925 --> 01:32:21,758
<i>We've been together for seven years now,</i>

1274
01:32:21,828 --> 01:32:24,797
<i>which is by far the longest</i>
<i>I've ever been with anyone.</i>

1275
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:28,998
- CAVEH: I love you, sweetie.
- I love you, too.

1276
01:32:29,069 --> 01:32:30,969
<i>Now, I'm not saying we never fight.</i>

1277
01:32:31,037 --> 01:32:34,029
Mandy, I was willing to talk about it.
You weren't.

1278
01:32:34,107 --> 01:32:36,098
<i>We fight a lot.</i>

1279
01:32:36,176 --> 01:32:39,009
Now he's in here and he's filming me.

1280
01:32:39,079 --> 01:32:42,515
<i>But fighting no longer makes me</i>
<i>want to go have sex with a prostitute</i>

1281
01:32:42,582 --> 01:32:44,709
<i>or look for a new girlfriend.</i>

1282
01:32:44,784 --> 01:32:49,551
<i>Instead, I just hang in there</i>
<i>and really try to work it out.</i>

1283
01:32:50,290 --> 01:32:52,019
(exhales)

1284
01:32:52,092 --> 01:32:55,084
I could go on and on
about how great she is,

1285
01:32:55,161 --> 01:32:57,152
but the wedding's about to begin.

1286
01:32:57,230 --> 01:32:59,130
Greg, let's do the boutonniere.

1287
01:33:26,593 --> 01:33:28,686
Are you ready?
Here we go.
