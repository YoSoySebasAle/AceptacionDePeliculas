1
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,736
- Would you autograph
this for me, please?

2
00:01:55,736 --> 00:01:57,393
- Well, of course,
with pleasure.

3
00:01:57,393 --> 00:01:58,635
I think
it's one of your best.

4
00:01:58,635 --> 00:02:00,637
Except, of course,
Murder On A Honeymoon.

5
00:02:00,637 --> 00:02:04,054
- Well, I'm always at my best
on a honeymoon, you know.

6
00:02:04,054 --> 00:02:05,608
Now, then what shall we say?

7
00:02:05,608 --> 00:02:09,232
To the charming hostess who
made my trip so pleasant

8
00:02:09,232 --> 00:02:11,269
and never let me down.

9
00:02:11,269 --> 00:02:12,442
How is that, huh?

10
00:02:12,442 --> 00:02:14,513
This aircraft
is about to land.

11
00:02:14,513 --> 00:02:17,551
Will all passengers kindly
button their safety belts?

12
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:20,140
- That's what's called
letting you down with a bump.

13
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:23,488
- Archie, come here.

14
00:02:23,488 --> 00:02:25,145
I know you're
excited and so am I,

15
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,767
but there's no need to show him.

16
00:02:44,233 --> 00:02:46,752
- Hey, what are you
doing there I'm driving?

17
00:02:46,752 --> 00:02:49,065
- But you don't know
where we're going?

18
00:02:49,065 --> 00:02:50,031
- Don't I?

19
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:51,309
A, we're going to London,

20
00:02:51,309 --> 00:02:53,621
B, we're going to
celebrate and C...

21
00:02:53,621 --> 00:02:54,967
- Oh, no we're not.

22
00:02:59,282 --> 00:03:01,491
- I can't think why
you're so keen about

23
00:03:01,491 --> 00:03:03,424
this living in the
country business.

24
00:03:03,424 --> 00:03:05,323
It all seems pretty grim to me.

25
00:03:05,323 --> 00:03:07,704
- You wait till you
see it in the daytime.

26
00:03:07,704 --> 00:03:09,982
- Well, where is this wretched
cottage of yours anyway?

27
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:11,536
- Near Redminster.

28
00:03:11,536 --> 00:03:13,676
- Kate, not that awful
place of Philip's?

29
00:03:13,676 --> 00:03:16,506
Why, it's got pumps
and outside whatnots.

30
00:03:16,506 --> 00:03:19,095
- Nonsense, it's been converted.

31
00:03:19,095 --> 00:03:21,684
Beside, I've even got a woman
to come and look after it.

32
00:03:21,684 --> 00:03:24,204
Darling, do stop worrying.

33
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,895
Everything's under control.

34
00:03:36,285 --> 00:03:41,048
Oh, oh.

35
00:03:41,048 --> 00:03:42,083
- Hurry up, darling.

36
00:03:43,947 --> 00:03:45,777
- Oh.
- What is it now?

37
00:03:47,882 --> 00:03:49,367
What on earth did
you put it there for?

38
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:51,714
- Well, I didn't put it
there it just put itself.

39
00:03:51,714 --> 00:03:54,268
- Wheels don't put themselves
anywhere, my sweet.

40
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:56,063
Now come on, don't mess about.

41
00:03:56,063 --> 00:03:58,824
Look, you just sit in
the car while I fix it.

42
00:03:58,824 --> 00:04:00,136
It's gonna pour in a minute.

43
00:04:00,136 --> 00:04:01,517
- I was only trying to help.

44
00:04:01,517 --> 00:04:03,864
- Yes, I know, so
just sit in the car

45
00:04:03,864 --> 00:04:06,349
and leave it to
someone who knows how.

46
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,532
- I don't want to
be inquisitive.

47
00:04:16,532 --> 00:04:18,706
Are you looking for something?

48
00:04:18,706 --> 00:04:19,983
- No, no.

49
00:04:19,983 --> 00:04:22,503
It's just our way of having fun.

50
00:04:22,503 --> 00:04:23,435
We've lost our nut.

51
00:04:23,435 --> 00:04:24,747
- A rather silly thing to do.

52
00:04:24,747 --> 00:04:26,611
I'd come out and help
you to find them,

53
00:04:26,611 --> 00:04:28,854
but I haven't got my glasses.

54
00:04:28,854 --> 00:04:32,272
- Well, can you give us a
lift to the next garage then?

55
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,721
- That wouldn't help.

56
00:04:33,721 --> 00:04:36,034
- Why not?
- I'm the nearest garage

57
00:04:36,034 --> 00:04:37,898
and I'm not there, am I?

58
00:04:39,106 --> 00:04:41,798
- No, and it's very
lucky for us, isn't it?

59
00:04:41,798 --> 00:04:44,318
Otherwise, you wouldn't
be here, would you?

60
00:04:46,872 --> 00:04:50,082
- I'm beginning to think it's
very lucky that I am here.

61
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:51,739
- We really are in trouble.

62
00:04:51,739 --> 00:04:53,845
You see, we're complete
strangers around here,

63
00:04:53,845 --> 00:04:57,020
and we simply got
to get to Shepstone.

64
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,677
But you will help us, won't you?

65
00:04:58,677 --> 00:05:00,196
- My difficulty in life

66
00:05:00,196 --> 00:05:03,303
I'm never able to
resist a pretty face.

67
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,996
I've got an idea that
I'm not going to now.

68
00:05:06,996 --> 00:05:08,756
I'll run you over.

69
00:05:08,756 --> 00:05:10,171
- Well, what about the car?

70
00:05:10,171 --> 00:05:13,140
- We'll see to that
later it won't run away.

71
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:17,075
Get your things and I will put
them in the back of the car.

72
00:05:17,075 --> 00:05:18,663
Step back a little.

73
00:05:58,703 --> 00:05:59,911
Here, we are at last.

74
00:05:59,911 --> 00:06:01,361
Didn't take long, did it?

75
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,603
- Time is.

76
00:06:02,603 --> 00:06:04,398
- Come on, gorgeous.

77
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:05,572
Careful, dear.

78
00:06:07,781 --> 00:06:09,265
- Thank you so much.

79
00:06:09,265 --> 00:06:11,129
I think you're wonderful.

80
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:12,510
I think you're...

81
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,822
Oh, never mind.

82
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,795
- Come on, Archie.

83
00:06:21,795 --> 00:06:22,623
- Come on.

84
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:28,111
Nice cheerful welcome
from Mrs. Jones.

85
00:06:28,111 --> 00:06:29,389
I suppose she's gone to bed.

86
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,011
- Here I've got a spare key.

87
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,324
- Good.

88
00:06:34,324 --> 00:06:36,603
Oh, darn, now I
can't see a thing.

89
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,193
That's better.

90
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:43,506
Now, wait a minute while
I find the light switch.

91
00:06:43,506 --> 00:06:44,852
Oh, Archie!

92
00:06:44,852 --> 00:06:46,751
Drew, what are you doing?

93
00:06:46,751 --> 00:06:48,718
I tripped.

94
00:06:48,718 --> 00:06:53,240
- Well, stay where you are,
or you'll wreck the place.

95
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:57,140
Oh, darling.

96
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,763
- Well, you told me
to stay where I was.

97
00:06:58,763 --> 00:07:00,350
Don't be so silly.

98
00:07:01,697 --> 00:07:04,251
- Oh, well! I expect
it's woken up Mrs. Jones,

99
00:07:04,251 --> 00:07:07,461
which is probably a good
thing in the long run.

100
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:09,014
Now, she can get us some food.

101
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,263
- Andrew!

102
00:07:17,575 --> 00:07:18,748
- Yeah?
- Doesn't look as though

103
00:07:18,748 --> 00:07:19,887
there's gonna be any Mrs. Jones.

104
00:07:19,887 --> 00:07:21,406
- What, but I
distinctly remember...

105
00:07:21,406 --> 00:07:22,787
- Look.

106
00:07:22,787 --> 00:07:24,651
- "Dear Madam, I'm sorry,

107
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:26,411
"but my daughter is in trouble

108
00:07:27,895 --> 00:07:31,174
"with her first and
I have to go to her.

109
00:07:31,174 --> 00:07:33,038
- "Your food is in the cupboard,

110
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:34,730
"hot water bottle in bed,

111
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,490
"two pints ordered for morning.

112
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,560
"Hope to be back Monday.

113
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,493
"Yours faithfully," Emma Jones.

114
00:07:40,425 --> 00:07:42,220
Please be careful

115
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,533
"with the drinking
water tap in kitchen,

116
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:47,674
"as plumber didn't
come as promised."

117
00:07:47,674 --> 00:07:50,366
Well, I must say that's
a very fine start.

118
00:07:50,366 --> 00:07:52,230
- You can't really
blame her, darling.

119
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,508
After all, it is her first.

120
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:57,097
And anyway, I think,
it'll be rather nice

121
00:07:57,097 --> 00:07:58,339
to be left on our own.

122
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:01,204
Hm.

123
00:08:01,204 --> 00:08:03,966
- Well?
- Well, it's not bad.

124
00:08:03,966 --> 00:08:05,795
- Oh, I think it's wonderful,

125
00:08:05,795 --> 00:08:07,970
and I'm sure we're
gonna have a lot of fun.

126
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,420
Now, darling, all you
have to do is relax.

127
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,560
I'll see to everything.

128
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:15,667
But there is just one little
thing I would like you to do.

129
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:24,020
There we are, Archie.

130
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,884
That's better, isn't it?

131
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,266
Andrew!

132
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:40,140
- There.

133
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:43,108
That should keep the
darn thing quiet.

134
00:08:43,108 --> 00:08:45,283
- I'm sorry, darling.

135
00:08:45,283 --> 00:08:47,527
- It's all right, I suppose
you couldn't help it.

136
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,080
- Look, you go upstairs
and get your coat dry,

137
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,013
and I'll finish getting dinner.

138
00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:52,670
- What's it gonna be
Tinned baked beans?

139
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,603
- Now, darling,
don't get peevish.

140
00:08:54,603 --> 00:08:56,328
I promise it's going to be.

141
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:57,295
Wonderful.

142
00:08:57,295 --> 00:08:58,986
Absolutely wonderful.

143
00:08:58,986 --> 00:09:00,781
- You think, my
cooking has improved.

144
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:02,472
- Who said anything
about cooking?

145
00:09:03,404 --> 00:09:04,785
It's you, I'm talking about.

146
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,444
Oh, darling, I do love you so.

147
00:09:08,444 --> 00:09:09,997
- And, I love you too.

148
00:09:11,481 --> 00:09:13,138
But I've got all
this to clear away.

149
00:09:13,138 --> 00:09:15,969
- Oh, let it wait
until the morning.

150
00:09:15,969 --> 00:09:19,041
I really
ought to do it now.

151
00:09:20,249 --> 00:09:22,113
- You know, I'm
beginning to think this

152
00:09:22,113 --> 00:09:24,909
country idea of
yours is rather good.

153
00:09:24,909 --> 00:09:26,531
Peaceful and quiet.

154
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:30,742
- Somebody knocking?

155
00:09:30,742 --> 00:09:32,226
- No, it's probably the wind.

156
00:09:32,226 --> 00:09:33,089
Don't be silly.

157
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:34,366
Look at Archie.

158
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:38,163
- Must be Mrs.
Jones has come back.

159
00:09:38,163 --> 00:09:39,682
- Not at this time of night.

160
00:09:39,682 --> 00:09:41,650
Besides, she's got her own key.

161
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,617
- Now, well, who cares.

162
00:09:46,931 --> 00:09:48,933
- You'd better see
who it is, darling.

163
00:09:48,933 --> 00:09:49,934
- All right.

164
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,148
Hurry up it's raining!

165
00:09:57,148 --> 00:10:00,151
How much longer am I going
to be kept waiting here?

166
00:10:00,151 --> 00:10:03,223
Are you deaf or rude?

167
00:10:03,223 --> 00:10:05,121
Take my coat.
- Well, certainly.

168
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:06,191
- I'm soaked.

169
00:10:10,023 --> 00:10:11,403
Tulip's the name.

170
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:12,819
- Miss?

171
00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:14,924
Certainly.

172
00:10:14,924 --> 00:10:16,029
Go away, dog, go away!

173
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:17,513
Go away!
- Archie, stop it.

174
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,621
Miss Tulip, this
is Archibald Dax.

175
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,519
Now, you're not to
bark at Miss Tulip.

176
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,728
- My car has broken down.

177
00:10:25,728 --> 00:10:27,385
I've no intentions of
spending the night in it

178
00:10:27,385 --> 00:10:29,145
or walking two
miles in this storm.

179
00:10:29,145 --> 00:10:31,665
- No, but naturally not.

180
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:33,184
- Naturally not what?

181
00:10:33,184 --> 00:10:35,048
- What you said.

182
00:10:35,048 --> 00:10:38,085
- Quite, I'm glad
you see my point.

183
00:10:38,085 --> 00:10:40,881
Well, isn't anyone going to
show me to my room, Misses?

184
00:10:42,987 --> 00:10:44,264
Or is it Miss?

185
00:10:44,264 --> 00:10:45,472
- Misses.

186
00:10:45,472 --> 00:10:48,233
Allow me to present
my wife, Kate.

187
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:49,614
- How do you do Miss?

188
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,825
- Tulip I told you once,
Millicent Tulip, from the coast.

189
00:10:53,825 --> 00:10:55,102
- Forgive our ignorance.

190
00:10:55,102 --> 00:10:56,379
You see, we've only
just arrived here.

191
00:10:56,379 --> 00:10:58,899
So, we haven't had time
to make acquaintances.

192
00:10:58,899 --> 00:10:59,969
- Come along, cigarette.

193
00:11:01,005 --> 00:11:02,489
Strangers, eh.

194
00:11:02,489 --> 00:11:05,216
So, that's why I
didn't know your faces.

195
00:11:05,216 --> 00:11:06,527
- Please don't apologize.

196
00:11:06,527 --> 00:11:08,426
- Young man, I never apologize.

197
00:11:08,426 --> 00:11:09,738
Come along, matches, quick.

198
00:11:11,015 --> 00:11:12,223
What are you doing here?

199
00:11:13,811 --> 00:11:16,883
Planning a murder.

200
00:11:16,883 --> 00:11:18,229
- A murder?

201
00:11:18,229 --> 00:11:19,920
So, you are the writer?

202
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,611
- Yes, he's the writer.

203
00:11:21,611 --> 00:11:24,684
- Oh, why did I ever come here?

204
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,134
- I say, have you read
any of my efforts?

205
00:11:27,134 --> 00:11:29,274
- Of course, all of them.

206
00:11:29,274 --> 00:11:30,690
They're terrible.

207
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,518
Terrible.

208
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,038
Each one worse than the last.

209
00:11:34,038 --> 00:11:35,867
- Surely, they're not
as bad as all that.

210
00:11:35,867 --> 00:11:37,282
- I think, they're very good.

211
00:11:37,282 --> 00:11:38,939
- And with any luck
"Murder By Motive"

212
00:11:38,939 --> 00:11:41,701
should get the book
of the month award.

213
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,702
- Books?

214
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,670
- Are we talking about books?

215
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,327
Well, of course.

216
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:50,986
- Do you write books?

217
00:11:50,986 --> 00:11:53,782
- Yes, he's the Andrew Dax.

218
00:11:53,782 --> 00:11:55,128
- Dax?

219
00:11:55,128 --> 00:11:55,991
Never heard of it.

220
00:11:57,647 --> 00:12:00,789
So, you didn't
write those letters.

221
00:12:00,789 --> 00:12:02,066
- What letters?

222
00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:04,309
- The anonymous letters.

223
00:12:04,309 --> 00:12:05,690
They keep coming.

224
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,727
I received the last tonight.

225
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,454
Those letters.

226
00:12:11,454 --> 00:12:12,801
I had to get away.

227
00:12:12,801 --> 00:12:14,078
Then the car broke down.

228
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:15,527
When you both started
to talk about murder,

229
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:17,737
I thought they're
after my money.

230
00:12:18,668 --> 00:12:20,567
The Tulip money, you know.

231
00:12:20,567 --> 00:12:22,051
You must hide me.

232
00:12:22,051 --> 00:12:23,743
I'll be safe here.

233
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,227
I can't go back.

234
00:12:25,227 --> 00:12:27,332
I can't.
- Of course, you can't.

235
00:12:27,332 --> 00:12:29,058
Now, what you need is
a good night's rest,

236
00:12:29,058 --> 00:12:31,647
and tomorrow morning
we'll send for the police.

237
00:12:31,647 --> 00:12:33,511
- The police, never.

238
00:12:33,511 --> 00:12:35,375
Idiots, the lot.

239
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,273
And yet, maybe you're right.

240
00:12:37,273 --> 00:12:38,965
They should be informed.

241
00:12:38,965 --> 00:12:40,483
- Of course, they should.

242
00:12:40,483 --> 00:12:41,968
Now, I think, you
ought to go to bed,

243
00:12:41,968 --> 00:12:44,764
but, first of all, I'm gonna
go make you some hot milk.

244
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,490
- Not hot, cold, and
put some whisky in it.

245
00:12:50,493 --> 00:12:51,874
So, you write, eh?

246
00:12:51,874 --> 00:12:53,600
- Occasionally, Miss Tulip,

247
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,879
when conditions are
favorable to concentration.

248
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:59,261
- Interesting, most interesting.

249
00:12:59,261 --> 00:13:01,711
I am a distant relation
of Anthony Trollope,

250
00:13:01,711 --> 00:13:03,023
the writer, you know.

251
00:13:03,023 --> 00:13:05,094
- Yes, I have heard
of Mr. Trollope.

252
00:13:12,757 --> 00:13:14,897
- Mr. Dax, my revolver.

253
00:13:14,897 --> 00:13:16,243
If anyone attacks
us during the night,

254
00:13:16,243 --> 00:13:17,831
don't ask questions, shoot.

255
00:13:18,763 --> 00:13:21,248
- But, he may shoot first.

256
00:13:21,248 --> 00:13:22,318
- Then you've had it.

257
00:13:24,424 --> 00:13:25,770
- Here you are, Miss Tulip.

258
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,254
Shall I show you to your room?

259
00:13:29,015 --> 00:13:29,878
- And now to bed.

260
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:36,436
Isn't he coming?

261
00:13:36,436 --> 00:13:39,232
- Oh, no, Andrew wants to
stay down here and work.

262
00:13:39,232 --> 00:13:40,474
Don't you, darling?

263
00:13:40,474 --> 00:13:41,717
What
at this late hour?

264
00:13:41,717 --> 00:13:44,824
- Yes, he's very behind
with his present book.

265
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,895
- I see, just bone lazy.

266
00:13:46,895 --> 00:13:47,757
Oh, well.

267
00:13:52,107 --> 00:13:54,143
- Distant relative
of Anthony Trollope.

268
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,333
- Thanks.

269
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:14,094
It's much too late
for drinking, darling.

270
00:14:14,094 --> 00:14:16,338
Besides, I need it.

271
00:14:16,338 --> 00:14:17,166
- So, do I.

272
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:24,864
- Cheers.

273
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:25,726
- Miss Tulip.

274
00:14:28,246 --> 00:14:29,454
- Well, that reminds me.

275
00:14:29,454 --> 00:14:31,008
I've got another
little job for you.

276
00:14:31,008 --> 00:14:33,631
She wants you to lock
her jewelry in the safe.

277
00:14:33,631 --> 00:14:35,805
- Safe, we haven't
got a safe, have we?

278
00:14:35,805 --> 00:14:38,291
- I know, but I haven't
got the heart to tell her.

279
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,087
You think she's mad?

280
00:14:42,157 --> 00:14:44,366
- God, mad as a March hare.

281
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:47,093
- Poor, old thing was
very frightened, though.

282
00:14:47,093 --> 00:14:48,680
- Not half as
frightened as I was.

283
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,751
Oh, what a woman.

284
00:14:50,751 --> 00:14:51,960
She gives me the shivers.

285
00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:55,860
- This is gonna give you the
shivers in more ways than one.

286
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,862
I've lent her our
only hot water bottle.

287
00:15:01,831 --> 00:15:05,835
You know, darling, there are
times when I almost like you.

288
00:15:08,148 --> 00:15:09,598
If I let you go to bed now,

289
00:15:09,598 --> 00:15:11,876
will you promise to
finish your book tomorrow?

290
00:15:14,741 --> 00:15:16,501
- You know, darling,
there are times

291
00:15:16,501 --> 00:15:18,227
when I almost like you, too.

292
00:15:46,048 --> 00:15:47,187
- Andrew.

293
00:15:47,187 --> 00:15:48,016
Andrew.

294
00:15:49,396 --> 00:15:50,984
There's someone coming upstairs.

295
00:16:03,721 --> 00:16:05,067
- Hello, darling.

296
00:16:05,067 --> 00:16:06,275
You awake?

297
00:16:06,275 --> 00:16:08,312
Of
course, I'm awake.

298
00:16:08,312 --> 00:16:11,418
You crashing about the house
like a bull in a china shop.

299
00:16:11,418 --> 00:16:12,592
- Oh, I'm sorry, darling.

300
00:16:12,592 --> 00:16:13,731
I was being as
quiet as I could be.

301
00:16:13,731 --> 00:16:15,698
- That's just the point.

302
00:16:15,698 --> 00:16:18,770
If you'd made a real noise,
I'd have know who it was.

303
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,462
- It's all my fault, darling.

304
00:16:20,462 --> 00:16:24,466
You just go to sleep and
choke me off in the morning.

305
00:16:52,908 --> 00:16:54,461
- Archie?

306
00:16:54,461 --> 00:16:55,290
Archie?

307
00:16:58,638 --> 00:16:59,466
Archie?

308
00:17:21,764 --> 00:17:22,593
Andrew!

309
00:17:23,628 --> 00:17:24,457
Andrew!

310
00:17:26,735 --> 00:17:29,255
- Darling, are you
hurt, what is it?

311
00:17:29,255 --> 00:17:30,083
- It's Miss Tulip.

312
00:17:41,267 --> 00:17:43,062
She's dead, isn't she?

313
00:17:47,135 --> 00:17:47,997
- Yes.

314
00:17:49,758 --> 00:17:50,655
Quite dead.

315
00:17:51,898 --> 00:17:55,936
- Andrew, if only we'd
been nicer to her.

316
00:17:55,936 --> 00:17:59,078
Why, we weren't
to know, were we?

317
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,632
We didn't know she
was going to die.

318
00:18:01,632 --> 00:18:03,012
- Of course, we didn't.

319
00:18:03,012 --> 00:18:04,669
- It's all so terrifying.

320
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:06,015
If we had known.
- Stop it!

321
00:18:06,015 --> 00:18:07,155
Stop it, stop it, Kate,

322
00:18:07,155 --> 00:18:09,674
or I'll sock you!

323
00:18:09,674 --> 00:18:11,573
- You wouldn't.

324
00:18:11,573 --> 00:18:13,230
- I would, you know.

325
00:18:15,853 --> 00:18:17,510
- I'm sorry, Andrew.

326
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:19,857
- That's better.

327
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:22,825
- I'm all right now.

328
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,969
Look, you run
along out into the garden,

329
00:18:28,969 --> 00:18:30,350
and I'll have a look around.

330
00:18:33,526 --> 00:18:37,288
- Andrew, I'm sorry
I was such a baby.

331
00:18:38,565 --> 00:18:40,222
Anyway, you have
all the atmosphere

332
00:18:40,222 --> 00:18:41,637
you want for your books now.

333
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,171
Andrew, it's awfully
cold out here.

334
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,517
- It's all right, darling.

335
00:19:33,517 --> 00:19:35,381
You can come in now.

336
00:19:35,381 --> 00:19:36,554
Feeling better?

337
00:19:36,554 --> 00:19:37,831
- A bit.
Good, well,

338
00:19:37,831 --> 00:19:39,937
sit yourself down and
here have a cigarette.

339
00:19:39,937 --> 00:19:40,765
- Thanks.

340
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:44,597
You know, I just
can't understand it.

341
00:19:44,597 --> 00:19:47,807
I know, she seemed a bit mad
but to do a thing like this.

342
00:19:50,637 --> 00:19:51,604
- She didn't do it.

343
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:53,709
It's not suicide, Kate.

344
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:57,541
She was shot and there's
no sign of a gun.

345
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:58,749
I'm afraid, it's murder.

346
00:19:59,922 --> 00:20:01,993
- But if she was shot,
we'd have heard it.

347
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:03,719
- I know, silly, isn't it?

348
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:05,928
- Besides, how could
anyone have got in?

349
00:20:08,276 --> 00:20:10,070
The French windows they
were open this morning

350
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,140
when I came down.

351
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,107
- Were they?

352
00:20:12,107 --> 00:20:13,522
We shut them last night.

353
00:20:13,522 --> 00:20:14,592
- I know, I thought
Archie might have done it.

354
00:20:14,592 --> 00:20:16,732
- By the way, where is Archie?

355
00:20:16,732 --> 00:20:18,389
- He's gone rabbiting, I expect.

356
00:20:18,389 --> 00:20:20,080
You know, what he's like
when he gets in the country.

357
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,013
- Do you think he's all right?

358
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:22,876
- Trust Archie.

359
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:26,086
- Well, it wasn't
forced, anyway.

360
00:20:26,086 --> 00:20:27,295
I wonder if.
- Hm.

361
00:20:27,295 --> 00:20:29,918
- I wonder if she let
someone in herself.

362
00:20:29,918 --> 00:20:30,850
- Why should she?

363
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,334
- Haven't the remotest idea.

364
00:20:32,334 --> 00:20:34,543
The whole thing's so screwy.

365
00:20:34,543 --> 00:20:36,752
Oh, Lord, I suppose I'd better
telephone for the police.

366
00:20:36,752 --> 00:20:38,237
- Andrew, must we
have the police?

367
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,067
- Of course, we must but
it'll be all right, darling.

368
00:20:41,067 --> 00:20:43,069
I know what let's have
a nice drink, first.

369
00:20:43,069 --> 00:20:45,382
- I'd rather have a cup of tea.

370
00:20:45,382 --> 00:20:47,729
Oh, heavens, I've
left the kettle on!

371
00:20:47,729 --> 00:20:49,040
- Kate?
- Hmm.

372
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,525
When the
police do get here,

373
00:20:50,525 --> 00:20:52,009
let me do the talking.

374
00:20:52,009 --> 00:20:54,874
- Of course, darling,
I won't say a word.

375
00:21:09,302 --> 00:21:10,303
Andrew, tea.

376
00:21:53,346 --> 00:21:54,934
May I come in?

377
00:21:54,934 --> 00:21:56,211
Good morning, madam.

378
00:21:56,211 --> 00:21:57,626
There's a car
outside in the lane,

379
00:21:57,626 --> 00:21:59,110
in rather a dangerous position.

380
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,284
- A car?

381
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:03,529
That's not ours.

382
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:05,047
Ours is miles away.

383
00:22:06,255 --> 00:22:09,155
We lost our nuts, you see.

384
00:22:09,155 --> 00:22:10,363
- Did you?

385
00:22:10,363 --> 00:22:11,399
I know it's not yours.

386
00:22:11,399 --> 00:22:13,228
It's Miss Tulip's.

387
00:22:13,228 --> 00:22:15,195
Can I have a word with her?

388
00:22:15,195 --> 00:22:16,818
She's here, isn't she?

389
00:22:16,818 --> 00:22:17,646
- No, she isn't.

390
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:20,235
Not really.

391
00:22:20,235 --> 00:22:22,133
- Perhaps you can tell
me where she's gone?

392
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:23,618
- Well, I couldn't do that.

393
00:22:24,722 --> 00:22:26,275
- Why not?

394
00:22:26,275 --> 00:22:27,484
- That would only be guessing.

395
00:22:27,484 --> 00:22:30,383
And besides, I promised
not to talk to the...

396
00:22:32,903 --> 00:22:35,664
Perhaps, you better
speak to my husband.

397
00:22:35,664 --> 00:22:36,631
I'll get him.

398
00:22:38,046 --> 00:22:38,874
Andrew.

399
00:22:40,531 --> 00:22:41,360
Andrew.

400
00:22:42,499 --> 00:22:43,603
Andrew, where are you?

401
00:22:48,988 --> 00:22:50,334
He's not there.

402
00:22:50,334 --> 00:22:52,198
- Perhaps he's in the garden.

403
00:22:52,198 --> 00:22:53,406
Very nice, too, early morning,

404
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:55,960
lovely fresh smell,
nice bit of sun.

405
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,756
"A garden is a lovesome
thing, God wot.

406
00:22:58,756 --> 00:23:01,449
"Rose plot, fringed
pool, fern'd grot.

407
00:23:01,449 --> 00:23:04,797
"The veriest school of peace."

408
00:23:04,797 --> 00:23:07,109
That's not mine,
some other bloke.

409
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,528
What's that?

410
00:23:11,528 --> 00:23:12,701
- What's what?

411
00:23:17,672 --> 00:23:20,122
- I thought so, Aphids.

412
00:23:20,122 --> 00:23:21,400
- Are they?

413
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,229
I'm afraid I don't
know their names.

414
00:23:23,229 --> 00:23:24,817
- Greenfly, to beginners.

415
00:23:24,817 --> 00:23:26,474
Look at them having
a whale of a time.

416
00:23:26,474 --> 00:23:28,407
Won't do, you know,
it won't do at all.

417
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,201
- Terribly sorry.
- So you ought to be.

418
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:32,341
Any man or woman

419
00:23:32,341 --> 00:23:36,311
who has greenfly on his
roses is capable of anything.

420
00:23:36,311 --> 00:23:37,519
Anything.

421
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:38,796
- I'll take them off.

422
00:23:38,796 --> 00:23:40,833
- No, no, no, no spray
them with soapy water.

423
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:41,765
Washing soap, mind you.

424
00:23:41,765 --> 00:23:43,525
None of your scented stuff.

425
00:23:43,525 --> 00:23:46,977
Any man or woman who
squirts synthetic perfume

426
00:23:46,977 --> 00:23:48,634
over a rose is
capable of murder.

427
00:23:50,152 --> 00:23:51,982
- Would you like
some tea, officer?

428
00:23:51,982 --> 00:23:54,122
- Oh, well, thank
you kindly, lady,

429
00:23:54,122 --> 00:23:56,469
but I'm afraid it's
against regulations.

430
00:23:57,781 --> 00:23:59,368
Not on duty.

431
00:23:59,368 --> 00:24:01,232
Mind you, we did have a
lecture last week on courtesy.

432
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:03,407
It would be
ungracious to refuse.

433
00:24:03,407 --> 00:24:05,064
Thank you very much.

434
00:24:07,584 --> 00:24:11,035
- I take it you like gardening.

435
00:24:11,035 --> 00:24:12,140
- Like it, I love it.

436
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,969
That's why I
transferred down here.

437
00:24:13,969 --> 00:24:14,798
The soil's better.

438
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:16,558
You can grow things.

439
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:19,043
Better than that mangy
allotment I had in London.

440
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:22,184
Why, I had eight years
in London in the Met.

441
00:24:24,014 --> 00:24:25,533
Far too much going on.

442
00:24:25,533 --> 00:24:27,845
Everybody rushing about.

443
00:24:27,845 --> 00:24:30,434
Dope, hold-ups, fights, murders.

444
00:24:30,434 --> 00:24:31,780
Thank you.

445
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,126
Never saw anything like it.

446
00:24:33,126 --> 00:24:34,852
Very different down here.

447
00:24:34,852 --> 00:24:37,441
Nothing ever happens,
all very quiet,

448
00:24:37,441 --> 00:24:40,479
except Mr. Thorne,
our CID Inspector.

449
00:24:42,722 --> 00:24:45,484
Not altogether what you
might call a quiet type.

450
00:24:49,626 --> 00:24:50,937
Now, what's that?

451
00:24:50,937 --> 00:24:52,249
- More greenfly?

452
00:24:52,249 --> 00:24:54,734
- No, over there it's a woman.

453
00:24:57,219 --> 00:25:01,189
- Yes, that's Miss Tulip.

454
00:25:01,189 --> 00:25:02,880
- I thought you said
she wasn't here.

455
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,815
- Well, she isn't in a way.

456
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:10,612
- I don't quite follow.

457
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,514
Oh, I see 40 winks.

458
00:25:16,791 --> 00:25:18,586
I'm afraid we'll
have to wake her up.

459
00:25:18,586 --> 00:25:21,002
- I'm afraid that will
be impossible, officer.

460
00:25:21,002 --> 00:25:23,936
You see, Miss Tulip is dead.

461
00:25:23,936 --> 00:25:26,386
- Oh, that's different.

462
00:25:26,386 --> 00:25:28,250
What did you say?

463
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,528
- I was just going to
ring for the police.

464
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,599
- It's a good
thing I came along.

465
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:33,083
What was it, heart failure?

466
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:35,879
- Yes, in a way, she was shot.

467
00:25:35,879 --> 00:25:37,087
- Shot?

468
00:25:37,087 --> 00:25:39,192
No, sir, don't touch
anything, if you please.

469
00:25:39,192 --> 00:25:41,298
Everything is to be
left exactly as it is.

470
00:25:43,438 --> 00:25:44,957
Hmm.

471
00:25:44,957 --> 00:25:45,785
Nasty.

472
00:25:46,821 --> 00:25:47,649
Very nasty.

473
00:25:49,617 --> 00:25:50,549
I'll have to use your phone.

474
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,550
Where is it?

475
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,378
Thanks.

476
00:25:55,726 --> 00:25:57,694
Hello, Maggie, get me
the station, will you?

477
00:25:57,694 --> 00:25:58,695
It's urgent.

478
00:25:59,903 --> 00:26:00,662
Eh?

479
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:02,699
The dahlias?

480
00:26:04,045 --> 00:26:06,357
Nah, that ain't
birds, that's slugs.

481
00:26:06,357 --> 00:26:08,394
I'll come around tomorrow
with some powder.

482
00:26:08,394 --> 00:26:10,672
Get them number quickly
though it's very serious.

483
00:26:11,639 --> 00:26:12,571
Dear, dear.

484
00:26:14,055 --> 00:26:16,402
And you were just settling
down to a nice cup of tea.

485
00:26:16,402 --> 00:26:18,266
- Well, so were you.

486
00:26:18,266 --> 00:26:19,647
- I didn't know she was there.

487
00:26:19,647 --> 00:26:20,924
- No, but I did.

488
00:26:20,924 --> 00:26:22,581
That's why I wanted the tea.

489
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,824
- How long have you been
friends with Miss Tulip?

490
00:26:24,824 --> 00:26:26,032
- Oh, we weren't friends.

491
00:26:26,032 --> 00:26:27,689
She just spent the night here.

492
00:26:27,689 --> 00:26:29,173
- Spent the night here,
but you didn't like her?

493
00:26:29,173 --> 00:26:31,900
- I didn't say that I just
said that we weren't friends.

494
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,798
- Pardon, my mistake.

495
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:34,144
- We didn't like her.

496
00:26:34,144 --> 00:26:36,318
As a matter of fact,
she was very rude.

497
00:26:36,318 --> 00:26:39,252
Stalking in here
and demanding a bed

498
00:26:39,252 --> 00:26:41,496
and milk and a hot water bottle.

499
00:26:41,496 --> 00:26:43,049
And she seemed to
think that we'd just

500
00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:44,948
give her whatever she wanted.

501
00:26:44,948 --> 00:26:46,328
- Did she want that?

502
00:26:46,328 --> 00:26:48,641
- Want what?

503
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:49,608
- Murder.

504
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,264
- Now you're being silly.

505
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,922
- Madam, as a proud but humble
member of the police force,

506
00:26:53,922 --> 00:26:56,580
I must ask you to
withdraw that remark.

507
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,789
- Weill, I don't mean
that you're silly.

508
00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:00,446
I just meant that it
was silly to think

509
00:27:00,446 --> 00:27:02,275
that she'd want to be killed.

510
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,451
- Apology accepted.

511
00:27:05,451 --> 00:27:06,970
But you better be
careful of Mr. Thorne.

512
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:09,489
As I said before, he's not
altogether the quiet type.

513
00:27:09,489 --> 00:27:10,836
Oi, where are you off to?

514
00:27:10,836 --> 00:27:12,182
- To finish dressing.

515
00:27:12,182 --> 00:27:13,632
I want my coat.

516
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,288
- I'm afraid, I must
ask you to remain here

517
00:27:15,288 --> 00:27:16,773
until the Inspector arrives.

518
00:27:16,773 --> 00:27:18,291
- Oh, all right.

519
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:20,362
Is there any objection to
my having a cup of tea?

520
00:27:20,362 --> 00:27:22,951
- That if I may say so,
sir, is entirely a matter

521
00:27:22,951 --> 00:27:25,195
between you and your conscience.

522
00:27:26,368 --> 00:27:27,473
Yes, yes, yes.

523
00:27:27,473 --> 00:27:29,578
- Hello, Mr. Thorne?

524
00:27:29,578 --> 00:27:30,718
Detective
Inspector Thorne here.

525
00:27:30,718 --> 00:27:32,927
- 215 Feathers talking.

526
00:27:32,927 --> 00:27:34,583
At 10:00 a.m. this morning,

527
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:36,551
as I was proceeding
along Shepstone Road.

528
00:27:36,551 --> 00:27:38,795
- Get on with it.
- In the course of my duty.

529
00:27:38,795 --> 00:27:40,417
Don't
blether about your duty.

530
00:27:40,417 --> 00:27:42,177
- In the course of my duty!

531
00:27:42,177 --> 00:27:44,041
For heaven's
sake come to the point, man!

532
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:46,319
- In the course of my duty!

533
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:47,424
Come to the point.

534
00:27:47,424 --> 00:27:48,908
- I'm coming to the point.

535
00:27:48,908 --> 00:27:51,221
Will you cut the
gaggle and come to the point?

536
00:27:51,221 --> 00:27:55,018
- How can I come to the point
if you don't listen, sir?

537
00:27:55,018 --> 00:27:56,295
What's it all about?

538
00:27:56,295 --> 00:27:58,021
- It's Miss Tulip.
- What about her?

539
00:27:58,021 --> 00:27:59,229
- She's been murdered.

540
00:28:01,852 --> 00:28:04,372
That shook him.

541
00:28:14,175 --> 00:28:16,556
- Kate, there's something very
funny about this business.

542
00:28:16,556 --> 00:28:17,730
- Doesn't make me laugh.

543
00:28:19,905 --> 00:28:23,322
- Let's try and work out
how it could have been done.

544
00:28:23,322 --> 00:28:26,532
Now, suppose I was the murderer,

545
00:28:27,567 --> 00:28:28,672
and was following her.

546
00:28:29,915 --> 00:28:32,607
Then her car breaks down.

547
00:28:32,607 --> 00:28:36,093
But before I can do
anything about it,

548
00:28:37,094 --> 00:28:38,440
she's in here, with us.

549
00:28:40,995 --> 00:28:42,617
Well, I'd wait.

550
00:28:42,617 --> 00:28:44,412
And then, until
she'd gone to bed.

551
00:28:45,482 --> 00:28:48,036
And then, break in somehow.

552
00:28:48,036 --> 00:28:49,969
- That's no good Archie
would have barked.

553
00:28:49,969 --> 00:28:50,798
- That's true.

554
00:28:52,489 --> 00:28:54,940
Then she must have gone
out and let someone in.

555
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,838
That's it, there was
mud on her shoes.

556
00:28:58,253 --> 00:29:00,842
I threw stones at
her bedroom window,

557
00:29:00,842 --> 00:29:04,466
and she came down and let me
in through the French windows.

558
00:29:04,466 --> 00:29:06,158
Then I did her in.

559
00:29:06,158 --> 00:29:07,538
- Did you indeed?

560
00:29:10,472 --> 00:29:12,681
- Hello, are you
someone I should know?

561
00:29:12,681 --> 00:29:13,821
- I have a feeling
you're going to know me

562
00:29:13,821 --> 00:29:15,546
extremely well, sir.

563
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:16,720
My name's Thorne.

564
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,204
Detective Inspector Thorne.

565
00:29:19,274 --> 00:29:20,931
- How do you do, Inspector?

566
00:29:20,931 --> 00:29:23,831
This is my wife we were just
reconstructing the crime.

567
00:29:23,831 --> 00:29:25,177
- Reconstructing?

568
00:29:25,177 --> 00:29:26,972
Or recollecting?

569
00:29:26,972 --> 00:29:28,490
- Why, I'm not altogether sure

570
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:31,286
that I like the implication
of that question.

571
00:29:31,286 --> 00:29:32,805
- I'm not altogether
sure that I intended you

572
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:33,979
to like it, Mr. Curtis.

573
00:29:33,979 --> 00:29:35,601
- Mr. Dax.
- What's that?

574
00:29:35,601 --> 00:29:37,085
- Not Mr. Curtis, Mr. Dax.

575
00:29:37,085 --> 00:29:38,949
- You told me the cottage
belonged to Mr.Curtis.

576
00:29:38,949 --> 00:29:42,435
- So it does but Mr. Dax
rented it from Mr. Curtis.

577
00:29:42,435 --> 00:29:43,851
- Why didn't you say so?

578
00:29:43,851 --> 00:29:44,852
- You didn't ask me.

579
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,234
- Are you here on holiday?

580
00:29:48,234 --> 00:29:50,167
- No such luck, just working.

581
00:29:50,167 --> 00:29:53,653
- Supposed to be working but
he hasn't done a stroke yet.

582
00:29:53,653 --> 00:29:57,174
Says it's lack of atmosphere,
but it's just laziness really.

583
00:29:57,174 --> 00:29:58,003
In the present murder...

584
00:29:58,003 --> 00:29:59,694
- What my wife means.

585
00:29:59,694 --> 00:30:00,868
- Just a moment, sir.

586
00:30:00,868 --> 00:30:02,317
I'd rather Mrs. Dax
tell me herself.

587
00:30:02,317 --> 00:30:03,629
Yes, Mrs. Dax?

588
00:30:03,629 --> 00:30:05,355
- Well, in Murder by Marriage,

589
00:30:05,355 --> 00:30:08,289
that's what he's supposed
to be writing now.

590
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:09,117
- Writing?

591
00:30:10,256 --> 00:30:11,810
Oh, yes!

592
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,813
Dax you have all the facts.

593
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,574
I'm very pleased to
meet you, Mr. Dax.

594
00:30:18,678 --> 00:30:20,439
- Are you really, Inspector?

595
00:30:20,439 --> 00:30:23,752
- Yes, you always show us
policemen to be such half wits.

596
00:30:23,752 --> 00:30:25,133
It'll be a privilege
to get a few tips

597
00:30:25,133 --> 00:30:26,652
from such a brilliant amateur.

598
00:30:27,722 --> 00:30:29,172
- I shall be delighted
to assist you

599
00:30:29,172 --> 00:30:31,139
in any way I can, Inspector.

600
00:30:31,139 --> 00:30:32,485
- You really will?

601
00:30:32,485 --> 00:30:34,142
Splendid.

602
00:30:34,142 --> 00:30:35,661
Then perhaps you'll
assist us by telling us

603
00:30:35,661 --> 00:30:37,801
why you didn't ring
us up straightaway?

604
00:30:37,801 --> 00:30:40,183
- Well, I'm afraid my
enthusiasm as a writer

605
00:30:41,632 --> 00:30:43,772
overcame my duty as a citizen.

606
00:30:43,772 --> 00:30:45,705
- He was looking for clues.

607
00:30:45,705 --> 00:30:46,914
- Really, hmm.

608
00:30:46,914 --> 00:30:48,156
Being Mr. Dax I
should have thought

609
00:30:48,156 --> 00:30:50,296
they would have
given themselves up.

610
00:30:50,296 --> 00:30:51,573
Did you find any?

611
00:30:51,573 --> 00:30:52,367
- Oh, naturally.

612
00:30:53,506 --> 00:30:54,853
Come on here, I'll show you.

613
00:30:57,752 --> 00:30:59,823
Look at that button.

614
00:30:59,823 --> 00:31:02,550
It's obviously fallen
from Miss Tulip's hand.

615
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,552
Now it's quite usual for
the victim to be found

616
00:31:04,552 --> 00:31:06,623
clutching a piece of
the murderer's clothing.

617
00:31:06,623 --> 00:31:07,451
But that button is torn
from Miss Tulip's own dress.

618
00:31:09,108 --> 00:31:11,110
- Oh, darling, you are clever.

619
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,629
Isn't he clever, Inspector?

620
00:31:12,629 --> 00:31:14,079
- Extremely clever,
Mrs. Dax, yes.

621
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:15,977
People do clutch at their
clothing when they're.

622
00:31:15,977 --> 00:31:17,254
I wish you'd tell
me when you're gonna

623
00:31:17,254 --> 00:31:18,255
fire that thing, Wilson.

624
00:31:18,255 --> 00:31:19,325
- Sorry, sir.

625
00:31:19,325 --> 00:31:21,362
- Always makes me jump.

626
00:31:21,362 --> 00:31:22,604
As I was saying,
people do clutch

627
00:31:22,604 --> 00:31:24,020
at their clothing
when they are dying.

628
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,987
- Maybe, but you
don't have much time

629
00:31:25,987 --> 00:31:26,919
when you're shot
through the head.

630
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:28,921
- You've got a point there.

631
00:31:28,921 --> 00:31:29,991
Any more theories?

632
00:31:29,991 --> 00:31:31,613
- No, not at the moment.

633
00:31:31,613 --> 00:31:32,545
- Oh, too bad.

634
00:31:32,545 --> 00:31:33,719
Well, failing the mastermind,

635
00:31:33,719 --> 00:31:35,928
we'll have to rub along
as best as we can.

636
00:31:35,928 --> 00:31:37,240
I want to see that car.

637
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,310
- Car?
- Yes, the car

638
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,483
Miss Tulip came in.

639
00:31:39,483 --> 00:31:40,415
- Oh, that car.

640
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:43,936
- Uh, Feathers.
- Yes, sir.

641
00:31:43,936 --> 00:31:45,973
- Just keep Mrs. Dax from
feeling lonely, will you?

642
00:31:45,973 --> 00:31:47,457
- Very good, sir.
- But I want to go too.

643
00:31:47,457 --> 00:31:49,666
- Leave it to me I'll fix it.

644
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:52,082
Mr. Thorne, you
think Mrs. Dax might.

645
00:31:52,082 --> 00:31:54,602
You heard.

646
00:31:54,602 --> 00:31:56,362
- I fixed it.

647
00:31:56,362 --> 00:31:57,501
You stay here.

648
00:31:58,951 --> 00:31:59,779
- Oh, well.

649
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:01,643
I suppose I might as well as

650
00:32:01,643 --> 00:32:03,542
make some sandwiches and coffee.

651
00:32:03,542 --> 00:32:05,233
Haven't had any
breakfast this morning.

652
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,167
- What's the matter?

653
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,307
Just a minute where you going?

654
00:32:10,307 --> 00:32:11,308
- There was somebody
there at the window.

655
00:32:11,308 --> 00:32:12,620
I'm sure it was the murderer.

656
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,208
- Now, now, now, it's no
good trying to bluff me.

657
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:15,899
- But it was a woman
I saw her distinctly.

658
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:17,280
- Now, now, now.

659
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,902
- Well, go and look for yourself
if you don't believe me.

660
00:32:18,902 --> 00:32:21,284
- Let you slip out
through the front door?

661
00:32:21,284 --> 00:32:23,182
This is P.C. Feathers.

662
00:32:23,182 --> 00:32:26,185
Now, lady, let's be
friends over this thing.

663
00:32:26,185 --> 00:32:27,600
What about that coffee, eh?

664
00:32:28,808 --> 00:32:32,571
- All right, but I'm not
gonna make it by myself.

665
00:32:32,571 --> 00:32:34,435
You'd better come with me.

666
00:32:34,435 --> 00:32:35,574
- Try and keep me out.

667
00:32:42,443 --> 00:32:44,065
- Seems dead all right.

668
00:32:44,065 --> 00:32:45,584
Funny, eh, Mr.Dax?

669
00:32:45,584 --> 00:32:47,344
- Why I don't see there's
anything funny about it.

670
00:32:47,344 --> 00:32:48,863
Cars do stop, you know.

671
00:32:48,863 --> 00:32:50,037
It's just a darn nuisance

672
00:32:50,037 --> 00:32:52,453
that this one packed
up last night.

673
00:32:52,453 --> 00:32:54,973
- Yes, it's quite a coincidence.

674
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,767
- Do you know anything
about cars, Mr. Dax?

675
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:58,286
- Just enough to switch on

676
00:32:58,286 --> 00:33:00,323
and press the starter
that's about all.

677
00:33:00,323 --> 00:33:03,982
- Wasn't one of your books
called The Garage Murder?

678
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:07,019
- Yes, but that was
strictly non-technical.

679
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:08,676
- Was it, I thought
you thought it

680
00:33:08,676 --> 00:33:10,885
with aid of your
mechanic genius.

681
00:33:10,885 --> 00:33:12,542
- I say, you're
quite a fan of mine.

682
00:33:12,542 --> 00:33:14,337
- If you care to
put it that way.

683
00:33:14,337 --> 00:33:15,269
It's a pity you know

684
00:33:15,269 --> 00:33:16,546
so little about cars, Mr. Dax.

685
00:33:16,546 --> 00:33:18,134
- Oh, why?

686
00:33:18,134 --> 00:33:19,998
- Because you could have
fixed this one in a jiffy.

687
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,827
All that's wrong is that
the main distributor lead

688
00:33:21,827 --> 00:33:23,277
has slipped out of its socket.

689
00:33:23,277 --> 00:33:24,588
- Well, it must be loose.

690
00:33:24,588 --> 00:33:26,073
- It isn't.

691
00:33:26,073 --> 00:33:28,144
- It looks as if someone had
deliberately disabled the car.

692
00:33:28,144 --> 00:33:31,147
Almost as if someone wanted
Miss Tulip to spend the night.

693
00:33:31,147 --> 00:33:33,528
Then they
didn't know Miss Tulip.

694
00:33:33,528 --> 00:33:36,083
- Did you, Mr. Dax?
- Eh, did I what?

695
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:37,843
- Know Miss Tulip?

696
00:33:37,843 --> 00:33:40,156
- Well, not before last night.

697
00:33:40,156 --> 00:33:41,778
- Hmm, quite a short friendship.

698
00:33:41,778 --> 00:33:43,780
Come on, let's get
back to the house.

699
00:33:51,926 --> 00:33:53,134
You know, Inspector,

700
00:33:53,134 --> 00:33:54,963
you're developing a
nasty suspicious mind,

701
00:33:54,963 --> 00:33:57,483
but you're wasting your
time turning it on me.

702
00:33:57,483 --> 00:33:59,796
- You think so that's
your expert view?

703
00:33:59,796 --> 00:34:01,591
- That's my inspired view.

704
00:34:01,591 --> 00:34:04,214
You see, I'm one of the
only two people in the world

705
00:34:04,214 --> 00:34:06,320
who know the vital
fact of this murder.

706
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,252
- You are?

707
00:34:07,252 --> 00:34:08,080
- Yes.

708
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,254
I know I didn't do it,

709
00:34:09,254 --> 00:34:11,256
and the murderer knows he did.

710
00:34:11,256 --> 00:34:12,912
And if you'd concentrate
on finding him

711
00:34:12,912 --> 00:34:14,811
instead of making cheap
cracks about my book...

712
00:34:14,811 --> 00:34:16,709
- I'm conducting this
investigation, Mr. Dax.

713
00:34:16,709 --> 00:34:19,229
And I'll turn my
nasty suspicious mind

714
00:34:19,229 --> 00:34:20,782
in any way I think
it'll do most good.

715
00:34:20,782 --> 00:34:23,820
- All right, I was only
trying to be helpful.

716
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,339
Routine investigation, Mr. Dax.

717
00:34:25,339 --> 00:34:27,513
I don't like to be caught
by unexpected discoveries.

718
00:34:27,513 --> 00:34:29,584
- Well, then I don't
expect you'll like that.

719
00:34:31,207 --> 00:34:32,794
- After her, Akers.

720
00:34:35,107 --> 00:34:37,420
We'll head her off this way.

721
00:34:42,287 --> 00:34:43,805
- You take your
hands off me, Tommy.

722
00:34:43,805 --> 00:34:44,772
'Cause I wasn't doing any harm.

723
00:34:44,772 --> 00:34:46,291
- Now what's all this?

724
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:48,120
- You tell this great lout
to take his hands off me.

725
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,052
- All right, Akers.

726
00:34:49,052 --> 00:34:50,295
Who is she?

727
00:34:50,295 --> 00:34:51,503
- Miss Gale, sir.

728
00:34:51,503 --> 00:34:53,125
Miss Tulip's companion.

729
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:54,713
She's rather deaf.

730
00:34:54,713 --> 00:34:56,024
- What are you
doing here, Judith?

731
00:34:56,024 --> 00:34:57,336
- Don't you shout at me.

732
00:34:57,336 --> 00:34:59,062
- All right, leave it to me.

733
00:34:59,062 --> 00:35:00,270
What are you doing
here, Miss Gale?

734
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:01,720
- Speak up, can't you?
- What we want to know...

735
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,101
- I heard.

736
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,619
It's Miss Tulip.

737
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:06,173
She didn't come home last
night and I got worried.

738
00:35:06,173 --> 00:35:07,484
- Why didn't you
phone the police?

739
00:35:07,484 --> 00:35:09,107
- I don't hold with telephones.

740
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,074
I was going down to
the police station

741
00:35:11,074 --> 00:35:13,007
when I saw you all
nosing around the car.

742
00:35:13,007 --> 00:35:14,802
And I thought I'd better
find out what was happening

743
00:35:14,802 --> 00:35:16,148
before I said anything.

744
00:35:17,701 --> 00:35:18,909
Who's he?

745
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:20,532
- Mr. Dax, a tenant
at the cottage.

746
00:35:20,532 --> 00:35:21,947
We'd better go inside.

747
00:35:21,947 --> 00:35:23,776
- Strangers, eh?

748
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:26,193
I don't hold with strangers.

749
00:35:26,193 --> 00:35:27,401
- I'm afraid you're
not going to hold

750
00:35:27,401 --> 00:35:30,024
with what you'll
find inside either.

751
00:35:37,204 --> 00:35:38,101
- Sit down, Judith.

752
00:35:38,101 --> 00:35:38,929
- Eh?

753
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:39,999
- I said sit down.

754
00:35:39,999 --> 00:35:41,725
- Why, I'm not tired.

755
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:43,348
You sit down if your
feet are troubling you.

756
00:35:43,348 --> 00:35:44,556
- No, I can stand up.

757
00:35:45,626 --> 00:35:47,490
- Well, where's the mistress?

758
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:49,077
- You'd better prepare
yourself for a shock.

759
00:35:49,077 --> 00:35:50,078
She's had an accident.

760
00:35:50,078 --> 00:35:51,632
- Accident, how?

761
00:35:51,632 --> 00:35:53,151
- We don't quite know.
You don't have to try

762
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,462
and break it gently.

763
00:35:54,462 --> 00:35:57,569
You mean she's dead, don't you?

764
00:35:57,569 --> 00:35:58,915
Yes, she's been murdered.

765
00:36:06,405 --> 00:36:08,442
- You forgot the sandwiches.

766
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:11,514
That's her, the
woman in the window.

767
00:36:11,514 --> 00:36:12,377
Who is she?

768
00:36:12,377 --> 00:36:13,516
- I'm Miss Gale.

769
00:36:13,516 --> 00:36:14,965
Who are you?
- This is Mrs. Dax.

770
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:16,415
Now, there is no...
- That'll do, Feathers!

771
00:36:16,415 --> 00:36:17,313
- Yes, sir.

772
00:36:18,486 --> 00:36:21,524
- Well, shall we
have some coffee?

773
00:36:21,524 --> 00:36:22,663
- Not for me.

774
00:36:22,663 --> 00:36:24,423
- She doesn't hold with it.

775
00:36:24,423 --> 00:36:26,114
- Feathers, darling.

776
00:36:27,461 --> 00:36:30,636
- Uh-oh, you're undermining
discipline, Katie.

777
00:36:30,636 --> 00:36:31,913
- Don't be so silly.

778
00:36:31,913 --> 00:36:32,914
Of course, he can
have some coffee.

779
00:36:32,914 --> 00:36:34,433
Can't he, Inspector?

780
00:36:34,433 --> 00:36:37,195
- Take it, man, and
stop all this chitchat.

781
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,644
- Well, if you insist, sir.

782
00:36:38,644 --> 00:36:39,473
Thank you.

783
00:36:41,026 --> 00:36:42,786
- Now, Judith, a few questions.

784
00:36:42,786 --> 00:36:44,926
Did Miss Tulip seem
at all strange lately?

785
00:36:44,926 --> 00:36:48,033
- Not more than usual
except for her tantrums.

786
00:36:48,033 --> 00:36:50,449
I'm not really surprised
she got herself murdered.

787
00:36:50,449 --> 00:36:52,244
I'm saying that
it was her nerves.

788
00:36:52,244 --> 00:36:53,314
- She wasn't strong then?

789
00:36:53,314 --> 00:36:54,419
- Strong, hah.

790
00:36:54,419 --> 00:36:56,421
She was as strong as a horse.

791
00:36:56,421 --> 00:36:59,355
No, it was that doctor
always hanging around

792
00:36:59,355 --> 00:37:01,219
and dosing her up with medicine.

793
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,461
- Sandwich, sir?

794
00:37:02,461 --> 00:37:06,362
- Yes, thank you.

795
00:37:06,362 --> 00:37:08,536
Care for another?

796
00:37:08,536 --> 00:37:12,402
- Nerves, indigestion was
the only trouble with her.

797
00:37:12,402 --> 00:37:14,715
She ate too much and too fast.

798
00:37:14,715 --> 00:37:17,787
All she needed was a good
dose of bicarb of soda.

799
00:37:17,787 --> 00:37:19,789
Told her so, and him too.

800
00:37:20,721 --> 00:37:22,930
I don't hold with doctors.

801
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:24,069
- Good morning, good morning.

802
00:37:24,069 --> 00:37:25,760
Sorry to be so long.

803
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,486
Such a fat bouncing boy,

804
00:37:27,486 --> 00:37:28,763
Mrs. Capes, you know.

805
00:37:28,763 --> 00:37:30,420
Thought at one time
I'd lost the father.

806
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,284
Nervy type.

807
00:37:32,284 --> 00:37:34,286
Well, Inspector, what
have you got for us today?

808
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:35,253
Not another road
accident, I hope.

809
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,393
- No, worse than that, Doctor.

810
00:37:37,393 --> 00:37:38,256
Over here.

811
00:37:42,087 --> 00:37:43,364
- Millicent!

812
00:37:43,364 --> 00:37:44,503
It's Millicent!

813
00:37:44,503 --> 00:37:45,297
When did this
terrible thing happen?

814
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:46,919
What's she doing here?

815
00:37:46,919 --> 00:37:49,197
- I'm sorry to give you a
shock, Willis, I didn't know.

816
00:37:49,197 --> 00:37:50,544
- Don't you pretend
you're sorry.

817
00:37:50,544 --> 00:37:51,786
- Judith Gale, what
are you doing here?

818
00:37:51,786 --> 00:37:53,754
- I have as much
right here as you.

819
00:37:53,754 --> 00:37:55,238
More, I wanted to help her.

820
00:37:55,238 --> 00:37:57,551
- Help her, you know you
always hated your mistress.

821
00:37:57,551 --> 00:37:59,794
- I wasn't always trying
to borrow money from her.

822
00:37:59,794 --> 00:38:01,831
- How dare you.
- That's enough!

823
00:38:01,831 --> 00:38:03,695
We'll go into all this later on.

824
00:38:03,695 --> 00:38:05,110
Meanwhile, I want
your medical report.

825
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,629
You can also identify the body.

826
00:38:07,561 --> 00:38:09,079
- Yes, of course, I'm sorry.

827
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:11,012
- Oh, Inspector.

828
00:38:11,012 --> 00:38:12,600
I'd be obliged if you'd
let me go upstairs

829
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,326
and finish my dressing.

830
00:38:14,326 --> 00:38:16,466
Feathers here seemed to
prefer me in my shirtsleeves,

831
00:38:16,466 --> 00:38:18,503
but it's really
getting very drafty.

832
00:38:18,503 --> 00:38:19,952
- He wanted to get
his coat earlier, sir.

833
00:38:19,952 --> 00:38:21,644
I thought he'd better wait
till you'd been over the house.

834
00:38:21,644 --> 00:38:22,817
- You were quite right.

835
00:38:22,817 --> 00:38:23,646
- Thank you, sir.

836
00:38:23,646 --> 00:38:24,785
- For once.

837
00:38:24,785 --> 00:38:25,613
Go and get it for him.

838
00:38:25,613 --> 00:38:26,890
Know the room?

839
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:27,926
- No, sir.

840
00:38:27,926 --> 00:38:28,961
- First on the left.

841
00:38:28,961 --> 00:38:30,204
It's a gray tweed.

842
00:38:30,204 --> 00:38:32,620
I dropped it when I
heard my wife scream.

843
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,553
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

844
00:38:36,279 --> 00:38:38,902
- I suppose it
couldn't be suicide.

845
00:38:38,902 --> 00:38:40,041
- Impossible.

846
00:38:40,041 --> 00:38:41,111
- What about the gun?

847
00:38:42,389 --> 00:38:43,251
- What do you mean?

848
00:38:43,251 --> 00:38:44,391
- What type and caliber?

849
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:47,186
- We'll have to
remove the bullet

850
00:38:47,186 --> 00:38:48,567
before we can discover that.

851
00:38:49,637 --> 00:38:51,501
Where are her rings?

852
00:38:51,501 --> 00:38:52,985
- Rings?
- Yes.

853
00:38:52,985 --> 00:38:55,125
Her fingers were always
covered with them.

854
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:56,230
Valuable too.

855
00:38:57,127 --> 00:38:58,163
- Are these the ones?

856
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:01,166
- That's them.
- No doubt about it.

857
00:39:01,166 --> 00:39:02,547
- Where did you get those?

858
00:39:02,547 --> 00:39:04,100
- On the floor,
by Mr. Dax's coat.

859
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,895
- Can you explain this?
- Yes, I can.

860
00:39:05,895 --> 00:39:07,172
- I'm not talking to you!

861
00:39:08,276 --> 00:39:09,519
- It's quite simple.

862
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:11,279
- I'm sure it is.

863
00:39:11,279 --> 00:39:14,800
I understand now why you were
so anxious to get your coat.

864
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,526
You know, Mr. Dax,
this puts rather

865
00:39:16,526 --> 00:39:18,494
a different
complexion on things.

866
00:39:18,494 --> 00:39:19,598
- Does it?

867
00:39:19,598 --> 00:39:21,048
Might I ask one question?

868
00:39:21,048 --> 00:39:22,843
- Is it important?
- Yes, very.

869
00:39:22,843 --> 00:39:23,947
- Oh, go ahead.

870
00:39:23,947 --> 00:39:25,224
- May I put my coat on?

871
00:39:27,088 --> 00:39:28,538
- Certainly, Mr. Dax.

872
00:39:28,538 --> 00:39:29,815
I wouldn't like to take you down

873
00:39:29,815 --> 00:39:31,576
to the station in
your shirtsleeves.

874
00:39:31,576 --> 00:39:33,301
- This is ridiculous!

875
00:39:33,301 --> 00:39:35,856
Why, Miss Tulip
gave him the rings.

876
00:39:35,856 --> 00:39:37,236
- On half an hour's
acquaintance?

877
00:39:37,236 --> 00:39:39,515
- Yes, I know it sounds absurd,

878
00:39:39,515 --> 00:39:41,551
but then the whole
thing was crazy.

879
00:39:41,551 --> 00:39:43,001
- Certainly was.

880
00:39:43,001 --> 00:39:45,590
She just barged in here
demanding all sorts of things.

881
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,868
And rambled on about
anonymous letters.

882
00:39:47,868 --> 00:39:49,594
- Anonymous letters?
Yes.

883
00:39:49,594 --> 00:39:51,078
She said she'd had some
threatening letters,

884
00:39:51,078 --> 00:39:54,150
and for a time seemed to
think that I'd written them.

885
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:56,704
- Did she, why?

886
00:39:56,704 --> 00:39:58,775
- Well, how should I know?

887
00:39:58,775 --> 00:40:01,709
- You know, there's something
familiar about this story.

888
00:40:01,709 --> 00:40:03,090
It's rather like one
of your books, Mr. Dax.

889
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:04,988
- Oh, thank you.

890
00:40:04,988 --> 00:40:07,439
But I can assure you I've
not been imagining things.

891
00:40:07,439 --> 00:40:10,925
Although, Miss Tulip's
whole behavior was unreal.

892
00:40:10,925 --> 00:40:13,480
Asking Kate to lock her
rings up and giving me the.

893
00:40:14,929 --> 00:40:16,586
- Giving you the what?

894
00:40:16,586 --> 00:40:18,174
- Don't tell him, Andrew.

895
00:40:18,174 --> 00:40:20,590
He hasn't even thanked
you for finding her rings.

896
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,937
- But I'm sure he was
very grateful, darling.

897
00:40:22,937 --> 00:40:26,044
- I'm still waiting to hear
what else Miss Tulip gave you.

898
00:40:26,044 --> 00:40:30,324
- Nothing very much, just a gun.

899
00:40:30,324 --> 00:40:31,429
- A gun!

900
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,740
Where is it?

901
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:35,053
- I can't remember
where I put it.

902
00:40:35,053 --> 00:40:36,606
I chucked it
somewhere around here.

903
00:40:36,606 --> 00:40:37,642
- Was it loaded?

904
00:40:37,642 --> 00:40:38,608
- Why, I didn't look.

905
00:40:38,608 --> 00:40:40,438
- Well, suppose you saw it now?

906
00:40:42,785 --> 00:40:44,683
- You know, I'm
not sure my union

907
00:40:44,683 --> 00:40:46,478
allows me to do the
work of the police.

908
00:40:46,478 --> 00:40:49,170
- Does your union allow you
to be arrested for murder?

909
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,552
- I never asked them.

910
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,624
You didn't see it
in the bedroom, sir?

911
00:40:54,624 --> 00:40:56,143
- No, sir.
- Oh, pity.

912
00:40:57,144 --> 00:40:59,180
Hmm, now let me think.

913
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,941
Oh, wait a minute though.

914
00:41:07,188 --> 00:41:08,604
- Thank you, Mr. Dax.

915
00:41:08,604 --> 00:41:10,502
- Oh, don't mention it.

916
00:41:12,055 --> 00:41:14,437
- Hmm, one shot fired.

917
00:41:14,437 --> 00:41:16,888
Doctor, could that be it?

918
00:41:17,992 --> 00:41:20,926
- I'm not the ballistics
expert, you know.

919
00:41:20,926 --> 00:41:22,480
And also I'd like to say is that

920
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,034
there's no reason why this
should not be the weapon.

921
00:41:25,034 --> 00:41:26,484
- Thank you, Doctor.

922
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,037
Mr. Dax, you any objection

923
00:41:28,037 --> 00:41:29,763
to having your
fingerprints taken?

924
00:41:29,763 --> 00:41:31,937
- No, not at all, if it'll help.

925
00:41:31,937 --> 00:41:33,732
- You'll have to have mine too.

926
00:41:33,732 --> 00:41:36,355
- Why, did you handle
the gun as well?

927
00:41:36,355 --> 00:41:38,944
- No, but if you're
taking Andrew's,

928
00:41:38,944 --> 00:41:40,601
then you might as
well take mine.

929
00:41:40,601 --> 00:41:42,500
After all, I am his wife.

930
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,502
- All right, Sergeant,
we'll have them all down.

931
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,710
You can take a cab over, Willis?

932
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:48,057
- Certainly, can't
do anything more now.

933
00:41:48,057 --> 00:41:51,509
Simple case, cause of
death, cerebral hemorrhage,

934
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,994
occasioned by a lesion
of the frontal lobe.

935
00:41:55,202 --> 00:41:56,583
- I thought you
said she was shot?

936
00:41:56,583 --> 00:41:57,998
- Same thing, darling.

937
00:41:57,998 --> 00:42:00,172
- Well, then why not say so?

938
00:42:00,172 --> 00:42:01,657
I'm gonna get my coat.

939
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,490
Mr. Dax.

940
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,907
- Don't worry, I'm not escaping.

941
00:42:17,224 --> 00:42:18,812
Archie.

942
00:42:18,812 --> 00:42:20,538
Archie, where are you?

943
00:42:21,608 --> 00:42:23,610
Archie.

944
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:25,128
Archie, come on.

945
00:42:25,128 --> 00:42:25,922
Come on.

946
00:42:30,375 --> 00:42:31,203
Archie.

947
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,378
What is it?

948
00:42:40,627 --> 00:42:42,076
T.

949
00:42:42,076 --> 00:42:42,905
Miss Tulip.

950
00:42:44,285 --> 00:42:45,424
- Thank you, Mr. Dax.

951
00:42:45,424 --> 00:42:46,943
Where did you get this?

952
00:42:46,943 --> 00:42:47,910
- Well, just there.

953
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:48,842
- You didn't drop it?

954
00:42:48,842 --> 00:42:50,084
- No, I didn't.

955
00:42:50,084 --> 00:42:51,776
And look, someone's
been lying here.

956
00:42:51,776 --> 00:42:53,640
- Probably you, Mr. Dax.

957
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,882
- Very funny.

958
00:42:54,882 --> 00:42:56,677
The ground, man, use your eyes.

959
00:42:56,677 --> 00:42:58,368
That accounts for us
not hearing anything.

960
00:42:58,368 --> 00:42:59,956
And the French
windows being open.

961
00:42:59,956 --> 00:43:01,855
She was shot here
and left lying,

962
00:43:01,855 --> 00:43:03,581
while the murderer went to
see if the coast was clear.

963
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,548
- But changed her mind
and walked into the house.

964
00:43:05,548 --> 00:43:07,377
- Now that's impossible.

965
00:43:07,377 --> 00:43:08,309
- Don't be stupid.

966
00:43:08,309 --> 00:43:09,379
Of course, it's impossible.

967
00:43:09,379 --> 00:43:10,588
- No, I didn't mean that at all.

968
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:11,554
I meant, if she'd
been lying out there...

969
00:43:11,554 --> 00:43:12,486
- I don't care what you meant.

970
00:43:12,486 --> 00:43:14,522
I meant you to keep quiet.

971
00:43:14,522 --> 00:43:15,800
- Very good, sir.

972
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,699
- And stop messing about
with that honeysuckle.

973
00:43:18,699 --> 00:43:20,390
- Wisteria.
- What's that?

974
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:22,841
- It isn't honeysuckle,
it's wisteria.

975
00:43:22,841 --> 00:43:25,844
- Be careful, Feathers,
be very careful.

976
00:43:25,844 --> 00:43:26,845
- I will, sir, I
never make a mistake

977
00:43:26,845 --> 00:43:28,122
about the names of plants.

978
00:43:28,122 --> 00:43:29,917
Now this particular plant...
- Feathers!

979
00:43:29,917 --> 00:43:31,091
Go and get the others ready.

980
00:43:31,091 --> 00:43:34,577
- Very good, sir.
- Fingerprints, Mr. Dax?

981
00:43:38,236 --> 00:43:40,825
- Andrew, what a funny
little finger you've got.

982
00:43:41,757 --> 00:43:43,172
Would you like mine now?

983
00:43:43,172 --> 00:43:45,036
- No, Ma'am, the Inspector
will see to that,

984
00:43:45,036 --> 00:43:46,451
if it proves necessary.

985
00:43:46,451 --> 00:43:48,626
- Well, I think it is necessary.

986
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:51,767
After all, we're both in
this thing up to our necks.

987
00:43:51,767 --> 00:43:53,423
- Darling, don't
say such things.

988
00:43:57,462 --> 00:43:59,878
- Could you say what time
Miss Tulip went out or why?

989
00:43:59,878 --> 00:44:02,881
- No, and that's how I
know she wasn't herself.

990
00:44:02,881 --> 00:44:05,677
I've been her only
friend for years.

991
00:44:05,677 --> 00:44:07,645
And if the doctor says
anything to the contrary,

992
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:08,887
he's a liar.

993
00:44:08,887 --> 00:44:10,302
- You don't like
Dr Willis, do you?

994
00:44:10,302 --> 00:44:12,788
- Like him, nasty, crawly toad.

995
00:44:12,788 --> 00:44:15,169
Always getting around her,
making out she was ill

996
00:44:15,169 --> 00:44:16,688
and giving her medicine.

997
00:44:16,688 --> 00:44:18,034
- According to Mr. and Mrs. Dax,

998
00:44:18,034 --> 00:44:19,795
she'd been receiving
threatening letters.

999
00:44:19,795 --> 00:44:21,348
- Never, or I'd have known.

1000
00:44:21,348 --> 00:44:22,798
I always open the post.

1001
00:44:22,798 --> 00:44:25,801
Nothing, but bills
mostly from the doctor.

1002
00:44:25,801 --> 00:44:28,873
If anyone was after
her money, it was him.

1003
00:44:28,873 --> 00:44:30,253
- Mr. Dax says that Miss Tulip

1004
00:44:30,253 --> 00:44:31,669
gave him a gun to protect her.

1005
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,532
Do you know if she had a gun?

1006
00:44:33,532 --> 00:44:35,534
- She had a gun all right.

1007
00:44:35,534 --> 00:44:37,088
But it was the doctor's.

1008
00:44:37,088 --> 00:44:39,228
- The doctor's?
- Yes.

1009
00:44:39,228 --> 00:44:41,264
I heard him say, that
he'd be much happier

1010
00:44:41,264 --> 00:44:43,128
if she had something to
protect herself with.

1011
00:44:43,128 --> 00:44:46,269
And then I saw him take
something out of his bag.

1012
00:44:46,269 --> 00:44:47,270
- What else did he say?

1013
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:49,652
- What?
- What else did he say?

1014
00:44:49,652 --> 00:44:51,654
I don't know he saw
me standing outside,

1015
00:44:51,654 --> 00:44:53,242
and he shut the door in my face.

1016
00:44:54,415 --> 00:44:58,765
Come in.

1017
00:44:58,765 --> 00:45:00,318
- The prints will be
ready in 10 minutes, sir.

1018
00:45:00,318 --> 00:45:01,802
- All right, thank you.

1019
00:45:01,802 --> 00:45:03,286
- That's it.

1020
00:45:03,286 --> 00:45:05,875
Fancy giving a thing like
that to the poor dear.

1021
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:07,187
Nasty, vicious thing.

1022
00:45:07,187 --> 00:45:08,533
If you want to
know who done that.

1023
00:45:08,533 --> 00:45:09,672
- All right, all right.

1024
00:45:09,672 --> 00:45:10,777
Take Miss Judith out, will you?

1025
00:45:10,777 --> 00:45:12,123
And bring in Mr. and Mrs. Dax.

1026
00:45:12,123 --> 00:45:12,951
- Yes, sir.

1027
00:45:18,025 --> 00:45:20,510
- Get Dr Willis on
the line, will you?

1028
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:21,304
Oh, hello.

1029
00:45:21,304 --> 00:45:23,237
Ordeal over, Mr. Dax?

1030
00:45:23,237 --> 00:45:24,618
I do hope they didn't hurt you.

1031
00:45:24,618 --> 00:45:27,379
- Not at all, it's a
pleasure to be fingerprinted.

1032
00:45:27,379 --> 00:45:29,796
Makes you feel one of
the family, so to speak.

1033
00:45:29,796 --> 00:45:31,798
- Then perhaps you'll take
one of the family chairs.

1034
00:45:31,798 --> 00:45:32,626
- Thank you.

1035
00:45:35,111 --> 00:45:38,977
- Now, whose idea was it to
come down to Wood Cottage?

1036
00:45:38,977 --> 00:45:40,220
- Oh, mine.

1037
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:42,705
You see, Andrew had got
behind in his new book

1038
00:45:42,705 --> 00:45:46,709
and Philip, that's
our publisher, was
getting very worried.

1039
00:45:46,709 --> 00:45:49,022
You see, they have
to stick to dates.

1040
00:45:49,022 --> 00:45:50,195
And Andrew never will.

1041
00:45:50,195 --> 00:45:51,438
Oh, nonsense.

1042
00:45:51,438 --> 00:45:53,854
- It's no good saying
nonsense, darling.

1043
00:45:53,854 --> 00:45:55,200
You know, you
promised to deliver

1044
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,650
before you went to America

1045
00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:59,377
when you had that
500 pound advance.

1046
00:45:59,377 --> 00:46:01,759
- Oh, you had a
500 pound advance?

1047
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:02,967
- Yes.
- And you still

1048
00:46:02,967 --> 00:46:04,071
haven't finished the book?

1049
00:46:04,071 --> 00:46:05,486
No.

1050
00:46:05,486 --> 00:46:06,833
- And you're being
pressed by your publisher.

1051
00:46:06,833 --> 00:46:08,455
- Being pressed?

1052
00:46:08,455 --> 00:46:12,183
Look, Inspector, publishers
are mean and grasping people.

1053
00:46:12,183 --> 00:46:15,151
So, if I don't get in
first and plead poverty

1054
00:46:15,151 --> 00:46:18,292
and lack of
inspiration, I get done.

1055
00:46:18,292 --> 00:46:19,431
- Now just a minute.

1056
00:46:19,431 --> 00:46:21,123
Let's stick to facts.

1057
00:46:21,123 --> 00:46:23,228
You owe your
publisher 500 pounds,

1058
00:46:23,228 --> 00:46:25,403
and he's asking you to repay it.

1059
00:46:25,403 --> 00:46:27,681
- Repay Philip don't be silly.

1060
00:46:27,681 --> 00:46:29,303
- What a crazy idea.

1061
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:34,792
- Hello.

1062
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,690
Yes, put him through.

1063
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:37,518
Hello, Doctor.

1064
00:46:37,518 --> 00:46:39,141
Yes, I'm glad you rang.

1065
00:46:39,141 --> 00:46:41,315
I wanted your report
on the time of death.

1066
00:46:42,247 --> 00:46:45,078
Not before 10 and not after 12.

1067
00:46:45,078 --> 00:46:46,734
You're quite
definite about that?

1068
00:46:47,908 --> 00:46:50,635
The revolver Miss Judith
said it belonged to you.

1069
00:46:52,016 --> 00:46:54,121
Well, I'd like it cleared up.

1070
00:46:54,121 --> 00:46:55,398
Yes, I know she is.

1071
00:46:56,434 --> 00:46:58,436
Oh, Miss Tulip's solicitors,

1072
00:46:58,436 --> 00:47:00,162
Burton and Travers
on the High Street.

1073
00:47:01,784 --> 00:47:03,199
- Was that Dr Willis?

1074
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:04,683
- Yes, why?

1075
00:47:04,683 --> 00:47:08,377
- Saying that death
occurred between 10 and 12?

1076
00:47:08,377 --> 00:47:09,896
- But, that's ridiculous.

1077
00:47:09,896 --> 00:47:12,450
- And your story is
ridiculous too, Mrs. Dax.

1078
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:14,176
According to you, Miss
Tulip was frightened.

1079
00:47:14,176 --> 00:47:15,418
Yet, she appealed to you,

1080
00:47:15,418 --> 00:47:17,110
perfect strangers,
for protection.

1081
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:18,387
She spoke of
threatening letters,

1082
00:47:18,387 --> 00:47:20,389
which Judith said she never had.

1083
00:47:20,389 --> 00:47:21,873
Your husband's being
pressed for money.

1084
00:47:21,873 --> 00:47:24,324
Yet, she gave you jewelry to
put in a nonexistent safe.

1085
00:47:24,324 --> 00:47:26,740
And she gave you the
gun to shoot her with.

1086
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:29,708
I have enough ridiculous
facts to arrest you both.

1087
00:47:29,708 --> 00:47:31,193
- Then why don't you, Inspector?

1088
00:47:31,193 --> 00:47:32,677
- Perhaps I'm waiting
for the big build-up

1089
00:47:32,677 --> 00:47:34,334
in the last chapter, Mr. Dax.

1090
00:47:34,334 --> 00:47:37,061
- Or perhaps, it's all just a
little too easy and obvious,

1091
00:47:37,061 --> 00:47:39,649
and you don't wanna make
too big a fool of yourself.

1092
00:47:42,204 --> 00:47:44,309
- Take Mr. and Mrs. Dax
back to Wood Cottage.

1093
00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:45,759
Yes, sir.

1094
00:47:45,759 --> 00:47:47,071
- And stop at Burton and
Travers Solicitors on the way.

1095
00:47:47,071 --> 00:47:48,589
- What for?

1096
00:47:48,589 --> 00:47:51,730
- I want a little legal
advice, any objection?

1097
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:53,215
- You surprise me.

1098
00:47:53,215 --> 00:47:54,630
I shouldn't have thought you
wanted advice from anyone.

1099
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:55,838
- Which only goes to prove,

1100
00:47:55,838 --> 00:47:58,220
that sometimes even the
police can be wrong.

1101
00:47:58,220 --> 00:47:59,152
Goodbye, Inspector.

1102
00:48:04,674 --> 00:48:07,160
- Get me Constable
Feathers at Wood Cottage.

1103
00:48:13,269 --> 00:48:15,685
- 215 Feathers speaking.

1104
00:48:15,685 --> 00:48:16,652
Mr. Thorne.

1105
00:48:18,171 --> 00:48:19,827
The body's been removed.

1106
00:48:19,827 --> 00:48:20,828
Everything's in order.

1107
00:48:20,828 --> 00:48:23,107
And I'm just about to leave.

1108
00:48:23,107 --> 00:48:24,867
You'll do
nothing of the kind.

1109
00:48:24,867 --> 00:48:26,110
Stay where you are.

1110
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:27,974
- Could you speak a
little louder, sir.

1111
00:48:27,974 --> 00:48:29,251
I can't quite hear you.

1112
00:48:29,251 --> 00:48:31,494
- Don't let Mr. Dax
out of your sights.

1113
00:48:31,494 --> 00:48:32,910
Keep a close watch on him.

1114
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,152
- Inside or out?

1115
00:48:34,152 --> 00:48:36,465
- That depends on how
tactful you can be.

1116
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:39,917
- You can leave that to me, sir.

1117
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:42,126
- And, Feathers,
watch your step.

1118
00:48:42,126 --> 00:48:43,334
We don't want another corpse

1119
00:48:43,334 --> 00:48:44,991
on our hands at
Wood Cottage, do we?

1120
00:48:46,475 --> 00:48:47,890
- I can't say I'm very keen.

1121
00:48:55,898 --> 00:48:57,831
- I don't know that I can
give you the information.

1122
00:48:57,831 --> 00:48:59,798
- Look, Mr. Burton,
we only want to know

1123
00:48:59,798 --> 00:49:01,662
if either Dr Willis or Miss Gale

1124
00:49:01,662 --> 00:49:02,974
are mentioned in the will.

1125
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,287
- No.

1126
00:49:05,287 --> 00:49:06,219
No?

1127
00:49:06,219 --> 00:49:08,255
- Because there is no will.

1128
00:49:08,255 --> 00:49:11,258
They were mentioned in some
draft she drew up sometime ago,

1129
00:49:11,258 --> 00:49:13,226
but Miss Tulip kept
changing her mind

1130
00:49:13,226 --> 00:49:15,297
right up till a week or so ago.

1131
00:49:15,297 --> 00:49:17,506
She was coming to see
me but she never came,

1132
00:49:17,506 --> 00:49:19,646
so, she died intestate.

1133
00:49:19,646 --> 00:49:21,061
- Intestate?

1134
00:49:21,061 --> 00:49:22,890
Well, then who inherits?

1135
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:24,064
- No one.

1136
00:49:24,064 --> 00:49:26,929
- But surely she must
have some family?

1137
00:49:26,929 --> 00:49:29,794
- Miss Tulip was the
last of a very long line.

1138
00:49:29,794 --> 00:49:32,245
She and her sister Angela
were the only children.

1139
00:49:32,245 --> 00:49:34,592
- Well, what happened to Angela?

1140
00:49:34,592 --> 00:49:35,834
- She went to Australia.

1141
00:49:35,834 --> 00:49:38,044
- Australia the missing heir.

1142
00:49:39,183 --> 00:49:41,392
- She had disgraced her family,

1143
00:49:41,392 --> 00:49:43,842
run off with some
young profligate.

1144
00:49:43,842 --> 00:49:45,983
Her father was devoted to her.

1145
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,330
It took him many
years to forgive her.

1146
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:50,159
And when he did,
it was too late.

1147
00:49:51,126 --> 00:49:51,989
She was dead.

1148
00:49:52,886 --> 00:49:54,819
The blow killed the old man.

1149
00:49:54,819 --> 00:49:56,752
And Miss Millicent
was left alone,

1150
00:49:56,752 --> 00:49:59,341
sole heir to the Tulip fortune.

1151
00:49:59,341 --> 00:50:01,515
- Then there still
maybe some heir.

1152
00:50:01,515 --> 00:50:04,035
Don't you see, if
Angela had a baby.

1153
00:50:04,035 --> 00:50:06,279
- There would still
be no legal heir.

1154
00:50:06,279 --> 00:50:09,592
The man Angela eloped
with deserted her

1155
00:50:09,592 --> 00:50:12,457
without implementing
his promise of marriage.

1156
00:50:12,457 --> 00:50:14,045
- Ditched her, did he?

1157
00:50:14,045 --> 00:50:15,219
- You men.

1158
00:50:36,654 --> 00:50:38,311
- Feathers, they've got him too.

1159
00:50:38,311 --> 00:50:39,726
- Oh, no.

1160
00:50:43,488 --> 00:50:44,938
- What are you doing here?

1161
00:50:49,977 --> 00:50:51,255
- A matter of duty, sir.

1162
00:50:51,255 --> 00:50:53,050
- Well, am I to take it
that we're under arrest?

1163
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,603
- Oh, no, sir.

1164
00:50:54,603 --> 00:50:56,777
- Then may I ask just what
you're doing in my house?

1165
00:50:56,777 --> 00:50:58,538
Well, you see

1166
00:50:58,538 --> 00:51:01,368
the Inspector said.
- Yes, Feathers.

1167
00:51:02,507 --> 00:51:04,716
Well, I can't tell
you it's confidential.

1168
00:51:04,716 --> 00:51:06,063
- Then let me guess.

1169
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,995
Your orders are to
see that I don't,

1170
00:51:07,995 --> 00:51:09,721
to put it vulgarly, do a bunk.

1171
00:51:09,721 --> 00:51:11,033
- Exactly.

1172
00:51:11,033 --> 00:51:12,655
Well, no, not exactly.

1173
00:51:12,655 --> 00:51:14,347
In a manner of speaking,
you see, the Inspector said.

1174
00:51:14,347 --> 00:51:15,555
- To blazes with the Inspector!

1175
00:51:15,555 --> 00:51:17,039
- Yes, sir, no, sir.

1176
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:19,006
- Well, make up your mind.

1177
00:51:19,006 --> 00:51:20,629
- Yes, sir.

1178
00:51:20,629 --> 00:51:22,009
- Feathers, you know
as well as I do,

1179
00:51:22,009 --> 00:51:24,011
the police have no right
to infest my premises.

1180
00:51:24,011 --> 00:51:25,392
- Infest?

1181
00:51:25,392 --> 00:51:27,118
- The word was chosen with care.

1182
00:51:27,118 --> 00:51:29,086
- I'm sorry, sir, but
my instructions are...

1183
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:31,157
- To make sure that
I don't vamoose.

1184
00:51:31,157 --> 00:51:33,849
Feathers, the whole of the
outside world is yours.

1185
00:51:33,849 --> 00:51:36,093
- It's a bit chilly
outside, sir.

1186
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,129
- Yes, isn't it?

1187
00:51:38,129 --> 00:51:39,993
I wish you a hearty good day.

1188
00:51:39,993 --> 00:51:40,821
- Thank you, sir.

1189
00:51:40,821 --> 00:51:42,306
- Oh, Andrew.

1190
00:51:42,306 --> 00:51:45,447
How can you turn poor Mr.
Feathers out into the cold?

1191
00:51:45,447 --> 00:51:47,552
Think how you'd feel
if he got pneumonia.

1192
00:51:47,552 --> 00:51:49,382
- I know, how I'd feel.

1193
00:51:49,382 --> 00:51:51,108
Oh, but then I suppose,
they'd save him.

1194
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:53,386
- Now, you're being very unkind.

1195
00:51:53,386 --> 00:51:54,904
I think, he's nice.

1196
00:51:54,904 --> 00:51:57,217
Look, how he helped me with
the coffee this morning.

1197
00:51:57,217 --> 00:52:00,427
I'm sure if we let him stay,
he'd do the same again.

1198
00:52:00,427 --> 00:52:01,704
There's so much to do.

1199
00:52:01,704 --> 00:52:04,707
There's the carpet and
stairs to be swept,

1200
00:52:04,707 --> 00:52:07,124
and the grate to be cleaned
and all the dusting.

1201
00:52:08,608 --> 00:52:10,679
- Well, I don't think
I could very well

1202
00:52:10,679 --> 00:52:12,681
do anything like that,
you see, I'm on duty.

1203
00:52:12,681 --> 00:52:14,752
- I should have thought
that it was your duty

1204
00:52:14,752 --> 00:52:16,512
to give us a hand.

1205
00:52:16,512 --> 00:52:19,412
Then, of course, if you
don't like us enough then.

1206
00:52:19,412 --> 00:52:23,140
- Well, if you put it like
that, lady, I suppose.

1207
00:53:04,146 --> 00:53:05,699
- Kate, I'm worried.

1208
00:53:05,699 --> 00:53:08,909
Feathers must've had orders
to stay here at all costs.

1209
00:53:08,909 --> 00:53:10,221
Otherwise, he'd have
never allowed himself

1210
00:53:10,221 --> 00:53:12,430
to be turned into a housemaid.

1211
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:13,707
- Of course, he would.

1212
00:53:13,707 --> 00:53:15,157
He's very nice.

1213
00:53:15,157 --> 00:53:16,503
- Well, that's not the point.

1214
00:53:16,503 --> 00:53:18,333
The Inspector must
seriously believe

1215
00:53:18,333 --> 00:53:19,679
that I killed Miss Tulip.

1216
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:21,405
- But we know you didn't.

1217
00:53:21,405 --> 00:53:23,234
- Well, that's not gonna be
much comfort if I'm hanged.

1218
00:53:23,234 --> 00:53:26,030
- Well, hanging was never
meant to be very comfortable.

1219
00:53:27,618 --> 00:53:30,207
Andrew, don't talk like that.

1220
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:31,587
- Well, it's happened before.

1221
00:53:31,587 --> 00:53:33,210
- We must do something.

1222
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,763
- Yes, but what?

1223
00:53:34,763 --> 00:53:37,006
I have an idea floating around
at the back of my brain.

1224
00:53:37,006 --> 00:53:39,423
But, well, it just won't gel.

1225
00:53:39,423 --> 00:53:40,631
Don't turn that on.

1226
00:53:40,631 --> 00:53:42,219
Otherwise, we shall be drowned.

1227
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:43,392
Anyway, I'm doing the washing.

1228
00:53:43,392 --> 00:53:45,049
- Oh, all right.

1229
00:53:45,049 --> 00:53:45,877
- Don't use that cloth.

1230
00:53:45,877 --> 00:53:47,396
- Why not?

1231
00:53:47,396 --> 00:53:49,122
- Well, because Mrs. Jones
left it outside yesterday

1232
00:53:49,122 --> 00:53:50,330
and it got soaked.

1233
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:51,883
There's a clean
one in the drawer.

1234
00:53:51,883 --> 00:53:54,610
- The rain, of
course, that's right.

1235
00:53:54,610 --> 00:53:57,924
It was raining yesterday
and last night.

1236
00:53:57,924 --> 00:53:59,097
Kate, I've got it.

1237
00:53:59,097 --> 00:54:00,547
- Got what?

1238
00:54:00,547 --> 00:54:02,273
- The answer to the riddle
it's all clicking into place.

1239
00:54:02,273 --> 00:54:04,102
I may be wrong but, Feathers!

1240
00:54:04,102 --> 00:54:05,656
- What you want Feathers for?

1241
00:54:05,656 --> 00:54:07,244
- Feathers.

1242
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,106
Feathers, come here a minute.

1243
00:54:10,177 --> 00:54:12,110
I want you to think
very carefully.

1244
00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:13,491
When you examined the body,

1245
00:54:13,491 --> 00:54:15,666
were the clothes damp or dry?

1246
00:54:15,666 --> 00:54:17,702
- That's just it they were dry.

1247
00:54:17,702 --> 00:54:19,117
That's why she couldn't possibly

1248
00:54:19,117 --> 00:54:20,533
have laid outside
in the shrubbery.

1249
00:54:20,533 --> 00:54:21,775
Not in that storm.

1250
00:54:21,775 --> 00:54:23,018
- Well, then why
didn't you say so?

1251
00:54:23,018 --> 00:54:24,709
- I tried to, but you
know our Inspector.

1252
00:54:24,709 --> 00:54:26,677
Nobody knows anything but him.

1253
00:54:26,677 --> 00:54:27,505
Honeysuckle.

1254
00:54:29,127 --> 00:54:30,681
- Right now there's
only one chance,

1255
00:54:30,681 --> 00:54:32,061
I must get out of here.

1256
00:54:32,061 --> 00:54:33,235
- No, you can't do that, sir.
- Of course, I can.

1257
00:54:33,235 --> 00:54:34,857
- No, no, the Inspector
rang up definite,

1258
00:54:34,857 --> 00:54:37,826
very definite he was not
to let you out of my sight.

1259
00:54:37,826 --> 00:54:39,276
- Come on, Feathers.

1260
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:40,656
- I'm sorry, sir, I'd
liked to help if I could,

1261
00:54:40,656 --> 00:54:42,348
but orders is orders.

1262
00:54:42,348 --> 00:54:45,005
If he hadn't rung up special,
it'd have been different.

1263
00:54:45,005 --> 00:54:46,593
- Help, fellas, quick.

1264
00:54:46,593 --> 00:54:48,181
Do something.

1265
00:54:48,181 --> 00:54:50,148
- All right, ready,
leave it a bit.

1266
00:54:50,148 --> 00:54:52,289
I see the trouble this
tap wants tightening.

1267
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:54,843
That's it, plumbing's
my strong suit.

1268
00:54:56,638 --> 00:54:57,673
Well, it used to be.

1269
00:54:58,881 --> 00:55:01,470
- Do you think we should
turn it off at the main?

1270
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:04,266
- Yes, if you wouldn't
mind, before I get wet.

1271
00:55:05,509 --> 00:55:08,374
- Andrew, you heard
what Mr. Feathers said.

1272
00:55:08,374 --> 00:55:10,099
Go and turn it off at the main.

1273
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:11,238
- Right, darling,

1274
00:55:11,238 --> 00:55:12,999
I won't be very long.

1275
00:55:18,176 --> 00:55:19,523
- Went loose again.

1276
00:55:19,523 --> 00:55:21,318
I'm afraid, you need
to get a new one.

1277
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:24,321
Still, I'll try and fix
it up for you temporary.

1278
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:25,322
Here we are.

1279
00:55:26,599 --> 00:55:27,772
No, we aren't.

1280
00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:33,157
Ever been to Trafalgar Square?

1281
00:55:33,157 --> 00:55:34,641
Like an English
summer, isn't it?

1282
00:55:34,641 --> 00:55:35,815
- Oh, what a shame.

1283
00:55:35,815 --> 00:55:38,576
Your beautiful uniform
getting spoiled.

1284
00:55:38,576 --> 00:55:40,406
I'm sure, if you just.

1285
00:55:50,105 --> 00:55:51,589
- Beginners' luck.

1286
00:55:54,903 --> 00:55:56,836
Now I'm soaked to the skin.

1287
00:55:56,836 --> 00:55:58,734
- Look, why don't you
take your uniform off,

1288
00:55:58,734 --> 00:56:00,253
and we'll dry it in here.

1289
00:56:00,253 --> 00:56:02,289
I'll get you my
husband's dressing gown.

1290
00:56:02,289 --> 00:56:03,843
- Thank you.

1291
00:56:03,843 --> 00:56:05,327
Here, where is he?
- Hmm?

1292
00:56:08,123 --> 00:56:09,366
- There, he's gone.

1293
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:10,332
He's hopped it.

1294
00:56:10,332 --> 00:56:11,989
- I know, but he'll be back.

1295
00:56:11,989 --> 00:56:13,231
- But what about Mr. Thorne?

1296
00:56:13,231 --> 00:56:14,716
- Yeah, well, what
about Andrew's neck?

1297
00:56:14,716 --> 00:56:16,373
- What about my pension?

1298
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:17,201
Phew.

1299
00:56:19,134 --> 00:56:20,066
Get me the police.

1300
00:56:30,732 --> 00:56:32,630
- Have you taken
leave of your senses?

1301
00:56:34,839 --> 00:56:37,117
What do you think this
is, a fancy dress party?

1302
00:56:37,117 --> 00:56:38,049
- Couldn't say, sir.

1303
00:56:38,049 --> 00:56:39,982
- It's all my fault, Inspector.

1304
00:56:39,982 --> 00:56:41,743
You see, the tap went wrong,

1305
00:56:41,743 --> 00:56:43,641
and Mr. Feathers
came to my rescue.

1306
00:56:43,641 --> 00:56:44,953
Only, he got awfully wet,

1307
00:56:44,953 --> 00:56:47,438
so, we're drying his
uniform in the kitchen.

1308
00:56:47,438 --> 00:56:49,233
- And Mr. Dax thinking
everything is in good hands

1309
00:56:49,233 --> 00:56:50,476
just went for a walk.

1310
00:56:50,476 --> 00:56:52,443
- No, Andrew hates walking.

1311
00:56:52,443 --> 00:56:54,100
He took Feathers' bicycle.

1312
00:56:55,273 --> 00:56:56,792
- So, you let him
pinch your bike?

1313
00:56:56,792 --> 00:56:59,139
Surely, Constable, you
should have given it to him.

1314
00:56:59,139 --> 00:57:00,658
- Where are your manners?

1315
00:57:00,658 --> 00:57:02,764
- I was being tactful, sir.

1316
00:57:02,764 --> 00:57:04,179
- Oh, for goodness sake, man
don't stand about like that!

1317
00:57:04,179 --> 00:57:06,492
It makes you look even
sillier than you are already!

1318
00:57:06,492 --> 00:57:07,631
Go and put your uniform on!

1319
00:57:07,631 --> 00:57:08,563
- Well, it's all wet.

1320
00:57:08,563 --> 00:57:10,565
- So, are you go and put it on!

1321
00:57:13,395 --> 00:57:16,122
To be taken in by a
smart aleck like that.

1322
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,955
- What exactly do you mean
by a smart aleck like that?

1323
00:57:21,955 --> 00:57:23,440
- Just what I say, Mrs. Dax.

1324
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,165
Your husband.
- Is not a smart aleck.

1325
00:57:25,165 --> 00:57:28,859
And if you had one grain of
common sense, you'd know it.

1326
00:57:28,859 --> 00:57:30,688
He's gone because he has a clue.

1327
00:57:30,688 --> 00:57:31,689
- That's what he's told you.

1328
00:57:31,689 --> 00:57:33,415
- Don't be so silly.

1329
00:57:33,415 --> 00:57:34,727
Anyone who would
think that you really

1330
00:57:34,727 --> 00:57:36,245
believed Andrew was guilty.

1331
00:57:36,245 --> 00:57:37,454
- And they'd be right.

1332
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,732
I have a warrant for his arrest.

1333
00:57:39,732 --> 00:57:41,147
- But you're mad.

1334
00:57:41,147 --> 00:57:42,355
Give me one good reason,

1335
00:57:42,355 --> 00:57:44,530
why he should want
to murder Miss Tulip?

1336
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:46,497
- I'll give you 10, which
is the number of pieces

1337
00:57:46,497 --> 00:57:48,119
of her jewelry, still missing.

1338
00:57:48,119 --> 00:57:49,051
- That doesn't prove anything.

1339
00:57:49,051 --> 00:57:50,743
- No, but the gun does.

1340
00:57:50,743 --> 00:57:53,228
It only has one clear set
of fingerprints on it.

1341
00:57:53,228 --> 00:57:54,194
Your husband's.

1342
00:57:55,368 --> 00:57:56,300
- But he couldn't
have killed her.

1343
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:58,233
We were together all night.

1344
00:57:58,233 --> 00:57:59,821
All night, Mrs. Dax?

1345
00:57:59,821 --> 00:58:00,753
- Yes.

1346
00:58:00,753 --> 00:58:02,306
- And did you go to sleep?

1347
00:58:02,306 --> 00:58:03,756
- Of course.

1348
00:58:03,756 --> 00:58:05,758
- Then how do you know
your husband was with you.

1349
00:58:05,758 --> 00:58:07,622
- Because the least
noise wakes me up.

1350
00:58:07,622 --> 00:58:10,314
Why, I remember when he came
back with milk and biscuits.

1351
00:58:10,314 --> 00:58:12,178
- When he what, Mrs. Dax?

1352
00:58:14,594 --> 00:58:19,219
- When he went for the milk and
biscuits I woke immediately.

1353
00:58:19,219 --> 00:58:21,498
- I think you said,
"When he came back".

1354
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:23,603
- Oh, no, no, when he went.

1355
00:58:23,603 --> 00:58:26,951
I know I'm right because
I was thirsty too.

1356
00:58:26,951 --> 00:58:29,057
I remember thinking how
lucky it was that Andrew

1357
00:58:29,057 --> 00:58:31,197
was out in the cold and not me.

1358
00:58:31,197 --> 00:58:32,578
- So, he got you some as well.

1359
00:58:32,578 --> 00:58:34,062
- Hm.

1360
00:58:34,062 --> 00:58:35,995
- As well or did you drink
out of the same glass?

1361
00:58:35,995 --> 00:58:38,860
There was only one glass in
your room this morning, dear.

1362
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:40,206
- I don't remember.

1363
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:43,312
Yes, it was the same glass.

1364
00:58:43,312 --> 00:58:44,624
I had a drink from his.

1365
00:58:46,039 --> 00:58:48,697
- Mrs. Dax, when your husband
left you, you were asleep.

1366
00:58:48,697 --> 00:58:50,319
So, you haven't a clue,
how long he was away,

1367
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:52,218
where he went, or what he did.

1368
00:58:52,218 --> 00:58:53,702
But we have.

1369
00:58:53,702 --> 00:58:55,221
We say, that while
you were sleeping,

1370
00:58:55,221 --> 00:58:56,705
he went down and
murdered Miss Tulip,

1371
00:58:56,705 --> 00:58:58,983
and at this moment,
he's on the run.

1372
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:26,208
- Hello.

1373
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:27,969
Hello.

1374
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,010
Hello, Exchange.

1375
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:36,529
Get me the police.

1376
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,579
- Yes, well, you better split.

1377
01:00:52,579 --> 01:00:53,753
Alert all cars.

1378
01:00:55,306 --> 01:00:56,722
No sign of him, yet.

1379
01:00:58,171 --> 01:00:59,379
He's got to go somewhere,

1380
01:00:59,379 --> 01:01:00,380
and it's my bet
he'll come back here.

1381
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:03,452
- But surely, if as you say,

1382
01:01:03,452 --> 01:01:06,110
he did have something to
do with Miss Tulip's death,

1383
01:01:06,110 --> 01:01:08,941
then the last place
he'd come would be here.

1384
01:01:08,941 --> 01:01:10,943
- Perhaps, his superior
knowledge of police methods

1385
01:01:10,943 --> 01:01:14,049
will suggest that this is the
place we won't be watching.

1386
01:01:14,049 --> 01:01:15,810
- Andrew is not a murderer.

1387
01:01:17,259 --> 01:01:19,986
Even if he was he wouldn't be
stupid enough to come here.

1388
01:01:19,986 --> 01:01:21,229
So, you might just
as well go back

1389
01:01:21,229 --> 01:01:23,058
to your cells and
handcuffs and things

1390
01:01:23,058 --> 01:01:25,440
and leave me in peace.

1391
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,823
- You underestimate
one factor, Mrs. Dax.

1392
01:01:28,823 --> 01:01:30,341
You.

1393
01:01:30,341 --> 01:01:32,240
I don't suppose, you've
known many men on the run.

1394
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:33,724
But I have.

1395
01:01:33,724 --> 01:01:36,347
There's one thing they all
suffer from, loneliness.

1396
01:01:36,347 --> 01:01:39,074
The knowledge that every
man's hand is against them.

1397
01:01:39,074 --> 01:01:41,628
I lay a fiver he
comes back here.

1398
01:01:45,771 --> 01:01:47,911
- Andrew, the police are here!

1399
01:01:47,911 --> 01:01:48,808
The police.

1400
01:01:50,637 --> 01:01:52,122
- I wondered if
you could help me.

1401
01:01:52,122 --> 01:01:54,365
I'm so silly but
I've lost my way.

1402
01:01:54,365 --> 01:01:55,642
- Won't you come in?

1403
01:01:55,642 --> 01:01:57,714
- Oh, no, no, no,
I won't come in.

1404
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:58,991
It would only make you late.

1405
01:01:58,991 --> 01:02:00,268
- Make me late?
- Yes.

1406
01:02:00,268 --> 01:02:01,614
- I'm not going anywhere.

1407
01:02:01,614 --> 01:02:02,960
- You're so right, so right.

1408
01:02:04,513 --> 01:02:06,308
You wouldn't like it anyway.

1409
01:02:06,308 --> 01:02:07,724
It's the summertime, you know.

1410
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:11,210
Gets the clocks all, all upset.

1411
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:12,763
Don't you think?

1412
01:02:12,763 --> 01:02:15,766
- Madam, would you kindly
tell me who you are?

1413
01:02:15,766 --> 01:02:18,665
- Certainly not, we've
not been introduced.

1414
01:02:20,115 --> 01:02:21,358
- Miss Tulip.

1415
01:02:24,982 --> 01:02:27,882
- Well, I mustn't
stop your rehearsal.

1416
01:02:27,882 --> 01:02:29,400
- We are not play acting, madam.

1417
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:30,712
We are the police.

1418
01:02:30,712 --> 01:02:31,886
- Oh, I'm so sorry,

1419
01:02:31,886 --> 01:02:34,474
I only use may glasses
when I'm reading.

1420
01:02:35,613 --> 01:02:38,133
We've got police in
Australia too, you know.

1421
01:02:38,133 --> 01:02:42,068
- Australia, you're Angela.

1422
01:02:42,068 --> 01:02:44,761
- Yes, I'm Angela.

1423
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:45,762
- But you're dead.

1424
01:02:46,659 --> 01:02:47,833
- I don't think so.

1425
01:02:49,938 --> 01:02:50,767
Am I?

1426
01:02:52,872 --> 01:02:55,599
She's heard that funny story.

1427
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:56,842
- What funny story?

1428
01:02:56,842 --> 01:03:00,052
- About my being killed
in the railway crash.

1429
01:03:00,052 --> 01:03:03,089
All the papers had my
name all over them.

1430
01:03:03,089 --> 01:03:06,437
The people were so surprised
when I turned up alive.

1431
01:03:07,438 --> 01:03:08,992
It was so exciting.

1432
01:03:08,992 --> 01:03:09,993
- And your sister knew of this?

1433
01:03:09,993 --> 01:03:11,822
- Oh, yes, yes, Millicent knew.

1434
01:03:11,822 --> 01:03:14,583
I sent her all the
cuttings to explain.

1435
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,484
- When did you get back?

1436
01:03:18,484 --> 01:03:20,141
- Oh, I'm not going back.

1437
01:03:20,141 --> 01:03:21,521
It would be so silly to go back

1438
01:03:21,521 --> 01:03:24,007
having come all this
way here, wouldn't it?

1439
01:03:24,007 --> 01:03:26,526
Besides, Millicent, is
meeting me at the station.

1440
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:30,427
- Miss Angela, perhaps,
you'd better sit down.

1441
01:03:30,427 --> 01:03:32,705
- How kind of you, thank you.

1442
01:03:35,742 --> 01:03:37,883
- I'm afraid, I have
some bad news for you.

1443
01:03:39,229 --> 01:03:41,645
- Don't tell me she's
cross with me again?

1444
01:03:41,645 --> 01:03:44,234
- No, she won't be
cross with you any more.

1445
01:03:44,234 --> 01:03:47,478
You see, she's dead, murdered.

1446
01:03:48,928 --> 01:03:50,378
- She should be more careful.

1447
01:03:52,069 --> 01:03:55,176
But, she can't possibly
be dead without seeing me.

1448
01:03:55,176 --> 01:03:56,867
You see, we'd quarreled,

1449
01:03:56,867 --> 01:03:59,456
that's why I eloped
to Australia.

1450
01:03:59,456 --> 01:04:03,046
It wasn't till years after
that I wrote home having read

1451
01:04:03,046 --> 01:04:06,394
the announcement of my
father's death in the paper.

1452
01:04:06,394 --> 01:04:08,810
Then Millicent
wrote and told me,

1453
01:04:08,810 --> 01:04:11,054
he cut me out of his will.

1454
01:04:11,054 --> 01:04:12,538
- Is that why you killed her?

1455
01:04:14,816 --> 01:04:16,369
- I don't understand.

1456
01:04:16,369 --> 01:04:17,543
- Mrs. Dax, I must ask you...

1457
01:04:17,543 --> 01:04:18,371
- Quiet!

1458
01:04:21,305 --> 01:04:23,411
You hated Millicent, didn't you?

1459
01:04:23,411 --> 01:04:24,653
For the way she'd opposed you

1460
01:04:24,653 --> 01:04:27,242
and made it necessary
for you to run away.

1461
01:04:27,242 --> 01:04:28,865
And when you heard
how she cheated you

1462
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:31,384
out of your father's money,
you decided to kill her.

1463
01:04:31,384 --> 01:04:34,871
- My dear, you don't
know what you're saying.

1464
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:37,425
- Mrs. Dax, you mustn't make
wild accusations like that.

1465
01:04:37,425 --> 01:04:39,392
- They're not wild, but I am,

1466
01:04:39,392 --> 01:04:41,291
accusing Andrew of murder.

1467
01:04:41,291 --> 01:04:43,707
Anyway, she's been here
before and I can prove it.

1468
01:04:43,707 --> 01:04:44,950
- How?

1469
01:04:44,950 --> 01:04:47,435
- Because when she came
in, Archie didn't bark.

1470
01:04:47,435 --> 01:04:49,023
He knew her, look at him now.

1471
01:04:51,232 --> 01:04:54,580
- All animals like me
but that's no proof.

1472
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:55,892
- I wouldn't be
too sure of that.

1473
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:58,032
- Andrew.
- Mr. Dax.

1474
01:04:58,032 --> 01:04:59,516
In the
name of the law,

1475
01:04:59,516 --> 01:05:02,726
- Why don't you keep quiet
while I talk to the Inspector.

1476
01:05:02,726 --> 01:05:04,728
Now, I'm sorry I had to
run out on you, Inspector,

1477
01:05:04,728 --> 01:05:06,903
but, well, I've
been doing a little

1478
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:09,629
research on a
story I thought up.

1479
01:05:09,629 --> 01:05:12,184
- Yes, Mr. Dax.
- Yes, Inspector.

1480
01:05:12,184 --> 01:05:13,840
I have been working very
hard, as a matter of fact.

1481
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:15,946
I've got quite a headache.

1482
01:05:15,946 --> 01:05:18,293
And now, I'm on
the last chapter,

1483
01:05:18,293 --> 01:05:20,847
the one where we have
the grand finale.

1484
01:05:20,847 --> 01:05:22,332
- And the brilliant
amateur solves

1485
01:05:22,332 --> 01:05:23,954
the mystery that
baffled the police.

1486
01:05:23,954 --> 01:05:25,300
- That's right, yeah.

1487
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:27,958
But it was really Kate
who solved the mystery.

1488
01:05:27,958 --> 01:05:29,442
- Andrew, did I?

1489
01:05:29,442 --> 01:05:30,754
- Yes, it was when you told me

1490
01:05:30,754 --> 01:05:32,307
not to use that damp tea cloth

1491
01:05:32,307 --> 01:05:34,723
and reminded me that
it had been raining.

1492
01:05:34,723 --> 01:05:36,277
Feathers was onto it, too.

1493
01:05:36,277 --> 01:05:37,588
- Feathers?
- Yes.

1494
01:05:37,588 --> 01:05:39,728
He saw the snag right away.

1495
01:05:39,728 --> 01:05:42,973
You see, although the body
had been laying outside

1496
01:05:42,973 --> 01:05:45,872
her clothes were
still quite dry.

1497
01:05:45,872 --> 01:05:47,460
That was when the penny dropped.

1498
01:05:48,875 --> 01:05:51,257
And as for you, never
again will I say anything

1499
01:05:51,257 --> 01:05:53,259
against a woman's intuition.

1500
01:05:53,259 --> 01:05:55,192
Your reconstruction of
the crime was masterly.

1501
01:05:55,192 --> 01:05:57,160
- Was it?
- Yes.

1502
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:58,989
But not quite right.

1503
01:06:00,439 --> 01:06:03,925
She hated her sister all
right, and she killed her.

1504
01:06:03,925 --> 01:06:06,963
I mean, it was a clever plot
to drive towards the coast,

1505
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:09,482
stop on the way, commit
the murder and then,

1506
01:06:09,482 --> 01:06:11,174
imposing on two
complete strangers,

1507
01:06:11,174 --> 01:06:13,797
dump the body in the shrubbery
to establish an alibi,

1508
01:06:13,797 --> 01:06:15,868
change clothes with the
corpse during the night

1509
01:06:15,868 --> 01:06:18,388
and appear the next day as
her newly arrived sister,

1510
01:06:18,388 --> 01:06:20,528
the only surviving member
of the Tulip family,

1511
01:06:20,528 --> 01:06:21,839
to claim the estate.

1512
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:24,394
And that, that is
exactly what you did do,

1513
01:06:24,394 --> 01:06:26,120
Miss Millicent Tulip.

1514
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:27,638
- Millicent Tulip?

1515
01:06:28,708 --> 01:06:30,434
- Hit the jackpot in one.

1516
01:06:30,434 --> 01:06:32,954
Splendid, off with the disguise.

1517
01:06:35,508 --> 01:06:37,234
You should have found that out.

1518
01:06:37,234 --> 01:06:38,477
Elementary!

1519
01:06:38,477 --> 01:06:39,719
Go on, back on the beat.

1520
01:06:39,719 --> 01:06:41,721
- Millicent Tulip, I arrest you

1521
01:06:41,721 --> 01:06:43,482
for the murder of
your sister Angela.

1522
01:06:43,482 --> 01:06:44,586
- You're wasting
your time, Inspector.

1523
01:06:44,586 --> 01:06:46,450
She's as mad as a March hare.

1524
01:06:46,450 --> 01:06:47,693
- It's a lie.

1525
01:06:47,693 --> 01:06:49,315
The March hare is
as sane as I am.

1526
01:06:49,315 --> 01:06:50,868
Cost me a packet
not to be certified.

1527
01:06:50,868 --> 01:06:52,042
- Come along with me, Madam.

1528
01:06:52,042 --> 01:06:53,216
- Where are we going?
- To the station.

1529
01:06:53,216 --> 01:06:54,769
- Good, I love trains.

1530
01:06:54,769 --> 01:06:55,908
Can we get some tea?

1531
01:06:55,908 --> 01:06:57,461
- Oh, yes.
- Never drink it.

1532
01:06:57,461 --> 01:06:59,118
Well, what are we waiting for?

1533
01:06:59,118 --> 01:07:00,430
Let's get cracking!

1534
01:07:02,673 --> 01:07:04,468
I know
the way, I know the way.

1535
01:07:12,442 --> 01:07:15,031
- Well, how crazy can you get?

1536
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:16,273
Thank heavens that's over.

1537
01:07:16,273 --> 01:07:17,792
- Oh, yes.

1538
01:07:17,792 --> 01:07:19,932
Now, you'll be able to finish
your book at last, darling.

1539
01:07:21,106 --> 01:07:22,590
You're supposed to be
writing one, remember.

1540
01:07:22,590 --> 01:07:23,970
- Oh, I'm not gonna finish that.

1541
01:07:23,970 --> 01:07:24,902
- What?

1542
01:07:24,902 --> 01:07:26,766
- No, I got a much better idea.

1543
01:07:26,766 --> 01:07:28,285
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

1544
01:07:28,285 --> 01:07:32,186
And the title, "Miss
Tulip Stays The Night."
