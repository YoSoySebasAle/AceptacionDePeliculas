1
00:02:03,045 --> 00:02:03,823
Julianne?

2
00:02:04,495 --> 00:02:05,454
Nicola?

3
00:02:06,222 --> 00:02:07,181
Stacy?

4
00:02:07,854 --> 00:02:10,664
Stuart?
Natalie?

5
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:13,839
- Go!
- But if I could just...

6
00:02:14,224 --> 00:02:17,046
But nothing. I'm not interested.
Go and get a green slip. Go on.

7
00:02:29,515 --> 00:02:30,750
- Morning Ms Hive.
- Mike.

8
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:31,869
Ms Bee.

9
00:02:32,062 --> 00:02:33,809
I was after a late slip.

10
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,450
That's the third this week, Mike.

11
00:02:35,451 --> 00:02:36,314
I'm sorry.

12
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,500
Thank you.

13
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,824
Right. Well, moving on...

14
00:03:09,017 --> 00:03:13,037
Now, class. In the 17th century,

15
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,005
Shakespeare wrote a lot of famous plays.

16
00:03:15,869 --> 00:03:20,056
Now here are some handouts.
I'd like you to read them. Pass them on.

17
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:22,261
Hand them out, and pass them on.

18
00:03:24,468 --> 00:03:27,903
Now, 'Romeo and Juliet' is
considered to be one...

19
00:03:27,904 --> 00:03:31,094
...of the most famous
love stories of all time.

20
00:03:42,924 --> 00:03:45,740
Look at all that carrot and alfalfa
just going to waste!

21
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,548
- If you're not gonna eat it, can I have it?
- Sure thing.

22
00:03:50,137 --> 00:03:50,981
Look at this.

23
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:55,498
This is Mum's way of making
me eat this crap.

24
00:03:56,074 --> 00:03:57,831
And it only makes me wanna
eat more junk!

25
00:03:57,832 --> 00:04:00,186
At least she's not like
Jenny Vrabovski's mum.

26
00:04:00,187 --> 00:04:02,296
She gets a can of mixed beans every
day for lunch.

27
00:04:02,297 --> 00:04:04,171
I'd be pretty devo if she was!

28
00:04:04,556 --> 00:04:06,474
Hey, look. It's the new kid.

29
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,001
Why don't we ask him to come
and sit with us?

30
00:04:10,002 --> 00:04:12,654
No. Not right now.

31
00:04:13,422 --> 00:04:15,104
Let's just make it us.

32
00:04:15,585 --> 00:04:16,544
Okay.

33
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:21,148
Fuckin' faggott!

34
00:04:53,221 --> 00:04:54,318
Hey man, how ya goin'?

35
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,917
Have you got 'The Peanut Butter Solution'?

36
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:57,685
No, I don't have 'The Peanut Butter

37
00:04:57,686 --> 00:04:58,794
Solution'. Okay?

38
00:04:58,795 --> 00:05:01,004
That's the same 'no' I gave you last week

39
00:05:01,005 --> 00:05:03,367
and the week before then.
I don't have it, mate.

40
00:05:03,368 --> 00:05:05,305
Now just skedaddle, will ya?

41
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:07,608
Yeah, right-o.

42
00:05:10,966 --> 00:05:14,566
Hi Jeff. Have you got time to
help me look for some videos?

43
00:05:14,567 --> 00:05:16,952
I'm sorry Ursula, I'm really
busy right now.

44
00:05:17,241 --> 00:05:18,721
I'll get Mike to help you out though...

45
00:05:18,722 --> 00:05:19,681
Mike?

46
00:05:20,641 --> 00:05:21,600
Yes, Jeff?

47
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:23,612
Can you just help this
lady out, please?

48
00:05:26,682 --> 00:05:29,909
- Do you see anything you like?
- I sure do!

49
00:05:31,637 --> 00:05:34,652
You know, if you told me what you
were into, it might help.

50
00:05:36,091 --> 00:05:40,535
Well, I like romance mixed with
a bit of action.

51
00:05:40,536 --> 00:05:42,058
What do you like?

52
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:45,159
You keep looking. I'll be back.

53
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,599
I'll be waiting.

54
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:52,926
Okay class. Can everybody get their
books out, please?

55
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,710
Act I, Scene I...

56
00:05:57,286 --> 00:06:00,206
Hi Mike. Nice to have you
with us!

57
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:03,956
William, you're gonna have to
share with someone ...

58
00:06:03,957 --> 00:06:05,506
...until you get your own copy.

59
00:06:05,987 --> 00:06:08,656
In fact, Mike, can you share
with William?

60
00:06:09,616 --> 00:06:11,436
Great. Thank you.

61
00:06:16,232 --> 00:06:19,034
- Hey, I'm Mike.
- Yeah, I got that.

62
00:06:19,323 --> 00:06:20,282
Oh, yeah.

63
00:06:20,763 --> 00:06:21,530
When you're ready, Mike.

64
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:31,289
Hayley, could you please read from
where we left off yesterday.

65
00:06:35,318 --> 00:06:36,277
Out loud?

66
00:06:38,388 --> 00:06:41,668
Yeah. In fact William, can
you read please?

67
00:06:42,244 --> 00:06:43,203
Same spot.

68
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:46,048
Top of page 46.

69
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,940
Alas, that love whose view is muffled still

70
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,393
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!

71
00:06:55,545 --> 00:06:58,902
Where shall we dine? O me!
What fray was here?

72
00:06:59,766 --> 00:07:03,027
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.

73
00:07:03,124 --> 00:07:06,672
Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.

74
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,088
William, we're going to have
to leave it there. Thank you.

75
00:07:18,144 --> 00:07:19,411
I prefer Will, Miss.

76
00:07:19,796 --> 00:07:23,503
Will, it is! Okay, class...

77
00:07:23,504 --> 00:07:27,456
...I want you to get into groups
of two and three.

78
00:07:27,457 --> 00:07:31,432
Your assignment is 'Romeo and 'Juliet'.

79
00:07:31,624 --> 00:07:35,056
But your own modern interpretation.

80
00:07:35,345 --> 00:07:39,765
It's due at the end of semester,
and it'll go towards your final mark.

81
00:07:39,766 --> 00:07:42,897
Well, what are you waiting for?
Get into your groups!

82
00:08:05,435 --> 00:08:07,768
Hey, everyone else has a
partner, so...

83
00:08:08,248 --> 00:08:09,974
- do you wanna work together?
- Yeah, guess so.

84
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:11,989
Cool.

85
00:08:15,826 --> 00:08:16,977
This is great.

86
00:08:20,814 --> 00:08:22,036
Can I ask you a question?

87
00:08:22,037 --> 00:08:24,211
Yeah, sure. Ask me anything.

88
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,328
What do you wanna ask me?

89
00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:29,048
- Do you like this school?
- Do I like this school?

90
00:08:29,816 --> 00:08:32,099
Yeah, sure I like this school.

91
00:08:32,483 --> 00:08:35,751
It's actually, you know, it's actually
a pretty good school.

92
00:08:36,231 --> 00:08:38,660
Yeah, I dunno. It's not really
doin' it for me.

93
00:08:38,757 --> 00:08:40,760
I'm not sure I like it at all, to be honest.

94
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:44,298
Yeah, I know what you mean. It is
a little shonky in a way.

95
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:46,533
But it's not that bad!

96
00:08:46,918 --> 00:08:49,817
You know, I think that's the most
anyone's spoken to me all week!

97
00:08:49,818 --> 00:08:52,171
Yeah, gets a bit like that around here.

98
00:08:52,172 --> 00:08:53,983
But you'll get used to it.

99
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,956
You guys have a media room here?

100
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,941
No, not really. Why?

101
00:08:59,942 --> 00:09:03,456
Ah, at my old school I did media, short films and stuff.

102
00:09:04,033 --> 00:09:05,972
Cool. Do you have a camera?

103
00:09:05,973 --> 00:09:08,581
Yeah, it's a cheapo, but it
still does the job.

104
00:09:08,678 --> 00:09:11,643
You know, we should make our
project into a film.

105
00:09:11,644 --> 00:09:12,603
Really?

106
00:09:12,604 --> 00:09:15,807
Yeah! That's something I've always
wanted to do. Make a film.

107
00:09:16,192 --> 00:09:18,641
- Would you be cool with that?
- Yeah, I guess so.

108
00:09:19,409 --> 00:09:22,169
- Cool. I'm excited!
- Yeah.

109
00:09:24,088 --> 00:09:25,047
But what kind though?

110
00:09:29,844 --> 00:09:33,272
The only kind that can be so bad,
but still be good.

111
00:09:34,136 --> 00:09:36,001
A horror movie?
That's so grouse!

112
00:09:36,002 --> 00:09:37,919
Yeah, it's with the new kid.

113
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,966
Ah, I'm so jealous. He's like the
hottest guy at school right now.

114
00:09:41,638 --> 00:09:45,558
Nothing special, so...
don't get too excited.

115
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,146
- Hi.
- Hey.

116
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:17,048
- So, how's your week been?
- Yeah, not too bad.

117
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,837
Still tryin' to get my head round
a few things, but...

118
00:10:19,837 --> 00:10:20,713
Waiting for a lift?

119
00:10:21,385 --> 00:10:23,857
Yeah, from Dad, but he's always late.

120
00:10:23,858 --> 00:10:25,998
Me too. Mum. It's late.

121
00:10:27,726 --> 00:10:30,282
So, we should probably get
started on this film.

122
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,950
Yeah. I can't do anything tonight.

123
00:10:35,773 --> 00:10:39,052
- Um, but tomorrow?
- Tomorrow, yeah, cool.

124
00:10:39,532 --> 00:10:40,875
I'll give you my number.

125
00:10:49,891 --> 00:10:51,509
- I'll give you a call tomorrow, then.
- Cool.

126
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,952
There's Dad. See you tomorrow.

127
00:10:54,953 --> 00:10:55,912
See you.

128
00:11:13,064 --> 00:11:14,995
When you finishing with all
this school?

129
00:11:16,338 --> 00:11:20,067
You should be out there in the real world, mate,
making money like me. Good money.

130
00:11:20,835 --> 00:11:22,837
Should I be pissing it away
like you as well?

131
00:11:22,838 --> 00:11:26,567
Pissing it away!  Don't you be
a fucking smartarse.

132
00:11:29,828 --> 00:11:31,622
Listen mate, I gotta drop some shit
off at the bridge,

133
00:11:31,623 --> 00:11:33,204
and you're gonna give me a hand.

134
00:11:33,397 --> 00:11:34,495
If that's alright.

135
00:11:36,318 --> 00:11:39,143
And then later we'll go and see her...

136
00:11:40,198 --> 00:11:42,338
...and it's gonna be in, and it's gonna be out.

137
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,713
I'll be back in a minute.

138
00:12:22,907 --> 00:12:24,154
Cherry, how is she today?

139
00:12:24,155 --> 00:12:27,371
Will, my friend, I'm very well.
Did you bring me a sweet today?

140
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:31,792
Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I couldn't get you a bag of snakes...

141
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,618
...so I got you a big snake instead!

142
00:12:36,194 --> 00:12:37,973
You tricked me! You always do that!

143
00:12:37,974 --> 00:12:41,310
Just for a second.
But don't eat it all at once!

144
00:12:41,982 --> 00:12:44,196
Okay? I'll see you tomorrrow.

145
00:12:46,211 --> 00:12:49,726
Alright. Say goodbye to your mum.
We're leaving.

146
00:12:55,865 --> 00:12:57,208
Bye Mum.

147
00:13:10,347 --> 00:13:12,051
Well, that was good. I enjoyed that.

148
00:13:12,819 --> 00:13:15,461
Good to be able to catch up and see a
movie with you now and again.

149
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,626
That was great, I thought it was great.
I love Meryl Streep.

150
00:13:18,627 --> 00:13:20,171
Did you like it, did you enjoy it?

151
00:13:20,172 --> 00:13:22,888
- I'm not really a fan of Meryl Streep.
- Aw!

152
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:27,833
Yeah, maybe next time I could
choose the movie?

153
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:29,995
Yeah, yeah. Like I'm not good at..

154
00:13:30,668 --> 00:13:33,160
I've never been good at, you know,
making choices and...

155
00:13:33,161 --> 00:13:35,569
...making decisions; that's more of
your mum's domain, you know.

156
00:13:38,543 --> 00:13:43,038
How is she? I mean, is she still,
you know...

157
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:46,214
let's... no, no, let's not go there.

158
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:50,530
I really shouldn't be asking you  about your mum.
I don't really want to know and get into all that.

159
00:13:53,888 --> 00:13:57,893
You know, don't do that. You just start talking
about Mum and then...

160
00:13:59,045 --> 00:14:00,451
...just stop.

161
00:14:00,931 --> 00:14:01,890
Sorry.

162
00:14:03,234 --> 00:14:06,631
- If you came in...
- I can't, Mike. I just...

163
00:14:07,974 --> 00:14:10,990
There's too many memories in that house,
and your mum and I just, we just, you know,

164
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:13,542
we can't...

165
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:17,522
...besides,  I've got a new life now, and my own
life , and I just...

166
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:22,009
I'm sorry, it's... I guess it's complicated.

167
00:14:29,107 --> 00:14:30,501
I'd better get you home, eh?

168
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:54,211
I'm headin' down the pub, mate.
Get that grub up before I get back.

169
00:14:54,253 --> 00:14:55,894
There's nothing to eat.
There's nothing in the fridge.

170
00:14:56,278 --> 00:14:57,717
You'll work it out.

171
00:15:02,897 --> 00:15:06,380
Was the pasta okay?
Sorry I didn't have time to cook.

172
00:15:07,148 --> 00:15:11,313
Did you um, did you notice that lady I said hello to
as we were coming out?

173
00:15:11,314 --> 00:15:13,221
- The blonde one?
- Yeah.

174
00:15:13,222 --> 00:15:14,181
What about her?

175
00:15:14,182 --> 00:15:17,073
She was like my nemesis at high school.

176
00:15:17,362 --> 00:15:20,871
- She used to try and steal all my boyfriends.
- How many boyfriends did you have?

177
00:15:20,872 --> 00:15:22,761
I wasn't a tart or anything,

178
00:15:22,762 --> 00:15:25,306
but when I was your age, you know, I used to
have  a few people chasing me.

179
00:15:25,307 --> 00:15:27,915
- You know how it is.
- Not really, no.

180
00:15:28,396 --> 00:15:30,942
I'm sure you... there are loads of girls
interested in you.

181
00:15:30,943 --> 00:15:33,094
Look at you! You're so handsome!

182
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,725
You'll see.

183
00:15:47,961 --> 00:15:49,067
You okay in there?

184
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:55,419
Go to sleep. I'll be back soon.

185
00:16:38,267 --> 00:16:42,103
This is my house. That's my mum's room.

186
00:16:43,543 --> 00:16:45,660
That's me as a baby. Don't look at that!

187
00:16:47,483 --> 00:16:50,403
Hey. Let me guess.
Someone likes cats.

188
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:54,618
Hey, have you ever played that game,
when you're a kid, with a mirror...

189
00:16:54,618 --> 00:16:58,237
...and you're looking up at the ceiling, and you
try and guide your way through the house?

190
00:16:59,197 --> 00:17:00,156
No.

191
00:17:01,404 --> 00:17:03,115
And this is the kitchen.

192
00:17:07,911 --> 00:17:09,904
- You wanna drink of something?
- What've you got?

193
00:17:14,316 --> 00:17:17,193
We have full Coke, diet Coke,

194
00:17:18,153 --> 00:17:20,934
Hawaiian punch.
- Hawaiian Punch sounds good.

195
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,085
What happened to your hand?

196
00:17:30,236 --> 00:17:31,483
Oh, was just an accident.

197
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:40,465
- What are you doing?
- Um, just testing the camera.

198
00:17:40,946 --> 00:17:43,257
- You filming me?
- No, it's not on.

199
00:17:43,258 --> 00:17:45,015
What's that red light then?

200
00:17:45,783 --> 00:17:48,692
- Oh, that's the standby light.
- Get lost, you're filming me.

201
00:17:49,077 --> 00:17:50,930
Just keep going, it's good.

202
00:17:51,314 --> 00:17:55,629
- I'm not doing anything interesting.
- You don't have to do anything interesting, just...

203
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:59,561
- okay, say something.
- I don't know what to say.

204
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:02,651
Hey, who's that?

205
00:18:04,474 --> 00:18:05,433
It's nobody.

206
00:18:06,297 --> 00:18:07,256
Thanks.

207
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:15,652
So, you're an only child?

208
00:18:15,653 --> 00:18:16,899
Yep, just me.

209
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:21,865
- Your mum didn't want any more kids?
- I dunno.

210
00:18:25,607 --> 00:18:27,490
So what does your mum actually do?

211
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,656
She's just a mum. She doesn't
really do anything.

212
00:18:32,383 --> 00:18:34,086
She must have a hobby or something.

213
00:18:34,471 --> 00:18:37,283
- No.
- Hey, are your parents still together?

214
00:18:39,394 --> 00:18:42,270
You know, I'm really sorry, but I've
gotta go. I mean...

215
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,478
...there's some stuff I gotta do, and it
can't really wait.

216
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:47,119
I'm just gonna head off, alright?

217
00:18:47,983 --> 00:18:51,339
Okay. Um, well, if it really can't wait...

218
00:18:51,723 --> 00:18:54,791
- maybe we can do tomorrow.
- Yeah, yeah, tomorrow sounds good.

219
00:18:55,272 --> 00:18:57,466
- Okay.
- Thanks for the drink.

220
00:18:58,618 --> 00:19:01,394
Yep. Bye.

221
00:19:03,793 --> 00:19:08,260
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to you.

222
00:19:08,261 --> 00:19:13,727
Happy birthday dear Mum,
Happy birthday to you.

223
00:19:24,127 --> 00:19:24,703
Love you, Mum.

224
00:19:54,646 --> 00:19:55,179
Hello.

225
00:21:13,192 --> 00:21:14,140
Who was that?

226
00:21:16,826 --> 00:21:19,255
Some douche-bag who likes
to torment me.

227
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:23,954
I'm so sick of these guys treating me like this
all the time for no reason.

228
00:21:25,489 --> 00:21:27,172
You should stick up for yourself.

229
00:21:27,173 --> 00:21:28,632
Don't be so afraid of them.

230
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:31,818
I try not to make waves. It's better
that way.

231
00:21:32,586 --> 00:21:35,996
Besides, I don't think I could face up
to them anyway.

232
00:21:37,243 --> 00:21:40,887
Hey listen, I'm sorry about the other day.
You know, leaving early and all that...

233
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,296
It doesn't matter. I don't care.

234
00:21:45,448 --> 00:21:48,240
Well, I still wanna keep working on the film with you,
if you're still cool with it.

235
00:21:48,241 --> 00:21:50,702
Yes, I do. I mean for sure.

236
00:21:51,182 --> 00:21:52,333
That would be great.

237
00:21:54,444 --> 00:21:57,084
Well, when's our project concept due?

238
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:00,442
Um, next Friday.

239
00:22:02,457 --> 00:22:04,096
Well, I can't do anything on it tonight.

240
00:22:05,631 --> 00:22:07,836
Well, what if I come over and stay at your house?

241
00:22:07,837 --> 00:22:09,669
Stay at my house?

242
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,748
Gee, yeah, sure. Of course.

243
00:22:13,229 --> 00:22:14,266
Cool! All good then.

244
00:22:15,322 --> 00:22:17,096
Cool. Don't worry. We'll have fun.

245
00:22:17,097 --> 00:22:19,598
I've got heaps of shrinkies we can make, and

246
00:22:19,598 --> 00:22:22,338
I've got like these old movies that
I've taped off TV,

247
00:22:22,339 --> 00:22:24,896
oh, and I can make sandwiches
the next day for school...

248
00:22:24,897 --> 00:22:27,240
It's all good. You don't have
to go to any trouble for me.

249
00:22:30,214 --> 00:22:31,749
I'll catch you later, okay?

250
00:22:32,613 --> 00:22:33,572
See you.

251
00:22:36,258 --> 00:22:37,217
Sandwiches?

252
00:22:38,561 --> 00:22:39,520
Idiot!

253
00:22:58,707 --> 00:23:00,817
Hey Mum, this is my friend Will.

254
00:23:01,202 --> 00:23:03,408
Will, this is my mum, Jacqueline.

255
00:23:03,408 --> 00:23:06,721
Ah, the infamous William.
Nice to finally meet you.

256
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,065
Nice to meet you.

257
00:23:08,066 --> 00:23:09,875
Mike's mentioned you a few times.

258
00:23:23,772 --> 00:23:25,167
You can put your bag down.

259
00:23:25,744 --> 00:23:27,766
I haven't had time to set up
your bed.

260
00:23:27,767 --> 00:23:28,726
That's alright.

261
00:23:31,221 --> 00:23:32,180
What's this?

262
00:23:32,181 --> 00:23:35,119
Oh, it's just an old movie mag I used
to read as a kid.

263
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:42,706
I always used to like the wolfman, when
I was little.

264
00:23:42,995 --> 00:23:45,456
I was more a Frankenstein freak.

265
00:23:47,183 --> 00:23:48,865
Hey, why don't we just use them in our film?

266
00:23:49,442 --> 00:23:51,541
Yeah, that's a really good idea.

267
00:23:51,925 --> 00:23:54,865
Like a poxy B-grade movie at the drive-in.

268
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:58,721
- Yeah, I guess so.
- I haven't been to the drive-in in like 3 years!

269
00:23:58,722 --> 00:24:00,246
I haven't been in 17 years!

270
00:24:00,247 --> 00:24:03,048
What, you've never been to the drive-in?

271
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:05,169
- No.
- Not even when you were a little kid?

272
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:08,249
- No.
- Wow, man, you have to go.

273
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,604
- It's awesome.
- Yeah, one day.

274
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,086
We have to be pretty quiet,
coz Mum's gone to bed.

275
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,389
Okay.

276
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:27,376
- So what's the story about?
- Well, do we have to film this?

277
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:29,465
We'll call it 'making of...'.

278
00:24:29,466 --> 00:24:34,090
Okay. Well, we need two protags
that fall in love.

279
00:24:34,378 --> 00:24:39,844
Well, they're not both monsters until the wolfman
changes at the full moon, right?

280
00:24:40,324 --> 00:24:45,833
So, maybe the wolfman wants to share his
transformation with Frankenstein.

281
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:48,134
You know, like a way to
get closer to him.

282
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:50,254
Yeah, that's good. I like that.

283
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:09,212
- How's the bed?
- It's fine, thanks.

284
00:25:25,421 --> 00:25:28,415
- I had fun today.
- Me too.

285
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:38,023
- Do you need an extra blanket?
- Stop fussing, Mike.

286
00:25:38,024 --> 00:25:39,655
I just wanna go to sleep. Okay?

287
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:43,300
Okay.

288
00:25:46,274 --> 00:25:48,170
- Good night.
- Night.

289
00:26:00,063 --> 00:26:02,173
... and then I've got that white dress
that belonged to my mum.

290
00:26:02,174 --> 00:26:04,442
I dunno. What do you think? Do you
think I'll look super cute?

291
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:08,704
Oh yeah, yeah. Super cute!

292
00:26:08,897 --> 00:26:12,306
Do you reckon Mike can bring Will with him?
I think he's super spunky!

293
00:26:12,307 --> 00:26:14,524
Do you think you can ask Mike
to ask him?

294
00:26:14,525 --> 00:26:18,796
Yeah, sure. But it's kind of like
a me-and-Mike type thing

295
00:26:18,902 --> 00:26:22,418
so I don't know if he's gonna bring
anyone else.

296
00:26:27,757 --> 00:26:30,955
- Hi Mlke.
- Hey Ursula, sorry...

297
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:34,354
- I'm really busy right now.
- I've been really busy too.

298
00:26:34,355 --> 00:26:38,296
I've just dropped that movie off that you
recommended, Eraserhead.

299
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:43,114
It was slightly hard to watch in a sort of
postnatal depression type way.

300
00:26:43,115 --> 00:26:44,903
I'm sure it was.

301
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:47,075
Have you seen anything new lately?

302
00:26:48,515 --> 00:26:52,426
Um, no. I've been busy with schoolwork.

303
00:26:52,427 --> 00:26:57,808
- Busy with the girls.
- No, with schoolwork.

304
00:26:58,768 --> 00:27:03,394
I've, um, I've actually got these boxes at home
that are really heavy,

305
00:27:03,395 --> 00:27:07,516
and I need a really strong arm to help me
get them to the top of my wardrobe.

306
00:27:07,997 --> 00:27:11,981
Could you, could you come over
and help me maybe, soon?

307
00:27:14,187 --> 00:27:16,551
Um, ask Jeff. Jeff'll help you
out with it.

308
00:27:17,032 --> 00:27:19,967
Okay, alright. Well I hope I see you soon.

309
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,118
Bye.

310
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:34,258
Hi Mum.

311
00:27:35,218 --> 00:27:37,896
This is Mike. He's the friend from school
that I was telling you about.

312
00:27:37,897 --> 00:27:41,261
- Nice to meet you.
- Have a seat.

313
00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:01,956
This is Mum's favourite thing in the world.
It was a gift from her mum.

314
00:28:01,957 --> 00:28:04,216
Always makes her happy.

315
00:28:34,618 --> 00:28:39,242
She's been here 3 years now. That's why we moved,
you know, to get closer to her.

316
00:28:41,161 --> 00:28:43,782
If you don't mind me asking,
what happened to her?

317
00:28:45,413 --> 00:28:47,127
Suffered a brain injury.

318
00:28:47,128 --> 00:28:48,663
Never really recovered.

319
00:28:51,349 --> 00:28:55,663
There's other people in here with
brain injuries, but... from drinking.

320
00:28:57,678 --> 00:28:59,524
But Mum never drank her whole life.

321
00:29:03,145 --> 00:29:04,104
Let's get out of here.

322
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:22,615
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do.

323
00:29:22,616 --> 00:29:26,931
They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.

324
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:33,070
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.

325
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:36,907
Then move not, as my prayer's effect I take.

326
00:29:40,563 --> 00:29:41,697
What now?

327
00:29:42,849 --> 00:29:46,311
This is the bit where they
are supposed to kiss.

328
00:29:46,791 --> 00:29:48,933
Well, one on the cheek. That be okay?

329
00:29:50,084 --> 00:29:51,044
Okay.

330
00:29:59,824 --> 00:30:03,535
Thus from my lips, by yours my sin is purged.

331
00:30:05,454 --> 00:30:11,310
Then take the sin that my lips have took.

332
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:20,038
Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
Give me my sin again.

333
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:29,809
Can we stop? Can we cut?

334
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:30,769
There you go.

335
00:30:32,113 --> 00:30:33,359
Sorry, I just forgot the line.

336
00:30:33,648 --> 00:30:35,748
- There you go.
- Yeah.

337
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:42,606
This looks pretty cool. This backyard's
pretty scary.

338
00:30:44,238 --> 00:30:48,489
- Yeah, I used to think that there were monsters.
- Here?

339
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:51,709
Yeah. Me and my brother used to make
these monster pies,

340
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:54,840
full of like mud, and dirt and rocks,

341
00:30:55,033 --> 00:30:59,781
and we'd cook them in the sun, and then
we'd leave them out overnight...

342
00:30:59,782 --> 00:31:03,738
...so the monsters would eat them
instead of eating us.

343
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,504
Where is your brother, anyway, though?

344
00:31:09,177 --> 00:31:11,709
Does he live with your dad or something?

345
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:17,803
If I tell you, do you promise to
keep it to yourself?

346
00:31:17,804 --> 00:31:19,147
Yeah, I promise.

347
00:31:22,409 --> 00:31:26,649
One day we were driving home, and we were
playing in the back seat

348
00:31:28,376 --> 00:31:32,082
and I remember Les was playing with the handle

349
00:31:32,851 --> 00:31:36,771
and one minute he was there, and the
next he wasn't.

350
00:31:37,252 --> 00:31:38,211
I'm sorry.

351
00:31:41,664 --> 00:31:44,337
Oh, it's cold out here. Let's... let's  go inside.

352
00:32:10,424 --> 00:32:12,650
- Hey Janine.
- What are you doing here?

353
00:32:14,665 --> 00:32:17,638
Aah, I am at the party which
you invited me to.

354
00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:20,781
I told you to come with me,
not with him.

355
00:32:22,508 --> 00:32:25,363
I was invited to this party, and I
was bringing you along.

356
00:32:25,364 --> 00:32:28,005
So I have to be here with you, or nobody else.

357
00:32:28,102 --> 00:32:30,584
No, this is not how it works.

358
00:32:30,585 --> 00:32:31,544
Well...

359
00:32:33,175 --> 00:32:36,924
...I'm gonna go. It's been an awesome party.

360
00:32:37,213 --> 00:32:39,323
Thanks Janine. Have a good one!

361
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:40,954
Great party!

362
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,599
Cheers!

363
00:32:56,489 --> 00:32:59,463
- Wait a second.
- Sorry.

364
00:33:00,998 --> 00:33:04,258
She's not normally like that.
She's just being such a bitch.

365
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:06,810
Just relax, okay?
You need to cool down.

366
00:33:08,633 --> 00:33:11,066
You're right. Come with me.

367
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:30,045
How did you even get the key to this place?

368
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:32,496
I used to work here...

369
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,226
...teaching little kids. Don't worry.
No one comes here at night.

370
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:38,624
We getting in then?

371
00:34:11,721 --> 00:34:12,872
Why did you do that?

372
00:34:13,448 --> 00:34:16,825
You were gonna jump in.
It's more fun this way.

373
00:34:17,689 --> 00:34:18,840
It wasn't for me!

374
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:22,389
You okay?

375
00:34:25,267 --> 00:34:26,802
I didn't mean to upset you.

376
00:34:27,282 --> 00:34:28,241
No, it's fine.

377
00:34:29,105 --> 00:34:30,544
Are those tears in your eyes?

378
00:34:30,545 --> 00:34:33,449
No, it's just the chlorine irritating me or something.

379
00:34:34,217 --> 00:34:35,272
Let me see.

380
00:34:51,479 --> 00:34:52,351
Where are you going?

381
00:34:52,352 --> 00:34:53,598
I wanna go home.

382
00:34:56,668 --> 00:34:58,671
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

383
00:34:59,151 --> 00:35:00,110
Goodbye.

384
00:35:20,826 --> 00:35:21,944
What are you doing here?

385
00:35:23,191 --> 00:35:24,150
Nothing.

386
00:35:24,631 --> 00:35:26,303
It's late, and I'm freezing.

387
00:35:27,454 --> 00:35:29,159
And that's your reason for leaving?

388
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:34,997
Yes, Mike. It's late. I'm cold. I'm tired,

389
00:35:35,286 --> 00:35:37,918
and I don't feel so good right now.

390
00:35:38,206 --> 00:35:39,846
It's not because I kissed you?

391
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:43,288
No, that's not it.

392
00:35:45,015 --> 00:35:46,454
Then what is it then?

393
00:35:49,236 --> 00:35:50,579
Because I liked it.

394
00:36:07,754 --> 00:36:09,183
Oh my God! What time is it?

395
00:36:09,184 --> 00:36:11,164
- Am I late for work?
- No.

396
00:36:11,165 --> 00:36:13,188
I'm up early for school.

397
00:36:14,628 --> 00:36:16,130
Oh, God. That is good.

398
00:36:16,131 --> 00:36:17,718
Well, have a nice day, eh?

399
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:18,965
You too, Mum.

400
00:36:21,172 --> 00:36:22,353
- Jenny?
- Here.

401
00:36:22,737 --> 00:36:25,028
- Jim Williams?
- Here.

402
00:36:25,604 --> 00:36:26,947
- Kate?
- Here.

403
00:36:28,194 --> 00:36:30,345
- Mike?
- Here, Miss.

404
00:36:33,031 --> 00:36:34,607
Oh, first time for everything.

405
00:36:35,184 --> 00:36:36,143
Hayley?

406
00:38:31,664 --> 00:38:35,702
And then the two are reborn into butterflies,
and live happily ever after.

407
00:38:36,086 --> 00:38:40,561
Thank you, Kate. That was
very deep, and poetic.

408
00:38:40,754 --> 00:38:44,675
And now class, it's time to hear
from Mike and Will.

409
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:56,302
Our film tells the story of two
traditional movie monsters,

410
00:38:56,303 --> 00:38:59,679
who find love with each other while
acting out 'Romeo and Juliet'.

411
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:04,857
<i>Our main characters are Frankenstein,
born as a monster,</i>

412
00:39:05,529 --> 00:39:08,054
<i>but not accepted for being different,</i>

413
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:11,282
<i>and the wolfman, trying to overcome
his new changes,</i>

414
00:39:11,283 --> 00:39:14,234
<i>as he enters into the world
of the monsters.</i>

415
00:39:14,907 --> 00:39:18,964
<i>They're not out to hurt anybody,
though they're cruelly misjudged</i>

416
00:39:18,965 --> 00:39:22,333
<i>and hunted down by the villagers,
who fear them.</i>

417
00:39:25,116 --> 00:39:26,075
Thank you.

418
00:39:31,638 --> 00:39:32,597
Hey, Janine.

419
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:59,942
Gary, I don't have this
stupid film, okay?

420
00:40:59,943 --> 00:41:02,820
I check for you every week,
week after week after week...

421
00:41:02,821 --> 00:41:05,124
There's nothing on the computer,

422
00:41:05,125 --> 00:41:07,732
'Peanut Butter Solution', no mate, no!

423
00:41:08,021 --> 00:41:11,473
- So, you don't have 'The Peanut Butter Solution'?
- That's what I said!

424
00:41:11,474 --> 00:41:15,287
It's not here. It's not here.
Can you just get out.

425
00:41:15,288 --> 00:41:18,590
When you get it, will it be a weekly,
or overnight?

426
00:41:18,591 --> 00:41:22,107
Hi Mike, what are you up to?
Do you wanna go grab a cappucino?

427
00:41:24,238 --> 00:41:26,167
No, I'm not really into coffees.

428
00:41:26,647 --> 00:41:30,462
Um, besides, I don't think people drank
cappucinos since like 1992!

429
00:41:34,012 --> 00:41:36,683
- What's wrong?
- I don't like you like that.

430
00:41:37,163 --> 00:41:39,167
Well, what's wrong with you?

431
00:41:39,168 --> 00:41:40,542
Nothing's wrong with me.

432
00:41:40,543 --> 00:41:43,185
What are you, a homo or something?

433
00:42:26,895 --> 00:42:28,653
We need to have a talk out the back.

434
00:42:54,101 --> 00:42:57,073
She made up this big story about how...

435
00:42:57,746 --> 00:43:00,462
...I love her, and I wanna be with her.

436
00:43:00,463 --> 00:43:02,167
And that I tried to kiss her.

437
00:43:02,168 --> 00:43:03,435
It's crazy.

438
00:43:03,627 --> 00:43:04,587
What a bitch!

439
00:43:05,067 --> 00:43:06,727
I can't believe they sacked you over that.

440
00:43:08,454 --> 00:43:10,905
You know, I don't blame her
for wanting to kiss you.

441
00:43:14,838 --> 00:43:15,797
Give it here!

442
00:43:21,744 --> 00:43:22,703
Hey, Will...

443
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:24,526
Mike.

444
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:27,581
Are we... together?

445
00:43:29,692 --> 00:43:31,035
Sure looks that way.

446
00:43:31,036 --> 00:43:31,995
No.

447
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:36,171
No, like 'together' together.

448
00:43:37,418 --> 00:43:39,580
Yeah. Why?

449
00:43:41,307 --> 00:43:45,783
- Just been thinking about it.
- But why me?

450
00:43:47,223 --> 00:43:50,023
I'm just... bad luck.

451
00:43:51,367 --> 00:43:53,422
I don't think I'd be the
right person for you.

452
00:43:54,574 --> 00:43:56,492
You're the only person
I wanna be with.

453
00:44:05,891 --> 00:44:07,915
- Hide behind the door.
- William, William you in there?

454
00:44:07,916 --> 00:44:11,870
Yeah, just gimme a sec.
I just got outa the shower.

455
00:44:14,365 --> 00:44:15,324
William!

456
00:44:16,955 --> 00:44:18,677
- William, William!
- What is it?

457
00:44:18,966 --> 00:44:20,487
Is there someone here with you?

458
00:44:20,488 --> 00:44:23,424
No, I told you, I just had a shower.
I didn't realize that I locked it.

459
00:44:23,457 --> 00:44:26,360
Mate, you were supposed to have something
ready for fucking dinner.

460
00:44:26,361 --> 00:44:28,079
I've gotta go to a mate's house
to pick up a book

461
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,653
for school. It's important, so right?

462
00:44:29,654 --> 00:44:30,613
It's for school.

463
00:44:30,614 --> 00:44:34,554
Oh, fuck mate. You are fuckin' useless.
You're just like your fuckin' mother!

464
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,754
I fuckin' hate living with him.

465
00:44:39,755 --> 00:44:41,620
You know, he's a sick drunk.

466
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:45,424
I'm just fucking sick
of all of this bullshit!

467
00:44:45,425 --> 00:44:46,576
It's okay, man.

468
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,581
- Things could change.
- Things don't change.

469
00:44:51,061 --> 00:44:54,087
- Things only get worse.
- I'm here for you.

470
00:44:54,951 --> 00:44:56,102
I don't know what to say.

471
00:45:00,419 --> 00:45:02,570
Where are we gonna go?

472
00:45:04,927 --> 00:45:05,886
I have an idea. Yeah.

473
00:45:19,026 --> 00:45:19,985
Got us a room.

474
00:45:20,466 --> 00:45:22,389
How? With what money?

475
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:24,101
I know the guy who works here.

476
00:45:24,102 --> 00:45:25,448
Got a room all to ourselves.

477
00:45:25,449 --> 00:45:28,497
Alright? No one's gonna disturb us.

478
00:45:28,785 --> 00:45:29,744
Come on.

479
00:45:44,277 --> 00:45:45,544
What are you thinking?

480
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:48,848
Sounds silly, but...

481
00:45:50,288 --> 00:45:54,848
...when I'm in bed at home, I try to think of
something nice before I fall asleep,

482
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,672
and it used to be really hard for me.

483
00:45:59,591 --> 00:46:02,882
But lately, I've been thinking of you.

484
00:46:03,842 --> 00:46:05,760
What a beautiful person you are, and

485
00:46:07,487 --> 00:46:09,329
the good you've been to me.

486
00:46:11,152 --> 00:46:12,399
What are you thinking?

487
00:46:13,167 --> 00:46:17,769
I'm thinking that I've never felt like this before

488
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:22,394
and this is exactly where I should be.

489
00:47:50,092 --> 00:47:52,348
- How's everything today?
- Oh, hello Mike.

490
00:47:52,349 --> 00:47:55,100
Nice to see you, in the afternoon.

491
00:47:55,389 --> 00:47:57,513
It's lovely to see you too,
Ms Bee.

492
00:47:57,514 --> 00:47:59,896
Let me guess. You're here to
buy tickets for the dance.

493
00:48:00,472 --> 00:48:03,625
Yes... tickets... to the dance.

494
00:48:03,818 --> 00:48:04,777
Yep.

495
00:48:05,354 --> 00:48:07,355
We need to know who the other
ticket's for.

496
00:48:07,644 --> 00:48:10,019
Oh, I was thinking, maybe, Janine

497
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,970
Janine's already bought her tickets.

498
00:48:12,451 --> 00:48:14,877
Is there anyone else you can go with?

499
00:48:19,577 --> 00:48:20,782
Hey, what's goin' on?

500
00:48:22,988 --> 00:48:27,325
- Are you going to the dance?
- Aah, maybe.

501
00:48:28,381 --> 00:48:31,225
- I really wanna go.
- You should go, then.

502
00:48:33,048 --> 00:48:35,318
Hayley mentioned something to me,

503
00:48:35,415 --> 00:48:37,980
but I know Stuart really likes her,
so maybe Joanne?

504
00:48:39,636 --> 00:48:40,882
I was thinking...

505
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:44,928
- I wanna go with you.
- Me?

506
00:48:45,217 --> 00:48:48,745
- We can't go to the dance together.
- What does it matter?

507
00:48:49,033 --> 00:48:51,004
Mike, we can't go to the dance
as a couple.

508
00:48:51,005 --> 00:48:52,058
Who cares?

509
00:48:52,059 --> 00:48:53,900
It's not like it's a big deal
or anything.

510
00:48:53,901 --> 00:48:56,705
I know it's not a big deal,
but it's the way things are.

511
00:48:56,706 --> 00:48:58,728
- We can't go changing anything.
-Why not?

512
00:49:01,319 --> 00:49:02,661
I'm just not ready to.

513
00:49:02,662 --> 00:49:05,740
You're the one telling me that I
should never be afraid.

514
00:49:05,741 --> 00:49:07,275
I'm not afraid of anything.

515
00:49:08,427 --> 00:49:10,758
That's it, isn't it? You're scared.

516
00:49:11,143 --> 00:49:15,447
Maybe I am, Mike, maybe I don't want to
get teased while I walk up the corridors.

517
00:49:15,832 --> 00:49:18,740
Maybe I don't wanna get called a
'faggott' while I'm eating my lunch.

518
00:49:19,987 --> 00:49:22,885
Yeah, 'coz that would be pathetic.

519
00:49:25,092 --> 00:49:27,894
Mike, I didn't mean it
like that. Mike!

520
00:49:28,182 --> 00:49:29,621
Wait a second!

521
00:50:27,802 --> 00:50:29,506
Mike, how're you going?

522
00:50:29,507 --> 00:50:31,042
You're after Janine, are you?

523
00:51:15,648 --> 00:51:16,607
What are you doing here?

524
00:51:16,608 --> 00:51:19,164
I need to tell you something.

525
00:51:19,356 --> 00:51:24,215
If it has anything to do with your new
best friend, then I'm non interested in it.

526
00:51:24,216 --> 00:51:25,654
What is that supposed to mean?

527
00:51:25,655 --> 00:51:26,173
Is everything okay?

528
00:51:26,174 --> 00:51:28,435
Can you stay with this boy while I
go and get some help?

529
00:51:28,436 --> 00:51:31,418
- What happened?
- I was driving, and he just came out of nowhere.

530
00:51:31,419 --> 00:51:33,901
- I didn't see him. It was an accident.
- Go! Go! Go!

531
00:51:34,861 --> 00:51:37,610
I don't understand why you want to hang out
with him for anyway.

532
00:51:37,611 --> 00:51:40,156
He's new. He just needs some friends.

533
00:51:40,541 --> 00:51:41,500
He's a freak.

534
00:51:43,994 --> 00:51:45,910
It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay, mate.

535
00:51:46,295 --> 00:51:48,362
Just keep breathing...

536
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:51,812
...It's gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

537
00:52:17,036 --> 00:52:18,943
I tried everything to help him.

538
00:52:19,232 --> 00:52:22,300
And he just died anyway.

539
00:52:25,754 --> 00:52:28,630
I wanted to help him, and I wanted to save him.

540
00:52:30,932 --> 00:52:35,034
And he just died. Right there in front of me.

541
00:52:38,392 --> 00:52:39,351
It's okay.

542
00:52:40,695 --> 00:52:42,037
It's not your fault.

543
00:52:47,505 --> 00:52:48,994
What's he doing here?

544
00:52:48,995 --> 00:52:49,954
He's just...

545
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:52,257
I'm gonna go.

546
00:54:06,549 --> 00:54:08,168
Hey Mum, just off to work.

547
00:54:08,744 --> 00:54:11,306
Okay. Look, I'm working late tonight,

548
00:54:11,307 --> 00:54:13,816
so if I don't see you, have a great time
at the dance, eh?

549
00:54:14,392 --> 00:54:15,735
Thanks. I'll let you know how it goes.

550
00:55:21,695 --> 00:55:24,465
Hey Mike, it's, um... it's Will.

551
00:56:58,345 --> 00:56:59,316
Hello?

552
00:57:01,618 --> 00:57:02,577
Oh, hi Jeff.

553
00:57:03,154 --> 00:57:07,688
Um, Mike's not here at the moment.
He's at the school dance.

554
00:57:11,621 --> 00:57:14,367
Okay, I'm not really sure what videos
you're talking about, but

555
00:57:14,368 --> 00:57:17,163
why don't I get him to bring them in
next time he comes in to work?

556
00:57:23,494 --> 00:57:24,453
Sorry?

557
00:57:25,413 --> 00:57:27,894
Okay, quiet everyone please, quiet

558
00:57:28,087 --> 00:57:29,046
Quiet... Tiffany.

559
00:57:29,718 --> 00:57:33,941
We have the annual teachers' performance
for the students...

560
00:57:33,942 --> 00:57:36,525
...which has been six months in the making.

561
00:57:36,718 --> 00:57:39,903
So, give a hand everyone,
to your teachers.

562
00:57:56,112 --> 00:57:57,071
Hey!

563
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,490
Will, What are you doing here?
Get out!

564
00:58:15,219 --> 00:58:16,370
What's up?

565
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:33,056
- You look really good.
- Thanks.

566
00:58:33,824 --> 00:58:35,455
You do too.

567
00:59:07,837 --> 00:59:09,638
I'm sorry about what happened.

568
00:59:10,598 --> 00:59:14,444
- No, don't be.
- You were right.

569
00:59:15,212 --> 00:59:19,996
No, I am afraid. I'm afraid of what
people say to me.

570
00:59:20,668 --> 00:59:23,480
I'm afraid of losing everyone.

571
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:26,570
I don't wanna be alone.

572
00:59:28,585 --> 00:59:30,449
I have no one as it is.

573
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:32,464
You have me.

574
00:59:33,808 --> 00:59:35,246
I've missed you.

575
01:01:28,091 --> 01:01:30,190
Did you know you have overdue
video tapes?

576
01:01:30,767 --> 01:01:32,013
What are you talking about?

577
01:01:32,014 --> 01:01:34,474
It wouldn't normally be a problem,
but you...

578
01:01:34,475 --> 01:01:36,147
...don't work at the video shop
anymore, do you?

579
01:01:37,203 --> 01:01:40,223
I was meaning to tell you.

580
01:01:40,511 --> 01:01:45,056
I couldn't find the one they were asking about,
but there were plenty of others I found.

581
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:51,620
All this time, I had no idea what
you were getting up to.

582
01:01:51,621 --> 01:01:54,370
Where did I go wrong? Eh?

583
01:01:55,042 --> 01:01:57,332
Was it him? Did he... did he brainwash you?

584
01:01:57,621 --> 01:02:01,413
Yeah, it's all... it's his fault isn't it.
It's a phase you're going through.

585
01:02:01,414 --> 01:02:02,756
It's not a phase.

586
01:02:05,059 --> 01:02:08,264
I feel responsible, you know.
I, I... I raised you

587
01:02:08,553 --> 01:02:11,302
- I brought you up.
- Please stop.

588
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:15,031
I called his father, before...

589
01:02:15,224 --> 01:02:16,567
... when I was upset.

590
01:02:17,239 --> 01:02:18,773
Why would you do that?

591
01:02:19,829 --> 01:02:22,927
I called him to tell him to keep
Will away from you.

592
01:02:27,148 --> 01:02:31,665
- William, the time's come, son...
- Go away. I don't wanna talk to you.

593
01:02:34,927 --> 01:02:36,557
We have to have a talk.

594
01:02:40,010 --> 01:02:41,257
Go away!

595
01:02:44,039 --> 01:02:48,928
William, please mate.
I'm not gonna let this go, mate.

596
01:02:49,408 --> 01:02:51,698
We need to have a talk.

597
01:02:52,275 --> 01:02:54,501
Please Dad, just go away.

598
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:05,658
William, I'm not getting angry,
I just wanna listen.

599
01:03:06,906 --> 01:03:09,601
Just tell me what the fuck
is going on.

600
01:03:10,561 --> 01:03:12,670
I don't know.... what's going on.

601
01:03:15,068 --> 01:03:21,535
I don't know what I... am.
I don't know what this is.

602
01:03:26,427 --> 01:03:29,176
Who the fuck is this Mike fucker?

603
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:33,620
Mate, don't you fuckin' dare stand
up to me like that!

604
01:03:33,813 --> 01:03:38,468
You live under my fuckin' house,
you live with my rules.

605
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:45,938
What is it you freaks get up to?
Does he... does he touch you on the arse?

606
01:03:45,939 --> 01:03:47,195
Get your fuckin' hands off me!

607
01:03:47,196 --> 01:03:49,134
Eh? Is that what you like?

608
01:03:49,135 --> 01:03:50,733
Is that what you like, William?

609
01:03:51,022 --> 01:03:52,149
Does he touch you down there, too?

610
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:53,876
Don't fuckin' touch me!

611
01:04:11,427 --> 01:04:12,386
Will, wait!

612
01:04:13,538 --> 01:04:14,497
Will, wait!

613
01:04:16,129 --> 01:04:17,906
Just go home, Mike.

614
01:04:19,345 --> 01:04:21,529
Go, I don't want you to see me like this.

615
01:04:25,366 --> 01:04:28,540
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Don't you get it?

616
01:04:29,213 --> 01:04:34,007
He wants us to be as fucked up as him,
so he feels normal.

617
01:04:37,077 --> 01:04:40,038
He pushed her head against the wall,
so fuckin' hard...

618
01:04:41,574 --> 01:04:45,174
...he made her sick, and
now he's working on me.

619
01:04:47,381 --> 01:04:50,726
Just go. Just go. I don't want
you to get hurt too.

620
01:04:50,727 --> 01:04:53,805
I'm not leaving. I love you.

621
01:04:56,779 --> 01:05:00,327
I don't want you to leave me.

622
01:05:28,716 --> 01:05:30,473
Why didn't you tell me about this place?

623
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:34,416
It's where I come to be alone.

624
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:42,301
- I'm tired.
- Yeah, me too.

625
01:05:45,851 --> 01:05:48,589
But I don't want to face tomorrow.

626
01:05:52,810 --> 01:05:53,769
It's okay.

627
01:06:23,977 --> 01:06:27,312
- Mike?
- Yeah?

628
01:06:31,437 --> 01:06:32,875
Love you too.

629
01:08:07,191 --> 01:08:10,004
<i>Hey Mike, it's, um... it's Will.</i>

630
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:15,222
<i>Just wanted to say that...
that I'm ... I'm sorry...</i>

631
01:08:16,374 --> 01:08:21,439
<i>...for everything. Just... give me a call
when you get this. Okay?</i>

632
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:22,399
<i>Bye.</i>

633
01:08:31,703 --> 01:08:32,949
I'm off now.

634
01:08:35,348 --> 01:08:39,405
If you, um... if you get hungry, there's
some leftovers in the fridge.

635
01:08:42,571 --> 01:08:44,732
Okay, I'll see you later then.

636
01:08:46,459 --> 01:08:47,706
- Ma?
- Yes?

637
01:08:54,516 --> 01:08:55,475
I loved him.

638
01:09:05,259 --> 01:09:06,801
If I knew he was gonna do that,

639
01:09:06,802 --> 01:09:08,195
I would have tried to stop him, but...

640
01:09:13,567 --> 01:09:15,219
I miss him, Mum.

641
01:09:18,673 --> 01:09:20,558
I miss him so much.

642
01:10:40,724 --> 01:10:41,629
Hola.

643
01:10:45,274 --> 01:10:47,486
Good to see you.

644
01:10:47,487 --> 01:10:51,188
Now my secretary said you needed
to talk to me urgently, so...

645
01:10:51,189 --> 01:10:52,435
Is everything okay?

646
01:10:55,889 --> 01:10:57,613
Um, I just need to talk.

647
01:10:57,998 --> 01:10:59,628
What have you been doing today?

648
01:11:02,986 --> 01:11:04,328
I was at a funeral.

649
01:11:07,111 --> 01:11:11,434
Oh! That's no good.
Sorry to hear that.

650
01:11:12,586 --> 01:11:15,312
- Was it a friend, was it, or...?
- Yeah.

651
01:11:15,697 --> 01:11:17,540
It was a guy from school.

652
01:11:18,788 --> 01:11:20,035
Wow, gee.

653
01:11:21,570 --> 01:11:23,933
Is it of a mate, a close... close friend?

654
01:11:24,510 --> 01:11:25,469
Yeah.

655
01:11:27,388 --> 01:11:28,539
Really close.

656
01:11:31,512 --> 01:11:32,472
So... um...

657
01:11:35,158 --> 01:11:36,117
...was there something...

658
01:11:36,693 --> 01:11:39,555
What was the something you wanted
to tell me about?

659
01:11:39,556 --> 01:11:40,803
I just did.

660
01:11:50,682 --> 01:11:53,451
Right! Okay.

661
01:11:56,041 --> 01:11:57,000
Okay.

662
01:11:59,303 --> 01:12:05,939
So, you were ... you two...
were more than just friends.

663
01:12:10,256 --> 01:12:15,051
Wow!.... Wow!

664
01:12:16,394 --> 01:12:17,353
So...

665
01:12:19,272 --> 01:12:23,001
...why you.... have you decided to tell
me this now?

666
01:12:23,769 --> 01:12:26,421
Coz I'm sick of being scared.

667
01:12:29,203 --> 01:12:30,162
Mike.

668
01:12:33,615 --> 01:12:36,054
Don't be scared to tell me things.

669
01:12:37,781 --> 01:12:39,697
You're my son, you know?

670
01:12:40,657 --> 01:12:41,808
I love you.

671
01:12:46,868 --> 01:12:49,864
And I don't care who you love.

672
01:12:51,783 --> 01:12:56,322
That's fine with me. Okay?

673
01:12:59,296 --> 01:13:02,182
You know, I'm proud of you.

674
01:13:06,978 --> 01:13:07,937
Okay?

675
01:13:23,954 --> 01:13:26,680
Hey, you must be William's friend.

676
01:13:28,887 --> 01:13:30,442
I'm Cherry. Nice to meet you.

677
01:13:31,115 --> 01:13:33,670
Hi Cherry. I'm... I'm Mike.

678
01:13:34,630 --> 01:13:37,240
Do you know where he is today?

679
01:13:39,639 --> 01:13:40,598
Oh, he's... um...

680
01:13:42,325 --> 01:13:44,391
I haven't seen him in a while.

681
01:13:45,830 --> 01:13:48,749
I don't think he's gonna be
around here anymore.

682
01:13:49,037 --> 01:13:52,681
- Has he gone away?
- Yeah.

683
01:13:53,161 --> 01:13:55,995
- He has.
- I knew he would.

684
01:13:56,380 --> 01:13:59,831
I'm so happy for him. He was never
happy around here.

685
01:14:02,805 --> 01:14:05,148
He's probably where he
wants to be.

686
01:14:08,698 --> 01:14:10,434
Nice to meet you, Cherry.

687
01:14:11,682 --> 01:14:12,641
You too.

688
01:15:16,802 --> 01:15:19,528
Hey Mike. You got a minute?

689
01:15:20,584 --> 01:15:21,543
Yeah.

690
01:15:22,311 --> 01:15:26,188
- How you been?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

691
01:15:28,970 --> 01:15:32,091
Look mate, if I'd... if I knew you were...

692
01:15:32,092 --> 01:15:35,842
...there's no way I would have said
any of the stuff that I said.

693
01:15:36,610 --> 01:15:37,569
It's okay.

694
01:15:38,721 --> 01:15:39,997
So are we good?

695
01:15:41,821 --> 01:15:42,780
Yeah.

696
01:16:08,876 --> 01:16:11,072
That was great, Stuart and Hayley.
Thank you.

697
01:16:13,087 --> 01:16:15,482
Okay, let's take a 10 minute break.

698
01:16:15,867 --> 01:16:17,794
Mike, can I see you for a moment?

699
01:16:27,769 --> 01:16:29,112
Take a seat, Mike.

700
01:16:33,716 --> 01:16:37,071
Look, I know it's been a tough
few weeks for you, Mike.

701
01:16:39,374 --> 01:16:43,928
Um, I'm really... I really don't know what
to say to you; I'm...

702
01:16:43,929 --> 01:16:46,406
truly, truly sorry.

703
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:49,668
I know he was a good friend to you.

704
01:16:53,313 --> 01:16:57,916
About your project. A tape arrived on my
desk last week,

705
01:16:57,917 --> 01:17:02,548
and it belonged to Will. I know it's not what you
intended to submit, but

706
01:17:02,549 --> 01:17:06,600
it fulfils the criteria, and you'll pass.

707
01:17:06,601 --> 01:17:10,147
You don't have to show it to the
class, but it's your choice.

708
01:17:10,148 --> 01:17:13,867
If you want to... I just thought you
might want to watch it...

709
01:17:14,059 --> 01:17:15,306
...on your own.

710
01:17:25,090 --> 01:17:26,816
Any ideas for the story?

711
01:17:28,257 --> 01:17:30,716
Well, they're not both monsters
until the wolfman...

712
01:17:30,717 --> 01:17:32,739
...transforms at the full moon.

713
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:14,757
<i>Maybe wolfman wants to
share his transformation</i>

714
01:18:14,758 --> 01:18:17,174
<i>with Frankenstein, like in a way
to get closer to him.</i>
