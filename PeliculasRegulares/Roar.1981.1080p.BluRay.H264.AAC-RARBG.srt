1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,646
There's a fire in the
sky in the morning

2
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:11,256
when the Sun is a
crimson dawning..

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,160
And the earth is glowing
like a burning ember.

4
00:00:17,021 --> 00:00:24,100
Who's land is this?
This is my land.

5
00:00:58,498 --> 00:01:01,156
See the shadow of
the eagle in the sunrise

6
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,856
hear the music of the children

7
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,701
in the moon rise
feel the power of the lion

8
00:01:06,726 --> 00:01:10,184
when he roars like thunder

9
00:01:10,277 --> 00:01:18,120
calling who's land is this?
This is my land.

10
00:01:28,418 --> 00:01:35,630
Who's land is this?
This is my land.

11
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:31,876
Okay Pat, hello girl..
O my, what are you doing?

12
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,790
What's that rogue
Togar doing here?

13
00:05:36,329 --> 00:05:38,868
God Togar, why today of all days.

14
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,101
Okay, come on let's play chase.

15
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:16,448
The closer we get,
the more excited I get.

16
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,616
It should be great
to see him after three years.

17
00:06:19,027 --> 00:06:22,942
Yeah, I couldn't believe how fast he
split for Africa after he got his grant.

18
00:06:23,059 --> 00:06:25,793
And the zoo let him take
the little cubs he raised.

19
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:27,879
You'd think he'd
take the kids he raised!

20
00:06:27,942 --> 00:06:30,770
Well he was going to send for us
but he said it was too dangerous.

21
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:33,614
He certainly didn't leave
because he didn't love us.

22
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,570
You know how
depressed he used to get..

23
00:06:35,664 --> 00:06:37,985
with his cats being kept
in cages all the time.

24
00:06:41,787 --> 00:06:44,937
- I wonder where he is..
- Why don't we find our own way there?

25
00:06:45,366 --> 00:06:48,039
- You're joking!
- Where could he be?

26
00:06:52,664 --> 00:06:56,520
Why, you guys wait till my family get
here tonight. Are they gonna love you!

27
00:07:38,394 --> 00:07:41,191
- Sorry Hank.
- And I thought you came to help me.

28
00:07:41,308 --> 00:07:43,792
I did. I come to speak for
you with that committee..

29
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,785
And take you to pick up your family.

30
00:07:45,901 --> 00:07:47,526
Well, come on shore awhile.

31
00:07:47,987 --> 00:07:52,167
Are you crazy? The committee is on
their way here to review your grant.

32
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,206
Monster..

33
00:07:54,284 --> 00:07:56,552
Come on. You gotta
help me clean the house.

34
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,325
Not today! Today doesn't
seem like a good date coming.

35
00:08:01,966 --> 00:08:03,435
Hey, where you going?

36
00:08:12,145 --> 00:08:13,607
Not my jacket!

37
00:08:21,161 --> 00:08:25,437
Throw it here!
Come on over here.

38
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:35,099
- Stay there.
- How's she's doing?

39
00:08:41,073 --> 00:08:41,868
This is a madhouse.

40
00:08:41,893 --> 00:08:45,526
No, it's just like life you
get the funny with the tragic.

41
00:08:45,914 --> 00:08:48,524
Just with them you get the
gentle and the ferocious too.

42
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:51,531
Be careful of the bad
and enjoy the good.

43
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,766
You aren't careful enough.

44
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:55,671
For my studies I have to get
as close to them as possible.

45
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:01,141
No actually,
the closer you get to them

46
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,566
the more they like you,
the safer you'd be.

47
00:09:04,626 --> 00:09:09,259
- But look, it's going to jump on us!
- Oh no no no..

48
00:09:09,826 --> 00:09:11,182
They're just playing...

49
00:09:11,461 --> 00:09:13,768
They like to play the
cat and mouse game.

50
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,510
Here, I'll cover you
O, big Joe...

51
00:09:18,948 --> 00:09:20,948
No, if you just look at them...

52
00:09:21,285 --> 00:09:26,277
- Or you run at them, roar
- O god... no look

53
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:30,871
What?
Na-aah-ah, you leave him alone!

54
00:09:35,885 --> 00:09:39,424
Oh, that's Johnny lion.
You never have to worry about John.

55
00:09:39,635 --> 00:09:41,363
Are you scaring him?

56
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,550
You know you're gotta
watch out for Mark...

57
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,371
No, he's okay.

58
00:09:47,035 --> 00:09:49,261
This is Charlie.
Whoa.

59
00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:53,346
And you gotta watch out
for Barry, okay?

60
00:09:57,027 --> 00:10:00,281
- It's just playing, I'm tellin' ya!
- But you could get killed!

61
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,023
The cats got a little
excited, that's all.

62
00:10:11,664 --> 00:10:14,492
[Mativo] Are you okay?
You're crazy!

63
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:21,549
Oh Mativo, there's Robbie.
You've never met Robbie...

64
00:10:22,135 --> 00:10:24,830
He's always out guarding
his borders in the daytime.

65
00:10:25,104 --> 00:10:28,151
And you're always too afraid to
come and visit me at night...

66
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:32,126
You know, he is the
nicest cat in the world.

67
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,651
And he's also the top cat here.

68
00:10:35,612 --> 00:10:38,940
No, he's the boss,
I work for him.

69
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:43,552
Hey Rob, Wauw Wauw..
Well come here.

70
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:45,980
I want you to meet Mativo.

71
00:10:48,754 --> 00:10:50,816
See, actually it's Robbie
I'm worried about...

72
00:10:50,841 --> 00:10:53,973
Their whole life is eh...
based on dominance...

73
00:10:55,362 --> 00:10:57,332
That why we have such a
great harmony here.

74
00:10:57,402 --> 00:10:59,863
Because Robbie is such
a gentle and loving ruler.

75
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:08,301
He also knows he has to
protect the others from outsiders...

76
00:11:08,965 --> 00:11:11,902
Right now he's very
worried about Togar.

77
00:11:12,051 --> 00:11:16,177
He's also worried that if the others
see that he's worried or afraid...

78
00:11:16,736 --> 00:11:21,602
That then they start challenging him,
like they've been each other all day.

79
00:11:24,766 --> 00:11:27,524
No matter how afraid
he is at this moment...

80
00:11:29,712 --> 00:11:32,056
He still knows he has
to see this through.

81
00:11:33,766 --> 00:11:36,681
The whole meaning of
life is before him, Mativo.

82
00:11:43,256 --> 00:11:45,905
- That's why you have to help me.
- Help what?

83
00:11:46,131 --> 00:11:48,998
- Why?
- Because I have to help him, Mativo.

84
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,451
And he could get killed!

85
00:11:59,154 --> 00:12:00,389
Don't worry, I'm
gonna help you.

86
00:12:00,414 --> 00:12:02,405
I .. I don't think you
should count on me...

87
00:12:04,716 --> 00:12:07,036
But only yesterday they
were so happy.

88
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:08,441
Now look at them.

89
00:12:08,466 --> 00:12:10,770
Finally on the verge
of finding paradise

90
00:12:10,809 --> 00:12:12,406
And the only thing
lacking is my family...

91
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:15,264
To share it with me and
Togar comes in and wrecking it!

92
00:12:15,364 --> 00:12:17,934
Here comes trouble.
It's the grand committee.

93
00:12:18,022 --> 00:12:19,630
But Prentis is with them.

94
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:27,299
Listen' my friend,
let me talk for you.

95
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,604
Good morning everybody

96
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:34,987
I like to open this meeting
by reminding you all...

97
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:38,492
That eh... Hank's
original idea...

98
00:12:38,601 --> 00:12:42,226
Was a comparative study of
the great cats of the world.

99
00:12:42,385 --> 00:12:45,707
And while preserving
the African cats...

100
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,340
In their natural habitat,
he would raise several cats...

101
00:12:49,365 --> 00:12:51,104
..of each species.

102
00:12:51,658 --> 00:12:54,807
Be they African or otherwise.

103
00:12:54,932 --> 00:12:58,362
And to become almost
like a member of the pride.

104
00:12:58,885 --> 00:13:03,471
Hey it has stripes. It must be
another tiger or a liger.

105
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,548
The mother is a lioness
the father must be a tiger.

106
00:13:08,867 --> 00:13:10,658
Say hello to Henry
the jaguar would ya?

107
00:13:10,683 --> 00:13:11,759
Not today!

108
00:13:14,968 --> 00:13:18,861
What are you trying to prove, that you
can have lions socializing with people?

109
00:13:18,892 --> 00:13:21,427
No, but we can't keep
exterminating them.

110
00:13:21,807 --> 00:13:23,900
We can't keep eliminating their land.

111
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:29,006
We can't keep exterminating everything
that we fear or that inconveniences us.

112
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,767
Let the Zoos keep them alive.

113
00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:33,236
Prentis, your actions aren't necessary.

114
00:13:33,283 --> 00:13:34,926
The government knows
there's a better way.

115
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,377
They're moving the people
out of the migration paths.

116
00:13:37,728 --> 00:13:40,746
I don't know what kind of person
could look in the eyes at 200 elephants

117
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,424
And put out those lights ...

118
00:13:42,969 --> 00:13:44,906
They'd run franticly and panic...

119
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,566
Do you think your
lions would run in panic?

120
00:13:46,591 --> 00:13:48,824
Well, you'd better start with me first.

121
00:13:48,849 --> 00:13:51,193
No, I'll start with
the tigers first...

122
00:13:51,624 --> 00:13:54,396
That'll teach you for
bringing them to Africa!

123
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:05,166
I gotta go help your uncle's
they are killing each other.

124
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:14,874
Stop It..
Stop It!!

125
00:14:48,802 --> 00:14:51,787
Togar!
Togar!!

126
00:15:14,607 --> 00:15:18,099
You stay out of it, you
let Robbie take care of him.

127
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:21,740
Yeah, you guys are smart,
you stay out of it.

128
00:15:22,365 --> 00:15:23,375
Oh great..

129
00:15:24,015 --> 00:15:31,170
Hey Tommy, Jimmy
Oh you all hiding here

130
00:15:32,748 --> 00:15:35,906
Oh I don't blame ya.
All those those guys are fighting.

131
00:16:24,716 --> 00:16:26,392
That's my Jacket!

132
00:16:51,062 --> 00:16:53,062
Hank!

133
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:24,210
Hank!
Hank!

134
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,835
Come on go in the house
and get some bandages.

135
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,913
No!!

136
00:18:40,796 --> 00:18:44,286
Oh what the hell's wrong with
you, all you got's a few scratches.

137
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,050
You're lucky I told
her, I didn't get ya.

138
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,813
I think you should take a bus.

139
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,391
It goes right by there..

140
00:18:59,649 --> 00:19:01,383
Oh no, I think we should wait.

141
00:19:01,827 --> 00:19:05,311
No, if you wait until tonight
and he doesn't come...

142
00:19:05,421 --> 00:19:09,413
There's no other bus for 2 days and
there's no place for you to stay here.

143
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:16,624
- Oh what do we do?
- Will he know where to take us?

144
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:45,276
Hey, she's dry.

145
00:19:45,926 --> 00:19:47,496
Alice has no milk.

146
00:19:48,129 --> 00:19:49,722
Listen, I have to go change.

147
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,636
- I'll go wait in my boat
- okay

148
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,683
Oh. Maybe I come with you?

149
00:20:02,551 --> 00:20:05,137
- What we do now?
- Just stand up to them.

150
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,726
Don't let them get
away with anything...

151
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,582
You gotta let them see
how strong you are...

152
00:20:08,651 --> 00:20:11,074
Come on lions we have to clean
the house of Madelaine.

153
00:20:11,691 --> 00:20:13,379
Come on lions

154
00:20:18,205 --> 00:20:22,713
Come on Diane come on, go.
Come on Patrick..

155
00:20:25,345 --> 00:20:29,691
Are you sure there aren't
anymore big ones in here?

156
00:20:34,996 --> 00:20:36,996
Well, hello Gary.

157
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:44,313
Whoa, why didn't you go with ... (roar)
Why didn't you go with your friends?

158
00:20:48,193 --> 00:20:50,474
Come on, you should
go with your friends...

159
00:20:56,679 --> 00:20:57,910
Oh, come on.

160
00:20:58,011 --> 00:21:00,670
You really changed this place.
New curtains, new drapes..

161
00:21:00,703 --> 00:21:01,940
New everything!

162
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:06,196
Come on go with your friends.
Wauw, come on.

163
00:21:06,464 --> 00:21:10,421
Oh yes, ???
Goodbye.

164
00:21:19,459 --> 00:21:20,647
Come on..

165
00:21:21,132 --> 00:21:24,554
Why, don't worry baby,
Robbie can handle Togar.

166
00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:27,632
Your father is
tougher than you think!

167
00:21:31,694 --> 00:21:34,342
Wauw.. Oh come on
you're hurt my hand.

168
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,333
See, my hand hurt.

169
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,080
Come on!
Come on baby.

170
00:21:53,713 --> 00:21:54,916
Wauw!

171
00:21:57,869 --> 00:22:01,016
I've seen that rogue Togar
as far away as 200 miles.

172
00:22:01,078 --> 00:22:03,282
This is the first time he's come in.

173
00:22:04,211 --> 00:22:07,211
I have a hunch that Robbie
and Togar could be brothers.

174
00:22:07,485 --> 00:22:10,461
You know Bugsy and
Robbie we're both rogue lions.

175
00:22:10,578 --> 00:22:12,735
I found them dying
from battle wounds

176
00:22:12,953 --> 00:22:15,170
Now if Togar were sick or dying...

177
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:17,405
These guys would probably except him

178
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:20,077
- But the way he is now...
- ??? arrived.

179
00:22:20,303 --> 00:22:23,216
But he can't help that. As a loner
he's too slow to catch his normal diner.

180
00:22:24,595 --> 00:22:27,423
And the hungrier he gets,
the more desperate he'll get.

181
00:22:27,462 --> 00:22:29,962
And the more desperate he gets,
the more ferocious he gets.

182
00:22:30,045 --> 00:22:32,735
Because the only way he
can eat most of the time...

183
00:22:32,915 --> 00:22:35,642
Is by taking his meals
from whole prides alliance.

184
00:22:37,025 --> 00:22:39,345
You've got to be pretty
ferocious to do that!

185
00:22:39,657 --> 00:22:42,024
Sooner or later he's gonna get killed.

186
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:44,529
Come on, Gary!

187
00:22:45,832 --> 00:22:52,934
♪ Why'd I ever leave Madelaine alone ♪
♪ Make me believe, you'll never leave ♪

188
00:22:54,007 --> 00:23:00,508
♪ It couldn't hurt to pretend ♪
♪ Why'd I ever leave Madelaine alone ♪

189
00:23:08,665 --> 00:23:10,028

190
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,974
Whoa, don't try touching me!

191
00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:17,684
Leave that alone!

192
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:20,372
That's my Jacket...

193
00:23:22,052 --> 00:23:23,513
Give me that..

194
00:23:25,317 --> 00:23:27,529
Hey Hank, come and help me.

195
00:23:32,776 --> 00:23:34,811
Give my jacket!
That's my jacket..

196
00:23:52,332 --> 00:23:54,178
Help!
Help!

197
00:23:59,211 --> 00:24:01,483
Help!
Help!

198
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:22,370
- They almost killed me
- You know you're not supposed to run.

199
00:24:22,605 --> 00:24:25,369
My head knew it,
but my feet didn't.

200
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:32,635
Oh, hi babe.
Oh...

201
00:24:37,892 --> 00:24:41,071
- Putt them out!
- They're trying to stay away from Togar.

202
00:24:41,275 --> 00:24:43,587
- Come on.
- Why'd they have to be in here?

203
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,423
Why this open-door policy
you have in here, anyway?

204
00:24:46,836 --> 00:24:48,582
All the doors are closed
except for here..

205
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,895
And the bathroom

206
00:24:50,206 --> 00:24:52,676
There's nothing they can
tear up here or the bathroom.

207
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:55,656
- Putt them out!
- Mativo, this is their home!

208
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,294
What do you think you're
running, a country club for lions?

209
00:24:58,356 --> 00:25:00,661
Come on, sit down here...

210
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,281
Sit down, you're okay!

211
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:17,804
Sit down. You're okay.
Sit down.

212
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,790
Hey, no more fighting!

213
00:25:32,987 --> 00:25:36,986
Come here.
Oooh, sit down you're okay.

214
00:25:40,132 --> 00:25:42,742
These stupid lions
are frightening me.

215
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:46,226
And you're going to bring
Madelaine and the children to this?

216
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,110
This would be great for them

217
00:25:49,016 --> 00:25:51,555
Not boxed in, like back in Chicago.

218
00:25:55,241 --> 00:25:56,882
Hey, wait a minute...

219
00:26:29,539 --> 00:26:31,812
I just thought he
had a cataract start.

220
00:26:34,397 --> 00:26:36,241
Oh, That's Billy he's great

221
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:40,989
They're right. You must be
on something

222
00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:45,106
I couldn't last a day.
You expect her to sleep with the lions, are you?

223
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,872
What do you care if
I sleep with my wife?

224
00:26:57,344 --> 00:27:01,531
Mom, do you know that a man can
have as many wives as he wants to, here?

225
00:27:02,422 --> 00:27:04,055
And what does that supposed to mean?

226
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,898
I mean, how could you be
away from dad for so long?

227
00:27:07,129 --> 00:27:09,352
You know that your father
and I were having problems

228
00:27:09,633 --> 00:27:11,914
And we thought it would be
better to be apart for a while.

229
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:13,976
You know absence makes
the heart grow fonder.

230
00:27:14,477 --> 00:27:17,422
The heart maybe,
but what about the sex glands?

231
00:27:17,983 --> 00:27:20,364
Sex is all you think
about lately young lady...

232
00:27:20,528 --> 00:27:23,575
You'd better watch it. You're
gonna get your little tail in trouble.

233
00:27:25,192 --> 00:27:29,200
Someday I hope you'll understand the
beauty of restraint and self-denial.

234
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:33,568
Well, I hope it wasn't restraint and
self-denial that drove dad away...

hands over their ears...

00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:49,372

Or they turn on a radio.

Hey Dad!

Hank?

258
00:30:18,774 --> 00:30:20,000
Hello?

259
00:30:20,056 --> 00:30:21,117
Hank?

260
00:30:21,156 --> 00:30:22,281
Dad?

261
00:30:23,516 --> 00:30:24,766
We're here...

262
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,461
Dad?

00:30:31,852 --> 00:30:32,883
Oh dear...

Hey Dad??

Hank?

266
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:56,844
- This is really a nice place.
- Come on up this place is really wild.

267
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:02,086
Oh, I'll give anything
for some sleep.

268
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,617
Oh, I don't understand...

269
00:31:12,335 --> 00:31:13,652
Is that a tarantula?

270
00:31:14,976 --> 00:31:17,976
- You simple-minded jerk!
- Stop that!

271
00:31:51,036 --> 00:31:52,287
Oh my God!

272
00:31:58,447 --> 00:31:59,878
Where could he be?

273
00:32:10,069 --> 00:32:11,921
Jerry, run it up at all the windows

274
00:32:14,164 --> 00:32:16,874
Then we will dust everything
and surprise your father.

275
00:32:42,362 --> 00:32:43,495
Hey a motorcycle.

276
00:32:43,566 --> 00:32:45,894
I saw a thing,
I think it was a pelican.

277
00:32:46,034 --> 00:32:47,355
it's a Kawasaki!

278
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:53,280
Holy mackerel!
Look at that...

279
00:32:55,784 --> 00:32:57,802
I don't believe what I'm seeing

280
00:32:58,928 --> 00:33:02,622
Those can't be Dad's lions.

281
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:18,213
Oh God, look what the cat dragged in!

00:34:13,322 --> 00:34:14,752

285
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:46,578
- Where's Mom and Mel?
- They're downstairs, come on...

286
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:49,195
What the heck is going on down there.

287
00:35:18,615 --> 00:35:21,881
- Alright we got trouble.
- Where they all come from?

288
00:35:28,455 --> 00:35:31,923
Nice lion.
Nice lion!

289
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,410
Oh.

290
00:39:22,888 --> 00:39:25,537
- Now honey you alright?
- Yeah, but I'm scared mom.

00:39:25,677 --> 00:39:27,185
Oh, I know honey so am I

292
00:39:54,307 --> 00:39:56,395
Oh, honey stay here,
I will get the boys.

293
00:39:59,923 --> 00:40:01,830
- Help
- John?

294
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:03,236
I'm in here.

295
00:40:28,435 --> 00:40:30,647
John, you are alright?

296
00:40:34,614 --> 00:40:36,115
Where is Jerry?

297
00:40:36,552 --> 00:40:38,396
Help!

Jerry?

299
00:40:41,299 --> 00:40:43,000
Oh god.

300
00:40:48,462 --> 00:40:50,969
- Are you alright?
- You could have suffocated!

301
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:55,463
- You could've died, dummy.
- Shut up I almost died.

302
00:40:56,315 --> 00:40:58,580
What kind of jerk would
hide himself in an icebox?

303
00:41:08,017 --> 00:41:09,691
Get me outta here!

304
00:41:10,254 --> 00:41:13,035
Help, mom!
John!

305
00:41:13,895 --> 00:41:15,207
Jerry!?

306
00:41:20,594 --> 00:41:25,102
- Get me outta here.
- Come on, one - two - three.

307
00:41:31,954 --> 00:41:35,617
Maybe there's some guns around here.
We gotta find a gun...

308
00:41:35,923 --> 00:41:37,446
I think we have to
split while we can.

309
00:41:37,649 --> 00:41:40,431
Yeah, sure with eight-thousand
lions and tigers outside...

310
00:41:40,602 --> 00:41:43,609
Well, if we stay here we'll
end up being eaten alive.

311
00:41:43,718 --> 00:41:45,328
We're not going to get eaten.

312
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:47,734
When dad gets here he'll
show us how to handle them.

313
00:41:47,759 --> 00:41:49,783
Until then we just
board up the windows.

314
00:41:49,921 --> 00:41:52,013
- Wait a minute who voted you in?
- I did.

315
00:41:52,091 --> 00:41:53,521
I suppose you want
to make a run for it?

316
00:41:53,661 --> 00:41:55,834
Right, I'll take the
motorcycle and go get help.

317
00:41:55,881 --> 00:41:58,013
I know bikes and I know
the road we came in on.

318
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:01,772
That's not gonna help, that's letting
you escape and leaving us here.

319
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:30,450
Give me your handkerchief, John.

320
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:41,168
Oh, I wanna go home.

321
00:44:41,605 --> 00:44:43,119
Madelaine is gonna kill me.

322
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:46,456
It'll go much faster faster if you go
up there and borrow some bicycles.

323
00:44:46,573 --> 00:44:48,784
- Okay!
- I'll take the tigers out.

324
00:44:49,057 --> 00:44:50,807
Go around the back of the village.

325
00:44:50,832 --> 00:45:07,006
(Mativo speaks the local language
explains tigers are passing the village)

326
00:45:28,326 --> 00:45:30,741
Don't tell me he said ...  you said

327
00:45:31,076 --> 00:45:33,010
I'm not interested in your bitterness.

328
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:34,616
Who asked you to go over there?

329
00:45:34,733 --> 00:45:39,022
I can go on any property to kill animals
that I deem are a danger to human lives.

330
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:41,499
Don't tell me you
care about his family!

331
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,261
I'm telling you there'll
be no culling of cats,

332
00:45:44,292 --> 00:45:46,363
elephants or any animal ever again.

333
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:49,948
Well, you should've been at that madhouse
and seen those cats this morning.

334
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,292
I don't care what you've seen.

335
00:45:51,317 --> 00:45:53,792
You're not going to go out
there and slaughtering animals.

336
00:45:53,972 --> 00:45:56,144
Recall elephants if
there are so many

337
00:45:56,269 --> 00:45:58,401
Prentis, you're completely out of line.

338
00:45:58,651 --> 00:46:01,284
you are not going
to kill those cats.

339
00:46:01,354 --> 00:46:02,964
You can tell me what
you're gonna do...

340
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:06,378
And you can tell me what the rest
of this committee is gonna do, Rick.

341
00:46:07,596 --> 00:46:11,253
But I'll be damned if you're gonna
tell me what I'm gonna do.

342
00:46:17,182 --> 00:46:20,721
- We can't escort 2 tigers.
- Well, I try to make them go home.

343
00:46:20,925 --> 00:46:23,214
How come they're not doing
what you're telling them?

344
00:46:23,339 --> 00:46:25,464
Well, they're not trained cats
they're just friends.

345
00:46:28,949 --> 00:46:30,949
Stay off my path...

346
00:46:35,627 --> 00:46:38,802
Come on, where you're going?
Come on down.

347
00:46:39,021 --> 00:46:41,255
You go, I'm not going.

348
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:43,117
You know, you're right.

349
00:46:43,142 --> 00:46:46,340
I can't go to the airport with them,
they'd go right in with me.

350
00:46:46,824 --> 00:46:48,996
Hey, I got an idea for ya...

351
00:46:49,268 --> 00:46:52,433
Hang down off that branch,
let your feet hang down here...

352
00:46:52,458 --> 00:46:52,832
What?

353
00:46:52,857 --> 00:46:55,317
Kick your feet they'll jump right up
and try to get ya and they'll stay here.

354
00:46:55,434 --> 00:46:57,957
- I can sneak away.
- No no, I'll not doing that.

355
00:46:58,979 --> 00:46:59,893
Listen ...

356
00:47:01,493 --> 00:47:03,651
Take your shirt off, okay?

357
00:47:03,807 --> 00:47:05,283
And dangle it down.

358
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:07,706
Hold it by the sleeve.

359
00:47:11,354 --> 00:47:12,752
There you go.

360
00:47:28,393 --> 00:47:29,790

367
00:48:21,902 --> 00:48:24,965
Why did you bring us here?
We're just gonna die!

368
00:48:25,219 --> 00:48:27,129
No, we are not going to die!

369
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,871
Your father's gonna be
here soon and it'll be all over.

370
00:48:29,995 --> 00:48:33,714
Well, why isn't he here now,
he knew we were coming?

371
00:48:34,883 --> 00:48:38,406
You can bellyache all you
want about him staying away

372
00:48:38,548 --> 00:48:41,210
but if he isn't here
it's because he's dead

373
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:43,898
and he's not coming, I know it.

374
00:49:10,701 --> 00:49:13,607
Boy I've been waiting
to do this for a long time.

375
00:49:14,365 --> 00:49:16,005
Don't you think we should wait?

376
00:49:18,278 --> 00:49:22,154
We shouldn't allow anything
smaller than a 30.6 for Lions.

377
00:49:37,496 --> 00:49:39,902
Have you seen my wife and children?

378
00:49:40,285 --> 00:49:42,863
No, I didn't see them

379
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:45,840
I saw a lady and three children.

380
00:49:45,887 --> 00:49:50,012
I told them to catch the bus.

381
00:49:50,395 --> 00:49:51,465
What time?

382
00:49:51,518 --> 00:49:54,902
It was just about 10:30.

383
00:49:57,004 --> 00:49:59,668
Let me borrow your car.

384
00:49:59,723 --> 00:50:01,637
No, I don't have a car.

385
00:50:01,941 --> 00:50:03,004
Leonard?

386
00:50:04,809 --> 00:50:08,301
Oh Leonard...
Leonard ... Leonard.

387
00:50:08,363 --> 00:50:09,410
Okay..

388
00:50:09,812 --> 00:50:28,914
(Leonard gives Hank instructions in their local language)

389
00:50:54,539 --> 00:50:56,335
Come on putt your
bike in the truck.

390
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:59,492
They must be in the house already,
they took the bus yesterday.

391
00:50:59,914 --> 00:51:01,896
Nikki get in the car.
Come on get in back.

392
00:51:02,742 --> 00:51:06,789
Come on Craig get in with us
Come on Craig that's a good boy.

393
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:09,281
Yeah, it's a good boy,
turn around.

394
00:51:19,542 --> 00:51:22,136
He's trying to close me in the trunk!

395
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:24,074
Hey, come on get in...

396
00:51:29,972 --> 00:51:32,956
Hey, well.. come on. Get in!

397
00:51:33,512 --> 00:51:37,010
You're crazy, with them in the back?
They'll bite my head off.

398
00:51:37,307 --> 00:51:38,995
Either get in or walk,
cause I'm going...

399
00:51:39,151 --> 00:51:42,690
Make them walk!
Hank, this is madness.

400
00:51:43,471 --> 00:51:46,495
If somebody sees them this far
from my place, they'll shoot them.

401
00:51:49,158 --> 00:51:51,861
Don't fool yourself!
These are your friends, huh?

402
00:51:51,979 --> 00:51:55,448
And do you know what your friends up 
over are doing to your family right now?

403
00:51:55,995 --> 00:51:57,825
they are making diner of them.

404
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:01,404
- They're eating them!
- Mativo, shut up!

405
00:52:01,642 --> 00:52:04,599
They're sitting around eating
them cracking their bones...

406
00:52:04,771 --> 00:52:07,302
- Shut up!
- They're licking their bones clean.

407
00:52:07,372 --> 00:52:08,474
Shut up!

408
00:52:10,865 --> 00:52:13,460
- Who are you?
- Come on!

409
00:52:42,619 --> 00:52:47,338
- Hey, don't go so fast it's too bumpy.
- I have to Mativo.

410
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:57,476
By the way

411
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,732
Do they know that
they should not run?

412
00:53:00,076 --> 00:53:05,312
You should've sent them a list of rules
and regulations before they came.

413
00:53:14,298 --> 00:53:18,933
Argh, poor Leonard's...

414
00:55:11,045 --> 00:55:13,129
Let's get out of here.

415
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:17,287
I think Melanie was right.
Let's go take the boat.

416
00:55:31,512 --> 00:55:33,512
Jerry, you go first, go ahead.

417
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:07,550
Jerry, you're rowing the wrong way...

418
00:58:09,596 --> 00:58:11,129
Boy that was close..

419
00:58:21,367 --> 00:58:24,695
Get away!
Get away from me!

420
00:59:25,071 --> 00:59:27,684
Help me!
Help me!

421
00:59:43,829 --> 00:59:47,001
Help me!
Help me!

422
01:00:38,657 --> 01:00:41,719
Oh, less than 10 miles to go
and we're stuck!

423
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:44,571
- What's wrong?
- The jack wont wont in the sand..

424
01:00:44,596 --> 01:00:46,477
And the more I dig the
more the car slides...

425
01:00:46,502 --> 01:00:48,883
- Then I'll have to run.
- But you know you're not supposed to run.

426
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:52,508
You hold the Tigers back would you?
So that they don't tackle me.

427
01:00:52,563 --> 01:00:54,032
- What?
- Just use this...

428
01:00:54,219 --> 01:00:57,282
Use this!
Look like that..

429
01:01:24,149 --> 01:01:26,914
Hey, Prentis, did you see that?
I got him right in the neck.

430
01:01:28,219 --> 01:01:29,914
Sooner or later the
lions are gonna get us

431
01:01:29,946 --> 01:01:31,398
I'm gonna go for help.

432
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:34,630
Okay, let's go see if the other
doors in the house are secure.

433
01:01:52,263 --> 01:01:55,620
- John!
- I'm gonna get help.

434
01:01:55,653 --> 01:01:59,636
- And leave us here?
- I tell you it's suicide...

435
01:01:59,847 --> 01:02:01,105
Good luck, son!

436
01:02:19,981 --> 01:02:22,041
Oh no...

437
01:03:49,274 --> 01:03:51,189
Ah, get out here...

438
01:03:55,174 --> 01:03:57,336
Open the door!
Come on!

439
01:03:59,876 --> 01:04:02,696
Go on, get out of here!
Leave it, go on, leave it!

440
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:15,156
- Jerry, open the door! Come on.
- You think I'm crazy?

441
01:04:57,294 --> 01:05:00,028
What kinda jerk would go
off the roof on a motorcycle?

442
01:05:02,501 --> 01:05:04,790
Get off of her!

443
01:05:47,212 --> 01:05:49,361
Hey what are you
doing on the floor?

444
01:05:53,104 --> 01:05:55,104
John, I can't get my leg out.

445
01:05:57,861 --> 01:06:01,424
Come on help her, I hold 'm.
I hold 'm.

446
01:06:03,413 --> 01:06:05,244
Melanie come here...

447
01:06:17,063 --> 01:06:19,063
Oh.
O my goodness!

448
01:06:19,502 --> 01:06:22,320
- Jerry help your sister.
- He just trying to kiss her.

449
01:06:23,297 --> 01:06:25,297
Do it, open the door!

450
01:06:52,301 --> 01:06:54,770
You think we have
enough ammunition?

451
01:06:55,348 --> 01:06:58,316
I've got plenty in this
belt and thirty in the other.

452
01:06:58,949 --> 01:07:02,254
Remember where all the cheetahs,
leopards and tiger drop..

453
01:07:02,472 --> 01:07:04,534
We skin them on the way back.

454
01:07:05,394 --> 01:07:08,753
The Lions are worthless,
leave them for the hyena's

455
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:58,212
Mom, go over the tread...

456
01:13:33,887 --> 01:13:35,887
Come on Mom...

457
01:13:38,452 --> 01:13:41,018
See mom, there's another house.
It's completely safe

458
01:13:41,127 --> 01:13:44,260
That's a good thing because
I can't walk another step.

459
01:13:45,190 --> 01:13:47,893
I'm so tired,
my legs just buckle under me

460
01:13:47,918 --> 01:13:50,229
I just have to sleep for a while...

461
01:14:52,274 --> 01:14:53,624
Oh Donny lion...

462
01:14:56,414 --> 01:14:57,757
Oh Donny...

463
01:14:58,461 --> 01:15:03,282
Come on my friend, get up!
I'll make sure they are ???

464
01:18:22,788 --> 01:18:24,758
Togar get away!!

465
01:18:25,796 --> 01:18:29,750
Oh you... poor stupid jerks!

466
01:18:30,235 --> 01:18:32,235
Togar, get away...

467
01:19:18,876 --> 01:19:20,479
Let's try to get them outside.

468
01:19:26,855 --> 01:19:29,815
I do not think they are
trying to hurt us at all.

469
01:20:06,236 --> 01:20:08,845
Melanie, John get away
from those lions.

470
01:20:08,888 --> 01:20:12,603
Mom, if they wanted to get us they
would have done while we were asleep.

471
01:20:19,213 --> 01:20:21,347
Make sure that his
mother is not around.

472
01:20:39,966 --> 01:20:41,456
They are really friendly.

473
01:20:44,174 --> 01:20:45,931
Oh she's beautiful, isn't she?

474
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:27,570
They're really friendly.

475
01:21:36,498 --> 01:21:39,251
Togar!
Togar!!

476
01:21:40,282 --> 01:21:42,282
Madelaine!

477
01:22:02,859 --> 01:22:04,226
John!

478
01:22:07,314 --> 01:22:08,926
Hello Lion

479
01:22:44,907 --> 01:22:48,898
Togar! ... Togar! ... Togar!!

480
01:22:49,929 --> 01:22:51,929
Madelaine!

481
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:13,223
Hey you guys stay away for a while..

482
01:23:32,306 --> 01:23:34,496
Hey, kids how are ya?

483
01:23:38,434 --> 01:23:40,415
Wauw oh...oh ...oh

484
01:23:48,828 --> 01:23:50,742
I better go help your mom.

485
01:23:56,563 --> 01:23:59,367
Hey, Lynn get off.
Come on get up.

486
01:23:59,848 --> 01:24:03,114
Don't hit her Jerry, hug her
she wants you to hold her.

487
01:24:05,999 --> 01:24:09,217
Are you okay.
I'm so happy you're here.

488
01:24:13,975 --> 01:24:16,271
You're okay
don't worry.

489
01:24:16,654 --> 01:24:18,834
- Don't worry!
- Oh...

490
01:24:29,348 --> 01:24:32,035
Oh, I sure love you.
Oh I love you too!

491
01:24:55,266 --> 01:24:59,860
Hey... Listen don't say anything
about Prentis okay?

492
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:01,485
But he was killing our lions

493
01:25:01,547 --> 01:25:03,039
I don't want you to say
anything about that either.

494
01:25:03,157 --> 01:25:05,383
It will spoil the reunion.
I will tell them later.

495
01:25:05,453 --> 01:25:09,236
Listen, I want you to meet my
family. This is my wife Madelaine.

496
01:25:10,229 --> 01:25:11,729
This my son John.

497
01:25:13,221 --> 01:25:15,702
This is my daughter Melanie.
Melanie.. Mativo.

498
01:25:15,999 --> 01:25:18,304
My son Jerry.
Come on this way.

499
01:25:18,343 --> 01:25:21,718
Listen, I have a surprise for you.
Why? We are glad to see you.

500
01:25:21,921 --> 01:25:24,038
Whaddya all do wearing my clothes?

501
01:25:27,186 --> 01:25:29,186
Oh No, what happened?

502
01:25:31,538 --> 01:25:33,553
Get back, they're lively and
they all want to meet you.

503
01:25:33,663 --> 01:25:35,663
We already met them...

504
01:25:39,710 --> 01:25:41,273
Isn't this fantastic!

505
01:25:41,298 --> 01:25:43,764
What do ya think,

506
01:25:43,932 --> 01:25:47,482
Sure dad. I don't have to be back

507
01:25:55,474 --> 01:26:28,020
