1
00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:41,810
Honey, wake up.

2
00:01:42,896 --> 00:01:45,230
- You sleep okay?
- Oh, me?

3
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:46,648
Never better, like a log.

4
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:48,150
Good, 'cause your shower's ready.

5
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:49,152
Oh, thanks.

6
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,919
Morning.

7
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,174
Morning, Alex.

8
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:13,801
Morning, hi, mommy.

9
00:02:13,802 --> 00:02:14,968
Did you sleep good?

10
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:16,512
Mm-hmm, I'll wake Kenny.

11
00:02:16,513 --> 00:02:19,640
Okay, but don't touch his woobie.

12
00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:20,474
It's gonna be

13
00:02:20,475 --> 00:02:21,308
a beautiful day in Detroit today.

14
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:24,478
Weatherman says we're
going to have sunny skies.

15
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:25,312
Now I'll tell you what,

16
00:02:25,313 --> 00:02:26,188
there's a lot of traffic out there.

17
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:27,856
A lot of beautiful cars, though.

18
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:29,316
We want you to roll up the window,

19
00:02:29,317 --> 00:02:31,026
lean back and enjoy all the good sounds

20
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:32,528
that we're gonna be playing
for you this morning.

21
00:02:32,529 --> 00:02:33,862
Of course you know I
always play your favorites.

22
00:02:33,863 --> 00:02:35,323
Alex, don't, no!

23
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:49,712
Ah, damn it!

24
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:57,804
Morning, baby!

25
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:08,939
Hi, sweetie, how are you?

26
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,482
How did you sleep?

27
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:13,193
Hmm, should we go get daddy?

28
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:14,362
Shall we, oops!

29
00:03:16,823 --> 00:03:17,949
There you are.

30
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:20,534
Morning, good morning.

31
00:03:20,535 --> 00:03:21,994
Morning, campers.

32
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:23,788
How's everybody today?

33
00:03:24,998 --> 00:03:26,707
Hiya, Megan.

34
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:27,834
Great, trucks.

35
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,431
What are we watching here, Kenny?

36
00:03:42,724 --> 00:03:44,184
Robots, thank you.

37
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:48,520
Thanks, babe.

38
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:51,232
Okay, here's the joke of the day.

39
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:54,693
What's green and rides through the west?

40
00:03:54,694 --> 00:03:57,362
The Lone Pickle.

41
00:03:57,363 --> 00:03:59,489
Okay, they're onto me, hon.

42
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,574
We're all onto you, honey.

43
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:03,620
That's them, I gotta go.

44
00:04:06,164 --> 00:04:07,457
Okay, baby, bye.

45
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:09,875
Thanks, don't change a thing.

46
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:11,627
Leave that face exactly
like that, all right?

47
00:04:11,628 --> 00:04:12,461
I don't want it washed by the time

48
00:04:12,462 --> 00:04:15,340
I come home, 'cause it looks great.

49
00:04:29,062 --> 00:04:30,355
Call me later!

50
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:40,447
Oh, man, what's the record

51
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:42,658
for the least amount of sleep ever?

52
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:44,076
I think Lindbergh has it.

53
00:04:44,077 --> 00:04:46,995
Yeah, well, I think
I beat him last night.

54
00:04:46,996 --> 00:04:48,705
You heard anything, Jinx?

55
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:50,540
If I did, wouldn't I tell you guys?

56
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,750
Not necessarily.

57
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:52,584
That's right.

58
00:04:52,585 --> 00:04:53,377
You didn't tell Lou until

59
00:04:53,378 --> 00:04:55,045
after he chipped in for gas money.

60
00:04:55,046 --> 00:04:56,922
Hey, fellas, I'm telling you.

61
00:04:56,923 --> 00:04:57,839
It's as simple as this.

62
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,344
If you can't sell cars,
you can't pay people.

63
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:05,472
Now, come on, come on, relax.

64
00:05:05,473 --> 00:05:08,308
I like splitting gas money four ways.

65
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:42,384
Hey.

66
00:05:42,385 --> 00:05:43,719
Hey, Butler.

67
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,845
How you doin', gents?

68
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:46,638
Havin' a good time?

69
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,472
I love it.

70
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:48,682
You know, I love comin' down here,

71
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:51,059
watchin' something go
from the drawing board

72
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,269
to the assembly line.

73
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,270
It's a treat.

74
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:54,563
Yeah, it's thrilling for us too.

75
00:05:54,564 --> 00:05:56,857
Yeah, real thrilling.

76
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:57,941
What's the matter, boys?

77
00:05:57,942 --> 00:05:58,942
You look depressed.

78
00:05:58,943 --> 00:06:00,402
You worried about the Lions?

79
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:02,821
They're slow starters, don't
worry, it's pre-season.

80
00:06:02,822 --> 00:06:05,365
Hey, we ain't worried about the Lions!

81
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:07,951
What we're worried about is the lines.

82
00:06:07,952 --> 00:06:08,785
Amen.

83
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:10,162
Lines?

84
00:06:10,163 --> 00:06:12,831
Yeah, unemployment lines, welfare lines,

85
00:06:12,832 --> 00:06:14,791
food lines, you know, those lines?

86
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:16,002
Lines, lines.

87
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:17,712
Yeah.

88
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:20,881
Me and my wife went to the
movies the other night.

89
00:06:20,882 --> 00:06:22,549
We saw Rocky.

90
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,427
And I'm watching this
movie and I'm thinking

91
00:06:25,428 --> 00:06:26,928
there's something about
this movie that reminds me

92
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:29,056
of the situation at work, you know?

93
00:06:29,057 --> 00:06:30,932
Which Rocky was it?

94
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:33,226
One or two or three?

95
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:34,478
Uh, one, I think.

96
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:35,312
I don't know.

97
00:06:35,313 --> 00:06:37,439
Who was he fightin'?

98
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,024
Hey, did he have a mohawk?

99
00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:40,108
Like Mr. T?

100
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:41,443
I don't know, I don't remember.

101
00:06:41,444 --> 00:06:43,445
The point is, here's a guy who's taking

102
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:44,988
a pretty bad beating, you know?

103
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:47,282
He's up against the ropes, his eye's cut--

104
00:06:47,283 --> 00:06:49,534
Was his manager dead or alive?

105
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:51,244
- Yeah.
- All right, forget Rocky.

106
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,455
Forget I brought it up,
get it outta your head.

107
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:57,543
The point is, when you're down,
you're not necessarily out.

108
00:06:58,711 --> 00:07:01,923
You know, I mean, you gotta hang tough.

109
00:07:04,801 --> 00:07:06,593
I don't know.

110
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:08,553
Jack Butler,
report to the staff office.

111
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:11,139
I gotta go, guys, see you later.

112
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,474
Well, hang tough, baby.

113
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:13,683
Yeah, be Rocky!

114
00:07:18,898 --> 00:07:20,440
They're gonna knock him out, baby.

115
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:21,316
Think so?

116
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:23,111
He didn't see Rocky.

117
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:32,035
Larry!

118
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:32,829
Larry!

119
00:07:35,915 --> 00:07:37,165
Are you crazy?

120
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,458
What'd you do that for?

121
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:40,544
Why didn't you tell me this
morning I was being canned?

122
00:07:40,545 --> 00:07:42,921
I couldn't say anything
until it was official!

123
00:07:42,922 --> 00:07:43,755
Wait a minute!

124
00:07:43,756 --> 00:07:46,050
Wait a minute, guys, wait.

125
00:07:47,218 --> 00:07:48,010
Oh, Jinx.

126
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:51,721
You did it, didn't you?

127
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:54,516
You fired these guys after
all they've contributed.

128
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:56,351
- Jack.
- Aw, don't "Jack" me.

129
00:07:56,352 --> 00:07:57,310
After the support!

130
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:58,186
Jack.

131
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:00,480
Aw, man, after the
devotion they gave you.

132
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:01,523
You're fired too.

133
00:08:01,524 --> 00:08:02,984
Now you fire me.

134
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:04,902
I'm fired?

135
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:08,738
You son of a bitch!

136
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:09,866
I'll kill ya!

137
00:08:11,868 --> 00:08:13,410
You're not fired.

138
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:14,995
Technically furloughed.

139
00:08:14,996 --> 00:08:16,079
Why don't you give me a break!

140
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,667
I'm telling you, there's
blood all over my slide rule!

141
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:22,294
None of it's yours, Jinx.

142
00:08:22,295 --> 00:08:24,212
Come on, come on.

143
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:25,130
Something's gonna turn up.

144
00:08:25,131 --> 00:08:27,090
You guys are terrific engineers.

145
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:30,010
You're too damn good not
to catch on somewhere.

146
00:08:30,011 --> 00:08:31,511
Where am I gonna catch on, Jake?

147
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:32,304
Where we gonna catch on?

148
00:08:32,305 --> 00:08:33,221
Nagasaki?

149
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:34,598
The Ruhr Valley?

150
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:37,851
You're not exactly walking
out of here empty-handed.

151
00:08:37,852 --> 00:08:39,644
You've got your full severance.

152
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:42,355
You got your profit sharing.

153
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:43,190
Here.

154
00:08:43,191 --> 00:08:44,066
Guess what.

155
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:45,943
A surprise.

156
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:51,991
Full pro rata refund for this month's gas.

157
00:08:53,117 --> 00:08:54,409
Great.

158
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,994
There's only one more thing I want.

159
00:08:55,995 --> 00:08:57,412
- What's that?
- Disability!

160
00:08:57,413 --> 00:08:58,246
Oh, no!

161
00:08:58,247 --> 00:08:59,123
No, oh, no!

162
00:09:00,124 --> 00:09:01,249
- No!
- Larry!

163
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,167
Larry!

164
00:09:02,168 --> 00:09:03,585
Come on!

165
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:05,587
Keep that sense of humor,
buddy, it's critical.

166
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:06,630
Hey, Jinx!

167
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:07,464
Oh, no!

168
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:08,298
Hold it!

169
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:09,716
Larry!

170
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:11,551
Get the valium.

171
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:16,389
♫ Plop, plop, fizz, fizz
oh, what a relief it is

172
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:24,147
Jack, keep in touch.

173
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:25,398
I will, Larry.

174
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,692
You all right?
- Oh, yeah.

175
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:29,819
Okay, 'cause remember what Jinx said.

176
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,238
Keep that sense of humor.

177
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:33,406
It's critical.
- It's critical.

178
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:34,617
Love you, Jack!

179
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:47,796
Alex, Kenny, come on.

180
00:09:47,797 --> 00:09:48,797
Hurry up!

181
00:09:48,798 --> 00:09:50,298
That's good, step to.

182
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:53,635
Hup, two, three, four, that's it.

183
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:54,427
Nice, boys.

184
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:56,096
You look real nice.

185
00:09:56,097 --> 00:09:58,223
Does daddy know he got fired yet?

186
00:09:58,224 --> 00:09:59,474
Yes, he knows but we're not gonna

187
00:09:59,475 --> 00:10:00,850
mention it to him, are we, honey?

188
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:02,644
We want daddy to feel good, don't we?

189
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:03,687
You hear that?

190
00:10:03,688 --> 00:10:04,521
He's coming now.

191
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:06,273
Everybody smile real big.

192
00:10:06,274 --> 00:10:07,066
Hi, dad!

193
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:10,236
Hey.

194
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:12,362
Hi.

195
00:10:12,363 --> 00:10:13,989
Boy, you guys look nice.

196
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:18,785
What, do you all have dates or something?

197
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:20,954
We heard you got fired.

198
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:22,247
Laid off.

199
00:10:22,248 --> 00:10:23,665
Just laid off, honey, remember?

200
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,292
Technically, furloughed, sport.

201
00:10:25,293 --> 00:10:26,835
You're not a bum, are you, daddy?

202
00:10:26,836 --> 00:10:28,128
No, but I'm workin' on it.

203
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:30,463
You want my Woobie?

204
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:31,673
Actually, I kinda would like it.

205
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:34,010
But instead I'll take a kiss.

206
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:36,761
Okay, come on, everybody.

207
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:37,971
Let's eat dinner.

208
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:39,389
We're having special dinner tonight.

209
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,307
What are we having?

210
00:10:40,308 --> 00:10:41,933
- Colonel Chicken.
- We can't afford that!

211
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:44,979
Let's enjoy it, it may be our last.

212
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:07,167
You know, I know this sounds crazy,

213
00:11:07,168 --> 00:11:08,960
but I actually feel great.

214
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:09,836
I don't know why.

215
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:11,671
I don't know why, but I feel great.

216
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:12,547
I do, you know.

217
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:14,799
Because, I don't know,
now I'll have the time

218
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,468
to do some work around the house

219
00:11:16,469 --> 00:11:17,469
I've been wanting to get to.

220
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,220
And, you know, we're in pretty good shape.

221
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:21,723
Yep, we are, for a while.

222
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:22,599
Wait, what do you think?

223
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,184
I'll never get another job again?

224
00:11:24,185 --> 00:11:25,352
Don't worry about it.

225
00:11:25,353 --> 00:11:27,520
I already put the word out.

226
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:30,315
What would you say if I did too?

227
00:11:30,316 --> 00:11:32,400
Did too do what?

228
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:34,194
I put the word out.

229
00:11:34,195 --> 00:11:36,029
I mean I have a couple of years'
experience in advertising.

230
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,113
I have a college degree.

231
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:39,157
There's no reason I shouldn't
try to get a job myself.

232
00:11:39,158 --> 00:11:40,867
Wait a minute, excuse me,
have I been missing something?

233
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:43,244
I mean, has your phone
been ringing off the hook?

234
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:44,120
Well, no, Jack.

235
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:46,081
You think you're gonna
get a job before I do?

236
00:11:46,082 --> 00:11:47,415
Oh, Jack, this isn't a contest.

237
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,458
No, hon, this'll be good.

238
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:49,334
This is a good idea.

239
00:11:49,335 --> 00:11:50,210
We'll make it a contest.

240
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:51,044
- What?
- It'll be fun.

241
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:52,754
I'll bet you a hundred to one

242
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:54,547
you don't get a job before I do.

243
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:56,091
- Jack--
- Okay, come on, doll face.

244
00:11:56,092 --> 00:11:57,092
Give me a dollar.

245
00:11:57,093 --> 00:11:58,176
I don't even have a dollar.

246
00:11:58,177 --> 00:11:59,761
Oh, you wanna bet, but
you don't have a dollar?

247
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:00,762
Hey, I don't wanna bet.

248
00:12:00,763 --> 00:12:02,180
Hey, I thought somebody
said they wanted to bet.

249
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:03,056
Wait till I get the kids.

250
00:12:03,057 --> 00:12:04,808
I don't bet, I don't take
bets, I don't believe in bets.

251
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:06,559
You're bettin' now, Alex, Kenny!

252
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,353
Come here.

253
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:14,067
I want you to know it's comin'
out of my severance pay too.

254
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:15,151
Come on, guys, hurry.

255
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:16,111
This is gonna be fun.

256
00:12:16,112 --> 00:12:17,612
Guess what, I'm makin' mommy a bet.

257
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:21,116
Daddy's betting mommy 100
dollars to just her one dollar...

258
00:12:21,117 --> 00:12:21,950
Wow.

259
00:12:21,951 --> 00:12:23,576
That she doesn't get a job before me.

260
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:24,994
Kenny, hold the money.

261
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:26,287
I better hold it, dad.

262
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:27,872
Money makes him crazy.

263
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:30,041
- Good point.
- It isn't healthy.

264
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:32,043
Well, it may not be healthy,
but it's fun, right, guys?

265
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:33,336
- Oh, Jack.
- Dad, can we bet too?

266
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:34,380
Absolutely!

267
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:41,095
Take the money, Caroline.

268
00:12:42,138 --> 00:12:44,515
Jack, I don't want the money.

269
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:46,933
Look, you won.

270
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:48,101
A bet's a bet!

271
00:12:48,102 --> 00:12:51,146
Jack, I don't take bets,
and I don't want your money.

272
00:12:51,147 --> 00:12:52,647
Aren't you being a
little hard on yourself?

273
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:53,815
No, it's fine!

274
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:55,150
I mean, you have applied to everything

275
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:56,651
on wheels from Toyota to Schwinn.

276
00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:59,821
You're gonna get a job
any day now, really.

277
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:01,197
Uh-oh, I'm going to be late.

278
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:02,031
My first day.

279
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:03,908
I want to make a very good impression.

280
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:05,035
How do I look?

281
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:07,454
You look great.

282
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,831
You're gonna make a great impression.

283
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:12,834
Now, do you wanna go over
that list one more time?

284
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:15,545
No, I don't wanna go over the list!

285
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:17,422
Okay, let's go over the list.

286
00:13:17,423 --> 00:13:19,257
Remember, when Kenny starts talking to

287
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:21,509
his breakfast, that means
he's finished, right?

288
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,011
Alex has to school at 7:30.

289
00:13:23,012 --> 00:13:24,929
- His pickup is 1:00 sharp.
- 1:00.

290
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,306
When Megan starts
rubbing her little ears,

291
00:13:26,307 --> 00:13:27,515
it means it's time for her nap.

292
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:29,142
But don't let her sleep past 11:30,

293
00:13:29,143 --> 00:13:31,019
because then she won't go
down for her afternoon nap.

294
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,687
Nap, 1:00, okay.

295
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:34,606
Wait a minute, will
she rub her ears again?

296
00:13:34,607 --> 00:13:36,649
No, just in the morning.

297
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,610
And please don't let her
sit around in a wet diaper.

298
00:13:38,611 --> 00:13:39,527
Obviously, hon.

299
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:41,279
Kenny, he'll pretty
much take care of himself,

300
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,405
won't you, honey?

301
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:43,364
I mean, just keep him busy.

302
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:45,658
Give him his tinkertoys
or his coloring book.

303
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:48,453
I think Alex will be a little
helper, won't you, honey?

304
00:13:48,454 --> 00:13:49,287
Sweetie.

305
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:50,872
All right, just relax,
you're gonna be great.

306
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:52,415
There's nothing to this, you know.

307
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,917
Hon, we got it covered, right, guys?

308
00:13:53,918 --> 00:13:55,001
Okay.

309
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:57,797
Oh, boy, am I gonna miss you guys.

310
00:13:58,714 --> 00:13:59,756
Take it easy on daddy.

311
00:13:59,757 --> 00:14:00,715
Remember, he's a rookie.

312
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:01,758
Bye, mom.

313
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:02,967
Bye, honey.

314
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:04,135
- Mommy?
- Yes?

315
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:06,888
It's a jungle out there.

316
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:08,973
Very funny, Jack.

317
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:10,433
What, I don't know where he gets this.

318
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:11,893
On second thought, I
will take this money.

319
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:14,229
I might need it for
lunch or something special.

320
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,022
Okay.

321
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:17,565
Actually, a lot of
men would love to have

322
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:19,234
this kind of time to
spend with their kids.

323
00:14:19,235 --> 00:14:21,194
Hon, you're looking at one.

324
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:23,446
I'm telling you, I'm a
regular Phil Donahue here.

325
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:24,657
Yes, you are.

326
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:26,951
Okay, okay.

327
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:29,745
Come here.
- Okay.

328
00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:34,291
Go get 'em.

329
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:39,338
Oh, thanks for the loan.

330
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:52,725
- Dad, you passed it!
- Passed what?

331
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:53,893
We're right on time.

332
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:56,062
But you're doing it wrong.

333
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:58,356
Mommy doesn't do it like this.

334
00:14:58,357 --> 00:14:59,983
We're gonna do it
the Jack Butler method.

335
00:14:59,984 --> 00:15:01,484
What is this?

336
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:02,318
This is nuts.

337
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:11,953
Why are they all honking?

338
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:14,581
Because you're doing it wrong.

339
00:15:14,582 --> 00:15:15,707
Tell me I'm doing it wrong.

340
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,501
I know how to do this.

341
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:25,509
Hi, Jack, I'm Annette.

342
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,303
Hi.

343
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:30,847
You're doing it wrong.

344
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:31,640
See?

345
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,726
This is what I tell all my new mommies:

346
00:15:34,727 --> 00:15:37,812
We enter from the south
and we exit from the north.

347
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:40,189
And we do just the
reverse when we pick up.

348
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,357
This way our little
ones don't have to walk

349
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,985
between the cars to get
to the learning facility.

350
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:47,530
Okay, move it out, and
remember, south to drop off,

351
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:48,948
north to pick up.
Pick 'em up.

352
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,992
Okay, that's a good system.

353
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:57,582
South to drop off, moron!

354
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:32,158
Actually, I'm very excited to be going

355
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,410
back to work, especially here with Ron.

356
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:35,620
Ron?

357
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:37,997
And who would Ron be?

358
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:40,041
Oh, Ron Richardson.

359
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:42,585
Everyone here at the
Richardson-Frankel agency

360
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:44,630
calls him Mr. Richardson.

361
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:47,590
Well, he asked me to call him Ron.

362
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:49,008
And when was that?

363
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,927
In what context?

364
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:54,806
In the context of my interview at lunch.

365
00:16:54,807 --> 00:16:55,640
Lunch?

366
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:56,433
Mm-hmm.

367
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,852
Well, now, before we go in here,

368
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,521
let me give you some advice.

369
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:03,564
Keep your mouth shut and your ears open,

370
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:06,234
and you just might learn something.

371
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:17,871
You want to knock it off?

372
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:24,128
Ron, what is your position?

373
00:17:27,423 --> 00:17:28,382
Thank you.

374
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,639
My father founded this
agency on Schooner Tuna.

375
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:40,768
It's the cornerstone of all our accounts.

376
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:42,229
So my position is,

377
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:46,149
somebody better figure out a way to

378
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,278
sell some tuna fish pretty damn quick.

379
00:17:54,158 --> 00:17:56,285
We have people to do that.

380
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,329
Sorry.

381
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,789
Habit.

382
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,668
Everybody please
welcome Caroline Butler.

383
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:07,629
- Hello.
- Hi, Caroline.

384
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:10,840
Since you're probably
the only one in the room

385
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:13,468
that got a decent night's sleep,

386
00:18:13,469 --> 00:18:15,970
maybe you could have a fresh opinion.

387
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:20,100
Do, any of these layouts, does
anything make sense to you?

388
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:25,104
I'm not qualified to
judge anything, really.

389
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:26,481
It's my first day, and--

390
00:18:26,482 --> 00:18:27,732
You ever eat tuna fish?

391
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:28,525
Yes.

392
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:31,070
You're qualified.

393
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:36,032
Okay, well...

394
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:37,242
Let's see here.

395
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:42,830
Well, this is very good.

396
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:44,707
I like, it's mermaids?

397
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:45,625
Original.

398
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:46,459
Caroline.

399
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:50,129
"Yum, yum, tuna bits."

400
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,005
That's very funny.

401
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:52,216
Cut the crap.

402
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:54,426
Right.

403
00:18:55,928 --> 00:18:59,639
Look, you want me to be
really honest with you, Ron?

404
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,016
No, lie to him.

405
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:03,351
He likes it.

406
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:08,606
Well, frankly, none of this
stuff would influence me.

407
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:09,399
All right?

408
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:11,443
That's good.

409
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:14,946
Come on, Ron.

410
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:17,990
She doesn't know a tuna
fish from a Cheerio.

411
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:20,618
Damn good thing we don't
have the Cheerio account.

412
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:25,748
When was the last time any of

413
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:27,375
you people were in a supermarket?

414
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:33,089
Good morning, shoppers.

415
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,966
We have some specials in
the store this morning,

416
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:36,926
and we'd like to let you know about them.

417
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:40,054
Over in the frozen food section--

418
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:41,472
Kenny, where are the eggs?

419
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:42,557
Over there, dad.

420
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,814
I have the right of way.

421
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:51,024
Right, sorry.

422
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:53,609
Here.

423
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,528
We'll settle out of court.

424
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:56,572
Oh, weirdo.

425
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:02,785
Irv,
clean up in aisle four.

426
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:05,414
Aisle four, check.

427
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:12,378
Irv, clean up in produce!

428
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,881
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

429
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:17,592
Kenny, did I tell you not
to touch the grapefruit?

430
00:20:17,593 --> 00:20:18,593
Next.

431
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:20,970
May I have a half a pound of ham?

432
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:22,847
Boiled, baked, smoked, salt-cured,

433
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:25,266
sugar-cured, prosciutto or westphalian?

434
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:26,100
All right, forget it.

435
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:28,603
Just tell you what, just give me,

436
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:30,563
give me a half pound of salami.

437
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:32,940
Italian, kosher, hard, pork,

438
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:34,568
beef, cotto or what?

439
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,404
Just get bologna, mister.

440
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:39,280
I'll tell you what.

441
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:42,909
Just give me a quarter pound of cheese.

442
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,453
American, bleu, cream, cottage,

443
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:48,623
gouda, edam, provolone, romano, swiss.

444
00:20:48,624 --> 00:20:50,708
You have your entire cheddar family.

445
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:53,794
Can you run the hams back one more time?

446
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:54,922
I just want...

447
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:03,054
Stay right here, okay?

448
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:04,014
Comin' back.

449
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:16,734
Half pound of salami, half pound of swiss,

450
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:20,321
half pound Virginia ham, two celery.

451
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:21,614
I think these are on special.

452
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:22,990
Doesn't matter, sorry, go ahead.

453
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:23,991
Let me check.

454
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:26,911
Irv, are these Kotex maxi pads on special?

455
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,996
Never mind, Irv, sorry, forget it.

456
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:30,665
Kotex, 19 cents off.

457
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:31,792
Thanks, Irv.

458
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:34,711
All right, Ken.

459
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,630
My baby!

460
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:38,798
Who are you?

461
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:39,591
Steven.

462
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:42,134
Mom!

463
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:43,761
Kenny!

464
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:45,346
Ken!

465
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:46,347
Mom!

466
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:48,599
Here, eat this spaghetti.

467
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,811
Irv,
spaghetti on aisle nine.

468
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:54,814
Spaghetti, aisle nine, check.

469
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:55,607
Kenny!

470
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:59,610
Hey, I'll trade ya.

471
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:02,238
My kid for yours.
Thank you.

472
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:04,032
I don't have any kids!

473
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:09,453
Did you see my little girl?

474
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:11,330
Yeah, she's adorable.

475
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:12,832
She's lost.

476
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,209
You left a child in a shopping cart?

477
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,503
Irv, one lost child.

478
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:20,089
Lost child alert.

479
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,300
There she is!

480
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,510
There's your daddy.

481
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:26,387
She's yours and I'm Joan.

482
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:27,179
Hi, thanks.

483
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,848
Caroline told me you'd be around.

484
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:30,349
- Yeah.
- Can I give you a hand?

485
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,225
You can give me both of 'em.

486
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:32,727
I don't know what the hell I'm doin'.

487
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:35,646
Irv,
clean up on aisle seven!

488
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:38,024
Irv, we were never in aisle seven.

489
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:39,775
I'm tellin' ya, honest!

490
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:41,694
Not so easy, is it?

491
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:43,195
Boy, I'll say.

492
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:45,740
Might even be the toughest
job in the entire world.

493
00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:47,616
Bends your back, drives you nuts,

494
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:50,536
and it makes your boobs droop.

495
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:54,373
So don't be ashamed about asking for help.

496
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:57,668
Mommy training can be very,
very tricky, and I can help

497
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:00,129
with sitters and shopping and menus,

498
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,924
and even if you just want to talk.

499
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:06,969
Here's my number.
All right, thank you.

500
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,764
I'm sorry, what's this
say underneath here?

501
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:10,640
Any time.

502
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:13,976
Okay.

503
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:16,062
Kenny, what are you doing?

504
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:21,567
♫ He's married

505
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:23,986
♫ So were we once

506
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:37,918
♫ Oh, Susanna oh, don't you cry for me

507
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:41,670
♫ 'Cause I come from Alabama

508
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:44,298
♫ With my banjo on my knee

509
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:46,050
Where is everybody?

510
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:47,301
Up here.

511
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:49,553
♫ Susanna

512
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:52,306
♫ Oh, don't you cry for me

513
00:23:52,307 --> 00:23:53,432
♫ We're coming

514
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:55,893
Hi, everybody, mommy's home.

515
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:56,853
Hi, mommy.

516
00:23:58,105 --> 00:23:59,688
How was your day?

517
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:02,150
Oh, it was, it was terrible.

518
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:06,028
I mean, I wasn't there
five minutes and I was thrown

519
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:07,905
into this meeting with
people yelling and screaming

520
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:09,573
at each other, and then
they were screaming at me,

521
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:11,909
and there's a secretary
that hates me for no reason.

522
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,577
Want me to go and kick
a little ass, honey?

523
00:24:13,578 --> 00:24:15,871
Yeah, dad!

524
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,705
All right.

525
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:20,251
The only one that was
even civil to me was Ron.

526
00:24:20,252 --> 00:24:21,085
Ron?

527
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:22,753
You know, Mr. Richardson?

528
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:24,505
I mean, he actually asked for my opinion,

529
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:25,631
and when I told him honestly

530
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:28,384
how I felt about something,
Ron liked what I had to say.

531
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:29,218
He did.

532
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:31,470
Ron and his group are flying
to the plant tomorrow,

533
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:34,849
and they're gonna tour it,
and I was invited to go.

534
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:37,726
Is that an unbelievable
first day on the job or what?

535
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:38,561
I can't believe it.

536
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:39,520
How 'bout you guys?

537
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:42,107
I can't believe it.

538
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:44,900
We can't believe it,
here, hon, none of us can.

539
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:46,027
We're stunned.

540
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:51,490
Honey, I can't believe this.

541
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:55,245
Oh, well, I didn't
want his feet to get wet.

542
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:06,589
Somebody must have died.

543
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,548
Why?

544
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:08,841
There's a limousine out front.

545
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:09,800
Oh.

546
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:11,969
You didn't say anything
about a limousine last night.

547
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,220
Ron said he was sending a car,

548
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:15,264
but he didn't say anything about a limo!

549
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:17,559
Tell him I'll be right down.

550
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:20,811
Ron.

551
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:21,605
Oh, Ron.

552
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:23,315
Hey, Ron.

553
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:28,361
Whoa.

554
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:31,280
Damn it.

555
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:38,579
Well, hello down there.

556
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,331
Why don't you run and tell your mommy

557
00:25:40,332 --> 00:25:42,708
that Mr. Richardson is here.

558
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:43,584
Stay right here.

559
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:47,422
I'm not supposed to let
strangers in the house.

560
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:06,941
How you doin'?

561
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:08,609
You must be Ron Richardson.

562
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,401
I'm Jack Butler.

563
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:10,736
Nice to meet you.

564
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:13,113
Pleased to meet you.

565
00:26:13,114 --> 00:26:14,323
Huh?

566
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:16,909
I said, I'm pleased...

567
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:19,203
to meet you.

568
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:21,121
I'm just waiting for Caroline.

569
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:23,416
Well, Ron, you know women.

570
00:26:25,043 --> 00:26:27,420
Yeah, I like to think I do.

571
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,589
Want a beer?

572
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,759
It's 7:00 in the morning.

573
00:26:33,885 --> 00:26:34,678
Scotch?

574
00:26:35,595 --> 00:26:37,221
Not during working hours.

575
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:39,640
Oh, I'm sorry, pal.

576
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:40,516
No problem.

577
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:41,350
Come on over here, Ron.

578
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:42,393
Let me show you what I'm doin'.

579
00:26:42,394 --> 00:26:43,477
Takin' advantage of some of the time

580
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:46,313
off to add a whole new wing on here.

581
00:26:46,314 --> 00:26:49,608
I'm gonna rip these walls out,
and, of course, rewire it.

582
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:52,611
You gonna make it all 220?

583
00:26:52,612 --> 00:26:53,779
Yeah, 220, 221.

584
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,240
Whatever it takes.

585
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:59,118
You sound like a pretty handy guy.

586
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:02,454
Yeah, well, I like to do a
little bit of everything, Ron.

587
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:05,083
I write poetry, I paint, sculpt.

588
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:09,920
Oh, Caroline.

589
00:27:09,921 --> 00:27:11,505
Don't you look nice.

590
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:12,339
Thanks.

591
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,507
I'm sorry if I kept you waiting.

592
00:27:13,508 --> 00:27:14,341
Oh, not at all.

593
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:17,136
I was just having a little
chat here with your hubby.

594
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:18,763
Jack.

595
00:27:20,307 --> 00:27:22,309
Yeah, he's quite a guy.

596
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,688
So, I guess we better get going.

597
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:28,689
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

598
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:29,773
Jack, a real pleasure.

599
00:27:29,774 --> 00:27:30,609
Ron.

600
00:27:39,284 --> 00:27:40,659
Very nice outfit, honey.

601
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,620
Thank you.

602
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:49,084
Honey, if you call and I'm not here,

603
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:52,213
I'll be at the gym or at the gun club.

604
00:27:58,928 --> 00:28:01,138
How'd you like a little
trim on that mustache, Ron?

605
00:28:04,017 --> 00:28:05,100
Humphries is tough.

606
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:07,102
He's probably the
toughest client we've got.

607
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:10,689
But, you know, I think you've
got two things going for you.

608
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,566
Number one, your
experience as a homemaker.

609
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:15,819
You're fresh from the
trenches of consumerism.

610
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,113
Oh, thank you very much.

611
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:19,740
Oh, boy.

612
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:22,327
And, number two, you've got a...

613
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:29,750
Let's just say you're an
extremely attractive woman.

614
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:31,919
Well, thank you.

615
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,546
And my husband thanks you too.

616
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:38,759
Yeah, I'm glad you
brought up, what's his name?

617
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,679
Jack.

618
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:43,263
What do you mean?

619
00:28:43,264 --> 00:28:45,474
I mean we're gonna be
working long, hard hours,

620
00:28:45,475 --> 00:28:48,977
and you might be coming
home pretty late at night.

621
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:52,189
And, well, if there's gonna be a problem,

622
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,525
I want you to tell me about it right now.

623
00:28:56,528 --> 00:28:58,404
Well, there's not gonna
be any problem, see?

624
00:28:58,405 --> 00:29:00,114
Jack supports everything I do.

625
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:04,576
As a woman, in my career, as
an executive, he supports me.

626
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:07,454
And if we can agree
that you are an executive,

627
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:09,957
then you can stop cutting my steak.

628
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:10,750
Oh!

629
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:14,294
Sorry.

630
00:29:50,123 --> 00:29:52,207
I don't think we can fit any more.

631
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:53,418
Sure, we can.

632
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:56,837
We can get some more in there.

633
00:29:56,838 --> 00:29:58,589
You know, when your dad was in the army,

634
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:01,008
we had to run a tight ship.

635
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:04,303
There were no ships in the army.

636
00:30:04,304 --> 00:30:06,138
Just put the laundry in.

637
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:07,931
Dad, can we fix lunch?

638
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:09,308
Sure.

639
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:10,769
Anything but tuna.

640
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:14,063
"Add here."

641
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,787
Wait a minute.

642
00:30:30,747 --> 00:30:33,040
Save a couple of steps here.

643
00:31:00,527 --> 00:31:03,237
Give it everything, I guess.

644
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:24,967
- Butler?
- Hi.

645
00:31:24,968 --> 00:31:27,135
You got a problem with
your horizontal hold?

646
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:27,970
I don't know.

647
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:29,596
Your wife says you do.

648
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:30,556
Well, she ought to know.

649
00:31:30,557 --> 00:31:31,432
Come on in.

650
00:31:42,193 --> 00:31:43,360
I'll be right back.

651
00:31:43,361 --> 00:31:45,028
I get 45 bucks an hour.

652
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:53,453
Oh, Megan, you're makin'
me crazy here, baby.

653
00:31:53,454 --> 00:31:55,330
You're makin' me nuts.

654
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:56,164
Da-da.

655
00:31:56,165 --> 00:31:59,710
Yeah, yeah, I love you
but you're making me crazy.

656
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:01,044
Stay.

657
00:32:01,045 --> 00:32:01,920
Hey, Kenny.

658
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:02,838
Go keep an eye on your sister.

659
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:04,214
Play with her or something, all right?

660
00:32:04,215 --> 00:32:05,174
Go watch TV.

661
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:09,136
You want some chili?

662
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:10,429
No, thanks.

663
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,180
Hey, where's your mom
keep the vacuum cleaner?

664
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:13,433
You mean Jaws?

665
00:32:14,392 --> 00:32:16,685
Mom calls the vacuum cleaner "Jaws"?

666
00:32:16,686 --> 00:32:17,519
Yeah.

667
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,646
Where is it?

668
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:20,689
Over there.

669
00:32:30,825 --> 00:32:31,618
Jaws.

670
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:49,676
Exterminator.

671
00:32:49,677 --> 00:32:51,511
I can't hear you.

672
00:32:51,512 --> 00:32:52,554
Exterminator.

673
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,185
What?

674
00:32:58,186 --> 00:32:59,395
Exterminator!

675
00:33:00,605 --> 00:33:02,689
Go to the front door.

676
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:03,774
Okay.

677
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:12,158
Come in.

678
00:33:14,494 --> 00:33:15,327
Hi.

679
00:33:15,328 --> 00:33:17,162
I'm here to adjust the
pilot on your water heater.

680
00:33:17,163 --> 00:33:18,206
Okay by me.

681
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:20,874
Hi.

682
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:22,167
Anything wrong?

683
00:33:22,168 --> 00:33:23,043
No, no.

684
00:33:23,044 --> 00:33:23,878
Fine, fine.

685
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:13,885
Dad!

686
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:15,095
Dad!

687
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:46,419
Dad!

688
00:34:50,089 --> 00:34:50,840
Dad!

689
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:56,179
Dad, my Woobie!

690
00:34:57,847 --> 00:34:59,181
Okay, Kenny.

691
00:34:59,182 --> 00:35:00,015
Now look.

692
00:35:00,016 --> 00:35:01,309
Run, Kenny, run!

693
00:35:02,226 --> 00:35:03,061
Whoa!

694
00:35:35,843 --> 00:35:36,676
You crazy?

695
00:35:36,677 --> 00:35:38,387
You fed a baby chili?

696
00:36:06,082 --> 00:36:09,293
Where's mommy keep the extra diapers?

697
00:36:12,213 --> 00:36:13,005
Hey!

698
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:14,882
Cowards.

699
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:20,930
Holy mackerel!

700
00:36:22,098 --> 00:36:22,890
Aw, man.

701
00:36:54,297 --> 00:36:55,673
Sorry I'm late.

702
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,892
Well, I'm glad somebody had a good day.

703
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:13,023
Have a seat.

704
00:37:13,024 --> 00:37:14,149
I'll call you when he's ready.

705
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,109
Thank you.

706
00:37:16,152 --> 00:37:17,986
How about roasted eggplant?

707
00:37:17,987 --> 00:37:18,862
I don't know about--

708
00:37:18,863 --> 00:37:20,822
Well, does your wife like seafood?

709
00:37:20,823 --> 00:37:22,490
Seafood smells up the kitchen,

710
00:37:22,491 --> 00:37:24,284
and it can take hours
to get rid of the odor.

711
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:26,119
No, how about something simple?

712
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,454
I got a Hamburger Wellington

713
00:37:27,455 --> 00:37:28,788
that's out of this world.

714
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:29,915
Great, let me have it.

715
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:31,791
Okay, start with two
pounds of ground round,

716
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:33,460
lean and mean.

717
00:37:33,461 --> 00:37:34,794
Brown it in some butter.

718
00:37:34,795 --> 00:37:36,254
- Yeah.
- Pardon me.

719
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:37,714
Could you use margarine in that or butter?

720
00:37:37,715 --> 00:37:40,467
Oh, no, well, butter's
my personal choice.

721
00:37:40,468 --> 00:37:42,010
But butter can scorch.

722
00:37:42,011 --> 00:37:44,137
Higgins, you're next.

723
00:37:44,138 --> 00:37:45,305
Why don't you go ahead?

724
00:37:45,306 --> 00:37:47,307
And I'll go after you.

725
00:37:47,308 --> 00:37:48,934
You were here first.

726
00:37:48,935 --> 00:37:49,768
That's okay.

727
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:52,103
I have no place to go, and besides that,

728
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:54,481
there's not a job available
anywhere in this city.

729
00:37:57,443 --> 00:37:58,318
Okay, Butler.

730
00:37:58,319 --> 00:37:59,904
I guess you're next.

731
00:38:01,572 --> 00:38:03,990
I'd sure like to have a
copy of that when I come back.

732
00:38:03,991 --> 00:38:05,158
Sure.

733
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:05,992
Yeah?

734
00:38:05,993 --> 00:38:07,744
Drain all the excess fat.

735
00:38:15,086 --> 00:38:16,586
Well, you're mad, aren't you?

736
00:38:16,587 --> 00:38:17,671
I'm not mad.

737
00:38:17,672 --> 00:38:18,505
I'm not mad.

738
00:38:18,506 --> 00:38:21,091
It's just not where I
want to be right now.

739
00:38:21,092 --> 00:38:23,176
Well, Jack, I can't not go.

740
00:38:23,177 --> 00:38:25,720
I mean, please do it for me, would you?

741
00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:28,056
You know how many of these
things I went to for you?

742
00:38:28,057 --> 00:38:28,849
A lot.

743
00:38:30,184 --> 00:38:31,434
We'll stay ten minutes.

744
00:38:31,435 --> 00:38:32,686
Ten minutes.

745
00:38:32,687 --> 00:38:33,770
Ten minutes?

746
00:38:33,771 --> 00:38:36,856
15, tops.

747
00:38:36,857 --> 00:38:38,358
All right, okay.

748
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:39,192
Fair enough.

749
00:38:39,193 --> 00:38:41,444
But if we stay longer than that,
we pull the old Aunt Emily.

750
00:38:41,445 --> 00:38:43,906
Okay, the Aunt Emily, right.

751
00:38:48,327 --> 00:38:49,202
Wow.

752
00:38:49,203 --> 00:38:50,288
What a house.

753
00:38:51,747 --> 00:38:52,580
Yeah.

754
00:38:52,581 --> 00:38:54,416
Probably mortgaged to the eyeballs.

755
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:55,250
Not this one.

756
00:38:55,251 --> 00:38:58,753
His great-grandfather,
Commander Richardson, built it.

757
00:38:58,754 --> 00:39:01,048
Yeah, hand-me-down.

758
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:06,386
Oh, thank you.

759
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:09,556
You must be pretty darn proud
of our little Caroline, huh?

760
00:39:09,557 --> 00:39:10,557
Oh, yeah.

761
00:39:10,558 --> 00:39:11,808
We're very proud of her.

762
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:14,978
The children are, and we're
all real proud of her at home.

763
00:39:14,979 --> 00:39:18,148
She earned that promotion,
I can assure you, Jack.

764
00:39:18,149 --> 00:39:18,982
It was a little promotion.

765
00:39:18,983 --> 00:39:21,443
I forgot to tell you about
it, it was no big deal.

766
00:39:21,444 --> 00:39:23,236
Ladies and gentlemen.

767
00:39:23,237 --> 00:39:27,699
Welcome to the Richardson-Frankel
annual corporate olympics!

768
00:39:31,996 --> 00:39:33,413
Butler, you're a sportsman.

769
00:39:33,414 --> 00:39:35,498
I was kind of counting on
you to take part in this.

770
00:39:35,499 --> 00:39:36,958
Spouses are eligible.

771
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:38,752
Yeah. I don't know.

772
00:39:38,753 --> 00:39:39,711
Aw, come on.

773
00:39:39,712 --> 00:39:41,004
Nobody takes it seriously.

774
00:39:41,005 --> 00:39:43,173
It's just good clean fun.

775
00:39:43,174 --> 00:39:44,007
I know, Ron.

776
00:39:44,008 --> 00:39:45,383
Normally, I'd say yeah, but I'll tell you,

777
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:48,386
we've got to get over to
see, Caroline's Aunt Emily.

778
00:39:48,387 --> 00:39:49,429
She's--
- Sick.

779
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,681
- Dying.
- Dead.

780
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:53,433
Well, why don't you stick around

781
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:55,060
for a few minutes
anyway, and you can watch

782
00:39:55,061 --> 00:39:56,811
with the rest of the wives.

783
00:39:56,812 --> 00:39:57,645
Oh, I'm sorry.

784
00:39:57,646 --> 00:39:58,939
I mean families.

785
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:04,527
Boys, run down to the car and get dad's

786
00:40:04,528 --> 00:40:07,280
sweatpants and shoes and stuff out.

787
00:40:07,281 --> 00:40:09,324
Hey, all right.

788
00:40:09,325 --> 00:40:11,952
I'll stick around for a while.

789
00:40:15,581 --> 00:40:16,581
Looks like we got ourselves

790
00:40:16,582 --> 00:40:18,458
a little competition this year.

791
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:19,793
Butler over there is a real jock.

792
00:40:19,794 --> 00:40:22,003
Oh, boy, that's all we need.

793
00:40:22,004 --> 00:40:22,797
Yeah.

794
00:40:28,761 --> 00:40:29,969
Relax, Butler.

795
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,971
You're not gonna win anyway.

796
00:40:31,972 --> 00:40:33,014
Why not?

797
00:40:33,015 --> 00:40:34,057
He that good?

798
00:40:34,058 --> 00:40:34,891
He's the boss.

799
00:40:34,892 --> 00:40:38,186
It's his tournament, you get it?

800
00:40:38,187 --> 00:40:40,438
Yeah, but I don't work for him.

801
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:42,441
No, but your wife does.

802
00:42:55,032 --> 00:42:56,824
What's he doing?

803
00:42:56,825 --> 00:42:57,618
Winning.

804
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,351
You threw it, didn't you?

805
00:43:23,352 --> 00:43:25,270
You did good, dad.

806
00:43:25,271 --> 00:43:26,063
Thanks.

807
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:29,483
I owe you one, Jack.

808
00:43:31,151 --> 00:43:32,151
Come on, let's go.

809
00:43:32,152 --> 00:43:34,028
- Sure you're okay?
- Yeah.

810
00:43:42,162 --> 00:43:43,413
I did it!

811
00:43:43,414 --> 00:43:44,707
I really did it!

812
00:44:17,197 --> 00:44:19,658
Kevin, please.

813
00:44:20,951 --> 00:44:22,828
Just kiss me once more.

814
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:27,206
You know what that's
going to lead to, don't you?

815
00:44:27,207 --> 00:44:30,877
I want it to lead there.

816
00:44:30,878 --> 00:44:33,088
I want to feel alive again.

817
00:44:37,092 --> 00:44:41,221
I can't believe people
actually watch this stuff.

818
00:44:45,893 --> 00:44:48,896
So I'm not the father of the child.

819
00:44:50,606 --> 00:44:53,067
Well, that's some consolation.

820
00:44:54,068 --> 00:44:56,028
Just who is the culprit?

821
00:44:57,029 --> 00:44:58,071
You don't wanna know.

822
00:44:58,072 --> 00:44:59,739
Let me guess.

823
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,324
Probably the deceased Mr. Cashman.

824
00:45:01,325 --> 00:45:02,158
Ha!

825
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:02,992
Wrong, Vic.

826
00:45:02,993 --> 00:45:03,993
Wrong.

827
00:45:03,994 --> 00:45:04,911
Nikki doesn't even love you.

828
00:45:04,912 --> 00:45:08,081
Come on, Vic, open your eyes, buddy.

829
00:45:08,082 --> 00:45:09,791
She's been makin' it
with your friend Kevin.

830
00:45:09,792 --> 00:45:10,917
You mean Kevin Bancroft?

831
00:45:10,918 --> 00:45:12,460
That's exactly who I mean.

832
00:45:12,461 --> 00:45:14,295
Watch, she's gonna blame it on you now.

833
00:45:14,296 --> 00:45:15,880
You threw me at him.

834
00:45:15,881 --> 00:45:17,632
You let him know it was perfectly fine

835
00:45:17,633 --> 00:45:19,050
to take me to San Francisco.

836
00:45:19,051 --> 00:45:21,803
Only he took me to bed
first, and it's your fault.

837
00:45:22,971 --> 00:45:24,055
Did I tell ya?

838
00:45:24,056 --> 00:45:25,264
I knew it.

839
00:45:25,265 --> 00:45:26,099
Wake up, Vic!

840
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:28,601
She already buried one husband.

841
00:45:28,602 --> 00:45:29,811
Do you think I'm gonna let that

842
00:45:29,812 --> 00:45:32,188
get in the record for everybody to see?

843
00:45:32,189 --> 00:45:35,566
Or for the child to find out later on?

844
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:38,778
Then we'll just
have a no-fault divorce.

845
00:45:38,779 --> 00:45:39,570
We don't get along.

846
00:45:39,571 --> 00:45:41,239
It's certainly true enough.

847
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,282
No, Nikki, I won't do it.

848
00:45:43,283 --> 00:45:44,784
Listen, I've been thinking about this.

849
00:45:44,785 --> 00:45:46,411
- Dad?
- Yeah?

850
00:45:46,412 --> 00:45:49,956
This is cold, and the cheese
isn't hardly melted down.

851
00:45:49,957 --> 00:45:51,874
Okay, give it.

852
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:54,293
I've got a stake in this kid.

853
00:45:56,213 --> 00:45:58,589
And I'm gonna stick around
to make sure that he's okay.

854
00:45:58,590 --> 00:45:59,424
There you go.

855
00:45:59,425 --> 00:46:01,050
All you're
interested in is the baby.

856
00:46:01,051 --> 00:46:03,803
The baby's more important
to you than Caroline?

857
00:46:03,804 --> 00:46:04,595
That's right.

858
00:46:04,596 --> 00:46:06,347
My own flesh and blood.

859
00:46:06,348 --> 00:46:07,849
Kevin, you're such a fool.

860
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:09,684
That's right Nikki, I'm a fool.

861
00:46:09,685 --> 00:46:11,894
Daddy, daddy, my Woobie's ripped.

862
00:46:11,895 --> 00:46:12,812
Ken, you know what?

863
00:46:12,813 --> 00:46:14,480
Maybe it's time to get rid
of the Woobie, all right?

864
00:46:14,481 --> 00:46:15,524
No, no, no!

865
00:46:16,942 --> 00:46:18,234
Okay, all right, all right!

866
00:46:18,235 --> 00:46:19,777
Gimme it, gimme it.

867
00:46:19,778 --> 00:46:23,657
The dad'll help
if he wants that baby.

868
00:46:26,869 --> 00:46:30,371
It's more than just pride, Nikki.

869
00:46:30,372 --> 00:46:32,583
Here you go, good as new.

870
00:46:33,625 --> 00:46:35,209
Okay, listen, I'd
appreciate it if you guys

871
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:36,461
kept it down, okay?

872
00:46:36,462 --> 00:46:38,838
Because Nikki's gonna get
the results of her blood test

873
00:46:38,839 --> 00:46:39,714
back today.

874
00:46:39,715 --> 00:46:41,883
You have other
children with Caroline!

875
00:46:41,884 --> 00:46:42,842
That might happen--

876
00:46:42,843 --> 00:46:45,386
Is it Kevin's baby?

877
00:46:45,387 --> 00:46:46,220
Not sure.

878
00:46:46,221 --> 00:46:47,681
Kevin's a skunk.

879
00:46:48,932 --> 00:46:50,391
But Kevin gets all the girls.

880
00:46:50,392 --> 00:46:52,268
He sure got Nikki.

881
00:46:54,188 --> 00:46:55,271
My mother
doesn't love my father,

882
00:46:55,272 --> 00:46:58,900
but still we've managed
to make a life together.

883
00:46:58,901 --> 00:47:01,068
So you can just forget about
this annulment or divorce--

884
00:47:01,069 --> 00:47:02,361
Yeah?

885
00:47:02,362 --> 00:47:04,323
Hi, Joan, how you doin'?

886
00:47:05,991 --> 00:47:07,785
It's gotta be Kevin's.

887
00:47:08,911 --> 00:47:09,744
Victor?

888
00:47:09,745 --> 00:47:11,162
How can it be Victor?

889
00:47:11,163 --> 00:47:13,040
No, he had a vasectomy.

890
00:47:14,082 --> 00:47:15,292
It didn't take?

891
00:47:16,293 --> 00:47:17,627
Are you kidding me?

892
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,297
Hold on a minute!

893
00:47:21,298 --> 00:47:23,258
Ken, give me that sword!

894
00:47:30,724 --> 00:47:34,685
Okay, I've got 25-cent Wheaties rebate.

895
00:47:34,686 --> 00:47:38,315
I'm gonna raise you
Vancamp's pork and beans

896
00:47:39,942 --> 00:47:41,108
and Ovaltine.

897
00:47:42,027 --> 00:47:45,196
Well, I'm gonna see your
25-cent Wheaties rebate

898
00:47:45,197 --> 00:47:49,158
and raise you two Tender
Vittles dollar offs, okay?

899
00:47:49,159 --> 00:47:50,243
That's it for me.

900
00:47:50,244 --> 00:47:51,077
I'll fold.

901
00:47:51,078 --> 00:47:53,079
Jack, why are you
dealing me this garbage?

902
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,163
I'm out.

903
00:47:54,164 --> 00:47:56,249
This is so much more
fun than bridge, Jack.

904
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:58,292
Thanks so much for thinking of it.

905
00:47:58,293 --> 00:47:59,585
Girls, girls.

906
00:47:59,586 --> 00:48:00,419
Come on.

907
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,421
Are you gonna play
cards or flap your gums?

908
00:48:02,422 --> 00:48:03,297
Flap my gums!

909
00:48:03,298 --> 00:48:04,632
It's gettin' ugly in here.

910
00:48:04,633 --> 00:48:05,550
Hey, come on.

911
00:48:05,551 --> 00:48:06,634
All right, all right.

912
00:48:06,635 --> 00:48:08,302
I will see you your Tender Vittles,

913
00:48:08,303 --> 00:48:11,722
and I'll raise you a 50-cent Yoplait

914
00:48:11,723 --> 00:48:15,768
and a two-dollar rebate
on a Domino's pizza

915
00:48:15,769 --> 00:48:19,605
and a two-for-one Sun Pure frozen entree.

916
00:48:19,606 --> 00:48:20,940
How about that?

917
00:48:20,941 --> 00:48:22,316
- Ooh.
- Uh-oh.

918
00:48:22,317 --> 00:48:24,278
This is serious poker.

919
00:48:25,362 --> 00:48:28,531
Any of you ever tried those
Sun Pure frozen entrees?

920
00:48:28,532 --> 00:48:30,074
My dog wouldn't eat 'em.

921
00:48:30,075 --> 00:48:31,702
I love them, I do.

922
00:48:37,124 --> 00:48:39,667
I'm calling you with a 25-cent

923
00:48:39,668 --> 00:48:41,794
new and improved Ban roll-on

924
00:48:41,795 --> 00:48:45,424
and two 50-cent triple-ply
Hefty bag offers.

925
00:48:46,383 --> 00:48:47,758
What d'you got?

926
00:48:47,759 --> 00:48:49,136
She's bluffing.

927
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:53,599
Are these any good?

928
00:48:59,021 --> 00:49:00,564
You got two pair.

929
00:49:01,648 --> 00:49:02,816
You got plenty.

930
00:49:04,192 --> 00:49:05,068
Hi, kids.

931
00:49:05,944 --> 00:49:06,737
Hi, mom!

932
00:49:08,113 --> 00:49:09,781
- Caroline.
- Oh, hi.

933
00:49:11,158 --> 00:49:12,325
Pizza, huh?

934
00:49:12,326 --> 00:49:13,618
Oh, don't get up, don't get up.

935
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:15,828
Geez, that late already?

936
00:49:15,829 --> 00:49:17,455
We're just finishing.

937
00:49:17,456 --> 00:49:18,289
Don't be silly.

938
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:19,707
Don't get up, well, pizza.

939
00:49:19,708 --> 00:49:21,083
I got a ton of work to do.

940
00:49:21,084 --> 00:49:22,461
I'll go upstairs.

941
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,839
Listen, we better go here, come on.

942
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,591
- 7:30?
- 7:30!

943
00:49:28,592 --> 00:49:30,468
We'll play tomorrow, am I right?

944
00:49:32,346 --> 00:49:34,347
Family starving?

945
00:49:34,348 --> 00:49:35,973
Take some pizza home with you.

946
00:49:35,974 --> 00:49:37,433
No, no, I don't need it.

947
00:49:37,434 --> 00:49:40,227
Joan, don't forget your coupons.

948
00:49:40,228 --> 00:49:41,520
Excuse me.

949
00:49:41,521 --> 00:49:42,814
Joan, come on.

950
00:49:50,864 --> 00:49:52,950
I think I'm in trouble.

951
00:49:55,327 --> 00:49:56,954
Room service, madam.

952
00:49:58,038 --> 00:49:59,872
Oh, thanks, but Ron

953
00:49:59,873 --> 00:50:01,332
gave me this tuna presentation to do,

954
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:03,542
and I'm really way behind.

955
00:50:03,543 --> 00:50:05,544
Well, you gotta eat something, honey.

956
00:50:05,545 --> 00:50:07,463
Well, if I wanted
something to eat, Jack,

957
00:50:07,464 --> 00:50:08,923
I would have come down and
had something to eat with you

958
00:50:08,924 --> 00:50:10,634
and your girlfriends.

959
00:50:12,344 --> 00:50:13,303
All right.

960
00:50:14,388 --> 00:50:15,930
Let's get into it.

961
00:50:15,931 --> 00:50:17,056
Get into what, Jack?

962
00:50:17,057 --> 00:50:18,182
Get into this.

963
00:50:18,183 --> 00:50:19,433
The house is a mess, Jack.

964
00:50:19,434 --> 00:50:20,434
The kids are a mess, Jack.

965
00:50:20,435 --> 00:50:21,894
You're a mess, Jack.

966
00:50:21,895 --> 00:50:23,562
Did I leave anything else out?

967
00:50:23,563 --> 00:50:24,772
Wanna talk about the beard?

968
00:50:24,773 --> 00:50:25,606
All right.

969
00:50:25,607 --> 00:50:28,693
The beard's in its transitional
stage right now, that's all.

970
00:50:28,694 --> 00:50:31,779
When it comes in, it's gonna look great.

971
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:35,241
It's gonna look like that
movie star, what's his name?

972
00:50:35,242 --> 00:50:36,826
Orson Welles?

973
00:50:36,827 --> 00:50:37,619
No.

974
00:50:39,371 --> 00:50:40,663
Oh!

975
00:50:40,664 --> 00:50:41,706
Orson Welles.

976
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:44,333
Oh, I get it.

977
00:50:44,334 --> 00:50:45,543
Fat jokes, right?

978
00:50:45,544 --> 00:50:46,377
That's real funny.

979
00:50:46,378 --> 00:50:47,628
Yeah, I've put on a couple of pounds.

980
00:50:47,629 --> 00:50:48,462
So what, come on.

981
00:50:48,463 --> 00:50:49,797
What else do you have?

982
00:50:49,798 --> 00:50:51,966
You wanna talk about this
shirt for a second, Jack?

983
00:50:51,967 --> 00:50:52,800
All right.

984
00:50:52,801 --> 00:50:53,801
You've been wearing this
shirt around the house

985
00:50:53,802 --> 00:50:54,719
for about two weeks now.

986
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,137
It could walk around by itself.

987
00:50:56,138 --> 00:50:57,138
Why don't you retire that thing

988
00:50:57,139 --> 00:50:59,098
to the dry cleaning hall of fame, huh?

989
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:00,558
Because it's a comfortable shirt!

990
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:01,851
Jack, take a look at yourself.

991
00:51:01,852 --> 00:51:04,103
You've really thrown in the towel, honey.

992
00:51:04,104 --> 00:51:06,731
My brain is like oatmeal.

993
00:51:06,732 --> 00:51:09,942
I yelled at Kenny today for
coloring outside the lines!

994
00:51:09,943 --> 00:51:13,237
Megan and I are starting
to watch the same TV shows,

995
00:51:13,238 --> 00:51:15,364
and I'm liking them.

996
00:51:15,365 --> 00:51:17,324
I'm losin' it.

997
00:51:17,325 --> 00:51:18,868
Honey, I know what you're talking about.

998
00:51:18,869 --> 00:51:20,119
I've been there myself, all right?

999
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:20,953
If you were so unhappy

1000
00:51:20,954 --> 00:51:22,371
why didn't you say something about it?

1001
00:51:22,372 --> 00:51:23,873
Because I wasn't unhappy!

1002
00:51:23,874 --> 00:51:25,666
Look, maybe I was a little confused.

1003
00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:26,792
Maybe I was a little frustrated.

1004
00:51:26,793 --> 00:51:28,544
But I knew what I was doing was important,

1005
00:51:28,545 --> 00:51:30,379
because it means something
to raise decent human beings.

1006
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:32,006
What saw me through was pride.

1007
00:51:32,007 --> 00:51:34,425
I had pride in this
house, I had in my kids,

1008
00:51:34,426 --> 00:51:36,761
and I had pride in being Mrs. Jack Butler!

1009
00:51:36,762 --> 00:51:38,388
Where are you going?

1010
00:51:39,389 --> 00:51:41,640
I'm going downstairs and
sleep on the fat couch,

1011
00:51:41,641 --> 00:51:44,977
if I can get through the door.

1012
00:51:44,978 --> 00:51:49,023
Well, be sure and take pride
in some of that fat, Porky!

1013
00:51:52,611 --> 00:51:54,236
Yes, hello?

1014
00:51:54,237 --> 00:51:57,364
Victor, it's Nikki.

1015
00:51:58,992 --> 00:52:00,619
Yes, hello, Nikki.

1016
00:52:01,953 --> 00:52:03,037
Honey, are you okay?

1017
00:52:04,456 --> 00:52:06,916
Yeah, I'm fine.

1018
00:52:06,917 --> 00:52:07,709
Hello.

1019
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:14,174
Joan, hi, how are you?

1020
00:52:17,886 --> 00:52:19,011
No, forget it, come on.

1021
00:52:19,012 --> 00:52:19,970
That was days ago.

1022
00:52:19,971 --> 00:52:20,888
No.

1023
00:52:20,889 --> 00:52:24,141
No, it was very insensitive of us.

1024
00:52:24,142 --> 00:52:27,145
Caroline had every right to be angry.

1025
00:52:28,146 --> 00:52:31,857
We're not talking or
doin' anything else.

1026
00:52:31,858 --> 00:52:33,610
I'll be right there.

1027
00:52:49,626 --> 00:52:52,419
I came as fast as I could.

1028
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:53,630
You sure did.

1029
00:52:55,966 --> 00:52:57,843
You look great, Jack.

1030
00:53:02,973 --> 00:53:04,098
I do?

1031
00:53:04,099 --> 00:53:04,891
Mm-hmm.

1032
00:53:13,817 --> 00:53:16,735
What do you think of this shirt?

1033
00:53:16,736 --> 00:53:19,364
Let me tell you about flannel.

1034
00:53:20,949 --> 00:53:22,159
It gets me hot.

1035
00:53:27,873 --> 00:53:29,833
Joan, do I look fat or

1036
00:53:33,253 --> 00:53:36,046
overweight at all to you?

1037
00:53:36,047 --> 00:53:39,926
I like a man with a
little meat on his bones.

1038
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:43,513
That's two.

1039
00:53:45,974 --> 00:53:46,974
Okay, how about the beard?

1040
00:53:46,975 --> 00:53:49,686
I mean, Caroline hates the beard.

1041
00:53:51,438 --> 00:53:52,646
I know.

1042
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,403
Oh, my god.

1043
00:54:04,451 --> 00:54:07,078
Jack!

1044
00:54:08,622 --> 00:54:09,414
Jack?

1045
00:54:14,044 --> 00:54:15,212
How could you?

1046
00:54:16,504 --> 00:54:17,297
And Joan?

1047
00:54:18,298 --> 00:54:20,591
Why, Joan, you're
supposed to be my friend.

1048
00:54:20,592 --> 00:54:24,970
He's too much man to
be left alone, Caroline.

1049
00:54:24,971 --> 00:54:25,764
Really?

1050
00:54:27,682 --> 00:54:28,933
Honey!

1051
00:54:28,934 --> 00:54:29,725
Please!

1052
00:54:29,726 --> 00:54:30,768
Caroline, come on.

1053
00:54:30,769 --> 00:54:33,145
It's just one kiss!

1054
00:54:33,146 --> 00:54:34,730
I'll bet.

1055
00:54:34,731 --> 00:54:36,065
Honey, what about the kids?

1056
00:54:36,066 --> 00:54:37,733
The kids are just outside.

1057
00:54:37,734 --> 00:54:39,401
I've thought of the kids.

1058
00:54:39,402 --> 00:54:41,696
The kids won't hear a thing.

1059
00:54:42,864 --> 00:54:44,198
Shoot me!

1060
00:54:44,199 --> 00:54:45,407
Shoot me!

1061
00:54:45,408 --> 00:54:46,325
You're right.

1062
00:54:46,326 --> 00:54:47,910
God knows I'm guilty.

1063
00:54:47,911 --> 00:54:49,161
I deserve it.

1064
00:54:49,162 --> 00:54:50,162
Tell me something, Jack.

1065
00:54:50,163 --> 00:54:51,830
What did it, huh?

1066
00:54:51,831 --> 00:54:53,624
The boredom?

1067
00:54:53,625 --> 00:54:55,417
The repetition?

1068
00:54:55,418 --> 00:54:58,045
The days, one flowing into the next?

1069
00:54:58,046 --> 00:55:00,005
The loneliness?

1070
00:55:00,006 --> 00:55:01,340
Well, I did it, Jack.

1071
00:55:01,341 --> 00:55:03,008
I did it for eight years.

1072
00:55:03,009 --> 00:55:05,094
Don't you think I know?

1073
00:55:05,095 --> 00:55:06,804
Say good-bye, darling.

1074
00:55:15,897 --> 00:55:16,690
What?

1075
00:55:18,525 --> 00:55:19,317
Aw, shit!

1076
00:55:25,824 --> 00:55:27,700
I loved this shirt!

1077
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:37,711
God.

1078
00:55:54,894 --> 00:55:57,772
Couldn't hold on, could ya, Jack?

1079
00:56:01,526 --> 00:56:04,237
I was comin' by to call you back.

1080
00:56:10,493 --> 00:56:11,328
Holy cow.

1081
00:56:14,622 --> 00:56:16,416
What'd you use, a.38?

1082
00:56:17,876 --> 00:56:20,253
.38,.39, whatever it took.

1083
00:56:23,131 --> 00:56:24,174
Bye, darling.

1084
00:56:25,675 --> 00:56:27,259
Tough luck, Jeff.

1085
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:28,677
Jack!

1086
00:56:28,678 --> 00:56:29,471
You bet.

1087
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:31,473
Jack, Jack.

1088
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:34,058
My name's Jack.

1089
00:56:34,059 --> 00:56:34,851
Jack.

1090
00:56:35,935 --> 00:56:36,728
Jack.

1091
00:57:09,427 --> 00:57:11,178
I can't, Joan, I can't.

1092
00:57:11,179 --> 00:57:13,055
You can't do this to me.

1093
00:57:13,056 --> 00:57:14,181
Do what?

1094
00:57:14,182 --> 00:57:15,474
It's time for our poker game.

1095
00:57:15,475 --> 00:57:17,976
The girls will be a little late.

1096
00:57:17,977 --> 00:57:19,520
There's no game today.

1097
00:57:19,521 --> 00:57:20,479
The game's called off.

1098
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,271
Why?

1099
00:57:21,272 --> 00:57:22,856
'Cause there's a death in the family.

1100
00:57:22,857 --> 00:57:25,235
I'll explain it to you later.

1101
00:58:00,019 --> 00:58:00,770
Stay!

1102
00:58:04,274 --> 00:58:07,444
Get in there and clean the kids' room.

1103
00:58:09,779 --> 00:58:11,530
Three, four.

1104
00:58:11,531 --> 00:58:12,364
Yeah!

1105
00:58:21,583 --> 00:58:23,625
Let me take a break!

1106
00:58:23,626 --> 00:58:24,501
Two!

1107
00:58:24,502 --> 00:58:25,335
Three!

1108
00:58:25,336 --> 00:58:26,170
Four!

1109
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:27,922
Hey!

1110
00:58:29,549 --> 00:58:30,632
Come on, pal.

1111
00:58:30,633 --> 00:58:32,926
Hey, south is drop off, north is pick up.

1112
00:58:32,927 --> 00:58:34,511
Let's get it straight
next time, all right?

1113
00:58:34,512 --> 00:58:37,347
Come on, move it, move it.

1114
00:58:37,348 --> 00:58:38,849
Let's go!

1115
00:58:40,768 --> 00:58:41,602
Let's go, monkeys!

1116
00:58:41,603 --> 00:58:42,728
I want all of you up, let's go!

1117
00:58:42,729 --> 00:58:43,687
I want this area policed.

1118
00:58:43,688 --> 00:58:44,605
I want the animals fed.

1119
00:58:44,606 --> 00:58:46,940
I want you to report for chow, 0700.

1120
00:58:46,941 --> 00:58:47,774
Move it, monkeys!

1121
00:58:47,775 --> 00:58:49,359
Move it, let's go!

1122
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,153
Dad?

1123
00:58:52,822 --> 00:58:55,657
♫ Gonna fly now

1124
00:58:55,658 --> 00:58:56,867
Where's my baby

1125
00:58:56,868 --> 00:58:57,660
Come on.

1126
00:58:58,870 --> 00:58:59,703
Today show.

1127
00:58:59,704 --> 00:59:00,663
Gene Shalit.

1128
00:59:02,707 --> 00:59:04,166
♫ Gonna fly now

1129
00:59:04,167 --> 00:59:05,000
Let's go, we're running late.

1130
00:59:05,001 --> 00:59:06,335
Yeah, okay.

1131
00:59:06,336 --> 00:59:08,670
Thanks, honey, I'm moving now.

1132
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:10,757
I'll be there in a minute.

1133
00:59:19,849 --> 00:59:20,642
Good luck.

1134
00:59:26,773 --> 00:59:29,442
♫ Gonna fly now

1135
00:59:31,486 --> 00:59:34,364
♫ Flying high now

1136
00:59:36,324 --> 00:59:38,701
♫ Gonna fly

1137
00:59:41,996 --> 00:59:44,541
♫ Fly so high

1138
00:59:57,387 --> 00:59:58,346
Listen, Ace.

1139
01:00:00,265 --> 01:00:03,934
You and I have to have
a man-to-man talk here

1140
01:00:03,935 --> 01:00:05,395
about your Woobie.

1141
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:09,940
Your Woobie's looking bad, bud.

1142
01:00:09,941 --> 01:00:11,942
Now, wait a minute.

1143
01:00:11,943 --> 01:00:13,277
Now, listen to me.

1144
01:00:13,278 --> 01:00:15,779
I understand that you little guys

1145
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:17,614
start out with your woobies

1146
01:00:17,615 --> 01:00:18,699
and you think they're great,

1147
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:21,201
and they are, they are terrific.

1148
01:00:21,202 --> 01:00:25,038
But pretty soon, a Woobie isn't enough.

1149
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:26,123
You're out on the street

1150
01:00:26,124 --> 01:00:27,958
trying to score an electric blanket

1151
01:00:27,959 --> 01:00:32,462
or maybe a quilt, and
the next thing you know,

1152
01:00:32,463 --> 01:00:35,508
you're strung out on bedspreads, Ken.

1153
01:00:37,385 --> 01:00:38,595
That's serious.

1154
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,640
Now, give me the Woobie.

1155
01:00:44,142 --> 01:00:44,934
No.

1156
01:00:48,521 --> 01:00:50,315
Kenny, come on, man.

1157
01:00:52,108 --> 01:00:52,900
No.

1158
01:00:54,068 --> 01:00:54,861
Okay.

1159
01:00:56,154 --> 01:00:58,530
Give it to me for a couple of days.

1160
01:00:58,531 --> 01:01:02,160
If it doesn't work, you
got the Woobie back.

1161
01:01:04,662 --> 01:01:05,413
Please?

1162
01:01:19,886 --> 01:01:21,679
You got a lot of guts.

1163
01:01:24,474 --> 01:01:27,769
Can I have a moment to myself, please?

1164
01:01:31,689 --> 01:01:32,690
Absolutely.

1165
01:01:33,608 --> 01:01:34,484
You got it.

1166
01:01:57,590 --> 01:01:59,133
You had to do it.

1167
01:02:07,767 --> 01:02:08,559
Okay.

1168
01:04:18,898 --> 01:04:19,690
Ohh.

1169
01:04:21,067 --> 01:04:22,109
Tired, huh?

1170
01:04:22,985 --> 01:04:23,861
Oh, yeah.

1171
01:04:26,155 --> 01:04:27,781
A little.

1172
01:04:27,782 --> 01:04:28,782
Excuse me.

1173
01:04:28,783 --> 01:04:29,616
Hmm?

1174
01:04:29,617 --> 01:04:31,034
How about this food?

1175
01:04:31,035 --> 01:04:31,828
Mmm.

1176
01:04:34,038 --> 01:04:34,913
Very good.

1177
01:04:34,914 --> 01:04:35,747
Mm-hmm.

1178
01:04:35,748 --> 01:04:38,208
You sent out for Chinese food, huh?

1179
01:04:38,209 --> 01:04:39,543
No!

1180
01:04:39,544 --> 01:04:40,837
Kenny made this.

1181
01:04:43,881 --> 01:04:44,632
Nuh-uh.

1182
01:04:45,591 --> 01:04:46,508
Listen, you're doing a really

1183
01:04:46,509 --> 01:04:48,426
great job with the kids, honey.

1184
01:04:48,427 --> 01:04:49,386
I appreciate it.

1185
01:04:49,387 --> 01:04:50,220
And with everything.

1186
01:04:50,221 --> 01:04:51,054
You really are.

1187
01:04:51,055 --> 01:04:51,848
Thanks.

1188
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:55,684
I'd love to take this time
to carry you upstairs,

1189
01:04:55,685 --> 01:04:58,687
and let you tell me all about
it, but I think that might

1190
01:04:58,688 --> 01:04:59,938
take too long.

1191
01:04:59,939 --> 01:05:00,731
Mmm.

1192
01:05:04,277 --> 01:05:05,069
Mmm.

1193
01:05:32,138 --> 01:05:33,513
How's it going in there, huh?

1194
01:05:33,514 --> 01:05:36,142
Like having your gums scraped.

1195
01:05:37,852 --> 01:05:39,144
You're on.

1196
01:05:39,145 --> 01:05:39,937
So soon?

1197
01:05:41,063 --> 01:05:42,355
It didn't take Humphries very long

1198
01:05:42,356 --> 01:05:44,274
to shoot down every idea we had.

1199
01:05:45,526 --> 01:05:48,028
Looks like you're the
ace in the hole, kid.

1200
01:05:48,029 --> 01:05:49,488
Well, I'm ready.

1201
01:05:52,033 --> 01:05:54,618
Okay, you've got my attention.

1202
01:05:54,619 --> 01:05:55,577
Shoot.

1203
01:05:56,704 --> 01:05:59,372
Well, these are the last two
campaigns for Schooner Tuna.

1204
01:05:59,373 --> 01:06:02,250
First you gave away four
glasses with every can of tuna.

1205
01:06:02,251 --> 01:06:04,586
Now, as I recall, you were
stuck with 60,000 of these,

1206
01:06:04,587 --> 01:06:05,379
right?

1207
01:06:06,505 --> 01:06:09,591
What is this, "This is your life"?

1208
01:06:09,592 --> 01:06:11,051
Now, bear with me.

1209
01:06:11,052 --> 01:06:14,012
Next came 100 free trips to Hawaii.

1210
01:06:14,013 --> 01:06:16,222
Now, who knew there was gonna
be a hurricane that month?

1211
01:06:16,223 --> 01:06:20,602
You're stuck with 100,000
of these flower lace.

1212
01:06:20,603 --> 01:06:23,355
I hope to hell you're making a point.

1213
01:06:23,356 --> 01:06:24,981
Well, I am making a
point, Mr. Humphries.

1214
01:06:24,982 --> 01:06:27,067
The point is, Schooner
Tuna is one of the three

1215
01:06:27,068 --> 01:06:28,860
most expensive tunas on the market.

1216
01:06:28,861 --> 01:06:30,403
Now, if we want to beat our competitors,

1217
01:06:30,404 --> 01:06:33,031
the time for these gimmicks
and giveaways is over with.

1218
01:06:33,032 --> 01:06:35,116
Now, I don't mean to be
disrespectful, Mr. Humphries,

1219
01:06:35,117 --> 01:06:38,578
but housewives need your
help, not your gimmicks.

1220
01:06:38,579 --> 01:06:41,039
Show them that you really
care about their problems,

1221
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,707
and you'll win their loyalty.

1222
01:06:42,708 --> 01:06:45,251
Now, this is what I propose.

1223
01:06:45,252 --> 01:06:46,753
"Schooner Tuna sympathizes

1224
01:06:46,754 --> 01:06:49,255
"with those hit so hard
by this trying economy.

1225
01:06:49,256 --> 01:06:50,340
"To help you, we are reducing

1226
01:06:50,341 --> 01:06:52,717
"the price of our tuna by 50 cents a can.

1227
01:06:52,718 --> 01:06:53,927
"When this crisis is over,

1228
01:06:53,928 --> 01:06:56,179
"we'll go back to our regular prices.

1229
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:58,723
"Until then, remember,
we're all in this together.

1230
01:06:58,724 --> 01:07:00,141
Signed, Howard Humphries, President,

1231
01:07:00,142 --> 01:07:01,059
Schooner Tuna.

1232
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:03,020
"The tuna with a heart."

1233
01:07:11,278 --> 01:07:13,613
Well, you've got a
plane to catch.

1234
01:07:13,614 --> 01:07:14,906
I'm really sorry, Howard.

1235
01:07:14,907 --> 01:07:17,450
Damn well right, you're sorry.

1236
01:07:17,451 --> 01:07:18,411
Yes, I am.

1237
01:07:19,453 --> 01:07:20,870
Where in the hell have you

1238
01:07:20,871 --> 01:07:23,206
been hiding this little girl?

1239
01:07:23,207 --> 01:07:26,918
She's not just selling tuna,
son, she's selling America!

1240
01:07:26,919 --> 01:07:27,752
Right!

1241
01:07:27,753 --> 01:07:28,586
The tuna with a heart!

1242
01:07:28,587 --> 01:07:29,462
I love this bleeding heart shit.

1243
01:07:29,463 --> 01:07:31,381
That's American, that's what that is.

1244
01:07:31,382 --> 01:07:33,425
That's what I think!

1245
01:07:33,426 --> 01:07:35,051
Well, there's more.

1246
01:07:35,052 --> 01:07:35,885
More?

1247
01:07:35,886 --> 01:07:36,928
There is?

1248
01:07:36,929 --> 01:07:37,722
Yes.

1249
01:07:48,065 --> 01:07:50,066
Caroline, congratulations!

1250
01:07:50,067 --> 01:07:50,942
Thanks.

1251
01:07:50,943 --> 01:07:52,902
I am so impressed with you.

1252
01:08:01,495 --> 01:08:03,663
Hi, I'm here for Mrs.
Butler, 8:00 flight.

1253
01:08:03,664 --> 01:08:05,415
Right, she'll be right out.

1254
01:08:05,416 --> 01:08:06,208
Okay.

1255
01:08:12,423 --> 01:08:14,466
Why do you have to go to California?

1256
01:08:14,467 --> 01:08:15,300
'Cause that's where we're gonna

1257
01:08:15,301 --> 01:08:17,427
make the tuna commercial, honey.

1258
01:08:17,428 --> 01:08:20,138
Can't you go tomorrow, mommy?

1259
01:08:20,139 --> 01:08:21,681
No, I can't, because everyone else

1260
01:08:21,682 --> 01:08:23,808
is going tonight, and I have to go.

1261
01:08:23,809 --> 01:08:24,809
But you know what?

1262
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:25,977
I'm gonna be back before you go

1263
01:08:25,978 --> 01:08:27,437
to your first meeting of the knights

1264
01:08:27,438 --> 01:08:29,899
of the round table, I promise.

1265
01:08:31,650 --> 01:08:32,526
Bye, honey.

1266
01:08:33,611 --> 01:08:34,611
Bye, sweetie.

1267
01:08:35,446 --> 01:08:36,238
Aww.

1268
01:08:39,867 --> 01:08:41,159
Wait, guys, stay right here.

1269
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:43,703
Alex, Kenny, watch her for a minute, okay?

1270
01:08:43,704 --> 01:08:45,206
Let me talk to you.

1271
01:08:47,208 --> 01:08:50,710
Two hours notice, and you're
off to Los Angeles like that.

1272
01:08:50,711 --> 01:08:52,962
Jack, there is nothing
I could do about it.

1273
01:08:52,963 --> 01:08:54,714
I convinced a man today to spend

1274
01:08:54,715 --> 01:08:57,008
$11 million on one of my ideas.

1275
01:08:57,009 --> 01:08:58,134
I gotta go!

1276
01:08:58,135 --> 01:09:00,595
Besides, honey, there's gonna
be other Halloweens, you know.

1277
01:09:00,596 --> 01:09:01,638
I know there'll be other Halloweens,

1278
01:09:01,639 --> 01:09:03,223
but I'm thinking about this Halloween.

1279
01:09:03,224 --> 01:09:05,558
I mean, Caroline, these
kids, in a couple of years,

1280
01:09:05,559 --> 01:09:07,143
they're gonna outgrow this thing.

1281
01:09:07,144 --> 01:09:07,936
Oh, really?

1282
01:09:07,937 --> 01:09:12,148
You don't seem to have outgrown it, Jack.

1283
01:09:12,149 --> 01:09:14,609
All right, I admit it, I like Halloween.

1284
01:09:14,610 --> 01:09:15,860
Yeah, well, so do I, honey.

1285
01:09:15,861 --> 01:09:20,740
Remember, I was gonna dress
up as a prison matron tonight?

1286
01:09:20,741 --> 01:09:24,327
The point is, Megan
just cut two new teeth.

1287
01:09:24,328 --> 01:09:25,453
I'll bet you didn't know that.

1288
01:09:25,454 --> 01:09:27,163
Alex is playing football.

1289
01:09:27,164 --> 01:09:28,998
Remember Kenny's security blanket?

1290
01:09:28,999 --> 01:09:29,916
He doesn't have it anymore.

1291
01:09:29,917 --> 01:09:31,209
He doesn't use it, it's gone.

1292
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:32,210
You know, if you were here,

1293
01:09:32,211 --> 01:09:33,795
I was gonna suggest you go as a ghost,

1294
01:09:33,796 --> 01:09:38,091
'cause even when you're
here, you're not here!

1295
01:09:38,092 --> 01:09:40,260
Caroline, we really have to get going.

1296
01:09:40,261 --> 01:09:43,096
Hey, Madison Avenue, lighten up.

1297
01:09:43,097 --> 01:09:43,930
All right, Jack.

1298
01:09:43,931 --> 01:09:44,764
What do you want me to do?

1299
01:09:44,765 --> 01:09:45,807
Not go?

1300
01:09:45,808 --> 01:09:46,641
Not try?

1301
01:09:46,642 --> 01:09:48,101
Not succeed?

1302
01:09:48,102 --> 01:09:48,935
Of course not!

1303
01:09:48,936 --> 01:09:50,395
I want you to succeed.

1304
01:09:50,396 --> 01:09:51,188
Hon.

1305
01:09:54,233 --> 01:09:57,527
You gave me some real good advice once.

1306
01:09:57,528 --> 01:09:59,988
So now let me give you some of mine.

1307
01:09:59,989 --> 01:10:03,032
It's real easy to forget what's important.

1308
01:10:03,033 --> 01:10:03,826
So don't.

1309
01:10:09,039 --> 01:10:10,999
Jack, I'm gonna be
back in less than a week.

1310
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,001
Can't we talk about this then?

1311
01:10:14,086 --> 01:10:16,963
Come on, everything's gonna be all right.

1312
01:10:43,365 --> 01:10:46,034
Little woman's off again, huh?

1313
01:10:46,035 --> 01:10:47,578
Shut up, Annette.

1314
01:10:51,665 --> 01:10:52,707
Please, Megan.

1315
01:10:52,708 --> 01:10:53,541
Please.

1316
01:10:53,542 --> 01:10:54,542
Daddy will buy you a T-Bird.

1317
01:10:54,543 --> 01:10:55,376
Okay?

1318
01:10:55,377 --> 01:10:56,252
You want a T-Bird?

1319
01:10:56,253 --> 01:10:57,045
Please.

1320
01:10:57,046 --> 01:10:58,171
Put your bum down there, honey, okay?

1321
01:10:58,172 --> 01:10:59,756
I know, but--

1322
01:10:59,757 --> 01:11:01,299
Ken, she here?

1323
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:03,885
I think she's here now, dad.

1324
01:11:03,886 --> 01:11:05,386
Okay, honey, please.

1325
01:11:05,387 --> 01:11:07,388
For daddy, Meg, please, okay?

1326
01:11:11,143 --> 01:11:11,936
Hi.

1327
01:11:14,730 --> 01:11:16,439
Who are you?

1328
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:17,233
What?

1329
01:11:18,192 --> 01:11:19,442
Who are you?

1330
01:11:19,443 --> 01:11:21,945
I'm your baby-sitter.

1331
01:11:21,946 --> 01:11:23,363
Excuse me.

1332
01:11:23,364 --> 01:11:24,156
Wait.

1333
01:11:37,544 --> 01:11:38,628
- Oh, Jack.
- Hi.

1334
01:11:38,629 --> 01:11:39,754
- How are you?
- Okay.

1335
01:11:39,755 --> 01:11:40,672
Hi, kids.

1336
01:11:40,673 --> 01:11:42,757
You remember Uncle Jinx?

1337
01:11:42,758 --> 01:11:44,342
They're big now, huh?

1338
01:11:44,343 --> 01:11:45,343
Yeah.

1339
01:11:45,344 --> 01:11:48,680
Listen, what this is
about, it's a review board.

1340
01:11:48,681 --> 01:11:50,598
Now, it's just a formality.

1341
01:11:50,599 --> 01:11:54,477
They're gonna ask you
a couple of questions--

1342
01:11:54,478 --> 01:11:56,354
Jack, if you could back me up,

1343
01:11:56,355 --> 01:11:59,524
I think I can get you
back on at half salary.

1344
01:11:59,525 --> 01:12:00,358
What are you talking about?

1345
01:12:00,359 --> 01:12:04,070
You didn't say anything about
half salary on the phone.

1346
01:12:04,071 --> 01:12:06,990
Mr. Latham, Mr. Butler,
you can go in now.

1347
01:12:06,991 --> 01:12:08,366
According to our records,

1348
01:12:08,367 --> 01:12:10,201
since you and your associates left,

1349
01:12:10,202 --> 01:12:13,830
production in your division is off by 23 %

1350
01:12:13,831 --> 01:12:16,416
and cost soared up 19 %.

1351
01:12:16,417 --> 01:12:19,711
Do you have any explanation for that?

1352
01:12:19,712 --> 01:12:20,586
I'm a little confused here.

1353
01:12:20,587 --> 01:12:23,756
I'm no longer with the company.

1354
01:12:23,757 --> 01:12:24,590
I don't know.

1355
01:12:24,591 --> 01:12:26,592
You might ask Mr. Latham.

1356
01:12:26,593 --> 01:12:27,386
We have.

1357
01:12:29,346 --> 01:12:30,847
And?

1358
01:12:30,848 --> 01:12:31,681
I'm sorry, Jack.

1359
01:12:31,682 --> 01:12:35,144
I covered for you guys as long as I could.

1360
01:12:37,354 --> 01:12:39,064
You covered for us?

1361
01:12:41,275 --> 01:12:42,067
Yeah.

1362
01:12:45,029 --> 01:12:46,529
That's a lie.

1363
01:12:46,530 --> 01:12:47,823
That's not true.

1364
01:12:48,949 --> 01:12:51,034
Come on, Jack.

1365
01:12:51,035 --> 01:12:52,410
Larry and Stan were in here.

1366
01:12:52,411 --> 01:12:54,412
They already admitted
that I covered for them.

1367
01:12:54,413 --> 01:12:55,913
Now, come on!

1368
01:12:55,914 --> 01:12:59,126
It's time for you to be a stand-up guy.

1369
01:13:00,836 --> 01:13:04,672
Larry and Stan would say
anything you wanted them to say.

1370
01:13:04,673 --> 01:13:06,383
They need their jobs.

1371
01:13:08,385 --> 01:13:10,178
You want me to be a stand-up guy?

1372
01:13:10,179 --> 01:13:11,971
Okay, I'll be a stand-up guy.

1373
01:13:11,972 --> 01:13:16,101
I need my job too, but what's
going on here is wrong.

1374
01:13:18,645 --> 01:13:20,688
If I did such a bad job,

1375
01:13:20,689 --> 01:13:22,440
why did production go down

1376
01:13:22,441 --> 01:13:26,110
and costs go up after you fired me, huh?

1377
01:13:26,111 --> 01:13:27,987
Look, I don't know what this guy told you.

1378
01:13:27,988 --> 01:13:31,532
I don't know what he does with his books.

1379
01:13:31,533 --> 01:13:33,159
I'm a car maker.

1380
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:34,285
I make cars.

1381
01:13:34,286 --> 01:13:35,703
I'm not an accountant.

1382
01:13:35,704 --> 01:13:36,871
But I'll tell you something.

1383
01:13:36,872 --> 01:13:39,874
I take a lot of pride in my work.

1384
01:13:39,875 --> 01:13:40,667
Dad?

1385
01:13:42,169 --> 01:13:44,462
Son, you're gonna have
to get out of here now.

1386
01:13:44,463 --> 01:13:46,172
This is a meeting.

1387
01:13:46,173 --> 01:13:47,340
Just a minute, Alex.

1388
01:13:47,341 --> 01:13:48,299
Daddy's talking.

1389
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:50,802
I know it's not real
popular right now, you know,

1390
01:13:50,803 --> 01:13:53,262
taking pride in your work, but I did.

1391
01:13:53,263 --> 01:13:54,305
I cared.

1392
01:13:54,306 --> 01:13:55,640
You fired me for it.

1393
01:13:55,641 --> 01:13:57,308
If you ever talk to my
kid like that again,

1394
01:13:57,309 --> 01:13:58,977
I'm knocking you out.

1395
01:14:09,196 --> 01:14:10,572
Forget the paper.

1396
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:14,325
There we go.

1397
01:14:14,326 --> 01:14:15,202
That's it.

1398
01:14:17,496 --> 01:14:19,540
Would you forget the pa--

1399
01:14:35,013 --> 01:14:38,182
Schooner Tuna commercial, take 24.

1400
01:14:38,183 --> 01:14:39,226
And action.

1401
01:14:41,478 --> 01:14:44,856
I'm Howard Humphries,
President of Schooner Tuna.

1402
01:14:44,857 --> 01:14:46,983
All of us here--

1403
01:14:46,984 --> 01:14:48,317
Cut, cut.

1404
01:14:48,318 --> 01:14:49,735
Cut it.

1405
01:14:49,736 --> 01:14:50,570
Caroline?

1406
01:14:50,571 --> 01:14:51,404
Caroline?

1407
01:14:51,405 --> 01:14:52,238
Telephone, Bill.

1408
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:54,907
There's an emotional element missing.

1409
01:14:54,908 --> 01:14:57,326
Oh, for god's sake, what
does he want now, Caroline?

1410
01:14:57,327 --> 01:15:01,080
Wait a second, I'll take care of this.

1411
01:15:01,081 --> 01:15:01,957
What is it?

1412
01:15:04,585 --> 01:15:06,836
Can't you control him?

1413
01:15:06,837 --> 01:15:08,296
I want to say, "My fellow Americans."

1414
01:15:08,297 --> 01:15:09,881
Gaffer tape, please?

1415
01:15:09,882 --> 01:15:10,924
Fine, fine.

1416
01:15:12,050 --> 01:15:13,426
Okay, folks, one more time.

1417
01:15:13,427 --> 01:15:14,552
Quiet, please!

1418
01:15:14,553 --> 01:15:16,721
Clear it.

1419
01:15:16,722 --> 01:15:17,763
- Caroline?
- Mm-hmm.

1420
01:15:17,764 --> 01:15:20,808
How about a little dinner
after all this is over?

1421
01:15:20,809 --> 01:15:21,934
No, I don't think so.

1422
01:15:21,935 --> 01:15:23,061
I'm too tired.

1423
01:15:24,104 --> 01:15:25,521
As soon as this is over, I
want to go back to the hotel

1424
01:15:25,522 --> 01:15:26,647
and soak in a hot tub.

1425
01:15:26,648 --> 01:15:28,566
That's all I want to do.

1426
01:15:28,567 --> 01:15:29,358
Yeah.

1427
01:15:29,359 --> 01:15:30,651
That sounds like a great idea.

1428
01:15:32,237 --> 01:15:33,654
Quiet!

1429
01:15:33,655 --> 01:15:36,617
Schooner Tuna commercial, take 25.

1430
01:15:38,452 --> 01:15:40,203
My fellow Americans--

1431
01:15:40,204 --> 01:15:41,454
I actually thought I had a job there

1432
01:15:41,455 --> 01:15:43,122
for about 30 seconds today.

1433
01:15:43,123 --> 01:15:45,458
Hey, Jack, forget about it.

1434
01:15:45,459 --> 01:15:48,711
The most important thing is
that you didn't get fired.

1435
01:15:48,712 --> 01:15:50,338
- That's right.
- That's right.

1436
01:15:50,339 --> 01:15:52,215
That's a good way to look at it, I guess.

1437
01:15:52,216 --> 01:15:54,634
Listen, you guys get in now and go,

1438
01:15:54,635 --> 01:15:57,094
and I'm gonna get a cab.

1439
01:15:57,095 --> 01:15:58,054
We sprang for dinner!

1440
01:15:58,055 --> 01:16:00,014
You can't walk out on us now!

1441
01:16:00,015 --> 01:16:01,140
Come on, get in.

1442
01:16:01,141 --> 01:16:02,183
Where are you taking me?

1443
01:16:02,184 --> 01:16:04,311
Come on, get in the car.

1444
01:16:05,395 --> 01:16:06,188
Got him!

1445
01:16:41,932 --> 01:16:42,808
Oh, my god!

1446
01:16:45,143 --> 01:16:46,644
These aren't the same
guys from the space shuttle,

1447
01:16:46,645 --> 01:16:47,437
are they?

1448
01:17:00,534 --> 01:17:01,410
Hey, Flash!

1449
01:17:04,997 --> 01:17:06,163
Wow!

1450
01:17:08,083 --> 01:17:10,084
Don't look now, but I
think he's looking at you.

1451
01:17:10,085 --> 01:17:11,295
No, he's not.

1452
01:17:13,088 --> 01:17:15,215
Okay.

1453
01:17:17,217 --> 01:17:18,926
Remember, you don't know
where this has been.

1454
01:17:20,721 --> 01:17:22,263
Where's he putting it?

1455
01:17:22,264 --> 01:17:23,180
No, don't tell me,

1456
01:17:23,181 --> 01:17:25,641
don't tell me, don't
tell me, don't tell me.

1457
01:17:25,642 --> 01:17:27,685
Oh, my god.

1458
01:17:27,686 --> 01:17:28,978
Hey, wait, Flash!

1459
01:17:28,979 --> 01:17:30,062
Wait for me!

1460
01:17:30,063 --> 01:17:30,896
Hey, Joan!

1461
01:17:30,897 --> 01:17:32,106
Hey, seriously, this--

1462
01:17:32,107 --> 01:17:32,899
Ohh.

1463
01:17:34,318 --> 01:17:35,443
We're going to jail.

1464
01:17:36,695 --> 01:17:37,487
Who cares?

1465
01:17:47,122 --> 01:17:49,081
All right, girls.

1466
01:17:49,082 --> 01:17:51,375
Next time I'll call you, all right?

1467
01:17:51,376 --> 01:17:52,376
Don't bother calling me.

1468
01:17:53,295 --> 01:17:54,462
Seriously, it was fun.

1469
01:17:54,463 --> 01:17:55,296
I'll see you.

1470
01:17:55,297 --> 01:17:56,922
Here, take this.

1471
01:17:56,923 --> 01:17:57,882
I don't think I'm gonna need it.

1472
01:17:57,883 --> 01:17:58,716
What is it?

1473
01:17:58,717 --> 01:18:00,426
It's that dancer's telephone number.

1474
01:18:02,804 --> 01:18:04,472
Good-bye!

1475
01:18:04,473 --> 01:18:06,098
Will all the passengers be sure

1476
01:18:06,099 --> 01:18:09,602
to have their baggage checked
before boarding the buses.

1477
01:18:09,603 --> 01:18:10,478
Will Mrs. Turner--

1478
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:11,729
Annette?

1479
01:18:11,730 --> 01:18:14,023
Mrs. Turner,
please come to the desk.

1480
01:18:14,024 --> 01:18:16,484
Will Mrs. Turner please come to the desk.

1481
01:18:16,485 --> 01:18:19,111
So, that's why you offered
to sit with the kids.

1482
01:18:20,864 --> 01:18:24,200
You knew where they were
taking me, didn't you?

1483
01:18:24,201 --> 01:18:25,242
Daddy?

1484
01:18:25,243 --> 01:18:26,077
Hi.

1485
01:18:26,078 --> 01:18:27,995
Come on, I'm taking you guys to bed.

1486
01:18:27,996 --> 01:18:29,705
Can we call mommy?

1487
01:18:29,706 --> 01:18:31,582
No, we can't, she's in California.

1488
01:18:31,583 --> 01:18:34,377
I want to talk to mommy too.

1489
01:18:34,378 --> 01:18:35,711
Come on, guys, go to bed.

1490
01:18:35,712 --> 01:18:37,088
We'll call her in the morning.

1491
01:18:37,089 --> 01:18:40,133
Well, it's only 8:30 in California.

1492
01:18:41,718 --> 01:18:43,928
Good point, Annette.

1493
01:18:43,929 --> 01:18:44,721
All right.

1494
01:18:59,986 --> 01:19:02,280
Okay, be very, very quiet.

1495
01:19:04,282 --> 01:19:06,743
Okay.

1496
01:19:08,203 --> 01:19:11,497
Right around here would be fine.

1497
01:19:11,498 --> 01:19:12,665
Incidentally, I really

1498
01:19:12,666 --> 01:19:15,334
appreciate this very, very much.

1499
01:19:15,335 --> 01:19:17,629
Oh, I'm quite sure you do.

1500
01:19:31,226 --> 01:19:33,894
♫ Strangers in the night

1501
01:19:33,895 --> 01:19:36,522
♫ Exchanging glances

1502
01:19:36,523 --> 01:19:39,483
♫ Wandering in the night

1503
01:19:40,777 --> 01:19:42,403
♫ What were the chances

1504
01:19:42,404 --> 01:19:43,446
♫ We'd be sharing love

1505
01:19:43,447 --> 01:19:44,780
Hello?

1506
01:19:44,781 --> 01:19:45,532
Alex who?

1507
01:19:46,825 --> 01:19:47,700
I don't know.

1508
01:19:47,701 --> 01:19:48,493
Some guy.

1509
01:19:49,870 --> 01:19:51,287
Let me see.

1510
01:19:51,288 --> 01:19:52,580
Is Caroline Butler there?

1511
01:19:52,581 --> 01:19:53,581
She's in the tub.

1512
01:19:53,582 --> 01:19:54,541
Who is this?

1513
01:19:55,792 --> 01:19:58,043
This is her husband,
who the hell is this?

1514
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:13,726
Who was that on my phone?

1515
01:20:13,727 --> 01:20:17,105
Wrong number.

1516
01:20:18,190 --> 01:20:19,648
Ron, what are you doing?

1517
01:20:19,649 --> 01:20:23,944
Well, somebody has got
to pour the champagne.

1518
01:20:23,945 --> 01:20:25,237
You've been drinking
a lot, haven't you, Ron?

1519
01:20:25,238 --> 01:20:26,614
Moi?

1520
01:20:26,615 --> 01:20:28,240
Yep, a lot.

1521
01:20:28,241 --> 01:20:30,743
I think I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave now, okay?

1522
01:20:30,744 --> 01:20:31,577
Why?

1523
01:20:31,578 --> 01:20:33,746
There are no kids to go home to tonight.

1524
01:20:33,747 --> 01:20:35,080
Ron, get out.

1525
01:20:35,081 --> 01:20:37,875
We could make a great team, Caroline.

1526
01:20:37,876 --> 01:20:38,709
Really?

1527
01:20:38,710 --> 01:20:39,835
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

1528
01:20:39,836 --> 01:20:42,505
Well, basically, you
dump Jack, you marry me,

1529
01:20:42,506 --> 01:20:45,925
and it's Richardson,
Frankel and Richardson.

1530
01:20:45,926 --> 01:20:46,759
Come on.

1531
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:49,136
What are you trying to tell me,
that you're in love with me?

1532
01:20:49,137 --> 01:20:51,680
Hell, no, but the client is.

1533
01:20:51,681 --> 01:20:52,515
All right, Ron.

1534
01:20:52,516 --> 01:20:54,934
This is my official
warning to you, get out!

1535
01:20:54,935 --> 01:20:57,269
You are so adorable when you're angry.

1536
01:20:57,270 --> 01:20:58,354
Ron, get out.

1537
01:20:58,355 --> 01:20:59,188
I'm not kidding.

1538
01:20:59,189 --> 01:21:01,817
- Ron!
- Oh, don't be coy with--

1539
01:21:04,528 --> 01:21:06,862
Oh, trying to play hard to get, huh?

1540
01:21:10,659 --> 01:21:11,575
Aren't you gonna answer that?

1541
01:21:11,576 --> 01:21:13,953
That's the fourth time
it's rung in the last hour.

1542
01:21:13,954 --> 01:21:15,246
Oh, do you want me to answer it?

1543
01:21:15,247 --> 01:21:16,413
Yeah!

1544
01:21:16,414 --> 01:21:18,123
Oh, okay.

1545
01:21:18,124 --> 01:21:18,958
Here we go.

1546
01:21:18,959 --> 01:21:19,792
Hello?

1547
01:21:19,793 --> 01:21:20,793
Okay?

1548
01:21:20,794 --> 01:21:22,753
Nobody there, I guess.

1549
01:21:27,133 --> 01:21:28,467
Oh.

1550
01:21:28,468 --> 01:21:31,512
Well, you probably want to be alone, huh?

1551
01:21:31,513 --> 01:21:33,055
Okay, good.

1552
01:21:33,056 --> 01:21:34,056
All righty.

1553
01:21:34,057 --> 01:21:36,100
Well, you try to get some sleep now, okay?

1554
01:21:36,101 --> 01:21:37,351
And don't worry.

1555
01:21:37,352 --> 01:21:38,895
My lips are sealed.

1556
01:21:44,526 --> 01:21:48,237
Won't be so bad
when I get your bangs rolled.

1557
01:21:48,238 --> 01:21:49,114
Horrible.

1558
01:21:49,990 --> 01:21:52,491
I don't think I'll be called
upon to defend my honor.

1559
01:21:52,492 --> 01:21:53,742
I doubt it.

1560
01:21:58,331 --> 01:22:01,125
I promised Jack I wouldn't say anything.

1561
01:22:01,126 --> 01:22:04,712
Now, remember, this is
in strictest confidence.

1562
01:22:04,713 --> 01:22:05,796
Of course!

1563
01:22:42,667 --> 01:22:43,459
Oh, good.

1564
01:22:43,460 --> 01:22:44,836
Another grown-up.

1565
01:22:50,550 --> 01:22:52,051
What happened?

1566
01:22:52,052 --> 01:22:54,720
Dad's making some minor changes.

1567
01:22:58,475 --> 01:22:59,351
Hi, Joan.

1568
01:23:00,435 --> 01:23:01,769
Just doing a little work around the house.

1569
01:23:01,770 --> 01:23:02,603
Kenny!

1570
01:23:02,604 --> 01:23:04,897
Don't paint your sister!

1571
01:23:04,898 --> 01:23:06,065
Hey, Butler!

1572
01:23:06,066 --> 01:23:07,733
Guess what?

1573
01:23:07,734 --> 01:23:10,319
You had quite a burst of
nervous energy last night.

1574
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:11,153
Yeah.

1575
01:23:11,154 --> 01:23:12,613
You should have called me.

1576
01:23:12,614 --> 01:23:13,906
Hey, Butler!

1577
01:23:13,907 --> 01:23:14,740
Yeah?

1578
01:23:14,741 --> 01:23:16,617
I think I found your problem.

1579
01:23:16,618 --> 01:23:17,451
What is it?

1580
01:23:17,452 --> 01:23:18,285
This shoe.

1581
01:23:18,286 --> 01:23:19,286
Oh.

1582
01:23:19,287 --> 01:23:20,120
Kids.

1583
01:23:20,121 --> 01:23:21,664
Huh.

1584
01:23:21,665 --> 01:23:23,123
Doris, this is a friend of mine, Joan.

1585
01:23:23,124 --> 01:23:24,166
TV.

1586
01:23:24,167 --> 01:23:25,668
Hi.

1587
01:23:25,669 --> 01:23:27,419
Kitchen's clean.

1588
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:28,879
Hi, Joan.

1589
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:30,756
I'm gonna check your basement for bugs.

1590
01:23:30,757 --> 01:23:33,717
I sure hope I don't find any.

1591
01:23:33,718 --> 01:23:36,637
Eww, I'm all grimy and sweaty here.

1592
01:23:36,638 --> 01:23:39,098
Joan, I'm gonna go
upstairs and take a shower.

1593
01:23:39,099 --> 01:23:40,015
You can get a drink.

1594
01:23:40,016 --> 01:23:41,141
You know where we keep everything.

1595
01:23:41,142 --> 01:23:44,354
Or watch television, whatever you want.

1596
01:23:53,863 --> 01:23:54,656
Oh, wow!

1597
01:24:02,122 --> 01:24:02,914
Ooh.

1598
01:24:07,544 --> 01:24:09,044
Hey, Jack!

1599
01:24:09,045 --> 01:24:11,881
I love what you did to the bedroom!

1600
01:24:13,299 --> 01:24:14,092
Damn.

1601
01:24:16,177 --> 01:24:17,052
Thanks.

1602
01:24:17,053 --> 01:24:18,804
It's amazing what you
can do with a Sears card.

1603
01:24:18,805 --> 01:24:21,766
That's from their Safari collection.

1604
01:24:26,062 --> 01:24:27,522
You got a problem.

1605
01:24:29,232 --> 01:24:30,025
Okay.

1606
01:24:33,111 --> 01:24:33,903
All right.

1607
01:24:35,071 --> 01:24:37,407
A, she's an attractive woman.

1608
01:24:39,701 --> 01:24:41,578
B, she wants you, Jack.

1609
01:24:44,247 --> 01:24:45,707
She wants you bad.

1610
01:24:46,666 --> 01:24:47,459
C?

1611
01:24:49,627 --> 01:24:52,463
I don't even want to think about "C."

1612
01:24:52,464 --> 01:24:53,256
D,

1613
01:24:55,925 --> 01:24:57,509
Kenny'd talk.

1614
01:24:57,510 --> 01:24:59,011
Alex?

1615
01:24:59,012 --> 01:25:00,721
Alex would be okay.

1616
01:25:00,722 --> 01:25:01,847
Kenny'd talk.

1617
01:25:01,848 --> 01:25:03,098
He'd crack.

1618
01:25:17,572 --> 01:25:19,199
M, I'm a free agent.

1619
01:25:20,325 --> 01:25:23,160
N, I could be in the middle of it,

1620
01:25:23,161 --> 01:25:25,370
I could have a heart attack, I could die.

1621
01:25:25,371 --> 01:25:27,956
Caroline walks in, sees me there.

1622
01:25:27,957 --> 01:25:29,667
I die and get caught.

1623
01:25:30,585 --> 01:25:31,377
Joan?

1624
01:25:32,629 --> 01:25:33,545
Caroline!

1625
01:25:33,546 --> 01:25:36,256
What are you doing in my bedroom?

1626
01:25:36,257 --> 01:25:37,092
Huh?

1627
01:25:38,218 --> 01:25:40,595
This is my bedroom, isn't it?

1628
01:25:42,222 --> 01:25:43,347
Yeah.

1629
01:25:43,348 --> 01:25:45,975
Well, what are you doing here?

1630
01:25:47,310 --> 01:25:50,187
Is it too early for a drink?

1631
01:25:50,188 --> 01:25:51,356
All right, Y.

1632
01:25:53,525 --> 01:25:56,236
Why did I get rid of that Woobie?

1633
01:25:57,362 --> 01:25:59,989
Z, you're not gonna do anything,

1634
01:26:02,784 --> 01:26:06,913
'cause you, my friend, are
in love with your wife.

1635
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:09,373
Joan?

1636
01:26:09,374 --> 01:26:10,207
Jack.

1637
01:26:10,208 --> 01:26:11,041
Caroline?

1638
01:26:11,042 --> 01:26:11,875
Well, now that we
have the names straight,

1639
01:26:11,876 --> 01:26:12,793
would you mind explaining to me

1640
01:26:12,794 --> 01:26:15,087
why I come all the way
home to talk to you,

1641
01:26:15,088 --> 01:26:17,214
and I find another woman in our room?

1642
01:26:17,215 --> 01:26:18,757
Oh, look who's talking.

1643
01:26:18,758 --> 01:26:21,260
I called your hotel,
Richardson answers the phone,

1644
01:26:21,261 --> 01:26:24,471
and I hear champagne
chilling in the background?

1645
01:26:24,472 --> 01:26:25,305
You heard that?

1646
01:26:25,306 --> 01:26:26,431
Aha!

1647
01:26:26,432 --> 01:26:27,850
Now, I'd appreciate it

1648
01:26:27,851 --> 01:26:28,851
if you just don't talk to me right now,

1649
01:26:28,852 --> 01:26:31,228
because I'm doing my best
to calm down, all right?

1650
01:26:32,063 --> 01:26:35,315
Excuse me, I have a household to run.

1651
01:26:35,316 --> 01:26:36,775
Oh, Jack!

1652
01:26:39,821 --> 01:26:40,654
Hello.

1653
01:26:40,655 --> 01:26:41,905
Oh, Jack.

1654
01:26:41,906 --> 01:26:43,031
I'm in a lot of trouble.

1655
01:26:43,032 --> 01:26:44,449
Look, I'm not talking to you.

1656
01:26:44,450 --> 01:26:45,576
No, no, please.

1657
01:26:45,577 --> 01:26:47,119
Listen to me.

1658
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:49,830
I cut the department to the
bone, and they caught me.

1659
01:26:49,831 --> 01:26:51,415
I've gotta have you back.

1660
01:26:51,416 --> 01:26:53,292
I'll do anything.

1661
01:26:53,293 --> 01:26:54,918
Dad, is mommy home?

1662
01:26:54,919 --> 01:26:56,211
Not now, kid!

1663
01:26:56,212 --> 01:26:57,671
I'm talking here!

1664
01:26:57,672 --> 01:26:59,299
Warned you, Jinx.

1665
01:27:00,216 --> 01:27:01,009
Ohh!

1666
01:27:01,926 --> 01:27:03,303
Gee, one punch!

1667
01:27:04,637 --> 01:27:05,846
You want a company car?

1668
01:27:05,847 --> 01:27:06,680
One punch!

1669
01:27:06,681 --> 01:27:07,472
One punch!
- Caroline?

1670
01:27:07,473 --> 01:27:09,349
Oh, I've caught you at a bad time.

1671
01:27:09,350 --> 01:27:10,559
Hey, don't hit me, Jack.

1672
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:11,643
I like what you've done with the place.

1673
01:27:11,644 --> 01:27:12,811
Gotta get a new tube.

1674
01:27:12,812 --> 01:27:13,729
Ron!

1675
01:27:13,730 --> 01:27:16,023
Caroline, I am begging you.

1676
01:27:16,024 --> 01:27:17,232
Humphries is gonna pull the whole account

1677
01:27:17,233 --> 01:27:18,358
unless you come back to work.

1678
01:27:18,359 --> 01:27:21,028
I told this guy last
night ten times that I quit.

1679
01:27:21,029 --> 01:27:22,321
What'd he do, make a pass?

1680
01:27:22,322 --> 01:27:26,283
I just got a little out
of hand, and she belted me.

1681
01:27:26,284 --> 01:27:27,326
You quit your job?

1682
01:27:27,327 --> 01:27:28,327
I didn't like that job.

1683
01:27:28,328 --> 01:27:30,120
I'm gonna get another job, a better one!

1684
01:27:30,121 --> 01:27:32,122
Anyway, I miss my family.

1685
01:27:32,123 --> 01:27:33,540
I thought you loved that job.

1686
01:27:33,541 --> 01:27:34,374
Thanks.

1687
01:27:34,375 --> 01:27:36,376
How about three days at the
office and two days at home?

1688
01:27:36,377 --> 01:27:37,252
Thanks.

1689
01:27:37,253 --> 01:27:38,545
There's no way I can do that.

1690
01:27:38,546 --> 01:27:40,756
Jack, will you listen to me?

1691
01:27:40,757 --> 01:27:42,758
Management wants you back!

1692
01:27:42,759 --> 01:27:44,176
Jack!

1693
01:27:44,177 --> 01:27:45,010
Thanks.

1694
01:27:45,011 --> 01:27:46,595
- Basement's clean.
- Okay.

1695
01:27:46,596 --> 01:27:47,471
Oh, thanks.

1696
01:27:47,472 --> 01:27:49,848
Look, he's offering me full
salary and a company car.

1697
01:27:49,849 --> 01:27:50,682
What do you think?

1698
01:27:50,683 --> 01:27:52,392
- Are you kidding, take it.
- Okay, look, Bert,

1699
01:27:52,393 --> 01:27:54,394
tell him I don't make a
move without Larry and Stan.

1700
01:27:54,395 --> 01:27:56,104
He doesn't make a move
without Larry and Stan.

1701
01:27:56,105 --> 01:27:58,065
Oh, you got a deal.

1702
01:27:58,066 --> 01:27:59,733
- Who are Larry and Stan?
- Thanks.

1703
01:27:59,734 --> 01:28:01,109
You're a working woman,
can't you understand?

1704
01:28:01,110 --> 01:28:03,987
I'll tell you something else.

1705
01:28:03,988 --> 01:28:05,530
You really hit him?

1706
01:28:05,531 --> 01:28:08,158
Don't you think I know
how to take care of myself?

1707
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:08,952
Well...

1708
01:28:10,119 --> 01:28:11,954
Hurt your hand?

1709
01:28:11,955 --> 01:28:12,747
No.

1710
01:28:15,708 --> 01:28:16,751
Missed you.

1711
01:28:18,836 --> 01:28:20,545
I missed you too.

1712
01:28:27,637 --> 01:28:30,889
My fellow Americans,
I am Howard Humphries,

1713
01:28:30,890 --> 01:28:32,975
President of Schooner Tuna.

1714
01:28:32,976 --> 01:28:35,519
All of us here at Schooner Tuna sympathize

1715
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:37,354
with those of you hit so hard

1716
01:28:37,355 --> 01:28:39,898
by these trying economic times.

1717
01:28:39,899 --> 01:28:41,525
In order to help you,

1718
01:28:41,526 --> 01:28:43,944
we are reducing the price of Schooner Tuna

1719
01:28:43,945 --> 01:28:46,113
by 50 cents a can.

1720
01:28:46,114 --> 01:28:47,364
When this crisis is over,

1721
01:28:47,365 --> 01:28:49,700
we will go back to our regular prices.

1722
01:28:49,701 --> 01:28:53,745
Until then, remember,
we're all in this together.

1723
01:28:53,746 --> 01:28:55,455
Schooner Tuna.

1724
01:28:55,456 --> 01:28:57,374
The tuna with a heart.
