1
00:02:29,766 --> 00:02:32,769
Don't you love New Orleans?

2
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:49,202
Come on over here
and dance with me.

3
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:21,901
Look what she ordered.

4
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,945
Come here, honey.

5
00:03:23,945 --> 00:03:27,907
Darling, 11 months is
a little young for jambalaya.

6
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:30,535
The doctor said we should
start her on solids.

7
00:03:30,535 --> 00:03:31,953
Jambalaya's not solids.

8
00:03:31,953 --> 00:03:34,330
He meant mushed-up
carrots and beets.

9
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,623
That's for average kids.

10
00:03:35,623 --> 00:03:37,833
Look, sweetheart. See?

11
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,460
That's delicious.

12
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,796
It's not spicy at all.

13
00:03:41,796 --> 00:03:43,214
Jeff...

14
00:03:43,214 --> 00:03:46,300
Come on. I rest my case.

15
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,052
Isn't she great?

16
00:03:48,052 --> 00:03:51,013
She's great. You're great.

17
00:03:54,392 --> 00:03:56,394
They said
their name was Truman?

18
00:03:56,394 --> 00:03:58,396
-Newman.
-Ah, Newman.

19
00:03:58,396 --> 00:04:00,898
You better get out of there.

20
00:04:00,898 --> 00:04:03,484
Hey, Newman.

21
00:04:03,484 --> 00:04:05,278
Isn't New Orleans great?

22
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:07,154
Great.
Would you like a beer?

23
00:04:07,154 --> 00:04:08,781
-Sure.
-Two, please.

24
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:11,200
-Do you folks travel much?
-A lot. Yeah.

25
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,328
We've cut down
ever since the baby.

26
00:04:14,328 --> 00:04:16,414
What line are you in?

27
00:04:16,414 --> 00:04:20,501
Brain surgery.
Professional brain surgery.

28
00:04:20,501 --> 00:04:22,503
That's a hell of a field.
Challenging.

29
00:04:22,503 --> 00:04:25,756
Actually, I'm thinking
about giving it up.

30
00:04:25,756 --> 00:04:27,842
The racket's getting to me.

31
00:04:27,842 --> 00:04:30,511
I was working with patients
who'd undergone severe trauma...

32
00:04:30,511 --> 00:04:34,098
to the patella,
here in the front of the brain.

33
00:04:34,098 --> 00:04:37,893
You get whacked there,
you start going in circles...

34
00:04:37,893 --> 00:04:39,812
lose all sense of direction.

35
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:41,647
I read about that
in ''People'' magazine.

36
00:04:41,647 --> 00:04:45,609
You did? The pressure
started getting to me.

37
00:04:45,609 --> 00:04:49,071
My hands started shaking.
Dropping scalpels everywhere.

38
00:04:49,071 --> 00:04:51,699
Somebody's pulling our leg.

39
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:54,785
-Almost had you.
-Not me.

40
00:04:54,785 --> 00:04:58,456
-What do you really do?
-We're in espionage.

41
00:04:58,456 --> 00:05:04,045
-Were. We're retired.
-And that's the truth.

42
00:05:04,045 --> 00:05:07,256
I love crashing parties.

43
00:05:07,256 --> 00:05:09,050
You didn't know those people?

44
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,969
-They didn't know us, either.
-You guys are too much.

45
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:16,557
-You ain't seen nothing yet.
-Oh, yeah, Mr. Spy?

46
00:05:17,975 --> 00:05:20,853
You're not planning on
smoking that in the room?

47
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:22,772
I certainly am...

48
00:05:22,772 --> 00:05:25,149
not planning on smoking
this in the room.

49
00:05:25,149 --> 00:05:28,778
-I'll Jane for a walk.
-Louise.

50
00:05:28,778 --> 00:05:30,613
Get some formula
while you're out?

51
00:05:30,613 --> 00:05:32,490
Sure. Night, folks.

52
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,241
Bye-bye.
I'm with you.

53
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:36,535
I'd never let Vern smoke
a cigar in the room.

54
00:05:36,535 --> 00:05:38,037
Jane Louise!

55
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:41,040
Is her name Jane Louise
or Louise Jane?

56
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,541
We can't agree.

57
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:48,047
I think it's strange to name
a girl after her mother.

58
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:51,467
Men do it all the time,
name the boys after themselves.

59
00:05:51,467 --> 00:05:52,968
Why not the women?

60
00:05:52,968 --> 00:05:56,639
Sweetheart,
why don't we let them decide?

61
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,141
By the time I finish this...

62
00:05:59,141 --> 00:06:01,644
it'll be ready
for my child's child.

63
00:06:09,318 --> 00:06:12,029
What are you doing?

64
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:14,698
Help! Don't hurt me!

65
00:06:15,824 --> 00:06:19,203
Don't forget the watch.
Shut up, fat boy.

66
00:06:22,456 --> 00:06:27,086
My name is Muerte!
Don't you forget that.

67
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:28,546
Can we go?

68
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,722
Come on, man!

69
00:06:38,722 --> 00:06:41,350
-l want to go home.
-No, no, no.

70
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,894
That's three.
Let's call it a night.

71
00:06:43,894 --> 00:06:46,105
-Not yet!
-There's going to be cops.

72
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:50,442
No! I want one more.

73
00:06:50,442 --> 00:06:52,611
Damn.

74
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:54,697
And here he comes.

75
00:06:58,242 --> 00:07:01,370
Relax, guys,
the baby won't hurt you.

76
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,331
Give me the wallet
and the watch.

77
00:07:04,331 --> 00:07:07,126
Look, this is a real baby.

78
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:08,627
I don't want any trouble.

79
00:07:08,627 --> 00:07:10,129
Then hand it over.

80
00:07:17,428 --> 00:07:19,054
Let's go. The watch.

81
00:07:19,054 --> 00:07:20,764
It's a Swatch.

82
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:27,646
Are we finished? Can I go?

83
00:07:30,941 --> 00:07:32,776
We had a deal.

84
00:07:32,776 --> 00:07:34,945
You commit a felony.
I go.

85
00:07:41,201 --> 00:07:45,873
My name is Muerte.

86
00:07:45,873 --> 00:07:49,460
Pleased to meet you, Morty.
My name is Jeff.

87
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,628
Ozzie! Cut him!

88
00:08:00,971 --> 00:08:03,474
This is a really bad idea,
Morty.

89
00:08:11,857 --> 00:08:15,444
You sleep through anything,
don't you, honey?

90
00:08:16,445 --> 00:08:18,489
I'll kill you, asshole.

91
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:27,289
You sucker.

92
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:29,833
En garde. Parry. Thrust!

93
00:08:33,587 --> 00:08:38,091
It's a very fortunate thing
for you my wife wasn't here.

94
00:08:40,427 --> 00:08:44,097
My good girl, isn't she?

95
00:08:44,097 --> 00:08:45,599
Yeah.

96
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:47,100
Lovely evening, isn't it?

97
00:08:54,775 --> 00:08:58,111
Hi, honey.
Did you get the formula?

98
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,780
I completely forgot.

99
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,866
-Daydreaming?
-Obviously.

100
00:09:02,866 --> 00:09:06,036
Jeff?
What happened to the stroller?

101
00:09:10,374 --> 00:09:13,627
It's a bad world,
isn't it, sweetheart?

102
00:09:13,627 --> 00:09:17,589
You and me and Mom
are going to make it better.

103
00:09:42,155 --> 00:09:43,865
New Orleans Police Department.

104
00:09:43,865 --> 00:09:47,578
Did you see a gentleman
with a baby stroller?

105
00:09:47,578 --> 00:09:51,164
That's Mr. Blue.
He's upstairs in his room.

106
00:09:51,164 --> 00:09:52,499
Thank you very much.

107
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,545
What did happen
to that stroller?

108
00:09:56,545 --> 00:09:58,630
Put something on.
The cops are coming.

109
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:02,593
-The cops are coming?
-Big badges, blue uniforms.

110
00:10:02,593 --> 00:10:03,802
Why?

111
00:10:09,349 --> 00:10:10,851
Officers.

112
00:10:10,851 --> 00:10:13,729
-Jeff Blue?
-That's me.

113
00:10:13,729 --> 00:10:16,273
Lieutenant Theodore Sawyer,
New Orleans Police Department.

114
00:10:16,273 --> 00:10:18,275
This is
Detective Sergeant Halsey.

115
00:10:18,275 --> 00:10:21,236
That's Halsey.
S-e-y, not s-y.

116
00:10:21,236 --> 00:10:22,738
May we come in?

117
00:10:22,738 --> 00:10:24,948
Sure thing, Ted.
You bet. My pleasure.

118
00:10:27,451 --> 00:10:31,204
I'm a great admirer
of the New Orleans Police.

119
00:10:31,204 --> 00:10:34,166
How's Clay Shaw?

120
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,918
That's really hilarious.

121
00:10:36,918 --> 00:10:39,671
-This is my wife Jane.
-Evening.

122
00:10:39,671 --> 00:10:41,673
This is Lieutenant Sawyer.

123
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:43,675
-Lieutenant.
-Sergeant Halsey.

124
00:10:43,675 --> 00:10:44,885
-Sergeant.
-Ma'am.

125
00:10:44,885 --> 00:10:46,678
Please excuse the robe,
gentlemen.

126
00:10:46,678 --> 00:10:49,806
I wasn't expecting the police
at this hour.

127
00:10:49,806 --> 00:10:51,892
Please, sit.

128
00:10:51,892 --> 00:10:55,187
Excuse us, ma'am.
We're working undercover--

129
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:57,898
A lieutenant undercover?
I would have thought...

130
00:10:57,898 --> 00:11:01,109
they'd have something
more important for you.

131
00:11:01,109 --> 00:11:02,778
With oil gone belly-up...

132
00:11:02,778 --> 00:11:04,654
tourism is
the biggest stuff there is.

133
00:11:04,654 --> 00:11:07,908
Folks getting knifed
in the French Quarter...

134
00:11:07,908 --> 00:11:12,496
annoys the hell out of
the Tourist Commission.

135
00:11:12,496 --> 00:11:16,249
There was an attempted
mugging this evening.

136
00:11:16,249 --> 00:11:17,459
Really?

137
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:19,961
-The victim got away.
-Oh, good.

138
00:11:19,961 --> 00:11:23,131
-You know nothing about that?
-No.

139
00:11:23,131 --> 00:11:25,175
You match the description
of the intended victim--

140
00:11:25,175 --> 00:11:27,260
a man with a baby stroller.

141
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:31,515
A bag lady says she saw
the man enter this hotel.

142
00:11:31,515 --> 00:11:33,683
The desk clerk
says that man was you.

143
00:11:33,683 --> 00:11:36,645
Certainly narrows it down,
doesn't it?

144
00:11:36,645 --> 00:11:40,899
Mr. Blue, were you involved
in an attempted mugging?

145
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:43,568
No, Ted, I don't think so.

146
00:11:43,568 --> 00:11:45,487
Would you mind
calling me Lieutenant?

147
00:11:45,487 --> 00:11:48,865
Ms. Blue...

148
00:11:48,865 --> 00:11:51,409
would you care
to make any comment?

149
00:11:53,203 --> 00:11:55,497
Not at this precise time.

150
00:11:59,334 --> 00:12:01,711
Mr. Blue,
can I see some ID, please?

151
00:12:01,711 --> 00:12:05,048
-You bet.
-One with a picture?

152
00:12:05,048 --> 00:12:07,175
Thank you.

153
00:12:07,175 --> 00:12:09,219
That's a good picture.

154
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:10,929
What do you do for a living?

155
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:12,722
I'm an Electrolux salesman.

156
00:12:12,722 --> 00:12:15,976
I don't know what brand
of vacuum cleaner you use...

157
00:12:15,976 --> 00:12:19,145
but the Electrolux
is the biggest sucker of all.

158
00:12:19,145 --> 00:12:22,065
Are you in New Orleans
on business?

159
00:12:22,065 --> 00:12:24,818
-Vacation.
-How long will you stay?

160
00:12:24,818 --> 00:12:28,071
Month, month and a half.

161
00:12:28,071 --> 00:12:29,865
Isn't that long for a vacation?

162
00:12:29,865 --> 00:12:32,075
Is it?

163
00:12:32,075 --> 00:12:35,412
Mr. Blue, if...

164
00:12:35,412 --> 00:12:36,788
If you know something...

165
00:12:36,788 --> 00:12:38,748
but you're afraid
to talk about it...

166
00:12:38,748 --> 00:12:41,001
we can give you
full protection.

167
00:12:41,001 --> 00:12:44,754
Thanks, but I really
don't know anything.

168
00:12:44,754 --> 00:12:46,756
Well, thank you, sir.

169
00:12:46,756 --> 00:12:49,884
Here's your ID,
and here's my card.

170
00:12:49,884 --> 00:12:52,429
If you change your mind,
please give us a call.

171
00:12:52,429 --> 00:12:55,098
-Will do.
-Bye, ma'am.

172
00:12:55,098 --> 00:12:58,268
That baby stroller's
taken quite a beating.

173
00:12:58,268 --> 00:13:01,146
Baggage handlers.

174
00:13:01,146 --> 00:13:03,189
-Good night.
-Good night.

175
00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:11,197
Let me see if
I understand this correctly.

176
00:13:11,197 --> 00:13:13,617
You took our child
into a knife fight?

177
00:13:13,617 --> 00:13:16,703
It was a fair fight--
two of them, two of us.

178
00:13:16,703 --> 00:13:18,663
Jeff, how could you?

179
00:13:18,663 --> 00:13:20,415
It wasn't my idea.

180
00:13:20,415 --> 00:13:22,667
You should have seen them,
complete amateurs.

181
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:26,004
Biggest risk was I'd fall down
laughing and hurt myself.

182
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:29,174
I won't do it again.

183
00:13:29,174 --> 00:13:31,676
This is Chapter Two
in which Jeff and Jane...

184
00:13:31,676 --> 00:13:35,180
have a child
and lead a normal life.

185
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,681
You forgot the formula.

186
00:13:42,145 --> 00:13:44,147
That's my boy, Metre.

187
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,652
I'm going to fuck him up.
Watch this. Hold my stick.

188
00:13:51,696 --> 00:13:53,740
Boy, this is gonna be good.

189
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,701
-Red.
-What can I do you?

190
00:13:56,701 --> 00:14:00,205
-Creme de menthe.
-Coming up.

191
00:14:00,205 --> 00:14:05,251
Hey, Muerte,
I heard you had some trouble.

192
00:14:05,251 --> 00:14:07,712
Yeah. You should
see the other guys--

193
00:14:07,712 --> 00:14:11,299
fifteen guys
with chains and dogs.

194
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:14,135
You should see
what they look like.

195
00:14:15,136 --> 00:14:17,180
I mean...

196
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,516
That ain't what I heard.

197
00:14:19,516 --> 00:14:22,644
I heard it was one guy...

198
00:14:22,644 --> 00:14:25,146
with a cute little tiny baby!

199
00:14:25,146 --> 00:14:28,066
Which one of them
done it to you, Muerte?

200
00:14:28,066 --> 00:14:29,651
Was it the guy...

201
00:14:29,651 --> 00:14:32,403
or that cute little tiny baby?

202
00:14:35,115 --> 00:14:37,158
My name is Muerte!

203
00:14:37,158 --> 00:14:38,785
My name is Death!

204
00:14:43,998 --> 00:14:46,668
Don't you forget that!

205
00:14:46,668 --> 00:14:49,420
Scumhooks!

206
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,673
So now he's looking for Blue.

207
00:14:51,673 --> 00:14:55,301
Great. Muerte's going
to be out for blood.

208
00:14:55,301 --> 00:14:57,178
He's a vindictive
little shit, Captain.

209
00:14:57,178 --> 00:14:59,180
Then you find him first.

210
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,057
That's not all.

211
00:15:01,057 --> 00:15:03,184
There's something strange
about this guy Blue...

212
00:15:03,184 --> 00:15:05,103
what he did to
Muerte and Ozzie.

213
00:15:05,103 --> 00:15:08,064
He was holding a baby,
so he did it one-handed.

214
00:15:08,064 --> 00:15:10,066
What are you saying?

215
00:15:10,066 --> 00:15:12,193
It takes special training.

216
00:15:12,193 --> 00:15:16,156
What I'm wondering is,
who is this guy? FBI?

217
00:15:16,156 --> 00:15:18,533
I don't think the FBI
is running anything...

218
00:15:18,533 --> 00:15:20,660
but you know how much
they tell us.

219
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,662
There's a guy
I knew in the service...

220
00:15:22,662 --> 00:15:24,664
works with the Bureau in D.C.

221
00:15:24,664 --> 00:15:26,541
Maybe I should check it out.

222
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:29,002
Stop wondering
and check it out.

223
00:15:29,002 --> 00:15:30,169
Right.

224
00:15:36,426 --> 00:15:39,637
FBI?
Dan Chesler, please.

225
00:15:39,637 --> 00:15:41,931
-His line is busy.
-I'll wait.

226
00:15:45,018 --> 00:15:46,853
Come on!

227
00:15:46,853 --> 00:15:49,063
-Chesler.
-Hey, Danny.

228
00:15:49,063 --> 00:15:51,691
Ted Sawyer here.
How you doing?

229
00:15:51,691 --> 00:15:54,694
Listen, ran into somebody
unusual down here.

230
00:15:54,694 --> 00:15:56,404
Was wondering if
he could be one of yours?

231
00:15:56,404 --> 00:15:58,698
Calls himself Jefferson Blue.

232
00:16:00,867 --> 00:16:03,202
Did I say something funny?

233
00:16:03,244 --> 00:16:06,205
-I'm dying.
-It wasn't that far.

234
00:16:06,205 --> 00:16:08,875
-20 miles.
-That's far.

235
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,920
Hold it.

236
00:16:34,984 --> 00:16:36,486
Stay put, pumpkin.

237
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:47,497
One man on
the couch...reading.

238
00:16:47,497 --> 00:16:49,165
A literate burglar?

239
00:16:49,165 --> 00:16:53,211
How refreshing.
Reading what?

240
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:56,172
Go for the far wall.
I'll cover you from here.

241
00:17:04,347 --> 00:17:07,141
One...

242
00:17:07,141 --> 00:17:10,520
Two...

243
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,563
Three.

244
00:17:14,774 --> 00:17:17,652
Jeff! Jeff!

245
00:17:17,652 --> 00:17:21,364
Frank! How are you doing?

246
00:17:26,202 --> 00:17:28,704
Did we ever thank you
for the crib blanket?

247
00:17:28,704 --> 00:17:31,666
No, honey. The White House
sent the crib blanket.

248
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,918
Frank sent
the Fisher-Price barnyard.

249
00:17:33,918 --> 00:17:35,545
You sent that?

250
00:17:35,545 --> 00:17:38,089
Do you know those
little cows really moo?

251
00:17:38,089 --> 00:17:40,091
Jeff always plays with it
day and night.

252
00:17:40,091 --> 00:17:42,343
I'd like you
to consider something.

253
00:17:42,343 --> 00:17:44,720
-The answer is no.
-You haven't heard the question.

254
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,930
The answer is still no.

255
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:48,391
Whatever you want,
we're not interested.

256
00:17:48,391 --> 00:17:50,143
We're off
the field assignment list.

257
00:17:50,143 --> 00:17:54,230
Maternity leave.
You gave us a very nice party.

258
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:58,901
You said if we were in
a critical situation--

259
00:17:58,901 --> 00:18:00,736
Not during
the first 18 months.

260
00:18:00,736 --> 00:18:05,241
The books all show the first
18 months are essential--

261
00:18:05,241 --> 00:18:07,201
Jesus.

262
00:18:09,203 --> 00:18:11,539
-Tactical nuke?
-C-22.

263
00:18:11,539 --> 00:18:13,958
-We are not interested.
-''C'' what?

264
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,585
Experimental
plastic explosive...

265
00:18:15,585 --> 00:18:17,545
the most powerful plastic
ever developed.

266
00:18:17,545 --> 00:18:20,131
So unstable even the Army
won't use it.

267
00:18:20,131 --> 00:18:21,632
That C-22.

268
00:18:21,632 --> 00:18:22,967
I thought
they stopped making it.

269
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:24,594
They did.
The remaining stock was stolen.

270
00:18:24,594 --> 00:18:28,097
-Sell it to someone else.
-Please.

271
00:18:28,097 --> 00:18:30,141
FBI thinks
it's organized crime.

272
00:18:30,141 --> 00:18:32,143
FBI thinks everything's
organized crime.

273
00:18:32,143 --> 00:18:33,644
We think it's Novacek.

274
00:18:33,644 --> 00:18:36,147
Novacek?
We're incredibly not interested.

275
00:18:36,147 --> 00:18:38,649
She hates me.
Remember Budapest?

276
00:18:38,649 --> 00:18:39,984
You said
you'd help out a little.

277
00:18:39,984 --> 00:18:44,196
Novacek is not a little.
She's a psycho.

278
00:18:44,196 --> 00:18:46,240
Novacek's customers
make their points...

279
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,160
by blowing up innocent people,
including children.

280
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,162
That's a low blow.

281
00:18:51,162 --> 00:18:55,333
Just find her.
We'll do the rest.

282
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,668
You get six months paid leave
when you finish.

283
00:18:57,668 --> 00:18:59,837
That ought to help
the postnatal bonding.

284
00:18:59,837 --> 00:19:02,965
Uh-uh. Just going to have
to find somebody else.

285
00:19:02,965 --> 00:19:06,677
We'll throw in a bonus.
20% of annual pay.

286
00:19:06,677 --> 00:19:08,679
I made a solemn promise
to Jane--

287
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:10,848
-Fifty percent.
-Don't push it.

288
00:19:10,848 --> 00:19:12,099
I'm a mother now.

289
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:14,644
Know what a decent college
will cost in 20 years?

290
00:19:14,644 --> 00:19:16,729
Thirty. I'm already
way over budget.

291
00:19:16,729 --> 00:19:18,314
Fifty, going once.

292
00:19:18,314 --> 00:19:20,024
You mercenary thing, you.

293
00:19:20,024 --> 00:19:21,943
Going twice.

294
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:24,445
I want a low-profile operation.

295
00:19:24,445 --> 00:19:27,949
You want low-profile,
you got low-profile.

296
00:19:27,949 --> 00:19:31,035
-We'll need the usual toys.
-They're on the way.

297
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,954
You got one lead--
this guy Foster.

298
00:19:33,954 --> 00:19:37,500
He works at Dynagon.
They developed C-22.

299
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,087
-Can you say plastic explosive?
-Pay attention.

300
00:19:41,087 --> 00:19:44,507
I'm paying attention.
Go on.

301
00:19:44,507 --> 00:19:47,134
Novacek's base
is somewhere in the delta.

302
00:19:47,134 --> 00:19:50,179
She's got her people spotted
in local defence industries...

303
00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:51,681
even the military.

304
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:53,182
More good news.

305
00:19:53,182 --> 00:19:55,685
Near as we can tell,
she bribed a full colonel...

306
00:19:55,685 --> 00:19:58,229
into stealing the last batch
of C-22 canisters.

307
00:19:58,229 --> 00:20:01,148
He got spooked
and used one getting away.

308
00:20:01,148 --> 00:20:04,735
Blew up half of Oklahoma.
Be careful, guys.

309
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,779
Novacek's more dangerous
than she looks.

310
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:08,531
Colonel!

311
00:20:08,531 --> 00:20:11,450
How happy I am to see you.

312
00:20:15,037 --> 00:20:17,289
You're limping.
Did you have some problems?

313
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:20,751
-Nothing I couldn't handle.
-What happened?

314
00:20:20,751 --> 00:20:23,421
There was a last-minute change
in checkpoint security.

315
00:20:23,421 --> 00:20:26,799
-What?
-There's one missing.

316
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,802
-Missing?
-That's what I'm saying.

317
00:20:29,802 --> 00:20:32,888
They were bringing in
tanks and artillery.

318
00:20:32,888 --> 00:20:35,224
You used
1/5 of our shipment...

319
00:20:35,224 --> 00:20:39,353
just to--Oh, God--
to blast yourself out?

320
00:20:39,353 --> 00:20:43,107
It was the only way out.
I know they're valuable.

321
00:20:43,107 --> 00:20:45,109
Colonel...

322
00:20:45,109 --> 00:20:48,279
Big, strong, colonel man.

323
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:50,823
I know you're the only one
I can trust.

324
00:20:50,823 --> 00:20:53,784
Don't ma'am me.
Just call me Paulina.

325
00:20:53,784 --> 00:20:55,369
Paulina, ma'am.

326
00:20:55,369 --> 00:20:57,955
You just call me--Oops.

327
00:20:57,955 --> 00:21:00,374
-I'll get that.
-Unforgettable.

328
00:21:03,586 --> 00:21:07,089
The colonel will no longer
be working with us.

329
00:21:08,257 --> 00:21:10,259
The FBI fired Blue twice?

330
00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:13,220
Fired him in '81.
Rehired him in '84.

331
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,723
-Fired him again in '85.
-Why?

332
00:21:15,723 --> 00:21:17,224
There's all kinds of rumours.

333
00:21:17,224 --> 00:21:19,310
Tell him what he did
in-between.

334
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:21,228
I'm going to hate this,
ain't I?

335
00:21:21,228 --> 00:21:23,230
-CIA.
-Perfect.

336
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:26,233
Till they got on the bandwagon
and fired him, too.

337
00:21:26,233 --> 00:21:28,736
-Who's he with now?
-Very good question.

338
00:21:28,736 --> 00:21:30,696
-Go find out!
-Yes, sir.

339
00:21:34,742 --> 00:21:36,702
Mr. Foster?

340
00:21:38,329 --> 00:21:41,248
You. What do you want?

341
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:44,752
Frau Novacek shall require
your services again.

342
00:21:44,752 --> 00:21:47,755
No, no. I can't be
involved with that anymore.

343
00:21:47,755 --> 00:21:49,757
I mean...you know.

344
00:21:49,757 --> 00:21:51,842
You got no choice, little man.

345
00:21:51,842 --> 00:21:54,762
Please deliver the merchandise
at the usual place.

346
00:21:54,762 --> 00:21:58,098
Oh, God! When?

347
00:21:58,098 --> 00:22:01,769
''Gilbert Foster,
2616 Magazine Street.

348
00:22:01,769 --> 00:22:05,773
''Occupation--research scientist
at Dynagon Industries.

349
00:22:05,773 --> 00:22:10,444
"Dishonorable discharge.
Marital status--divorced.''

350
00:22:10,444 --> 00:22:11,695
Yoo-hoo, Ms. Blue!

351
00:22:11,695 --> 00:22:13,739
Heads up.

352
00:22:16,158 --> 00:22:17,743
Laurel and Hardy.

353
00:22:19,203 --> 00:22:21,580
Well, the Blues.

354
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:24,416
I got a right
to sing the blues

355
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:26,043
Charming.

356
00:22:26,043 --> 00:22:29,254
Cute baby. Boy or girl?

357
00:22:29,254 --> 00:22:30,547
Gosh, I hope so.

358
00:22:30,547 --> 00:22:32,049
She's a girl, Lieutenant.

359
00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:33,384
I got two girls.

360
00:22:33,384 --> 00:22:36,220
-Really? Two whole girls.
-We tried for a boy.

361
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,722
-Coffee?
-I'd love some cafe au lait.

362
00:22:38,722 --> 00:22:40,224
Great.

363
00:22:40,224 --> 00:22:42,726
Mr. Blue,
could we talk frankly?

364
00:22:42,726 --> 00:22:44,645
Sure, Ted.

365
00:22:44,645 --> 00:22:47,064
What you did
to those two guys--

366
00:22:47,064 --> 00:22:49,358
What did you say you did
for a living?

367
00:22:49,358 --> 00:22:50,859
I'm an airline pilot.

368
00:22:50,859 --> 00:22:52,736
You said you're
a vacuum cleaner salesman.

369
00:22:52,736 --> 00:22:55,656
If you knew, why'd you ask?

370
00:22:58,242 --> 00:23:02,246
What you did to those guys
was on a professional level.

371
00:23:02,246 --> 00:23:04,748
Growing up
in the mean streets--

372
00:23:04,748 --> 00:23:06,792
Mean streets?
You're from Nebraska.

373
00:23:06,792 --> 00:23:08,794
How did you know
where Jeff was from?

374
00:23:08,794 --> 00:23:12,214
Had a little chat with
somebody from the FBI.

375
00:23:12,214 --> 00:23:15,467
The man has unexpected depths.

376
00:23:15,467 --> 00:23:16,885
What else did you find out?

377
00:23:16,885 --> 00:23:18,887
Nothing about our sex life,
I hope.

378
00:23:18,887 --> 00:23:20,222
I'm going to blush.

379
00:23:20,222 --> 00:23:22,224
You weren't blushing last night.

380
00:23:22,224 --> 00:23:23,559
I was blushing all over.

381
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:26,645
-Oh, yeah.
-Everywhere.

382
00:23:26,645 --> 00:23:30,983
My source at the FBI says
they didn't think you were...

383
00:23:30,983 --> 00:23:34,403
and I quote,
''Bureau material.''

384
00:23:34,403 --> 00:23:38,031
That's true.
I'm more of an end table.

385
00:23:38,031 --> 00:23:40,284
I always think of you
as a dining room chair.

386
00:23:40,284 --> 00:23:42,995
Really? I see you as
a rosewood armoire...

387
00:23:42,995 --> 00:23:45,914
with really nice drawers.

388
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:49,918
-Blue!
-What?

389
00:23:49,918 --> 00:23:53,589
Who are you working for?
Are you a spy?

390
00:23:53,589 --> 00:23:57,134
It don't have to go beyond me.

391
00:23:57,134 --> 00:23:59,636
I can help you. Trust me.

392
00:23:59,636 --> 00:24:01,889
-Know what's funny?
-What?

393
00:24:01,889 --> 00:24:04,349
That gray van over there.

394
00:24:04,349 --> 00:24:06,643
Funny ha-ha
or funny interesting?

395
00:24:06,643 --> 00:24:09,104
Have you been listening to me?

396
00:24:09,104 --> 00:24:12,065
It's been there seven minutes
with the motor running.

397
00:24:12,065 --> 00:24:14,902
-So what?
-It's in front of a bank.

398
00:24:14,902 --> 00:24:17,654
I repeat--so what?

399
00:24:17,654 --> 00:24:19,156
Order me another coffee.

400
00:24:20,699 --> 00:24:22,659
He's so rude sometimes.

401
00:24:22,659 --> 00:24:24,578
I'm sorry.
I just have to apologize.

402
00:24:46,183 --> 00:24:47,643
Excuse me.

403
00:24:48,685 --> 00:24:50,854
Honey, you got to see this.

404
00:24:50,854 --> 00:24:52,856
Come see what Daddy's doing.

405
00:24:56,568 --> 00:24:58,570
Let's go! Go, man!

406
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:01,281
Go, God damn it! Go!

407
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,168
Oh, wow!

408
00:25:13,168 --> 00:25:16,171
Next time, buy American.

409
00:25:18,507 --> 00:25:22,928
Mrs. Blue, can we stop
with the fun and games?

410
00:25:22,928 --> 00:25:25,722
First try.

411
00:25:25,722 --> 00:25:28,100
Give me five.

412
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,727
Who is your husband
working for now?

413
00:25:30,727 --> 00:25:33,146
If you'd like to know
who my husband is working for...

414
00:25:33,146 --> 00:25:34,940
I suggest you ask him.

415
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:38,235
I am outraged
that he single-handedly...

416
00:25:38,235 --> 00:25:41,738
foils a bank robbery
and you arrest him.

417
00:25:41,738 --> 00:25:43,740
You got a lot of goddamn gall.

418
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,617
We got your husband
behind bars...

419
00:25:45,617 --> 00:25:47,911
and he'll stay there
until somebody tells me...

420
00:25:47,911 --> 00:25:50,163
exactly what
he's doing in my city!

421
00:25:50,163 --> 00:25:53,125
You are overreacting.
Isn't he, honey?

422
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:54,751
Men are like that.

423
00:25:54,751 --> 00:25:57,254
They get threatened,
then they get defensive...

424
00:25:57,254 --> 00:25:59,256
and then
they get aggressive--

425
00:25:59,256 --> 00:26:01,258
Ma'am, if you don't watch it...

426
00:26:01,258 --> 00:26:05,595
you'll find yourself in a cell,
baby or no baby.

427
00:26:05,595 --> 00:26:07,264
Excuse me, sir.
Phone call for you.

428
00:26:07,264 --> 00:26:09,433
-I'm busy.
-OK.

429
00:26:09,433 --> 00:26:12,144
I'm going to ask you
one more time very nicely--

430
00:26:12,144 --> 00:26:13,937
It's about Blue, sir.

431
00:26:13,937 --> 00:26:16,773
Who is it, the president?

432
00:26:16,773 --> 00:26:18,859
No.

433
00:26:18,859 --> 00:26:20,736
It's the governor.

434
00:26:22,487 --> 00:26:26,324
About that stunt you pulled
with the car just now...

435
00:26:26,324 --> 00:26:28,702
is that part
of Chapter Two...

436
00:26:28,702 --> 00:26:31,705
in which Jeff and Jane
lead a sane life?

437
00:26:31,705 --> 00:26:33,707
I don't think
it's fair or nice of you...

438
00:26:33,707 --> 00:26:35,709
to complain about me
having a little fun.

439
00:26:35,709 --> 00:26:37,085
There was a zero risk factor.

440
00:26:37,085 --> 00:26:38,795
Three guys
running out of a bank...

441
00:26:38,795 --> 00:26:40,422
packing heat,
probably stoned.

442
00:26:40,422 --> 00:26:42,716
People in a hurry
never look at the driver.

443
00:26:42,716 --> 00:26:44,301
I've never
heard that rule before.

444
00:26:44,301 --> 00:26:47,220
I made it up,
but it's still true.

445
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,389
And it's all part of
my brilliant plan.

446
00:26:49,389 --> 00:26:50,724
Which brilliant plan?

447
00:26:50,724 --> 00:26:52,225
Take a look at this.

448
00:26:52,225 --> 00:26:54,227
This guy at Dynagon,
Foster...

449
00:26:54,227 --> 00:26:56,605
he's worth spooking,
so tomorrow, what we do...

450
00:27:04,237 --> 00:27:07,240
Would you get that?
My hands are all gooey.

451
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,576
Yeah.

452
00:27:09,576 --> 00:27:13,288
-Hello. Speaking.
-This Blue?

453
00:27:13,288 --> 00:27:15,957
Do you remember me?

454
00:27:15,957 --> 00:27:18,210
You have a really sexy voice...

455
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:20,212
but, hey,
I'm a happily married man.

456
00:27:20,212 --> 00:27:22,714
You'll be a dead man soon.

457
00:27:22,714 --> 00:27:25,634
Who is this again?

458
00:27:25,634 --> 00:27:28,094
This is Muerte.

459
00:27:28,094 --> 00:27:29,513
Morty!

460
00:27:29,513 --> 00:27:32,891
No! No Morty!
Muerte! Death!

461
00:27:32,891 --> 00:27:35,519
Yeah, right. Death.

462
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:38,230
That's right.
I'm coming for you, man...

463
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:40,982
and I'm going to kill you.

464
00:27:40,982 --> 00:27:44,486
Morty, it's late.
What's the bottom line?

465
00:27:44,486 --> 00:27:48,949
The bottom line is
you're gonna die, man...ugly.

466
00:27:48,949 --> 00:27:54,204
Morty, do me a favour.
Don't call here anymore...

467
00:27:54,204 --> 00:27:57,707
unless you want to have
a serious conversation.

468
00:27:57,707 --> 00:28:00,585
Excuse me! No! Hello?

469
00:28:00,585 --> 00:28:02,587
-Who was that?
-That was Morty.

470
00:28:02,587 --> 00:28:04,339
Muerte. How nice.

471
00:28:04,339 --> 00:28:07,092
-He'll be very useful.
-Boy, are you optimistic.

472
00:28:38,248 --> 00:28:40,458
Dynagon Industries.

473
00:28:44,671 --> 00:28:46,673
You wanted to see me?

474
00:28:46,673 --> 00:28:50,844
Yes, Mr. Foster.
My name is Hildy Johnson.

475
00:28:50,844 --> 00:28:52,178
I'm with
the ''Chicago Herald.''

476
00:28:52,178 --> 00:28:55,557
I'm working on a story about
the theft of defence secrets.

477
00:28:55,557 --> 00:29:01,521
I have absolutely no comment
to make on this matter.

478
00:29:01,521 --> 00:29:05,442
Really? How about
a big front-page photo?

479
00:29:05,442 --> 00:29:06,651
Oh, God!

480
00:29:06,651 --> 00:29:10,405
I think you should leave,
sir, right now.

481
00:29:15,869 --> 00:29:18,747
Run back the tape
from reception.

482
00:29:27,297 --> 00:29:28,757
Stop it right there.

483
00:29:31,509 --> 00:29:33,595
Print.

484
00:29:45,148 --> 00:29:47,233
Mr. Ferderber, please.

485
00:29:47,233 --> 00:29:49,235
Yes, I'll wait.

486
00:29:49,235 --> 00:29:51,738
Yeah, right. Yes.

487
00:29:52,739 --> 00:29:54,115
Oh, God.

488
00:31:04,894 --> 00:31:07,605
-Jefferson Blue.
-You know him?

489
00:31:07,605 --> 00:31:12,777
Yes. He ruined
the operation in Budapest.

490
00:31:12,777 --> 00:31:15,780
This means everything will
have to be accelerated.

491
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:19,284
You must make copies of this
and distribute them.

492
00:31:19,284 --> 00:31:20,785
We must get Blue.

493
00:31:20,785 --> 00:31:22,787
Yes, Frau Novacek.

494
00:31:22,787 --> 00:31:25,290
Yeah. Thank you.

495
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:28,126
Thank you very much.
Here you go, honey.

496
00:31:28,126 --> 00:31:33,464
I told you B.B. King
recorded children's records.

497
00:31:33,464 --> 00:31:36,718
There you go.
Let's go find Mommy.

498
00:31:36,718 --> 00:31:39,137
Maybe she'll give us
something to eat.

499
00:31:39,137 --> 00:31:42,807
Hi, Morty. How's it going?

500
00:31:42,807 --> 00:31:45,810
Muerte! For Death!

501
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:47,437
You die today!

502
00:31:47,437 --> 00:31:53,109
Right. That looks
really great on TV...

503
00:31:53,109 --> 00:31:56,612
but you get better results
if you hold it like--

504
00:31:56,612 --> 00:31:58,364
Shut up!

505
00:31:58,364 --> 00:31:59,824
Do you always have
this much problem...

506
00:31:59,824 --> 00:32:02,493
with a little
constructive criticism?

507
00:32:06,122 --> 00:32:07,999
Now what?

508
00:32:07,999 --> 00:32:10,835
Hi, hon.
I told you about Morty.

509
00:32:10,835 --> 00:32:14,756
-Morty, this is Jane.
-Hi, Morty.

510
00:32:14,756 --> 00:32:17,258
I'm sorry, but we've got
so much shopping to do--

511
00:32:17,258 --> 00:32:20,011
Shut up! You die, too!

512
00:32:20,011 --> 00:32:21,345
Oh, for God's sakes.

513
00:32:29,771 --> 00:32:31,355
Oh, no.

514
00:32:33,775 --> 00:32:35,234
Honey.

515
00:32:35,234 --> 00:32:37,570
Come here, Morty.

516
00:32:40,281 --> 00:32:42,825
I can't leave you alone
for a minute.

517
00:32:42,825 --> 00:32:44,660
This wasn't my fault.

518
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,162
Nothing's ever your fault.

519
00:32:46,162 --> 00:32:48,289
You going to kill him?

520
00:32:48,289 --> 00:32:50,291
Aren't we bloodthirsty?

521
00:32:50,291 --> 00:32:53,753
I told you not to drink
all that coffee.

522
00:32:56,881 --> 00:32:58,382
Where are we going to eat?

523
00:32:58,382 --> 00:33:00,134
I heard about this great place
from the Newmans.

524
00:33:00,134 --> 00:33:02,220
They say
the oysters are terrific.

525
00:33:03,304 --> 00:33:05,306
Here we go.

526
00:33:05,306 --> 00:33:07,809
You want to sit here
or in the garden?

527
00:33:07,809 --> 00:33:09,310
-Garden?
-Sure.

528
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,812
That way, please.

529
00:33:10,812 --> 00:33:12,772
Do you think
we'll find Novacek?

530
00:33:12,772 --> 00:33:14,774
Absolutely.
We spooked Foster.

531
00:33:14,774 --> 00:33:16,776
Word gets to Novacek.
Novacek gets worried.

532
00:33:16,776 --> 00:33:18,778
She doesn't know
what move to make.

533
00:33:18,778 --> 00:33:20,780
She's fretful.
She's nervous.

534
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:23,115
You're describing
a baby with colic.

535
00:33:27,787 --> 00:33:31,290
All right.
What can I get for you folks?

536
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:34,293
A new acquaintance told me
this was the place for oysters.

537
00:33:34,293 --> 00:33:36,295
Yes, ma'am, it is.

538
00:33:36,295 --> 00:33:39,966
We'll have six dozen oysters
and two beers.

539
00:33:39,966 --> 00:33:41,968
All right, sir. Right away.

540
00:33:41,968 --> 00:33:43,469
You like them, too?

541
00:33:43,469 --> 00:33:44,846
This place is great.

542
00:33:51,227 --> 00:33:54,272
Darling, do the oysters
come with guns?

543
00:33:55,398 --> 00:33:58,067
Don't make any sudden moves.

544
00:33:58,067 --> 00:34:01,320
-Is there a bee on me?
-l don't see one.

545
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,574
What's a sudden move?
I never understood that.

546
00:34:04,574 --> 00:34:07,702
I don't either.
They watch too many cop shows.

547
00:34:07,702 --> 00:34:12,748
Get up from the table
very, very slowly.

548
00:34:12,748 --> 00:34:16,294
Very, very? Not just very?

549
00:34:16,294 --> 00:34:17,878
Start moving.

550
00:34:17,878 --> 00:34:20,881
You remember Marseilles
three, four years ago?

551
00:34:20,881 --> 00:34:22,091
Uh-huh.

552
00:34:22,091 --> 00:34:23,968
Don't try anything stupid.

553
00:34:23,968 --> 00:34:27,263
-Sure you remember?
-l think so.

554
00:34:27,263 --> 00:34:29,307
All right.
On the count of three--

555
00:34:29,307 --> 00:34:32,351
-One...two...three.
-Don't!

556
00:34:35,271 --> 00:34:38,357
All right.

557
00:34:38,357 --> 00:34:40,276
The comedy's over.

558
00:34:52,788 --> 00:34:54,790
After them, you fools!

559
00:35:01,464 --> 00:35:03,090
Why didn't you shoot him
under the table?

560
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:05,134
You said Marseilles.
That was East Berlin.

561
00:35:05,134 --> 00:35:07,136
Oops.

562
00:35:24,779 --> 00:35:27,281
They just closed for lunch.

563
00:35:27,281 --> 00:35:30,284
Anything you care to tell me?

564
00:35:30,284 --> 00:35:32,661
The oysters look terrific.

565
00:35:32,661 --> 00:35:34,789
I mean about
what just happened here.

566
00:35:34,789 --> 00:35:37,792
I'd say it was
a domestic disturbance.

567
00:35:37,792 --> 00:35:40,795
-Domestic disturbance?
-Like ''The Honeymooners.''

568
00:35:40,795 --> 00:35:43,297
Remember how
Ralph fought with Alice?

569
00:35:43,297 --> 00:35:46,300
I don't recollect Ralph
using semiautomatic weapons.

570
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,802
Norton sometimes did.

571
00:35:47,802 --> 00:35:49,303
And Mrs. Manicotti
on the second floor.

572
00:35:49,303 --> 00:35:50,805
Wow, what a temper she had.

573
00:35:50,805 --> 00:35:52,765
You got a gun?
Give it to me.

574
00:35:52,765 --> 00:35:54,266
I don't carry a gun.

575
00:35:54,266 --> 00:35:56,310
Jeff's a lousy shot.

576
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:58,354
He bribed the examiner
at the FBI.

577
00:35:58,354 --> 00:36:00,815
That's a lie.
I bribed the guy at the CIA.

578
00:36:00,815 --> 00:36:03,317
I blackmailed
the guy at the FBI.

579
00:36:03,317 --> 00:36:04,735
You think you're smarter
than we are.

580
00:36:04,735 --> 00:36:09,490
Not much.
I just have more training.

581
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:13,119
I thought you were
a vacuum cleaner salesman.

582
00:36:23,587 --> 00:36:26,173
What's he doing,
joining the band?

583
00:36:29,593 --> 00:36:32,263
-That's your husband.
-l know.

584
00:36:32,263 --> 00:36:35,140
-Does he play the trumpet?
-Apparently.

585
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:41,772
I hate him.

586
00:36:41,772 --> 00:36:43,983
I really hate him.

587
00:36:54,952 --> 00:36:58,289
-Is she asleep?
-Like an angel.

588
00:36:58,289 --> 00:37:02,251
I will be having hideous
nightmares about shoot-outs.

589
00:37:02,251 --> 00:37:04,795
Don't blame me.
You picked the restaurant.

590
00:37:04,795 --> 00:37:07,298
Here's what I think.
Tomorrow morning...

591
00:37:07,298 --> 00:37:09,300
you and the pumpkin
get on a plane...

592
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,760
and I'll call you
when it's over.

593
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,262
Please.

594
00:37:13,262 --> 00:37:15,264
Isn't that what you want?

595
00:37:15,264 --> 00:37:19,268
We are a team.
End of story.

596
00:37:19,268 --> 00:37:23,772
God knows what would happen
to you if I wasn't around.

597
00:37:28,777 --> 00:37:30,279
I might get hurt.

598
00:37:30,279 --> 00:37:32,281
Or worse than that.

599
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:40,581
Don't start.
I have to make a phone call.

600
00:37:42,541 --> 00:37:46,295
Who do you want to be,
good cop or bad cop?

601
00:37:46,295 --> 00:37:49,632
Bad cop.
Who are you calling?

602
00:37:49,632 --> 00:37:51,800
I never get to be the bad cop.

603
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,136
You can never keep
a straight face.

604
00:37:54,136 --> 00:37:55,554
Who are you calling?

605
00:38:03,395 --> 00:38:06,315
-Yes?
-Mr. Foster?

606
00:38:06,315 --> 00:38:08,108
Who is this?

607
00:38:08,108 --> 00:38:10,319
Our organization
has been penetrated...

608
00:38:10,319 --> 00:38:15,574
by a brilliant American agent
and his beautiful wife.

609
00:38:15,574 --> 00:38:17,242
Meet me--

610
00:38:17,242 --> 00:38:19,953
At the cemetery
where we always meet.

611
00:38:19,953 --> 00:38:21,455
But of course.

612
00:38:21,455 --> 00:38:24,458
2:00 tomorrow afternoon.
Do not be late.

613
00:38:24,458 --> 00:38:27,252
So, tomorrow
we gang up on Mr. Foster.

614
00:38:27,252 --> 00:38:29,254
Do you think he'll come?

615
00:38:29,254 --> 00:38:32,758
Absolutely. If he doesn't,
we still get some sightseeing.

616
00:38:32,758 --> 00:38:36,303
So you were saying
if you weren't around...

617
00:38:36,303 --> 00:38:38,722
You might get hurt.

618
00:38:39,765 --> 00:38:41,809
Badly hurt.

619
00:38:41,809 --> 00:38:43,811
Maimed, maybe.

620
00:38:43,811 --> 00:38:45,771
Maybe...

621
00:38:45,771 --> 00:38:47,815
Maybe worse.

622
00:38:47,815 --> 00:38:51,819
Decapitated...lose my head.

623
00:38:51,819 --> 00:38:54,822
I know what decapitated means.

624
00:38:54,822 --> 00:38:56,281
Kill the light.

625
00:38:59,701 --> 00:39:01,787
I meant turn it off.

626
00:39:06,792 --> 00:39:09,503
-Honey.
-Look who's here.

627
00:39:09,503 --> 00:39:11,839
Ding, ding, ding,
went the trolley

628
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:14,633
-Clang, sir.
-What?

629
00:39:14,633 --> 00:39:19,346
Clang went the trolley,
ding went the bell.

630
00:39:19,346 --> 00:39:21,974
So, you've been assigned
to follow us.

631
00:39:21,974 --> 00:39:23,392
Who says we're following you?

632
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:26,019
I get it.
You have a day off...

633
00:39:26,019 --> 00:39:27,604
and you're
spending it together.

634
00:39:27,604 --> 00:39:29,314
No. Here's what
you're doing--

635
00:39:29,314 --> 00:39:31,150
pissing away
the taxpayers' money.

636
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:33,152
That's what we're paid for.

637
00:39:33,152 --> 00:39:36,947
And following around
CIA agents in New Orleans.

638
00:39:36,947 --> 00:39:39,324
Will you get off that already?

639
00:39:39,324 --> 00:39:41,034
I say you're CIA.

640
00:39:41,034 --> 00:39:43,787
Good. Say it.

641
00:40:01,221 --> 00:40:03,307
Tell me,
what are you doing here?

642
00:40:03,307 --> 00:40:05,309
This is a cemetery.

643
00:40:05,309 --> 00:40:07,477
Are you here
on company business?

644
00:40:07,477 --> 00:40:09,813
Lieutenant, will you
get off this CIA kick?

645
00:40:09,813 --> 00:40:12,816
I'm a regular guy,
almost a regular guy.

646
00:40:12,816 --> 00:40:14,818
I got a wife, a baby.

647
00:40:14,818 --> 00:40:17,321
Enjoy yourself
and watch the funeral.

648
00:40:17,321 --> 00:40:19,072
I've seen plenty of funerals.

649
00:40:19,072 --> 00:40:21,533
I'm here to keep an eye on you.

650
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:26,997
Lord have mercy.

651
00:40:28,624 --> 00:40:30,334
Jesus Christ!

652
00:40:30,334 --> 00:40:32,169
I guess he got here early.

653
00:40:57,861 --> 00:40:59,821
Hi. How are you?

654
00:40:59,821 --> 00:41:02,866
How was my Jonathan?
Was he any trouble?

655
00:41:02,866 --> 00:41:04,660
Oh, no. He's a good baby.

656
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,536
Did you enjoy the jazz cruise?

657
00:41:06,536 --> 00:41:09,706
We missed the boat.

658
00:41:09,706 --> 00:41:11,792
Too bad.
When we did that--

659
00:41:11,792 --> 00:41:14,086
When was it, Vern?
Two years ago.

660
00:41:14,086 --> 00:41:17,089
-Three years ago.
-No, honey, it was not.

661
00:41:17,089 --> 00:41:18,882
It was right after
my haemorrhoid surgery.

662
00:41:18,882 --> 00:41:20,258
You told me about that.

663
00:41:20,258 --> 00:41:22,344
He doesn't want to hear
about your haemorrhoids.

664
00:41:22,344 --> 00:41:24,680
Come to Daddy!

665
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,181
Thank you so much.

666
00:41:26,181 --> 00:41:28,850
If you ever want us
to watch Louise Jane...

667
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:30,310
just let us know.

668
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:31,520
Jane Louise, honey.

669
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,022
No, Louise Jane.
We'd be more than happy.

670
00:41:34,022 --> 00:41:36,400
Thank you.
We'll take you up on that.

671
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,860
Good night. Sleep tight.

672
00:41:41,738 --> 00:41:45,033
-You tired?
-Very.

673
00:41:45,033 --> 00:41:46,660
Oh, really?

674
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:49,871
That's just too bad, honey.

675
00:41:49,871 --> 00:41:51,873
Because you know why?

676
00:41:51,873 --> 00:41:56,878
Because I had
some real fun in mind.

677
00:41:56,878 --> 00:41:59,840
Like what, for instance?

678
00:42:07,889 --> 00:42:11,393
Breaking and entering
into the house of a dead man...

679
00:42:11,393 --> 00:42:14,604
is not my idea
of a lot of fun.

680
00:42:14,604 --> 00:42:18,316
It would be if you didn't take
all night to open the door.

681
00:42:18,316 --> 00:42:20,152
Madam needs to be changed.

682
00:42:20,152 --> 00:42:23,530
Change her yourself.
This is a five-pin Chubb.

683
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:25,574
See Mommy picking the big lock?

684
00:42:25,574 --> 00:42:29,327
When you're a big girl,
she'll teach you to pick locks.

685
00:42:29,327 --> 00:42:32,247
Of course, she still
may be picking this one.

686
00:42:32,247 --> 00:42:34,833
One minute even.
Pretty slick.

687
00:42:34,833 --> 00:42:36,918
Thank you.

688
00:42:38,211 --> 00:42:40,714
OK...

689
00:42:40,714 --> 00:42:44,968
We can assume the cops tossed
the place pretty thoroughly.

690
00:42:44,968 --> 00:42:47,846
At least
all the obvious places.

691
00:42:47,846 --> 00:42:50,849
So we'll start with
the refrigerator.

692
00:42:50,849 --> 00:42:53,351
That's funny.

693
00:42:53,351 --> 00:42:55,353
-What?
-A shoe.

694
00:42:55,353 --> 00:42:58,857
-And?
-It's got a foot in it.

695
00:43:00,317 --> 00:43:01,860
Evening.

696
00:43:03,361 --> 00:43:05,947
All right.

697
00:43:05,947 --> 00:43:07,782
You going to tell us
the whole story?

698
00:43:07,782 --> 00:43:09,159
We can tell you
part of the story.

699
00:43:09,159 --> 00:43:11,870
-Tell me all of it.
-Part or nothing.

700
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:14,581
How about we bust your ass
for B-and-E?

701
00:43:14,581 --> 00:43:17,125
How about we talk to
your nice governor?

702
00:43:17,125 --> 00:43:21,171
All right.
Tell me part of the story.

703
00:43:21,171 --> 00:43:24,299
It's hard to know
where to begin.

704
00:43:24,299 --> 00:43:26,426
My parents were
really simple folks.

705
00:43:26,426 --> 00:43:28,386
My father was a steam fitter.

706
00:43:28,386 --> 00:43:29,804
The relevant part.

707
00:43:29,804 --> 00:43:33,892
What do you know about recent
Czechoslovakian politics?

708
00:43:33,892 --> 00:43:37,395
No more Commie threat
and a bloodless revolution.

709
00:43:37,395 --> 00:43:40,565
-Very good.
-l saw it on PBS.

710
00:43:40,565 --> 00:43:42,901
File.

711
00:43:42,901 --> 00:43:44,402
Who is this?

712
00:43:44,402 --> 00:43:46,404
Paulina Novacek,
head of the Czech secret police.

713
00:43:46,404 --> 00:43:48,657
She left Prague two jumps
ahead of the firing squad.

714
00:43:48,657 --> 00:43:51,409
-She's in New Orleans?
-We think so.

715
00:43:51,409 --> 00:43:53,328
She's got men planted
in labs and factories...

716
00:43:53,328 --> 00:43:55,747
all over the south.
Industrial theft.

717
00:43:55,747 --> 00:43:57,374
Steals weapons,
chemicals, sells them.

718
00:43:57,374 --> 00:44:00,669
So you got to find her
and send her back?

719
00:44:00,669 --> 00:44:03,129
-There's no extradition.
-Has to go voluntarily.

720
00:44:03,129 --> 00:44:06,466
And you think
Foster worked for Novacek.

721
00:44:06,466 --> 00:44:08,968
He was the middleman
that funnelled stuff to her...

722
00:44:08,968 --> 00:44:11,096
and through him
we'll find the big guys.

723
00:44:11,096 --> 00:44:14,140
So we have
to find the middleman.

724
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:17,143
There you go, Janie.
Don't squirt Daddy.

725
00:44:17,143 --> 00:44:18,436
Honey?

726
00:44:18,436 --> 00:44:21,314
Come here.

727
00:44:21,314 --> 00:44:22,816
I think I got it.

728
00:44:22,816 --> 00:44:26,486
-Come here, baby.
-Gentlemen.

729
00:44:26,486 --> 00:44:28,238
Will you give me a hand,
Lieutenant?

730
00:44:28,238 --> 00:44:30,824
Pick it up. Easy, easy.

731
00:44:30,824 --> 00:44:33,910
-Holy mackerel!
-Look at that.

732
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:36,663
-Look at that.
-Careful.

733
00:44:36,663 --> 00:44:38,331
Allow me.

734
00:44:44,337 --> 00:44:46,840
Damn. Nothing but money.

735
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,341
What's wrong with money?

736
00:44:48,341 --> 00:44:50,260
We were hoping for a name.

737
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:51,511
Allow me.

738
00:44:51,511 --> 00:44:54,347
Come on, baby.
We'll put you to bed.

739
00:44:54,347 --> 00:44:55,932
Thank you.

740
00:44:55,932 --> 00:44:58,226
-That's interesting.
-What?

741
00:44:58,226 --> 00:45:02,147
There's a Rampart Savings
and Loan with an ATM.

742
00:45:02,147 --> 00:45:06,860
Why would Foster go across town
to use another branch?

743
00:45:10,864 --> 00:45:12,323
That is interesting.

744
00:45:14,325 --> 00:45:15,702
Come on.

745
00:45:16,703 --> 00:45:18,705
Weight on the left leg.

746
00:45:18,705 --> 00:45:21,332
Swing the right leg
from the hip.

747
00:45:21,332 --> 00:45:24,335
Come on. That's good.

748
00:45:24,335 --> 00:45:27,589
There we go.
Good. Oh, well.

749
00:45:27,589 --> 00:45:30,842
-When I was her age--
-She is right on schedule.

750
00:45:30,842 --> 00:45:32,844
I was walking at eight months.

751
00:45:32,844 --> 00:45:34,846
You walked
at a year and a half.

752
00:45:34,846 --> 00:45:36,639
Your mother was ready
to call in specialists.

753
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,891
Take this.

754
00:45:37,891 --> 00:45:41,853
You think Sawyer can handle
this thing at the bank?

755
00:45:41,853 --> 00:45:44,355
Sure. He's OK.
He really is.

756
00:45:44,355 --> 00:45:45,857
Ready?

757
00:45:45,857 --> 00:45:48,193
This is
an incredible alligator.

758
00:45:50,778 --> 00:45:52,030
Ready?

759
00:45:53,865 --> 00:45:55,867
Let's try it.

760
00:45:57,368 --> 00:46:01,789
I figure the range is about
15 miles, plus or minus one.

761
00:46:01,789 --> 00:46:03,249
Think that'll do it?

762
00:46:03,249 --> 00:46:06,252
-Should be fine.
-It better be.

763
00:46:06,252 --> 00:46:07,921
That's a beautiful alligator.

764
00:46:07,921 --> 00:46:11,633
Look at that alligator go.

765
00:46:13,092 --> 00:46:15,511
I really appreciate this help,
Lieutenant.

766
00:46:15,511 --> 00:46:18,306
It's easy.
March right up to him...

767
00:46:18,306 --> 00:46:20,308
and start talking
as loud as possible.

768
00:46:20,308 --> 00:46:23,311
-Loud?
-Loud and obnoxious.

769
00:46:23,311 --> 00:46:27,232
Just act natural.

770
00:46:27,232 --> 00:46:29,317
You got to laugh
at yourself more, sir.

771
00:46:29,317 --> 00:46:31,778
-Let me help you out.
-Stop it!

772
00:46:33,279 --> 00:46:34,781
Cut it out.

773
00:46:34,781 --> 00:46:36,783
Loud.

774
00:46:36,783 --> 00:46:39,786
Loud and proud, sir.
Just you wait.

775
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:44,332
I'd like some assistance,
please!

776
00:46:44,332 --> 00:46:45,875
We're police officers!

777
00:46:45,875 --> 00:46:48,294
Is there anyone in here
that can help me?

778
00:46:48,294 --> 00:46:49,504
Now!

779
00:46:49,504 --> 00:46:52,840
Hear what I just said?
I need some information!

780
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:55,218
Who's in charge of
the automatic teller machine?

781
00:46:55,218 --> 00:46:57,387
I want to talk to them now!

782
00:46:57,387 --> 00:46:59,722
Excuse me.
Is there a problem?

783
00:46:59,722 --> 00:47:01,641
Can I help you in some way?

784
00:47:01,641 --> 00:47:06,104
Mr. Ferderber?
New Orleans Police Department.

785
00:47:06,104 --> 00:47:08,356
How many times
do I have to say this?

786
00:47:08,356 --> 00:47:09,857
How many times?

787
00:47:09,857 --> 00:47:14,028
Who's in charge of
the automatic teller machine?

788
00:47:14,028 --> 00:47:16,406
Must be hard of hearing.

789
00:47:16,406 --> 00:47:17,907
That's all right.
I understand.

790
00:47:17,907 --> 00:47:20,702
I can help you.
Would you come with me?

791
00:47:20,702 --> 00:47:22,745
Just have a seat
in my office here.

792
00:47:22,745 --> 00:47:25,331
I'll make sure someone
assists you immediately.

793
00:47:25,331 --> 00:47:26,916
-Thanks.
-All right?

794
00:47:26,916 --> 00:47:28,334
Better be quick, too.

795
00:47:29,502 --> 00:47:31,212
Hi, hon.
What's happening?

796
00:47:31,212 --> 00:47:34,465
I just got Louise down
for her nap.

797
00:47:34,465 --> 00:47:35,842
Scare up a white lab coat.

798
00:47:35,842 --> 00:47:40,012
Does it have to be white?
I feel very pale today.

799
00:47:40,012 --> 00:47:43,349
Just make it fast.
Got to go.

800
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:45,852
FBI! You're under arrest!

801
00:47:45,852 --> 00:47:47,353
You have the right
to remain silent.

802
00:47:47,353 --> 00:47:48,855
If you give up that right...

803
00:47:48,855 --> 00:47:51,399
you may talk, sing, dance,
or impersonate Elvis.

804
00:47:51,399 --> 00:47:52,900
You also have
the right to an attorney.

805
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,819
If you're broke and can't afford
an attorney, tough shit!

806
00:47:54,819 --> 00:47:56,571
Get in the car,
you suspected felon!

807
00:47:56,571 --> 00:47:57,947
What am I being charged with?

808
00:47:57,947 --> 00:48:00,366
That's for me to know
and you to find out.

809
00:48:13,796 --> 00:48:15,590
Who's she?

810
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:18,050
Allow me to introduce
Dr. Natasha Lottelenya...

811
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:20,803
of the Rosa Klebb
Institute, Leningrad.

812
00:48:20,803 --> 00:48:23,848
Hello. This lunatic
has kidnapped me.

813
00:48:23,848 --> 00:48:27,185
I'm afraid Dr. Lottelenya
doesn't speak any English...

814
00:48:27,185 --> 00:48:29,770
but I'll be happy
to translate.

815
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:31,898
What is that?

816
00:48:31,898 --> 00:48:33,858
What is that thing?
What is she doing?

817
00:48:33,858 --> 00:48:36,861
Dr. Lottelenya is one of
the world's leading experts...

818
00:48:36,861 --> 00:48:40,239
on the prevention
and control of extreme pain.

819
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:43,284
Interestingly enough,
she's also an authority...

820
00:48:43,284 --> 00:48:45,328
on the causation
of extreme pain.

821
00:48:56,881 --> 00:48:58,382
What are you saying?

822
00:48:58,382 --> 00:49:00,760
Is she going to do something?

823
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,261
That depends on you...

824
00:49:02,261 --> 00:49:04,555
on how much
you're willing to tell us.

825
00:49:04,555 --> 00:49:07,391
Oh, God.
I can't tell you anything.

826
00:49:07,391 --> 00:49:10,895
Honest, honest.
I don't know anything.

827
00:49:10,895 --> 00:49:12,313
I understand...

828
00:49:12,313 --> 00:49:16,317
and believe me,
I respect that.

829
00:49:24,992 --> 00:49:27,411
What needles?

830
00:49:27,411 --> 00:49:29,330
This is state of the art.

831
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:33,542
In the old days, we used
Zippo lighters and rats...

832
00:49:33,542 --> 00:49:35,336
but this...

833
00:49:35,336 --> 00:49:39,340
this is called Jane's Probe.

834
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:44,804
Now, when introduced
past the left eyeball...

835
00:49:44,804 --> 00:49:48,349
you can insert it right into
the pain centre of the brain.

836
00:49:48,349 --> 00:49:50,309
Then a little electric current--

837
00:49:51,852 --> 00:49:53,854
God, what is that? Don't!

838
00:49:53,854 --> 00:49:55,356
It's not necessary!

839
00:50:05,658 --> 00:50:07,159
Who's that?

840
00:50:07,159 --> 00:50:09,495
That's Professor Lancaster.

841
00:50:09,495 --> 00:50:12,707
He was really a tough one
when he came in here.

842
00:50:14,375 --> 00:50:15,876
Now listen to him.

843
00:50:15,876 --> 00:50:19,171
If I say anything,
how do I know you'll let me go?

844
00:50:30,266 --> 00:50:32,184
You just have to trust us.

845
00:50:42,486 --> 00:50:44,655
Tell me who you report to.

846
00:50:44,655 --> 00:50:46,365
A woman.

847
00:50:46,365 --> 00:50:48,117
A very tall woman.
I only saw her once.

848
00:50:48,117 --> 00:50:50,119
Where do I find her?

849
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:51,912
Honest to God,
I don't know.

850
00:50:51,912 --> 00:50:54,623
Dr. Lottelenya.

851
00:50:55,624 --> 00:50:58,919
Wait.
I don't know where she is...

852
00:50:58,919 --> 00:51:00,921
but I do know
her telephone number.

853
00:51:00,921 --> 00:51:04,300
There's a piece of paper
in my shirt pocket.

854
00:51:15,394 --> 00:51:19,106
Mr. Ferderber,
I would advise you to disappear.

855
00:51:19,106 --> 00:51:22,276
Vanish. Change your name,
your job...

856
00:51:22,276 --> 00:51:25,821
and if possible, your face.

857
00:51:25,821 --> 00:51:28,282
-Who's that?
-Open up in there!

858
00:51:28,282 --> 00:51:30,284
-Come on.
-Open up!

859
00:51:30,284 --> 00:51:34,038
-Come this way.
-My name...

860
00:51:36,665 --> 00:51:39,960
Where is my goddamn car?

861
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,462
Hey, Ted.

862
00:51:41,462 --> 00:51:46,091
We were getting ready
to take the kid to the zoo.

863
00:51:47,092 --> 00:51:48,594
Look at him.

864
00:51:48,594 --> 00:51:51,597
"It is believed
that as recently as 1979...

865
00:51:51,597 --> 00:51:53,974
''eight subspecies of tigers
were living.

866
00:51:53,974 --> 00:51:55,476
''Today only five remain.''

867
00:51:55,476 --> 00:51:57,978
-Oh, no.
-How about that?

868
00:51:57,978 --> 00:51:59,480
Right. Isn't he gorgeous?

869
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,982
There he is.
Don't worry, baby.

870
00:52:01,982 --> 00:52:04,151
Mommy and Daddy will save him.

871
00:52:04,151 --> 00:52:06,070
Yes, we will.
We'll see to it.

872
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:09,323
There'll be lots of tigers
when you grow up.

873
00:52:10,741 --> 00:52:13,160
Let's check out the elephants.

874
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,079
Here we go.

875
00:52:20,626 --> 00:52:23,003
This is like a parade.

876
00:52:24,838 --> 00:52:26,924
You have to talk to
our little friend.

877
00:52:26,924 --> 00:52:28,509
Which one?

878
00:52:28,509 --> 00:52:31,887
The big ''M.''
I'll take care of him.

879
00:52:31,887 --> 00:52:33,180
Do it fast. I'm hungry.

880
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:37,893
If you're in a hurry,
why don't we create a diversion?

881
00:52:37,893 --> 00:52:39,895
Like what, for instance?

882
00:52:39,895 --> 00:52:42,314
Remember what worked in Toronto?

883
00:52:42,314 --> 00:52:43,899
No. Please. Not that.

884
00:52:43,899 --> 00:52:46,318
Help!
My wife is having a fit!

885
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:47,903
Jeff, don't do this to me!

886
00:52:47,903 --> 00:52:50,781
-Help!
-l really hate you.

887
00:52:50,781 --> 00:52:55,286
Come on. Help!

888
00:52:55,286 --> 00:52:59,290
Oh, God! Don't let her
swallow her tongue!

889
00:53:02,918 --> 00:53:05,546
Police! Police!

890
00:53:05,546 --> 00:53:08,048
Stand back.
We trained for this.

891
00:53:08,048 --> 00:53:10,384
Somebody hold my popcorn.

892
00:53:17,266 --> 00:53:21,186
And they say,
ain't you glad you're single?

893
00:53:21,186 --> 00:53:22,396
Hey, honey,
there's the alligators.

894
00:53:22,396 --> 00:53:25,899
Look at that. Wow!

895
00:53:25,899 --> 00:53:29,403
Look at those alligators.

896
00:53:32,281 --> 00:53:34,074
See them?

897
00:53:37,161 --> 00:53:39,955
They look mean, don't they?

898
00:53:54,553 --> 00:53:56,722
Morty!
How's it going, champ?

899
00:53:56,722 --> 00:53:59,308
Blue! No!
It's an alligator pit!

900
00:53:59,308 --> 00:54:00,934
Get me out of here!

901
00:54:00,934 --> 00:54:03,437
Relax.
They've been fed already.

902
00:54:03,437 --> 00:54:05,355
Stay! Stay back!

903
00:54:05,355 --> 00:54:08,859
It says here that
these are American alligators.

904
00:54:08,859 --> 00:54:12,237
Know how you can tell?
This is fascinating.

905
00:54:12,237 --> 00:54:16,366
They have a broader snout and
you can't see the fourth tooth.

906
00:54:16,366 --> 00:54:18,869
Don't leave!
Get me out of here!

907
00:54:18,869 --> 00:54:21,205
Give me your wallet.

908
00:54:21,205 --> 00:54:22,539
What?

909
00:54:22,539 --> 00:54:24,958
You owe me $57.50
for a new stroller.

910
00:54:24,958 --> 00:54:27,377
Give me your wallet.

911
00:54:27,377 --> 00:54:32,299
OK. Sure.
Just one second.

912
00:54:32,299 --> 00:54:36,011
-Come on.
-I'm coming! All right?

913
00:54:37,012 --> 00:54:40,474
-OK. OK.
-Come on.

914
00:54:40,474 --> 00:54:41,683
Hey. Whoa.

915
00:54:41,683 --> 00:54:44,561
I paid you back.
There. Even Steven.

916
00:54:44,561 --> 00:54:46,897
Just a second.

917
00:54:46,897 --> 00:54:49,066
Hurry up! Please!

918
00:54:49,066 --> 00:54:53,278
Listen,
I don't have any change.

919
00:54:53,278 --> 00:54:54,905
Can I owe you $2.50?

920
00:54:54,905 --> 00:54:57,741
OK! Just get me
the fuck out of here!

921
00:54:57,741 --> 00:55:00,994
Watch your language.

922
00:55:00,994 --> 00:55:03,455
I need something
I can use for a rope.

923
00:55:03,455 --> 00:55:05,958
A rope?

924
00:55:07,334 --> 00:55:08,627
Give me your jacket.

925
00:55:08,627 --> 00:55:10,963
Good idea.

926
00:55:10,963 --> 00:55:13,840
You're OK, Blue. Really.

927
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,342
You're an OK guy.

928
00:55:15,342 --> 00:55:17,886
Please, Morty. God.

929
00:55:17,886 --> 00:55:20,472
Come on, Blue. Let's go.
Hurry up! Chop chop!

930
00:55:21,473 --> 00:55:23,100
OK.

931
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:25,686
No, no, no.
It's not long enough.

932
00:55:25,686 --> 00:55:28,397
Tell you what...

933
00:55:28,397 --> 00:55:30,566
give me your pants.

934
00:55:30,566 --> 00:55:32,109
My pants?

935
00:55:33,569 --> 00:55:36,029
No way. No.

936
00:55:38,198 --> 00:55:40,409
OK. OK. OK.

937
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:43,370
OK!

938
00:55:45,163 --> 00:55:47,332
They sense fear.

939
00:55:47,332 --> 00:55:49,334
I know they do, Blue.
I can see that.

940
00:55:49,334 --> 00:55:53,171
I know what fear is.
You're driving me crazy.

941
00:55:53,171 --> 00:55:55,674
See the big monkey, honey?

942
00:55:55,674 --> 00:55:57,175
See the big monkey?

943
00:55:58,176 --> 00:56:00,762
I'm so sorry about everything.

944
00:56:00,762 --> 00:56:04,933
So sorry.
It just became like--

945
00:56:06,727 --> 00:56:08,520
Oh, my God.
It's eating my shoe.

946
00:56:10,439 --> 00:56:13,442
Stay back.
Give her some room.

947
00:56:13,442 --> 00:56:15,360
Put your hand in her mouth...

948
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:18,196
or she'll swallow her tongue
like my cousin Albert!

949
00:56:19,906 --> 00:56:21,575
OK, Blue, here we go.

950
00:56:23,368 --> 00:56:25,078
Make the rope!

951
00:56:28,248 --> 00:56:29,458
OK.

952
00:56:29,458 --> 00:56:32,044
Here we go. Make the rope.

953
00:56:32,044 --> 00:56:34,379
Oh, no.
It's not going to work.

954
00:56:34,379 --> 00:56:37,924
It's just not long enough.
I'll go for help.

955
00:56:37,924 --> 00:56:40,927
Blue, please, no.
Don't leave me.

956
00:56:40,927 --> 00:56:42,929
Please don't leave me!

957
00:56:42,929 --> 00:56:45,098
Can I get you anything?
Coffee?

958
00:56:45,098 --> 00:56:47,601
I'm fine. No coffee.

959
00:56:47,601 --> 00:56:51,104
Just hurry up, please!
Bye! Thank you!

960
00:56:51,104 --> 00:56:52,606
-Ta-ta.
-Ta-ta!

961
00:56:52,606 --> 00:56:54,149
Come on, honey.

962
00:56:55,275 --> 00:56:58,445
Mary, look at the cypress.

963
00:56:58,445 --> 00:57:02,324
Hi, girls.
Afternoon, Sister.

964
00:57:02,324 --> 00:57:04,326
-Good afternoon.
-Don't miss the gators.

965
00:57:04,326 --> 00:57:07,704
Thank you. We're going
to see the gators, girls.

966
00:57:08,789 --> 00:57:12,209
Stand back, everybody.
I've got her medication.

967
00:57:12,209 --> 00:57:15,712
Here it is, darling.
It was in the car.

968
00:57:15,712 --> 00:57:18,715
Under the tongue.
Are you all right?

969
00:57:18,715 --> 00:57:21,218
Thank God.

970
00:57:21,218 --> 00:57:22,719
Thank you, Lieutenant.

971
00:57:22,719 --> 00:57:26,139
I want to thank everybody.
You've been great.

972
00:57:26,139 --> 00:57:30,602
-Thank you.
-Sweetheart, can you walk?

973
00:57:32,229 --> 00:57:34,231
I thought your performance
was excellent.

974
00:57:34,231 --> 00:57:36,691
Let's not do that anymore.

975
00:57:36,691 --> 00:57:39,736
Why not? It always works.

976
00:57:39,736 --> 00:57:41,738
I have to wash my hair again.

977
00:57:41,738 --> 00:57:45,242
Honey, it's that windblown look.
It so becomes you.

978
00:57:45,242 --> 00:57:47,244
Thank you so much.

979
00:57:47,244 --> 00:57:49,996
Come here, sweetheart.

980
00:57:49,996 --> 00:57:52,582
Want to have
some real fun tonight?

981
00:57:52,582 --> 00:57:54,084
Like last night?

982
00:57:54,084 --> 00:57:56,586
Only better.
A real fantasy.

983
00:57:56,586 --> 00:57:58,964
What'd you have in mind?

984
00:58:09,224 --> 00:58:11,226
I know you.

985
00:58:12,561 --> 00:58:16,022
Everybody know me.
I am Muerte.

986
00:58:17,816 --> 00:58:22,988
You're the guy got stomped
by that feller with the baby.

987
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:26,700
Don't provoke me, OK?

988
00:58:30,912 --> 00:58:33,248
You want to get back at him?

989
00:58:33,248 --> 00:58:34,416
What?

990
00:58:34,416 --> 00:58:36,251
I know somebody who'd pay big.

991
00:58:36,251 --> 00:58:38,003
You don't know nada.

992
00:58:38,003 --> 00:58:41,756
OK. I don't know nada.

993
00:58:43,091 --> 00:58:48,513
But this guy said Muerte's
the guy for the job.

994
00:58:51,725 --> 00:58:53,768
Who said that?

995
00:58:53,768 --> 00:58:55,770
About Muerte.

996
00:58:58,732 --> 00:59:02,277
You got to buy me a drink first.

997
00:59:02,277 --> 00:59:04,446
What would you like?

998
00:59:28,887 --> 00:59:31,806
I don't believe men.

999
00:59:31,806 --> 00:59:36,686
Three guys tried
to pick me up tonight.

1000
00:59:36,686 --> 00:59:38,730
I can understand that.

1001
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:40,732
-You can?
-Yeah.

1002
00:59:40,732 --> 00:59:43,234
My mother was right about you.

1003
00:59:44,736 --> 00:59:48,740
-Did she wake up?
-Just once around midnight.

1004
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:50,742
Just wanted to be held.

1005
00:59:50,742 --> 00:59:53,244
How did it go?
Did Morty go for it?

1006
00:59:53,244 --> 00:59:55,246
Of course he went for it.

1007
00:59:55,246 --> 00:59:57,749
God, I am so tired.

1008
01:00:00,752 --> 01:00:02,879
Keep the makeup on.

1009
01:00:02,879 --> 01:00:07,258
-Why?
-It's kind of a turn-on.

1010
01:00:07,258 --> 01:00:11,346
Yecch! You disgust me.

1011
01:00:13,598 --> 01:00:15,809
Hello?

1012
01:00:15,809 --> 01:00:17,644
Your name is what?

1013
01:00:17,644 --> 01:00:20,605
What? Death?

1014
01:00:20,605 --> 01:00:22,273
Yeah, I see.

1015
01:00:23,733 --> 01:00:25,193
It's about Blue.

1016
01:00:27,737 --> 01:00:30,115
It's the opening gambit.

1017
01:00:33,618 --> 01:00:36,871
No, no, no.
You can't find us.

1018
01:00:36,871 --> 01:00:41,042
We'll send a man to pick you up
at Bayou St. John.

1019
01:01:00,645 --> 01:01:04,315
Come along.
We are wasting time.

1020
01:01:04,315 --> 01:01:06,776
Oh, my God.
It was horrible.

1021
01:01:06,776 --> 01:01:08,194
It was a nightmare.

1022
01:01:08,194 --> 01:01:10,697
Why'd you have
to make it so bumpy?

1023
01:01:10,697 --> 01:01:12,198
Would you prefer to walk?

1024
01:01:12,198 --> 01:01:15,702
I'm all nauseous.
I'm white as a sheet.

1025
01:01:15,702 --> 01:01:19,038
It was a nightmare.
I'm a land creature.

1026
01:01:19,038 --> 01:01:21,708
After you, sir.
Frau Novacek is waiting.

1027
01:01:21,708 --> 01:01:24,586
I'm driving back, OK?

1028
01:01:24,586 --> 01:01:28,548
It's very good of you
to pay us a visit.

1029
01:01:28,548 --> 01:01:30,049
I am Paulina Novacek.

1030
01:01:30,049 --> 01:01:32,010
Your name?

1031
01:01:32,010 --> 01:01:35,513
My name is Muerte.

1032
01:01:35,513 --> 01:01:38,558
As in Death?

1033
01:01:38,558 --> 01:01:41,477
Yes. You speak Spanish?

1034
01:01:44,355 --> 01:01:46,524
I trust you.

1035
01:01:46,524 --> 01:01:49,819
Good.
Perhaps I'll trust you.

1036
01:01:49,819 --> 01:01:51,029
Come.

1037
01:01:54,991 --> 01:01:57,744
Excuse me. Paulina?

1038
01:02:10,673 --> 01:02:12,175
Thank you so much.

1039
01:02:17,305 --> 01:02:18,806
Hi, guys.

1040
01:02:18,806 --> 01:02:20,725
You can go to a strip joint.

1041
01:02:20,725 --> 01:02:23,227
We're spending
a quiet evening at home.

1042
01:02:23,227 --> 01:02:25,229
Thanks. We appreciate that.

1043
01:02:25,229 --> 01:02:27,732
Anything we can do
to make your lives easier.

1044
01:02:27,732 --> 01:02:30,234
Isn't the baby
a little young for dolls?

1045
01:02:30,234 --> 01:02:33,237
It's for me.
It's a post-feminist doll.

1046
01:02:33,237 --> 01:02:36,032
Goes to work with little
sneakers on, but resents it.

1047
01:02:36,032 --> 01:02:39,243
-Night.
-Bye.

1048
01:02:39,243 --> 01:02:43,748
They're really
very interesting people.

1049
01:02:43,748 --> 01:02:45,875
Come on.

1050
01:02:47,627 --> 01:02:50,129
I no working with him!

1051
01:02:50,129 --> 01:02:52,256
I no working with him,
you bitch!

1052
01:02:52,256 --> 01:02:55,510
No, no!
Please! Paulina!

1053
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:58,721
You expect me to believe
some bum approached you...

1054
01:02:58,721 --> 01:03:03,351
with information that Mr. Blue
is coming here tonight?

1055
01:03:03,351 --> 01:03:05,478
He's coming here tonight!

1056
01:03:05,478 --> 01:03:06,979
What if he's telling the truth?

1057
01:03:06,979 --> 01:03:08,981
Thank you very much.
What is your name?

1058
01:03:08,981 --> 01:03:10,942
So, Mr. Muerte--

1059
01:03:10,942 --> 01:03:14,487
Excuse me, please.
No mister. It's Muerte.

1060
01:03:14,487 --> 01:03:17,198
You come here pretending
to sell information.

1061
01:03:17,198 --> 01:03:22,954
You are so obviously
a confederate of Mr. Blue.

1062
01:03:30,878 --> 01:03:32,213
My family.

1063
01:03:33,923 --> 01:03:36,050
Do me a favor.

1064
01:03:37,218 --> 01:03:39,345
Be careful tonight,
all right?

1065
01:03:46,853 --> 01:03:48,855
-Jeff.
-Yeah?

1066
01:03:48,855 --> 01:03:52,358
I really mean that.
I got a funny feeling.

1067
01:03:52,358 --> 01:03:53,860
Maybe it's your allergies.

1068
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:55,862
It is not my allergies.

1069
01:03:55,862 --> 01:03:58,865
Promise me you'll be
extra careful tonight.

1070
01:03:58,865 --> 01:04:00,158
I will.

1071
01:04:02,285 --> 01:04:05,371
I love you very much.

1072
01:04:05,371 --> 01:04:07,915
You really do?

1073
01:04:07,915 --> 01:04:10,877
More and more and more
every day.

1074
01:04:10,877 --> 01:04:12,879
You know what's funny?

1075
01:04:12,879 --> 01:04:14,297
What?

1076
01:04:17,842 --> 01:04:21,095
That's exactly how I feel.

1077
01:04:46,245 --> 01:04:47,830
I'm starving.

1078
01:04:51,083 --> 01:04:53,961
-Hold down the fort.
-Yes, sir.

1079
01:04:58,341 --> 01:05:01,344
He don't listen to me.
I try telling him.

1080
01:05:01,344 --> 01:05:02,845
See what I'm saying?

1081
01:05:02,845 --> 01:05:05,765
Pay no attention
to what I'm saying.

1082
01:05:05,765 --> 01:05:07,433
Taxi!

1083
01:05:07,433 --> 01:05:10,436
Shit! Damn!

1084
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:21,280
Damn!

1085
01:05:25,201 --> 01:05:26,869
Police! Follow that cab!

1086
01:05:26,869 --> 01:05:30,706
I haven't heard anybody
say that in a long time.

1087
01:05:30,706 --> 01:05:36,045
-Come on! Just drive!
-Hold your horses.

1088
01:05:38,714 --> 01:05:40,049
Yes.

1089
01:05:42,677 --> 01:05:44,720
Yes, yes, yes.

1090
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:47,723
Frank, I think
I'm getting the hang of this.

1091
01:05:47,723 --> 01:05:50,768
It's just like
the old plastique bomb...

1092
01:05:50,768 --> 01:05:52,812
only a zillion times
more powerful.

1093
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:00,236
We will do our best, Frank.

1094
01:06:00,236 --> 01:06:03,155
Oh, my God. She walked!

1095
01:06:03,155 --> 01:06:05,783
Louise just walked.
I got to go.

1096
01:06:05,783 --> 01:06:08,202
Do you see what you just did?

1097
01:06:08,202 --> 01:06:09,703
You wonderful thing, you.

1098
01:06:09,703 --> 01:06:11,288
Wait a minute.
Now don't move.

1099
01:06:11,288 --> 01:06:12,790
Hold it. Oops!

1100
01:06:12,790 --> 01:06:14,959
Come here.

1101
01:06:14,959 --> 01:06:17,962
Do it again for Daddy.

1102
01:06:17,962 --> 01:06:19,964
Great!

1103
01:06:19,964 --> 01:06:21,465
You are amazing!

1104
01:06:21,465 --> 01:06:23,259
Come on.

1105
01:06:23,259 --> 01:06:24,760
Come on, honey.

1106
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:26,137
Come over to Mom--

1107
01:06:26,137 --> 01:06:27,972
Come to Mommy.

1108
01:06:27,972 --> 01:06:30,975
Honey, you can make it.

1109
01:06:30,975 --> 01:06:32,476
Oh, baby!

1110
01:06:32,476 --> 01:06:36,230
I can't believe you.
You are amazing.

1111
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:39,150
Come on now.
Isn't Daddy--Oh, honey.

1112
01:06:39,150 --> 01:06:41,986
Can you come to Mommy?

1113
01:06:41,986 --> 01:06:44,613
Daddy's going to be
so surprised.

1114
01:06:44,613 --> 01:06:47,950
I am so proud of you.
You are just terrific.

1115
01:06:51,704 --> 01:06:53,998
-Hi there.
-Hi.

1116
01:06:53,998 --> 01:06:56,750
-Stop here.
-l can't stop on no bridge.

1117
01:06:56,750 --> 01:07:00,254
-l don't want no ticket.
-I'm a cop.

1118
01:07:00,254 --> 01:07:03,257
You'll give me a ticket.
Entrapment.

1119
01:07:03,257 --> 01:07:07,136
Goddamn it! Stop here!
Not going to entrap you.

1120
01:07:11,473 --> 01:07:14,101
I need you to wait here.

1121
01:07:14,101 --> 01:07:16,604
I can't wait
outside the city limits.

1122
01:07:16,604 --> 01:07:20,149
-That's the law.
-Just wait here!

1123
01:07:20,149 --> 01:07:22,067
I don't think so.

1124
01:07:23,235 --> 01:07:24,695
Damn it!

1125
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:29,867
You going to cast off for me?

1126
01:07:29,867 --> 01:07:32,119
-Sure will.
-All right.

1127
01:07:32,119 --> 01:07:34,622
How long do you think
it'll take me?

1128
01:07:34,622 --> 01:07:36,665
You'll be there by dawn.

1129
01:07:38,667 --> 01:07:40,878
-Got it?
-Got it.

1130
01:07:40,878 --> 01:07:42,212
Thanks.

1131
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:21,293
You lost your parade.

1132
01:08:21,293 --> 01:08:24,296
Have a seat. Come on.

1133
01:08:24,296 --> 01:08:25,798
Play something else.

1134
01:08:50,864 --> 01:08:53,826
Honey. It's OK.

1135
01:09:11,719 --> 01:09:14,972
This her?
This pretty little thing?

1136
01:09:14,972 --> 01:09:17,474
She's more dangerous
than she looks...

1137
01:09:17,474 --> 01:09:19,476
but you can handle her.

1138
01:09:19,476 --> 01:09:22,479
She don't look dangerous
at all to me.

1139
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:25,607
Come on, sugar. Come to Papa.

1140
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:30,112
Careful, Sikes.
I don't want her hurt.

1141
01:09:30,112 --> 01:09:33,866
Sure thing. She'll be
lots more fun later on...

1142
01:09:33,866 --> 01:09:36,285
if she ain't all banged up.

1143
01:09:36,285 --> 01:09:38,287
Ain't you the clever one?

1144
01:09:38,287 --> 01:09:40,247
You bet I'm clever.

1145
01:09:40,247 --> 01:09:44,084
Wait till you see what
I got for you.

1146
01:09:48,297 --> 01:09:50,883
So far,
I'm not very impressed.

1147
01:09:50,883 --> 01:09:53,677
I'm going to get you.

1148
01:09:56,555 --> 01:09:57,764
Gotcha!

1149
01:09:58,849 --> 01:10:00,684
Damn!

1150
01:10:08,150 --> 01:10:10,694
Sikes...

1151
01:10:12,696 --> 01:10:14,698
Put it away.

1152
01:10:22,831 --> 01:10:25,876
It's a taser.

1153
01:10:25,876 --> 01:10:28,795
You're not going to give me
any more trouble, are you?

1154
01:10:54,321 --> 01:10:56,323
Having fun?

1155
01:10:56,323 --> 01:10:59,326
What in the hell
are you doing here?

1156
01:10:59,326 --> 01:11:02,329
I'm not here.
I'm at home, like you.

1157
01:11:02,329 --> 01:11:05,332
Ted, you're in way over
your head.

1158
01:11:05,332 --> 01:11:06,833
Just wait on the boat.

1159
01:11:06,833 --> 01:11:10,253
Not a chance.
And call me Lieutenant.

1160
01:11:10,253 --> 01:11:12,297
Lieutenant, believe me--

1161
01:11:12,297 --> 01:11:14,383
-No.
-Why not?

1162
01:11:14,383 --> 01:11:18,178
My orders are not to let you
out of my sight.

1163
01:11:19,513 --> 01:11:23,016
OK. Just stay close.

1164
01:11:25,686 --> 01:11:29,231
Whatever happens,
do exactly what I say...

1165
01:11:29,231 --> 01:11:31,274
no matter
how nuts it may sound.

1166
01:11:31,274 --> 01:11:32,859
Absolutely.

1167
01:11:34,111 --> 01:11:35,278
Where's your gun?

1168
01:11:35,278 --> 01:11:39,783
I don't carry a gun.
Pay attention.

1169
01:11:41,785 --> 01:11:45,914
Careful.
Things could get very sticky.

1170
01:11:48,917 --> 01:11:51,211
Good morning, Mr. Blue.

1171
01:11:51,211 --> 01:11:53,922
This is amazing.

1172
01:11:53,922 --> 01:11:57,217
I was just saying
things could get very sticky.

1173
01:11:57,217 --> 01:12:01,304
It's good to see you again.

1174
01:12:01,304 --> 01:12:04,015
You haven't changed. Have l?

1175
01:12:04,015 --> 01:12:05,517
Only your men.

1176
01:12:05,517 --> 01:12:10,272
Thank you.
It's these American accessories.

1177
01:12:10,272 --> 01:12:13,483
They're very good.

1178
01:12:13,483 --> 01:12:17,154
Come. We must have some tea.

1179
01:12:19,281 --> 01:12:23,285
You are still having
such a wonderful body, Mr. Blue.

1180
01:12:23,285 --> 01:12:24,619
Well, thank you.

1181
01:12:24,619 --> 01:12:26,288
What do you think
of the lieutenant?

1182
01:12:26,288 --> 01:12:27,956
Will you shut up?

1183
01:12:27,956 --> 01:12:32,294
You're so...
How you say the word? Foxy.

1184
01:12:32,294 --> 01:12:33,503
Shall we?

1185
01:12:33,503 --> 01:12:36,506
Also you're
a very valuable commodity.

1186
01:12:36,506 --> 01:12:38,759
Think what the Libyans
would pay...

1187
01:12:38,759 --> 01:12:41,136
for your knowledge
of American intelligence.

1188
01:12:41,136 --> 01:12:43,805
Or the Chinese.
Or the Colombians.

1189
01:12:43,805 --> 01:12:46,308
I think quite
a lot of money, Mr. Blue.

1190
01:12:46,308 --> 01:12:49,311
See?
Most people do like me.

1191
01:12:58,195 --> 01:12:59,654
Surprise.

1192
01:13:00,864 --> 01:13:03,241
I'm sorry, Jeff.

1193
01:13:03,241 --> 01:13:06,244
This is between you and me.

1194
01:13:06,244 --> 01:13:08,121
To involve Jane or my child--

1195
01:13:08,121 --> 01:13:12,125
I know. It was in
the worst possible taste.

1196
01:13:12,125 --> 01:13:15,420
You see,
in just half an hour...

1197
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:17,756
a helicopter and
Comrade Zubic will arrive...

1198
01:13:17,756 --> 01:13:21,760
to transfer the C-22
to a cargo vessel.

1199
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:24,387
You and I will travel with it.

1200
01:13:24,387 --> 01:13:26,389
What's C-22?

1201
01:13:26,389 --> 01:13:29,476
I was meaning
to tell you about that.

1202
01:13:29,476 --> 01:13:31,228
Bring him in.

1203
01:13:35,106 --> 01:13:39,486
So...you see, Mr. Blue?

1204
01:13:39,486 --> 01:13:43,782
I have captured
all your confederates.

1205
01:13:43,782 --> 01:13:46,284
Paulina, Paulina, Paulina...

1206
01:13:46,284 --> 01:13:48,203
my hat's off to you.

1207
01:13:48,203 --> 01:13:49,996
Why not your pants?

1208
01:13:49,996 --> 01:13:51,957
I could figure you getting me.

1209
01:13:51,957 --> 01:13:54,459
I could figure
you grabbing Jane.

1210
01:13:54,459 --> 01:13:57,921
But to get your hands on
the boss man himself...

1211
01:13:57,921 --> 01:13:59,422
the big ''M''.

1212
01:14:00,674 --> 01:14:03,343
You're saying this man
is your superior?

1213
01:14:03,343 --> 01:14:06,346
I said to him,
''Sir, the risk is too great.

1214
01:14:06,346 --> 01:14:08,265
''You stay here
in the Hollow Mountain...

1215
01:14:08,265 --> 01:14:10,267
''where it's safe,
and I shall go forth--''

1216
01:14:10,267 --> 01:14:11,768
Take his gag off.

1217
01:14:11,768 --> 01:14:15,355
No! No! No!
My name is Morty.

1218
01:14:15,355 --> 01:14:16,606
Muerte.

1219
01:14:16,606 --> 01:14:19,192
I kill you.

1220
01:14:19,192 --> 01:14:21,027
Shut up!

1221
01:14:21,027 --> 01:14:24,531
Someone find out who this man is
and then kill him.

1222
01:14:24,531 --> 01:14:26,533
I've got no time for this.

1223
01:14:26,533 --> 01:14:29,035
Mrs. Blue,
passing your child over.

1224
01:14:29,035 --> 01:14:30,620
No! Don't do it!

1225
01:14:32,872 --> 01:14:35,959
How heroic.

1226
01:14:35,959 --> 01:14:41,840
Mrs. Blue, you are of
absolutely no value to me...

1227
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:44,843
except as an example
to your husband.

1228
01:14:44,843 --> 01:14:48,638
Jane, you know what to do.

1229
01:16:14,098 --> 01:16:16,559
Would you please hold still?

1230
01:16:16,559 --> 01:16:17,769
Those are police cuffs.

1231
01:16:17,769 --> 01:16:20,271
You can't get them off
with a bobby pin.

1232
01:16:20,271 --> 01:16:22,524
-Absolutely right.
-Thanks, hon.

1233
01:16:22,524 --> 01:16:25,527
-Want me to work on yours?
-Yeah, please.

1234
01:16:25,527 --> 01:16:27,028
Guess who walked today.

1235
01:16:27,028 --> 01:16:29,030
You're kidding?
And I missed it?

1236
01:16:29,030 --> 01:16:31,032
I'm really mad at you, too.

1237
01:16:31,032 --> 01:16:33,993
Whose idea was it to take
this job anyway?

1238
01:16:33,993 --> 01:16:37,372
We got to get out of here.
Follow me!

1239
01:16:37,372 --> 01:16:38,581
''Follow me''?

1240
01:16:38,581 --> 01:16:40,041
Give him his moment in the sun.

1241
01:16:40,041 --> 01:16:42,043
What sun?

1242
01:16:59,894 --> 01:17:03,189
Son of a bitch! Damn it!

1243
01:17:03,189 --> 01:17:04,440
How badly are you hit?

1244
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:06,609
I'm not hit.
I just smashed my knee.

1245
01:17:06,609 --> 01:17:09,279
This is why I hate
working with amateurs.

1246
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:23,293
Where the hell are you from?

1247
01:17:23,293 --> 01:17:25,295
North Adams, Massachusetts.
Why?

1248
01:17:25,295 --> 01:17:26,796
Just asking.

1249
01:17:31,217 --> 01:17:32,427
Damn!

1250
01:17:50,153 --> 01:17:51,612
Where is it?

1251
01:17:58,161 --> 01:18:00,663
-You wait here!
-No way.

1252
01:18:00,663 --> 01:18:04,167
Jane's an expert in martial arts
I can't pronounce.

1253
01:18:04,167 --> 01:18:07,170
She can kill you three ways
without using her hands.

1254
01:18:07,170 --> 01:18:08,629
Do what she says.

1255
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:13,342
Maybe I'll wait here.

1256
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:52,215
Czech-mate.

1257
01:18:56,552 --> 01:18:59,055
Daylight.

1258
01:18:59,055 --> 01:19:01,974
Zubic! Zubic!

1259
01:19:12,985 --> 01:19:14,987
Bring it over, you idiot.

1260
01:19:14,987 --> 01:19:17,114
I am surrounded by fools.

1261
01:19:18,115 --> 01:19:21,327
Climb up, Paulina! Climb up!

1262
01:19:21,327 --> 01:19:25,456
I can't!
This case is too heavy!

1263
01:19:30,378 --> 01:19:32,421
Improvise!

1264
01:19:37,969 --> 01:19:40,513
Down! We must go down!

1265
01:19:48,938 --> 01:19:52,525
Easy. Don't...let me fall.

1266
01:19:52,525 --> 01:19:54,610
Zubic, get this thing up!

1267
01:19:54,610 --> 01:19:56,112
This is good!

1268
01:19:56,112 --> 01:19:58,614
Remember!
Make it look real!

1269
01:19:58,614 --> 01:19:59,991
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1270
01:20:13,921 --> 01:20:16,799
Hey! Remember Helsinki!

1271
01:20:23,723 --> 01:20:25,850
Gotcha, lady!

1272
01:20:27,101 --> 01:20:28,644
Good wrist lock, hon.

1273
01:20:28,644 --> 01:20:30,563
Thank you.

1274
01:20:32,273 --> 01:20:33,607
Come here!

1275
01:20:35,151 --> 01:20:37,194
Come on!

1276
01:20:37,194 --> 01:20:39,697
Be careful where you shoot.

1277
01:20:43,951 --> 01:20:45,995
Mr. Blue.

1278
01:20:45,995 --> 01:20:49,332
Have you come to watch
your wife die?

1279
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,253
No! Don't do that!
You'll kill us all!

1280
01:20:54,253 --> 01:20:56,005
If Jane goes, we all go.

1281
01:20:56,005 --> 01:20:59,342
Just a minute.
Think about it.

1282
01:20:59,342 --> 01:21:01,344
Don't be such a jerk, Jeff.

1283
01:21:01,344 --> 01:21:05,639
This is your chance.
Let her go and you can have...

1284
01:21:05,639 --> 01:21:08,059
You can have everything.

1285
01:21:08,059 --> 01:21:11,062
I'm getting seriously pissed.

1286
01:21:11,062 --> 01:21:12,813
No!

1287
01:21:12,813 --> 01:21:14,899
So am l!

1288
01:21:19,487 --> 01:21:23,491
We're naming the kid
Jane Louise. Period.

1289
01:21:25,117 --> 01:21:26,327
OK.

1290
01:21:29,038 --> 01:21:30,539
Dropping your weapons...

1291
01:21:30,539 --> 01:21:33,042
or you'll be
shooted from the air!

1292
01:21:33,042 --> 01:21:35,503
Zubic! Zubic!

1293
01:21:35,503 --> 01:21:38,422
Face down in the mud,
everybody.

1294
01:21:38,422 --> 01:21:40,925
Hurry, Paulina!
You're not safe!

1295
01:21:40,925 --> 01:21:44,845
-I'm coming!
-We've got to get you out!

1296
01:21:44,845 --> 01:21:47,848
Hurry, Paulina!
We've got to get you out!

1297
01:21:47,848 --> 01:21:51,769
You are not safe! Get in!

1298
01:21:51,769 --> 01:21:53,813
Thank you. Thank you.

1299
01:21:56,899 --> 01:21:59,527
We did it!

1300
01:22:01,403 --> 01:22:05,616
I had begun to think
you had forgotten me.

1301
01:22:05,616 --> 01:22:08,702
Oh, Paulina.
We have never forgotten.

1302
01:22:08,702 --> 01:22:10,162
Oh, Zubic.

1303
01:22:11,247 --> 01:22:12,873
What?

1304
01:22:12,873 --> 01:22:16,585
And thank you for flying
Air Czechoslovakia.

1305
01:22:18,963 --> 01:22:21,423
Like I said, no one
ever looks at the driver.

1306
01:22:21,423 --> 01:22:24,051
You going to tell me
the rest of the story?

1307
01:22:24,051 --> 01:22:27,054
-Sure. Where was l?
-Czech police.

1308
01:22:27,054 --> 01:22:29,348
The Czechs had permission
to come in...

1309
01:22:29,348 --> 01:22:31,141
but they couldn't
just snatch Novacek.

1310
01:22:31,141 --> 01:22:33,978
We had to create a situation
where she'd leave willingly.

1311
01:22:33,978 --> 01:22:35,521
You saw her
get in the chopper.

1312
01:22:35,521 --> 01:22:37,898
She went of
her own free will.

1313
01:22:37,898 --> 01:22:39,400
No kidnapping, no coercion.

1314
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:41,402
You going to wake him up?

1315
01:22:41,402 --> 01:22:42,820
What for?

1316
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:45,072
-Janie!
-There's our baby!

1317
01:22:46,448 --> 01:22:48,617
Hi, honey.

1318
01:22:48,617 --> 01:22:49,827
Hi, sweetie.

1319
01:22:54,415 --> 01:22:56,000
Thank you so much.

1320
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,128
What have you two lovebirds
been up to all night?

1321
01:22:59,128 --> 01:23:02,631
There's a new mud wrestling
place on Bourbon Street.

1322
01:23:02,631 --> 01:23:04,633
Food's not bad, either.

1323
01:23:06,093 --> 01:23:08,304
You guys have so much fun.

1324
01:23:08,304 --> 01:23:10,598
We have a lot of fun, too.

1325
01:23:10,598 --> 01:23:12,725
-l could tell.
-Thank you again.

1326
01:23:12,725 --> 01:23:16,478
-I'm so jealous.
-See you later.

1327
01:23:16,478 --> 01:23:19,648
Yeah. You can go home
and clean up, Lieutenant.

1328
01:23:19,648 --> 01:23:22,651
-What?
-It's over. Finished.

1329
01:23:22,651 --> 01:23:26,822
No plans to invade Cuba while
you're in the neighbourhood?

1330
01:23:26,822 --> 01:23:29,325
No. We're shipping out today.

1331
01:23:29,325 --> 01:23:31,910
I have your word on that?

1332
01:23:56,727 --> 01:23:58,354
Please, please, please.

1333
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:15,579
Sleeping like a baby.

1334
01:24:23,921 --> 01:24:26,256
Hi, Morty.

1335
01:24:26,256 --> 01:24:28,008
Morty?

1336
01:24:28,008 --> 01:24:33,055
OK. No more Mr. Nice Guy.

1337
01:24:38,268 --> 01:24:42,856
Blue, help me! I can't swim!

1338
01:24:42,856 --> 01:24:45,442
What do you think?

1339
01:24:45,442 --> 01:24:47,444
I'm going down!
I can't swim! Please!

1340
01:24:47,444 --> 01:24:49,947
Mr. and Mrs. Blue!
S.O.S.! Help!

1341
01:24:49,947 --> 01:24:51,490
Yeah.

1342
01:24:51,490 --> 01:24:54,576
My God! Oh, Jesus!
The ocean is so deep!

1343
01:24:54,576 --> 01:24:56,787
Catch!

1344
01:24:59,206 --> 01:25:00,707
Oh, my God!

1345
01:25:00,707 --> 01:25:04,211
Oh, God!
Thank you, Mrs. Blue!

1346
01:25:04,211 --> 01:25:07,422
You are a great woman!
The woman of the Nineties!

1347
01:25:07,422 --> 01:25:10,884
Mrs. Blue, throw me
a piece of rope, please!

1348
01:25:10,884 --> 01:25:14,179
I tell you what. Wait here.
We'll go for help.

1349
01:25:14,179 --> 01:25:16,515
No, no, no!
Don't leave me!

1350
01:25:16,515 --> 01:25:18,392
Anything you want?
Coffee, tea?

1351
01:25:18,392 --> 01:25:21,311
Coffee, tea? No, I'm fine.
Thank you very much.

1352
01:25:21,311 --> 01:25:23,272
Just get me the hell
out of here, please!

1353
01:25:23,272 --> 01:25:25,023
-Morty.
-What?

1354
01:25:25,023 --> 01:25:26,191
Ta-ta.

1355
01:25:27,359 --> 01:25:28,527
Ta-ta.

1356
01:25:31,655 --> 01:25:33,866
Now...

1357
01:25:33,866 --> 01:25:35,492
which way is Cuba?

1358
01:25:41,206 --> 01:25:45,210
No! That's the wrong way!
Please! Come back!

1359
01:25:45,210 --> 01:25:47,462
No! The land
is back there behind you!

1360
01:25:47,462 --> 01:25:50,465
Where you going? Blue, no!
