1
00:01:09,185 --> 00:01:11,351
What the fuck is your problem?

2
00:01:11,352 --> 00:01:14,476
No disrespect, Silas.
My bumbaclot Johnson no working, see?

3
00:01:14,477 --> 00:01:17,017
- What?
- My rassclot true gashman.

4
00:01:17,018 --> 00:01:18,850
My dick won't stay thick, see?

5
00:01:18,851 --> 00:01:21,851
I think I got something for that.
Hold on.

6
00:01:23,185 --> 00:01:24,892
Girl,

7
00:01:24,893 --> 00:01:26,850
wake your ass up.

8
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:28,851
Damn well you ain't sleeping.

9
00:01:31,685 --> 00:01:33,267
"Crabs,"

10
00:01:33,268 --> 00:01:35,226
"bad breath,"

11
00:01:35,227 --> 00:01:37,185
"limp dick."!

12
00:01:38,018 --> 00:01:39,352
Got that dough?

13
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:44,351
Will this make my drill sergeant
stand at attention?

14
00:01:44,352 --> 00:01:46,601
No, but it'll make you forget
your drill sergeant

15
00:01:46,602 --> 00:01:49,017
don't stand at attention.
Get at me in the morning.

16
00:01:49,018 --> 00:01:52,975
- Peace!
- Silas, my brother!

17
00:01:52,976 --> 00:01:55,393
Oh, shit, Mikey, hell no!

18
00:01:55,394 --> 00:01:57,351
Hey, come on, Silas,

19
00:01:57,352 --> 00:02:00,101
I need something to help me out.

20
00:02:00,102 --> 00:02:03,393
Yeah, rehab, mouthwash,
and a job application.

21
00:02:03,394 --> 00:02:04,559
Jeez.

22
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,934
I'm starting to recognize things.

23
00:02:07,935 --> 00:02:10,476
That's because you coming down
off a three month crack binge.

24
00:02:10,477 --> 00:02:12,725
It's called reality, son.
Later, man.

25
00:02:12,726 --> 00:02:16,101
Wait, wait, Silas!
You got anything for a head wound?

26
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:18,394
Man, ain't nothing wrong with your head.

27
00:02:22,394 --> 00:02:24,726
There is now.

28
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,394
Fucking crackhead.

29
00:02:29,685 --> 00:02:31,351
Now what?

30
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:33,726
- Oh, shit, Ive.
- What's up, dog?

31
00:02:37,102 --> 00:02:39,892
- What's up, nigger?
- What's cracking?

32
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,518
Ain't shit, you know.

33
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:45,309
You get my message
about going to the Jets game?

34
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,767
I wish I could, dog.

35
00:02:46,768 --> 00:02:49,101
But I got this shorty
coming through tonight.

36
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,934
Met her on the internet.
Chickenheads.com.

37
00:02:50,935 --> 00:02:52,767
This girl is banging.

38
00:02:52,768 --> 00:02:55,267
We even exchanged
pictures and everything.

39
00:02:55,268 --> 00:02:58,309
Damn, this look like your last girlfriend.

40
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,434
And did your picture have that nasty

41
00:03:00,435 --> 00:03:03,226
Al B. Sure pubic patch in it, motherfucker?

42
00:03:03,227 --> 00:03:04,850
This just sprang up.

43
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,559
You know what I think it is?

44
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,267
It's the mark of Buddha.

45
00:03:08,268 --> 00:03:10,643
And your haircut game is fucked up.

46
00:03:10,644 --> 00:03:13,142
Girlfriend see that,
she going to shit on you.

47
00:03:13,143 --> 00:03:16,142
This girl is different. All she cares
about is Kevin Costner movies.

48
00:03:16,143 --> 00:03:18,975
I'm going to let Kev do the foreplay,
right?

49
00:03:18,976 --> 00:03:22,476
I figured I'd get something from the
Garden of Weeden to make it interesting.

50
00:03:22,477 --> 00:03:24,434
- Costner?
- Uhuh.

51
00:03:24,435 --> 00:03:26,975
- "Dances With Wolves."
- "Field Of Dreams."

52
00:03:26,976 --> 00:03:29,226
That's a corny motherfucker.

53
00:03:29,227 --> 00:03:31,601
You going to need some strong shit
just to stay awake.

54
00:03:31,602 --> 00:03:33,643
- Come on.
- You're feeling me.

55
00:03:33,644 --> 00:03:36,059
That's a four-hour-movie-making
motherfucker.

56
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,975
What is this?

57
00:03:37,976 --> 00:03:40,518
Whee!

58
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:44,142
- You shouldn't have.
- I didn't. Get out of here.

59
00:03:44,143 --> 00:03:46,850
- Man, let me just grab a titty.
- Hell, no.

60
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:49,226
- She wouldn't even know it was me.
- To hell with that.

61
00:03:49,227 --> 00:03:51,059
What you got for me?

62
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,476
Here you go. The bomb.

63
00:03:52,477 --> 00:03:54,434
- Yeah. What's this?
- Aaah!

64
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:57,850
Stop touching stuff!

65
00:03:57,851 --> 00:04:00,077
When are you getting
some funds for this shit?

66
00:04:00,098 --> 00:04:01,309
See that right there?

67
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,684
That's a natural aphrodisiac.

68
00:04:03,685 --> 00:04:05,393
Come here, let me show you some more shit.

69
00:04:05,394 --> 00:04:07,101
Look right there? See that?

70
00:04:07,102 --> 00:04:09,059
That's a painkiller.
Look under there, bro'.

71
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,725
You see that? Cure for blueballs.

72
00:04:10,726 --> 00:04:13,184
This ain't shit, all right?
Watch yourself.

73
00:04:13,185 --> 00:04:16,975
Yeah, well, your shit is raggedier
than a motherfucker, okay.

74
00:04:16,976 --> 00:04:18,434
If you took your head out these hos

75
00:04:18,435 --> 00:04:20,226
and put 'em in some books,

76
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:21,684
you'd have that lab
you always talked about.

77
00:04:21,685 --> 00:04:24,184
Half those books is filled with bullshit.

78
00:04:24,185 --> 00:04:26,809
The other half lies, alright.
See what I'm saying?

79
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,850
I got to give Pops his medicine, man.

80
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,850
I'm hungrier than four dudes.

81
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:33,684
Hey, I'm hungrier than five.

82
00:04:33,685 --> 00:04:36,184
Well,
who is you and what you doing in my house?

83
00:04:36,185 --> 00:04:37,767
I went for "Pork Chops O'Chunky."

84
00:04:37,768 --> 00:04:39,809
Whether you're black,
or honky, or in-between,

85
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:42,934
you'll love "Pork Chops O'Chunky."
Man, that's mean.

86
00:04:42,935 --> 00:04:45,643
- So what's in this stuff?
- Man, nothing but pork.

87
00:04:45,644 --> 00:04:47,892
Right on, then!

88
00:04:47,893 --> 00:04:52,267
- There you go.
- You're scared to answer your calling.

89
00:04:52,268 --> 00:04:54,352
Man, what calling?

90
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,434
You got an opportunity
to do something here...

91
00:05:03,435 --> 00:05:05,559
that the drug companies would never do.

92
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,684
Let's put the power of healing
back into the hands of the common man.

93
00:05:08,685 --> 00:05:10,434
Hey, whatever, man.
What you need to do

94
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,892
is concentrate on
getting the power of booty

95
00:05:12,893 --> 00:05:16,059
into the hands of your common ass.
That's what the hell you need to do.

96
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,434
Don't worry about the Ive.
I got mine coming tonight.

97
00:05:18,435 --> 00:05:21,767
- Hey, Silas!
- You see the ass on the red one?

98
00:05:21,768 --> 00:05:25,101
- Simple.
- Just remember to take them THCs.

99
00:05:25,102 --> 00:05:27,101
At least try to get into college.

100
00:05:27,102 --> 00:05:29,268
Working in a real lab,
making some real money.

101
00:05:30,143 --> 00:05:32,101
Okay, Ive, whatever, man.

102
00:05:32,102 --> 00:05:34,850
- If you say so, bro'.
- The world is bigger than Staten Island.

103
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:37,268
I'm out.

104
00:05:40,768 --> 00:05:43,267
- Holler at me.
- I'll try to.

105
00:05:43,268 --> 00:05:45,059
- What's up, ladies?
- Si,

106
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,767
if I got hit by a bus tomorrow,
I got your back.

107
00:05:47,768 --> 00:05:50,101
If anything happened to me,
or I jumped out a window

108
00:05:50,102 --> 00:05:52,643
and my hair caught on fire,
I got your back, dog.

109
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:55,184
If my ex came after me
with a knife and stabbed me,

110
00:05:55,185 --> 00:05:58,059
- I got your back!
- You talk too much, Ive.

111
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,017
- Peace!
- Silas!

112
00:06:00,018 --> 00:06:02,143
You'd better take those college exams!

113
00:06:03,477 --> 00:06:05,934
Look at Jamal, he's a good boy?

114
00:06:05,935 --> 00:06:09,309
Good boy, my ass.
I had to cancel my nail appointment

115
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,351
to pick him up at the precinct last week.

116
00:06:12,352 --> 00:06:14,684
- Momma, they lying.
- They lying?

117
00:06:14,685 --> 00:06:17,643
- They found the weed on you, didn't they?
- It wasn't mine.

118
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:21,393
Then what is this that
I found in your bedroom?

119
00:06:21,394 --> 00:06:24,101
Hello. Ma, it is a lamp.

120
00:06:24,102 --> 00:06:27,476
And this is where you turn it on at.
Excuse me?

121
00:06:27,477 --> 00:06:29,268
Head.

122
00:06:34,768 --> 00:06:38,142
Now, where did I go wrong with your ass?

123
00:06:38,143 --> 00:06:40,267
You going to have to take that THC test

124
00:06:40,268 --> 00:06:41,725
and get into a four-year college

125
00:06:41,726 --> 00:06:43,684
or I'm just cut you off from this family.

126
00:06:43,685 --> 00:06:47,351
You are the first member of this family

127
00:06:47,352 --> 00:06:49,518
to go to college.

128
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,850
But six years at a
two-year community college

129
00:06:51,851 --> 00:06:53,684
is not what I had in mind.

130
00:06:53,685 --> 00:06:56,351
- Tell the truth.
- I got a dream that one day

131
00:06:56,352 --> 00:06:58,309
I can put your college diploma here

132
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,601
under my Jesus, who's master of this house,

133
00:07:00,602 --> 00:07:04,267
next to your brother's
prison-issue barber certificate

134
00:07:04,268 --> 00:07:06,725
and your sister's weave-master degree.

135
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,684
Now don't disappoint me.

136
00:07:08,685 --> 00:07:11,518
You weed smoking,
three-day-wearing nasty ass.

137
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:13,559
Just like your father.

138
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,184
Why you always talking to me
like that in front of company?

139
00:07:17,185 --> 00:07:19,351
These bitches ain't nobody.

140
00:07:19,352 --> 00:07:21,559
Now go warm me up some
"Pork Chops O'Chunky."

141
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,892
- Is that all, Momma?
- Wash your nasty ass!

142
00:07:24,893 --> 00:07:27,726
Is that all, Momma?

143
00:07:31,143 --> 00:07:33,060
You the man.

144
00:07:34,227 --> 00:07:38,519
- What's up, baby?
- Hell no!

145
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:42,643
I didn't know you had dreads!
And what is that?

146
00:07:42,644 --> 00:07:45,850
Brother just got extensions put in today.
They tight?

147
00:07:45,851 --> 00:07:48,476
Where? Between your eyes?

148
00:07:48,477 --> 00:07:51,518
- What the hell is that?
- It's the mark of Buddha.

149
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:53,892
It's the skidmark of Buddha!

150
00:07:53,893 --> 00:07:56,559
Looks like he took a dump
in the middle of your face!

151
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,601
- I don't think this is gonna work out.
- Hold on, now!

152
00:07:59,602 --> 00:08:03,267
Why are you doing this? I rented "Field
Of Dreams" and "Dances with Wolves."

153
00:08:03,268 --> 00:08:06,309
Nigger, you are a wolf.

154
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:09,227
Chocolate diva! Nubian goddess!

155
00:08:10,102 --> 00:08:13,518
I'm taking you off my buddy list, bitch!

156
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:16,310
I hope you get a virus!
You and your computer.

157
00:08:17,893 --> 00:08:20,850
If you build it, they will come.

158
00:08:20,851 --> 00:08:22,767
What you mean they'll come?

159
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,767
Who's going to come to a fucking cornfield?

160
00:08:24,768 --> 00:08:27,101
Who's going to cut the grass?

161
00:08:27,102 --> 00:08:29,809
I know you don't expect me to sell
no peanuts out there, bitch.

162
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,725
Shit remind me of slavery.
"Roots" and shit, man.

163
00:08:32,726 --> 00:08:34,684
I don't play this, man.

164
00:08:34,685 --> 00:08:37,850
- What was that? Annie!
- Crazy ho!

165
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:41,393
Only way I'm coming is if you got
some females and some chronic.

166
00:08:41,394 --> 00:08:43,850
And then we all going to be coming.

167
00:08:43,851 --> 00:08:46,434
- That voice, what was it?
- We didn't hear anything!

168
00:08:46,435 --> 00:08:49,393
She got some nice titties, dog. Word.

169
00:08:49,394 --> 00:08:51,684
What titties? What?

170
00:08:51,685 --> 00:08:54,142
Okay, you must've heard that!

171
00:08:54,143 --> 00:08:56,142
It's a good baseball field, Ray.

172
00:08:56,143 --> 00:08:58,476
It's kind of pretty.

173
00:08:58,477 --> 00:09:00,684
- I told you.
- You did not.

174
00:09:00,685 --> 00:09:03,227
- I did.
- No, you did not.

175
00:09:08,893 --> 00:09:11,143
Oh god!

176
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,809
Mark of Buddha, my ass.

177
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,142
Look at you now. Dead. Ashes.

178
00:09:24,143 --> 00:09:26,309
Damn, Ivory.

179
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,059
After all these years of blazing,

180
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,017
who would've thought the last thing
you'd wind up smoking

181
00:09:31,018 --> 00:09:34,434
would be your ass?
I'm gonna miss you, dog.

182
00:09:34,435 --> 00:09:38,267
I'm going to be thinking about you
while I'm taking them THCs.

183
00:09:38,268 --> 00:09:39,975
And if you're really my boy,

184
00:09:39,976 --> 00:09:42,810
you'll make sure I pass
that motherfucker, you heard?

185
00:09:43,768 --> 00:09:45,226
Thanks, Pops.

186
00:09:45,227 --> 00:09:48,226
What's up with that joint?
Can I get a little...

187
00:09:48,227 --> 00:09:50,809
Never mind. Forget it.

188
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:53,017
Bald-ass motherfucker.

189
00:09:53,018 --> 00:09:55,185
Stingy bastard.

190
00:09:56,394 --> 00:09:58,310
Shit.

191
00:09:59,851 --> 00:10:02,892
"Early girl."

192
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:07,685
Ivory. My how you've grown.

193
00:10:12,435 --> 00:10:15,017
Damn, Ivory!

194
00:10:15,018 --> 00:10:18,059
I had no idea you could
stink so good, nigger!

195
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,060
Jeez.

196
00:10:24,435 --> 00:10:28,017
Hey, man, get that car fixed!

197
00:10:28,018 --> 00:10:31,560
Blunt o'clock, boy.

198
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,184
Man, get the fuck out of here.

199
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:46,018
Look at this little ass
bag of fucking weed.

200
00:10:48,018 --> 00:10:51,393
Yes, Lord.

201
00:10:51,394 --> 00:10:53,102
Oooh. Damn!

202
00:10:57,268 --> 00:10:59,768
Oooh.

203
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,768
Oh, shit! My weed!

204
00:11:12,435 --> 00:11:15,518
No cigar? No!

205
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,227
Fuck, fuck! Bitch!

206
00:11:26,726 --> 00:11:28,394
Got blunt?

207
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:32,601
Got weed?

208
00:11:32,602 --> 00:11:35,684
That shit smell good as hell.
I'm Jamal.

209
00:11:35,685 --> 00:11:36,850
Peace. Silas.

210
00:11:36,851 --> 00:11:38,559
So you trying to get something

211
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,226
to bring them nerves down too?

212
00:11:40,227 --> 00:11:42,934
I figured if I study high,
take the tests high,

213
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:46,434
- I'll get high scores, right?
- Right.

214
00:11:46,435 --> 00:11:48,102
- Right.
- Right.

215
00:11:50,268 --> 00:11:53,934
- Look at that car.
- Is it on fire?

216
00:11:53,935 --> 00:11:56,810
Take that, son.

217
00:12:14,018 --> 00:12:17,017
- This is the shit.
- That shit is called the Ivory shit.

218
00:12:17,018 --> 00:12:19,434
- It's the shit.
- That's the Ivory right there.

219
00:12:19,435 --> 00:12:22,518
- Goddamn.
- Thanks.

220
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:24,851
- Oops.
- Pass that, kid.

221
00:12:26,185 --> 00:12:28,601
I just gave it to the guy in the back, man.

222
00:12:28,602 --> 00:12:31,017
Guy in the back? Fuck is he...?

223
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:33,267
- What's up, dog?
- That's Ivory.

224
00:12:33,268 --> 00:12:36,767
No, that's the Ivory. Damn.

225
00:12:36,768 --> 00:12:39,476
Ivory? Oh, shit!
You got to be kidding me!

226
00:12:39,477 --> 00:12:41,519
Silas! Chill out! Silas!

227
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:44,226
Word.

228
00:12:44,227 --> 00:12:46,059
What the fuck is going on?

229
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,351
Ain't you supposed to be dead?

230
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:50,975
I am dead. But this is what
happens when you smoke your boy.

231
00:12:50,976 --> 00:12:53,434
Holy shit. Let me try that.

232
00:12:53,435 --> 00:12:56,017
Relax. Can we talk about this in your car?

233
00:12:56,018 --> 00:12:58,394
I know how you can get high scores.

234
00:13:03,976 --> 00:13:07,684
I'm a ghost, ghost, ghost.

235
00:13:07,685 --> 00:13:11,309
- Now, don't touch me.
- It's me, dog.

236
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:14,476
What are you doing? Running the streets,
fucking with the living?

237
00:13:14,477 --> 00:13:16,643
No, bro'. I'm just here for you.

238
00:13:16,644 --> 00:13:19,351
People can only see me when they smoke me.

239
00:13:19,352 --> 00:13:22,767
I got all the answers.
I can consult with people.

240
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:24,226
Socrates, Nietzsche,

241
00:13:24,227 --> 00:13:25,975
even the old dude who made this test.

242
00:13:25,976 --> 00:13:27,643
- That's bullshit.
- I bullshit you not.

243
00:13:27,644 --> 00:13:29,434
Remember, I told you I have your back...

244
00:13:29,435 --> 00:13:31,559
even if I got hit by a bus.

245
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,477
Matter of fact, your ass didn't
even get hit by a bus.

246
00:13:38,768 --> 00:13:40,184
I made it!

247
00:13:40,185 --> 00:13:43,768
I can't feel my legs, but I'm alive!

248
00:13:51,352 --> 00:13:53,767
- And you predicted that shit.
- Yeah.

249
00:13:53,768 --> 00:13:55,934
So what are you doing here?

250
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:58,434
Are you going to hook me up
with a chick with a no-gag reflex?

251
00:13:58,435 --> 00:14:01,184
Even better.
I'm going to be in there with you.

252
00:14:01,185 --> 00:14:04,560
By the time I'm done with you, every
college in the country will be knocking.

253
00:14:07,685 --> 00:14:10,892
Shit.
Man, I must not be high enough.

254
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:12,518
He a ghost, man.

255
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,892
Cool. That explains everything.

256
00:14:14,893 --> 00:14:18,892
I'm up here trying to put
my fucking hand through...

257
00:14:18,893 --> 00:14:22,767
We've never had anybody,
let alone two people

258
00:14:22,768 --> 00:14:24,601
get a perfect score.

259
00:14:24,602 --> 00:14:27,142
We either have a one
in six billion phenomenon,

260
00:14:27,143 --> 00:14:29,226
or a cheat.

261
00:14:29,227 --> 00:14:32,309
- Damn! - It would've been impossible
for either of you to cheat.

262
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:35,142
You had two totally
different versions of the test.

263
00:14:35,143 --> 00:14:37,393
Congratulations.
These scores are going

264
00:14:37,394 --> 00:14:40,142
to get you into any college in the country.

265
00:14:40,143 --> 00:14:42,477
We still high on that Ivory?

266
00:14:49,143 --> 00:14:52,184
Cain, it's as simple as this.

267
00:14:52,185 --> 00:14:54,476
The trustees at the
university are riding my ass

268
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,934
about getting some color up at Harvard.

269
00:14:56,935 --> 00:14:59,309
- Excuse me?
- Ethnic diversity.

270
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,476
The trustees seem to think we need it.

271
00:15:01,477 --> 00:15:04,267
- How come we don't have more minorities?
- How should I know?

272
00:15:04,268 --> 00:15:07,184
If we don't do something soon,
I might get fired.

273
00:15:07,185 --> 00:15:09,975
What about Upchuck Amalu?
He's Eskimo.

274
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:12,767
Why isn't he considered as a minority?
And I brought him in.

275
00:15:12,768 --> 00:15:15,725
Yes, but it's breaking the bank
keeping his igloo frozen.

276
00:15:15,726 --> 00:15:18,643
Dean, what about those two guys
I read about from the Tri-states?

277
00:15:18,644 --> 00:15:21,601
They made perfect scores on their THCs.

278
00:15:21,602 --> 00:15:24,810
I saw those guys' pictures.
They looked like mug shots!

279
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:29,351
I don't care. I want them!

280
00:15:29,352 --> 00:15:31,518
At Reparations Technical Institute,

281
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,059
we offer a cornucopia of educational

282
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:37,567
and business opportunities for brothers
and sisters to pursue higher learning.

283
00:15:37,568 --> 00:15:38,869
- Read from the brochure.
- "Brothers, join us at

284
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,684
Reparations Technical Institute
and learn hatred for the white devil

285
00:15:41,685 --> 00:15:43,142
in a relaxed campus atmosphere,

286
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:45,059
- where classes range...
- From...

287
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,975
- "Hatred For The White Devil..."
- to...

288
00:15:46,976 --> 00:15:49,267
- "Advanced Hatred For The White Devil..."
- and...

289
00:15:49,268 --> 00:15:50,725
- "Volleyball."
- Next.

290
00:15:50,726 --> 00:15:53,267
You think you're all
hot tamales right now?

291
00:15:53,268 --> 00:15:55,518
Why don't you come
to the base and understand

292
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,351
what it's really like to be special?

293
00:15:57,352 --> 00:15:58,892
You work hard, you learn,

294
00:15:58,893 --> 00:16:01,559
and then you can build
refrigerators and such.

295
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,643
Next!

296
00:16:02,644 --> 00:16:04,601
Taking a vow of celibacy...

297
00:16:04,602 --> 00:16:06,059
- Next.
- ...frees your mind...

298
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,101
- Next.
- ...and your body.

299
00:16:07,102 --> 00:16:08,309
Next!

300
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,309
Harvard?!

301
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,559
Ain't it a lot of richy people up there?

302
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,518
Shit, I got to roll up that joint, dog.

303
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,725
With test scores like these
you can roll up any joint you want.

304
00:16:18,726 --> 00:16:21,059
But Harvard, gentlemen,
is not just any joint.

305
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,393
- It's an institution.
- All I want to do is develop my herbal

306
00:16:24,394 --> 00:16:27,685
in a real lab, and get some head
while I'm doing it.

307
00:16:30,102 --> 00:16:32,393
Well, we have the finest
Botany department in the world

308
00:16:32,394 --> 00:16:35,017
and a quality of life like no other.

309
00:16:35,018 --> 00:16:38,601
Music, artists, and the women...

310
00:16:38,602 --> 00:16:42,267
So, does it sound tempting?
Ivy league atmosphere?

311
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:45,309
A place where you can
really grow academically?

312
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:48,767
- Sure, I'll fucks with ya.
- I'll fucks with you, too.

313
00:16:48,768 --> 00:16:51,017
- Is that good?
- Yes, that's a yes.

314
00:16:51,018 --> 00:16:52,768
Then we'll fox with each other.

315
00:17:04,768 --> 00:17:07,393
- Damn.
- Damn.

316
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:10,725
Them hos look like
they still in high school.

317
00:17:10,726 --> 00:17:14,017
If there's grass on the infield, play ball.

318
00:17:14,018 --> 00:17:16,601
Where the fuck is orientation at, anyway?

319
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:20,142
Damn.

320
00:17:20,143 --> 00:17:22,310
Hey!

321
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,976
- What the fuck was that?
- Je-sus!

322
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:31,142
If I could pull off six years
out of community college,

323
00:17:31,143 --> 00:17:34,143
I know I could get a least
12 years up in this motherfucker.

324
00:17:35,726 --> 00:17:37,975
How much of that Ivory we got, anyway?

325
00:17:37,976 --> 00:17:40,767
We limited, all right? So we're
going to have to split this shit up.

326
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,892
You know what I'm saying?
We only blaze at test times.

327
00:17:43,893 --> 00:17:47,143
- What, no wake and bake?
- I got other stuff for that.

328
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:53,725
Bart, remember those
artifacts I found this summer?

329
00:17:53,726 --> 00:17:56,351
I was right!
They are Ben Franklin's!

330
00:17:56,352 --> 00:17:59,518
Great. Did you figure out
where you want to eat dinner tonight?

331
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:03,017
Dinner?
Bart, some of these things are...

332
00:18:03,018 --> 00:18:04,892
they look like earlier inventions.

333
00:18:04,893 --> 00:18:07,184
And if I can discover what these are,

334
00:18:07,185 --> 00:18:09,767
it could be the greatest find
of anyone attending Harvard.

335
00:18:09,768 --> 00:18:13,393
I loves Ben Franklin, girl,
and I could listen to you

336
00:18:13,394 --> 00:18:17,393
talk about his stinking ass all day long.

337
00:18:17,394 --> 00:18:21,643
- Excuse me?
- Do anybody know where the financial aid office is?

338
00:18:21,644 --> 00:18:23,809
Well, my man, let me think.

339
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:26,892
See that statue right there?
It's beautiful, isn't it?

340
00:18:26,893 --> 00:18:29,809
That statue is in the likeness
of my great grandaddy Dooster.

341
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:32,476
So I'm guessing that
would be the Dooster house.

342
00:18:32,477 --> 00:18:36,393
The financial aid office.
Gee, I don't think

343
00:18:36,394 --> 00:18:39,226
I've ever met anyone who
actually needed to go there.

344
00:18:39,227 --> 00:18:41,559
All we did was come over
and ask for directions.

345
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,559
If we came over here and asked
if anybody needed their ass kicked,

346
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,725
you wouldn't sound
so fucking smart, would you?

347
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:50,393
My bad, bro'. We got off on the wrong foot.
Let's start over.

348
00:18:50,394 --> 00:18:52,476
- I'm Bart.
- I'm Jamal.

349
00:18:52,477 --> 00:18:55,518
My friend, this is crew,
but don't even think about it.

350
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:58,101
You don't look like
you could hang, Jermaine.

351
00:18:58,102 --> 00:19:00,975
The name's Jamal,
and I'll fuck your crew up.

352
00:19:00,976 --> 00:19:03,059
Who are they?
Who are they, goddamn it?

353
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,559
It's rowing, Jimmy-Jam.

354
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,351
Well, Bart-Fart, you got skills in it?

355
00:19:07,352 --> 00:19:09,267
Yeah, I'm captain of the team.

356
00:19:09,268 --> 00:19:11,850
- If you can do it, I can do it, sucker.
- That's right.

357
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:14,809
This isn't basketball, J-Rock.

358
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,892
I trained all year round for three seasons

359
00:19:16,893 --> 00:19:18,767
to make number one in single sculls.

360
00:19:18,768 --> 00:19:21,892
You about to be number two,
because I'm signing up, buddy.

361
00:19:21,893 --> 00:19:24,017
Practice starts tomorrow, 6:00 am. A'ight?

362
00:19:24,018 --> 00:19:28,767
Fine. I don't mind cutting
my evening short to be there.

363
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,601
As Dean of Freshmen,

364
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:33,309
I have welcomed students
from all over the world.

365
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:37,725
From Korea, from Rome, Istanbul.

366
00:19:37,726 --> 00:19:39,975
Students enter Harvard

367
00:19:39,976 --> 00:19:42,476
with a variety of goals.

368
00:19:42,477 --> 00:19:45,684
Excuse me?
Are we in the right place?

369
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:48,892
- Anyone? Anyone? Anyone?
- You? You?

370
00:19:48,893 --> 00:19:52,226
As I was saying,

371
00:19:52,227 --> 00:19:54,809
Harvard isn't for everyone.

372
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:57,809
Oh, shit.
We got a black man for a teacher.

373
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:00,059
That's what I'm talking 'bout!
What's up, bro'?

374
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,143
- We straight.
- Holler!

375
00:20:03,935 --> 00:20:06,476
- As I was saying...
- What's wrong with his ass?

376
00:20:06,477 --> 00:20:08,684
He probably been locked up
more times than me

377
00:20:08,685 --> 00:20:10,892
- and your ass put together.
- Get him.

378
00:20:10,893 --> 00:20:13,725
That old, green, Jimmy The Cricket
suit-wearing ass motherfucker.

379
00:20:13,726 --> 00:20:14,601
Get him!

380
00:20:14,622 --> 00:20:17,226
Old, short, Colin Powell
haircut-having motherfucker.

381
00:20:17,227 --> 00:20:18,216
Get him!

382
00:20:18,237 --> 00:20:21,184
Angela Davis moustache
wearing-ass motherfucker.

383
00:20:21,185 --> 00:20:23,892
You little Richard Pryor shortcut fade

384
00:20:23,893 --> 00:20:26,975
happening 'round the
sides wearing motherfucker!

385
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:30,892
You little Sammy Davis Award Junior Afro
haircut having-ass motherfucker!

386
00:20:30,893 --> 00:20:31,768
Get him!

387
00:20:31,789 --> 00:20:34,393
You little dynamite
disco daddy devastating.

388
00:20:34,394 --> 00:20:35,175
Get him!

389
00:20:35,196 --> 00:20:37,518
You little Don
Cornelius with a haircut...

390
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:41,393
Gentlemen, if you don't mind,
I'd like you to sit down.

391
00:20:41,394 --> 00:20:43,184
I would like to continue.

392
00:20:43,185 --> 00:20:47,559
- Excuse me.
- 'Scuse me.

393
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,226
Watch your toes. Watch the corns.

394
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:51,850
Excuse me.

395
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:55,393
Thank you for your...
entertaining anecdotes.

396
00:20:55,394 --> 00:21:00,017
We here at Harvard are rooted in tradition.

397
00:21:00,018 --> 00:21:02,351
Fuck is this?

398
00:21:02,352 --> 00:21:04,434
That's toilet water.

399
00:21:04,435 --> 00:21:07,184
It's a part of my pledge.
Do you guys mind?

400
00:21:07,185 --> 00:21:09,684
No. But do you mind talking that way,

401
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,975
because your breath smell
like straight ass-crack, bro'.

402
00:21:11,976 --> 00:21:15,142
Isn't there a hip-hop convention
you two should be at?

403
00:21:15,143 --> 00:21:16,684
- Ooooh.
- Oooh.

404
00:21:16,685 --> 00:21:19,684
- Shark has fangs.
- Word. Go easy on him.

405
00:21:19,685 --> 00:21:23,142
We probably the only blackheads he's seen
since he looked in the mirror.

406
00:21:23,143 --> 00:21:25,559
Can you guys just show
a little respect? Jeez.

407
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,725
This class is fucking boring,
I'm out of here.

408
00:21:27,726 --> 00:21:29,850
Excuse me, did I hear you say something?

409
00:21:29,851 --> 00:21:31,602
With all due respect, sir, suck my dick.

410
00:21:33,227 --> 00:21:36,559
No, sir, I'm not saying anything.

411
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,518
- It's these guys.
- You're an asshole.

412
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:42,184
- Did you just call me an asshole?
- No, I said idiot.

413
00:21:42,185 --> 00:21:44,975
- An idiot?!
- No, sir! No, sir!

414
00:21:44,976 --> 00:21:47,725
- What did you say?
- I said this school has nice halls.

415
00:21:47,726 --> 00:21:48,618
This is not funny.

416
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:50,893
You couldn't teach your
way out of kindergarten class.

417
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:53,476
I think we've had enough
interruptions for today.

418
00:21:53,477 --> 00:21:56,227
- I think you should leave.
- Sir.

419
00:21:57,685 --> 00:22:00,102
This would never have
happened if I were black.

420
00:22:06,268 --> 00:22:08,226
Better pull back on those pedals, boy.

421
00:22:08,227 --> 00:22:11,434
- Why?
- Maximum speed on campus is 15 MPHs.

422
00:22:11,435 --> 00:22:13,268
MPHs?

423
00:22:14,394 --> 00:22:17,101
50 bucks? Man, I can't pay this.

424
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,725
- Well...
- This isn't even a real ticket.

425
00:22:19,726 --> 00:22:22,017
It's a student citation.
See, I'm a volunteer.

426
00:22:22,018 --> 00:22:24,559
You need to pay that by Friday at fi...

427
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,850
- That was uncalled for.
- Eat me.

428
00:22:27,851 --> 00:22:31,435
- You just earned another citation.
- Fuck off!

429
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:36,643
Well, well, well.

430
00:22:36,644 --> 00:22:39,226
Look who we have here.

431
00:22:39,227 --> 00:22:41,142
Damn, this bike phat as hell.

432
00:22:41,143 --> 00:22:43,725
Hey, don't touch. Okay, all right.

433
00:22:43,726 --> 00:22:46,017
Leave the bike alone.
Did you just call me fat?

434
00:22:46,018 --> 00:22:48,018
And what is that stench?

435
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:51,809
That's my cologne.
Cannabi For Men.

436
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:54,559
I don't know what that is.
Forewarning, gentlemen.

437
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,892
You better watch your
mouths and your behinds.

438
00:22:56,893 --> 00:23:00,017
I'm looking for the Ecstasy.
I'm looking for the pot.

439
00:23:00,018 --> 00:23:02,850
Yeah. I'm looking for those 'shrooms.

440
00:23:02,851 --> 00:23:05,643
- We looking for that shit, too!
- Hell yeah.

441
00:23:05,644 --> 00:23:08,725
- What are you talking about?
- Same thing you talking about.

442
00:23:08,726 --> 00:23:11,643
- What are we talking about?
- Look, Gerald,

443
00:23:11,644 --> 00:23:14,975
either you're holding, or you can get on
your roadster and move the fuck on.

444
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:17,393
It's Volunteer Officer Picklestein.

445
00:23:17,394 --> 00:23:19,850
And I am watching you.
I'm watching you.

446
00:23:19,851 --> 00:23:21,810
Like a hawk.

447
00:23:22,644 --> 00:23:24,892
Like a hawk!

448
00:23:24,893 --> 00:23:27,519
Somebody needs a hug.

449
00:23:30,602 --> 00:23:34,185
Don't worry, baby,
you can suck my dick after class.

450
00:23:35,726 --> 00:23:37,767
She wants me.

451
00:23:37,768 --> 00:23:40,850
Welcome to Lovell House.
You look funky fresh.

452
00:23:40,851 --> 00:23:44,851
And funky fresh always
likes funky fresh women.

453
00:23:46,268 --> 00:23:50,226
"Amir, professional student,
resident advisor for you."

454
00:23:50,227 --> 00:23:51,643
And professional player.

455
00:23:51,644 --> 00:23:54,184
So what's mine is yours,
and what's yours...

456
00:23:54,185 --> 00:23:55,684
I've probably already had.

457
00:23:55,685 --> 00:23:59,059
You and you and me, we're the same.

458
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,518
Africa tan.

459
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:03,059
The original man was like us, man.

460
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,850
Whatever, nigger.

461
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:07,767
I believe in the Fly Club
and its traditions and its ideals.

462
00:24:07,768 --> 00:24:09,975
I believe in the Fly... Excuse me?

463
00:24:09,976 --> 00:24:12,309
Do you have to play that so loud?
I'm studying my pledge book.

464
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,767
This Niggaz With Attitude.

465
00:24:14,768 --> 00:24:18,059
If you smart, you tell people you love NWA.

466
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,060
They think you cool.

467
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,767
Why do you wear smelly eggs?

468
00:24:24,768 --> 00:24:27,101
These eggs are part of my pledging.

469
00:24:27,102 --> 00:24:29,892
I am getting thousands of
lifetime connections here.

470
00:24:29,893 --> 00:24:31,767
I'm going to be a part of a fraternity.

471
00:24:31,768 --> 00:24:33,101
- Hey!
- Hey!

472
00:24:33,102 --> 00:24:34,559
Whassup, whassup?

473
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,227
- Oh god.
- One glove, my brothers!

474
00:24:39,268 --> 00:24:42,059
I am Tuan, child prodigy.

475
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,394
I'm Jamal, a pothead.

476
00:24:45,227 --> 00:24:47,725
Silas, entre-po-negro.

477
00:24:47,726 --> 00:24:51,601
Jamal! Fresh gear, man!

478
00:24:51,602 --> 00:24:53,184
- You like?
- Yeah!

479
00:24:53,185 --> 00:24:55,934
I designed it myself.
I call it Bufu.

480
00:24:55,935 --> 00:24:58,601
- Bufu?
- No, not you two.

481
00:24:58,602 --> 00:25:00,059
Please.

482
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,934
Fake-ass Paul Bunyan plaid,
pussy shirt wearing...

483
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:05,601
Man, I'll fuck your ass up.
Shut up.

484
00:25:05,602 --> 00:25:07,101
Okay, but if you two are our roommates,

485
00:25:07,102 --> 00:25:09,518
who's that?

486
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:12,102
That's "I Need Money." Goddamn.

487
00:25:14,185 --> 00:25:16,435
Okay, but what's his name?

488
00:25:17,394 --> 00:25:20,768
I Need Money.

489
00:25:23,102 --> 00:25:24,476
Doesn't talk, how come he?

490
00:25:24,477 --> 00:25:27,017
I need money? He's a mute.

491
00:25:27,018 --> 00:25:29,643
When we first hooked up,
he wrote on a slip of paper,

492
00:25:29,644 --> 00:25:31,393
"I need money."

493
00:25:31,394 --> 00:25:33,809
I said, "Shit, me too."

494
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:36,309
And we started making
it together after that.

495
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:39,226
- Where he staying?
- Harvard.

496
00:25:39,227 --> 00:25:42,643
Lovell House. Second floor,

497
00:25:42,644 --> 00:25:44,767
right on the couch.

498
00:25:44,768 --> 00:25:47,559
He's smoking in our room.
That's not legal.

499
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:51,142
Just be cool, and you might have
some fun this semester.

500
00:25:51,143 --> 00:25:53,934
- Stupid.
- Wee.

501
00:25:53,935 --> 00:25:57,309
NWA? Kid, what you know about that?

502
00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:00,143
Yeah, I love Niggaz With Attitude.

503
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,476
Nobody, I repeat nobody,

504
00:26:04,477 --> 00:26:06,518
drops the N-bomb up in here.

505
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:08,601
- Nobody.
- That go for you, too.

506
00:26:08,602 --> 00:26:11,767
Hey, I am down with you, man.

507
00:26:11,768 --> 00:26:15,309
You East coast. I Far East coast.

508
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:17,518
I'm from Wisconsin.

509
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:19,725
Fresh and funky.

510
00:26:19,726 --> 00:26:21,892
Dean Cain wants to see you in his office.

511
00:26:21,893 --> 00:26:23,810
Don't be late.

512
00:26:25,477 --> 00:26:27,643
Gentlemen, this institution

513
00:26:27,644 --> 00:26:31,351
has graduated countless Fortune 500 CEOs.

514
00:26:31,352 --> 00:26:34,559
41 Nobel laureates, and six Presidents.

515
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,017
Hey, Dean, where's all the fly-ass women

516
00:26:37,018 --> 00:26:39,184
the Chancellor was talking about?

517
00:26:39,185 --> 00:26:42,476
So far, I only seen some stuck-up,

518
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:44,685
nerdy-ass looking women out.

519
00:26:56,227 --> 00:26:59,351
You were dropping Cheetos

520
00:26:59,352 --> 00:27:01,684
on an original 18th century

521
00:27:01,685 --> 00:27:03,226
hand woven tapestry!

522
00:27:03,227 --> 00:27:05,434
You mean this carpet?

523
00:27:05,435 --> 00:27:08,226
This is out of my personal collection.

524
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:10,809
I got this in my travels to Nepal!

525
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:12,434
I know the bitch that makes these rugs.

526
00:27:12,435 --> 00:27:14,725
- You know Wynena...
- I remember that bitch.

527
00:27:14,726 --> 00:27:16,725
It means the world to me.

528
00:27:16,726 --> 00:27:19,059
Now, as I was saying,

529
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:22,434
here at Harvard,
we have very high standards.

530
00:27:22,435 --> 00:27:24,892
Any student on a scholarship

531
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:28,101
must maintain at least a 2.0 average

532
00:27:28,102 --> 00:27:29,684
or you will be expelled.

533
00:27:29,685 --> 00:27:32,226
It's good to know we have
the support of the faculty.

534
00:27:32,227 --> 00:27:35,267
And don't you worry.
Me and Jamal here?

535
00:27:35,268 --> 00:27:37,975
- We're all about good grades.
- Is that right, Mr. King?

536
00:27:37,976 --> 00:27:42,268
Hell motherf...
I mean, yes, sir, Dean Cain, sir.

537
00:28:02,227 --> 00:28:05,309
How is carbon dioxide changed into oxygen?

538
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:08,102
- Plants, dick!
- Guys!

539
00:28:10,185 --> 00:28:12,767
Jamal, Jamal, Jamal.

540
00:28:12,768 --> 00:28:15,060
Sleepyhead, wake up.

541
00:28:20,477 --> 00:28:22,810
I got something for your ass.

542
00:29:09,976 --> 00:29:13,685
Come on, gentlemen! Pick it up if
you want to be part of this squad!

543
00:29:15,726 --> 00:29:17,685
Taxi!

544
00:29:21,143 --> 00:29:23,809
Woo, what took you all guys so long?

545
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:27,059
Coach,
I've not lost an oar run in three years.

546
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,767
- I'm wondering if this guy cheated.
- Cheated?

547
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,184
Man, fuck you!

548
00:29:31,185 --> 00:29:33,975
Why is fucking Dick
Butt-kiss always riding me?

549
00:29:33,976 --> 00:29:37,684
Dick Butt-kiss? Did you hear that,
Coach? He's cursing!

550
00:29:37,685 --> 00:29:40,351
Bart, I think you better
go open up the boathouse.

551
00:29:40,352 --> 00:29:41,809
- But Coach!
- Bart!

552
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,726
I don't think you want to see this.

553
00:29:44,726 --> 00:29:46,643
You... here.

554
00:29:46,644 --> 00:29:48,393
Come here.

555
00:29:48,394 --> 00:29:50,227
Come here.

556
00:29:52,435 --> 00:29:55,434
Nice comeback on the Dick Butt-kiss.

557
00:29:55,435 --> 00:29:57,559
I wish I could've said that.

558
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,518
His parents have been driving me crazy,

559
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:02,017
making my life a misery for years.

560
00:30:02,018 --> 00:30:04,725
But they give lots of money. I have
to go to those lousy cocktail parties.

561
00:30:04,726 --> 00:30:07,434
She has lousy perfume
and he has a lousy toupee.

562
00:30:07,435 --> 00:30:10,476
You keep throwing zingers to this jerk-off,

563
00:30:10,477 --> 00:30:12,560
and you're going to make the team, son.

564
00:30:14,227 --> 00:30:16,725
And let that be a lesson to you!
This is the last time!

565
00:30:16,726 --> 00:30:19,226
All right, rookies! Push-ups!

566
00:30:19,227 --> 00:30:20,768
Get down!

567
00:30:22,477 --> 00:30:25,393
What's up with the fast stroll?

568
00:30:25,394 --> 00:30:28,017
- Can I holler?
- Hi.

569
00:30:28,018 --> 00:30:31,809
The role played by the African-Americans

570
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:33,434
in the history of this country

571
00:30:33,435 --> 00:30:36,059
has been largely unnoticed.

572
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,434
Of course, history is

573
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:39,767
the record of an account of the past.

574
00:30:39,768 --> 00:30:43,309
But the issue here is,
who is recording the account?

575
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:47,101
If it's Snowflake, Whitey, Paleface,

576
00:30:47,102 --> 00:30:48,767
Peckerwoods, Cracker...

577
00:30:48,768 --> 00:30:51,850
we got Cleopatra looking
like Elizabeth Taylor.

578
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:54,434
Jesus looks like a hippie in a dashiki.

579
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:56,601
But if it's one of my proud black people

580
00:30:56,602 --> 00:30:58,351
that's doing the
recording of the account...

581
00:30:58,352 --> 00:30:59,518
Silas!

582
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,226
We might have Moses looking like

583
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:04,809
this fine black man right here.

584
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:08,518
I'm sore as a motherfucker.

585
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:10,767
Who invented the air conditioner?

586
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:12,267
A black man.

587
00:31:12,268 --> 00:31:13,643
What's up, dogs?

588
00:31:13,644 --> 00:31:16,934
Son, I'm sore as a bitch in heat.

589
00:31:16,935 --> 00:31:19,393
And you know what else?
I'm going to have

590
00:31:19,394 --> 00:31:21,434
to knock that Bart character the fuck out.

591
00:31:21,435 --> 00:31:23,850
Once again, a black man.

592
00:31:23,851 --> 00:31:26,017
Can't this wait till after class?

593
00:31:26,018 --> 00:31:29,101
You supposed to be in here, anyway.
This is black history.

594
00:31:29,102 --> 00:31:32,309
Black history?
It look like all the black students

595
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:34,309
that was in here are history.

596
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,975
Are you telling me to ""?

597
00:31:36,976 --> 00:31:39,017
See what I mean? Fuck history.

598
00:31:39,018 --> 00:31:42,267
- That's right. Fuck history.
- Yeah, fuck history.

599
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:44,767
Mr. Moses, I expect you'll be
ready for your quiz tomorrow?

600
00:31:44,768 --> 00:31:48,059
Quiz my ass.
A white man teaching black history, anyway.

601
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:52,601
That's some bullshit. I'm going
to lunch and take a nice long shit.

602
00:31:52,602 --> 00:31:54,934
That's the kind of attitude I like to hear.

603
00:31:54,935 --> 00:31:57,559
And where are you going?

604
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:01,351
We didn't land on Plymouth Rock.
Plymouth Rock landed on us.

605
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:04,434
All right! Malcolm X!

606
00:32:04,435 --> 00:32:06,434
I'm glad someone's
appreciating the knowledge

607
00:32:06,435 --> 00:32:08,601
I'm trying to drop on you today.

608
00:32:08,602 --> 00:32:10,601
Why don't you two walk out
in protest with your brothers?

609
00:32:10,602 --> 00:32:13,017
Walk out on me.
What are you doing sitting there?

610
00:32:13,018 --> 00:32:16,434
You look like Whitey, like
a couple of goddamn Uncle Toms.

611
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:18,351
Walk on out! That's right!

612
00:32:18,352 --> 00:32:20,351
Get up and move!
You should lynch me!

613
00:32:20,352 --> 00:32:22,850
Lynch me for what my people
have done to your people.

614
00:32:22,851 --> 00:32:26,060
Move on up! Move on up!

615
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,892
Come on.

616
00:32:38,893 --> 00:32:40,851
Go, go, go, go.

617
00:32:42,268 --> 00:32:44,227
Hey, what's up?

618
00:32:45,102 --> 00:32:47,310
Stop!

619
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:54,101
- What's going on here?
- They stole my baby!

620
00:32:54,102 --> 00:32:58,226
Stop! Bring my baby back!

621
00:32:58,227 --> 00:32:59,767
Not the hill, not the hill!

622
00:32:59,768 --> 00:33:03,143
Oh, god, no!
Baby, I almost got you!

623
00:33:09,602 --> 00:33:11,809
No! Oh my god!

624
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:14,434
My wheel!

625
00:33:14,435 --> 00:33:16,768
My horn!

626
00:33:18,268 --> 00:33:21,559
Hey, you! Where's Elm and Third?

627
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,768
What?

628
00:33:31,102 --> 00:33:32,768
That's not yours!

629
00:33:34,268 --> 00:33:38,268
No, don't put him in... my baby!

630
00:33:42,976 --> 00:33:45,767
Can anyone tell me the name of this plant?

631
00:33:45,768 --> 00:33:47,725
Bart?

632
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:50,142
Yeah, it's a hanging rubber plant.

633
00:33:50,143 --> 00:33:53,767
It's indigenous to the wet drylands
of the northern hemisphere.

634
00:33:53,768 --> 00:33:56,476
Yeah right, Bart.
Would you bet money on that?

635
00:33:56,477 --> 00:33:59,101
Or is that like below
the Dooster principle?

636
00:33:59,102 --> 00:34:01,267
Yeah, I'll bet on it.
How 'bout an SUV?

637
00:34:01,268 --> 00:34:02,643
I got three of 'em.

638
00:34:02,644 --> 00:34:05,975
And the survey says, you lose.

639
00:34:05,976 --> 00:34:08,142
It's a neem plant, Professor.

640
00:34:08,143 --> 00:34:09,767
Oui. Yes.

641
00:34:09,768 --> 00:34:11,975
But how did you know that, Silas?

642
00:34:11,976 --> 00:34:14,476
I had this nasty-ass rash once.

643
00:34:14,477 --> 00:34:16,476
I put a little bit of neem plant on it,

644
00:34:16,477 --> 00:34:18,142
it cleared it up in an hour.
I even smoked it before.

645
00:34:18,143 --> 00:34:20,518
That figures.

646
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:22,309
One thing it doesn't cure, though...

647
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,101
being a spoiled little bitch.

648
00:34:24,102 --> 00:34:27,643
I'd like you all to do an
experiment on a plant.

649
00:34:27,644 --> 00:34:31,059
Something that... may benefit mankind.

650
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,934
And if you devise something groundbreaking,

651
00:34:33,935 --> 00:34:37,643
I guarantee you an "A" in this course.

652
00:34:37,644 --> 00:34:40,226
Okay, class dismissed.
Good work, everyone.

653
00:34:40,227 --> 00:34:42,393
- Thank you.
- Nice. Keep up the good work.

654
00:34:42,394 --> 00:34:45,351
So, he likes plants, does he?

655
00:34:45,352 --> 00:34:47,226
I see still waters run deep.

656
00:34:47,227 --> 00:34:51,184
Please believe.
But wait till you see my presentation.

657
00:34:51,185 --> 00:34:52,601
You going to love me after that.

658
00:34:52,602 --> 00:34:55,351
Lauren, you might as well tell him now

659
00:34:55,352 --> 00:34:57,017
and get it over with.

660
00:34:57,018 --> 00:34:58,850
- What?
- You know,

661
00:34:58,851 --> 00:35:01,559
how you're starting to see Bart
for the shallow bastard he is,

662
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,017
and eventually you're going
to leave his ass for me.

663
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:06,519
Holler.

664
00:35:12,102 --> 00:35:14,725
This semester in women's studies,

665
00:35:14,726 --> 00:35:17,809
we will discuss how women are
objectified in popular culture

666
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:19,559
while the masculine bastards

667
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,267
exploit women's ideas for great profit,

668
00:35:22,268 --> 00:35:24,059
then take all the credit.

669
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:27,059
Jamal?

670
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,518
You have the most amazing...

671
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:31,975
penis.

672
00:35:31,976 --> 00:35:33,726
Yes, I do.

673
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,476
- Hell yeah.
- Aaah.

674
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,934
So you're playing grabby-ass again?

675
00:35:47,935 --> 00:35:51,351
- Ma?
- Did you wash your ass today?

676
00:35:51,352 --> 00:35:54,102
Damn, Ma! Stop, Ma! Stop!

677
00:36:00,268 --> 00:36:03,601
- You high yet?
- I don't know. Maybe not high enough.

678
00:36:03,602 --> 00:36:06,102
Where the hell is he?

679
00:36:06,893 --> 00:36:09,101
Maybe I ain't hit it hard enough.

680
00:36:09,102 --> 00:36:11,768
What are you doing?
Dropping your kids off at the pool?

681
00:36:13,726 --> 00:36:15,643
Oh, shit.

682
00:36:15,644 --> 00:36:18,101
What's up, J? Give me five.

683
00:36:18,102 --> 00:36:19,767
I hate it when you do that.

684
00:36:19,768 --> 00:36:21,434
I love doing that.
That shit is funny.

685
00:36:21,435 --> 00:36:23,142
What took you so long?

686
00:36:23,143 --> 00:36:25,934
Biggie and Pac, man.
They throwing a party.

687
00:36:25,935 --> 00:36:27,643
Open bar all night!

688
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:32,017
Everything was cool till
Marvin Gaye came in there tripping.

689
00:36:32,018 --> 00:36:34,351
- Marvin Gaye?
- Yeah.

690
00:36:34,352 --> 00:36:37,725
- We got a test in about five minutes.
- Word.

691
00:36:37,726 --> 00:36:39,975
What that got to do with me?
I know you ready.

692
00:36:39,976 --> 00:36:42,684
- I know you studied for it.
- Ready? We ain't studied...

693
00:36:42,685 --> 00:36:43,549
Come on.

694
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:46,142
You got a golden opportunity
to make something of yourself.

695
00:36:46,143 --> 00:36:49,226
And you just throwing it away?
It's time for you to learn a lesson.

696
00:36:49,227 --> 00:36:51,351
- Come on, Ive.
- I'm out, man.

697
00:36:51,352 --> 00:36:53,476
Ive! Don't play! Ive!

698
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:56,934
- Talk to your boy.
- Why'd you tell him we ain't studied?

699
00:36:56,935 --> 00:36:59,643
- Damn all that!
- You should've thought of that before you...

700
00:36:59,644 --> 00:37:03,934
Whassup?!
I'm just fucking with you, man.

701
00:37:03,935 --> 00:37:06,559
- This is bullshit.
- This is some good shit, man.

702
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,684
You know you my boy.

703
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:11,643
"C," Silas.
Come on, man. The Portugese.

704
00:37:11,644 --> 00:37:14,351
1863. That's "B."

705
00:37:14,352 --> 00:37:16,725
J, what are you doing? 1961.

706
00:37:16,726 --> 00:37:19,518
- "B?"
- Trust me on this, I got all the answers.

707
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:21,518
You just told me that goddamn answer.

708
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:23,810
"A." French. That be the French.

709
00:37:36,185 --> 00:37:40,184
Goddamn virgins.
At least you all being entertained.

710
00:37:40,185 --> 00:37:43,559
I ain't seen a stitch of
pussy on this whole campus.

711
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,685
The chickens are not clucking around here.

712
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,559
You've come to the right place.

713
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,892
I've been an undergrad for 12 years.

714
00:37:53,893 --> 00:37:57,518
I know everything there is
to know about Ivy League women.

715
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:59,059
12 years?

716
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:01,975
Damn, kid.
Your people paying for all this shit?

717
00:38:01,976 --> 00:38:03,850
A drop in the bucket, sucka.

718
00:38:03,851 --> 00:38:06,434
I remain here solely for the purpose

719
00:38:06,435 --> 00:38:09,226
of hooking up with Harvard women.

720
00:38:09,227 --> 00:38:11,725
Short ones, tall ones,

721
00:38:11,726 --> 00:38:13,643
skinny ones, chunky ones.

722
00:38:13,644 --> 00:38:16,184
I love me a fat chick, man.

723
00:38:16,185 --> 00:38:18,809
More cushion for the pushin'.

724
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:22,892
Yes. I want to boldly go
where no man has gone before.

725
00:38:22,893 --> 00:38:24,559
I'm an explorer.

726
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,684
I see you are very much liking
to explore STDs also, my friend.

727
00:38:28,685 --> 00:38:31,934
That shit on your lip
got some shit on its lip.

728
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:33,975
Is that why no puff-puff?

729
00:38:33,976 --> 00:38:35,684
Pass the dutchie, my friends.

730
00:38:35,685 --> 00:38:38,142
This is nothing.
I cut myself shaving.

731
00:38:38,143 --> 00:38:39,476
Yeah, whatever.

732
00:38:39,477 --> 00:38:41,934
We need to start importing some hos.

733
00:38:41,935 --> 00:38:45,059
Molly, get in here, you have to see this!

734
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:49,476
My, look at those muscles.

735
00:38:49,477 --> 00:38:52,267
- He is quite attractive.
- Indeed.

736
00:38:52,268 --> 00:38:54,768
I think there's some freak in those geeks.

737
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:58,518
- Yeah.
- Here you go.

738
00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:02,101
Don't get the wrong idea.

739
00:39:02,102 --> 00:39:05,267
We've never done anything like this before.
We're virgins.

740
00:39:05,268 --> 00:39:06,809
Virgins?

741
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:09,601
- No, you're not.
- Yes, we are.

742
00:39:09,602 --> 00:39:10,892
- Nah, nah.
- Yes.

743
00:39:10,893 --> 00:39:14,351
No, no, no.

744
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,184
Yes, yes, yes.

745
00:39:16,185 --> 00:39:17,975
No, no, no.

746
00:39:17,976 --> 00:39:20,227
Yes, yes, yes!

747
00:39:29,851 --> 00:39:32,227
Bro', you got change for a $20?

748
00:39:45,143 --> 00:39:48,975
- Histo-ray!
- Got a "A plus," my nigger.

749
00:39:48,976 --> 00:39:52,810
Oooh. Who is that?

750
00:39:53,726 --> 00:39:55,767
That is all me, G.

751
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,809
That's the Vice President's daughter.

752
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:00,142
As in Vice President of the United States.

753
00:40:00,143 --> 00:40:02,059
What? Jamal, you don't want that.

754
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,684
Them girls only know three words...

755
00:40:03,685 --> 00:40:05,434
stop, no, and don't.

756
00:40:05,435 --> 00:40:07,767
My brother.
You got those words backwards.

757
00:40:07,768 --> 00:40:10,601
They always tell me, "No, don't stop."

758
00:40:10,602 --> 00:40:14,518
- Excuse me.
- Player, player.

759
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:18,851
Whee,
I'm taking this ass up right here. Shit.

760
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:24,018
Damn!

761
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:48,684
Sorry, sir, Jaime isn't accepting
any male callers at this time.

762
00:40:48,685 --> 00:40:51,059
I ain't calling. I'm right here.

763
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,809
Cedric, step aside.

764
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:56,726
Whee!

765
00:40:58,018 --> 00:41:00,226
- What's your name?
- I'm Jamal.

766
00:41:00,227 --> 00:41:02,059
You ever been arrested, Jamal?

767
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,850
No.

768
00:41:03,851 --> 00:41:06,226
Ever busted up your mother's house,

769
00:41:06,227 --> 00:41:09,017
- then slapped her when she asked you about it?
- Hell no. You crazy?

770
00:41:09,018 --> 00:41:11,351
You ain't my type.

771
00:41:11,352 --> 00:41:13,102
Wait a minute, wait, wait!

772
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:17,934
I once got arrested for
stealing a car one time.

773
00:41:17,935 --> 00:41:20,101
But my mother dropped the charges.

774
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:24,394
It's not a felony,
but maybe we can work with that.

775
00:41:34,435 --> 00:41:35,934
Shit, I didn't mean to scare you.

776
00:41:35,935 --> 00:41:37,684
- I'm...
- Can I come in?

777
00:41:37,685 --> 00:41:39,476
Sure, come on in.

778
00:41:39,477 --> 00:41:43,476
Let me... move my things.

779
00:41:43,477 --> 00:41:45,725
There you go. You can sit there.

780
00:41:45,726 --> 00:41:48,768
Thank you. How very thoughtful.

781
00:41:50,602 --> 00:41:52,934
You'll have to pardon my dust.

782
00:41:52,935 --> 00:41:56,643
I've got a lot of artifacts
and delicate things down here.

783
00:41:56,644 --> 00:41:59,101
What's this shit?

784
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:01,267
- Looks old.
- It is old.

785
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:03,184
It's over 200 years old.

786
00:42:03,185 --> 00:42:05,809
I, sort of discovered it.

787
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:08,184
You discovered all this crazy shit.

788
00:42:08,185 --> 00:42:10,143
You're a straight up genius, girl.

789
00:42:12,602 --> 00:42:14,643
Well, I don't know about all that.

790
00:42:14,644 --> 00:42:17,017
I do know it's Ben Franklin's.

791
00:42:17,018 --> 00:42:18,559
I just don't know what it is.

792
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,559
But I was thinking that it could be

793
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,309
like this old revolutionary cannon.

794
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:25,518
Or a telescope. Or...

795
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:28,809
Whatever it is, this shit is hot.

796
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:30,393
Let me ask you something.

797
00:42:30,394 --> 00:42:32,267
Yeah.

798
00:42:32,268 --> 00:42:34,934
How'd you hook up with that Bart dude?

799
00:42:34,935 --> 00:42:37,518
I've known Bart all my life.

800
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:40,142
And if it weren't for his family,

801
00:42:40,143 --> 00:42:41,850
I probably wouldn't be here.

802
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:44,644
Well, isn't that sweet.

803
00:42:52,018 --> 00:42:54,101
Aha!

804
00:42:54,102 --> 00:42:56,184
Bart, honey. Sweetie.

805
00:42:56,185 --> 00:42:57,643
You are just in time

806
00:42:57,644 --> 00:43:00,351
because I've just finished studying.

807
00:43:00,352 --> 00:43:02,351
- Studying?
- Yeah.

808
00:43:02,352 --> 00:43:04,351
I didn't know the two of you
were studying in here...

809
00:43:04,352 --> 00:43:06,017
alone...

810
00:43:06,018 --> 00:43:07,643
with the lights dim...

811
00:43:07,644 --> 00:43:09,975
drinking beer?!

812
00:43:09,976 --> 00:43:12,643
Look Silas, I know what you're
trying to do, okay?

813
00:43:12,644 --> 00:43:14,018
You're trying to frick her.

814
00:43:16,185 --> 00:43:18,559
Whatever, Bartkowski. Listen,

815
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,143
I was just admiring your girl's thing.

816
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,975
Well, I guess I should say thanks.

817
00:43:25,976 --> 00:43:27,518
This is a part of history, man.

818
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:29,017
Your girl is doing something I think

819
00:43:29,018 --> 00:43:32,101
- you need to recognize.
- Yeah. So?

820
00:43:32,102 --> 00:43:33,767
Listen, I'm out.

821
00:43:33,768 --> 00:43:36,892
Maybe next time I'll get to study with you.

822
00:43:36,893 --> 00:43:37,664
Peace.

823
00:43:37,685 --> 00:43:39,975
Peace is meant to
explain a state of tranquility.

824
00:43:39,976 --> 00:43:42,476
Okay? So, why don't you try
thinking of another way

825
00:43:42,477 --> 00:43:45,309
to say goodbye now that
you're amongst civilized people.

826
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:47,059
Well, Mr. Civilized,

827
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:49,643
peace can also be used interjectionally

828
00:43:49,644 --> 00:43:52,725
as a request, greeting, or farewell.

829
00:43:52,726 --> 00:43:55,518
So,
try to find another way to be an asshole

830
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:57,892
if you don't know your grammar, that is.

831
00:43:57,893 --> 00:43:59,394
Peace.

832
00:44:01,893 --> 00:44:04,226
Okay, Bart!

833
00:44:04,227 --> 00:44:06,394
God, can I get my stuff?

834
00:44:07,435 --> 00:44:09,227
Sheesh.

835
00:44:10,227 --> 00:44:12,393
Yes.

836
00:44:12,394 --> 00:44:14,767
It was near the medical library.

837
00:44:14,768 --> 00:44:16,767
I think they said it was one of those,

838
00:44:16,768 --> 00:44:20,434
tick-tocky, blow-upy,
exploding thing... thingy,

839
00:44:20,435 --> 00:44:21,975
pipebomb thing... things.

840
00:44:21,976 --> 00:44:24,142
Yeah. Yeah.

841
00:44:24,143 --> 00:44:26,809
Thank you. You, too.

842
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:28,768
All righty. Bye.

843
00:44:35,394 --> 00:44:38,268
Dooster principle, my ass.

844
00:44:44,185 --> 00:44:47,102
Man, my grandmother
loved this shit in her garden.

845
00:44:52,602 --> 00:44:54,602
Lasso, boys.

846
00:44:57,851 --> 00:44:59,810
Yee-hah!

847
00:45:02,519 --> 00:45:04,644
Timber!

848
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:08,559
That statue is priceless.

849
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,309
It means everything to our family.

850
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:12,476
Will you stop your damn sniveling, son?

851
00:45:12,477 --> 00:45:14,142
Buck up, Bart.

852
00:45:14,143 --> 00:45:15,809
Buck up!

853
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:18,059
Do you think they gonna find out

854
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:19,309
we stole the Dooster statue?

855
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:21,101
Hell, no.

856
00:45:21,102 --> 00:45:23,017
Oh, my god! I knew it.

857
00:45:23,018 --> 00:45:24,601
You guys stole the Dooster.

858
00:45:24,602 --> 00:45:25,975
They do what?

859
00:45:25,976 --> 00:45:27,518
Fellas, I think it's time

860
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:28,975
we all sat down and kicked it.

861
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,476
No, no. I'm not kicking anything.

862
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:32,101
I have a pledge meeting to go to,

863
00:45:32,102 --> 00:45:33,975
and I still haven't greased myself up.

864
00:45:33,976 --> 00:45:36,142
God, I just don't get you guys.

865
00:45:36,143 --> 00:45:37,767
There's a lot of things in life

866
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:39,684
your ass just don't get.

867
00:45:39,685 --> 00:45:42,519
Yeah, like pussy and respect.

868
00:45:43,976 --> 00:45:45,851
I heard that.

869
00:45:49,893 --> 00:45:51,850
See, the system is geared

870
00:45:51,851 --> 00:45:55,101
to put most of the wealth
into the hands of a few.

871
00:45:55,102 --> 00:45:57,684
The rich weapons, poor schoolin'.

872
00:45:57,685 --> 00:45:59,725
Yeah, for sure, nigger.

873
00:45:59,726 --> 00:46:02,309
- Yeah, for sure.
- Y'all don't know shit.

874
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:03,725
I'm a' learned you, though.

875
00:46:03,726 --> 00:46:05,143
I'm a' learned ya.

876
00:46:06,726 --> 00:46:09,309
Dwarves, midgets,

877
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:10,934
motherfuckin' unicorns...

878
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:12,725
them motherfuckers don't want to see

879
00:46:12,726 --> 00:46:14,142
a black man make it.

880
00:46:14,143 --> 00:46:15,934
- Yeah.
- You know what I mean?

881
00:46:15,935 --> 00:46:17,934
- For sure.
- You know?

882
00:46:17,935 --> 00:46:20,185
And I'll tell you something else.

883
00:46:30,102 --> 00:46:32,060
For sure.

884
00:46:39,227 --> 00:46:40,809
Word up, young MC.

885
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:42,725
You're just in time to
help cheer us to victory.

886
00:46:42,726 --> 00:46:44,184
Young MC.

887
00:46:44,185 --> 00:46:46,892
Bart, you know, I think you
keep getting funnier every day.

888
00:46:46,893 --> 00:46:48,934
You ain't gonna be laughing in a minute.

889
00:46:48,935 --> 00:46:50,309
Jamal.

890
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:52,725
Bart, I've decided since you and Jamal

891
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:54,267
are my two best athletes,

892
00:46:54,268 --> 00:46:56,767
I want you up against Yale.

893
00:46:56,768 --> 00:46:58,725
You can't just change the line-up!

894
00:46:58,726 --> 00:47:00,725
- That's against the rules!
- What rules? Who cares?

895
00:47:00,726 --> 00:47:02,476
Do you guys care about the rules?!

896
00:47:02,477 --> 00:47:04,352
- No.
- There you go.

897
00:47:08,435 --> 00:47:09,767
On your mark,

898
00:47:09,768 --> 00:47:11,767
get set...

899
00:47:11,768 --> 00:47:15,102
and they're off.
It's a clean start.

900
00:47:16,768 --> 00:47:19,684
What are you doing, hip-hop hooray?
Paddle!

901
00:47:19,685 --> 00:47:20,975
Paddle like a man!

902
00:47:20,976 --> 00:47:23,559
Shoot the J. Get jiggy with it.
Something!

903
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,643
They're blowing Harvard's
ass out of the water.

904
00:47:26,644 --> 00:47:30,059
Jamal, what's your ass doing rowing a boat?

905
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:31,850
You're supposed to be in class.

906
00:47:31,851 --> 00:47:33,351
Who the hell is that woman in the sky?!

907
00:47:33,352 --> 00:47:35,184
- I don't know.
- What's the matter?

908
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,975
You been smoking too much ganja?

909
00:47:37,976 --> 00:47:39,518
She's huge!

910
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:41,434
I guess you might as well come back home

911
00:47:41,435 --> 00:47:42,684
and live with me.

912
00:47:42,685 --> 00:47:43,809
Hell, no!

913
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:46,810
- Did you cuss at me?
- Row, motherfucker! Row!

914
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:50,393
Yes, Dean Cain.

915
00:47:50,394 --> 00:47:52,142
Am I to believe this is correct?

916
00:47:52,143 --> 00:47:55,102
Jamal and Silas have gotten all A's?

917
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:03,892
I'll call you back.

918
00:48:03,893 --> 00:48:05,351
How you doing, Dean?

919
00:48:05,352 --> 00:48:07,644
How you doing? How you been?

920
00:48:08,893 --> 00:48:10,725
I see you checking out my gear, right?

921
00:48:10,726 --> 00:48:12,809
- It's pretty tight, right?
- No, actually,

922
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:14,601
- it's rather baggy.
- No, no, man.

923
00:48:14,602 --> 00:48:16,351
It's phat, it's dope, it's cool, it's bufu.

924
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:18,643
Bill, what has happened to you?

925
00:48:18,644 --> 00:48:20,434
Sit down and take off those glasses.

926
00:48:20,435 --> 00:48:21,602
All righty.

927
00:48:23,435 --> 00:48:25,184
Tell me, how's Jamal doing?

928
00:48:25,185 --> 00:48:27,809
Fine. Very well.
He's coming along.

929
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:30,850
Now listen, Jaime's father
is having an upcoming election.

930
00:48:30,851 --> 00:48:34,017
And it won't look good
if she was to be involved

931
00:48:34,018 --> 00:48:35,684
with someone from the lower class.

932
00:48:35,685 --> 00:48:37,352
Isn't Jaime a freshman?

933
00:48:38,352 --> 00:48:40,017
All right, so you want me

934
00:48:40,018 --> 00:48:41,518
to tell Jamal to stop seeing Jaime.

935
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:43,351
He'll just tell me, Hey, man...

936
00:48:43,352 --> 00:48:46,226
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you.

937
00:48:46,227 --> 00:48:47,809
Point well taken.

938
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:50,309
I need you to help me get proof

939
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:52,850
that Jamal is diddling Jaime.

940
00:48:52,851 --> 00:48:54,934
I see now.

941
00:48:54,935 --> 00:48:56,850
Yes, it's all good.

942
00:48:56,851 --> 00:48:59,352
Yeah, I'll go holler at him, son.

943
00:49:00,602 --> 00:49:02,309
Bill, Bill.

944
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:04,393
Did you just call me son?

945
00:49:04,394 --> 00:49:06,519
Word.

946
00:49:07,477 --> 00:49:09,767
Word?

947
00:49:09,768 --> 00:49:12,226
Stroke, smoke,

948
00:49:12,227 --> 00:49:14,059
stroke, smoke,

949
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:16,393
stroke, smoke,

950
00:49:16,394 --> 00:49:19,059
stroke, smoke,

951
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:21,643
stroke, smoke...

952
00:49:21,644 --> 00:49:24,684
If Dean Cain think he can
kick me out the school that easy,

953
00:49:24,685 --> 00:49:26,601
he got another thing coming.

954
00:49:26,602 --> 00:49:29,184
- What an asshole.
- Hey, Coach, thanks a lot.

955
00:49:29,185 --> 00:49:30,226
I owe you.

956
00:49:30,227 --> 00:49:32,559
Listen, Jaime,

957
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:36,059
me and you cannot see each other no more.

958
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:38,309
No more dating, no more fooling around.

959
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:40,309
None of that! It stops. That's it.

960
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,476
Yes, it's probably better

961
00:49:42,477 --> 00:49:44,393
if we stop seeing each other

962
00:49:44,394 --> 00:49:47,393
for the sake of my father's campaign.

963
00:49:47,394 --> 00:49:50,059
If he lost the election
and it was my fault,

964
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:52,351
gosh-golly,

965
00:49:52,352 --> 00:49:55,268
that would be so hard on me.

966
00:49:56,435 --> 00:49:58,518
I don't think I could live with myself.

967
00:49:58,519 --> 00:50:00,559
But baby, maybe it'd be better

968
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,768
if you went to school somewhere down south.

969
00:50:05,768 --> 00:50:07,892
I think you should go down south first.

970
00:50:07,893 --> 00:50:10,060
This guy's a real asshole.

971
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:12,351
I can't.

972
00:50:12,352 --> 00:50:13,975
I can't do it, all right?

973
00:50:13,976 --> 00:50:16,059
If you don't bring your ass on...

974
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:18,725
We got work to do before
Dean Dickhead gets back.

975
00:50:18,726 --> 00:50:20,768
Come on.

976
00:50:34,851 --> 00:50:37,142
Aren't you worried
about getting kicked out?

977
00:50:37,143 --> 00:50:39,810
For this?
He ain't never gonna find out. Relax.

978
00:50:51,227 --> 00:50:53,934
What happen to bird?
Crazy shitting everywhere?

979
00:50:53,935 --> 00:50:55,351
Crazy shit, all right.

980
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:57,477
And it will be everywhere.

981
00:50:58,477 --> 00:51:00,393
With that they just won't shit.

982
00:51:00,394 --> 00:51:03,143
- Yeah.
- They're gonna blow up.

983
00:51:32,143 --> 00:51:34,892
And as for you two,

984
00:51:34,893 --> 00:51:37,518
ever since you arrived on this campus,

985
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:39,351
there's been several mishaps.

986
00:51:39,352 --> 00:51:41,351
Now, my instincts tell me it's you,

987
00:51:41,352 --> 00:51:43,809
but I can't prove it. Not yet.

988
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:46,226
But I know if I give you enough time,

989
00:51:46,227 --> 00:51:48,643
pretty soon you're going to slip up.

990
00:51:48,644 --> 00:51:50,559
And then I'll be able to send you back

991
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:53,352
to your miserable existence.

992
00:51:59,477 --> 00:52:01,643
What the hell are you wearing?

993
00:52:01,644 --> 00:52:03,017
Bufu!

994
00:52:03,018 --> 00:52:04,809
Bufu?

995
00:52:04,810 --> 00:52:07,060
By us, fuck you.

996
00:52:07,935 --> 00:52:10,227
Get out! Out, out, out...

997
00:52:11,602 --> 00:52:13,975
By us, fuck you.

998
00:52:13,976 --> 00:52:16,476
If the chancellor's
throwing a Halloween party,

999
00:52:16,477 --> 00:52:18,684
wait till Harvard see our Halloween party.

1000
00:52:18,685 --> 00:52:21,309
Yeah,
but if Dean Cain find out about this shit,

1001
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:23,934
he gonna be mad as a motherfucker.

1002
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,518
What the fuck is he gonna do?

1003
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:27,725
We got the Ivory, getting straight A's.

1004
00:52:27,726 --> 00:52:31,227
We got this motherfucker locked!

1005
00:52:33,018 --> 00:52:35,142
They look like they got money.

1006
00:52:35,143 --> 00:52:36,434
They kinda cute.

1007
00:52:36,435 --> 00:52:39,602
Girl, we gonna get paid.

1008
00:52:40,893 --> 00:52:43,768
- How you doing?
- For real.

1009
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:48,267
- End-table ass!
- Hella back.

1010
00:52:48,268 --> 00:52:50,850
Where the party at?
We trying to get a party on and stuff.

1011
00:52:50,851 --> 00:52:52,559
We having a party.

1012
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:55,101
Costume party at the Lovell house.

1013
00:52:55,102 --> 00:52:57,101
11:00 pm.

1014
00:52:57,102 --> 00:53:00,101
Please, bring your ass
and titties along with ya.

1015
00:53:00,102 --> 00:53:02,059
We want all the hos out here to come.

1016
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:04,351
Wait a minute.
Did you just call us hos?

1017
00:53:04,352 --> 00:53:06,267
I meant that in a good way.

1018
00:53:06,268 --> 00:53:08,267
Okay.

1019
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:10,434
Here. Now, bring all your horny friends.

1020
00:53:10,435 --> 00:53:12,434
There you go. Bring all the hos.

1021
00:53:12,435 --> 00:53:14,435
Y'all gonna pay us, right?

1022
00:53:16,602 --> 00:53:17,850
I don't hear nothing.

1023
00:53:17,851 --> 00:53:19,351
We got dough. Talk to 'em.

1024
00:53:19,352 --> 00:53:21,017
Yeah, yeah. We got dough.

1025
00:53:21,018 --> 00:53:22,643
If not, our best friends got dough.

1026
00:53:22,644 --> 00:53:24,267
And if not, their best friends got dough.

1027
00:53:24,268 --> 00:53:26,268
Okay, yeah. We down with that.

1028
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:29,226
Ass, titties, ballers.

1029
00:53:29,227 --> 00:53:30,975
Ballers, girl!

1030
00:53:30,976 --> 00:53:32,810
- Okay, all right.
- Ballers, all right.

1031
00:53:38,851 --> 00:53:41,435
Popcorn player.

1032
00:53:43,976 --> 00:53:47,059
I got one more delivery to make.

1033
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:49,268
Guess who used to be black?

1034
00:53:51,477 --> 00:53:53,892
Dean Cain. But he is black.

1035
00:53:53,893 --> 00:53:55,476
Like a polar bear.

1036
00:53:55,477 --> 00:53:57,184
But I got a recipe that'll inject

1037
00:53:57,185 --> 00:54:00,101
some ghetto back in his ass.

1038
00:54:00,102 --> 00:54:02,351
Got some more beer.

1039
00:54:02,352 --> 00:54:04,185
What did you do to yourself?

1040
00:54:05,394 --> 00:54:06,934
The fox club.

1041
00:54:06,935 --> 00:54:08,434
They put me in a shopping cart

1042
00:54:08,435 --> 00:54:10,184
and shoved me down a hill.

1043
00:54:10,185 --> 00:54:12,518
Thank God I fell out
before I hit the freeway.

1044
00:54:12,519 --> 00:54:14,684
What the fuck are you doing?
Put the milk back.

1045
00:54:14,685 --> 00:54:16,767
You're not supposed to steal from us!

1046
00:54:16,768 --> 00:54:19,267
Why are you always taking
violent tones with people?

1047
00:54:19,268 --> 00:54:21,351
Man, shut up before I kick your ass!

1048
00:54:21,352 --> 00:54:22,850
You know, as human beings

1049
00:54:22,851 --> 00:54:24,184
we should be able to talk this out,

1050
00:54:24,185 --> 00:54:25,809
not resort to violence.

1051
00:54:25,810 --> 00:54:27,850
How you gonna talk when you shutting up?

1052
00:54:27,851 --> 00:54:29,767
Fine! Fine! You want some violence?!

1053
00:54:29,768 --> 00:54:31,518
You want a piece of this? Come on!

1054
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:33,644
I'll show you some violence!
Well, come on!

1055
00:54:37,018 --> 00:54:38,810
Oh, god!

1056
00:54:39,685 --> 00:54:41,560
Now, go to time-out.

1057
00:54:42,602 --> 00:54:43,851
Go to your room.

1058
00:54:52,768 --> 00:54:55,684
I wonder who this could be.

1059
00:54:55,685 --> 00:54:57,601
My goodness.

1060
00:54:57,602 --> 00:54:59,226
Honey, look at this.

1061
00:54:59,227 --> 00:55:01,060
I wonder who these are from?

1062
00:55:02,893 --> 00:55:06,017
"Dear Carl, saw these and thought of you.

1063
00:55:06,018 --> 00:55:08,017
Love, Mrs. Ray."

1064
00:55:08,018 --> 00:55:10,184
It's my old school mum!

1065
00:55:10,185 --> 00:55:12,725
I haven't heard from her in years.

1066
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,393
How sweet.

1067
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:16,726
She knows I love brownies.

1068
00:55:18,435 --> 00:55:21,476
A little piece of heaven.

1069
00:55:21,477 --> 00:55:22,809
Better than mine?

1070
00:55:22,810 --> 00:55:25,059
Darling,
I don't remember you cooking brownies.

1071
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:26,601
You're right. I don't.

1072
00:55:26,602 --> 00:55:28,476
Hurry up, you're going to make us late.

1073
00:55:28,477 --> 00:55:30,267
You know how I hate to be late.

1074
00:55:30,268 --> 00:55:31,601
- Hurry, hurry, hurry.
- All right.

1075
00:55:31,602 --> 00:55:33,435
I'll take these upstairs.

1076
00:55:34,935 --> 00:55:36,184
I'll have another.

1077
00:55:36,185 --> 00:55:37,518
They're great.

1078
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:40,268
Throw me a beer, you big weenie!

1079
00:55:50,102 --> 00:55:51,768
Lovell house!

1080
00:55:56,352 --> 00:55:58,518
Cypress Hill. What up, fellas?

1081
00:55:58,519 --> 00:55:59,892
What's up, man?

1082
00:55:59,893 --> 00:56:02,101
- How was the trip?
- Good. Good.

1083
00:56:02,102 --> 00:56:03,809
I see Muggs couldn't make it,

1084
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:05,351
so I brought my man, I need money.

1085
00:56:05,352 --> 00:56:07,226
- Is he any good?
- Yeah, he don't talk.

1086
00:56:07,227 --> 00:56:08,767
He speak with his hands.
Know what I mean?

1087
00:56:08,768 --> 00:56:11,684
- Right, right, right.
- You have a good show.

1088
00:56:11,685 --> 00:56:13,518
Hey, hey.

1089
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:16,102
Don't fuck up tonight, all right?

1090
00:56:20,435 --> 00:56:22,644
Hey, what the fuck is the plate for, man?

1091
00:56:27,227 --> 00:56:29,435
It's gonna be a long night.

1092
00:56:31,644 --> 00:56:33,059
- Carl.
- Philip.

1093
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:34,850
- How are you?
- Wonderful.

1094
00:56:34,851 --> 00:56:37,267
You know Miss Janowitz
from the chemistry department.

1095
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:39,309
And Miss Lovell from administration.

1096
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:41,892
- You know my wife, Sheila.
- Almost didn't recognize you.

1097
00:56:41,893 --> 00:56:44,518
I thought you brought a
professional model to the party.

1098
00:56:44,519 --> 00:56:47,267
- You look lovely.
- Philip.

1099
00:56:47,268 --> 00:56:48,975
Yeah, the bitch is fine, ain't she?

1100
00:56:48,976 --> 00:56:50,309
What?

1101
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:52,434
Dear, can you at least feign some interest?

1102
00:56:52,435 --> 00:56:53,850
You're embarrassing me.

1103
00:56:53,851 --> 00:56:56,643
And will you loosen up?
You're so stiff sometimes.

1104
00:56:56,644 --> 00:56:58,101
Stiff?

1105
00:56:58,102 --> 00:57:01,017
This party is stiff.

1106
00:57:01,018 --> 00:57:03,017
Excuse me, can you hold this?
I'm hot.

1107
00:57:03,018 --> 00:57:04,850
Can you put this back on, actually?

1108
00:57:04,851 --> 00:57:06,685
Your... your butt is sticking out.

1109
00:57:07,893 --> 00:57:09,685
What?

1110
00:57:10,602 --> 00:57:12,644
What a jerk!

1111
00:57:14,352 --> 00:57:16,601
Don't spoil your appetite.
We're about to have

1112
00:57:16,602 --> 00:57:18,684
some lobster bisque and Indian pudding.

1113
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:20,934
I got the munchies like a motherfucker.

1114
00:57:20,935 --> 00:57:22,934
Hold this, baby.

1115
00:57:22,935 --> 00:57:24,767
He seems unusual tonight.

1116
00:57:24,768 --> 00:57:26,726
He's dehydrated.

1117
00:57:29,726 --> 00:57:31,726
Dance.

1118
00:57:33,102 --> 00:57:34,725
Baby, this is boring as hell!

1119
00:57:34,726 --> 00:57:36,601
DJ?!

1120
00:57:36,602 --> 00:57:39,685
Hit me!

1121
00:57:47,143 --> 00:57:48,726
Come here, girl!

1122
00:57:50,893 --> 00:57:53,227
Go, Dean!

1123
00:58:09,602 --> 00:58:11,601
See, I told you I have you covered.

1124
00:58:11,602 --> 00:58:14,768
There go the two big ballers right there.

1125
00:58:16,768 --> 00:58:19,227
- You two stay put.
- I'm going to hurt you.

1126
00:58:20,602 --> 00:58:22,726
Hey, hey, hey...

1127
00:58:23,935 --> 00:58:25,892
J, T.

1128
00:58:25,893 --> 00:58:28,850
See those two fine-ass hos right there?

1129
00:58:28,851 --> 00:58:31,184
Don't you wish they were really hos?

1130
00:58:31,185 --> 00:58:32,684
And they came over here and said,

1131
00:58:32,685 --> 00:58:35,267
"We want to run a dick-sucking marathon

1132
00:58:35,268 --> 00:58:36,767
with y'all two."

1133
00:58:36,768 --> 00:58:39,184
- Yeah. I'd like that.
- Me, too.

1134
00:58:39,185 --> 00:58:41,643
Okay, you and you.

1135
00:58:41,644 --> 00:58:44,768
We want to run a
dick-sucking marathon with y'all.

1136
00:58:46,102 --> 00:58:47,934
Okay.

1137
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:49,684
I'm not that good at it.

1138
00:58:49,685 --> 00:58:51,351
Baby, I ain't laughing.

1139
00:58:51,352 --> 00:58:53,643
I'm gonna make you mine.

1140
00:58:53,644 --> 00:58:55,476
Smells good.

1141
00:58:55,477 --> 00:58:57,435
Pretty boy lookin' motherfucker.

1142
00:58:58,310 --> 00:59:00,226
Hey, don't be scared.

1143
00:59:00,227 --> 00:59:01,976
It's only pussy.

1144
00:59:03,143 --> 00:59:05,101
Don't be scared.

1145
00:59:05,102 --> 00:59:07,768
I got two inches of hard dick.

1146
00:59:08,976 --> 00:59:11,435
I'll work with you, baby. Come on.

1147
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:18,017
Costume party.

1148
00:59:18,018 --> 00:59:20,643
Place, Lovell house. Time, Friday.

1149
00:59:20,644 --> 00:59:23,309
- It is Friday.
- That's what she told Cocoa Butter.

1150
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:25,393
These bitches better be getting my money.

1151
00:59:25,394 --> 00:59:27,809
Hella back is my bottom bitch.
You know that, right?

1152
00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:29,559
- Right, right.
- Okay.

1153
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,351
The bitch better be out
here checkin' my money.

1154
00:59:31,352 --> 00:59:33,518
Please don't cuss.
You know when I'm trying

1155
00:59:33,519 --> 00:59:35,643
to listen to the word.
The Lord don't like that.

1156
00:59:35,644 --> 00:59:37,892
- What did I say?
- You said, "bitch."

1157
00:59:37,893 --> 00:59:40,101
and "bitch" ain't in the Bible.

1158
00:59:40,102 --> 00:59:41,975
I know, bitch!
And neither is motherfucker!

1159
00:59:41,976 --> 00:59:44,017
So drive this motherfuckin' car!

1160
00:59:44,018 --> 00:59:46,184
And you the assistant pimp.

1161
00:59:46,185 --> 00:59:47,892
You ain't even a real pimp.

1162
00:59:47,893 --> 00:59:50,309
You're supposed to co-signing
to the shit that I say.

1163
00:59:50,310 --> 00:59:52,684
You want to lose your job?
I'm gonna pull your application.

1164
00:59:52,685 --> 00:59:54,725
Now let's practice it.
Where's my bitches?

1165
00:59:54,726 --> 00:59:56,934
- Where's my bitches?
- Where's my bitches?

1166
00:59:56,935 --> 00:59:59,351
You got to say it together.
It goes in together.

1167
00:59:59,352 --> 01:00:01,226
- Where my bitches?
- Where my bitches?

1168
01:00:01,227 --> 01:00:02,725
Okay, check this out.
Where my bitches?

1169
01:00:02,726 --> 01:00:05,142
Where my... can't we just say employees?

1170
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:07,810
What about your employees?
No, fuck that.

1171
01:00:11,102 --> 01:00:13,352
Great ass!

1172
01:00:29,976 --> 01:00:32,726
Go, go, go!

1173
01:00:38,768 --> 01:00:41,393
- Silas, hi.
- Hey, hey.

1174
01:00:41,394 --> 01:00:42,975
Let me ask you a question.

1175
01:00:42,976 --> 01:00:44,393
Now, don't laugh.

1176
01:00:44,394 --> 01:00:46,059
But...

1177
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:47,934
does my ass look fat?

1178
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:50,892
No, I say put another one
on the front of you just like it,

1179
01:00:50,893 --> 01:00:52,809
I'll slap both them motherfuckers.

1180
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:54,685
Badow! Badow!

1181
01:00:55,685 --> 01:00:58,518
Here, peer pressure.
Peer pressure.

1182
01:00:58,519 --> 01:01:01,767
- Let me holler at you.
- Okay.

1183
01:01:01,768 --> 01:01:03,768
That's my song.

1184
01:01:05,602 --> 01:01:07,434
What's this?

1185
01:01:07,435 --> 01:01:10,351
You got a big sword, baby.

1186
01:01:10,352 --> 01:01:12,017
I...

1187
01:01:12,018 --> 01:01:13,559
I have to go prepare.

1188
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:16,142
You ain't got to do shit, baby,

1189
01:01:16,143 --> 01:01:18,059
except climb out of this costume

1190
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:20,809
and climb into some pussy.

1191
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:23,142
You have to appreciate the colorful use

1192
01:01:23,143 --> 01:01:25,309
- of English language.
- Yeah!

1193
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:27,892
Give me that Chinese egg roll fuck.

1194
01:01:27,893 --> 01:01:30,227
I love America!

1195
01:01:40,726 --> 01:01:42,725
Let it be something that he is involved in,

1196
01:01:42,726 --> 01:01:46,142
and I'd better be the biggest cheerleader.
He's a huge baby.

1197
01:01:46,143 --> 01:01:48,892
Yeah, I hear you with your fine ass,
but pass the blunt.

1198
01:01:48,893 --> 01:01:51,142
Damn, you hogging the whole shit.

1199
01:01:51,143 --> 01:01:53,518
I'm sorry.

1200
01:01:53,519 --> 01:01:56,310
I must be buzzed, I'm babbling.

1201
01:01:57,310 --> 01:02:00,310
You know, you surprised me
by getting high.

1202
01:02:01,268 --> 01:02:03,184
I'm not that much of a square, Silas.

1203
01:02:03,185 --> 01:02:05,602
I did do it once in high school.

1204
01:02:08,227 --> 01:02:09,975
What about you?

1205
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:11,643
We all have secrets.

1206
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:13,309
Well, if you act right,

1207
01:02:13,310 --> 01:02:15,725
I might just let you in my head one day.

1208
01:02:15,726 --> 01:02:17,142
Whatever.

1209
01:02:17,143 --> 01:02:19,850
But I ain't saying shit on the first date.

1210
01:02:19,851 --> 01:02:22,226
Who said this was a date?

1211
01:02:22,227 --> 01:02:24,017
You smoked my weed, didn't you?

1212
01:02:24,018 --> 01:02:26,017
And we almost kissed, didn't we?

1213
01:02:26,018 --> 01:02:27,934
- We did not.
- Yes, we did.

1214
01:02:27,935 --> 01:02:29,685
- We did not.
- Here, hit this.

1215
01:02:36,102 --> 01:02:39,351
My bad. Did I spoil the moment?

1216
01:02:39,352 --> 01:02:42,184
I can't help it, though.
Them shits was talking to me.

1217
01:02:42,185 --> 01:02:43,767
You know what?

1218
01:02:43,768 --> 01:02:45,975
Look at them things.
Turn the headlights off.

1219
01:02:45,976 --> 01:02:48,518
I'm gonna tell you something.
This pimpin' that I got in my blood,

1220
01:02:48,519 --> 01:02:50,017
it came from a family trait.

1221
01:02:50,018 --> 01:02:51,934
My grandaddy was a pimp.

1222
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:54,351
My great-great-great grandaddy was a pimp.

1223
01:02:54,352 --> 01:02:56,518
I'm talking about pimpin'
been since pimpin'

1224
01:02:56,519 --> 01:02:57,601
since been pimpin'.

1225
01:02:57,602 --> 01:02:59,934
- It's in your bloodline.
- It's in my blood.

1226
01:02:59,935 --> 01:03:02,559
- And you will never be that.
- Wh... what?

1227
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:04,850
Because you was born, all the people

1228
01:03:04,851 --> 01:03:06,767
in your family were assistant pimps.

1229
01:03:06,768 --> 01:03:09,393
Assistant pimp?
I never did tell you that.

1230
01:03:09,394 --> 01:03:11,518
I thought you was the one the Lord chose.

1231
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:13,184
If it had not been for the Lord,

1232
01:03:13,185 --> 01:03:14,767
I wouldn't have not

1233
01:03:14,768 --> 01:03:16,643
had a bitch come into my life.

1234
01:03:16,644 --> 01:03:18,476
- Not now, never?
- Not a now, notha bitch.

1235
01:03:18,477 --> 01:03:21,101
Nobody say that now,
nothing like you say that now notha.

1236
01:03:21,102 --> 01:03:22,601
Not a now, notha bitch.

1237
01:03:22,602 --> 01:03:24,518
And I still don't know
what that shit means,

1238
01:03:24,519 --> 01:03:25,975
but it sound good.

1239
01:03:25,976 --> 01:03:27,393
Now notha means,

1240
01:03:27,394 --> 01:03:29,725
"don't get a now nothin'."

1241
01:03:29,726 --> 01:03:32,227
- A now nothin'.
- Nothin' outta them.

1242
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:35,059
Man, shut the fuck up
and drive this mother...

1243
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:36,768
I apologize, Father.

1244
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:58,102
Raging party with open
beer cans in hallway.

1245
01:04:12,102 --> 01:04:14,102
What's this?

1246
01:04:19,935 --> 01:04:21,684
Sterilize hands tonight.

1247
01:04:21,685 --> 01:04:24,477
Sterilize hands tonight with
anti-bacterial cream many times.

1248
01:04:33,310 --> 01:04:35,477
What do we have here?

1249
01:04:36,602 --> 01:04:38,644
Nothing.

1250
01:04:40,018 --> 01:04:41,810
Aha!

1251
01:04:43,935 --> 01:04:46,601
Multi-socket extension cubes.

1252
01:04:46,602 --> 01:04:48,476
This is against campus fire code,

1253
01:04:48,477 --> 01:04:50,017
section 1743:

1254
01:04:50,018 --> 01:04:52,267
Thou shall not allow
multi-socket extension cubes

1255
01:04:52,268 --> 01:04:55,142
use in dorm rooms.

1256
01:04:55,143 --> 01:04:57,809
The extension cords
themselves are intertwined

1257
01:04:57,810 --> 01:04:59,559
in the most flammable of ways,

1258
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:01,601
and are producing an
immense amount of heat.

1259
01:05:01,602 --> 01:05:03,768
It could cause an ignition at any point...

1260
01:05:15,893 --> 01:05:17,810
I'll be damned. What is that?

1261
01:05:18,810 --> 01:05:20,142
It's...

1262
01:05:20,143 --> 01:05:22,435
this a baby.

1263
01:05:30,851 --> 01:05:32,892
This ain't no damn baby.

1264
01:05:32,893 --> 01:05:34,559
What kind of shit is that
hangin' out the back?

1265
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:36,518
I need to get her home. Excuse me.

1266
01:05:36,519 --> 01:05:38,559
Where you going with that?

1267
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,685
- Come on.
- God damn.

1268
01:05:45,976 --> 01:05:47,975
Where them motherfuckin' bitches at?

1269
01:05:47,976 --> 01:05:49,559
Man, it smell like...

1270
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:51,351
Look at that,
look at this little bitty bitch.

1271
01:05:51,352 --> 01:05:53,809
Hey, little bitty bitch.

1272
01:05:53,810 --> 01:05:56,226
You little bitch,
you better get up off of me!

1273
01:05:56,227 --> 01:05:58,726
Where's my bitches?

1274
01:06:00,310 --> 01:06:01,934
What's up, homie?

1275
01:06:01,935 --> 01:06:03,684
- Where's my bitches at?
- Where're our bitches?

1276
01:06:03,685 --> 01:06:05,309
You got the voice down,

1277
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:07,017
but those outfits no good.

1278
01:06:07,018 --> 01:06:08,559
What's wrong with my shit?

1279
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:11,684
Homie, puh-lease!
Your Halloween costume!

1280
01:06:11,685 --> 01:06:14,726
If you pimp, you broke pimp!

1281
01:06:15,726 --> 01:06:17,809
You know you're fucked up,
Woody, don't you?

1282
01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:19,726
- Come on with it.
- Baby powder?

1283
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:23,227
You changing diapers?

1284
01:07:01,435 --> 01:07:03,267
What the fuck is all this?

1285
01:07:03,268 --> 01:07:05,767
- What you all three bitches want?
- Tell 'em, Powder!

1286
01:07:05,768 --> 01:07:07,934
We already got pussy here.
Y'all come back later.

1287
01:07:07,935 --> 01:07:09,767
I'm about to knock you the fuck out.

1288
01:07:09,768 --> 01:07:12,310
I'm gonna do the knockin' out.
Come on with it.

1289
01:07:24,227 --> 01:07:25,810
Where you going?

1290
01:07:26,726 --> 01:07:28,309
You got to stay!

1291
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:30,850
A party ain't a party without you!

1292
01:07:30,851 --> 01:07:32,477
You smelly little mother...

1293
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:36,143
Plus, there's no room in the limo!

1294
01:07:37,435 --> 01:07:38,976
I'll be back for you, man!

1295
01:07:41,477 --> 01:07:42,976
You ain't gonna need this.

1296
01:07:43,976 --> 01:07:46,309
Cops!

1297
01:07:46,310 --> 01:07:48,226
Somebody owes me for a night's worth

1298
01:07:48,227 --> 01:07:50,143
of flat-back fuckin' up in here!

1299
01:07:59,185 --> 01:08:01,850
This is exhilarating.
But don't get the wrong idea.

1300
01:08:01,851 --> 01:08:04,184
Megan and I have never done
anything like this before.

1301
01:08:04,185 --> 01:08:07,226
- We're virgins.
- Yeah, both of us.

1302
01:08:07,227 --> 01:08:10,267
Molly and I are really into Diangelo.

1303
01:08:10,268 --> 01:08:12,351
- Do you have any?
- Ain't that a bi...

1304
01:08:12,352 --> 01:08:14,059
Hell, no! We ain't got no Diang...

1305
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:15,559
And let me let you know something!

1306
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:17,684
While in this car, you don't run shit!

1307
01:08:17,685 --> 01:08:19,975
- Tell 'em, Powder.
- Dick drives this car!

1308
01:08:19,976 --> 01:08:21,310
Not pussy!

1309
01:08:22,726 --> 01:08:25,351
You think it's funny, bitch?!
This is pimpin' here.

1310
01:08:25,352 --> 01:08:27,184
I've been on "Wheel Of Fortune,"

1311
01:08:27,185 --> 01:08:28,767
"Price Is Right..." it's funny?

1312
01:08:28,768 --> 01:08:30,476
- Come on with it.
- Boy.

1313
01:08:30,477 --> 01:08:32,434
Y'all rather piss off
barracuda than piss off Powder.

1314
01:08:32,435 --> 01:08:34,351
It's funny. Keep on laughing.

1315
01:08:34,352 --> 01:08:36,060
Bring your face over here.

1316
01:08:37,477 --> 01:08:39,352
Pay that shit!

1317
01:08:45,477 --> 01:08:48,059
Man, come on.
You act like I took it.

1318
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:50,393
- We'll just get some more.
- Ain't no more.

1319
01:08:50,394 --> 01:08:52,684
All of Ivory's ashes
was in just that plant.

1320
01:08:52,685 --> 01:08:54,351
Now, come on, let's go see

1321
01:08:54,352 --> 01:08:56,601
what this Dean Stick-Up-His-Ass wants.

1322
01:08:56,602 --> 01:08:58,892
He probably gonna curse us out
about that wild-ass party.

1323
01:08:58,893 --> 01:09:01,519
Man, that party was not that wild.

1324
01:09:04,143 --> 01:09:06,809
Yeah, it did get a little out of hand.

1325
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:08,351
Know what I'm saying?

1326
01:09:08,352 --> 01:09:10,226
Sex novelties, obscenity,

1327
01:09:10,227 --> 01:09:13,267
fighting, indecent exposure,

1328
01:09:13,268 --> 01:09:16,268
rock bands without a permit.

1329
01:09:17,435 --> 01:09:20,602
Welcome, gentlemen, to academic probation.

1330
01:09:21,935 --> 01:09:24,017
Damn, who gonna be our O.O.?

1331
01:09:24,018 --> 01:09:26,227
How charmingly ghetto.

1332
01:09:27,227 --> 01:09:28,768
You're dismissed.

1333
01:09:33,851 --> 01:09:35,767
We ain't got no Ivory,

1334
01:09:35,768 --> 01:09:39,059
we're about to get
kicked the fuck out of here,

1335
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:41,101
and what the fuck are you doing?

1336
01:09:41,102 --> 01:09:43,184
I'm working on my truth serum.

1337
01:09:43,185 --> 01:09:45,601
Why you got to sound
all belligerent about my shit?

1338
01:09:45,602 --> 01:09:47,934
- "Belligerent"?
- Yeah, belligerent.

1339
01:09:47,935 --> 01:09:49,935
As in abusive or truculent.

1340
01:09:52,102 --> 01:09:54,601
You keep on using them
big-ass Harvard words

1341
01:09:54,602 --> 01:09:57,267
and your ghetto pass is gonna get revoked.

1342
01:09:57,268 --> 01:09:59,684
Why don't you go pick
up a book or something?

1343
01:09:59,685 --> 01:10:01,142
If I get this shit right,

1344
01:10:01,143 --> 01:10:02,601
I'll get an "A" in botany class.

1345
01:10:02,602 --> 01:10:06,351
- Motherfucker.
- When I was 12,

1346
01:10:06,352 --> 01:10:09,476
I used to love watching my dogs hump.

1347
01:10:09,477 --> 01:10:13,143
We used to have a good time.

1348
01:10:16,685 --> 01:10:18,310
Aaah!

1349
01:10:19,976 --> 01:10:21,809
God, this shit is nasty.

1350
01:10:21,810 --> 01:10:23,393
Aaah!

1351
01:10:23,394 --> 01:10:26,643
What the fuck is that?

1352
01:10:26,644 --> 01:10:28,767
I'm going to have to
tweak this shit a little.

1353
01:10:28,768 --> 01:10:31,101
Me hungry.

1354
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:35,017
I say we burn them books,
go to that graveyard,

1355
01:10:35,018 --> 01:10:37,934
find us a smart dead guy,

1356
01:10:37,935 --> 01:10:40,017
and smoke his skeleton ass.

1357
01:10:40,018 --> 01:10:41,850
We sit down, blaze up,

1358
01:10:41,851 --> 01:10:44,184
hit the books for a few hours a day,

1359
01:10:44,185 --> 01:10:46,226
we got this.

1360
01:10:46,227 --> 01:10:48,851
I'm telling you,
we don't need no smart dead guy.

1361
01:10:50,310 --> 01:10:51,601
Woo

1362
01:10:51,602 --> 01:10:53,892
That's what I'm talking about.

1363
01:10:53,893 --> 01:10:55,685
Light that shit up.

1364
01:10:58,227 --> 01:11:00,352
Hit them books, toonie.

1365
01:11:35,435 --> 01:11:37,643
These are our midterms?

1366
01:11:37,644 --> 01:11:39,725
See what I'm saying? All F's, son.

1367
01:11:39,726 --> 01:11:42,059
We are fucked.
Fucked, fucked, fucked, fucked!

1368
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:45,226
How did I fail women's studies?

1369
01:11:45,227 --> 01:11:47,726
I love bitches!

1370
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:52,309
What are we doing?

1371
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:54,851
Looking for a smart dead guy.

1372
01:11:56,352 --> 01:11:59,142
Well, guys. Hey! This guy'll do.

1373
01:11:59,143 --> 01:12:00,726
He's a President.

1374
01:12:03,185 --> 01:12:05,518
Yeah,
he should know all the fucking answers.

1375
01:12:05,519 --> 01:12:08,434
Answers?
What are you talking about?

1376
01:12:08,435 --> 01:12:10,017
No, no, no, no! Wait, no, no!

1377
01:12:10,018 --> 01:12:12,518
You can't dig up somebody's grave!
That's disgusting!

1378
01:12:12,519 --> 01:12:15,310
You guys don't think there's
anything wrong with this?

1379
01:12:17,477 --> 01:12:20,768
You guys are fucked up!
What are you gonna do with this now?

1380
01:12:22,602 --> 01:12:25,601
What the fuck is this shit?

1381
01:12:25,602 --> 01:12:28,518
Oh god.

1382
01:12:28,519 --> 01:12:30,643
Stop acting like a little bitch.
Get the body.

1383
01:12:30,644 --> 01:12:33,060
Shit.

1384
01:12:33,851 --> 01:12:36,601
What the fuck are you doing?

1385
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:38,767
Get the body, man.

1386
01:12:38,768 --> 01:12:41,559
You should have some more
respect for an ex-President.

1387
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:44,017
Asshole.

1388
01:12:44,018 --> 01:12:45,975
Come on, put this shit on your back.

1389
01:12:45,976 --> 01:12:48,142
Oh god, no.

1390
01:12:48,143 --> 01:12:50,393
Shut up before I slap the shit out of you!

1391
01:12:50,394 --> 01:12:52,810
Come on, come on, come on.

1392
01:12:55,477 --> 01:12:57,976
Oh my god, it's so...

1393
01:13:01,394 --> 01:13:03,559
Fly!

1394
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:04,767
Go fly!

1395
01:13:04,768 --> 01:13:06,851
Silas! What's up, dog?

1396
01:13:08,810 --> 01:13:11,725
Who are you? Can you see me?

1397
01:13:11,726 --> 01:13:14,643
- Relax! Relax!
- It's not opening. Open window!

1398
01:13:14,644 --> 01:13:17,393
What the fuck are we gonna do now?

1399
01:13:17,394 --> 01:13:19,559
Fuck you think we gonna do?

1400
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:22,476
We gonna smoke his ass,
then we gonna start asking questions.

1401
01:13:22,477 --> 01:13:23,643
Wait a minute.

1402
01:13:23,644 --> 01:13:25,725
Didn't you put the ashes in the soil

1403
01:13:25,726 --> 01:13:27,892
before you grew the plant?

1404
01:13:27,893 --> 01:13:29,559
We ain't got no time for that shit.

1405
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:31,518
We got to grind him now.
Get this on.

1406
01:13:31,519 --> 01:13:34,767
No, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

1407
01:13:34,768 --> 01:13:37,017
This is a President, man.

1408
01:13:37,018 --> 01:13:38,476
What the fuck are we doing?

1409
01:13:38,477 --> 01:13:40,685
You want to stay in Harvard or what?

1410
01:13:43,477 --> 01:13:45,434
I need money,
did you check him for any jewelry

1411
01:13:45,435 --> 01:13:47,226
or money on him or anything?

1412
01:13:47,227 --> 01:13:50,850
Fuck all that!
I'm cutting this arm now!

1413
01:13:50,851 --> 01:13:53,519
Son of a... shit!

1414
01:13:57,102 --> 01:13:59,184
Get the arm! Get the arm, man!

1415
01:13:59,185 --> 01:14:00,559
Y'all calm down! We got this!

1416
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:03,017
- Calm down!
- This is insane.

1417
01:14:03,018 --> 01:14:06,184
Shit!

1418
01:14:06,185 --> 01:14:08,560
You is a nasty motherfucker!

1419
01:14:23,602 --> 01:14:26,602
I can't smoke a finger.

1420
01:14:29,268 --> 01:14:30,726
This shit's not working.

1421
01:14:33,726 --> 01:14:36,226
Hey, what up, bro's?

1422
01:14:36,227 --> 01:14:39,017
I didn't know that you guys
were gonna be here!

1423
01:14:39,018 --> 01:14:40,850
I saved your plant.

1424
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:44,267
What did you do to it?

1425
01:14:44,268 --> 01:14:46,059
This is a special plant.

1426
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:47,850
I know.

1427
01:14:47,851 --> 01:14:50,809
- You stole our plant!
- Damn right he stole your plant.

1428
01:14:50,810 --> 01:14:53,725
Silas, this idiot smoked up all the plant!

1429
01:14:53,726 --> 01:14:55,601
You're gonna have to study on your own.

1430
01:14:55,602 --> 01:14:57,351
Damn, they can't hear me or see me.

1431
01:14:57,352 --> 01:14:59,934
- Tell 'em!
- Someone else was breaking in here.

1432
01:14:59,935 --> 01:15:03,101
So I caught them.
Maybe you can give me a reward, right?

1433
01:15:03,102 --> 01:15:06,809
- Like more of the plant?
- We ain't got no more goddamn plant!

1434
01:15:06,810 --> 01:15:09,059
Hoggin' all the good shit?
That's fine.

1435
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:11,226
Let's go, Ivory!

1436
01:15:11,227 --> 01:15:13,643
- Wait, Ivory here?
- Yeah, maybe.

1437
01:15:13,644 --> 01:15:15,601
- Repeat after me.
- Repeat after me.

1438
01:15:15,602 --> 01:15:16,975
- Dog!
- Zog!

1439
01:15:16,976 --> 01:15:18,767
- Dog!
- Zog!

1440
01:15:18,768 --> 01:15:20,393
- You idiot!
- You idiot!

1441
01:15:20,394 --> 01:15:22,643
- Shit, I'm disappearing.
- Shit, I'm disappearing.

1442
01:15:22,644 --> 01:15:23,809
- What?
- What?

1443
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:25,768
- What?
- What?

1444
01:15:28,227 --> 01:15:30,809
This reminds me of my lab back at the crib.

1445
01:15:30,810 --> 01:15:33,559
I have some of this same stuff.

1446
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:36,518
- How'd you get that?
- I stole it.

1447
01:15:36,519 --> 01:15:38,892
Why don't you just place
them on the wall there?

1448
01:15:38,893 --> 01:15:40,601
Well, well, well.

1449
01:15:40,602 --> 01:15:45,518
Never thought I'd find you two
ghetto asses up in here studying.

1450
01:15:45,519 --> 01:15:47,267
Ghetto asses?

1451
01:15:47,268 --> 01:15:48,850
Did I say that?

1452
01:15:48,851 --> 01:15:52,017
It must be the effects
of the brownies you sent me.

1453
01:15:52,018 --> 01:15:53,976
They must still be in my system.

1454
01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:57,351
Lauren, how's the project coming?

1455
01:15:57,352 --> 01:15:59,809
Fine. As a matter of fact,

1456
01:15:59,810 --> 01:16:03,434
I'm going to check on that right now.
You know, I got to go.

1457
01:16:03,435 --> 01:16:05,684
No, no, no, no, no.

1458
01:16:05,685 --> 01:16:07,809
Dean, why you got to be a hater?

1459
01:16:07,810 --> 01:16:09,684
Yes, I'm a hater.

1460
01:16:09,685 --> 01:16:12,351
I hate pot-smoking
punks that think everything

1461
01:16:12,352 --> 01:16:14,226
should just be given to them.

1462
01:16:14,227 --> 01:16:17,184
You two are an absolute
disgrace to this university.

1463
01:16:17,185 --> 01:16:20,351
Dean, man. What are those?

1464
01:16:20,352 --> 01:16:21,767
These?

1465
01:16:21,768 --> 01:16:24,017
These are invitations
to the alumni celebration

1466
01:16:24,018 --> 01:16:26,476
in which the Vice
President will be attending.

1467
01:16:26,477 --> 01:16:28,226
And Lauren will be unveiling

1468
01:16:28,227 --> 01:16:30,393
her Benjamin Franklin experiment.

1469
01:16:30,394 --> 01:16:32,850
Certain students will be invited.

1470
01:16:32,851 --> 01:16:34,725
Those that pass their finals.

1471
01:16:34,726 --> 01:16:37,267
- For real?
- But you won't pass your finals.

1472
01:16:37,268 --> 01:16:39,934
You'll fail, and then I'll
have you out of my hair

1473
01:16:39,935 --> 01:16:41,518
and out of Harvard.

1474
01:16:41,519 --> 01:16:43,810
Happy studying, gentlemen.

1475
01:16:44,851 --> 01:16:46,975
Fuck!

1476
01:16:46,976 --> 01:16:49,559
I'm trying to do my thing.
It's pimpin' over here, baby.

1477
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:51,809
Baby Powder,
when you gonna pay us our money?

1478
01:16:51,810 --> 01:16:54,434
- I got a $25 money order...
- $25?

1479
01:16:54,435 --> 01:16:56,434
- Money order?
- That you bitches can split.

1480
01:16:56,435 --> 01:16:58,309
Who you calling a bitch, bitch?

1481
01:16:58,310 --> 01:17:00,059
- Come on with it.
- I got ya.

1482
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:02,643
If it ain't Ricepuff Daddy.

1483
01:17:02,644 --> 01:17:05,393
No, no, Powder, that's Run-MSG.

1484
01:17:05,394 --> 01:17:07,559
Hey, what you listening to, brother?

1485
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:09,560
- Wu-Tang.
- Wu-Tang.

1486
01:17:14,102 --> 01:17:15,975
I... we don't listen to that Chinese shit!

1487
01:17:15,976 --> 01:17:18,101
- We do this little trip.
- This what we do.

1488
01:17:18,102 --> 01:17:19,725
- You guys!
- Show 'em, Powder!

1489
01:17:19,726 --> 01:17:21,643
- Powder, you a genius.
- You need to sit down.

1490
01:17:21,644 --> 01:17:24,725
I'm gonna round them
almond eyes of yours out!

1491
01:17:24,726 --> 01:17:26,934
- You understand me pimpin'?
- Hold on, Powder.

1492
01:17:26,935 --> 01:17:30,518
Let's not get ig'nant.
Maybe he just came here to pay our money.

1493
01:17:30,519 --> 01:17:33,809
- No, I come for your girls.
- Wooo!

1494
01:17:33,810 --> 01:17:37,142
You're gonna come back and give me
them two duck sauces your mama...

1495
01:17:37,143 --> 01:17:40,476
- You can't hold me back!
- Go Tuan!

1496
01:17:40,477 --> 01:17:42,393
Let me get my stinkin' blade out.

1497
01:17:42,394 --> 01:17:43,976
Let me get my blade out.
I'm gonna...

1498
01:17:45,018 --> 01:17:46,850
- Ooh, shit!
- Come on, bee-atch.

1499
01:17:46,851 --> 01:17:49,726
Man, it was two egg rolls.
It wasn't the duck sauce.

1500
01:17:51,519 --> 01:17:53,768
Oooh!

1501
01:17:55,602 --> 01:17:57,559
Who the bitch now, bitch?

1502
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:59,059
Bee-atch!

1503
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:02,267
I need to slap my goddamn self for that.

1504
01:18:02,268 --> 01:18:06,185
Pimps go through this kind
of shit from time to time.

1505
01:18:11,935 --> 01:18:13,601
Yes, Dean Cain here.

1506
01:18:13,602 --> 01:18:16,601
Yes, I did receive them.
As a matter of fact,

1507
01:18:16,602 --> 01:18:20,267
I was just going over
Silas and Jamal's grades,

1508
01:18:20,268 --> 01:18:22,184
and I see they're all F's.

1509
01:18:22,185 --> 01:18:24,559
Yes, I agree.

1510
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:27,643
Very sad. Very sad, indeed.

1511
01:18:27,644 --> 01:18:29,059
Yes. Well,

1512
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:31,810
I'll speak to you later. Bye bye.

1513
01:18:33,477 --> 01:18:36,310
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1514
01:18:38,102 --> 01:18:41,143
Hey!

1515
01:18:42,143 --> 01:18:45,434
Dean Cain expects us off campus by Monday.

1516
01:18:45,435 --> 01:18:47,892
It went that bad in botany class?

1517
01:18:47,893 --> 01:18:50,601
Kid lost about 15 pounds of fluid.

1518
01:18:50,602 --> 01:18:52,142
And that was just from the mouth.

1519
01:18:52,143 --> 01:18:55,434
And I'm still below a 2.0.

1520
01:18:55,435 --> 01:18:57,644
We gonna get kicked
the fuck out this school.

1521
01:18:58,810 --> 01:19:00,684
Maybe I can go back to being your manager,

1522
01:19:00,685 --> 01:19:03,477
and you strip at that club
again like you used to.

1523
01:19:04,851 --> 01:19:08,017
No, you can't give up!
You can't let the dean win.

1524
01:19:08,018 --> 01:19:11,518
Did Commander Riker give up when the Borg
infiltrated the Starship Enterprise

1525
01:19:11,519 --> 01:19:14,351
and Captain Picard
came back all half-robot?

1526
01:19:14,352 --> 01:19:17,184
The Borgs? They're here!

1527
01:19:17,185 --> 01:19:19,268
Oh, god! Run for your lives!

1528
01:19:21,102 --> 01:19:24,767
- The point is...
- My point is shut the fuck up.

1529
01:19:24,768 --> 01:19:27,142
It's over.

1530
01:19:27,143 --> 01:19:30,310
And we outta here.
Washing my hands.

1531
01:19:31,893 --> 01:19:33,892
Silas, man, you can't give up.

1532
01:19:33,893 --> 01:19:36,519
If you get this botany grade changed,
they have to keep you.

1533
01:19:38,018 --> 01:19:40,351
Yeah. My... my truth serum.

1534
01:19:40,352 --> 01:19:42,059
- Yeah.
- I got to fix it.

1535
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:44,060
That's right.

1536
01:19:50,893 --> 01:19:52,685
Here's your coffee.

1537
01:19:54,851 --> 01:19:56,726
Nausea.

1538
01:20:08,602 --> 01:20:10,267
Bart, nice to see you.

1539
01:20:10,268 --> 01:20:13,101
Listen, I think I have a solution

1540
01:20:13,102 --> 01:20:14,725
to your little problem.

1541
01:20:14,726 --> 01:20:17,351
No. I already got the prescription filled.

1542
01:20:17,352 --> 01:20:19,518
Zing!

1543
01:20:19,519 --> 01:20:21,226
Not that problem.

1544
01:20:21,227 --> 01:20:22,725
I'm talking about the boys.

1545
01:20:22,726 --> 01:20:25,975
Those rejects have been rejected.

1546
01:20:25,976 --> 01:20:29,725
Dean Cain! Look who's back.

1547
01:20:29,726 --> 01:20:32,559
Holler.

1548
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:34,643
Dean, what a surprise.
Look who's here.

1549
01:20:34,644 --> 01:20:36,684
- How exciting.
- Guys we weren't expecting you,

1550
01:20:36,685 --> 01:20:38,393
but you're right on time.

1551
01:20:38,394 --> 01:20:41,602
Let's go meet the next
likely leader of the free world.

1552
01:20:44,227 --> 01:20:45,850
What are you two doing here?

1553
01:20:45,851 --> 01:20:48,101
Couldn't have my future ex-wife

1554
01:20:48,102 --> 01:20:49,892
show up to some bigwig event

1555
01:20:49,893 --> 01:20:52,267
without her daddy on her arms.

1556
01:20:52,268 --> 01:20:55,102
- Ain't that right, baby?
- Right, Daddy.

1557
01:20:56,143 --> 01:20:58,684
Old friends, fellow alums,

1558
01:20:58,685 --> 01:21:01,267
it's wonderful being back here at Harvard.

1559
01:21:01,268 --> 01:21:03,684
And I get to see my beautiful daughter.

1560
01:21:03,685 --> 01:21:05,476
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Daddy.

1561
01:21:05,477 --> 01:21:07,601
Daddy? This is Jamal.

1562
01:21:07,602 --> 01:21:10,684
- Jamal, this is my dad.
- Aha. Hello, Jamal.

1563
01:21:10,685 --> 01:21:12,975
Mr. President.
And I call you Mr. President

1564
01:21:12,976 --> 01:21:15,559
because I know you
gonna rock this election.

1565
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:17,810
I hope you're right, son.
. Camera.

1566
01:21:25,435 --> 01:21:27,476
All right, Ivory, this is the last of you.

1567
01:21:27,477 --> 01:21:29,184
Do your stuff.

1568
01:21:29,185 --> 01:21:31,975
Hey, Professor.

1569
01:21:31,976 --> 01:21:34,142
- What's going on?
- Nice to see you again.

1570
01:21:34,143 --> 01:21:37,101
Listen, tonight I got a feeling you're
gonna see my experiment work.

1571
01:21:37,102 --> 01:21:39,767
I hope we don't have
to pass out any barf bags.

1572
01:21:39,768 --> 01:21:41,476
Don't even worry about that.

1573
01:21:41,477 --> 01:21:43,518
See, I found my secret ingredient.

1574
01:21:43,519 --> 01:21:46,309
By adding a little bit of chro... cannibis,

1575
01:21:46,310 --> 01:21:48,393
I was able to counteract the nausea.

1576
01:21:48,394 --> 01:21:50,393
I'm proud of you.

1577
01:21:50,394 --> 01:21:52,185
Thank you, Professor.
Thank you, man.

1578
01:21:57,394 --> 01:22:00,393
- I actually feel wonderful.
- Isn't he great, Daddy?

1579
01:22:00,394 --> 01:22:03,352
Yeah. He's great.

1580
01:22:11,851 --> 01:22:13,351
Secret Service!

1581
01:22:13,352 --> 01:22:16,352
Hey, Jamie,
here's your dad after a frat party!

1582
01:22:17,810 --> 01:22:20,393
We don't want the dean to
get his panties in a bunch!

1583
01:22:20,394 --> 01:22:22,684
- Carl, it's all right.
- He might want a spanking!

1584
01:22:22,685 --> 01:22:24,810
Sit down.

1585
01:22:28,810 --> 01:22:30,059
Wait a minute.

1586
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:31,975
I know y'all ain't playing grab-ass

1587
01:22:31,976 --> 01:22:34,975
while I'm entertaining my future
vanilla villa father are ya?

1588
01:22:34,976 --> 01:22:37,559
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Yeah?

1589
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:40,559
Man, look. The serum working.
They high, dog! Look!

1590
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:42,518
Hey, man, look.
I got something to tell you.

1591
01:22:42,519 --> 01:22:44,850
Man, I've been pinching your weed off.

1592
01:22:44,851 --> 01:22:48,226
- What you telling me for?
- Damn! I don't know.

1593
01:22:48,227 --> 01:22:51,017
I guess it's that new serum, man.
I'm sorry, man.

1594
01:22:51,018 --> 01:22:53,892
- That's okay. Don't worry about it.
- It ain't all right.

1595
01:22:53,893 --> 01:22:57,101
I been taking your CDs,
I been using your weed pipes,

1596
01:22:57,102 --> 01:23:00,518
I even been looking at Lauren's ass.

1597
01:23:00,519 --> 01:23:03,393
She's fine!
And if she gave me the chance,

1598
01:23:03,394 --> 01:23:05,934
I would wax that ass till
she showed me what she wa...

1599
01:23:05,935 --> 01:23:07,518
Bro.

1600
01:23:07,519 --> 01:23:10,810
Jamal, I will take that as a compliment.

1601
01:23:13,768 --> 01:23:15,142
Thank you.

1602
01:23:15,143 --> 01:23:17,601
We all know that Harvard
has been honored to host

1603
01:23:17,602 --> 01:23:19,892
some of Benjamin Franklin's artifacts,

1604
01:23:19,893 --> 01:23:22,184
which I personally found.

1605
01:23:22,185 --> 01:23:23,892
Like this cannon-like article back here.

1606
01:23:23,893 --> 01:23:25,476
Now later, you can take note

1607
01:23:25,477 --> 01:23:28,101
of the foot-operated carburetor,

1608
01:23:28,102 --> 01:23:32,017
the reservoir,
and the top-loading bud bowl.

1609
01:23:32,018 --> 01:23:33,309
Ladies and gentlemen,

1610
01:23:33,310 --> 01:23:35,850
Harvard is now the proud owner

1611
01:23:35,851 --> 01:23:39,143
of America's first... bong.

1612
01:23:41,227 --> 01:23:43,560
A bong?!

1613
01:23:44,851 --> 01:23:46,601
This is outrageous!

1614
01:23:46,602 --> 01:23:48,643
If Benjamin Franklin were here today,

1615
01:23:48,644 --> 01:23:51,017
he would deny and denounce

1616
01:23:51,018 --> 01:23:53,601
any claim to these so-called findings!

1617
01:23:53,602 --> 01:23:57,101
I'm gonna have to disagree on that.

1618
01:23:57,102 --> 01:23:59,393
Ben, tell this fool.
Is that a bong or what?

1619
01:23:59,394 --> 01:24:01,434
Yup, it's the liberty bong.

1620
01:24:01,435 --> 01:24:02,975
Light that shit.

1621
01:24:02,976 --> 01:24:06,975
Smoke that shit. Pass that shit.

1622
01:24:06,976 --> 01:24:09,477
- You got to come to this party, Ben.
- You got a party?

1623
01:24:10,602 --> 01:24:12,434
Hey, man. Hey.

1624
01:24:12,435 --> 01:24:14,143
- Come on, man, smoke.
- Gerald!

1625
01:24:15,685 --> 01:24:18,268
Yeah.

1626
01:24:20,227 --> 01:24:22,518
This is insane!

1627
01:24:22,519 --> 01:24:24,434
What are you all laughing at?!

1628
01:24:24,435 --> 01:24:26,518
Dean, I have had it with your uptight,

1629
01:24:26,519 --> 01:24:29,684
self-serving, over-opinionated ass!

1630
01:24:29,685 --> 01:24:32,477
- Get him!
- In short, you are fired!

1631
01:24:34,519 --> 01:24:36,851
Hit the bricks, dog!

1632
01:24:54,602 --> 01:24:57,184
- Silas!
- Jamal!

1633
01:24:57,185 --> 01:24:59,934
Dog, man.
Look like you did it, dog.

1634
01:24:59,935 --> 01:25:01,518
You got a new serum, man.

1635
01:25:01,519 --> 01:25:03,975
You gonna be an herbal scientist,
my brother.

1636
01:25:03,976 --> 01:25:06,032
Me and you turned this place
upside down, didn't we?

1637
01:25:06,053 --> 01:25:06,851
Did we!

1638
01:25:06,851 --> 01:25:09,184
Amazing what two brothers from the PJ's

1639
01:25:09,185 --> 01:25:11,393
could do with just a
little bit of opportunity.

1640
01:25:11,394 --> 01:25:13,434
Word.

1641
01:25:13,435 --> 01:25:16,143
- Holler at ya, dog.
- I will.

1642
01:25:18,227 --> 01:25:20,726
Secret Service!

1643
01:25:23,935 --> 01:25:27,102
Wh-wh-Dean, Dean,
ease up on the black-on-black crime.

1644
01:25:29,268 --> 01:25:32,725
This motherfucker done messed up my shit!

1645
01:25:32,726 --> 01:25:35,059
Back up, nigga!
You better give me three feet!

1646
01:25:35,060 --> 01:25:36,685
Give me three feet!

1647
01:25:42,851 --> 01:25:44,726
Hey, get up.

1648
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:48,101
Cool.

1649
01:25:48,102 --> 01:25:50,767
- Take him away, boys.
- Take your hands off of me!

1650
01:25:50,768 --> 01:25:53,393
Do you realize who I am?
What are you looking at?!

1651
01:25:53,394 --> 01:25:55,226
I need money! You talked!

1652
01:25:55,227 --> 01:25:57,142
Why yes, Jamal.

1653
01:25:57,143 --> 01:25:58,975
It is somewhat of a surprise to me, also.

1654
01:25:58,976 --> 01:26:01,850
Lord, it's a gift!
It's a gift from above!

1655
01:26:01,851 --> 01:26:03,684
Make you float like a dove!

1656
01:26:03,685 --> 01:26:06,601
Make you scream like Michael
in a rhinestone glove!

1657
01:26:06,602 --> 01:26:07,935
Lord, Lord, Lord.

1658
01:26:09,810 --> 01:26:12,102
Popcorn player.

1659
01:26:16,519 --> 01:26:18,850
I didn't inhale!

1660
01:26:18,851 --> 01:26:21,394
God,
this is the wildest time I've ever had.

1661
01:26:22,768 --> 01:26:24,434
Then you won't mind that I'm

1662
01:26:24,435 --> 01:26:25,934
banging your daughter on the regular?

1663
01:26:25,935 --> 01:26:27,351
No, no, not at all!

1664
01:26:27,352 --> 01:26:29,644
Good,
because Jamal's gonna be my baby daddy.

1665
01:26:31,352 --> 01:26:34,268
- Son, welcome to the family.
- Daddy.

1666
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:39,850
Silas, your experiment was a success.

1667
01:26:39,851 --> 01:26:41,975
Your serum worked,

1668
01:26:41,976 --> 01:26:44,476
and you're going to
get an "A" in my course.

1669
01:26:44,477 --> 01:26:47,059
- Professor!
- So that means I get to stay?

1670
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:50,309
You betcha! You can stay as
long as it takes you to graduate.

1671
01:26:50,310 --> 01:26:52,434
I don't care. Right, ladies?

1672
01:26:52,435 --> 01:26:55,309
Shall we, ladies?

1673
01:26:55,310 --> 01:26:57,934
Hey, down here! This is not happening!

1674
01:26:57,935 --> 01:27:01,267
Lauren, you are coming with me!

1675
01:27:01,268 --> 01:27:04,477
Honey, you have never satisfied me.

1676
01:27:06,519 --> 01:27:08,725
Silas?

1677
01:27:08,726 --> 01:27:10,477
But I can.

1678
01:27:20,018 --> 01:27:22,309
Now the day you lay off
is the day you pay off.

1679
01:27:22,310 --> 01:27:24,059
We come in here to get our old bitches,

1680
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:25,518
but if they ain't in here,

1681
01:27:25,519 --> 01:27:27,142
we gonna get them intellect bitches

1682
01:27:27,143 --> 01:27:29,226
and start our own new stable.
You feel me?

1683
01:27:29,227 --> 01:27:31,892
Just keep it pimp-alicious, though, baby.

1684
01:27:31,893 --> 01:27:33,725
Powder, what are you doing here?

1685
01:27:33,726 --> 01:27:35,601
What are you doing in here, Phil?!

1686
01:27:35,602 --> 01:27:38,142
I've been rolling this joint for 20 years.

1687
01:27:38,143 --> 01:27:39,850
But if these people knew I was using

1688
01:27:39,851 --> 01:27:43,059
your Dial-A-Ho service,
they might not understand.

1689
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:46,643
You are one of my biggest customers.
You like them hand jobs.

1690
01:27:46,644 --> 01:27:48,601
Fat bitches pissing on you all the time!

1691
01:27:48,602 --> 01:27:50,850
- I like the ladies.
- Lickin' poodle feets.

1692
01:27:50,851 --> 01:27:54,267
Let's stop it right there.
Have you ever been to college?

1693
01:27:54,268 --> 01:27:56,101
Yeah, two years. Pussyology.

1694
01:27:56,102 --> 01:27:59,101
Academia. I like it.
Give me a call next week.

1695
01:27:59,102 --> 01:28:02,226
I think we can work something out.

1696
01:28:02,227 --> 01:28:05,226
Today's class is called Pimpology I and II.

1697
01:28:05,227 --> 01:28:07,226
I'm one, that's two.

1698
01:28:07,227 --> 01:28:08,393
That's what your ass will be

1699
01:28:08,394 --> 01:28:11,059
if you don't pass this class.

1700
01:28:11,060 --> 01:28:12,892
It got to come out right!

1701
01:28:12,893 --> 01:28:15,559
If it don't come out right
you ain't gonna get to pimp tonight!

1702
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:17,850
- Where my bitches?
- Where my bitches?

1703
01:28:17,851 --> 01:28:20,393
Come on with it,

1704
01:28:20,394 --> 01:28:22,060
and let it fly!

1705
01:28:23,851 --> 01:28:27,226
Not yourselves! Shit!

1706
01:28:27,227 --> 01:28:29,726
That was deep. That was deep.

1707
01:28:30,810 --> 01:28:33,892
And B-cam roll. B marker.

1708
01:28:33,893 --> 01:28:36,559
Cut!

1709
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:40,059
And another thing.
I forgot my motherfuckin' line!

1710
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:44,017
Stop doing that shit.
You can't be laughing at me.

1711
01:28:44,018 --> 01:28:45,975
Fuck my close-up up, nigger.

1712
01:28:45,976 --> 01:28:49,643
They know we stole the statue.

1713
01:28:49,644 --> 01:28:53,850
I knew it! You guys and your lies!

1714
01:28:53,851 --> 01:28:57,101
- Can I get some pussy?
- Sure. Come on in.

1715
01:28:57,102 --> 01:28:59,476
I told you we shoulda went to UCLA.

1716
01:28:59,477 --> 01:29:03,102
I'm about to go stick my dick
in a thermos or something.

1717
01:29:04,477 --> 01:29:06,767
Puffs for purgatory.
For everybody. Line 'em up.

1718
01:29:06,768 --> 01:29:09,059
- Puffs for purgatory, baby.
- Puffs for purgatory.

1719
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:10,725
Puffs for purgatory!

1720
01:29:10,726 --> 01:29:13,601
...see each other no more.
I mean, the fuckin' around,

1721
01:29:13,602 --> 01:29:15,893
the shit!

1722
01:29:28,477 --> 01:29:30,393
I pledge allegiance to the pimp,

1723
01:29:30,394 --> 01:29:33,643
the United Pimps of America.

1724
01:29:33,644 --> 01:29:36,476
Come on, you fuckers! Call action!

1725
01:29:36,477 --> 01:29:40,142
I don't give a fuck if it breaks.

1726
01:29:40,143 --> 01:29:42,850
You hear me? God damn it!

1727
01:29:42,851 --> 01:29:45,226
Turn that goddamn water off!

1728
01:29:45,227 --> 01:29:48,850
Cut, cut, cut.

1729
01:29:48,851 --> 01:29:50,142
- Cut.
- Cut.

1730
01:29:50,143 --> 01:29:51,476
- Cut!
- Cut.

1731
01:29:51,477 --> 01:29:53,101
Cut!

1732
01:29:53,102 --> 01:29:55,684
- The movie's over.
- Why are you guys still in your seat?

1733
01:29:55,685 --> 01:29:59,143
- Go home!
- Why don't y'all want to leave?

1734
01:30:01,352 --> 01:30:04,226
Ladies and gentlemen,

1735
01:30:04,227 --> 01:30:06,976
we got Toni Braxton up in the house.

1736
01:30:09,268 --> 01:30:11,685
We live up in here, y'all.
