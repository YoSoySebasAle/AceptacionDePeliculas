1
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:38,573
I know you're
here with someone else.

2
00:00:38,606 --> 00:00:41,242
But does he make you happy?

3
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:45,680
Does he know
about your interests?

4
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:49,417
I mean, does he
really know about them?

5
00:00:55,523 --> 00:00:59,260
Does he spend weeks raising
a boat from the ocean floor

6
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:01,162
just for your viewing pleasure?

7
00:01:01,196 --> 00:01:04,432
- Thought it might
make a good photo.

8
00:01:04,466 --> 00:01:07,469
Does he pay someone
to release a watch of
nightingales

9
00:01:07,502 --> 00:01:08,803
at just the right moment?

10
00:01:08,836 --> 00:01:10,871
- What's wrong?
- Nothing...

11
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:12,673
- Rusty!

12
00:01:12,707 --> 00:01:14,842
Release the birds!

13
00:01:14,876 --> 00:01:19,447
Does he know, neurochemically,
how to make you happy?

14
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,449
- You have modulation of
sensory...

15
00:01:21,483 --> 00:01:23,418
- ...Activation of limbic
system...

16
00:01:23,451 --> 00:01:25,353
- ...Increased oxytocin...

17
00:01:27,722 --> 00:01:31,759
...Orgasm is achieved.

18
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:35,430
I know how to make you happy.

19
00:01:35,463 --> 00:01:37,999
If we were here together,

20
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:43,471
I would do all these
things and we would be happy.

21
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:45,473
Am I crazy to think
we would be happy?

22
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:17,138
THE INFINITE MAN

23
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,186
- What?

24
00:02:33,688 --> 00:02:36,758
- Didn't you call ahead?
- There was no answer.

25
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:39,661
- Well, this would be why.

26
00:02:39,694 --> 00:02:42,496
- I don't believe it!

27
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,031
At this time last year we were

28
00:02:44,065 --> 00:02:47,268
playing musical
instruments over there...

29
00:02:47,302 --> 00:02:49,437
Fine dining in there...

30
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,940
Adult activities upstairs...

31
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:58,813
I didn't know they closed down,
I am so sorry. I am stupid.

32
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:02,284
- Look, it doesn't matter.
Let's go to the beach instead.

33
00:03:02,317 --> 00:03:04,385
- The beach. I had a dream
about the beach last night.

34
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:07,989
- Great. Maybe it's a sign.

35
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:11,159
- No we can't. I've drawn up ths
schedule based on last year,

36
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:12,893
you see? This was perfect.

37
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:16,598
- It was. It was also
a year ago, and things change.

38
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:18,866
Motels shut down,
and people move on.

39
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:23,037
- I hold in my hands the
blueprint to a perfect weekend,

40
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:28,342
and if we stay...if we
follow this very precisely,
then...

41
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:31,445
- That's why we're dressed
in the same clothes as last
year.

42
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:34,182
- I love you in that dress.

43
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:36,184
I guess it's a controllable
variable.

44
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:38,386
- I am taking this stuff to the.
I am taking these clothes off.

45
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,887
I am driving to the beach
and I am going for a swim.

46
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,690
- Lana, please, I mean surely
a...

47
00:03:41,723 --> 00:03:43,424
a deep tissue massage
is preferable to fighting?

48
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:45,326
- We're not fighting.
- Are we not massaging?

49
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,762
- No, no, because I didn't
come all the way out here

50
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:52,133
just to do exactly what
we did on our last anniversary.

51
00:03:53,101 --> 00:03:56,738
- No, of course not.
- It's nuts.

52
00:03:56,771 --> 00:04:00,274
- It is, you're absolutely
right.

53
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:03,511
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:03,545 --> 00:04:05,947
- It's okay.

55
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:11,919
- You feel tense.
- Yeah, it's just...

56
00:04:11,953 --> 00:04:14,122
- Please...

57
00:04:14,155 --> 00:04:16,791
- I'll be in the car.

58
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:18,359
- Do you know where I'll be?

59
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:22,496
Upstairs with these babies and
some fractionated coconut oil.

60
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:25,299
Massaging not masturbating!

61
00:04:35,944 --> 00:04:40,415
- Lana! Welcome!
Glad you came back!

62
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:44,085
I think it scrubs up ok.

63
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:47,288
I've bypassed the
main switch board.

64
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:49,491
I found the mattress next door.

65
00:04:49,524 --> 00:04:51,392
Those sheets aren't washed,
don't touch those sheets.

66
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:53,361
And...the beach.

67
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:55,229
So...

68
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:57,698
Now, I had planned
a musical celebration

69
00:04:57,732 --> 00:05:00,735
of your Dutch ancestry
for...about now. But...

70
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,772
- You do not have to do that...
- Don't worry, I have copies.

71
00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:06,674
It's a symbolic gesture.

72
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:11,412
The point is we can do
whatever you like.

73
00:05:11,446 --> 00:05:14,749
- I don't know...surprise me.

74
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:39,306
- My love, Dutch klompens,
should the bass line seize you.

75
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:44,946
- Eat! Eat!

76
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:49,350
The menu might be a year old,
but the food certainly isn't.

77
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:55,456
Except for the dolmades
but they last forever.

78
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,408
- Lana!

79
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:15,543
- Yea?

80
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:17,879
- Sexual congress in five!

81
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:24,786
- For our last
anniversary I spent months

82
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:27,521
studying the blue arts...

83
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:30,124
at least in erotica,
Tantric techniques...

84
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:32,693
- The Viennese oyster.

85
00:06:32,727 --> 00:06:36,163
Depressed Elephant.

86
00:06:36,197 --> 00:06:38,699
- I couldn't wait to try it
on someone other than myself,

87
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:43,704
but when the
moment finally arrived, I...

88
00:06:43,738 --> 00:06:45,039
well I achieved
cosmic consciousness

89
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,074
faster than I would have liked.

90
00:06:47,108 --> 00:06:49,176
- Your cosmic
consciousness was just fine.

91
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,346
- It could have been
more tantric, that's all.

92
00:06:53,114 --> 00:06:55,082
Yes

93
00:06:56,484 --> 00:06:57,752
- What's this?

94
00:06:57,786 --> 00:07:02,490
- This...this is more
stimulating than Tantra.

95
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:07,061
- Well, Happy Anniversary
indeed.

96
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:11,632
- Something I've been
developing at the lab.

97
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:15,269
It is an external limbic system.

98
00:07:19,874 --> 00:07:24,212
So this moment in
time will be encoded in here...

99
00:07:24,245 --> 00:07:27,147
and stored...

100
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:28,483
in here.

101
00:07:28,516 --> 00:07:30,685
- And this is stimulating?

102
00:07:30,718 --> 00:07:33,588
Intellectually, yes.

103
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:35,823
The hope is...

104
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:40,961
that we can retrieve this moment
with complete accuracy.

105
00:07:40,995 --> 00:07:44,332
Every detail, every sensation.

106
00:07:44,365 --> 00:07:50,071
We can return to this moment
in time, over, and over...

107
00:07:50,104 --> 00:07:52,707
and over.

108
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,609
This is your anniversary
present.

109
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,679
- Wow.

110
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:02,383
I got you a Bunsen burner.

111
00:08:07,822 --> 00:08:12,193
- Terry!
- Terry?

112
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:14,795
No!

113
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:40,822
- You really need to tell him
it's over. You've broken up.

114
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:42,923
- What are you doing here,
Terry?

115
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:44,959
- I thought you should know

116
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:46,794
that you left some
washing on your line.

117
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:50,297
- You drove
three hours to tell me that.

118
00:08:53,067 --> 00:08:55,570
- I submit these.

119
00:08:55,603 --> 00:08:58,439
Somebody could
have stolen them.

120
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:00,375
- Hey!

121
00:09:00,408 --> 00:09:04,612
Did she tell you that I threw
javelin at the Olympics?

122
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:08,215
Yea, I upset the establishment,

123
00:09:08,249 --> 00:09:11,419
with my politics,

124
00:09:11,452 --> 00:09:13,054
and my drug taking.

125
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:15,856
When they came to
take my medals from me...

126
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:21,261
I threw them, like a
javelin...off the balcony.

127
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:24,365
The officials got the medals...
- This has to stop Terry.

128
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,167
We broke up four years ago.

129
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,234
- Yeah, well now I am back.

130
00:09:29,337 --> 00:09:30,905
- This is unbelievable.
Every time, every time he ruins
it.

131
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:33,107
- It's a long drive, maybe he jt
needs to stretch his legs

132
00:09:33,141 --> 00:09:34,408
then he'll leave.

133
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:36,010
- What is he getting from the
car?

134
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:37,111
- His javelin.

135
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:38,880
- This is too much!

136
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:42,517
- And a pack of condoms
and some kind of cattle prod.

137
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,051
- What kind of stretch is this?
- Hey Lana!

138
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,954
Do you still have that
bifurcated dildo?

139
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:49,824
Or should I grab one from the
car?

140
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:52,559
- That was for him, not for...

141
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:54,795
- Okay, that's it!

142
00:10:00,802 --> 00:10:04,238
- Terry! Terry, no,
you will not ruin another
holiday!

143
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:13,281
- This is our chance.

144
00:10:13,314 --> 00:10:16,083
let's just...take these helmets.

145
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:19,454
Hop in the car.
We'll leave him here.

146
00:10:19,487 --> 00:10:24,058
Find a beach,
some cold beers...

147
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:27,895
a nice B & B.

148
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:32,900
- Lana!

149
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:36,070
Lana!

150
00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:42,443
You can take him,
and you can go to the beach,

151
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:45,346
but you can't take these.

152
00:10:47,548 --> 00:10:49,549
I never want to see you again.

153
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:50,851
- What? That's not funny.

154
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:53,187
- Yeah? What about
self immolation?

155
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,788
- Stop it!

156
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,590
- Is that funny? Setting myself
on fire?

157
00:10:56,624 --> 00:10:58,192
I don't have a lighter,

158
00:10:58,225 --> 00:10:59,526
I need to borrow
someone's lighter.

159
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,595
- Here.
- Don't! Stop it!

160
00:11:00,628 --> 00:11:02,429
- Fire! Fire!

161
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:05,399
I will do it, I swear I will!
I'm a man with nothing to lose!

162
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:07,435
- This is insane, Dean, what...

163
00:11:07,468 --> 00:11:10,438
What is that?
What is this stuff?

164
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:11,905
- It Is ginger wine...
- That's not...

165
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:13,273
- It's really sticking to my
skin...

166
00:11:13,307 --> 00:11:14,308
No!

167
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,310
No! Enough!
What the...

168
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:26,387
I don't think you appreciate
the things I do.

169
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,922
And you, you...

170
00:11:32,493 --> 00:11:33,727
- This jacket is inflammable.

171
00:11:35,596 --> 00:11:38,332
- Stop it!
Stop it!

172
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:50,144
- I never want to see
you again, just go.

173
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:51,946
Go, go on!

174
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:57,351
Go! Get Out of here!

175
00:12:04,358 --> 00:12:07,294
- Dean...

176
00:13:23,337 --> 00:13:26,307
ONE YEAR LATER

177
00:13:59,073 --> 00:14:04,444
- Happy Anniversary!
Guess where I am?

178
00:14:04,478 --> 00:14:09,216
Lana? Hello?

179
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:11,585
Lana, look, I know it's been
a year since we last spoke.

180
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:14,288
But I need to see you.

181
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:16,991
I heard you moved to the beach.

182
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:19,693
Maybe you thought
I'd just forget about you.

183
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:22,429
Well I haven't.

184
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:26,400
After you left, I stayed out
here...

185
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:29,069
I needed some time alone.

186
00:14:29,103 --> 00:14:32,840
Twelve months in our
old room. Thinking about stuff.

187
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:35,175
Trying to keep busy.

188
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,612
I don't believe I am a jealous
man,but I have been thinking...

189
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:43,784
about you and him,
and your...position.

190
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:48,655
I know I drove you away,
but I've been building
something.

191
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:49,890
I had some things
setup from the lab

192
00:14:49,924 --> 00:14:52,593
and I've been working on
something that I think

193
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:55,362
might take us back
to how things were.

194
00:14:57,765 --> 00:15:01,134
I think we should give
it one more go, please.

195
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:04,338
Things will be different this
time.

196
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:10,678
Look, no need to say anything.

197
00:15:10,711 --> 00:15:12,913
Just give me a sign.

198
00:15:33,334 --> 00:15:38,271
- Identifying instability
in a closed loop circuit.

199
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:43,376
Short the voltage source,
open the loop in the fourth
pass.

200
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,811
then apply a test signal

201
00:15:44,845 --> 00:15:47,915
and observe the gain
and phase around the loop.

202
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,585
Make sure the voltage source...
- Dean!

203
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:53,854
- Dean!

204
00:16:20,614 --> 00:16:23,116
- Hello.
- Hi.

205
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:26,053
Hello.

206
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:27,354
You look different.

207
00:16:27,388 --> 00:16:28,722
- Different?

208
00:16:28,756 --> 00:16:32,392
- More stable.
- I am. I'm very stable.

209
00:16:34,495 --> 00:16:35,829
I want us to try things again.

210
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:38,098
- Again?
- Please?

211
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:41,435
- I do not know if I can do tha.
- Why not?

212
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:43,137
Have you been with
him this last year?

213
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,940
- Isn't that what you wanted?
- What?

214
00:16:45,973 --> 00:16:51,078
No. I...I did so much for you.
We played songs. Dutch songs.

215
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:52,713
We ate dolmades!

216
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:55,081
I had planned some
very, very Tantric stuff,

217
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:56,583
it was going to be
the perfect day, and...

218
00:16:56,617 --> 00:16:59,086
- You threatened to set me on f.
- Yes, but prior to that...

219
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:01,088
- Then you called me a whore.
- Sounds better in French.

220
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:02,623
- And all Dutch folk
dancing in the world

221
00:17:02,656 --> 00:17:03,757
isn't going
to change that.

222
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,959
- Well no, that would be...

223
00:17:05,993 --> 00:17:08,395
Why would you even suggest it?

224
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:10,998
- Because you're wearing clogs.

225
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,335
- The clogs are incidental...

226
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:18,539
- See? You're doing it again.
It's going to be just like last
time.

227
00:17:18,572 --> 00:17:19,740
- No, not this time.

228
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:21,675
I am in control of
things now, I can change.

229
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,443
- Stop. I don't want
you controlling everything.

230
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:25,212
It always feels like your...

231
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:27,548
controlling me.

232
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:29,850
- I would never would control
you.

233
00:17:32,153 --> 00:17:36,790
Please, just tell me what I can.
- Nothing.

234
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:40,661
I made a mistake.
I'm sorry.

235
00:17:40,694 --> 00:17:44,231
If I could change I would, but
I can't, so we both just have
to...

236
00:17:44,265 --> 00:17:46,466
- What if I could?

237
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:50,437
Just wait here.

238
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,707
- Where are you going?
- To change out of these clogs.

239
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,275
I need shoes
for where we're going.

240
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:58,278
What about now
are you guys still...together?

241
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:03,516
- It's complicated.

242
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,153
- Good.

243
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:08,755
I can work with that.

244
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,928
- Dean!

245
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:19,433
What are you doing up there?

246
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,722
- Happy Anniversary.

247
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:46,860
- Is this why you got me out he?
- There's more.

248
00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:52,265
The ocean.

249
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:56,103
- I came straight from the beac.
- The beach?

250
00:18:58,071 --> 00:18:59,139
Why?

251
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:00,540
- I was worried
about you. You just...

252
00:19:00,574 --> 00:19:03,310
- About me?

253
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:07,380
- Does this mean you're
giving me a chance?

254
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:10,851
- Yes.
I'm giving you a chance.

255
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:15,322
- There's something
I want to show you.

256
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:20,427
- One year ago, we recorded
something onto this drive.

257
00:19:22,863 --> 00:19:26,266
Since then I've been
working a retrieval system.

258
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:31,171
Something to get
what's on here...

259
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:32,406
into here.

260
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:35,275
- And what is on there exactly?

261
00:19:37,778 --> 00:19:43,283
- The past. A point in time.
- Our anniversary weekend.

262
00:19:48,889 --> 00:19:52,893
- This will take us there.

263
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,103
- You still have the
Bunsen burner I gave you.

264
00:20:03,137 --> 00:20:07,707
- I've kept the flame
alive all this time.

265
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:10,010
- Is that even possible?

266
00:20:10,044 --> 00:20:16,983
- Changing the propane can be
difficult, but...it's
achievable.

267
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:37,638
- It wasn't the best
weekend though, was it?

268
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:39,906
- No, it wasn't.

269
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,876
- So why do you want to re-live
it?

270
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:49,383
- I do not want to re-live it...
I want to change it.

271
00:21:02,663 --> 00:21:05,131
- What?

272
00:21:05,165 --> 00:21:08,902
- Didn't you call ahead?
- There was no answer.

273
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:11,605
- Well, this would be why.

274
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:14,508
- I don't believe it!

275
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:17,076
At this time last year we were

276
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,646
playing musical
instruments over there...

277
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,848
Fine dining in there...

278
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:25,318
Adult activities upstairs...

279
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:29,456
I didn't know they closed down,
I am so sorry. I am stupid.

280
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:33,326
- Look, it doesn't matter.
Let's go to the beach instead.

281
00:21:34,995 --> 00:21:36,964
This is the past!

282
00:21:36,997 --> 00:21:39,599
This is...this is...

283
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:43,503
this is...definitely the...the
past!

284
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:47,974
- This was meant to be,
the perfect weekend and it
wasn't.

285
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:51,144
- No.
- But this time it will be. It
will be...

286
00:21:51,178 --> 00:21:53,479
perfect.

287
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:55,382
And when Terry arrives I will

288
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:56,850
knock him off the balcony
with his own javelin.

289
00:21:56,883 --> 00:22:00,087
You'll stay with me,
and she'll stay with him...

290
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,722
- We traveled
one year into the past

291
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:05,759
just so you can
hit Terry with a stick?

292
00:22:05,793 --> 00:22:08,528
- No. Well...
Yes, it was one of the reasons.

293
00:22:08,562 --> 00:22:10,430
But why would you
be defending him?

294
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:14,100
- I am not...
I am not defending him.

295
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:16,436
- I'll be in the car.
- No no!

296
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:19,139
- I'll be in the car.

297
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:26,780
- Not this time, please.

298
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:28,848
Just let me show you
what I have planned.

299
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:31,118
- Do you know where I'll be?

300
00:22:31,151 --> 00:22:34,587
Upstairs with these babies and
some fractionated coconut oil.

301
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,057
Massaging not masturbating!

302
00:22:39,893 --> 00:22:41,862
- This is a copy
of the original schedule.

303
00:22:41,895 --> 00:22:45,866
Marked up areas of
improvement, here, here and
here.

304
00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:47,801
Then we'll do the
whole thing again but this time,

305
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:50,170
we will do it right.
There will be better songs,

306
00:22:50,204 --> 00:22:52,739
more champagne
coitus uninterruptus.

307
00:22:52,773 --> 00:22:56,276
And then, see...the beach.
You and me. The schedule.

308
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:58,411
Now, was it a deep tissue
massage in the old room? Or...

309
00:22:58,444 --> 00:23:00,447
- I don't know.

310
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,148
- Well just look at the
schedule.

311
00:23:02,182 --> 00:23:03,984
- I thought things were
going to be different Dean.

312
00:23:04,017 --> 00:23:05,151
They will be! It's not
going to be like last time.

313
00:23:05,185 --> 00:23:06,586
- Lana!

314
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:11,391
Welcome! Glad you came back!

315
00:23:11,424 --> 00:23:13,993
I think it scrubs ok.

316
00:23:14,027 --> 00:23:17,096
I've bypassed the
main switch board.

317
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,399
- I found a mattress next door..
- Dean.

318
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:22,268
- Those sheets aren't washed...

319
00:23:22,302 --> 00:23:24,304
- And...the beach

320
00:23:25,672 --> 00:23:30,344
You came back!
- I found this in the car.

321
00:23:30,377 --> 00:23:33,013
- "Some additional notes
for the weekend, by Dean
Trilby."

322
00:23:33,046 --> 00:23:35,882
- They're just some random thou.
- ''Chapter One..."

323
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:37,684
"the history of pleasure."

324
00:23:37,717 --> 00:23:39,586
It's hardly a history.

325
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:44,057
- "Subsection A..."The Dawn of
Man" "

326
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:47,227
I know how much
this means to you.

327
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:53,333
So...let's take a look
at that anniversary suite.

328
00:24:09,215 --> 00:24:13,519
- Unfortunately our old
room is a bit of a mess. So...

329
00:24:13,553 --> 00:24:15,555
- It's different.

330
00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:20,993
- Yea, it is...different. Twice.

331
00:24:21,027 --> 00:24:23,196
Sorry, it was meant
to be an improvement.

332
00:24:23,229 --> 00:24:26,266
- Well, what are the other
agenda items?

333
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:29,836
Musical celebration
of your Dutch ancestry.

334
00:24:44,318 --> 00:24:45,318
- Yea...
- Hey!

335
00:24:49,022 --> 00:24:50,490
- There's supposed
to be Dutch folk music,

336
00:24:50,523 --> 00:24:51,924
and don't even
have a damn rummelpott.

337
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:54,628
- Shhh.
Can you hear that? Listen...

338
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:56,629
Where is that coming from?

339
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:25,325
- Shall we eat?

340
00:25:31,998 --> 00:25:34,867
- Well, what are our options?

341
00:25:34,901 --> 00:25:36,503
Hunting?

342
00:25:36,536 --> 00:25:39,272
Roadkill? Soil?

343
00:25:39,305 --> 00:25:42,175
Wait?

344
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,010
Is that?

345
00:25:44,044 --> 00:25:46,380
I could swear there's
lobster...

346
00:25:47,814 --> 00:25:51,851
- Lana, Lana!
Wait! Wait!

347
00:25:53,753 --> 00:25:57,323
Lana!
Lana!

348
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:00,860
It is lobster!

349
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:02,863
- In a white wine sauce!

350
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:04,698
I'am going to go upstairs

351
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:06,499
and go get your
anniversary present.

352
00:26:06,532 --> 00:26:09,235
Just wait here. Love you!
- I love you!

353
00:26:11,204 --> 00:26:12,572
Dean!

354
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:15,475
- What are you doing?
- Waiting for you?

355
00:26:15,508 --> 00:26:17,077
- Where's Dean?

356
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,812
- Upstairs, something about
cosmic consciousness.

357
00:26:18,845 --> 00:26:20,247
Are you planning
to have sex with her?

358
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,048
What? No!

359
00:26:22,082 --> 00:26:23,950
- Yes you are!
I remember you said you were

360
00:26:23,984 --> 00:26:25,585
going to get my
anniversary present.

361
00:26:25,618 --> 00:26:27,520
You were going
to have sex with her

362
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:28,755
and record it on your brain
thing.

363
00:26:28,788 --> 00:26:30,857
That is...I am not
planning to have sex with her.

364
00:26:30,891 --> 00:26:33,560
- Lana?

365
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:35,162
- Yea?

366
00:26:35,195 --> 00:26:38,298
- Sexual congress in five.

367
00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:41,701
- You said it really tough time.
- Yes, but what about me?

368
00:26:41,735 --> 00:26:43,770
- You both!

369
00:26:43,803 --> 00:26:45,839
- I traveled through time.
- I realize that.

370
00:26:45,872 --> 00:26:47,507
- Well, maybe I should just
go have sex with him.

371
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:50,577
Him and her?

372
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,045
- Firstly, that's a paradox.

373
00:26:52,078 --> 00:26:53,780
Second, legally...
like a threesome like that...

374
00:26:53,813 --> 00:26:55,281
- Well, maybe if it's
not to paradoxical

375
00:26:55,315 --> 00:26:58,352
we could have sex.

376
00:26:58,385 --> 00:26:59,619
- Me and you?

377
00:26:59,652 --> 00:27:03,723
- That's part of the...schedule.

378
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:14,767
- All my Tantra books
are in the other room.

379
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:17,137
It doesn't matter.

380
00:27:18,571 --> 00:27:20,340
- Do wish we
had the head pieces..

381
00:27:20,373 --> 00:27:21,408
- We don't need the head pieces.

382
00:27:21,441 --> 00:27:22,509
- It would just be better,
that's all.

383
00:27:22,542 --> 00:27:24,177
- Hey, just forget about the
books,

384
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,713
and the head pieces,
and everything else.

385
00:27:26,746 --> 00:27:31,350
Just close your eyes...
and put it out of your...

386
00:27:33,653 --> 00:27:36,322
Terry.

387
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:40,359
- Look at him.

388
00:27:40,393 --> 00:27:42,461
Look at his body.

389
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:44,530
- "The vessel for honorable use.
It's what he calls it.

390
00:27:44,564 --> 00:27:46,566
- You once said he was more...

391
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:49,402
athletic in bed?

392
00:27:49,436 --> 00:27:51,637
- Come on!
I am not going to talk about
this.

393
00:27:51,671 --> 00:27:53,339
- Please, we need to talk about
it.

394
00:27:53,372 --> 00:27:55,275
- Just different influences.

395
00:27:55,308 --> 00:27:58,078
Terry's approach to sex is
very...old Testament.

396
00:27:58,111 --> 00:28:00,313
You know, sword and
sandals, blood and guts.

397
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:02,015
- And what would you say are
my sexual influences?

398
00:28:02,048 --> 00:28:04,317
I do not know, do not
know!

399
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,319
Dialectical theater.

400
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:10,023
German philosophy.

401
00:28:10,056 --> 00:28:11,524
The metronome.

402
00:28:11,558 --> 00:28:13,225
Pythagoras.

403
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:17,697
- Pythagoras?
- Yea. It's just different.

404
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:20,800
- You want blood and guts,
I'll give you blood and guts.

405
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:22,535
- I want you to let it go.

406
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:23,603
- Twelve months
preparing for this moment.

407
00:28:23,637 --> 00:28:26,272
- Let it go.

408
00:28:33,213 --> 00:28:34,814
Five minutes?

409
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:36,916
I'll come back.
We'll go for a swim.

410
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:41,688
We'll catch some rays,
some sun, a few...

411
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:44,024
Please, just...wait here.

412
00:28:44,057 --> 00:28:47,861
Pythagoras...

413
00:28:57,103 --> 00:28:59,138
- I should say...

414
00:28:59,172 --> 00:29:04,177
that I didn't come here...stric.
on account of your underwear.

415
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,145
I had other business.

416
00:29:05,178 --> 00:29:06,912
- Does this too
involve my underwear?

417
00:29:06,946 --> 00:29:08,948
- Terry!

418
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:12,685
- Indirectly, yes.
- Terry...

419
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:21,995
- Your javelin.

420
00:29:22,028 --> 00:29:24,397
- We are working
ourselves into a cycle here.

421
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:27,500
- I just...want to hold the
javelin.

422
00:29:27,534 --> 00:29:29,769
- This javelin...

423
00:29:29,802 --> 00:29:32,572
It puts me in a line.

424
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:34,740
A long line...

425
00:29:34,774 --> 00:29:38,545
from Greek gods
to mortal men. Greek men.

426
00:29:38,578 --> 00:29:40,146
Please just give me the javelin.

427
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,748
- Dean. Just let him toss his
damn stick.

428
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:43,483
- Lana, wait please,
I am doing this for us.

429
00:29:43,516 --> 00:29:45,952
- This has nothing to do with
me.

430
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:59,565
- Not the window!

431
00:30:08,108 --> 00:30:11,077
- This is our chance.
Let's just take these helmets

432
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,346
Hop in the car.
We'll leave him here.

433
00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:15,982
Find a beach,
some cold beers...

434
00:30:16,015 --> 00:30:18,785
A nice B & B.

435
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,956
- I never want
to see you again!

436
00:30:22,989 --> 00:30:24,491
Go.

437
00:30:24,524 --> 00:30:26,993
Go! Get out of here!

438
00:30:32,565 --> 00:30:34,434
- Dean...

439
00:30:49,149 --> 00:30:50,883
- Lana.

440
00:30:53,353 --> 00:30:56,156
Lana, open up.

441
00:30:56,189 --> 00:30:59,592
Open the door.

442
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:03,396
Why did you do it? I thought...

443
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:06,399
I thought things were improving!

444
00:31:06,432 --> 00:31:10,370
Why him? I tried to stop it.

445
00:31:10,403 --> 00:31:13,840
I've tried so hard!

446
00:31:13,873 --> 00:31:16,409
I've traveled through time for
you!

447
00:31:16,442 --> 00:31:18,978
Who else would do that for you?

448
00:31:24,651 --> 00:31:28,188
Who are you?
- Shhh.

449
00:31:28,221 --> 00:31:31,991
Let's walk and talk.

450
00:31:38,431 --> 00:31:42,135
- Tell me. Who you are?

451
00:31:42,168 --> 00:31:44,837
- I'm from the future.

452
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,339
- My future?
- Yes.

453
00:31:46,372 --> 00:31:49,275
You know, I've worked to hard
for you to screw this up for me.

454
00:31:49,308 --> 00:31:51,077
- I want to see her.

455
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,978
- No. She doesn't
want to see you.

456
00:31:53,012 --> 00:31:53,780
- You told her she
doesn't want to see me?

457
00:31:53,813 --> 00:31:55,114
- Definitely implied.

458
00:31:55,148 --> 00:31:58,485
- I do not believe you.
- You should trust yourself.

459
00:31:58,518 --> 00:31:59,385
- There are things
I need to tell her.

460
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,419
- I've all ready told her.

461
00:32:00,453 --> 00:32:02,354
- I'll tell her myself.

462
00:32:02,388 --> 00:32:04,524
- What's the difference?

463
00:32:04,557 --> 00:32:06,059
- Okay, you know what I do?
- Yes, I do.

464
00:32:06,092 --> 00:32:07,226
- I'll go back to the present
I'll...

465
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:11,497
- No, no you can't,
that's not possible.

466
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:14,500
- You can't get her forever.

467
00:32:14,534 --> 00:32:16,536
And when you least expect it,

468
00:32:16,569 --> 00:32:18,904
when you've
forgotten I even exist...

469
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:20,974
That's when I will come.

470
00:32:21,007 --> 00:32:25,478
Because you may have her now,
but I have the element of
surprise.

471
00:32:31,684 --> 00:32:34,854
- What's that?
- Read it.

472
00:32:39,025 --> 00:32:41,761
- "You can't get her forever.
And when you least expect it,

473
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:44,130
when you've
forgotten I even exist...

474
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:46,599
That's when I will come.
Because you may have her now,

475
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:48,067
but I have the
element of surprise."

476
00:32:48,101 --> 00:32:50,003
- You'll try a few
more times in the next year,

477
00:32:50,036 --> 00:32:51,938
then in twelve months
you will do the sensible thing

478
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:54,073
and you will
travel back for her.

479
00:32:54,106 --> 00:32:55,175
- Twelve months?

480
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:56,943
- It worked for me.

481
00:33:07,053 --> 00:33:10,490
- You know she doesn't love you?
She loves him. Terry.

482
00:33:10,523 --> 00:33:13,259
- Not anymore.

483
00:33:13,293 --> 00:33:15,361
- Why? What did you do?
How did you do it?

484
00:33:15,395 --> 00:33:17,430
- Watch and learn.

485
00:33:17,463 --> 00:33:19,565
- This isn't fair I love her
too!

486
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:20,366
- Yeah.

487
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,902
Join the queue.

488
00:33:25,204 --> 00:33:27,106
- Just...

489
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,208
It's just...

490
00:35:13,012 --> 00:35:15,214
- Lana?

491
00:35:15,247 --> 00:35:17,116
I need you to listen to me.

492
00:35:17,149 --> 00:35:23,322
You are caught
in a very complicated...

493
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,832
- It was the only way.

494
00:35:32,865 --> 00:35:36,869
- I had no...
- I had to use a toilet.

495
00:35:36,902 --> 00:35:39,272
It's the only way
to keep you from her.

496
00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:42,408
- There are other ways...
- It was the only way.

497
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:46,145
- What about the lipstick?

498
00:35:46,178 --> 00:35:49,181
- It was the only way.

499
00:35:50,216 --> 00:35:53,352
- Don't. No.

500
00:36:19,144 --> 00:36:22,081
- Glad you could
meet me out here, Lana.

501
00:36:22,115 --> 00:36:25,318
I have a lot of
things I want to tell you.

502
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:31,123
You look worried. Don't be.

503
00:37:09,696 --> 00:37:11,564
- Dean!
Dean!

504
00:37:11,597 --> 00:37:13,032
Dean!

505
00:37:28,881 --> 00:37:32,986
- Traditional initiation
ceremonies...

506
00:37:33,019 --> 00:37:35,488
used to be...

507
00:37:35,521 --> 00:37:38,825
used to be...

508
00:37:38,858 --> 00:37:41,828
the male who was...

509
00:37:41,861 --> 00:37:44,697
inseminated with...

510
00:37:44,731 --> 00:37:47,367
females emissions.

511
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,035
Mixed with...

512
00:37:50,069 --> 00:37:53,506
with some semen...

513
00:37:53,539 --> 00:37:55,941
from the Guru.

514
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:46,725
- Happy Anniversary.

515
00:38:46,759 --> 00:38:48,260
Don't worry, I'm here to help.

516
00:38:48,293 --> 00:38:52,164
- When have you ever helped me?

517
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,600
- Look down there.

518
00:38:57,136 --> 00:38:59,205
Remember this?

519
00:38:59,238 --> 00:39:02,642
You went to call her.
Asked her to come out here.

520
00:39:02,675 --> 00:39:04,109
- Happy Anniversary!

521
00:39:06,812 --> 00:39:09,615
- What made her choose
someone like you, over me.

522
00:39:09,648 --> 00:39:11,250
- We're not that
different, you and me.

523
00:39:11,283 --> 00:39:12,718
- Then why? Why you?

524
00:39:12,751 --> 00:39:16,522
- I do not know,
maybe it's for your crying.

525
00:39:16,555 --> 00:39:18,390
- Stop it!

526
00:39:18,423 --> 00:39:22,861
Stop it!
- What I'am not crying...

527
00:39:22,895 --> 00:39:25,898
It's just...it's the
steam from the coffee.

528
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:28,868
- It is quite steamy coffee.

529
00:39:28,901 --> 00:39:33,205
- Just why you...
why you and not me?

530
00:39:33,238 --> 00:39:35,007
- I traveled back for her.

531
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,644
- And what if I went back for
her?

532
00:39:38,678 --> 00:39:41,948
Well, I guess
that would make you...

533
00:39:41,981 --> 00:39:45,318
me.

534
00:40:10,976 --> 00:40:13,479
- This is unbelievable.
Every time, every time he ruins
it.

535
00:40:13,512 --> 00:40:15,681
- It's a long drive, maybe he jt
needs to stretch his legs

536
00:40:15,715 --> 00:40:17,883
then he'll leave.

537
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:19,385
- What is getting from the car?
- His javelin.

538
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:21,386
- This is too much!

539
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,522
And a pack of condoms...

540
00:40:23,556 --> 00:40:26,292
and some kind of cattle prod.

541
00:40:26,325 --> 00:40:29,795
- What kind of stretch is this?
- Hey Lana?

542
00:40:29,828 --> 00:40:32,731
Do you still have
that bifurcated dildo?

543
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:35,367
Or should I grab one from the
car?

544
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,369
- That was for him, not for me.

545
00:40:37,403 --> 00:40:39,138
- Okay, that's it!

546
00:40:39,172 --> 00:40:41,140
- Dean!

547
00:40:55,554 --> 00:40:58,657
- I should say that I didn't
come here strictly on account...

548
00:40:58,691 --> 00:40:59,792
of your underwear.

549
00:40:59,825 --> 00:41:01,694
I have other business.

550
00:41:01,727 --> 00:41:03,495
- Does it still
involve my underwear?

551
00:41:03,529 --> 00:41:04,397
- Terry!

552
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:06,264
- Indirectly, yes.

553
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:08,067
- Terry!

554
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:13,805
- Your javelin.

555
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,040
- We are working
ourselves into a cycle...

556
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:18,978
- We are working
ourselves into a cycle here.

557
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:25,884
- Terry!

558
00:41:25,918 --> 00:41:28,554
What are you doing here?

559
00:41:28,587 --> 00:41:30,322
Here and there?

560
00:41:32,724 --> 00:41:35,861
- Science.

561
00:41:35,894 --> 00:41:38,530
I used your helmet.

562
00:41:38,564 --> 00:41:40,299
- When?

563
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:43,769
- In the future.

564
00:41:43,802 --> 00:41:45,737
- Dean. Just let him
toss his damn stick.

565
00:41:45,771 --> 00:41:47,840
- Lana, wait, please.
I am doing this for us.

566
00:41:47,873 --> 00:41:50,643
- This has nothing to do with
me.

567
00:41:50,676 --> 00:41:52,377
- Eros...

568
00:41:52,411 --> 00:41:54,379
and Psyche.

569
00:41:54,413 --> 00:41:55,848
History.

570
00:41:55,881 --> 00:41:59,918
It's all Mediterranean.
- Why did you come back?

571
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:01,420
- Well, you came back
and she came back,

572
00:42:01,453 --> 00:42:03,689
so I came back.

573
00:42:03,722 --> 00:42:06,291
I won't be excluded.

574
00:42:12,064 --> 00:42:14,366
- Not the window!

575
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:21,440
- Terry.

576
00:42:21,473 --> 00:42:23,275
Welcome to the future.

577
00:42:45,231 --> 00:42:47,399
- This can not be good.

578
00:42:49,735 --> 00:42:52,504
I've dreamt about this moment.

579
00:42:53,472 --> 00:42:55,908
Many Terry's.

580
00:42:57,276 --> 00:42:58,744
One Lana.

581
00:42:58,777 --> 00:43:00,946
Infinite sexual positions.

582
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:03,682
- No, there must be
a finite number positions.

583
00:43:03,715 --> 00:43:06,251
No. No there's no finite.

584
00:43:06,285 --> 00:43:09,488
No. I could not be here.
I could be there.

585
00:43:09,522 --> 00:43:12,291
And I could be with her.

586
00:43:14,459 --> 00:43:16,394
Gonorrhea.

587
00:43:16,428 --> 00:43:17,730
- Sorry?

588
00:43:17,763 --> 00:43:19,898
- It is Greek.

589
00:43:19,932 --> 00:43:22,168
It means "flow of seed".

590
00:43:22,201 --> 00:43:26,371
Gonos...rhea.

591
00:43:26,405 --> 00:43:29,742
Does my seed flow?

592
00:43:29,775 --> 00:43:32,945
- No. There can't be more!

593
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,816
- Where's Terry?

594
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:39,952
- Thank God!
I thought there were

595
00:43:39,985 --> 00:43:43,589
many, many, many Terry's.

596
00:43:43,622 --> 00:43:47,325
- This is our chance. Let's jus.
take these helmets, hop in the
car,

597
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,562
we'll leave him here.
Find a beach, some cold beers,

598
00:43:49,595 --> 00:43:53,031
a nice B & B.

599
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,902
- Me?

600
00:43:59,438 --> 00:44:04,242
You want to go
to the beach with me?

601
00:44:04,276 --> 00:44:05,944
- I do.

602
00:44:19,658 --> 00:44:22,294
- I'll meet you downstairs.

603
00:44:22,328 --> 00:44:24,897
- Okay.

604
00:44:27,466 --> 00:44:30,169
- I'm so sorry.

605
00:44:58,997 --> 00:45:01,266
- Look at him.

606
00:45:01,299 --> 00:45:03,469
That's the look of a winner.

607
00:45:03,502 --> 00:45:05,604
I've won.

608
00:45:05,637 --> 00:45:09,141
- But he's dead.
You've killed him.

609
00:45:10,142 --> 00:45:13,212
- Still the winner.

610
00:45:54,386 --> 00:45:56,322
- I'm sorry.

611
00:45:56,355 --> 00:45:58,490
I didn't know, I...

612
00:45:58,524 --> 00:46:01,927
I didn't know it was me.

613
00:46:03,228 --> 00:46:05,197
I'll tell you everything.

614
00:46:11,637 --> 00:46:15,274
I tried, more than once.

615
00:46:17,276 --> 00:46:20,345
Sometimes I just get
so angry with myself.

616
00:46:20,378 --> 00:46:21,647
My other selves.

617
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,382
I'm so sorry.

618
00:46:23,415 --> 00:46:26,752
- Hey, I know.

619
00:46:26,785 --> 00:46:29,187
- Plus, there was a second
Terry.

620
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,022
- A second Terry?

621
00:46:31,056 --> 00:46:32,824
- Yeah, he must
have traveled back.

622
00:46:32,857 --> 00:46:34,660
- Why?
- To be with you.

623
00:46:34,693 --> 00:46:36,495
- And where is he now?

624
00:46:36,529 --> 00:46:37,996
- He's dead.

625
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:40,732
- Dead?

626
00:46:44,803 --> 00:46:49,175
- Well he's not...he's not
going to take this very well.

627
00:46:49,208 --> 00:46:51,142
- We should tell him,
because he has to know...

628
00:46:51,176 --> 00:46:53,378
- No he all ready knows.
He did it himself.

629
00:46:53,412 --> 00:46:55,280
- He killed himself?

630
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:57,716
- His other self yeah.
- His other self? God.

631
00:46:57,749 --> 00:47:01,720
God it is so typical, it's
so...it's...

632
00:47:01,754 --> 00:47:05,924
It's theater. It's Greek
tragedy. That is what it is.

633
00:47:09,661 --> 00:47:13,364
You know he's not actually
Greek.

634
00:47:13,398 --> 00:47:17,703
- I did...I did not know that.

635
00:47:17,736 --> 00:47:21,373
- What does this mean exactly?
Is he alive or is he dead?

636
00:47:21,406 --> 00:47:24,309
- Well he's alive and dead.

637
00:47:24,343 --> 00:47:27,012
- What...what a sad man.

638
00:47:30,615 --> 00:47:33,985
- Well, it's just us now.

639
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:37,723
- Lana?

640
00:47:37,756 --> 00:47:40,892
Lana open up.

641
00:47:43,762 --> 00:47:45,697
- I understand every
relationship has it's problems,

642
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:47,099
but this...this is really...

643
00:47:47,132 --> 00:47:51,903
- I am sorry, just wait
here please I'll go talk to him.

644
00:47:53,872 --> 00:47:56,442
- I've traveled
through time for you.

645
00:47:56,475 --> 00:48:00,045
- Who else would do that for
you?

646
00:48:14,826 --> 00:48:17,462
- Is he watching us?

647
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:20,699
- He is.

648
00:48:20,733 --> 00:48:24,703
For one whole year
I did nothing but watch us.

649
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:28,707
- You watched us for a year?

650
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:33,312
- But we won't...we won't stay
here for a year, I mean...

651
00:48:33,345 --> 00:48:35,146
We can't.

652
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:38,149
- We did it.

653
00:48:38,183 --> 00:48:41,587
We were here...together.

654
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:44,089
We were happy.

655
00:48:44,122 --> 00:48:45,424
Why would you
want to change that?

656
00:48:45,457 --> 00:48:50,062
- I don't. I just...I just think
we would be happier...

657
00:48:50,095 --> 00:48:51,930
somewhere else.

658
00:48:51,964 --> 00:48:54,332
- Look. One year from now
he'll finish building the
device.

659
00:48:54,366 --> 00:48:57,069
Everyone will travel back,
and it will be just the two of
us.

660
00:48:57,102 --> 00:48:58,903
Then we can go
where ever we want,

661
00:48:58,937 --> 00:49:01,940
and not have to
worry about these...

662
00:49:01,974 --> 00:49:04,943
people.

663
00:49:04,976 --> 00:49:07,312
I know you like the beach,
just...

664
00:49:07,346 --> 00:49:09,848
Please trust me to get us
through this. I know what to do.

665
00:49:09,882 --> 00:49:12,284
I've all ready seen
us do it and it works.

666
00:49:12,317 --> 00:49:18,256
And I know in the meantime
we can be...happy here.

667
00:49:26,898 --> 00:49:28,733
- Not now.

668
00:49:31,402 --> 00:49:32,871
- It's only one year, and...

669
00:49:32,904 --> 00:49:37,709
and summer always flies
by, so it's like...nine months.

670
00:49:37,742 --> 00:49:39,712
Nine to twelve months.

671
00:49:39,745 --> 00:49:41,579
Twelve months.

672
00:49:41,613 --> 00:49:44,282
Then we can leave.

673
00:49:46,518 --> 00:49:52,324
- And what did we do exactly
for the next...twelve months?

674
00:50:01,566 --> 00:50:05,070
- Do you remember
our first actual date?

675
00:50:05,103 --> 00:50:07,372
- I do

676
00:50:07,406 --> 00:50:10,642
- I was nervous as hell.

677
00:50:10,675 --> 00:50:13,711
You were relaxed, talkative.

678
00:50:13,745 --> 00:50:15,881
Then I found your notes.

679
00:50:15,914 --> 00:50:17,782
Famous quotes, current affairs,
topics of conversation.

680
00:50:17,815 --> 00:50:20,318
- Art, music, science.

681
00:50:22,621 --> 00:50:26,024
- Do you remember
everything about that night?

682
00:50:26,057 --> 00:50:27,125
- Everything.

683
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:33,398
In fact, I recorded it on tape.

684
00:50:35,066 --> 00:50:36,535
I wanted to review it
after the date,

685
00:50:36,568 --> 00:50:38,369
and make sure
that I sounded natural.

686
00:50:38,403 --> 00:50:39,871
- "Obviously it relies on the

687
00:50:39,905 --> 00:50:42,708
presumption of male
hetrosexual spectatorship.

688
00:50:42,741 --> 00:50:45,110
Does that make
it a bad painting? No."

689
00:50:46,645 --> 00:50:48,247
"And...of course..."

690
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,381
"of course..."

691
00:50:50,415 --> 00:50:52,317
- "Dean, are you okay?"

692
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:55,420
- "And of course there's George
Brock..."

693
00:50:55,453 --> 00:50:57,756
Later I edited the tape,
I spliced in a few gags...

694
00:50:57,789 --> 00:50:59,290
Thing's I didn't think of at
the time.

695
00:50:59,324 --> 00:51:02,361
- "Getting Brock the
basics, you might say..."

696
00:51:04,262 --> 00:51:05,597
- That's not my laugh.

697
00:51:05,631 --> 00:51:09,000
- No, it's the closest I could
find.

698
00:51:09,968 --> 00:51:11,937
- You know what this is?
- What?

699
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:16,575
- Just...one big revision.

700
00:51:16,608 --> 00:51:18,243
- It's an improvement, it's
not...

701
00:51:18,276 --> 00:51:19,878
- Is this an improvement?

702
00:51:19,911 --> 00:51:21,880
- I would say so, yes.

703
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:26,751
- Because sometimes it
feels...a little unorthodox.

704
00:51:28,153 --> 00:51:30,789
- No...

705
00:51:30,822 --> 00:51:34,559
This is the modern world.

706
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:36,261
It's a modern relationship.

707
00:51:36,294 --> 00:51:38,496
- What are you doing?

708
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:42,634
- Going to the bathroom.

709
00:51:42,667 --> 00:51:45,237
To see if I can lure
a Dean into a cubical.

710
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:48,006
- See, I would say
that's a little "unorthodox".

711
00:51:48,039 --> 00:51:50,542
- Unorthodox.

712
00:51:50,575 --> 00:51:52,544
I am a man
responding to his environment.

713
00:51:52,577 --> 00:51:54,145
Have you got lipstick?

714
00:51:54,179 --> 00:51:56,848
- I don't want to say
that you're living in the past

715
00:51:56,882 --> 00:51:58,350
- Well obviously,
I am living in the past.

716
00:51:58,383 --> 00:51:59,651
- But, I mean...

717
00:51:59,684 --> 00:52:04,155
You say you fell disconnected.
- Shhh.

718
00:52:07,125 --> 00:52:10,195
- Maybe that's why...
you feel disconnected.

719
00:52:10,228 --> 00:52:13,097
Maybe if you just stop
listening and watching...

720
00:52:13,131 --> 00:52:14,967
- What about you?

721
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,501
- Well, what about me?
- I see the way you look at him.

722
00:52:16,534 --> 00:52:20,105
- It's the same way I look at
you.

723
00:52:20,138 --> 00:52:22,407
- Exactly.

724
00:52:22,441 --> 00:52:23,475
- So I do not want
me to look at you?

725
00:52:23,508 --> 00:52:24,642
- No. Him.
- Who?

726
00:52:24,676 --> 00:52:27,612
- Dean!

727
00:52:27,646 --> 00:52:30,115
- Are you jealous?

728
00:52:30,148 --> 00:52:32,117
- Should I be?

729
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:36,454
- I do not even know
how to answer that.

730
00:52:36,488 --> 00:52:38,757
- I used to watch us up here.

731
00:52:40,792 --> 00:52:44,763
I used to think we were happy.

732
00:52:44,796 --> 00:52:48,333
- We are happy.

733
00:52:48,366 --> 00:52:51,436
- We could be happier.

734
00:52:55,573 --> 00:52:59,477
- Why do you
hate yourself so much?

735
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:04,382
- Are you kidding? Look at him!

736
00:53:07,819 --> 00:53:10,055
Sorry. Just forget about it.

737
00:53:10,088 --> 00:53:12,190
Tomorrow everything
returns to normal.

738
00:53:12,223 --> 00:53:14,559
Everyone travels back.

739
00:53:14,592 --> 00:53:17,963
And we're alone. Together.

740
00:53:17,996 --> 00:53:20,265
We can...

741
00:53:20,298 --> 00:53:23,468
go where ever we want.

742
00:53:32,811 --> 00:53:34,345
This is the plan.

743
00:53:34,379 --> 00:53:35,680
We do not touch a thing.

744
00:53:35,714 --> 00:53:37,715
Everyone travels back,
just like they always have...

745
00:53:37,748 --> 00:53:39,985
and then we are alone. Okay?

746
00:53:40,018 --> 00:53:41,119
- Okay

747
00:53:41,152 --> 00:53:43,922
- Good. Okay.

748
00:53:46,992 --> 00:53:50,395
- Happy Anniversary.
Don't worry, I am here to help.

749
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:54,966
Okay, I was in the
bedroom, testing the amp.

750
00:53:54,999 --> 00:53:57,368
- Dean!
- You called out...

751
00:53:57,402 --> 00:53:59,871
I came down.

752
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:02,307
The other Lana, where is she.
She should be here by now.

753
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:03,575
- I do not know.

754
00:54:03,608 --> 00:54:04,810
- Well, this is
how it began, remember?

755
00:54:04,843 --> 00:54:05,977
With her down there.

756
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:07,378
- Well maybe...
- If Lana doesn't show,

757
00:54:07,412 --> 00:54:08,613
then Dean won't travel back...

758
00:54:08,646 --> 00:54:12,384
and if Dean doesn't
travel back, then...

759
00:54:12,417 --> 00:54:15,987
Things will get very
complicated.

760
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:21,259
You have to go down there.

761
00:54:21,293 --> 00:54:23,628
- What?

762
00:54:23,661 --> 00:54:25,296
- Yea. Until the other Lana
arrives, you have to go down
there

763
00:54:25,329 --> 00:54:29,067
and say all the things she said.
It has to be exactly the same.

764
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,602
- It's nuts, it won't work!
- It will work. It has to.

765
00:54:31,636 --> 00:54:33,471
It's the only way

766
00:54:33,504 --> 00:54:35,940
- But what if he
takes me back with him?

767
00:54:35,974 --> 00:54:37,743
- That's impossible,
it can't happen.

768
00:54:37,776 --> 00:54:40,145
You'll switch with the
other Lana before then...

769
00:54:40,178 --> 00:54:41,980
they'll travel back
and once they do...

770
00:54:42,013 --> 00:54:44,082
it's just you and me. It's
simple.

771
00:54:44,116 --> 00:54:48,119
- How will I even
know what to say?

772
00:54:56,861 --> 00:55:00,064
- Tape this to your chest.

773
00:55:00,097 --> 00:55:03,935
Put this in your ear.

774
00:55:06,437 --> 00:55:08,907
And I'll tell you
exactly what to say.

775
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:12,343
- You tell me what to say? No
no.

776
00:55:12,376 --> 00:55:17,882
- Not tell, remind. Your words.
I am just reminding you.

777
00:55:20,552 --> 00:55:23,721
Testing, testing.

778
00:55:25,891 --> 00:55:30,194
It is the only way
to ensure they travel back.

779
00:55:30,228 --> 00:55:33,565
- And how do I know which one
is him and which one is you?

780
00:55:33,598 --> 00:55:37,369
Just listen to your heart.

781
00:55:37,402 --> 00:55:42,207
Also, listen to the
ear piece and will tell you.

782
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:46,911
- Okay, stop there.

783
00:55:46,944 --> 00:55:49,180
Now call out his name twice.

784
00:55:49,214 --> 00:55:52,884
- Dean!
Dean!

785
00:55:56,254 --> 00:55:58,690
- Ok, good. Now...

786
00:55:58,723 --> 00:55:59,791
He is going to come to you,

787
00:55:59,824 --> 00:56:02,961
just stay there and
repeat what I say.

788
00:56:02,994 --> 00:56:06,831
- This is insane.
This isn't going to work.

789
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:10,301
- Shhh. Here he comes.

790
00:56:14,939 --> 00:56:15,840
- Hello

791
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:16,440
- Hi.

792
00:56:16,474 --> 00:56:17,441
- Hello.

793
00:56:17,475 --> 00:56:18,843
- You look...different.

794
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:19,944
- You look different.

795
00:56:19,978 --> 00:56:20,545
- Different?

796
00:56:20,578 --> 00:56:21,646
- More stable.

797
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:25,383
- I am. I'm very stable.

798
00:56:25,417 --> 00:56:26,484
I want us to try things again.

799
00:56:26,518 --> 00:56:27,252
- Again?

800
00:56:27,285 --> 00:56:28,887
- Please?

801
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,056
- I do not know if I can do
that.

802
00:56:31,089 --> 00:56:32,223
- Why not? Have you been
with him this last year?

803
00:56:32,257 --> 00:56:34,058
- Isn't that what you wanted?

804
00:56:34,092 --> 00:56:36,294
- What? No!

805
00:56:36,328 --> 00:56:40,098
I did so much for you.
We played songs, Dutch songs.

806
00:56:40,131 --> 00:56:41,565
We ate dolmades!

807
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:43,534
I had plans for
very, very tantric stuff,

808
00:56:43,568 --> 00:56:44,869
It was going
to be the perfect day...

809
00:56:44,903 --> 00:56:47,739
- You threatened to set me on
fire.

810
00:56:47,772 --> 00:56:48,706
- Yes, but prior to that...

811
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:51,342
- Then you called me a whore.

812
00:56:51,375 --> 00:56:53,344
- It sounds better in French...

813
00:56:53,378 --> 00:56:56,214
- And all Dutch folk dancing ine
world isn't going to change
that.

814
00:56:56,247 --> 00:56:57,648
- Well no, that would be...

815
00:56:57,682 --> 00:56:58,950
Why would you even suggest it?

816
00:56:58,983 --> 00:57:02,953
- Because you're wearing clogs.

817
00:57:02,987 --> 00:57:05,557
- The clogs are incidental...

818
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:09,427
- See? You're doing it again.
It's going to be just like last
time.

819
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:11,062
- No, not this time.

820
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:11,962
I am in control of
things now, I can change.

821
00:57:11,996 --> 00:57:13,464
- Stop!

822
00:57:13,498 --> 00:57:15,499
- I don't want you
controlling everything.

823
00:57:15,533 --> 00:57:16,868
It always feels like
you're controlling me.

824
00:57:18,669 --> 00:57:21,172
- I would never control you.

825
00:57:24,442 --> 00:57:26,277
Please, just tell me what I can
do.

826
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:27,345
- Nothing.

827
00:57:27,379 --> 00:57:30,048
I made a mistake.

828
00:57:30,081 --> 00:57:33,184
I'm sorry. If I could change it
I would, but I can't, so...

829
00:57:33,217 --> 00:57:36,287
- What if you could?

830
00:57:36,321 --> 00:57:37,221
- Just wait here.

831
00:57:37,254 --> 00:57:38,823
- Where are you going?

832
00:57:38,856 --> 00:57:41,392
- To change out of these clogs.

833
00:57:41,426 --> 00:57:43,761
- I need shoes for
where we're going.

834
00:57:43,795 --> 00:57:46,464
- What about now
are you guys still...together?

835
00:57:46,497 --> 00:57:49,600
- It's complicated.

836
00:57:49,634 --> 00:57:51,902
- Good.

837
00:57:51,936 --> 00:57:54,038
- I can work with that.

838
00:58:06,684 --> 00:58:10,355
- Lana, where is she?
She should be here by now.

839
00:58:11,823 --> 00:58:12,723
Where are you going?

840
00:58:12,757 --> 00:58:14,659
To change out of these clogs.

841
00:58:14,692 --> 00:58:16,060
I need shoes for
where we're going.

842
00:58:16,094 --> 00:58:17,628
What about now
are you guys still together?

843
00:58:17,662 --> 00:58:19,130
It's complicated.

844
00:58:19,163 --> 00:58:20,665
Dean, what are you doing?

845
00:58:20,699 --> 00:58:24,135
- Dean, what are you
doing up there?

846
00:58:24,169 --> 00:58:25,870
- I'm just trying to...

847
00:58:25,903 --> 00:58:29,007
- Wait, which Dean
are you talking to?

848
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:33,345
Lana, please. You need to
listen to me. Do not kiss him.

849
00:58:33,378 --> 00:58:37,115
Lana, please!

850
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:07,612
No, no, no, you can not travel
back!

851
00:59:07,645 --> 00:59:09,547
Lana, do you hear me?

852
00:59:09,581 --> 00:59:10,381
You can not travel back.
It's not possible.

853
00:59:10,415 --> 00:59:12,616
It's not possible.

854
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:14,485
Lana! It's not possible.

855
00:59:14,519 --> 00:59:16,521
It's not possible.

856
00:59:16,554 --> 00:59:18,089
- It wasn't the best
weekend, though, was it?

857
00:59:18,122 --> 00:59:19,690
- No, it wasn't.

858
00:59:19,724 --> 00:59:22,393
- So why do you want to re-live
it?

859
00:59:22,427 --> 00:59:25,129
- I don't want to re-live it.

860
00:59:25,162 --> 00:59:27,699
- I want to change it.

861
00:59:44,148 --> 00:59:46,818
- Lana...

862
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:50,788
Think! Think, think...

863
01:00:11,675 --> 01:00:14,578
- I met you...at X...

864
01:00:14,612 --> 01:00:18,883
We traveled back...
one year...to Y.

865
01:00:18,916 --> 01:00:22,520
We stayed for one year...

866
01:00:22,553 --> 01:00:26,757
at which point, you met him at
X...

867
01:00:26,791 --> 01:00:30,428
and traveled back one year...

868
01:00:30,461 --> 01:00:32,997
to Y.

869
01:00:44,809 --> 01:00:47,812
No, not now Terry!
I have to go.

870
01:00:48,746 --> 01:00:50,882
- Can you feel this?

871
01:00:50,915 --> 01:00:53,751
I am in the
business of energy fields.

872
01:00:53,785 --> 01:00:56,287
Man is frequency.

873
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,722
Hologram bracelets.

874
01:00:58,756 --> 01:00:59,924
I have a suitcase full of them.
They are an investment in the
future.

875
01:00:59,957 --> 01:01:02,060
- What are you doing here Terry?

876
01:01:02,093 --> 01:01:04,529
- Terry...

877
01:01:04,562 --> 01:01:06,097
Terry's dead.

878
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:09,033
I tried to get him to a
hospital, but...

879
01:01:09,066 --> 01:01:11,268
he suffocated in the sports bag.

880
01:01:11,302 --> 01:01:12,803
- I'm sorry.

881
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:13,738
- I had to bury him...

882
01:01:13,771 --> 01:01:15,740
in a salt pan.

883
01:01:15,773 --> 01:01:18,243
And ever since then,
I've been driving

884
01:01:18,276 --> 01:01:20,512
in my car looking for her.

885
01:01:20,545 --> 01:01:23,448
And, spreading
the word, making some...

886
01:01:23,481 --> 01:01:26,250
Why not, right? I'm on the road.

887
01:01:28,386 --> 01:01:30,088
I miss her.

888
01:01:30,121 --> 01:01:31,222
- I know.

889
01:01:31,255 --> 01:01:33,091
- I love her.

890
01:01:33,124 --> 01:01:34,959
- So do I.

891
01:01:34,992 --> 01:01:40,098
- Sometimes when I masturbate,
I imagine myself as her.

892
01:01:40,131 --> 01:01:41,499
Masturbating...

893
01:01:41,532 --> 01:01:44,135
to a picture of me.

894
01:01:45,470 --> 01:01:47,272
- I'm sorry.

895
01:01:47,305 --> 01:01:50,241
- No, no, these are facts.
I do not want your sympathy.

896
01:01:50,274 --> 01:01:52,576
- She's gone Terry.

897
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:54,479
- Where?

898
01:01:54,512 --> 01:01:56,580
- Don't know.

899
01:01:56,614 --> 01:01:57,848
She's stuck in
some kind of temporal loop.

900
01:01:57,882 --> 01:01:58,916
She's just going around,

901
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:00,484
and around,
and around, and around.

902
01:02:00,518 --> 01:02:04,889
- Temporal. Jesus.

903
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:10,594
How does it work? Your science?

904
01:02:10,628 --> 01:02:14,332
Can you take me to her?

905
01:02:14,365 --> 01:02:16,601
- Why yes.

906
01:02:16,634 --> 01:02:21,539
But you've seen what will
happen?

907
01:02:21,572 --> 01:02:24,775
Is that what you want?

908
01:02:24,809 --> 01:02:29,313
- What I want is for the sun
to exhaust it's full and die.

909
01:02:29,347 --> 01:02:31,582
- But in the short term?

910
01:02:31,616 --> 01:02:34,952
- Even then.

911
01:02:34,985 --> 01:02:39,223
- Well...

912
01:02:39,257 --> 01:02:42,493
if that's what you want.

913
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,670
- Before it happens...

914
01:02:52,703 --> 01:02:54,471
I do get to see her again.

915
01:02:54,505 --> 01:02:57,341
Don't I? One more time?

916
01:02:57,374 --> 01:03:00,278
- Yes.

917
01:03:01,946 --> 01:03:05,182
- Okay then.

918
01:03:22,399 --> 01:03:27,238
- I'll just be...over there.

919
01:04:03,274 --> 01:04:04,909
- This is our chance.
let's just...take these helmets.

920
01:04:04,942 --> 01:04:06,277
Hop in the car.
We'll leave him here.

921
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:11,115
Find a beach,
some cold beers, a nice B & B.

922
01:04:13,917 --> 01:04:16,854
- Me?

923
01:04:16,887 --> 01:04:19,957
- You want to go to
the beach with me?

924
01:04:21,392 --> 01:04:23,427
- I do.

925
01:04:28,232 --> 01:04:30,267
- I'll meet you downstairs.

926
01:04:30,301 --> 01:04:32,370
- Okay.

927
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:37,074
- I'm so sorry.

928
01:04:43,014 --> 01:04:44,515
- Look at him.

929
01:04:46,316 --> 01:04:49,086
That's the look of a winner.

930
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:51,589
I've won.

931
01:04:51,622 --> 01:04:56,193
- But he's dead.
You've killed him.

932
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:58,129
Still a winner.

933
01:05:36,167 --> 01:05:39,370
- I never want to
see you again. Just go.

934
01:05:41,005 --> 01:05:43,207
Go, go on!

935
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:47,745
Go, get out of here!

936
01:05:51,649 --> 01:05:53,818
- Dean...

937
01:05:56,687 --> 01:06:00,892
Shit! He has taken the keys.

938
01:06:00,925 --> 01:06:03,060
- Could you drop
me off at the bus station?

939
01:06:03,093 --> 01:06:05,862
- I can take you
all the way if you want.

940
01:06:05,896 --> 01:06:10,367
- Geographically or sexually?

941
01:06:10,401 --> 01:06:13,671
- Does one preclude the other?

942
01:06:13,704 --> 01:06:15,105
- Either way. I'am going
to need petrol money...

943
01:06:15,138 --> 01:06:17,307
- Bus station is fine.

944
01:06:17,341 --> 01:06:19,944
- Lana!

945
01:06:22,747 --> 01:06:25,749
I love you, Lana.

946
01:06:25,783 --> 01:06:27,818
- I know you do Terry...

947
01:06:27,851 --> 01:06:31,255
but we dated for two weeks.

948
01:06:31,288 --> 01:06:34,859
And that was four years ago.

949
01:06:34,892 --> 01:06:37,328
Well, I think...

950
01:06:37,361 --> 01:06:40,397
it was never made clear to me
that we had actually broken up.

951
01:06:40,431 --> 01:06:45,402
- Well, I'm sorry about that.

952
01:06:47,538 --> 01:06:51,109
- Apology accepted.

953
01:06:51,142 --> 01:06:54,745
- Okay, Terry.

954
01:07:15,966 --> 01:07:17,935
- Lana!

955
01:07:20,204 --> 01:07:21,305
Lana, wait!

956
01:07:22,973 --> 01:07:26,510
Thank you! Thanks for stopping!

957
01:07:26,544 --> 01:07:27,778
- We didn't stop.

958
01:07:27,812 --> 01:07:30,748
- We ran out of petrol.

959
01:07:30,781 --> 01:07:34,819
- Lana. I am sorry. I was
jealous.

960
01:07:34,852 --> 01:07:36,387
Okay, I thought you were
cheating on me with him.

961
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:38,589
It sounds silly now, but I did,

962
01:07:38,622 --> 01:07:39,723
and I imagined you in
every conceivable position

963
01:07:39,756 --> 01:07:41,625
The Viennese Oyster,
Congress of the Cow,

964
01:07:41,659 --> 01:07:43,995
Depressed Elephant,
and it drove me nuts.

965
01:07:44,028 --> 01:07:48,031
And I kept coming back to this
place. These positions, and...

966
01:07:48,065 --> 01:07:50,267
then I got jealous of myself,
and I created a very strange
loop.

967
01:07:50,301 --> 01:07:54,539
But I think if we leave now
we can break that loop. You
just...

968
01:07:54,572 --> 01:07:56,674
Just hop in my car.

969
01:07:56,707 --> 01:07:59,543
We'll leave from here.
We'll find a beach...

970
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:01,646
Some cold beers...
- Depressed Elephant?

971
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:02,980
- It's when the woman...
- Lana!

972
01:08:03,013 --> 01:08:04,515
- Look, Terry and
I did a lot of things.

973
01:08:04,548 --> 01:08:06,717
- Abstract sexual things.
- We experimented.

974
01:08:06,751 --> 01:08:07,785
- Why not?
You're young, you're free.

975
01:08:07,818 --> 01:08:09,087
- Maybe we did the
Depressed Elephant.

976
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:10,621
- I can show you evidence.
Photographic evidence.

977
01:08:10,654 --> 01:08:11,855
- It was years ago!

978
01:08:11,889 --> 01:08:13,490
- We're having some time apart.
- It was over!

979
01:08:13,524 --> 01:08:15,993
- Recharging the batteries.
- Finished! Many, many years
ago.

980
01:08:16,026 --> 01:08:17,862
- Even if it wasn't, I am cool..
- Stop trying to please me!

981
01:08:17,895 --> 01:08:21,232
- Done. Stop. I am sorry.

982
01:08:26,037 --> 01:08:27,504
- I am going to walk to the
station.

983
01:08:27,537 --> 01:08:29,907
- Great! I love the station.

984
01:08:32,676 --> 01:08:34,444
- My god my hand!
- Jesus! Dean!

985
01:08:34,478 --> 01:08:37,948
Jesus! Dean, Dean, Dean!

986
01:08:37,981 --> 01:08:40,317
- Okay, let me look, let me
look, let me...

987
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:45,856
Okay. I'll just...

988
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:51,095
- What is that?

989
01:08:52,930 --> 01:08:54,165
- Nothing.

990
01:08:54,198 --> 01:08:56,300
The wind.

991
01:08:56,333 --> 01:08:58,602
- Inside your boot?
- Yeah.

992
01:08:58,635 --> 01:09:00,103
Anyway, there wasn't even a
sound.

993
01:09:02,306 --> 01:09:03,807
Excuse me.

994
01:09:04,875 --> 01:09:06,977
- Dean, where are you going?

995
01:09:07,011 --> 01:09:09,379
- I am going to the beach!
No. Please, please.

996
01:09:09,413 --> 01:09:10,947
- Lana!

997
01:09:10,981 --> 01:09:12,116
- What?

998
01:09:12,149 --> 01:09:13,951
- I'am going to get him to a
hospital.

999
01:09:13,985 --> 01:09:16,587
- Great! Thank you! Thank you!

1000
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:18,588
See? He is offering help.

1001
01:09:18,622 --> 01:09:20,290
- I know. I'm so sorry.

1002
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:23,426
- So he'll go get petrol, and
then we'll get the car started.

1003
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:25,963
Okay, he is insistent, but...

1004
01:09:25,996 --> 01:09:29,433
he also has the capacity for
real acts of kind...

1005
01:09:38,309 --> 01:09:40,577
- Okay, hey, we need
to get you to a hospital.

1006
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:43,881
- No.

1007
01:09:43,914 --> 01:09:47,451
You just get me to
the nearest coastal area.

1008
01:09:47,484 --> 01:09:49,686
- Okay

1009
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:53,023
- Thank you.

1010
01:09:59,396 --> 01:10:01,932
ONE YEAR LATER

1011
01:10:51,448 --> 01:10:53,150
- Happy Anniversary.

1012
01:10:56,854 --> 01:10:59,389
- Why are you wearing that
dress?

1013
01:10:59,423 --> 01:11:02,993
- I...I thought you liked it.

1014
01:11:04,528 --> 01:11:07,364
- No, please, take it off.

1015
01:11:07,398 --> 01:11:11,135
...you take it off.

1016
01:11:16,707 --> 01:11:17,608
- It's the phone.

1017
01:11:17,641 --> 01:11:20,811
- Yeah, just...forget about it.

1018
01:11:22,346 --> 01:11:25,249
- It could be important.

1019
01:11:33,824 --> 01:11:37,227
- Happy Anniversary!
Guess where I am?

1020
01:11:37,261 --> 01:11:41,799
Lana? Hello?

1021
01:11:41,832 --> 01:11:44,134
Lana, look, I know it's been
a year since we last spoke.

1022
01:11:44,167 --> 01:11:46,704
But I need to see you.

1023
01:11:46,737 --> 01:11:49,673
I heard you moved to the beach.

1024
01:11:49,706 --> 01:11:52,109
Maybe you thought
I'd just forget about you.

1025
01:11:52,142 --> 01:11:54,010
Well I haven't.

1026
01:11:54,044 --> 01:11:56,981
After you left, I stayed out
here...

1027
01:11:57,014 --> 01:11:59,783
Think I needed some time alone.

1028
01:11:59,817 --> 01:12:03,487
Twelve months in our old room,
thinking about stuff.

1029
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:05,923
Trying to keep busy.

1030
01:12:05,956 --> 01:12:09,193
I don't believe I am a jealous
man,but I have been thinking...

1031
01:12:09,226 --> 01:12:14,198
about you and him,
and your...position.

1032
01:12:16,266 --> 01:12:18,568
I know I drove you away,
but I've been building
something.

1033
01:12:18,602 --> 01:12:19,870
I had some things
setup from the lab

1034
01:12:19,904 --> 01:12:22,473
and I've been working on
something that I think

1035
01:12:22,506 --> 01:12:25,809
might take us back
to how things were.

1036
01:12:25,843 --> 01:12:29,846
I think we should give
it one more go, please.

1037
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:32,983
Things will be different this
time.

1038
01:12:33,017 --> 01:12:36,187
Look, no need to say anything.

1039
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:39,790
Just give me a sign.

1040
01:12:47,264 --> 01:12:49,133
- Who was it?

1041
01:12:49,166 --> 01:12:51,368
- I do not know.

1042
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:57,641
I have to go.

1043
01:12:57,674 --> 01:12:58,909
- Why?

1044
01:12:58,942 --> 01:13:00,543
- I thought we were safe.

1045
01:13:00,577 --> 01:13:02,612
It's something I built.

1046
01:13:02,645 --> 01:13:05,249
A closed loop system it's...

1047
01:13:05,282 --> 01:13:07,317
...it's unstable.

1048
01:13:07,351 --> 01:13:10,754
- Dean... It's our anniversary.
Just do it tomorrow.

1049
01:13:10,787 --> 01:13:13,724
- I just need to open the loop.

1050
01:13:13,757 --> 01:13:17,161
Identify the instability.

1051
01:13:17,194 --> 01:13:19,363
And if I find you there...

1052
01:13:19,396 --> 01:13:21,831
I'll save you from it.

1053
01:13:21,865 --> 01:13:24,067
- But...I'm right here.

1054
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:27,404
- You are, but that doesn't
mean you are not there too.

1055
01:13:27,437 --> 01:13:30,374
Lord knows I am
- Wait!

1056
01:13:53,731 --> 01:13:58,935
- Identifying instability
in a closed loop circuit.

1057
01:13:58,968 --> 01:14:01,638
Short the voltage source...

1058
01:14:01,671 --> 01:14:04,875
open the loop in the forth pass

1059
01:14:04,908 --> 01:14:06,777
then apply the test signal

1060
01:14:06,811 --> 01:14:09,746
and observe the gain
and phase around the loop.

1061
01:14:26,229 --> 01:14:28,298
Short the voltage source...

1062
01:14:28,332 --> 01:14:30,834
and open the loop.
- Dean!

1063
01:14:30,867 --> 01:14:32,970
Dean!

1064
01:14:57,060 --> 01:14:57,794
- Hello.

1065
01:14:57,827 --> 01:14:59,262
- Hi.
- Hi. Hello.

1066
01:14:59,295 --> 01:15:02,766
- You look different.

1067
01:15:04,034 --> 01:15:05,569
- Different?

1068
01:15:05,602 --> 01:15:06,970
- More stable.
- I am. I'm very stable.

1069
01:15:07,004 --> 01:15:08,705
I want us to try things again.

1070
01:15:08,738 --> 01:15:09,739
- Again?
- Please?

1071
01:15:09,773 --> 01:15:11,709
- I don't think I can do that.

1072
01:15:11,742 --> 01:15:13,376
- Why not? Have you been
with him this last year?

1073
01:15:13,410 --> 01:15:15,112
- Isn't that what you wanted?

1074
01:15:15,145 --> 01:15:16,546
- What? No, I did so much for
you

1075
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:17,247
We played songs. Dutch songs.

1076
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,082
We ate dolmades!

1077
01:15:19,115 --> 01:15:20,884
I had planned some
very, very Tantric stuff,

1078
01:15:20,918 --> 01:15:22,352
it was going to be
the perfect day, and...

1079
01:15:22,386 --> 01:15:24,321
- You threatened to set me on f.
- Yes, but prior to that...

1080
01:15:24,355 --> 01:15:25,655
- Then you called me a whore.
- Sounds a lot better in
French...

1081
01:15:25,689 --> 01:15:27,324
- And all Dutch
folk dancing in the world

1082
01:15:27,357 --> 01:15:29,359
is not going
to change that.

1083
01:15:29,392 --> 01:15:31,328
- Well no, that would be...
Why would you suggest that?

1084
01:15:31,361 --> 01:15:32,562
- Because you're wearing clogs.

1085
01:15:32,596 --> 01:15:34,498
- The clogs are incidental...

1086
01:15:34,531 --> 01:15:36,333
- See? You're doing it again.
It's going to be just like last
time.

1087
01:15:36,366 --> 01:15:37,735
- No, not this time. I am in col
of things now. I can change...

1088
01:15:37,768 --> 01:15:39,236
- Stop. I don't want you
controlling everything.

1089
01:15:39,269 --> 01:15:40,970
It always feels like
your controlling me.

1090
01:15:41,004 --> 01:15:42,573
I would never control you.
Please. Tell me what I can do?

1091
01:15:42,606 --> 01:15:44,107
- Nothing.

1092
01:15:44,141 --> 01:15:45,676
I made a mistake.

1093
01:15:45,709 --> 01:15:47,744
I'm sorry.

1094
01:15:47,778 --> 01:15:48,912
If I could change it, I would,

1095
01:15:48,945 --> 01:15:51,581
but I can't, so we
just both have to...

1096
01:15:51,615 --> 01:15:53,383
- What if I could?

1097
01:15:53,416 --> 01:15:55,385
Please just wait here.

1098
01:15:57,153 --> 01:15:58,322
- Where are you going?

1099
01:15:58,355 --> 01:16:00,057
- To change out of these clogs.

1100
01:16:00,090 --> 01:16:01,825
I need shoes for
where we're going.

1101
01:16:01,859 --> 01:16:03,594
What about now are you
guys still together?

1102
01:16:03,627 --> 01:16:05,495
- It's complicated.

1103
01:16:05,529 --> 01:16:07,164
- Good. I can work with that.

1104
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:12,269
- Dean, stop.

1105
01:16:12,302 --> 01:16:15,238
That's enough.

1106
01:16:15,271 --> 01:16:16,639
- What are you doing?

1107
01:16:16,673 --> 01:16:19,009
- I am going home.

1108
01:16:19,042 --> 01:16:22,713
You've lost me! I have no idea
what the fuck is going on.

1109
01:16:24,247 --> 01:16:25,815
- I'm just...

1110
01:16:25,848 --> 01:16:27,384
I'm just trying to help you!

1111
01:16:27,417 --> 01:16:29,018
- This isn't helping. This is...

1112
01:16:29,052 --> 01:16:30,754
I don't know.
I don't know what this is...

1113
01:16:30,787 --> 01:16:33,123
- Lana wait. Do you feel like
you've been here before?

1114
01:16:33,157 --> 01:16:35,191
- Constantly.
- No, I mean this exact moment?

1115
01:16:35,225 --> 01:16:37,794
- Dean!

1116
01:16:37,827 --> 01:16:41,298
What are you doing up there?

1117
01:16:53,343 --> 01:16:55,078
- Where did she come from?

1118
01:16:55,111 --> 01:16:58,048
- She came straight from the
beach.

1119
01:16:58,082 --> 01:17:00,250
- The beach.

1120
01:17:05,755 --> 01:17:08,825
You followed me from the beach?

1121
01:17:08,859 --> 01:17:10,393
- I did.

1122
01:17:10,426 --> 01:17:11,662
- Why?

1123
01:17:11,695 --> 01:17:13,230
- I was worried about you.
You just...

1124
01:17:13,263 --> 01:17:15,098
- About me?

1125
01:17:15,132 --> 01:17:18,034
Does this mean that you're me
giving another chance?

1126
01:17:18,067 --> 01:17:19,135
- Yes.

1127
01:17:19,168 --> 01:17:20,503
- No.

1128
01:17:20,536 --> 01:17:22,339
- No?

1129
01:17:22,372 --> 01:17:24,007
- I do love you Dean.

1130
01:17:24,041 --> 01:17:26,310
I love you too! I love so
much!

1131
01:17:26,343 --> 01:17:28,211
- I know.

1132
01:17:28,245 --> 01:17:31,114
But it's not in a way
that I can really see working.

1133
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:34,718
- What? I can make it work
this...

1134
01:17:34,751 --> 01:17:38,255
I mean, we've been
through a rough patch, but...

1135
01:17:38,288 --> 01:17:39,255
Please...

1136
01:17:39,289 --> 01:17:40,257
Lana, please.

1137
01:17:40,290 --> 01:17:41,491
- I have to go.

1138
01:17:41,524 --> 01:17:43,693
I have to get out of these
clothes.

1139
01:17:43,726 --> 01:17:46,463
- I love you in that dress!

1140
01:17:47,864 --> 01:17:51,201
- Why do you have to
make things so complicated?

1141
01:17:52,736 --> 01:17:54,538
- I was just trying to make it
better.

1142
01:17:54,571 --> 01:17:58,709
- Yeah? But what about
flowers, or a box of
chocolates...

1143
01:17:58,742 --> 01:18:01,678
- That would have been simpler.

1144
01:18:06,249 --> 01:18:09,252
I do love you though.

1145
01:18:11,521 --> 01:18:15,258
- But I just can't endure it.

1146
01:18:25,468 --> 01:18:29,839
- I understand
You have to go. Yeah...

1147
01:18:29,873 --> 01:18:32,342
It's me.

1148
01:18:32,375 --> 01:18:35,645
I know it's me.

1149
01:18:35,678 --> 01:18:36,880
Here. Inside here I don't think

1150
01:18:36,914 --> 01:18:39,683
I ever believed
you really loved me.

1151
01:18:39,716 --> 01:18:43,653
- Why? Why would you think that?

1152
01:18:43,686 --> 01:18:48,191
- I do not know.

1153
01:18:48,224 --> 01:18:51,661
I'm just going
through some stuff. Yeah?

1154
01:18:51,695 --> 01:18:55,499
But I'm trying to get better.

1155
01:18:55,532 --> 01:19:00,170
And if I do, if I do get better
then I'll come back for you.

1156
01:19:00,203 --> 01:19:02,372
- But not now.

1157
01:19:04,608 --> 01:19:07,244
- No, not now.

1158
01:19:07,277 --> 01:19:10,113
- It might take some time.

1159
01:19:13,717 --> 01:19:16,285
- But I'll come back for you.

1160
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:18,355
- Okay.

1161
01:19:49,519 --> 01:19:50,787
- Lana!
