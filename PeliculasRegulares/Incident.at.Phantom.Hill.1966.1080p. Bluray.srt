1
00:02:22,303 --> 00:02:24,218
Yee-haw!

2
00:02:33,401 --> 00:02:36,666
Whoo-haw!

3
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:01,561
Whoo-haw!

4
00:03:26,151 --> 00:03:27,544
Hyah! Hyah!

5
00:04:28,563 --> 00:04:31,870
Whoo-haw!

6
00:04:32,001 --> 00:04:33,872
Yee-haw.

7
00:04:40,576 --> 00:04:42,926
But it's been six weeks
since the surrender, sir.

8
00:04:43,056 --> 00:04:45,145
How long must our boys remain
in your prison camps?

9
00:04:45,276 --> 00:04:47,409
We can't just
turn them loose, Mr. Cole.

10
00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:48,888
We have to arrange
transportation, food--

11
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:50,455
Then arrange it, sir.

12
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,569
By heaven, had the victory
been ours--

13
00:04:52,805 --> 00:04:54,894
When may I see
General Good?

14
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,269
I'll tell him
you're here.
Excuse me.

15
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:58,898
Captain Martin,
right this way.

16
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:01,534
The general's
expecting you.

17
00:05:02,154 --> 00:05:04,025
Captain Martin, sir.

18
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,805
Captain, I'm a busy man,
so I'll get right
to the point.

19
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,887
I have a job here
I think may interest you.

20
00:05:13,461 --> 00:05:15,499
This chest
is all that's left

21
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:18,766
of a million-dollar
gold shipment
lost at Phantom Hill.

22
00:05:25,317 --> 00:05:29,539
One of our patrols found it
right about here,

23
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:31,632
20 miles
from Phantom Hill.

24
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,625
And the gold
from that chest
and 19 others like it

25
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,000
is hidden out there,
somewhere.

26
00:05:38,131 --> 00:05:39,393
How do you know
the gold

27
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:41,246
never reached
the Confederacy,
General?

28
00:05:41,483 --> 00:05:43,615
We have
General Lee's word,

29
00:05:43,827 --> 00:05:45,829
and he is an honorable
man, Captain.

30
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:50,625
Here. Take
a look at that.

31
00:05:55,826 --> 00:05:57,654
Joseph Henry Barlow.

32
00:05:58,061 --> 00:06:00,020
He was one of the Rebs
at Phantom Hill.

33
00:06:00,343 --> 00:06:02,678
A few weeks after the raid,
he was captured.

34
00:06:02,703 --> 00:06:05,053
He knows where the gold is.
He's finally admitted it.

35
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:08,451
But what's more important,
he's agreed
to lead us to it.

36
00:06:08,562 --> 00:06:09,181
Why?

37
00:06:09,206 --> 00:06:10,947
Because we have something
he wants.

38
00:06:10,972 --> 00:06:12,496
It's all in there.

39
00:06:13,012 --> 00:06:15,580
Before the war,
he was serving
a life term in prison

40
00:06:15,605 --> 00:06:17,303
for murdering
a federal marshal
in Texas.

41
00:06:19,126 --> 00:06:20,040
I see.

42
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:23,675
And in exchange
for a pardon,

43
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,397
he volunteered to join
the Reb army.

44
00:06:25,422 --> 00:06:27,641
That's right.
But now the war is over,

45
00:06:27,772 --> 00:06:29,531
we could send him
right back
to prison again,

46
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:30,992
but we made
a deal with him.

47
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:34,435
The United States
Government will recognize
that Reb pardon

48
00:06:34,682 --> 00:06:36,336
if he leads us to the gold.

49
00:06:37,325 --> 00:06:39,762
There's just one thing you
forgot to mention, General.

50
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:43,615
Phantom Hill is right
in the middle
of the Staked Plains,

51
00:06:44,162 --> 00:06:46,208
and the Staked Plains
are part of the territory

52
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:47,757
the government
just gave to the Comanches.

53
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,131
And under the treaty,

54
00:06:49,156 --> 00:06:51,724
the Army is forbidden
to set foot in that country.

55
00:06:54,216 --> 00:06:56,610
That's why this meeting
is unofficial, Captain.

56
00:06:56,741 --> 00:06:58,873
That's why you're to forget
this conversation

57
00:06:59,004 --> 00:07:00,353
the minute you leave
this office.

58
00:07:00,483 --> 00:07:03,051
And that's why, provided
you accept this assignment,

59
00:07:03,287 --> 00:07:04,941
you'll be completely
on your own.

60
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,272
And if anything
goes wrong,

61
00:07:06,508 --> 00:07:08,641
the United States Army
and the federal government

62
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,189
will deny
they ever heard of you.

63
00:07:13,654 --> 00:07:15,961
What would I do for men
and supplies?

64
00:07:20,137 --> 00:07:23,215
This will buy you
all the equipment
you need.

65
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,019
As for men,
you'll find them waiting
for you at Hays City.

66
00:07:28,774 --> 00:07:30,906
Well, do you
want this job,
Captain Martin?

67
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,424
You know I do, sir.

68
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:36,973
Yes, I know you do.

69
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,412
I'm very sorry
about your brother.

70
00:07:40,437 --> 00:07:42,396
He was a fine officer.

71
00:07:42,526 --> 00:07:45,355
We lost a lot of good men
at Phantom Hill.

72
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:49,166
Well, at least I hope you'll have the
satisfaction of completing his mission.

73
00:07:53,276 --> 00:07:54,147
Thank you, sir.

74
00:07:55,691 --> 00:07:56,692
Good luck.

75
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:02,202
Oh, Captain,
don't forget.

76
00:08:02,678 --> 00:08:04,027
Barlow is a killer.

77
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:21,479
? Look away

78
00:08:21,504 --> 00:08:26,895
? Look away
look away, Dixieland ?

79
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,357
? I wish I was in Dixie

80
00:08:43,676 --> 00:08:44,721
Let's get out of here.

81
00:08:44,746 --> 00:08:47,096
Excuse me. Excuse me.

82
00:08:47,768 --> 00:08:49,857
Oh!

83
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:55,601
When are you gonna
let me out of this thing?

84
00:08:55,838 --> 00:08:57,013
When I'm through
with you.

85
00:08:57,038 --> 00:08:58,343
Ha, ha.

86
00:09:01,844 --> 00:09:02,932
Just relax.

87
00:09:02,957 --> 00:09:04,088
You'll be a free man
in a couple of weeks.

88
00:09:04,219 --> 00:09:05,568
Free, yeah,

89
00:09:05,593 --> 00:09:07,944
but it ain't gonna be
like I figured it would.

90
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:10,921
Well, a man can't have
everything, Barlow.

91
00:09:11,052 --> 00:09:12,444
A man can try.

92
00:09:12,575 --> 00:09:14,142
Oh, hey, come on back.

93
00:09:14,272 --> 00:09:15,621
The war's over.

94
00:09:15,752 --> 00:09:19,060
You gotta come back,
big boy. [ laughs ]

95
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:27,391
He got away!

96
00:10:27,521 --> 00:10:28,522
Hey, what's
going on there?

97
00:10:28,653 --> 00:10:30,176
Stop the train.

98
00:11:02,793 --> 00:11:05,100
You're right handy
with a shooting iron,
ain't you?

99
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,301
Don't try that again,
Barlow.

100
00:11:07,432 --> 00:11:08,999
I don't want
to have to kill you.

101
00:11:09,024 --> 00:11:10,896
Not yet, anyway.

102
00:11:11,131 --> 00:11:12,089
That's right.

103
00:11:12,219 --> 00:11:13,829
Not yet, anyway.

104
00:11:13,854 --> 00:11:17,684
Well, let's not worry
about it till
the time comes, huh?

105
00:11:17,921 --> 00:11:20,113
Meanwhile, you still
got your hand

106
00:11:20,175 --> 00:11:22,596
and I still ain't got
no holes in my hide.

107
00:11:22,621 --> 00:11:26,495
So no hard feelings,
huh, Captain?

108
00:11:32,632 --> 00:11:34,025
No hard feelings.

109
00:11:40,857 --> 00:11:43,730
All right.
Hold it, fellas.

110
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,123
What's it mean,
Sheriff?

111
00:11:45,253 --> 00:11:46,602
It means
exactly what it says.

112
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:47,647
Army's got no right.

113
00:11:47,777 --> 00:11:48,953
How you gonna hunt buffalo

114
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,084
if you can't get
where the buffalo are at?

115
00:11:50,215 --> 00:11:51,651
All right now.
Break it up. Come on.

116
00:11:51,781 --> 00:11:53,348
Come on.
Get out of here.

117
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:54,871
Break it up, boys.

118
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,892
Afternoon, gentlemen.

119
00:12:15,023 --> 00:12:17,964
Afternoon. We'd like
a room for two.

120
00:12:18,635 --> 00:12:20,159
Sign the register,
please.

121
00:12:20,816 --> 00:12:23,079
25. Up the stairs
at the end of the hall.

122
00:12:23,104 --> 00:12:24,018
Thank you.

123
00:12:29,777 --> 00:12:31,126
Mr. Martin?

124
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,042
I'm Adam Long.

125
00:12:36,107 --> 00:12:37,412
I think you two
know each other.

126
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:39,588
Well, I guess
you could say we met.

127
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:42,199
We didn't take time
to introduce ourselves

128
00:12:42,224 --> 00:12:44,139
that day
at Phantom Hill, did we?

129
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,291
I'm Joe Barlow.

130
00:12:46,421 --> 00:12:48,467
I guess you understand
there was nothing personal

131
00:12:48,492 --> 00:12:50,103
in that roughing up
we gave you.

132
00:12:50,444 --> 00:12:52,359
How many men
do you have
with you, Long?

133
00:12:52,384 --> 00:12:53,733
There's four of us.

134
00:12:53,863 --> 00:12:55,363
- Only four?
- That's right.

135
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,544
Where are they?

136
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,043
Krausman and O'Rourke are
down at the livery stable.

137
00:12:59,068 --> 00:13:00,740
Dr. Hanneford's
at his hotel.

138
00:13:00,765 --> 00:13:02,332
- Dr. Hanneford?
- That's right.

139
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:03,917
We haven't any use
for a doctor.

140
00:13:03,942 --> 00:13:05,876
I was told
to ask for volunteers.

141
00:13:05,901 --> 00:13:07,714
I wasn't told
to reject anyone.

142
00:13:09,511 --> 00:13:11,682
All right. Have the men
at the livery stable
at 8:30 tonight.

143
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:12,664
Yes, sir.

144
00:13:15,084 --> 00:13:16,172
Let's go.

145
00:13:23,452 --> 00:13:25,193
- Sheriff.
- Hi, Charlie.

146
00:13:30,556 --> 00:13:31,818
Sit down.

147
00:13:48,878 --> 00:13:50,358
Forget it, Barlow.

148
00:13:56,257 --> 00:13:59,819
Anybody ever tell you
you got a mean
and suspicious nature?

149
00:13:59,844 --> 00:14:01,106
Yep.

150
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:04,581
And no sense
of justice, either.

151
00:14:05,353 --> 00:14:06,354
None at all.

152
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:10,010
It ain't like
I stole the gold.

153
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:12,404
It was captured
by the Confederacy.

154
00:14:12,429 --> 00:14:14,953
Legitimate spoils of war,
that's what it was.

155
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,558
Only there ain't
no more Confederacy,

156
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,325
so I got just as much right
to that gold as anybody,

157
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,112
including the United States
Government.

158
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:26,375
It might pay you to
think about that, Captain.

159
00:14:31,924 --> 00:14:33,190
- Who is it?
- Open up.

160
00:14:34,203 --> 00:14:35,465
It's Sheriff Drum.

161
00:14:41,868 --> 00:14:43,174
What's this?

162
00:14:43,305 --> 00:14:45,916
You signed the register
Matthew Martin.

163
00:14:46,046 --> 00:14:48,049
Is there a law
against a man
giving his real name?

164
00:14:48,151 --> 00:14:49,591
- Is it?
- It is.

165
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,984
Where you from, Martin?

166
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:52,837
Depends on
where I was last.

167
00:14:53,178 --> 00:14:54,615
This man
a friend of yours?

168
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,169
What difference
does it make?

169
00:14:57,194 --> 00:14:59,022
It might make a lot
of difference, mister.

170
00:14:59,493 --> 00:15:01,768
I might have
to take you in, too,

171
00:15:01,975 --> 00:15:03,581
for helping
an escaped convict.

172
00:15:03,606 --> 00:15:04,998
- Get your hands up, Barlow.
- Now, wait a minute--

173
00:15:05,023 --> 00:15:06,503
Hold it!

174
00:15:06,633 --> 00:15:08,983
Maybe you don't
remember me, Reb.

175
00:15:09,114 --> 00:15:12,204
I was a guard at the federal
prison in Austin, Texas,

176
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,529
when you started serving
a life sentence

177
00:15:14,554 --> 00:15:16,077
for the murder
of a U.S. Marshal.

178
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:20,038
So that's the burr
under your saddle.

179
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:23,346
Well, this'll set
your mind at ease, Sheriff.

180
00:15:23,582 --> 00:15:25,236
It's a full pardon

181
00:15:25,261 --> 00:15:27,393
from the governor
of the state of Texas,

182
00:15:27,524 --> 00:15:30,005
given to me in exchange
for volunteering

183
00:15:30,151 --> 00:15:33,453
to serve in the Army
of the Confederate States
of America.

184
00:15:33,969 --> 00:15:34,649
Hey.

185
00:15:34,674 --> 00:15:37,466
The U.S. Government doesn't
recognize any Reb pardon.

186
00:15:37,491 --> 00:15:39,500
- What do you mean--
- Joe.

187
00:15:40,252 --> 00:15:42,602
Sheriff, there must be some
way of working this out.

188
00:15:42,627 --> 00:15:44,691
There's nothing to work out.
I got a pardon.

189
00:15:44,716 --> 00:15:46,982
Relax, Joe.
Just relax.

190
00:15:47,762 --> 00:15:50,584
Look, Sheriff, do you have to
make an issue out of this?

191
00:15:50,978 --> 00:15:53,148
The war's over.
Why not let bygones be bygones?

192
00:15:53,173 --> 00:15:57,315
I still don't like Rebs, and I don't
want them around my town.

193
00:15:57,946 --> 00:15:59,774
Well, then
you got no problem.

194
00:16:00,061 --> 00:16:02,612
Joe and I are pulling out first thing
in the morning for Santa Fe.

195
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:04,730
Santa Fe?

196
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:05,973
Yeah, that's right.

197
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:07,956
We're, uh, we're starting
a freight line there.

198
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,198
All right.

199
00:16:13,003 --> 00:16:15,505
All right, I'm gonna
do you boys a favor.

200
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:18,490
You be out of Hays City
by 7:00 tomorrow morning

201
00:16:18,948 --> 00:16:20,820
and I'll forget
I ever saw you.

202
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,803
Don't forget,
7:00 in the morning.

203
00:16:33,156 --> 00:16:34,332
That was easy.

204
00:16:36,112 --> 00:16:37,287
Too easy.

205
00:16:40,995 --> 00:16:43,128
When you men volunteered
for this mission,

206
00:16:43,153 --> 00:16:45,373
you were told your
destination was Santa Fe.

207
00:16:47,481 --> 00:16:48,918
Well, that's not true.

208
00:16:50,349 --> 00:16:52,351
We're going out
on the Staked Plains.

209
00:16:55,136 --> 00:16:57,362
Well, I can see you're all
familiar with 'em.

210
00:16:57,387 --> 00:16:59,793
Why in the devil are we going
to that land of Satan?

211
00:16:59,923 --> 00:17:01,882
We're going after gold,
O'Rourke,

212
00:17:01,941 --> 00:17:04,074
$1 million in gold
that the United
States Government

213
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:05,970
lost to the Rebs
at Phantom Hill.

214
00:17:07,911 --> 00:17:10,416
And Mr. Barlow's
gonna lead us to it.

215
00:17:10,712 --> 00:17:12,547
Captain, the Staked Plains
are 100 miles--

216
00:17:12,572 --> 00:17:15,719
100 miles inside the new Indian
treaty lands, Doctor. I know.

217
00:17:16,531 --> 00:17:18,613
That's why we're going
as civilians.

218
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:20,223
If the Army was caught
violating the treaty,

219
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,119
it could lead to a general
Indian uprising.

220
00:17:22,355 --> 00:17:24,662
So once we leave here,
we're on our own.

221
00:17:25,035 --> 00:17:27,429
From now on, I want you
to forget you're soldiers.

222
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,798
If we get picked up
by a military patrol,

223
00:17:29,823 --> 00:17:31,787
we'll be considered
deserters.

224
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:34,204
If we're caught
by the Indians,
it's our funeral.

225
00:17:36,118 --> 00:17:37,250
Is that understood?

226
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,133
Krausman? O'Rourke?

227
00:17:41,158 --> 00:17:42,551
I get it.

228
00:17:42,681 --> 00:17:45,205
One more thing.
You'll all wear sidearms.

229
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,058
- I--
- That includes you, Doctor.

230
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:50,841
Like me, you'll each carry just
two shells in the chamber.

231
00:17:51,342 --> 00:17:54,631
Since we won't be able to keep
Mr. Barlow under lock and key at all times,

232
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:57,354
he might be tempted
to appropriate somebody's gun.

233
00:17:57,591 --> 00:17:59,854
If he did, he might be able
to kill two of us,

234
00:17:59,976 --> 00:18:02,414
but that'd leave him with an
empty gun and three men.

235
00:18:02,447 --> 00:18:04,006
Six bullets
still against him.

236
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:06,971
I want us on the road
by 7:00 in the morning.

237
00:18:28,318 --> 00:18:30,320
Put a little lift
into it now, lads.

238
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:37,371
Ah. You wouldn't have
a wee spot

239
00:18:37,396 --> 00:18:39,162
for the bite of the snake
in there, would you, Doc?

240
00:18:39,198 --> 00:18:40,771
All right,
let's roll.

241
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:42,709
Mr. Martin.

242
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:47,967
I hope you have
a nice trip to Santa Fe.

243
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:49,967
Thanks, Sheriff.

244
00:18:49,992 --> 00:18:52,169
You know, Martin,
a man does a favor,

245
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,301
he kind of expects
a favor in return.

246
00:18:54,432 --> 00:18:55,868
Doesn't that
seem fair to you?

247
00:18:56,937 --> 00:18:58,004
Depends.

248
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:01,066
Well, you know, the westbound
stages aren't running

249
00:19:01,091 --> 00:19:02,526
because of that new treaty.

250
00:19:02,551 --> 00:19:05,565
It means changing the routes,
setting up new relay stations.

251
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:08,088
Be a couple of weeks now before
things get back to normal.

252
00:19:08,753 --> 00:19:09,659
So?

253
00:19:10,026 --> 00:19:11,807
So I've got a passenger
for you.

254
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:12,770
A passenger?

255
00:19:12,795 --> 00:19:14,365
That's right,
for Santa Fe.

256
00:19:14,602 --> 00:19:16,255
Sorry, Sheriff,
we don't have any room.

257
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,648
- Make room.
- Now, look--

258
00:19:17,673 --> 00:19:20,128
You make room in your wagon
for my passenger,

259
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:24,206
or I'll make room
in my jail
for Joe Barlow.

260
00:19:24,784 --> 00:19:28,003
Now, it's exactly
two minutes
to 7:00, Martin.

261
00:19:35,097 --> 00:19:37,187
Where is your passenger?

262
00:19:37,212 --> 00:19:39,568
Waiting across the street
in front of the hotel.

263
00:19:41,377 --> 00:19:42,552
Adam.

264
00:19:55,712 --> 00:19:56,917
Her?

265
00:19:58,018 --> 00:19:59,846
You gotta be kidding,
Sheriff.

266
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,388
Martin,
there are some things

267
00:20:01,413 --> 00:20:03,284
I don't have
much of a sense
of humor about.

268
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:05,330
One of them is Rebs

269
00:20:05,461 --> 00:20:07,027
and another
is women like that.

270
00:20:07,052 --> 00:20:09,465
This is gonna be a long, hard trip.
How do you expect me to put up with a...

271
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:10,640
Oh, don't worry
about that.

272
00:20:10,665 --> 00:20:12,163
Memphis
is used to traveling.

273
00:20:12,293 --> 00:20:14,296
She made all the camps.

274
00:20:14,321 --> 00:20:15,307
That's great.

275
00:20:15,332 --> 00:20:17,144
And you're asking me
to take her to Santa Fe.

276
00:20:17,275 --> 00:20:18,885
I'm not asking you
to take her

277
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,216
any more than I'm asking her
to leave Hays City.

278
00:20:21,241 --> 00:20:24,128
I'm telling you,
telling you both.

279
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:25,825
Now, come on.

280
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:31,542
Krausman, O'Rourke.

281
00:20:38,843 --> 00:20:40,235
Memphis,
this is Mr. Martin.

282
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:41,541
Ma'am.

283
00:20:41,777 --> 00:20:43,605
I talked Martin
and his friends

284
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,719
into letting you travel
to Santa Fe with them.

285
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,417
Well, that was real nice
of you, Sheriff.

286
00:20:51,735 --> 00:20:52,954
Shall we go, ma'am?

287
00:20:52,979 --> 00:20:54,221
Why not?

288
00:20:54,746 --> 00:20:56,966
Put the lady's luggage
in the wagon.

289
00:20:57,253 --> 00:20:58,628
Good-bye, Memphis.

290
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,519
Oh, I'm not gonna say
good-bye, Carter,

291
00:21:01,755 --> 00:21:04,366
'cause I'm coming back
to Hays City someday.

292
00:21:04,391 --> 00:21:06,331
Oh, I wouldn't
like that a bit.

293
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,308
I'm coming back
and make you

294
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,864
and everyone else
in this rotten town

295
00:21:10,889 --> 00:21:13,935
crawl on their hands and
knees to apologize to me.

296
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,674
Six of you, huh?

297
00:21:28,776 --> 00:21:30,392
That should make
for an interesting time

298
00:21:30,417 --> 00:21:31,897
between here
and Santa Fe.

299
00:21:32,132 --> 00:21:33,518
Very interesting.

300
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:35,213
All right,
let's get ready to roll.

301
00:21:39,645 --> 00:21:41,603
You don't have anything
to worry about.

302
00:21:41,741 --> 00:21:43,903
Worry? After what
I've seen and done,

303
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,669
I don't know
how to spell the word.

304
00:21:45,694 --> 00:21:47,087
Now, where do I ride?

305
00:21:47,217 --> 00:21:48,305
Up there, Miss, uh...

306
00:21:48,436 --> 00:21:50,394
Just Memphis.
No last name.

307
00:21:50,813 --> 00:21:53,409
Mother was the kind
that never asked questions.

308
00:21:57,837 --> 00:21:59,360
Easy now, darling.

309
00:21:59,854 --> 00:22:01,549
That's the way.

310
00:22:02,189 --> 00:22:03,625
Sit right down.

311
00:22:10,719 --> 00:22:12,939
Git-up.
Git-up.

312
00:22:33,198 --> 00:22:35,151
- Pull up, O'Rourke.
- Whoa.

313
00:22:35,223 --> 00:22:36,808
Krausman,
ride up and tell Long

314
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:38,356
we're stopping
for 15 minutes.

315
00:22:53,807 --> 00:22:55,636
At the rate we're going
the last two days,

316
00:22:55,661 --> 00:22:57,707
we should be in Santa Fe soon,
shouldn't we?

317
00:22:58,534 --> 00:23:01,119
- Don't you worry about it.
- Well, shouldn't we?

318
00:23:04,775 --> 00:23:07,082
- Something wrong?
- No.

319
00:23:07,588 --> 00:23:09,049
You're lying.

320
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:13,081
Mr. Barlow tells me
we're not going to Santa Fe.

321
00:23:13,106 --> 00:23:15,057
But you'll get there, all right.
How?

322
00:23:15,737 --> 00:23:17,440
Gonna be stopping for water
at a trading post

323
00:23:17,676 --> 00:23:18,982
in about three days.

324
00:23:19,007 --> 00:23:21,688
It's run by a man named Brant.
He has a freight line to Santa Fe.

325
00:23:21,713 --> 00:23:22,557
He'll take you there.

326
00:23:22,582 --> 00:23:24,081
Do you mean
you're gonna leave me and...

327
00:23:24,106 --> 00:23:26,456
You'll be as safe with him as
you are with us, believe me.

328
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:28,205
Believe you?

329
00:23:28,425 --> 00:23:31,799
Look, Martin, I've known
men like you all my life,

330
00:23:31,948 --> 00:23:34,370
men who have no respect
for anyone.

331
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,276
Carter Drum
runs me out of town,

332
00:23:36,301 --> 00:23:37,519
you help him,

333
00:23:37,544 --> 00:23:39,289
and then you dump me off
like a sack of potatoes

334
00:23:39,314 --> 00:23:41,708
in the middle of
God knows where.

335
00:23:42,049 --> 00:23:45,574
Two-bit captain
or tin-horn sheriff,

336
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:47,724
you're all alike.

337
00:24:37,696 --> 00:24:41,047
Shh.
I want to talk to you.

338
00:24:41,072 --> 00:24:42,464
What about?

339
00:24:42,638 --> 00:24:45,946
A million dollars in gold.
Over there.

340
00:25:05,377 --> 00:25:07,988
Now, what's this about
a million dollars in gold?

341
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:09,903
It's what
the captain's after.

342
00:25:10,034 --> 00:25:11,296
You want to hear
about it?

343
00:25:11,378 --> 00:25:12,728
Well, I'm listening,
aren't I?

344
00:25:23,743 --> 00:25:25,571
If I hadn't been captured
by the Yanks,

345
00:25:25,701 --> 00:25:27,747
I'd be a rich man
by now.

346
00:25:27,772 --> 00:25:29,338
Why are you
telling me this?

347
00:25:29,681 --> 00:25:32,205
You're a smart girl.
You'll figure it out.

348
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,840
So what do you
want me to do?

349
00:25:33,971 --> 00:25:36,234
I'll let you know
when the time comes.

350
00:25:36,364 --> 00:25:37,626
Interested?

351
00:25:37,761 --> 00:25:40,068
There's just
one more thing.

352
00:25:40,093 --> 00:25:41,971
How do you know
it's still there?

353
00:25:42,293 --> 00:25:44,077
That's a good question.

354
00:25:45,852 --> 00:25:47,244
I'll tell you how he knows.

355
00:25:48,856 --> 00:25:50,858
A Reb officer
and six enlisted men

356
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:53,682
made off with the gold after
the fight at Phantom Hill.

357
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,995
That was the last that was seen
of the gold or the men,

358
00:25:57,792 --> 00:25:59,284
except for Barlow.

359
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:01,390
Remember that, Memphis.

360
00:26:01,521 --> 00:26:03,828
He's the only one
who came back.

361
00:26:14,229 --> 00:26:15,578
Aah!

362
00:26:36,731 --> 00:26:38,254
Krausman!

363
00:26:38,385 --> 00:26:41,362
No. No.

364
00:26:42,128 --> 00:26:43,433
No, no.

365
00:26:48,535 --> 00:26:49,932
Now, just take it easy.

366
00:26:50,471 --> 00:26:51,409
Easy.

367
00:26:51,434 --> 00:26:53,523
Get your hands off me.

368
00:27:02,845 --> 00:27:04,455
His neck is broken.

369
00:27:06,766 --> 00:27:08,507
Hardly more than a boy.

370
00:27:08,745 --> 00:27:11,462
Painted for war, trying
to make a name for himself

371
00:27:11,487 --> 00:27:12,836
by stealing our horses.

372
00:27:13,073 --> 00:27:14,944
This spells
a raiding party.

373
00:27:15,181 --> 00:27:16,965
They won't be long
in missing him
and tracking him here.

374
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,506
Let's get those horses
ready to move.

375
00:27:18,531 --> 00:27:20,011
We're not gonna bury him?

376
00:27:20,036 --> 00:27:21,995
Sorry, Doctor.
We don't have the time.

377
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:23,979
Now let's get out
of here.

378
00:27:24,503 --> 00:27:26,173
Git.

379
00:27:27,696 --> 00:27:30,351
Hup! Ahh.

380
00:27:30,481 --> 00:27:32,135
Get in there!

381
00:27:32,266 --> 00:27:34,442
Swing 'em into midstream
wide, O'Rourke.

382
00:27:34,678 --> 00:27:36,680
Watch out for quicksand.

383
00:27:36,705 --> 00:27:38,533
Right, Captain.

384
00:27:40,014 --> 00:27:42,233
Hyah! Hyah!

385
00:27:42,364 --> 00:27:44,888
That's the way, lads. Pull!

386
00:27:45,019 --> 00:27:46,411
Come on. Git-up.

387
00:27:51,432 --> 00:27:53,723
Hyah! Git-up! Hyah!

388
00:27:54,125 --> 00:27:56,911
Pull! Pull! That's it.
Come on, lads.

389
00:27:58,206 --> 00:27:59,294
Hyah!

390
00:28:00,315 --> 00:28:01,423
Hup!

391
00:28:01,448 --> 00:28:05,167
Ho! Git-up there.
Git-up!

392
00:28:07,258 --> 00:28:09,608
Get the wagon
under cover
of those trees.

393
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:12,995
Krausman, break out the
extra rifles and ammunition.

394
00:28:13,028 --> 00:28:15,167
The rest of you, picket the
horses over there.

395
00:28:30,034 --> 00:28:32,458
All right, we'll dig
in here and hope
they don't spot us.

396
00:28:32,615 --> 00:28:34,225
If they do, they'll have to
come across the stream.

397
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,236
The fight'll be on
our terms, not theirs.

398
00:28:43,295 --> 00:28:44,713
Can you handle a rifle?

399
00:28:44,738 --> 00:28:47,785
Just point me in the right
direction, Captain.

400
00:28:53,072 --> 00:28:55,424
Me, too, Captain.

401
00:28:56,626 --> 00:28:57,889
All right, let's go.

402
00:29:14,432 --> 00:29:15,912
All right, stay down

403
00:29:15,937 --> 00:29:17,838
and don't fire
till I give the order.

404
00:29:33,651 --> 00:29:34,826
Krausman!

405
00:30:25,444 --> 00:30:26,619
All right,
we got 'em on the run.

406
00:30:26,749 --> 00:30:28,403
Let's keep 'em moving.

407
00:31:01,682 --> 00:31:03,346
Krausman! Krausman!

408
00:31:17,773 --> 00:31:22,038
Krausman, you disobey another
order, and I'll break you in half.

409
00:31:22,911 --> 00:31:24,657
My bag is in the wagon.

410
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:27,337
Now, somebody, please,
this man is bleeding to death.

411
00:31:37,778 --> 00:31:39,736
That was murder,
Mr. Barlow.

412
00:31:39,867 --> 00:31:41,950
You don't murder
an Indian, Hanneford.

413
00:31:41,975 --> 00:31:43,193
You just kill 'em,

414
00:31:43,218 --> 00:31:45,526
like you shoot a rattler
or step on a bug.

415
00:31:47,894 --> 00:31:49,373
I'll take the rifle,
Barlow.

416
00:31:55,739 --> 00:31:58,456
What're you doing out here if
you ain't got no taste for killing?

417
00:31:58,481 --> 00:32:00,454
What I'm doing out here, Mr. Barlow,
is my own business.

418
00:32:00,479 --> 00:32:02,963
As far as my not having a taste for
killing, you're right about that. I don't.

419
00:32:03,776 --> 00:32:05,526
And the irony of it is

420
00:32:06,566 --> 00:32:08,132
for every man
you've killed in your life,

421
00:32:08,157 --> 00:32:11,334
I expect I've killed
a hundred, maybe a thousand.

422
00:32:33,838 --> 00:32:34,854
Thanks.

423
00:32:34,957 --> 00:32:38,401
Well, even the best
of us can make a mistake
now and then.

424
00:32:58,865 --> 00:33:00,518
Whoa.

425
00:33:13,006 --> 00:33:14,051
Is Brant around?

426
00:33:14,487 --> 00:33:15,557
Brant?

427
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:17,489
He's been dead
more than two months.

428
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,667
I took this place over.

429
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:24,779
I keep meaning to clean up
around here, but...

430
00:33:35,768 --> 00:33:39,294
I believe the lady
would find it cooler inside.

431
00:33:40,448 --> 00:33:41,884
That water any good?

432
00:33:42,209 --> 00:33:43,463
I drink it.

433
00:33:44,962 --> 00:33:47,573
Krausman, O'Rourke,
fill up the water barrels.

434
00:33:48,615 --> 00:33:52,445
First saloon we come to, and here
we are drawing a barrel of water.

435
00:33:52,569 --> 00:33:54,873
House always buys
the first drink.

436
00:33:54,898 --> 00:33:56,745
Then you're on your own.

437
00:34:04,139 --> 00:34:06,838
Whiskey? Tequila?

438
00:34:07,358 --> 00:34:09,056
- Tequila.
- The same.

439
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,423
Three whiskies.

440
00:34:26,517 --> 00:34:28,388
You fellas come far?

441
00:34:30,992 --> 00:34:32,341
Far enough.

442
00:34:34,133 --> 00:34:35,700
You going far?

443
00:34:38,388 --> 00:34:40,651
I can tell better
when I get there.

444
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:45,760
Them new Indian lands
start just south of here.

445
00:34:46,477 --> 00:34:49,785
Supposed to be out of bounds for
anybody except the Comanche.

446
00:34:52,459 --> 00:34:54,215
Don't suppose
you heard that?

447
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,241
Yeah, I heard.

448
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:59,116
Government says they gonna go
hard on anybody they catch out there.

449
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:01,701
Tell you what I'll do,
friend.

450
00:35:02,343 --> 00:35:03,437
What'll you do?

451
00:35:03,473 --> 00:35:06,179
I'll mind my business
if you'll mind yours.

452
00:35:08,801 --> 00:35:11,717
I understand you run
a freight line to Santa Fe.

453
00:35:11,854 --> 00:35:18,047
No, not since the Comanche come raiding
through here and burned out the ranches.

454
00:35:19,745 --> 00:35:21,835
You got some freight
for Santa Fe?

455
00:35:24,859 --> 00:35:26,295
No, a passenger.

456
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,421
- The girl?
- Yeah.

457
00:35:31,191 --> 00:35:33,541
Could be arranged, maybe.

458
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:36,562
I been thinking
about going in
for supplies.

459
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,793
I hear you're trying
to get to Santa Fe.

460
00:35:53,009 --> 00:35:55,011
Yes, I am.

461
00:35:57,088 --> 00:35:59,352
Might take me
a few days
to fit up.

462
00:36:01,018 --> 00:36:02,715
There's a room in the back
you could use.

463
00:36:03,483 --> 00:36:08,030
Not too fancy,
but the bed's comfortable.

464
00:36:08,055 --> 00:36:10,274
Forget it, mister.

465
00:36:10,721 --> 00:36:12,201
This ought to cover
the drinks.

466
00:36:12,226 --> 00:36:14,732
- Let's go.
- Now, wait up now. You've got this all wrong.

467
00:36:14,757 --> 00:36:17,456
Why, this lady'd be as safe
here as in a church.

468
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,350
Let's all have a drink
and forget it.

469
00:36:21,082 --> 00:36:23,194
Just friends, huh?

470
00:36:24,017 --> 00:36:26,091
That's the way.
Everybody, belly up.

471
00:36:26,116 --> 00:36:27,553
I said, let's go.

472
00:36:27,578 --> 00:36:30,277
But, Matt, I ain't had
me first one yet.

473
00:36:31,068 --> 00:36:33,271
- O'Rourke.
- Drinks, he says.

474
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:39,445
Thanks.

475
00:36:42,003 --> 00:36:45,136
Look, I'm sorry you're
still stuck with me.

476
00:36:45,267 --> 00:36:48,116
Look, get this straight.
I didn't do that for you.

477
00:36:48,923 --> 00:36:51,142
Do you mean you thought
I'd talk about the gold?

478
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,030
That's right.

479
00:36:52,055 --> 00:36:53,710
Oh, well,
in that case...

480
00:36:53,841 --> 00:36:57,358
Memphis, get in
the wagon.

481
00:36:59,663 --> 00:37:01,926
Is that the only reason
you don't want to leave me?

482
00:37:03,503 --> 00:37:04,591
Well?

483
00:37:06,636 --> 00:37:09,333
Just get in the wagon and
change those clothes.

484
00:37:27,572 --> 00:37:28,921
Hold on, mister.

485
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,492
You ain't paid
for that barrel
of water.

486
00:37:43,518 --> 00:37:44,824
How much?

487
00:37:44,849 --> 00:37:47,896
That'll be about,
uh, $50.

488
00:37:52,006 --> 00:37:53,747
It's his water, friend.

489
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:57,994
Oh, well, you go ahead
and tell him, then.

490
00:38:00,139 --> 00:38:01,466
$50.

491
00:38:04,531 --> 00:38:08,405
Look, that's the only well
in 100 miles of here.

492
00:38:32,567 --> 00:38:35,440
Git-up. Git-up. Git-up.

493
00:38:57,988 --> 00:38:59,163
Oh!

494
00:39:10,474 --> 00:39:13,524
Anybody'd pay $50
for a barrel of water

495
00:39:13,549 --> 00:39:15,856
could only be headed
one place that I know of.

496
00:39:15,987 --> 00:39:18,119
Like maybe
the Staked Plains.

497
00:39:18,355 --> 00:39:20,357
I wonder
what they're after.

498
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:22,177
I don't know,

499
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,187
but whatever it is
must be mighty inviting.

500
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,881
Sure does arouse
a fella's curiosity.

501
00:39:30,611 --> 00:39:31,575
Wait a minute.

502
00:39:32,021 --> 00:39:34,458
You been here three days
eating and drinking.

503
00:39:34,589 --> 00:39:36,318
What about your bill?

504
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,599
Oh.

505
00:39:41,633 --> 00:39:43,630
I got more
than this coming.

506
00:40:34,067 --> 00:40:35,547
You didn't mark
the graves?

507
00:40:36,489 --> 00:40:37,513
No.

508
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:42,118
I just walked the horses back
and forth trampling the ground flat.

509
00:40:43,911 --> 00:40:45,782
Hard to tell where
your brother's buried.

510
00:41:09,755 --> 00:41:11,757
He came
a long way to die.

511
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,110
Tell me about it, Adam.

512
00:41:18,321 --> 00:41:20,688
Didn't you read my report
to General Good, Captain?

513
00:41:20,758 --> 00:41:21,786
I read it.

514
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:23,570
Then you know
the whole story.

515
00:41:23,595 --> 00:41:25,641
I don't know
what the convoy
was doing here,

516
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:27,711
almost 100 miles south
of its original route.

517
00:41:27,736 --> 00:41:30,907
- The Comanches were at war, Captain.
- So were the Rebs, Lieutenant.

518
00:41:34,341 --> 00:41:38,087
Your brother wasn't to blame
for what happened here.

519
00:41:38,501 --> 00:41:40,283
I hadn't thought he was.

520
00:41:41,096 --> 00:41:43,141
We gonna camp here
tonight?

521
00:41:44,661 --> 00:41:45,423
No.

522
00:41:45,907 --> 00:41:48,142
We've still got an hour or
so of daylight. We'll move on.

523
00:41:48,167 --> 00:41:49,579
Yes, sir.

524
00:41:54,056 --> 00:41:56,885
There's your Staked Plains
out there, Captain.

525
00:41:57,195 --> 00:41:59,821
A misplaced piece of hell
if there ever was one.

526
00:41:59,846 --> 00:42:01,180
How much further, Barlow?

527
00:42:01,739 --> 00:42:03,698
Well, that's hard
to tell.

528
00:42:03,723 --> 00:42:06,204
We sorta lost track
of things after we left here,

529
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,966
what with that wagon full of
gold getting heavier and heavier

530
00:42:09,991 --> 00:42:15,761
and the men and horses dropping
and the sandstorms scouring us raw.

531
00:42:49,379 --> 00:42:50,336
Where's Krausman?

532
00:42:51,565 --> 00:42:53,393
He was here
a minute ago.

533
00:42:54,109 --> 00:42:55,328
Captain.

534
00:43:12,831 --> 00:43:14,137
Krausman, what--

535
00:43:23,744 --> 00:43:25,093
Still warm.

536
00:43:25,545 --> 00:43:26,763
Comanche.

537
00:43:27,728 --> 00:43:30,165
10, 12 ponies
headed south.

538
00:43:30,694 --> 00:43:32,477
Straight for
the Plains.

539
00:43:38,754 --> 00:43:40,930
I'm gonna ride up ahead,
take a look around.

540
00:43:41,171 --> 00:43:43,521
Keep moving for another hour,
then make camp.

541
00:43:43,651 --> 00:43:45,245
I'd like to ride
with you, Captain.

542
00:43:45,395 --> 00:43:46,613
I'll bet you would.

543
00:43:47,931 --> 00:43:50,300
If I'm not back by morning
break camp and keep moving.

544
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:52,687
You're not to waste any time
looking for me or waiting for me.

545
00:43:52,826 --> 00:43:54,219
That's an order, Long.

546
00:44:19,124 --> 00:44:21,256
Shouldn't somebody
go look for the captain?

547
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:23,753
You volunteering, Doc?

548
00:44:23,954 --> 00:44:25,781
Leave him
alone, Barlow.

549
00:44:25,912 --> 00:44:28,610
I was just asking
a question, Memphis, honey.

550
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:32,456
After all, the doc here
must be quite a guy,

551
00:44:32,638 --> 00:44:34,684
considering all the men
he says he killed.

552
00:44:35,201 --> 00:44:36,899
Tell us about it, Doc.

553
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:39,870
- Barlow.
- I want to hear about it.

554
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:42,103
How'd you kill 'em, Doc?

555
00:44:42,234 --> 00:44:43,870
It was very simple,
Mr. Barlow.

556
00:44:43,895 --> 00:44:46,268
I worked in a slaughterhouse
the Army called a hospital,

557
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,283
and when they brought the
wounded in by the thousands,

558
00:44:48,308 --> 00:44:50,927
I chopped off their hands
and feet and arms and legs

559
00:44:50,952 --> 00:44:52,306
and I bandaged them up
with dirty rags

560
00:44:52,331 --> 00:44:53,784
and I stood there and watched
them bleed to death

561
00:44:53,916 --> 00:44:55,948
or die of gangrene or shock.

562
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,448
When the war started,
I was a surgeon,

563
00:44:58,641 --> 00:45:00,948
and when it was over,
I was nothing but a butcher.

564
00:45:04,099 --> 00:45:06,362
You call me a doctor,
but I'm not a doctor,

565
00:45:06,867 --> 00:45:09,914
not anymore or ever again.

566
00:45:11,318 --> 00:45:14,800
Maybe things ain't as bad
as you think they are, Doc.

567
00:45:15,283 --> 00:45:16,665
I mean...

568
00:45:17,244 --> 00:45:19,006
if you had some money...

569
00:45:19,589 --> 00:45:23,841
and could go someplace,
like, say, California,

570
00:45:24,077 --> 00:45:27,651
take a nice long rest,
forget about the war,

571
00:45:28,138 --> 00:45:31,440
then maybe someday you'd feel
like starting all over again.

572
00:45:33,949 --> 00:45:36,212
When you come
right down to it,

573
00:45:37,417 --> 00:45:40,409
we all got something
ailing us.

574
00:45:41,659 --> 00:45:43,925
But you take a million dollars,

575
00:45:44,796 --> 00:45:47,105
even split five ways,

576
00:45:48,081 --> 00:45:50,604
that's mighty powerful
medicine.

577
00:45:51,592 --> 00:45:53,942
Ain't nothing in the world
that wouldn't cure.

578
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:07,659
What about the Comanches?

579
00:46:07,987 --> 00:46:09,684
They're out there,
all right.

580
00:46:09,917 --> 00:46:11,832
I don't know how many,
but they're there.

581
00:46:11,971 --> 00:46:15,017
So until we know where they are and what
they're up to, we're gonna keep moving.

582
00:46:56,153 --> 00:46:57,415
Pull up, O'Rourke.

583
00:46:57,652 --> 00:46:59,871
Whoa, boys.

584
00:47:00,216 --> 00:47:01,640
Whoa.

585
00:47:03,766 --> 00:47:05,070
Whoa.

586
00:47:23,352 --> 00:47:25,136
Heavy cusses,
ain't they?

587
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:38,787
That's 'cause they're airtight
to protect the gold.

588
00:47:39,066 --> 00:47:41,156
We dumped 'em
to lighten the load.

589
00:47:41,617 --> 00:47:43,031
Didn't do much good.

590
00:47:43,288 --> 00:47:45,795
Couldn't have been more
than 10 or 15 miles

591
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:48,739
before the horses give out
and we had to hide the stuff.

592
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:53,699
All right,
let's make camp.

593
00:48:00,124 --> 00:48:01,778
You know...

594
00:48:03,329 --> 00:48:08,117
I been thinking about what you
said to the sheriff back in Hays City,

595
00:48:08,662 --> 00:48:10,484
how you'd be back someday

596
00:48:10,509 --> 00:48:12,311
and make him
and the whole town

597
00:48:12,336 --> 00:48:14,839
come crawling to you
to apologize.

598
00:48:15,687 --> 00:48:18,647
Anybody with
half a million dollars

599
00:48:18,987 --> 00:48:22,870
could make Hays City sit up
and bark like a dog.

600
00:48:23,347 --> 00:48:24,914
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

601
00:48:25,044 --> 00:48:26,495
I'd love it.

602
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,595
All you gotta do
is get me a rifle.

603
00:48:31,511 --> 00:48:34,166
First chance you get
after we pick up the gold.

604
00:48:34,899 --> 00:48:36,003
Why not?

605
00:48:53,317 --> 00:48:54,848
There it is.

606
00:48:55,638 --> 00:48:57,465
There it is, boys.

607
00:49:01,803 --> 00:49:03,936
Hyah! Hyah!

608
00:49:15,121 --> 00:49:17,689
Hyah! Hyah!

609
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:32,897
Look at the gold.

610
00:49:32,922 --> 00:49:34,728
Just look at the gold.

611
00:49:35,258 --> 00:49:36,476
Unbelievable.

612
00:49:42,255 --> 00:49:43,691
All right,
let's get it loaded.

613
00:49:44,306 --> 00:49:46,607
Well, Captain, I did
my part of the bargain.

614
00:49:46,632 --> 00:49:47,981
Now you keep yours.

615
00:49:48,217 --> 00:49:49,958
When the job's done,
Barlow.

616
00:49:50,089 --> 00:49:51,189
It's done.

617
00:49:51,214 --> 00:49:54,223
Your amnesty will be recognized
when we get to Fort Hays and not before.

618
00:49:54,248 --> 00:49:56,660
How do I know you Yanks
won't back down on the deal

619
00:49:56,685 --> 00:49:58,053
and send me back
to Austin Prison?

620
00:49:58,078 --> 00:49:59,340
Because you were told.

621
00:49:59,576 --> 00:50:02,083
When this gold is returned to
the Army, you'll be a free man.

622
00:50:02,213 --> 00:50:04,215
Now, if you're in a hurry,
get to work.

623
00:50:11,136 --> 00:50:13,530
Gold always was
my favorite color.

624
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:21,954
Are you coming?

625
00:50:23,252 --> 00:50:24,689
What's the matter?

626
00:50:24,714 --> 00:50:27,195
Afraid I'll hide one
in each stocking?

627
00:50:34,681 --> 00:50:36,658
Well, hello again.

628
00:50:37,221 --> 00:50:40,868
Just bring it
right on down here.

629
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:58,460
You know, a fella's eyes play
tricks on him out in this country.

630
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:03,887
Sees things that ain't there, like
running water, green grass, trees.

631
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,847
I even seen a herd of buffalo
once that weren't there, but

632
00:51:08,535 --> 00:51:11,261
I never did see no gold.

633
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:19,291
That gold
is as real as real.

634
00:51:20,789 --> 00:51:23,444
Drop them gun belts,
all of you.

635
00:51:25,511 --> 00:51:26,717
Do as he says.

636
00:51:36,266 --> 00:51:38,050
I wouldn't do that, mister.

637
00:51:39,614 --> 00:51:43,236
One shot'll bring every Comanche
within five miles riding down on us.

638
00:51:43,897 --> 00:51:47,452
Maybe there ain't no Comanche
within five miles.

639
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:50,280
Well, then all you gotta do
to find out is pull that trigger.

640
00:51:56,217 --> 00:52:00,508
No Comanche ever heard
a skinning knife at work.

641
00:53:22,635 --> 00:53:25,374
O'Rourke,
move the wagon up.

642
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:27,299
Let's get
that gold loaded.

643
00:53:29,421 --> 00:53:31,292
Gonna leave them
for the buzzards, too?

644
00:53:32,095 --> 00:53:33,897
That's right, Doctor.

645
00:53:38,043 --> 00:53:39,305
Captain!

646
00:53:43,788 --> 00:53:44,963
It's empty.

647
00:53:51,535 --> 00:53:53,232
Don't look
at me, Captain.

648
00:53:53,257 --> 00:53:55,521
I get just as thirsty
as anybody else.

649
00:53:57,385 --> 00:53:58,604
How much
have we got left?

650
00:53:58,629 --> 00:53:59,996
Well, there's only
the one barrel left,

651
00:54:00,021 --> 00:54:01,370
and it's a third gone.

652
00:54:04,723 --> 00:54:06,178
Let me see
that map.

653
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:08,528
I don't suppose
you'll believe this,

654
00:54:08,553 --> 00:54:11,512
but there's a water hole
about 50 miles north of here.

655
00:54:13,446 --> 00:54:14,813
You sure
of that, Barlow?

656
00:54:14,838 --> 00:54:16,666
I'm alive, ain't I?

657
00:54:16,691 --> 00:54:17,972
Of course I'm sure.

658
00:54:18,102 --> 00:54:19,364
That's the way
we went.

659
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:20,565
Must mean Eagle Wells.

660
00:54:22,349 --> 00:54:23,306
Do you know it?

661
00:54:24,786 --> 00:54:26,799
It was on
our original route before...

662
00:54:27,885 --> 00:54:30,191
before we decided
to turn south.

663
00:54:32,756 --> 00:54:34,149
Here's Eagle Wells.

664
00:54:34,349 --> 00:54:37,570
There's another water hole
30 miles north of that.

665
00:54:38,146 --> 00:54:41,062
Sabine Springs, here.

666
00:54:42,671 --> 00:54:44,478
Sabine Springs.

667
00:54:46,952 --> 00:54:49,128
All right, let's get that gold
loaded and move out.

668
00:55:15,857 --> 00:55:18,493
- Adam.
- What is it, Captain?

669
00:55:18,518 --> 00:55:21,275
Barlow's down at the picket line.
He's saddling a horse.

670
00:55:21,906 --> 00:55:23,088
Let's go get him.

671
00:55:23,113 --> 00:55:25,705
No. I'm gonna follow him,
see what he's up to.

672
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:28,346
I want you to keep your eyes
on things while I'm gone.

673
00:55:57,861 --> 00:55:59,578
You didn't have
to come after me.

674
00:55:59,709 --> 00:56:01,276
I would have
caught up with you.

675
00:56:05,323 --> 00:56:06,658
Who's buried there?

676
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:09,111
We didn't have time
to carve his name,

677
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:11,722
and without shovels,
we couldn't dig too deep.

678
00:56:11,853 --> 00:56:16,377
But here lies Major Armiston,
dead by reason of snakebite.

679
00:56:17,336 --> 00:56:18,617
What about the others?

680
00:56:18,642 --> 00:56:20,209
Did the same snake
kill them, too?

681
00:56:20,234 --> 00:56:23,189
I told you, I don't know
what happened to 'em.

682
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:26,669
A couple of them took off on their
own, and I got separated from the rest.

683
00:56:27,437 --> 00:56:30,004
I kind of liked the major.

684
00:56:30,314 --> 00:56:32,577
He and I got along
real good,

685
00:56:32,787 --> 00:56:36,355
and I was curious
if the Comanches
had found his grave.

686
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:39,165
They'd as soon scalp
a dead man as a live one.

687
00:56:39,402 --> 00:56:42,193
And you came
this far out of the way
just to make sure?

688
00:56:42,423 --> 00:56:43,467
Yeah.

689
00:56:44,411 --> 00:56:46,645
- Start digging.
- Huh?

690
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:48,020
You heard me, dig.

691
00:56:48,536 --> 00:56:50,138
With my bare hands?

692
00:56:50,163 --> 00:56:51,720
You buried him that way,
didn't you?

693
00:56:51,928 --> 00:56:53,234
Now dig him up.

694
00:57:13,348 --> 00:57:14,697
You satisfied?

695
00:57:15,966 --> 00:57:17,974
I'm gonna tell you
just one time, Barlow.

696
00:57:18,221 --> 00:57:20,397
From now on,
stay with the wagon.

697
00:57:36,113 --> 00:57:37,244
Captain.

698
00:57:51,458 --> 00:57:54,548
I'm just played out.
Both of us, I'm afraid.

699
00:57:55,112 --> 00:57:57,158
- Drink some of this.
- No.

700
00:57:57,183 --> 00:57:58,880
Drink, damn it.
That's an order.

701
00:58:00,138 --> 00:58:01,356
Thanks.

702
00:58:06,883 --> 00:58:08,145
Help him
into the wagon.

703
00:58:09,794 --> 00:58:13,978
Ooh, ooh, easy, boy.

704
00:58:17,212 --> 00:58:18,257
Let's go, Doc.

705
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:25,467
Forget the saddle,
Krausman. Just take the gear.

706
00:58:33,988 --> 00:58:38,005
Captain,
I'll take care of him.

707
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,969
We'll travel afoot
for the next hour.

708
00:58:48,994 --> 00:58:51,443
That ain't too healthy,
Captain. Take a look.

709
00:58:55,904 --> 00:58:57,432
They see us
leading our horses,

710
00:58:57,457 --> 00:58:59,589
they might get the notion
we're too far gone

711
00:58:59,614 --> 00:59:01,094
to put up
much of a fight.

712
00:59:01,436 --> 00:59:03,003
Yeah, and the only
sure way I know

713
00:59:03,028 --> 00:59:05,359
of bringing 'em buzzing down
around our necks is to make a run for it.

714
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:07,266
So we'll walk.

715
00:59:10,383 --> 00:59:12,466
How far to Eagle Wells?

716
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:15,373
Ought to make it
before sundown.

717
00:59:15,895 --> 00:59:18,571
I figure the least they'll do
is try to cut us off.

718
00:59:18,948 --> 00:59:20,994
That's not their style
of fighting.

719
00:59:22,177 --> 00:59:23,570
Just waiting.

720
00:59:23,902 --> 00:59:25,121
For what?

721
00:59:26,703 --> 00:59:29,184
We'll know
when the time comes.

722
01:00:07,098 --> 01:00:09,492
Now we know why they weren't
in any hurry to cut us off.

723
01:00:14,445 --> 01:00:15,664
This hole's
been blasted

724
01:00:16,245 --> 01:00:18,013
and not just
recently either.

725
01:00:18,427 --> 01:00:20,082
I may be
wrong, Barlow,

726
01:00:20,212 --> 01:00:23,588
but somehow I get the impression
you're not entirely surprised by this,

727
01:00:23,824 --> 01:00:25,478
nor much
concerned either.

728
01:00:25,748 --> 01:00:27,828
Are you accusing me,
Lieutenant?

729
01:00:28,214 --> 01:00:31,957
Because if you are,
let me remind you again

730
01:00:31,982 --> 01:00:34,708
that I can get just
as thirsty as anybody else.

731
01:00:34,733 --> 01:00:38,474
I went through that once,
three days of no water.

732
01:00:38,603 --> 01:00:40,431
It ain't something
I wanna do over.

733
01:00:42,569 --> 01:00:45,716
Put that thing away, Krausman.
Put it away!

734
01:00:45,741 --> 01:00:50,044
All right, break it up.
You heard me. Break it up.

735
01:00:55,597 --> 01:00:57,990
Is there any chance
of getting the horses
to Sabine Springs?

736
01:00:58,015 --> 01:01:00,452
They'll pull no more
without water, Captain.

737
01:01:00,583 --> 01:01:01,976
We must be facing it.

738
01:01:02,106 --> 01:01:04,591
'Tis the end
of the line,
I'm thinking.

739
01:01:05,098 --> 01:01:08,101
Not yet, O'Rourke.
Not yet.

740
01:01:19,489 --> 01:01:20,708
Just coyotes.

741
01:01:20,733 --> 01:01:21,865
Ha ha.

742
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:25,365
What are you doing
up here?

743
01:01:25,495 --> 01:01:27,541
You're supposed to be
on the north ridge.

744
01:01:27,566 --> 01:01:29,481
What good would I be
up there without a rifle?

745
01:01:29,721 --> 01:01:32,373
You can yell, can't you?
Now get up there.

746
01:01:36,472 --> 01:01:39,099
Barlow's right.
Those aren't coyotes.

747
01:01:40,606 --> 01:01:41,888
No, they're not.

748
01:01:42,576 --> 01:01:45,411
But remember this, we've
got rifles and a clear field of fire.

749
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:47,857
Those Comanches will have to
think twice before they do more

750
01:01:47,890 --> 01:01:49,693
than just squat there
barking at each other.

751
01:01:49,981 --> 01:01:53,332
Yeah, and what happens
after they think twice?

752
01:02:11,633 --> 01:02:14,679
You were in love with that sheriff
in Hays City, weren't you?

753
01:02:15,459 --> 01:02:17,302
That farewell speech
you made,

754
01:02:18,204 --> 01:02:20,380
the way you looked at him
and he looked at you.

755
01:02:20,405 --> 01:02:21,798
What right
do you have--

756
01:02:21,823 --> 01:02:23,878
- Tell me about it.
- You go to hell.

757
01:02:23,903 --> 01:02:24,740
Tell me!

758
01:02:24,816 --> 01:02:26,428
All right, Captain.

759
01:02:26,819 --> 01:02:28,958
Yes, I loved him.

760
01:02:30,636 --> 01:02:33,958
Then a young lady
came to town.

761
01:02:35,411 --> 01:02:38,066
Oh, she was a very
respectable young lady

762
01:02:38,091 --> 01:02:39,702
with a very
respectable father

763
01:02:39,727 --> 01:02:43,079
who was the president
of a very respectable bank.

764
01:02:44,602 --> 01:02:46,386
And that's when
Carter Drum

765
01:02:46,411 --> 01:02:50,850
decided to clean up Hays City,
starting with me.

766
01:02:52,523 --> 01:02:54,482
Now, is there anything else
you'd like to know

767
01:02:54,507 --> 01:02:56,849
about Memphis
Whatever-Her-Name-Is?

768
01:03:22,612 --> 01:03:23,793
Memphis?

769
01:03:24,585 --> 01:03:25,716
What's the matter?

770
01:03:35,281 --> 01:03:36,418
Anything, Adam?

771
01:03:37,198 --> 01:03:38,175
No.

772
01:03:45,404 --> 01:03:48,933
Barlow. Oh.

773
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:51,035
What you trying to do?

774
01:03:51,317 --> 01:03:54,102
You'll get yourself
killed sneaking
up on a man like this.

775
01:03:54,518 --> 01:03:57,496
Anyway, you're not
supposed to be out here.

776
01:03:57,988 --> 01:03:59,949
I thought maybe
you was thirsty.

777
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:04,285
Whiskey.
Oh.

778
01:04:06,642 --> 01:04:10,418
Oh, 'tis a miracle.
That's what it is.

779
01:04:10,558 --> 01:04:13,214
Where did you ever get it?
Brant's.

780
01:04:13,244 --> 01:04:15,811
What in the devil
you been saving it
for, man?

781
01:04:16,254 --> 01:04:17,691
Oh...

782
01:04:23,344 --> 01:04:26,521
Captain, I got
one of them spotted.

783
01:04:26,794 --> 01:04:29,057
I'm gonna work down
from here and cut around
behind him.

784
01:04:29,745 --> 01:04:32,974
- Here, you keep me covered.
- Forget it.

785
01:04:33,209 --> 01:04:35,081
We're not here
to collect scalps.

786
01:04:35,589 --> 01:04:38,197
I got 17
of 'em. 17.

787
01:04:38,327 --> 01:04:40,416
I swore it on Anna's grave
and the baby's.

788
01:04:40,441 --> 01:04:43,706
I said 10 scalps for you,
Anna, and 10 for the girl.

789
01:04:44,483 --> 01:04:47,269
They still owe me three.
That's all I want.

790
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:49,206
That's all
I come here for.

791
01:04:49,574 --> 01:04:51,663
Now, you
keep me covered.

792
01:04:51,688 --> 01:04:53,675
Krausman. Krausman.

793
01:04:55,891 --> 01:04:57,316
Now you
listen to me.

794
01:04:57,701 --> 01:05:00,574
We got just one chance,
and that's getting
to Sabine Springs.

795
01:05:00,722 --> 01:05:03,447
You help us get there, and you can
kill 20 Comanches for all I care.

796
01:05:04,933 --> 01:05:05,803
You promise?

797
01:05:07,742 --> 01:05:08,519
Yeah.

798
01:05:09,279 --> 01:05:12,644
But all I want is three.
Just three more scalps.

799
01:05:19,284 --> 01:05:23,201
I am not saying I will,
and I'm not saying I won't.

800
01:05:23,395 --> 01:05:26,267
What I am saying is
I need another drink.

801
01:05:29,249 --> 01:05:31,642
No, you don't,
Barlow. Heh.

802
01:05:31,679 --> 01:05:33,893
I'm on to you,
trying to get me drunk

803
01:05:34,058 --> 01:05:38,286
- and make away with my rifle, huh? No.
- Me? Trying to get you drunk?

804
01:05:38,988 --> 01:05:42,325
Look, if you've had too much,
just hand the bottle back.

805
01:05:42,350 --> 01:05:45,761
- Let's forget all about going partners.
- Well, I didn't say that.

806
01:05:45,786 --> 01:05:48,074
I'm turning it over
in me mind.

807
01:05:48,834 --> 01:05:51,378
Oh, it's that dry,
my mouth is.

808
01:05:52,159 --> 01:05:54,466
What happens
if they attack, Captain?

809
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:56,519
They won't.

810
01:05:57,105 --> 01:06:00,589
Not tonight,
not tomorrow.

811
01:06:01,456 --> 01:06:04,324
Not till we get to Sabine Springs
and find it's been blasted, too.

812
01:06:04,372 --> 01:06:06,591
Blasted?
How do you know?

813
01:06:06,722 --> 01:06:08,593
Why didn't they try
to cut us off today?

814
01:06:09,144 --> 01:06:10,956
Because they knew
the well was dry.

815
01:06:10,981 --> 01:06:12,863
Why haven't they hit us
tonight?

816
01:06:13,772 --> 01:06:16,456
Because they know when we get to
Sabine Springs, it won't help us either.

817
01:06:16,849 --> 01:06:18,329
Well, what are you
gonna do?

818
01:06:18,433 --> 01:06:19,847
I'm gonna get the truth
out of Barlow

819
01:06:19,872 --> 01:06:21,831
if I have to use Krausman's
scalping knife on him.

820
01:06:25,872 --> 01:06:28,850
- Then it's a deal?
- It's a deal.

821
01:06:28,875 --> 01:06:30,399
And I have your word,
Barlow.

822
01:06:30,529 --> 01:06:33,140
There will be plenty
of water for all of us.

823
01:06:42,883 --> 01:06:45,799
Why did you...
why did you...

824
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:00,995
Up here, Doc.

825
01:07:05,327 --> 01:07:07,286
Stay with her, Adam.
Keep under cover.

826
01:07:31,070 --> 01:07:32,898
Get out of here!
Go on!

827
01:07:32,923 --> 01:07:34,882
Go on,
get out of here!

828
01:07:35,187 --> 01:07:38,191
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

829
01:07:41,233 --> 01:07:44,113
- Adam, what the blazes you doing?
- Drop your rifles.

830
01:07:45,084 --> 01:07:46,402
Drop 'em.

831
01:07:50,263 --> 01:07:52,744
Now the guns.
You first.

832
01:07:53,206 --> 01:07:55,191
Left hand.

833
01:07:56,301 --> 01:07:57,433
Krausman.

834
01:08:00,212 --> 01:08:02,269
Stand over there
beside him, Lieutenant.

835
01:08:03,058 --> 01:08:05,147
He was on top of me
before I had a chance.

836
01:08:05,395 --> 01:08:07,113
It's my fault,
not yours.

837
01:08:08,499 --> 01:08:10,022
You wasn't
much help to me,

838
01:08:10,257 --> 01:08:11,607
was you,
Memphis, honey?

839
01:08:11,718 --> 01:08:13,807
But maybe
it wasn't your fault.

840
01:08:14,363 --> 01:08:16,351
Now, you think you can
pick up them guns

841
01:08:16,376 --> 01:08:19,380
without getting a pretty little
finger caught in the trigger?

842
01:08:21,691 --> 01:08:22,698
Try it.

843
01:08:24,124 --> 01:08:26,039
How far do you think
you're gonna get, Barlow?

844
01:08:26,402 --> 01:08:28,843
Just don't you fret
about me, Captain.

845
01:08:28,973 --> 01:08:31,320
By the time the Comanches
get finished with you,

846
01:08:31,345 --> 01:08:34,131
I'll be on the downhill
side toward home.

847
01:08:40,836 --> 01:08:42,490
Now the canteens.

848
01:08:42,621 --> 01:08:43,959
What good
are they gonna do you?

849
01:08:43,984 --> 01:08:45,912
There's not a drop of water
among the three of them.

850
01:08:45,972 --> 01:08:47,339
I know,
but there's nothing

851
01:08:47,364 --> 01:08:49,802
like leaving
a tidy camp behind you.

852
01:08:50,283 --> 01:08:52,808
That's fine.
Now climb on.

853
01:08:54,274 --> 01:08:55,449
You better go with him.

854
01:08:58,626 --> 01:09:00,662
Come on, come on,
come on.

855
01:09:01,746 --> 01:09:03,922
You can count on
better treatment from me

856
01:09:04,165 --> 01:09:06,295
than a dozen
buck Comanches.

857
01:09:10,126 --> 01:09:11,843
Them Comanche
must be mighty curious

858
01:09:11,868 --> 01:09:13,566
about what's been
going on up here.

859
01:09:13,696 --> 01:09:16,177
This ought to
really stir 'em up.

860
01:09:21,154 --> 01:09:23,140
All right, let's go.
Come on.

861
01:09:23,165 --> 01:09:24,340
Hyah!

862
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:36,362
Adam, I want you to build a fire,
a big one.

863
01:09:36,433 --> 01:09:38,522
Are you crazy, Captain?
We gotta get out of here.

864
01:09:38,547 --> 01:09:41,333
Now, how far do you think we're
gonna get afoot without rifles or water?

865
01:09:41,358 --> 01:09:43,621
Right now, we got only one
chance, and that's the Comanches.

866
01:09:43,724 --> 01:09:45,982
Barlow invited them in. Now
let's make it easier for 'em.

867
01:09:46,007 --> 01:09:48,793
Get that fire started.
Krausman, you come with me.

868
01:11:31,618 --> 01:11:32,880
Hyah!

869
01:11:59,218 --> 01:12:01,307
You all right, Captain?

870
01:12:01,506 --> 01:12:02,842
I can make it.

871
01:12:02,867 --> 01:12:05,304
I got the horses.
Let's go.

872
01:12:05,855 --> 01:12:07,161
Krausman!

873
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,982
Krausman! Captain!

874
01:12:26,546 --> 01:12:28,026
Let's get out
of here, Adam.

875
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:50,483
Whoa.

876
01:12:51,053 --> 01:12:52,787
Yes, sir.

877
01:12:52,962 --> 01:12:55,530
I'm gonna really
live it up.

878
01:12:55,986 --> 01:12:59,032
Reach me one of them
canteens, will you,
Memphis, honey?

879
01:12:59,467 --> 01:13:02,009
I got a lot
of living owed me,

880
01:13:02,034 --> 01:13:05,082
two years of prison,
four years of the war,

881
01:13:05,310 --> 01:13:08,183
and that stinking
prisoner-of-war camp.

882
01:13:11,931 --> 01:13:13,933
Ahh.

883
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:18,429
You know, honey,

884
01:13:18,686 --> 01:13:21,863
I almost forgot
what a woman's
voice sounded like,

885
01:13:22,158 --> 01:13:24,203
but you sure
fixed that.

886
01:13:24,412 --> 01:13:25,587
So I see.

887
01:13:29,168 --> 01:13:30,996
Hyah! Git-up.

888
01:13:59,684 --> 01:14:02,178
We better get off
and rest that leg, Captain.

889
01:14:15,084 --> 01:14:17,807
We're not gonna be able to go
much further without water, Captain.

890
01:14:18,646 --> 01:14:19,854
We'll make it.

891
01:14:20,496 --> 01:14:21,771
We've got to.

892
01:14:25,581 --> 01:14:27,538
I gotta tell you
something.

893
01:14:28,319 --> 01:14:30,608
I gotta tell you about
your brother, Captain,

894
01:14:31,810 --> 01:14:33,290
why he changed our route.

895
01:14:33,843 --> 01:14:34,913
What do you mean?

896
01:14:35,281 --> 01:14:36,897
Jim was out of his head.

897
01:14:38,547 --> 01:14:40,201
He didn't know
what he was doing.

898
01:14:40,285 --> 01:14:44,687
He'd give one order one minute
and contradict it the next.

899
01:14:45,340 --> 01:14:46,620
He shouldn't have
been in command.

900
01:14:46,645 --> 01:14:48,212
I should have taken over.

901
01:14:48,449 --> 01:14:49,841
Then why didn't you?

902
01:14:49,866 --> 01:14:51,650
Because I was scared

903
01:14:51,781 --> 01:14:54,093
and I didn't have
the guts to admit it.

904
01:14:55,963 --> 01:14:58,836
That's why I left it on my
report to General Good.

905
01:14:59,576 --> 01:15:01,578
I was protecting myself.

906
01:15:02,572 --> 01:15:03,788
Were you?

907
01:15:04,465 --> 01:15:06,624
Were you protecting
yourself

908
01:15:07,145 --> 01:15:09,147
or were you protecting
a friend?

909
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:26,643
- Don't waste it.

910
01:15:26,773 --> 01:15:28,163
Waste it?

911
01:15:28,496 --> 01:15:31,718
Memphis, honey, you just don't seem
to understand, do you?

912
01:15:31,942 --> 01:15:33,770
We got nothing
to worry about.

913
01:15:34,148 --> 01:15:36,019
Here, make
yourself useful.

914
01:15:36,044 --> 01:15:38,698
Water them nags while
I fill up the canteens.

915
01:16:14,233 --> 01:16:15,911
Where's the other canteen?

916
01:16:16,041 --> 01:16:17,390
What canteen?

917
01:16:17,521 --> 01:16:20,219
We had three of 'em this morning.
Now there's only two.

918
01:16:20,244 --> 01:16:21,636
Where's the other one?

919
01:16:21,979 --> 01:16:23,763
How should I know?

920
01:16:24,022 --> 01:16:26,201
You're lying.

921
01:16:26,322 --> 01:16:29,804
All right, big man, I'll tell
you where it is.

922
01:16:29,957 --> 01:16:32,498
It's about five miles
behind us.

923
01:16:33,112 --> 01:16:35,108
Now, you listen to me.

924
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:39,019
Dropping that canteen
was stupid.

925
01:16:40,426 --> 01:16:42,812
Say Martin gets away
from them Comanche.

926
01:16:42,939 --> 01:16:45,550
Say he finds a canteen.

927
01:16:45,785 --> 01:16:48,136
Say he comes
out of this alive.

928
01:16:48,266 --> 01:16:49,452
What then?

929
01:16:49,575 --> 01:16:52,624
You looked appetizing
enough to him out here,

930
01:16:53,227 --> 01:16:55,795
but back where a gentleman
like him comes from,

931
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:59,710
he wouldn't walk across the street
to spit on you if you was on fire.

932
01:17:02,731 --> 01:17:04,821
Stop fooling yourself,
Memphis.

933
01:17:06,572 --> 01:17:08,574
You're trash.

934
01:17:08,809 --> 01:17:11,727
You're trash,
just like me.

935
01:17:12,187 --> 01:17:15,583
Only difference is
I'm rich trash

936
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,289
and you're poor trash.

937
01:17:19,473 --> 01:17:22,266
But it don't have
to go on being that way.

938
01:17:23,344 --> 01:17:25,375
You just say the word.

939
01:17:26,548 --> 01:17:28,925
You can have the whole world,

940
01:17:29,636 --> 01:17:31,142
right here...

941
01:17:33,901 --> 01:17:35,599
Memphis, honey.

942
01:17:36,950 --> 01:17:39,735
All you gotta do is remember
what you are.

943
01:18:07,493 --> 01:18:08,956
We lost 'em, Captain.

944
01:18:09,592 --> 01:18:11,507
The wind must have
covered their tracks.

945
01:18:12,968 --> 01:18:14,698
Warm some more rocks.

946
01:18:19,975 --> 01:18:22,020
The principle
of condensation, Adam.

947
01:18:22,761 --> 01:18:25,097
For the same reason
dew forms at night.

948
01:18:25,515 --> 01:18:28,088
Cold air striking
a warm surface.

949
01:18:29,110 --> 01:18:31,634
Warm rocks
against the night air.

950
01:18:32,019 --> 01:18:34,097
result: moisture

951
01:18:34,966 --> 01:18:37,578
and maybe enough water
to keep us alive.

952
01:20:45,702 --> 01:20:46,703
Water.

953
01:20:55,458 --> 01:20:56,763
Tight as a canteen.

954
01:21:00,503 --> 01:21:04,026
Couldn't take much water from the
first grave, but here he really loaded up.

955
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:06,269
Farsighted man,
Mr. Barlow.

956
01:21:06,749 --> 01:21:08,794
First, he kills
the officer in charge,

957
01:21:09,331 --> 01:21:11,406
then he talks the others
into following him.

958
01:21:12,089 --> 01:21:16,044
Hide the gold till after the
war. Then we'll all be rich.

959
01:21:17,383 --> 01:21:19,995
Gets the men to fight
amongst themselves.

960
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:23,505
Then he fills
the chests at Eagle Wells
and Sabine Springs,

961
01:21:23,530 --> 01:21:26,745
blasts them dry against
any possible Yank pursuit.

962
01:21:27,308 --> 01:21:30,077
All the time he was burying
his own private water supply

963
01:21:30,102 --> 01:21:32,147
against the day
he'd return.

964
01:21:32,278 --> 01:21:34,019
Let me see
that map, Adam.

965
01:21:44,386 --> 01:21:47,424
Here's the first grave,
then Eagle Wells.

966
01:21:48,586 --> 01:21:49,978
Now this one.

967
01:21:50,847 --> 01:21:53,120
And there's Sabine Springs.

968
01:21:53,561 --> 01:21:55,300
Straight on line.

969
01:21:55,998 --> 01:21:57,534
Dead north.

970
01:21:58,237 --> 01:21:59,409
Dead north.

971
01:21:59,759 --> 01:22:02,831
And with that wagon, Barlow's gonna
have to take the long way around.

972
01:22:03,745 --> 01:22:06,375
I think we've eaten
his dust long enough, Adam.

973
01:22:06,743 --> 01:22:08,919
Let's beat him
to the next one.

974
01:22:21,273 --> 01:22:22,840
Hyah! Hyah!

975
01:22:36,779 --> 01:22:39,260
Come on. You can dig
as good as me.

976
01:22:52,310 --> 01:22:53,702
Right here.
Come on.

977
01:22:59,628 --> 01:23:01,413
Dig. They gotta be here.

978
01:23:04,555 --> 01:23:06,340
Go ahead, dig.

979
01:23:06,697 --> 01:23:09,495
You can dig clear to China,
but you won't find any water.

980
01:23:13,566 --> 01:23:14,959
Where's the others?

981
01:23:16,839 --> 01:23:17,753
They're here.

982
01:23:17,778 --> 01:23:19,128
Yeah?

983
01:23:19,367 --> 01:23:21,630
Why don't they
show themselves?

984
01:23:22,332 --> 01:23:23,987
Krausman.

985
01:23:25,394 --> 01:23:26,613
Lieutenant.

986
01:23:28,266 --> 01:23:33,750
So it's come down to you and me,
huh, Captain?

987
01:23:33,775 --> 01:23:35,385
You're through, Barlow.

988
01:23:35,727 --> 01:23:38,333
From now on, I'll always
be one jump ahead of you.

989
01:23:38,505 --> 01:23:40,975
Grave by grave, you'll
find nothing but sand.

990
01:23:47,982 --> 01:23:49,331
You stay here.

991
01:23:55,106 --> 01:23:57,021
All right,
you know what to do.

992
01:23:57,215 --> 01:23:58,565
Be careful.

993
01:24:56,095 --> 01:24:58,010
All right, Captain.

994
01:24:58,141 --> 01:25:00,883
You throw rocks
and I'll throw lead.

995
01:26:23,697 --> 01:26:24,959
Matt!

996
01:26:57,395 --> 01:26:59,788
Well, he dug
most of his grave anyway.

997
01:27:01,570 --> 01:27:04,872
The lady helped
considerably.
