1
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:46,219
Aren't you a little old
to be playing with dolls, Michael?

2
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:49,118
What do you think, Billy, is my kid
gonna love this thing or what?

3
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,640
Sure, he'll love it.

4
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,179
He looks just like it.

5
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,439
Yeah, he is pretty cute,
isn't he?

6
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,357
You know what day it is?

7
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,146
- Tuesday.
- It's October 1st.

8
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:04,408
It was exactly ten years ago
that I first came to America.

9
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,031
No shit.

10
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,037
Hey, happy anniversary, Billy.

11
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,492
I'll tell you what...
Ten years deserves a celebration.

12
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:14,352
How bout I take you out
for a drink after work, come on?

13
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,212
I can't be too late.
I'm meeting a girl at nine.

14
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,590
She wants to help me celebrate too.

15
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,421
If you could party
after the graveyard shift,

16
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,887
you got, a lot of stamina.

17
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:28,515
[You know what I mean?

18
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:35,189
Shit, looks like the fuckin' Indians
got another one.

19
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,191
We better check it out, Billy.

20
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:44,365
This is car 17 to dispatch.
We got a code 1022... stripped truck.

21
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,950
Sector H,
right off Longfellow Avenue.

22
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,701
We'll get right back to you.

23
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,454
10-4.

24
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,481
Be careful, Billy.

25
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,909
Michael, check it out.

26
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,748
Jesus!

27
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,580
Christ! Don't... don't shoot me.

28
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,211
Take anything you want,
just don't shoot me.

29
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:44,218
Relax.

30
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:46,760
We're caps, okay?

31
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,599
You fellas got one hell
of a friendly city here, you know that?

32
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:56,061
Just stopped for a red light, and boom!

33
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:00,941
They got my computers!

34
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:06,697
Look at my rig! My poor rig!

35
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,669
You stopped at a red light
in the South Bronx

36
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,409
<i>with 2 truckload of computers?</i>

37
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,288
- Where you from, pal?
- Texas.

38
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,541
Figures.

39
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,468
Welcome to New York.

40
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,993
Hey, you're not taking that in, are you?

41
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,082
Can't leave it in the car,
someone steal it.

42
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,338
Don't give me a hard time, get in there.

43
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,152
Hey, that's enough?

44
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:31,990
- Alright, let's go, let's do it.
- Okay! I'm gonna kick some fuckin' ass.

45
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,248
I'm gonna hit the can.

46
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:42,959
Another round for my two friends.

47
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,460
You got it.

48
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,134
All right, big man, close that door.
Nobody move!

49
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,678
- Michael, get the back door.
- Hey.

50
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,222
All right, everybody over here,
get over to that jukebox.

51
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,395
Let's go! Move! Move!

52
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,358
All right, I want to see rings,
watches, wallets.

53
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,989
Let's go! You, get over there!

54
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,866
Hurry up! Hurry up!

55
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,243
And that means you too, Bozo! Let's go.

56
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,246
Come on, I said right now.

57
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,542
Hey, open that register real quick,

58
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,791
- Before I blow your fuckin' head off.
- Take it easy, I'll open it.

59
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,712
Hey, Bozo, hurry it up!

60
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,296
I want it.

61
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,799
Hey, man, it's not mine.

62
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,131
It's not mine.

63
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,266
Come on, boy,
you're coming with me.

64
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,269
All right, big man.

65
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,855
Hey, what are you lookin' at?

66
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,274
I'll be out in a minute.

67
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,542
Man,
you shouldn't have done that.

68
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,591
Mike! Go around, Mike.

69
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,396
Duck, Billy!

70
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,148
Michael.

71
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,401
Michael!

72
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,444
Get those fuckers, Billy.

73
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,655
Get 'em.

74
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,453
Call 911, get an ambulance.

75
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,041
- Now!
- Yeah, yeah! Sure!

76
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:02,242
Hey! Get off my car, you scumbag!

77
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,831
- Freeze!
- What the hell?

78
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,090
You got five seconds
to get off that fuckin' boat!

79
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,589
Move!

80
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,351
Undo that line.

81
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,400
Come on, we got ya.

82
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,159
I need your fastest boat.

83
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,787
- Who the hell are you?
- Police, give me the keys.

84
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,869
Get the hell out of here!
What are you doing?

85
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,624
Give me the fuckin' keys.

86
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,330
- Where's the boat?
- Manhattan Express. Right over there.

87
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,190
Wong! Get the hell out of that thing!

88
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,215
The harbor police will get him.

89
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,193
He killed Michael, Captain!

90
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,655
Billy, I'm ordering you!

91
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,751
That fuckin' China-man don't give up!

92
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,502
Aviation 0-5-zebra.

93
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:25,539
Officer 1412 in pursuit of a suspect.

94
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:29,506
I'm in the blue-white speedboat below you.
Can you come up over me?

95
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,343
Roger, 1412.

96
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,847
New York control,
this is 0-5-zebra in pursuit.

97
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:37,100
We're turning south
at the Brooklyn Bridge,

98
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:39,102
heading down the river.

99
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,560
That guy's crazy.

100
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,671
Come in closer and drop me a line.

101
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:57,555
On the count of three,
pull me up as fast as you can.

102
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:17,200
One, two, three!

103
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,167
Motherfucker!

104
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,960
Is Daddy coming back soon?

105
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:32,984
You deliberately disobeyed a direct order.

106
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,607
That man killed my partner.

107
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:37,818
That's no excuse for blowing up
half the goddamn harbor!

108
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,575
- Captain, listen...
- You listen to me, Wong!

109
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,862
I don't like it any more than you do
when a cop gets killed.

110
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:45,685
But we're not in the revenge business.

111
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,438
The mayor's been up the commissioner's ass
over this one, Wong.

112
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:51,472
He wants your fuckin' shield,
and if he can't get it, he'll take mine.

113
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,042
I had no choice, Captain.

114
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:56,299
You could have stood by and let
the Harbor Police pick that guy up.

115
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:58,961
But, no, you had to be a big hero.

116
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,346
Billy Wong, super cop!

117
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,966
This is it, Billy.
You're back to crowd control.

118
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,431
- But, Captain...
- No fuckin' buts!

119
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,980
That's final!

120
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:12,607
Maybe next time you'll think twice
before you pull one of your hot-dog stunts.

121
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,608
Now, get outta here!

122
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,645
Nice suit, Garoni,

123
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:38,945
Billy.

124
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,813
You like it? I'm supposed
to blend in with the crowd.

125
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,116
I heard about your fireworks display
in the harbor.

126
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,609
You always did have a flair
for the dramatic, pretty boy.

127
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,949
- How did you get this shit detail?
- The usual.

128
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,206
Some punk pulled a knife on me,
So I kicked his fuckin' teeth in.

129
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:56,460
- And he screamed “Police brutality.”
- All the way to the commissioner's office.

130
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,580
- The usual bullshit.
- The usual bullshit.

131
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,670
You know, if somebody dropped
a bomb in here,

132
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,461
they'd wipe out half the junior diplomats
in New York.

133
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,050
That's why we're here.

134
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,055
That's Laura Shapiro.

135
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,557
I'd like to work undercover with her.

136
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:13,852
No, don't tell me.

137
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,604
You guys are cops?

138
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,900
We're that obvious?

139
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:18,186
You're not so bad,

140
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:21,444
but that friend of yours,
he sticks out like a sore thumb.

141
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,489
Look, you guys allowed to drink?

142
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,991
- Can I get you a beer or something?
- No, thanks.

143
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,745
Tell you what... if you wait 'til I go
off duty, I'll buy you a drink.

144
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,998
Yeah?
I just might take you up on that.

145
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,830
Um, excuse me, gentlemen.

146
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,585
I have to mingle.

147
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:43,842
That bum Shapiro probably uses
his own daughter to launder money.

148
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:47,303
Listen, you lousy Chink bastard,

149
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:49,259
you keep bugging Mr. Shapiro's daughter,

150
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,765
they'll scrape you off the floor
with a putty knife.

151
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,072
His name's Benny Garucci.
He's an ex-karate champ.

152
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:06,902
I'd like to bust his fuckin' head open
with a crowbar.

153
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:09,761
But you're gonna have to hold him...
He's a tough son of a bitch.

154
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,236
I wonder why Shapiro needs
that kind of muscle here?

155
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,260
Are you kiddin'? He can afford to have
the whole fuckin' Marine Corps

156
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:18,001
standin' by to protect him
if he wanted to.

157
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:21,170
That fuck owns half of Manhattan, Billy.

158
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:25,341
I wouldn't mind teaching Garucci
a little lesson in manners someday.

159
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,095
Ladies and gentlemen,

160
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:35,602
Laura Shapiro Marketing is very pleased
to introduce to New York City

161
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:39,105
the sensational Edmund Wong

162
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:44,944
and his fabulous collection
of shimmering cocktail wear.

163
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,949
- Nice dress.
- Nice tits.

164
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,009
Everybody, on the floor!

165
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,311
Don't move! Back off!

166
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,818
No!

167
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:12,197
No!

168
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,841
New York's finest.
Can't even keep a girl from being snatched

169
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:24,646
- tight out from under your goddamn noses.
- We had our guns out.

170
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:27,238
You might as well had your dicks out
for all the good it did.

171
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:29,708
I'll take my dick out
when I'm going to use it, Captain.

172
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,960
We couldn't shoot
without hitting the girl!

173
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:34,062
I think you two men
did the right thing.

174
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,217
Well, thank you, sir.
Any word from Shapiro?

175
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,931
He has no idea why
his daughter was snatched.

176
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:44,897
We've been monitoring his phone
for the past 12 hours.

177
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:48,484
No ransom demands. No orders. Nothing.

178
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,735
You might find this interesting.

179
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:52,532
What is it?

180
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:55,366
A record of all the phone calls made
in the last 12 hours

181
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:57,117
by Shapiro's hood, Benny Garucci.

182
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:59,620
Six calls all to the same number.

183
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,781
- Country code 8-5-2.
- Hong Kong.

184
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:05,164
- How the hell d'ya get this?
- Friend of mine at the phone company.

185
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,328
- The blonde?
- No, the redhead.

186
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,747
What the hell does all this
got to do with Hong Kong?

187
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:14,218
There's somebody waiting outside
who might just be able to answer that.

188
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:17,221
Send in Mr. Cantrell, please.

189
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:23,894
Men, this is Bob Cantrell
from the Justice Department.

190
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:29,191
Are these the men
who kidnapped Laura Shapiro?

191
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,111
Well, how the fuck should we know?
They were wearing masks.

192
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:34,407
Excuse me, lady.

193
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:35,864
What's this all about?

194
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:41,120
These men all work for a powerful
Hong Kong crime boss named Harold Ko.

195
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:42,957
Harold Ko.

196
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,500
What, do you know him?

197
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:46,709
Anybody who knows Hong Kong knows Ko.

198
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:50,421
- A real snake.
- Yeah, and a tough one to catch.

199
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:53,045
Now, we've suspected Shapiro and Ko

200
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,463
of running drugs
from Hong Kong to New York for years,

201
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:57,723
but we've never been able
to pin anything on them.

202
00:25:58,015 --> 00:26:00,215
Why the hell would Ko want
to snatch Shapiro's daughter?

203
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:02,892
We don't know. Maybe they've had
a falling-out of some kind.

204
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:05,895
Whatever the reason,
there's a good possibility

205
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,397
that Laura Shapiro's now being held
in Hong Kong.

206
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:11,572
It's impossible. Nobody could smuggle
a girl into Hong Kong that quickly.

207
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:13,569
- It's impossible.
- Not for Ko.

208
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:16,652
He's right. Ko's got most of the island
in his back pocket.

209
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,567
Sir, if Laura Shapiro's in Hong Kong,
we should check it out.

210
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,031
Forget it, Wong.

211
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:25,782
My Chinatown contacts can give me the names
of some good informers over there.

212
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:27,541
It might be worth a try.

213
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,850
Garoni could come with me.
He knows Hong Kong from his Vietnam days.

214
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,421
You're way out of line, Wong.

215
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:34,383
Like it.

216
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:39,003
If you men could find Laura Shapiro
and pin it on Ko,

217
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:42,264
you might just be able to shut off
the largest heroin pipeline

218
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,890
to ever come out of the Orient.

219
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:46,143
Okay, we got nothing to lose.

220
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:51,604
Why don't you two men go to Hong Kong
as special advisors to the local police

221
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:53,817
and see what you can come up with.

222
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:55,696
Yes, sir.

223
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:57,406
See you, Captain.

224
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:58,991
Thank you, Captain.

225
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:30,291
Thank you.

226
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,249
Here's the keys to that Jeep
you asked for.

227
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,750
Thank you.

228
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:36,126
- You sure you don't want a driver?
- No, we're okay.

229
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:39,541
Thanks for getting this through customs
for us, Inspector. We really appreciate.

230
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,443
Superintendent Whitehead will meet you
tomorrow afternoon at four.

231
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,960
- You got it, Billy?
- Yeah, thanks, see you tomorrow.

232
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,260
- Thanks a lot, Inspector.
- {Billy] Good night. - Sleep well.

233
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,690
Man, you love it?

234
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:06,909
We could stay at a better place, you know.

235
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:08,869
We're on an expense account.

236
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:12,156
Nostalgia, Billy, my boy. Nostalgia.

237
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,413
Memories of magic nights on R&R.

238
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:18,045
I remember during Nam,

239
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:21,048
there was nothing around here
but a bunch of horny grunts, you know?

240
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,250
And the women, Billy...

241
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:27,137
The women. Madam Mia.

242
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:30,300
And besides, nobody's gonna look for us
in a dump like this.

243
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:34,603
- What's that?
- An old Chinese coin.

244
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:37,105
A friend of mine in Chinatown
gave this to me.

245
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:39,108
It's sort of a calling card.

246
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:41,360
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

247
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,447
Looks like a bunch of shit to me.

248
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,750
I still say it's ludicrous.

249
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,707
The idea that anyone could smuggle
a girl into Hong Kong

250
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:02,465
without my office knowing about it
is simply impossible.

251
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,295
Improbable, not impossible.

252
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,219
Now, listen to me, you two.

253
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:08,754
I spoke to your captain,

254
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:11,807
and he told me
about your Dodge City tactics.

255
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:15,310
We don't appreciate people like you
in Hong Kong.

256
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:16,811
I want you to assure me

257
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:18,907
that you'll behave
with the utmost discretion.

258
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:22,359
Discretion is my middle name, sir.

259
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,861
Show them out, Inspector.

260
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:26,157
Yes, sir.

261
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:28,865
Thank you, sir.

262
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:37,499
Gentlemen, you must forgive
the superintendent.

263
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:39,956
He's been trying to nab Ko for years.

264
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,417
Considers it a personal mission in life.

265
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:45,556
I think he's worried you will succeed
where he's failed all these years.

266
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:48,510
Don't worry about it, Inspector.
I'm used to pissing' off superiors.

267
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,762
We ran down the phone number you gave us.

268
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,765
Shanghai Massage Parlor.

269
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,940
That's where Benny Garucci called
from New York.

270
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:56,894
Apparently, it's a rough place.

271
00:30:57,189 --> 00:31:00,272
They, don't necessarily specialize
in giving massages,

272
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:01,567
if you know what I mean.

273
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,024
You bet your ass I do.

274
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,233
Let's check this place out.
Maybe we can shake Ko's tree a little.

275
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,862
Billy, you're a mind reader.

276
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:09,489
You two be careful.

277
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:13,244
One of the reasons Ko has managed to stay
out of prison for so long

278
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,996
is he doesn't mind killing anyone
who threatens him.

279
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,288
If he thinks you're getting too close
to finding Laura Shapiro,

280
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:22,294
your names will be on the lips
of every assassin in Hong Kong.

281
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,629
It's a friendly little town
you got here, Inspector.

282
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,339
Welcome to Hong Kong.

283
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:38,810
- This is my favorite part of town, Billy.
- We're supposed to be working, Garoni.

284
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:40,826
You know what they say...
All work, no play.

285
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:42,586
Playing around here can get us killed.

286
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,139
- Whoops.
- {man] Sorry.

287
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:47,069
At least you'd die with a smile
on your face.

288
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,919
- $105, please.
- Thank you.

289
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,490
Thank you. Please come again.

290
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:57,996
Welcome, gentlemen.
First time here?

291
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:01,454
We're just a couple of poor lost souls
from New York.

292
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:05,212
A good friend of ours recommended
this place very highly.

293
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:07,464
We have many friends in New York.

294
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,670
Maybe you remember our friend...

295
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,010
- His name's Benny Garucci.
- Yeah, Benny Garucci...

296
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:15,225
Benny Garucci, he really loves this place.
He talks about it all the time.

297
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:17,117
- Right, Billy?
- Right.

298
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,928
So sorry, we... we have so many friends,
I can't remember them all.

299
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:24,815
But I'm sure we can make your visit here
very exciting.

300
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,901
- Follow, please.
- All right!

301
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,363
Hey...

302
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,240
keep your eyes open.

303
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,949
Don't worry, Billy boy,
I wouldn't miss this for the world.

304
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:40,122
Billy, don't let this guy sneak up on me.

305
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,504
Hey, Garoni?

306
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,381
I'm gonna get you.

307
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:03,854
You know, you're very pretty.

308
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,439
You're very pretty.

309
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:12,104
My goodness gracious,
what have we got here?

310
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,407
Billy.

311
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,906
Yeah.

312
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,030
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

313
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:25,251
Billy, look at this?
Whichever one you want is yours.

314
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:28,003
You made the wrong choice.

315
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:29,754
That's... I'm in love, this is mine.

316
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:33,259
I'm your friend, you got to take care
of your friends, don't you?

317
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,510
Come on, you're with me!

318
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,142
Whoo! Excuse me.

319
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:51,651
No.

320
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,238
Call in the other girl, okay?
Go ahead, make the phone call.

321
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,490
Becky, please.

322
00:33:57,786 --> 00:34:00,506
I remember these holes when
they were a little smaller, you know?

323
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,167
What have we got here?

324
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,096
Will come, too?

325
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,095
Will I come too?

326
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:28,563
This chick loves me.

327
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,403
You love my clothes?

328
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:36,939
I love your clothes.

329
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:48,500
You remind me
of someone I knew in Saigon.

330
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:50,836
You know Saigon.

331
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:54,423
You're very beautiful-really.

332
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:56,841
No, you are.

333
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:08,350
How old are you? 18?

334
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:09,854
You guess?

335
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,607
- Excuse me.
- {Becky] Yes.

336
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:24,950
She really knows the way
to a man's heart.

337
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,420
When did you grow a beard?

338
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:04,701
Yes.

339
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,708
- What the hell?
- Yelling]

340
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:28,930
Holy shit!

341
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:37,859
What the hell?

342
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:48,783
Hold it!

343
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:50,288
You punk!

344
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,793
Drop it, motherfucker!

345
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:25,550
No, you drop it,

346
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:27,888
motherfucker.

347
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,096
Shit, what the fuck's
going on here?

348
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,009
Dress them and take 'em to my office.

349
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,768
I want to talk to them

350
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:37,520
before we kill 'em.

351
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:42,684
Hey.

352
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,694
A guy can't take a bath in peace?

353
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,032
- Why did Shapiro send you?
- Shapiro?

354
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:56,957
- Hey, wait a...
- I think you know why he sent us.

355
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,917
Shapiro?

356
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:03,205
Why, sure, he's very angry
at you people, very angry.

357
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,419
Shapiro's angry at us?

358
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:06,753
That's right, yeah.

359
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,893
- But he's the one who...
- Don't say anything!

360
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,841
This man is a New York cop.

361
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,346
Cops?

362
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,553
I ain't no cop, I'm a tourist.

363
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:17,540
- Maybe he's a cop. You a cop?
- Do I look like a cop?

364
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:19,271
Well, he doesn't look like a cop.

365
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:21,022
Take 'em out.

366
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:22,648
Kill 'em.

367
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,287
Tell Harold Ko we're in town.

368
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,163
His days are numbered.

369
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,667
It's never wise to make threats,
my young friend.

370
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,253
Especially ones you can't keep.

371
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:46,172
That's not a threat,

372
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:47,799
that's a promise.

373
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:50,510
Let's go.

374
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:55,890
Whatever you say, partner.

375
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:05,191
Well, you're calling the shots, Billy.

376
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,443
- What do we do next?
- Here.

377
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,904
What is it with this coin?

378
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,407
Tomorrow,
we're gonna cash this in.

379
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:14,062
If we use it right, it may tell us

380
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:16,787
everything we want to know
about Mr. Ko.

381
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,306
This Lee Hing, is he an informer?

382
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,099
He used to be.

383
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:42,854
He's retired, but he's still tapped
into the whole Hong Kong underworld.

384
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,436
Well, what makes you think he'll help us?

385
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:47,935
He may not, but do you have anything
better to do today?

386
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:50,676
Well, as a matter of fact,
I could probably think of somethin'.

387
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,989
Can you go to the boat
of Lee Hing Dock N' Shop?

388
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,490
Okay, okay.

389
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:57,785
What happened to your eye?

390
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:00,038
It's swollen. I think somethin' bit me.

391
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:04,500
You better watch out for Hong Kong mosquito
wearing high heels.

392
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:12,881
Hey, that's the jumbo restaurant!
Boy, do I remember that.

393
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:15,469
But I don't remember
the rest of this new shit.

394
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:18,807
It all looks kinda different to me, Billy.

395
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:14,946
There's Lee Hing's boat.

396
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,450
Looks like
our friend's doing okay.

397
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:48,813
I bring you greetings
from a friend in New York.

398
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:53,568
- [Who is your friend?
- His name is Tin Ho.

399
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:58,656
Tin Ho is a very old and honorable friend.

400
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,080
Well, Mr. Hing, look,
we've just come...

401
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,807
You are police officers from New York.

402
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:06,372
You have come here looking for a girl
who was kidnapped by Ko.

403
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:09,580
Gentlemen, there are no secrets
in Hong Kong.

404
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,546
Come, sit and have some tea with me.

405
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:18,798
If's the least I can do

406
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:22,138
seeing as how you have come
all the way to see me...

407
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:23,889
for nothing.

408
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:26,643
Soo Ling, cha for our guests.

409
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:28,644
Why is our trip for nothing?

410
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,398
Surely I could.

411
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:33,941
But I will not.

412
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,332
My father is retired.

413
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:37,945
Ahoy, Uncle Hing!

414
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:42,241
I've got a charter in a few hours.
Can I hit you for some supplies?

415
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:43,948
On credit, I suppose.

416
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:46,705
At least I'm consistent.

417
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:50,258
Hey, how ya doin' there, buddy?
I got something for ya, look at this...

418
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:52,703
- Straight from the mainland. There you go.
- Thank you!

419
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,086
You're welcome.

420
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:58,793
Mr. Hing, if you know anything
about where Ko is keeping this girl,

421
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:01,803
- you got to tell us.
- My daughter was quite correct.

422
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:03,884
I am retired.

423
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:06,641
But a man like you
must maintain his contacts.

424
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:08,552
Could you have them find out for us?

425
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:14,942
Gentlemen, dealing in information
like that is extremely dangerous,

426
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:18,569
especially when it involves people
like Harold Ko.

427
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:20,865
Listen, if there's something
you're not telling us,

428
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:23,654
we can take you in
and let the local cops deal with you.

429
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:25,409
Are these men bothering you, sir?

430
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:28,246
That is not necessary, Stan.

431
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:32,166
These gentlemen are simply tired
and frustrated.

432
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,081
Forgive them.

433
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:36,462
They are dangerous, father.

434
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:38,464
Make them leave before they bring trouble.

435
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,717
Don't look now,
but I think they already have.

436
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,350
Damn it,
they must have followed us, Billy.

437
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:50,851
No.

438
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:16,582
- Move the boat faster.
- Okay.

439
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:00,963
Watch out! There's a bike!

440
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,396
- Hey!
- Hey!

441
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:46,944
Quicker!

442
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:03,563
<i>You're gonna take me to Ko
right now, asshole.</i>

443
00:49:25,588 --> 00:49:26,794
Shit!

444
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,794
You see? You see the trouble you caused?

445
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:37,805
- Why wouldn't you leave us alone?
- Hey, give me a break.

446
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:42,931
Tin Ho has asked a favor of me.

447
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:46,105
- I must honor it.
- Do you think that's wise, Uncle?

448
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:48,850
Maybe not.

449
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:52,111
But sometimes honor is not wise.

450
00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:55,990
Can you tell me where Ko's
holding Laura Shapiro?

451
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:59,410
Not yet, but my friends will know.

452
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,705
Do you have a picture of the girl?

453
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:06,541
Right here.

454
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:12,548
Come back here tomorrow.
Stan will know where to find me.

455
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,800
Well, thanks, we really appreciate it.

456
00:50:15,888 --> 00:50:17,344
Thanks.

457
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:25,394
What the fuck is this?

458
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:50,044
- Who's this?
- I hope we can say I'm a friend.

459
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:51,754
Listen, you creep,

460
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,507
it's not your money we want,

461
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,508
it's your ass.

462
00:50:57,012 --> 00:51:00,471
I'm sorry to hear that.
Goodbye, Mr. Wong.

463
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,267
Danny.

464
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:20,657
Holy shit, Garoni!

465
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,781
Get the window, Billy. I got downstairs.

466
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:37,083
I must kill him.

467
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:30,838
Where are you hiding Laura Shapiro?

468
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:33,106
[Take me there! Talk, quick!

469
00:52:53,379 --> 00:52:56,588
- Don't move! Raise your hands!
- Don't move!

470
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,646
<i>Sit down.</i>

471
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:22,988
I spoke to your captain again.

472
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:24,990
He assured me that a machine gun

473
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:27,947
is most definitely not standard issue
to New York City police.

474
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:31,239
I never go anywhere in Southeast Asia
without an Uzi.

475
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:32,748
Do you know what this is?

476
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,410
This is an initial estimate
of the damage you caused.

477
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:38,751
Look, at least we know
we're getting close to Ko.

478
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:41,461
Otherwise, he wouldn't have tried
to wipe us out like that.

479
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,800
You have evidence
that Ko was behind the attack?

480
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:45,294
Jolly good, let's see it then.

481
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:46,877
I think it's obvious, don't you?

482
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:50,350
You want to know what kind of reputation
Harold Ko has in Hong Kong? Read that!

483
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:56,364
He spent three million
American dollars to purchase that horse.

484
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:59,316
And he's holding a press conference
this afternoon to announce

485
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:02,444
that all its race winnings will be donated
to the colony's orphan fund.

486
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:04,697
<i>He's 3 real fuckin' peach.</i>

487
00:54:05,451 --> 00:54:06,907
I'm warning you two.

488
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:10,870
I've already wired your commissioner
to ask him to take you off this case.

489
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:14,792
If I have to set eyes on you again,
there'll be bloody hell to pay!

490
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,805
- Can we go now?
- Get the hell out of here!

491
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:33,267
This Whitehead's a real schmuck.

492
00:54:33,562 --> 00:54:36,520
- So what are we gonna do next, Billy?
- There's still Lee Hing.

493
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:39,022
Let's hope he comes up with something.

494
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:41,525
In the meantime, do you like horses?

495
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:43,443
I love horses!

496
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,457
{applause]

497
00:55:02,508 --> 00:55:03,964
Ladies and gentlemen,

498
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:09,220
as you all know, Stolen Fortune,
the most successful horse of all time,

499
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:13,807
sired only one son
before he was killed in a tragic fire.

500
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:20,436
The son, Breakaway Threat,
was the horse they said no one could buy.

501
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:29,114
Thank you.

502
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:35,996
Stop the car! Stop the car!

503
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:47,257
It's my pleasure to present
my latest acquisition,

504
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:51,754
Breakaway Threat,
to the people of Hong Kong.

505
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:09,071
Mr. Ko, how much money
do you think Breakaway Threat

506
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:11,573
will be able lo earn for the orphan fund?

507
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:16,620
We hope to donate
almost two million dollars

508
00:56:20,586 --> 00:56:24,045
Mr. Ko, how soon will Breakaway Threat
be able to race?

509
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:28,924
Breakaway Threat will be running
one week from Saturday.

510
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,130
{camera shutters]

511
00:56:31,597 --> 00:56:33,053
Hey, Ko!

512
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:38,680
You left your briefcase
in our hotel room.

513
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:40,811
I think you are mistaken, sir.

514
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:45,066
Well, if this isn't your briefcase,

515
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:49,653
then this isn't your money either.

516
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:00,455
Excuse me.

517
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:02,124
Money!

518
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:14,594
I don't think
this guy Ko likes you, Billy.

519
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:16,096
That's too bad.

520
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:18,231
Are you surprised
to see Garucci here?

521
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:21,601
<i>Not really. Right now, we have
mare important business to take care of.</i>

522
00:57:21,897 --> 00:57:24,355
You follow Garucci.
I'll go see what Lee Hing's dug up.

523
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:27,065
Whatever you say, kid.

524
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:34,572
If your father can help us,

525
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:37,781
we can shut down
one of the worst criminals in the world.

526
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,912
There's no dishonor in that.

527
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:42,665
Everything will be fine. You'll see.

528
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:46,584
Cove ahead.

529
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:49,296
Shit.

530
00:57:51,051 --> 00:57:52,507
No!

531
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:56,386
No.

532
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:03,893
Father!

533
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:05,895
Father!

534
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,686
No!

535
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:10,693
Soo Ling, no! Billy,
for Christ's sake, keep her back!

536
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:12,444
Soo Ling!

537
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:19,118
No!

538
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:25,371
You... you're the cause of this.
You killed my father!

539
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:28,832
No, I didn't kill your father!
Harold Ko killed your father.

540
00:58:29,131 --> 00:58:31,088
I hate you!

541
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:36,302
If you hate me, then you must hate Ko.
Help me find him.

542
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,388
Help me destroy the man
who killed your father.

543
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,267
Father!

544
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:14,423
My father told me to help you.

545
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:19,261
Even though he's dead, I must obey.

546
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:22,723
The fortune-teller was a friend
of my father's.

547
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:25,642
If my father found out anything,

548
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,687
the fortune-teller will know.

549
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:38,989
You look for a girl
that was taken from New York by Mr. Ko.

550
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:45,370
- How do you know?
- The I Ching tells all.

551
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:47,372
Nothing is hidden.

552
00:59:48,502 --> 00:59:49,742
There has been war.

553
00:59:50,045 --> 00:59:51,251
Between Ko and Shapiro?

554
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:54,254
Yes, but the war is over.

555
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:59,339
A man has come across the water
to make peace.

556
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:02,512
- Benny Garucci.
- Yes.

557
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:07,810
My people tell me
a pact will be made tomorrow night

558
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:10,346
and the girl will be returned.

559
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:13,649
- Where's the girl?
- I do not know.

560
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:16,819
But you must not look for her.

561
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:20,363
The I Ching is not good.

562
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:23,867
I see only danger,

563
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:27,704
death, and betrayal.

564
01:00:32,796 --> 01:00:34,002
Thanks.

565
01:00:42,931 --> 01:00:44,137
Wait a minute.

566
01:00:45,517 --> 01:00:47,599
I must say a prayer for my father

567
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:49,601
and consult the I Ching.

568
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:55,065
What do your sticks say?
Is the fortune-teller right?

569
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:59,733
I ask the questions, Billy.
But I never read the answers.

570
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:16,312
- Close the gate.
- Thanks.

571
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:55,886
I trust you found the girl well?

572
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:58,396
Yes, sir, just as you promised.

573
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:09,366
When Mr. Shapiro refused to pay
for my last shipment,

574
01:03:09,703 --> 01:03:11,410
I lost much face.

575
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:14,947
I trust it will never happen again.

576
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:17,457
It was a simple misunderstanding, sir.

577
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:21,670
Be assured that Mr. Shapiro remains
your faithful friend and partner.

578
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:24,752
He wishes no ll feeling towards you.

579
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:28,760
I'm glad to hear this.

580
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:30,637
But Mr. Shapiro is worried.

581
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:32,890
Those two cops from New York,

582
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:34,891
they're getting too close
to our operation.

583
01:03:36,438 --> 01:03:37,894
Calm your fears.

584
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:40,647
The girl shall be returned to you tonight.

585
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:44,230
As for those two police officers,

586
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:47,612
they caused me great dishonor.

587
01:03:48,616 --> 01:03:50,152
They will be taken care of.

588
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:57,039
Garucci went to this big container shipyard
before he went to see Ko.

589
01:03:57,334 --> 01:03:59,134
Now, it's my guess
he was checking on the girl

590
01:03:59,419 --> 01:04:02,036
before arranging an exchange
with the big man.

591
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:05,206
The fortune-teller said the exchange
will be made tonight.

592
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:08,967
So, we have to break in and get
the girl out before that can happen.

593
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:10,593
Tall order, man.

594
01:04:10,889 --> 01:04:13,472
The rumors I hear say
the place is Ko's drug factory.

595
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:15,223
It be heavily guarded.

596
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:17,930
- Maybe we should call Whitehead, Billy.
- Hold it.

597
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:20,186
We're not sure it's the drug factory.

598
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:22,685
We're not sure Laura Shapiro's there.

599
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:25,191
If we're wrong,
Whitehead will ship us home.

600
01:04:26,154 --> 01:04:27,610
<i>I will go with you.</i>

601
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:30,321
That's a great idea.

602
01:04:30,617 --> 01:04:33,325
We know you can, Soo Ling.

603
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:36,032
But someone has to stay behind
just in case we're caught.

604
01:04:36,456 --> 01:04:37,456
That's your job.

605
01:04:37,749 --> 01:04:38,749
He's right, honey.

606
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,958
Now, if you don't hear from us
three hours after we hit the place,

607
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:44,210
you call Whitehead, understand? Call.

608
01:04:44,506 --> 01:04:46,146
Don't worry, Soo Ling, I'll go with them.

609
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:48,090
You have experience in this kind of thing?

610
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:49,841
Yeah, you might say that.

611
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:52,131
<i>Seals, US. Navy.</i>

612
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:58,016
As a matter of fact, I just happen to have
some of my old gear with me.

613
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:00,018
It might just come in handy.

614
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:07,567
What the fuck is that?

615
01:05:08,196 --> 01:05:10,153
I got that
from an Israeli friend of mine.

616
01:05:10,532 --> 01:05:12,739
That's a portable, six-shot, 20 cannon.

617
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:14,490
I'll be a son of a bitch.

618
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:17,321
I ain't never seen anything like that.
Have you, Billy?

619
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:18,786
No.

620
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:29,836
The entrance is about four containers in.
It's a gray door.

621
01:05:30,135 --> 01:05:32,375
About four containers on top of that,
there's an air duct

622
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:35,504
connected to an air conditioner...
That's how we go in. All right?

623
01:05:35,807 --> 01:05:37,487
- All right.
- {Billy] Let's do it.

624
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:38,848
Okay.

625
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:46,648
Okay. Take the clothes and leave.

626
01:05:55,535 --> 01:05:58,243
You wait here.
I'll bring down Laura Shapiro.

627
01:05:58,705 --> 01:06:00,161
She better be all right.

628
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:33,338
Hurry up! Quicker!
Don't you want to go home?

629
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:37,175
Hold it tight. Quick.

630
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:41,213
Move it to this side, slightly.
Right, hold it flat.

631
01:07:41,849 --> 01:07:44,307
- That's right. Okay, okay. That's it.

632
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:48,186
Go in.

633
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:16,338
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

634
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:39,862
- I'll go first.
- I'll be right behind you, Billy boy.

635
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:41,518
- You got my back, Jones?
- Got it.

636
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:42,990
All right, let's go.

637
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:16,497
Hey, it's so hot in here.
Turn up the air conditioning.

638
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:18,002
Okay.

639
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:38,522
Drop your guns.

640
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:54,789
Billy!

641
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:57,124
Billy!

642
01:10:57,837 --> 01:10:58,952
Billy.

643
01:11:01,799 --> 01:11:05,008
I told you, the Japanese make
great bullet-proof vests.

644
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:08,962
Let's get those fuckers!

645
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:15,017
Everybody out!
We're gonna blow this joint. Let's go!

646
01:11:15,313 --> 01:11:16,769
- Come on, move it!
- Out!

647
01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:18,771
Am I talking to myself here? Go!

648
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:21,107
- Come on, let's go!
- Let's move it! Go!

649
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:25,445
- Hold it! Up, up, up!
- What is it?

650
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:28,698
- Don't you understand English?
- The guard has the key.

651
01:11:28,993 --> 01:11:30,713
Give me the key,
or I'll blow your dick off!

652
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:32,406
- Key, key! Come on!
- Key! Key!

653
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:37,928
What's the matter, you never seen
four naked broads before? Let's go!

654
01:11:38,211 --> 01:11:40,748
Goad to see you again, Laura.

655
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:43,447
- Yeah. Hell of a way to get a date.
- That's very funny.

656
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:44,839
Got it?

657
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:47,174
The other one!

658
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:54,348
- Hurry! Hurry!
- Go, quickly!

659
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:56,601
- Jump, jump!
- Go, go!

660
01:11:58,648 --> 01:12:01,106
- Go! Go, quickly!
- {man #2] Let's go!

661
01:12:01,692 --> 01:12:04,150
- What the fuck's going on?
- They're gonna blow the lab up.

662
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,246
Some more.

663
01:12:17,542 --> 01:12:18,998
- Got it.
- You got it?

664
01:12:19,293 --> 01:12:20,749
- Go!
- Okay.

665
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:25,109
- You got it? You almost ready?
- Yeah.

666
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:29,968
Come on, Kid,
let's go while I'm pumped!

667
01:12:30,513 --> 01:12:31,969
- Okay, I'm ready.
- Let's go!

668
01:12:32,515 --> 01:12:33,971
- You with me?
- Yes!

669
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:37,805
This sucker's got keys.
Come on, let's roll it.

670
01:12:38,104 --> 01:12:39,310
Let's get the -

671
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:09,715
Get him!

672
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:17,848
Shoot!

673
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:23,520
- fuzzing]

674
01:13:47,548 --> 01:13:49,004
Where's Laura Shapiro?

675
01:13:58,017 --> 01:14:00,475
The man asked you a question.

676
01:14:03,481 --> 01:14:04,937
Fuck you.

677
01:14:13,908 --> 01:14:16,366
Surely you know we can make you talk.

678
01:14:18,496 --> 01:14:20,703
I got news for you, Ko. You're finished.

679
01:14:20,998 --> 01:14:23,205
You're already dead
and you don't know it yet.

680
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:29,587
This is all so unnecessary.

681
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:32,256
Enjoy yourself, Benny.

682
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:53,652
Hello?

683
01:14:54,281 --> 01:14:56,488
This is Billy Wong.
You've got a problem, Ko.

684
01:14:56,784 --> 01:14:58,070
I've got a problem?

685
01:14:58,369 --> 01:15:02,533
If you don't give me Garoni,
I'm not releasing Laura Shapiro to anyone.

686
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:05,873
If you kill Garoni, she disappears.

687
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:07,624
I'm surprised.

688
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:12,088
I had no idea your partner's life
meant so much to you.

689
01:15:12,383 --> 01:15:14,590
{ believe we can do business, Mr. Wong.

690
01:15:15,136 --> 01:15:17,594
Shall we say, in my shipping yard?

691
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:19,254
In two hours.

692
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:21,013
I'll be there.

693
01:15:24,812 --> 01:15:27,770
Stan will take you to Whitehead.
He will get you home.

694
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:31,899
Look, I don't mind staying in hiding
until you can get Garoni back.

695
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:33,400
That's okay.

696
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:35,311
Get Laura to Whitehead.

697
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:40,154
Tell him to have as many men as possible
at Ko's shipyard at exactly 7:00 AM.

698
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:45,538
If he's late, there's going to be
lots of dead bodies to pick up.

699
01:15:46,167 --> 01:15:48,784
- You're not going in there alone, are you?
- Yeah.

700
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:53,045
This is between me,
Benny Garucci, and Harald Ko.

701
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:13,148
- Open the gate.
- Open the gate!

702
01:16:38,636 --> 01:16:40,092
Raise your hands.

703
01:16:48,395 --> 01:16:49,851
Okay, go in.

704
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:30,551
Mr. Wong.

705
01:17:33,732 --> 01:17:35,097
How nice to see you.

706
01:17:35,943 --> 01:17:37,149
Where's Garoni?

707
01:17:37,444 --> 01:17:39,401
Where's Laura Shapiro?

708
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:41,737
My partner first.

709
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:43,614
But of course.

710
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:53,498
You bastard.

711
01:17:53,794 --> 01:17:56,252
I've lived up to my part
of the bargain, Mr. Wong.

712
01:17:56,881 --> 01:17:58,497
Now, where is the girl?

713
01:17:58,799 --> 01:17:59,834
She's safe.

714
01:18:00,134 --> 01:18:01,590
She certainly is.

715
01:18:03,012 --> 01:18:04,012
Whitehead!

716
01:18:04,263 --> 01:18:05,845
I warned you, Wong.

717
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:09,098
Mr. Ko is a very influential man
in Hong Kong.

718
01:18:09,602 --> 01:18:10,808
You son of a bitch.

719
01:18:11,103 --> 01:18:12,309
Yes.

720
01:18:12,605 --> 01:18:14,061
But a well-paid one.

721
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:19,860
Well, it seems that this affair
will come to a happy ending after all.

722
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:26,449
There only remains
one last piece of entertainment.

723
01:19:24,301 --> 01:19:25,837
Come on, big boy.

724
01:20:44,631 --> 01:20:46,338
You son of a bitch!

725
01:20:52,097 --> 01:20:53,303
Come on.

726
01:23:17,117 --> 01:23:18,824
This way! Over there!

727
01:23:23,290 --> 01:23:26,499
- Hey! Don't move!
- Stand still! Don't go!

728
01:23:28,295 --> 01:23:30,457
Soo Ling, you help Laura.
I'll take care of Garoni.

729
01:23:34,885 --> 01:23:36,842
Going somewhere,
Superintendent?

730
01:23:49,107 --> 01:23:51,565
Start the engine!

731
01:23:52,361 --> 01:23:53,817
Stop him!

732
01:23:55,113 --> 01:23:56,319
Get me out of here.

733
01:24:27,437 --> 01:24:28,437
No.

734
01:24:39,157 --> 01:24:40,613
Run him down!

735
01:24:51,878 --> 01:24:52,878
Shit.

736
01:25:39,551 --> 01:25:41,508
Jesus Christ.

737
01:25:44,264 --> 01:25:47,222
Give me that fuckin' thing.
Give it to me! Come on.

738
01:29:35,745 --> 01:29:40,410
In recognition of service
above and beyond the call of duty,

739
01:29:40,709 --> 01:29:45,954
which resulted in the forfeiture
of over 2,000 pounds of illicit drugs

740
01:29:46,256 --> 01:29:48,998
en route from Hong Kong to New York,

741
01:29:49,301 --> 01:29:51,463
the Police Department
of the City of New York

742
01:29:51,761 --> 01:29:56,005
is proud to bestow
its departmental Medal of Honor

743
01:29:56,308 --> 01:29:58,265
on Officers Wong and Garoni.

744
01:30:19,205 --> 01:30:21,162
Thanks, Captain. It's good to be home.

745
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:22,821
What's our next assignment, Cap?

746
01:30:23,084 --> 01:30:24,290
Crowd control.

747
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:31,540
Congratulations. Well done.

748
01:30:31,843 --> 01:30:34,551
- Well done, Garoni.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
