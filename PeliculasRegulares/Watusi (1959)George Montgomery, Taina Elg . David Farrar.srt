00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:26,300

2
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,250

3
00:02:55,371 --> 00:02:57,250
Welcome to mantzaco village, sir.

4
00:02:57,248 --> 00:03:00,793
We don't often have the the pleasure of visitors.

5
00:03:00,793 --> 00:03:02,879
What's going on there?

6
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,448
Just passing time.
do you like safari, sir?

7
00:03:09,448 --> 00:03:13,097
I have the best boys and best guns.
there is not alike in all of Africa.

8
00:03:13,097 --> 00:03:16,225
- Thank you, Mohammed Khan.
- You know me, sir?

9
00:03:16,225 --> 00:03:19,770
Only about you. Where can I find  Mr. Masters?

10
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:23,315
Mr. Masters? he left here many years ago.

11
00:03:23,524 --> 00:03:25,192
many.

12
00:03:26,027 --> 00:03:28,113
The Groveror is still the best hotel?

13
00:03:28,216 --> 00:03:31,344
The only one.
 but I can arrange, mister...

14
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:33,117
  I don't seem to recall you.

15
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:35,515
 Were you here on safari,before the great war?

16
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,625
No. do you have any idea where I can find 
a gun bearer called  kanda?

17
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:43,336
No, sir, I do not!

18
00:03:43,962 --> 00:03:45,421
hey!

19
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,130
Do you want a beer?

20
00:03:51,156 --> 00:03:52,520
Thank you.

21
00:03:58,977 --> 00:04:01,000
Jim-Jim, two beers.

22
00:04:04,086 --> 00:04:07,214
- Make yourself at home.
- Thank you.

23
00:04:08,361 --> 00:04:11,281
We don't see many strangers
in these parts

24
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:14,200
- My name is Rick Cobb
- I'm ha...

25
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:27,860
And I thought you were a greenhorn
looking for a safari.

26
00:04:27,964 --> 00:04:29,737
- I am.
- Which?

27
00:04:29,841 --> 00:04:33,491
- Greenhorn.
- Yes, with Swahili and all...

28
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:37,100
Oh, this is just what I needed.

29
00:04:42,145 --> 00:04:45,500
Ah, beer is the only thing that made 
this stinking place bearable.

30
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,300
Seems quite good to me.

31
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,700
It's your first trip to africa?

32
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,000
I landed in Zanzibar a couple weeks ago.

33
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,000
- Great day in my life.
- Great nothing.

34
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,933
You'll live to regreat it ,you'll never get out.

35
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,600
 Are flies always that bad?

36
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,649
 Bad? this is their off season 

37
00:05:07,692 --> 00:05:09,500
What happened to the screens?

38
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,600
Oh they rotted away

39
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,200
I've never seen ...

40
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:19,204
Why do you know about the screens?

41
00:05:20,308 --> 00:05:22,000
I know quite a lot about this house.

42
00:05:22,198 --> 00:05:25,000
 even about you.
- You do?

43
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,300
 I've heard stories about this 
house for many years.

44
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,640
 My father built it.

45
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,110
Your father?
Alan Quatermain?

46
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,210
 I'm Harry Quatermain.

47
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:41,370
Harry Quatermain? 
Why did you not tell me?

48
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,000
 your father took on my first
 safari when I was just a kid.

49
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
- I know.
- Harry Quatermain!

50
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,350
  Jim-Jim!

51
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,200
 Yes, bwana, two more beers.
coming.

52
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,100
Oh, never mind about that, come on out!

53
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,690
He started me in the hunting business.
he used to give those safaries he didn't want 

54
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,170
- Yes, I know.
- Yes, bwana?

55
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:02,120
- Jim-Jim , what do you think?
this is nakuma's own son .

56
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,250
Happy, happy day , bwana.
you're father was the greatest

57
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:09,520
  most loved.
- I know, Jim-Jim... thank you.

58
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,400
 It's nice to know my father is so well remembered
after so many years

59
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,150
Remembered?
he's a legend in these parts!

60
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,250
The greates white hunter forever.

61
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,700
  Yeah, where are your things? you'll move in here. 
- Well but...

62
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,400
Oh no "but" for pete sake!
this is almost your own home.

63
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,750
- I'll get your bearers , bwana..
- I dont have any, Jim-Jim.

64
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,670
- I came alone.
- Alone?

65
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,900
- from Zanzibar?
- Yes, it is faster that way  .

66
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,000
I was in a hurry to get here.

67
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,570
So you've arrived.

69
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,630
 Anything else, bwana?

70
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,930
 No, nothing, thank you.

71
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,600
 What's the matter, Ompa?

72
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,690
Nothing, bwana.

73
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,580
- Hi, Harry
- Morning, Rick.

74
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,600
- Breakfast?
- Just some cofee, thank you.

75
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,150
- Any luck?
- Eh ,yes and no.

76
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,590
 Kanda is dead. he died a few years ago.

77
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,500
He didn't have any relatives,so...

78
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,300
Well at least you know it.

79
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,200
You've been jumping as scorpion
ever since you got here.

80
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,000
What now?

81
00:08:52,247 --> 00:08:55,897
-I would like to try something else.
- Good ! do you want a safari?

82
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:58,712
 Maybe, but I could'nt afford much one

83
00:08:58,817 --> 00:09:01,736
 Afford nothing!
  my pleasure!.

84
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:06,221
 Might not want this, Rick.
may take 4 or 5 months.

85
00:09:06,638 --> 00:09:08,724
4 or 5 months?

86
00:09:08,933 --> 00:09:12,800
Yes, I'm going north to the Kalaoyana country.

87
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,400
 Do you wanna die young?

88
00:09:16,754 --> 00:09:18,500
Will you come along?

89
00:09:20,091 --> 00:09:23,000
 You wanna try for king solomon's mines

90
00:09:23,324 --> 00:09:24,889
Yes.

91
00:09:27,183 --> 00:09:29,686
 I thought it'd be something like that.

92
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,127
-Why?
-You're Alan's son 

93
00:09:33,336 --> 00:09:35,525
  You're all tied up inside.
  
94
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:38,238
 You spent 3 sweating weeks
 trying to track down Kanda

95
00:09:38,342 --> 00:09:40,845
... by finding him buried ahead

96
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,076
They didn't bring back any diamonds.

97
00:09:44,181 --> 00:09:46,893
There's no prove for the story.

98
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:50,400
 My father wouldn't lie ,
neither would my mother.

99
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,880
 you'll have half of the diamonds
 if we make it .

100
00:09:53,984 --> 00:09:58,573
Your life should be worth more than
a half of some possible diamonds

101
00:09:58,573 --> 00:10:02,328
Me sure I got nothing to lose,
and many to gain.

102
00:10:03,683 --> 00:10:05,664
 You're worst than your father.

103
00:10:05,768 --> 00:10:08,063
he pushed his luck and  africa got him...

104
00:10:08,168 --> 00:10:10,045
... even him.

105
00:10:10,775 --> 00:10:12,500
Yes, I know.

106
00:10:13,485 --> 00:10:17,344
 but I think he was lucky 
 he died doing what he wanted .

107
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:19,534
seen everything, done everything...

108
00:10:19,638 --> 00:10:22,767
... his time had come is such simple.

109
00:10:23,184 --> 00:10:25,600
He is still buried ,somewhere out there.

110
00:10:27,564 --> 00:10:29,337
 I'ts as good a place as any

111
00:10:29,442 --> 00:10:32,400
The last place I'm gonna be buried is in africa.

112
00:10:33,821 --> 00:10:35,700
I dont think you have a choice.

113
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:39,558
is in the cards or is not.

114
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:44,146
I'm going to find the mines.

115
00:10:44,772 --> 00:10:46,232
 Why?

116
00:10:46,544 --> 00:10:50,299
 Diamonds.money is the only thing that
counts in our days

117
00:10:50,508 --> 00:10:52,385
 Do you think so?

118
00:10:52,489 --> 00:10:54,679
There's no much left 
of the world I knew.

119
00:10:54,783 --> 00:10:56,700
so I'm gonna try for something different.

120
00:10:57,287 --> 00:10:59,580
If I fail...

121
00:11:00,623 --> 00:11:04,273
but If I find them,
I'm gonna contruct my own  world.

122
00:11:04,378 --> 00:11:07,715
-You're nice and cinical , aren't you ?
-Well ,aren't you?

123
00:11:09,595 --> 00:11:11,573
You know ,you've never been 
 on safari before.

124
00:11:11,678 --> 00:11:14,494
True, but I know every end of the way 
of my father...

125
00:11:14,598 --> 00:11:15,862
... every foot of it.

126
00:11:15,862 --> 00:11:18,500
 Second hand knowledge
 won't keep you alive.

127
00:11:20,438 --> 00:11:22,245
You've ever seen one of this?

128
00:11:24,193 --> 00:11:25,131
 No.

129
00:11:25,235 --> 00:11:28,154
Umbopa, king of the Watusi
who guards the mines...

130
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:30,866
... gave it to my father.
if we make get into their country...

131
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:34,100
- ... we're home free.
- Yeah... if...

132
00:11:35,038 --> 00:11:37,749
I've never been in or near of that country

133
00:11:37,854 --> 00:11:40,300
... no one has  ,except your father.

134
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,528
You know we'll have maybe
one chance in ten of getting there

135
00:11:44,631 --> 00:11:47,500
- ... let alone getting back.
- Probably one in fifty.

136
00:11:48,178 --> 00:11:50,263
The whole idea is crazy.

137
00:11:52,454 --> 00:11:54,000
Jim-Jim !

138
00:11:54,331 --> 00:11:55,680
 Yes, bwana.

139
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:59,440
I told you a million times.
to keep that thing out of here 

140
00:11:59,545 --> 00:12:02,465
-Well, take it outside!
-Yes, bwana.

141
00:12:09,974 --> 00:12:11,851
stinking country

142
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:14,600
 I've tried house snakes to keep the others away.

143
00:12:15,814 --> 00:12:17,500
All right, so I don't like snakes!

144
00:12:19,464 --> 00:12:23,218
Well, sure I got nothing to lose.
except my life.

145
00:12:23,322 --> 00:12:26,000
no family, nothing, sure I'll come

146
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:29,163
I was really hoping you'd ask me

147
00:12:29,267 --> 00:12:30,600
Why?

148
00:12:31,457 --> 00:12:33,200
Possibly the diamonds.

149
00:12:40,008 --> 00:12:42,928
- Here, you'd like to use this?
- No, thank you...

150
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:45,326
... I'll just use my own rifle.

151
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,200
an army rifle?
you're married to that?

152
00:12:48,872 --> 00:12:50,542
 Sort of.

153
00:12:53,044 --> 00:12:55,859
Captain H. Quatermain.
K.O.S.B.

154
00:12:55,963 --> 00:12:57,850
King's own scottish borderers

155
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,200
Oh... a Kilt and all that?

156
00:13:00,553 --> 00:13:02,500
Yes, I've got very pretty knees

157
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,000
 I didn't know officer carried rifles

158
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,200
 They don't ,actually
but I found it much more useful...

159
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,140
...especially with the bayonet.

160
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,000
Hi, glad you could come over

161
00:13:12,337 --> 00:13:14,632
I want to introduce you to
a friend of mine ,Harry 

162
00:13:14,735 --> 00:13:16,821 
He's been around  this country
for years.

163
00:13:16,925 --> 00:13:19,011
 Might be useful to have another
gun along

164
00:13:19,011 --> 00:13:21,097
he is lousy shot.

165
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:22,974
Harry Quatermein.

166
00:13:23,078 --> 00:13:24,880
Wilhelm von Kintner.

167
00:13:27,354 --> 00:13:30,500
 If mr. Cobb had told me ,
I could have saved you a journey.

168
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,880
We don't need another gun, sorry.

169
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,200
 That's a Lee Enfield I see
is it yours?

170
00:13:45,814 --> 00:13:47,165
Yes.

170
00:13:48,524 --> 00:13:51,548
 Good luck, Rick and safe journey

171
00:13:51,652 --> 00:13:54,156
Thanks for coming over.

172
00:14:03,228 --> 00:14:05,836
You know, Harry, we could have used
another gun.

174
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,860
Maybe, but we'll handle it ourselves.

174
00:14:08,965 --> 00:14:12,093
What's the matter with you?
you're still fighting the war?

175
00:14:12,197 --> 00:14:14,400
No, four years was quite enough

176
00:14:14,805 --> 00:14:16,650
It is just personal.

177
00:14:17,412 --> 00:14:19,914
my mother and sister were drowned
in 1916...

178
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:21,897
... an U.boat got their ship

179
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:24,295
A lot of people died unnecessarily.

180
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,779
That's right. but in this case
I had to identify their bodies.

181
00:14:28,883 --> 00:14:31,804
My sister was still in her mother's arms
she was 8.

182
00:14:31,907 --> 00:14:35,036
just a child,she had no legs 

184
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:38,060
no legs, just stumps

185
00:14:38,269 --> 00:14:42,232
my mother had her child ...
half a child in her arms.

186
00:14:43,171 --> 00:14:45,360
I know he had nothing to do with it...

187
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,000
... but I just don't want 
anyone of them around me ,that's all

188
00:16:14,717 --> 00:16:16,200
- Jim-Jim !

189
00:16:22,954 --> 00:16:25,873
You lead, Harry.
I'll take the wagon.

190
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:15,299
 Harry...

191
00:17:15,403 --> 00:17:18,000
- Whats the matter, Rick?
- My feet.

192
00:17:18,531 --> 00:17:20,512
Do you want some help?

193
00:17:21,451 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm sure better at desk job.
never did like walking.

194
00:17:29,792 --> 00:17:31,156
Strange...

195
00:17:32,191 --> 00:17:35,200
hynas always hunt in packs never alone.

196
00:18:03,472 --> 00:18:06,809
 Kalaoyana atacked the white God.

197
00:18:06,913 --> 00:18:08,685
White God?

198
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:12,752
-Is there any mission settlement around here somewhere?
-Yes , there is.

199
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,797
we'd better bury them.

200
00:19:54,938 --> 00:19:57,650
 You didn't find a body of a woman
 by any chance , did you?

201
00:19:57,753 --> 00:19:59,009
 No...

202
00:19:59,318 --> 00:20:02,000
... only eight natives and the missionary.

203
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,200
That leaves only one posibility.
I'll take Jim-Jim ...

204
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,622
Oh, no you don't ,  Jim-Jim!
 
205
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:12,978
Yes, bwana.

206
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:15,584
If we're not back for sundown,
come and find us.

207
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,900
Come on.

208
00:21:03,445 --> 00:21:06,500
-She wasn't as lucky as the others.
-What do you mean?

209
00:21:06,885 --> 00:21:09,388
Kalaoyana like to torture women.

210
00:21:51,201 --> 00:21:53,495
- Cover me.
- All right.

211
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:19,771
Come on!

212
00:23:51,427 --> 00:23:53,500
We'll never be able to hold this bridge.

213
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,806
or leave trying to make a run forth


214
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,474
There's only a vill up ahead.

215
00:23:57,579 --> 00:24:00,081
We'll have to risk it
We can never hold them here.

216
00:24:00,081 --> 00:24:02,792
All right, but leave the wagon,
We don't have too much time.

217
00:24:02,896 --> 00:24:05,085
-Let's just take what we need.
- All right.

218
00:24:10,508 --> 00:24:12,698
 I'm Rick Cobb,are you all right?

219
00:24:12,802 --> 00:24:15,000
I think so.
but they'll come back?

220
00:24:15,617 --> 00:24:17,703
Yes , I'm afraid so.

221
00:24:17,912 --> 00:24:19,892
I'm Erica Neuler

222
00:24:19,997 --> 00:24:23,334
I do not know how..
I don't know how to thank you.

223
00:24:23,437 --> 00:24:25,211
Well, thank Him.

224
00:24:26,044 --> 00:24:27,817
too bad about the missionary.

225
00:24:27,921 --> 00:24:30,528
I know.. he was my father.

226
00:24:30,633 --> 00:24:32,926
- I'm sorry.
- We're all ready , Rick.

227
00:24:33,135 --> 00:24:35,220
-Think you can go on?
-I will try.

228
00:24:35,325 --> 00:24:38,557
"ich muss Ihnen danken"
I mean, I'm very grateful.

229
00:24:38,662 --> 00:24:40,955
Erica Neuler
this is Harry Quatermein.

230
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,040
Thank you for saving my life.

231
00:24:43,145 --> 00:24:45,647
We haven't done that yet
you're german 

232
00:24:45,752 --> 00:24:47,052
Yes

233
00:24:52,113 --> 00:24:53,990
Won't be long now.

234
00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:57,221
Better get some clothes together
be prepare to travel light

235
00:24:57,326 --> 00:25:01,601
- Where will you take me?
- Never mind ,no questions just keep going

236
00:25:06,815 --> 00:25:08,900
We'll have to fire that bridge.

237
00:25:10,569 --> 00:25:13,384
Fire is a pretty dangerous thing
to play around with in this country.

238
00:25:13,488 --> 00:25:16,512
Well, I'll set the rods
we'll just have to risk it.

239
00:25:16,512 --> 00:25:18,000
All right.

240
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:19,600
- you think is safe to camp now?
- Yes, I think so.

241
00:26:23,246 --> 00:26:24,923
What's that?

242
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:30,857
The river must have carried
the fire down stream.

243
00:26:30,962 --> 00:26:33,300
We're lucky the wind is blowing
away from us.

244
00:26:45,768 --> 00:26:47,700
We're right in their path

245
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:50,375
quick, behind these rocks!

245
00:28:02,825 --> 00:28:04,181
Come back here!

245
00:28:04,285 --> 00:28:06,892
Get down , down! Come back

246
00:28:07,518 --> 00:28:08,665
Come back!

247
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:06,848
Get down, get down!

248
00:29:23,427 --> 00:29:26,242
we did keep off the vultures this time... just.

249
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,328
Yes, the Gods are with us.

250
00:29:28,432 --> 00:29:31,247
- Long way to get through yet
-Long ? why? where are we heading?

251
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:32,707
North.

252
00:29:33,541 --> 00:29:35,500
Where are you going to leave me off?

253
00:29:35,939 --> 00:29:37,921
You can't expect us to turn back now

254
00:29:37,921 --> 00:29:40,100
We'll leave you off at the end of our safari.

255
00:29:43,238 --> 00:29:46,054
It is not usual to find
europeans in this area

256
00:29:46,158 --> 00:29:48,348
- You've been here long?
- Many years.

257
00:29:48,452 --> 00:29:51,789
even during the war
we saw few europeans.

258
00:29:51,893 --> 00:29:54,083
I was lucky you came by.
almost a miracle

259
00:29:59,192 --> 00:30:01,195
Go easy with the water!

260
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,970
This isn't berlin.

261
00:30:06,074 --> 00:30:08,750
We may not find drinkable water for days.

262
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:12,307
I'm sorry, I should have known better.

263
00:30:13,164 --> 00:30:14,800
Yes, you should have.

264
00:30:18,587 --> 00:30:21,350
What have I done to him by
he should be like this to me ?

265
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:23,496
What have I done?

266
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,928
Maybe he just dislikes germans

267
00:30:59,914 --> 00:31:01,600
 it's looks like a good place, Rick.

268
00:31:02,936 --> 00:31:04,082
Yes.

269
00:31:04,602 --> 00:31:06,479
We'll camp here, Jim-Jim.

270
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,938
Yes, bwana.

271
00:31:18,046 --> 00:31:20,560
Do you know how far is it to Zampari?

272
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,674
About half day march , I'd say.

273
00:31:23,778 --> 00:31:27,113
but we're lucky. I know there's
elephants spot about a mile back .

274
00:31:27,322 --> 00:31:30,031
- You're looking for ivory?
- No, no

275
00:31:30,448 --> 00:31:33,550
but the elephant meat is a delicacy
to the Zampari.

276
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:36,076
if we bring them meat they ferry us
across the river

277
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:39,514
is the only way we can get across
- Oh, I see.

278
00:31:40,661 --> 00:31:42,849
Does the "haupman" permit me to bathe?

279
00:31:42,953 --> 00:31:45,038
 I was a captain.

280
00:31:45,142 --> 00:31:48,269
Captain , "haupman" it is all the same.

281
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:50,100
Never was to me.

282
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:54,833
Nontheless, I wouldn't bathe
in the river if I were you

283
00:31:58,376 --> 00:32:01,712
You are afraid I may poison the crocodiles?.

284
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,359
Oh, do you consider dirtiness a merit
with us germans?

285
00:32:05,568 --> 00:32:08,277
I didn't say that
you did!

286
00:32:20,678 --> 00:32:24,013
Look, Erica, why don't you
stop picking on him?

287
00:32:24,222 --> 00:32:26,410
Then tell him to stop
picking on me!

288
00:32:26,515 --> 00:32:29,200
I am a human, I exist ,I am here...

289
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,000
... it is not my fault.
and not asked to be rescued.

290
00:32:34,226 --> 00:32:37,786
maybe I do not like him as much 
as he dislikes germans .

291
00:32:38,603 --> 00:32:41,209
I am not ashame of being german.

292
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,700
my father told me to be proud.

293
00:32:44,439 --> 00:32:46,315
Why don't you forget it?

294
00:32:46,419 --> 00:32:48,338
you're the only one 
that keep bringing it up

295
00:32:50,379 --> 00:32:52,673
I know ,I'm sorry.

296
00:32:52,776 --> 00:32:54,569
you've been so kind.

297
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:57,987
I will try.
it is going to be dificult...

298
00:32:58,195 --> 00:33:00,905
... because he is such a ...

299
00:33:01,113 --> 00:33:03,113
... "dickkopf".

300
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,157
- How are your feet?
- Few blisters not too bad.

301
00:33:07,158 --> 00:33:08,304
- Good.

302
00:33:08,408 --> 00:33:11,013
-Rick, are you coming?
-Yeah, I'm coming.

303
00:33:11,744 --> 00:33:13,827
You do like him, don't you?

304
00:33:13,931 --> 00:33:16,600
Sure, he's my friend.

305
00:34:38,656 --> 00:34:40,429
-Jim-Jim
-Yes, bwana.

306
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:42,930
- Get some of the boys 
and bury the tasks.

307
00:34:43,034 --> 00:34:44,910
we'll pick them up on our way back.

308
00:34:45,013 --> 00:34:46,994
We're going to get back?

309
00:34:47,098 --> 00:34:49,100
Do I ever say different?

310
00:34:50,954 --> 00:34:52,621
Mamba.

311
00:34:54,289 --> 00:34:56,581
Second hand knowledge ,eh?

312
00:34:56,685 --> 00:34:58,978
Say, you are a genius.

313
00:35:15,131 --> 00:35:17,249
- Did you have good hunting?
- Yes.

314
00:35:18,258 --> 00:35:22,218
You look good.
I mean clean , rested.

315
00:35:22,322 --> 00:35:25,032
- Thank you.
- I'd use a bath myself.

316
00:35:25,033 --> 00:35:27,428
- I organized the food I hope is all right.

317
00:35:27,428 --> 00:35:30,000
- I baked some bread.
- Bread? here?

318
00:35:32,222 --> 00:35:34,515
All you need is flour and water.

319
00:35:34,723 --> 00:35:37,433
It's easy to make an oven
out of clay.

320
00:35:39,204 --> 00:35:42,018
I smelled something good

321
00:35:44,415 --> 00:35:47,333
Do you know why the Kalaoyana
atacked your mission?

322
00:35:47,438 --> 00:35:51,626
There's been much trouble with the change
 from a german east africa to a british  protectorade

323
00:35:52,752 --> 00:35:55,358
Many of the native tribes
didn't like the war years.

324
00:35:55,462 --> 00:35:57,462
It wasn't only the natives.

325
00:35:58,901 --> 00:36:02,653
We happened to be germans 
who've blamed

326
00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:04,945
sometime innocent people suffer.

327
00:36:05,049 --> 00:36:06,421
Yes.

328
00:36:07,238 --> 00:36:09,350
Are you sure there is nowhere
I can be left?

329
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,465
You know there isn't.

330
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:14,244 
you're quite safe with us
don't worry.

331
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,902
But I do. 

332
00:36:15,927 --> 00:36:17,450
 for the first time I have the chance
to live my own life

333
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:21,250
... and do not intend to throw it
way just because you want to go north.

334
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:24,220
You have no alternative , have you?

335
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:16,950
You know my idea of heaven would be 
reunite all the mosquitoes in the world...

336
00:37:17,061 --> 00:37:19,666
and burn them to death , slowly

337
00:37:19,978 --> 00:37:23,313
  real slow.
- are the flies that make me ill.

338
00:37:23,522 --> 00:37:26,648
getting in your hair ,in your eyes,
in your food!

339
00:37:26,857 --> 00:37:28,732
Hey, you better take this .

340
00:37:28,837 --> 00:37:31,754
- Dr quartermain, I presume.
- Someone has got to look after you.

341
00:37:31,858 --> 00:37:34,464
I'm fed up with quinine.

342
00:37:34,569 --> 00:37:37,450
- How about yourself?
- I already had mine.

343
00:37:38,529 --> 00:37:40,760
My idea of heaven would be ...

344
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:44,156
... a constant hot water 
 flowing from silver taps

345
00:37:44,363 --> 00:37:47,710
where is always clean
and green...

346
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:50,305
...where the rain falls gently...

347
00:37:50,409 --> 00:37:54,786
...and where you can go out in the sun 
without hat on and not be afraid

348
00:37:54,993 --> 00:37:57,807
you know , I left the old country.
seeking for a good climate.

349
00:37:57,912 --> 00:38:00,205
I figured africa was the place

350
00:38:00,308 --> 00:38:03,435
with the time I found out it was too hot 
whatever, I was stuck with it.

352
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:07,707
funny...we always wanna be 
somewhere we are not.

353
00:38:07,812 --> 00:38:10,313
Anything would be better than this.

354
00:38:10,417 --> 00:38:13,335
You know i've never had a pretty dress
never in my whole life...

355
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,399
... no silk stockins.I've never been to the ballet 
or theater

356
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:20,422
I've never read today's paper of today

357
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:24,278
-I'm sure you'd get bore with it.
-No, I wouldn't.

358
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:27,613
What's your idea of 
heaven?

359
00:38:27,717 --> 00:38:30,321
This, without flies and mosquitoes.

360
00:38:30,426 --> 00:38:32,927
- You'd get bore with that too.

361
00:38:33,136 --> 00:38:35,500
- What are you looking for north?

362
00:38:36,992 --> 00:38:39,400
We're going to king solomon's mines.


363
00:38:40,535 --> 00:38:45,016
You are gone through all of this to find
the will o the wisp?

364
00:38:45,224 --> 00:38:47,934
king solomon's mines?

365
00:38:47,934 --> 00:38:53,000
 "komisch ,sehr komisch !"
  
366
00:38:53,457 --> 00:38:56,062
It's funny,very funny.

367
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,668
Do you know how ironic it is?

368
00:38:58,773 --> 00:39:00,136
Why?

369
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:03,254
A fitting end to everything

370
00:39:03,357 --> 00:39:05,500
A trip off to nothing!

370
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,946
Maybe it's kind of crazy.

371
00:39:13,049 --> 00:39:15,000
Not if we got there.

372
00:39:16,176 --> 00:39:19,511
- She's a fine girl, isn't she?
- Yes.

373
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:24,095
Have you been married, Rick?

374
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,389
No, and you?

375
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,465
No.

376
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,700
I can't stand much more of this.

377
00:40:20,575 --> 00:40:22,155
neither can I.

378
00:40:22,459 --> 00:40:25,000
- You're doing fine, Erica.
- How much more?

379
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:27,586
Another five or six days.

380
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:30,830
- We'll make it all right.
- If the fever doesn't get us.

381
00:40:30,935 --> 00:40:32,535
Keep going.

382
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,000
Harry , harry

383
00:40:59,598 --> 00:41:02,150
- Harry !
- Fever !

384
00:41:02,829 --> 00:41:04,300
Get the quinine, Jim-Jim.

383
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,100
There's none bwana it was lost
in the stampede

384
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,035
all except for one small bottle

385
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,542
that nakuma's son bwana took 

386
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,000
what?

387
00:41:12,315 --> 00:41:15,442
the crazy it has been giving it all to us !

388
00:41:17,109 --> 00:41:19,109
We better go to the falls.

389
00:41:19,506 --> 00:41:22,000
Cannot be more than a 
half day ahead.

390
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,000
There ,give me a hand.

391
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:55,200
-Hello, Rick.
-No quinine , nothing

392
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:57,969
If we don't break his fever,
I think he will die.

393
00:41:57,974 --> 00:41:59,743
How do you know? you're a nurse?

394
00:41:59,846 --> 00:42:03,200
I ran the mission hospital.
my father told me about it.

395
00:42:03,912 --> 00:42:08,290
I wonder..?
perhaps we can find  mimtoyali.

396
00:42:22,152 --> 00:42:24,100
- Any good?
- No.

397
00:42:27,886 --> 00:42:29,650
Maybe there aren't
in this part of the country

398
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:31,638
There must be!

399
00:42:32,576 --> 00:42:34,576
Give me a hand Rick ,please

400
00:42:38,518 --> 00:42:40,300
We got them, Rick!

401
00:43:08,851 --> 00:43:10,300
Raise his head.

402
00:43:28,864 --> 00:43:30,264
Thank you.

403
00:43:31,991 --> 00:43:34,200
Well , if that doesn't kill him,
nothing will.

404
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,500
Sometimes , this natives
remedies are good .

405
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:40,121
-It should break his fever tonight
- I hope so.

406
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:59,301
Jim-Jim

407
00:44:20,878 --> 00:44:24,214
It's a  Watusi, It must be.

408
00:44:24,943 --> 00:44:26,943
Just like Harry described it.

409
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:48,917
I cannot undestand him.

410
00:44:48,917 --> 00:44:52,357
it's Bengkala. he says his name is
Amtagka has come to guide us.

411
00:44:52,566 --> 00:44:55,693
- He want to see harry.
- Harry, why?

412
00:45:05,178 --> 00:45:08,305
He told me politely,
to mind my own business.

413
00:45:24,253 --> 00:45:26,855
- He is asking if he will live.
- Yes.

414
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:37,075
He said , he will wait.

415
00:45:37,075 --> 00:45:39,250
How could he possibly know 
about Harry?

416
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:43,650
I dont know, strange things
happen in africa..

417
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:45,540
There's not much a white man can do 

418
00:45:45,565 --> 00:45:47,700
without words passing from drum to drum

419
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:51,600
Do you really believe 
solomon's mines exist?

420
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:56,358
Sure. his father got there  
and lived to get back.

421
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:05,250
If he dies what will you do?

422
00:46:07,407 --> 00:46:09,701
I'd like to go on.

423
00:46:10,533 --> 00:46:12,300
Would you come?

424
00:46:12,723 --> 00:46:14,700
I would have no alternative

424
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:18,500
I like have you around, Erica.

425
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,600
Thank you

426
00:46:31,174 --> 00:46:32,800
 How do you feel?

427
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,030
Much better, thank you.

428
00:46:35,133 --> 00:46:38,053
-I'll tell rick you're awake.
-No, no,don't.

429
00:46:38,574 --> 00:46:40,867
I'd like to sleep a bit more.

430
00:46:45,766 --> 00:46:48,268
- Good night, then.
- Good night.

431
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:15,700
No, she's not my wife.

432
00:48:10,302 --> 00:48:13,221
I'm sorry I didn't know you were taking....

433
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,200
I can't hear you.

434
00:48:21,768 --> 00:48:25,104
I want to talk to you ...
down there.. all right?

435
00:48:38,654 --> 00:48:41,630
-Is anything the matter?
-No, Erica.

436
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:45,221
- I'm sorry I interrupted you
- I thought something was wrong

438
00:48:45,325 --> 00:48:47,723
I didn't even take time to dry myself.

439
00:48:47,827 --> 00:48:49,340
What did the watusi say?

440
00:48:49,912 --> 00:48:53,665
only that he's been sent to guide us .
that we'd be welcomed

441
00:48:53,768 --> 00:48:57,521
- Will it take long?
- No , it won't take long.

442
00:48:58,876 --> 00:49:02,212
By the way, Rick told me...
how you broke my fever.

443
00:49:02,316 --> 00:49:03,850
I wanna thank you.

444
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:06,485
We have quite a time with you

445
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:08,987
My mother died of the same swamp fever.

446
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:12,739
We didn't know about Mimtoyali then
we had just arrived to África.

447
00:49:12,947 --> 00:49:15,867
Sorry... sorry about 
your father.

448
00:49:16,596 --> 00:49:19,100
He was living on borrowed time

449
00:49:19,306 --> 00:49:23,058
so many years in the 
jungle all alone so far away

450
00:49:23,267 --> 00:49:27,020
he knew it would come one day.
but he stayed.

451
00:49:27,123 --> 00:49:30,460
it was quick when it came
so I think is all right.

452
00:49:30,564 --> 00:49:33,000
I didn't think I was going to be as lucky

453
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:36,000
...for that I thank you

454
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,000
Were you born in germany?

454
00:49:39,424 --> 00:49:42,343
Yes , we lived in Freiburg.

455
00:49:43,072 --> 00:49:47,033
I can just remember the little church
at the edge of the green forest.

456
00:49:47,554 --> 00:49:49,640
all the cattle wore bells...

457
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:52,766
... and at sundown
we could hear them over the whole valley.

458
00:49:52,871 --> 00:49:54,600
I'ts was beautiful.

459
00:49:55,998 --> 00:49:59,125
-Was your father sent here?
- No, he asked to come.

460
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:01,230
my mother beg him against it

461
00:50:02,251 --> 00:50:04,100
she wasted so quickly.

462
00:50:05,274 --> 00:50:08,300
and since I was eight ,
I was mother to the mission .

463
00:50:09,235 --> 00:50:12,500
my mother also died
in Africa, when I was born.

464
00:50:13,197 --> 00:50:16,323
when my father died ,
my step mother took me to canada.

465
00:50:16,427 --> 00:50:18,700
I always remember my step mother.

466
00:50:19,971 --> 00:50:23,590
She is dead also?

467
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:27,990
Yes ,she and my sister were drowned
in 1916.

468
00:50:29,249 --> 00:50:32,627
their ship was torpedoed
by an U.boat.

469
00:50:34,773 --> 00:50:36,754
Oh... I see.

470
00:50:37,484 --> 00:50:39,360
I'm sorry.

471
00:50:41,132 --> 00:50:43,425
 I wanna thank you for saving my life

472
00:50:43,528 --> 00:50:45,544
I would do the same 
for anyone...

473
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:50,000
... black, white, german or english.

474
00:51:07,817 --> 00:51:09,518
What did he say, Rick?

475
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:12,716
 It's a watusi proberb:

476
00:51:12,924 --> 00:51:16,259
"two virgin and one man  
is only good.

477
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:19,624
but two men and one ,
will destroy all three.

478
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:22,930
He is very wise.

479
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,504
We should have caught up with amtagka 
hours ago.

480
00:51:40,607 --> 00:51:43,650
- I hope nothing has happened to him.
- No, he's too clever for that.

481
00:51:46,344 --> 00:51:47,908
Jim-Jim !

485
00:51:51,872 --> 00:51:55,523
- What's the matter with those bearers? 
- Tabu land , they're afraid , bwana.

484
00:51:55,626 --> 00:51:58,964
Tell them we are well armed 
there's nothing to fear and keep them quite.

485
00:52:25,872 --> 00:52:27,750
Better not shoot yet.

486
00:52:27,854 --> 00:52:30,148
the sound will carry 20 miles.

487
00:53:02,898 --> 00:53:05,401
We're lucky they're half blind
and almost deaf.

488
00:53:05,505 --> 00:53:08,200
Yes , but we better get out 
before he sense us .

489
00:54:14,757 --> 00:54:17,365
I waited as long as I could .
but he wouldn't go away

490
00:54:17,469 --> 00:54:19,556
As long as you're all right.

491
00:54:20,389 --> 00:54:21,600
Bwana!

492
00:54:24,144 --> 00:54:26,751
- The boys, bwana... they're gone.
- What?

493
00:54:31,966 --> 00:54:35,096
- He said he saw the bearer deserting .
Why don't you stop them?

494
00:54:43,648 --> 00:54:47,298
- He says the bearer were afraid of going 
to the land of the little people ,the pygmies

495
00:54:47,298 --> 00:54:48,341
Why?

497
00:54:48,341 --> 00:54:50,531
Pygmies are too small to hunt games 
with weapons..

498
00:54:50,531 --> 00:54:52,150
... so they build  traps.

500
00:54:52,617 --> 00:54:55,300
from now on it'd be like going thrugh a minefield

501
00:54:55,746 --> 00:54:58,300
I will check our suplies come on , Jim-Jim.

502
00:54:59,188 --> 00:55:01,000
 I'll give you a hand , Rick.

503
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:19,850
Harry,for God sake, stop,help! 
No, Harry...

504
00:55:20,256 --> 00:55:22,028
Let me go!

505
00:55:22,446 --> 00:55:24,011
Look!

506
00:55:29,643 --> 00:55:30,894
Harry...

507
00:55:30,998 --> 00:55:33,189
... Oh I'm so sorry, Harry.
but I thought that you...

508
00:55:33,293 --> 00:55:35,275
That's the trouble ,
you're always got the wrong thought

509
00:55:35,379 --> 00:55:36,735
- It was just that I...

510
00:55:36,839 --> 00:55:40,802
- We got a mad woman in our hands, Rick.
- I'll have to watch out myself.

511
00:55:44,139 --> 00:55:46,017
- Good night.
- Good night.

512
00:55:46,226 --> 00:55:47,577
- Good night.

513
00:55:59,262 --> 00:56:02,600
-  Oh ... it smells good!
-  breakfast is nearly ready.

514
00:56:02,808 --> 00:56:05,937
- I'm so hungry I could eat 
an elephant raw

515
00:56:06,668 --> 00:56:08,544 
Where did you get the eggs?

516
00:56:08,649 --> 00:56:11,300
One thing about the army
they teach you to survive.

517
00:56:23,355 --> 00:56:25,023
There you are.

518
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:27,944
-  Rick...
- Yes

519
00:56:28,569 --> 00:56:30,143
Wake up

519
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:39,216
What's the matter?

520
00:56:39,625 --> 00:56:42,232
 I'm afraid this one is a bit too ripe.

521
00:56:59,024 --> 00:57:00,824
- An egg is an egg.

522
00:57:05,803 --> 00:57:10,601
I'm sorry about yesterday
about weeping and all.

523
00:57:11,644 --> 00:57:14,982
Oh, you can use my shoulder .
anytime you like...

524
00:57:17,485 --> 00:57:19,300
... or maybe harry's.

525
00:57:21,761 --> 00:57:23,639
How about some breakfast?

526
00:57:24,264 --> 00:57:25,724
Thanks.

527
00:57:26,141 --> 00:57:29,062
 Amtagka says we'll get to the
desert in a few days...

528
00:57:29,166 --> 00:57:31,043
... after that watusi country...

529
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:33,024
... and the diamonds!

530
00:57:35,007 --> 00:57:37,718
How about split it in three ways, Rick?

531
00:57:37,823 --> 00:57:39,500
It's all right with me.

532
00:57:41,369 --> 00:57:43,350
This is very kind of you , but..

533
00:57:43,559 --> 00:57:47,300
- You've earned this share.
- You do not owe me anything.

534
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:50,400
Only my life.

535
00:58:15,891 --> 00:58:17,872
Look out, bwana!

536
00:58:22,774 --> 00:58:24,651
It broke his neck..

537
00:58:24,756 --> 00:58:27,155
Yeah, that would've been mine.

538
00:58:27,467 --> 00:58:29,477
Is there anything we can do?

539
00:58:31,326 --> 00:58:34,038
Yes... bury him.

540
00:59:05,432 --> 00:59:07,621
This damn thing never keeps it's edge.

541
00:59:07,726 --> 00:59:09,708
How do you keep that thing sharp?

542
00:59:10,541 --> 00:59:12,315
Melissa?

543
00:59:12,836 --> 00:59:14,714
 I work out it .

544
00:59:14,922 --> 00:59:16,696
Melissa?

545
00:59:18,051 --> 00:59:20,137
After my sister.

546
00:59:20,658 --> 00:59:22,953
Harry, do you mind if I say something...

547
00:59:23,058 --> 00:59:26,395
- ... just as a friend?
- No, go ahead.

548
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:30,566
you know, you'll never be whole,never be content..

549
00:59:30,671 --> 00:59:32,700
... while you force it all to remember.

550
00:59:33,696 --> 00:59:37,033
- I don't have to force it, that's my trouble.

551
00:59:37,137 --> 00:59:40,475
- Mistakes were made on both sides 
during the war

552
00:59:40,683 --> 00:59:42,978
- That's right but that doesn't help me.

553
00:59:43,082 --> 00:59:45,898
- You know ,you'd like my people
they're...

554
00:59:46,107 --> 00:59:49,444
- They're what?
- Oh, nothing.

555
00:59:50,696 --> 00:59:55,494
If we get those diamonds,I'm going back
to the old country.

556
00:59:55,911 --> 00:59:59,248
It must be 20 years since I left home.

557
00:59:59,457 --> 01:00:01,647
I don't have a home.

558
01:00:02,273 --> 01:00:06,028
Everyone has to belong somewhere
or somebody

559
01:00:06,132 --> 01:00:08,427
... otherwise, there's no point

560
01:00:18,856 --> 01:00:20,837
Erica is all right , isn't she?

561
01:00:20,942 --> 01:00:22,715
yes, she is.

562
01:00:23,341 --> 01:00:25,300
 I'd like to marry her.

563
01:00:27,408 --> 01:00:29,494
Why don't you ask her?

564
01:00:31,059 --> 01:00:33,144
I have no courage.

565
01:00:34,396 --> 01:00:36,899
You like her too , don't you?

566
01:00:37,212 --> 01:00:38,881
Yes , I do.

567
01:00:40,028 --> 01:00:42,948
That makes it kind of rough , doesn't it?

569
01:00:43,157 --> 01:00:47,000
- No it doesn't , I couldn't marry her

568
01:01:31,446 --> 01:01:33,428
- Nothing gonna stop us now,eh Harry?

569
01:01:33,532 --> 01:01:35,618
-Only the guards.
-They are on our side.

570
01:01:35,723 --> 01:01:37,287
- Well, I hope so.

571
01:01:37,495 --> 01:01:39,790
- If they are , you'll be the richest woman 
in the world.

572
01:01:39,894 --> 01:01:42,501
- I don't know if I want to be that rich.

573
01:01:42,606 --> 01:01:46,673
- If they're not , we end up as dust in the wings 
of the wind .

574
01:01:46,882 --> 01:01:50,949
- I like the simplicity.
- I don't.

575
01:02:34,128 --> 01:02:37,466
- How beautiful!
- How wonderful beautiful!

576
01:02:37,570 --> 01:02:41,116
My father said it was a paradise ,
but  I didn't expect it .

577
01:02:46,852 --> 01:02:49,355
I wonder what we'll find down there  ...

578
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:52,171
... you, you Harry, and me 

579
01:02:52,588 --> 01:02:54,778
I wonder what we'll find ?

580
01:02:54,883 --> 01:02:57,000
Whatever we're looking for .

581
01:05:25,070 --> 01:05:27,573
He asked if we came for 
the little white stones.

582
01:05:34,769 --> 01:05:36,543
Sealed?

583
01:05:36,751 --> 01:05:39,880
The only safe way to the diamonds
is sealed forever?

586
01:05:44,052 --> 01:05:46,555
I cannot undertand him

584
01:05:49,267 --> 01:05:51,353
He said that the only passage
to the mines..

585
01:05:51,457 --> 01:05:53,577
... is through the kingdom of fire.

586
01:05:54,585 --> 01:05:56,880
The mines are tabu for 
his people, but...

587
01:05:57,089 --> 01:06:00,100
... he promises to help us .
if we still wish to go

588
01:06:01,052 --> 01:06:03,764
Yes , I want to go.

592
01:06:15,028 --> 01:06:18,574
It'd be funny if after all we've been through 
the diamonds weren't there

591
01:06:18,678 --> 01:06:21,390
They'll be there it got to be !

592
01:06:21,911 --> 01:06:24,640
- I have the feeling that it won't be
that easy

593
01:06:25,353 --> 01:06:28,691
before we go , there's something 
I wanna get settled.

594
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:30,500
You mean Erica?

595
01:06:31,402 --> 01:06:32,758
Yes.

596
01:06:44,439 --> 01:06:46,942
Umbopa's daughter 
gave me the dress.

597
01:06:47,046 --> 01:06:49,132
the women wear them 

598
01:06:49,237 --> 01:06:51,000
You look wonderful, Erica.

599
01:06:51,427 --> 01:06:53,201
You don't like it?

600
01:06:53,304 --> 01:06:55,182
I've never really seen you in 
a dress before.

601
01:06:55,286 --> 01:06:57,998
it's quite a shock,
a nicer look.

602
01:06:58,102 --> 01:07:00,000
It's nice to be a woman again

603
01:07:02,274 --> 01:07:05,299
I think I'll take a walk ,good night.

604
01:07:11,973 --> 01:07:14,268
- Look, Erica...
- Do you like some?

605
01:07:14,477 --> 01:07:15,937
Oh, no, thanks.

606
01:07:16,979 --> 01:07:19,274
perhaps by tomorrow we'll have
the diamons.

607
01:07:19,483 --> 01:07:21,594
Is that so important to you?

608
01:07:22,403 --> 01:07:24,489
Yes... and  no.

609
01:07:25,533 --> 01:07:30,330
 Look, Erica, I'm pretty beat up and I'm not as young 
as I used to be

610
01:07:30,642 --> 01:07:34,397
without the diamonds , I'll have to earn my 
keep as a hunter

611
01:07:34,606 --> 01:07:36,692
if we get the diamonds 

612
01:07:36,796 --> 01:07:39,091
... you'll be wealthy too, I thought that...

613
01:07:39,194 --> 01:07:42,845
You're not beat up, Rick!
you're a wonderful man.

614
01:07:42,949 --> 01:07:45,035
You've been so kind to me.

615
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:47,018
you both have.

616
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:50,667
What a meant was ...

617
01:07:51,502 --> 01:07:54,110
... will you marry me?

618
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:58,802
Even if we get the diamonds
we have a long way back.

619
01:07:59,011 --> 01:08:02,662
it's so dificult to think clearly.
with so much dangers around

620
01:08:02,766 --> 01:08:06,520
- Not for me it isn't
- You and  Harry...

621
01:08:06,938 --> 01:08:10,275
sometimes I don't know what I see.

622
01:08:10,796 --> 01:08:13,300
What do you mean by that, Erica?

625
01:08:13,509 --> 01:08:17,472
 All my life I've been told what to do.
 It was so easy then

625
01:08:17,576 --> 01:08:21,643
now ... I don't know how to make 
a decision.

626
01:08:37,183 --> 01:08:41,564
- It's beautiful here isn't it?
- Yes and so peaceful.

627
01:08:41,772 --> 01:08:44,380
I've never been anywhere 
quite like this 

628
01:08:44,588 --> 01:08:47,092
so calm, eternal.

629
01:08:47,196 --> 01:08:49,386
everything out seems so unimportant.

630
01:08:49,490 --> 01:08:53,454
I feel the same.
this land isn't like africa

631
01:08:56,791 --> 01:08:59,000
Rick wants to marry me.

632
01:09:00,337 --> 01:09:05,031
Rick is all right.
are you going to?

633
01:11:54,408 --> 01:11:57,371
- We have to go back.
- This heat will fry us.

634
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:02,000
We can make it across.

635
01:12:02,439 --> 01:12:04,200
Wait, I'm going first.

636
01:13:02,304 --> 01:13:06,268
- Where next?
- Wherever the tunel lead us .

637
01:13:06,372 --> 01:13:10,127
- You are all right, Erica?
- Yes... for the while that's there

638
01:13:14,403 --> 01:13:16,906
The way back will be safer...

639
01:13:17,011 --> 01:13:20,011
... we can find the cave 

640
01:14:04,466 --> 01:14:06,759
Look, we're here!

641
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:14,374
- It's unbelieveble!
- Fantastic!

642
01:14:14,374 --> 01:14:16,876
We made it! we've got it.
now we can do anything!

643
01:14:16,876 --> 01:14:19,589
- Now we got only get them out.
- We'll get them out all right , come on! 

644
01:14:19,589 --> 01:14:21,049
How much do I have to take  ?

645
01:14:21,049 --> 01:14:23,300
Two handful will be enough for all 
of your life.

646
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:25,200
and the life of your children.

647
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:29,392
This one is for a house,
and this two for some land...

648
01:14:29,601 --> 01:14:32,729
- How big is it your land?
- This one ! No, it's too small.

649
01:14:32,834 --> 01:14:35,650
- This one  have a mansion.
- I like my little house.

650
01:14:35,754 --> 01:14:38,258
-And this for all of constant hot water.

651
01:14:38,361 --> 01:14:42,116
And this for all the dresses you want to buy 
and silk stockins and hats and everything

653
01:14:42,221 --> 01:14:43,890
And this is for a car you must have a car.

654
01:14:43,994 --> 01:14:46,601
- I never drove it one.
- Oh, and a chauffer, eh, Harry?

655
01:14:46,706 --> 01:14:47,852
Right.

656
01:14:47,957 --> 01:14:50,877
This will pay his wages for the rest of his life.

657
01:14:52,546 --> 01:14:55,153
- Erika?
-It's only ...

658
01:14:55,362 --> 01:14:59,743
... you have been so kind
both of you. so very kind

659
01:14:59,846 --> 01:15:02,350
but I'm afraid we may not get out of here.

660
01:15:02,454 --> 01:15:04,749
Nonsense, we're almost home already

661
01:15:04,852 --> 01:15:08,191
another half hour and will be out
in the sun ,come on

662
01:15:20,498 --> 01:15:23,418
There should have been a stream there

663
01:15:26,651 --> 01:15:29,000
We'll have to go back for where 
we came in

664
01:15:48,761 --> 01:15:50,356
What do you think, Harry?

665
01:15:52,203 --> 01:15:54,707
You jump first, Rick,then Erica.

666
01:15:54,811 --> 01:15:56,792
you'll help her land in the other side.

667
01:15:56,897 --> 01:16:00,547
Each jump gonna make the rock shake loose   
you think it'll be safe?

668
01:16:00,652 --> 01:16:02,500
Never mind , come on!

669
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:05,200
You know, the last to jump may be 
in real trouble.

670
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:09,100
I'll worry about that.
come on, keep going!

671
01:16:09,204 --> 01:16:11,916
- You're wasting time.
- I don't think so.

672
01:16:12,124 --> 01:16:13,810
I want you to go first.

673
01:16:14,314 --> 01:16:16,504
If anyone can make it,it's me.

674
01:16:16,608 --> 01:16:18,694
my legs are lot younger than yours

675
01:16:18,799 --> 01:16:20,989
Yes, but mine have been around 
more time than yours ...

676
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,970
... I want you to be around too

677
01:16:23,075 --> 01:16:24,744
I'll be around.

678
01:16:24,753 --> 01:16:28,081
- What do you say, Erica?
- What do you mean, Rick?

679
01:16:28,290 --> 01:16:31,000
- You decide who goes first

680
01:16:32,357 --> 01:16:34,861
I don't want anything to happen to either of you.

681
01:16:34,965 --> 01:16:37,468
Then what are we gonna do ? 
We can't fight about it!

682
01:16:37,572 --> 01:16:39,449
- No, but If I had to

683
01:16:39,554 --> 01:16:41,744
... I would do get you across 

684
01:16:41,848 --> 01:16:43,517
now, come on!

685
01:16:44,352 --> 01:16:47,585
- will you please go?
- It's ever your own way? 

686
01:16:47,689 --> 01:16:49,600
You're as stubborn as your old man.

687
01:17:08,444 --> 01:17:11,155
You'll be all right ,are you ready?

688
01:17:11,155 --> 01:17:12,533
I'm afraid

689
01:17:13,971 --> 01:17:16,230
 If you make it, I'll make it.

690
01:17:16,230 --> 01:17:18,248
 I'll try.

691
01:18:10,083 --> 01:18:13,212
Thanks.
lets get out of here.

692
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:35,300
Umbopa is giving us another 20 bearers.

693
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:37,530
We'll make the coast in fine shape

694
01:18:37,530 --> 01:18:39,642
I can hardly wait to start spending.

695
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:46,000
Now that I got them ,they don't seem 
so important anymore

696
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:50,200
They will in a month or so.

697
01:18:51,055 --> 01:18:54,096
What's the matter ? 
you're all right ?

698
01:18:54,618 --> 01:18:56,550
Do you remember when we got the crest

699
01:18:56,550 --> 01:18:59,728
... Erica said 
I wonder what will find down there? 

700
01:18:59,936 --> 01:19:03,274
 well,I found something down here.
I don't want to let go off.

701
01:19:03,378 --> 01:19:05,465
this place.

702
01:19:05,673 --> 01:19:09,011
I'm not going back, Rick, I'm staying here.

703
01:19:09,219 --> 01:19:10,783
What?

704
01:19:10,888 --> 01:19:13,600
are you crazy?
what for?

705
01:19:14,129 --> 01:19:16,400
Almost everything I want is here.

706
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:19,231
I think this is the one place in the world where
I can find content , peace of mind

707
01:19:21,630 --> 01:19:24,200
- Do you think you found the paradise?
- Yes.

708
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:28,618
I'll tell you one thing for sure you're all mixed up.

709
01:19:28,722 --> 01:19:31,017
You'll never find any paradise or peace of mind 

710
01:19:31,017 --> 01:19:33,416
... while you've got that thing around..

711
01:19:35,502 --> 01:19:38,005
- Are you ready? they're waiting.

712
01:19:38,839 --> 01:19:40,613
- Oh, I'm sorry, I interrupted.

713
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:42,385
- No, no,come on in .

714
01:19:42,590 --> 01:19:44,700
perhaps you should hear this too.

715
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:50,200
 I'm going to say something that I needed to say for a long time.

716
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:53,230
I'm your friend harry , ain't I ?

717
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:55,944
- Of course.
- No wonder

718
01:19:56,670 --> 01:19:58,650
I'm as german as she is .

719
01:20:05,852 --> 01:20:08,042
- German?
- Sure

720
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:11,000
I was brought up in england but I was born in germany

721
01:20:11,692 --> 01:20:14,508
same as my folks from way back

722
01:20:15,656 --> 01:20:17,638
I wish I'd known 

723
01:20:18,784 --> 01:20:20,870
I tried to tell you many times

724
01:20:20,975 --> 01:20:23,478
... but I never seemed to find the right moment.

721
01:20:23,791 --> 01:20:26,815
would this have changed , if I had ?

722
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:30,257
after now ,I don't think so

723
01:20:30,570 --> 01:20:32,656
No, I didn't think so either.

729
01:20:32,761 --> 01:20:35,472
why didn't you tell me this before

724
01:20:36,619 --> 01:20:38,619
maybe I had to prove a point.

725
01:20:39,950 --> 01:20:42,000
I was a friend of your father.

726
01:20:42,877 --> 01:20:46,631
 that's right , I thought he'd told me everything about you.

727
01:20:46,736 --> 01:20:48,405
he had.

728
01:20:48,509 --> 01:20:51,430
everything that he considered important.

729
01:20:51,742 --> 01:20:54,350
 it didn't make any difference to him.

730
01:20:54,453 --> 01:20:56,574
he judged a man as a man 

731
01:20:57,583 --> 01:21:00,920
He was right! ,he was so very right

732
01:21:02,277 --> 01:21:04,000
I'm sorry

739
01:21:07,074 --> 01:21:09,785
How I must have hurt you...

740
01:21:09,890 --> 01:21:11,976
...both of you.

741
01:21:13,123 --> 01:21:14,583
Forget it

734
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:16,877
Erica, looks like we are now on our own .

735
01:21:16,982 --> 01:21:19,381
harry is not coming.

736
01:21:19,486 --> 01:21:22,823
- Are you serious?
- Yes

737
01:21:23,239 --> 01:21:24,387
Bwana...

738
01:21:25,430 --> 01:21:27,203
Coming , Amtagka.

739
01:21:27,411 --> 01:21:30,000
maybe you can talk and sense into him.

740
01:21:34,712 --> 01:21:37,000
Will you be staying a long time?

741
01:21:38,050 --> 01:21:39,600
I don't know...

742
01:21:40,971 --> 01:21:44,308
... maybe a year, maybe more.

743
01:21:46,394 --> 01:21:49,001
I guess I've taken from my father more than I thought.

744
01:21:49,105 --> 01:21:52,130
this place makes me feel so at home.

745
01:21:52,234 --> 01:21:54,425
I can undestand why.

746
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:56,719
It's so gentle and peaceful.

747
01:21:56,823 --> 01:21:58,823
It's not just that ,It's...

748
01:22:01,517 --> 01:22:05,479
I think Rick is right. I'm all mixed up by...

749
01:22:05,479 --> 01:22:09,000
 there's only one way:
to live for today.

750
01:22:09,443 --> 01:22:11,730
today must be the world...

751
01:22:11,841 --> 01:22:14,760
... eternity and everything.

752
01:22:17,474 --> 01:22:19,038
Well , you're coming?

753
01:22:19,142 --> 01:22:21,142
I think we are both staying.

754
01:22:23,106 --> 01:22:25,818
I've heard it all!
you're both crazy!

755
01:22:26,026 --> 01:22:28,842
Erica... you're going to stay?

756
01:22:29,050 --> 01:22:31,033
If you'll ask me .

757
01:22:31,763 --> 01:22:35,300
 It's because today I suddenly believe
that I love you

758
01:22:36,039 --> 01:22:39,793
 today?, I believe I've loved you for many days. 

759
01:22:39,897 --> 01:22:42,087
only today is important.

760
01:22:42,192 --> 01:22:45,356
Well , aren't you gonna ask her to stay?

761
01:22:47,303 --> 01:22:49,284
Will you?

762
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:54,395
Good luck to both of you.

763
01:22:54,499 --> 01:22:57,002
I'm proud to have you as a friend , Rick.

764
01:22:57,941 --> 01:23:00,965
 Do me a favor , will  you?
take this with you...

765
01:23:01,070 --> 01:23:03,365
... bury it somewhere in the desert.

766
01:23:03,677 --> 01:23:05,972
I'll bury it deep.

767
01:23:06,911 --> 01:23:09,831
I'd have been a lousy husband anyway.

768
01:23:14,628 --> 01:23:18,591
you know, the drums carry a long distance

769
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:22,200
I hope one day they'll tell me you have a fine son.
