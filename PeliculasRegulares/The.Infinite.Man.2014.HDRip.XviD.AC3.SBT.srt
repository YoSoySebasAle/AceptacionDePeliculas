708
00:48:10,233 --> 00:48:14,203
For one whole year
I did nothing but watch us.

709
00:48:14,236 --> 00:48:18,207
- You watched us for a year?

710
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:22,812
- But we won't...we won't stay
here for a year, I mean...

711
00:48:22,845 --> 00:48:24,646
We can't.

712
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,649
- We did it.

713
00:48:27,683 --> 00:48:31,087
We were here...together.

714
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:33,589
We were happy.

715
00:48:33,622 --> 00:48:34,924
Why would you
want to change that?

716
00:48:34,957 --> 00:48:39,562
- I don't. I just...I just think
we would be happier...

717
00:48:39,595 --> 00:48:41,430
somewhere else.

718
00:48:41,464 --> 00:48:43,832
- Look. One year from now
he'll finish building the
device.

719
00:48:43,866 --> 00:48:46,569
Everyone will travel back,
and it will be just the two of
us.

720
00:48:46,602 --> 00:48:48,403
Then we can go
where ever we want,

721
00:48:48,437 --> 00:48:51,440
and not have to
worry about these...

722
00:48:51,474 --> 00:48:54,443
people.

723
00:48:54,476 --> 00:48:56,812
I know you like the beach,
just...

724
00:48:56,846 --> 00:48:59,348
Please trust me to get us
through this. I know what to do.

725
00:48:59,382 --> 00:49:01,784
I've all ready seen
us do it and it works.

726
00:49:01,817 --> 00:49:07,756
And I know in the meantime
we can be...happy here.

727
00:49:16,398 --> 00:49:18,233
- Not now.

728
00:49:20,902 --> 00:49:22,371
- It's only one year, and...

729
00:49:22,404 --> 00:49:27,209
and summer always flies
by, so it's like...nine months.

730
00:49:27,242 --> 00:49:29,212
Nine to twelve months.

731
00:49:29,245 --> 00:49:31,079
Twelve months.

732
00:49:31,113 --> 00:49:33,782
Then we can leave.

733
00:49:36,018 --> 00:49:41,824
- And what did we do exactly
for the next...twelve months?

734
00:49:51,066 --> 00:49:54,570
- Do you remember
our first actual date?

735
00:49:54,603 --> 00:49:56,872
- I do

736
00:49:56,906 --> 00:50:00,142
- I was nervous as hell.

737
00:50:00,175 --> 00:50:03,211
You were relaxed, talkative.

738
00:50:03,245 --> 00:50:05,381
Then I found your notes.

739
00:50:05,414 --> 00:50:07,282
Famous quotes, current affairs,
topics of conversation.

740
00:50:07,315 --> 00:50:09,818
- Art, music, science.

741
00:50:12,121 --> 00:50:15,524
- Do you remember
everything about that night?

742
00:50:15,557 --> 00:50:16,625
- Everything.

743
00:50:19,861 --> 00:50:22,898
In fact, I recorded it on tape.

744
00:50:24,566 --> 00:50:26,035
I wanted to review it
after the date,

745
00:50:26,068 --> 00:50:27,869
and make sure
that I sounded natural.

746
00:50:27,903 --> 00:50:29,371
- "Obviously it relies on the

747
00:50:29,405 --> 00:50:32,208
presumption of male
hetrosexual spectatorship.

748
00:50:32,241 --> 00:50:34,610
Does that make
it a bad painting? No."

749
00:50:36,145 --> 00:50:37,747
"And...of course..."

750
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:39,881
"of course..."

751
00:50:39,915 --> 00:50:41,817
- "Dean, are you okay?"

752
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:43,585
( FAST FORWARDS TAPE)

753
00:50:43,619 --> 00:50:44,920
- "And of course there's George
Brock..."

754
00:50:44,953 --> 00:50:47,256
Later I edited the tape,
I spliced in a few gags...

755
00:50:47,289 --> 00:50:48,790
Thing's I didn't think of at
the time.

756
00:50:48,824 --> 00:50:51,861
- "Getting Brock the
basics, you might say..."

757
00:50:51,894 --> 00:50:53,729
( LAUGHTER )

758
00:50:53,762 --> 00:50:55,097
- That's not my laugh.

759
00:50:55,131 --> 00:50:58,500
- No, it's the closest I could
find.

760
00:50:59,468 --> 00:51:01,437
- You know what this is?
- What?

761
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:06,075
- Just...one big revision.

762
00:51:06,108 --> 00:51:07,743
- It's an improvement, it's
not...

763
00:51:07,776 --> 00:51:09,378
- Is this an improvement?

764
00:51:09,411 --> 00:51:11,380
- I would say so, yes.

765
00:51:11,413 --> 00:51:16,251
- Because sometimes it
feels...a little unorthodox.

766
00:51:17,653 --> 00:51:20,289
- No...

767
00:51:20,322 --> 00:51:24,059
This is the modern world.

768
00:51:24,092 --> 00:51:25,761
It's a modern relationship.

769
00:51:25,794 --> 00:51:27,996
- What are you doing?

770
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:32,134
- Going to the bathroom.

771
00:51:32,167 --> 00:51:34,737
To see if I can lure
a Dean into a cubical.

772
00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:37,506
- See, I would say
that's a little "unorthodox".

773
00:51:37,539 --> 00:51:40,042
- Unorthodox.

774
00:51:40,075 --> 00:51:42,044
I am a man
responding to his environment.

775
00:51:42,077 --> 00:51:43,645
Have you got lipstick?

776
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:46,348
- I don't want to say
that you're living in the past

777
00:51:46,382 --> 00:51:47,850
- Well obviously,
I am living in the past.

778
00:51:47,883 --> 00:51:49,151
- But, I mean...

779
00:51:49,184 --> 00:51:53,655
You say you fell disconnected.
- Shhh.

780
00:51:56,625 --> 00:51:59,695
- Maybe that's why...
you feel disconnected.

781
00:51:59,728 --> 00:52:02,597
Maybe if you just stop
listening and watching...

782
00:52:02,631 --> 00:52:04,467
- What about you?

783
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,001
- Well, what about me?
- I see the way you look at him.

784
00:52:06,034 --> 00:52:09,605
- It's the same way I look at
you.

785
00:52:09,638 --> 00:52:11,907
- Exactly.

786
00:52:11,941 --> 00:52:12,975
- So I do not want
me to look at you?

787
00:52:13,008 --> 00:52:14,142
- No. Him.
- Who?

788
00:52:14,176 --> 00:52:17,112
- Dean!

789
00:52:17,146 --> 00:52:19,615
- Are you jealous?

790
00:52:19,648 --> 00:52:21,617
- Should I be?

791
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:25,954
- I do not even know
how to answer that.

792
00:52:25,988 --> 00:52:28,257
- I used to watch us up here.

793
00:52:30,292 --> 00:52:34,263
I used to think we were happy.

794
00:52:34,296 --> 00:52:37,833
- We are happy.

795
00:52:37,866 --> 00:52:40,936
- We could be happier.

796
00:52:45,073 --> 00:52:48,977
- Why do you
hate yourself so much?

797
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:53,882
- Are you kidding? Look at him!

798
00:52:57,319 --> 00:52:59,555
Sorry. Just forget about it.

799
00:52:59,588 --> 00:53:01,690
Tomorrow everything
returns to normal.

800
00:53:01,723 --> 00:53:04,059
Everyone travels back.

801
00:53:04,092 --> 00:53:07,463
And we're alone. Together.

802
00:53:07,496 --> 00:53:09,765
We can...

803
00:53:09,798 --> 00:53:12,968
go where ever we want.

804
00:53:22,311 --> 00:53:23,845
This is the plan.

805
00:53:23,879 --> 00:53:25,180
We do not touch a thing.

806
00:53:25,214 --> 00:53:27,215
Everyone travels back,
just like they always have...

807
00:53:27,248 --> 00:53:29,485
and then we are alone. Okay?

808
00:53:29,518 --> 00:53:30,619
- Okay

809
00:53:30,652 --> 00:53:33,422
- Good. Okay.

810
00:53:36,492 --> 00:53:39,895
- Happy Anniversary.
Don't worry, I am here to help.

811
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:44,466
Okay, I was in the
bedroom, testing the amp.

812
00:53:44,499 --> 00:53:46,868
- Dean!
- You called out...

813
00:53:46,902 --> 00:53:49,371
I came down.

814
00:53:49,404 --> 00:53:51,807
The other Lana, where is she.
She should be here by now.

815
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,075
- I do not know.

816
00:53:53,108 --> 00:53:54,310
- Well, this is
how it began, remember?

817
00:53:54,343 --> 00:53:55,477
With her down there.

818
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:56,878
- Well maybe...
- If Lana doesn't show,

819
00:53:56,912 --> 00:53:58,113
then Dean won't travel back...

820
00:53:58,146 --> 00:54:01,884
and if Dean doesn't
travel back, then...

821
00:54:01,917 --> 00:54:05,487
Things will get very
complicated.

822
00:54:08,256 --> 00:54:10,759
You have to go down there.

823
00:54:10,793 --> 00:54:13,128
- What?

824
00:54:13,161 --> 00:54:14,796
- Yea. Until the other Lana
arrives, you have to go down
there

825
00:54:14,829 --> 00:54:18,567
and say all the things she said.
It has to be exactly the same.

826
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:21,102
- It's nuts, it won't work!
- It will work. It has to.

827
00:54:21,136 --> 00:54:22,971
It's the only way

828
00:54:23,004 --> 00:54:25,440
- But what if he
takes me back with him?

829
00:54:25,474 --> 00:54:27,243
- That's impossible,
it can't happen.

830
00:54:27,276 --> 00:54:29,645
You'll switch with the
other Lana before then...

831
00:54:29,678 --> 00:54:31,480
they'll travel back
and once they do...

832
00:54:31,513 --> 00:54:33,582
it's just you and me. It's
simple.

833
00:54:33,616 --> 00:54:37,619
- How will I even
know what to say?

834
00:54:46,361 --> 00:54:49,564
- Tape this to your chest.

835
00:54:49,597 --> 00:54:53,435
Put this in your ear.

836
00:54:55,937 --> 00:54:58,407
And I'll tell you
exactly what to say.

837
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,843
- You tell me what to say? No
no.

838
00:55:01,876 --> 00:55:07,382
- Not tell, remind. Your words.
I am just reminding you.

839
00:55:10,052 --> 00:55:13,221
Testing, testing.

840
00:55:15,391 --> 00:55:19,694
It is the only way
to ensure they travel back.

841
00:55:19,728 --> 00:55:23,065
- And how do I know which one
is him and which one is you?

842
00:55:23,098 --> 00:55:26,869
Just listen to your heart.

843
00:55:26,902 --> 00:55:31,707
Also, listen to the
ear piece and will tell you.

844
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:36,411
- Okay, stop there.

845
00:55:36,444 --> 00:55:38,680
Now call out his name twice.

846
00:55:38,714 --> 00:55:42,384
- Dean!
Dean!

847
00:55:45,754 --> 00:55:48,190
- Ok, good. Now...

848
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:49,291
He is going to come to you,

849
00:55:49,324 --> 00:55:52,461
just stay there and
repeat what I say.

850
00:55:52,494 --> 00:55:56,331
- This is insane.
This isn't going to work.

851
00:55:56,364 --> 00:55:59,801
- Shhh. Here he comes.

852
00:56:04,439 --> 00:56:05,340
- Hello

853
00:56:05,373 --> 00:56:05,940
- Hi.

854
00:56:05,974 --> 00:56:06,941
- Hello.

855
00:56:06,975 --> 00:56:08,343
- You look...different.

856
00:56:08,376 --> 00:56:09,444
- You look different.

857
00:56:09,478 --> 00:56:10,045
- Different?

858
00:56:10,078 --> 00:56:11,146
- More stable.

859
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:14,883
- I am. I'm very stable.

860
00:56:14,917 --> 00:56:15,984
I want us to try things again.

861
00:56:16,018 --> 00:56:16,752
- Again?

862
00:56:16,785 --> 00:56:18,387
- Please?

863
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,556
- I do not know if I can do
that.

864
00:56:20,589 --> 00:56:21,723
- Why not? Have you been
with him this last year?

865
00:56:21,757 --> 00:56:23,558
- Isn't that what you wanted?

866
00:56:23,592 --> 00:56:25,794
- What? No!

867
00:56:25,828 --> 00:56:29,598
I did so much for you.
We played songs, Dutch songs.

868
00:56:29,631 --> 00:56:31,065
We ate dolmades!

869
00:56:31,099 --> 00:56:33,034
I had plans for
very, very tantric stuff,

870
00:56:33,068 --> 00:56:34,369
It was going
to be the perfect day...

871
00:56:34,403 --> 00:56:37,239
- You threatened to set me on
fire.

872
00:56:37,272 --> 00:56:38,206
- Yes, but prior to that...

873
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,842
- Then you called me a whore.

874
00:56:40,875 --> 00:56:42,844
- It sounds better in French...

875
00:56:42,878 --> 00:56:45,714
- And all Dutch folk dancing ine
world isn't going to change
that.

876
00:56:45,747 --> 00:56:47,148
- Well no, that would be...

877
00:56:47,182 --> 00:56:48,450
Why would you even suggest it?

878
00:56:48,483 --> 00:56:52,453
- Because you're wearing clogs.

879
00:56:52,487 --> 00:56:55,057
- The clogs are incidental...

880
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:58,927
- See? You're doing it again.
It's going to be just like last
time.

881
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,562
- No, not this time.

882
00:57:00,595 --> 00:57:01,462
I am in control of

01:18:45,032 --> 01:18:49,670
And if I do, if I do get better
then I'll come back for you.

1235
01:18:49,703 --> 01:18:51,872
- But not now.

1236
01:18:54,108 --> 01:18:56,744
- No, not now.

1237
01:18:56,777 --> 01:18:59,613
- It might take some time.

1238
01:19:03,217 --> 01:19:05,785
- But I'll come back for you.

1239
01:19:05,819 --> 01:19:07,855
- Okay.

1240
01:19:39,019 --> 01:19:40,287
- Lana!
