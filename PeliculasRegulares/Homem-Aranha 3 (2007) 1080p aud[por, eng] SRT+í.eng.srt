1
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:21,120
<b>It's me, Peter Parker.
Your friendly neighborhood...</b>

2
00:03:21,245 --> 00:03:22,246
<b>... you know.</b>

3
00:03:22,371 --> 00:03:25,498
<b>I've come a long way from being
the boy who was bit by a spider.</b>

4
00:03:25,582 --> 00:03:28,502
<b>Back then, nothing seemed
to go right for me. Now...</b>

5
00:03:28,627 --> 00:03:30,087
<b>Wow, look, it's Spider-Man!</b>

6
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,839
<b>- Super cool!
- Spider-man!</b>

7
00:03:31,964 --> 00:03:34,049
<b>... people really like me.</b>

8
00:03:34,258 --> 00:03:36,969
<b>Stick around. It's gonna start again
in a couple minutes.</b>

9
00:03:37,094 --> 00:03:39,763
<b>That's okay.</b>

10
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:42,683
<b>The city is safe and sound.</b>

11
00:03:42,808 --> 00:03:44,768
<b>I guess I've had something
to do with that.</b>

12
00:03:44,893 --> 00:03:46,770
<b>My Uncle Ben would be proud.</b>

13
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:54,695
<b>I still get to school. Top of my class.</b>

14
00:03:54,778 --> 00:03:56,655
<b>Now, the Hamiltonian shows us...</b>

15
00:03:56,864 --> 00:04:01,243
<b>...that the energy levels
are perturbed by the electric field.</b>

16
00:04:03,662 --> 00:04:08,250
<b>From the form of this matrix,
we can see?</b>

17
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,335
<b>Miss Stacy?</b>

18
00:04:10,461 --> 00:04:13,756
<b>That only the "m equals zero
quantum states" are affected.</b>

19
00:04:13,797 --> 00:04:17,009
<b>Correct. Good work, Miss Stacy.</b>

20
00:04:20,888 --> 00:04:24,391
<b>Parker? You got something to add?</b>

21
00:04:25,142 --> 00:04:26,894
<b>No, sir.</b>

22
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:33,484
<b>And I'm in love
with the girl of my dreams.</b>

23
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,250
<b>Hi.</b>

24
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:54,963
<b>Miss Watson left a ticket for me.
Peter Parker.</b>

25
00:04:55,798 --> 00:04:57,341
<b>Excuse me. Sorry.</b>

26
00:04:57,466 --> 00:04:59,968
<b>Thank you. Sorry.</b>

27
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:08,394
<b>I'm so nervous.</b>

28
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:34,461
<b>That's my girlfriend.</b>

29
00:06:48,535 --> 00:06:51,121
<b>- I thought she was good.
- Yeah.</b>

30
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:53,832
<b>Harry?</b>

31
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,501
<b>Harry!</b>

32
00:06:55,626 --> 00:06:57,669
<b>I need to talk to you.</b>

33
00:06:58,212 --> 00:06:59,963
<b>Explain things.</b>

34
00:07:01,965 --> 00:07:05,719
<b>Tell it to my father.
Raise him from the dead.</b>

35
00:07:07,388 --> 00:07:11,225
<b>I'm your friend, Harry.
I cared about your father.</b>

36
00:07:20,317 --> 00:07:21,235
<b>M. J!</b>

37
00:07:21,485 --> 00:07:23,737
<b>- Peter!
- Congrats!</b>

38
00:07:23,862 --> 00:07:26,240
<b>- Was I good?
- Good? You were great.</b>

39
00:07:26,365 --> 00:07:28,742
<b>- You were...
- You said great.</b>

40
00:07:28,867 --> 00:07:32,496
<b>I love my flowers, they're beautiful.
And those are from Harry.</b>

41
00:07:32,621 --> 00:07:36,583
<b>- Was he here tonight?
- Yeah, I ran into him outside.</b>

42
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:39,920
<b>- What's with you guys anyway?
- It's complicated.</b>

43
00:07:40,003 --> 00:07:42,089
<b>Tell me again. Was I really good?</b>

44
00:07:42,214 --> 00:07:44,591
<b>I was so nervous.
My knees were shaking.</b>

45
00:07:44,717 --> 00:07:47,302
<b>- Your knees were fine.
- The applause wasn't very loud.</b>

46
00:07:47,428 --> 00:07:49,304
<b>Yes, it was. Well, it's the acoustics.</b>

47
00:07:49,513 --> 00:07:52,725
<b>It's all about diffusion. It keeps
the sound waves from grouping.</b>

48
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,769
<b>When the sound waves,
they propagate, then it's like an...</b>

49
00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:57,855
<b>You are such a nerd.</b>

50
00:08:50,616 --> 00:08:52,493
<b>Did you see that one?</b>

51
00:09:01,752 --> 00:09:03,545
<b>You know what?</b>

52
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:08,634
<b>I'd like to sing on-stage
for the rest of my life...</b>

53
00:09:08,675 --> 00:09:11,136
<b>...with you in the first row.</b>

54
00:09:12,429 --> 00:09:14,390
<b>I'll be there.</b>

55
00:09:16,266 --> 00:09:18,560
<b>Tell me you love me.</b>

56
00:09:20,646 --> 00:09:22,731
<b>I love you.</b>

57
00:09:23,023 --> 00:09:25,317
<b>I love you so much.</b>

58
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,153
<b>I always have.</b>

59
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:17,369
<b>- Ready?
- Yep.</b>

60
00:12:13,026 --> 00:12:15,404
<b>You can't hide here, Flint.</b>

61
00:12:15,821 --> 00:12:19,992
<b>- I'm just here to see my daughter.
- You are an escaped convict.</b>

62
00:12:20,117 --> 00:12:23,954
<b>The cops are looking for you.
You're not getting near her.</b>

63
00:12:24,288 --> 00:12:27,583
<b>You're nothing but a common thief.</b>

64
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:31,253
<b>- You maybe even killed a man?
- It wasn't like that.</b>

65
00:12:31,962 --> 00:12:33,756
<b>It wasn't.</b>

66
00:12:33,881 --> 00:12:36,050
<b>I had good reason
for what I was doing.</b>

67
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:37,384
<b>And that's the truth.</b>

68
00:12:37,634 --> 00:12:41,972
<b>You and the truth, sitting in prison,
having three meals a day together.</b>

69
00:12:41,972 --> 00:12:44,600
<b>I live in the presence of great truth...</b>

70
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,102
<b>...and that is the truth
that you left behind...</b>

71
00:12:47,227 --> 00:12:50,105
<b>...right there in that bedroom.</b>

72
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,912
<b>Penny.</b>

73
00:13:05,871 --> 00:13:07,539
<b>I missed you.</b>

74
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:11,377
<b>I miss you too, Daddy.</b>

75
00:13:22,262 --> 00:13:25,891
<b>I promise I'll make you healthy again.</b>

76
00:13:26,016 --> 00:13:29,019
<b>Whatever it takes, I'll get the money.</b>

77
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:32,356
<b>You get out of here. Now.</b>

78
00:13:43,409 --> 00:13:45,494
<b>I'm not a bad person.</b>

79
00:13:47,287 --> 00:13:49,456
<b>Just had bad luck.</b>

80
00:14:07,307 --> 00:14:08,934
<b>Peter, what is it?</b>

81
00:14:10,811 --> 00:14:12,479
<b>It's M. J.</b>

82
00:14:13,313 --> 00:14:16,859
<b>- I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
- Oh, Peter.</b>

83
00:14:18,861 --> 00:14:23,741
<b>The day your Uncle Ben asked me
to marry him, we were so scared.</b>

84
00:14:23,741 --> 00:14:25,617
<b>And excited.</b>

85
00:14:25,743 --> 00:14:27,494
<b>And very young.</b>

86
00:14:27,619 --> 00:14:30,748
<b>And I loved him so fiercely.</b>

87
00:14:30,748 --> 00:14:32,833
<b>- And you said yes, right?
- No.</b>

88
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:35,419
<b>I wanted to say yes, but I said no.</b>

89
00:14:35,544 --> 00:14:38,338
<b>I wasn't ready. Neither was he.</b>

90
00:14:38,464 --> 00:14:40,841
<b>So we took our time.</b>

91
00:14:40,966 --> 00:14:43,469
<b>Looked forward to it.</b>

92
00:14:43,594 --> 00:14:47,222
<b>Didn't want to run into something
with nothing to count on but love.</b>

93
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:51,477
<b>A man has to be understanding...</b>

94
00:14:51,602 --> 00:14:54,730
<b>...and put his wife before himself.</b>

95
00:14:55,439 --> 00:14:57,941
<b>Can you do that, Peter?</b>

96
00:14:59,526 --> 00:15:02,321
<b>Yeah, I think I can.</b>

97
00:15:02,446 --> 00:15:05,866
<b>Then you have my blessing.</b>

98
00:15:07,951 --> 00:15:11,080
<b>I hope you've considered
a proper proposal.</b>

99
00:15:11,205 --> 00:15:14,541
<b>Your uncle had it all planned.</b>

100
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,627
<b>He took me to the beach
one Sunday.</b>

101
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,630
<b>Oh, he was a knockout
in his bathing suit.</b>

102
00:15:19,755 --> 00:15:22,341
<b>And I didn't look too bad myself.</b>

103
00:15:22,466 --> 00:15:24,426
<b>We were very good swimmers.</b>

104
00:15:24,551 --> 00:15:27,137
<b>And it was a beautiful day
and he said:</b>

105
00:15:27,262 --> 00:15:29,223
<b>"Let's swim to the island."</b>

106
00:15:29,348 --> 00:15:34,978
<b>And at the island, we found
a perfect spot by an old tree...</b>

107
00:15:34,978 --> 00:15:38,607
<b>...and we lay down
and looked up at the sky.</b>

108
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:42,069
<b>And then he said,
"Close your eyes, May."</b>

109
00:15:42,152 --> 00:15:44,988
<b>And I did.
And then he said, "Open them."</b>

110
00:15:44,988 --> 00:15:46,865
<b>And I did.</b>

111
00:15:47,074 --> 00:15:49,993
<b>And he was holding this ring.</b>

112
00:15:51,245 --> 00:15:52,704
<b>Dazzling...</b>

113
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,581
<b>...in front of me.</b>

114
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,461
<b>I thought it was the sun.</b>

115
00:16:01,755 --> 00:16:04,675
<b>We'd be married 50 years...</b>

116
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:08,429
<b>...come August if...</b>

117
00:16:15,018 --> 00:16:16,478
<b>So...</b>

118
00:16:18,021 --> 00:16:23,569
<b>...I hope you'll make it very special
for Mary Jane.</b>

119
00:16:24,194 --> 00:16:27,322
<b>Do something she'll never forget.</b>

120
00:16:30,242 --> 00:16:31,910
<b>Give her this.</b>

121
00:16:33,704 --> 00:16:36,373
<b>Go on. Take it.</b>

122
00:17:53,534 --> 00:17:56,036
<b>- Harry.
- You knew this was coming, Pete.</b>

123
00:17:59,623 --> 00:18:02,209
<b>Listen to me. I didn't kill your father.</b>

124
00:18:04,086 --> 00:18:06,046
<b>He was trying to kill me.
He killed himself.</b>

125
00:18:06,171 --> 00:18:07,923
<b>Shut up!</b>

126
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,319
<b>I'm still here, Peter.</b>

127
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,387
<b>Hate those things.</b>

128
00:21:16,987 --> 00:21:18,655
<b>Harry?</b>

129
00:21:22,493 --> 00:21:23,952
<b>Harry.</b>

130
00:21:24,912 --> 00:21:26,455
<b>Harry.</b>

131
00:21:31,377 --> 00:21:33,253
<b>Oh, my God.</b>

132
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,470
<b>Harry!</b>

133
00:21:43,347 --> 00:21:45,224
<b>Come on!</b>

134
00:21:47,935 --> 00:21:49,603
<b>God.</b>

135
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,525
<b>- Defib.
- Two hundred.</b>

136
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,402
<b>And clear.</b>

137
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:57,861
<b>No response.</b>

138
00:21:57,945 --> 00:21:59,738
<b>- Recharge, let's go again.
- Go ahead.</b>

139
00:21:59,863 --> 00:22:02,324
<b>- Charging.
- And clear.</b>

140
00:22:02,449 --> 00:22:03,492
<b>No response.</b>

141
00:22:03,617 --> 00:22:06,912
<b>Let's recharge and do it
one more time. And clear.</b>

142
00:22:12,543 --> 00:22:14,128
<b>Captain Stacy.</b>

143
00:22:14,837 --> 00:22:16,088
<b>- What's this?
- Flint Marko.</b>

144
00:22:16,296 --> 00:22:18,382
<b>The guy we tied
to the Ben Parker homicide.</b>

145
00:22:18,507 --> 00:22:20,384
<b>- What about him?
- Broke out of Rikers.</b>

146
00:22:20,592 --> 00:22:21,844
<b>- And?
- He's on the run.</b>

147
00:22:22,052 --> 00:22:24,221
<b>He's in the marshlands.
I think we got him.</b>

148
00:22:28,517 --> 00:22:30,185
<b>There he is.</b>

149
00:22:48,829 --> 00:22:51,874
<b>You two, take the west side.
Tommy, take the east.</b>

150
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,921
<b>Where did he go?</b>

151
00:23:19,943 --> 00:23:21,570
<b>- Capacitors charged.
- Right.</b>

152
00:23:21,695 --> 00:23:23,781
<b>Donnie, we got a little fluctuation
on one.</b>

153
00:23:23,989 --> 00:23:27,743
<b>- There's a change in the silicon mass.
- It's probably a bird. It'll fly away.</b>

154
00:23:27,868 --> 00:23:29,703
<b>Initiating demolecularization.</b>

155
00:24:59,626 --> 00:25:01,670
<b>- How is he?
- He's gonna be okay.</b>

156
00:25:01,795 --> 00:25:04,298
<b>But there's been
some memory impairment.</b>

157
00:25:04,381 --> 00:25:06,050
<b>Particularly his short-term memory.</b>

158
00:25:06,175 --> 00:25:08,260
<b>Right now he can't
remember the accident...</b>

159
00:25:08,469 --> 00:25:10,637
<b>...or anything that happened
to him recently.</b>

160
00:25:10,763 --> 00:25:12,014
<b>Is it permanent?</b>

161
00:25:12,139 --> 00:25:15,225
<b>It could be. Only time will tell.</b>

162
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:17,853
<b>He's awake if you wanna see him.</b>

163
00:25:17,978 --> 00:25:19,313
<b>Maybe I should wait.</b>

164
00:25:19,396 --> 00:25:22,858
<b>No, it's fine. Just keep it brief.
I want him to rest.</b>

165
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,170
<b>Hey, buddy.</b>

166
00:25:43,837 --> 00:25:45,255
<b>Hey.</b>

167
00:25:46,006 --> 00:25:47,549
<b>Hit my head.</b>

168
00:25:47,674 --> 00:25:49,218
<b>Yeah.</b>

169
00:25:49,551 --> 00:25:51,845
<b>Doctor said I was in an accident.</b>

170
00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:53,097
<b>Hit-and-run.</b>

171
00:25:53,722 --> 00:25:56,308
<b>I don't remember much of anything.</b>

172
00:25:57,768 --> 00:25:59,436
<b>My father...</b>

173
00:25:59,978 --> 00:26:01,647
<b>...he died, right?</b>

174
00:26:03,857 --> 00:26:06,318
<b>This is all so weird.</b>

175
00:26:07,486 --> 00:26:11,115
<b>Hi. I got here as fast as I could.</b>

176
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,282
<b>I know that face.</b>

177
00:26:12,699 --> 00:26:13,826
<b>How you doing?</b>

178
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,619
<b>I don't know.</b>

179
00:26:15,703 --> 00:26:17,788
<b>Last thing I remember, I was fine.</b>

180
00:26:18,038 --> 00:26:19,164
<b>Somewhere.</b>

181
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,041
<b>You're still fine.</b>

182
00:26:22,626 --> 00:26:24,461
<b>We love you, Harry.</b>

183
00:26:25,129 --> 00:26:27,172
<b>It feels like...</b>

184
00:26:28,048 --> 00:26:31,552
<b>...somehow I've been gone
for a really long time.</b>

185
00:26:33,053 --> 00:26:34,805
<b>And now I'm back home.</b>

186
00:26:35,431 --> 00:26:37,599
<b>It's good to have you back.</b>

187
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,687
<b>I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to ask
you guys to scoot, okay?</b>

188
00:26:41,812 --> 00:26:44,189
<b>- Okay.
- All right. Thank you.</b>

189
00:26:44,314 --> 00:26:46,275
<b>Well, I'll see you tomorrow.</b>

190
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,444
<b>Yeah. Great.</b>

191
00:26:49,194 --> 00:26:50,738
<b>Get some sleep.</b>

192
00:26:54,324 --> 00:26:56,785
<b>- I think he's gonna be fine.
- I think so.</b>

193
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:59,621
<b>- And you guys seem great.
- Yeah.</b>

194
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,418
<b>You have lovely friends.</b>

195
00:27:04,501 --> 00:27:06,712
<b>My best friends.</b>

196
00:27:09,339 --> 00:27:11,508
<b>I'd give my life for them.</b>

197
00:30:21,073 --> 00:30:23,367
<b>- Yeah?
- It's me.</b>

198
00:30:24,201 --> 00:30:25,661
<b>Hey.</b>

199
00:30:25,953 --> 00:30:28,163
<b>Peter, you know I can't open the door.</b>

200
00:30:28,372 --> 00:30:29,832
<b>It's stuck again?</b>

201
00:30:30,374 --> 00:30:32,418
<b>Just come on and help me.</b>

202
00:30:32,543 --> 00:30:34,211
<b>I'm coming.</b>

203
00:30:40,259 --> 00:30:42,428
<b>- Hey.
- The review.</b>

204
00:30:43,303 --> 00:30:46,390
<b>- They hated it. They hated me.
- Well, they can't hate you.</b>

205
00:30:46,515 --> 00:30:48,892
<b>"The young Miss Watson
is a pretty girl...</b>

206
00:30:49,017 --> 00:30:51,186
<b>...easy on the eyes,
but not on the ears.</b>

207
00:30:51,311 --> 00:30:53,605
<b>Her small voice didn't carry
past the first row."</b>

208
00:30:53,731 --> 00:30:55,899
<b>That's ridiculous, I was right there.</b>

209
00:30:55,983 --> 00:30:57,568
<b>You were in the first row.</b>

210
00:30:57,776 --> 00:31:01,113
<b>Yeah, this... Listen, you were great.</b>

211
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:05,784
<b>That's a critic. This is something
you're gonna have to get used to.</b>

212
00:31:05,826 --> 00:31:09,455
<b>Believe me, I know.
Spider-Man gets attacked all the time.</b>

213
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:13,625
<b>This isn't about you. This is about me.
It's about my career.</b>

214
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:17,254
<b>I know, and I'm just saying
you can't let it bring you down.</b>

215
00:31:17,379 --> 00:31:20,090
<b>You gotta believe in yourself
and pull yourself together.</b>

216
00:31:20,174 --> 00:31:21,967
<b>You get right back
on the horse and...</b>

217
00:31:22,176 --> 00:31:24,053
<b>Don't give me the horse thing.</b>

218
00:31:24,178 --> 00:31:26,638
<b>Try and understand how I feel.</b>

219
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,228
<b>It's just...</b>

220
00:31:36,148 --> 00:31:38,233
<b>...I look at these words...</b>

221
00:31:39,193 --> 00:31:41,570
<b>...and it's like my father wrote them.</b>

222
00:31:42,613 --> 00:31:46,992
<b>All cars. All cars in the vicinity of
54th and Sixth Avenue, please report.</b>

223
00:31:46,992 --> 00:31:49,703
<b>Crane out of control,
approach with caution.</b>

224
00:31:52,956 --> 00:31:54,708
<b>"Go get them, tiger"?</b>

225
00:31:56,877 --> 00:31:58,545
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

226
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,123
<b>Oh, my God. 7-Adam to Central.</b>

227
00:32:34,248 --> 00:32:37,126
<b>That crane job you sent us on?
It's bigger than we thought.</b>

228
00:32:37,251 --> 00:32:40,587
<b>We're gonna need
a major mobilization right away.</b>

229
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:50,389
<b>Shut it down at the generator. Now!</b>

230
00:32:53,726 --> 00:32:57,146
<b>Okay, Gwen, I've got a secret:
It's my copier.</b>

231
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:03,110
<b>What is that thing
doing in my background?</b>

232
00:33:28,761 --> 00:33:31,472
<b>They got some kind of short.
Can't shut down the crane.</b>

233
00:33:31,555 --> 00:33:34,475
<b>Get Edison on the phone.
Kill the power to the whole block.</b>

234
00:33:38,145 --> 00:33:39,188
<b>Are you all right?</b>

235
00:33:39,396 --> 00:33:41,065
<b>It's coming back.</b>

236
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,193
<b>Oh, no.</b>

237
00:34:07,966 --> 00:34:10,886
<b>- Oh, my God. That's Gwen.
- What?</b>

238
00:34:16,016 --> 00:34:17,434
<b>What's she doing up there?</b>

239
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:20,479
<b>I just saw her last night.
She said she had a modeling gig.</b>

240
00:34:20,479 --> 00:34:23,607
<b>- Who are you?
- It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock Jr.</b>

241
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:25,484
<b>And I work at the Daily Bugle.</b>

242
00:34:26,193 --> 00:34:28,612
<b>And I'm dating your daughter.</b>

243
00:35:23,876 --> 00:35:25,210
<b>You okay?</b>

244
00:35:25,335 --> 00:35:27,838
<b>Yeah, I'm fine.</b>

245
00:35:28,047 --> 00:35:29,089
<b>Thank you.</b>

246
00:35:29,173 --> 00:35:31,592
<b>Hey, Spidey, hold on.
Bugle needs a photo.</b>

247
00:35:31,675 --> 00:35:33,552
<b>- Thank God you're okay.
- Daddy.</b>

248
00:35:33,677 --> 00:35:35,637
<b>Hey. I'm the new guy.</b>

249
00:35:35,763 --> 00:35:37,014
<b>New guy?</b>

250
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:39,600
<b>You okay?</b>

251
00:35:39,725 --> 00:35:42,853
<b>From now on, I am gonna be
taking shots of you for the Bugle.</b>

252
00:35:42,853 --> 00:35:45,773
<b>So smile. Are you smiling?
Just kidding.</b>

253
00:35:45,856 --> 00:35:48,358
<b>- They got a guy.
- Who, Parker?</b>

254
00:35:48,776 --> 00:35:53,072
<b>Yeah, look, just between you and me,
guy's kind of an amateur.</b>

255
00:35:53,072 --> 00:35:55,866
<b>Have you noticed his stuff
makes you look a little bloated?</b>

256
00:35:55,991 --> 00:35:58,369
<b>Just... Yeah, a little chunky.</b>

257
00:35:58,702 --> 00:36:00,371
<b>Okay.</b>

258
00:36:00,996 --> 00:36:03,499
<b>But you don't have to worry about that
anymore, buddy.</b>

259
00:36:12,341 --> 00:36:13,300
<b>Dazzle me.</b>

260
00:36:21,016 --> 00:36:24,019
<b>Just something the boys in
the Ad Department and I whipped up.</b>

261
00:36:24,144 --> 00:36:27,064
<b>As you know, circulation at the Bugle's
been pretty good.</b>

262
00:36:27,064 --> 00:36:29,024
<b>Though not as good
as The New York Times.</b>

263
00:36:29,149 --> 00:36:32,069
<b>Or the Daily News, or the Post,
or several other smaller...</b>

264
00:36:32,069 --> 00:36:34,154
<b>Get on with it, you moron...!</b>

265
00:36:34,363 --> 00:36:36,240
<b>- What?
- Your blood pressure, Mr. Jameson.</b>

266
00:36:36,323 --> 00:36:39,660
<b>- Your wife told you to watch the anger.
- You tell my wife...</b>

267
00:36:43,122 --> 00:36:44,998
<b>Thank you.</b>

268
00:36:46,875 --> 00:36:49,878
<b>So I propose this campaign.</b>

269
00:36:50,129 --> 00:36:52,589
<b>''Daily Bugle. " That's obvious.</b>

270
00:36:52,715 --> 00:36:55,926
<b>"It's hip, it's now."
I came up with that one.</b>

271
00:36:56,677 --> 00:36:59,471
<b>"It's wow." That's actually Erickson.
He goes crazy.</b>

272
00:36:59,596 --> 00:37:01,890
<b>We gave him a couple lattes,
it's like:</b>

273
00:37:02,182 --> 00:37:05,102
<b>"And how." That's me again.</b>

274
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:07,312
<b>Time to take your pill.</b>

275
00:37:08,564 --> 00:37:10,232
<b>Not that one.</b>

276
00:37:10,983 --> 00:37:12,735
<b>Not that one.</b>

277
00:37:20,868 --> 00:37:23,245
<b>Drink plenty of water.</b>

278
00:37:27,124 --> 00:37:28,584
<b>Thank you.</b>

279
00:37:30,961 --> 00:37:31,920
<b>Continue.</b>

280
00:37:35,466 --> 00:37:38,177
<b>- He's busy.
- I'm just here to talk to you, beautiful.</b>

281
00:37:38,302 --> 00:37:39,845
<b>What's that smell?</b>

282
00:37:39,928 --> 00:37:43,390
<b>That's a little something called
Nice and Easy. What's on you?</b>

283
00:37:43,474 --> 00:37:45,142
<b>It's called Go Away.</b>

284
00:37:45,267 --> 00:37:47,227
<b>That is the dumbest idea
you've ever had...</b>

285
00:37:47,352 --> 00:37:50,481
<b>...and you have had some doozies.
- Blood pressure.</b>

286
00:37:50,689 --> 00:37:52,441
<b>Hey, where are you going?</b>

287
00:37:54,151 --> 00:37:56,737
<b>- Who are you?
- You hired him last week. Freelance.</b>

288
00:37:56,945 --> 00:37:59,865
<b>- I did? What's that smell?
- It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock Jr.</b>

289
00:37:59,865 --> 00:38:03,285
<b>Can I just say I really like that shirt?
It's the crane accident.</b>

290
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,371
<b>- Check out the light.
- He likes my shirt.</b>

291
00:38:05,496 --> 00:38:06,622
<b>- Hey, Betty.
- Hey, Pete.</b>

292
00:38:06,747 --> 00:38:08,624
<b>You better get in there. New guy.</b>

293
00:38:08,749 --> 00:38:11,627
<b>He's trying to sell
some Spidey photos.</b>

294
00:38:13,087 --> 00:38:14,671
<b>Thanks.</b>

295
00:38:14,755 --> 00:38:17,800
<b>Parker. You're late, maybe too late.
Bruckner beat you to it.</b>

296
00:38:17,925 --> 00:38:19,551
<b>It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock Jr.</b>

297
00:38:19,676 --> 00:38:22,054
<b>- But I got you this.
- But he got me this.</b>

298
00:38:22,179 --> 00:38:24,556
<b>I didn't see you there.
How'd you get that high?</b>

299
00:38:24,681 --> 00:38:27,601
<b>- Climbed. Nearly fell off a flagpole.
- A flagpole?</b>

300
00:38:27,684 --> 00:38:30,729
<b>- Which one do we use?
- I like Bernstein's.</b>

301
00:38:30,729 --> 00:38:31,980
<b>- It's better.
- Cheaper too.</b>

302
00:38:32,189 --> 00:38:34,900
<b>Congratulations, we'll use yours.
I'll pay you 50 bucks.</b>

303
00:38:35,025 --> 00:38:36,443
<b>All right, J. J., I'm your man.</b>

304
00:38:36,568 --> 00:38:39,363
<b>I know more about a good picture
than any photographer.</b>

305
00:38:39,488 --> 00:38:43,325
<b>See, photography, it's not just about,
no offense, flagpoles or whatever.</b>

306
00:38:43,367 --> 00:38:45,619
<b>It's about lighting.
Composition. Drama.</b>

307
00:38:46,453 --> 00:38:47,913
<b>I want a staff job, sir.</b>

308
00:38:48,038 --> 00:38:51,250
<b>I have a girl that I intend to marry...</b>

309
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:54,378
<b>...and I guess, I don't know,
I have this stupid little dream...</b>

310
00:38:54,503 --> 00:38:58,132
<b>...of working with one of the greatest
newspaper editors of our time.</b>

311
00:38:58,549 --> 00:38:59,925
<b>J. Jonah Jameson.</b>

312
00:39:03,345 --> 00:39:06,181
<b>Well, we do have an opening.
Johnson quit, remember?</b>

313
00:39:06,306 --> 00:39:07,516
<b>- You fired him.
- Whatever.</b>

314
00:39:07,641 --> 00:39:10,644
<b>I know what makes a good picture
and I've been here a long time.</b>

315
00:39:10,769 --> 00:39:12,855
<b>If there's a staff job,
I think I deserve it.</b>

316
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:16,900
<b>He's right, Jonah. Peter's been with us
for years. He's done a great job.</b>

317
00:39:17,025 --> 00:39:18,986
<b>You want a staff job,
you want a staff job.</b>

318
00:39:19,111 --> 00:39:20,988
<b>- Anybody care about what I want?
- I do.</b>

319
00:39:21,071 --> 00:39:22,948
<b>Shut up. Get out.</b>

320
00:39:23,073 --> 00:39:26,618
<b>I want the public to see Spider-Man
for the two-bit criminal he really is.</b>

321
00:39:26,744 --> 00:39:30,998
<b>He's a fake, he's full of stickum.
Catch him in the act.</b>

322
00:39:31,081 --> 00:39:33,375
<b>Spider-Man with his hand
in a cookie jar.</b>

323
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,586
<b>Whoever brings me that photo
gets a job.</b>

324
00:39:35,669 --> 00:39:37,546
<b>What're you waiting for,
Chinese New Year?</b>

325
00:39:37,671 --> 00:39:39,131
<b>I'm on it, boss.</b>

326
00:39:40,591 --> 00:39:41,925
<b>You'll never get that shot.</b>

327
00:39:42,051 --> 00:39:43,385
<b>Oh, we'll see.</b>

328
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:03,113
<b>You know, I guess one person
can make a difference.</b>

329
00:40:04,448 --> 00:40:06,241
<b>Enough said.</b>

330
00:40:11,455 --> 00:40:13,957
<b>Welcome home, Harry.</b>

331
00:40:14,792 --> 00:40:18,212
<b>- Thank God you're all right.
- Thanks, Bernard.</b>

332
00:40:18,337 --> 00:40:20,422
<b>- Bernard.
- Sir.</b>

333
00:40:22,383 --> 00:40:25,010
<b>Got you a little homecoming present.</b>

334
00:40:25,969 --> 00:40:27,721
<b>- It's your old ball.
- Yeah.</b>

335
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:28,972
<b>Thanks, buddy.</b>

336
00:40:29,807 --> 00:40:32,101
<b>We were pretty good
in the backyard, weren't we?</b>

337
00:40:32,226 --> 00:40:35,938
<b>We were terrible.
And we tried out for the varsity team.</b>

338
00:40:35,979 --> 00:40:38,023
<b>- For the cheerleaders.
- Right.</b>

339
00:40:38,232 --> 00:40:40,859
<b>- Hey, do I have any girlfriends?
- I don't know.</b>

340
00:40:40,984 --> 00:40:42,111
<b>You don't?</b>

341
00:40:42,736 --> 00:40:45,447
<b>Hey, Bernard.
Do I have any girlfriends?</b>

342
00:40:45,447 --> 00:40:48,033
<b>Not that I know of, sir.</b>

343
00:40:53,497 --> 00:40:55,124
<b>It's a pretty cool pad, huh?</b>

344
00:40:55,249 --> 00:40:57,000
<b>It's okay.</b>

345
00:40:57,126 --> 00:41:00,254
<b>- Looks like I'm not hurting for money.
- No.</b>

346
00:41:00,254 --> 00:41:04,091
<b>Well, maybe I can turn this
no-girlfriend thing around.</b>

347
00:41:11,515 --> 00:41:16,729
<b>You know, he always appreciated how
you helped me through high school.</b>

348
00:41:17,146 --> 00:41:19,857
<b>Just wish I could remember
more about him.</b>

349
00:41:21,316 --> 00:41:24,862
<b>Well, he loved you.
That's the main thing.</b>

350
00:41:25,904 --> 00:41:30,492
<b>Hey, let's watch a game in the kitchen.
Get something to eat.</b>

351
00:41:30,492 --> 00:41:31,618
<b>Okay.</b>

352
00:41:32,995 --> 00:41:34,121
<b>Heads up.</b>

353
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:38,834
<b>Did you see that?</b>

354
00:41:39,543 --> 00:41:41,837
<b>- Still got the moves.
- Yeah.</b>

355
00:42:15,537 --> 00:42:16,580
<b>Why are we stopping?</b>

356
00:42:20,751 --> 00:42:21,794
<b>What is she doing here?</b>

357
00:42:22,002 --> 00:42:23,962
<b>Well, Gary was supposed
to call her agent.</b>

358
00:42:26,507 --> 00:42:29,176
<b>Hi, honey. We tried to reach you.</b>

359
00:42:29,301 --> 00:42:30,844
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

360
00:42:30,969 --> 00:42:32,096
<b>One critic?</b>

361
00:42:32,221 --> 00:42:33,472
<b>No, all the papers, dear.</b>

362
00:42:34,515 --> 00:42:37,017
<b>Mary Jane, honey, sit down.
Let us explain it to you.</b>

363
00:42:37,101 --> 00:42:39,812
<b>Listen, if you'd like,
we could say you became ill.</b>

364
00:42:50,656 --> 00:42:52,741
<b>That was so poorly handled.</b>

365
00:42:52,866 --> 00:42:54,326
<b>Yeah.</b>

366
00:42:54,827 --> 00:42:56,704
<b>Let's just rehearse.</b>

367
00:43:02,376 --> 00:43:04,753
<b>All right, Spidey.</b>

368
00:43:42,916 --> 00:43:45,002
<b>Spidey! Spidey! Spidey!</b>

369
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:48,839
<b>Excuse me, miss? Could I please
see that gorgeous smile?</b>

370
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:50,716
<b>Hi, Eddie.</b>

371
00:43:50,841 --> 00:43:54,053
<b>You're so beautiful.
This is front-page stuff.</b>

372
00:43:54,178 --> 00:43:55,721
<b>I gotta practice. See you later.</b>

373
00:43:55,846 --> 00:43:57,806
<b>- How about tonight?
- Not tonight.</b>

374
00:43:57,931 --> 00:43:59,391
<b>Why not?</b>

375
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:03,645
<b>What about that amazing,
amazing night that we had?</b>

376
00:44:04,605 --> 00:44:07,816
<b>We had a coffee, Eddie.</b>

377
00:44:07,816 --> 00:44:09,610
<b>Hey, beautiful.</b>

378
00:44:10,235 --> 00:44:11,695
<b>One more.</b>

379
00:44:14,948 --> 00:44:17,409
<b>- Everything okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.</b>

380
00:44:17,534 --> 00:44:21,789
<b>- You're not still mad at me, are you?
- No, Peter, I'm proud of you.</b>

381
00:44:21,914 --> 00:44:23,999
<b>Hey, I'm gonna be swinging in
from over there.</b>

382
00:44:24,124 --> 00:44:26,293
<b>- Oh, yeah?
- So you know where to look.</b>

383
00:44:27,753 --> 00:44:29,088
<b>Give them a good show.</b>

384
00:44:29,963 --> 00:44:31,382
<b>Don't worry about that review.</b>

385
00:44:31,507 --> 00:44:35,052
<b>We're gonna be laughing about it
tomorrow night, I promise.</b>

386
00:44:35,177 --> 00:44:36,720
<b>Yeah.</b>

387
00:44:53,404 --> 00:44:56,198
<b>Isn't that that guy
from that prison break?</b>

388
00:44:56,323 --> 00:44:57,783
<b>He fits.</b>

389
00:44:57,991 --> 00:45:00,577
<b>Hey, you. Halt.</b>

390
00:45:01,328 --> 00:45:02,996
<b>Cover the back.</b>

391
00:45:06,458 --> 00:45:08,502
<b>Hon, be careful.</b>

392
00:45:57,009 --> 00:45:58,135
<b>He's in the truck.</b>

393
00:45:58,385 --> 00:46:00,345
<b>Round the front.</b>

394
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,943
<b>Fire.</b>

395
00:46:39,009 --> 00:46:40,594
<b>People of the city of New York...</b>

396
00:46:40,803 --> 00:46:44,348
<b>...I am here today
because I fell 62 stories...</b>

397
00:46:44,431 --> 00:46:46,016
<b>...and someone caught me.</b>

398
00:46:46,225 --> 00:46:49,228
<b>Someone who never asks
for anything in return.</b>

399
00:46:49,353 --> 00:46:53,190
<b>Someone who doesn't even want us
to know who he is.</b>

400
00:46:53,315 --> 00:46:54,358
<b>Hey, M. J.</b>

401
00:46:54,441 --> 00:46:56,860
<b>- Harry.
- Hey.</b>

402
00:46:56,944 --> 00:46:58,404
<b>Where's Pete?</b>

403
00:46:59,279 --> 00:47:01,323
<b>- Taking somebody's picture, I guess.
- Right.</b>

404
00:47:01,448 --> 00:47:04,368
<b>I'm so happy to see you.
You look so good, Harry.</b>

405
00:47:04,451 --> 00:47:05,828
<b>I've never felt better.</b>

406
00:47:05,953 --> 00:47:08,122
<b>It's a weird feeling
not knowing who you are.</b>

407
00:47:08,205 --> 00:47:11,041
<b>Bump on the head,
I'm as free as a bird.</b>

408
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:13,544
<b>Will you bump me on the head?</b>

409
00:47:15,629 --> 00:47:17,923
<b>Hey, Pete said you're in a play.</b>

410
00:47:18,132 --> 00:47:20,843
<b>You came. You sent me flowers.</b>

411
00:47:20,968 --> 00:47:23,554
<b>I did? I'll come again tonight.</b>

412
00:47:24,054 --> 00:47:27,182
<b>You can't. I was let go.</b>

413
00:47:27,307 --> 00:47:29,184
<b>What happened?</b>

414
00:47:30,644 --> 00:47:32,187
<b>I wasn't very good.</b>

415
00:47:33,647 --> 00:47:35,733
<b>You know, this is embarrassing...</b>

416
00:47:35,858 --> 00:47:38,152
<b>...but I once wrote you a play
in high school.</b>

417
00:47:38,235 --> 00:47:40,029
<b>- You wrote me a play?
- Yeah.</b>

418
00:47:40,154 --> 00:47:41,697
<b>Harry, that's the sweetest thing.</b>

419
00:47:41,905 --> 00:47:45,242
<b>So I ask you: When you're dropping
without a parachute...</b>

420
00:47:45,242 --> 00:47:48,787
<b>...or your store's being robbed
or your house is on fire...</b>

421
00:47:48,912 --> 00:47:50,956
<b>...who is it that breaks your fall...</b>

422
00:47:51,081 --> 00:47:54,835
<b>...puts out the flames
and saves your children?</b>

423
00:47:54,918 --> 00:47:56,587
<b>Spider-Man.</b>

424
00:47:56,712 --> 00:47:57,963
<b>They love me.</b>

425
00:47:58,088 --> 00:48:01,508
<b>Then let's hear it
for your one and only...</b>

426
00:48:01,508 --> 00:48:06,096
<b>...friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man.</b>

427
00:48:18,108 --> 00:48:21,403
<b>Hey. What's up? All right.
How you doing?</b>

428
00:48:22,863 --> 00:48:24,865
<b>Shazam!</b>

429
00:48:26,867 --> 00:48:27,868
<b>Hey, guys.</b>

430
00:48:28,118 --> 00:48:29,745
<b>Spider-Man. Spider-Man.</b>

431
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:32,039
<b>Hey there. Hi.</b>

432
00:48:33,832 --> 00:48:35,167
<b>- Kiss him.
- Kiss him.</b>

433
00:48:35,292 --> 00:48:38,212
<b>Kiss him. Kiss him. Kiss him.</b>

434
00:48:39,129 --> 00:48:40,714
<b>Go ahead, lay one on me.</b>

435
00:48:40,798 --> 00:48:42,591
<b>- Really?
- Yeah, they'll love it.</b>

436
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,343
<b>- Kiss her.
- Kiss him.</b>

437
00:48:44,468 --> 00:48:45,719
<b>No, Spider-Man, no.</b>

438
00:48:45,803 --> 00:48:47,805
<b>All right.</b>

439
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,274
<b>Hope Pete's getting a shot of this.</b>

440
00:49:04,697 --> 00:49:06,782
<b>Hey, hey, are you okay?</b>

441
00:49:06,907 --> 00:49:08,242
<b>Yeah, I'm fine.</b>

442
00:49:54,121 --> 00:49:56,206
<b>Hey, man,
we got something on the roof.</b>

443
00:50:18,812 --> 00:50:19,980
<b>Jig's up, pal.</b>

444
00:50:20,814 --> 00:50:23,609
<b>I don't wanna hurt you. Leave now.</b>

445
00:50:23,734 --> 00:50:27,071
<b>I guess you haven't heard.
I'm the sheriff around these parts.</b>

446
00:50:27,154 --> 00:50:28,322
<b>Okay.</b>

447
00:51:06,902 --> 00:51:08,362
<b>Help!</b>

448
00:51:42,896 --> 00:51:45,482
<b>Where do all these guys come from?</b>

449
00:52:38,869 --> 00:52:40,329
<b>I'm sorry, I don't speak...</b>

450
00:52:40,454 --> 00:52:43,874
<b>But this is a French restaurant, non?</b>

451
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:49,797
<b>- Name, please?
- Parker, Peter.</b>

452
00:52:53,675 --> 00:52:54,927
<b>Here we are.</b>

453
00:52:55,135 --> 00:52:57,304
<b>Table for two. Parker.</b>

454
00:52:58,472 --> 00:53:02,643
<b>- Parker.
- That is what I said: Parker.</b>

455
00:53:05,562 --> 00:53:06,897
<b>I have a request.</b>

456
00:53:07,022 --> 00:53:11,610
<b>My girlfriend will be coming
and I have this ring.</b>

457
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:18,367
<b>Hello.</b>

458
00:53:18,492 --> 00:53:21,412
<b>Oh, so you want to
pop the question tonight, huh?</b>

459
00:53:21,495 --> 00:53:24,415
<b>Yes, and I wanna do something
very special.</b>

460
00:53:24,665 --> 00:53:27,126
<b>I love it. Romance.</b>

461
00:53:27,251 --> 00:53:28,794
<b>I am French.</b>

462
00:53:30,796 --> 00:53:34,341
<b>When I signal you, if you'd bring some
champagne with the ring...</b>

463
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:36,927
<b>- In the bottom of her glass?
- Perfect.</b>

464
00:53:37,886 --> 00:53:40,180
<b>Also, I thought at the same time...</b>

465
00:53:40,264 --> 00:53:43,934
<b>...if the musicians
would play this song...</b>

466
00:53:44,852 --> 00:53:47,062
<b>Their favorite.</b>

467
00:53:47,271 --> 00:53:49,773
<b>And take good care of the ring.</b>

468
00:53:49,982 --> 00:53:52,568
<b>Oui, with my life, monsieur.</b>

469
00:53:55,529 --> 00:53:57,156
<b>I like you.</b>

470
00:54:00,284 --> 00:54:01,869
<b>Thank you.</b>

471
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:15,299
<b>Okay, so...</b>

472
00:54:15,841 --> 00:54:18,218
<b>Oh, would you like
some champagne?</b>

473
00:54:21,889 --> 00:54:23,974
<b>How'd that get in there?</b>

474
00:54:25,225 --> 00:54:27,519
<b>Oh, don't cry.</b>

475
00:54:32,524 --> 00:54:33,650
<b>Hi.</b>

476
00:54:34,735 --> 00:54:36,779
<b>Look at you. Wow, beautiful.</b>

477
00:54:36,904 --> 00:54:38,447
<b>Thanks.</b>

478
00:54:42,743 --> 00:54:44,411
<b>This place in your budget?</b>

479
00:54:44,495 --> 00:54:46,705
<b>Oh, well, it's a special occasion.</b>

480
00:54:47,414 --> 00:54:48,999
<b>You're on Broadway.</b>

481
00:54:50,334 --> 00:54:52,336
<b>I don't feel like
much of a star tonight.</b>

482
00:54:52,419 --> 00:54:55,881
<b>Well, you are a star.
And you've earned it.</b>

483
00:54:56,298 --> 00:54:57,549
<b>Peter...</b>

484
00:54:59,009 --> 00:55:01,095
<b>...you have no idea
how I feel right now.</b>

485
00:55:01,178 --> 00:55:04,306
<b>Oh, no, I know exactly how you feel.</b>

486
00:55:04,848 --> 00:55:09,311
<b>Listen, I have been through this.
It happens to me all the time.</b>

487
00:55:09,353 --> 00:55:11,313
<b>I see Spider-Man posters
in the window...</b>

488
00:55:11,438 --> 00:55:13,816
<b>...kids running around
with me on their sweaters...</b>

489
00:55:13,941 --> 00:55:15,567
<b>Big Halloween item.</b>

490
00:55:15,693 --> 00:55:18,612
<b>I don't know, I guess I've become
something of an icon.</b>

491
00:55:18,696 --> 00:55:23,617
<b>Like yesterday, they kept screaming,
"Spider-Man, Spider-Man."</b>

492
00:55:24,368 --> 00:55:27,788
<b>I don't know, you know, I mean,
I'm thinking to myself:</b>

493
00:55:27,788 --> 00:55:31,834
<b>"I'm just a nerdy kid from Queens.
Do I deserve this?"</b>

494
00:55:33,961 --> 00:55:35,170
<b>Hi, Pete.</b>

495
00:55:35,629 --> 00:55:36,630
<b>Hi.</b>

496
00:55:44,471 --> 00:55:47,599
<b>Hi, my parents and I
were just having dinner here.</b>

497
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:50,310
<b>- Hello. I'm Gwen Stacy.
- Hi.</b>

498
00:55:50,519 --> 00:55:52,896
<b>This is Mary Jane Watson.</b>

499
00:55:54,273 --> 00:55:58,444
<b>Oh, it's so nice to finally meet you.
Pete talks about you all the time.</b>

500
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:04,491
<b>Gwen is my lab partner
in Dr. Connors' class.</b>

501
00:56:04,491 --> 00:56:07,828
<b>Pete's something of a genius.
I'd be completely lost without him.</b>

502
00:56:07,828 --> 00:56:09,788
<b>Which actually reminds me...</b>

503
00:56:09,913 --> 00:56:13,125
<b>...Pete, if you've got a picture
of my kiss with Spider-Man...</b>

504
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:15,544
<b>...could you bring it to class?</b>

505
00:56:15,669 --> 00:56:20,007
<b>I'd really love it. For my portfolio.</b>

506
00:56:20,007 --> 00:56:23,052
<b>After all,
who gets kissed by Spider-Man, right?</b>

507
00:56:23,677 --> 00:56:25,554
<b>I can't imagine.</b>

508
00:56:26,597 --> 00:56:29,391
<b>Well, it was lovely to meet you.</b>

509
00:56:30,267 --> 00:56:31,810
<b>- Good night.
- Good night.</b>

510
00:56:43,072 --> 00:56:44,948
<b>Oh, she's in my science class.</b>

511
00:56:45,157 --> 00:56:47,117
<b>It's not her best subject.</b>

512
00:56:49,536 --> 00:56:50,579
<b>What?</b>

513
00:56:50,788 --> 00:56:53,082
<b>How come
you never mentioned her?</b>

514
00:56:54,458 --> 00:56:56,919
<b>She's your lab partner?</b>

515
00:56:57,044 --> 00:56:59,213
<b>You saved her life?</b>

516
00:56:59,338 --> 00:57:00,672
<b>She thinks you're a genius...</b>

517
00:57:00,798 --> 00:57:04,218
<b>...and she had her
polished fingernails all over you?</b>

518
00:57:04,343 --> 00:57:05,886
<b>Or didn't you notice?</b>

519
00:57:07,471 --> 00:57:10,599
<b>And she gave Spider-Man
the key to the city.</b>

520
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:13,936
<b>I'll never forget that.</b>

521
00:57:17,481 --> 00:57:18,941
<b>She's just a girl in my class.</b>

522
00:57:19,149 --> 00:57:20,901
<b>Let me ask you something.</b>

523
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:23,112
<b>When you kissed her...</b>

524
00:57:23,237 --> 00:57:25,698
<b>...who was kissing her?</b>

525
00:57:25,823 --> 00:57:28,617
<b>Spider-Man or Peter?</b>

526
00:57:28,742 --> 00:57:31,745
<b>- What do you mean?
- You know exactly what I mean.</b>

527
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:34,164
<b>That was our kiss.</b>

528
00:57:34,248 --> 00:57:35,833
<b>Why would you do that?</b>

529
00:57:36,667 --> 00:57:40,003
<b>You must have known
how it'd make me feel.</b>

530
00:57:40,337 --> 00:57:43,966
<b>- Do you wanna push me away?
- Push you away?</b>

531
00:57:44,091 --> 00:57:46,677
<b>Why would I wanna push you away?
I love you.</b>

532
00:57:46,677 --> 00:57:50,848
<b>You're my girlfriend.
She's a girl in my class, M. J.</b>

533
00:57:52,182 --> 00:57:54,393
<b>I don't feel well.
I'm sorry, I have to go.</b>

534
00:57:54,518 --> 00:57:55,519
<b>No, w...</b>

535
00:57:57,187 --> 00:58:00,232
<b>- Where are you going?
- Please, don't follow me.</b>

536
00:58:03,444 --> 00:58:05,029
<b>Here we are.</b>

537
00:58:41,398 --> 00:58:44,526
<b>Hi, it's M. J.
Sing your song at the beep.</b>

538
00:58:45,903 --> 00:58:47,363
<b>Hello.</b>

539
00:58:50,074 --> 00:58:53,827
<b>I wish you'd pick up the phone.
I don't know what's going on or...</b>

540
00:58:53,911 --> 00:58:56,955
<b>I don't know if you
got the messages or what.</b>

541
00:58:57,373 --> 00:58:58,499
<b>But...</b>

542
00:58:59,875 --> 00:59:02,586
<b>... I just wanna talk to you.</b>

543
00:59:03,837 --> 00:59:06,215
<b>Okay, call me. Bye.</b>

544
00:59:17,518 --> 00:59:19,061
<b>- Hello?
- Mr. Parker?</b>

545
00:59:19,269 --> 00:59:20,312
<b>Yeah?</b>

546
00:59:20,521 --> 00:59:23,023
<b>This is Detective Neil Garrett
from the 32nd Precinct.</b>

547
00:59:23,107 --> 00:59:24,983
<b>I'm calling on behalf
of Captain Stacy.</b>

548
00:59:25,109 --> 00:59:27,611
<b>He would like you
to come down to the station.</b>

549
00:59:27,695 --> 00:59:31,240
<b>Originally, we thought that this man,
Dennis Carradine...</b>

550
00:59:31,365 --> 00:59:33,325
<b>...was your husband's killer.</b>

551
00:59:33,659 --> 00:59:35,327
<b>We were wrong.</b>

552
00:59:35,869 --> 00:59:36,870
<b>What?</b>

553
00:59:36,995 --> 00:59:39,915
<b>Turns out Mr. Carradine
was only an accomplice.</b>

554
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,501
<b>The actual killer is still at large.</b>

555
00:59:42,626 --> 00:59:44,378
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

556
00:59:44,503 --> 00:59:47,005
<b>This is the man
who killed your husband.</b>

557
00:59:51,802 --> 00:59:53,053
<b>His name is Flint Marko.</b>

558
00:59:53,262 --> 00:59:56,390
<b>He's a small-time crook
who's been in and out of prison.</b>

559
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:57,850
<b>You got this wrong.</b>

560
00:59:58,058 --> 00:59:59,309
<b>Two days ago he escaped.</b>

561
01:00:00,144 --> 01:00:02,855
<b>Evidently, he confessed his guilt
to a cellmate...</b>

562
01:00:02,855 --> 01:00:06,817
<b>...and we have a couple of witnesses
who will corroborate the story.</b>

563
01:00:18,912 --> 01:00:21,498
<b>No, wait, son.
You don't wanna do this.</b>

564
01:00:24,752 --> 01:00:26,003
<b>No!</b>

565
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:37,681
<b>Hey, get in! What are you doing?</b>

566
01:00:56,450 --> 01:00:58,327
<b>Would you put these photos away,
please?</b>

567
01:00:58,535 --> 01:01:00,913
<b>I'm sorry, Mrs. Parker.
I know this isn't easy...</b>

568
01:01:01,038 --> 01:01:03,540
<b>...but, please, be patient with us.</b>

569
01:01:03,624 --> 01:01:05,501
<b>We're doing our job.
We will catch him.</b>

570
01:01:05,626 --> 01:01:07,294
<b>No, you're not doing your job.</b>

571
01:01:07,378 --> 01:01:10,297
<b>I watched my uncle die,
and we chased down the wrong man.</b>

572
01:01:10,422 --> 01:01:13,550
<b>Now you're telling me you had
suspicions for two years? Witnesses?</b>

573
01:01:13,634 --> 01:01:15,844
<b>- Why weren't we told about this?
- Settle down.</b>

574
01:01:16,053 --> 01:01:17,721
<b>I have no intention of settling down.</b>

575
01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:20,516
<b>This man killed my uncle,
and he's still out there!</b>

576
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,943
<b>L-20 Parkway.</b>

577
01:01:31,068 --> 01:01:33,570
<b>All officers in the vicinity,
please report.</b>

578
01:01:33,904 --> 01:01:35,447
<b>We have an abandoned vehicle...</b>

579
01:01:35,656 --> 01:01:37,950
<b>... and an elderly man
in the middle of the street.</b>

580
01:01:38,075 --> 01:01:40,452
<b>Sorry, Wabash Avenue.</b>

581
01:01:43,372 --> 01:01:44,623
<b>Peter, it's M. J.</b>

582
01:01:45,999 --> 01:01:48,043
<b>I'm not here about
what happened at dinner.</b>

583
01:01:48,252 --> 01:01:49,420
<b>Just please open up.</b>

584
01:01:57,010 --> 01:01:59,638
<b>Aunt May called me.
She told me about what happened.</b>

585
01:01:59,638 --> 01:02:01,306
<b>She's worried about you.</b>

586
01:02:02,141 --> 01:02:03,600
<b>I'm worried about you.</b>

587
01:02:03,684 --> 01:02:05,144
<b>Don't be. I'm fine.</b>

588
01:02:05,769 --> 01:02:07,771
<b>I don't want you
to do something stupid.</b>

589
01:02:07,855 --> 01:02:10,357
<b>Like try to find my uncle's killer?</b>

590
01:02:10,482 --> 01:02:12,985
<b>And do something you'll regret.</b>

591
01:02:13,110 --> 01:02:16,113
<b>Like with that other guy.</b>

592
01:02:16,739 --> 01:02:19,950
<b>He had a gun on me. I made a move
and he fell. I told you that.</b>

593
01:02:20,075 --> 01:02:23,287
<b>- I'm not accusing you of anything.
- 10-22, auto at 556...</b>

594
01:02:23,537 --> 01:02:27,583
<b>- Will you turn that thing off?
- Crossing 5-6 to 5-7.</b>

595
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:32,588
<b>Yeah, Central, this is Car 3-9
responding to your Sixth Avenue call.</b>

596
01:02:32,588 --> 01:02:36,008
<b>Peter, I'm here
because I care about you.</b>

597
01:02:36,133 --> 01:02:39,762
<b>And I know that you made a mistake
and that you feel guilty...</b>

598
01:02:39,803 --> 01:02:43,432
<b>...but I wanna be here for you.</b>

599
01:02:43,432 --> 01:02:46,769
<b>Okay. I get it. Thank you.</b>

600
01:02:46,769 --> 01:02:49,480
<b>But I'm fine. I...</b>

601
01:02:49,563 --> 01:02:51,440
<b>I don't need your help.</b>

602
01:02:58,864 --> 01:03:01,784
<b>Everybody needs help sometimes,
Peter.</b>

603
01:03:01,909 --> 01:03:03,744
<b>Even Spider-Man.</b>

604
01:03:12,002 --> 01:03:14,713
<b>Ninety X-ray, 98.</b>

605
01:03:16,382 --> 01:03:21,261
<b>Two-four King, respond to 1031

608
01:03:33,691 --> 01:03:37,653
<b>Three Henry 10- 11,

609
01:04:37,921 --> 01:04:39,673
<b>Don't hurt me.
Just give me a chance!</b>

610
01:04:39,798 --> 01:04:42,801
<b>What about my uncle?
Did you give him a chance?</b>

611
01:04:42,926 --> 01:04:44,053
<b>Did you?</b>

612
01:04:56,190 --> 01:04:58,025
<b>Where am I?</b>

613
01:05:14,291 --> 01:05:15,959
<b>What is this?</b>

614
01:05:18,170 --> 01:05:19,838
<b>I feel...</b>

615
01:05:24,426 --> 01:05:26,720
<b>This feels good.</b>

616
01:05:38,732 --> 01:05:40,484
<b>Yeah!</b>

617
01:05:56,667 --> 01:05:58,293
<b>This is something else.</b>

618
01:06:00,421 --> 01:06:01,630
<b>What do you think?</b>

619
01:06:01,755 --> 01:06:03,924
<b>I've never seen anything like it.</b>

620
01:06:04,049 --> 01:06:05,926
<b>I'm a physicist, not a biologist...</b>

621
01:06:06,135 --> 01:06:08,929
<b>...but let me look at it in the morning.
Run some tests.</b>

622
01:06:09,054 --> 01:06:10,097
<b>Can we do that now?</b>

623
01:06:15,102 --> 01:06:17,396
<b>It seems to like you.</b>

624
01:06:19,773 --> 01:06:22,484
<b>- Don't let any of that get on you.
- Why not?</b>

625
01:06:22,609 --> 01:06:25,195
<b>It has the characteristics
of a symbiote...</b>

626
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:28,532
<b>...which needs to bond
to a host to survive.</b>

627
01:06:28,657 --> 01:06:32,411
<b>And sometimes these things in nature,
when they bind...</b>

628
01:06:32,411 --> 01:06:34,913
<b>...they can be hard to unbind.</b>

629
01:06:36,165 --> 01:06:40,127
<b>Bank robbery in progress,

<b>Another sandstorm

- Marko.</b>

632
01:07:40,938 --> 01:07:43,315
<b>Buddy, love the new outfit.</b>

633
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,484
<b>This is exactly what I need
to scoop Parker.</b>

634
01:07:45,609 --> 01:07:47,486
<b>Give some of that web action.</b>

635
01:07:49,154 --> 01:07:51,323
<b>See you, chump.</b>

636
01:07:52,908 --> 01:07:54,660
<b>What the hell?</b>

01:08:36,994 --> 01:08:38,162
<b>Flint Marko.</b>

638
01:08:40,998 --> 01:08:44,001
<b>- What do you want from me?
- Remember Ben Parker?</b>

639
01:08:44,626 --> 01:08:47,755
<b>The old man you shot down
in cold blood?</b>

640
01:08:49,214 --> 01:08:50,883
<b>What does it matter to you, anyway?</b>

641
01:08:52,676 --> 01:08:54,094
<b>Everything!</b>

642
01:09:31,757 --> 01:09:34,134
<b>It's time to pay, Marko!</b>

643
01:10:44,121 --> 01:10:46,206
<b>Good riddance.</b>

644
01:11:06,977 --> 01:11:09,646
<b>- Rent.
- Not now.</b>

645
01:11:09,980 --> 01:11:12,691
<b>Listen, it's a free country.
It's not rent-free country.</b>

646
01:11:13,108 --> 01:11:15,069
<b>- Leave me alone.
- Give me rent.</b>

647
01:11:15,194 --> 01:11:18,197
<b>You'll get your rent
when you fix this damn door!</b>

648
01:11:29,249 --> 01:11:31,251
<b>That wasn't cool.</b>

649
01:11:31,543 --> 01:11:35,714
<b>He is a good boy.</b>

650
01:11:37,424 --> 01:11:39,385
<b>He must be in some kind of trouble.</b>

651
01:12:27,349 --> 01:12:30,769
<b>Flint Marko,
the man who killed Uncle Ben...</b>

652
01:12:31,645 --> 01:12:34,106
<b>...he was killed last night.</b>

653
01:12:34,231 --> 01:12:35,691
<b>Oh, my.</b>

654
01:12:36,525 --> 01:12:37,443
<b>What happened?</b>

655
01:12:38,193 --> 01:12:39,653
<b>Spider-Man killed him.</b>

656
01:12:41,530 --> 01:12:42,656
<b>Spider-Man?</b>

657
01:12:43,615 --> 01:12:45,701
<b>I don't understand.</b>

658
01:12:45,826 --> 01:12:48,620
<b>Spider-Man doesn't kill people.</b>

659
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:52,041
<b>What happened?</b>

660
01:12:54,668 --> 01:12:56,420
<b>I...</b>

661

<b>He was...</b>

663
01:13:05,095 --> 01:13:08,098
<b>I thought that you'd feel...</b>

664
01:13:10,517 --> 01:13:12,478
<b>He deserved it, didn't he?</b>

665
01:13:13,228 --> 01:13:14,897
<b>I don't think it's for us to say...</b>

666
01:13:15,105 --> 01:13:19,276
<b>...whether a person deserves
to live or die.</b>

667
01:13:19,693 --> 01:13:22,488
<b>But, Aunt May, he killed Uncle Ben.</b>

668
01:13:22,613 --> 01:13:25,115
<b>Uncle Ben meant the world to us.</b>

669
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:28,744
<b>But he wouldn't want us living
one second...</b>

670
01:13:28,869 --> 01:13:31,580
<b>...with revenge in our hearts.</b>

671
01:13:33,999 --> 01:13:36,460
<b>It's like a poison. It can...</b>

672
01:13:37,211 --> 01:13:39,296
<b>It can take you over.</b>

673
01:13:41,173 --> 01:13:46,387
<b>Before you know it,
turn us into something ugly.</b>

674
01:14:00,150 --> 01:14:02,945
<b>- He said it was a good idea.
- Yeah.</b>

675
01:14:47,906 --> 01:14:49,033
<b>Hello?</b>

676
01:14:49,158 --> 01:14:50,701
<b>Hey, Harry, it's M. J.</b>

677
01:14:50,826 --> 01:14:52,077
<b>Hi.</b>

678
01:14:52,202 --> 01:14:53,620
<b>I need some company.</b>

679
01:14:53,746 --> 01:14:56,248
<b>Are you doing anything?
Can I stop by?</b>

680
01:14:56,373 --> 01:14:58,417
<b>Yeah, sure, come on over.</b>

681
01:14:58,542 --> 01:15:00,919
<b>Okay. Are you sure it's okay?</b>

682
01:15:01,045 --> 01:15:03,630
<b>No, I'm not doing anything.
Please, come over.</b>

683
01:15:03,881 --> 01:15:06,550
<b>- Okay, I'll see you soon.
- Great.</b>

684
01:15:06,675 --> 01:15:08,135
<b>Bye.</b>

685
01:15:09,053 --> 01:15:11,346
<b>- Bernard.
- Yes, Mr. Osborn?</b>

686
01:15:11,472 --> 01:15:13,766
<b>We're having a guest.
Can you get some food?</b>

687
01:15:13,891 --> 01:15:16,060
<b>- A guest?
- Yeah, a guest.</b>

688
01:15:16,185 --> 01:15:19,688
<b>- A "guest" guest?
- Will you just get some food?</b>

689
01:15:19,813 --> 01:15:21,482
<b>Right away, sir.</b>

690
01:15:38,248 --> 01:15:41,293
<b>Hey, Mr. Ditkovitch.</b>

691
01:15:41,794 --> 01:15:44,713
<b>- An orange?
- No, thanks.</b>

692
01:15:44,838 --> 01:15:48,801
<b>Listen, I'm really sorry
for what happened earlier.</b>

693
01:15:48,801 --> 01:15:52,346
<b>I shouldn't have yelled about that door.
It was nothing to be angry about.</b>

694
01:15:52,429 --> 01:15:54,306
<b>It's no big deal.</b>

695
01:15:54,515 --> 01:15:58,686
<b>But if you feel that bad about it,
you can buy me pizza sometime.</b>

696
01:15:58,811 --> 01:16:01,939
<b>- Today's good.
- Okay.</b>

697
01:16:02,064 --> 01:16:04,858
<b>- Have problem with the phone?
- No, no. I was just...</b>

698
01:16:04,942 --> 01:16:07,027
<b>Well, I was trying
to figure out what to say.</b>

699
01:16:07,152 --> 01:16:10,989
<b>If it's a woman you're calling,
then you say:</b>

700
01:16:10,989 --> 01:16:14,535
<b>"You're a good woman.
I am good man."</b>

701
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:21,417
<b>- Hi, Pete.
- Hi.</b>

702
01:16:21,542 --> 01:16:22,793
<b>He's calling a woman.</b>

703
01:16:23,001 --> 01:16:24,878
<b>Mary Jane?
I think that would be so good...</b>

704
01:16:25,087 --> 01:16:29,133
<b>This is none of your business.
Go. Go. Call.</b>

705
01:16:30,718 --> 01:16:33,429
<b>- You should call.
- Thanks.</b>

706
01:16:35,806 --> 01:16:38,100
<b>- Bye.
- Bye.</b>

707
01:16:51,905 --> 01:16:53,032
<b>Hi.</b>

708
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:58,662
<b>- You hungry?
- Yeah.</b>

709
01:16:59,705 --> 01:17:01,165
<b>Come on.</b>

710
01:17:05,335 --> 01:17:07,713
<b>- I hope you like peppers.
- I love them.</b>

711
01:17:31,612 --> 01:17:33,489
<b>No. Please.</b>

712
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:46,835
<b>Oh, the butter.</b>

713
01:17:56,970 --> 01:17:58,597
<b>Beautiful.</b>

714
01:18:03,102 --> 01:18:04,853
<b>Check this out.</b>

715
01:18:11,944 --> 01:18:14,363
<b>Well, we can use that part.</b>

716
01:18:16,031 --> 01:18:18,117
<b>You've been dreaming.</b>

717
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:21,453
<b>Nothing like a little self-deception
to get you through the night.</b>

718
01:18:21,578 --> 01:18:24,456
<b>- All right.
- When did you write that?</b>

719
01:18:24,581 --> 01:18:27,501
<b>- Twelfth grade.
- It's intense.</b>

720
01:18:27,501 --> 01:18:31,338
<b>- So you want the part?
- I'd love to be in your play.</b>

721
01:18:31,463 --> 01:18:32,923
<b>It's yours.</b>

722
01:18:35,008 --> 01:18:38,554
<b>You know, there's not even a scar.</b>

723
01:18:40,014 --> 01:18:41,682
<b>Barely.</b>

724
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:00,659
<b>- Sorry.
- Me too.</b>

725
01:19:00,868 --> 01:19:05,039
<b>- I didn't mean to do that.
- No, it's okay. Please, forgive me.</b>

726
01:19:06,373 --> 01:19:08,042
<b>Mary Jane.</b>

727
01:19:08,792 --> 01:19:10,669
<b>Mary Jane.</b>

728
01:19:11,378 --> 01:19:14,214
<b>- Mary Jane, please.
- I'm sorry.</b>

729
01:19:14,506 --> 01:19:15,883
<b>Just...</b>

730
01:19:27,978 --> 01:19:31,523
<b>You've taken your eye off the ball.</b>

731
01:19:37,654 --> 01:19:39,114
<b>Harry.</b>

732
01:19:52,169 --> 01:19:53,420
<b>What have you done?</b>

733
01:19:56,131 --> 01:19:57,591
<b>Avenge me!</b>

734
01:20:00,844 --> 01:20:04,973
<b>- My father, he died, right?
- Yeah.</b>

735
01:20:05,015 --> 01:20:07,267
<b>Just wish I could remember
more about him.</b>

736
01:20:07,393 --> 01:20:10,521
<b>Well, he loved you.
That's the main thing.</b>

737
01:20:10,604 --> 01:20:13,857
<b>I swear on my father's grave,
Spider-Man will pay.</b>

738
01:20:14,608 --> 01:20:16,360
<b>Harry.</b>

739
01:20:18,028 --> 01:20:19,988
<b>Remember me?</b>

740
01:20:21,782 --> 01:20:24,910
<b>Yes, Father. I remember.</b>

741
01:20:24,910 --> 01:20:28,247
<b>I was right about her. About Peter.</b>

742
01:20:28,372 --> 01:20:30,624
<b>About everything.</b>

743
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,963
<b>You know what you must do.
Make him suffer.</b>

744
01:20:35,963 --> 01:20:38,340
<b>Make him wish he were dead.</b>

745
01:20:38,465 --> 01:20:42,511
<b>First, we attack his heart.</b>

746
01:20:52,521 --> 01:20:55,649
<b>Hi, it's me.
Sing your song at the beep.</b>

747
01:20:55,774 --> 01:20:58,694
<b>Hey, M. J. It's Peter.</b>

748
01:21:00,571 --> 01:21:03,490
<b>I wanna talk to you about last night.</b>

749
01:21:04,241 --> 01:21:06,410
<b>I don't know what I was thinking.</b>

750
01:21:06,535 --> 01:21:11,498
<b>I know you were just there
to help and I...</b>

751
01:21:11,498 --> 01:21:14,626
<b>I don't know. I wanna see you.</b>

752
01:21:19,048 --> 01:21:22,885
<b>If you want Peter to live,
you're gonna do something for me.</b>

753
01:21:27,056 --> 01:21:28,599
<b>- Yeah?
- It's Ursula.</b>

754
01:21:28,724 --> 01:21:30,476
<b>Come in.</b>

755
01:21:39,151 --> 01:21:40,903
<b>- Hi, Pete.
- Hi.</b>

756
01:21:41,028 --> 01:21:43,322
<b>There's a phone call for you.</b>

757
01:21:44,573 --> 01:21:46,241
<b>It's Mary Jane, she called back.</b>

758
01:21:46,533 --> 01:21:48,535
<b>- Really?
- Yeah.</b>

759
01:21:50,204 --> 01:21:55,834
<b>- I put the phone on top of the thing.
- Thanks. Okay.</b>

760
01:21:57,795 --> 01:21:59,380
<b>- Hey.
- Hi.</b>

761
01:21:59,588 --> 01:22:02,299
<b>Oh, I'm so glad you called.
I've been trying to...</b>

762
01:22:02,299 --> 01:22:05,219
<b>- Can you meet me?
- You bet.</b>

763
01:22:05,302 --> 01:22:07,805
<b>- Now?
- Okay. Where?</b>

764
01:22:07,930 --> 01:22:09,807
<b>At the bridge in the park.</b>

765
01:22:09,890 --> 01:22:11,266
<b>- On my way.
- Okay.</b>

766
01:22:11,475 --> 01:22:14,478
<b>Okay. Hey. I love you.</b>

767
01:22:33,789 --> 01:22:35,874
<b>You look beautiful.</b>

768
01:22:37,126 --> 01:22:38,669
<b>Peonies.</b>

769
01:22:41,088 --> 01:22:43,799
<b>- You okay?
- No.</b>

770
01:22:44,758 --> 01:22:46,802
<b>There's something
I have to tell you, Pete.</b>

771
01:22:47,344 --> 01:22:48,804
<b>Okay.</b>

772
01:22:50,055 --> 01:22:51,724
<b>It's not working.</b>

773
01:22:52,766 --> 01:22:54,435
<b>You and me.</b>

774
01:22:55,561 --> 01:22:56,937
<b>What?</b>

775
01:22:57,271 --> 01:22:59,648
<b>I don't wanna see you anymore.</b>

776
01:23:00,190 --> 01:23:02,026
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

777
01:23:02,151 --> 01:23:04,236
<b>I don't know.</b>

778
01:23:06,947 --> 01:23:08,699
<b>I'm lonely.</b>

779
01:23:09,950 --> 01:23:12,244
<b>You aren't there for me.</b>

780
01:23:13,287 --> 01:23:15,789
<b>I can't do this.</b>

781
01:23:15,914 --> 01:23:21,837
<b>- It's over.
- No. Please. Please don't say that.</b>

782
01:23:22,171 --> 01:23:25,090
<b>I know I've been selfish,
but I can do better. I can change.</b>

783
01:23:25,090 --> 01:23:28,927
<b>- It's not that simple.
- We love each other. I love you.</b>

784
01:23:29,053 --> 01:23:31,138
<b>We have problems.
When people have problems...</b>

785
01:23:31,347 --> 01:23:34,141
<b>...they work it out.
They talk to each other.</b>

786
01:23:39,146 --> 01:23:40,939
<b>Look, you see?</b>

787
01:23:41,982 --> 01:23:44,068
<b>You know what this is?</b>

788
01:23:45,319 --> 01:23:48,530
<b>- You know what I want for us?
- There's someone else.</b>

789
01:23:48,655 --> 01:23:51,575
<b>I've fallen in love
with someone else.</b>

790
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:14,723
<b>Bravo.</b>

791
01:24:24,733 --> 01:24:29,196
<b>She says that she's lonely,
that I'm not there for her.</b>

792
01:24:30,572 --> 01:24:32,866
<b>There's another guy.</b>

793
01:24:35,786 --> 01:24:37,663
<b>Well, how you holding up?</b>

794
01:24:38,288 --> 01:24:40,040
<b>Not good.</b>

795
01:24:42,126 --> 01:24:45,045
<b>Harry, I was gonna propose to her.</b>

796
01:24:45,587 --> 01:24:47,256
<b>Really?</b>

797
01:24:49,466 --> 01:24:53,512
<b>Well, she's been going through
a tough time lately. Career.</b>

798
01:24:53,512 --> 01:24:56,432
<b>I mean, a singing waitress
at a jazz club?</b>

799
01:24:56,515 --> 01:24:59,643
<b>It's not exactly
what she had in mind for herself.</b>

800
01:24:59,768 --> 01:25:02,896
<b>Singing waitress? What are you...?
What are you talking about?</b>

801
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:07,568
<b>Well, she was fired from the show.
Didn't she tell you?</b>

802
01:25:07,901 --> 01:25:09,236
<b>She was fired?</b>

803
01:25:10,904 --> 01:25:16,243
<b>She was fired and she told you?
She didn't tell me?</b>

804
01:25:17,703 --> 01:25:20,205
<b>Well, that's why
I asked you here, Pete.</b>

805
01:25:21,457 --> 01:25:23,542
<b>I'm the other guy.</b>

806
01:25:25,335 --> 01:25:27,087
<b>What?</b>

807
01:25:27,212 --> 01:25:30,215
<b>Look, she came to me
one afternoon, troubled.</b>

808
01:25:30,340 --> 01:25:33,344
<b>She needed someone
and I was there for her.</b>

809
01:25:34,178 --> 01:25:37,306
<b>I've always loved her, Pete.
You know that.</b>

810
01:25:37,431 --> 01:25:39,183
<b>It just...</b>

811
01:25:39,391 --> 01:25:41,477
<b>...started.</b>

812
01:25:48,776 --> 01:25:52,112
<b>I don't believe this.
I don't... I don't believe you.</b>

813
01:25:52,237 --> 01:25:54,615
<b>Look, I'm really sorry.</b>

814
01:25:56,075 --> 01:25:58,452
<b>I just thought you should know.</b>

815
01:26:06,627 --> 01:26:10,130
<b>- Can I warm you up?
- Yes, please.</b>

816
01:26:11,715 --> 01:26:13,175
<b>How's the pie?</b>

817
01:26:14,218 --> 01:26:15,886
<b>So good.</b>

818
01:27:19,199 --> 01:27:21,035
<b>Would you like a drink?</b>

819
01:27:23,871 --> 01:27:26,373
<b>I'm sorry. What was I thinking?</b>

820
01:27:26,582 --> 01:27:29,293
<b>Bad for the public image, right,
Mr. Key-to-the-City?</b>

821
01:27:29,293 --> 01:27:30,544
<b>What did you do to her?</b>

822
01:27:32,713 --> 01:27:35,549
<b>I did what you failed to do.
I was there for her.</b>

823
01:27:36,383 --> 01:27:38,469
<b>Mary Jane and I,
we understand each other.</b>

824
01:27:38,594 --> 01:27:43,766
<b>- She doesn't know what you are.
- Peter, she knows me very well.</b>

825
01:27:43,807 --> 01:27:48,062
<b>And when she kissed me,
it was just like she used to kiss me.</b>

826
01:27:48,395 --> 01:27:50,147
<b>That taste...</b>

827
01:27:51,815 --> 01:27:53,067
<b>Strawberries.</b>

828
01:28:28,727 --> 01:28:30,270
<b>How'd you like that, Spidey?</b>

829
01:28:34,149 --> 01:28:35,401
<b>That all you got?</b>

830
01:28:42,700 --> 01:28:45,285
<b>- Stings, doesn't it?
- I protected you in high school.</b>

831
01:28:45,411 --> 01:28:47,705
<b>Now I'm gonna kick your little ass.</b>

832
01:29:34,918 --> 01:29:36,920
<b>Gonna kill me
like you killed my father?</b>

833
01:29:37,004 --> 01:29:39,214
<b>I'm done trying to convince you.</b>

834
01:29:40,049 --> 01:29:43,594
<b>You took him from me. He loved me.</b>

835
01:29:43,594 --> 01:29:47,639
<b>No. He despised you.</b>

836
01:29:47,765 --> 01:29:50,059
<b>You were an embarrassment to him.</b>

837
01:29:53,687 --> 01:29:57,649
<b>Look at little Goblin Junior.
Gonna cry?</b>

838
01:30:34,353 --> 01:30:36,647
<b>Spider-Man used to
make me feel safe.</b>

839
01:30:36,772 --> 01:30:38,857
<b>Now I'm afraid
to walk home from work.</b>

840
01:30:38,857 --> 01:30:42,611
<b>- My son thought the world of this guy.
- I have a daughter, loves Spider-Man.</b>

841
01:30:42,820 --> 01:30:46,156
<b>- Who's she to look up to?
- This is the guy they gave the key to?</b>

842
01:30:47,324 --> 01:30:50,202
<b>I'm gonna put some dirt in your eye.</b>

843
01:30:52,204 --> 01:30:55,416
<b>- Cheers to the new staff photographer.
- Hey, I just got lucky.</b>

844
01:30:55,541 --> 01:30:57,209
<b>This is so wonderful for you.</b>

845
01:30:57,418 --> 01:31:01,171
<b>Well, you might wanna tell J. J.
To make a little more wall space.</b>

846
01:31:06,176 --> 01:31:09,722
<b>Wow, good morning.
It's a beautiful day, huh?</b>

847
01:31:09,722 --> 01:31:12,307
<b>What was it you said?
I'll never get that picture?</b>

848
01:31:13,058 --> 01:31:14,810
<b>There's your hero.</b>

849
01:31:16,270 --> 01:31:19,940
<b>- I never thought he'd really do that.
- See? Right there.</b>

850
01:31:19,940 --> 01:31:22,651
<b>You made a judgment call.
You gotta see it as it is.</b>

851
01:31:22,776 --> 01:31:24,111
<b>Funny you should say that...</b>

852
01:31:24,319 --> 01:31:28,699
<b>...because I was looking through
some old photos and it looks very...</b>

853
01:31:28,699 --> 01:31:30,576
<b>...similar.</b>

854
01:31:31,702 --> 01:31:34,747
<b>Okay. Well, I gotta get back to work.</b>

855
01:31:35,789 --> 01:31:38,917
<b>- You're trash, Brock.
- Excuse me?</b>

856
01:31:39,043 --> 01:31:41,003
<b>Your picture's a fake.</b>

857
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:46,091
<b>Oh, Parker,
you are such a boy scout.</b>

858
01:31:46,216 --> 01:31:48,302
<b>When are you gonna
give a guy a break?</b>

859
01:31:50,304 --> 01:31:52,556
<b>You want forgiveness? Get religion.</b>

860
01:31:52,681 --> 01:31:56,310
<b>- What's going on here?
- Are you guys all right?</b>

861
01:31:59,355 --> 01:32:03,108
<b>Yeah. No, we...
We're just horsing around.</b>

862
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:07,571
<b>Look, I'm begging you.
If you do this, I will lose everything.</b>

863
01:32:07,571 --> 01:32:09,865
<b>There's not a paper in town
that will hire me.</b>

864
01:32:09,990 --> 01:32:12,368
<b>You should've
thought of that earlier.</b>

865
01:32:13,118 --> 01:32:15,412
<b>What are you doing, Peter?</b>

866
01:32:15,496 --> 01:32:19,875
<b>Show this to your editor.
Tell him to check his source next time.</b>

867
01:32:25,923 --> 01:32:27,508
<b>It's a fake.</b>

868
01:32:27,591 --> 01:32:31,762
<b>Empire State
Photographic Department confirms it.</b>

869
01:32:35,224 --> 01:32:37,184
<b>Pack your things.
Get out of my building.</b>

870
01:32:37,601 --> 01:32:39,812
<b>- I was just trying...
- You're fired.</b>

871
01:32:41,271 --> 01:32:43,649
<b>We're gonna have to
print a retraction now.</b>

872
01:32:43,774 --> 01:32:45,859
<b>I haven't printed a retraction
in 20 years.</b>

873
01:32:52,116 --> 01:32:54,702
<b>- Hello.
- Mr. Parker, Dr. Connors here.</b>

874
01:32:54,952 --> 01:32:59,206
<b>Oh, Dr. Connors. How are you?</b>

875
01:32:59,206 --> 01:33:02,418
<b>Quite a specimen
you left me, Parker.</b>

876
01:33:02,751 --> 01:33:07,548
<b>Its chemistry is not unlike
the chondritic meteorites of the '70s.</b>

877
01:33:07,548 --> 01:33:08,590
<b>Thanks.</b>

878
01:33:08,799 --> 01:33:11,385
<b>- That's good.
- You know what, Parker?</b>

879
01:33:13,303 --> 01:33:16,181
<b>- Parker?
- Get me some milk.</b>

880
01:33:16,932 --> 01:33:20,477
<b>It amplifies characteristics
of its host.</b>

881
01:33:20,561 --> 01:33:24,440
<b>- Hey, give me another cookie.
- Especially aggression.</b>

882
01:33:25,399 --> 01:33:27,234
<b>This could be dangerous.</b>

883
01:33:27,359 --> 01:33:31,113
<b>Peter, you didn't keep any, did you?</b>

884
01:33:31,113 --> 01:33:34,950
<b>- You got any with nuts?
- I have some nuts. I could make some.</b>

885
01:33:34,992 --> 01:33:36,618
<b>- Go make me some.
- Peter?</b>

886
01:33:36,744 --> 01:33:39,455
<b>No, no, no. Course not.</b>

887
01:33:53,844 --> 01:33:55,721
<b>These shots are so good.</b>

888
01:33:55,846 --> 01:33:58,432
<b>I'd love to shoot you sometime.</b>

889
01:33:58,849 --> 01:34:02,269
<b>Peter Parker. Peter.</b>

890
01:34:02,394 --> 01:34:06,857
<b>Parker. Miss Brant, that's not
the position I hired you for.</b>

891
01:34:06,857 --> 01:34:08,442
<b>Black-suit Spider-Man.</b>

892
01:34:09,902 --> 01:34:12,071
<b>Peter, these are incredible.</b>

893
01:34:12,196 --> 01:34:15,199
<b>- We gotta have these, Jonah.
- I'll pay you the usual rate.</b>

894
01:34:17,117 --> 01:34:19,787
<b>If you want the shots,
I'll take the staff job...</b>

895
01:34:19,912 --> 01:34:21,789
<b>...double the money.</b>

896
01:35:46,790 --> 01:35:48,208
<b>Penny.</b>

897
01:35:54,298 --> 01:35:56,967
<b>You are really gonna dig this joint.</b>

898
01:35:58,344 --> 01:36:00,429
<b>Do you think I'm...?
I'm dressed all right?</b>

899
01:36:00,554 --> 01:36:02,097
<b>Too fancy or too...</b>

900
01:36:02,222 --> 01:36:06,352
<b>Are you kidding me?
You're looking fine, babe.</b>

901
01:36:06,393 --> 01:36:10,230
<b>- Thank you.
- Love that little giggle.</b>

902
01:36:12,941 --> 01:36:14,818
<b>Hey, keep it open there, pops.</b>

903
01:36:18,155 --> 01:36:21,700
<b>Oh, this is so cool.</b>

904
01:36:21,825 --> 01:36:24,495
<b>I have never been
to a jazz club before.</b>

905
01:36:27,331 --> 01:36:30,667
<b>Oh, I hope we can get a table.</b>

906
01:36:35,339 --> 01:36:37,841
<b>Find us some shade.</b>

907
01:36:38,926 --> 01:36:41,095
<b>Thanks, hot legs.</b>

908
01:36:41,428 --> 01:36:44,014
<b>Right this way, sir.</b>

909
01:36:51,438 --> 01:36:53,482
<b>Oh, why, thank you.</b>

910
01:36:58,696 --> 01:37:02,783
<b>- I am so loving this.
- Oh, me too.</b>

911
01:37:08,205 --> 01:37:11,750
<b>- Isn't that your old girlfriend?
- Yeah.</b>

912
01:37:11,750 --> 01:37:16,338
<b>- Do you wanna go someplace else?
- Oh, no, no. I'll... I'll be okay.</b>

913
01:37:16,338 --> 01:37:19,258
<b>- Mary Jane, show us what you got.
- I'll take that.</b>

914
01:37:24,888 --> 01:37:28,100
<b>- I'll be right back.
- All right.</b>

915
01:37:37,067 --> 01:37:38,235
<b>Peter?</b>

916
01:37:41,238 --> 01:37:43,323
<b>This is for you.</b>

917
01:37:48,871 --> 01:37:50,539
<b>Double-time.</b>

918
01:37:55,753 --> 01:37:57,421
<b>Thanks.</b>

919
01:38:24,114 --> 01:38:25,991
<b>Now dig on this.</b>

920
01:38:27,242 --> 01:38:28,369
<b>That is hot.</b>

921
01:39:09,576 --> 01:39:11,328
<b>That was all for her?</b>

922
01:39:20,004 --> 01:39:21,547
<b>I'm so sorry.</b>

923
01:39:33,976 --> 01:39:36,478
<b>- You all right, Mary Jane?
- I'm fine.</b>

924
01:39:36,603 --> 01:39:38,022
<b>Okay.</b>

925
01:39:40,941 --> 01:39:42,401
<b>Hey.</b>

926
01:39:44,611 --> 01:39:45,946
<b>What's wrong with you?</b>

927
01:39:47,114 --> 01:39:48,574
<b>You.</b>

928
01:39:49,116 --> 01:39:52,202
<b>- Can I help you, sir?
- No.</b>

929
01:39:52,327 --> 01:39:54,413
<b>Is everything okay here, Paul?</b>

930
01:39:54,621 --> 01:39:56,915
<b>Yeah, is everything okay here, Paul?</b>

931
01:39:56,915 --> 01:39:59,418
<b>- Take him out of here.
- Let's go, sir.</b>

932
01:39:59,543 --> 01:40:02,421
<b>- Take your hand off of me.
- Now.</b>

933
01:40:02,546 --> 01:40:06,091
<b>- Okay.
- Hey, get off. Let go.</b>

934
01:40:08,469 --> 01:40:10,137
<b>Peter, stop it!</b>

935
01:40:21,732 --> 01:40:23,192
<b>Who are you?</b>

936
01:40:25,569 --> 01:40:27,237
<b>I don't know.</b>

937
01:41:59,830 --> 01:42:01,707
<b>It's Brock, sir.</b>

938
01:42:01,832 --> 01:42:04,418
<b>Edward Brock Jr.</b>

939
01:42:06,086 --> 01:42:08,797
<b>I come before you today...</b>

940
01:42:10,174 --> 01:42:11,842
<b>...humbled...</b>

941
01:42:13,719 --> 01:42:15,804
<b>...and humiliated...</b>

942
01:42:18,724 --> 01:42:21,018
<b>...to ask you for one thing.</b>

943
01:42:26,523 --> 01:42:28,400
<b>I want you to kill Peter Parker.</b>

944
01:43:19,410 --> 01:43:20,452
<b>Parker.</b>

945
01:45:04,515 --> 01:45:06,809
<b>- Hi, Peter.
- Hi.</b>

946
01:45:09,311 --> 01:45:13,691
<b>You don't seem to have changed
the room around very much.</b>

947
01:45:14,108 --> 01:45:18,487
<b>Of course, there's not much
you could do, is there?</b>

948
01:45:24,535 --> 01:45:26,829
<b>When we spoke on the phone...</b>

949
01:45:26,954 --> 01:45:29,415
<b>...I sensed that something
was bothering you...</b>

950
01:45:30,165 --> 01:45:33,585
<b>...so I thought I'd just come by.</b>

951
01:45:35,796 --> 01:45:38,382
<b>How's Mary Jane?</b>

952
01:45:38,716 --> 01:45:40,384
<b>I don't know.</b>

953
01:45:42,803 --> 01:45:45,389
<b>I never heard from you.</b>

954
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:48,100
<b>Did you ever propose?</b>

955
01:45:51,979 --> 01:45:53,731
<b>You said...</b>

956
01:45:54,648 --> 01:45:58,193
<b>...a husband's gotta put a wife
before himself.</b>

957
01:46:03,323 --> 01:46:05,409
<b>I'm not ready.</b>

958
01:46:07,494 --> 01:46:09,788
<b>But what happened?</b>

959
01:46:10,497 --> 01:46:13,125
<b>You seemed so sure.</b>

960
01:46:14,376 --> 01:46:15,919
<b>Yeah.</b>

961
01:46:17,296 --> 01:46:18,964
<b>I...</b>

962
01:46:29,266 --> 01:46:31,685
<b>I hurt her, Aunt May.</b>

963
01:46:32,936 --> 01:46:35,022
<b>I don't know what to do.</b>

964
01:46:36,899 --> 01:46:40,652
<b>Well, you start
by doing the hardest thing:</b>

965
01:46:41,362 --> 01:46:44,490
<b>You forgive yourself.</b>

966
01:46:47,534 --> 01:46:50,037
<b>I believe in you, Peter.</b>

967
01:46:50,245 --> 01:46:53,165
<b>You're a good person.</b>

968
01:46:54,124 --> 01:46:59,088
<b>And I know you will find a way
to put it right.</b>

969
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:08,597
<b>In time.</b>

970
01:47:26,657 --> 01:47:29,034
<b>End of the line, Spider-Man.</b>

971
01:47:33,080 --> 01:47:35,499
<b>I want him dead too, Flint.</b>

972
01:47:35,916 --> 01:47:38,210
<b>That's why
I've been looking for you.</b>

973
01:47:38,335 --> 01:47:41,755
<b>Oh, yeah. I know all about you.</b>

974
01:47:41,839 --> 01:47:46,218
<b>Like the fact that Spider-Man
won't let you help your poor daughter.</b>

975
01:47:46,260 --> 01:47:49,555
<b>It's just...
That doesn't seem right to me.</b>

976
01:47:49,680 --> 01:47:54,893
<b>Look, I wanna kill the spider,
you wanna kill the spider.</b>

977
01:47:54,893 --> 01:47:58,230
<b>Together, he doesn't stand a chance.</b>

978
01:47:59,189 --> 01:48:01,233
<b>Interested?</b>

979
01:48:02,526 --> 01:48:04,069
<b>Yeah.</b>

980
01:49:06,006 --> 01:49:06,924
<b>So...</b>

981
01:49:08,509 --> 01:49:09,760
<b>...where to?</b>

982
01:49:10,928 --> 01:49:12,680
<b>All New York is holding its breath...</b>

983
01:49:12,888 --> 01:49:15,599
<b>... as the hostage crisis
continues to unfold.</b>

984
01:49:17,267 --> 01:49:18,519
<b>Just 30 minutes ago...</b>

985
01:49:18,602 --> 01:49:20,813
<b>... police came across
this startling sight:</b>

986
01:49:20,938 --> 01:49:23,107
<b>A young woman,
held hostage in a taxi...</b>

987
01:49:23,315 --> 01:49:25,609
<b>... suspended 80 stories
above the ground...</b>

988
01:49:25,609 --> 01:49:28,612
<b>... in what appears to be
a giant web.</b>

989
01:49:28,737 --> 01:49:31,448
<b>Every attempt by the police
to rescue the hostage...</b>

990
01:49:31,532 --> 01:49:33,325
<b>... has been thwarted
by the Sandman.</b>

991
01:49:36,787 --> 01:49:38,122
<b>Compounding the danger...</b>

992
01:49:38,205 --> 01:49:41,125
<b>... is the appearance
of a strange black-suited figure.</b>

993
01:49:41,250 --> 01:49:45,087
<b>Early reports had believed him
to be the black-suited Spider-Man...</b>

994
01:49:45,129 --> 01:49:48,757
<b>... but he has now been identified
as something entirely different.</b>

995
01:49:50,300 --> 01:49:53,971
<b>The hostage has been identified
as Mary Jane Watson...</b>

996
01:49:54,054 --> 01:49:58,225
<b>... an actress recently seen
in a brief stint on Broadway.</b>

997
01:50:23,792 --> 01:50:26,170
<b>We're now going to take you
live to the scene...</b>

998
01:50:26,295 --> 01:50:28,172
<b>... with Jennifer Dugan. Jennifer?</b>

999
01:50:28,255 --> 01:50:30,883
<b>We're only about
100 feet away now, Hal, and...</b>

1000
01:50:30,883 --> 01:50:34,845
<b>Wait. There seems to be
some kind of activity in the web.</b>

1001
01:50:34,928 --> 01:50:38,599
<b>They seem to be creating
some kind of gigantic lettering.</b>

1002
01:50:41,518 --> 01:50:44,313
<b>Spider-Man's being challenged
to some sort of confrontation.</b>

1003
01:50:44,438 --> 01:50:46,190
<b>And that raises serious questions...</b>

1004
01:50:46,315 --> 01:50:49,526
<b>... about what kind of chance he'd
stand against such overwhelming...</b>

1005
01:51:00,079 --> 01:51:01,330
<b>Harry?</b>

1006
01:51:04,875 --> 01:51:06,960
<b>I need your help.</b>

1007
01:51:07,378 --> 01:51:10,798
<b>I can't take them both,
not by myself.</b>

1008
01:51:17,304 --> 01:51:20,182
<b>You don't deserve my help.</b>

1009
01:51:22,893 --> 01:51:24,353
<b>Harry...</b>

1010
01:51:25,104 --> 01:51:27,189
<b>...she needs us.</b>

1011
01:51:31,777 --> 01:51:33,320
<b>Get out.</b>

1012
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:52,214
<b>If I may, sir?</b>

1013
01:51:52,923 --> 01:51:58,554
<b>I've seen things in this house
I've never spoken of.</b>

1014
01:51:58,887 --> 01:52:00,556
<b>What are you trying to tell me?</b>

1015
01:52:01,265 --> 01:52:04,101
<b>The night your father died...</b>

1016
01:52:04,184 --> 01:52:06,812
<b>...I cleaned his wound.</b>

1017
01:52:08,272 --> 01:52:12,026
<b>The blade that pierced his body...</b>

1018
01:52:12,026 --> 01:52:14,820
<b>...came from his glider.</b>

1019
01:52:15,571 --> 01:52:20,576
<b>I know you're trying to defend
your father's honor...</b>

1020
01:52:20,576 --> 01:52:25,998
<b>...but there's no question
that he died by his own hand.</b>

1021
01:52:29,043 --> 01:52:31,503
<b>I loved your father...</b>

1022
01:52:32,671 --> 01:52:35,799
<b>...as I have loved you, Harry.</b>

1023
01:52:36,300 --> 01:52:39,219
<b>As your friends love you.</b>

1024
01:53:26,266 --> 01:53:27,518
<b>Look.</b>

1025
01:53:48,372 --> 01:53:52,001
<b>Spider-Man! Spider-Man!
Spider-Man!</b>

1026
01:53:57,464 --> 01:53:59,425
<b>He seems to have
come out of nowhere...</b>

1027
01:53:59,550 --> 01:54:01,593
<b>.... to answer the prayers of the city...</b>

1028
01:54:01,719 --> 01:54:03,804
<b>...just when all hope
seemed to be lost.</b>

1029
01:54:09,727 --> 01:54:12,646
<b>Peter. They're gonna kill us both.</b>

1030
01:54:12,771 --> 01:54:16,400
<b>- I'm gonna get you out of this.
- Watch out.</b>

1031
01:54:25,701 --> 01:54:27,161
<b>Hey, Parker.</b>

1032
01:54:27,369 --> 01:54:28,620
<b>My God. Eddie.</b>

1033
01:54:29,246 --> 01:54:30,998
<b>My spider-sense is tingling...</b>

1034
01:54:32,583 --> 01:54:35,377
<b>...if you know what I'm talking about.</b>

1035
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:56,357
<b>We can find a way to settle this.</b>

1036
01:54:56,565 --> 01:54:58,025
<b>You're so right.</b>

1037
01:54:58,108 --> 01:55:01,653
<b>I'm thinking humiliation.</b>

1038
01:55:02,279 --> 01:55:04,698
<b>Kind of like how you humiliated me.</b>

1039
01:55:05,532 --> 01:55:07,284
<b>Do you remember?</b>

1040
01:55:09,078 --> 01:55:11,997
<b>Do you remember
what you did to me?</b>

1041
01:55:27,304 --> 01:55:31,058
<b>You made me lose my girl.
Now I'm gonna make you lose yours.</b>

1042
01:55:32,851 --> 01:55:34,812
<b>How's that sound, tiger?</b>

1043
01:56:34,705 --> 01:56:36,332
<b>Hold on, Mary Jane!</b>

1044
01:57:06,487 --> 01:57:08,989
<b>Mary Jane!</b>

1045
01:58:09,258 --> 01:58:13,220
<b>It's hard to believe
what's happening.</b>

1046
01:58:13,220 --> 01:58:15,597
<b>The brutality of it.</b>

1047
01:58:16,348 --> 01:58:18,225
<b>I don't know how
he can take any more.</b>

1048
01:58:18,308 --> 01:58:21,979
<b>This could be a tragic day
for the people of New York.</b>

1049
01:58:21,979 --> 01:58:24,064
<b>It could be the end of Spider-Man.</b>

1050
01:58:50,424 --> 01:58:52,718
<b>- Awesome.
- Wicked cool.</b>

1051
01:59:17,659 --> 01:59:19,119
<b>You came.</b>

1052
01:59:27,044 --> 01:59:29,129
<b>Looks like just in the nick of time.</b>

1053
01:59:29,338 --> 01:59:31,924
<b>A couple minutes ago
wouldn't have been so bad either.</b>

1054
01:59:32,049 --> 01:59:33,509
<b>What are you gonna do?</b>

1055
01:59:37,054 --> 01:59:39,139
<b>I may need some help over here.</b>

1056
01:59:39,223 --> 01:59:41,725
<b>I'm a little busy right now.</b>

1057
01:59:42,685 --> 01:59:44,561
<b>Give me your hand.</b>

1058
01:59:58,951 --> 02:00:01,954
<b>Parker! Parker, where...?</b>

1059
02:00:02,079 --> 02:00:03,539
<b>I need a photographer.</b>

1060
02:00:03,747 --> 02:00:05,082
<b>Hey, kid, you want a job?</b>

1061
02:00:05,207 --> 02:00:08,627
<b>Why would I want a job?
I'm just a kid.</b>

1062
02:00:08,752 --> 02:00:11,755
<b>- All right, how much for the camera?
- One hundred bucks.</b>

1063
02:00:11,880 --> 02:00:13,340
<b>A hundred bucks?</b>

1064
02:00:15,092 --> 02:00:18,971
<b>All right, you little crook. Here.</b>

1065
02:00:20,639 --> 02:00:21,974
<b>What the...?</b>

1066
02:00:23,851 --> 02:00:25,519
<b>Film's extra.</b>

1067
02:00:31,358 --> 02:00:33,152
<b>Gotcha.</b>

1068
02:00:41,201 --> 02:00:42,411
<b>Pete, up top.</b>

1069
02:01:02,348 --> 02:01:04,433
<b>Mary Jane.</b>

1070
02:01:06,518 --> 02:01:08,395
<b>- This thing got any more?
- Hang on.</b>

1071
02:01:08,479 --> 02:01:09,646
<b>To what?</b>

1072
02:01:14,151 --> 02:01:15,903
<b>- Go, buddy.
- Got her.</b>

1073
02:01:27,164 --> 02:01:28,207
<b>You okay?</b>

1074
02:01:30,417 --> 02:01:31,960
<b>Yeah.</b>

1075
02:01:34,672 --> 02:01:37,174
<b>- Good.
- Hey, Pete.</b>

1076
02:01:39,468 --> 02:01:41,136
<b>Am I interrupting?</b>

1077
02:02:57,463 --> 02:02:59,340
<b>Never wound...</b>

1078
02:03:00,090 --> 02:03:02,134
<b>...what you can't kill.</b>

1079
02:03:05,929 --> 02:03:09,558
<b>Eddie, the suit,
you gotta take it off.</b>

1080
02:03:09,558 --> 02:03:11,310
<b>Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?</b>

1081
02:03:14,271 --> 02:03:16,106
<b>I know what it feels like.</b>

1082
02:03:16,648 --> 02:03:18,317
<b>It feels good.</b>

1083
02:03:18,442 --> 02:03:21,028
<b>The power. Everything.</b>

1084
02:03:21,028 --> 02:03:23,739
<b>But you'll lose yourself.</b>

1085
02:03:24,156 --> 02:03:26,033
<b>Let it go.</b>

1086
02:03:26,241 --> 02:03:28,327
<b>I like being bad.</b>

1087
02:03:29,370 --> 02:03:31,246
<b>It makes me happy.</b>

1088
02:04:20,671 --> 02:04:21,714
<b>Harry!</b>

1089
02:05:34,828 --> 02:05:37,206
<b>Peter. What are you doing?</b>

1090
02:05:38,040 --> 02:05:39,917
<b>No!</b>

1091
02:05:41,669 --> 02:05:42,711
<b>Eddie!</b>

1092
02:06:02,231 --> 02:06:04,108
<b>- Harry.
- Mary Jane.</b>

1093
02:06:04,316 --> 02:06:06,193
<b>- I'm gonna get help.
- No.</b>

1094
02:06:07,027 --> 02:06:08,487
<b>Stay.</b>

1095
02:06:17,246 --> 02:06:18,914
<b>I didn't want this.</b>

1096
02:06:23,711 --> 02:06:26,005
<b>But I had no choice.</b>

1097
02:06:29,633 --> 02:06:31,719
<b>We always have a choice.</b>

1098
02:06:31,844 --> 02:06:34,138
<b>You had a choice
when you killed my uncle.</b>

1099
02:06:36,640 --> 02:06:38,726
<b>My daughter was dying.</b>

1100
02:06:40,811 --> 02:06:42,771
<b>I needed money.</b>

1101
02:06:47,484 --> 02:06:49,445
<b>I was scared.</b>

1102
02:06:56,994 --> 02:07:00,080
<b>I told your uncle
all I wanted was the car.</b>

1103
02:07:00,205 --> 02:07:02,166
<b>- What is it?
- I need your car.</b>

1104
02:07:02,708 --> 02:07:05,210
<b>He said to me:</b>

1105
02:07:05,336 --> 02:07:08,213
<b>"Why don't you just put down the gun
and go home?"</b>

1106
02:07:12,176 --> 02:07:15,220
<b>I realize now
he was just trying to help me.</b>

1107
02:07:21,894 --> 02:07:25,022
<b>Then I saw my partner
running over with the cash.</b>

1108
02:07:25,022 --> 02:07:27,524
<b>And the gun was in my hand.</b>

1109
02:07:37,868 --> 02:07:39,286
<b>Get in.</b>

1110
02:07:41,205 --> 02:07:43,582
<b>Did a terrible thing to you...</b>

1111
02:07:44,833 --> 02:07:48,379
<b>... and I spent a lot of nights
wishing I could take it back.</b>

1112
02:07:53,592 --> 02:07:56,178
<b>I'm not asking you to forgive me.</b>

1113
02:07:57,054 --> 02:07:59,431
<b>I just want you to understand.</b>

1114
02:08:09,233 --> 02:08:11,944
<b>I've done terrible things too.</b>

1115
02:08:28,210 --> 02:08:31,005
<b>I didn't choose to be this.</b>

1116
02:08:39,680 --> 02:08:42,182
<b>The only thing left of me now...</b>

1117
02:08:44,268 --> 02:08:46,228
<b>...is my daughter.</b>

1118
02:08:58,449 --> 02:09:00,534
<b>I forgive you.</b>

1119
02:09:43,827 --> 02:09:46,830
<b>Hey, pal. How you doing?</b>

1120
02:09:46,830 --> 02:09:48,499
<b>Been better.</b>

1121
02:09:50,084 --> 02:09:52,044
<b>We'll get you through this.</b>

1122
02:09:55,673 --> 02:09:57,257
<b>No.</b>

1123
02:10:04,848 --> 02:10:07,059
<b>I should never have hurt you...</b>

1124
02:10:08,936 --> 02:10:11,230
<b>...said those things.</b>

1125
02:10:12,898 --> 02:10:15,484
<b>None of that matters, Peter.</b>

1126
02:10:17,486 --> 02:10:19,363
<b>You're my friend.</b>

1127
02:10:23,951 --> 02:10:25,828
<b>Best friend.</b>

1128
02:10:44,722 --> 02:10:46,348
<b>Harry.</b>

1129
02:11:32,353 --> 02:11:34,521
<b>Whatever comes our way...</b>

1130
02:11:35,606 --> 02:11:39,943
<b>... whatever battle we have raging
inside us, we always have a choice.</b>

1131
02:11:41,862 --> 02:11:44,031
<b>My friend Harry taught me that.</b>

1132
02:11:44,239 --> 02:11:47,576
<b>He chose to be the best of himself.</b>

1133
02:11:48,202 --> 02:11:51,330
<b>It's the choices
that make us who we are...</b>

1134
02:11:51,455 --> 02:11:54,958
<b>... and we can always choose
to do what's right.</b>
