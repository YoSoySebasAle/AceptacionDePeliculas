1
00:00:31,652 --> 00:00:34,034
You ready?Are you ready?

2
00:00:37,485 --> 00:00:39,142
Seat belts.

3
00:00:47,702 --> 00:00:50,119
Okay. Wait,
there's just...
I forgot. There's one...

4
00:00:54,502 --> 00:00:56,159
All right,
here we go.

5
00:02:37,812 --> 00:02:39,159
Hey.

6
00:02:40,436 --> 00:02:42,231
No, it's just
for the weekend.

7
00:02:44,647 --> 00:02:45,820
Well,
you can tell her

8
00:02:45,855 --> 00:02:47,339
I'm gonna fly down
in two weeks, so...

9
00:02:49,307 --> 00:02:51,171
Okay.

10
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:53,034
Okay, I'm thinking
about it.

11
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:54,346
Is that
your brother?

12
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,384
Hey, Doug.

13
00:02:59,075 --> 00:03:00,352
He says, "Hi."

14
00:03:01,595 --> 00:03:03,528
No, I've gotta go.

15
00:03:03,562 --> 00:03:04,770
I love you. Bye.

16
00:03:10,086 --> 00:03:12,364
Is everything
all right?

17
00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:13,952
No more phone calls.
All right?

18
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:16,748
For the rest of the weekend,
I'm all yours.

19
00:03:19,785 --> 00:03:20,959
How's your mom?

20
00:03:22,374 --> 00:03:23,479
She is...

21
00:03:24,963 --> 00:03:27,931
You know,
it's not good change.

22
00:03:27,966 --> 00:03:29,968
So, I don't really know.

23
00:03:33,661 --> 00:03:35,732
It feels so good
to get out of the city.

24
00:03:38,356 --> 00:03:41,221
I'm excited.I am too.

25
00:04:26,162 --> 00:04:28,371
This whole thing's
the driveway?

26
00:04:53,431 --> 00:04:55,329
This is it?

27
00:04:55,364 --> 00:04:56,537
Yeah. Why?

28
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,782
I just...
I can't believe
you've been,

29
00:04:59,816 --> 00:05:02,336
withholding this
from me,
it's ridiculous.

30
00:05:02,371 --> 00:05:04,062
I haven't been
withholding anything.

31
00:05:07,203 --> 00:05:09,619
What a mess.

32
00:05:09,654 --> 00:05:12,484
I thought you said,
it was a cabin.

33
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:14,037
It's just a house.

34
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,489
My parents,
got it cheap, you know.

35
00:05:17,524 --> 00:05:20,078
Stuff wasn't that
expensive around
here back then.

36
00:05:39,269 --> 00:05:41,651
Hey,
did you get the stuff
we have to refrigerate?

37
00:05:41,686 --> 00:05:43,860
By that you mean,
the soy yogurt?

38
00:05:43,895 --> 00:05:47,830
Yes, sir, though it's
not exactly known for
its spoiling properties.

39
00:05:50,764 --> 00:05:52,386
I'm just gonna run to
the bathroom real quick.

40
00:06:15,133 --> 00:06:17,135
Shit,
I forgot my birth control.

41
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:19,379
I know, I packed it
in your bag for you.

42
00:06:32,253 --> 00:06:34,566
Does your dad
take care of this place
by himself?

43
00:06:35,671 --> 00:06:37,535
No, my mom used to
do most of it, but...

44
00:06:38,984 --> 00:06:40,814
Then my dad
took the house,
and now I think

45
00:06:40,848 --> 00:06:44,404
he gets gardening help
from local high school
kids or whatever.

46
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,546
Come here.

47
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,651
Where are we going?Just come here.

48
00:06:56,761 --> 00:06:58,383
What?

49
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:02,007
They're supposed
to be boobs?

50
00:07:02,042 --> 00:07:03,561
Yeah. Yeah.

51
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,358
It's pretty weird.

52
00:07:08,393 --> 00:07:10,153
Kids do weird things.

53
00:07:10,188 --> 00:07:12,880
What do you think
about our kids
running around up here?

54
00:07:12,915 --> 00:07:15,469
What kids
are those?

55
00:07:15,504 --> 00:07:17,816
I forgot to tell you.
I'm late this month.

56
00:07:21,682 --> 00:07:23,753
Go again. No.

57
00:07:23,788 --> 00:07:25,134
Again.

58
00:07:25,168 --> 00:07:26,722
You go.

59
00:07:34,557 --> 00:07:37,318
That's enough. That felt good?

60
00:07:37,353 --> 00:07:39,217
No,
I can't do it anymore.

61
00:07:50,228 --> 00:07:51,850
I'm okay,
it's all right.

62
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,387
What is that?

63
00:08:14,252 --> 00:08:15,253
What?

64
00:08:16,323 --> 00:08:17,600
Listen to that.

65
00:08:18,877 --> 00:08:20,983
Bad people coming
to do bad things.

66
00:08:21,017 --> 00:08:22,812
My God!

67
00:08:22,847 --> 00:08:24,227
Violent things.

68
00:08:31,925 --> 00:08:33,133
What?

69
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:40,727
Fuck. What the fuck?

70
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:43,833
Who is it?

71
00:08:43,868 --> 00:08:45,732
Fuck. Fuck!
What the fuck!

72
00:08:47,354 --> 00:08:48,528
What, who is it?

73
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:49,839
My dad.

74
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:00,574
Let's get
this stuff upstairs.

75
00:09:02,024 --> 00:09:03,819
I think
he's with someone.Who?

76
00:09:03,853 --> 00:09:05,096
I don't know,
it's your dad.

77
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:08,858
Can you help clean up?
Get dressed.

78
00:09:10,411 --> 00:09:12,448
Just don't freak out.Get dressed.

79
00:09:12,482 --> 00:09:15,002
Hey, all right. Shit.

80
00:09:15,037 --> 00:09:16,556
Here, here, here.

81
00:09:21,491 --> 00:09:23,701
Don't, don't freak out.
It's gonna be fine.

82
00:09:23,735 --> 00:09:24,840
It's not a big deal.

83
00:09:24,874 --> 00:09:25,875
What was that?

84
00:09:27,808 --> 00:09:29,879
Where's my...

85
00:09:29,914 --> 00:09:30,915
Where's my underwear?

86
00:09:41,408 --> 00:09:42,582
Hello.

87
00:09:44,445 --> 00:09:45,446
Hi.

88
00:09:51,107 --> 00:09:52,937
Seth.

89
00:09:52,971 --> 00:09:53,972
Hey.

90
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:57,424
Didn't expect
to see you here.

91
00:09:58,563 --> 00:09:59,875
Yeah...

92
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,603
It was sort of a
last minute thing.

93
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:05,984
Just grabbed
Martha's car and...

94
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:07,020
You know...

95
00:10:10,506 --> 00:10:11,576
Hi. I'm Gil.

96
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,646
Andie.

97
00:10:12,681 --> 00:10:14,268
Nice to meet you,
finally.

98
00:10:15,442 --> 00:10:16,823
Finally, right.

99
00:10:27,557 --> 00:10:28,731
Hello.

100
00:10:32,701 --> 00:10:34,979
This is
my friend, Vicky.

101
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,327
Vicky, this is
my son, Seth.

102
00:10:39,811 --> 00:10:41,813
Hi. And Angie.

103
00:10:41,848 --> 00:10:43,159
Andie.

104
00:10:43,194 --> 00:10:45,299
I'm sorry.
And Andie.

105
00:10:45,334 --> 00:10:47,025
Nice to meet you.Nice to meet you.

106
00:10:48,613 --> 00:10:51,512
I was just
saying to Vicky
that,

107
00:10:51,547 --> 00:10:52,617
your sister,
would've called

108
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,894
so I was confused
about the car.

109
00:10:55,102 --> 00:10:57,277
Right, Martha
offered us the car and...

110
00:10:59,728 --> 00:11:01,315
We weren't really
expecting to see you,

111
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,973
and there was that
email about you
being away on work...

112
00:11:04,008 --> 00:11:05,423
All month.

113
00:11:06,735 --> 00:11:08,806
We had a...
I had a change of plans.

114
00:11:15,571 --> 00:11:17,815
Well, we'll just get
our stuff together

115
00:11:17,849 --> 00:11:20,058
and get out
of your hair then.

116
00:11:20,093 --> 00:11:22,198
You're leaving?

117
00:11:22,233 --> 00:11:25,719
Yeah. We really just
came up for the day,
anyway.

118
00:11:25,754 --> 00:11:26,755
You sure?

119
00:11:28,101 --> 00:11:31,725
Yeah, we were
just about to
get going.

120
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,106
Well,
we don't wanna
keep you.

121
00:11:34,901 --> 00:11:37,420
What, you've got some
gig to get back to
in Brooklyn?

122
00:11:39,353 --> 00:11:41,045
Yeah.

123
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:42,391
Some... Something
like that.

124
00:11:45,221 --> 00:11:46,222
Okay.

125
00:11:54,783 --> 00:11:57,855
Fucking mess
in the bathroom.
You see that?

126
00:11:57,889 --> 00:11:59,822
Wet towels
all over the floor.

127
00:11:59,857 --> 00:12:01,203
You see outside?

128
00:12:01,237 --> 00:12:02,722
He doesn't even clean up.
He just throws shit

129
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:05,483
in the general direction
of the trash can
and leaves it there.

130
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:06,795
He didn't even
know my name.

131
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:09,176
He's never been
good with names.

132
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,145
You don't think
it's weird that

133
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:14,595
my boyfriend who
claims he loves me,

134
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:17,012
hasn't even told
his dad that I exist?

135
00:12:17,046 --> 00:12:18,496
That has nothing
to do with you.

136
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,189
It's just like him to...

137
00:12:22,224 --> 00:12:25,572
Do something like this,
all the time.

138
00:12:25,606 --> 00:12:28,817
I don't understand,
why can't he be
more like his sister?

139
00:12:28,851 --> 00:12:30,680
She'd never do this.

140
00:12:30,715 --> 00:12:32,475
You think we should
ask him to stay?

141
00:12:34,201 --> 00:12:35,513
What?

142
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:38,067
I don't want him to feel
like he's being kicked out
because of me.

143
00:12:38,102 --> 00:12:40,311
What "kicked out?"
He said he wanted
to go back to the city.

144
00:12:41,864 --> 00:12:43,141
You really think
they drove two
and a half hours,

145
00:12:43,176 --> 00:12:44,522
just for the day?

146
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:47,145
Baby.

147
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:51,011
I know you had
this weekend
all planned.

148
00:12:51,046 --> 00:12:53,082
Okay, and it's
really sweet.

149
00:12:54,187 --> 00:12:56,327
But, your dad's here.

150
00:12:56,361 --> 00:12:57,742
And I've never met him.

151
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,571
And I think
it's just weird
to run away.

152
00:12:59,606 --> 00:13:02,057
It'd be weirder to stay
and hang out with him
and that random woman.

153
00:13:02,091 --> 00:13:03,921
How do you know that?

154
00:13:03,955 --> 00:13:05,681
Did you see
a hint of regret
on his face

155
00:13:05,715 --> 00:13:07,407
when I said
we were leaving?

156
00:13:07,441 --> 00:13:09,996
No, he wants us to go,
so...

157
00:13:12,895 --> 00:13:14,759
Hope I'm not
interrupting anything?

158
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,519
No, not at all?

159
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:20,040
Well, I was just
thinking that...

160
00:13:21,697 --> 00:13:25,011
If you really wanted to,
maybe you could
stay for dinner.

161
00:13:26,702 --> 00:13:28,048
I mean you probably
want to beat the traffic,

162
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,809
and it's, you know,
not a bad idea.

163
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,777
But...

164
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:33,985
If you really wanted to,

165
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:37,092
Vicky is probably
gonna start cooking
pretty soon.

166
00:13:37,126 --> 00:13:38,472
She's not
exactly a...

167
00:13:40,336 --> 00:13:43,443
Well, let's just say
the kitchen's
not her forte.

168
00:13:43,477 --> 00:13:44,962
But...

169
00:13:44,996 --> 00:13:45,997
Um...

170
00:13:47,896 --> 00:13:49,449
I think it sounds great.

171
00:13:50,691 --> 00:13:52,038
We haven't eaten.

172
00:13:58,527 --> 00:13:59,528
Yeah, it sounds great.

173
00:14:00,701 --> 00:14:02,772
Okay, she'll be
really happy
to hear that.

174
00:14:02,807 --> 00:14:04,533
So, in about
an hour or so.

175
00:14:05,741 --> 00:14:07,191
Mr. Sherwood?

176
00:14:09,193 --> 00:14:11,574
Gil, please,
I'm not that old.

177
00:14:11,609 --> 00:14:13,783
Am I?Gil.

178
00:14:13,818 --> 00:14:15,302
I don't wanna be
a buzz kill or anything

179
00:14:15,337 --> 00:14:17,408
but I'm...
I'm actually vegan.

180
00:14:18,547 --> 00:14:19,859
Vegan?

181
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:20,860
Yeah.

182
00:14:22,551 --> 00:14:23,897
Are you a vegan too?

183
00:14:23,932 --> 00:14:26,417
No, I'm vegetarian.

184
00:14:26,451 --> 00:14:28,315
He's a liar,
he eats fish.

185
00:14:31,422 --> 00:14:33,010
Okay, I'll let
Vicky know.

186
00:14:36,703 --> 00:14:38,601
Thanks.Thanks.

187
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,710
This all
looks so good.

188
00:14:43,744 --> 00:14:45,160
Thanks, it's nothing.

189
00:15:04,248 --> 00:15:05,939
You know, I think there's
some movies over there.

190
00:15:05,974 --> 00:15:09,080
If you guys wanna
watch something later.

191
00:15:09,115 --> 00:15:10,564
TV doesn't work.

192
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:11,876
Paid $2,000 for that thing,

193
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,533
and it doesn't even
turn on.

194
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:16,053
I have to get someone in
to take a look at it.

195
00:15:22,093 --> 00:15:24,371
Well, Seth might
actually be able
to fix it.

196
00:15:26,995 --> 00:15:28,168
Are you good
at that stuff?

197
00:15:28,203 --> 00:15:29,859
No, I just had
a little experience

198
00:15:29,894 --> 00:15:31,344
from doing stuff
in the studio.

199
00:15:31,378 --> 00:15:33,311
I have all these photos
on my computer,

200
00:15:33,346 --> 00:15:35,313
I can't get them off,
I'm at my wit's end.

201
00:15:35,348 --> 00:15:38,972
You think you
could help me, maybe?

202
00:15:46,324 --> 00:15:48,326
Hey.

203
00:15:48,361 --> 00:15:49,810
No, it's a fine time.

204
00:15:51,053 --> 00:15:53,055
Yeah.
Why is he doing that?

205
00:15:56,576 --> 00:15:58,647
Because, it will
all be resolved
in arbitration.

206
00:15:58,681 --> 00:15:59,786
I've already
told him that.

207
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,994
That is...

208
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:04,239
Really embarrassing
when it happens in public.

209
00:16:04,273 --> 00:16:05,654
It's a no brainer.

210
00:16:05,688 --> 00:16:07,863
Was that, um, an opera?

211
00:16:07,897 --> 00:16:09,761
Yeah, it's that song
from Pagliacci.

212
00:16:09,796 --> 00:16:11,694
Yeah.

213
00:16:11,729 --> 00:16:13,455
It's his favorite show.

214
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:15,975
We used to go
whenever there was
a production.

215
00:16:17,528 --> 00:16:19,875
You never told me that.

216
00:16:19,909 --> 00:16:22,567
Yup. No, forget
the depositions.

217
00:16:22,602 --> 00:16:24,466
What're you gonna do?
You'd have to...

218
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,881
So, you're
a tech genius.

219
00:16:25,915 --> 00:16:28,090
No. I... I...

220
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,816
I've just been
helping a friend
build a studio,

221
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:32,198
so, a lot of plugging wires
into the wrong sockets.

222
00:16:32,232 --> 00:16:34,545
- Yeah, yeah, okay.
- bye.

223
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,034
Apparently Ben threatened
to bring this before a judge.

224
00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:42,070
Do you believe that?

225
00:16:52,701 --> 00:16:54,082
This is really good.

226
00:16:54,116 --> 00:16:55,669
Thank you so much
for cooking it all.

227
00:16:55,704 --> 00:16:58,189
Really great.No, it's nothing,
you guys.

228
00:16:58,224 --> 00:17:00,640
You wanna be certain
people like your food,

229
00:17:00,674 --> 00:17:02,228
add a lot of butter.

230
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,885
There's butter in here?

231
00:17:06,404 --> 00:17:07,716
Seth, it's not,
it's not a big deal.

232
00:17:13,756 --> 00:17:15,586
What?

233
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,622
You're a vegan.

234
00:17:17,657 --> 00:17:20,039
It's okay.

235
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:21,764
What's the problem?

236
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:23,007
I put butter in it.

237
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,077
So what?

238
00:17:24,112 --> 00:17:26,183
It's an animal
product, Gil.

239
00:17:26,217 --> 00:17:28,081
It's not an animal.

240
00:17:28,116 --> 00:17:31,015
I thought,
he said vegetarian.

241
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,258
What the hell
is the difference?

242
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:33,466
Well, it's not
a problem, though...

243
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,261
What are
you gonna eat?

244
00:17:35,295 --> 00:17:37,435
Just, pass me
the salad.

245
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,058
Yeah.

246
00:17:40,162 --> 00:17:41,888
Seth, I thought you
said you ate fish.

247
00:17:42,923 --> 00:17:45,305
No, actually.
I turned vegan.Thanks.

248
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:49,551
What do you mean,
you "turned vegan?"

249
00:17:49,585 --> 00:17:51,208
That means,
I don't eat this.

250
00:17:57,662 --> 00:18:00,079
All right.

251
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:06,292
Seth, I would offer
you some wine,

252
00:18:06,326 --> 00:18:08,535
but there are
little bacteria in here
that ferment the grapes.

253
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:11,159
So, you probably
don't wanna kill them.

254
00:18:11,193 --> 00:18:12,850
Gil.Well, I don't know.

255
00:18:17,165 --> 00:18:18,269
Thanks.

256
00:18:46,332 --> 00:18:48,334
Absolutely.I didn't know this.

257
00:18:48,368 --> 00:18:50,198
Yeah.

258
00:18:50,232 --> 00:18:52,476
Thanks, honey.Thank you.

259
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,512
I'm sorry.It's okay.

260
00:18:54,547 --> 00:18:56,065
Yeah.

261
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,274
Okay.

262
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,656
Here you go. Thanks.

263
00:19:19,261 --> 00:19:20,918
Seth, maybe
you can fix the TV

264
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:22,057
and we can
watch a movie.

265
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,094
Yeah, sure.

266
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:27,959
I guess I could try
and take a look
and figure it out.

267
00:19:27,994 --> 00:19:30,169
Already looked at it.
Doesn't work.

268
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:33,620
I'm getting someone
in to fix it.

269
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,526
That is a 17th
century restoration.

270
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,955
Anyone up for
a game of Scrabble?

271
00:20:01,061 --> 00:20:02,580
Any takers?

272
00:20:02,615 --> 00:20:04,203
I'm pretty good.

273
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:10,312
I'm actually
pretty tired.

274
00:20:11,486 --> 00:20:13,212
I think I'm just
going to sleep.

275
00:20:17,837 --> 00:20:19,390
I'm sorry he
pulled that shit.

276
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:23,360
What shit?

277
00:20:23,394 --> 00:20:24,740
There is no reason
for him to act that way.

278
00:20:24,775 --> 00:20:26,294
He's not a teenager.

279
00:20:26,328 --> 00:20:29,228
Sometimes
people get stuck
in patterns.

280
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:30,677
I mean, who
behaves like that?

281
00:20:31,713 --> 00:20:32,955
You're right, babe.

282
00:20:35,303 --> 00:20:37,960
Why did you have
to put butter in
their food, anyway?

283
00:20:37,995 --> 00:20:40,342
Are you kidding me?No. I'm not kidding.

284
00:20:40,377 --> 00:20:41,930
We could have avoided
the whole thing with them.

285
00:20:41,964 --> 00:20:44,035
How was I supposed
to know they
didn't eat butter?

286
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,486
Because I told you.You said vegetarian.

287
00:20:46,521 --> 00:20:47,660
What the hell
is the difference?

288
00:20:47,694 --> 00:20:49,006
And you could have
consulted me,

289
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,939
before you invited
them to stay
in the first place.

290
00:20:52,975 --> 00:20:54,736
It's one night, baby.

291
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,878
Well, I've had
a wonderful evening.

292
00:20:59,879 --> 00:21:01,570
But this wasn't it.

293
00:21:01,605 --> 00:21:03,538
Yeah, exactly.

294
00:21:03,572 --> 00:21:04,849
I don't know.

295
00:21:04,884 --> 00:21:06,437
I mean,

296
00:21:06,472 --> 00:21:08,301
it's kinda crazy here.

297
00:21:08,336 --> 00:21:10,821
Interesting,
would be a good word.

298
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,100
Okay.

299
00:21:14,134 --> 00:21:16,309
Well, I...
I totally understand.

300
00:21:16,344 --> 00:21:18,829
I gotta... I gotta go.

301
00:21:18,863 --> 00:21:20,106
All right, I love you.

302
00:21:22,557 --> 00:21:24,904
Didn't you just
talk to him
this afternoon?

303
00:21:24,938 --> 00:21:26,526
He called when
you were in the bathroom.

304
00:21:33,844 --> 00:21:35,190
Um...

305
00:21:36,812 --> 00:21:39,021
I think we should
probably leave
in the morning.

306
00:21:40,885 --> 00:21:42,231
Okay.

307
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,717
I'll do whatever
you wanna do.

308
00:21:44,751 --> 00:21:46,477
Why do you
say it like that?

309
00:21:46,512 --> 00:21:47,927
Like what?

310
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,998
All passive aggressive...

311
00:21:50,032 --> 00:21:52,276
I'm just saying,
like, we could go
if you wanna go.

312
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,176
Did you not get
enough to eat?
Are you hungry?

313
00:22:00,008 --> 00:22:01,250
Good night.

314
00:22:01,285 --> 00:22:03,736
I'll make you something
if you want.No, I'm not hungry.

315
00:22:10,536 --> 00:22:11,640
Okay.

316
00:22:17,991 --> 00:22:19,752
She's probably
my sister's age.

317
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,858
She's not that young.

318
00:22:26,068 --> 00:22:27,691
Whatever.
If he wants to
keep secrets,

319
00:22:27,725 --> 00:22:29,969
he can keep secrets,
I don't even wanna know.

320
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,250
Why you do that?

321
00:22:35,284 --> 00:22:37,563
Ouch.Sorry.

322
00:22:37,597 --> 00:22:38,978
Why does it
bother you so much?

323
00:22:39,012 --> 00:22:40,289
It doesn't, it's just...

324
00:22:40,324 --> 00:22:41,912
Well, I mean...

325
00:22:41,946 --> 00:22:44,466
It's kind of immature.
It looks a little juvenile.

326
00:22:45,709 --> 00:22:48,090
I didn't do it
front of your dad.

327
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:51,300
I don't care
if you did it
in front of my dad.

328
00:22:51,335 --> 00:22:52,750
And...

329
00:22:52,785 --> 00:22:54,338
You did.Okay.

330
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,822
All right.

331
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,620
Okay.

332
00:23:48,806 --> 00:23:49,807
Hey.

333
00:23:52,154 --> 00:23:53,362
Good morning.

334
00:24:12,381 --> 00:24:13,969
What the hell
is that?

335
00:24:14,004 --> 00:24:15,557
Coffee, I assumed.

336
00:24:15,592 --> 00:24:18,008
It was in the carafe when
I got up this morning.

337
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,080
What the hell
is yerba mate?

338
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,289
Yerba mate, babe.

339
00:24:23,323 --> 00:24:25,049
I can make a new pot.
It's okay.

340
00:24:25,084 --> 00:24:26,119
No, no.

341
00:24:26,154 --> 00:24:28,363
It's...
It's in the pot.

342
00:24:30,192 --> 00:24:31,608
I'll clean it.

343
00:24:33,057 --> 00:24:35,197
You know,
I'm not gonna spend
the entire weekend

344
00:24:35,232 --> 00:24:36,923
cleaning up after them.

345
00:24:43,585 --> 00:24:45,104
I didn't know
you canoed.

346
00:24:45,138 --> 00:24:46,243
Those are kayaks.

347
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:47,900
I hardly ever use them.

348
00:24:47,934 --> 00:24:49,108
We should take
them out later.

349
00:24:49,142 --> 00:24:51,041
It could be fun.I'm not very good.

350
00:24:51,075 --> 00:24:53,906
Right.
That's why you own
four of them.

351
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,080
I do not own four.
My dad does.

352
00:24:56,115 --> 00:24:58,635
He made us have them.
He's like the kayak master.

353
00:24:58,669 --> 00:25:01,430
He can do
Eskimo rolls
and everything.

354
00:25:01,465 --> 00:25:03,502
There's one in
the back there that
has your name on it.

355
00:25:04,606 --> 00:25:05,607
Mister.

356
00:25:14,927 --> 00:25:15,997
Morning.

357
00:25:16,031 --> 00:25:17,032
Morning.

358
00:25:18,344 --> 00:25:19,897
Where are you going?

359
00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:23,487
Vicky and I,
actually have to
get back to the city.

360
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,145
So...

361
00:25:27,249 --> 00:25:28,734
We actually...

362
00:25:31,219 --> 00:25:33,946
We were going to leave
so you two should...

363
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,119
No, it's fine.

364
00:25:35,154 --> 00:25:36,396
There is no sense
in all of us leaving.

365
00:25:36,431 --> 00:25:38,640
You stay,
enjoy the weekend.

366
00:25:38,675 --> 00:25:40,366
It's supposed
to be beautiful.

367
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:48,685
I don't want to have
this discussion right now.

368
00:25:48,719 --> 00:25:49,858
It's easier for
everybody if you don't...

369
00:25:49,893 --> 00:25:52,551
You never even tried.
Avoidance isn't trying.

370
00:25:52,585 --> 00:25:54,587
I have tried.
I've tried for 15 years.

371
00:25:54,622 --> 00:25:56,796
Hey.

372
00:25:56,831 --> 00:25:59,696
I was just wondering
if you guys really
have to leave so soon?

373
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,145
Yeah.

374
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,595
Well...

375
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:05,460
We actually managed
to get tickets to, um,

376
00:26:05,494 --> 00:26:09,119
Don Giovanni, tonight,
City Opera...

377
00:26:09,153 --> 00:26:11,293
And it's supposed
to be great, so...

378
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,916
I just found
the canoes.

379
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,400
The kayaks.

380
00:26:14,434 --> 00:26:17,265
He says that
you are like
the kayak master.

381
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:18,922
Really? He said that?

382
00:26:18,956 --> 00:26:20,268
He loves it.

383
00:26:20,302 --> 00:26:22,270
He talks about it
all the time.

384
00:26:23,271 --> 00:26:25,894
That you're the only one
that knows how to do
an Alaskan roll.

385
00:26:25,929 --> 00:26:27,378
Alaska roll is sushi.

386
00:26:27,413 --> 00:26:29,484
An Eskimo roll.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

387
00:26:29,518 --> 00:26:31,348
It's been a while.

388
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:33,074
Maybe you can stick around
and just give a hand,

389
00:26:33,108 --> 00:26:35,801
I've never done it before
and since you're the master,
I thought...

390
00:26:37,665 --> 00:26:41,289
I would like to see
some mastery. Yeah.

391
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:43,602
We could do
a little class.

392
00:26:43,636 --> 00:26:46,156
Yeah, I don't think
I am qualified
to be an instructor.

393
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,089
I didn't bring
a bathing suit.

394
00:26:48,123 --> 00:26:49,953
I mean, it's just.

395
00:26:49,987 --> 00:26:51,610
It's just the basics,
come on.

396
00:26:53,232 --> 00:26:55,821
I think we can
change our plans.
Right?

397
00:26:55,855 --> 00:26:57,339
Come on.

398
00:26:57,374 --> 00:26:59,687
I, 
I think we...

399
00:27:00,964 --> 00:27:03,622
I mean we could call,
but I don't think we can
change the tickets.

400
00:27:08,005 --> 00:27:11,699
You just want
to keep the rhythm
pretty even.

401
00:27:11,733 --> 00:27:13,839
So you don't tip
the boat inadvertently.

402
00:27:13,873 --> 00:27:15,495
Like this?

403
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:17,221
Yeah, that's it!

404
00:27:17,256 --> 00:27:19,603
How do I make
this thing stop?

405
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,329
My God! Okay.

406
00:27:21,363 --> 00:27:24,539
It's not a car.
It doesn't have
water brakes.

407
00:27:24,573 --> 00:27:26,334
Yeah, I'm sorry, no.

408
00:27:26,368 --> 00:27:28,923
When Seth was a kid,
he was pretty good.

409
00:27:28,957 --> 00:27:30,303
Is that so?

410
00:27:30,338 --> 00:27:33,444
Yeah. He had
pretty good control.

411
00:27:33,479 --> 00:27:35,654
He'd zip in and out of
the rocks and the rapids.

412
00:27:35,688 --> 00:27:37,725
Will you teach me
one of those rolls?

413
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:39,002
You'd have to
go under to do that.

414
00:27:39,036 --> 00:27:40,072
So?

415
00:27:40,106 --> 00:27:41,487
Well,
you'll get all wet.

416
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,179
I could never
really do 'em.

417
00:27:49,012 --> 00:27:50,082
All right,
I'll do one.

418
00:27:50,116 --> 00:27:52,774
What is it, Gil?
Is it dangerous?

419
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:58,711
Most likely.
Hold your breath, honey.

420
00:28:05,822 --> 00:28:08,790
Gil! You guys,
somebody help him.

421
00:28:08,825 --> 00:28:10,412
Whoo-hoo!

422
00:28:11,586 --> 00:28:13,726
Not bad for
an old fart, right?

423
00:28:13,761 --> 00:28:15,245
That was awesome.

424
00:28:16,902 --> 00:28:18,179
Hey! Derby.

425
00:28:19,456 --> 00:28:21,665
Can't believe
you're saying that.Hey.

426
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,873
Derby.What's "derby"?

427
00:28:22,908 --> 00:28:24,081
Derby. Nothing.

428
00:28:24,116 --> 00:28:25,393
You gotta do one now.

429
00:28:25,427 --> 00:28:26,497
I couldn't,
even if I wanted to.

430
00:28:26,532 --> 00:28:28,534
Yes, you can.No, I don't have
a spray skirt,

431
00:28:28,568 --> 00:28:30,467
my kayak would
fill up with water.You don't need a spray skirt.

432
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:33,159
Just do one.I can't.

433
00:28:33,194 --> 00:28:34,678
Do it!Come on.

434
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:35,748
Do it!

435
00:28:35,783 --> 00:28:37,612
Hey!Sorry.

436
00:28:39,131 --> 00:28:40,822
That's it.

437
00:28:40,857 --> 00:28:42,030
Now you're going in!No, you're going...no!

438
00:28:42,065 --> 00:28:44,308
You're going first.

439
00:28:44,343 --> 00:28:46,034
Come here.No! No!

440
00:28:46,069 --> 00:28:47,587
No!

441
00:28:51,212 --> 00:28:53,248
Seth! Do a roll now.

442
00:28:54,422 --> 00:28:56,769
Seth. Where are you?

443
00:28:58,598 --> 00:29:00,048
Do a roll now!

444
00:29:03,327 --> 00:29:04,812
Seth!

445
00:29:04,846 --> 00:29:06,537
God.

446
00:29:06,572 --> 00:29:07,573
Seth.

447
00:29:11,404 --> 00:29:13,475
I got ya!

448
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,063
My God.

449
00:29:16,064 --> 00:29:17,514
You!

450
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:19,343
Seth!

451
00:29:19,378 --> 00:29:22,208
Seth!
So not cool!

452
00:29:22,243 --> 00:29:24,279
You think
it's funny?

453
00:29:24,314 --> 00:29:26,385
I do. Really.Really?

454
00:29:26,419 --> 00:29:28,076
Wait a minute.
Hey, take it easy.Really?

455
00:29:29,181 --> 00:29:30,907
Take what easy?

456
00:29:30,941 --> 00:29:33,633
I'm dead serious.Really?

457
00:29:35,463 --> 00:29:36,567
Gil!

458
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,160
Seth!

459
00:29:43,195 --> 00:29:44,265
Gil!

460
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,613
No, Seth, don't.

461
00:29:47,647 --> 00:29:50,064
Seth, please, please. It's time.
I'm really sorry.

462
00:29:50,098 --> 00:29:51,824
Seth, do not do that. I'm sorry.

463
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:53,481
Do not do that.

464
00:29:53,515 --> 00:29:55,310
This water is corroded.

465
00:29:55,345 --> 00:29:56,622
Get her!

466
00:29:56,656 --> 00:29:58,382
My hair!

467
00:29:58,417 --> 00:29:59,625
You have no idea.

468
00:30:00,902 --> 00:30:03,802
My God!
My God.

469
00:30:03,836 --> 00:30:05,148
All right.
You're okay.

470
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,772
None of this is funny. Come on, Vicky.

471
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:09,946
It's fine.
Here, it's shallow over here.

472
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:10,981
You can get
out this way.

473
00:30:13,397 --> 00:30:14,467
It's fine right here.

474
00:30:14,502 --> 00:30:17,160
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

475
00:30:17,194 --> 00:30:19,231
Come on,
you can touch right here.

476
00:30:19,265 --> 00:30:21,267
Okay, see if you can touch.

477
00:30:21,302 --> 00:30:23,649
Okay. Okay.Here you go.

478
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,107
Not funny!

479
00:30:33,141 --> 00:30:35,074
It's...

480
00:30:35,109 --> 00:30:36,524
Hello.

481
00:30:38,871 --> 00:30:39,838
Shit.

482
00:31:00,203 --> 00:31:01,963
Should we get
the boats and stuff?

483
00:31:03,413 --> 00:31:05,380
Looks like you guys
are having a great time
down there.

484
00:31:05,415 --> 00:31:06,830
Yeah, listen,
I'm sorry to be rude.

485
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,108
It's just, 
it's just not really
a good time.

486
00:31:09,143 --> 00:31:10,282
Sorry.

487
00:31:10,316 --> 00:31:12,042
Mommy, can we go
in the boat?

488
00:31:12,077 --> 00:31:13,872
Maybe, honey.
We can ask in a second.

489
00:31:13,906 --> 00:31:15,597
Is that your son,
the musician?Yeah.

490
00:31:15,632 --> 00:31:17,841
Yeah. I'm sorry,
I thought
Vicky called you.

491
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,361
We just got
the message as we were
coming up the drive.

492
00:31:20,395 --> 00:31:23,191
And we thought maybe
we could let the kids
walk around.

493
00:31:23,226 --> 00:31:24,572
Yeah, yeah,
I'm sorry.

494
00:31:24,606 --> 00:31:26,712
It's just not
the best day today.

495
00:31:26,746 --> 00:31:29,128
I'm sorry, I thought
that Vicky had gotten
in touch with you.

496
00:31:29,163 --> 00:31:30,889
It's fine.
No worries at all.

497
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:33,132
Don't want to infringe
on family time.
We know what it's like.

498
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:34,996
Any other time,
really. Okay.

499
00:31:35,031 --> 00:31:36,411
Sorry for
the, inconvenience.

500
00:31:36,446 --> 00:31:37,896
Mommy, I want
to go in the boat.

501
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,414
Pretty soon we'll be
able to go into the boat

502
00:31:39,449 --> 00:31:40,691
every weekend
if you want.

503
00:31:41,761 --> 00:31:43,280
Whoo-hoo. Who wants
ice cream?

504
00:31:43,315 --> 00:31:44,316
Me. Ice cream.

505
00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:03,818
You had
a lot of chances,
the one thing...

506
00:32:05,164 --> 00:32:06,890
It's not my
fault they decided
to ignore my message.

507
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,341
It wasn't supposed
to be a message.

508
00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:11,446
You were supposed
to speak to them.

509
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:15,519
Sure does bring
back memories.

510
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,040
I'm gonna go
for a walk.

511
00:32:50,692 --> 00:32:51,970
Hey there.

512
00:32:54,593 --> 00:32:55,628
Hi.

513
00:32:57,354 --> 00:32:59,322
You won't eat
anything remotely
unhealthy

514
00:32:59,356 --> 00:33:00,564
but you smoke?

515
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,498
Um, well...

516
00:33:03,533 --> 00:33:05,431
I get it.
That's not a
cigarette, is it?

517
00:33:07,744 --> 00:33:10,229
Not really.

518
00:33:12,507 --> 00:33:15,062
I'm sorry, it's not.
I didn't, I didn't really...

519
00:33:15,096 --> 00:33:17,650
I can just put it out.Hey, I'm not a cop.

520
00:33:22,655 --> 00:33:23,794
Are you sure?

521
00:33:28,385 --> 00:33:30,801
Well, do you...
Do you want some?

522
00:33:30,836 --> 00:33:32,734
Are you offering
me marijuana?

523
00:33:34,081 --> 00:33:36,117
Yeah. I guess.
I guess, I am.

524
00:33:36,152 --> 00:33:37,567
They don't...

525
00:33:37,601 --> 00:33:39,327
Drug test lawyers
do they?

526
00:33:39,362 --> 00:33:40,501
They probably should.

527
00:33:43,435 --> 00:33:44,919
If you want any.No, thank you,

528
00:33:44,953 --> 00:33:47,025
I haven't smoked pot
in 35 years.

529
00:33:48,198 --> 00:33:49,717
I'm sorry.

530
00:33:49,751 --> 00:33:51,477
That's a travesty.

531
00:34:12,291 --> 00:34:13,741
What the hell.

532
00:34:33,485 --> 00:34:35,176
So, you were
able to,

533
00:34:35,211 --> 00:34:36,695
cancel your tickets
for tonight?

534
00:34:38,731 --> 00:34:40,561
Right. Yeah, yeah.

535
00:34:40,595 --> 00:34:42,390
We just called
and rescheduled.

536
00:34:43,736 --> 00:34:47,223
I felt uncultured,
so...

537
00:34:47,257 --> 00:34:48,845
I looked up Don Giovanni.

538
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,090
You know,
it closed last week.

539
00:35:10,073 --> 00:35:11,178
Hey.Hey.

540
00:35:11,212 --> 00:35:13,352
What are you doing
up here?

541
00:35:13,387 --> 00:35:16,907
This, this rung
was kinda rotted out.
I was fixing it.

542
00:35:16,942 --> 00:35:19,945
Thought I might
go up, have a look.Whoa.

543
00:35:19,979 --> 00:35:21,740
You built that?

544
00:35:21,774 --> 00:35:24,122
Yeah, me and my dad
and my sister about
100 years ago.

545
00:35:25,571 --> 00:35:27,194
What do you say?
You wanna go up,
check it out?

546
00:35:27,228 --> 00:35:29,334
What, up there?

547
00:35:29,368 --> 00:35:32,475
About 30
Nor'easters have come
through here.

548
00:35:32,509 --> 00:35:34,373
If those didn't
take it down,
we're not gonna.

549
00:35:34,408 --> 00:35:36,030
Yeah, not comforting.

550
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:39,309
You'll go first.
I'll stand and make
sure you don't fall.

551
00:35:39,344 --> 00:35:40,690
Seth, I grew up
in the city.

552
00:35:40,724 --> 00:35:42,001
I played in the streets.

553
00:35:42,036 --> 00:35:44,694
Okay. All right.
Suit yourself.This is not good.

554
00:35:44,728 --> 00:35:46,385
Suit yourself.

555
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:49,595
Wait.
Is it like super cool?

556
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:53,081
It was
when I was 12.

557
00:35:54,186 --> 00:35:55,774
God, it's so
beautiful out here.

558
00:35:56,844 --> 00:35:58,777
Supposed to be
a lot nicer.

559
00:35:58,811 --> 00:36:01,814
I wanted to try
to copy a section
of Prospect Park.

560
00:36:04,541 --> 00:36:06,164
This landscape
architect...

561
00:36:07,234 --> 00:36:09,684
It's the same guy
that works for... Prospect Park?

562
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:11,376
He's the same guy
the Clintons use

563
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:13,343
on their property
in Chappaqua.

564
00:36:15,103 --> 00:36:18,728
He costs a fortune.
Doesn't listen to
a word you say.

565
00:36:21,386 --> 00:36:24,147
You don't like use some
like local high school
kids to help you

566
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,321
take care
of the place?

567
00:36:36,297 --> 00:36:37,919
I don't know,
I thought...

568
00:36:37,954 --> 00:36:40,474
Yeah.

569
00:36:40,508 --> 00:36:42,924
Wow, I don't remember
getting high like this.

570
00:36:43,925 --> 00:36:45,962
What's it like?

571
00:36:47,895 --> 00:36:49,172
A lot of things
going on.

572
00:36:50,932 --> 00:36:52,175
A lot of things
happening.

573
00:36:55,109 --> 00:36:57,422
I just used to remember
it being so mellow.

574
00:36:59,424 --> 00:37:00,701
You seem
pretty mellow.

575
00:37:00,735 --> 00:37:02,841
Yeah, but everything
is so intense.

576
00:37:02,875 --> 00:37:04,394
It's like you can
see every leaf

577
00:37:04,429 --> 00:37:07,017
on every one
of those trees
moving individually.

578
00:37:07,052 --> 00:37:08,226
I mean, look at that.

579
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,195
How many leaves do you
think are on that tree?

580
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:14,887
I... I don't know.

581
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,959
40,000?

582
00:37:20,341 --> 00:37:22,240
100,000 leaves.

583
00:37:24,552 --> 00:37:27,210
Is that your... Is that
your final answer? Well, it's just a guess.

584
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:30,178
Well, you're...
It's very precise.

585
00:37:32,215 --> 00:37:33,458
A real man of science.

586
00:37:35,529 --> 00:37:38,601
I just can't
believe that you...
You own all of this.

587
00:37:43,295 --> 00:37:45,090
Yeah.

588
00:37:45,124 --> 00:37:46,160
Right.

589
00:37:47,955 --> 00:37:49,370
Like, all of this.

590
00:37:49,405 --> 00:37:51,096
It's like...You ever been
up here before?

591
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:53,029
No.

592
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:55,342
No way.

593
00:37:55,376 --> 00:37:57,654
This is like
a really big deal...

594
00:37:57,689 --> 00:37:58,897
For him,
you know?

595
00:38:02,556 --> 00:38:03,833
Bringing me up
here, you know.

596
00:38:07,215 --> 00:38:08,596
I think he thinks of it
like it's the place

597
00:38:08,631 --> 00:38:11,116
he got to be
with you, you know.

598
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,359
Yeah, I doubt that.

599
00:38:12,393 --> 00:38:14,637
He spent most
of the time we
were here hiding

600
00:38:14,671 --> 00:38:16,294
from me in that
tree fort of his.

601
00:38:24,405 --> 00:38:27,235
I was just beginning to
feel like I got all the
grime off from the lake.

602
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:32,862
Okay. You think it's okay
that we didn't wear pants?What?

603
00:38:32,896 --> 00:38:35,623
I mean we walked
through all that brush
to get up here.

604
00:38:35,658 --> 00:38:38,419
I don't understand
what you're afraid of.

605
00:38:38,454 --> 00:38:39,765
I don't know.

606
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,872
Ticks, Lyme disease,
bed bugs.

607
00:38:48,222 --> 00:38:49,672
So, are you
supposed to lie

608
00:38:49,706 --> 00:38:51,708
if I ask you about those
people who showed up.

609
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:54,918
I...

610
00:38:56,541 --> 00:39:00,407
Is the house already sold
or is he still working
out the deal?

611
00:39:01,408 --> 00:39:04,031
I assumed your
father would have
told you already.

612
00:39:06,067 --> 00:39:08,415
It's his house,
he can do
whatever he wants.

613
00:39:15,836 --> 00:39:18,183
I'm starting
to get hungry.

614
00:39:18,217 --> 00:39:19,357
That happens.

615
00:39:20,668 --> 00:39:23,464
Did you get enough nuts
and berries for breakfast?

616
00:39:23,499 --> 00:39:24,672
What'd you eat,
chestnuts?

617
00:39:24,707 --> 00:39:26,398
You know what, just
for that you... No...Bamboo shoots?

618
00:39:26,433 --> 00:39:27,813
You're gonna get...

619
00:39:27,848 --> 00:39:31,230
All right, you're
gonna get an amazing
vegan dinner tonight.

620
00:39:31,265 --> 00:39:34,026
Let's not get
carried away.

621
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:37,375
No, I'm...
It's decided.

622
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:39,377
Once you've voiced
your prejudice.

623
00:39:39,411 --> 00:39:41,655
Yeah, what are
we gonna have?

624
00:39:41,689 --> 00:39:43,070
Twigs?
Let's not...No.

625
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,416
I don't know,
you might even...I take it back.

626
00:39:44,451 --> 00:39:45,935
I don't know.I take it back.

627
00:39:45,969 --> 00:39:48,524
You might turn vegan
once the master chef
is through with you.

628
00:39:48,558 --> 00:39:50,871
The Master Chef?
I saw your show
on television.

629
00:39:50,905 --> 00:39:53,632
You were excellent. It's not
me. It's Seth.

630
00:39:54,737 --> 00:39:55,876
Seth?

631
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:00,536
He's never cooked
for you before?

632
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:01,813
Cooked? Seth?

633
00:40:01,847 --> 00:40:04,022
Cooked for me?
No.

634
00:40:04,056 --> 00:40:05,851
Why?Are you kidding?

635
00:40:05,886 --> 00:40:08,820
It's like having
your own personal Emeril.

636
00:40:08,854 --> 00:40:10,546
I... I find that
hard to believe.

637
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:13,687
His mother cannot
boil an egg.No.

638
00:40:13,721 --> 00:40:15,413
Teresa, she...she makes
some good stuff.

639
00:40:16,448 --> 00:40:17,656
You know Teresa?

640
00:40:20,314 --> 00:40:21,315
Yeah.

641
00:40:22,627 --> 00:40:24,456
No, we just...
We've met like
a few times.

642
00:40:32,671 --> 00:40:35,674
Hey, you wanna
finish that?Yeah, spark it up.

643
00:40:35,709 --> 00:40:37,089
Why stop now?

644
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:44,234
So, where did
he learn to cook?

645
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,825
All those restaurants
that he worked at.

646
00:40:52,277 --> 00:40:54,797
Right. Right.

647
00:40:54,831 --> 00:40:58,352
I knew he was a waiter
at some point.
But, he was a chef?

648
00:40:58,386 --> 00:40:59,733
I mean, I don't
know about that.

649
00:40:59,767 --> 00:41:01,493
But, he was like,
in the kitchen,
you know?

650
00:41:01,528 --> 00:41:04,703
Some really nice places.
It was like, Mercer.

651
00:41:04,738 --> 00:41:07,016
There was that place
Eleven Madison.Eleven Madison?

652
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,535
We used to go
to Eleven Madison
all the time.

653
00:41:08,569 --> 00:41:10,606
I used to take Vicky
to Eleven Madison.

654
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,228
It's really nice.
It's good.

655
00:41:12,262 --> 00:41:13,954
Did he like it?

656
00:41:13,988 --> 00:41:15,887
No. He hated it.

657
00:41:15,921 --> 00:41:17,544
He's...

658
00:41:17,578 --> 00:41:18,855
It's just...

659
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:21,271
It's so good that he
doesn't have to do
that anymore, you know.

660
00:41:30,142 --> 00:41:31,281
He's never...

661
00:41:33,076 --> 00:41:34,526
He like, never...

662
00:41:34,561 --> 00:41:37,253
Seth's never mentioned
me before, right?

663
00:41:48,575 --> 00:41:50,438
He's afraid of what
you'll think of me.

664
00:41:54,995 --> 00:41:57,169
How long have you
two been together?

665
00:41:58,412 --> 00:42:01,277
Going on like, 
two years.

666
00:42:05,143 --> 00:42:06,420
Where do you live?

667
00:42:06,454 --> 00:42:08,456
Are you asking me
if we live together?

668
00:42:08,491 --> 00:42:10,286
Do you?

669
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,184
You don't want
to ask your dad?

670
00:42:12,219 --> 00:42:14,877
Yeah, he's been so
forthcoming with information.

671
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,606
Can you stop
doing that please?

672
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,849
Why, is it
bothering you?

673
00:42:21,884 --> 00:42:23,368
It's terrifying me,
actually.

674
00:42:23,402 --> 00:42:25,335
Which I'm guessing
is your intention.

675
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:28,787
But you can consider
my stability
sufficiently dismantled.

676
00:42:45,114 --> 00:42:48,048
Sorry for almost
drowning you earlier.

677
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,053
It's okay.

678
00:43:05,479 --> 00:43:07,343
Thanks. Thank you.

679
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:20,045
So, how'd it feel?
Pulling up those boards?

680
00:43:21,288 --> 00:43:23,186
You know, you sound
like a shrink sometimes.

681
00:43:23,221 --> 00:43:25,741
And how does it make you feel
when I sound like that?

682
00:43:25,775 --> 00:43:27,294
Seriously, you're a shrink?

683
00:43:27,328 --> 00:43:29,123
God!

684
00:43:29,158 --> 00:43:32,437
Manhattan, a lawyer
and a psychiatrist.

685
00:43:32,471 --> 00:43:33,714
Okay, Brooklyn.

686
00:43:33,749 --> 00:43:35,578
Mr. Musician.

687
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:36,855
What's Andie?

688
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:37,960
A non-profit worker?

689
00:43:37,994 --> 00:43:39,513
She told you that.

690
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:41,998
No.Seriously, you
didn't know?

691
00:43:42,033 --> 00:43:43,103
I swear.

692
00:43:43,137 --> 00:43:45,001
Fuck.

693
00:43:45,036 --> 00:43:46,658
God, is everybody
that predictable?

694
00:43:56,254 --> 00:43:58,014
You know, I spent a
whole night in here once.

695
00:43:59,015 --> 00:44:01,777
In the middle of February,
it was fucking freezing.

696
00:44:01,811 --> 00:44:03,088
Why would you do that?

697
00:44:03,123 --> 00:44:06,264
I don't know.
My dad yelled at
me or something.

698
00:44:06,298 --> 00:44:08,818
So, after I went to bed
I snuck out.

699
00:44:08,853 --> 00:44:11,131
Came up here
and waited.

700
00:44:13,892 --> 00:44:15,031
And what happened?

701
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:17,965
Nothing.

702
00:44:19,484 --> 00:44:21,141
I got the worst flu
I ever had,

703
00:44:21,175 --> 00:44:23,177
missed two weeks of
school and he never
even mentioned it.

704
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:27,665
I doubt he even knew
you were up here.

705
00:44:47,029 --> 00:44:48,064
Whoa.

706
00:44:49,169 --> 00:44:50,239
Hey.

707
00:44:54,105 --> 00:44:56,935
Where are
you going?This is good stuff.

708
00:44:56,970 --> 00:44:58,488
I don't wanna let
it go to waste.

709
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:10,086
I'm good.
No, thanks.

710
00:45:10,121 --> 00:45:11,363
You don't know
what you're missing.

711
00:45:19,026 --> 00:45:20,856
But he was like...Then he refused.

712
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:22,720
He was like, seven.
He refused.Aw!

713
00:45:22,754 --> 00:45:25,619
He absolutely refused
to go in that pond

714
00:45:25,653 --> 00:45:26,896
without his little
cowboy hat on.

715
00:45:26,931 --> 00:45:29,347
Entirely buck naked,

716
00:45:29,381 --> 00:45:31,763
except for the hat.

717
00:45:31,798 --> 00:45:34,870
That is so cute.
Shit!

718
00:45:34,904 --> 00:45:37,596
They're coming.
Be cool. Be cool.

719
00:45:48,953 --> 00:45:50,748
Hey.Hey.

720
00:45:50,782 --> 00:45:52,232
Hey there, cowboy.

721
00:45:55,442 --> 00:45:56,754
What is so funny?

722
00:45:56,788 --> 00:45:59,377
We were...
We were just...

723
00:46:01,586 --> 00:46:04,071
Gil, are you
smoking pot?

724
00:46:04,106 --> 00:46:05,452
What...what...what.

725
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,248
Wow, this is something.

726
00:46:08,282 --> 00:46:10,422
Have some.
Can she have some?

727
00:46:10,457 --> 00:46:11,769
Of course.

728
00:46:11,803 --> 00:46:13,598
No, no. I'm okay.

729
00:46:16,463 --> 00:46:17,705
I'm sorry. Sorry.

730
00:46:20,536 --> 00:46:22,193
Baby, come here.

731
00:46:22,227 --> 00:46:25,058
Hey, is that...
Is that the syrup tap?

732
00:46:25,092 --> 00:46:27,543
Yeah, just gonna
put this inside.

733
00:46:29,027 --> 00:46:30,063
Hey.Just wait.

734
00:46:30,097 --> 00:46:32,582
Don't get it all
over the place.

735
00:46:32,617 --> 00:46:34,826
What? I can't smoke pot
in my own house?

736
00:46:34,861 --> 00:46:36,207
Jeez.

737
00:46:44,871 --> 00:46:47,666
She is great,
by the way.

738
00:46:47,701 --> 00:46:49,013
Really great.

739
00:46:49,047 --> 00:46:50,808
Who?Andie.

740
00:46:51,947 --> 00:46:53,051
Yeah.

741
00:46:55,157 --> 00:46:56,848
This is really
good cheese.

742
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,888
Hard, sheep's milk
cheese from Holland.

743
00:47:01,922 --> 00:47:03,372
Twenty bucks a pound
at Balducci's.

744
00:47:03,406 --> 00:47:05,339
It's cheaper
to buy a lobster.

745
00:47:05,374 --> 00:47:06,754
Sorry.

746
00:47:06,789 --> 00:47:07,997
I'll put the rest back.

747
00:47:08,032 --> 00:47:10,103
No come on.
Go ahead.

748
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,660
So, I guess you turned
cheeseterian?

749
00:47:19,215 --> 00:47:20,423
Gotcha.

750
00:47:32,435 --> 00:47:33,851
God damn it.

751
00:47:35,783 --> 00:47:37,578
Every time.

752
00:47:37,613 --> 00:47:39,408
Every single time
you do this.

753
00:47:42,652 --> 00:47:44,102
Every single time.

754
00:47:44,137 --> 00:47:46,035
I haven't touched that
thing in probably 15 years.Doesn't matter.

755
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:48,279
Every single time,
you do that.

756
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:56,425
Shit!

757
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,409
Hey, will you leave
that thing alone.I'm done.

758
00:48:18,447 --> 00:48:21,001
So, how is the
real estate market
up here?

759
00:48:23,348 --> 00:48:24,729
How is the what?

760
00:48:24,763 --> 00:48:26,662
You know...

761
00:48:26,696 --> 00:48:28,526
How are things
selling in this area?

762
00:48:33,048 --> 00:48:35,188
Look, I never
use the place.

763
00:48:36,465 --> 00:48:37,915
It's incredibly expensive
to maintain,

764
00:48:37,949 --> 00:48:39,537
the taxes alone
are a fortune.

765
00:48:42,678 --> 00:48:45,232
I was meaning to
bring it up to you.

766
00:48:45,267 --> 00:48:46,578
Hey, you!

767
00:48:50,203 --> 00:48:53,378
Say, what's that
bed doing here?

768
00:48:53,413 --> 00:48:55,208
I don't see it
doing anything.

769
00:48:55,242 --> 00:48:57,417
There's something
funny going on
around here.

770
00:48:57,451 --> 00:49:00,868
When I looked in this room,
there were four beds here.

771
00:49:00,903 --> 00:49:03,457
Those guys never
get old, do they?

772
00:49:03,492 --> 00:49:05,183
It's all fixed.

773
00:49:05,218 --> 00:49:06,736
Watch what you want.

774
00:49:48,226 --> 00:49:49,710
Where did you find that?

775
00:49:52,161 --> 00:49:54,025
It was just laying
around somewhere.

776
00:49:56,717 --> 00:49:58,029
You know,
it's not like I just...

777
00:49:59,065 --> 00:50:01,274
Invited him to smoke
with me, you know.

778
00:50:01,308 --> 00:50:03,414
He caught me.

779
00:50:03,448 --> 00:50:05,588
You are free to do
whatever you want.

780
00:50:06,934 --> 00:50:09,937
We were actually
having a very good time.

781
00:50:09,972 --> 00:50:12,837
You know,
everything was fine
until you showed up and...

782
00:50:12,871 --> 00:50:14,080
I'm sorry,
I interrupted you

783
00:50:14,114 --> 00:50:16,668
cavorting with
my fucking dad.

784
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,980
Fuck you.

785
00:50:23,261 --> 00:50:25,815
I don't understand
why you have
to be so dramatic.

786
00:50:30,613 --> 00:50:33,237
My, you put
a nice little scratch in it.

787
00:50:53,015 --> 00:50:54,948
I don't think you know,

788
00:50:54,982 --> 00:50:59,642
how lucky you are
that you got to have
a place like this.

789
00:50:59,677 --> 00:51:01,989
Growing up with your dad,
to take you here.

790
00:51:02,024 --> 00:51:04,302
I mean,
most people don't...

791
00:51:04,337 --> 00:51:06,960
You know, they don't...
They don't get
that kinda shit.

792
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:12,483
For me growing up,
this is the kinda place
I would only see in movies.

793
00:51:12,517 --> 00:51:13,863
You know it was
a special occasion

794
00:51:13,898 --> 00:51:16,073
when we were splurging
on going to see a movie.I know, I know.

795
00:51:16,107 --> 00:51:19,110
You have a chip
on your shoulder about
growing up penniless.

796
00:51:19,145 --> 00:51:20,284
No.

797
00:51:20,318 --> 00:51:22,113
Actually, I wasn't
raised to pamper people

798
00:51:22,148 --> 00:51:24,219
who are acting
like spoiled brats.

799
00:51:50,417 --> 00:51:53,213
I'm sorry, I just never...
I've never seen you
like this before.

800
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:00,013
You know,
not everyone's family
can be as close as yours.

801
00:52:00,047 --> 00:52:03,982
Baby, I'm up here
with you and your family
this weekend.

802
00:52:04,017 --> 00:52:05,122
What are you doing?

803
00:52:05,156 --> 00:52:07,054
Are you even
the least concerned
about me?

804
00:52:07,089 --> 00:52:08,504
Like what's happening
with my mom...

805
00:52:08,539 --> 00:52:10,368
I've got a lot
of other things
to be thinking about

806
00:52:10,403 --> 00:52:12,232
besides you.Did something happen?

807
00:52:14,545 --> 00:52:15,822
Did anything happen?

808
00:52:17,203 --> 00:52:19,377
She is not getting
any better, Seth.Right.

809
00:52:19,412 --> 00:52:21,068
Okay, that is
just what it is.

810
00:52:25,176 --> 00:52:26,246
I know.

811
00:52:28,421 --> 00:52:29,870
I'm sorry.

812
00:52:32,218 --> 00:52:34,737
Look, my brother,
you know, is taking
care of everything.

813
00:52:34,772 --> 00:52:35,945
I'm just...

814
00:52:43,229 --> 00:52:45,231
I'm thinking
about going back.

815
00:52:45,265 --> 00:52:47,164
Of course
you're going back.

816
00:52:48,648 --> 00:52:51,029
I mean, is it hard
to get time off work?

817
00:52:51,064 --> 00:52:52,928
Are they giving
you a hard time?

818
00:52:53,963 --> 00:52:55,482
No, I'm thinking about...

819
00:52:57,035 --> 00:52:58,416
Moving back.

820
00:53:06,562 --> 00:53:07,908
You mean moving out?

821
00:53:11,429 --> 00:53:13,397
I don't know.
Yeah, maybe.

822
00:53:16,365 --> 00:53:17,573
Baby, look at me.

823
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:21,991
I'm not leaving you.

824
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,788
Okay? I'm just
saying that...

825
00:53:25,823 --> 00:53:27,514
I might be leaving.

826
00:53:34,797 --> 00:53:35,971
You can come with.

827
00:53:37,662 --> 00:53:40,113
We could get a
big house for cheap.

828
00:53:40,147 --> 00:53:42,771
Or we can stay
with my brother.

829
00:53:42,805 --> 00:53:44,635
I'm sure that'd be his
dream come true.

830
00:53:50,468 --> 00:53:53,230
He would really
like you once he got
to know you better.

831
00:53:58,476 --> 00:54:00,478
I just started the
new record with Pete.

832
00:54:08,555 --> 00:54:09,556
I know.

833
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,103
I can't smoke pot
in my own house.

834
00:54:48,354 --> 00:54:49,838
So...

835
00:54:49,872 --> 00:54:51,564
You and Vicky
sell the place.

836
00:54:53,393 --> 00:54:55,602
What are you going
to do on the weekends?

837
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:01,746
I don't know.

838
00:55:03,196 --> 00:55:06,130
But I'm sure Vicky
will find a way
to spend the money.

839
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:09,892
Rent some place.

840
00:55:11,998 --> 00:55:14,241
Private beach.

841
00:55:14,276 --> 00:55:15,795
Would be nice.

842
00:55:15,829 --> 00:55:17,175
You can afford it.

843
00:55:20,593 --> 00:55:23,768
You would be welcome
to come and stay.

844
00:55:26,357 --> 00:55:28,325
Is this thing permanent?

845
00:55:33,537 --> 00:55:35,021
Is anything permanent?

846
00:55:38,473 --> 00:55:39,750
Vicky.

847
00:55:41,199 --> 00:55:42,822
Vic.

848
00:55:45,756 --> 00:55:46,895
Vicky.

849
00:55:48,275 --> 00:55:49,415
Yeah, babe.

850
00:55:49,449 --> 00:55:50,726
Where is the shampoo?

851
00:55:51,831 --> 00:55:54,385
It's right in front
of you on the left.

852
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:55,938
I don't see it.

853
00:55:55,973 --> 00:55:58,355
Never mind.
Here it is.

854
00:55:58,389 --> 00:56:00,391
I like Andie.
She is a catch,
isn't she?

855
00:56:01,772 --> 00:56:02,842
Yep!

856
00:56:08,675 --> 00:56:09,883
So, how are you feeling?

857
00:56:09,918 --> 00:56:11,782
Are you still stoned
out of your mind?

858
00:56:11,816 --> 00:56:13,680
What?

859
00:56:13,715 --> 00:56:15,372
What did you say?

860
00:56:16,821 --> 00:56:19,030
Seth was really
upset before.

861
00:56:19,065 --> 00:56:21,861
Well, you know Seth.
He gets like that.

862
00:56:24,519 --> 00:56:26,831
You don't think
you have anything
to do with it?

863
00:56:26,866 --> 00:56:30,352
What? Why am I
on the stand
all of a sudden?

864
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:31,871
This has nothing
to do with us.

865
00:56:31,905 --> 00:56:33,838
Maybe it has everything
to do with us.

866
00:56:33,873 --> 00:56:36,393
Have you ever heard
of the word "respect."

867
00:56:36,427 --> 00:56:37,842
You mean like
R-E-S-P-E-C-T?

868
00:56:37,877 --> 00:56:39,603
No, no. Be serious.
Seriously.

869
00:56:41,467 --> 00:56:43,330
You didn't even tell him
you were selling the house.

870
00:56:43,365 --> 00:56:46,368
Well, I was gonna
work up to it.You know what, Gil.

871
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,681
I'm just too old
for this shit.

872
00:56:48,715 --> 00:56:51,373
Are we gonna make
a family or aren't we?

873
00:56:52,512 --> 00:56:55,446
I don't understand
where this
is coming from.

874
00:56:55,481 --> 00:56:59,174
I... You said
you wanted to stay,
so we stayed.

875
00:56:59,208 --> 00:57:01,866
That was before I realized
you were gonna act
with such neglect.

876
00:57:01,901 --> 00:57:04,144
Neglect?Yeah.

877
00:57:04,179 --> 00:57:05,491
I see. I see.

878
00:57:05,525 --> 00:57:08,632
He is the little boy
and I'm the, 
neglectful father.

879
00:57:08,666 --> 00:57:10,357
I get it.
You know what?

880
00:57:10,392 --> 00:57:13,706
Come to think of it.
I'm not surprised that
you took his side.

881
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:15,604
Really? And what
side is that, Gil?

882
00:57:15,639 --> 00:57:18,780
And what side is that, Gil?
Enough with the questions.

883
00:57:18,814 --> 00:57:20,920
You know what?
You are right.

884
00:57:20,954 --> 00:57:22,922
I'm just gonna sit here
and enable you

885
00:57:22,956 --> 00:57:25,407
to transfer responsibility
onto everybody else
but yourself.

886
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,444
All right,
with the analysis.
It's ridiculous.

887
00:57:27,478 --> 00:57:29,411
He's not 12 years old.
He is an adult.

888
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,862
We are both adults.No, you are the father.

889
00:57:31,896 --> 00:57:33,104
Gil, act like it.

890
00:57:44,322 --> 00:57:45,634
I made an appointment.

891
00:57:48,292 --> 00:57:49,396
What?

892
00:57:55,782 --> 00:57:57,232
When? Why would
you do that?

893
00:57:57,266 --> 00:57:59,130
Without talking to me.

894
00:58:00,407 --> 00:58:01,478
I'm talking to you now.

895
00:58:01,512 --> 00:58:04,273
No, you just went ahead
and made that decision.

896
00:58:06,103 --> 00:58:07,311
Somebody had to.

897
00:58:11,004 --> 00:58:12,661
Can we not
talk about this?

898
00:58:12,696 --> 00:58:13,697
Right now?

899
00:58:14,767 --> 00:58:17,079
Here. In the middle
of all this.

900
00:58:18,943 --> 00:58:20,462
There is
no more time, Gil.

901
00:58:22,015 --> 00:58:23,361
Time's up.

902
00:58:24,742 --> 00:58:27,331
Honestly, I don't know

903
00:58:27,365 --> 00:58:28,712
if I can...

904
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:31,680
Take care of
any more people.

905
00:58:31,715 --> 00:58:35,719
Baby, we will take care
of everyone together.

906
00:58:35,753 --> 00:58:36,789
Really?

907
00:58:36,823 --> 00:58:38,169
Yes.Really?

908
00:58:38,204 --> 00:58:39,654
Like how you
took care of me
in the kayak?

909
00:58:39,688 --> 00:58:41,552
Or how you took
care of Seth

910
00:58:41,587 --> 00:58:43,520
when he was a kid,
up in the tree house...

911
00:58:43,554 --> 00:58:45,314
Seth...He almost got pneumonia.

912
00:58:45,349 --> 00:58:47,178
He gave you the
tree fort story?

913
00:58:47,213 --> 00:58:48,870
With the flu and the...

914
00:58:48,904 --> 00:58:52,287
Yeah, that's a classic.
And you fell for it,
I'm sure.

915
00:59:18,244 --> 00:59:20,246
I wanna do this with you.

916
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:26,010
And I know you
wanna do it with me.

917
00:59:26,045 --> 00:59:28,150
So, why are you
so worried?

918
00:59:28,185 --> 00:59:30,325
'Cause I don't wanna
end up like this.

919
00:59:30,359 --> 00:59:32,499
Like what?Like you and Seth.

920
00:59:34,294 --> 00:59:35,710
It's not one of
those decisions

921
00:59:35,744 --> 00:59:38,505
you can just make and
change your mind later.

922
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:39,610
I'm not changing my mind.

923
00:59:39,645 --> 00:59:41,370
No one's changing
his mind.

924
00:59:45,236 --> 00:59:46,652
You sure?I'm sure.

925
00:59:59,112 --> 01:00:01,356
You know,
he used to sit there,

926
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:03,841
on that rock
when he was a kid.

927
01:00:03,876 --> 01:00:05,740
For hours. Practicing.

928
01:00:08,915 --> 01:00:11,435
And if he even thought,
you might be listening,

929
01:00:13,057 --> 01:00:16,198
he would stop immediately,
and wait for me to walk away.

930
01:00:24,310 --> 01:00:26,381
I don't need another
screwed up family.

931
01:00:26,415 --> 01:00:27,865
Neither do I.

932
01:00:34,596 --> 01:00:36,080
You checked for ticks?Ticks?

933
01:00:36,115 --> 01:00:38,220
I haven't checked
for ticks.

934
01:00:38,255 --> 01:00:40,947
No, you haven't
checked for ticks?

935
01:00:40,982 --> 01:00:43,950
Maybe I should check
you for ticks.Yeah?

936
01:00:43,985 --> 01:00:46,815
I know where you're
going to start.

937
01:00:50,336 --> 01:00:51,648
Come in.

938
01:00:55,513 --> 01:00:58,516
Hey. The next train
leaves in about 30 minutes.

939
01:00:58,551 --> 01:01:00,208
Great. Thank you.

940
01:01:01,278 --> 01:01:02,866
I appreciate it.

941
01:01:06,939 --> 01:01:08,526
Are you okay?

942
01:01:08,561 --> 01:01:09,804
Yeah.

943
01:01:11,046 --> 01:01:12,634
It's nothing.
It's just, you know...

944
01:01:14,015 --> 01:01:15,948
It's like so many things
at once and...

945
01:01:18,122 --> 01:01:20,469
I'm kind of stepping
on everyone's toes here.

946
01:01:20,504 --> 01:01:24,439
So I think I should
just probably
take off tonight.

947
01:01:26,786 --> 01:01:29,686
You know,
I said the exact,
same thing to Gil,

948
01:01:32,171 --> 01:01:33,620
about 15 minutes ago.

949
01:01:36,071 --> 01:01:37,314
Great minds think alike.

950
01:01:40,489 --> 01:01:41,628
Hey.

951
01:01:59,646 --> 01:02:01,165
Vicky.

952
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,511
Yes, babe.

953
01:02:02,546 --> 01:02:04,237
Have you seen
my cell phone charger?

954
01:02:04,272 --> 01:02:07,689
It is right
where you left it. There you are.

955
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:09,518
Have you seen
my cell charger?

956
01:02:09,553 --> 01:02:11,175
Did you move it?No.

957
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:13,212
Then it's right
where you left it.

958
01:02:13,246 --> 01:02:15,248
It's not there.
I didn't move it.

959
01:02:15,283 --> 01:02:18,389
Okay.Um...

960
01:02:18,424 --> 01:02:20,426
I found this.
And...

961
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:22,808
It's not Vicky's,
so it must be yours.

962
01:02:22,842 --> 01:02:24,499
Thank you. I was
looking for that.

963
01:02:26,846 --> 01:02:28,952
Let's go
find your charger. I didn't touch it.

964
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:33,025
What's in here?

965
01:02:33,059 --> 01:02:34,854
I saw you hiding it.

966
01:02:34,889 --> 01:02:36,235
You know what it is.

967
01:02:37,961 --> 01:02:39,100
I want you to tell me.

968
01:02:45,623 --> 01:02:49,386
Did you go back
to that jeweler
on Seventh Avenue?

969
01:02:53,908 --> 01:02:56,531
It's the plain
silver one?The one we looked at.

970
01:02:58,913 --> 01:03:00,397
And that's why
you brought me here.

971
01:03:05,229 --> 01:03:07,197
Doesn't matter now.Of course it matters.

972
01:03:08,854 --> 01:03:10,234
I can return it.No, you can't.

973
01:03:10,269 --> 01:03:11,718
Why not?

974
01:03:11,753 --> 01:03:14,583
Because you had them
engrave some sort of funny
poetic inscription on it.

975
01:03:14,618 --> 01:03:16,068
How do you know?

976
01:03:18,001 --> 01:03:19,450
Because that's
what you would do.

977
01:03:37,503 --> 01:03:38,953
I want...

978
01:03:38,987 --> 01:03:40,161
Can I look at it?

979
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:42,715
Not unless you
wanna buy it.

980
01:03:49,101 --> 01:03:50,240
I don't know.

981
01:03:55,107 --> 01:03:56,177
Then don't.

982
01:04:15,265 --> 01:04:16,991
I don't even know
what this means, like...

983
01:04:19,372 --> 01:04:21,892
Hey. If you
want that ride,
we should go.

984
01:04:23,031 --> 01:04:24,170
Andie.

985
01:04:37,287 --> 01:04:39,945
I think I'm
actually going to stay,
after all.

986
01:04:41,153 --> 01:04:42,188
Good.

987
01:05:07,386 --> 01:05:10,389
Do you really
think I was gonna
leave you all alone,

988
01:05:10,423 --> 01:05:13,530
so you could feel
abandoned and blame me?

989
01:05:15,497 --> 01:05:17,154
That's what's going
to happen eventually.

990
01:05:18,707 --> 01:05:20,468
Well,

991
01:05:20,502 --> 01:05:22,090
I don't know
about that, but...

992
01:05:23,747 --> 01:05:25,438
It's not gonna happen
tonight, so...

993
01:05:45,389 --> 01:05:46,839
I don't understand
why we're doing this.

994
01:05:46,873 --> 01:05:48,565
They're not going
to think it tastes
like anything.

995
01:05:51,361 --> 01:05:53,087
Shit!

996
01:05:53,121 --> 01:05:55,468
What?I cut myself.

997
01:05:55,503 --> 01:05:57,229
The knife is so sharp.Are you okay?

998
01:05:57,263 --> 01:05:59,679
Yeah. Can you, can you
manage for a bit. I'm just
gonna go deal with it.

999
01:05:59,714 --> 01:06:01,267
How bad is it?
Let me look.

1000
01:06:01,302 --> 01:06:02,959
I'm just gonna
go clean it up.

1001
01:06:10,483 --> 01:06:12,796
Hey, Gil,
are you in there? Yeah.

1002
01:06:13,935 --> 01:06:16,006
What's up?

1003
01:06:16,041 --> 01:06:17,525
Hey. Sorry to interrupt.

1004
01:06:17,559 --> 01:06:20,459
Um, I just sliced
my finger off. What?

1005
01:06:20,493 --> 01:06:22,875
I...Are you okay?

1006
01:06:22,909 --> 01:06:24,497
Did you clean it?I'm gonna.

1007
01:06:24,532 --> 01:06:25,567
I just.

1008
01:06:25,602 --> 01:06:27,638
We're at a really
critical phase of
dinner prep

1009
01:06:27,673 --> 01:06:30,089
and I'm kind of
useless.

1010
01:06:32,609 --> 01:06:34,611
You think you could
help him out down there?

1011
01:06:34,645 --> 01:06:36,682
Just for like,
a little bit?

1012
01:06:36,716 --> 01:06:38,097
Me?Yeah.

1013
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:41,963
What do I know about
vegan cooking?

1014
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:43,654
Don't worry,
he'll tell you
what to do.

1015
01:07:03,847 --> 01:07:05,400
Andie said you might
need some help.

1016
01:07:05,435 --> 01:07:07,506
Um, where is she?

1017
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:09,922
She cut herself.
She sent me as
a substitute.

1018
01:07:11,786 --> 01:07:12,890
Um.

1019
01:07:14,099 --> 01:07:16,756
Okay. You think you can,

1020
01:07:16,791 --> 01:07:18,965
go make sure
the grill is on?

1021
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,967
Yes, sir.Thanks.

1022
01:07:27,077 --> 01:07:28,389
Andie!

1023
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:31,288
Shit.

1024
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:35,775
Did you just
yell something?...

1025
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:38,088
No.

1026
01:07:39,986 --> 01:07:42,437
Okay, well, you're
all set out there.Thanks.

1027
01:07:44,474 --> 01:07:45,820
What do you want
to do with these?

1028
01:07:45,854 --> 01:07:49,168
It's best if you
cut them long ways.
Not circular.

1029
01:08:07,324 --> 01:08:09,015
It's good.

1030
01:08:09,050 --> 01:08:10,948
So, what's on the menu?

1031
01:08:10,983 --> 01:08:13,848
Um, a few things, actually.

1032
01:08:13,882 --> 01:08:18,301
This is a lentil dal.
Indian kind of thing
and then...

1033
01:08:29,381 --> 01:08:31,072
So.

1034
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:32,315
What's on the menu?

1035
01:08:33,454 --> 01:08:35,904
There's a lentil
tomato thing there.

1036
01:08:35,939 --> 01:08:37,423
Then there's
some greens.

1037
01:08:37,458 --> 01:08:41,738
Your work now is gonna be
this ratatouille inspired
vegetable thing.

1038
01:08:41,772 --> 01:08:43,567
That's what I'm making.

1039
01:08:43,602 --> 01:08:45,362
You're just grilling
the vegetables.

1040
01:08:45,397 --> 01:08:48,572
I'll add them later but
it's better when you grill
the vegetables first.

1041
01:08:51,506 --> 01:08:55,648
Did you learn all this
at those restaurants
you worked at?

1042
01:08:55,683 --> 01:08:57,512
Yeah.

1043
01:08:57,547 --> 01:08:59,549
Did you like it?

1044
01:08:59,583 --> 01:09:01,378
I hated it. It was awful.

1045
01:09:02,448 --> 01:09:04,416
I can imagine.

1046
01:09:04,450 --> 01:09:06,314
Well, it's a good thing
you don't have to
do that anymore.

1047
01:09:07,419 --> 01:09:08,627
I do.

1048
01:09:10,111 --> 01:09:12,700
Every now and then,
I just pick up a shift
when I'm a little short.

1049
01:09:34,031 --> 01:09:37,138
Seth, I must say,
I'm impressed.

1050
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:40,210
And Gil. And Gil.

1051
01:09:40,245 --> 01:09:42,764
I hope you realize
that's organic quinoa,

1052
01:09:42,799 --> 01:09:48,114
sauted tofu, corn, cilantro,
no animals, no additives.

1053
01:09:48,149 --> 01:09:49,875
It's one of Seth's
signature dishes.

1054
01:09:49,909 --> 01:09:52,636
I know.
I helped him make it.

1055
01:09:52,671 --> 01:09:54,845
We didn't tell you.
We put extra butter in yours.

1056
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:56,019
Just for you.

1057
01:09:56,053 --> 01:09:58,608
I'm sorry. All right?
I'm sorry.

1058
01:09:58,642 --> 01:10:01,473
I'm sorry.
I'll get that.

1059
01:10:13,243 --> 01:10:14,624
I have
a question.

1060
01:10:14,658 --> 01:10:19,318
Um, what's "derby"?
You guys kept saying "derby."

1061
01:10:19,353 --> 01:10:23,080
We were on the 
Housatonic, was it?

1062
01:10:23,115 --> 01:10:25,255
Class four water.

1063
01:10:25,290 --> 01:10:27,223
Class two at most.

1064
01:10:27,257 --> 01:10:28,741
It was big,
wherever it was.

1065
01:10:28,776 --> 01:10:31,468
Seth did a roll
and he came out of it
and then I did a roll,

1066
01:10:31,503 --> 01:10:33,367
then he did a roll,
then I did a roll,

1067
01:10:33,401 --> 01:10:36,853
and then at some point,
Seth said, "It's like
a roller derby."

1068
01:10:36,887 --> 01:10:40,443
And now, that's
what you say when you
come out of a roll.

1069
01:10:40,477 --> 01:10:41,823
"Derby."

1070
01:10:41,858 --> 01:10:44,412
Drove my sister nuts.She was just jealous
of the boys.

1071
01:10:44,447 --> 01:10:46,518
Here we go.No, you know,

1072
01:10:46,552 --> 01:10:49,314
it's interesting,
I was reading
an article

1073
01:10:49,348 --> 01:10:50,729
and this evolutionary
biologist had this theory

1074
01:10:50,763 --> 01:10:53,732
about why men
are generally
drawn to sports more.

1075
01:10:53,766 --> 01:10:56,804
The biology articles
that he reads,
are in Maxim.

1076
01:10:56,838 --> 01:10:59,220
No, but it's
interesting.What did it say?

1077
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:00,842
The article was saying that,

1078
01:11:00,877 --> 01:11:04,156
there's a difference,
in the evolution of the
male and the female brain.

1079
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:07,090
Basically dating
back to like, hunter
and gatherer times.

1080
01:11:07,124 --> 01:11:09,851
And men, were drawn
more to activities

1081
01:11:09,886 --> 01:11:13,165
that allowed them to
exercise their judgment
of spatial dynamics.

1082
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:15,719
Like throwing a spear at
a buffalo or whatever.

1083
01:11:15,754 --> 01:11:18,653
Throwing a pass
to a wide receiver.

1084
01:11:18,688 --> 01:11:21,415
They had to judge
all these different
spaces and times

1085
01:11:21,449 --> 01:11:23,279
and hit a moving
target just right.

1086
01:11:23,313 --> 01:11:24,970
And so, women

1087
01:11:25,004 --> 01:11:28,318
are really good at
finding the tomato
in the refrigerator,

1088
01:11:28,353 --> 01:11:30,493
because we're gatherers.

1089
01:11:31,632 --> 01:11:32,978
Makes perfect sense.

1090
01:11:33,012 --> 01:11:34,704
There might be some
basis to the fact

1091
01:11:34,738 --> 01:11:36,119
that our brains
are different,

1092
01:11:36,153 --> 01:11:38,052
just because all men
seem to think that way.

1093
01:11:38,086 --> 01:11:40,779
No. Seth, is this true?

1094
01:11:40,813 --> 01:11:44,472
Seth claims women
don't know how to
step out of the wind.

1095
01:11:44,507 --> 01:11:47,233
What did you claim?I didn't
claim anything.

1096
01:11:48,373 --> 01:11:50,133
Honey!

1097
01:11:50,167 --> 01:11:52,273
Yeah. Maybe you should put
that in one of your songs.

1098
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:53,757
You know, I saw you
down there today.

1099
01:11:56,726 --> 01:11:58,590
You should play them
your new song.

1100
01:11:58,624 --> 01:11:59,694
It's, it's really good.

1101
01:11:59,729 --> 01:12:03,146
I haven't performed
that one yet.

1102
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:05,769
Yeah, but it'll be
the perfect opportunity.

1103
01:12:05,804 --> 01:12:09,635
Yeah, well, after dinner,
if you're up for it,

1104
01:12:09,670 --> 01:12:11,361
maybe we can get
a private concert?

1105
01:12:11,396 --> 01:12:14,364
I don't know. I mean
I only have a guitar

1106
01:12:14,399 --> 01:12:15,986
and it isn't...
It's not...

1107
01:12:16,021 --> 01:12:17,988
I read that review
of yours in the Voice.

1108
01:12:20,163 --> 01:12:22,234
You did?Yeah. Your dad
showed it to me.

1109
01:12:25,893 --> 01:12:27,412
It was a well
written review.

1110
01:12:28,965 --> 01:12:31,208
He was like a little boy,
showing off his report card.

1111
01:12:41,771 --> 01:12:44,739
Okay. Now, when
I get back tomorrow,

1112
01:12:44,774 --> 01:12:48,778
I will take you over
there and you can
pick out a new one.

1113
01:12:48,812 --> 01:12:50,089
Any one you want.

1114
01:12:51,608 --> 01:12:53,369
All right?

1115
01:12:53,403 --> 01:12:56,095
All right, it's getting
past your bedtime now,
so here's your mom.

1116
01:12:57,718 --> 01:12:58,788
Good night, kid.

1117
01:13:00,445 --> 01:13:01,549
Hi, sweetie.

1118
01:13:02,585 --> 01:13:05,726
No. No more computer
games tonight, baby.

1119
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:08,004
I love you, sweetie.
Now go to bed.

1120
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:39,035
Gil said that um...

1121
01:13:39,069 --> 01:13:41,002
I should open this.
So...

1122
01:13:43,004 --> 01:13:44,489
Gil.

1123
01:13:49,701 --> 01:13:51,910
What am I supposed
to call him?

1124
01:14:11,654 --> 01:14:13,034
Andie.

1125
01:14:13,069 --> 01:14:15,209
What are you doing?

1126
01:14:15,243 --> 01:14:18,143
I know how to
put wood in fire.

1127
01:14:18,177 --> 01:14:20,076
Just hold on and...

1128
01:14:21,111 --> 01:14:22,872
Shit. Sorry.

1129
01:14:22,906 --> 01:14:25,081
It's fine. It's fine.Are you okay?

1130
01:14:28,153 --> 01:14:29,465
Where's the cut?

1131
01:14:30,845 --> 01:14:33,399
What? Maybe it just,
it healed.

1132
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:39,544
Yoo-hoo.

1133
01:14:42,547 --> 01:14:44,894
I shouldn't have
brought you here. Hey guys!

1134
01:14:48,518 --> 01:14:50,106
How am I supposed
to trust you?

1135
01:14:56,802 --> 01:14:58,597
Well, you didn't
trust me before.

1136
01:15:00,254 --> 01:15:01,669
Seth?

1137
01:15:01,704 --> 01:15:03,706
Is there a concert
tonight or what?

1138
01:15:16,408 --> 01:15:18,859
Can you hold this?
I just, I have to go
to the bathroom.

1139
01:15:24,450 --> 01:15:25,728
Is everything okay?

1140
01:15:27,143 --> 01:15:28,316
Yeah.

1141
01:15:31,596 --> 01:15:33,356
Yeah.

1142
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:34,737
You want some wine?

1143
01:15:34,771 --> 01:15:36,877
No. I'm all right.Glass is
already poured.

1144
01:15:42,883 --> 01:15:45,092
God, it gets cold
out here at night,
doesn't it?

1145
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:48,060
That's what
the fire is for.

1146
01:15:49,096 --> 01:15:50,615
Turn up the thermostat?

1147
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:55,343
Here, sit here.
It's closer, it's warmer.

1148
01:16:07,493 --> 01:16:09,116
You're better?

1149
01:16:09,150 --> 01:16:11,187
Is it possible that it
actually got colder.

1150
01:16:11,221 --> 01:16:13,603
Are you always
this persnickety?

1151
01:16:13,638 --> 01:16:15,674
No.

1152
01:16:32,726 --> 01:16:34,728
I think these
wide open spaces
sort of...

1153
01:16:35,970 --> 01:16:37,178
Make me nervous.

1154
01:16:45,152 --> 01:16:47,499
The city just tricks
you into feeling like
you're not alone.

1155
01:16:49,708 --> 01:16:50,985
I don't think
you're alone.

1156
01:17:05,379 --> 01:17:06,552
What do you want?

1157
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:10,177
What do you mean?

1158
01:17:10,211 --> 01:17:11,627
Is this some sort
of exchange

1159
01:17:11,661 --> 01:17:14,630
where you let him
fuck you and he helps
provide for your kid?

1160
01:17:34,270 --> 01:17:35,478
Fuck.

1161
01:18:01,297 --> 01:18:02,919
Are you drinking?

1162
01:18:02,954 --> 01:18:04,127
I'm just holding it.

1163
01:18:05,128 --> 01:18:06,371
Your breath
smells like wine.

1164
01:18:07,752 --> 01:18:09,581
I can have a glass
of wine if I want, Gil.

1165
01:19:47,644 --> 01:19:48,784
Hold this for
a second.

1166
01:19:53,754 --> 01:19:55,825
Old lady doesn't like it
when I eat this stuff.

1167
01:19:56,895 --> 01:19:58,621
Adds an extra layer.

1168
01:19:58,655 --> 01:20:00,036
So you sneak it?

1169
01:20:00,071 --> 01:20:02,832
And by taking this spoon,
you agree not to tell her.

1170
01:20:02,867 --> 01:20:04,938
Dad, I won't tell.What's the password?

1171
01:20:04,972 --> 01:20:07,181
Are you really
doing this right now?Password.

1172
01:20:07,216 --> 01:20:09,839
You're seriously
going to...What's the password?

1173
01:20:09,874 --> 01:20:11,737
Swordfish.Good man.

1174
01:20:18,330 --> 01:20:20,367
Remember that place
on the corner?

1175
01:20:20,401 --> 01:20:23,025
The one in town,
the ice-cream place?Yeah, I do.

1176
01:20:24,509 --> 01:20:27,753
That's the kind of place,
you will never

1177
01:20:27,788 --> 01:20:29,583
find ice-cream
like that again,

1178
01:20:29,617 --> 01:20:30,826
for the rest
of your life.

1179
01:20:33,552 --> 01:20:34,657
That's it.

1180
01:20:35,865 --> 01:20:37,591
Forgot to bring
the bug spray.

1181
01:20:37,625 --> 01:20:41,319
Here, try this.
It's Andie's.

1182
01:20:43,114 --> 01:20:44,874
God.

1183
01:20:44,909 --> 01:20:48,878
It says organic garlic
and black pepper.
Is that for vampires too?

1184
01:20:48,913 --> 01:20:51,087
You know,
I'll take my chances.

1185
01:20:51,122 --> 01:20:52,606
You know what works
really well?

1186
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:54,573
Standing next
to a woman.What?

1187
01:20:54,608 --> 01:20:56,161
I don't
know what it is,

1188
01:20:56,196 --> 01:20:57,473
but their blood is
different or something.

1189
01:20:57,507 --> 01:20:59,337
But women are like fly paper,
did you ever notice that?

1190
01:20:59,371 --> 01:21:00,890
I don't know,
every time I'm with Andie

1191
01:21:00,925 --> 01:21:02,133
she complains
about getting bitten.

1192
01:21:02,167 --> 01:21:04,652
Yeah. See.I only do when
I'm by myself.

1193
01:21:04,687 --> 01:21:07,966
Pretty soon that'll
be the only advantage to
a heterosexual relationship.

1194
01:21:19,288 --> 01:21:21,290
I like Andie by the way,
a lot.

1195
01:21:22,947 --> 01:21:24,189
Me too.

1196
01:21:25,432 --> 01:21:26,674
You like Vicky?

1197
01:21:27,952 --> 01:21:28,918
Yeah.

1198
01:21:30,437 --> 01:21:31,679
But?

1199
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:35,856
Nothing.

1200
01:21:39,618 --> 01:21:41,103
We're thinking
of getting married.

1201
01:21:42,794 --> 01:21:44,175
Really?

1202
01:21:45,866 --> 01:21:48,144
It's a '97 Barolo,
by the way.

1203
01:21:55,220 --> 01:21:56,566
How old is the kid?

1204
01:22:02,952 --> 01:22:04,954
He's eight.

1205
01:22:04,989 --> 01:22:06,093
Who is the father?

1206
01:22:07,508 --> 01:22:11,581
Not me. Some doctor,
I don't know who.
You wouldn't know him.

1207
01:22:11,616 --> 01:22:13,549
You like him?The kid?

1208
01:22:16,793 --> 01:22:17,967
He's a nice kid.

1209
01:22:22,351 --> 01:22:23,766
Congratulations.

1210
01:22:30,324 --> 01:22:33,327
So, where is
he this weekend?

1211
01:22:33,362 --> 01:22:35,605
Jake is with his dad.

1212
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:37,573
That's crazy.
I mean it's not...

1213
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:42,681
Crazy, but it's just...

1214
01:22:42,716 --> 01:22:45,477
You know, I... I never
would have guessed.

1215
01:22:45,512 --> 01:22:46,547
Well.

1216
01:22:47,548 --> 01:22:49,447
I had him when I
was younger than you.

1217
01:22:51,483 --> 01:22:52,829
Would it be okay...

1218
01:22:54,866 --> 01:22:58,180
Is it, is it weird if
I asked you what happened
with your marriage or...

1219
01:23:00,113 --> 01:23:01,942
No.

1220
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:03,979
What happened.
What didn't happen.

1221
01:23:05,773 --> 01:23:08,052
You want my professional,
or my personal opinion?

1222
01:23:10,433 --> 01:23:11,779
I want professional.

1223
01:23:13,505 --> 01:23:15,369
Okay. Um...

1224
01:23:17,923 --> 01:23:19,787
Where do I start?

1225
01:23:22,169 --> 01:23:24,447
Michael and I,
we were...

1226
01:23:26,449 --> 01:23:27,657
Madly in love.

1227
01:23:29,556 --> 01:23:31,799
We thought that that
meant we were strong.

1228
01:23:31,834 --> 01:23:33,560
And we decided
to have a child.

1229
01:23:35,838 --> 01:23:37,874
And it's the most
amazing thing.

1230
01:23:37,909 --> 01:23:39,048
Starting a family.

1231
01:23:42,534 --> 01:23:44,916
But you have to create space.

1232
01:23:44,950 --> 01:23:46,400
Like, literally

1233
01:23:46,435 --> 01:23:47,643
create space.

1234
01:23:49,403 --> 01:23:52,096
So, all of a sudden, there's
this little person and he's
sleeping in bed with you.

1235
01:23:53,166 --> 01:23:54,788
It's like adding
another lover.

1236
01:23:54,822 --> 01:23:57,446
Sounds like Seth's dream.

1237
01:23:57,480 --> 01:23:58,999
Hey there,
it can be.

1238
01:24:01,967 --> 01:24:04,039
There's just so much
that changes that you

1239
01:24:05,868 --> 01:24:07,594
could not predict
before you have kids.

1240
01:24:10,217 --> 01:24:11,356
You know, like...

1241
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:18,467
You can't give each other
the same amount of love.

1242
01:24:20,227 --> 01:24:23,023
It's weird. Like your
love gets divided.

1243
01:24:27,993 --> 01:24:29,443
We weren't
prepared for that.

1244
01:24:33,033 --> 01:24:34,172
And I think we just...

1245
01:24:37,106 --> 01:24:39,729
Couldn't accept that
there was some part

1246
01:24:40,730 --> 01:24:42,525
of our relationship
that died.

1247
01:24:50,361 --> 01:24:52,156
And then resentment
sets in, and...

1248
01:24:53,191 --> 01:24:55,124
You get the picture.

1249
01:24:55,159 --> 01:24:56,263
Wow.

1250
01:24:57,575 --> 01:24:59,128
That's your
professional opinion.

1251
01:24:59,163 --> 01:25:00,750
That's my
professional opinion.

1252
01:25:04,168 --> 01:25:06,549
What's your
personal opinion?He was an asshole.

1253
01:25:09,380 --> 01:25:12,141
No. I'm serious.
It was like one morning,

1254
01:25:12,176 --> 01:25:14,902
he just rolls over
and says, "I don't think
I am ready for this."

1255
01:25:16,870 --> 01:25:18,734
For what?Exactly. Like...

1256
01:25:21,150 --> 01:25:23,048
We already have a son.

1257
01:25:23,083 --> 01:25:24,843
You know, what's there
to be ready for?

1258
01:25:30,884 --> 01:25:33,266
Sorry,
I didn't mean to...No.

1259
01:25:34,474 --> 01:25:35,751
You're not the
jerk that left.

1260
01:25:38,995 --> 01:25:40,687
Is that why you went
for like, an older guy,

1261
01:25:40,721 --> 01:25:44,380
because he'd already
been through his
mid-life crisis?

1262
01:25:45,864 --> 01:25:48,798
I guess I am his
mid-life crisis.

1263
01:25:48,833 --> 01:25:52,181
What comes after
the crisis?No, I... I.

1264
01:25:52,216 --> 01:25:53,907
I hadn't thought
of it that way.

1265
01:25:57,669 --> 01:26:00,085
See, this is...

1266
01:26:09,025 --> 01:26:11,511
You're selling the house
so you can take care
of Vicky and the kid?

1267
01:26:15,446 --> 01:26:17,896
Not that simple.

1268
01:26:17,931 --> 01:26:20,209
Long vacations,
pay for tennis lessons.

1269
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:28,010
You never cash
the checks I send you.

1270
01:26:28,044 --> 01:26:29,287
I don't need
your money.

1271
01:26:29,322 --> 01:26:31,600
You didn't seem to
mind taking it to
pay for college.

1272
01:26:35,397 --> 01:26:38,089
So, this is how you
try to make up for it?

1273
01:26:38,123 --> 01:26:39,608
Make up for what?

1274
01:26:39,642 --> 01:26:41,265
How things went with
your first family.

1275
01:26:43,094 --> 01:26:45,614
Why would you say
something like that to me?

1276
01:26:45,648 --> 01:26:47,409
What do you
want me to say?

1277
01:26:47,443 --> 01:26:49,273
You sound just like
your mother.

1278
01:26:49,307 --> 01:26:53,484
God, I am so sick
and tired of being
criticized, judged.

1279
01:26:55,348 --> 01:26:57,557
I just want to enjoy
the rest of my life.

1280
01:26:58,558 --> 01:27:00,836
Did it ever occur to you,
you might be happy for me?

1281
01:27:05,944 --> 01:27:08,223
There wasn't room for
everyone in that family.

1282
01:27:10,742 --> 01:27:12,848
I'm different with Vicky.
I can...

1283
01:27:14,712 --> 01:27:15,782
Relax.

1284
01:27:15,816 --> 01:27:18,647
Actually feel good.
She listens to me.

1285
01:27:18,681 --> 01:27:23,341
There isn't a whole
life of mistakes
and guilt between us.

1286
01:27:26,689 --> 01:27:28,277
Why do we have
to talk about this?

1287
01:27:28,312 --> 01:27:29,623
We were having
such a nice time.

1288
01:27:29,658 --> 01:27:31,694
Do you realize,
this is the most
we've ever talked?

1289
01:27:31,729 --> 01:27:33,317
Well, maybe there is
a reason for that.

1290
01:27:35,871 --> 01:27:37,390
When you have kids,
you will understand.

1291
01:27:38,632 --> 01:27:40,220
Understand what?

1292
01:27:41,842 --> 01:27:43,741
You can't talk
about everything.

1293
01:27:45,950 --> 01:27:46,951
No.

1294
01:28:00,033 --> 01:28:01,379
You know,
if I ever I had kids,

1295
01:28:01,414 --> 01:28:03,347
I was going to turn
this into a hockey rink
in the winters.

1296
01:28:11,216 --> 01:28:13,736
That would have been
a good idea.

1297
01:28:13,771 --> 01:28:15,566
You said this would
always be here.

1298
01:28:16,774 --> 01:28:19,432
I know. That was
a long time ago.

1299
01:28:21,572 --> 01:28:23,332
Things change.

1300
01:28:23,367 --> 01:28:24,989
I have other people
to think about now.

1301
01:28:31,927 --> 01:28:34,067
Do you ever think there's
a difference between
not saying something

1302
01:28:34,101 --> 01:28:35,586
because there's
nothing to say...

1303
01:28:39,175 --> 01:28:40,591
And not saying
something because...

1304
01:28:45,561 --> 01:28:46,976
Well, there's
just too much.

1305
01:29:09,136 --> 01:29:10,690
God. God. What, what, what?

1306
01:29:10,724 --> 01:29:12,450
What happened? What are we
going to do?

1307
01:29:12,485 --> 01:29:14,072
She saw
something.What did you see?

1308
01:29:14,107 --> 01:29:16,903
I don't know.
I just saw a piece,
but it was huge.

1309
01:29:16,937 --> 01:29:19,595
Where were you? She was inside,
getting a glass of water.

1310
01:29:19,630 --> 01:29:22,011
In the house?
Are you sure
you saw something?

1311
01:29:22,046 --> 01:29:23,806
Honey, what is
the matter with you.
We are in danger.

1312
01:29:23,841 --> 01:29:25,221
Well, you said
it was in the house.

1313
01:29:25,256 --> 01:29:26,878
Well,
what if it came outside.
What if there are others.

1314
01:29:26,913 --> 01:29:28,742
Relax, will you.
It's probably
just a raccoon.

1315
01:29:28,777 --> 01:29:30,537
Well, what?
Are you just gonna
leave me here?

1316
01:29:30,572 --> 01:29:32,228
All right. Come on.

1317
01:29:36,094 --> 01:29:38,683
Shh.
I think I hear something.

1318
01:29:38,718 --> 01:29:40,754
You're fucking with us.We are not
fucking with you.

1319
01:29:40,789 --> 01:29:41,962
Probably
just a raccoon.

1320
01:29:41,997 --> 01:29:44,517
It is not
a raccoon.

1321
01:29:57,806 --> 01:29:59,566
It's probably
just a raccoon. It's not a raccoon!

1322
01:29:59,601 --> 01:30:01,223
Holy shit.

1323
01:30:01,257 --> 01:30:02,707
Holy shit!

1324
01:30:02,742 --> 01:30:05,434
That is so cool. My God.

1325
01:30:05,469 --> 01:30:07,540
My God.He's going to make
a fucking mess in there.

1326
01:30:07,574 --> 01:30:10,750
Gil, there is
a bear in our house.

1327
01:30:10,784 --> 01:30:13,408
What are we gonna do?I think we don't do anything.

1328
01:30:16,963 --> 01:30:18,551
What? What?

1329
01:30:18,585 --> 01:30:19,655
I don't...

1330
01:30:22,071 --> 01:30:23,659
Don't knock
that lamp over.

1331
01:30:23,694 --> 01:30:25,212
My God.

1332
01:30:25,247 --> 01:30:27,525
It's probably more scared
of us than we are of it.

1333
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:28,940
I don't think
that's possible.

1334
01:30:28,975 --> 01:30:30,148
Where did it go?

1335
01:30:31,287 --> 01:30:32,461
You think it came outside?

1336
01:30:32,496 --> 01:30:34,083
Well, Gil, don't you have
a gun or something?

1337
01:30:34,118 --> 01:30:35,188
A gun?

1338
01:30:35,222 --> 01:30:36,914
I'm a member of
the Audubon Society.

1339
01:30:36,948 --> 01:30:38,087
Well, can you
call somebody?

1340
01:30:38,122 --> 01:30:39,295
My phone's in the house.

1341
01:30:39,330 --> 01:30:41,125
Well, what are
we gonna do?Just stay calm!

1342
01:30:43,955 --> 01:30:45,094
Everyone,
just stay calm.

1343
01:30:45,129 --> 01:30:47,511
We'll go look in
from the other side
of the house.

1344
01:30:47,545 --> 01:30:49,996
Just... Come on.
It's gonna be fine.
Just be smart.

1345
01:30:52,067 --> 01:30:53,309
Come on.

1346
01:30:55,519 --> 01:30:56,968
Come on!

1347
01:30:57,003 --> 01:30:58,453
Shh! Shh!

1348
01:31:06,564 --> 01:31:09,429
So, we're gonna just keep
walking around trying
to draw its attention?

1349
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:10,637
Just relax.This is insane!

1350
01:31:10,672 --> 01:31:11,845
Just relax.

1351
01:31:23,512 --> 01:31:25,134
What are we doing?

1352
01:31:36,387 --> 01:31:39,908
It's spilling all over
the goddamn wood floor.

1353
01:31:39,942 --> 01:31:42,151
Is there oil in there?

1354
01:31:42,186 --> 01:31:43,428
It's organic.

1355
01:31:43,463 --> 01:31:45,672
Extra virgin, cold pressed... Gil!

1356
01:31:45,707 --> 01:31:47,053
...unrefined.

1357
01:31:47,087 --> 01:31:48,295
What the hell
does that mean?

1358
01:31:49,365 --> 01:31:51,954
It means it's
really green.Fuck!

1359
01:31:51,989 --> 01:31:53,438
Really? These floors
can't be damaged.

1360
01:31:53,473 --> 01:31:55,061
Come on, Gil!What?

1361
01:31:55,095 --> 01:31:56,407
Focus.On what?

1362
01:31:56,441 --> 01:31:58,202
Protecting me
and your child.

1363
01:32:10,076 --> 01:32:11,146
It's...

1364
01:32:12,423 --> 01:32:13,804
Early still.

1365
01:32:15,426 --> 01:32:17,911
I didn't want you
to find out like
this up here.

1366
01:32:17,946 --> 01:32:20,569
Any other children
you failed to mention?

1367
01:32:20,604 --> 01:32:21,950
No, Seth.
Of course not.

1368
01:32:21,984 --> 01:32:24,469
We haven't
told anyone yet.

1369
01:32:24,504 --> 01:32:27,058
You know, you can play
30-year-old all you want.

1370
01:32:27,093 --> 01:32:30,614
You can get a new house.
You can get a new wife.
You can get a new...

1371
01:32:30,648 --> 01:32:32,443
...son, but, I
can't get a new dad.

1372
01:32:32,477 --> 01:32:34,272
I wish I could.

1373
01:32:34,307 --> 01:32:36,620
You know how many
times I've called
you and hung up?

1374
01:32:36,654 --> 01:32:38,276
How many emails I've
written and never sent

1375
01:32:38,311 --> 01:32:39,381
because I knew
you wouldn't respond?

1376
01:32:41,694 --> 01:32:43,247
You think this just
happened to you?

1377
01:32:43,281 --> 01:32:44,904
You think this has
been easy for me?

1378
01:32:44,938 --> 01:32:47,872
That is a total cop out.
You have never done anything
to try to fix anything.

1379
01:32:47,907 --> 01:32:49,184
What would have been
good enough for you?

1380
01:32:49,218 --> 01:32:50,979
There's nothing that would
have been good enough for you.

1381
01:32:51,013 --> 01:32:52,567
Nothing was ever
good enough for you.

1382
01:32:53,809 --> 01:32:55,639
You know, we both
made a choice.

1383
01:32:55,673 --> 01:32:57,606
You didn't choose me
and I didn't choose you.

1384
01:32:57,641 --> 01:32:59,712
And maybe that was a mistake
and maybe it wasn't.

1385
01:33:01,852 --> 01:33:03,232
Fuck it. I'm gonna
go scare this thing
out of there.

1386
01:33:03,267 --> 01:33:05,338
Wait. Wait. Gil. Yeah, that's a real
responsible thing to do

1387
01:33:05,372 --> 01:33:06,719
with a new baby on the way.

1388
01:33:06,753 --> 01:33:08,306
You know, I don't
need a lecture on
responsibility from you.

1389
01:33:08,341 --> 01:33:09,998
You're the reason
the bear's in the
house in the first place.

1390
01:33:10,032 --> 01:33:11,275
How the hell do
you figure that?

1391
01:33:11,309 --> 01:33:12,759
Why do you think we have
a bear-proof garbage can?

1392
01:33:12,794 --> 01:33:15,037
So you can just
throw shit near it and
leave it on the ground?

1393
01:33:15,072 --> 01:33:16,383
Why didn't you leave it
a fucking invitation?

1394
01:33:16,418 --> 01:33:17,592
The trash can was
a mess when we got here.

1395
01:33:17,626 --> 01:33:18,938
I'm the one who
started cleaning it.Yeah.

1396
01:33:18,972 --> 01:33:20,353
And it was what?

1397
01:33:20,387 --> 01:33:22,320
The tooth fairy that
left the wet towels
on the bathroom floor?

1398
01:33:22,355 --> 01:33:23,494
What difference
does it make?

1399
01:33:23,528 --> 01:33:25,116
The house is sold
anyway, right?

1400
01:33:25,151 --> 01:33:26,290
Why not let it
just be a mess?

1401
01:33:26,324 --> 01:33:27,878
Why do you care
if it's sold?
You never come up here.

1402
01:33:27,912 --> 01:33:29,811
You're just waiting
for me to die so
you can have the place.

1403
01:33:29,845 --> 01:33:32,330
I come up here all the time.
I just usually do
a much better job

1404
01:33:32,365 --> 01:33:33,884
of making sure
that I don't run into you.

1405
01:33:33,918 --> 01:33:36,196
Will you guys please stop
acting like children?

1406
01:33:36,231 --> 01:33:38,198
Will you please just
stay out of this, all right?

1407
01:33:38,233 --> 01:33:40,476
We don't need your help.
Stop trying to help.

1408
01:33:40,511 --> 01:33:42,927
That was a $320
German casserole dish.

1409
01:33:42,962 --> 01:33:44,101
Gil.

1410
01:33:44,135 --> 01:33:45,620
What?Do something.

1411
01:33:45,654 --> 01:33:47,069
Hey. If you're so
worried about your
goddamn baby,

1412
01:33:47,104 --> 01:33:48,588
what are you doing
drinking wine?

1413
01:33:48,623 --> 01:33:50,486
It was probably that
vat of syrup that you
spilled all over the deck.

1414
01:33:50,521 --> 01:33:52,109
I didn't spill the syrup.
He did.

1415
01:33:52,143 --> 01:33:54,007
Whose side are
you on anyway? There are no sides.

1416
01:33:54,042 --> 01:33:55,837
No, you please
stay out of this.

1417
01:33:55,871 --> 01:33:56,976
Hey, don't talk
to her like that.

1418
01:33:57,010 --> 01:33:58,909
This isn't her family.It is her family now.

1419
01:34:00,082 --> 01:34:01,428
Shut up! Enough!

1420
01:34:42,849 --> 01:34:43,850
Shit.

1421
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,277
I'll put this
in the trash.

1422
01:35:48,432 --> 01:35:49,813
What you doing
in here?

1423
01:35:54,921 --> 01:35:56,371
Just looking around.

1424
01:35:58,097 --> 01:36:00,099
It's held up
pretty well,
hasn't it?

1425
01:36:00,133 --> 01:36:01,756
Yeah.

1426
01:36:06,830 --> 01:36:09,073
So, why the hell did
you wanna come up
here this weekend?

1427
01:36:11,386 --> 01:36:12,387
I...

1428
01:36:16,978 --> 01:36:19,981
I wanted to maybe
talk to Andie
about getting married.

1429
01:36:24,364 --> 01:36:25,745
And then I showed up

1430
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:30,025
and spoiled all the fun.

1431
01:36:34,374 --> 01:36:36,756
I don't think I can
actually blame you
for this one.

1432
01:36:39,863 --> 01:36:41,830
Well.

1433
01:36:44,488 --> 01:36:45,800
I'm sure you'll...

1434
01:36:48,147 --> 01:36:49,389
Work it out.

1435
01:36:54,049 --> 01:36:56,086
There's no reason
to rush into anything,
you know.

1436
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:58,364
There's plenty of time.

1437
01:36:58,398 --> 01:37:00,849
I wish somebody
had told me that
when I was...

1438
01:37:01,988 --> 01:37:03,162
Your age.

1439
01:37:05,198 --> 01:37:06,751
It goes on and on.

1440
01:37:17,901 --> 01:37:19,350
Watch your step there.

1441
01:38:31,595 --> 01:38:33,321
Gil, thanks
for having us.

1442
01:38:33,355 --> 01:38:34,494
It was nice meeting you.

1443
01:38:36,151 --> 01:38:38,843
And, um,
nice meeting you.

1444
01:38:38,878 --> 01:38:40,052
Thanks.

1445
01:38:41,950 --> 01:38:45,229
Seth, it was great,
finally, to meet you.Yep.

1446
01:38:45,264 --> 01:38:46,955
And spend some time.

1447
01:38:46,990 --> 01:38:48,060
Yeah.

1448
01:38:50,614 --> 01:38:51,615
All right.

1449
01:38:54,031 --> 01:38:56,413
Here, here, here.
Take some...

1450
01:38:56,447 --> 01:38:57,966
Take some gas money.

1451
01:39:01,314 --> 01:39:02,419
I don't need any money.

1452
01:39:04,697 --> 01:39:05,940
Let me give you
some gas money.

1453
01:39:09,012 --> 01:39:10,392
I don't need that.

1454
01:39:10,427 --> 01:39:12,498
I know you don't
need it, but...

1455
01:39:12,532 --> 01:39:13,671
I'm giving it to you.

1456
01:39:26,063 --> 01:39:27,271
Thank you.
