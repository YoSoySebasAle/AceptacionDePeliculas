1
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:55,157
Goddamn bunch of cutthroats.

2
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:58,415
Oh, shit.

3
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,505
Boy, they'd leave me
belly-up out here

4
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,970
if they knew
I was getting ready to run.

5
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:12,053
- Don't you make a noise when you walk?
- Uh-uh.

6
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:14,476
Hey, wait a minute.

7
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:16,846
You got yourself all done up, Ruby.

8
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,472
- What are you up to?
- Here.

9
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,058
Oh, no you don't.
Uh-uh.

10
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:23,185
Ain't no trading today, Ruby.

11
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,732
And not no more, neither.

12
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:28,024
You folks gone too far.

13
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,525
Trooper been snooping around.

14
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,323
Air Force been through here twice.

15
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:35,744
You folks have to go rob a goddamn
Air Force PX for God's sakes.

16
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,161
We're hungry.

17
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,250
No one comes through
back there anymore.

18
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,040
What did you get?

19
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,506
Whiskey and radios.
I ain't got nothing to eat.

20
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:50,095
I'm sorry, Ruby.
I know you're starving,

21
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:52,431
but I ain't got
nothing else to trade.

22
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:57,223
I got no more gas,
no more cartridges, no more food.

23
00:02:57,344 --> 00:03:00,063
And the folks in Corn Creek
have cut me off already.

24
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,808
They even talked of
blocking off this whole section

25
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,685
and marching
the National Guard through,

26
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,778
see what they can find.

27
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,398
You coyotes better watch
your p's and q's for a spell.

28
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:12,823
- Take me with you.
- What?

29
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:16,368
So that's it.
You want to get out.

30
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:21,665
Do you think you could pass out there
with the regular folks?

31
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,504
You don't know a knife and fork
from your five fingers.

32
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,840
And you stink like a horse.

33
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,675
You're getting out.
You take me, too.

34
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,544
Does the pack know you're doing this?

35
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,342
Does Jupiter know?

36
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,557
Why, he'd cut you to pieces
if I told him you were going over the hill.

37
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:40,554
If my pa knew you was getting out,
he'd rip your lungs out.

38
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:43,353
- Hello? Anybody around?
- Get in here.

39
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,895
That'll be the State Troopers.

40
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:49,112
They'll toss you in jail and throw the key
up a wild sow's ass and holler, "Suey!"

41
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,903
Well, I'll take a look around.
I don't see any...

42
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,991
Didn't hear you.
I was just cleaning up.

43
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,952
Fill it up and check the oil and water.

44
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,915
Give you what I got. Ain't got much.
I'm just closing down.

45
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,414
Morning.

46
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,927
Don't you mind them,
they just want to play.

47
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,592
Beauty, get down in there.
Down now!

48
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,808
That's... That's a good girl.

49
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,016
Odd.

50
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,011
I'm telling you,
we're in the middle of nowhere.

51
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,605
Yeah, I wonder how far it is
to the nearest cheeseburger.

52
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,191
We don't usually get folk up this way.
Where you heading?

53
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:28,686
California. L.A.

54
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,484
Movie stars and fancy cars.

55
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,448
California?

56
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,193
You sure <i>as</i> hell
off the beaten track for that.

57
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,867
Yeah, well, we're just making a stop
around here first.

58
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,739
You know this place around here?
The desert?

59
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:41,990
Why?

60
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,914
- You got a bathroom around here?
- Yeah, round in back. Round in back.

61
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,413
I need to make a litter dump.
You got a place to throw some trash?

62
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:51,542
Oh hell. Use the whole damn desert
for all I care.

63
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,839
Oh, I'm sorry, Bob.
Do you have your key?

64
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,086
Good.

65
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,135
How are my two baby girls doing?

66
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,056
Fabulous.

67
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,148
Hey piggy, piggy-

68
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,710
So, anyway, we thought
we'd take a little detour and go see it.

69
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,125
It's supposed to be a real silver mine.

70
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,374
Well, anyway,
that's why I was asking.

71
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:34,923
You see, it's my Aunt Mildred's gift
to Bob and me on our silver anniversary,

72
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,545
and that's tomorrow.

73
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,389
Lady, they ain't no silver left
back in there.

74
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,976
Besides, the Air Force uses part of this
as a gunnery range.

75
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:48,603
You folks just forget that foolishness
and go onto California.

76
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,610
- That'll be $6.80.
- OK.

77
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,157
- I've got no change.
- Oh, that figures.

78
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,117
- Detective, huh?
- That's right.

79
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,453
Bob just retired from the police force.

80
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,538
He had to a little early
because of his heart.

81
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:06,078
Referring to Strike Creek Road.
Do you know where it is?

82
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,998
Look, Mister, don't take your family
back in there.

83
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:12,214
The silver's been gone 40 years now.

84
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,583
Besides, there's nothing back in there
but animals.

85
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:18,133
Animals?
You mean nobody lives back there?

86
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,756
Nobody you'd want to meet, lady,
believe me.

87
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:25,219
See? There's nothing back here.

88
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,897
Jeeze!
Look at this place.

89
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:30,982
What's the matter'?

90
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,567
See something?

91
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:35,938
Ugh!

92
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,699
- What?
- Mercury!

93
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:43,116
<i>I didn't do anything wrong.
I just came to trade.</i>

94
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,159
<i>Grandpa Freddy,
he says he's running away.</i>

95
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,408
Shh! Big mouth.

96
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,455
<i>Let's go,.</i>

97
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,704
Come here. Come here.

98
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,877
Hold it. Come here. Shh!

99
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,093
Come on, Doug.

100
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:06,309
Come on.
He must have some animals back there.

101
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,303
Shh.

102
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,226
There's nothing, dummy.

103
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,813
Come on. Come on.

104
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:18,238
Come on.

105
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,543
Yeah, you'd better check
your grandchildren there, Mister.

106
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,754
I think one of them's cut himself
on the window back there.

107
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,919
- I'll check it. Thanks.
- That's OK.

108
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:43,343
You folks go right to California
and have a good trip.

109
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,812
You folks stay on the main road now,
you hear?

110
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,602
Stay on the main road!

111
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,132
Let's get out of here.

112
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:30,678
What the fuck?

113
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,482
Oh, Lord.

114
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,400
There'll be hell to pay now.

115
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,630
Jupiter. Papa.

116
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,842
<i>Papa Hunter, identify.</i>

117
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,006
Mama. Pluto.

118
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,800
You see a station wagon and a trailer?

119
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,888
That's what Mercury said,</i>

120
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,008
<i>if you can believe him.</i>

121
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,135
They coming.

122
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:19,067
We're lost. The old creep told you
not to get off the road.

123
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:23,280
The old bastard probably snuck up here
and ripped off our mine

124
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,319
and that's why
he doesn't want us up here.

125
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,068
We'll be French fries,
human French fries.

126
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,992
We are not going to be French fries.

127
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,740
We're right here someplace
on this little blue road.

128
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:38,124
Mother, this road is not a blue line.

129
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,338
It's a dotted line if it's on the map at all.

130
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,502
<i>Oh, Jesus.</i>

131
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:50,970
Nellie Air Force Base Nuclear Testing Site,
closed to the public.

132
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,468
Holy shit, Daddy!

133
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,471
All right, everybody shuts up.
That's it.

134
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:57,476
Man alive.

135
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:01,318
We're not on a bomb range
and we're not goddamn lost.

136
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,983
And we are...

137
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,911
Jesus Christ on a crutch,
what was that?

138
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,500
Daddy, slow down a little bit, will you?

139
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,038
Daddy, we're going to lose the trailer.

140
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,714
Daddy, Mum is...!

141
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,344
Bob, watch!

142
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,610
You guys
and your stupid silver mine.

143
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,077
Doug, are you OK?

144
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,447
Open the door.
I think the door is jammed.

145
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,791
Why don't you try unlocking it, creep?

146
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,205
Oh, I got it.

147
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,876
- Are you OK?
- I'm all right.

148
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:13,557
I feel like I've just been through
my first California earthquake.

149
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,301
- How's the baby?
- She's fine. Mum's got her.

150
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:17,678
I think we were lucky.

151
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,476
- My finches OK?
- Aren't you even going to ask how I am?

152
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,349
Oh, get out of my life, Bobby.

153
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:25,397
- Look, I'm wounded.
- What is it'?

154
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,316
It's just ketchup, folks.

155
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,360
Look out.

156
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,862
Oh, you're so stupid.

157
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,707
Twenty-five years I'm a cop

158
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,707
in the worst goddamn precinct
in Cleveland.

159
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,375
Niggers shoot arrows at me

160
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,470
and the hillbillies throw dogs
off the roofs at me.

161
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:57,843
I'm even shot at on two separate
occasions by my own men,

162
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,811
but none of these bastards
ever come as close to killing me

163
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:05,480
<i>as</i> my own goddamn wife and her
goddamn road maps and her wrong turns

164
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,228
and her goddamn
hysterical screaming and her...

165
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,900
Watch your language.

166
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:14,651
You watch your heart, too.
You know what Dr Springer said.

167
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:19,373
Dr Springer can take his stethoscope
and shove it...

168
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,959
into his little black bag sideways.

169
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,803
It's a turkey buzzard.

170
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,473
It's the janitor of the desert.

171
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,766
Does that mean there's a town nearby?

172
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:46,603
Like when sailors spot a bird at sea
and know they're near land?

173
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,192
Yeah.

174
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,399
No.

175
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,816
So pretty.

176
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,652
Pretty girl.

177
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,997
Threw the hitch right off the back.

178
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,458
What's the verdict, big fella?

179
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:52,583
- Well, the goddamn axle snapped.
- Oh no.

180
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,463
Forget it. Forget it.

181
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,382
What do we do now?

182
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,254
We walk, baby.

183
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:04,473
You know, Marlon Perkins says that
rattlesnakes can reach lengths of 20 feet

184
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:06,312
and can kill you in eight minutes.

185
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:12,770
Then you better not shoot
until you see the whites of their fangs, son.

186
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:16,194
- Or was it eight feet and 20 minutes?
- Oh, Ma.

187
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,032
Thank goodness
the boys at the precinct

188
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,652
presented me with this howitzer
when I retired.

189
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:25,123
Sure wouldn't want to go looking
for those pythons without it.

190
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:29,790
If it's all the same to you, Bob Carter,
I'll put my faith in the good Lord

191
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:34,508
and a little gunpowder
rather than coyotes and rattlesnakes.

192
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,501
This place must be crawling with them.

193
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:39,004
Well, Katy's taking this all calmly.

194
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,223
You OK?

195
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:45,518
I hate it out here.

196
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,683
It's just uncomfortable. That's all.

197
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,647
It's more than uncomfortable.

198
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:57,697
Lynne, honey,
would you get rne my jacket, please?

199
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,201
What is it?

200
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,698
Nothing.

201
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:52,123
I don't get it.
Why can't we raise anybody on the CB?

202
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:53,244
Here.

203
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,212
It looks to me like
these hills are full of iron,

204
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,832
and if that's the case, you're not
going to get a radio signal past them.

205
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,129
Would you hold this please?

206
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,376
I'm going to head North,

207
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:03,129
something on the map that looks like
a military installation here.

208
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:04,471
OK, fine.

209
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,307
You ought to have a gun too, Doug.

210
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:09,974
We only have two guns, and I think
one of them ought to stay with you guys.

211
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:13,348
All right, Doug. You walk out
six or seven miles and get back.

212
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,067
I'll walk out as far as the old geezer's
service station, and...

213
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:18,903
You can't get there
and back before dark.

214
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,647
It's only 15 miles back.

215
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,569
Sweetheart, I'll get there about sundown.

216
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,864
If the old guy's there, I'll borrow his pickup.
If he's not there, I'll borrow his phone.

217
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,783
But what if the old jerk
doesn't have a phone?

218
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:29,952
- Then I'll pawn it.
- Daddy, don't.

219
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:33,372
Look, you stay close to the trailer,
and don't bust Bobby's chops.

220
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:36,167
- He is in charge.
- That creep isn't in charge of me.

221
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:40,337
Hey! Another outburst like that,
and I'll confine you to quarters.

222
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:44,171
All right, men,
synchronise the watches. It's 3:38.

223
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:47,469
If you're not back by midnight, we'll
have to board the submarine without you.

224
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,388
Can we have a word of prayer first?

225
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,638
- Oh, mother, for crying in a bucket.
- Brenda!

226
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:55,606
Just to ask the Lord to watch over us all.

227
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:59,310
Is that too much to ask?

228
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:01,900
Bob?

229
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:11,873
Heavenly Father, watch over us
for the rest of this day.

230
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,367
Keep us in thy care in Jesus' name.

231
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:15,914
Amen.

232
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,753
So long, troops.

233
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,807
<i>Pluto?</i>

234
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:33,098
They stuck good,
easy pickings now.

235
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:55,454
Beauty! Come here, girl.

236
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,831
Come on, Beauty.
Come on, Beauty.

237
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,339
Beauty.
Come on, Beauty.

238
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,800
Come on, girl. Let's go.

239
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,261
Well, at least it's cooler now.

240
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,472
- Oh, bring some plates would you, Bob?
- Sure.

241
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,515
- It is cooler, isn't it?
- Oh, yeah. Fantastic!

242
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,854
Now we'll all freeze to death.

243
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:21,272
This is a great way to spend the eve
of your 25th wedding anniversary.

244
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:23,269
Frozen French fries.

245
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,772
A huge clump of human French fries

246
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:29,992
was found stuck to a camper trailer
this morning by...

247
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,861
But who'd ever find us?

248
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:34,205
Well, it's kind of a pretty place.

249
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:36,745
There's certainly plenty of the sunshine
and fresh air.

250
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,710
- This much fresh air's unhealthy.
- Oh, it's good for you.

251
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,501
It makes me want to puke,
if you really want to know.

252
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,420
It gives me the creeps.

253
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,339
I suppose it's my fault we got lost.

254
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,053
Mother, don't be ridiculous.

255
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,219
It was Daddy's idea to go looking
around for this mine without any help.

256
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,640
We'd be in California by now
if we'd stayed on the interstate.

257
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,263
Showers and gin and tonics.

258
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,310
- The beach.
- Fresh clothes.

259
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,895
I wonder what's bugging her?

260
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,614
Maybe there's some rattlesnakes
prowling around.

261
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:12,486
You know what Freud would say about
your obsession with rattlesnakes, Ma?

262
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,990
I wonder why the beast isn't chiming in.

263
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,162
Beast never barks
until he's ready for the kill.

264
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,377
He likes to catch his victims unawares.

265
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,874
Hey, you know you're right.
Remember that poodle he killed in Miami?

266
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:29,218
- Do I?
- Oh boy, was that lady ever fit to be tied.

267
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,053
Was Daddy ever mad.

268
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,798
He had to pay vet bills
for a dead poodle.

269
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,387
All right, creep, what's your story'?

270
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:40,684
Brenda, don't.

271
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,183
Beauty!

272
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,059
Beauty, get back here!

273
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,065
Beauty!

274
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,234
Bobby!

275
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,452
Beauty!

276
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,332
Here, Beauty.

277
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,797
Here, Beauty.
Come here. Come here, girl.

278
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,008
Beauty!

279
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:13,554
Hey, pig, come here.

280
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,218
Beauty, come here.

281
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,735
Beauty!

282
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,495
Beauty!

283
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,240
Hey, girl.

284
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:27,036
Beauty!

285
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,807
Bobby!

286
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,015
Do you hear him answer?

287
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,308
No.

288
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:52,479
Bobby, come down.

289
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:59,068
Bobby, come down.

290
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,168
Beauty?

291
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:40,652
<i>You folks
stay on the main road now, you hear?</i>

292
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,913
<i>Stay on the main road.</i>

293
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:47,033
<i>Nothing out there but animals.</i>

294
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,283
<i>Animals.</i>

295
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:51,128
<i>Animals. Animals.</i>

296
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,402
Ooh...

297
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:26,994
- Here.
- Oh, thanks.

298
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,458
It must have dropped 20 degrees
in the last hour.

299
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:32,753
God, I thought I was out.

300
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,714
Hello. Testing.

301
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,425
Hello'? Anybody there?

302
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,920
Testing, testing.

303
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:44,174
Maypole, maypole, maypole, maypole.

304
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:46,972
This is Mama Bear Carter calling.

305
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,766
Do any of you bears have your ears up?

306
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:55,605
Gosh, I can't seem to remember
how this works.

307
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:59,026
- It's 'mayday', Mum, not 'maypole'.
- Hmm?

308
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,069
- Mayday.
- Oh.

309
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:04,615
- Did you put it on battery?
- Mm-hmm.

310
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,783
Well, here, let me.

311
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,790
Mayday, mayday.

312
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:13,628
This is mobile unit 2345 CB.

313
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,834
<i>We are stranded and in need of help.</i>

314
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,924
<i>Do you COPY?</i>

315
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,644
What the hell was that?

316
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,973
It sounded like some sort of animal.

317
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:41,231
Yeah, well, animals around here
are smart enough to run radios,

318
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:43,858
we're up shit creek without a paddle.

319
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:47,203
You know you never used
language like that

320
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,492
before you moved to New York City.

321
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,661
Where's Bobby and the men, anyway?

322
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,103
Brenda?

323
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:26,192
Brenda?

324
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,115
Bobby!

325
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:36,164
Beast, come back here.

326
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:40,164
Beast.

327
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:43,876
Bobby'?

328
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:47,050
Brenda'? You there?

329
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:50,592
Just a minute, Lynne.

330
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,267
Bobby'?

331
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:13,447
Bobby'?

332
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:24,291
How does this damn thing work anyway?

333
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:32,932
Bobby'?

334
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:44,562
Bobby, where have you been?

335
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,865
Bobby, your face...
What happened?

336
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,743
Bobby'?

337
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:46,772
Get your stupid neck out of that belt,
you jackass.

338
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,822
Should have left you hanging
after you took a shot at me.

339
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:57,532
Not until you tell me
what the hell is going on.

340
00:28:57,653 --> 00:29:01,783
You're trespassing, that's what.
Give me that.

341
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:05,502
You always try to stop trespassers
by hanging yourself?

342
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:08,543
I thought you was somebody else.

343
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,674
- How's your family?
- Well...

344
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,715
The car skidded off the road,
we broke an axle.

345
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,088
They're back at the trailer.
They're all OK.

346
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:19,308
Like hell they are.
Give me that booze.

347
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:22,268
There's something
you should know about.

348
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:24,559
Yeah, well, what is it?

349
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:29,105
Come on, Beast.

350
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,864
Daddy and Doug back yet?

351
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:37,076
Not yet.

352
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,069
Didn't you find Beauty?

353
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:42,657
She must have run off.

354
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,083
Give me that.

355
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:50,418
Come on, Beast.

356
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,758
Come on sweetheart...

357
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:07,269
Back in '29,
this place was spanking new,

358
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:10,984
and me and my wife Martha
had a little baby girl

359
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:13,980
so pretty and good,
we couldn't believe,

360
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:16,402
and another kid on the way.

361
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:21,780
But when Martha had this one,
something went wrong.

362
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:26,124
This thing she give me,
something happened.

363
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:30,254
He was so big...

364
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:36,214
He came out sideways
and almost tore poor Martha apart.

365
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:41,469
He weighed 20 pounds
and was hairy as a monkey.

366
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:44,059
When he was 10 years old,

367
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:47,271
he was big as I was.

368
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,475
Accidents were happening all the time.

369
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,728
Dogs falling in the well.

370
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,446
I even found chickens
with their heads bit off.

371
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,736
Then in August of '39,

372
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,531
I was in town getting supplies,

373
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:04,825
and the whole damn house
burned to the ground.

374
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,330
My little baby girl was a cinder
when I found her,

375
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:12,455
but this monster kid
wasn't even singed.

376
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:13,751
I knew he'd done it.

377
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:17,968
I hit him with a tyre iron,
and I split his face wide open.

378
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,462
How bad was it?

379
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,134
I thought I'd killed him.

380
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:27,977
I was afraid they'd come
and take me away,

381
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:31,474
so I took him out in the desert
and I left him there.

382
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,523
I figured if he wasn't dead,

383
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:38,523
he couldn't live more than two hours
out there in that heat.

384
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:40,858
Then it would all be over with.

385
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,701
And you think his ghost
is still trying to track you?

386
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:45,537
That was a long time ago.

387
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:48,908
Long enough for him to steal
a whore that nobody would miss.

388
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:52,536
Long enough to raise a passel
of wild kids.

389
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:56,507
Long enough for a devil kid
to grow up to be a devil man.

390
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:07,555
What the hell is this?

391
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,519
That's just some stuff that I...

392
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:12,416
You want some cheese on this?
There's plenty left.

393
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,785
I don't want anything.

394
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,583
What's the matter,
don't you feel well?

395
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:19,297
I'm just not hungry.

396
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:22,293
- Your face still bothering you?
- No.

397
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:26,342
- Did anybody try to CB while I was gone?
- We tried.

398
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:28,636
We tried. Nothing...

399
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:35,181
Well, one time we got something
that sounded an Epstein caller.

400
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:36,932
What do you mean?

401
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:41,608
Well, it sounded sort of like
heavy breathing, didn't it, Mum?

402
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,491
It, er... it was static.

403
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,361
İt wasn't.

404
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:54,871
What was that?

405
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:22,645
Aw, Jesus.

406
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,856
What's going on?

407
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:46,051
Mummy!

408
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,511
Daddy!

409
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,551
Help me!

410
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:53,095
Daddy!

411
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,890
Bogeyman get me!

412
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:59,606
Daddy!

413
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:01,191
You son of a bitch!

414
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,908
Faster. Faster.

415
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:16,623
Mummy, Daddy.
Faster.

416
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,742
Your chest hurt?
Faster. Faster.

417
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,209
Looks like Daddy
going to fall down.

418
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,501
Over here.

419
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:30,470
Over here.

420
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,139
Here.

421
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,770
Daddy all gone?

422
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,276
Daddy all gone?

423
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:01,702
Pluto.

424
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,045
- <i>Papa Jupe?</i>
- Papa Jupe.

425
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:07,795
We about ready.

426
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,230
Hey-

427
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,659
You mind pointing that thing
somewhere else?

428
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:36,403
Oh.

429
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,829
Thank you.

430
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:45,250
It gets cold out there.

431
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:51,634
Here, I brought you a present.

432
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:56,764
What's the matter with you?

433
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:00,560
Well, for one thing,
Dad's not back yet.

434
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:02,645
Oh, hell.

435
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,639
I wouldn't expect him this early.

436
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:07,233
He had a lot further to go than I did.

437
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,148
Besides, it's slow-going out there.

438
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:11,021
Where are the dogs?

439
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:14,867
Beast broke his chain about
an hour ago and he ran off.

440
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:16,860
Oh, yeah?

441
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,320
And Beauty...

442
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,998
Well...

443
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:24,334
- Beauty, sh...
- It's Doug.

444
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:25,919
Hey!

445
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,378
Doug's back!

446
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:30,419
I knew when you smelled food
you'd show up!

447
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,713
He-Y, gorgeous.

448
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,928
Get out of here.

449
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:37,802
- How you doing?
- Did you find anything?

450
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,425
Oh, yeah. Lots of stuff.
There's, er...

451
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:44,475
I found a tower and a dump
about five miles out of here.

452
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,598
All kinds of good stuff.
Look at this!

453
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:50,444
Look at all of this. I mean, it's no wonder
we're paying higher taxes.

454
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,937
They're throwing this stuff away.

455
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,735
Did you go any further?
Did you find any people?

456
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:56,529
Oh, no. There's no people.

457
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:59,448
And I couldn't go any further
because the road just stops right there.

458
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:01,162
Just ended right there.

459
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,782
- Is there any food left? I am so hungry.
- Oh, come and get it.

460
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:05,750
- Come on.
- OK.

461
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:07,084
Listen, we got to go out there

462
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:09,580
'cause there's enough stuff
to open an army surplus store,

463
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,456
honest to God.

464
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:14,926
Ma?

465
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:25,697
What's the matter?
You don't like dog anymore?

466
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,871
I like it.

467
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:34,294
Maybe dog's too good
for a runaway slut like you.

468
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:37,042
The dog's ghost
is talking out there tonight.

469
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:48,979
Another dog.

470
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,312
Great big stud.

471
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:57,146
Mama.

472
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,147
Mama?

473
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:01,195
Let me come inside?

474
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,193
Mama?

475
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:05,616
Goodies around here...

476
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:10,241
...means he ain't around there.

477
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:12,243
Where?

478
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:14,791
Never you mind.

479
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:47,279
Bobby? Come on in.

480
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,405
Don't catch a cold.

481
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:59,298
- Are you sure you're all right?
- I'm fine.

482
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,964
OK.

483
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,931
Don't lock that too hard, old bean,
we're going out in a second.

484
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:18,776
- Hey, where you going?
- The sack.

485
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,942
I don't think you should sleep
in the station wagon tonight.

486
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:25,408
- Why not?
- Look, sleep in here on the floor.

487
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:28,369
- What are you, nuts?
- Look, Doug, I've got to talk to you.

488
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,577
- All set?
- Yeah. All set.

489
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:37,996
Hey. I guarantee you
that he'll be back here by 9:30.

490
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,249
Bobby's worried that rattlesnakes
are going to get Big Bob.

491
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:43,502
- It isn't that.
- Hey.

492
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:48,006
You better worry about what Big Bob
will do to the rattlesnakes.

493
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:49,348
Come on, you.

494
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:52,515
<i>Uh...</i>

495
00:41:55,888 --> 00:42:01,941
Listen. if he's not back here by 11 o'clock,
we'll go out and meet him, OK?

496
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,984
Sleep well.

497
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:09,344
I'm scared.

498
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,382
Beast?

499
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,647
Beast?

500
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:58,283
Beast! Come here, boy!
Come on!

501
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:11,668
Beast?

502
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:27,524
Ugh!

503
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,857
Beast?

504
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:37,076
Beast?

505
00:45:37,193 --> 00:45:38,570
Hey, boy.

506
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:42,448
Come here, boy.

507
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:48,579
<i>Just...</i>

508
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,087
Come on.

509
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:04,604
Ugh! Ha...

510
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,913
Stupid...

511
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,310
Jesus!

512
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:37,237
What do you want?

513
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:59,836
I mean, the amount of privacy we get
on this trip has been zero.

514
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:03,510
I'm not the one knocking on windows
in the middle of the night.

515
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,642
All right, this better be good.

516
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:14,521
- I need your keys.
- Oh, for crying out loud!

517
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:16,940
I locked myself out.

518
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:23,573
- Couldn't you wait?
- Goddamnit! Give me the keys, please!

519
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:36,922
Look, something weird
is going on around here.

520
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:38,461
Dad's not back yet.

521
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:42,086
You said that you heard heavy breathing
on the CB,

522
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:44,589
and now Beast is out there
barking like he's hurt.

523
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:47,550
Oh, Bobby, it's probably Beauty.

524
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:51,020
She always sounds like that
when she barks.

525
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:02,114
- Beauty is dead.
- What?

526
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:04,984
She's been dead since this afternoon.

527
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:06,986
Beauty's dead?

528
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:10,160
What happened?
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

529
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:12,875
I tried.

530
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:18,831
When I found her she'd been gutted.

531
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,799
Somebody slit her.

532
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,133
It was pretty bad.

533
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:26,343
I... I was so scared, I ran away.

534
00:49:27,006 --> 00:49:28,553
OK.

535
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:32,178
You just hold on right here.
I'll get a flashlight, and we'll take a look.

536
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:37,517
OK. Hang on.
Come on, come on.

537
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,439
- You stay here.
- I will not stay here.

538
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,441
<i>Do 'u.</i>

539
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:49,370
Oh, my God!

540
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:51,785
Oh, God. Ethel!

541
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:54,284
Help me, Ethel!

542
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:58,038
Oh, God! Help rne!

543
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:00,915
- Ethel, don't go out there.
- Let me go!

544
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,759
- Ma!
- Put it out!

545
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,388
Brenda?

546
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:15,680
Brenda?
Keep an eye on the baby, OK?

547
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:19,312
Oh, my God!

548
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,527
Ethel!

549
00:50:21,644 --> 00:50:24,773
Help me, Ethel! Help me!

550
00:50:24,897 --> 00:50:27,400
Papa Jupiter.
This here is Mars.

551
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:29,402
<i>You and Pluto in, Mars?</i>

552
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:31,908
We in, Papa. We in.

553
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:40,962
Help me!

554
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,424
God!

555
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:53,972
Oh, my God!

556
00:50:54,093 --> 00:50:56,312
Ethel!

557
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:55,829
You son of a bitch!

558
00:51:56,864 --> 00:51:58,161
You wait.

559
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:01,205
You wait till you get to be a man.

560
00:52:37,363 --> 00:52:39,661
Baby's fat.

561
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:41,910
You fat.

562
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:44,332
Fat and juicy.

563
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:12,982
Oh, that... that's not my Bob.

564
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:14,950
He needs some water.

565
00:53:15,067 --> 00:53:17,536
He needs some water.
Would you get it, please?

566
00:53:17,653 --> 00:53:19,246
That's not my Bob!

567
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:21,365
That's not my Bob!

568
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:24,084
That's not my Bob!

569
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:26,249
Not my Bob!

570
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:28,498
That's not my Bob!

571
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,624
He wants some water.
No, it's not Bob.

572
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:33,923
Lynne, Lynne, please,
take her to get some water, please.

573
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,512
I'll take you, Mama.

574
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:38,094
And some whiskey and blankets too.

575
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:41,640
- That's not my Bob!
- Whiskey and blankets.

576
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:45,855
You all right, man?

577
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:57,071
What... what are you doing?
Where are you going?

578
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:58,865
You're not my father.

579
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:02,831
I'm going to get those bastards.

580
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:06,619
- Bobby?
- <i>I</i> will.

581
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:25,145
So long, Papa.

582
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:34,898
Women coming, Mars.
Let's get what we came for and get out.

583
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:41,445
- Katy!
- What was that?

584
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:43,322
Oh, Katy!

585
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:46,746
Where the hell are you going
with my baby?

586
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:48,835
Get out of my way, bitch.

587
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:02,266
Get out of here!

588
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:10,641
<i>You...</i>

589
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,927
Take the baby.

590
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:49,054
You better move your ass.

591
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:12,119
I come back for you later, girlie.

592
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:20,302
It's all right...

593
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:27,676
It's all right. It's all right.

594
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:29,269
It's all right, baby. It's all right.

595
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:11,686
Don't go, baby.

596
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:13,646
Don't go away.

597
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:16,521
Don't go away.

598
00:57:34,326 --> 00:57:37,705
OK. OK.

599
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,350
Oh, Jesus!

600
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:56,140
Katy?

601
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:01,979
Get her inside and see to your mum.

602
00:58:04,356 --> 00:58:06,734
Oh, my God.

603
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,786
Why are you doing this?

604
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:18,875
What do you want?

605
00:58:25,377 --> 00:58:27,630
Damn you!

606
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:36,021
Give rne back my baby.

607
00:58:36,805 --> 00:58:38,807
My Catherine.

608
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:48,696
Please.

609
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,998
Come on.

610
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:08,302
Yeah, he's still got a gun.

611
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,889
Yeah, I got bullets.

612
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:19,140
Mercury?
You paying attention, Mercury?

613
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:26,439
You know how to use that thing?
Huh, Mercury?

614
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:29,199
Wait a minute.

615
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:31,910
I see you...
you got something to eat!

616
00:59:32,027 --> 00:59:35,122
We got the goods,
and how, Mercury.

617
00:59:35,864 --> 00:59:39,914
- Is <i>that</i> a <i>baby?</i>
- You be a good, dog, you get some.

618
00:59:40,035 --> 00:59:42,333
<i>Mama Jupi so happy.</i>

619
00:59:42,454 --> 00:59:44,832
Papa Jupi so happy.

620
00:59:45,874 --> 00:59:50,050
Maybe I make a joke like last time
and eat the toes.

621
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:52,764
You think everybody laugh?

622
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:56,556
We always laugh at you, Mercury.

623
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:58,519
Coming through.

624
00:59:58,637 --> 01:00:01,516
OK, Pluto.

625
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:23,253
What?

626
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:26,590
I thought I heard something,
rocks falling.

627
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:32,262
You got rocks in your head, asshole.

628
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:35,382
Let's go.

629
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:03,793
- I heard you tried to run away.
- No, Papa, no.

630
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:06,754
I heard you messing
with Grandpa Fred.

631
01:01:06,872 --> 01:01:11,002
I fixed Grandpa Fred good.

632
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,015
I like fixing people good.

633
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:29,944
Bobby'?

634
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,758
What you got there?

635
01:01:55,879 --> 01:01:58,348
Is that what I think it is?

636
01:01:58,465 --> 01:01:59,762
Oh, yeah.

637
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:03,012
About time we got
some powerful food around here.

638
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:05,639
- We're going to eat it, too.
- Call in Mercury!

639
01:02:05,764 --> 01:02:08,142
- We don't need no watch no more.
- OK, Papa.

640
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:12,897
We caught us a young
Thanksgiving turkey.

641
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:16,483
What we going to do?

642
01:02:16,608 --> 01:02:18,576
They got our food, our ammo,

643
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:21,196
they killed Dad and Lynn
and they got the baby.

644
01:02:21,321 --> 01:02:23,369
And they're going to be back.

645
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:27,752
What are we going to do?

646
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:35,464
She hasn't said a word all night.

647
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:41,091
Mercury don't answer, Papa Ju.

648
01:02:41,216 --> 01:02:43,139
Don't answer?

649
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:45,058
Maybe you don't know
how to work it right.

650
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:47,226
I don't think that's it,
I told you I heard something.

651
01:02:51,351 --> 01:02:54,855
- You heard what?
- I'll go find him.

652
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:04,039
You go do that.

653
01:03:10,996 --> 01:03:14,717
Did you kill them all
like I told you to?

654
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:19,429
Did you kill them all like I said?

655
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:26,098
Such a small place, a trailer.

656
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:30,019
When it's messy, it's so messy.

657
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:32,984
Yeah.

658
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:36,904
Daddy back yet?

659
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:40,692
No, not yet.

660
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:47,453
Where's the kids, back yet?

661
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:52,705
Yeah, Brenda's right here
and Bobby's in the kitchen.

662
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:57,713
Drinking Coke, I bet.

663
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:03,052
Lynn sleep?

664
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:05,975
Yeah.

665
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:10,350
Can I get you anything?

666
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:14,309
Another blanket, can I have one?

667
01:04:14,893 --> 01:04:16,816
It's chilly.

668
01:04:17,729 --> 01:04:21,154
This will keep you warm.
This will keep you nice and warm.

669
01:04:22,317 --> 01:04:24,911
Thank you.

670
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:28,949
Thanks.

671
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:31,751
Oh, no!

672
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:35,418
- Turn the lights on, please.
- Oh Christ, the battery must be dead.

673
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:39,418
- Bobby, I'm scared.
- I think the bastards took the lantern.

674
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:42,386
Coming back for me!
Coming to get me, Bobby!

675
01:04:42,504 --> 01:04:44,222
Shut up, will you?

676
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:47,467
I hear them outside.

677
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:56,396
Shh! Shh!

678
01:04:57,936 --> 01:05:01,190
- It's OK.
- Maybe I got that son of a bitch.

679
01:05:01,773 --> 01:05:04,447
<i>Mercury?
Mercury, you all right?</i>

680
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,569
<i>Mercury, where are you?</i>

681
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:21,421
Cover me.

682
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:34,974
<i>Hello, Papa? Hello, Papa Jupe?</i>

683
01:05:36,391 --> 01:05:39,486
Hold on Pluto, I'll get him.</i>

684
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:42,196
The beast?

685
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:44,691
- That sound like the beast to you?
- I don't think it was.

686
01:05:44,816 --> 01:05:46,989
Yeah, I think it was.

687
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:49,329
I'm telling you,
they can do the beast perfect.

688
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:03,134
Bobby, is it all right?

689
01:06:08,548 --> 01:06:11,552
Beast, what are you trying to do?

690
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:15,017
Oh, get off of rne.

691
01:06:15,138 --> 01:06:17,891
Where have you been?
Huh? Where have you been?

692
01:06:18,016 --> 01:06:19,859
You bring this?

693
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:23,321
This is Jupiter, what you find?</i>

694
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:27,033
<i>Mercury's dead, Papa.
He's at the bottom of the cliff.</i>

695
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:31,030
Mercury's dead? He fall?</i>

696
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:33,077
<i>He was pushed.</i>

697
01:06:33,198 --> 01:06:36,919
<i>Papa Jupe) Pushed?
Who the hell pushed my boy?</i>

698
01:06:37,744 --> 01:06:39,246
<i>Devil dog.</i>

699
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:42,089
<i>The big bastards tracks
are right on Mercury's chest.</i>

700
01:06:42,207 --> 01:06:43,333
Good boy!

701
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:45,927
<i>Pluto! You come back here.</i>

702
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:49,469
<i>We got some things to do.
You understand what I'm saying?</i>

703
01:06:49,589 --> 01:06:51,887
<i>I'm coming, Papa.</i>

704
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:54,469
Uh-oh.

705
01:06:56,638 --> 01:06:59,983
Your dog made sport
of my blood, you pig.

706
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:04,358
I'm going to kill your kids for that.

707
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:09,614
You come out here
and stick your life in my face.

708
01:07:11,611 --> 01:07:13,955
Stick your fingers in my pie.

709
01:07:14,072 --> 01:07:16,370
That was a bad mistake.

710
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:21,333
I thought you was smart and tough.

711
01:07:22,372 --> 01:07:25,672
- You're stupid.
- Yeah, you sure are.

712
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:27,920
You're nothing.

713
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:36,095
I'm going to watch your goddamn car
rust out, yes I will.

714
01:07:36,219 --> 01:07:37,892
Right, Father. Tell him.

715
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:44,061
I'll see the wind
blow your dried up seeds away.

716
01:07:47,689 --> 01:07:51,159
I'll eat the heart of your stinking memory.

717
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:54,746
I'll eat the brains of your kids' kids.

718
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:59,160
I'm in, you're out. Mars?

719
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:01,078
Yeah, Papa?

720
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:04,547
You keep an eye
on that young tenderloin baby.

721
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:07,133
I want nothing happening to her
unless I say so.

722
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:09,878
You get me, Papa.
I'm going with you.

723
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:12,338
I don't care.

724
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:16,764
Well, you got that cut on your legs,
a blood pipe as big as your thumb.

725
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:20,727
Good place to cut somebody,
but not so good to get cut there yourself.

726
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:23,020
Guys!

727
01:08:24,142 --> 01:08:28,739
I got a feeling that tenderloin's daddy
is going to come looking for her.

728
01:08:28,855 --> 01:08:32,200
- You can take care of him then.
- I'll rip his lungs out.

729
01:08:33,985 --> 01:08:35,703
You do that.

730
01:08:37,196 --> 01:08:41,702
- You got bullets for that there cannon?
- All loaded, Papa Jupe.

731
01:08:43,494 --> 01:08:45,667
It's getting light out.

732
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:47,790
Let's get started.

733
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:07,610
Wait for me.

734
01:09:48,226 --> 01:09:50,945
Shh!

735
01:09:51,062 --> 01:09:53,190
Bobby'?

736
01:09:53,314 --> 01:09:55,362
Bobby, you read rne?

737
01:09:58,569 --> 01:10:00,446
Shh! Bobby'?

738
01:10:00,571 --> 01:10:05,168
This is a breaker one-niner
for KUY-9532.

739
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:14,339
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
Goddamnit, mayday.

740
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:22,719
This is a breaker KUY-195.

741
01:10:22,844 --> 01:10:26,189
Does anybody read this?
This an SOS. Mayday.

742
01:10:28,516 --> 01:10:32,146
This is a breaker one-niner
for KUY-9532.

743
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:34,523
Does anybody read this?

744
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:36,900
We need police help.

745
01:10:37,024 --> 01:10:38,992
Mayday,

746
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:42,034
Look, Brenda,
will you keep it down?

747
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:50,872
Oh, no.

748
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:04,723
It's pretty quiet.

749
01:11:05,887 --> 01:11:08,766
- Think they're laying for us?
- Wouldn't be surprised.

750
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:10,517
Hello, police?
Air Force?

751
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:15,238
This is KUY-9532
calling mayday, mayday.

752
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:23,788
<i>Hello KUY,
this is Air Force Rescue.</i>

753
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:26,124
<i>We have you loud and clear.
What's up?</i>

754
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:30,290
Thank God.
Hello listen, we're under attack.

755
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:34,587
I don't know who. They killed three of us,
and they kidnapped a baby.

756
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:37,335
<i>OK, OK. Now hold on.</i>

757
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:42,967
<i>What are your defensive capabilities
at this time?</i>

758
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:45,718
One gun and I only have two bullets left.

759
01:11:45,843 --> 01:11:48,016
We don't have any hunting rifles
or anything.

760
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:50,856
You've got to help us.
We're sitting ducks.

761
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:52,475
<i>Stand by.</i>

762
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,978
You've got to tell him where we are.

763
01:11:55,895 --> 01:11:59,149
<i>We are recommending
that until we can get to you,</i>

764
01:11:59,273 --> 01:12:01,367
<i>you stand on your heads.</i>

765
01:12:01,484 --> 01:12:04,237
Stand on our heads?
Um, that's code f...

766
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:07,787
<i>Just stand on your heads
with your thumbs up your ass.</i>

767
01:12:09,367 --> 01:12:11,290
Oh, Bobby.

768
01:12:13,955 --> 01:12:17,585
"What are your defensive
capabilities at this time?"

769
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:20,211
Ha! They're just sitting ducks.

770
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:23,385
We'll go in through that wash.
They'll never see us coming.

771
01:12:38,312 --> 01:12:40,906
<i>Mars, we've seen some signs.</i>

772
01:12:42,275 --> 01:12:44,118
<i>You might have a visitor
snooping around.</i>

773
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:48,531
<i>You keep your eyes open.
We're almost there.</i>

774
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:52,042
Bobby, do you read rne?

775
01:12:52,994 --> 01:12:54,792
Bobby'?

776
01:12:55,496 --> 01:12:57,590
They're coming your way.

777
01:12:57,707 --> 01:13:00,381
For Christ's sake, kid,
put your ears on.

778
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:03,004
Damnit!

779
01:13:03,921 --> 01:13:05,764
Come here, fella.
Come here.

780
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:09,102
Listen, it's your turn up at the bat, OK?

781
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:11,312
So you go and get them, OK?

782
01:13:11,429 --> 01:13:13,477
Go, go.

783
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:27,871
Maybe the real Air Force
will see this and come.

784
01:13:28,863 --> 01:13:31,241
Forget it.

785
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:36,083
Nobody's gonna help us.

786
01:13:37,914 --> 01:13:40,542
We've got to get out of this ourselves.

787
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:45,471
Well, if you've got any bright ideas, girl,
just sing right out.

788
01:14:07,944 --> 01:14:10,493
- How strong is this anyway?
- Plenty, why?

789
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:12,615
Come on, I got an idea.

790
01:15:20,975 --> 01:15:22,773
Come here!

791
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:46,967
Papa Jupiter!

792
01:15:47,084 --> 01:15:48,882
Papa Jupiter!

793
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,928
Papa Jupiter!

794
01:16:20,034 --> 01:16:22,378
- Mars.
- Did you get <i>them?</i>

795
01:16:22,495 --> 01:16:23,917
Kill the baby.

796
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:30,135
- Ruby?
- What do you want?

797
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:33,548
- Get it out here.
- What?

798
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:38,769
- You know what.
- What?

799
01:16:38,886 --> 01:16:41,935
- Just get it out here.
- What's going on?

800
01:16:47,812 --> 01:16:51,066
Don't do it until I'm away.
I don't want to see it.

801
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:03,745
Ruby!

802
01:17:06,205 --> 01:17:07,206
Where is she?

803
01:17:12,336 --> 01:17:13,929
Katy!

804
01:17:14,588 --> 01:17:16,306
Katy!

805
01:17:18,092 --> 01:17:20,140
Ruby!

806
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:26,859
Ruby!

807
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:38,367
Hey. you! Give me my Katy.

808
01:17:40,865 --> 01:17:43,118
Let's get out of here!

809
01:17:50,124 --> 01:17:52,047
Wait.

810
01:17:52,168 --> 01:17:53,795
What?

811
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:56,217
We can't do this.

812
01:17:58,799 --> 01:18:00,927
We've got to do it.

813
01:18:01,969 --> 01:18:04,347
It's the only way to be sure.

814
01:18:31,624 --> 01:18:35,379
Fucking devil dog.
You son of a bitch!

815
01:18:37,004 --> 01:18:38,597
You piece of shit.

816
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:41,684
I'll kill you bitch.
I'll kill you.

817
01:18:42,593 --> 01:18:45,517
I'll eat your heart, piss licker.
Puke eater!

818
01:18:45,638 --> 01:18:49,017
I'll strangle you with your own guts.

819
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:07,345
- Take the baby, here.
- Lift this up.

820
01:20:40,294 --> 01:20:42,012
You die, boy!

821
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:23,087
Jesus, this guy doesn't quit!

822
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:42,906
Oh, holy shit!

823
01:21:43,982 --> 01:21:47,077
Got yourself trapped
right where they breed, boy!

824
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:55,828
Mars! Take me!

825
01:21:55,953 --> 01:21:57,921
- Get out of here!
- Take me!

826
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:00,670
You ain't worth taking, Ruby.

827
01:22:00,791 --> 01:22:02,839
Leave him alone.

828
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,507
Take me.

829
01:22:05,129 --> 01:22:06,381
- Look!
- Ruby!

830
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:15,101
Mars!

831
01:22:15,222 --> 01:22:16,940
Katy!

832
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:18,855
Mars!

833
01:22:26,024 --> 01:22:27,025
Help!

834
01:22:27,484 --> 01:22:29,532
Help!

835
01:22:29,653 --> 01:22:31,121
Katy!

836
01:22:32,573 --> 01:22:34,291
No!

837
01:22:44,126 --> 01:22:47,175
You... son of a bitch!

838
01:23:11,945 --> 01:23:14,323
You bastard!
You got ten seconds to live.

839
01:23:14,448 --> 01:23:16,997
- Ten seconds!
- Please!

840
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:23,875
Get off! Get off me!

841
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:57,908
Mars!

842
01:25:12,733 --> 01:25:14,155
Fire it up.

843
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:20,115
Come on.

844
01:25:32,336 --> 01:25:33,553
Run!

845
01:25:47,267 --> 01:25:49,611
It's working.

846
01:25:59,279 --> 01:26:00,326
Shit!

847
01:26:06,203 --> 01:26:08,877
- Come on.
- He's loose!

848
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:10,294
Hurry!

849
01:26:18,215 --> 01:26:20,513
Hold your nose. Hold your nose.

850
01:26:24,012 --> 01:26:26,765
Through the window, like I told you!

851
01:26:30,268 --> 01:26:32,362
I'll get you!

852
01:26:35,816 --> 01:26:37,739
Go on. Run!

853
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:56,215
Come on, open the door.

854
01:26:58,964 --> 01:27:00,181
Come on!

855
01:27:17,816 --> 01:27:20,695
Woo-hoo!

856
01:27:25,115 --> 01:27:27,459
- Where are you going?
- We've got to be sure.

857
01:27:27,576 --> 01:27:29,294
Bobby, don't!

858
01:27:29,411 --> 01:27:31,413
Bobby, no! Wait, don't!

859
01:27:31,538 --> 01:27:32,960
Bobby, don't!

860
01:27:33,623 --> 01:27:36,297
Bobby, don't leave me!
Don't leave me!

861
01:27:36,418 --> 01:27:38,546
Bobby, wait!

862
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:41,173
Bobby!

863
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,137
Bobby, don't go in there!

864
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:45,681
Bobby, please don't go in there!

865
01:27:45,802 --> 01:27:48,555
Bobby! No!

866
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:50,432
Bobby!

867
01:28:20,629 --> 01:28:22,302
Bobby!
