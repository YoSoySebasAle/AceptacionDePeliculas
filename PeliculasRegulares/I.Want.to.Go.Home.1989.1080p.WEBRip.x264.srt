1
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,036
I WANT TO GO HOME

2
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,319
Oh, Racine...

3
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,399
here I am...

4
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,274
Molière ...

5
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,957
I'm approaching your shore.

6
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,879
Apollinaire...

7
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,513
can you hear me ?

8
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,160
You, Jean-Paul, you would understand me,

9
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,998
and you too, Simone.

10
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,953
I'm escaping.

11
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,670
I've escaped from sufficient ...

12
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,710
rustics with a "closed spirit" from bourgeois Cleveland.

13
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,395
For the culture

14
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,512
where the spirit isn't ridiculed in the dinners.

15
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,560
Flaubert ...

16
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,148
I open my loins for you, my master.

17
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,116
My master's thesis ...

18
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,918
Oh, Christian Gauthier...

19
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,757
their succession over all.

20
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,869
Susan Sontag's Mentor ...

21
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,995
I'm crying in my new language ...

22
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,075
Paris, France ! "Do you speak"...

23
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,838
I'm going too.

24
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,836
Ah, no! No! You, I didn't take you!

25
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,790
TWO YEARS LATER...

26
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,715
My father.

27
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,235
Disgusting!

28
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,040
I'm honored.

29
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,310
A cartoonist !

30
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,997
I'm honored for France! Did you only read Flaubert?

31
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,239
- Or have you heard of him? - Absolutely.

32
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,029
His culture is Garfield ...

33
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,798
Charlie Brown...

34
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,353
Snoopy...

35
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,834
and Mickey.

36
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,520
The only book he gave me was a Mickey.

37
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,148
It's criminal ...

38
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,873
And I was 12 years old!

39
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,513
8 years !

40
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,280
I had already passed the Mickey age, right?

41
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,152
And then, he knew Stendhal, Sartre,

42
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,476
Genet, Christian Gauthier !

43
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,076
Relax.

44
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,918
I'm relaxed.

45
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,756
You don't jot down until you are nervous.

46
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,234
Dr Freud !

47
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,189
You're nervous. It's normal.

48
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,358
Don't tell me because I'm nervous.

49
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,277
It's normal. You haven't seen her for two years.

50
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,756
Yes. Don't tell me I'm normal, I know I am.

51
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,678
I know I'm normal.

52
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,029
You're scared.

53
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,396
Don't tell me I'm scared ...

54
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,032
Well. I don't say a word anymore.

55
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,873
She loves you, you know.

56
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,676
That dirty kid didn't write to me

57
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,519
for 2 years that she's in Paris.

58
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,078
I thought we didn't talk about it anymore.

59
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,310
My lips are sealed.

60
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,520
Good.

61
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,359
I love you, Joey.

62
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,075
Me too.

63
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,515
Shut up.

64
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,395
Oh my God...

65
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,680
- What's the matter ? - Where's she ?

66
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,996
Elise's address! My own daughter!

67
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,678
I ... I can't find her address.

68
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,470
You will leave your skin there!

69
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,954
I knew you would forget it! The only important thing!

70
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,912
The only thing ... the only reason ...

71
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,033
you made me to accept this ... stupid, stupid invitation ...

72
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,196
to participate in this ... stupid ...

73
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,153
international BD cretinery.

74
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,190
Prestigious!

75
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,037
Stupid.

76
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,557
Turn around! Get in the house !

77
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,558
You will leave your skin there!

78
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,313
I'll find her.

79
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,274
I know where she is.

80
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,749
At home. On my drawing board.

81
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,676
This is what to do.

82
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,875
One, we land.

83
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,199
Don't get mad, Lena.

84
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,710
Two, we take the first plane back to Cleveland.

85
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,920
Ah yes ?

86
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,718
Her mother has her address. Call her mother.

87
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,114
Rather die !

88
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,359
No, but at 66, poor idiot ...

89
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,315
you make your first trip

90
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,556
in a country where they don't speak English!

91
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,512
You will leave your skin there!

92
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,995
Here it is ! I found it!

93
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,589
You see ? No problem.

94
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,113
What does the letter is saying?

95
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,557
Come and get us.

96
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,390
The lady of the gallery.

97
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,037
The director ... Madam ...

98
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,232
She has to come to the airport.

99
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,908
Someone has to come get us.

100
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,599
At the airport ?

101
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,156
Not another airport?

102
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,278
At the airport where we arrive.

103
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,152
Charles de Gaulle?

104
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,351
So where is she, this ... Madame ... Madame Roget?

105
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,834
She has her comic book store.

106
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,634
She has been delayed, like Elsie.

107
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,640
Papa !

108
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,159
My dad !

109
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,915
Elsie...

110
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,800
Let's go home.

111
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,160
At home ?

112
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,948
A Cleveland !

113
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,030
This man has only ten additional minutes to live!

114
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,396
I'm in good shape.

115
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,672
Taxi, turn around!

116
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,079
Are you sure it's the right one?

117
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,873
We will take care of the money.

118
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,639
I'm dizzy.

119
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,957
We're only on the second floor.

120
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,391
Third! I'm dizzy.

121
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,357
Listen. I have set up everything there.

122
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,110
Let's go. That's 10 francs.

123
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,355
And that, 5 francs.

124
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,710
Why 5 francs, these are money

125
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,114
and 10 francs, aren't?

126
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,036
I don't know.

127
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,753
Shouldn't it be the opposite?

128
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,668
And why are the 5 francs more

129
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,756
than the 10 francs?

130
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,552
You are getting stupid, you know.

131
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,318
Well. What's that ?

132
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,432
100 francs, I think. Yes,100 francs.

133
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,915
If that's 100 francs ... what's that?

134
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,189
100 francs.

135
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,789
This is 100 francs, and this is 100 francs?

136
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
They are equal, Joey !

137
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,477
And first of all, why do they have two species of 100 francs?

138
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,910
One is worth more than the other?

139
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,120
Stop it !

140
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,280
Stop making stories.

141
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,839
I'm a simple guy.

142
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,190
From a very simple country.

143
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,914
With us, a dollar is a dollar bill.

144
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,588
We don't have coins and banknotes.

145
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,394
We don't have 100 dollar coins.

146
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,751
What's this crazy country?

147
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,434
Oh my God ! Where's my number? I lost it...

148
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,239
Ah, there it is !

149
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,074
Who are we laughing at ?

150
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,549
People will come to see cartoons

151
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,591
in a painting gallery.

152
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,392
They are strangers!

153
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,674
They'll understand nothing. It'll be in Hebrew.

154
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,350
How are they going to get the gags?

155
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,630
Gags are my strong point.

156
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,840
I'm not going.

157
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,277
I'll not be ridicules.

158
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,520
Wait until I wash this.

159
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,991
No unwashed fruit abroad.

160
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,878
In principle, we're there to amuse ourselves.

161
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,350
Would you have fun if they heckled you?

162
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,799
Every time Lena and I, we are on a voyage ...

163
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,149
there is a printing.

164
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,915
You never travel.

165
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,953
It's your father !

166
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,151
Let me work, silly cat.

167
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,632
I didn't say anything

168
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,229
since when you didn't go to say something, but ...

169
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,909
Who do you think you are ?

170
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,950
My shrink?

171
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,151
Come on, out ... get out!

172
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,432
I'll go to that damn opening!

173
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,310
You have to come when I'll submit my thesis.

174
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,996
And I have to integrate the influences of youth in Flaubert.

175
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,633
Marcel Mouse ?

176
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,914
Very funny !

177
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,640
What's this ?

178
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,878
Terrine is pâté, and ... baby rabbit ...

179
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,274
it must be duck.

180
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,870
Where are you, are you here?

181
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,115
What's this ? What's this ?

182
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,993
Don't you know? I took the same plane with you!

183
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,237
Of course, you don't know! Eating doesn't count for you.

184
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,032
You don't even eat breakfast.

185
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,276
What are you doing here?

186
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,914
I'm with us, at least,

187
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,350
whatever you don't eat costs less.

188
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,516
I told you not to worry, right?

189
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,994
You're my guest.

190
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,079
Yes, I see, thank you.

191
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,836
Maybe you should tell her who you are.

192
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,192
I don't know how to do this.

193
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,917
We'll be picked up from the airport.

194
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,712
The opening is only at 9 p.m.

195
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,471
I'm Joey Wellman.

196
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,195
It's closed. Sorry, closed.

197
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,920
Come back at 9 a.m.

198
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,996
I want to be reimbursed for the taxi!

199
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,635
Shit ... shit ... shit!

200
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,720
Excuse me.

201
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,040
Excuse me.

202
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,070
Do you know what I would like to do? To go to the Musée d'Orsay.

203
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,317
It's a station transformed to a museum.

204
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,638
The only station that interests me ...

205
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,718
is the one who will bring me home.

206
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,559
You didn't get it, did you?

207
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,398
Which country !

208
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,831
You need a credit card to call ...

209
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,314
from a cabin!

210
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,033
You have to be member ...

211
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,074
of a club. Insane, right?

212
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,555
To make a phone !

213
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,469
You must be a member of a private club ...

214
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,831
to call from the street, from a booth, on the street!

215
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,040
Stop it.

216
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,236
Have you finished? Listen to me.

217
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,918
No one came to the airport.

218
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,357
Nobody came...

219
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,080
and this lady ... from the gallery ...

220
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,517
I'm coming from Cleveland ...

221
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,199
And she can't be bothered!

222
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,040
I'm leaving.

223
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,033
We are in Paris. So that's enough.

224
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,518
We'll forget all our problems and we'll have fun.

225
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,631
Do you understand? Enjoy !

226
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,228
We are in Paris !

227
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,759
I can't promise you anything,

228
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,235
but let me have your responsibility ...

229
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,873
My responsibility ?

230
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,193
You worked so hard.

231
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,119
I'm a simple journalist!

232
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,992
You're much more than that.

233
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,038
This is weekly work,

234
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,515
but to a painting gallery? No.

235
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,395
A cartoonist is an eye.

236
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,272
A "jongleur", even more.

237
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,591
It is our last work for the evening.

238
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,711
But we have Beaubourg.

239
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,920
The crowd !

240
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,394
Wonderful!

241
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,998
You hate the crowd. I hate it.

242
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,348
I'm wary of your contempt, Lionel.

243
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,711
You are anti-cartoonist and in eight days, you will praise the depth.

244
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,753
You admire painters for their depth, don't you?

245
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,550
When I told you in Paris that I hate comics ...

246
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,470
you have blamed me severely for using a viper language. No?

247
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,832
You're charming, Terry.

248
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,832
Can't you be serious?

249
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,639
All these cartoons ... France, Italy, Belgium ...

250
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,559
Japan ... even Japan has caught up with America.

251
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,480
Shit !

252
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,477
American culture is dead.

253
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,393
Our painting is dead. Our theater. Our music.

254
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,600
Our movies are dead!

255
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,239
Not your movies, Harry.

256
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,277
No one is funding me anymore. I'm dead. A walking corpse.

257
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,869
Why do you think I'm in France, damn it?

258
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,599
I've also died ...

259
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,438
this cartoon is stupid!

260
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,430
When I was a kid, in Arizona, it was my passion.

261
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,833
Not seen for years!

262
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,555
Nobody is reading it anymore, this t!

263
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,999
It's dead !

264
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,753
Snoopy! That still has a spark of life!

265
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,600
Why didn't you invite Charles Schultz?

266
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,837
Harry, take a decision for a comic book between a dog and a cat ...

267
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,920
would you like me to make a critical distinction?

268
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,794
We invited Schultz. He refused.

269
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,309
And Will Eisner. Another refuse.

270
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,910
And Al Capp. Another refuse.

271
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,269
It is dead.

272
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,754
We're all dead, old man.

273
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,960
This is what they said.

274
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,238
In any case, he wasn't free.

275
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,196
We contacted Crumb, Speigelman and Trudeau.

276
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,400
Nobody...

277
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,152
in America was free.

278
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,592
Let's get the hell out. Too much smoke.

279
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,634
I haven't breathed fresh air from Kennedy Airport.

280
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,592
Dead! We are all dead!

281
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,030
No ! You can't leave!

282
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,350
You are Joey Wellman. I'm Gauthier.

283
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,231
I'm fed up.

284
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,635
You too ? Me too. Come.

285
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,311
Hepp Catt is still spinning.

286
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,675
You are so real ...

287
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,995
you are so good, less  American.

288
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,678
And final, so hidden, so cynical.

289
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,359
I can't bear any longer your cynicism.

290
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,039
You neither also, of course.

291
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,832
"Isn't it amazing!"

292
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,189
Your work up to today, although you are no longer 20yo ...

293
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,437
radiates the innocence of the American emigrant.

294
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,870
The dreamer. Those who inspire hope.

295
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,310
Those who made Hollywood.

296
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,800
Hi, Harry!

297
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,910
Christian Gauthier ... old scoundrel!

298
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,554
Good morning, how are you ?

299
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:32,591
How I envy you for being a compatriot of the great Joey Wellman!

300
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,835
Do you know each other ?

301
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,040
Of course not !

302
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,912
Outside their discipline,

303
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,917
American artists ignore each other.

304
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,919
Woody Allen doesn't know Updike.

305
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,475
Mailer didn't know Pollock ...

306
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,591
while they were neighbors! Neighbors!

307
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,711
"It's not-amazing!"

308
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,959
It's your motto, isn't it?

309
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,153
Hello Catt this to Fatt Catt:

310
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,669
"It's-not-amazing"! Enjoyable.

311
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,392
Harry is the great director, a genius, like you.

312
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,109
Who can forget your remakes, "Have it or not" ...

313
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,595
"The Public Enemy" and "The Train will whistle three times"?

314
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,915
Unforgettable!

315
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,634
I scrape the base plates.

316
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,673
I "machine-gun" them, and then I "machine-gun" the plate.

317
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,230
Hollywood vomits me. do you know why ?

318
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,590
Because my remakes are better.

319
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,235
I haven't seen them.

320
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,589
Of course not.

321
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,112
Who is less sticking than you artists?

322
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:27,036
Your famous individualism. The anarchy. Each for himself.

323
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,753
The establishment despises you,

324
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,110
and you despise the establishment.

325
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,709
It's the secret of your genius. Come.

326
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,600
- Did you understand? - Not a word.

327
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,199
But yes, you understood.

328
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,190
I invite my friends for a drink.

329
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,470
No. I have to wait for my daughter, Elsie.

330
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,155
My Elsie ...

331
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,114
Joey ... go ahead. I'll wait for her.

332
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,154
Your wife will be waiting for her. Bring her ... Her friends too!

333
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,360
She isn't my wife.

334
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,880
I don't want to ...

335
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,555
leave you here, in all this smoke.

336
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,559
Go with Mr. Gauthier.

337
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,716
I'll come with Elsie, if she comes by.

338
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,037
It bothers me to do that. This guy has heard of me.

339
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,277
I don't know who he is, but he's someone.

340
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,629
He likes what I do.

341
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,400
Didn't he say I was on the decline?

342
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,271
Stop it! Go ahead.

343
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,471
- He likes what you do. - I'm going.

344
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,718
Bravo ... I must say that you did very well!

345
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,239
Hush !

346
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,272
So, do you really like what I'm doing?

347
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,199
So, do you really like what I'm doing?

348
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,158
Have you seen how I live?

349
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,955
It's hellish.

350
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,149
And you will be surprised that I can't work!

351
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,273
No one is afraid of me.

352
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,429
A man of my status. What to do ?

353
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,277
I don't intimidate anyone. Sit down.

354
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,710
I chase them away: They come back.

355
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,878
I am rude, insulting: They come back.

356
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,753
How can I work, huh?

357
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,151
Answer: My major work remains under construction ...

358
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,353
forever unfinished.

359
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,152
You must be wondering why?

360
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,389
Answer: I am irreplaceable.

361
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,637
It is inhuman to be so irreplaceable.

362
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,995
It's my cross.

363
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,517
So, you know everything about Gauthier.

364
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,910
A very sad and very boring intellectual.

365
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,314
And you, tell me ...

366
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,830
at what age did you decide to be a great cartoonist?

367
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,240
Well...

368
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,868
I had never stood against her before.

369
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,670
No one stood up to my mother.

370
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,440
Especially not my father ... but I left.

371
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,437
For the Dental School?

372
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,110
I had no idea how to get into a newspaper.

373
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,635
Neither do I can see how to become a cartoonist.

374
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:36,157
Thereupon, you meet Roy Crane.

375
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:40,717
He was doing a comic book for a newspaper.

376
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:44,310
You mustn't know him. I asked for his advice.

377
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,072
"Le grand" Roy Crane ! "Wash Tubbs and Captain Easy".

378
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,918
"Wash Tubbs !"

379
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,035
I'm going to talk to you about Al Capp.

380
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,676
I don't care what they say about Al.

381
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,717
He was a great man.

382
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,388
We made our debut together.

383
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,716
I was his assistant on "Li'l Abner" ...

384
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,035
Don't you know?

385
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,719
Who doesn't know "Li'l Abner"?

386
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,115
Just before starting my own comic book.

387
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,389
"Li’l Abner".

388
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,320
They demolished him, the poor man.

389
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,831
They were cows with him.

390
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,713
But Al Capp ... believe me ...

391
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,397
Al Capp was the smartest cartoonist.

392
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,114
Much smarter than me.

393
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,514
As much as you, you do understand.

394
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,352
Lena knew Al Capp well. You didn't like her, did you?

395
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,913
She didn't come.

396
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,278
I loved Al. And he liked me.

397
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,197
My daughter didn't come to the gallery. She had an accident.

398
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,080
You have a daughter ?

399
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,000
Are you Joey's daughter?

400
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,912
She isn't my daughter.

401
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,148
Neither is his wife.

402
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,477
Ah, your daughter is in Paris.

403
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,114
We'll find her. I will find her. Trust Gauthier.

404
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:09,313
Paris is like that. She is there. I'm there. Trust me.

405
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,994
That's what we're going to do, Joey.

406
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,308
I'll take you back to the hotel.

407
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,308
You ask for your vote. Right away.

408
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,353
I have to spend the weekend with my mother.

409
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,152
She lives in the countryside.

410
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,914
What do you want, huh?

411
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:42,237
For 2 months, I left her alone, there, the poor.

412
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,470
We'll leave in the morning. You and Lana ...

413
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,680
Lena...

414
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,832
You'll be my guests.

415
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,152
I need to see my daughter.

416
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,431
That's what we are going to do.

417
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:06,031
We waited, we phoned, and she didn't come.

418
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:11,153
Listen ... listen ... if you have to go, go.

419
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,952
I had a fantastic evening.

420
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,388
Lena, Lena ...

421
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,749
Joey, listen.

422
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,919
This is what we are going to do.

423
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,078
I'm taking Lena back to your hotel. OK ?

424
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,153
I'm packing your bags. I'm paying your bills.

425
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,637
We'll be waiting for you at my place.

426
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,309
I'll put the address for you. OK ? And the phone.

427
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,397
I don't know how to call here.

428
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,149
OK, OK. I'll put the address for you. We're waiting for you. OK ?

429
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,076
I'll give you my mother's address ...

430
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,471
Isabelle Gauthier.

431
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,153
My mother's address in the countryside.

432
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,278
Isabelle Gauthier.

433
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,274
If Elsie doesn't come,

434
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,119
leave this invitation with the concierge.

435
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,878
I can't do that.

436
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:13,709
If Elsie doesn't come, you'll return to my house. OK ?

437
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,353
A taxi. OK?

438
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,350
You'll give this paper ...

439
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,912
- what I'm writing right now ...

440
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,874
and those 100 francs, to the taxi.

441
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,513
You'll give ...

442
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,438
Elsie's invitation to the concierge.

443
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,440
And if...

444
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,951
if the concierge doesn't arrive before 9am, don't bother waiting.

445
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,832
Stick these words on the door, in this envelope ...

446
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,837
and mark on it: "Concierge". OK ?

447
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,678
This is for the taxi ...

448
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,316
plus the 100 francs, very important,

449
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,078
and that, for the concierge.

450
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,718
There's nothing simpler.

451
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,997
I'll take care of everything, Joey.

452
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,995
Papa ?

453
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,513
Are you here at this hour ?!

454
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,996
Where were you ? I was deadly worried.

455
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,670
That's all you tell me after two years!

456
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,318
Do you know what time is it?

457
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,273
Nothing changes.

458
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,437
The charms of France!

459
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,910
You can be messy at home too!

460
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,795
So what ?

461
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,476
I saw your name on posters.

462
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,034
You're skinny.

463
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,069
Do you eat ?

464
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,275
Are you asking me about Lena?

465
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,951
She's fine, thank you. Thanks for asking.

466
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,391
Can I offer you breakfast?

467
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,756
I never eat it.

468
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,719
Ah, no breakfast in France! That's not normal.

469
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,390
I thought France is famous for the cuisine.

470
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,837
I've tasted it.

471
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,470
Trust me, I've eaten better.

472
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,749
I believe you.

473
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,154
You believe me.

474
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,874
You missed the exhibition.

475
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,559
I was delayed.

476
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,114
Delayed!

477
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,916
You haven't missed much.

478
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,759
We're going to the countryside this weekend.

479
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,352
You are writing to your mother every two weeks.

480
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,836
In the meantime, she is calling me

481
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,553
to hear for you ...

482
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,275
as if you have written to me during the week

483
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,516
why you didn't write to her.

484
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,274
What could I tell her?

485
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,231
I never had a word from you?

486
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,239
I have my pride.

487
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,716
I'm inventing a letter. Every 15 days...

488
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,549
I make up a letter that I'm reading to your mother.

489
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,951
That's what you are making me to do.

490
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,352
Come with us to the countryside. You are invited.

491
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,519
I can't come.

492
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:22,795
Yes ... I'm no longer living with this woman ...

493
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,752
and you are forcing me to lie to her.

494
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,875
I have your invitation here ...

495
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,360
here...

496
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,789
In case you change your mind. It's in French.

497
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,391
This address is in Paris.

498
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,720
So...

499
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,391
that's all. Take them both.

500
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,192
On sale today!

501
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,398
Oh, do you speak French?

502
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,749
Is that all ? I'll do the same.

503
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,829
It's serious.

504
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,395
I did this whole trip.

505
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,439
I would love to hear you speaking in real good French.

506
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,358
They aren't bad at all !

507
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,279
Heck, what! I don't speak this language.

508
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,597
How am I going to go back alone?

509
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,314
There's a taxi rank around the corner.

510
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,794
Give him the address.

511
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,913
At least accompany me a little. Drop me.

512
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,229
You see, I'm getting there too.

513
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,077
For what!

514
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,633
You want in French!

515
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,035
I'm gonna rock you, in French!

516
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,709
Where are we going ? Where are you taking me?

517
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:10,352
I've asked for the Hôtel de la Tuilerie.

518
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:14,992
Are you taking me to the Hôtel de la Tuilerie?

519
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:40,512
It's a trap ! A trap ! I know you are managing!

520
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,992
Like you, we do that in Cleveland!

521
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,713
Oh my God !

522
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,519
Help !

523
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,789
Terrorists !

524
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,876
I would have done everything!

525
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,950
Where do you want to go, huh? To Charles de Gaulle!

526
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,833
It's the only place

527
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:09,237
where this taxi jerk knew to take me!

528
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,078
And now that I'm here ...

529
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,471
No, you listen to me, Lena ... I'm leaving this country!

530
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:20,514
You can't find a good single reason against!

531
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:25,191
So pack your bags. Bring your passport.

532
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:29,678
I found at TWA an adorable and pretty lady ...

533
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,440
who is speaking English better than me

534
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,517
and who helped me to phone ...

535
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,030
I'll buy her a return ticket

536
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,037
and I'll take her with me.

537
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:44,791
Because the only good in this country is that you can pay.

538
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,958
Paris, for me, is finished, without appeal!

539
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,639
Tell me you're not kidding.

540
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:54,152
When you have your crises, she ends up reasoning you.

541
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,480
I don't think you will reason with me this time!

542
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:03,035
On my kidnapping !

543
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,040
I knew you liked me. You are crazy.

544
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,957
Me too, but French.

545
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,118
My madness, it's a number!

546
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:16,472
American madness is "formidable", purely instinctive.

547
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,636
You have a lot to teach me.

548
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,559
I don't want you lost in my country.

549
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,318
I want to come to my country!

550
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,193
Mother has never seen a crazy American cartoonist.

551
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,277
You'll be my gift.

552
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,153
She's old, like you, and has no friends.

553
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,839
But she's very, very generous.

554
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,271
She forgives me for everything, even for my Americans.

555
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,472
It's only published in 50 newspapers.

556
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:45,513
Fifty? It's good, no ?

557
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:49,589
No. Not really. Philadelphia is the only major city that is publishing it.

558
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,792
In Cleveland - his hometown - we don't publish it.

559
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,718
Not in Cleveland!

560
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,390
Superman and Bob Hope were born there!

561
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,600
I'll never forgive him, not in Cleveland.

562
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,709
In short, what he doesn't want to do it, I do. Especially the funds.

563
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,718
Is Joey assistant you? I didn't know.

564
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,478
We knew each other for long.

565
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,352
I was in animation, in Hollywood ...

566
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,152
In the cartoons?

567
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:16,511
Joey came to the studio for a film on Hepp Catt.

568
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,756
In cartoons?

569
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,712
Sacrilege! No no !

570
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:25,272
Take Popeye. The cartoon killed an awesome creation.

571
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,398
Oh my God...

572
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,469
Him who came from so far!

573
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,559
For his exhibition!

574
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,990
For you ! To see you !

575
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,637
And you treated him ...

576
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,912
as you don't treat even your worst enemy ...

577
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,630
I don't have "worse enemy"!

578
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,108
I'm still too young.

579
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:10,312
In the meantime, I'll do the trick!

580
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,590
He was never a father to me!

581
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,870
He was protective for everyone ...

582
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,712
for this woman he lives with ...

583
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,793
but for me, never!

584
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,355
He is more paternal towards strangers!

585
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:37,279
Don't throw the invitation. You can change your mind.

586
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,109
Stop harassing me!

587
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:43,519
He'll leave without ever knowing

588
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,073
how much you have changed.

589
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,471
Without ever knowing how far away Cleveland is for you.

590
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,436
Without ever knowing how much

591
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:57,269
you "Parisianized" yourself ... "Francized".

592
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,518
Christian Gauthier...

593
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,991
Christian Gauthier ?

594
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,308
I can't believe it !

595
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:12,877
Christian Gauthier invited this scribbler ...

596
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,116
In his country house.

597
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,712
Pinch me, I'm dreaming!

598
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,480
Joey Wellman...

599
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,558
Who has only read illustrated books!

600
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,837
Ronald Reagan, despite all his faults ...

601
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,634
narrow-mindedness, filthy ignorance, repugnant racism ...

602
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,432
will go down in history

603
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,632
as the greatest President since Truman.

604
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:58,910
And Truman, from Lincoln.

605
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,678
The "American" one hundred percent.

606
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,677
For me, the greatest President,

607
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,713
was Franklin Roosevelt.

608
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:06,955
No! Wrong!

609
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,594
Roosevelt was a great actor, like Reagan.

610
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,598
America's decline began with Roosevelt.

611
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,631
Roosevelt was a great man.

612
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,512
He did nothing for the Jews of Europe.

613
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,870
In France, we understand that.

614
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:22,597
Roosevelt was a romantic figure, like De Gaulle.

615
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:26,277
Truman, was more in the "populist" vein,

616
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,480
"man in the street".

617
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,870
You know nothing about American politics.

618
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:32,435
Truman has done more than Roosevelt.

619
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,073
I admire your propensity

620
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,794
to be deaf to everything, so agree on nothing.

621
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,718
I met Truman once.

622
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,273
President ?

623
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,833
He had no idea who I was!

624
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,592
"I thought you were the author of Krazy Kat"!

625
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,439
This "Come-in-the-bacon" from Truman!

626
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,200
So...

627
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:57,680
Truman...

628
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,952
arrived at this dinner, with others ...

629
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,551
large vegetables, and they introduce me.

630
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,553
"My young friend," he said to me ...

631
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,835
"there are too many cats in your illustrations!"

632
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:16,272
"Put a Republican MP in your comics instead!"

633
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,596
"For me, a Republican,

634
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,631
"it's much funnier than a cat!"

635
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:27,033
"For me, a Republican is funnier than a cat."

636
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:55,395
It's the stroke of the pencil that's so striking ...

637
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,636
for a cartoonist. Hepp Catt, of course ...

638
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,671
vaguely resembles a cat. But...

639
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,472
Does Mickey looks like a mouse?

640
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,512
Donald ... to a duck?

641
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:08,189
However, a mouse is a mouse.

642
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,159
And a duck, a duck.

643
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:14,553
I much prefer Daffy to Donald.

644
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,638
Disney was a better strike breaker than a designer.

645
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:21,150
No no. Disney had a tragic vision.

646
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:24,796
Dumbo, that ridiculous baby-elephant with wings as ears,

647
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,479
even you must have loved it!

648
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:27,840
I hate it.

649
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:31,635
And his mother ? Poor Dumbo's mom has gone mad ...

650
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,273
we had to chain it!

651
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,232
Chain it! What about Bambi's mother?

652
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,989
Shot down? By hunters! By cowboys!

653
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,069
Not by cowboys.

654
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:42,874
Dejected!

655
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,872
Lena worked for Disney.

656
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,513
I'm speechless.

657
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:57,872
Draw us a Bambi.

658
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,275
No.

659
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,117
- But if. - But no.

660
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,357
I never drew Bambi ... so ...

661
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:09,358
Lena, what, let's make an effort!

662
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,755
Sorry, I never did that.

663
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,109
Joey, please.

664
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:16,474
Joey, draw us a Bambi.

665
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:19,399
No, I don't know.

666
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,400
What has he said ?

667
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,677
He asked me if you could draw Miss Piggy for us.

668
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:55,593
Toddlers, Lionel and I

669
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,791
we disguised ourselves as comic characters.

670
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,594
You were showing off in grotesque disguises,

671
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,279
but me, no!

672
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,039
Come on, Joey!

673
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,876
You are dressed up as a pig!

674
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,320
Slander!

675
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,550
"Next week, I'm getting organized."

676
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,069
The immortal "motto"!

677
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,669
I was sure, I was sure ...

678
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:29,551
Lionel...

679
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,592
tonight let's organize a comic strip ball

680
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,472
in honor of Joey, huh?

681
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,033
What an excruciating idea!

682
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:37,560
Elsie !

683
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:41,989
It's my little Elsie ...

684
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,073
my daughter ... remember?

685
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,238
We waited for her in your car.

686
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,439
And there she is!

687
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,798
Excuse me...

688
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,194
this is my thesis.

689
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,119
We waited for her all night and she was there?

690
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:07,678
Joey, your life is a real comic.

691
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,514
Draw me Popeye. No, Wimpy.

692
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,278
"I'll pay you with delicacy on Tuesday,

693
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,118
my burger today. "

694
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,755
No, Wimpy, it's too simple.

695
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:21,839
I'll implore you: Bugs Bunny. Oh yes !

696
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,475
Lena does this much better than I do.

697
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,117
No, no. Well done, Joey. Very well.

698
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,714
What did your mother say?

699
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,388
That you'll have to draw her a drawing

700
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,068
every time you come to see her in France.

701
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,632
You can't disappoint us.

702
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:07,834
They understand me in Paris! Unimaginable, right?

703
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:11,949
There's going to be a costume ball in my honor tonight.

704
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,160
Awesome.

705
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:47,275
No one has ever spoken to me like you.

706
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,077
If only I ...

707
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:54,269
I didn't have a mother after Dad left.

708
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,913
She hated me.

709
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,840
You're welcome. No secrets.

710
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,316
I was an orphan ...

711
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,511
An orphan when you left us.

712
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:10,755
Father and daughter, so alike.

713
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,757
Both so sad.

714
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,349
I thought you weren't ...

715
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,757
My son brings me all kinds of Americans.

716
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:23,635
Directors, television fantasists, philosophers!

717
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,239
Boredom!

718
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,359
What do you want me to do ?

719
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:29,312
I must defend myself!

720
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,151
Christian loves women, but ...

721
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:42,553
they don't count for him.

722
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:46,829
He doesn't think about it until one or two in the morning.

723
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,759
There, Christian remembers them.

724
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,073
But at 8 o'clock in the morning ...

725
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:55,714
he forgets them all.

726
00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:00,638
He only remembers ... his books.

727
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:39,590
Lena, I'm recognized here.

728
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:44,908
No one has recognized me with us since 1961.

729
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:47,709
I have never been considered as an artist.

730
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,558
Unbelievable, right?

731
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,320
Why do you suddenly need to be an artist?

732
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,751
I feel bad with these people.

733
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:58,599
Why are you doing this to me?

734
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:01,276
I thought you liked France.

735
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:22,157
Have you seen my wife?

736
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:23,873
You Tarzan?

737
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:26,919
You Jane?

738
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,477
The Americans never ... understood me.

739
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,640
I'm what I am, and that's all I am!

740
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:45,750
Obviously Woody Allen is taller than Bergman.

741
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:47,473
Don't be so stupid, Lionel.

742
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:55,959
"It's not-amazing!"

743
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:01,751
I invite you to my home for an all-duck dinner.

744
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,192
You'll bring the duck.

745
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:05,231
Joey...

746
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:07,635
as a jew, are you with Woody Allen,

747
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:09,319
for a Palestinian state?

748
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:12,918
Because ... I'm looking for my daughter.

749
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:14,599
Have you seen my wife?

750
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:22,269
Why do I have to be Titi?

751
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:24,158
Courage, Elsie.

752
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:27,675
I don't want to be Titi!

753
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:31,153
You have to learn to be strong.

754
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,200
But why ?

755
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:38,757
If you don't have the strength, you have to be ironic!

756
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,356
In life, you need one or the other.

757
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:45,949
Strength or irony.

758
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:47,593
Are you strong?

759
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,358
Or cynicism.

760
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:52,472
Strength. Irony. Or cynicism.

761
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:54,193
I want to die!

762
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,559
The despair !

763
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:03,513
Despair will do just as well.

764
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:17,196
Excuse me...

765
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,391
I'm looking for my daughter.

766
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:23,872
Harry hates the court you get.

767
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,557
He's a director, right?

768
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,197
You've never heard of it ?

769
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,392
Oh, he would cringe!

770
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:35,279
Can you help me ?

771
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,955
We'll  make you the big game.

772
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:50,469
Harry was highly ... listed in France.

773
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:57,872
How does he give to the actors ...

774
01:03:58,280 --> 01:03:59,633
all these indications?

775
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:02,434
Famous men attract me.

776
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,995
You have something on your costume.

777
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:09,548
But I have no repairing marks from you.

778
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:11,591
Are you very famous?

779
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,513
Are you a celebrity,

780
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:16,154
or are we just playing the big game for you?

781
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:35,677
I could have loved you, you know.

782
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,033
I tried.

783
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,795
I'm not even sure I love your father anymore.

784
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:59,392
Spielberg doesn't shoot films, but comics.

785
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,477
It shouldn't bother you.

786
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,113
Blablabla! Comics !

787
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:05,390
Why ban comics?

788
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,959
There is no longer a bit of energy in the American movies.

789
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:14,718
I counted twelve murders ...

790
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:17,195
and an ax-fight in your last movie.

791
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:18,753
Energy was still flowing there.

792
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:22,238
It does in violence ...

793
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:24,671
because there is no other theme ...

794
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,029
except for the French.

795
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,237
France knows each other in love.

796
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,112
America knows nothing about that.

797
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:33,311
Rape, perhaps, but not love.

798
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:35,750
You are crazy, Harry. Crazy.

799
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,559
You Americans ...

800
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:39,398
you love your deficiencies.

801
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:42,034
The French love those of others.

802
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:04,150
When I want to see a train station, I go to the Musée d'Orsay.

803
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:07,439
When I want to see a museum, I go to Beaubourg.

804
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:10,115
Have you seen Elsie?

805
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:45,839
After 2 years with the Frenchies, I know the picture.

806
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:51,075
A third of the day: Work.

807
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,436
Another third: Sleep ...

808
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,238
and on the last: Judge others.

809
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:02,759
Basic principle with Frenchies:

810
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,598
Be wary of their hugs.

811
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:08,189
Fabulous country if you are an artist ...

812
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:11,352
but what a band of cow skins!

813
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,433
Have you seen my wife?

814
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:28,030
Where can we find something to drink here?

815
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:04,755
No !

816
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:07,515
Elsie...

817
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:10,952
what are you doing here ?

818
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:12,674
And you ?

819
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,351
I was close, and ...

820
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:17,438
and ... the couch ...

821
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:18,640
Me too.

822
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:22,918
And ... something ... below ... or above ...

823
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:24,120
Me too.

824
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:28,560
What did they say ?

825
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,228
Didn't you hear?

826
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:36,352
She asked Mr. Gauthier if he likes Americans,

827
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:37,834
and he said ...

828
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:40,517
He said...?

829
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:43,951
That he didn't understand why an American as bad as you ...

830
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:46,116
may have been asked to come to France.

831
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:48,155
Did he say that?

832
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:52,118
He said he and his friends are making fun of you.

833
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:57,996
They don't like the Americans who play to be European.

834
01:09:58,200 --> 01:09:59,553
Did he say that?

835
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:06,278
No no. He didn't say that.

836
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:07,480
What did he say ?

837
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:09,193
He said he likes you.

838
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:11,428
It looked good to me.

839
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:14,154
And he said that I am a monster!

840
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:16,079
He didn't say that.

841
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,232
Yes, exactly.

842
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:27,678
- And he's right. - Doesn't that remind you of anything?

843
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:34,634
At three years old, you locked yourself in the entrance hall ...

844
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:38,230
and you invented things to scare you ...

845
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:40,749
Like there now.

846
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:43,958
It's not true. That's exactly what he said.

847
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:48,312
When I found you, I was tenderly trying to get you out ...

848
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:51,512
but you were dragging me inside, with you.

849
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,916
We would sit in the dark ...

850
01:10:55,440 --> 01:11:00,036
and I would tell you stories to reassure you.

851
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:01,514
It's not true.

852
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:07,079
And ... I remember ... I invented ...

853
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:11,478
I invented ... this little cat for you ... Sally Catt.

854
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:16,436
I was telling you stories of Sally Catt ...

855
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:22,078
and you asked me again and again.

856
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:26,194
You used to be unhappy ...

857
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:29,315
and sometimes you didn't say why.

858
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:33,077
But you were taking me to this cubbyhole ...

859
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:36,951
and you were telling everything ... to Sally Catt.

860
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:40,709
I don't believe it ! It's a lie !

861
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:44,118
You have never been nice to me!

862
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:51,839
This is remarkable.

863
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:53,679
It's in French.

864
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:58,392
It is still remarkable. You are 19, right? No ?

865
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:00,113
20 out of 20.

866
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:05,199
Mr. Gauthier hasn't read yet my thesis.

867
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:08,273
He won't read it, Dad.

868
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:09,960
And.

869
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:12,558
Oh, you are!

870
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,194
I'm your father.

871
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,677
Have you seen Gauthier?

872
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:32,752
Have you seen my wife?

873
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:35,469
Superb disguise. It's nothing.

874
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,514
Adorable, this way of responding ...

875
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:17,395
to my "Me, Tarzan" ... "You, Jane".

876
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,674
What a beautiful night!

877
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,710
Irresistible, the night air.

878
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:34,598
Christian, my daughter wrote her thesis for you, and I told her ...

879
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:38,918
Delicious child, so adoring in front of her father.

880
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:42,638
It's normal, isn't it?

881
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:47,517
If I'm lucky enough to have a child ...

882
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,150
We can dream. Is not it ?

883
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,035
Joey...

884
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:59,073
I would like...

885
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:03,398
a girl ... exactly ... like ... exactly ...

886
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,836
Go away, or I'll jump!

887
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:50,636
Perhaps there is a simple explanation.

888
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:55,630
To hang on a wall, like a human fly?

889
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:01,199
Hide and seek?

890
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,516
I saw him kissing Lena.

891
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:05,880
Hold on!

892
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:10,235
You can't leave like this. You are always painted!

893
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:26,033
And shit ...

894
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:38,958
But what ...

895
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:44,599
Why is the water not flowing? Let it be known that you are here!

896
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,268
You landed in my bath, demanding an explanation.

897
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:48,708
Get out!

898
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:53,279
And then, basically ...

899
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,280
Come in.

900
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:00,996
I don't take it against Lena. I'm blaming myself!

901
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:05,628
Since I have been here,

902
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:08,673
I'm just spades-spades-spades.

903
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,314
And I'm groaning, groaning, groaning.

904
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,989
Elsie this! Elsie that!

905
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:21,479
Lena hates Elsie. Normal: Elsie can't see her.

906
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:25,593
And I'm beating her ears with my Elsie, Elsie ...

907
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:28,196
Poor American so sad!

908
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:31,278
I knew I shouldn't have come!

909
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:35,673
All the mistakes I've made in my life ...

910
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:39,111
started ... when I left the house.

911
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:42,478
Because I'm cooler.

912
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:44,911
You're not in the best of shape.

913
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,838
I'm doing my best...

914
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:49,270
- You're a terrible lover. - When I am tired ?

915
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:50,515
Yes, no...

916
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:54,233
Excuse me, did you see my father?

917
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,073
He is dead.

918
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:02,748
Perhaps...

919
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:03,960
What?

920
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:06,876
Maybe are you my destiny?

921
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:08,600
What?

922
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:11,593
The moment you got home ...

923
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:14,553
I was suffused by your sadness.

924
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:20,872
You are the saddest American I've ever seen.

925
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,915
Suffused, what is it?

926
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,433
Submerged.

927
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:32,477
Of all the Americans Christian brings me ...

928
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:37,751
none, until now, had your beautiful melancholy.

929
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:42,039
Do you know why I was taking a bath?

930
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:45,069
I was escaping from your sadness.

931
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:50,035
Yes. I was trying to drown my sudden ...

932
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:52,470
my irrepressible concern.

933
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:56,034
His misconduct with Lena!

934
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:59,799
I will strangle my son for this betrayal.

935
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,956
It's all my fault.

936
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:04,754
He makes fun of her, you know.

937
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:09,670
You are taking him as a rascal, but below ...

938
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:12,348
he is very sensitive.

939
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:16,274
My son is single at heart,

940
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:18,277
women's nightmare.

941
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:23,110
In a week at most ...

942
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:25,836
he will come back to you.

943
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:34,273
But what is happening to me?

944
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:35,515
Calm down...

945
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:39,269
I'll explain everything to you.

946
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,837
Do you see how our two cultures differ?

947
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:46,989
The American makes his "mea-culpa" ...

948
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:48,835
French...

949
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:51,079
Explain.

950
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:53,920
Help !

951
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:56,794
My husband is chasing me!

952
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,991
He is saying I'll fuck with you!

953
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:04,400
Bitch!

954
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,877
Where are you, bitch?

955
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:14,112
What's gotten into you?

956
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:15,878
Come on ... come on ... get out of there!

957
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:17,354
Get out of there! Hop!

958
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:19,679
It's your room!

959
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:24,153
Good God ! Don't you have an outfit?

960
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:27,034
What are you doing to my wife, old pedal?

961
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:31,598
Why do you all have to unpack your problems?

962
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,074
Manure!

963
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:34,760
Get out of there!

964
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:37,120
Stop it !

965
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:39,276
Rape! Rape!

966
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,352
I'm going to rip your heart out!

967
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,910
Get out of my house!

968
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:45,959
He is raping my wife!

969
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:49,277
Get out of my room! Furniture!

970
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:51,357
You have the spirit of your movies!

971
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:53,232
You are crazy !

972
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,795
He is old ! He is fragile!

973
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,280
Too old for your violence!

974
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,278
We should put him in a cage.

975
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:03,517
Is this chair too old for my violence?

976
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:07,677
And this vase?

977
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:10,200
This painting...

978
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,312
too old for my violence?

979
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,393
And is that too old?

980
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:16,439
Is it too old for my violence?

981
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:20,356
I know the violence. I went to war.

982
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:23,916
Brute ! Butcher! Fascist!

983
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:25,520
Pork!

984
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Christian !

985
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:42,794
Now France will never finance your films again ...

986
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,433
poor con!

987
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:46,999
Do you have anything ?

988
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,796
Why did you call me fragile?

989
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:58,040
Help !

990
01:20:58,640 --> 01:20:59,640
Help !

991
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:01,480
Help !

992
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:11,234
I always hated his movies.

993
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:12,640
Oh my God !

994
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:14,870
What's gotten into you? Are you crazy ?

995
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:15,960
Stop it! Stop it!

996
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:17,753
It's Lena!

997
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:20,596
Stop it! Stop it!

998
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:26,716
Everything is my fault!

999
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:29,914
Everything is my fault!

1000
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:36,838
How could you?

1001
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:39,476
You leave my father alone!

1002
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:43,878
I have enough. Enough, you hear? Completed.

1003
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:48,029
No more good pear! At the zoo, you spit out your peanuts!

1004
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:51,232
No more good pear! I took you to the circus ...

1005
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:53,392
and you threw your coke at me.

1006
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:55,238
Fed up! No more pear!

1007
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,520
Finished, the: "What to do for this abandoned kid?"

1008
01:21:57,720 --> 01:21:59,676
You deserve to feel abandoned!

1009
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:00,920
And you too !

1010
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:03,320
You too !

1011
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:52,274
I want to go to the airport.

1012
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:00,871
I want to go to the airport.

1013
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:10,358
I'll pay in good American dollars, that ...

1014
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:14,348
who will take me to the airport ... to fly ...

1015
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:20,070
... fly to America, the USA ...

1016
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:28,879
"I pledge allegiance to the Flag" ...

1017
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:31,313
Doesn't mean anything to you, does it?

1018
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:41,075
One of you must speak English well. You?

1019
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:43,875
Do you speak English?

1020
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:50,999
I have to leave Paris.

1021
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:54,909
I'll pay in good American dollars ...

1022
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:57,076
You understand "dollars".

1023
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:59,953
Everyone understands "dollar".

1024
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:02,875
... so that they take me to ...

1025
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:07,876
What is this fucking airport called?

1026
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:09,991
Airport! Airport!

1027
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:14,079
What do you all have?

1028
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:17,238
Nobody speaks a little English?

1029
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:21,274
But anyway ... isn't anyone going to help me?

1030
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:25,230
I am an American citizen. I'm American.

1031
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:28,352
United States. Humphrey Bogart.

1032
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:31,235
Henry Fonda. John Wayne.

1033
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,069
Clint Eastwood.

1034
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:38,430
I'm a personal friend of Clint Eastwood.

1035
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:43,239
Clint Eastwood wants you to take me to ...

1036
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:56,599
Excuse me sir.

1037
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:01,718
Please, Mr. plane ...

1038
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,353
What do you want ?

1039
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:30,875
I want to go back home.

1040
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:32,434
Thank you so much.

1041
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:36,198
Is it so hard to understand?

1042
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:40,753
Yes. It's hard to understand.

1043
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:44,432
I'll tell you why.

1044
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:46,949
Tell you exactly.

1045
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:49,910
Because I understood everything.

1046
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:55,996
At home, the goal of the game is that everything ...

1047
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:59,397
is made to be hard to understand.

1048
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:00,794
Yes. Good.

1049
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:04,120
Including my own daughter.

1050
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:08,028
Including my partner.

1051
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:13,671
Including those who call themselves my friends.

1052
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:16,239
I'm a cartoonist.

1053
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:18,954
I apologize if it doesn't go well enough.

1054
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:20,479
I'm an American.

1055
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:24,468
Before, everyone was speaking in American.

1056
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:28,399
In the films about the Second World War ...

1057
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:31,910
all French are speaking American.

1058
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:33,269
Thank you so much.

1059
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:36,919
I've fought in World War II.

1060
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:42,118
I helped you in the "Journal aux Armées".

1061
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:47,437
I was making drawings during our occupation.

1062
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:51,633
Against the Nazis, I made drawings.

1063
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:53,671
We were allies.

1064
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:27,593
"Tonight, let's taste the salt of life ...

1065
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:31,834
"Music and candles ...

1066
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:37,274
"Restrained passion ... love is flowing freely ..."

1067
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:40,631
Here ! Here !!

1068
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:44,355
Superb! It was superb.

1069
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:46,676
I don't know that one.

1070
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:49,678
But maybe you know this one?

1071
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:52,155
"The party is over,

1072
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:55,716
"the candle flames are dropping and going out ...

1073
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:57,592
"You have danced and dreamed ..."

1074
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:07,908
"I'm having you in my skin..."

1075
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:14,114
Lets go ahead ... it has started so well!

1076
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:16,954
I know you know some of them.

1077
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:19,879
These are old successes!

1078
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:23,550
"Me, champagne does nothing to me ..."

1079
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:25,751
This is Cole Porter, ok!

1080
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:30,351
"In the seventh heaven with the man of my life ...

1081
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:33,154
"Y a nothing with..."

1082
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:36,278
Nothing, hear? Nothing.

1083
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:40,031
OK. Continue on.

1084
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:42,269
"You are the cream ...

1085
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:45,517
"the colossus...

1086
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:47,599
"You are the cream ...

1087
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:50,836
"the museum of Louvre."

1088
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:53,595
The Louvre museum.

1089
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:55,675
That's it!

1090
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:57,833
That's it!

1091
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:01,556
Does anyone have a pencil?

1092
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:08,837
He must have passed from here.

1093
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,752
Someone must have seen him.

1094
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:14,516
We will never see each other again.

1095
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:18,118
How sad not to known each other much earlier!

1096
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:19,548
What's the point ?

1097
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:21,159
For us to know each other ?

1098
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:23,634
When did we met each other?

1099
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:47,154
He's a Wellman.

1100
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:00,918
And that is ...

1101
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:03,520
Hepp Catt.

1102
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:04,800
Hepp.

1103
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:08,760
That's it!

1104
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:13,916
"It's not-amazing!"

1105
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,752
I'm very hungry.

1106
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,198
That's it!

1107
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:44,879
It was despicable.

1108
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:46,195
Yes. Dad...

1109
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:49,109
My darling...

1110
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,275
I'm sorry, dad ... so sorry ...

1111
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:56,436
Calm down.

1112
01:30:57,800 --> 01:30:59,119
My girl.

1113
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:09,279
That's it!

1114
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:13,156
I have made myself some friends.

1115
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:16,591
Draw me Sally Catt.

1116
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:19,517
Draw me Sally Catt.

1117
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:24,396
I thought you didn't like my job.

1118
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:28,434
One day may be we would be able to talk about it again.

1119
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:32,432
I'm not ready.

1120
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,120
I'm coming home, dad.

1121
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:36,317
No.

1122
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:37,953
It's time.

1123
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:40,872
It's plus time.

1124
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:44,311
I'm not holding anything against you anymore.

1125
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,831
Are you still mad at me?

1126
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:54,071
I never wanted you.

1127
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:56,236
You have always disapproved me.

1128
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:58,950
You freaked me out.

1129
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:08,750
I'll take you home.

1130
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,194
Elsie...

1131
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:20,114
I had never been anywhere before.

1132
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:24,189
Nowhere.

1133
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,470
I don't know ... if I'm ready to go home.

1134
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:54,110
Can I stay, Elsie?

1135
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:59,633
Would you mind ... Elsie if ... I stay?

1136
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:35,269
In any case...

1137
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:39,315
please take care of my father.

1138
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:43,269
...How do you say...

1139
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,670
At home, he isn't quiet

1140
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:50,076
but if he could be here ...

1141
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,309
BD and Sequential Art

1142
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,638
Can I talk with you for a moment?

1143
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:35,438
I told you my horrors.

1144
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:39,079
And I regret.

1145
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:41,069
Very strong.

1146
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:46,514
A little water more ?

1147
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:48,551
No, thank you, this ...

1148
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:52,469
Excuse me, I didn't mean to disturb you ...

1149
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:55,719
He will come back.

1150
01:35:57,040 --> 01:35:58,234
You think ?

1151
01:35:58,600 --> 01:35:59,600
Yes Yes.

1152
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:04,352
Do I want him to come back?

1153
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:05,993
We are all coming back.

1154
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:09,313
Are you coming back?

1155
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:12,240
Is it true ?

1156
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:19,196
My little girl...

1157
01:36:20,120 --> 01:36:21,394
Can I help you ?

1158
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:30,759
Have you seen ?

1159
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:32,791
He's a cartoonist!

1160
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:46,080
Izzy ?

1161
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:49,200
Yes, Joey. I'm here.

1162
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:51,470
Was I going too fast?

1163
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:57,115
Izzy? If I'm talking too much about myself ...

1164
01:36:57,320 --> 01:37:02,394
as you, all Americans, are thinking, you fire me.

1165
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:08,477
If I'm spreading my secrets, like any American ...

1166
01:37:08,680 --> 01:37:13,515
if I'm overly overflowing, overly sincere ... you fire me.

1167
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:18,157
Don't explain anything to me. You fire me. You only have ...

1168
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:19,755
Yes, Joey.

1169
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:20,513
