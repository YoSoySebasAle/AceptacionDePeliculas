1
00:00:33,389 --> 00:00:35,591
It's a little girl, my lady.

2
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:37,880
She's beautiful.

3
00:00:38,947 --> 00:00:41,087
My baby.

4
00:00:42,217 --> 00:00:44,302
Poor little creature.

5
00:00:44,742 --> 00:00:47,134
I'd like to see you grow.

6
00:00:47,322 --> 00:00:49,142
But you must survive.

7
00:00:50,114 --> 00:00:54,103
Take her to the convent.
Please promise you'll protect her.

8
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:56,598
And don't let them take her.

9
00:00:57,068 --> 00:00:59,405
Swear. Swear.

10
00:00:59,581 --> 00:01:01,827
I swear.
I will protect her.

11
00:01:01,976 --> 00:01:04,557
I'll take her to the convent.

12
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,591
Justine, at last you're here.

13
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:35,491
This way Justine.

14
00:03:36,788 --> 00:03:39,087
We were so sorry to hear
about your parents' death.

15
00:03:40,475 --> 00:03:42,715
We've been expecting you
for several days now.

16
00:03:42,908 --> 00:03:44,000
Come on.

17
00:03:44,165 --> 00:03:45,468
Come on!

18
00:03:50,536 --> 00:03:52,720
Here she is, Justine.

19
00:03:53,101 --> 00:03:57,992
Yes Mother Superior, I know Danielle
has been very happy here with you.

20
00:03:58,145 --> 00:04:00,241
- Excuse me mother.
- That's alright.

21
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:01,491
They were just leaving.

22
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,893
Now young lady,
I hope you will not forget us.

23
00:04:03,998 --> 00:04:06,632
No of course not.
She'll be back again next summer.

24
00:04:06,882 --> 00:04:10,245
You've done wonders and soon
she'll be able to do things for herself.

25
00:04:10,397 --> 00:04:12,123
Won't you darling?

26
00:04:12,772 --> 00:04:15,129
I'm sorry I can't stay,
but we have to get back to the village.

27
00:04:15,282 --> 00:04:17,372
Patients get restless you know.

28
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,758
Mother... This is Justine.

29
00:04:21,981 --> 00:04:24,763
- Reverend Mother.
- Now child.

30
00:04:25,127 --> 00:04:28,532
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Life must go on.

31
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,329
What you need now is rest.

32
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,258
- Is the room ready Sister Angelica.
- Yes Mother.

33
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,084
Remember Justine.
From now on, this is your home.

34
00:04:38,337 --> 00:04:41,414
- Sister Angelica will show you the way.
- Thank you.

35
00:04:48,552 --> 00:04:50,876
You will find a new life here Justine.

36
00:04:51,111 --> 00:04:52,544
Come along.

37
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:56,536
Now you have to think of yourself.

38
00:04:56,637 --> 00:05:01,299
Remember the Lord will always be
here to guide you. And so will I.

39
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,395
Come right this way Justine.
This is your room.

40
00:05:08,771 --> 00:05:12,481
Let me open the window
to let in some fresh air and sun.

41
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,794
And this... is your bed.

42
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:21,548
Now promise me
you'll try to get some rest.

43
00:05:23,188 --> 00:05:27,001
- We'll call you in time for supper.
- Thank you Sister.

44
00:05:31,035 --> 00:05:32,328
- Justine.
- Yes?

45
00:05:33,754 --> 00:05:38,346
I hope you'll be happy here.
But if ever you're in need or troubled

46
00:05:38,645 --> 00:05:40,862
Please don't hesitate
to call on me. Alright?

47
00:05:41,361 --> 00:05:42,273
Thank you, Sister.

48
00:06:18,983 --> 00:06:20,340
Hello.

49
00:06:21,378 --> 00:06:23,195
I'm Alucarda.

50
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:26,949
- My name is Justine.
- Who's that?

51
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,275
My mother and my father.

52
00:06:30,854 --> 00:06:35,007
- Mother just died.
- I never met my mother or my father.

53
00:06:35,153 --> 00:06:38,946
- I'm sorry.
- I've got something to show you too.

54
00:06:39,485 --> 00:06:43,079
These are things I never show anyone.
They're secret.

55
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:46,573
Every day I find a new secret.
Look.

56
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:49,348
Look at all this.
It belongs to me.

57
00:06:49,668 --> 00:06:52,124
This for instance.

58
00:06:53,216 --> 00:06:55,791
It means I like you.

59
00:06:57,848 --> 00:07:00,204
And this.

60
00:07:04,597 --> 00:07:06,851
Do you know how
small creatures love each other?

61
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:07,943
No.

62
00:07:08,411 --> 00:07:11,665
I'll show you. I'll take you
to the gardens, to the woods.

63
00:07:11,905 --> 00:07:13,782
Everything is there.

64
00:07:19,261 --> 00:07:20,719
What's that?

65
00:07:21,058 --> 00:07:23,334
I've never seen
anything like them before.

66
00:07:24,596 --> 00:07:26,273
It's one more secret.

67
00:07:26,972 --> 00:07:28,969
One is identical to the other.

68
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,424
It's like an image in a mirror.

69
00:07:32,463 --> 00:07:34,479
Like you and me.

70
00:07:35,137 --> 00:07:37,497
Do you want us to be sisters?

71
00:08:01,594 --> 00:08:04,349
Come on. Come on.

72
00:08:08,365 --> 00:08:10,601
Look.

73
00:08:15,493 --> 00:08:18,967
They are burying a sister.
She killed herself.

74
00:08:19,477 --> 00:08:22,492
They will bury her in unhallowed ground.

75
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:27,344
I'm afraid of funerals.

76
00:08:27,803 --> 00:08:30,908
We have to die.
All of us has to die.

77
00:08:31,287 --> 00:08:33,444
And there's no way we can avoid it.

78
00:09:03,481 --> 00:09:05,618
Don't be afraid.

79
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,506
It's not very far.

80
00:09:13,084 --> 00:09:15,120
Come on.

81
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:22,125
Well, well, well.
What have we here?

82
00:09:35,648 --> 00:09:37,805
Would you like to see...
Oh, please.

83
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:42,746
Please don't be afraid of me. I was just
in the middle of an interesting game.

84
00:09:42,926 --> 00:09:44,803
Would you like to know what it is?

85
00:09:44,931 --> 00:09:46,349
I think we should start back.

86
00:09:46,429 --> 00:09:49,364
Would you like to know
how someone will die.

87
00:09:49,524 --> 00:09:51,979
Or would you like to buy an amulet?

88
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:55,820
Which will bring good luck.
Lots, lots.

89
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,434
I have many more things
myself, in these woods.

90
00:09:59,534 --> 00:10:02,649
Follow. Don't be afraid. Follow.

91
00:10:04,013 --> 00:10:05,913
Come on.

92
00:10:06,002 --> 00:10:06,602
No.

93
00:10:06,734 --> 00:10:09,410
Come on. He won't hurt us.

94
00:10:15,904 --> 00:10:18,419
Justine!

95
00:10:20,835 --> 00:10:22,632
Alucarda!

96
00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:45,543
Don't believe such a creature.
He'll only tell you lies.

97
00:10:46,222 --> 00:10:48,478
Better let me read your hand.

98
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:52,601
- Oh, my God...
- What did you see?

99
00:10:52,841 --> 00:10:56,814
Nothing.
Perhaps a reflection of her own dreams.

100
00:10:57,651 --> 00:11:01,104
I see nothing.
Only shadows...

101
00:11:01,235 --> 00:11:02,573
Take care.

102
00:11:03,461 --> 00:11:04,979
She's yours.

103
00:11:05,213 --> 00:11:07,699
Sell her your charms
for the supernatural.

104
00:11:07,869 --> 00:11:10,804
Look at the
marvelous things that I have.

105
00:11:10,964 --> 00:11:15,396
Among other things I profess the useful
art of alchemy. I can turn dust

106
00:11:15,566 --> 00:11:17,583
into precious stones.

107
00:11:17,723 --> 00:11:21,750
and these, in dreams never imagined.

108
00:11:21,969 --> 00:11:25,120
And you, young lady.
Look.

109
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:28,598
This knife was the tear
of a gypsy girl.

110
00:11:28,749 --> 00:11:32,668
What strange eyes
this girl has. Deep, sharp,

111
00:11:32,824 --> 00:11:36,556
mysterious.
As the birds in the forest.

112
00:11:36,811 --> 00:11:40,824
I see clearly.
Your past and future, your dreams.

113
00:11:41,044 --> 00:11:44,578
You've come from the dew in the forest
and there they will be waiting for you.

114
00:11:44,668 --> 00:11:48,242
Strange creatures they are,
and you must take care.

115
00:11:48,951 --> 00:11:54,262
If it obsesses the young lady,
here I am and here is my box of charms.

116
00:11:54,646 --> 00:11:58,899
If she wishes I will
make her free from such a dream.

117
00:11:59,056 --> 00:12:04,866
then if the dream comes true,
I shall be expecting her.

118
00:12:06,403 --> 00:12:08,400
Hey, where are you going?

119
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:11,086
Did I offend her?

120
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:20,406
Alucarda!
Alucarda, wait.

121
00:12:28,716 --> 00:12:30,713
Look.

122
00:12:50,731 --> 00:12:53,107
It looks so familiar.

123
00:12:54,165 --> 00:12:56,940
- Let's go inside.
- No! This place scares me.

124
00:12:57,115 --> 00:12:59,331
Let's go back.

125
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:03,684
Are you afraid?
Justine

126
00:13:05,092 --> 00:13:07,468
This is simply beautiful.

127
00:13:08,306 --> 00:13:10,802
Come.

128
00:13:50,088 --> 00:13:53,063
I hear the voices from the past.

129
00:13:53,322 --> 00:13:57,815
I feel as if I've been here before.
I remember every stone and branch.

130
00:13:58,424 --> 00:14:02,058
It's as if I lost this world
a long time ago.

131
00:14:04,369 --> 00:14:09,061
One can live eternally instead
of turning into a little pile of dust.

132
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,277
Are you...

133
00:14:11,756 --> 00:14:14,212
- Are you afraid of dying?
- Yes.

134
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:16,077
Everyone is.

135
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:20,212
I mean dying, loving each other.
Dying together, to live as one forever.

136
00:14:20,352 --> 00:14:23,486
With the same blood always flowing
through our veins.

137
00:14:23,681 --> 00:14:25,957
Darling. Darling Justine.

138
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:29,352
I live in you.
Would you die for me?

139
00:14:29,551 --> 00:14:31,249
I love you so.

140
00:14:31,478 --> 00:14:34,873
I have never been in love with anyone.
And never shall.

141
00:14:35,142 --> 00:14:36,850
Unless it's with you.

142
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:40,463
- Do you mean that?
- You're quite right to ask.

143
00:14:40,907 --> 00:14:46,098
You don't know how dear you are to me.
I hope you love me as I love you.

144
00:14:47,272 --> 00:14:51,105
Call me cruel and selfish,
but love is always selfish.

145
00:14:51,564 --> 00:14:54,839
You don't know how jealous I am.
I want you to love me to death.

146
00:14:54,974 --> 00:14:59,267
Alucarda, for the love of God,
Don't talk to me of death.

147
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:03,440
I have a dream.
The memory of a night.

148
00:15:03,794 --> 00:15:07,727
I was almost murdered.
Wounded here.

149
00:15:08,047 --> 00:15:10,044
I was never the same again.

150
00:15:10,163 --> 00:15:13,717
- Were you near death?
- Very close.

151
00:15:15,445 --> 00:15:17,721
Let's make a pact.

152
00:15:21,405 --> 00:15:24,839
If we ever depart from this life,
we shall do it together.

153
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:28,004
We shall do it together,

154
00:15:28,503 --> 00:15:32,117
Alright. If it makes you happy.

155
00:15:51,398 --> 00:15:54,053
No, Alucarda!

156
00:15:55,206 --> 00:15:57,203
Wait.

157
00:16:00,956 --> 00:16:04,473
Lucille died in 1850.

158
00:16:05,858 --> 00:16:07,615
15 years ago Justine.

159
00:16:07,955 --> 00:16:10,995
Our age.
See what's there.

160
00:16:11,414 --> 00:16:13,311
I'm afraid Alucarda.

161
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,576
- Let's open it.
- No.

162
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:20,509
My God!

163
00:16:56,889 --> 00:17:01,142
I told you this place frightened me.
Look what it's done to you.

164
00:17:01,361 --> 00:17:03,797
Please let's go back.

165
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,767
It's cold. I'm shivering.

166
00:17:08,135 --> 00:17:10,807
We have to
Go back.

167
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,822
Go back. Go back!

168
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:17,228
The devil enters the body of
the person he wants to control.

169
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:21,706
Uses the organs of that body
for his own pleasure.

170
00:17:21,931 --> 00:17:25,863
And performs feats,
far above the capacity, strength

171
00:17:25,999 --> 00:17:29,149
and ability of
the person thus possessed.

172
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,405
Here in the holy book

173
00:17:31,562 --> 00:17:35,015
for the knowledge of mankind,

174
00:17:35,212 --> 00:17:40,743
since the days of our lord, and even
before, Satan and the other demons

175
00:17:40,868 --> 00:17:43,618
have persecuted the souls of Christians.

176
00:17:43,732 --> 00:17:47,685
they make no distinction
between men, women and children.

177
00:17:47,904 --> 00:17:53,575
He, the devil,
uses the bodies of others as his own,

178
00:17:53,802 --> 00:17:56,427
destroying those he wants to dominate.

179
00:17:56,583 --> 00:18:00,880
Perverting their language
and distorting their lips.

180
00:18:01,034 --> 00:18:04,190
Froth exits their mouths
rather than words.

181
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,596
Lead a virtuous life and place
yourselves in the hands of Our Lord.

182
00:18:09,849 --> 00:18:13,105
You must live within
the rules of our religion.

183
00:18:13,255 --> 00:18:16,411
The only true religion.
Otherwise

184
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:20,724
the devil will find
a place inside our bodies

185
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,177
and take our souls away.
And then...

186
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:27,880
we shall burn in hell forever.

187
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:31,145
Throughout eternity.
Your souls will find no rest.

188
00:18:31,223 --> 00:18:34,442
Your bodies will suffer eternal torture.

189
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:38,739
The wrath of Satan has no mercy.
Repent!

190
00:18:38,895 --> 00:18:43,645
Oh, God, please help me.
I don't want to burn in hell.

191
00:18:43,864 --> 00:18:45,864
Calm down.

192
00:18:48,926 --> 00:18:52,723
Justine, what's wrong.
Answer me.

193
00:19:16,746 --> 00:19:19,605
Are you feeling better now?
What happened?

194
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:21,886
I don't know.

195
00:19:28,398 --> 00:19:30,398
She shouldn't be left alone.

196
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,351
She should rest for a while.

197
00:19:34,734 --> 00:19:36,484
I can look after her.

198
00:19:38,265 --> 00:19:40,234
Please don't leave me alone.

199
00:19:41,062 --> 00:19:42,687
I can stay with her.

200
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,938
Would you like to stay Alucarda?

201
00:19:49,017 --> 00:19:50,735
Alright.

202
00:19:51,314 --> 00:19:53,720
We'll leave her in your care, Alucarda.

203
00:19:59,428 --> 00:20:01,287
If you need anything, I won't be far.

204
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:18,736
Monsters! Monsters!
They have done this to you.

205
00:20:19,064 --> 00:20:22,220
Justine. Don't tell of our secret.

206
00:20:22,376 --> 00:20:25,611
I hear voices.
Voices from the past.

207
00:20:26,111 --> 00:20:29,982
The same dark voices.
They were soft at first.

208
00:20:30,267 --> 00:20:32,908
I was looking at the trees

209
00:20:33,154 --> 00:20:35,654
and the voices began to speak to me.

210
00:20:35,857 --> 00:20:40,326
Coming from the forest.
I can hear them clearly Justine.

211
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:46,247
Only you and me.
Only you and me Justine.

212
00:20:47,278 --> 00:20:49,825
My God, I'm so scared.

213
00:20:50,637 --> 00:20:55,200
We will make them pay. Bit by bit.
For all they have taken away from us.

214
00:20:55,668 --> 00:20:57,090
Alucarda.

215
00:20:58,168 --> 00:21:01,575
Lucifer.
Lucifer.

216
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:04,203
Satan! Lucifer!

217
00:21:06,012 --> 00:21:09,668
Alucarda, for God's sake.

218
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,637
What's happening?

219
00:21:50,478 --> 00:21:52,760
Please!

220
00:22:01,247 --> 00:22:03,919
Alucarda, please stop it.

221
00:22:13,836 --> 00:22:16,783
Death! Death! Death!

222
00:22:18,305 --> 00:22:22,180
- Death.
- Alucarda. Please, no.

223
00:22:32,399 --> 00:22:34,867
Alucarda. Answer me.

224
00:22:35,023 --> 00:22:38,180
Answer me, please. Answer me.

225
00:22:41,399 --> 00:22:44,117
We'll make a pact
and seal it with our blood.

226
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:46,383
We'll make them pay.

227
00:22:49,133 --> 00:22:52,289
You're right.
We'll make them pay.

228
00:22:54,367 --> 00:22:57,443
To start with, a little rain.

229
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:00,102
Thunder!

230
00:23:02,117 --> 00:23:05,883
Call him. Call him. Call him!

231
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:10,164
Lucifer!
Satan!

232
00:23:52,945 --> 00:23:55,570
Look at me.
You're so beautiful, Justine.

233
00:24:11,358 --> 00:24:13,623
Look at me. Look at me.

234
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:18,436
Now you shall blend. One with the other.

235
00:24:18,561 --> 00:24:21,608
one with the other.
And then...

236
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:25,702
blend into me.

237
00:25:55,665 --> 00:25:58,727
Look at me, dear Justine.

238
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:53,612
Welcome Justine.

239
00:27:56,641 --> 00:28:01,344
Giver of all gifts.
Of flowers and fruits.

240
00:28:06,325 --> 00:28:11,341
Jesus. give me strength.

241
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:13,310
Please.

242
00:28:14,169 --> 00:28:17,091
Behold the body of thy new servant.

243
00:28:22,278 --> 00:28:23,935
My Lord.

244
00:28:25,014 --> 00:28:28,089
Don't abandon me.

245
00:28:28,842 --> 00:28:34,552
Manifest your spirit.
Satan... Lucifer.

246
00:28:40,463 --> 00:28:44,044
Do not abandon me Lord.

247
00:28:44,869 --> 00:28:47,362
We beseech thee, Satan.

248
00:28:47,506 --> 00:28:49,273
God!

249
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:09,984
Save Justine.

250
00:29:16,011 --> 00:29:18,464
Don't abandon her Lord.

251
00:29:36,553 --> 00:29:39,403
Please keep her from harm.

252
00:30:32,111 --> 00:30:36,564
Today we will continue studying
the teachings of Saint Theresa.

253
00:30:38,071 --> 00:30:40,274
And this is what the devil does.

254
00:30:40,415 --> 00:30:43,868
To beget his evil
he obtains help from our virtues.

255
00:30:44,024 --> 00:30:47,743
Even if the gain is small,
his harvest is great.

256
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:54,076
But God in his infinite wisdom
understands the wiles of the devil.

257
00:30:54,404 --> 00:30:58,888
And so gives us the strength
to face them with noble thoughts

258
00:30:58,994 --> 00:31:01,213
and prayer.
In this way,

259
00:31:05,088 --> 00:31:07,385
I trust that you have been listening.

260
00:31:07,728 --> 00:31:09,072
Yes Sister.

261
00:31:09,403 --> 00:31:11,950
Then you can repeat
what I have just read.

262
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,012
Well, Alucarda?

263
00:31:18,872 --> 00:31:20,653
Stand up child.

264
00:31:22,794 --> 00:31:24,794
And this is what the devil does.

265
00:31:24,934 --> 00:31:27,746
He grants us virtues
to expand his kingdom.

266
00:31:27,965 --> 00:31:30,043
The only valid one.

267
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:36,934
God with his lack of knowledge
does not understand this truth,

268
00:31:37,703 --> 00:31:41,031
and opposes it with
false thoughts and prayers.

269
00:31:41,171 --> 00:31:43,406
God. Silence!

270
00:31:48,141 --> 00:31:50,938
I renounce the other God
and all the saints.

271
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:54,500
Don't listen, don't listen to them.

272
00:31:54,672 --> 00:31:56,703
Lord and master.

273
00:31:56,813 --> 00:31:59,688
Don't listen. Go out of the room.

274
00:31:59,938 --> 00:32:03,782
Go, go, go.

275
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,122
I promise to do all that is evil.

276
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:14,216
I will declare you name to all and will
not cease to serve the Lord of Darkness.

277
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:18,028
My body, my soul
and my life belong to you.

278
00:32:18,731 --> 00:32:21,184
Call the Mother Superior, quickly.

279
00:32:21,325 --> 00:32:24,075
What's wrong with you girls?

280
00:32:31,372 --> 00:32:34,950
God help up, please.

281
00:32:35,184 --> 00:32:38,271
Please, stop it.

282
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:41,349
Alucarda, my child.

283
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:45,036
This is blasphemy.

284
00:32:45,192 --> 00:32:51,317
Listen to me sisters.
This is blasphemy. God help me.

285
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,490
How dare you blaspheme.
Are you mad?

286
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:05,959
Have you taken leave of your senses?
Answer me. Answer me.

287
00:33:06,865 --> 00:33:09,302
I only repeated what you said.

288
00:33:09,427 --> 00:33:11,474
God forgive you.

289
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:15,537
You have just invoked the
kingdom of darkness

290
00:33:15,677 --> 00:33:19,974
and rejected the infinite wisdom of God.

291
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:23,099
And now you deny it.
And Alucarda too.

292
00:33:23,177 --> 00:33:27,302
Liars. Repent.
Here in front of the cross.

293
00:33:27,443 --> 00:33:30,349
Beg. Ask for forgiveness.

294
00:33:40,191 --> 00:33:44,051
- Sister Germana
- Reverend Mother, thank god you're here

295
00:33:44,379 --> 00:33:49,996
I have to inform you of the strange
and blasphemous behaviour of these girls

296
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:54,581
Mother, in front of me
Sister Mary and all the pupils.

297
00:33:54,675 --> 00:33:57,347
Justine and Alucarda
denied the Lord our Christ.

298
00:33:57,472 --> 00:34:03,331
They used the most evil language to
recognise Satan as their Lord and Master

299
00:34:04,144 --> 00:34:06,738
- I can't believe it.
- But it's true.

300
00:34:10,105 --> 00:34:12,511
What have you to say for yourself?

301
00:34:17,636 --> 00:34:19,012
Sister Mary.

302
00:34:19,121 --> 00:34:22,402
Send for the doctor,
perhaps they are ill.

303
00:34:23,543 --> 00:34:25,840
Father Lazarus will be here soon.

304
00:34:25,996 --> 00:34:29,090
I want them both
to be prepared for confession.

305
00:34:29,433 --> 00:34:32,246
- Go, hurry now.
- Yes.

306
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:50,649
- I need more light.
- She gets worse by the minute, doctor.

307
00:35:02,877 --> 00:35:05,408
- How long has she been like this?
- Since this morning.

308
00:35:09,034 --> 00:35:10,534
But she has got much worse.

309
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,928
Her pulse is faint.

310
00:35:41,054 --> 00:35:42,741
Her heart is weak.

311
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:45,972
This girl is very sick.

312
00:35:46,503 --> 00:35:48,940
Pray, Justine.

313
00:35:49,112 --> 00:35:51,190
Pray, my child.

314
00:35:51,722 --> 00:35:54,394
Pray for the sake of your soul.

315
00:35:55,616 --> 00:36:01,413
Pray. Pray Justine. Pray.

316
00:36:20,904 --> 00:36:23,639
What is it girl?
What's the matter?

317
00:36:23,717 --> 00:36:26,701
Easy girl. Easy.

318
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,892
It is your turn now Alucarda.

319
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,557
- Yes my child.
- I... I...

320
00:37:02,013 --> 00:37:05,763
- Yes, go on.
- I was told to come to you.

321
00:37:06,966 --> 00:37:08,481
Speak up then.

322
00:37:08,591 --> 00:37:11,763
I was asked to answer a question
and I did.

323
00:37:11,973 --> 00:37:15,098
And Sister Germana is angry with me.

324
00:37:15,489 --> 00:37:17,286
And for a very good reason.

325
00:37:18,676 --> 00:37:20,848
I am not what you may think father.

326
00:37:22,028 --> 00:37:24,903
The facts were
explained to me my child.

327
00:37:25,185 --> 00:37:26,622
You have sinned.

328
00:37:27,419 --> 00:37:29,419
I don't recall doing anything wrong.

329
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,685
Liars rot in hell for eternity.

330
00:37:32,919 --> 00:37:35,716
I know for sure
that you are doing wrong.

331
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:39,075
Don't miss this opportunity
which has been granted you.

332
00:37:39,903 --> 00:37:42,200
You can tell the truth
here and now.

333
00:37:42,841 --> 00:37:45,841
Perhaps I have done wrong.

334
00:37:45,928 --> 00:37:49,147
I couldn't have lied.
I love life... with

335
00:37:49,694 --> 00:37:51,287
With...

336
00:37:51,459 --> 00:37:54,147
- Go on.
- Justine.

337
00:37:54,506 --> 00:37:58,084
is a close friend of mine.
I love her.

338
00:38:01,069 --> 00:38:04,662
You call yourself blessed, and
believe in eternal life and worship God.

339
00:38:04,842 --> 00:38:08,998
I worship life, you worship death.

340
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:12,310
I love Justine.
You love to kill.

341
00:38:12,435 --> 00:38:16,326
We have made a pact
and sealed it with our blood.

342
00:38:16,547 --> 00:38:18,734
Justine and I

343
00:38:18,859 --> 00:38:22,687
The fault isn't ours, but yours.

344
00:38:22,922 --> 00:38:26,219
You cover your body with a black cassock
as if you are ashamed of it.

345
00:38:26,379 --> 00:38:30,093
But you'd like to
possess me wouldn't you?

346
00:38:30,254 --> 00:38:33,316
Take me.
Take off your cassock.

347
00:38:42,431 --> 00:38:44,900
- What happened Father?
- What happened?

348
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:48,322
Please sister, get her out of here.

349
00:38:49,504 --> 00:38:54,207
My God, no... no.

350
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:15,218
All we can do is wait.

351
00:39:16,405 --> 00:39:18,718
We'll know better tomorrow.

352
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:26,871
- I hope she'll recover.
- I'm convinced she will

353
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:28,808
with the help of the Lord.

354
00:39:51,174 --> 00:39:53,237
The things she said were so horrible.

355
00:39:53,378 --> 00:39:57,550
Please Lord do not abandon us
in such times of difficulty.

356
00:39:59,643 --> 00:40:01,800
You did not hear what she said.
It was the devil.

357
00:40:01,893 --> 00:40:06,768
As if the devil himself
was speaking through her mouth.

358
00:40:10,836 --> 00:40:14,445
These words cannot come from
anyone else, only the devil.

359
00:40:14,773 --> 00:40:18,148
- The devil.
- The devil.

360
00:40:23,509 --> 00:40:24,962
Father Lazarus.

361
00:40:25,087 --> 00:40:28,610
Do you really believe that because
we belong to the church

362
00:40:28,813 --> 00:40:31,563
we are safe from the devil's influence?

363
00:40:31,813 --> 00:40:35,063
I remember when I visited
the archives at the Vatican.

364
00:40:35,203 --> 00:40:39,422
I read many incidents
that had been confirmed.

365
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:42,547
Incidents like this.

366
00:40:42,911 --> 00:40:49,849
In 1491, at the monastery of Cameron
some nuns became immensely strong.

367
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:54,223
They barked like dogs
and predicted the future.

368
00:40:54,364 --> 00:40:56,809
They contaminated
the rest of the community,

369
00:40:56,946 --> 00:41:00,048
and made the monastery
a temple of the devil.

370
00:41:03,937 --> 00:41:08,874
In 1550 the nuns
of the convent of Nazareth

371
00:41:09,249 --> 00:41:11,359
became possessed.

372
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:17,177
They climbed trees like cats
and levitated for hours.

373
00:41:22,924 --> 00:41:26,768
In 1555, in Rome itself,

374
00:41:26,878 --> 00:41:29,331
in an orphanage just like this one,

375
00:41:29,475 --> 00:41:32,897
three orphans were responsible
for horrible things,

376
00:41:33,163 --> 00:41:36,647
which could only be the work
of a diabolical mind.

377
00:41:36,803 --> 00:41:39,663
Two of them became seriously ill.

378
00:41:40,028 --> 00:41:43,934
And the third finally died,
killing all three.

379
00:41:44,309 --> 00:41:47,512
Justine and Alucarda may be possessed.

380
00:41:48,372 --> 00:41:49,825
Mother

381
00:41:49,919 --> 00:41:53,497
The devil is elsewhere,
not in those poor girls.

382
00:41:54,184 --> 00:41:57,512
It looks like we are
the victims of a conspiracy.

383
00:41:58,043 --> 00:42:01,387
Justine and Alucarda
are possessed by the devil.

384
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,653
It's not surprising that Satan

385
00:42:03,762 --> 00:42:06,731
has chosen these delicate creatures.

386
00:42:06,887 --> 00:42:12,200
His plans are directed against
the Holy Church and its representatives.

387
00:42:12,372 --> 00:42:16,419
They may not be possessed
by the devil himself

388
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:18,419
but at least by
one of his evil messengers.

389
00:42:18,901 --> 00:42:20,526
What are we going to do?

390
00:42:20,651 --> 00:42:24,151
We must pray that God can help us.
Jesus Christ

391
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:27,104
Deliver us from this nightmare.
Don't let them...

392
00:42:27,213 --> 00:42:28,666
possess us.

393
00:42:28,776 --> 00:42:31,666
How long has Justine been like this?

394
00:42:33,198 --> 00:42:36,729
Almost a week.
And then she became ill.

395
00:42:37,166 --> 00:42:42,713
She fainted during the hymns
and said the light affected her.

396
00:42:43,432 --> 00:42:46,791
That's it.
A heliophobic demon.

397
00:42:46,979 --> 00:42:50,510
A sixth category devil
who hates light.

398
00:42:50,835 --> 00:42:54,022
He acts at night, when
the shadows protect him.

399
00:42:54,194 --> 00:42:57,897
We must destroy him
in order to free the girls.

400
00:43:01,242 --> 00:43:03,258
We must prepare...

401
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:06,008
an exorcism.

402
00:43:07,524 --> 00:43:10,696
Justine. Poor Justine.

403
00:43:11,454 --> 00:43:15,595
I won't let them harm you.
I won't let them take you away.

404
00:43:15,985 --> 00:43:18,376
I'll take you somewhere
where you can be safe.

405
00:43:18,579 --> 00:43:21,611
My poor Justine.
You've got to help me.

406
00:43:21,714 --> 00:43:24,657
- No.
- You must get up.

407
00:43:25,938 --> 00:43:28,532
Sister, what d'you think you're doing?

408
00:43:41,665 --> 00:43:43,571
Open the door.

409
00:44:08,318 --> 00:44:10,209
Come child.

410
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:03,383
Do not despair my child.

411
00:45:03,586 --> 00:45:06,508
We are here to deliver you from evil.

412
00:45:13,208 --> 00:45:16,755
It's not the child, but
the demon inside her that's resisting.

413
00:45:16,966 --> 00:45:19,779
I shall prove this by
exposing la marca diaboli.

414
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:24,591
The devil's mark she has on her skin.
The mark of the devil.

415
00:45:25,091 --> 00:45:26,863
Remove her clothing.

416
00:45:48,944 --> 00:45:52,194
God of heaven. Jesus Christ.

417
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:56,804
Die soon!
Die soon!

418
00:46:02,648 --> 00:46:06,711
This is all the evidence I need.
You have all seen her.

419
00:46:06,816 --> 00:46:11,550
They cannot stand the name
of our Saviour. They are possessed.

420
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:15,160
You'll die soon!

421
00:46:15,316 --> 00:46:16,613
Silence her.

422
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:33,642
I order thee, evil spirit

423
00:46:33,767 --> 00:46:36,454
in the name of the one who judges.

424
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,439
the one who has created
and can destroy the world,

425
00:46:39,793 --> 00:46:43,215
The one who has the power
to send you to hell.

426
00:46:43,449 --> 00:46:46,043
Go! Depart!

427
00:46:46,168 --> 00:46:50,418
Leave the bodies of
these two servants of God.

428
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:54,889
They must return to the Holy Church.

429
00:47:10,268 --> 00:47:14,455
By the power of my faith
and of the Holy Ghost

430
00:47:14,627 --> 00:47:17,863
I demand that you
return to your bottomless pit.

431
00:47:19,816 --> 00:47:25,847
Humble yourself at the feet of Christ,
because his faith is greater than yours.

432
00:47:26,988 --> 00:47:30,457
Christ before whom you tremble.

433
00:47:31,597 --> 00:47:36,831
Christ who takes lost souls from the
fires of hell, to the light of heaven.

434
00:47:38,445 --> 00:47:43,117
Now depart.
Back where you belong, evil spirit.

435
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:46,398
God commands you.
Do not resist.

436
00:47:47,349 --> 00:47:50,177
God the Father commands you

437
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:52,474
God the Son commands you

438
00:47:53,411 --> 00:47:56,521
God the Holy Ghost commands you.

439
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:00,000
The Holy Cross commands you.

440
00:48:00,296 --> 00:48:04,515
The faith of St. Peter
and St. Paul commands you.

441
00:48:04,687 --> 00:48:07,281
All the saints command you.

442
00:48:07,531 --> 00:48:10,124
The Holy Cross commands you.

443
00:48:10,484 --> 00:48:13,124
All the faithful command you.

444
00:48:13,312 --> 00:48:17,234
Depart, seducer. Enemy of virtue.

445
00:48:31,488 --> 00:48:33,144
Stop it.

446
00:48:34,597 --> 00:48:36,441
Stop it, I say.

447
00:48:40,457 --> 00:48:42,269
Stop it.

448
00:48:43,157 --> 00:48:46,985
Doctor, how dare you
interrupt our holy ritual.

449
00:48:47,704 --> 00:48:52,704
Holy ritual. This is the most
shameful thing I have ever witnessed.

450
00:48:55,875 --> 00:48:58,219
This is not the fifteenth century.

451
00:48:58,313 --> 00:49:01,500
I thought reason
had replaced superstition.

452
00:49:02,032 --> 00:49:03,829
This is not an act of faith.

453
00:49:03,953 --> 00:49:08,061
This is the most primitive expression
of ignorance I have ever seen.

454
00:49:08,202 --> 00:49:09,452
You...

455
00:49:09,688 --> 00:49:13,782
You...
You have just killed Justine.

456
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,782
How dare you.

457
00:49:20,995 --> 00:49:24,245
Damn you! Damn you!

458
00:49:25,589 --> 00:49:27,214
Release her.

459
00:49:36,657 --> 00:49:42,391
I'm taking this girl with me, before
you kill her, as you killed Justine.

460
00:49:46,827 --> 00:49:48,280
My Lord.

461
00:50:32,016 --> 00:50:34,391
Oh, my Christ.

462
00:50:36,626 --> 00:50:40,860
You were witness.
How did this happen.

463
00:50:41,486 --> 00:50:44,533
Where is the love he spoke of, Mother?

464
00:50:49,861 --> 00:50:51,986
To cleanse her spirit

465
00:50:53,753 --> 00:50:55,628
you have destroyed her body.

466
00:50:55,847 --> 00:50:59,644
But the Lord will not abandon her soul,
because it is pure.

467
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,784
May he have mercy on you
for all that you have done.

468
00:51:05,612 --> 00:51:07,394
Enough Sister.

469
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,704
- Yes? Who is it.
- Open the door please.

470
00:51:26,532 --> 00:51:30,845
- Doctor, what's happened?
- She's been hurt. We must care for her.

471
00:51:47,013 --> 00:51:50,888
- How is she doctor?
- She's alright. Bring the stethoscope.

472
00:53:44,009 --> 00:53:47,196
It's alright.

473
00:53:47,603 --> 00:53:49,040
Don't touch me.

474
00:53:50,063 --> 00:53:52,032
Nobody wants to hurt you.

475
00:53:52,376 --> 00:53:54,063
Everything's alright.

476
00:53:54,704 --> 00:53:55,673
Father...

477
00:53:57,016 --> 00:53:58,719
I'm scared.

478
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:03,620
- Is anything wrong?
- It's Alucarda.

479
00:54:04,339 --> 00:54:06,433
She had a nightmare.

480
00:54:08,276 --> 00:54:11,762
Don't be scared, darling.
She just had a nightmare.

481
00:54:11,903 --> 00:54:13,512
Who is she?

482
00:54:20,111 --> 00:54:21,783
Don't be afraid.

483
00:54:23,017 --> 00:54:24,626
Don't be afraid.

484
00:54:25,548 --> 00:54:27,298
It's only me.

485
00:54:28,879 --> 00:54:32,442
Daniela.
You just had a bad dream.

486
00:54:33,082 --> 00:54:36,692
You're safe with us.
Try to rest now.

487
00:54:38,454 --> 00:54:40,614
Can I stay with her
for a little while father?

488
00:54:40,879 --> 00:54:45,114
Yes, darling, but not too long.
I'll be downstairs if you need me.

489
00:54:48,229 --> 00:54:51,948
- Your father want to frighten me?
- He doesn't Alucarda.

490
00:54:52,026 --> 00:54:54,557
- You were dreaming.
- I'm afraid of dreams.

491
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:56,495
The things I see are so real.

492
00:54:56,947 --> 00:54:59,572
My father is a good doctor.
He'll cure you.

493
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:04,040
- Have we ever met before?
- I don't think so.

494
00:55:05,431 --> 00:55:06,871
Because...

495
00:55:08,105 --> 00:55:10,621
I do remember people's voices.

496
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:15,136
- You are very pretty.
- And you are beautiful.

497
00:55:15,293 --> 00:55:17,996
Please don't go.
Stay with me.

498
00:55:41,326 --> 00:55:43,342
Rubbish, pure rubbish.

499
00:55:51,865 --> 00:55:54,240
- Who is it.
- It's me doctor, Felipe.

500
00:55:54,381 --> 00:55:56,765
Something terrible has happened
at the convent.

501
00:55:56,968 --> 00:55:59,999
- You've got to come.
- But it's five in the morning.

502
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:03,858
The Reverend Mother sent me.
You are to come right away.

503
00:56:04,015 --> 00:56:07,999
I'm familiar with the terrible things
at the convent. What is it now?

504
00:56:08,312 --> 00:56:11,296
She didn't say.
Only that you had to come.

505
00:56:11,421 --> 00:56:13,343
I'll be right down.

506
00:56:15,992 --> 00:56:18,445
Thank God you've come, Dr. Hasley.

507
00:56:40,466 --> 00:56:42,236
Justine's shroud.

508
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:50,025
- Who did this?
- That's what we would like to know.

509
00:56:50,275 --> 00:56:52,744
She was brought here
to be prepared for burial.

510
00:56:52,869 --> 00:56:55,713
She was here all night,
until a few hours ago.

511
00:56:56,597 --> 00:56:59,129
- Who was with her?
- Sister Veronica.

512
00:56:59,269 --> 00:57:01,363
- Where is she now?
- We don't know doctor.

513
00:57:02,175 --> 00:57:04,957
The least you should have done
was to say with her yourself.

514
00:57:06,925 --> 00:57:10,301
Doctor.
Doctor, please.

515
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,019
No one in the convent
has been sleeping since Justine died.

516
00:57:15,207 --> 00:57:18,129
We have been flagellating ourselves
as we flagellated Justine.

517
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:23,972
- Then someone took Justine's body.
- There's no other explanation.

518
00:57:24,144 --> 00:57:28,801
- I must notify the authorities.
- No. They'll want to know how she died.

519
00:57:29,207 --> 00:57:33,144
- Our religious community. The scandal.
- Don't worry.

520
00:57:33,394 --> 00:57:36,863
The death certificate will say Justine
died of an unforeseen accident,

521
00:57:37,097 --> 00:57:38,613
which is partly true.

522
00:57:40,066 --> 00:57:45,113
Doctor, Mother Superior, Doctor.
Come quickly.

523
00:57:54,104 --> 00:57:56,526
Oh, my God.

524
00:58:09,167 --> 00:58:10,761
She's been burned to death.

525
00:58:10,917 --> 00:58:14,495
It looks as if
the fires of hell have reached her.

526
00:58:14,651 --> 00:58:16,433
Take her to the chapel.

527
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:09,267
I want to look at the corpse again.

528
00:59:09,642 --> 00:59:11,548
- I'll go with you.
- No.

529
00:59:11,704 --> 00:59:15,204
I want to examine it alone,
if you don't mind.

530
00:59:20,192 --> 00:59:22,254
Take her to her cell.

531
01:00:09,717 --> 01:00:12,061
Father, what is the meaning of this?

532
01:00:13,883 --> 01:00:15,836
This nun was dead, and yet...

533
01:00:16,523 --> 01:00:18,101
She moved.

534
01:00:18,289 --> 01:00:20,351
The devil moved her limbs.

535
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:23,336
She was dead.

536
01:00:23,572 --> 01:00:27,635
But the forces of evil
had not abandoned her.

537
01:00:28,811 --> 01:00:32,259
How can you explain this
from a scientific point of view?

538
01:00:32,464 --> 01:00:36,248
It happened, is happening
in front of your very eyes.

539
01:00:36,436 --> 01:00:37,998
Do you still doubt?

540
01:00:38,508 --> 01:00:40,149
I don't know.

541
01:00:41,618 --> 01:00:43,633
You're the only one here
who has the answer.

542
01:00:45,946 --> 01:00:48,524
These are the doings
of the transgressor,

543
01:00:48,968 --> 01:00:52,233
The seducer, the enemy of virtue.

544
01:00:52,374 --> 01:00:55,343
The perpetual persecutor of innocence.

545
01:00:55,843 --> 01:00:58,374
The arch enemy of Almighty God.

546
01:01:02,949 --> 01:01:06,371
You mean... the devil?

547
01:01:07,621 --> 01:01:09,449
The devil.

548
01:01:12,244 --> 01:01:14,369
I still can't believe it.

549
01:01:14,541 --> 01:01:19,104
And yet this destruction was by someone
who hates all religious manifestation.

550
01:01:19,429 --> 01:01:22,820
To that being, this chapel

551
01:01:23,148 --> 01:01:25,054
was a terrible antagonist.

552
01:01:25,226 --> 01:01:28,867
When I studied at the University
of Paris, I was taught

553
01:01:29,049 --> 01:01:32,314
that demonic possession
was pure nonsense.

554
01:01:32,486 --> 01:01:36,283
Or the sad result of
the workings of an insane mind.

555
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:41,226
They taught me that religion
was a farce and a form of slavery.

556
01:01:41,336 --> 01:01:44,429
That the time has come to
break the chains of superstition.

557
01:01:44,733 --> 01:01:47,998
I'm a man of reason.

558
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:52,108
And I'm faced with
something supernatural,

559
01:01:53,077 --> 01:01:54,811
which frightens me.

560
01:01:55,764 --> 01:01:57,811
This woman was dead.

561
01:01:58,186 --> 01:02:02,514
Yet there was evil inside her ready
to come alive and attack the innocent.

562
01:02:04,498 --> 01:02:07,030
This could only be as you say,

563
01:02:07,233 --> 01:02:10,327
the work of what you call the devil.

564
01:02:11,077 --> 01:02:15,983
Yes. It was the devil,
who entered our sister's body.

565
01:02:16,328 --> 01:02:20,641
And turned her from the altar of the
Almighty to the fires of hell.

566
01:02:21,391 --> 01:02:25,095
- Someone must have contaminated her.
- Justine.

567
01:02:30,469 --> 01:02:32,360
And we must find her...

568
01:02:32,563 --> 01:02:38,235
before there are more victims,
more corpses, more possessed.

569
01:02:39,031 --> 01:02:42,125
Yes, we must find Justine,
or what is left of her.

570
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:45,032
You won't believe how things were.

571
01:02:45,188 --> 01:02:47,657
But that's why we exorcised
Justine and Alucarda.

572
01:02:47,891 --> 01:02:50,719
They were possessed by the devil.

573
01:02:50,985 --> 01:02:53,625
Is that why Alucarda
was at the ceremony?

574
01:02:53,844 --> 01:02:57,297
Her behaviour was evil, diabolical.

575
01:02:57,457 --> 01:03:00,501
- Oh, my God, no... Daniela.
- Doctor

576
01:03:00,788 --> 01:03:03,644
Daniela’s alone with her.

577
01:03:04,597 --> 01:03:06,238
Daniela.

578
01:03:31,934 --> 01:03:33,825
Thank you father.

579
01:03:39,934 --> 01:03:43,605
- Mother Superior. Daniela's gone.
- I understand.

580
01:03:43,845 --> 01:03:48,438
We must find them immediately
or Daniela also will be possessed.

581
01:03:48,610 --> 01:03:50,876
- We'll all search for them.
- Thank you Mother.

582
01:03:51,095 --> 01:03:53,564
- Are you ready Doctor?
- Yes Father.

583
01:03:56,282 --> 01:04:00,314
We must find Alucarda.
Where should we start looking?

584
01:04:00,501 --> 01:04:03,642
- I think I could help find her.
- How would you know, sister Angelica.

585
01:04:03,767 --> 01:04:06,462
I remember some of the places
they used to go together.

586
01:04:06,606 --> 01:04:09,928
- Let's go then.
- Promise me you won't hurt her.

587
01:04:10,053 --> 01:04:13,506
- Please Doctor.
- Don't worry.

588
01:04:20,305 --> 01:04:22,024
This way doctor.

589
01:04:26,699 --> 01:04:30,761
Mother Superior,
please bring Father Lazarus.

590
01:04:30,964 --> 01:04:34,214
- Yes doctor.
- Sister Theresa, where's your cross?

591
01:04:35,308 --> 01:04:37,371
I've lost it.

592
01:04:41,105 --> 01:04:43,292
Thank you sister.

593
01:04:48,271 --> 01:04:49,756
Doctor.

594
01:05:00,514 --> 01:05:02,123
They used to come here.

595
01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:26,228
There seems to be another way out.
Come on Brother Felipe.

596
01:06:45,847 --> 01:06:49,316
Please, no!

597
01:07:22,922 --> 01:07:24,391
Justine.

598
01:07:31,891 --> 01:07:34,787
Oh, God. Justine.

599
01:08:00,067 --> 01:08:02,161
You're just killing her.

600
01:09:00,933 --> 01:09:03,605
Doctor...
Alucarda...

601
01:09:04,984 --> 01:09:06,875
The convent.

602
01:09:50,851 --> 01:09:53,508
Alucarda at the convent.

603
01:09:54,508 --> 01:09:57,461
Of course. That would be
the last place we would look for her.

604
01:09:57,792 --> 01:09:59,501
She must be there.

605
01:10:18,629 --> 01:10:20,192
Burn them.

606
01:10:22,848 --> 01:10:24,333
Burn them.

607
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:30,376
Lucifer.

608
01:10:32,657 --> 01:10:34,204
Burn them.

609
01:10:56,022 --> 01:10:58,132
Doctor, what's happening?

610
01:11:01,819 --> 01:11:03,707
Alucarda!

611
01:11:07,043 --> 01:11:08,700
Take her out.

612
01:11:17,096 --> 01:11:18,643
Satan.

613
01:11:49,074 --> 01:11:51,762
Let it down.

614
01:11:56,855 --> 01:11:58,339
Lucifer.

615
01:12:02,464 --> 01:12:04,120
Alucarda, please.

616
01:13:22,316 --> 01:13:23,878
Daniela.

617
01:14:56,718 --> 01:14:58,858
God the Father commands thee.

618
01:15:46,206 --> 01:15:48,582
God the Holy Ghost commands thee.
