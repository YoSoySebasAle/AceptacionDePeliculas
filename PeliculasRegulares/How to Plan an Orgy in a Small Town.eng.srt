1
00:00:33,927 --> 00:00:36,007
I'll be right back.

2
00:00:43,846 --> 00:00:47,247
Adam Mitchell...

3
00:00:48,327 --> 00:00:52,566
I think of you fondly.

4
00:00:53,526 --> 00:00:55,806
No, that's stupid

5
00:00:59,446 --> 00:01:01,366
I love you.

6
00:01:02,846 --> 00:01:04,845
I've always loved you.

7
00:01:10,245 --> 00:01:12,925
"You look beautiful, Cassie."

8
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:15,389
I don't know what's happening.

9
00:01:15,485 --> 00:01:19,965
This is the only thing that you
should be wearing right now.

10
00:01:22,924 --> 00:01:24,724
Chester, have you seen Cassie?

11
00:01:27,925 --> 00:01:29,909
Are you moist?

12
00:01:30,005 --> 00:01:33,749
- It's supposed to help.
- I don't...

13
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:36,148
I think so.

14
00:01:36,244 --> 00:01:39,324
Good enough.
Okay, just... let's get...

15
00:01:40,004 --> 00:01:41,708
I can't get it in.

16
00:01:41,804 --> 00:01:45,508
It's kind of... squishy.

17
00:01:45,604 --> 00:01:47,787
Are you sure you're ready?

18
00:01:47,883 --> 00:01:49,587
Yeah.

19
00:01:49,683 --> 00:01:51,443
I was born ready.

20
00:01:52,003 --> 00:01:55,747
Hey. Hey, Adam. Adam, it's okay.

21
00:01:55,843 --> 00:01:58,188
It's a lot of pressure.

22
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:03,307
Hey. Hey, Adam. Adam, it's okay.

23
00:02:03,403 --> 00:02:05,883
It's just us.

24
00:02:06,883 --> 00:02:08,762
I...

25
00:02:11,443 --> 00:02:14,187
- I...
- I need to pee.

26
00:02:14,282 --> 00:02:15,522
Maybe.

27
00:02:20,923 --> 00:02:24,322
We could always try again later.

28
00:02:25,522 --> 00:02:27,186
Adam?

29
00:02:27,282 --> 00:02:30,042
Are you freaking kidding me?

30
00:02:31,282 --> 00:02:34,361
Get out of my parent's bed,
you tramp!

31
00:02:36,682 --> 00:02:40,681
Adam?
Adam, my clothes are in there.

32
00:02:41,281 --> 00:02:44,585
- Adam. Adam, please.
- Get out of my house before I call the police.

33
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:49,561
- For what?
- For stuff. I don't know. Whore.

34
00:02:51,161 --> 00:02:53,224
What a whore!

35
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,881
Where are you going, slut?

36
00:02:57,121 --> 00:02:58,464
What are you doing?

37
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,400
Come on, the party just started.
Stay awhile.

38
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,600
Oh, my God. What a little tramp.

39
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,280
Bye!

40
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,903
Hey.

41
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:22,943
Cassie Cranston, is that you?

42
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,439
- Shit!
- Did you just say "shit"?

43
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:34,623
Jesus, Seth.

44
00:03:34,718 --> 00:03:36,999
- That's my mom's.
- I'll bring it back.

45
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,918
Okay.

46
00:03:43,758 --> 00:03:49,263
Lana Parker called me about you, said
you streaked through her backyard.

47
00:03:49,358 --> 00:03:53,142
And she wasn't the only one. All of
Beaver's Ridge is abuzz about you.

48
00:03:53,238 --> 00:03:58,142
- It was so horrible, Mom. They all...
- Don't say another word.

49
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:02,422
You embarrassed me tonight.
You embarrassed yourself.

50
00:04:02,518 --> 00:04:06,677
- Please, Mom, I'm...
- Don't you care what others think of you?

51
00:04:08,558 --> 00:04:10,741
Don't you?

52
00:04:10,837 --> 00:04:14,221
Oh, stop sulking. Go in the
house before anyone sees you.

53
00:04:14,317 --> 00:04:17,916
Unless you can think of another
way you can mortify me tonight.

54
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:45,075
Fuck, yeah.

55
00:05:05,315 --> 00:05:09,818
Hey, Ellie. Sorry I missed all your
calls. I have your pages, I just...

56
00:05:09,914 --> 00:05:13,179
Cassie, it's your mom.

57
00:05:13,275 --> 00:05:16,498
- Oh, Christ, what now?
- <i>She passed.</i>

58
00:05:16,594 --> 00:05:19,138
Good. I didn't want her writing the
forward, anyway. That was your idea.

59
00:05:19,234 --> 00:05:22,594
No. She's gone.

60
00:05:23,313 --> 00:05:25,513
On tour?

61
00:05:26,073 --> 00:05:27,246
No.

62
00:05:28,513 --> 00:05:32,577
<i>I'm sorry, Cassie. I know the two of
you weren't very close, but, look...</i>

63
00:05:32,673 --> 00:05:38,217
<i>I still need that manuscript
from you as soon as possible.</i>

64
00:05:38,313 --> 00:05:40,233
<i>But...</i>

65
00:05:40,593 --> 00:05:43,553
you know, take a few days.

66
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:45,833
<i>Go home.</i>

67
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:04,413
Afternoon, Adam. How are you doing?
You're looking very good. Looking fit.

68
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:06,533
I just want to talk to you about
the apple butter festival this year.

69
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:09,133
'Cause last year the judging got some
complaints. Are you in this year?

70
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:11,053
- Absolutely.
- 'Cause you'd make a great judge.

71
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:14,189
- You love apple butter, don't you?
- I love apple butter.

72
00:07:16,188 --> 00:07:19,013
Oh, you've gotta be
fucking kidding me.

73
00:07:19,109 --> 00:07:21,373
If you're here for the tour,
Justin's taking one out now.

74
00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:24,572
Yeah. Mr. Thicodedious, have
you got your insulin this time?

75
00:07:24,668 --> 00:07:28,652
All right, now, for our first stop,
everybody, it's gonna be the church

76
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:33,948
that inspired the exciting conclusion
to the fifth Victoria novel...

77
00:07:34,508 --> 00:07:40,668
I'm not here for the tour. I just wanted
to check the place out. It's cool.

78
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:44,571
Holy fuck.
You're Cassie Cranston.

79
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:48,451
I'm... I'm literally reading
your column right now.

80
00:07:48,547 --> 00:07:52,451
- It's like my Bible.
- Thank you.

81
00:07:52,547 --> 00:07:55,690
That's a good one.
How's that working out for you?

82
00:07:55,786 --> 00:07:59,690
Oh, it's... yeah. No, it's
like... not really. It's fine.

83
00:07:59,786 --> 00:08:03,171
I'm sorry, I just... I never thought
that I would get to meet you.

84
00:08:03,267 --> 00:08:06,810
I saw you the night
that you went through town

85
00:08:06,906 --> 00:08:10,186
with your tits and
stuff and it just...

86
00:08:10,426 --> 00:08:13,690
it blew my mind, and every time,
I just get fed up with this place,

87
00:08:13,786 --> 00:08:16,850
I read your first article that you ever
wrote. The one that made people hate you.

88
00:08:16,946 --> 00:08:19,170
And, like,
it's so comforting to me.

89
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:22,569
"Dear Beaver's Ridge, the following article
has been formatted to fit your narrow

90
00:08:22,665 --> 00:08:26,210
and oppressed view of the universe." It
is a great opening line. It's so epic.

91
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:29,370
- Thank you.
- What are you doing here?

92
00:08:29,465 --> 00:08:32,545
Well, my mom died, so...

93
00:08:32,865 --> 00:08:35,065
Fuck and shit.

94
00:08:35,505 --> 00:08:39,329
Hey, you wouldn't happen to know
who the wills and estates lawyer is?

95
00:08:39,425 --> 00:08:42,665
I do. Yes.

96
00:08:44,585 --> 00:08:46,448
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

97
00:08:46,544 --> 00:08:48,945
Oh, God.

98
00:08:49,984 --> 00:08:51,808
Nice to meet you.
Thank you so much.

99
00:08:51,904 --> 00:08:53,744
Bye.

100
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,583
Fuck.

101
00:09:10,943 --> 00:09:13,647
- Why can't we show it today?
- The town's national treasure died.

102
00:09:13,743 --> 00:09:17,823
People are super sad and stuff. No one
wants to buy a house when they're sad.

103
00:09:19,743 --> 00:09:21,887
It's listed too high.

104
00:09:21,983 --> 00:09:24,806
In the city, we'd list it 25%
lower. It starts a bidding war.

105
00:09:24,902 --> 00:09:28,806
No. See? There's no bidding wars here.
What you do is, you go 25% higher,

106
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:32,622
and then people think they're getting
a bargain when they Jew us down.

107
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:38,222
I'm Jewish.

108
00:09:40,182 --> 00:09:42,406
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize.

109
00:09:42,502 --> 00:09:44,806
Just don't say that
in front of clients,

110
00:09:44,902 --> 00:09:48,302
unless small-town bigotry is something
that binds the town together.

111
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:52,726
Kind of. Although we do have
a major that's a Paki.

112
00:09:52,821 --> 00:09:56,285
So... or Paki... He's a Paki...
Pakistan. Pakistan... Pakistani.

113
00:09:56,381 --> 00:09:58,645
Is that what you
call those people?

114
00:09:58,741 --> 00:10:01,685
Look, the main selling point of
all the homes in Beaver's Ridge,

115
00:10:01,781 --> 00:10:04,925
is that you're coming
to a community, you know?

116
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:08,445
It's wholesome,
those family values.

117
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:13,804
You know, the kind of place you could see
yourself setting up your own little family.

118
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,940
Are you fucking shitting me?

119
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,860
Oh, hey, Bruce.

120
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,844
Hey, buddy.

121
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,004
I told you I was bringing
my new partner by today!

122
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,004
Was that today? What time...
I'm sorry that slipped my mind.

123
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,820
So you're the home owners?

124
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,363
- This is my wife.
- Nah, ex-wife.

125
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:35,043
Temporary separation, Alice.

126
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:37,083
Until you get off your ass
and sign the papers.

127
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:41,683
- This is my house!
- My goodness. It's not. It's my house!

128
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:44,459
Why don't you get
your shit out of it?

129
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:55,963
I will rip the batteries out of that game
thing so fast, your head is gonna spin.

130
00:10:56,059 --> 00:10:58,003
Stop treating me like a child,
Mom.

131
00:10:58,099 --> 00:11:00,722
- Take this casserole over to Maureen's.
- No one's even there.

132
00:11:00,818 --> 00:11:05,362
If that little tramp daughter of
hers turns up, she'll need food.

133
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,162
Did you make me one of these?

134
00:11:07,258 --> 00:11:10,801
This is the house where Maureen
wrote every single one of the books.

135
00:11:10,897 --> 00:11:15,641
Okay, now it's also the inspiration
for Victoria's childhood home.

136
00:11:15,737 --> 00:11:18,442
And this tree right here, folks,
this is the tree

137
00:11:18,538 --> 00:11:20,721
where Victoria had
her first kiss.

138
00:11:20,817 --> 00:11:25,737
Also, the tree where Mr. Cobell
proposed marriage.

139
00:11:28,337 --> 00:11:32,081
- Sorry about your mom.
- Go ahead and take some photos if you want.

140
00:11:32,177 --> 00:11:34,656
Thanks, Seth.

141
00:11:38,017 --> 00:11:40,401
Do you play
Father-Daughter Warfare?

142
00:11:40,497 --> 00:11:43,217
I have no idea what that is.

143
00:12:38,933 --> 00:12:43,637
Ovulation begins in t-minus five days.
I've given your secretary the itinerary,

144
00:12:43,733 --> 00:12:46,078
and she's freed your schedule
for the corresponding times.

145
00:12:46,174 --> 00:12:48,838
Those are non-negotiable.
3:00 p.m. means 3:00 p.m.

146
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:52,037
- Not quarter after.
- I'm sorry I was late today.

147
00:12:52,133 --> 00:12:55,197
When you walk in that door, I want you
to be fully aroused. Okay, sweetheart?

148
00:12:55,293 --> 00:12:57,813
Fully aroused, yeah.

149
00:12:58,132 --> 00:13:00,957
- This is fun?
- Sweetie, this isn't for enjoyment.

150
00:13:01,053 --> 00:13:03,317
The doctor said that we need
to keep a steady flow

151
00:13:03,413 --> 00:13:05,876
of semen going to maximize our
chances for when the time comes.

152
00:13:05,972 --> 00:13:09,316
We don't want to be the only 30-year-olds
in town without a child, do we?

153
00:13:09,412 --> 00:13:12,093
- We just need to keep the semen schedule.
- All right.

154
00:13:15,612 --> 00:13:18,556
- Adam, we need to finish.
- That's my work ring though.

155
00:13:18,652 --> 00:13:20,876
Oh! God, Connie! Oh, my God.

156
00:13:20,972 --> 00:13:24,012
Can I just answer it real quick,
and I'll get back to you?

157
00:13:25,612 --> 00:13:27,491
Okay.

158
00:13:31,091 --> 00:13:33,875
- Adam Mitchell.
- Hi.

159
00:13:33,971 --> 00:13:37,475
It's Cassie Cranston.

160
00:13:37,571 --> 00:13:40,851
- Hi.
- So you're a lawyer.

161
00:13:41,611 --> 00:13:45,091
Honey, it's super dry.

162
00:13:50,771 --> 00:13:54,594
Wills and estates, mostly, yeah.
When did you get back into town?

163
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,770
Just now.

164
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:00,394
- The library's gone?
- Yeah, yeah.

165
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,394
It burned to the ground
about eight years ago.

166
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,314
It was a huge fire.
It was a terrible tragedy.

167
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:08,690
Those poor schoolchildren with
nothing to do with their free time.

168
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:14,114
Right. So...
I need to plan the funeral.

169
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:17,889
Oh, I did that already.
I did it all by myself...

170
00:14:28,928 --> 00:14:32,232
- Sorry, where were we?
- Everything okay over there?

171
00:14:32,328 --> 00:14:36,873
Yeah.
I'm... I'm glad you're in town.

172
00:14:36,969 --> 00:14:38,489
Why?

173
00:14:39,048 --> 00:14:42,192
Well, you know, you're next of kin,
you got to sign the documents...

174
00:14:42,288 --> 00:14:44,432
relevant documents, there's
all sorts of stuff, and...

175
00:14:44,527 --> 00:14:48,008
I mean, I just always kind of assumed
you would never be coming home.

176
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:52,472
My mom died. I mean, why wouldn't
I come home? 'Cause of the article?

177
00:14:52,568 --> 00:14:54,912
Right, yeah, of course.

178
00:14:55,007 --> 00:14:57,847
So, when do we read the will?

179
00:14:58,088 --> 00:15:01,127
- After the funeral.
- Right.

180
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:05,231
I've bothered you
after business hours, so...

181
00:15:05,327 --> 00:15:09,311
I'll let you get back to your
wife. I assume you're married.

182
00:15:09,407 --> 00:15:11,870
Oh, yeah, actually.

183
00:15:11,966 --> 00:15:14,391
Okay, well...
thanks for everything.

184
00:15:14,487 --> 00:15:16,967
<i>You actually know my wi...</i>

185
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:22,767
Sweetie, we talk about you warning
me before you release your demons.

186
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:26,830
That face you make
it's like staring into the sun.

187
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,526
A lot of that is involuntary.

188
00:15:41,085 --> 00:15:43,445
You didn't call.

189
00:15:44,446 --> 00:15:46,885
What was I supposed to say?

190
00:15:49,525 --> 00:15:53,789
You will now have a passage from
Maureen's first Victoria book

191
00:15:53,885 --> 00:15:59,365
read by Heather Mitchell, president of the
Victoria of the True North Festival committee.

192
00:16:02,405 --> 00:16:05,309
"Victoria had always been aware,

193
00:16:05,405 --> 00:16:07,628
ever since her first memories,

194
00:16:07,724 --> 00:16:11,604
that she was very near
to a world of deviant morality.

195
00:16:13,444 --> 00:16:17,788
But sometimes,
just for a moment,

196
00:16:17,884 --> 00:16:20,908
her loved ones neared it,
and she caught a glimpse,

197
00:16:21,004 --> 00:16:23,587
of the bewitching world beyond,

198
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:27,364
and she knew that it would be
her life's work...

199
00:16:27,803 --> 00:16:30,843
to keep herself and
others from it."

200
00:16:33,003 --> 00:16:35,563
I hate everything.

201
00:16:38,283 --> 00:16:41,027
Remember when you left me here
alone with all of these people?

202
00:16:41,122 --> 00:16:43,626
The sooner I get out of here,
the better.

203
00:16:43,722 --> 00:16:47,026
- She just had to show up today.
- Oh, my God.

204
00:16:47,122 --> 00:16:49,443
- It's her mother's funeral.
- Oh, button it.

205
00:16:49,722 --> 00:16:52,106
- I'm gonna go give her a piece of my mind.
- Honey, don't.

206
00:16:52,202 --> 00:16:55,682
Is this really the best place
for a confrontation like this?

207
00:16:56,242 --> 00:16:58,546
Cassie Cranston.

208
00:16:58,641 --> 00:17:02,785
Heather Murray.
Or is it Mitchell now?

209
00:17:02,881 --> 00:17:05,346
On behalf of Beaver's Ridge
welcoming committee,

210
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:09,066
I would like to formally let you
know that you are not welcome.

211
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:11,841
That is,
you are not welcome here.

212
00:17:12,641 --> 00:17:15,265
As far as condolences go,
that was original.

213
00:17:15,361 --> 00:17:18,921
- Did I do something?
- You did something to this entire town.

214
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,665
Right, the article. Is that it?

215
00:17:21,761 --> 00:17:24,905
You may have grown up here,
but you know nothing about us.

216
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,905
I mean, we get up to some
pretty wild shenanigans.

217
00:17:30,001 --> 00:17:33,065
Like what?
The True North Festival?

218
00:17:33,161 --> 00:17:36,384
- The apple butter parade?
- Hey, I don't mean to butt in here,

219
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,704
but I will not stand idly by, while
you trash talk the apple butter parade.

220
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,879
- Bruce, can we give Cassie a break?
- Whose side are you on, really, Adam?

221
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,663
Wipe that smile off your face.

222
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:50,464
You think you're the only one
who's had a little excitement?

223
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,863
Well, let me tell you, I have
had my share of excitement.

224
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:56,784
Okay. Do tell.

225
00:17:56,879 --> 00:17:59,519
I slept with a black
man in college.

226
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:02,959
My stars.
Ever been with a woman?

227
00:18:04,479 --> 00:18:07,543
- I kissed a girl once, I didn't care for it.
- Sex tape?

228
00:18:07,638 --> 00:18:12,143
We make them, and watch them
often. Big whoop. Anything else?

229
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:15,119
Have you ever been in an orgy?

230
00:18:16,718 --> 00:18:18,958
I'm sorry.

231
00:18:24,398 --> 00:18:27,261
Hey, you know, hon,
it's been kind of a rough day,

232
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:31,821
we've got a little time before
dinner, maybe we could, you know...

233
00:18:31,917 --> 00:18:34,622
- I'm not ovulating.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

234
00:18:34,718 --> 00:18:38,141
I just thought maybe
we could have a little fun.

235
00:18:38,237 --> 00:18:40,141
Sweetie.

236
00:18:40,237 --> 00:18:45,077
No. Fun time was yesterday just...
just like the schedule says, remember?

237
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:49,156
You just have to keep your sperm
fresh. You don't need me for that.

238
00:18:50,237 --> 00:18:54,836
Besides, it really turns me on to
think of you doing that to yourself.

239
00:18:55,837 --> 00:18:57,637
Yeah?

240
00:18:58,636 --> 00:19:01,820
Yeah, I could do that.
Hey, you wanna watch?

241
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:04,756
No, that's okay, that's okay.
Yeah.

242
00:19:17,315 --> 00:19:20,035
You look beautiful, Cassie.

243
00:19:20,516 --> 00:19:22,555
It's okay.

244
00:19:22,755 --> 00:19:25,195
It's just us.

245
00:19:25,795 --> 00:19:27,995
It's always been just us.

246
00:19:28,195 --> 00:19:32,074
- But I ran away.
- You're not going anywhere now.

247
00:19:34,395 --> 00:19:37,115
Are you freaking kidding me?

248
00:20:08,793 --> 00:20:12,297
<i>Well, the results say that Adam
suffers from "necrzoospermia,"</i>

249
00:20:12,393 --> 00:20:16,792
<i>which means that all of his sperm
are non-viable. Which means dead.</i>

250
00:20:17,072 --> 00:20:20,497
- All of them?
- <i>There's really nothing we can do.</i>

251
00:20:20,593 --> 00:20:23,856
I'm sorry, doctor, I just don't know what
I'm supposed to do in this situation.

252
00:20:23,952 --> 00:20:27,016
<i>After all this time, I know
how frustrated you must be.</i>

253
00:20:27,112 --> 00:20:31,776
<i>The waiting list for sperm banks and adoption
agencies are at least two to three years.</i>

254
00:20:31,872 --> 00:20:36,376
<i>If you want my honest, completely
off-the-record opinion, if it were me,</i>

255
00:20:36,472 --> 00:20:41,512
<i>I would try to get a friend, or someone
I knew to give me a personal donation.</i>

256
00:20:45,191 --> 00:20:47,631
First you folks tell me
what you paid for it.

257
00:20:48,111 --> 00:20:51,991
Then we'll have a good laugh about it
and we'll start "jewing" them down.

258
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:54,935
- The hell with it.
- Line one for you, Bruce!

259
00:20:55,031 --> 00:20:57,351
Yes, thank you, Georgina.

260
00:21:00,511 --> 00:21:02,295
The Buck Stops here,
how can I help you?

261
00:21:02,391 --> 00:21:05,374
- <i>Bruce? It's Heather Mitchell.</i>
- You're the only Heather in town.

262
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:08,574
You don't need to tell me your full
name every single time you call.

263
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,550
You know.

264
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:14,830
Not a lot of funerals end
with an orgy throw-down.

265
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:19,254
- I'd go to an orgy.
- No, you wouldn't.

266
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,214
I can grow a mustache for it,

267
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:24,334
- or a soul patch.
- Whatever.

268
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,613
I'll have you know,
I'm an extremely sexual person.

269
00:21:26,709 --> 00:21:30,574
- Oh, my God.
- I had a sex dream about you once.

270
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:33,174
I don't want to know that.

271
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:36,773
Do you have any idea how many
people I've had sex dreams about?

272
00:21:36,869 --> 00:21:39,629
It's hardly an exclusive club,
okay?

273
00:21:42,989 --> 00:21:46,029
So... how was I?

274
00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:49,812
Oh, screw you! Whatever.

275
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:52,732
If I sucked, it's probably because
you have a shitty imagination.

276
00:21:52,828 --> 00:21:55,572
You know what? I knew you'd be weird
about this. I knew you would be.

277
00:21:55,668 --> 00:21:58,652
You're my boss, dude,
and you babysat me once.

278
00:21:58,748 --> 00:22:01,492
I think. It is actually illegal for
you to be into me, or something.

279
00:22:01,588 --> 00:22:05,252
First of all, I did not say I was into
you, and secondly, I didn't babysit you.

280
00:22:05,348 --> 00:22:08,731
We played videogames while our moms
smoked cigarettes and played bridge.

281
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,731
- So, it doesn't...
- That's what guys do, though, isn't it?

282
00:22:11,827 --> 00:22:15,731
They befriend a girl just to gain her
trust, so that they can have sex with them.

283
00:22:15,827 --> 00:22:19,731
- I mean, why else are you friends with me?
- Must be your shining personality.

284
00:22:19,827 --> 00:22:22,667
Your sarcastic tone
is unnecessary.

285
00:22:24,827 --> 00:22:27,907
Hey, Heather. What's going on?

286
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:34,571
In the matter of the last will and
testament, of Maureen Margaret Cranston...

287
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:39,411
she has declared that her residuals
from any book sales, which as you know

288
00:22:39,507 --> 00:22:43,050
are still quite considerable, as
well as any assets that she has,

289
00:22:43,146 --> 00:22:47,929
financial institutions, holdings,
etcetera, be used to build...

290
00:22:48,025 --> 00:22:50,586
a new town library.

291
00:22:54,266 --> 00:22:56,090
I'm sorry. What?

292
00:22:56,185 --> 00:22:59,169
She wants to build a library. Remember
I told you the library burned down?

293
00:22:59,265 --> 00:23:01,729
I could show you the blueprints,
if you give me a second here,

294
00:23:01,825 --> 00:23:04,449
because they are
something to behold.

295
00:23:04,545 --> 00:23:07,385
- They spared no expense.
- Is this a joke?

296
00:23:08,265 --> 00:23:10,249
No, we're still on dial-up.
Yeah.

297
00:23:10,345 --> 00:23:12,488
Town council actually voted
down high-speed Internet,

298
00:23:12,584 --> 00:23:15,129
something about
ready access to pornography.

299
00:23:15,224 --> 00:23:18,169
No, no. I mean, about the money.

300
00:23:18,264 --> 00:23:21,008
- There's... there's nothing?
- No, that's not true.

301
00:23:21,104 --> 00:23:25,209
You can live in the house for
as long as you should want to.

302
00:23:25,304 --> 00:23:29,048
- Well, what would that be worth?
- It's not... I mean...

303
00:23:29,144 --> 00:23:32,207
A lot, but... again, if you
should choose to sell the house,

304
00:23:32,303 --> 00:23:37,823
- go right back into the library.
- So... she left me nothing, then?

305
00:23:40,983 --> 00:23:45,847
Well, Heather actually made you
this casserole, so.

306
00:23:45,943 --> 00:23:50,807
There's three kinds of cheese, and
there's broccolini in there, I think.

307
00:23:50,903 --> 00:23:54,207
Would you mind giving
me a minute, please?

308
00:23:54,303 --> 00:23:57,183
- Alone.
- Yeah. Yeah.

309
00:24:01,702 --> 00:24:04,503
Oh, my God. Of course.

310
00:24:07,142 --> 00:24:08,206
Hello?

311
00:24:08,302 --> 00:24:10,886
Hey. I was just calling to
check in, see how you're doing.

312
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:14,022
Well, you know,
I'm pretty terrible, actually.

313
00:24:16,222 --> 00:24:19,405
- Okay.
- I don't have your book.

314
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:21,622
- Next week is fine.
- No, I mean,

315
00:24:21,782 --> 00:24:24,686
I don't have your book,
I haven't written anything.

316
00:24:24,782 --> 00:24:28,686
<i>I came back here hoping I could use my
inheritance to pay back the advance,</i>

317
00:24:28,782 --> 00:24:31,861
but my mother didn't
leave me anything.

318
00:24:32,701 --> 00:24:34,700
Nothing.

319
00:24:35,461 --> 00:24:37,885
- We had plans.
- I know.

320
00:24:37,981 --> 00:24:40,244
<i>All this time,
why didn't you say something?</i>

321
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,540
I don't know.

322
00:24:43,461 --> 00:24:45,405
- I fucked up.
- <i>Look.</i>

323
00:24:45,501 --> 00:24:49,324
I'm gonna make this easy for you because
you're going through a lot right now.

324
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:52,124
<i>It doesn't have to be the book
that you originally pitched me,</i>

325
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,205
<i>but it has to be something.</i>

326
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,804
<i>It has to be sexy
and honest and raw.</i>

327
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,100
<i>Dig deep.</i>

328
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,444
You have 24 hours to send me
a pitch or return the money.

329
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:06,364
And if neither of those happen?

330
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:11,003
- You know any good lawyers?
- Nope, just a shitty small-town one.

331
00:25:11,099 --> 00:25:14,139
And here we are.

332
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:20,083
Hey, you weren't counting
on these royalties, were you?

333
00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:22,403
No, of course not.

334
00:25:22,499 --> 00:25:26,219
Yeah. Right.
Big city writer, right?

335
00:25:27,498 --> 00:25:30,322
It's nice to see you... I mean,

336
00:25:30,418 --> 00:25:33,283
with lots of terrible
circumstances, but...

337
00:25:33,379 --> 00:25:35,562
you never realize
how much you miss somebody,

338
00:25:35,658 --> 00:25:38,922
- until...
- Until what?

339
00:25:39,018 --> 00:25:41,842
I don't know where I was
going with that. I just...

340
00:25:41,938 --> 00:25:47,561
You know, I just didn't like how...
things ended with us, obviously.

341
00:25:47,657 --> 00:25:51,801
You mean like how you ran off, like
a coward and you hid in the bathroom?

342
00:25:51,897 --> 00:25:55,217
Yes, that's... that's... yeah.

343
00:25:55,657 --> 00:26:00,281
You know, technically,
we never really ended things.

344
00:26:00,377 --> 00:26:02,361
Yeah.

345
00:26:02,456 --> 00:26:04,560
And we never broke up.

346
00:26:04,656 --> 00:26:07,936
I came back for you, Adam.

347
00:26:09,137 --> 00:26:12,137
Okay, I can't tell
if you're messing with me.

348
00:26:12,536 --> 00:26:14,801
- Can't you?
- I...

349
00:26:14,897 --> 00:26:16,697
Hey.

350
00:26:19,016 --> 00:26:20,960
What're you doing here?

351
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:24,120
Well, I could ask you
the same thing, sugar pie.

352
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:26,919
- Just... the estate meeting today...
- Of course.

353
00:26:27,015 --> 00:26:30,120
- Is what we're doing, talking about it.
- What are you doing here?

354
00:26:30,216 --> 00:26:35,015
Well, I was hoping we could have
a little chat. Just us girls.

355
00:26:37,975 --> 00:26:40,215
So... you and Adam.

356
00:26:41,335 --> 00:26:43,319
Absolutely.

357
00:26:43,415 --> 00:26:48,039
It's funny. I just never really
pictured you two together.

358
00:26:48,134 --> 00:26:52,374
You know,
he will make a wonderful father.

359
00:26:53,494 --> 00:26:58,655
Well, sounds like you have your future
all mapped out. That's really nice.

360
00:26:58,935 --> 00:27:01,398
So... funny thing,

361
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:04,358
I was re-reading
that one article of yours.

362
00:27:04,454 --> 00:27:08,718
Some very witty and wonderful
turns of phrase, by the way.

363
00:27:08,814 --> 00:27:10,917
- No wonder it caught a virus.
- Went viral?

364
00:27:11,013 --> 00:27:13,677
And I was thinking, you may
be right about a few things.

365
00:27:13,773 --> 00:27:17,478
Perhaps we are a little bit
sexually repressed.

366
00:27:17,574 --> 00:27:19,037
At any rate, I was thinking,

367
00:27:19,133 --> 00:27:22,717
you know we probably could use a
little shake up here in Beaver's Ridge,

368
00:27:22,813 --> 00:27:26,277
and I think your orgy idea
is just the ticket.

369
00:27:26,373 --> 00:27:28,533
What...
hang on, my orgy-what-now?

370
00:27:28,853 --> 00:27:33,357
- I'll organize, and you can instruct.
- No.

371
00:27:33,453 --> 00:27:35,876
At least think about it. It's
really the least you could do.

372
00:27:35,972 --> 00:27:39,213
Actually,
the least I can do is nothing.

373
00:27:39,493 --> 00:27:41,676
Well, now who's being
the small-minded one?

374
00:27:41,772 --> 00:27:44,876
You know, I thought you would jump
at the chance to watch all of us

375
00:27:44,972 --> 00:27:49,436
make fools of ourselves as we delve
into the perversions of your mind.

376
00:27:49,532 --> 00:27:52,956
You know, probably give you fodder
for a whole new series of articles,

377
00:27:53,052 --> 00:27:57,732
"How to plan an orgy in a small town."
If you can come up with a better title.

378
00:27:58,292 --> 00:28:01,371
Unless, of course,
you can't handle it.

379
00:28:02,651 --> 00:28:06,635
So all I would have
to do is instruct?

380
00:28:06,731 --> 00:28:08,491
I mean, like,
I wouldn't actually have to...

381
00:28:08,731 --> 00:28:11,891
Fornicate with us? Oh, God. No.

382
00:28:16,131 --> 00:28:19,251
Heather wants me to
plan a sex party.

383
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:22,650
Oh, that's fucking hilarious.

384
00:28:24,771 --> 00:28:27,170
But... what's wrong?

385
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:30,250
I'm a virgin.

386
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:39,913
So, just to clarify everything
you know about sex is bullshit?

387
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:43,513
No, that... that's not true.
I've...

388
00:28:43,609 --> 00:28:46,273
interviewed people,
and I go to bars, and...

389
00:28:46,369 --> 00:28:50,889
I belong to a few sex clubs.
It's just no applied knowledge.

390
00:28:54,129 --> 00:28:56,833
Wait.
Did your father molest you?

391
00:28:56,929 --> 00:28:59,353
- Alice, Jesus Christ.
- Okay.

392
00:28:59,449 --> 00:29:02,913
Well, I'm sorry. I just have to
ask 'cause that happens to people.

393
00:29:03,009 --> 00:29:05,673
And then they get all psychologically
mashed up, and then they...

394
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:08,992
like their vagina's sealed shut,
so they can't even have sex.

395
00:29:09,088 --> 00:29:11,512
Okay, well, it's not that.

396
00:29:11,608 --> 00:29:14,832
- 'Cause you're terrified of sex?
- No.

397
00:29:14,928 --> 00:29:19,152
I'm just waiting for
someone I can trust.

398
00:29:19,248 --> 00:29:21,471
I need a new drink 'cause I
just threw up in that one.

399
00:29:21,567 --> 00:29:24,288
Okay, fuck off.

400
00:29:24,648 --> 00:29:26,872
Will you come with me
to this thing or not?

401
00:29:26,967 --> 00:29:31,391
Sweetie, you're my very best
friend in this whole stupid town.

402
00:29:31,487 --> 00:29:35,591
I will totally come to your orgy,
and I will totally be there for you,

403
00:29:35,687 --> 00:29:40,007
and I will totally bang
all the hot guys that show up.

404
00:29:44,046 --> 00:29:46,487
That was fast.
What's the verdict?

405
00:29:47,287 --> 00:29:49,767
I'm digging deep.

406
00:30:20,005 --> 00:30:22,005
You ready?

407
00:30:22,405 --> 00:30:25,509
I don't know.
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

408
00:30:25,604 --> 00:30:28,788
I mean... I mean,
can we do this? Is this us?

409
00:30:28,884 --> 00:30:33,404
- Are we... are we orgy people?
- What we're not is quitters.

410
00:30:33,844 --> 00:30:36,549
Now, if we don't go downstairs
and open that door,

411
00:30:36,644 --> 00:30:39,988
then everything that Cassie Cranston thinks
about us and Beaver's Ridge will be true.

412
00:30:40,084 --> 00:30:42,308
She'll think that we're cowards.

413
00:30:42,404 --> 00:30:45,164
Is that what you want her
to think about you?

414
00:30:46,484 --> 00:30:49,787
So, I know all of you
are sexually active,

415
00:30:49,883 --> 00:30:53,067
but what you are about to
embark on needs to be treated

416
00:30:53,163 --> 00:30:57,347
and seen with the respect
of a sport. Okay?

417
00:30:57,443 --> 00:31:00,467
There will be surprises.
The odd queef.

418
00:31:00,563 --> 00:31:04,563
Yeah, okay, yeah.
What is a "queef"?

419
00:31:05,443 --> 00:31:10,523
Okay, it's like flatulence,
that comes out of your...

420
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:14,787
Basically, you're hammering
large quantities of air

421
00:31:14,883 --> 00:31:18,507
into a tight, moist space,
so sounds are gonna be made.

422
00:31:18,602 --> 00:31:21,267
Next, stamina.

423
00:31:21,362 --> 00:31:24,506
It's gonna go a lot faster than
you think. Pornography lies.

424
00:31:24,602 --> 00:31:27,946
No man can go properly for 40
minutes without having an aneurism,

425
00:31:28,042 --> 00:31:32,266
and at that point, any woman's vagina is
gonna be squealing like a worn-out brake pad

426
00:31:32,362 --> 00:31:35,106
at the end of a
high-speed chase.

427
00:31:35,202 --> 00:31:38,106
Are these colorful phrases
really necessary?

428
00:31:38,202 --> 00:31:41,905
You need to know what to expect.
You need to stay hydrated.

429
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:45,705
You're gonna sweat. Which
brings me to my next topic.

430
00:31:45,801 --> 00:31:48,185
Sex stank.

431
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,385
You're not gonna
notice your own.

432
00:31:50,481 --> 00:31:54,745
But you will notice other peoples,
and in a room full of people sweating,

433
00:31:54,841 --> 00:31:59,065
and mashing their genitals
together, it's gonna create a...

434
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,040
Musk.

435
00:32:01,401 --> 00:32:03,544
How bad could it possibly be?

436
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:08,024
Bad. Thick.
It's gonna seep into everything.

437
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:12,600
Thank God I got these
lovely plastic couch covers.

438
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:16,303
- So shall we just dive right in?
- Well...

439
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,824
I think this was supposed
to just be a preliminary chat.

440
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,999
Did anyone here think we were
just gonna dive right in?

441
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:27,319
Okay, well.

442
00:32:56,398 --> 00:32:59,582
Okay, guys,
I think if you're gonna do this,

443
00:32:59,678 --> 00:33:04,638
you just have to rip the band-aid
off, and do it. You know?

444
00:33:04,918 --> 00:33:06,862
Yeah.

445
00:33:06,958 --> 00:33:09,021
- Heather, do you have an egg timer?
- Yes, I do. Yeah.

446
00:33:09,117 --> 00:33:10,741
That way we can set
the timer for 5 minutes

447
00:33:10,837 --> 00:33:14,957
and give everybody a chance to
switch it up, if they want to.

448
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:18,781
I...

449
00:33:18,877 --> 00:33:21,821
All right,
we're gonna kick it old-school.

450
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:23,981
Gentlemen,
put your keys in the bowl.

451
00:33:24,077 --> 00:33:27,301
- Yeah.
- I walked here, can I use fishing license?

452
00:33:27,397 --> 00:33:30,596
- How do you not have keys?
- Who locks their door?

453
00:33:34,956 --> 00:33:37,860
So my choices are Adam,
or Bruce.

454
00:33:37,956 --> 00:33:39,980
Can't have sex with Adam.
He's your husband.

455
00:33:40,076 --> 00:33:42,819
Right, I mean, why would
you want to sleep with me?

456
00:33:42,915 --> 00:33:45,060
- You're right.
- I was kidding.

457
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:47,940
Okay, Bruce.
Let's make the best of it.

458
00:33:48,035 --> 00:33:50,635
A little less enthusiasm,
please.

459
00:33:57,915 --> 00:34:01,259
- How are we not already having sex?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I just...

460
00:34:01,355 --> 00:34:04,299
- You... you're really beautiful.
- I'm sorry.

461
00:34:04,395 --> 00:34:06,818
It's okay. You know what I'm
gonna do? I'm gonna close my eyes,

462
00:34:06,914 --> 00:34:11,795
and I'm just gonna imagine that you have
leprosy. Otherwise, this is gonna...

463
00:34:11,955 --> 00:34:13,978
And that's not...

464
00:34:14,074 --> 00:34:16,794
You shouldn't tell people that.

465
00:34:24,554 --> 00:34:28,433
No... okay. Just give me a
second. Give me a second.

466
00:34:28,954 --> 00:34:33,153
Okay, I'm good now.
I'm good. Nope. Nope.

467
00:34:34,034 --> 00:34:37,433
- That's my jawbone. Yeah.
- Oh, so defiant.

468
00:34:38,113 --> 00:34:41,993
Slow it down, slow it way down.
Slow it way down.

469
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,672
Okay.

470
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:50,296
- Oh, my God, your lips.
- My lips?

471
00:34:50,392 --> 00:34:54,552
They're so soft.
What do you put on them?

472
00:34:55,512 --> 00:34:57,792
Well, wine. Wine, mostly.

473
00:34:58,872 --> 00:35:03,336
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait... No,
no, no, no. No, no, no, I can't.

474
00:35:03,432 --> 00:35:06,432
No, no, no, no, just hold it.
Hold on.

475
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:11,176
- Stop staring, it's rude.
- Where am I supposed to look?

476
00:35:11,272 --> 00:35:16,911
- Is this turning you on?
- It's not... not turning me on.

477
00:35:18,351 --> 00:35:22,255
Three, two, wait.
No, I need... I need six...

478
00:35:22,351 --> 00:35:24,191
No, that's it.

479
00:35:24,911 --> 00:35:27,975
- Come on, I was just getting my groove on.
- Time's up. Chester?

480
00:35:28,071 --> 00:35:31,255
Yeah, I'm sorry. Excuse me, I'm gonna
need a few minutes, to pardon me.

481
00:35:31,351 --> 00:35:34,495
- Replenish the fluids here 'cause...
- Did you already?

482
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:37,815
- I just grazed the tip. I grazed it.
- Please tell me it was on the couch cover.

483
00:35:37,911 --> 00:35:39,974
- I'm ready to party.
- Jeez.

484
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:41,974
- Is that normal?
- God no.

485
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,814
- Why don't we have some make-up sex?
- Oh, no.

486
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:46,294
Did not all the energy in here
just get sucked out?

487
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:48,094
No, no, it didn't.

488
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:51,293
I think we ripped the band-aid
off a little too quickly here.

489
00:35:51,389 --> 00:35:54,494
- We should have catered.
- A potluck would have been nice.

490
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:56,894
Cassie, I feel like we're gonna
need some spare dicks,

491
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:00,174
in case, you know, chappy gets pre-maturely
excited, just keep the party going.

492
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:01,493
- I can hear you.
- Agreed.

493
00:36:01,589 --> 00:36:04,414
You know what would be good? Is maybe
if we had some other ladies as well?

494
00:36:04,509 --> 00:36:08,053
People from around town. Or
Cassie, if you wanted get involved.

495
00:36:08,149 --> 00:36:11,773
No. I mean, I... that wasn't...
that wasn't part of the...

496
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:14,213
No. Okay.

497
00:36:14,308 --> 00:36:18,069
I think this little experiment has just
proven that we need to go a little bit slower.

498
00:36:18,268 --> 00:36:22,133
So let's get together again,
but this time,

499
00:36:22,229 --> 00:36:27,132
ease into it, focus on the basics.
And if all goes well, then, round two.

500
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:30,692
I don't wanna sound like a jerk. But what
am I supposed to do with this erection?

501
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:33,852
I saw a papaya on the counter there
you could probably have your way with.

502
00:36:33,948 --> 00:36:36,732
No, it's too ripe.
It's not gonna work.

503
00:36:36,828 --> 00:36:39,107
Why do you know that?

504
00:36:44,067 --> 00:36:45,451
What about Michael Lobucks?

505
00:36:45,547 --> 00:36:48,131
He's got a terrible back issue.
He wouldn't the last 5 minutes.

506
00:36:48,227 --> 00:36:52,387
- What about the mayor?
- Gus, Gus? Been there.

507
00:36:53,187 --> 00:36:56,747
- They can't be black.
- Oh, my God.

508
00:36:57,226 --> 00:36:59,450
Wait, Gus is black?

509
00:36:59,546 --> 00:37:01,466
- Mrs. Reddick.
- Bruce, she's dead.

510
00:37:01,587 --> 00:37:04,690
Margo and Dave Anderson.

511
00:37:04,786 --> 00:37:07,611
No... no. Absolutely not. Have
you seen how he plays charades?

512
00:37:07,706 --> 00:37:09,730
I'm not getting into a sexual
situation with that man.

513
00:37:09,826 --> 00:37:13,490
So, there's a bunch of us and
we're doing this thing, okay?

514
00:37:13,586 --> 00:37:15,170
And I don't know how to ask...

515
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:18,250
We've been encouraged to invite
other people to the thing.

516
00:37:18,346 --> 00:37:21,249
- What we're gonna be doing is...
- What kind of thing is it?

517
00:37:21,345 --> 00:37:24,650
We're gonna... it's like a
pri... it's like a very...

518
00:37:24,746 --> 00:37:26,970
- It's a private fun thing.
- Yeah.

519
00:37:27,066 --> 00:37:29,369
Like, we're all...
we are all together...

520
00:37:29,465 --> 00:37:34,489
In the private thing where you touch each
other's nipples and you fuck each other?

521
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:38,089
- How do you know... what are you...
- Stop trying to invite me to the orgy.

522
00:37:38,185 --> 00:37:40,689
- How do you know about the orgy?
- How do I not know about the orgy?

523
00:37:40,785 --> 00:37:42,928
Bruce is all over town
and you need to talk to that guy

524
00:37:43,024 --> 00:37:46,049
because everybody in this town is
gonna know what you idiots are up to.

525
00:37:46,145 --> 00:37:48,808
Okay, okay, okay. So... did
Bruce invite you to it, already?

526
00:37:48,904 --> 00:37:50,448
- Yes, he did.
- He did?

527
00:37:50,544 --> 00:37:53,169
- Yes.
- So you...

528
00:37:53,265 --> 00:37:56,928
No. No! I knew you
were gonna ask me that.

529
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:59,048
- You disappoint me, Chester.
- What?

530
00:37:59,144 --> 00:38:01,568
You guys haven't RSVP'ed
to my party, yet.

531
00:38:01,663 --> 00:38:04,488
Hey. Seth, man. How long
have you been standing there?

532
00:38:04,584 --> 00:38:09,088
Actually, funny that you're here because
Chester has something that he wants to ask you.

533
00:38:09,184 --> 00:38:11,167
- No...
- There's this thing that's happening.

534
00:38:11,263 --> 00:38:12,687
And people are encouraged...

535
00:38:12,783 --> 00:38:15,088
- No, that's not...
- To invite other people...

536
00:38:15,183 --> 00:38:18,383
and he wanted to talk to you
about this thing.

537
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:21,167
What? Coming. I gotta grab
this... this delivery.

538
00:38:21,263 --> 00:38:23,367
- Really? Interesting.
- I gotta get this delivery here.

539
00:38:23,462 --> 00:38:24,847
- Isn't that your bathroom?
- What?

540
00:38:24,943 --> 00:38:26,703
- Are you going to the bathroom?
- Hey, Seth.

541
00:38:26,943 --> 00:38:30,366
- Hi, Pauline.
- How is your day going, buddy?

542
00:38:30,462 --> 00:38:32,542
- It's busy.
- Yeah.

543
00:38:36,142 --> 00:38:39,807
So you want to have an orgy in a town
where you can dial the wrong number,

544
00:38:39,903 --> 00:38:43,846
- and still have a ten-minute conversation?
- I'll owe you.

545
00:38:43,942 --> 00:38:46,446
I really need to work the numbers
in my favor, and you coming

546
00:38:46,542 --> 00:38:48,966
- helps knock some of the other guys out.
- How?

547
00:38:49,062 --> 00:38:51,502
You know...

548
00:38:52,021 --> 00:38:55,286
- You smoke a pole man, you know.
- The pole?

549
00:38:55,382 --> 00:38:57,925
You play the skin flute, you put penises
in your mouth, 'cause you're gay.

550
00:38:58,021 --> 00:38:59,725
Not 'cause you're happy,
'cause you're a homosexual.

551
00:38:59,821 --> 00:39:03,325
Not that you couldn't be a homosexual
and be happy I'm sure you love it.

552
00:39:03,421 --> 00:39:05,485
So...

553
00:39:05,581 --> 00:39:08,501
You want me at this
orgy because I'm gay,

554
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:12,204
and that will force one of the
other non-gay men to sleep with me,

555
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,005
which will make more women
available for you?

556
00:39:15,101 --> 00:39:16,940
Look.

557
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,524
I really need this, man.

558
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:24,404
Allie's leaving me, it was...
it was a huge hit to my ego.

559
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:28,844
If I agree to this, you give me
the full commission on your house.

560
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,604
That's a big commission, man.

561
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,004
- Are you coming to my birthday party?
- Jesus Christ.

562
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:38,020
- My mom wanted an RSVP like, yesterday.
- I don't know, man.

563
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:42,299
You should totally come
to our party, Seth.

564
00:39:45,779 --> 00:39:46,939
I...

565
00:39:51,498 --> 00:39:54,299
- Alice.
- Fuck! Jesus, Seth.

566
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:58,083
- You haven't RSVP'ed to my party, yet.
- Haven't I?

567
00:39:58,179 --> 00:40:01,978
It's just my mom. She doesn't know how
many cupcakes to make. She's freaking out.

568
00:40:03,178 --> 00:40:05,978
- Okay.
- Are you going to that party?

569
00:40:06,658 --> 00:40:08,562
- What party?
- I don't know.

570
00:40:08,658 --> 00:40:12,042
- Bruce told me about some party at Adam's.
- That's been cancelled.

571
00:40:12,138 --> 00:40:14,442
Are you sure? Because he just
told me about it like, just now.

572
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:17,682
Well, Seth, I don't know,
because Bruce is an idiot.

573
00:40:17,778 --> 00:40:22,281
Yeah. Hey, that's good, because
tomorrow's my party anyways,

574
00:40:22,377 --> 00:40:25,041
so you can just tell everybody
to RSVP, and then they can come.

575
00:40:25,137 --> 00:40:28,802
Okay, I... I'll try to remember.

576
00:40:28,897 --> 00:40:31,801
- Can I have a glass of water?
- I don't. I don't have any water.

577
00:40:31,897 --> 00:40:34,497
I'm thirsty.
Do you have a blanket? I'm cold.

578
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:43,161
So I think the first thing
we need to do here is just...

579
00:40:43,257 --> 00:40:46,601
acknowledge the awkwardness
of the situation.

580
00:40:46,696 --> 00:40:51,040
So, Chester, if maybe we could switch
spots. So you could sit over here.

581
00:40:51,136 --> 00:40:53,680
- You wanna do...
- Yeah.

582
00:40:53,776 --> 00:40:55,616
Okay.

583
00:40:56,296 --> 00:40:58,840
So let's start with Heather.

584
00:40:58,936 --> 00:41:03,655
How does it make you feel
to see Adam with someone else?

585
00:41:06,975 --> 00:41:08,919
Well, I...

586
00:41:09,015 --> 00:41:11,879
- I think we can all be adults here.
- Yeah?

587
00:41:11,975 --> 00:41:17,695
Okay, so, this doesn't bother you, or
make you upset or uncomfortable at all?

588
00:41:20,535 --> 00:41:22,199
No.

589
00:41:22,294 --> 00:41:25,598
No, I think that's...
that's very neighborly of you,

590
00:41:25,694 --> 00:41:29,279
- of both of you.
- I'm very neighborly.

591
00:41:29,375 --> 00:41:33,054
- Is this... is this hard for you, Adam?
- Oh, it's hard for me.

592
00:41:33,254 --> 00:41:37,678
I mean... it would... that would be
hard for me. That would be challenging.

593
00:41:37,774 --> 00:41:40,918
Yeah, what about this, Heather?

594
00:41:41,014 --> 00:41:45,917
This must be driving you
absolutely insane.

595
00:41:46,013 --> 00:41:49,997
- Bruce, what are you doing?
- We're just easing into it, big fella.

596
00:41:50,093 --> 00:41:54,693
You know, you are carrying
a lot of tension...

597
00:41:54,813 --> 00:41:58,477
in your buster deltoids. You know what? I'd
be a lot easier if I got your shirt off.

598
00:41:58,573 --> 00:42:01,877
- That way we can really get at it.
- I don't think...

599
00:42:01,973 --> 00:42:04,357
I'll get it. That'll be
our additional guests.

600
00:42:04,453 --> 00:42:07,237
Yeah, let's just go ahead. That's a
weird way to open a shirt, anyway.

601
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:09,677
Let's just put the kybosh on that
and see who these guests are.

602
00:42:09,772 --> 00:42:13,052
- Go away!
- Jesus fucking...

603
00:42:13,292 --> 00:42:17,277
- Hi, guys. Hey, come on in.
- Thank you.

604
00:42:17,373 --> 00:42:21,836
Everybody,
you remember Anna and Otis.

605
00:42:21,932 --> 00:42:25,611
- From racquetball, right?
- Who the fuck invited you?

606
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:29,956
Honey, I don't know about this.

607
00:42:30,051 --> 00:42:32,891
- Just a moment, everyone.
- Sure.

608
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:38,555
Sweetie, we agreed to this. Everything
we tried hasn't been working.

609
00:42:38,651 --> 00:42:41,276
The long walks, the spicy food,
the primrose oil.

610
00:42:41,371 --> 00:42:44,595
The mid-wife thought that maybe this would
do the trick. We want to do it naturally.

611
00:42:44,691 --> 00:42:48,195
I know, I know,
but why can't it just be you?

612
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:52,731
Because it's been me for the
last 48 hours and I'm exhausted.

613
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:59,394
Listen, you're peeing every ten
minutes, you're not sleeping.

614
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:03,290
I love you so much,
but this baby needs to come out.

615
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:07,370
- You're right.
- Yeah.

616
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:09,754
- We need to do this.
- Right.

617
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:13,513
I love you. Okay.

618
00:43:13,609 --> 00:43:15,770
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

619
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:19,354
Okay.

620
00:43:19,449 --> 00:43:22,969
So,
who's gonna fuck my wife first?

621
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:27,993
- Okay, sexual positions...
- I know all three of them,

622
00:43:28,089 --> 00:43:31,873
- but we only do the doggy-style.
- I'm sorry, all three of them?

623
00:43:31,969 --> 00:43:34,273
You guys don't look
at each other when you...

624
00:43:34,369 --> 00:43:35,713
Nope.

625
00:43:35,809 --> 00:43:38,433
- Why not?
- I don't think anyone wants to know that.

626
00:43:38,529 --> 00:43:39,793
- I wanna know.
- I'd love to know.

627
00:43:39,889 --> 00:43:41,912
- It's private, it's between us.
- He makes a face.

628
00:43:42,008 --> 00:43:44,032
- Okay.
- It's very unpleasant.

629
00:43:44,128 --> 00:43:45,872
- It's involuntary.
- It's disturbing, actually.

630
00:43:45,968 --> 00:43:48,632
It's like a sneeze. Would you
judge a person for how they sneeze?

631
00:43:48,728 --> 00:43:52,208
Okay,
let's not ruin the surprise.

632
00:43:53,488 --> 00:43:56,352
We have some work to do.
Everybody grab a partner.

633
00:43:56,448 --> 00:43:59,552
Okay, I drew up some sexual
positions for us to try here.

634
00:43:59,648 --> 00:44:01,231
- What, really? Me?
- Get lost.

635
00:44:01,327 --> 00:44:02,992
Thank you. I would be honored.

636
00:44:03,088 --> 00:44:06,471
If we could just skip the lego instructions.
I mean, clearly, I've done this before.

637
00:44:06,567 --> 00:44:09,527
I really just need someone
to bang the baby out of me.

638
00:44:09,967 --> 00:44:14,926
Also, if you could ejaculate directly inside
my wife's vagina, that would be great.

639
00:44:15,287 --> 00:44:17,150
It actually contains
prosteligence

640
00:44:17,246 --> 00:44:21,167
which can stimulate the cervix
and can cause contractions.

641
00:44:21,526 --> 00:44:22,926
Yeah.

642
00:44:25,486 --> 00:44:29,550
Can you not put all your weight on
me? It makes me feel like I gotta pee.

643
00:44:29,646 --> 00:44:33,110
- You wanna pee on me?
- That is not even close to what I said.

644
00:44:33,206 --> 00:44:37,886
Okay, Bruce, why don't you try
putting her leg over your shoulder?

645
00:44:39,765 --> 00:44:42,669
Actually this does feel good. Why
have we never tried this position?

646
00:44:42,765 --> 00:44:45,549
- I didn't know you liked that.
- Well, you could have asked.

647
00:44:45,645 --> 00:44:48,949
- I'm not a mind-reader, pumpkin.
- That's why you should ask.

648
00:44:49,045 --> 00:44:51,909
I don't think this is the time
for that, guys.

649
00:44:52,005 --> 00:44:55,429
Right. Sorry, honey. We're being
rude. Bruce is trying to penetrate me.

650
00:44:55,525 --> 00:44:58,589
I'm sorry, Bruce.
All right, give me what you got.

651
00:44:58,685 --> 00:45:01,349
- I got nothing. This is...
- What?

652
00:45:01,445 --> 00:45:04,028
- This is fucked up, man.
- What?

653
00:45:04,124 --> 00:45:06,565
What the fuck is your problem?

654
00:45:07,405 --> 00:45:10,748
- Two, three, okay. I gotta get it right...
- Yep, yep, okay.

655
00:45:10,844 --> 00:45:14,668
...in here. Cassie?

656
00:45:14,764 --> 00:45:16,908
I don't know, I think one of us
has to be lesbian to do this.

657
00:45:17,004 --> 00:45:20,988
No, not if... see here, if
you're more like this... then...

658
00:45:21,084 --> 00:45:24,308
I see. Yeah, no,
we both have to be lesbian.

659
00:45:24,404 --> 00:45:26,724
That's not gonna work.

660
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:32,923
There's no need to be shy, Otis.

661
00:45:33,323 --> 00:45:37,387
I for one am very interested
in fornicating with you.

662
00:45:37,483 --> 00:45:42,026
Well, no, no, no. I'm just here
for Anna, in case the baby pops.

663
00:45:42,122 --> 00:45:45,627
Surely there's better ways
to pass the time.

664
00:45:45,722 --> 00:45:48,827
Well, I'm gonna say thank you,
but no thank you.

665
00:45:48,923 --> 00:45:50,426
Okay,
I'm gonna level with you here,

666
00:45:50,522 --> 00:45:52,746
Anna told me that you got her
pregnant without even trying.

667
00:45:52,842 --> 00:45:57,627
- I need your baby batter, so be a neighbor.
- I mean, my semen isn't sugar, Heather.

668
00:45:57,722 --> 00:46:01,346
Besides, Anna and I have been having
sex all day, all right? I'm exhausted.

669
00:46:01,441 --> 00:46:06,442
Even if I could get it up, it's
like a ghost coughing down there.

670
00:46:09,242 --> 00:46:11,706
- Oh, my God.
- Did you just...

671
00:46:11,801 --> 00:46:14,361
No, no. I'm good.

672
00:46:15,962 --> 00:46:20,105
Okay, I think we can... start
with the actual sex now. I'm...

673
00:46:20,201 --> 00:46:23,905
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I think I'm ready. Yeah.

674
00:46:24,001 --> 00:46:27,264
- I felt the baby kick.
- Well, don't make it weird.

675
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,744
She just wants to say hello.
Don't you baby?

676
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:33,265
- Please don't talk like a baby.
- She just wants to meet everybody.

677
00:46:33,361 --> 00:46:36,944
- Help her meet everybody, Adam.
- I don't know that I'm qualified for that.

678
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,424
Keep it sexy, okay?

679
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:44,744
If you arch your back, I think it'll allow
for at least another inch of penetration.

680
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:47,239
Thank you, Cassie.

681
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,784
Oh, my God. Oh, jeez.

682
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,159
Just for the record,
I am not inside you right now.

683
00:46:56,239 --> 00:46:59,423
- Is this a good position?
- It's just the water stage.

684
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:02,399
- The baby's not gonna come for hours.
- Water stage?

685
00:47:08,479 --> 00:47:11,623
- Are you having a seizure? What's...
- It's coming!

686
00:47:11,719 --> 00:47:15,662
- Oh, my God. Are you having a contraction?
- I'm coming! Oh, thanks, sweet Lord.

687
00:47:15,758 --> 00:47:19,862
- There it is! Okay, it's happening.
- It's fine, it's fine. We got a while yet.

688
00:47:19,958 --> 00:47:23,102
No, no, no. If we could get it wrapped up
as soon as possible. If that's possible.

689
00:47:23,198 --> 00:47:25,142
- Let's get her up.
- This feels so fucking good.

690
00:47:25,238 --> 00:47:27,102
Why don't you ever
feel this fucking good?

691
00:47:27,198 --> 00:47:29,662
She doesn't mean that, guys.
That's the baby talking.

692
00:47:29,757 --> 00:47:32,022
Can we get this guy off?
This is my wife, here.

693
00:47:32,118 --> 00:47:35,318
Just a little bit of help guys,
would be really...

694
00:47:37,557 --> 00:47:40,182
Screamer. Okay, there it is.

695
00:47:40,278 --> 00:47:43,101
- There we go.
- I would throw those out.

696
00:47:43,197 --> 00:47:45,901
See, what did I tell you
about the plastic couch covers?

697
00:47:45,997 --> 00:47:48,877
What a great night guys.
Thank you.

698
00:47:51,956 --> 00:47:54,517
Can I ask a silly question?

699
00:47:55,956 --> 00:48:00,876
How come none of you have realized
what a terrible idea this is?

700
00:48:02,077 --> 00:48:06,620
I mean, for one night
of awkward pleasure,

701
00:48:06,716 --> 00:48:09,476
you are gonna jeopardize
friendships...

702
00:48:10,356 --> 00:48:12,979
marriages even...

703
00:48:13,075 --> 00:48:16,996
Look around, these are
your neighbors, your friends.

704
00:48:17,796 --> 00:48:20,659
I just want to make sure
that you've thought about this.

705
00:48:20,755 --> 00:48:22,660
Really thought about it.

706
00:48:22,755 --> 00:48:25,379
This is a small town.
People are gonna find out.

707
00:48:25,475 --> 00:48:28,619
One of you will talk,
maybe not right away,

708
00:48:28,715 --> 00:48:30,515
but eventually.

709
00:48:31,155 --> 00:48:35,554
I read Cassie's article and the reason why
it upset at everybody is 'cause she's right.

710
00:48:36,114 --> 00:48:39,635
You are not the type of people
to do this sort of thing.

711
00:48:41,314 --> 00:48:43,875
You're not adventurous.

712
00:48:45,594 --> 00:48:48,114
Who are you trying to fool?

713
00:49:02,593 --> 00:49:05,777
Half a dozen chimps
are locked in a room.

714
00:49:05,873 --> 00:49:09,417
And in the center of the room,
there's a ladder...

715
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:12,537
on top of which a banana
dangles from the ceiling.

716
00:49:12,633 --> 00:49:15,337
So one the chimps decides
to go for the banana.

717
00:49:15,433 --> 00:49:21,257
But before he can even touch the ladder,
they're all sprayed with ice cold water.

718
00:49:21,353 --> 00:49:23,817
- I'm so confused right now.
- Shut up.

719
00:49:23,913 --> 00:49:26,817
So after a while,
they figure out the connection,

720
00:49:26,912 --> 00:49:31,752
between the ladder and the water, and
they don't go for the banana anymore.

721
00:49:32,952 --> 00:49:36,856
So then one of the chimps
is replaced by a new chimp.

722
00:49:36,952 --> 00:49:40,176
And he decides to
go for the banana.

723
00:49:40,272 --> 00:49:44,616
Before he can even touch the
ladder, they... they attack him.

724
00:49:44,711 --> 00:49:49,776
He goes for it again and they literally,
they beat the message into him,

725
00:49:49,872 --> 00:49:53,351
do not touch the fucking ladder.

726
00:49:54,911 --> 00:49:59,311
Eventually, all the chimps are
replaced by an entirely new group.

727
00:49:59,951 --> 00:50:04,015
They don't know about the water.
They don't even know it exists.

728
00:50:04,111 --> 00:50:08,334
But anytime any of them
go for that banana,

729
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:10,654
they attack them.

730
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:13,510
And they have no idea why.

731
00:50:13,991 --> 00:50:16,095
All they know is,

732
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:21,270
this is what happens when you go
after the thing you want the most.

733
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:26,349
Something someone else
says you can't have...

734
00:50:27,349 --> 00:50:30,669
and they never question it,
it's just what they do.

735
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:33,133
So my question is,

736
00:50:33,229 --> 00:50:36,350
are you gonna go
after your banana?

737
00:50:37,189 --> 00:50:40,589
Or are you gonna let all the
other chimps knock you down?

738
00:50:42,149 --> 00:50:46,573
- Did that make anyone else a little bit hard?
- Bruce, there are ladies present.

739
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:49,653
I'm sorry,
did it make anyone hard, or wet?

740
00:50:49,749 --> 00:50:52,949
Look, y'all want this.

741
00:50:54,149 --> 00:50:56,629
You need this.

742
00:50:58,548 --> 00:51:02,548
And if you're in,
then I'm in, too.

743
00:51:03,028 --> 00:51:05,548
All the way.

744
00:51:08,268 --> 00:51:11,732
- I'd like to go after my banana.
- Me, too.

745
00:51:11,828 --> 00:51:14,652
Can I put the whole
thing in my mouth?

746
00:51:14,748 --> 00:51:18,387
Saturday. My place.

747
00:51:30,707 --> 00:51:33,187
Maybe they're late.

748
00:51:36,466 --> 00:51:39,571
Why don't you come on
the cruise with me?

749
00:51:39,666 --> 00:51:44,970
It'd be good for you to get out of
town. You don't need these people.

750
00:51:45,066 --> 00:51:47,946
They've never accepted you.

751
00:52:05,545 --> 00:52:09,665
Well.
Well, happy birthday, Seth.

752
00:52:19,104 --> 00:52:20,945
Okay.

753
00:52:23,705 --> 00:52:25,544
Okay.

754
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:32,048
Okay. Pace yourself,
Chester, buddy. Pace.

755
00:52:32,144 --> 00:52:35,704
Hello. You're very pretty.
I'm Chester.

756
00:52:36,984 --> 00:52:39,424
Slow down, slow down.

757
00:52:41,463 --> 00:52:44,944
Yeah, yeah,
here comes the good stuff.

758
00:52:47,463 --> 00:52:51,143
God dammit, why? Why?

759
00:52:52,423 --> 00:52:54,263
Dude.

760
00:52:54,543 --> 00:52:57,807
Everyone can fucking see you! You know
that that chick has a dick, right?

761
00:52:57,902 --> 00:53:01,462
- Yeah, thanks.
- I support masturbation.

762
00:53:03,942 --> 00:53:08,126
Hey, you're not...
you're not gonna mention this...

763
00:53:08,222 --> 00:53:11,246
to anyone are you? 'Cause I'm...
I'm a little just...

764
00:53:11,342 --> 00:53:15,662
- you know, embarrassed about it.
- I would never do that.

765
00:53:16,542 --> 00:53:19,566
No, I'm serious. Why would I go
and tell anybody that's private.

766
00:53:19,662 --> 00:53:21,886
It's personal, that I walked
in on you. It's totally fine.

767
00:53:21,982 --> 00:53:26,581
Don't be embarrassed. I've done
weird shit. Like eat half a pizza.

768
00:53:29,102 --> 00:53:32,541
Why don't you have any friends,
seriously?

769
00:53:36,501 --> 00:53:37,525
That kinda...

770
00:53:37,621 --> 00:53:40,245
- No!
- I mean, what the fuck are you?

771
00:53:40,341 --> 00:53:43,844
No, I didn't mean it like that, I meant like,
why don't you have friends other than me?

772
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:47,564
Friends your own age, 'cause
you're... you're so... I mean, you...

773
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:49,685
I don't know. People are idiots.

774
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:51,925
- Generally. You're an idiot.
- Yeah, I am an idiot.

775
00:53:52,021 --> 00:53:54,484
- You're just an idiot, at all times.
- It's true.

776
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:57,484
I mean, you're only friends with
me because you wanna bang me.

777
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:00,764
Oh, fuck, holy shit.
It was a dream. It was a dream.

778
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:04,124
I had a sex dream about
my aunt Merga, once. Okay?

779
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:07,723
- You shouldn't tell people that.
- No, I'm trying to make a point here.

780
00:54:07,819 --> 00:54:10,964
All right, that it doesn't
mean... it's nothing.

781
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:14,643
It's just a dream. Okay?

782
00:54:14,739 --> 00:54:17,483
- What's so wrong about me, anyway?
- What?

783
00:54:17,579 --> 00:54:21,002
Why wouldn't you want to bang me? You
keep saying, "no I would never do that,"

784
00:54:21,098 --> 00:54:25,603
- but I mean, do I... am I repulsive?
- Why would you wanna have sex with me?

785
00:54:25,699 --> 00:54:27,722
No, no, that's not what I said,
I didn't say that.

786
00:54:27,818 --> 00:54:30,298
- But you didn't not say that, right?
- Okay.

787
00:54:30,458 --> 00:54:33,762
- You did not say that.
- You should be a detective.

788
00:54:33,858 --> 00:54:36,883
- Really?
- Yeah. No. No.

789
00:54:36,978 --> 00:54:39,923
Get a badge or something?

790
00:54:40,018 --> 00:54:42,282
I'll get you a detective badge.

791
00:54:42,378 --> 00:54:44,258
Thanks.

792
00:54:44,658 --> 00:54:46,497
What?

793
00:54:53,138 --> 00:54:55,682
What... what're you doing?

794
00:54:55,778 --> 00:54:57,602
Oh, God.

795
00:54:57,698 --> 00:55:00,017
What're you...

796
00:55:00,417 --> 00:55:04,257
- What're you doing right now?
- I'm bored.

797
00:55:14,537 --> 00:55:17,056
What's happening right now?

798
00:55:22,656 --> 00:55:25,376
Nothing is happening, Chester.

799
00:55:26,576 --> 00:55:29,719
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

800
00:55:29,815 --> 00:55:34,760
I just made it... I made it really
weird here. I feel really stupid.

801
00:55:34,856 --> 00:55:36,960
- You feel really stupid?
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

802
00:55:37,056 --> 00:55:39,079
That's how you feel right now?

803
00:55:39,175 --> 00:55:41,375
Fuck you, Chester.

804
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:13,133
Hey, it's Polly.

805
00:56:14,253 --> 00:56:17,133
I'm coming to your orgy.

806
00:56:24,373 --> 00:56:28,957
Happy orgy day! Right?

807
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:32,437
- And Chester...
- Yes.

808
00:56:32,533 --> 00:56:34,932
Hey, everyone. Hi.

809
00:56:36,093 --> 00:56:39,772
- Polly, you look, you look really nice.
- Oh, do I?

810
00:56:41,213 --> 00:56:42,676
Well, let's get started,
shall we?

811
00:56:42,772 --> 00:56:45,637
- I call Cassie.
- What? No.

812
00:56:45,733 --> 00:56:48,836
Come on, I'm really in the mood to have sex
with someone I've never been with before.

813
00:56:48,932 --> 00:56:54,172
She said "no," you know? Why don't you
just take another shot at Heather there?

814
00:56:55,771 --> 00:56:57,612
What?

815
00:56:58,092 --> 00:57:00,491
In high school I put his penis
in my mouth a little.

816
00:57:00,851 --> 00:57:03,675
- Oh, jeez.
- She didn't say I have a small penis.

817
00:57:03,771 --> 00:57:07,515
- No, she kind of did.
- Those two are out and I'm not into Polly?

818
00:57:07,611 --> 00:57:11,051
- What the shit?
- Do you want to have sex with me?

819
00:57:11,331 --> 00:57:15,155
- I don't feel comfortable answering that.
- Thank you very much. Cassie and I then.

820
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:18,795
I...
I wanna have sex with Spencer.

821
00:57:18,891 --> 00:57:22,434
Are you serious? Spencer's gay.

822
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:24,474
You're the only one in town
who actually thinks that.

823
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:27,195
Oh, seriously? Really?

824
00:57:27,291 --> 00:57:30,594
What about that fruity real estate job you
have? What about your hair? The clothes?

825
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:35,610
- That awesome Cologne?
- I don't wear Cologne. That's just me.

826
00:57:36,089 --> 00:57:37,154
Okay.

827
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:40,914
Cassie wants to have sex with Spencer.
Who else wants to have sex with Spencer?

828
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:43,273
For fucks sake.
Who are you sleeping with then?

829
00:57:43,369 --> 00:57:46,114
- Adam.
- No, I don't think so.

830
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:50,234
Guess what? Cock-blocking isn't actually
on the list of things to do in an orgy.

831
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:53,873
So why don't you let Adam decide
who he'd like to stick it in.

832
00:57:53,969 --> 00:57:55,793
Okay.

833
00:57:55,889 --> 00:58:00,393
You know, you're all
wonderful people, and...

834
00:58:00,489 --> 00:58:03,753
- Polly would be...
- Awkward.

835
00:58:03,849 --> 00:58:06,953
- And weird.
- Okay.

836
00:58:07,049 --> 00:58:10,953
Alice, my main concern with you is that I
wouldn't be able to meet your level of...

837
00:58:11,049 --> 00:58:14,408
- experience.
- Go fuck yourself.

838
00:58:14,968 --> 00:58:19,952
So I guess I choose Cassie.

839
00:58:20,048 --> 00:58:23,031
- Too late, I already called dibs on her.
- Okay, stop it.

840
00:58:23,127 --> 00:58:26,112
I'm not participating in anything
where dibs take precedence.

841
00:58:26,208 --> 00:58:29,191
- Have sex with me, please.
- I said no.

842
00:58:29,287 --> 00:58:33,991
God, you are such a hypocrite, Cassie.
You... you run off with your vagina,

843
00:58:34,087 --> 00:58:36,712
and your sexy article things,
and then you have an issue

844
00:58:36,807 --> 00:58:39,751
sleeping with some mildly-annoying person
that you've known your entire life?

845
00:58:39,847 --> 00:58:42,351
No, you do not get to be a
prude, and the town slut,

846
00:58:42,447 --> 00:58:44,607
you're having sex with Bruce,
and that's that.

847
00:58:44,727 --> 00:58:49,127
Jesus fucking Christ, Heather, she's
not a slut, she's just a virgin.

848
00:58:54,406 --> 00:58:59,406
Yeah. Cassie's a virgin.
That would be rich.

849
00:59:00,806 --> 00:59:05,630
But I everything that I know about
sex is because of... your column.

850
00:59:05,726 --> 00:59:08,686
Yeah, me too.
This makes a lot of sense.

851
00:59:10,766 --> 00:59:13,310
I'd like you all to leave now.

852
00:59:13,406 --> 00:59:17,590
Okay. Okay, I'm sure this is
extremely embarrassing for you,

853
00:59:17,686 --> 00:59:19,469
but we've all
been looking forward to this,

854
00:59:19,565 --> 00:59:21,309
- so I think that we should...
- Get out.

855
00:59:21,405 --> 00:59:23,189
We're having our carpets
cleaned, there's nowhere to go.

856
00:59:23,285 --> 00:59:25,069
Get out!

857
00:59:25,165 --> 00:59:30,245
- It's her house, you guys, just...
- Shut up, Alice. You get the fuck out first.

858
00:59:43,484 --> 00:59:46,628
Alice. Hey, Alice.
Alice, excuse me. Hey...

859
00:59:46,724 --> 00:59:49,468
- Don't. What the fuck do you want, Bruce?
- What the fuck were you doing?

860
00:59:49,564 --> 00:59:51,868
You really ruined that for me
in there. What're you doing?

861
00:59:51,964 --> 00:59:54,868
- I could not give a baker's fuck.
- A baker's fuck?

862
00:59:54,964 --> 00:59:57,107
- 13 fucks? What are you talking about?
- That's 13 fucks.

863
00:59:57,203 --> 01:00:00,643
Do you have any idea
how much I needed this?

864
01:00:01,284 --> 01:00:05,547
First, you embarrass me by leaving me,
and then you rub it in my fucking face

865
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:09,707
by getting it on with every single guy
in town. You know... You're embarrassing.

866
01:00:09,802 --> 01:00:11,227
- I'm embarrassing?
- Yeah.

867
01:00:11,322 --> 01:00:12,427
You're pathetic.

868
01:00:12,523 --> 01:00:15,987
- You need to sign our divorce papers.
- You want pathetic? No.

869
01:00:16,083 --> 01:00:19,186
- Not until you tell me why.
- Really? Do you really not know why?

870
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:22,427
Because, if I recall, you didn't
touch me for like, a year.

871
01:00:22,523 --> 01:00:26,267
- And you're acting like a victim, in...
- Oh, what? 'Cause you're so innocent?

872
01:00:26,362 --> 01:00:28,226
- I had some sex.
- Some?

873
01:00:28,322 --> 01:00:30,786
- I may have over-compensated.
- Oh, yeah, you think?

874
01:00:30,882 --> 01:00:33,722
You broke my heart!

875
01:00:34,682 --> 01:00:37,002
My fucking heart!

876
01:00:37,722 --> 01:00:39,522
Asshole.

877
01:00:41,002 --> 01:00:44,602
Sign the fucking papers.
It's the least you could do.

878
01:00:49,521 --> 01:00:52,305
So, I have been thinking
about the orgy...

879
01:00:52,401 --> 01:00:54,425
The orgy's cancelled.

880
01:00:54,521 --> 01:00:58,145
No, I'm Heather Mitchell, no one
cancels a social event on me.

881
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:01,584
Honey, please, will you just forget
about the orgy and come to bed.

882
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:04,385
Adam, I am trying to figure out
a way to keep this orgy going.

883
01:01:04,481 --> 01:01:07,464
The last thing I have time for
right now is to have sex with you.

884
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:10,344
- Why is it so important to you?
- To us, it's important to us.

885
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:14,064
No, it isn't. I thought we were trying
to have a baby, that's the goal.

886
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:16,944
And that is exactly why
the orgy is so important.

887
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,520
What are you talking about?

888
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,599
Okay.

889
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:26,879
Look, I...

890
01:01:27,639 --> 01:01:28,623
What?

891
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:31,903
I don't want you to take this
the wrong way, but...

892
01:01:31,999 --> 01:01:34,639
I had your sperm tested.

893
01:01:35,879 --> 01:01:39,223
It's just we've been trying for a really
long time, and I got tested first,

894
01:01:39,319 --> 01:01:43,998
and everything was fine,
so it was the next step.

895
01:01:44,838 --> 01:01:48,958
What do you mean? I didn't give you
any sperm. How'd you get my sperm?

896
01:01:50,478 --> 01:01:55,718
Well, when you make deposits,
I make withdrawls.

897
01:01:57,958 --> 01:01:59,798
You...

898
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:04,757
Oh, my God.

899
01:02:06,878 --> 01:02:08,918
Okay.

900
01:02:10,838 --> 01:02:11,862
And...

901
01:02:11,958 --> 01:02:15,261
They said that you have the worst
sperm that they've ever seen.

902
01:02:15,357 --> 01:02:19,117
- We can get a second opinion.
- I got five.

903
01:02:22,197 --> 01:02:27,421
So you were using this...
orgy as some sort of sperm bank?

904
01:02:27,516 --> 01:02:31,140
- That wasn't the original plan.
- You wanted to get pregnant, and then...

905
01:02:31,236 --> 01:02:33,540
trick me into raising
the child with you

906
01:02:33,636 --> 01:02:36,380
with complete disregard for the fact
the kid would look nothing like me.

907
01:02:36,476 --> 01:02:39,676
I have to be a mother, Adam. Okay? I
mean, I wouldn't have married you if I...

908
01:02:39,796 --> 01:02:45,076
- Please, go on.
- Honey, I'm just... I'm being emotional.

909
01:02:45,356 --> 01:02:49,236
I would hate for Heather
Mitchell to ever have an emotion.

910
01:02:49,916 --> 01:02:52,875
I had to learn to love you.

911
01:02:55,115 --> 01:02:58,515
- That came out wrong.
- Did it?

912
01:03:01,955 --> 01:03:03,795
Okay.

913
01:03:47,593 --> 01:03:49,513
You kept the tape?

914
01:03:50,633 --> 01:03:54,793
Just getting rid of the rest
of my old junk before I leave.

915
01:03:56,192 --> 01:03:57,537
So you're, you're going?

916
01:03:57,632 --> 01:04:00,136
Well, the whole town found out
my deepest, darkest, secret.

917
01:04:00,232 --> 01:04:02,672
So, yeah, I'm gonna go.

918
01:04:02,952 --> 01:04:04,936
Everybody has bad
days apparently.

919
01:04:05,032 --> 01:04:09,032
And mine's gonna get even worse until I
leave this shit-hole. So if you'll excuse me.

920
01:04:09,832 --> 01:04:12,415
What if you don't leave?

921
01:04:12,511 --> 01:04:14,615
Well, then I'll have to stay.

922
01:04:14,711 --> 01:04:18,016
And everybody knows
I'm a fraud and a virgin,

923
01:04:18,112 --> 01:04:21,935
and I can't look anybody
in the eye ever again.

924
01:04:22,031 --> 01:04:24,832
You're looking me in
the eye right now.

925
01:04:25,311 --> 01:04:28,111
You know, I'm pretty good at it.

926
01:04:32,631 --> 01:04:34,511
Look.

927
01:04:36,271 --> 01:04:37,975
Cassie, when you left
town the first time

928
01:04:38,071 --> 01:04:41,831
it was the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

929
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:45,054
I've never forgotten about you.
I think about you all the time.

930
01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:49,774
I mean, the only reason that I'm...
the only reason I married Heather is...

931
01:04:49,870 --> 01:04:53,094
You know, I get it, okay? I get it.
You had to do what you had to do.

932
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:55,694
You had to get out of town,
you had to leave us all behind.

933
01:04:55,790 --> 01:05:00,629
You had to just go do your own thing
and that's fine, okay? I forgive you.

934
01:05:02,829 --> 01:05:07,470
- You forgive me?
- Yeah. Yes, I forgive you.

935
01:05:08,549 --> 01:05:10,773
You forgive me?

936
01:05:10,869 --> 01:05:15,613
Do you have any idea why I didn't leave
town the second after that funeral?

937
01:05:15,709 --> 01:05:19,189
It's because I thought you and your idiot
friends would be good material for a book,

938
01:05:19,588 --> 01:05:21,573
but you're not.

939
01:05:21,668 --> 01:05:25,453
You're just a bunch of sad, boring,
bumpkins, who were born here,

940
01:05:25,549 --> 01:05:29,988
and will die here and
accomplish nothing in between.

941
01:05:36,268 --> 01:05:39,428
Does becoming a bitch
count as an accomplishment?

942
01:05:40,988 --> 01:05:45,227
- Please leave. I have packing to do.
- Yeah, I'm going thank you.

943
01:06:01,747 --> 01:06:03,706
- What's that for?
- It's for you.

944
01:06:03,986 --> 01:06:07,330
It's just weird. You've
never done that before. So...

945
01:06:07,426 --> 01:06:09,250
Yeah,
I thought it would be nice.

946
01:06:09,346 --> 01:06:12,491
Okay. You know you don't
owe me anything, right?

947
01:06:12,586 --> 01:06:17,146
That I'm not some, like, little
girl, whose feelings have been hurt?

948
01:06:18,186 --> 01:06:21,610
Relax, okay? It was...
it's just a muffin, okay?

949
01:06:21,706 --> 01:06:25,146
It's not even a good one. I
gave you the one that I dropped.

950
01:06:28,906 --> 01:06:31,386
I put my notice in.

951
01:06:31,825 --> 01:06:35,289
- What? What are you talking about?
- This town sucks, it's always sucked.

952
01:06:35,385 --> 01:06:40,089
So... I am out of here. I don't want
to become like my cousin Heather.

953
01:06:40,185 --> 01:06:43,665
You know, just settle for somebody
just because they're there.

954
01:06:44,024 --> 01:06:47,985
You should do the same.
Or not, I don't know.

955
01:06:49,384 --> 01:06:53,784
It's not really fair for me to
say it, I guess. You do you.

956
01:06:54,025 --> 01:06:56,968
All I know is that leaving here
scares the shit out of me,

957
01:06:57,064 --> 01:06:59,528
and if you're scared of
something, it's worth doing.

958
01:06:59,624 --> 01:07:02,144
So, I am gonna do that.

959
01:07:02,664 --> 01:07:05,384
Anyway, thank you for
the dropped muffin.

960
01:07:20,983 --> 01:07:23,623
Jay Macmaster and his wife
are gonna be delayed.

961
01:07:24,303 --> 01:07:27,743
- You're gonna have to get over this.
- I feel like there's a hole inside of me.

962
01:07:28,023 --> 01:07:32,167
Could I be perfectly frank
with you right now?

963
01:07:32,263 --> 01:07:35,486
- Of course.
- Stop being such a little bitch

964
01:07:35,582 --> 01:07:39,686
- and do what you want.
- I want to have the orgy.

965
01:07:39,782 --> 01:07:43,406
- So, have the orgy.
- I can't.

966
01:07:43,502 --> 01:07:46,126
Cassie kicked everyone out.

967
01:07:46,222 --> 01:07:49,301
So how does that stop you?

968
01:07:50,661 --> 01:07:52,806
If you have it,
though, I wanna come.

969
01:07:52,901 --> 01:07:54,766
No, you're not getting
the commission on my house.

970
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:58,941
That's fine. I'm making
a killing in this town.

971
01:07:59,101 --> 01:08:01,821
God, if I didn't want to be you,
I would hate you so much.

972
01:08:01,981 --> 01:08:06,261
- What was that?
- What? Nothing, I didn't... did you...

973
01:08:07,141 --> 01:08:08,741
Okay.

974
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:17,005
Jesus!

975
01:08:17,101 --> 01:08:20,044
- I want to rent my own apartment.
- I'm a bit busy right now, okay, Seth?

976
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:23,564
I have to move out now before my mom
gets back to town or she won't let me.

977
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:29,044
Whatever. But you're in that
house right now all by yourself?

978
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:31,724
Yeah, she gets back next week.

979
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:34,204
Do you want to have a party,
Seth?

980
01:08:34,299 --> 01:08:36,564
Why, so no one will show up?
No thanks.

981
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:39,283
No, no, people will show up.
I can promise you that.

982
01:08:39,379 --> 01:08:42,603
- Like, girls?
- Girls, totally. Tons of girls.

983
01:08:42,699 --> 01:08:45,643
- Do they like videogames?
- They love videogames. Anything you want.

984
01:08:45,739 --> 01:08:48,043
- Are they Japanese?
- Sure, yeah.

985
01:08:48,139 --> 01:08:50,323
Japanese girls, yeah, totally.
Chinese girls.

986
01:08:50,419 --> 01:08:52,402
- No.
- Okay.

987
01:08:52,498 --> 01:08:56,898
- No Chinese.
- Yeah, okay, no Chinese girls.

988
01:08:59,818 --> 01:09:01,659
Hey.

989
01:09:02,459 --> 01:09:06,218
- Bruce.
- So you still wanna do this thing?

990
01:09:07,178 --> 01:09:10,722
Great okay, cool. Maybe lose
the pajamas, get more cleavage.

991
01:09:10,818 --> 01:09:13,362
Like, sexy, cleavage.

992
01:09:13,458 --> 01:09:16,018
Like, right now.

993
01:09:17,578 --> 01:09:21,122
Hi, so I think we found a way
to keep the orgy going.

994
01:09:21,217 --> 01:09:23,497
I don't know.

995
01:09:24,578 --> 01:09:26,922
Vintage Vnyl, all sale's final.
This is Chester.

996
01:09:27,018 --> 01:09:30,321
It's back on.
Seth's place. Tonight.

997
01:09:30,417 --> 01:09:34,017
Ding-dong.
Ding... ding... I'll be there.

998
01:09:34,817 --> 01:09:38,241
- Good afternoon, Mayor.
- Nice to see you, Heather.

999
01:09:38,337 --> 01:09:41,577
So there's no delicate way to put this
so I'm just gonna come right out with it.

1000
01:09:41,776 --> 01:09:45,561
We're having an orgy this evening and
we could use some additional penises,

1001
01:09:45,657 --> 01:09:48,240
- if you would care to attend?
- Oh, absolutely.

1002
01:09:48,336 --> 01:09:50,680
Do you guys have
your own anal beads, or...

1003
01:09:50,776 --> 01:09:53,816
is this more of a
BYOAB kind of thing?

1004
01:10:04,736 --> 01:10:08,935
So, where shall we fornicate,
Bruce?

1005
01:10:15,015 --> 01:10:16,855
Yeah!

1006
01:10:30,054 --> 01:10:32,414
I'm going to regret that.

1007
01:10:47,413 --> 01:10:49,677
- Cocktail?
- No, no thanks.

1008
01:10:49,773 --> 01:10:51,614
Boys?

1009
01:10:56,613 --> 01:10:58,958
- There's my guy.
- Hey

1010
01:10:59,053 --> 01:11:02,037
Hey. I'm so glad that
you could make it.

1011
01:11:02,133 --> 01:11:05,597
- I'm really glad I could come.
- I'm even happier when you do.

1012
01:11:05,693 --> 01:11:08,893
- You okay? Got a little...
- Yeah, I'm good.

1013
01:11:09,693 --> 01:11:12,677
Why is my living room
like a whore dungeon?

1014
01:11:12,773 --> 01:11:16,132
What are you guys doing with my
mom's pashminas? She loves those.

1015
01:11:16,333 --> 01:11:19,492
- For the orgy.
- What orgy? This is a party.

1016
01:11:19,772 --> 01:11:22,396
Yeah, yeah, it's a party. It's
a party for your penis, bro.

1017
01:11:22,492 --> 01:11:26,972
I don't want a penis party for my
penis. I want a party party for me.

1018
01:11:29,852 --> 01:11:33,275
- Hey, where you going?
- I'm gonna go play some video games.

1019
01:11:33,371 --> 01:11:37,371
- Does anybody want to play with me?
- No, maybe later, man. Maybe later.

1020
01:11:53,410 --> 01:11:56,355
So, do you wanna go somewhere?

1021
01:11:56,450 --> 01:11:58,330
I...

1022
01:11:59,651 --> 01:12:02,474
It doesn't bother me at all
that you ejaculated quickly.

1023
01:12:02,570 --> 01:12:06,474
That is a sign of a man
who has his priorities straight.

1024
01:12:06,570 --> 01:12:09,514
But there is
something else that...

1025
01:12:09,610 --> 01:12:13,194
- Why don't you finish that drink?
- For you...

1026
01:12:13,290 --> 01:12:15,434
- Yeah?
- That might tickle your fantasy...

1027
01:12:15,530 --> 01:12:18,529
And there it is. Okay.

1028
01:12:19,209 --> 01:12:22,953
Polly, can I talk to you, please? I want you
to know that I think that you're kind of...

1029
01:12:23,049 --> 01:12:25,353
We're sort of in the middle
of something here, sport.

1030
01:12:25,449 --> 01:12:28,193
Yeah, give me a second,
okay, Spencer?

1031
01:12:28,289 --> 01:12:32,433
I just want you to know that I
think you're really beautiful.

1032
01:12:32,529 --> 01:12:35,529
And that I just...
I think you're fucking amazing.

1033
01:12:36,008 --> 01:12:38,689
I... I screwed up the
other night, okay?

1034
01:12:39,009 --> 01:12:41,872
It's fine. You know what, Chester,
it was... it really was nothing.

1035
01:12:41,968 --> 01:12:45,552
No. It's not fine.
Okay, and it wasn't nothing.

1036
01:12:45,648 --> 01:12:48,048
And you weren't bored.

1037
01:12:48,408 --> 01:12:51,328
This is worth doing.

1038
01:12:52,327 --> 01:12:54,927
Yeah? How do you know?

1039
01:12:55,808 --> 01:12:58,367
'Cause I'm scared shitless.

1040
01:13:01,447 --> 01:13:06,607
I declare this orgy
officially... begun! Yeah!

1041
01:13:12,407 --> 01:13:13,951
- Adam.
- Do you know where Cassie is?

1042
01:13:14,047 --> 01:13:16,790
- No.
- I think she left town.

1043
01:13:16,886 --> 01:13:19,831
- Without saying, goodbye?
- Wouldn't she?

1044
01:13:19,926 --> 01:13:21,791
Bitch.

1045
01:13:21,887 --> 01:13:23,670
Guess you don't want
to go to Seth's either?

1046
01:13:23,766 --> 01:13:26,606
- What at... What's at Seth's?
- What do you think?

1047
01:13:27,766 --> 01:13:30,950
Really? Heather was
the one that told me...

1048
01:13:31,046 --> 01:13:33,566
How do you not know about this?

1049
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:39,805
I want you inside
of me right now.

1050
01:13:42,645 --> 01:13:45,606
- Come here.
- Things are progressing nicely.

1051
01:13:47,605 --> 01:13:50,989
Oh, this is my cue.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1052
01:13:51,085 --> 01:13:55,549
What, yeah, take this off. Yeah,
just... yeah, yeah, whatever.

1053
01:13:55,645 --> 01:13:58,284
Yeah, now we're better.

1054
01:13:59,045 --> 01:14:00,965
Yeah.

1055
01:14:02,765 --> 01:14:05,748
Come on, guys. Come on,
let's ease up on the kissing.

1056
01:14:05,844 --> 01:14:09,109
Come on, guys, let's use our
mouths for the greater good here.

1057
01:14:09,205 --> 01:14:10,988
Bruce.

1058
01:14:11,084 --> 01:14:14,468
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
- Bruce!

1059
01:14:14,564 --> 01:14:16,829
What? What?
It's a goddamn fucking orgy.

1060
01:14:16,924 --> 01:14:18,988
If you've got a hole and you're
not using it you're being selfish.

1061
01:14:19,084 --> 01:14:21,188
- Clearly, they're having a moment.
- If they're having a fucking moment,

1062
01:14:21,284 --> 01:14:23,668
they should take this fucking
romantic moment to a room.

1063
01:14:23,764 --> 01:14:25,788
- Yeah, come on.
- Room. Room.

1064
01:14:25,883 --> 01:14:28,068
No, I didn't mean it. I didn't
actually... I was just just saying it!

1065
01:14:28,164 --> 01:14:32,043
I was just just saying it in the heat
of the moment. It wasn't sexy... fuck!

1066
01:14:40,483 --> 01:14:44,187
- Hello?
- Hey. You left without saying, "goodbye"?

1067
01:14:44,283 --> 01:14:47,867
- Fuck you, Judas.
- Are you kidding?

1068
01:14:47,962 --> 01:14:51,787
I saved you from losing
your virginity to fucking Bruce.

1069
01:14:51,883 --> 01:14:54,787
<i>You would really, really
want to hold that against me?</i>

1070
01:14:54,883 --> 01:14:58,507
I trusted you with that. You know how
hard it is for me to trust people?

1071
01:14:58,602 --> 01:15:02,666
Yeah, sorry. You should just get the
fuck over it. When did you leave?

1072
01:15:02,762 --> 01:15:05,385
- Just now.
- Okay, come back.

1073
01:15:05,481 --> 01:15:07,826
I can't. I'm on the lam.

1074
01:15:07,922 --> 01:15:11,425
The book people are gonna come after
me. My career's over, life's over...

1075
01:15:11,521 --> 01:15:15,106
- Why don't you just write a book?
- <i>Yeah, what am I supposed to write about?</i>

1076
01:15:15,202 --> 01:15:18,106
A virgin who plans an orgy
for a bunch of prudes?

1077
01:15:18,202 --> 01:15:22,681
And then out myself to the
entire world in the process?

1078
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:27,225
- That's not bad, actually.
- You said your career's over anyway,

1079
01:15:27,321 --> 01:15:32,360
so it saves you from having to remember
a bunch of bullshit lies all the time.

1080
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:34,960
These people don't want me here.

1081
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:39,104
- Adam just came looking for you.
- Yeah, I saw him last night.

1082
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:43,625
You did? So,
you know about him and Heather?

1083
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:45,960
What about him and Heather?

1084
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:54,719
Stop the orgy!

1085
01:16:11,879 --> 01:16:15,143
Heather? Do you have something
you want to say?

1086
01:16:15,239 --> 01:16:18,718
No. How nice of you to join us.

1087
01:16:19,598 --> 01:16:22,278
Are you gonna tell
them or should I?

1088
01:16:22,558 --> 01:16:25,718
- What's going on, here?
- My money's on gonorrhea.

1089
01:16:25,878 --> 01:16:27,982
Gentlemen, the...

1090
01:16:28,078 --> 01:16:31,942
the only reason that Heather
wants to sleep with you,

1091
01:16:32,038 --> 01:16:34,022
the only reason that this whole thing
is happening in the first place,

1092
01:16:34,118 --> 01:16:38,637
is because Heather Murray
is trying to get pregnant.

1093
01:16:39,037 --> 01:16:41,781
And she doesn't want your DNA
in the mix. Yeah, I get that.

1094
01:16:41,877 --> 01:16:44,021
No, not...
that's not what I'm saying.

1095
01:16:44,117 --> 01:16:47,461
First of all, I have dead sperm,
apparently, okay?

1096
01:16:47,557 --> 01:16:51,181
But point is, this whole thing
is based on a lie. All right?

1097
01:16:51,277 --> 01:16:54,421
And Cassie who we slut-shamed
out of town years ago,

1098
01:16:54,517 --> 01:16:57,140
now, she's leaving town again
because she's a virgin?

1099
01:16:57,236 --> 01:17:00,980
How does that make sense? And we're doing
this to prove that we're not prudes?

1100
01:17:01,076 --> 01:17:03,661
You know what?
I'm a prude, okay? I am.

1101
01:17:03,756 --> 01:17:07,060
I don't wanna have sex in front of anybody.
I want it to be me and one other person.

1102
01:17:07,156 --> 01:17:10,340
Nobody watching,
no toys, no lubes.

1103
01:17:10,436 --> 01:17:13,300
Just vanilla.
That's me, I'm vanilla.

1104
01:17:13,396 --> 01:17:16,780
As for the rest of you, I don't even know
how you could have sex in front of...

1105
01:17:16,876 --> 01:17:19,820
You know how much confidence it takes to
lay naked like that on somebody's couch?

1106
01:17:19,916 --> 01:17:21,900
- You ever been in this house before?
- Yeah, never.

1107
01:17:21,996 --> 01:17:26,460
And yet it's like he lives here.
Good for you. But you know what?

1108
01:17:26,556 --> 01:17:29,579
Be yourself, all right? Everybody
just be themselves and be honest.

1109
01:17:29,675 --> 01:17:34,379
Is this all true, Heather?
You want us to impregnate you?

1110
01:17:34,475 --> 01:17:37,115
Nobody ever has to know.

1111
01:17:37,915 --> 01:17:40,675
All I've ever wanted
was to be a mother.

1112
01:17:41,514 --> 01:17:44,018
And they say that it takes
a village to raise a child...

1113
01:17:44,114 --> 01:17:48,058
- I'm down with it
- Me too.

1114
01:17:48,154 --> 01:17:51,139
Would we have to help...
raise the kid?

1115
01:17:51,235 --> 01:17:53,818
No, I just need your sperm.

1116
01:17:53,914 --> 01:17:55,994
Don't care.

1117
01:17:56,634 --> 01:17:59,138
Do what you gotta do.

1118
01:17:59,234 --> 01:18:02,513
But I'm... I'm out.

1119
01:18:08,113 --> 01:18:09,417
- So, who's first?
- Me.

1120
01:18:09,513 --> 01:18:12,938
- How about you go third?
- What? Come on! Gus is gonna go before me?

1121
01:18:13,034 --> 01:18:14,617
You don't want to
have a Samoan baby.

1122
01:18:14,713 --> 01:18:18,057
How is it that no one
in this town knows what I am?

1123
01:18:18,153 --> 01:18:20,457
- I'm Indian.
- No, you're not.

1124
01:18:20,553 --> 01:18:22,617
Dot, not feather.

1125
01:18:22,713 --> 01:18:25,417
Actually, you people make
really beautiful mixed babies.

1126
01:18:25,513 --> 01:18:27,072
- I'm first.
- Okay.

1127
01:18:27,192 --> 01:18:30,096
Oh, okay. All right, yes.
Here we go, let's do this.

1128
01:18:30,192 --> 01:18:32,856
- Let's do this, here we go.
- What?

1129
01:18:32,952 --> 01:18:35,592
Nothing,
I thought you'd be smaller.

1130
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:10,950
How do you do that? Your tongue,
it's like an Olympic athlete.

1131
01:19:12,791 --> 01:19:16,030
I'm gonna give you
this ice cream on a cone.

1132
01:19:16,671 --> 01:19:18,974
And what flavor am I?

1133
01:19:19,070 --> 01:19:20,774
Tiger tale.

1134
01:19:20,870 --> 01:19:24,014
No, tiger tale is disgusting.

1135
01:19:24,110 --> 01:19:29,189
- Do my lady bits taste like black licorice?
- I love black licorice.

1136
01:19:54,629 --> 01:19:56,908
Oh, God.

1137
01:20:00,908 --> 01:20:02,988
Cassie.

1138
01:20:03,628 --> 01:20:07,908
Oh, my God,
I'm so glad you came back.

1139
01:20:08,948 --> 01:20:11,652
There's so much stuff I wanna say
about last night, I shouldn't have...

1140
01:20:11,748 --> 01:20:14,692
Okay. If you wanna talk first,
that's fine, too.

1141
01:20:14,788 --> 01:20:19,892
Fuck you. God, I've been wanting
to do that for so long.

1142
01:20:19,988 --> 01:20:22,571
I mean, if this is part of some
sort of big-city foreplay...

1143
01:20:22,667 --> 01:20:25,467
you're gonna have
to walk me through.

1144
01:20:41,146 --> 01:20:43,146
There's a musk.

1145
01:21:19,465 --> 01:21:22,569
- So, have you fucked anyone, yet?
- No.

1146
01:21:22,665 --> 01:21:24,609
Okay.

1147
01:21:24,705 --> 01:21:26,544
Well...

1148
01:21:27,304 --> 01:21:30,448
- where should we do this?
- Do what?

1149
01:21:30,544 --> 01:21:32,848
The sex. We're going to bang.

1150
01:21:32,944 --> 01:21:35,184
That's okay.

1151
01:21:37,984 --> 01:21:41,328
I'm offering you farm-fresh,

1152
01:21:41,424 --> 01:21:44,967
free range, grade A pussy here.

1153
01:21:45,063 --> 01:21:47,648
Yeah, you don't have to do that.
I'm fine.

1154
01:21:47,744 --> 01:21:50,847
Fine? What is all this?
What is this?

1155
01:21:50,943 --> 01:21:53,983
What's your deal?
Are you not attracted to me?

1156
01:21:58,423 --> 01:22:00,702
You're okay.

1157
01:22:03,223 --> 01:22:07,967
I'm sorry, what sort of bar are
we comparing me to, porn stars?

1158
01:22:08,063 --> 01:22:10,342
Mostly, yeah.

1159
01:22:11,182 --> 01:22:13,606
I hate to tell you this,
sweetie, but...

1160
01:22:13,702 --> 01:22:16,902
those women aren't
actually real.

1161
01:22:17,782 --> 01:22:20,301
What's so real about you?

1162
01:22:22,742 --> 01:22:24,766
That's it. It's on.

1163
01:22:24,862 --> 01:22:28,486
Oh, fuck. This is so nice.
This is just so nice.

1164
01:22:28,581 --> 01:22:31,165
I'm not gonna make it, I'm not
gonna make it. Not gonna make it.

1165
01:22:31,261 --> 01:22:34,805
- 218 X 4 million.
- What? I don't understand that.

1166
01:22:34,901 --> 01:22:37,901
- Just focus. Add.
- Focus on what?

1167
01:22:46,301 --> 01:22:50,364
You know what my dad used to say, life
gives you lemons, you make lemonade."

1168
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:52,645
Absolutely, bro.

1169
01:22:52,741 --> 01:22:55,140
A whole jug of it.

1170
01:22:56,020 --> 01:22:59,660
- So, that's that, then.
- Yeah, that's that.

1171
01:23:00,740 --> 01:23:03,740
That's... what's what?

1172
01:23:04,019 --> 01:23:06,659
Let's make some lemonade.

1173
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:11,260
Yeah, absolutely. Sure.

1174
01:23:11,979 --> 01:23:14,820
So, what... what's happening?

1175
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:19,979
If you got a hole,
and you're not using it...

1176
01:23:44,858 --> 01:23:48,922
- Does that hurt?
- The piercing, no.

1177
01:23:49,017 --> 01:23:50,561
It's good.

1178
01:23:50,657 --> 01:23:53,058
You sure it doesn't hurt?

1179
01:23:56,898 --> 01:24:00,417
- Can we just play video games now?
- Yeah, absolutely, we can.

1180
01:24:04,777 --> 01:24:07,057
How is it?

1181
01:24:09,177 --> 01:24:13,961
Well, the stinging has subsided,
so that's something.

1182
01:24:14,057 --> 01:24:16,137
I'm sorry.

1183
01:24:16,777 --> 01:24:19,656
I just really had to hurt you.

1184
01:24:20,616 --> 01:24:23,456
Well, mission accomplished.

1185
01:24:25,336 --> 01:24:29,455
Do you know why I was afraid
to come back here?

1186
01:24:31,536 --> 01:24:34,935
Because I didn't want
to see you happy.

1187
01:24:37,575 --> 01:24:40,656
Well, you sure fixed
your wish with that one.

1188
01:24:43,615 --> 01:24:46,815
What about you? Are you happy?

1189
01:24:48,455 --> 01:24:50,455
I'm tired.

1190
01:24:51,815 --> 01:24:55,855
All that stuff I said last night
about forgiving you, that was shitty.

1191
01:24:57,014 --> 01:24:59,439
It's not your fault that I married
Heather, or I stayed in town,

1192
01:24:59,534 --> 01:25:02,055
it's got nothing to do with you.

1193
01:25:05,215 --> 01:25:08,774
I'm the reason that nothing
happened between us.

1194
01:25:11,014 --> 01:25:14,573
I guess I should be
asking you for forgiveness.

1195
01:25:15,374 --> 01:25:17,254
So...

1196
01:25:18,054 --> 01:25:20,053
I'm sorry.

1197
01:25:21,173 --> 01:25:23,358
That's what I was
gonna say before you...

1198
01:25:23,454 --> 01:25:27,613
slapped me in the face and kneed
me in the balls. I'm sorry.

1199
01:25:28,013 --> 01:25:31,813
For... all of it.

1200
01:25:35,093 --> 01:25:37,453
How's your balls?

1201
01:25:38,333 --> 01:25:43,797
Still intact, I guess. It's not like
I'm gonna be using them for anything.

1202
01:25:43,893 --> 01:25:45,732
Ever.

1203
01:25:47,772 --> 01:25:49,972
Can I see?

1204
01:25:50,772 --> 01:25:53,572
It's not really my best feature.

1205
01:25:58,492 --> 01:26:03,212
You know, it doesn't feel
that useless to me.

1206
01:26:05,372 --> 01:26:07,476
Cassie, I...

1207
01:26:07,571 --> 01:26:08,931
Yeah?

1208
01:26:33,610 --> 01:26:34,594
Did you get some lube?

1209
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:38,234
- All I could find was some apple butter.
- Yeah, sure, fine. Fuck it. Whatever.

1210
01:26:38,330 --> 01:26:40,713
- We don't have to do this.
- No, we're gonna do this, come on.

1211
01:26:40,809 --> 01:26:42,674
- Let's just do this, all right?
- Yup. Here we go.

1212
01:26:42,770 --> 01:26:46,034
- Hey, what are you doing there, Captain?
- You need to be erect.

1213
01:26:46,130 --> 01:26:49,113
I can get myself erect,
thank you very much.

1214
01:26:49,209 --> 01:26:51,234
- Be my guest.
- Yeah, watch this.

1215
01:26:51,330 --> 01:26:54,169
- Geez.
- Oh, look at that.

1216
01:26:55,369 --> 01:26:58,449
Oh, fuck. Auschwitz.

1217
01:26:58,729 --> 01:27:02,529
Dachau, Dachau.
Bergen-belsen. Terezin.

1218
01:27:02,969 --> 01:27:06,433
- Wait, what? What are you saying? What?
- Those are concentration camps.

1219
01:27:06,529 --> 01:27:08,808
From the holocaust.

1220
01:27:09,528 --> 01:27:12,272
Why? Is that too dark? Too much?

1221
01:27:12,368 --> 01:27:14,488
- Yeah, it's a little much.
- Okay.

1222
01:27:18,369 --> 01:27:22,632
What is the appeal, here? You just
die and then you do it all over again.

1223
01:27:22,728 --> 01:27:25,128
Yeah.
That's what I like about it.

1224
01:27:25,368 --> 01:27:29,391
When Mario dies, he doesn't rage
against the world, he just...

1225
01:27:29,487 --> 01:27:32,352
picks himself up, goes back
to the start and tries again,

1226
01:27:32,448 --> 01:27:35,607
until he figures out
how to save the princess.

1227
01:27:41,927 --> 01:27:43,767
Seth?

1228
01:27:45,287 --> 01:27:49,711
What's your plan? I mean, you can't
really just stay in your mother's basement

1229
01:27:49,806 --> 01:27:52,911
and play video games
for the rest of your life.

1230
01:27:53,007 --> 01:27:56,231
What other life am I gonna have?
I'm the town loser.

1231
01:27:56,327 --> 01:27:59,446
Well, to the town, yeah.

1232
01:27:59,726 --> 01:28:02,230
But who are you to you?

1233
01:28:02,326 --> 01:28:05,086
I mean,
they all see Clark Kent but...

1234
01:28:05,366 --> 01:28:08,806
I'm pretty sure there's a Kal-El
hiding in there somewhere.

1235
01:28:11,445 --> 01:28:14,166
I'm ready to have
sex with you now.

1236
01:28:18,845 --> 01:28:22,749
- It's not so squishy this time.
- Yeah.

1237
01:28:22,845 --> 01:28:25,549
- Adam?
- Yes?

1238
01:28:25,645 --> 01:28:28,085
Adam Mitchell?

1239
01:28:30,685 --> 01:28:33,404
I think of you fondly.

1240
01:28:35,764 --> 01:28:39,805
I am...
quite fond of you as well.

1241
01:28:42,444 --> 01:28:45,349
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

1242
01:28:45,445 --> 01:28:48,804
- Oh, thank you.
- Don't mention it.

1243
01:28:49,684 --> 01:28:51,564
Okay.

1244
01:28:52,684 --> 01:28:55,124
Okay, you just...

1245
01:28:55,883 --> 01:28:58,988
- You're over thinking it. Just do it.
- I just don't want to hurt you.

1246
01:28:59,083 --> 01:29:01,427
You won't.
Stop being such a fucking pussy.

1247
01:29:01,523 --> 01:29:05,803
Look, this is new for me. All right, I
gotta need some positive reinforcement.

1248
01:29:07,563 --> 01:29:13,307
Look, I'm sorry. Would you please fuck
my bum with your beautiful, manly penis?

1249
01:29:13,403 --> 01:29:17,043
- Okay. Okay.
- Good. All right. Okay, here we go.

1250
01:29:20,363 --> 01:29:22,642
There you go.

1251
01:29:29,242 --> 01:29:31,122
Okay.

1252
01:29:34,602 --> 01:29:36,546
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

1253
01:29:36,642 --> 01:29:38,226
- Fuck!
- Oh, shit!

1254
01:29:38,322 --> 01:29:40,746
- Keep going, Chester. Chester, keep going.
- I'm going to go.

1255
01:29:40,842 --> 01:29:43,041
Keep going!

1256
01:29:48,441 --> 01:29:51,225
- Thank you.
- Over here.

1257
01:29:51,321 --> 01:29:54,361
Fill me with baby juice. Do it!

1258
01:30:08,921 --> 01:30:11,104
- Do you wanna flip around or something?
- What?

1259
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:13,864
Where we can't look at each other,
just to be fun, just to switch it up.

1260
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:16,104
- No, no, no. This is perfect.
- Okay.

1261
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:19,904
- Just like that. Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

1262
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,064
- Yeah.
- What are you doing? Adam?

1263
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:26,104
Hey. Look at me.

1264
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:30,743
Everybody looks weird when they
come. Just look weird with me. Okay?

1265
01:30:30,839 --> 01:30:32,719
Okay.

1266
01:31:33,957 --> 01:31:37,356
- Chester?
- Yeah?

1267
01:31:38,596 --> 01:31:41,676
Please don't put your penis
inside of anybody else.

1268
01:31:42,036 --> 01:31:44,780
- Can we play video games now?
- Yeah, let's play video games now.

1269
01:31:44,876 --> 01:31:46,756
Okay.

1270
01:31:54,636 --> 01:31:56,436
That...

1271
01:31:56,996 --> 01:31:59,780
That went a lot better
then in high school.

1272
01:31:59,876 --> 01:32:01,755
Yeah.

1273
01:32:03,115 --> 01:32:06,955
And nobody had to run down the
street without any clothes on.

1274
01:32:07,675 --> 01:32:08,954
Yeah.

1275
01:32:10,594 --> 01:32:12,835
It's okay.

1276
01:32:13,395 --> 01:32:15,595
I'm over it.

1277
01:32:24,474 --> 01:32:26,314
Adam?

1278
01:32:33,434 --> 01:32:36,833
Adam! Everyone can see you.

1279
01:32:38,514 --> 01:32:43,433
- What are you doing?
- Something I should've done 12 years ago.

1280
01:33:32,030 --> 01:33:35,591
- Come on.
- It's so cold.

1281
01:33:35,870 --> 01:33:38,022
Fucking white people.

1282
01:33:41,471 --> 01:33:44,751
Hey, you, wait up.
