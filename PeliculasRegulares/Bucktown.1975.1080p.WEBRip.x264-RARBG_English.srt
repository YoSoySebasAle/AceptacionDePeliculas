1
00:00:41,567 --> 00:00:43,067
- HEY, CLETE AND SAM.

2
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,467
- COME OVER HERE.

3
00:01:01,467 --> 00:01:03,167
- SAM, SAM.

4
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:04,500
- THIS IS SAM.

5
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,933
- A NIGGER HOTSHOT DONE
RIPPED OFF YOUR POKER PALACE.

6
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:08,633
- SON OF A BITCH.

7
00:02:29,867 --> 00:02:32,900
- OH, YEAH.

8
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,567
YOU KNOW, BOY, CRIME
JUST DON'T PAY IN BUCKTOWN.

9
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:38,433
- HEY, CLETE,
YOU SURE DO ENJOY YOUR WORK.

10
00:02:38,433 --> 00:02:39,433
- YEAH, YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

11
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:40,667
[chuckles]

12
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,233
- HEY, YOU KNOW,
THIS IS A REAL BAD CAT.

13
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:51,733
HE ALMOST KILLED
A COUPLE OF HIGH ROLLERS.

14
00:02:51,733 --> 00:02:53,400
YOU GONNA BE IN TOWN LONG?

15
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,500
- WHY?
YOU THE WELCOMING COMMITTEE?

16
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,667
- HEY, WELL, YOU HAVE
A GOOD TIME WHILE YOU'RE HERE.

17
00:03:00,767 --> 00:03:02,800
- BETTER GET HIS ASS
TO THE HOSPITAL.

18
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:15,967
- YOU KNOW
WHERE THE CLUB ALABAM IS?

19
00:03:15,967 --> 00:03:17,067
- YEAH.

20
00:03:17,067 --> 00:03:21,567
SON, DO YOU BELIEVE IN GOD?

21
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:22,900
- YEAH, SURE.
WHY NOT?

22
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,533
- THEN YOU'RE IN
THE WRONG PLACE.

23
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:27,900
[laughs]

24
00:04:04,567 --> 00:04:06,067
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
IT WAS CLOSED?

25
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:07,900
- YOU DIDN'T ASK, DID YOU?

26
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,233
THE PLACE BEEN CLOSED
SINCE BEN DIED.

27
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:13,900
- WHERE CAN I FIND A GOOD HOTEL?

28
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,900
- WE AIN'T GOT ONE.

29
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,667
- WELL, HOW ABOUT ONE
THAT CHANGES SHEETS

30
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:19,100
AT LEAST EVERY OTHER NIGHT?

31
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,200
- HMM.

32
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,567
THAT WOULD BE THE OLD DIXIE.

33
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:23,233
IT'S JUST
A COUPLE OF BLOCKS DOWN.

34
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:24,233
I'LL TAKE YA.

35
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:25,333
- NO, THANK YOU.

36
00:04:29,767 --> 00:04:30,700
I'LL WALK.

37
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:35,900
- BABY, IS THAT REALLY ALL YOU?

38
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,400
- SWEETIE,
WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET.

39
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,633
[laughs]

40
00:04:39,633 --> 00:04:42,900
BUT FIRST, I WANT TO SEE
THE COLOR OF YOUR GREEN.

41
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,067
AND THEN I'LL SHOW BOTH OF YOU
A TIME YOU'LL NEVER FORGET.

42
00:04:46,067 --> 00:04:47,233
[laughs]

43
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:49,233
- I'LL HELP YOU WITH THAT,
MISTER.

44
00:04:49,233 --> 00:04:50,400
NO CHARGE.

45
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,733
I'M GLAD TO HELP.

46
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:53,900
BUT IF YOU WANT TO TIP ME
A HALF A BUCK,

47
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,900
I'LL TELL YOU
WHERE TO GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER

48
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,067
AND WHERE TO GET IT ON.

49
00:04:58,067 --> 00:04:59,300
- OH, YEAH?
GET WHAT ON?

50
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,567
- YOU NAME IT, I GOT IT.

51
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:03,900
- NAH.
NO, THANKS.

52
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,733
- OKAY, HOW ABOUT CARDS?

53
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:09,233
IF YOU GO TO DOC ANDERSON'S,
CHECK THE DEUCES AND NINES.

54
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:12,067
THEY'RE MARKED.

55
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:13,700
- LITTLE MAN,
I AIN'T INTERESTED.

56
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,500
- OKAY, WOMEN.

57
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,067
THE BEST IN TOWN IS SONORA
OVER AT RUBY'S.

58
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,633
BUT DON'T LET HER GET ON TOP,

59
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:21,367
'CAUSE SHE'LL
BUCK YOUR BRAINS OUT.

60
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:23,567
- WHERE'D YOU GET ALL THIS
INFORMATION FROM ANYWAY, HUH?

61
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:24,900
YOU SELL PENICILLIN TOO?

62
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,067
- THANKS, MAN.

63
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:27,233
SEE ARNETTA.

64
00:05:27,233 --> 00:05:29,400
SHE'LL GET YOU
THE BEST ROOM IN THE HOUSE.

65
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,567
BUT BE SURE AND TELL HER
STEVIE SENT YA.

66
00:05:31,567 --> 00:05:33,867
- IS THAT YOURS?

67
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:35,167
- YEAH, WHY?

68
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:36,833
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE THE ONLY PIMP
I EVER SEEN

69
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,400
THAT DRIVES A MOTOR BIKE.

70
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,733
- HEY.

71
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:41,733
I AIN'T NO PIMP.

72
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:45,333
I'M WALT DISNEY,
AND THIS IS DISNEYLAND.

73
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,400
- OOH.

74
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,400
- GOT A ROOM?

75
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,733
- HOW MANY NIGHTS, HONEY?

76
00:06:21,733 --> 00:06:22,867
- JUST ONE.

77
00:06:22,867 --> 00:06:28,833
- THAT'LL BE $15 IN ADVANCE.

78
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:32,233
IT'S ROOM 204,
AND YOU CAN TAKE THE STAIRS.

79
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:34,067
IT'S A LITTLE BIT QUICKER.

80
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:35,167
- THANK YOU.

81
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,067
- SAY, BABY, YOU KNOW,
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED,

82
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:44,733
I COULD TURN YOU ON
TO A WHOLE LOTTA FUN.

83
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:46,567
- NO, THANKS.

84
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:48,100
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT AIN'T MY BUSINESS,

85
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,667
BUT WHAT'S A FINE BLACK THING
LIKE YOU DOING IN TOWN?

86
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:53,400
- I'M JUST HERE
TO BURY MY BROTHER.

87
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,900
THAT'S ALL.

88
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,167
- OOH.

89
00:07:05,933 --> 00:07:06,933
- YEAH?

90
00:07:06,933 --> 00:07:08,233
- A FELLA JUST CHECKED IN

91
00:07:08,233 --> 00:07:11,633
BY THE NAME OF JOHNSON,
DUKE JOHNSON.

92
00:07:11,633 --> 00:07:12,900
- DID HE SAY ANYTHING?

93
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,167
- NO, HE DIDN'T TALK TOO MUCH,

94
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,567
BUT HE SAID HE'S HERE
FOR BEN'S FUNERAL.

95
00:07:16,567 --> 00:07:17,833
- I'M GLAD YOU CALLED, ARNETTA.

96
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,400
- WELL, YOU TOLD ME
TO CHECK WITH YOU NOW.

97
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,400
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.

98
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,333
- GOOD NIGHT.
- YEAH.

99
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,500
- YOUR DINNER'S READY,
CHIEF PATTERSON.

100
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:38,900
- ALMIGHTY GOD IN HEAVEN ABOVE,

101
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,367
I THANK THEE
FOR WHAT YOU'VE SET BEFORE ME.

102
00:07:41,367 --> 00:07:42,600
AND I GIVE--

103
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,067
- UNTO YOU, O LORD,
THE SOUL OF THIS GOOD MAN.

104
00:07:46,067 --> 00:07:48,467
THIS HUMBLE MAN, BEN JOHNSON.

105
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:50,900
A MAN OF THE PEOPLE,
ALL PEOPLES,

106
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,067
WHO ALWAYS HELD HIS HAND OUT
TO HELP OTHERS.

107
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:57,300
WHO GAVE LIKE YOU,
AND ASKED NOT IN RETURN.

108
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,733
THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD.

109
00:07:58,733 --> 00:08:00,133
I SHALL NOT WANT.

110
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:03,133
HE MAKETH ME TO LIE DOWN
IN GREEN PASTURES.

111
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:04,967
HE RESTORETH MY SOUL.

112
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:06,967
SO WE KNOW, ALMIGHTY GOD,

113
00:08:06,967 --> 00:08:10,533
THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO LOVE
BEN AS WE HAVE LOVED HIM.

114
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:14,300
TO EMBRACE HIM, TO TAKE HIM
INTO YOUR KINGDOM THIS DAY.

115
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,667
AMEN.

116
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:19,167
IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER,
THE SON, AND THE HOLY GHOST.

117
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,533
- THOSE ARE GOOD WORDS,
REVEREND.

118
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:33,533
- THANK YOU.

119
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:37,167

120
00:08:37,167 --> 00:08:40,067
- EXCUSE ME, SIR.

121
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:41,400
I'M WALDO HARLEY.

122
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,500
MIGHT YOU BE A FRIEND
OF OUR BELOVED BEN THERE?

123
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,633
- YEAH, I'M DUKE JOHNSON.

124
00:08:46,633 --> 00:08:48,400
- DUKE.

125
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,867
THAT'S JUST WHAT I FIGURED.

126
00:08:49,867 --> 00:08:51,067
ARETHA.

127
00:08:51,067 --> 00:08:53,467
ARETHA, YOU AND STEVIE
SAY HELLO TO THE DUKE.

128
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:55,233
THAT'S BEN'S BROTHER.

129
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:56,567
- YOU REALLY DUKE?

130
00:08:56,567 --> 00:08:58,233
- BEN TOLD US ALL ABOUT YA.

131
00:08:58,233 --> 00:09:00,400
SAID YOU'RE THE SMARTEST ONE
IN THE FAMILY.

132
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,367
YOU KNOW, HOW YOU'VE BEEN ALL
OVER THE WORLD AND EVERYTHING.

133
00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:07,300
- SO YOU'RE THE ONE.

134
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,067
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW BEN?

135
00:09:10,067 --> 00:09:11,400
FIVE YEARS AGO?

136
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,733
- NO, IT WAS MORE LIKE SIX.

137
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:15,067
- SOME HOTSHOT BROTHER.

138
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:16,233
- ARETHA, PLEASE.

139
00:09:16,233 --> 00:09:18,133
- WHERE WERE YOU
WHEN HE NEEDED YOUR HELP?

140
00:09:18,133 --> 00:09:19,300
- WHAT KINDA HELP?

141
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,233
- THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT NOW,

142
00:09:21,233 --> 00:09:23,333
EXCEPT FOR TO FIND THE TIME
TO COME TO BURY HIM

143
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,067
AND COLLECT HIS STUFF
AND SPLIT.

144
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:26,067
- ARETHA, NOW--

145
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:27,567
- AREN'T YOU GONNA STAY?

146
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,267
- NO, HE'S NOT GONNA STAY.

147
00:09:29,267 --> 00:09:32,133
HE WOULDN'T DIRTY THAT SHOESHINE
IN THIS COW PASTURE,

148
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:34,400
WOULD YOU, MR. DUKE JOHNSON?

149
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,967
- ARETHA, PLEASE.

150
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:40,233
DON'T MIND HER, DUKE.

151
00:09:40,233 --> 00:09:41,900
BEN WAS GOOD TO HER.

152
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,100
HIS DYING KINDA PUT A PAIN
AND GRIEF INTO HER.

153
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,900
DON'T MIND HER.

154
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,067
- NO.

155
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:52,400
I CAN'T MIND A LADY
THAT SPEAKS HER MIND.

156
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,633
- THAT'S RIGHT, DUKE.

157
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:56,500
DUKE, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

158
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:09,467
- AND ACCORDING TO THIS WILL,
LEFT EVERYTHING TO YOU.

159
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:14,233
AN ESTATE CONSISTING MAINLY
OF A LOT AND FRAME HOUSE,

160
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:18,300
A HAND-TOOLED LEATHER WALLET
CONTAINING $39.43,

161
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,067
AND A SAVINGS ACCOUNT PASSBOOK

162
00:10:21,067 --> 00:10:25,733
IN THE NAME
OF BENJAMIN A. JOHNSON.

163
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:28,367
- OKAY, ALL OF BEN'S THINGS
BELONG TO ME NOW, RIGHT?

164
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:31,067
TO SELL, USE,
ANYTHING I WANT, RIGHT?

165
00:10:31,067 --> 00:10:32,933
- IN ABOUT 60 DAYS.

166
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:35,567
- 60 DAYS?

167
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:36,900
MAN, YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING.

168
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,567
- THAT'S THE STATE LAW.

169
00:10:38,567 --> 00:10:40,300
TAKES THAT LONG
TO CLOSE AN ESTATE.

170
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,567
- WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

171
00:10:42,567 --> 00:10:44,333
STICK AROUND THIS RAT TRAP
FOR TWO MONTHS?

172
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:47,233
- OF COURSE,
WE COULD RELAX THE RULES A BIT,

173
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:50,067
ALLOW YOU THE USE
OF YOUR BROTHER'S PROPERTIES.

174
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:53,067
- HUH.

175
00:10:53,067 --> 00:10:55,567
HOW MUCH?

176
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:57,400
- LET'S SAY YOU SIGN FOR

177
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,367
AN EMPTY HAND-TOOLED
LEATHER WALLET.

178
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:03,333
- YOU RUN A NICE BUSINESS
AROUND HERE, DON'T YA?

179
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,233
- HI, DUKE.

180
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:12,233
I'VE BEEN OVER THERE
WAITING FOR YA.

181
00:11:12,233 --> 00:11:14,233
TOLD STEVIE HERE ALL ABOUT IT.

182
00:11:14,233 --> 00:11:15,767
- YEAH, ABOUT WHAT?

183
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:18,733
- OH, HOW YOU'RE GONNA STAY ON,
OPEN THE CLUB AND EVERYTHING.

184
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:22,067
MAN, I CAN'T WAIT FOR THEM GOOD
TIMES TO START ROLLING AGAIN.

185
00:11:22,067 --> 00:11:24,333
THE PLACE WAS REALLY LIKE A HOME
TO SOME OF US, YOU KNOW.

186
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:27,133
ESPECIALLY STEVIE HERE
'CAUSE HE LIVES IN THE BACK.

187
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:30,233
YOUR BROTHER BEN MADE
A RIGHT SMART LIVING FROM IT.

188
00:11:30,233 --> 00:11:31,933
GONNA DO THE SAME THING FOR YOU,
DUKE.

189
00:11:31,933 --> 00:11:34,567
- I FIGURE LIFE OWES ME MORE
THAN JUST A LIVING.

190
00:11:34,567 --> 00:11:36,933
ALL I WANT FROM THAT BAR
IS FOR SOMEBODY TO BUY IT.

191
00:11:36,933 --> 00:11:40,367
LOOK, I'M GONNA BE STUCK HERE
FOR TWO MONTHS.

192
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,067
YOU REALLY WANT TO HELP ME?

193
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:44,067
- SURE, DUKE.

194
00:11:44,067 --> 00:11:46,833
- THEN YOU FIND ME THAT BUYER
FOR THE CLUB ALABAM

195
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,333
SO I CAN GET THE HELL
OUT OF HERE.

196
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,833
OKAY?

197
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,733
- SURE, DUKE.

198
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:54,067
- YOU TAKE CARE.

199
00:12:04,067 --> 00:12:07,567
- MR. DUKE, MR. DUKE, SIR,

200
00:12:07,567 --> 00:12:09,567
IS IT ALL RIGHT
IF WE WALK A PIECE WITH YA?

201
00:12:09,567 --> 00:12:12,900
- WE THOUGHT YOU WERE COOL,
A WISE DUDE LIKE YOU.

202
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,733
SHOWS HOW WRONG WE CAN BE.

203
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:17,867
- STEVIE,
YOU SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.

204
00:12:17,867 --> 00:12:19,067
- SOMETHIN' BOTHERING YOU TWO?

205
00:12:19,067 --> 00:12:20,233
- OH, NO, DUKE.

206
00:12:20,233 --> 00:12:21,867
EVERYTHING IS EXPOOBIDENT,

207
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:24,400
EXCEPT THAT IT'S GONNA BE
A LITTLE HARD

208
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,967
TO FIND A BUYER FOR THE CLUB

209
00:12:25,967 --> 00:12:27,467
WITH THAT CLOSED SIGN
ON THE DOOR.

210
00:12:27,467 --> 00:12:28,900
- THAT'S THE WAY IT IS, BRO.

211
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,100
- BUT IT DON'T HAVE TO BE.

212
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,233
- REALLY, DUKE,
IF THE JOINT WAS OPEN,

213
00:12:32,233 --> 00:12:33,367
PEOPLE WOULD BE HAVING FUN

214
00:12:33,367 --> 00:12:35,233
AND PARTYING REAL GOOD
AND CATCHING GOOD.

215
00:12:35,233 --> 00:12:37,400
SOMEONE WILL COME IN THERE THEN,
WANT TO BUY THE JOINT.

216
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,067
AND YOU KNOW
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET DOWN

217
00:12:39,067 --> 00:12:40,067
WITH SOME HEAVY BREAD.

218
00:12:40,067 --> 00:12:41,500
- YOU COULD BE PLAYING
SWEET MUSIC

219
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,767
ON THE CASH REGISTER.

220
00:12:42,767 --> 00:12:45,833
- YOU GUYS ARE DREAMIN', MAN.

221
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,733
- HEY, DUKE, WHY DO YOU THINK
THOSE TOURIST DUDES

222
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49,300
COME OVER HERE
FROM ACROSS THE RIVER?

223
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,900
IT'S 'CAUSE THEY KNOW THEY CAN
SWING TILL BROAD DAYLIGHT.

224
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,233
SHOOT!

225
00:12:53,233 --> 00:12:54,867
GET FOUR OR FIVE TIMES
WHAT YOU'RE ASKING

226
00:12:54,867 --> 00:12:56,200
IF THE CLUB WAS OPEN.

227
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,600
- AND DON'T FORGET
ALL THOSE ARMY RESERVERS

228
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,833
OVER AT THE ARMORY.

229
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,467
ONE NIGHT A WEEK,
AFTER MARCHING AND DRILLING,

230
00:13:01,467 --> 00:13:03,400
THEY'RE HOT
AND THEY'RE THIRSTY.

231
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,467
AND WHERE DO THEY HEAD FOR?

232
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:10,233
THE CLUB ALABAM
FOR SOME RELAXATION.

233
00:13:10,233 --> 00:13:12,567
- RELAXATION, HUH?

234
00:13:12,567 --> 00:13:14,233
YOU KNOW SOMETHIN', LITTLE MAN?

235
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:16,067
YOU REMIND ME OF ME
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,

236
00:13:16,067 --> 00:13:17,400
TRYING TO BE SOMEBODY,

237
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,900
ALWAYS JIVING AND HUSTLING.

238
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,567
- I AIN'T HUSTLING.

239
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:25,567
I'M JUST TRYING TO GROW UP FAST
IN A FAST TOWN.

240
00:13:25,567 --> 00:13:29,067
- AND ME, I AIN'T NOTHIN' BUT
AN OLD FOOTBALL PLAYER, DUKE.

241
00:13:29,067 --> 00:13:31,400
MAYBE DRINK TOO
MUCH EVERY NOW AND THEN.

242
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,900
BUT IF YOU OPEN THAT CLUB,

243
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,700
IT SURE WOULD MAKE ME FEEL LIKE
I WAS SOMEBODY.

244
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,300
- OPENING THE CLUB CAN'T HURT,
CAN IT?

245
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,233
- YOU SAID YOURSELF
YOU'RE STUCK HERE,

246
00:13:41,233 --> 00:13:43,200
SO YOU AIN'T GOT NOTHING
TO LOSE, DO YA?

247
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,133
- DO YA?

248
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,733
- I AIN'T SOME DUMB BROAD.

249
00:13:51,733 --> 00:13:53,067
I GOT RIGHTS.

250
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:55,733
- HONEY, WE TOLD YOU BEFORE
DON'T RIP OFF THE MARKS.

251
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:57,233
IT'S BAD FOR BUSINESS.

252
00:13:57,233 --> 00:13:59,867
- MERLE, IT AIN'T FAIR
YOU MAKING ME SPEND TIME

253
00:13:59,867 --> 00:14:01,300
IN THIS GODDAMN HOLE.

254
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,300
- WE GOT TO THINK OF
BUCKTOWN'S REPUTATION, HONEY.

255
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,533
YOU KEEP CLIPPING THE TOURISTS,

256
00:14:04,533 --> 00:14:05,533
AND PRETTY SOON NONE OF 'EM

257
00:14:05,533 --> 00:14:07,100
WILL BE COMING ACROSS THE RIVER
NO MORE.

258
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,833
- BUT THAT FREAKY BASTARD
WANTED TO WEAR MY UNDERWEAR.

259
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,400
- THIS PLACE GOT A CHIEF?

260
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,900
- YOU GOT AN APPOINTMENT?

261
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,400
- NO.

262
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,400
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, BOY?

263
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,733
SOMEBODY PICK YOUR POCKET?

264
00:14:25,733 --> 00:14:28,967
- I'M HERE ABOUT THE CLOSED SIGN
ON THE CLUB ALABAM.

265
00:14:28,967 --> 00:14:31,133
- OH, YOU MUST BE BEN'S BROTHER.

266
00:14:31,133 --> 00:14:32,667
- EVERYBODY LIKED BEN.

267
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:34,733
HE WAS REAL PEOPLE,
WASN'T HE, MERLE?

268
00:14:34,733 --> 00:14:35,900
- SURE WAS.

269
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,967
GOOD CITIZEN BEN.

270
00:14:37,967 --> 00:14:40,900
- WELL, THAT'S MIGHTY NICE
OF YOU FELLAS TO SAY THAT.

271
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,800
WHAT ABOUT THAT CLOSED SIGN?

272
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,233
- NO PROBLEM.

273
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:46,900
ALL YOU GOT TO DO
IS TAKE OUT A CITY LICENSE.

274
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,133
- THAT'S RIGHT.

275
00:14:48,133 --> 00:14:50,733
- HOW MUCH IS THAT?

276
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:53,067
- HOW MUCH WAS THAT, MERLE,
FOR A CITY STICKER?

277
00:14:53,067 --> 00:14:55,400
- IT WAS $400, WASN'T IT?

278
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,233
- MORE LIKE $450,
I THOUGHT.

279
00:14:57,233 --> 00:14:59,767
- DAMNED IF YOU'RE NOT RIGHT.

280
00:14:59,767 --> 00:15:01,633
- I'LL MAKE SURE
THEY GET YOUR MESSAGE.

281
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:02,733
- DO THAT, DUANE.

282
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:03,967
YOU JUST DO THAT.

283
00:15:03,967 --> 00:15:06,067
- YOU THE MAIN MAN?

284
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:07,733
- YEAH.

285
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:09,567
- NOW, JUST A DAMN MINUTE.

286
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,733
- YOU'RE THE ONE
I WANT TO TALK TO.

287
00:15:11,733 --> 00:15:13,900
- DUKE JOHNSON?

288
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,567
- YEAH.

289
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:17,067
- COME IN.

290
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,400
YOU'RE NOT MUCH FOR MANNERS,
ARE YA?

291
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,567
- I GIVE WHAT I GET.

292
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:35,567
- THIS WHAT YOU WANT?

293
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:39,733
HOWEVER, NOTHING IS FOR NOTHING.

294
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:42,567
- I GUESS THOSE TWO CRACKERS OUT
FRONT WERE SERIOUS, HUH?

295
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:43,700
- SAM.

296
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,900
- YES, SIR.

297
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,733
- WHAT'S THE CHARGE
FOR A CITY STICKER?

298
00:15:47,733 --> 00:15:50,733
- $450 GOOD OLD AMERICAN GREEN.

299
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:52,667
- NOT ONE DROP IS POURED
IN THIS TOWN,

300
00:15:52,667 --> 00:15:54,333
UNLESS EACH BOTTLE
HAS A CITY STICKER.

301
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,733
AND THE STICKER COMES
FROM THIS OFFICE.

302
00:15:56,733 --> 00:16:00,267
NOW, BEN'S RENEWAL FEE
WAS DUE TWO DAYS AFTER HE DIED.

303
00:16:00,267 --> 00:16:02,233
SO NOW IT'S OVERDUE.

304
00:16:02,233 --> 00:16:04,400
- AND WHAT HAPPENS
IF IT ISN'T PAID?

305
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,700
- THE PLACE STAYS PADLOCKED.

306
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,067
- AND IF I DECIDE TO SELL IT?

307
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,200
- WHEN I SEE SOME DOLLARS
ON THIS DESK,

308
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,333
YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU LIKE
WITH THAT FLEA TRAP.

309
00:16:28,733 --> 00:16:30,067
GOOD.

310
00:16:30,067 --> 00:16:33,900
I LIKE DEALING
WITH A REASONABLE MAN.

311
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,900
- I'D LIKE TO GET THAT
UPPITY BITCH RUTHIE ALONE.

312
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,400
I'LL TEACH HER SOME MANNERS.

313
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,733
SHE ALWAYS DID THINK
SHE WAS HOT SHIT.

314
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,067
- YOU'VE GOT A BUG UP YOUR ASS.

315
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:44,733
- YOU GOT IT?

316
00:16:44,733 --> 00:16:48,900
GET IT OUT!
GET IT OUT!

317
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,067
IT'S GONNA BE FIVE NEXT WEEK.

318
00:16:50,067 --> 00:16:51,733
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, BOY?

319
00:16:51,733 --> 00:16:53,067
SHIT!

320
00:16:53,067 --> 00:16:54,067
COME ON, LOVER BOY.

321
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:55,067
LET'S GO.

322
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:03,067
- EVENIN', WOODROW.

323
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:04,067
WHOO!

324
00:17:04,067 --> 00:17:06,233
HI, SWEETNESS.

325
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,733
CLEO, CLEO, HERE I COME.

326
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,900
OH, GODDAMN.

327
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,500
CLEO,
YOU ALWAYS WAS MY FAVORITE.

328
00:18:42,733 --> 00:18:44,900
- HEY, HEY, HEY!

329
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,733
EVERYBODY HAVE A DRINK
AND BE SOMEBODY.

330
00:18:46,733 --> 00:18:48,567
SAY, BOY, PUT A QUARTER
IN THE JUKEBOX,

331
00:18:48,567 --> 00:18:51,067
AND MAKE GODDAMN SURE
THESE NEGROS DRINK, Y'ALL.

332
00:18:51,067 --> 00:18:52,567
I'M PLEASED
TO MAKE THE ANNOUNCEMENT

333
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:54,100
THAT THE MAN HAS DONE HIS THING,

334
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,733
AND IT'S GONNA HAPPEN
AS SOON AS HE GETS HERE.

335
00:18:56,733 --> 00:18:57,733
BOOP, BOOP, BOOP, BOOP.

336
00:18:57,733 --> 00:18:59,067
LOOK OUT, GIRL.
WHAT YOU DOING?

337
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:01,300
- HARLEY, WHAT YOU RUNNING
YOUR MOUTH ABOUT NOW?

338
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,067
- I'M PLEASED
TO MAKE THE ANNOUNCEMENT

339
00:19:03,067 --> 00:19:05,567
THAT THE CLUB ALABAM
IS NOW OPEN.

340
00:19:05,567 --> 00:19:06,733
- NO.

341
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:07,900
- YEAH, IT IS.

342
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,567
- SO HOW LONG IS HE GONNA STAY?

343
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:11,733
- WELL, THAT AIN'T IMPORTANT.

344
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:14,233
- HONEY, THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK.

345
00:19:14,233 --> 00:19:16,733
HE ONLY DID IT SO HE COULD SELL
IT FOR A BETTER PRICE.

346
00:19:16,733 --> 00:19:17,733
- NO.
NO.

347
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:18,900
HE LISTENED WHEN I TOLD HIM

348
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,233
HOW GOOD BUSINESS WAS GONNA BE
AND EVERYTHING.

349
00:19:21,233 --> 00:19:24,067
- JUST BAIT TO HOOK THE FISH
THAT'S GONNA BUY IT.

350
00:19:24,067 --> 00:19:25,833
- WHY YOU GOT TO BE SO COLD?

351
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,233
EVERY TIME I MENTION DUKE'S
NAME, YOU GOT TO PUT HIM DOWN.

352
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,233
- 'CAUSE HE'S JUST ANOTHER
BIG CITY, JIVE ASS SPOOK.

353
00:19:31,233 --> 00:19:32,933
THAT'S WHY.
FORGET HIM.

354
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:34,167
- BUT THIS IS BEN'S BROTHER.

355
00:19:34,167 --> 00:19:35,233
HE DESERVES A BREAK.

356
00:19:35,233 --> 00:19:36,567
- HARLEY, LISTEN.

357
00:19:36,567 --> 00:19:38,733
I'VE MET 100 GUYS JUST LIKE HIM.

358
00:19:38,733 --> 00:19:40,400
TAKERS,
EVERY GODDAMN ONE OF 'EM,

359
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,800
AND I GOT THE SCARS TO PROVE IT.

360
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,233
- SHOOT!

361
00:19:43,233 --> 00:19:44,400
YOU DON'T KNOW HIM.

362
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,067
THIS IS A DIFFERENT KINDA MAN.

363
00:19:46,067 --> 00:19:49,200
- HARLEY, THERE AIN'T NO
DIFFERENT KINDA MAN.

364
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,733
- HEY, Y'ALL, CLETE, SAM.

365
00:20:03,733 --> 00:20:04,900
- HEY.

366
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,067
- I'M TELLING YOU

367
00:20:06,067 --> 00:20:08,000
THERE AIN'T NO ONE
LIKE THAT CLEO OF MINE.

368
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,233
MAN, SHE HAS GOT A MOUTH SOFT
AND SWEET AS AN OVERRIPE PLUM.

369
00:20:13,233 --> 00:20:15,567
AND I'LL TELL YA, THAT TONGUE,
SWEET JESUS!

370
00:20:15,567 --> 00:20:17,000
- SHIT.

371
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,400
IF YOU WEREN'T
THE CHIEF'S COUSIN,

372
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,733
SHE WOULDN'T GIVE YOU A SMILE
FOR FREE.

373
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:21,733
- AIN'T THAT THE TRUTH?

374
00:20:21,733 --> 00:20:23,067
- YOU GO TO HELL.

375
00:20:23,067 --> 00:20:26,133
- HEY, THE DUDE'S
OPENED THE ALABAM.

376
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:29,400
YOU THINK IT'S TIME MR. JOHNSON
JOINED THE CLUB?

377
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,667
- YEAH, YOU GO ON WITH SAM.

378
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:31,900
ME AND MERLE GOT SOME BUSINESS.

379
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,400
- AW, COME ON, CLETE.
LET ME GO WITH YA.

380
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,733
I ALWAYS MISS OUT
ON ALL THE FUN.

381
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,567
- UH-UH.

382
00:20:36,567 --> 00:20:38,233
LEAVE THIS ONE FOR THE MEN.

383
00:20:38,233 --> 00:20:42,233
- GET IN THE CAR, WARREN.

384
00:20:42,233 --> 00:20:43,333
- DAMN!

385
00:21:00,633 --> 00:21:02,067
- LET ME HAVE ONE OF THOSE.

386
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:10,567
THAT TASTES LIKE THAT BEEN
FLUSHED DOWN THE TOILET.

387
00:21:10,567 --> 00:21:12,100
WHAT DO YOU THINK, CLETE?

388
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,900
- WELL, IF YOU SMELL

389
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,067
AND LOOK LIKE A PIG,

390
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:27,133
I GUESS YOU GOT TO ACT LIKE ONE,
DON'T YA?

391
00:21:27,133 --> 00:21:29,700
ALL RIGHT, FELLAS, GET OUT.

392
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,067
- YOU WANT ME TO TELL HIM,
CLETE?

393
00:21:33,067 --> 00:21:37,400
- NO, I'LL TELL HIM, MERLE.

394
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,167
THE FACT IS I'M GONNA TELL HIM
REAL FRIENDLY.

395
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:41,400
I'M EVEN GONNA CALL HIM
BY HIS FIRST NAME.

396
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,400
NIGGER.

397
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,967
YOU WANT TO DO BUSINESS
IN BUCKTOWN,

398
00:21:43,967 --> 00:21:45,400
YOU GOT TO PAY
FOR THE PRIVILEGE.

399
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,667
- WELL, YOU SEE,
I'VE ALREADY PAID.

400
00:21:47,667 --> 00:21:51,500
- HEY, THAT WAS JUST
TO TAKE DOWN THE SIGN.

401
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,567
- HEY, HEY, HEY!

402
00:21:52,567 --> 00:21:54,567
EVERYBODY DO THEIR THING.

403
00:21:54,567 --> 00:21:57,367
- EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT,
YOU COME UP WITH 100 BUCKS.

404
00:21:57,367 --> 00:21:59,567
COME SATURDAY YOU DON'T GIVE ME
MY SATURDAY MONEY,

405
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:01,300
I'M GONNA SLAP A SIGN
ON THAT DOOR.

406
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,067
THAT SIGN GONNA SAY,
"NIGGER, READ AND RUN."

407
00:22:03,067 --> 00:22:04,233
YOU CAN'T READ AND RUN ANYWAY.

408
00:22:04,233 --> 00:22:05,400
FIRST NIGGER TOUCH THAT SIGN,

409
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,967
FIRST NIGGER
TRY TO COME THROUGH THAT DOOR,

410
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:08,767
I'M GONNA KICK HIS HEAD
TILL HIS EYES POOCH OUT

411
00:22:08,767 --> 00:22:10,233
LIKE AN EAGLE'S ASS
IN A POWER DIVE.

412
00:22:10,233 --> 00:22:12,133
YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, BOY?

413
00:22:12,133 --> 00:22:13,567
- OH, YEAH, I UNDERSTAND.

414
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:17,067
IT'S THAT CHEAP, SMELLY,
FUNKY CIGAR YOU'RE SMOKING

415
00:22:17,067 --> 00:22:19,567
THAT'S MAKING YOU TALK SO FUNNY.

416
00:22:19,567 --> 00:22:21,567
- THIS BOY HAS A MOUTH.

417
00:22:21,567 --> 00:22:24,167
- ALLIGATOR MOUTH
AND A HUMMINGBIRD ASS

418
00:22:24,167 --> 00:22:26,200
JUST LIKE HIS OLD BROTHER, BEN.

419
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,567
- HE SURE IS STUBBORN LIKE HIM.

420
00:22:29,567 --> 00:22:31,400
- YEAH, DON'T KICK THIS BOY
IN THE HEAD, MERLE.

421
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,500
YOU KNOW
YOU CAN'T HURT THEM NIGGERS

422
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,733
WHEN YOU KICK THEM IN THE HEAD.

423
00:22:33,733 --> 00:22:37,900
- ALL RIGHT, CLOWNS,
YOU'VE HAD YOUR LAUGHS.

424
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,400
NOW, EITHER GO OUT THE DOOR
OR THROUGH IT.

425
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,833
YOUR CHOICE.

426
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,567
- STEP ASIDE, BOY.

427
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,600
I'M CHECKING THAT CASH REGISTER.

428
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,233
- THE PRICE YOU HAVE TO PAY
TO DO THAT, CRACKER,

429
00:22:53,233 --> 00:22:55,067
AIN'T WORTH IT.

430
00:22:55,067 --> 00:22:57,567
- WHY YOU PALE FACES
ALWAYS TOGETHER?

431
00:22:57,567 --> 00:22:58,933
YOU FAGGOTS?

432
00:22:58,933 --> 00:23:00,233
- OH, YOU LITTLE SHIT.

433
00:23:03,733 --> 00:23:05,067
- STOP!

434
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,533
- DUKE, LOOK OUT!

435
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:47,867
- WATCH IT, DUKE!

436
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,500
- SUCKER.

437
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,067
- YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

438
00:24:22,067 --> 00:24:25,067
YOU TWO ARE A COUPLE
OF REAL SWEETHEARTS.

439
00:24:25,067 --> 00:24:27,567
- WHAT KINDA JIVE
ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?

440
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:30,067
- WHY WASN'T I TOLD
ABOUT WHAT'S COMING DOWN HERE?

441
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:31,767
- OH, DUKE,
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

442
00:24:31,767 --> 00:24:33,900
I DIDN'T SAY NOTHIN' 'CAUSE
I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO LEAVE.

443
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,533
ARETHA HERE, SHE FIGURED
YOU WERE GONNA GO ANYWAY,

444
00:24:36,533 --> 00:24:38,067
SO WHY SHOULD SHE SAY ANYTHING?

445
00:24:38,067 --> 00:24:40,400
THAT'S ALL THAT WENT DOWN, MAN.

446
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,433
- COPS STRONG ARM
THE WHOLE GODDAMN TOWN,

447
00:24:42,433 --> 00:24:43,633
DEALING IN PAYOUTS,

448
00:24:43,633 --> 00:24:45,167
AND YOU DON'T TELL ME
NOTHING ABOUT IT?

449
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:46,567
- I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT, DUKE.

450
00:24:46,567 --> 00:24:47,900
- NO, YOU'RE NOT SORRY, HARLEY.

451
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,067
WELL, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT US
TO DO?

452
00:24:50,067 --> 00:24:52,900
WE HAVE TO LIVE HERE!

453
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,733
- OKAY, YOU TWO CAN EAT THE CRAP

454
00:24:55,733 --> 00:24:57,567
THAT THEY DISH OUT,
BUT NOT ME, BABY.

455
00:24:57,567 --> 00:25:02,400
NO WAY.

456
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,233
- OH, NOW WAIT A MINUTE, DUKE.

457
00:25:04,233 --> 00:25:05,233
DUKE.

458
00:25:05,233 --> 00:25:09,900
- OH, SHOOT, HARLEY.

459
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,233
- DAMN!

460
00:25:12,233 --> 00:25:16,733
- HEY!

461
00:25:16,733 --> 00:25:19,667
- NOW YOU GET THIS,
AND YOU GET IT STRAIGHT.

462
00:25:19,667 --> 00:25:21,067
I AIN'T PAYING OFF ANYBODY.

463
00:25:21,067 --> 00:25:23,733
NOT YOUR BOOKIES,
NOT YOU, NOBODY!

464
00:25:23,733 --> 00:25:25,633
- NOW, SETTLE DOWN, MR. JOHNSON.

465
00:25:25,633 --> 00:25:27,067
SETTLE DOWN.

466
00:25:29,233 --> 00:25:31,900
NOW, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

467
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,233
- NOW, YOU JUST CAN THE BULL.

468
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:39,833
$450 WAS MY FIRST
AND LAST PAYMENT, CHUMP!

469
00:25:42,567 --> 00:25:46,900
- YOU MAY NOT BELIEVE THIS,

470
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,400
BUT WE RUN
A PRETTY BUSY DEPARTMENT HERE.

471
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,500
PUBLIC SERVICE TAKES MONEY,

472
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,633
AND WE DON'T GET IT ALL

473
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,567
FROM WRITING PARKING TICKETS,
YOU KNOW.

474
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:56,067
NOW, WE'RE NOT A BIG TOWN
LIKE WHERE YOU'RE FROM,

475
00:25:56,067 --> 00:25:58,733
BUT WE HAVE PLENTY OF WORK
TO KEEP US BUSY.

476
00:25:58,733 --> 00:26:03,567
FOR EXAMPLE,
TAKE YOUR BROTHER'S CASE.

477
00:26:03,567 --> 00:26:08,233
WE'RE NOT GIVING UP.

478
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,500
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU'RE NOT GIVING UP?

479
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,400
- WELL, I THOUGHT YOU KNEW.

480
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,333
SOME UNKNOWN ASSAILANT BEAT HIM,
AND LEFT HIM FOR DEAD.

481
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:21,233
- I WAS TOLD HE DIED
OF NATURAL CAUSES, PNEUMONIA.

482
00:26:21,233 --> 00:26:22,567
- TRUE.

483
00:26:22,567 --> 00:26:25,567
DUE TO EXPOSURE
AND LOSS OF BLOOD.

484
00:26:25,567 --> 00:26:28,733
NATURALLY,
WE DID WHAT WE COULD, BUT--

485
00:26:28,733 --> 00:26:33,067
MR. JOHNSON, YOU LOOK TO ME
TO BE AN INTELLIGENT MAN.

486
00:26:33,067 --> 00:26:35,567
YOU'VE BEEN AROUND,
YOU KNOW THE ROPES.

487
00:26:35,567 --> 00:26:40,100
AND YOU KNOW A SMART MAN
ALWAYS AVOIDS TROUBLE,

488
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,767
TRIES TO GET ALONG.

489
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,067
DOESN'T HE, MR. JOHNSON?

490
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:16,900
- IT'S A LITTLE WARMER TONIGHT,

491
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,900
AND I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT WANT THIS.

492
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,067
- COME ON IN.

493
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,567
- YOU AND I HAVEN'T GONE
OUT OF OUR WAY TO BE FRIENDS.

494
00:27:39,567 --> 00:27:41,233
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

495
00:27:41,233 --> 00:27:42,667
FORGET IT.

496
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,900
HERE'S LOOKIN' AT YA,
SWEETHEART.

497
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,167
- THIS AIN'T AN EASY TOWN
TO LIVE IN, YOU KNOW.

498
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:53,833
- YEAH, WHAT TOWN IS?

499
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,800
- WELL,
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS,

500
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:04,067
I WAS WRONG.

501
00:28:04,067 --> 00:28:06,733
- EVERYBODY PAYS THE MAN
IN THIS TOWN.

502
00:28:06,733 --> 00:28:08,900
NOBODY TELLS ME.

503
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,700
HONKIES RUN THIS TOWN.

504
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,900
NOBODY TELLS ME.

505
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,233
MY BROTHER, BEN,
IS FOUND DEAD IN THE GUTTER.

506
00:28:15,233 --> 00:28:18,067
NOBODY TELLS ME HOW OR WHY.

507
00:28:18,067 --> 00:28:21,733
- WELL, I'M NOT PROUD OF THE
FACT THAT I DIDN'T SAY NOTHIN'.

508
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:24,233
HOW DO YOU TELL SOMEBODY
THAT THEIR BROTHER WAS BEATEN UP

509
00:28:24,233 --> 00:28:26,167
BY SOME GOONS
AT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT

510
00:28:26,167 --> 00:28:29,067
AND LEFT TO DIE
IN THE FREEZING RAIN?

511
00:28:29,067 --> 00:28:30,900
I'VE WANTED TO TELL YOU, BUT--

512
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,733
- BUT YOU GOT TO HUSTLE
JUST FOR A LIVING, RIGHT?

513
00:28:32,733 --> 00:28:34,767
AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT SAFE.

514
00:28:34,767 --> 00:28:36,233
- PLAY IT SAFE?

515
00:28:36,233 --> 00:28:38,900
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT
I PLAY IT SAFE.

516
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,067
I'M TIRED OF LEADING THE CHARGE.

517
00:28:41,067 --> 00:28:45,167
- YOU EVER HEARD OF PRIDE?

518
00:28:45,167 --> 00:28:47,100
YOU WANT TO GO THROUGH LIFE
BEING TRAMPLED, BABY,

519
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,367
THAT'S YOUR BUSINESS.

520
00:28:48,367 --> 00:28:51,400
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT SCUFFLING AND HUSTLING

521
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,900
AND BREAKING YOUR BACK

00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,600
BUT STILL GOING ON LIVING

00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,767
WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?

524
00:28:58,767 --> 00:29:00,800
- YOU THINK YOU GOT A MONOPOLY
ON HARD TIMES?

525
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,333
I MEAN,
WHO PROMISED YOU A FREE RIDE?

526
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:04,567

BEN TOLD US ALL ABOUT YOU UNTIL
WE WERE SICK OF HEARING IT!

530
00:29:13,067 --> 00:29:15,167
I MUST BE SOME KINDA
SIMPLE-HEADED FOOL

531
00:29:15,167 --> 00:29:17,567
FOR COMING IN HERE
AND TRYING TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU

532
00:29:17,567 --> 00:29:18,900
FOR MISJUDGING YOU,

533
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,867
THINKING YOU WERE JUST
SOME KIND OF BIG CITY DUDE

534
00:29:20,867 --> 00:29:25,067
COMING DOWN HERE TO PARADE
IN FRONT OF US SMALL-TOWN FOLK.

535
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:26,833
- NOW YOU THINK DIFFERENT, HUH?

536
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:28,400
- WELL, I SAW DIFFERENT.

537
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,167
I SAW YOU STAND UP
FOR YOUR RIGHTS

538
00:29:30,167 --> 00:29:33,067
AND SHOW THAT
YOU WERE YOUR OWN MAN.

539
00:29:33,067 --> 00:29:34,400
AND WHAT DO I GET FOR IT?

540
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,800
JUST DUMPED ON.

541
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,233
- WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

542
00:29:39,233 --> 00:29:40,900
MY BLESSING?

543
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,400
OR THE KEYS TO THE CITY?

544
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,167
- YOU BASTARD!

545
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:31,400

546
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,067

550
00:32:09,733 --> 00:32:10,667

555
00:32:29,233 --> 00:32:30,467

556
00:32:30,467 --> 00:32:31,533
HE'S PRETTY STUBBORN.

557
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,067
HE'S JUST LIKE HIS OLD BROTHER,
BEN.

558
00:32:33,067 --> 00:32:34,200
- IT'D BE EASY, WOULDN'T IT?

559
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,433
- NOTHIN' TO IT.

560
00:32:35,433 --> 00:32:37,700
- HELL, WHAT'S ONE DEAD NIGGER,
MORE OR LESS?

561
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,400
- NOW, THAT'S JUST THE POINT,
BOYS.

562
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,700
AFTER BEN,
PEOPLE MIGHT GET TOO CURIOUS,

563
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,867
ESPECIALLY UP IN THE CAPITOL.

564
00:32:42,867 --> 00:32:43,867
AND WE DON'T WANT THAT.

565
00:32:43,867 --> 00:32:46,567
I JUST WANTED HIM
TAUGHT A LESSON.

566
00:32:46,567 --> 00:32:48,367
WE'LL SEE HOW WELL
HE'S LEARNED IT.

567
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:49,367
- RIGHT, CHIEF.

568
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:50,833
- GET OFF THE CAR.

569
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,467
- YOU ALL RIGHT, BABY?

570
00:33:00,467 --> 00:33:02,800
- YEAH, BUT, DUKE,
YOU GOT TO RUN.

571
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,233
THEY'RE GONNA KILL YOU.

572
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:06,567
- I NEVER RAN FROM NOBODY,
AND I DON'T INTEND TO START NOW.

573
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:10,233
- BUT, DUKE,
YOU CAN'T DO IT BY YOURSELF.

574
00:33:10,233 --> 00:33:12,400
PLEASE, DUKE, YOU GOT TO RUN.

575
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,567
PLEASE.

576
00:33:13,567 --> 00:33:15,067
- NO CHANCE, BABY.

577
00:33:38,067 --> 00:33:40,733

578
00:33:40,733 --> 00:33:43,533
EXCUSE ME.

579
00:33:43,533 --> 00:33:44,533

LISTEN, MAN.
[chuckles]

583
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,567
EVERYBODY'S BEEN SAYING,
"WHERE'S DUKE?

584
00:33:53,567 --> 00:33:54,900
WHEN'S HE COMIN' HOME?"

585
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,900
YEAH.

586
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,700

587
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,800
LISTEN.

588
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,733
I GOT TWO OR THREE
VERY SWEET PROPOSITIONS

589
00:34:02,733 --> 00:34:05,067

590
00:34:05,067 --> 00:34:06,567
HMM.

591
00:34:06,567 --> 00:34:07,733
LISTEN TO ONE OF THEM.

592
00:34:07,733 --> 00:34:10,333
[laughs]

593
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:13,567
- ROY, MAN, I DIDN'T CALL YOU UP
TO JIVE WITH YA, BROTHER.

594
00:34:13,567 --> 00:34:16,567
WE GOT TO TALK SERIOUS BUSINESS,
MAN.

595
00:34:16,567 --> 00:34:17,733
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

596
00:34:17,733 --> 00:34:19,067
WHAT'S THE MATTER, MAN?

00:34:19,067 --> 00:34:20,500
DON'T YOU LAUGH ANYMORE?

00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,067
- LOOK, FOCUS IN ON DETROIT.
REMEMBER?

599
00:34:23,067 --> 00:34:24,567
- ARE YOU KIDDIN'?

600
00:34:24,567 --> 00:34:27,900
WE WERE OUTNUMBERED, WHAT,

601
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,700
MAN, YOU WERE SOMETHIN' ELSE.

00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,833
- WELL, THE ODDS HERE

603
00:34:31,833 --> 00:34:34,900
MAN, IT'S A JIVE TOWN
WITH A BUNCH OF CRACKERS.

604
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,267
I NEED YOUR HELP.

605
00:34:36,267 --> 00:34:40,233

I'M ON MY WAY.

612
00:34:51,833 --> 00:34:54,900
- ROY,

613
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,233
BRING MUSCLE.

614
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,067
- I'M LOOKING AT A DEAD MAN.

615
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,067
- BOY.

616
00:36:03,067 --> 00:36:06,233
WHERE WOULD ONE FIND
THE CLUB ALABAM?

617
00:36:06,233 --> 00:36:08,533

618
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:10,400

619
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,233
- IT'S IN TOWN.

620
00:36:13,233 --> 00:36:16,067
- DO I TAKE A TAXI
OR A STAGECOACH?

621
00:36:16,067 --> 00:36:19,400
- THE CAB'S BROKE DOWN.

622
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,667

- I'VE SEEN BETTER LOOKIN'
PLACES IN THE SLAMS.

626
00:36:51,567 --> 00:36:54,167
- ROY, WHAT DOES THIS CAT, DUKE,

- HALF PINT, DIDN'T I TELL YOU
TO HAUL YOUR ASS?

636
00:37:10,067 --> 00:37:11,700
- HEY, HEY, EASE UP, T.J.

637
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,567
THE KID'S JUST TRYING
TO MAKE HIS HUSTLE.

638
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:15,333
I STARTED LIKE THAT TOO.

639
00:37:40,567 --> 00:37:42,600
- HEY, DUKE,
I THINK YOU GOT SOME COMPANY.

640
00:37:47,567 --> 00:37:50,400

WE PRACTICALLY GREW UP TOGETHER.

657
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:23,067
- MM.

658
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:24,567
WENT THROUGH SOME REAL,
REAL SCENES

659
00:38:24,567 --> 00:38:26,567
FROM THE STREETS
ALL THE WAY UP TO THE TOP, HUH?

660
00:38:26,567 --> 00:38:27,900
[laughs]
- YEAH, RIGHT ON.

661
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,433

665
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,267
- MAN, YOU'RE REALLY A SIGHT.

666
00:38:36,267 --> 00:38:37,733
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TROUBLE YOU GOT,

667
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:38,900
BUT WE'RE HERE WITH THE CURE.

668
00:39:00,467 --> 00:39:02,233
- HOW YOU LIKE
THESE LITTLE CUTIE PIES?

669
00:39:02,233 --> 00:39:03,233
- MAN, ARE YOU CRAZY?

670
00:39:03,233 --> 00:39:05,567
GET RID OF THIS JAILBAIT.

671
00:39:05,567 --> 00:39:06,567
- SORRY, GIRLS.

672
00:39:06,567 --> 00:39:07,833
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO PARTY LATER.

673
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:09,633
- COME ON, WE GOT TO TAKE CARE
OF SOME BUSINESS.

674
00:39:09,633 --> 00:39:11,500
GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER.
- YEAH.

675
00:39:13,233 --> 00:39:17,900
- OKAY, SO FOUR COPS
AND THE CHIEF.

676
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,333
THAT'S FIVE.

677
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:22,400
WHAT ABOUT THE GUY WHO HIRED
HIM, HIS HONOR THE MAYOR?

678
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,400
- NO, YOU WON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT HIM.

679
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,600
HE BROUGHT THE CHIEF IN TO CLEAN
UP THE TOWN FOR THE TOURISTS.

680
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,733
- AFTER HE SAW HE HAD A GOOD
THING GOIN', MOVED RIGHT IN.

681
00:39:31,733 --> 00:39:32,800
- MM.

682
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,167
SO HE'D BE
THE HAPPIEST OF ANYBODY

683
00:39:34,167 --> 00:39:35,600
TO SEE HIM RUN OUT OF TOWN.

684
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,400
- THEN WE DON'T HAVE
ANY PROBLEM, DO WE?

685
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,867
- REMEMBER THAT LITTLE SITUATION
WE HAD A COUPLE YEARS AGO?

686
00:39:42,867 --> 00:39:44,667
- YOU WANT TO WORK IT
THE SAME WAY?

687
00:39:44,667 --> 00:39:46,467
- WHY NOT, MAN?
NO SENSE IN DRAGGING IT OUT.

688
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:50,567
BESIDES, I WANT TO SEE IF YOU'VE
SLOWED DOWN IN YOUR OLD AGE.

689
00:39:50,567 --> 00:39:52,400
- HUH.
NO WAY.

690
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,233
[laughs]

691
00:39:56,233 --> 00:39:58,567
- HEY, THERE'S ANOTHER ONE
OUT THERE NOW.

692
00:39:58,567 --> 00:40:00,367
MAN, THIS CAT'S GONNA GO BLIND

693
00:40:00,367 --> 00:40:03,167
SQUINTING UP AT ME
WITH HIS BIG BLUE EYES.

694
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:06,200
- DUKE, WHAT ABOUT THE BOSS
OF THESE TIN SOLDIERS?

695
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,567
- WELL, FAR AS I CAN TELL, MAN,
HE'S ALL SPIT AND POLISHED.

696
00:40:10,567 --> 00:40:12,933
STILL THINK WORLD WAR II
IS GOING ON,

697
00:40:12,933 --> 00:40:15,000
BUT I WOULDN'T PLAY HIM
TOO CHEAP, MAN.

698
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,567
HE DIDN'T GET THIS FAR
BEING DUMB.

699
00:40:16,567 --> 00:40:18,033
- WANT TO KILL HIM FIRST?

700
00:40:18,033 --> 00:40:22,233
- NO, WE'LL HOOK THAT UP
AFTER WE GET THE LOCATIONS.

701
00:40:22,233 --> 00:40:27,933
- YOU SICK ANIMAL!

702
00:40:27,933 --> 00:40:29,667
- WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH HER?

703
00:40:35,167 --> 00:40:38,067
- THEY HAVEN'T BUDGED
FOR FOUR HOURS.

704
00:40:38,067 --> 00:40:40,067
NOBODY STAYS IN THAT HOTEL
THAT LONG.

705
00:40:40,067 --> 00:40:41,067
- WHERE'S DUANE?

706
00:40:41,067 --> 00:40:42,900
- HE'S OVER THERE.

707
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,033
THEY'RE TROUBLE, BRIAN.

708
00:40:44,033 --> 00:40:45,033
THEY DON'T LOOK RIGHT.

709
00:40:45,033 --> 00:40:47,400
- YOU WORRY TOO MUCH, SAM.

710
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,067
NO COON LOOKS GOOD
TO A DECENT MAN.

711
00:40:50,067 --> 00:40:52,067
JUST REMEMBER, WE'RE THE LAW.

712
00:40:52,067 --> 00:40:53,733
AND GOD IS ON OUR SIDE.

713
00:40:53,733 --> 00:40:55,033
- YES, SIR.

714
00:40:55,033 --> 00:40:56,333
- SEE YA LATER, SAM.

715
00:41:03,733 --> 00:41:05,233
- GETS OFF WORK AFTER MIDNIGHT,

716
00:41:05,233 --> 00:41:07,900
USUALLY MAKES A BEELINE
STRAIGHT FOR THIS PLACE.

717
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,567
THAT'S HIS OLD LADY
DANCING UP THERE.

718
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:12,733
HE USUALLY TAKES HER HOME
ABOUT 2:00.

719
00:41:12,733 --> 00:41:15,733
- THAT'LL BE A GOOD TIME
TO NAIL HIS ASS,

720
00:41:15,733 --> 00:41:19,567
IN THE SACK.

721
00:41:19,567 --> 00:41:22,733
- MAN, YOU GOT A MEAN STREAK
IN YOU, BROTHER.

722
00:41:22,733 --> 00:41:23,733
- TO THE BONE.

723
00:41:23,733 --> 00:41:26,233
[laughs]

724
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:28,133
- HEY, YOU BABIES
WANT A LITTLE ACTION?

725
00:41:28,133 --> 00:41:29,833
- WE GOT EACH OTHER, MAMA.

726
00:41:47,233 --> 00:41:49,233
- EXCUSE ME, SIR.

727
00:41:49,233 --> 00:41:50,233
MY NAME IS ROY WAYNE.

728
00:41:50,233 --> 00:41:51,600
THIS IS DUKE JOHNSON.

729
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,300
I'M SURE YOU KNOW HIM.
HE'S A FRIEND OF MINE.

730
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,500
WE WERE JUST TAKING A LITTLE
STROLL DOWN THE STREET HERE.

731
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,233
WE WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE IT
IF YOU WOULD JOIN US, HUH?

732
00:41:58,233 --> 00:41:59,400
- OH.

733
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,733
- LIGHT.
HUH?

734
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,500
- NO THANKS.
I DON'T SMOKE.

735
00:42:09,567 --> 00:42:10,900
- THINK WE SHOULD DITCH HIM?

736
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,667
- NO HE'S FAT ENOUGH.
LET HIM GET SOME EXERCISE.

737
00:42:19,733 --> 00:42:21,500
- THE END OF THE NIGHT HERE.

738
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,500
- SAM LIKES TO SPEND EVENINGS
OVER AT THE HOTEL.

739
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,567
THERE'S ALWAYS A BIG MONEY GAME
GOING ON.

740
00:42:32,567 --> 00:42:33,900
HE GETS A PIECE OF THE TAKE.

741
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,667
- BET FIVE.
YOU WANNA CALL?

742
00:42:35,667 --> 00:42:37,067
- THEN THERE'S MERLE.

743
00:42:37,067 --> 00:42:38,400
LIVES OVER
AT RUBY'S WHORE HOUSE.

744
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,400
OWNS A CHUNK OF IT.

745
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,067
MAN, THAT MOTHER.

746
00:42:41,067 --> 00:42:43,067
I MEAN, THAT MERLE, BOY,
HE GETS HIS KICKS

747
00:42:43,067 --> 00:42:45,567
LEANING HEAVY ON THE LADIES.

748
00:42:45,567 --> 00:42:48,900
- HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU
NOT TO BE LATE?

749
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,400
- I SWEAR I WASN'T LYING.

750
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,400
- DON'T YOU NEVER LIE TO ME.

751
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,900
YA HEAR?

752
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,633
NEVER!

753
00:42:56,633 --> 00:42:58,967
- USUALLY, THIS TIME OF NIGHT

754
00:42:58,967 --> 00:43:00,800
THERE'S ONLY ONE COP
MANNING THE FORT.

755
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,900
- OH, YEAH?

756
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:04,067
WELL, IT'S NO SWEAT, HUH?

757
00:43:04,067 --> 00:43:06,300
HE'S PROBABLY
SLEEPING ON THE JOB.

758
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:09,733
MAYBE WE OUGHT TO TRY
TO MAKE IT PERMANENT.

759
00:43:09,733 --> 00:43:10,733
- PERMANENT?

760
00:43:10,733 --> 00:43:11,900
[both chuckle]

761
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:12,933
DAMN, BROTHER.

762
00:43:12,933 --> 00:43:15,067
YOU HAVE BECOME
ONE VIOLENT DUDE.

763
00:43:15,067 --> 00:43:16,067
- TRUE.

764
00:43:16,067 --> 00:43:20,267
- LOVER OF ALL MANKIND, RIGHT?

765
00:43:20,267 --> 00:43:21,533
WELL, THE WAY I SEE IT, MAN,

766
00:43:21,533 --> 00:43:22,933
THE FIRST THING WE GOT TO DO
IS TAKE THAT RADIO OUT.

767
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,233
- TRUE.

768
00:43:24,233 --> 00:43:26,400
THE LAST THING WE NEED
IS STATE POLICE SNOOPING AROUND.

769
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,900
SOMEHOW, I DON'T THINK
THEY'D UNDERSTAND.

770
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,533
- WELL, WHAT YOU THINK, HOME?

771
00:43:30,533 --> 00:43:32,067
- IT'S COOL.

772
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:34,233
LIKE STEALING CANDY FROM A BABY.

773
00:43:34,233 --> 00:43:35,500
- OH, YEAH.
- UH-HUH.

774
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,567
- MERLE!
CLETE!

775
00:44:04,567 --> 00:44:05,600
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

776
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,567
- WAIT, PLEASE.

777
00:44:07,567 --> 00:44:09,233
DON'T HIT ME AGAIN.
DON'T HIT ME AGAIN.

778
00:44:09,233 --> 00:44:12,500
PLEASE, I DON'T WANT TO DIE!

779
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,500
PLEASE.

780
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,067
PLEASE, GOD.

781
00:44:15,067 --> 00:44:16,567
PLEASE, GOD.

782
00:44:16,567 --> 00:44:18,067
I'M JUST LIKE YOU.

783
00:44:18,067 --> 00:44:19,167
- LIKE HELL!

784
00:44:40,733 --> 00:44:42,167
- HONEY,
WHERE ARE THE CIGARETTES?

785
00:44:42,167 --> 00:44:46,067
- THEY'RE ON THE DRESSER, BABY.

786
00:44:46,067 --> 00:44:47,567
- SHH.

787
00:44:47,567 --> 00:44:49,333
SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH.

788
00:44:55,733 --> 00:44:56,833
- FIRE ESCAPE.

789
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,667
- LISTEN, YOU DUMB SAMBO.

790
00:45:45,667 --> 00:45:47,900
I'M GONNA EXPLAIN IT
JUST ONCE MORE.

791
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,900
I DON'T WANT MY HAMBURGERS
WITHOUT MUSTARD.

792
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:52,900
I WANT 'EM WITHOUT KETCHUP,
BUT WITH MUSTARD.

793
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,333
NOW, GET IT RIGHT THIS TIME,
OR I'M GONNA KICK YOUR ASS!

794
00:46:29,467 --> 00:46:30,467
- NOT AN INCH.

795
00:46:30,467 --> 00:46:32,967
DON'T MOVE AN INCH.

796
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:37,733
YOU KNOW ANY PRAYERS, CRACKER?

797
00:46:37,733 --> 00:46:41,567
SHAME ON YOU IF YOU DON'T.

798
00:46:41,567 --> 00:46:44,067
YOU SHOULDA HAD THE KETCHUP.

799
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:45,067
- I GOT ONE IN.

800
00:46:45,067 --> 00:46:46,067
WHERE'S ANOTHER ONE?

801
00:46:46,067 --> 00:46:47,467
GIVE ME A RAISE.
COME ON.

802
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,900
- KEEP THE MONEY.
I WANT HIM!

803
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:54,367
- DROP THE GUN DOWN,
OR I'LL BLOW HER HEAD OFF!

804
00:46:54,367 --> 00:46:55,367
DROP IT!

805
00:46:55,367 --> 00:47:01,133
- DUKE.

806
00:47:01,133 --> 00:47:02,700
- I MEAN IT.
NOW, BACK UP.

807
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,067
BACK UP AND LET ME OUT OF HERE.

808
00:47:04,067 --> 00:47:05,600
I'M GOING OUT,
AND I'M TAKING HER WITH ME.

809
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,733
MOVE BACK.

810
00:47:06,733 --> 00:47:08,567
MOVE BACK.
I'LL BLOW HER HEAD OFF.

811
00:47:08,567 --> 00:47:09,567
YOU STAY BACK.

812
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:11,067
YOU STAY FAR BACK.
YOU HEAR?

813
00:47:35,767 --> 00:47:37,067
- I MUST BE LOSING MY TOUCH.

814
00:47:37,067 --> 00:47:41,400
- GOT TO HIT HIM WHERE IT HURTS,
MY MAN.

815
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,233
- THAT'S A GOOD SHOT.
- [chuckles]

816
00:47:56,233 --> 00:47:58,167
- NO USE WASTING GOOD AMMO.

817
00:49:03,567 --> 00:49:05,567
- RISE AND SHINE, CHIEF.

818
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:08,167
- THE WAR IS OVER.

819
00:49:15,733 --> 00:49:17,733
- [speaks indistinctly]

820
00:49:17,733 --> 00:49:20,567
- AH, COMPANY.

821
00:49:20,567 --> 00:49:22,067
- WELL, WELL.

822
00:49:22,067 --> 00:49:25,400
BUCKTOWN'S OWN
PRIVATE TIN SOLDIER.

823
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,233
- TEN, HUP!

824
00:49:27,233 --> 00:49:28,900
- WHAT DO YOU THINK, DUKE?

825
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,767
- WELL, HOW ABOUT 10:00
IN THE MORNIN'?

826
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:32,733
- WHY, THAT'S TOO EARLY.

827
00:49:32,733 --> 00:49:35,900
- WELL, HOW ABOUT HIGH NOON?

828
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,733
- WHAT, AND SPOIL OUR LUNCH?

829
00:49:37,733 --> 00:49:38,733
- DAMN!

830
00:49:38,733 --> 00:49:40,333
LET'S SHOOT HIM AT 1:00 THEN.

831
00:49:40,333 --> 00:49:45,233
- HOW ABOUT RIGHT NOW?

832
00:49:45,233 --> 00:49:47,067
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA KILL ME.

833
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:48,400
NEWS TRAVELS FAST.

834
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,567
IT'S BOUND TO GET
TO THE STATE TROOPERS.

835
00:49:50,567 --> 00:49:51,900
IF THEY ASK ANY QUESTIONS,

836
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,967
YOU'RE GONNA TELL
YOUR BLACK MAYOR TO TELL THEM

837
00:49:53,967 --> 00:49:55,900
THAT YOU'RE HOLDING
THE CHIEF OF POLICE

838
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,400
FOR BREAKING THE LAW.

839
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,400
NO, YOU'RE GONNA KEEP ME ALIVE

840
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,667
'CAUSE I'M GONNA KEEP YOUR BLACK
ASSES FROM BURNING IN HELL!

841
00:50:11,733 --> 00:50:15,233
- $1,432: PROSTITUTION.

842
00:50:15,233 --> 00:50:17,733
- I CAN'T TELL YA HOW MUCH
WE APPRECIATE WHAT YOU BOYS

843
00:50:17,733 --> 00:50:19,667
HAVE DONE
FOR OUR LITTLE OLD TOWN.

844
00:50:19,667 --> 00:50:23,400
WE WERE ALL BEING, WELL,
YOU KNOW--WE WERE BEING--

845
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,233
- THE WORD'S "SCREWED,"
MR. MAYOR.

846
00:50:25,233 --> 00:50:26,233
- EXACTLY.

847
00:50:26,233 --> 00:50:27,233
JUST THE RIGHT WORD.

848
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:28,400
- EXCUSE ME, ASSISTANT.

849
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,567
- $2,848: GAMBLING.

850
00:50:31,567 --> 00:50:34,067
- BEFORE I FORGET,

00:50:34,067 --> 00:50:37,233
THE BADGES FROM YOUR USED TO BE
POLICE DEPARTMENT.

852
00:50:37,233 --> 00:50:39,400
- WE DO THANK YOU.

853
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,733
IF ONLY THERE WAS SOME WAY
TO THANK YOU.

854
00:50:41,733 --> 00:50:44,733
I MEAN, FOR OUR TOWN
TO EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION

855
00:50:44,733 --> 00:50:47,767
FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE
BEFORE YOU LEAVE.

856
00:50:47,767 --> 00:50:50,900
- THINK REAL HARD.

857
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,500
YOU'LL COME UP WITH SOMETHING.

858
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,633
- MR. MAYOR,

859
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:56,067
LAST NIGHT'S RECEIPTS

00:50:56,067 --> 00:50:58,833
OF $6,319.

861
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,500
- FINE.

862
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,400
A PARADE.

863
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,400
- WHAT?

864
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,233
- DOWN THE MAIN STREET

865
00:51:15,233 --> 00:51:16,733
WITH THE HIGH SCHOOL
MARCHING BAND

866
00:51:16,733 --> 00:51:19,300

867
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:21,633

870
00:51:26,367 --> 00:51:27,400
- NO PARADE.

871
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,467
- NO PARADE.

872
00:51:28,467 --> 00:51:30,333
- NO PARADE?

873
00:51:30,333 --> 00:51:31,333
- NO.

874
00:51:31,333 --> 00:51:32,367
NO PARADES.

875
00:51:32,367 --> 00:51:34,800
- I THINK I CAN SUGGEST
A BETTER WAY

876
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,767
FOR YOU TO SHOW YOUR
APPRECIATION, MR. MAYOR.

877
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:49,900
- DUKE.

878
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:50,900
DUKE, WAKE UP.

879
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:54,567
GET YOUR BUNS UP.

880
00:51:54,567 --> 00:51:55,567
DUKE.

881
00:51:55,567 --> 00:51:56,567
- WHAT?

882
00:51:56,567 --> 00:51:57,900
- GET UP.

883
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:59,567
- COME ON.
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

884
00:51:59,567 --> 00:52:01,300
ANY TIME'S THE RIGHT TIME.
COME ON.

885
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:03,067
- DUKE, I DIDN'T COME HERE
TO GET IN YOUR BED.

886
00:52:03,067 --> 00:52:05,067
I CAME TO GET YOU OUT OF IT.

887
00:52:05,067 --> 00:52:06,100
- OUT OF IT?

888
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:07,567
TOO EARLY.

889
00:52:07,567 --> 00:52:09,233
ROY DON'T LEAVE TILL 12:00.

890
00:52:09,233 --> 00:52:11,233
- BUT, DUKE, THAT'S WHAT
I CAME HERE TO TELL YOU.

891
00:52:11,233 --> 00:52:13,133
THE TRAIN'S LEAVING,
BUT ROY AIN'T.

892
00:52:13,133 --> 00:52:16,067
DUKE.

893
00:52:16,067 --> 00:52:17,067
- WHAT?

894
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:18,200
WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?

895
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,933
- THEY'RE ALL STAYIN' HERE.

896
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,667
- NOW, WHAT THEY GONNA DO
IN THIS HICK TOWN?

897
00:52:25,667 --> 00:52:29,400
- THEY'RE GONNA WEAR BADGES
IN THIS HICK TOWN.

898
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,400
- BADGES?

899
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,733
- ROY CONNED THE MAYOR.

900
00:52:31,733 --> 00:52:33,400
NOW HE'S WEARING
THE CHIEF'S BADGE.

901
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,267
JOSH, T.J., AND HAMBONE
ARE POLICEMEN.

902
00:52:36,267 --> 00:52:39,567
- [laughs]

903
00:52:39,567 --> 00:52:41,233
I'LL BE DAMNED.

904
00:52:41,233 --> 00:52:43,733
ALL FOUR OF 'EM, HUH?

905
00:52:43,733 --> 00:52:46,400
AND ALL OF 'EM WITH A RAP SHEET
A YARD LONG.

906
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,533
AND, YOU KNOW, I BET OLD ROY
IS TOTALLY UP TO SOMETHIN'.

907
00:52:48,533 --> 00:52:50,567
- WELL,
THAT'S NOT HARD TO FIGURE OUT.

908
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:52,567
YOU WANT MY OPINION?
- NO.

909
00:52:52,567 --> 00:52:54,733
- WELL, YOU'RE GONNA GET IT
ANYWAY, DUMMY.

910
00:52:54,733 --> 00:52:57,567
YOUR BUDDY SAW WHAT A GOOD THING
THE CHIEF HAD GOIN' FOR HIM,

911
00:52:57,567 --> 00:52:59,433
AND NOW HE WANTS IT FOR HIMSELF.

912
00:52:59,433 --> 00:53:00,800
- NO, THEY'RE BROTHERS.

913
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:01,833
THE CHIEF AND HIS BOYS,
THEY WERE--

914
00:53:01,833 --> 00:53:03,167
- HONKIES.

915
00:53:03,167 --> 00:53:06,400
WELL, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHIN'
ABOUT PEOPLE, BIG SHOT.

916
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,733
WHETHER THEY'RE WHITE, BLACK,
GREEN, YELLOW, OR PURPLE,

917
00:53:08,733 --> 00:53:12,167
WHEN THEY SMELL A FEW DOLLARS,
THEY ALL ACT ALIKE.

918
00:53:12,167 --> 00:53:13,833
- HUH.
- MM.

919
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:15,833
GET UP!

920
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,067
- I WON'T TELL YOU ANYTHING.

921
00:53:29,067 --> 00:53:31,400
- BUCKTOWN'S PURE GOLD, CHIEF.

922
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:34,900
AND YOU'VE BEEN SQUEEZING
AND MILKING IT DRY.

923
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:36,567
SO COME ON.

924
00:53:36,567 --> 00:53:42,567
FOR THE LAST TIME,
WHERE'S THE DOUGH?

925
00:53:42,567 --> 00:53:46,900
- PAYING OFF STREET SCUM
IS EASY.

926
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:50,067
GIVING INTO 'EM, IMPOSSIBLE.

927
00:53:50,067 --> 00:53:53,567
- A MAN WHO WON'T TALK

928
00:53:53,567 --> 00:53:57,567
DOESN'T NEED HIS TONGUE.

929
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:58,633
HAMBONE.

930
00:54:08,733 --> 00:54:10,067
- HEY, PARTNER.

931
00:54:10,067 --> 00:54:11,400
[chuckles]

932
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,900
WELCOME TO THE PROMISED LAND,
HUH?

933
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:16,400
HEY, BABY, WHY DON'T YOU GO

934
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,900
AND PUT SOMETHING ON
A LITTLE SWEETER FOR MY MAN.

935
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:21,167
- SURE.

936
00:54:26,233 --> 00:54:29,567
- WHAT IS IT WE'RE GONNA BE
PARTNERS IN, BUDDY?

937
00:54:29,567 --> 00:54:31,400
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE GONNA LEAVE TOWN, MAN.

938
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,900
WHAT HAPPENED?

939
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:34,400
- CONSIDERABLE.

940
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,200
CONSIDERABLE.

941
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,567
MAN, LISTEN.

942
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:39,233
WHEN I GOT THE TELEPHONE CALL
BACK EAST

943
00:54:39,233 --> 00:54:42,900
SAYING THAT MY PARTNER
NEEDED SOME HELP,

944
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:45,067
HOW WAS I TO KNOW
THAT HE WAS GONNA CUT ME IN

945
00:54:45,067 --> 00:54:49,233
ON A SOFT TOUCH THAT I'VE BEEN
WAITING FOR ALL MY LIFE?

946
00:54:49,233 --> 00:54:51,567
- TOUCH?

947
00:54:51,567 --> 00:54:53,067
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, MAN?

948
00:54:53,067 --> 00:54:54,233
I JUST CALLED YOU IN THIS TOWN

949
00:54:54,233 --> 00:54:55,867
TO HELP TO GET RID
OF SOME JIVE CRACKERS.

950
00:54:55,867 --> 00:54:57,267
THAT'S ALL.
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

951
00:54:57,267 --> 00:54:59,067
SO YOU KNOW
WHAT THE GOOD BOOK SAYS.

952
00:54:59,067 --> 00:55:01,800
"THE LORD HELPS THEM
THAT HELPS THEMSELVES."

953
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,133
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING,
MAN.

954
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,500
WE'RE HELPING OURSELVES.

955
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,067
WE OWN THIS TOWN.

956
00:55:06,067 --> 00:55:07,567
AND THANKS TO HIS HONOR,

957
00:55:07,567 --> 00:55:10,400
WE EVEN GOT THE BADGES HERE
TO PROVE IT.

958
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,400
HUH?

959
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:15,067
HERE'S YOURS.

960
00:55:15,067 --> 00:55:16,567
- NO, MAN.

961
00:55:16,567 --> 00:55:20,567
LISTEN, IT'S NOT MY WAY, ROY.

962
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:21,900
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, MAN?

963
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:22,900
HUH?

964
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,400
YOU DON'T LIKE MONEY?

965
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,400
OR ARE YOU BEGINNING TO FALL
FOR THIS SMALL-TOWN JIVE?

966
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,233
I MEAN, HERE WE GOT A POT OF
GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW,

967
00:55:31,233 --> 00:55:33,400
AND MY HOMEBOY'S
GOING SOFT ON ME.

968
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,233
- OH, COME ON, ROY.
YOU KNOW BETTER THAN THAT.

969
00:55:35,233 --> 00:55:37,067
- WELL, HOW DO I KNOW?
HOW DO I KNOW?

970
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:41,400
YOU DON'T EVEN ACT LIKE
THE CAT I GREW UP WITH.

971
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:45,167
- MAN, IT'S JUST THAT
THIS IS MY BROTHER'S TOWN, MAN.

972
00:55:45,167 --> 00:55:46,900
HIS FRIENDS.

973
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:50,567
I MEAN, I WOULDN'T FEEL RIGHT
LEANING ON HIS PEOPLE, MAN.

974
00:55:50,567 --> 00:55:52,233
- UH-HUH.
YEAH.

975
00:55:52,233 --> 00:55:56,567
OKAY, IF THAT'S THE WAY YOU WANT
IT, THAT'S THE WAY IT'LL BE.

976
00:55:56,567 --> 00:55:57,733
NOW, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

977
00:55:57,733 --> 00:55:59,400
I WON'T LEAN ON 'EM TOO HARD.

978
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,300
JUST ENOUGH TO PAY THE RENT.

979
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:02,900
YEAH.
[laughs]

980
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,400
LIKE ROBIN HOOD.

981
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,900
ROB FROM THE RICH.

982
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,233
GIVE TO THE POOR:

983
00:56:07,233 --> 00:56:08,567
ME.

984
00:56:08,567 --> 00:56:10,400
YOU, YOU JUST KEEP RUNNING

985
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,400
THAT LITTLE CLUB OF YOURS
DOWN THERE, SEE.

986
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,900
AND WE'LL TAKE
YOUR SHARE OF THE MONEY,

987
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:17,800
AND PUT IT IN THE SAFE

988
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:23,733
AND WHEN YOU DECIDE YOU WANT IT,
IT'LL BE THERE WAITING FOR YA.

989
00:56:23,733 --> 00:56:26,233
- YOU'RE SERIOUS, AIN'T YA?

990
00:56:26,233 --> 00:56:28,700
- I'M SERIOUS AS A HEART ATTACK.

991
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:30,233
OH, MAN.
[chuckles]

992
00:56:30,233 --> 00:56:33,800
I AIN'T GONNA BE NO MORE TROUBLE
THAN THE TAX COLLECTOR.

993
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,233
COME ON, BROTHER.

[laughs]

999
00:56:45,433 --> 00:56:49,833
TO BEAUTIFUL BUCKTOWN.

1000
00:57:32,967 --> 00:57:34,233
- YOU'RE SHORT.

1001
00:57:34,233 --> 00:57:35,567
$300 SHORT.

1002
00:57:35,567 --> 00:57:36,733
- LAST NIGHT WAS LOUSY!

1003
00:57:36,733 --> 00:57:38,300
- AND YOU KNOW WHAT ROY SAID.

1004
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:40,233
- HOW THE HELL CAN I COME UP
WITH AN EXTRA 50%

1005
00:57:40,233 --> 00:57:41,633
WHEN THE GIRLS
DIDN'T EVEN MAKE IT?

1006
00:57:41,633 --> 00:57:43,400
- WELL, JUST OPEN
YOUR PIGGYBANK, BABY.

1007
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:47,433
EVERYBODY'S GOT TO COME UP WITH
THE NEW DUES FOR A NEW DAY.

1008
00:57:54,067 --> 00:57:55,400
OH, MAN, MAN.

1009
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,900

1011
00:57:58,567 --> 00:58:01,467
THE TOWN FLIPPING THE TOURISTS,
AND US FLIPPING THE TOWN.

1012
00:58:01,467 --> 00:58:03,733

1013
00:58:03,733 --> 00:58:04,933
ROY'S FRIEND.

1014
00:58:04,933 --> 00:58:06,400

1015
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,567
- YEAH.

1016
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:09,233
AND HE'S GOT A BIG HAND
IN THE MONEY.

1017
00:58:09,233 --> 00:58:11,667
AND HE DOESN'T DO A DAMN THING
TO HELP US EARN IT.

1018
00:58:11,667 --> 00:58:14,267
- NOTHIN' WE CAN DO 'CAUSE
THAT'S THE WAY ROY WANTS IT.

1019
00:58:14,267 --> 00:58:17,733
- WELL, MAYBE THERE IS.

00:59:11,333 --> 00:59:14,133
SOMEBODY COULD TAKE OUT
TWO MENS.

1043
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:15,667
- HARLEY HERE KEEPS TELLING ME

1044
00:59:15,667 --> 00:59:17,900
HE THREW THAT KEY BLOCK
IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME.

1045
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:20,567
EXPECTS ME TO BELIEVE HIM.

1046
00:59:20,567 --> 00:59:21,833
- BIG LYING NUISANCE.

1047
00:59:21,833 --> 00:59:23,067
BIG PHONY.

1048
00:59:23,067 --> 00:59:24,900
- YOUR MAMA WAS A NUISANCE.

1049
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:27,900
SHE THE BIGGEST NUISANCE
YOU EVER MET.

1050
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:30,233
- I SAY YOU'RE LYING, BIG MAN.

1051
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,633
- I AIN'T LYING, PUNK.

1052
00:59:31,633 --> 00:59:34,067
AND YOU, PUNK.

1053
00:59:34,067 --> 00:59:35,733
AND YOU, YOU'RE A SISSY.

1054
00:59:35,733 --> 00:59:39,900
AND YOU, YOU SON OF A GUN,
YOU'RE A PUNK ASS SISSY.

1055
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:41,067
- LYING LUSH.

1056
00:59:41,067 --> 00:59:42,767
I SAY YOU'RE A LYING LUSH.

1057
00:59:42,767 --> 00:59:45,933
- BIG STAR FOOTBALL PLAYER.

1058
00:59:45,933 --> 00:59:48,067
- I TELL YA,
I WAS THE STAR OF THAT GAME,

1059
00:59:48,067 --> 00:59:49,333
MOTHERFUCKER!

1060
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,867
- HARLEY.

1061
01:00:23,867 --> 01:00:25,233
[crying]

1062
01:00:25,233 --> 01:00:27,067
- HARLEY.

1063
01:00:27,067 --> 01:00:30,233
- NO.

1064
01:00:30,233 --> 01:00:31,333
- HARLEY.

1065
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,400
- HARLEY.

1066
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,567
- STEVIE.

1067
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:39,433
STEVIE, LET GO.

1068
01:00:39,433 --> 01:00:41,667
STEVIE, NO.
STEVIE.

1069
01:00:44,233 --> 01:00:45,833
WE'RE GONNA GO WITH HIM.

1070
01:01:10,067 --> 01:01:14,067
- IF BUSINESS GETS ANY BETTER,
WE'RE GONNA NEED A BIGGER SAFE.

1071
01:01:14,067 --> 01:01:15,500
LISTEN.
ADD THIS UP RIGHT HERE.

1072
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,333
- NOW, ROY.

1073
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,667
- WHAT ARE YOU WAITIN' FOR?

1074
01:01:21,667 --> 01:01:24,067
- FOR YOU TO TELL ME
WHY YOU SENT YOUR GOONS

1075
01:01:24,067 --> 01:01:27,233
TO BEAT UP ON HARLEY.

1076
01:01:27,233 --> 01:01:30,800
- WHY WOULD I DO A THING
LIKE THAT?

1077
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:33,733
- LISTEN, HARLEY
IS IN THE HOSPITAL, MAN.

1078
01:01:33,733 --> 01:01:34,967
AND IF HE DON'T MAKE IT--

1079
01:01:34,967 --> 01:01:37,067
- OH, COME ON, MAN, COOL IT.

1080
01:01:37,067 --> 01:01:39,233
COOL IT.

1081
01:01:39,233 --> 01:01:41,233
I MEAN, YOU'RE MAKING A LOT TO
DO OUT OF NOTHIN'.

1082
01:01:41,233 --> 01:01:43,500
THE WAY I GET IT, HARLEY
WAS GETTING DRUNK IN THE BAR.

1083
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:44,500
RIGHT?

1084
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:45,867
HE WAS CAUSING A DISTURBANCE.

1085
01:01:45,867 --> 01:01:47,067
THERE WAS A COMPLAINT.

1086
01:01:47,067 --> 01:01:49,233
LOOK, WHAT ARE MY MEN WEARING
THOSE BADGES FOR

1087
01:01:49,233 --> 01:01:50,900
EXCEPT TO KEEP THE PEACE?

1088
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:52,567
- OH, COME ON, ROY.

1089
01:01:52,567 --> 01:01:54,133
YOU KNOW THAT'S B.S.

1090
01:01:54,133 --> 01:01:56,133
- YOU CALLING ME A LIAR?

1091
01:01:56,133 --> 01:01:58,067
- NO, MAN,
I'M NOT CALLING YOU A LIAR.

1092
01:01:58,067 --> 01:01:59,733
I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH.

1093
01:01:59,733 --> 01:02:02,233
- SO AM I.

1094
01:02:02,233 --> 01:02:03,567
WHAT'S WRONG, DUKE?

1095
01:02:03,567 --> 01:02:04,900
I MEAN, WHAT'S HAPPENING?

1096
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:06,733
I MEAN, AFTER ALL
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH, MAN,

1097
01:02:06,733 --> 01:02:09,067
WHY WOULD I WANT TO LAY
OUR FRIENDSHIP ON THE LINE

1098
01:02:09,067 --> 01:02:10,433
BEHIND SOME BULLSHIT?

1099
01:02:10,433 --> 01:02:14,400
- I'M NOT COMING DOWN ON YOU,
ROY.

1100
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,667
I JUST WANT YOU TO CONTROL
YOUR CLOWNS, THAT'S ALL.

1101
01:02:16,667 --> 01:02:18,567
BECAUSE IF THEY PUSH MY PEOPLE
AROUND AGAIN,

1102
01:02:18,567 --> 01:02:21,900
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO TANGLE
WITH ME.

1103
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:26,067
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING, MAN.

1104
01:02:26,067 --> 01:02:27,333
- OKAY.

1105
01:02:43,233 --> 01:02:46,400
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT DID HAPPEN TO HARLEY?

1106
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:49,567
- MAN, LIKE I TOLD YOU,
BIG MAN CAN'T HANDLE HIS SAUCE.

1107
01:02:49,567 --> 01:02:50,733
WE WENT IN TO MAKE AN ARREST,

1108
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:52,900
AND HE BEGAN
THROWING HIS WEIGHT AROUND.

1109
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:55,233
SO IT TOOK THREE OF US
TO GET HIM OUT.

1110
01:02:55,233 --> 01:02:57,233
- THAT'S ALL?

1111
01:02:57,233 --> 01:02:58,667
- WOULD I LIE TO YOU?

1112
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:16,067
- OH, HARLEY.

1113
01:03:16,067 --> 01:03:18,900
HOW DOES YOUR HEAD FEEL?

1114
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:21,467
- ALL RIGHT, ARETHA.

1115
01:03:21,467 --> 01:03:22,967
- WELL, WHAT HAPPENED?

1116
01:03:22,967 --> 01:03:25,967
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T START THAT
FIGHT LIKE THEY SAID YOU DID.

1117
01:03:25,967 --> 01:03:31,167
- I DON'T RIGHTLY REMEMBER,
ARETHA.

1118
01:03:32,567 --> 01:03:36,400
I DO KNOW WE...

1119
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,767
WAS ALL
IN THE BAR THERE DRINKIN'.

1120
01:03:38,767 --> 01:03:42,900
I WAS TELLIN' 'EM HOW...

1121
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:46,833
I WAS THE STAR OF THAT GAME.

1122
01:03:49,067 --> 01:03:52,133
AND THEY SAID I WAS LYING.

1123
01:03:52,133 --> 01:03:55,067
- [murmuring indistinctly]

1124
01:04:02,233 --> 01:04:03,900
- THE NURSES,

1125
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:06,067
THEY SAY...

1126
01:04:06,067 --> 01:04:11,400
IT TOOK 45 STITCHES
TO SEW ME UP.

1127
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:15,067
THAT'S SOME KINDA RECORD,
AIN'T IT?

1128
01:04:15,067 --> 01:04:19,233
- YEAH, HARLEY,
THAT'S SOME KINDA RECORD.

1129
01:04:19,233 --> 01:04:22,233
- I'M SORRY, ARETHA.

1130
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:25,333
I FEEL LIKE A STOMPED DOWN FOOL.

1131
01:04:25,333 --> 01:04:27,733
- OH, HARLEY.

1132
01:04:27,733 --> 01:04:29,500
YOU'RE MY NUMBER ONE.

1133
01:04:41,367 --> 01:04:44,733
- LOOKS LIKE YOUR FRIEND ROY
IS BUILDING UP AN ARMY.

1134
01:04:44,733 --> 01:04:46,567
POOR OLD BUCKTOWN.

1135
01:04:46,567 --> 01:04:48,567
THINGS WERE BAD ENOUGH
UNDER THE CHIEF,

1136
01:04:48,567 --> 01:04:53,567
BUT NOW THEY'RE TEN TIMES WORSE.

1137
01:04:53,567 --> 01:04:56,400
THERE'S NO WAY
THAT WE CAN FIGHT 'EM.

1138
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:57,733
NO WAY.

1139
01:04:57,733 --> 01:04:59,267
NO WAY.

1140
01:05:16,067 --> 01:05:20,400
- CAN I BUY YOU A DRINK, LADY?

1141
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:23,567
- SUIT YOURSELF.

1142
01:05:23,567 --> 01:05:26,233
- TWO OF THE SAME.

1143
01:05:26,233 --> 01:05:27,900
WHERE'S YOUR MAN?

1144
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:29,400
- NOT HERE.

1145
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,900
HE'S AT THE HOSPITAL
LOOKING IN ON HARLEY.

1146
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:33,067
- HOW IS HARLEY?

1147
01:05:33,067 --> 01:05:34,400
- HE'S MAKING IT.

1148
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,833
NO THANKS TO YOU.

1149
01:05:39,067 --> 01:05:41,733
- THANK YOU.

1150
01:05:41,733 --> 01:05:43,900
MAYBE YOU COULD DO YOURSELF
AND YOUR MAN A BIG FAVOR,

1151
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:46,067
IF YOU WOULD.

1152
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:47,400
- LIKE HOW?

1153
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,133
- GET HIM TO LEAVE TOWN NOW.

1154
01:05:49,133 --> 01:05:50,233
- HUH.

1155
01:05:50,233 --> 01:05:52,400
WHY SHOULD HE LEAVE TOWN?

1156
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,833
- WELL,
THERE ARE A LOT OF BIG REASONS

1157
01:05:53,833 --> 01:05:55,733
DOWN IN THAT VAULT AT CITY HALL.

1158
01:05:55,733 --> 01:05:57,567
HIS CUT OF THE PIE.

1159
01:05:57,567 --> 01:06:01,733
YOU TWO COULD LIVE REAL HIGH
ON HIS SHARE OF THE MONEY.

1160
01:06:01,733 --> 01:06:03,567
YEAH.

1161
01:06:03,567 --> 01:06:08,167
FINE DIAMONDS, JEWELRY,
HIGH LIVING.

1162
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:15,067
- SUPPOSE I WANT TO STAY.

1163
01:06:15,067 --> 01:06:19,067
- WELL, YOU GOT A PRETTY NICE
CHOICE ANY WAY YOU LOOK AT IT.

1164
01:06:19,067 --> 01:06:21,733
IF YOU GO, YOU GOT DUKE
AND ALL THAT HEAVY BREAD.

1165
01:06:21,733 --> 01:06:24,833
AND IF YOU DECIDE TO STAY ON
HERE IN BUCKTOWN,

1166
01:06:24,833 --> 01:06:28,733
I'D BE WILLING TO MAKE YOU
A VERY SWEET PROPOSITION.

1167
01:06:28,733 --> 01:06:32,567
SERIOUSLY.

1168
01:06:32,567 --> 01:06:37,733
- WHAT IF WE BOTH
DECIDE TO STAY,

1169
01:06:37,733 --> 01:06:39,367
ME AND DUKE?

1170
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:43,933
- I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE
TOO PLEASANT.

1171
01:07:16,067 --> 01:07:18,467
- OH, MAN, I'M GONNA ENJOY THIS.

1172
01:07:18,467 --> 01:07:21,067
- NOW, YOU'RE GOING ABOUT IT
THE WRONG WAY, T.J.

1173
01:07:21,067 --> 01:07:24,233
- OH, MAN, DUKE WILL THINK
ROY SET IT ALL UP.

1174
01:07:24,233 --> 01:07:26,067
YOU WAIT HERE.

1175
01:07:41,233 --> 01:07:42,667
- NAH, NAH, NAH, NAH, NAH.

1176
01:07:58,967 --> 01:08:03,700
- FIRST,
I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR ARMS.

1177
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:08,567
THEN I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR LEGS.

1178
01:08:08,567 --> 01:08:10,767
BUT I'M GONNA START
ON YOUR FACE.

1179
01:08:44,733 --> 01:08:46,733
- DUKE, BABY.

1180
01:08:46,733 --> 01:08:49,067
I THOUGHT WE YOUR FRIENDS.

1181
01:08:49,067 --> 01:08:51,733
NOW, WE COME DOWN HERE
TO HELP YOU OUT.

1182
01:08:51,733 --> 01:08:55,567
- YEAH, JOSH, YOU CAN HELP.

1183
01:08:55,567 --> 01:08:59,067
YOU GET THIS IDIOT OUT OF HERE
BEFORE I BLOW HIS BRAINS OUT.

1184
01:09:42,733 --> 01:09:44,067
THIS IS JUST BETWEEN
ME AND YOU.

1185
01:09:44,067 --> 01:09:45,567
- HEY, WAIT A MINUTE, MAN.
WAIT A MINUTE.

1186
01:09:45,567 --> 01:09:46,900
WHAT'S WRONG?
- SIT DOWN.

1187
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:49,067
I WANT YOUR FULL ATTENTION!

1188
01:09:52,567 --> 01:09:54,333
- ALL RIGHT, MAN, YOU'VE GOT IT.

1189
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:02,733
- NOW, I CALLED YOU HERE
TO DO ME A FAVOR,

1190
01:10:02,733 --> 01:10:07,567
AND YOU TAKE OVER
THE WHOLE GODDAMN TOWN!

1191
01:10:07,567 --> 01:10:11,333
YOU HAD BRIGHT IDEAS RIGHT FROM
THE START, DIDN'T YA, OLD BUDDY?

1192
01:10:11,333 --> 01:10:13,067
AND I FELL FOR ALL THAT CRAP

1193
01:10:13,067 --> 01:10:16,567
ABOUT YOU NOT LEANING HARD
ON THE TOWN.

1194
01:10:16,567 --> 01:10:18,733
BUT IT'S WORSE NOW
THAN IT EVER WAS, MAN!

1195
01:10:18,733 --> 01:10:20,667
BECAUSE NOW
IT'S BROTHERS DOING IT!

1196
01:10:20,667 --> 01:10:25,233
SO WHAT GOOD DID IT DO BRINGING
YOU HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE?

1197
01:10:25,233 --> 01:10:26,400
- WELL, GO ON, MAN.

1198
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,500
DON'T STOP TALKING.
I'M LISTENING.

1199
01:10:32,067 --> 01:10:35,067
- YOU SENT YOUR PUNKS
TO BEAT HARLEY UP.

1200
01:10:35,067 --> 01:10:37,233
THEN YOU SENT 'EM AFTER ARETHA.

1201
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:42,400
- I DID WHAT?

1202
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:43,900
- NOW, YOU LISTEN.

1203
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:46,733
'CAUSE I'M ONLY
GONNA SAY IT ONCE, ROY.

1204
01:10:46,733 --> 01:10:48,967
I WANT YOUR PUNKS GONE.

1205
01:10:48,967 --> 01:10:50,333
OUT OF TOWN!

1206
01:10:50,333 --> 01:10:55,567
OR I SWEAR, MAN, I'LL PLANT THEM
IN THEIR OWN STINK.

1207
01:10:55,567 --> 01:10:58,233
- LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHIN'.

1208
01:10:58,233 --> 01:11:00,100
EVER SINCE WE HELPED YOU
GET RID OF THAT CHIEF

1209
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:01,300
AND THEM GODDAMN REDNECKS,

1210
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:03,267
YOU'VE BEEN
ACTING LIKE A GODDAMN FOOL.

1211
01:11:03,267 --> 01:11:05,433
YOU WON'T DO THIS,
YOU WON'T DO THAT.

1212
01:11:05,433 --> 01:11:07,800
YOU WON'T EVEN TAKE ANY OF THE
MONEY WE'RE TRYING TO GIVE YOU.

1213
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,667
AND NOW YOU BUST IN MY PLACE,

1214
01:11:09,667 --> 01:11:13,200
AND ACCUSE ME
OF PULLING ALL KINDA WEIRD SHIT!

1215
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:14,900
WELL, I AM TIRED OF IT.

1216
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:16,900
AND I AIN'T GONNA STAND
FOR NO MORE OF IT.

1217
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:19,733
NOW, JUST GET THIS,
GET THIS IN THAT HEAD OF YOURS.

1218
01:11:19,733 --> 01:11:21,067
I AM RUNNING THIS TOWN!

1219
01:11:21,067 --> 01:11:22,067
I'M RUNNING IT!

1220
01:11:22,067 --> 01:11:23,233
AND I GOT THE MAYOR

1221
01:11:23,233 --> 01:11:25,700
AND EVERYBODY ELSE
RIGHT BY THE BALLS,

1222
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:28,367
INCLUDING YOU.

1223
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:30,867
AND IF ANYBODY'S GONNA LEAVE,

1224
01:11:30,867 --> 01:11:33,600
IT AIN'T GONNA BE OLD ROY.

1225
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,733
IT'S GONNA BE YOU.

1226
01:11:35,733 --> 01:11:38,900
YOU DIG?

1227
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:41,900
- YEAH.

1228
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:43,200
THAT'S THE WAY IT IS, HUH?

1229
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:45,233
- YOU CALLED IT.

1230
01:11:45,233 --> 01:11:48,067
- ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.

1231
01:11:48,067 --> 01:11:50,333
ALL BETS ARE OFF.

1232
01:11:58,567 --> 01:12:02,067
- GIVE ME THE POLICE DEPARTMENT.

1233
01:12:02,067 --> 01:12:04,400
T.J., THIS IS ROY.

1234
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,567
YOU WANTED ME TO SET AN EXAMPLE
FOR THIS TOWN.

1235
01:12:06,567 --> 01:12:09,400
FROM NOW ON, EVERYBODY PAYS.

1236
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,067
SO LEAN ON HIM.

1237
01:12:15,333 --> 01:12:16,733
- HEY, HEY, HEY!

1238
01:12:16,733 --> 01:12:18,400
EVERYBODY HAVE A DRINK
AND BE SOMEBODY.

1239
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,067
MAKE GODDAMN SURE
YOU PAY FOR IT.

1240
01:12:20,067 --> 01:12:21,867
LOOKIT, WE GOT SOME WHITE PEOPLE
IN THE JOINT.

1241
01:12:21,867 --> 01:12:23,567
YOU GUYS HAVE A GOOD TIME.
ALL RIGHT?

1242
01:12:23,567 --> 01:12:25,567
WHAT'S GOING ON?
- I'M REALLY FINE.

1243
01:12:25,567 --> 01:12:28,567
- JEFF, IT SURE IS GOOD
TO BE HOME, BOY.

1244
01:12:28,567 --> 01:12:30,067
HEY, ARETHA.

1245
01:12:30,067 --> 01:12:32,067
HOW YOU DOIN'?

1246
01:12:32,067 --> 01:12:34,067
- THE DOCTOR SAID
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE RESTING.

1247
01:12:34,067 --> 01:12:35,867
- AH, SHIT.
I'M TIRED OF RESTING.

1248
01:12:35,867 --> 01:12:37,167
I WANT TO BE HERE
WITH MY FRIENDS.

1249
01:12:37,167 --> 01:12:38,567
- RIGHT ON, MAN!

1250
01:12:38,567 --> 01:12:40,867
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
I'M NOT GONNA ARGUE ABOUT IT.

1251
01:12:40,867 --> 01:12:42,667
- SAY, WHERE'S THE DUKE?

1252
01:12:42,667 --> 01:12:46,067
- HE'S TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS.

1253
01:14:09,067 --> 01:14:10,733
- I'M LOOKING FOR THE BIG SHOT.

1254
01:14:10,733 --> 01:14:11,800
- HE AIN'T HERE.

1255
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,733
- WE CAME EARLY.

1256
01:14:13,733 --> 01:14:14,900
T.J.
- YEAH.

1257
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:16,400
- JOSH.
- YEAH.

1258
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,333
- WE GOT A SPECIAL MESSAGE
FOR HIM.

1259
01:14:19,567 --> 01:14:21,233
- GO GET WORD TO DUKE.

1260
01:14:21,233 --> 01:14:22,333
- WHERE IS HE?

1261
01:14:26,567 --> 01:14:28,700
- SHOW 'EM
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, T.J.

1262
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:46,467
- IT ONLY TAKES ONE
LITTLE MATCH.

1263
01:14:46,467 --> 01:14:47,567
- YOU BASTARD!

1264
01:14:47,567 --> 01:14:48,667
- YOU CRAZY MOTHERFUCKER!

1265
01:14:52,933 --> 01:14:53,933
- IMAGINE THAT.

1266
01:14:53,933 --> 01:14:55,667
ASSAULTING A LAWMAN.
TAKE HIM IN.

1267
01:14:55,667 --> 01:14:57,633
- HARLEY.

1268
01:14:57,633 --> 01:14:58,700
- HANG ON, JOSH.

1269
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:01,233
MAN,
YOU'LL GET HER SOON ENOUGH.

1270
01:15:01,233 --> 01:15:04,567
- [shouting indistinctly]

1271
01:15:04,567 --> 01:15:05,867
- HARLEY!

1272
01:15:05,867 --> 01:15:07,200
HARLEY!

1273
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:10,133
- [shouting indistinctly]

1274
01:15:10,133 --> 01:15:13,067
- HARLEY!

1275
01:15:13,067 --> 01:15:15,233
HARLEY!

1276
01:15:15,233 --> 01:15:16,667
HARLEY!

1277
01:15:39,233 --> 01:15:40,567
- WHAT THE HECK
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

1278
01:15:40,567 --> 01:15:41,833
- ARETHA SENT ME.

1279
01:15:41,833 --> 01:15:43,733
T.J., HAMBONE, AND JOSH
ARE OVER AT THE CLUB ALABAM.

1280
01:15:43,733 --> 01:15:44,733
COME ON.
SHE NEEDS YOU.

1281
01:15:44,733 --> 01:15:46,167
- HOW MANY OUT FRONT?
- ONE.

1282
01:15:46,167 --> 01:15:47,167
- ALL RIGHT.

1283
01:15:54,367 --> 01:15:56,333
- HEY, KID, HOLD IT.

1284
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:12,467
- DUKE, THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE.

1285
01:16:12,467 --> 01:16:13,567
- WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE?

1286
01:16:13,567 --> 01:16:14,900
- ROY'S THREE HOODS
CAME IN HERE,

1287
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:16,567
AND THEY TRIED
TO BURN THE PLACE DOWN.

1288
01:16:16,567 --> 01:16:18,733
HARLEY TRIED TO STOP 'EM,
AND THEY DRAGGED HIM OFF.

1289
01:16:18,733 --> 01:16:19,733
- DRUG HIM WHERE?

1290
01:16:19,733 --> 01:16:21,067
- TO JAIL!

1291
01:16:21,067 --> 01:16:22,233
YOU GOT TO TALK TO ROY.

1292
01:16:22,233 --> 01:16:23,567
MAKE HIM LET HARLEY GO.

1293
01:16:23,567 --> 01:16:24,733
ROY'S YOUR FRIEND.

1294
01:16:24,733 --> 01:16:26,400
- NO, HE'S GONE TOO FAR NOW.

1295
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:27,700
IT'S TOO LATE TO TALK.

1296
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:29,567
- NO.
YOU CAN'T FIGHT HIM ALONE.

1297
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:31,567
THERE'LL BE FIVE OR SIX OF 'EM
AT THE JAIL.

1298
01:16:31,567 --> 01:16:34,733
- I GOT A PLAN THAT SHOULD
EVEN UP THE ODDS A LITTLE BIT.

1299
01:16:34,733 --> 01:16:36,567
- BUT, DUKE,
WHAT GOOD IS IT GONNA DO HARLEY

1300
01:16:36,567 --> 01:16:38,400
GETTING YOURSELF KILLED?

1301
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:39,500
DUKE!

1302
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:47,567
- STEVIE, YOU KNOW THAT ARMORY

1303
01:16:47,567 --> 01:16:48,900
YOU WAS TELLING ME ABOUT
ACROSS THE RIVER?

1304
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:49,900
YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS?

1305
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:50,900
- YEAH, I CAN FIND IT.

1306
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:52,067
- COME ON.
LET'S GO.

1307
01:16:58,233 --> 01:16:59,900
- ROY, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

1308
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:01,567
PLEASE, ROY, IT'S IMPORTANT.

1309
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:03,233
- GO AHEAD.
I'M LISTENING.

1310
01:17:03,233 --> 01:17:05,067
- I'M ASKING YOU
TO LET HARLEY GO.

1311
01:17:05,067 --> 01:17:06,567
IT WASN'T HIS FAULT.

1312
01:17:06,567 --> 01:17:08,900
HE JUST GOT A LITTLE CRAZY
WHEN YOUR BOYS CAME IN THE BAR

1313
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:10,233
AND TRIED TO BURN IT DOWN.

1314
01:17:10,233 --> 01:17:12,400
- WELL, MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO BLAME
DUKE FOR THAT, NOT ME.

1315
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:13,733
- WELL, DON'T TAKE IT OUT
ON HARLEY

1316
01:17:13,733 --> 01:17:15,233
BECAUSE OF YOUR FEELINGS
FOR DUKE.

1317
01:17:15,233 --> 01:17:17,067
- WELL, SINCE YOU'RE POINTING
FINGERS FOR WHAT HAPPENED,

1318
01:17:17,067 --> 01:17:19,067
WOMAN, IT WASN'T MY CHOICE;
IT WAS HIS.

1319
01:17:19,067 --> 01:17:21,233
I MEAN, DUKE'S GOT HIS HEAD
IN A WEIRD KINDA PLACE.

1320
01:17:21,233 --> 01:17:23,900
- NO, NO, HE DOES NOT
WANT TO GO AGAINST YOU.

1321
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:25,400
HE SAYS YOU'RE HIS FRIEND.

1322
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:28,400
- YEAH, WE'VE BEEN TIGHT,
BUT THAT COMES WITH RESPECT.

1323
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,400
AND RESPECT COMES FROM KNOWING
HOW IT IS IN THE STREETS.

1324
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:33,400
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO TO GET BY,
AND DOING IT,

1325
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:34,733
AND DOING IT WELL, DAMN WELL.

1326
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:35,900
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT.

1327
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:37,500
- BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

1328
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:39,200
IT'S JUST YOUR DAMN EGO!

1329
01:17:41,067 --> 01:17:42,833
- EGO?

1330
01:17:42,833 --> 01:17:44,233
NO.

1331
01:17:44,233 --> 01:17:46,667
IT'S HOW YOU SURVIVE.

1332
01:17:46,667 --> 01:17:48,567
- WELL, I WANT DUKE TO SURVIVE.

1333
01:17:48,567 --> 01:17:49,733
I WANT TO LOVE THAT MAN.

1334
01:17:49,733 --> 01:17:52,333
I DON'T WANT TO BURY HIM.

1335
01:17:52,333 --> 01:17:55,667
YOU JUST DON'T GIVE A DAMN
ABOUT ANYBODY, DO YOU?

1336
01:17:55,667 --> 01:17:58,067
- YOU LISTEN, ARETHA.

1337
01:17:58,067 --> 01:18:00,800
YOU SHOW ME ANYBODY WHO GIVES
A DAMN ABOUT ANYBODY ELSE,

1338
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,667
AND I'LL SHOW YOU A FOOL,
A DAMN FOOL

1339
01:18:03,667 --> 01:18:05,400
WHO GO THROUGH LIFE
WITH THEIR HANDS OUT

1340
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:06,767
BEGGING INSTEAD OF GRABBING.

1341
01:18:06,767 --> 01:18:09,567
DO YOU THINK ANYBODY
IN THIS TOWN IS ANY DIFFERENT?

1342
01:18:09,567 --> 01:18:11,567
THEY DON'T GIVE A DAMN
WHO GETS KILLED,

1343
01:18:11,567 --> 01:18:13,900
JUST SO LONG AS
THE DICE KEEP ROLLING,

1344
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:15,400
THE HOS KEEP HOIN',

1345
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:17,400
AND THE MONEY KEEPS FLOWIN'.

1346
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:20,400
IT ALL REVOLVES AROUND
THE BIG "G," BABY,

1347
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:21,700
THE BIG GREEN.

1348
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:22,900
EVERYBODY EVERYWHERE

1349
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:27,067
IS SCRATCHING
FOR WHAT THEY CAN GET.

1350
01:18:27,067 --> 01:18:30,233
I'M JUST SCRATCHING
A LITTLE HARDER.

1351
01:18:30,233 --> 01:18:33,867
- YOU POOR, SELFISH,
IGNORANT MAN.

1352
01:18:33,867 --> 01:18:36,533
HAVEN'T YOU EVER HAD THE GUTS
TO LOVE SOMEBODY ELSE?

1353
01:18:36,533 --> 01:18:38,900
- MAYBE.

1354
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:42,367
MAYBE I NEVER HAD A WOMAN
LIKE YOU TO FIGHT FOR ME.

1355
01:18:42,367 --> 01:18:44,833
MAYBE I EVEN ENVY DUKE FOR THAT.

1356
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:48,833
I'LL BE SEEING YA.

1357
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:30,400
- ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL?

1358
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:33,667
- OH, MAN, THAT MONSTER
COULD OPEN UP THE GATES OF HELL.

1359
01:20:53,233 --> 01:20:54,733
- WELL, WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

1360
01:20:54,733 --> 01:20:56,333
- WHERE'S T.J.?

1361
01:21:04,233 --> 01:21:05,967
T.J., I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

1362
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:15,067
WELL, I HAVEN'T BEEN TOO
FRIENDLY WITH YOU,

1363
01:21:15,067 --> 01:21:19,067
AND I THOUGHT I'D COME BY
AND APOLOGIZE.

1364
01:21:19,067 --> 01:21:20,400
- IS THAT RIGHT?

1365
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:23,233
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

1366
01:21:23,233 --> 01:21:25,333
AND I NEED A FAVOR.

1367
01:21:29,567 --> 01:21:31,567
- WELL, IT COSTS.

1368
01:21:31,567 --> 01:21:35,900
- WELL, YOU DO ME THIS ONE
LITTLE OLD FAVOR,

1369
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:39,400
AND I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WANT
AND SOME.

1370
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:40,800
- LIKE WHAT?

1371
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:44,900
- HARLEY, HE'S JUST AN OLD DRUNK
THAT I FEEL SORRY FOR.

1372
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,733
HE'S NO GOOD TO ANYBODY.

1373
01:21:46,733 --> 01:21:50,067
LET HIM GO.

1374
01:21:50,067 --> 01:21:51,233
- ALL RIGHT.

1375
01:21:51,233 --> 01:21:52,733
HAVE IT YOUR WAY.

1376
01:21:52,733 --> 01:21:54,367
AFTER--
- UH-UH.

1377
01:21:54,367 --> 01:21:56,067
BEFORE.

1378
01:21:56,067 --> 01:21:58,167
YOU LET HIM GO NOW,

1379
01:21:58,167 --> 01:22:03,067
AND IT'LL BE GOOD
BETWEEN YOU AND ME ALL THE WAY.

1380
01:22:03,067 --> 01:22:05,733
- OKAY, WE'LL DO IT YOUR WAY.

1381
01:22:05,733 --> 01:22:07,167

1421
01:26:15,733 --> 01:26:19,667
- I ALWAYS KNEW MY BUDDY
WAS A REAL MAN.

1422
01:26:19,667 --> 01:26:22,733
- IF ANYBODY HAD TOLD ME, ROY,

1423
01:26:22,733 --> 01:26:25,067
THAT WE WOULD BE
ON OPPOSITE SIDES

1424
01:26:25,067 --> 01:26:27,400
FIGHTING EACH OTHER--

1425
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:31,067
- YOU MIGHT NOT BELIEVE THIS,

1426
01:26:31,067 --> 01:26:34,800
BUT I NEVER LIED TO YOU.

1427
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:39,500
I NEVER SENT ANYONE
TO HASSLE HARLEY OR ARETHA.

1428
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:41,333
- HOW DID IT HAPPEN THEN, ROY?

1429
01:26:41,333 --> 01:26:42,733
- T.J.

1430
01:26:42,733 --> 01:26:44,400
HE WANTED US TO TANGLE.

1431
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,900
- LOOKS LIKE HE DID A GOOD JOB,
DIDN'T HE?

1432
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:49,400
IT'S DOWN TO ME AND YOU NOW,
RIGHT?

1433
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:53,067
I DON'T WANT TO SHOOT YOU, ROY.

1434
01:26:53,067 --> 01:26:57,400
I JUST WANT TO
BEAT THE HELL OUT OF YOU.

1435
01:26:57,400 --> 01:26:59,067
- IT'S YOUR DEAL.

1436
01:26:59,067 --> 01:27:01,900

1437
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:05,667

- HEY, HEY, STEVE, COME HERE.

1444
01:32:54,067 --> 01:32:56,400
DUKE AND ARETHA WANT TO BE ALONE
FOR A LITTLE BIT.

1445
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:58,667
BESIDES, YOU AND I GOT TO
GO HOME AND GET SOME SLEEP

1446
01:32:58,667 --> 01:33:00,633
SO WE CAN GET UP
AND GO TO SCHOOL TOMORROW.

1447
01:33:00,633 --> 01:33:01,900

1448
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:03,067

1449
01:33:03,067 --> 01:33:05,067
DON'T YOU WANT TO GROW UP
TO BE SOMEBODY?

01:33:05,067 --> 01:33:06,067
- I AM.

1451
01:33:06,067 --> 01:33:07,067
- WHAT?

1452
01:33:07,067 --> 01:33:08,400
- A MAN.

1453
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:10,567
- OKAY, MAN.
