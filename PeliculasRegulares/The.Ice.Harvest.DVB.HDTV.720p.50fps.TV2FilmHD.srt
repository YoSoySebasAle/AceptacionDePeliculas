1
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,240
People always say...

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,600
there's no such thing
as the perfect crime.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,120
But I don't agree with that.

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,920
If you plan things
carefully enough...

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,400
if you think through
every last detail...

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,680
if you have nerves of steel...

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,800
if you can remain calm
no matter what happens...

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,160
there should be no problem
you can't handle.

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,680
It's really all
a matter of character.

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,960
Of course,
if I had any character...

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,120
I wouldn't have stolen
$2 million from my boss.

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,520
Christmas Eve.

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,360
Ho, ho, fucking ho.

14
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,320
Well? How did it go?

15
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,000
Good. Went good.

16
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,240
How much?

17
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,400
A lot.

18
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,240
Am I gonna have to slap
the shit out of you? How much?

19
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,840
Vic, it's a great big
fucking pile of money.

20
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,360
$2,147,000 and change.

21
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,640
Hmm.

22
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,640
My God,
we're actually doing this.

23
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,600
No, we're not doing it.

24
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,120
It's already done.

25
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,720
Look, don't be so worried.
The hard part's done already.

26
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,560
Everything worked
just like you said it would.

27
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,520
Yeah. I guess.

28
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,000
Just act normal for a few hours and we're home free.

29
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,880
Okay?
Okay.

30
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,080
Okay.

31
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,720
You wanna take the money
and not me?

32
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,160
You wanna take the money?

33
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,000
No. I don't know.
I was just...

34
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,000
Well, if you wanna
take the money...

35
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,480
I mean, if you think
you can do a better job...

36
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,840
of guarding $2 million...

37
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,040
No, no, no. It should be you.
It should be you.

38
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,480
It's just we didn't
discuss that.

39
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,680
Are we through discussing it?

40
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,600
Or is there more to say
on the subject?

41
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,320
No, we're done.

42
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,600
Cool. Okay, shut the door.

43
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,160
Okay.
Okay. And, Charlie.

44
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,760
Yeah?
Act normal.

45
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,520
Yeah.

46
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,800
Oh, good! Good.
No, no, no.

47
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,680
No, no.
That's none of your business.

48
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,920
That's none of your
fucking business, all right?

49
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,840
I don't give a shit,
you toothless old whore.

50
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,480
Mom. Mom, I gotta go.

51
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,320
Don't you ever
touch her again!

52
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,040
Sidney! Sidney! No! No!

53
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,240
Don't hurt him.

54
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,320
Jeez, it's Christmas.

55
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,960
I love you.

56
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,520
Don't be an asshole.

57
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,920
Giselle, come on,
hop up there.

58
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,000
Merry Christmas, Sidney.

59
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,920
Hi, Charlie.
Didn't see you come in.

60
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,720
Who gave Rusti the shiner?

61
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,200
Her asshole boyfriend.
Some dipshit guitar player.

62
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,960
I swear to God,
if he comes in here again...

63
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,600
I'm gonna break his
fucking fingers.

64
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,640
Jesus, look at this place.

65
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,040
Just 'cause it's Christmas...

66
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,120
people all of a sudden
can't look at tits and ass?

67
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,400
Hi, Renata.
Hello, Counselor.

68
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,840
Not drinking tonight?

69
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,960
Just watching the floorshow.

70
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,200
Sidney, get my favorite
crooked lawyer a beer.

71
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,920
Actually, I'll take a rum.

72
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,080
Rum?
Mmm-hmm.

73
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,080
Rum and what?
Got any pineapple juice?

74
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,480
If you got one of those
little plastic umbrellas...

75
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,520
you can put that thing
in there.

76
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,000
What?

77
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,000
You look like the cat that swallowed the canary,
is what.

78
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,880
Like you're about
to belch a feather.

79
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,000
Been working on this acquisition deal for a while...

80
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,440
and it finally came through,
so...

81
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,960
Is this
a Bill Guerrard thing?

82
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,360
No, this is a... No.

83
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,360
Charlie Arglist.

84
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,640
Man of mystery.

85
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,480
This mean
you're rich, Charlie?

86
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,280
'Cause if you are,
we could run away together.

87
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,320
It's a thought.

88
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,080
Leaving Wichita.

89
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,560
Damn right, it's a thought.

90
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,840
Come the first of the year,
there'll be no more nude dancing in the city.

91
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,600
Which means
I'm fucked.

92
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,280
And don't tell me,
"Move out to the county," either.

93
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,960
Because Bill Guerrard's
got the county all to himself.

94
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,720
And I don't think
he's looking for competition.

95
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,800
Isn't that right,
Charlie?

96
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,600
You should let me
help you out.

97
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,080
If I was real smart,
I'd see this as an opportunity.

98
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,280
I could, you know.
Could what?

99
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,320
Help you.
You, Charlie?

100
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,280
If you had that photo...

101
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,320
Of Councilman Williams and Cupcake?
Mmm-hmm.

102
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,280
Vic's got that photo.

103
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,080
And I know
he won't give it to me...

104
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,760
because I've asked him nice
and he just won't.

105
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,480
Well, he wouldn't
have to know.

106
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,960
Well, that would be
just about...

107
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,080
the nicest Christmas present
you could give me, Charlie.

108
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,320
I'd have to think of something extra nice to give you in return.

109
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,640
No. Forget it.

110
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,200
I appreciate the thought,
but you'd be getting in way over your head.

111
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,480
Vic Cavanaugh and Bill Guerrard eat guys like you for lunch.

112
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,240
Sidney.
Yo.

113
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,600
I'll be back later
to close up.

114
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,960
It's against my religion
to give out personal advice...

115
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,640
but you should either sober up
or get real drunk.

116
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,000
That's fucking horrible.
Toss it and give me a beer.

117
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,320
"As Wichita falls,
so falls Wichita Falls."

118
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,720
Have you seen
Charlie tonight?

119
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,440
No. You just missed him.

120
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,640
How about Vic?
Seen Vic?

121
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,560
No. Not yet.

122
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,720
Of course,
it is Christmas.

123
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,200
Yeah, right.
Christmas.

124
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,120
"As Wichita falls,
so falls Wichita Falls."

125
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,640
What sort of fucking moron
would write such a thing?

126
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,520
Roy Gelles is in town.

127
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,960
Vic, did you hear me?

128
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,440
Roy Gelles is in town.

129
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,560
So what?
So he's looking for us.

130
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,640
So maybe he knows.
That's what.

131
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,240
Roy Gelles doesn't know shit.

132
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,960
Roy Gelles knows
what Bill Guerrard tells him.

133
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,720
And Bill doesn't know
shit either, so chill out.

134
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,560
Then what is he doing in town
on Christmas Eve?

135
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,440
Thank you, sweetie.
I appreciate it.

136
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,240
He's got a daughter in town.
Maybe he's visiting her.

137
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,600
Like you said,
it's Christmas.

138
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,760
That still doesn't explain
why he's at the Sweet Cage.

139
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,880
Listen, Charlie, don't go
squirrelly on me now, okay?

140
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,600
Just stick to the plan.

141
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,800
Maybe we should leave now.

142
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,960
Well, we're not going to.

143
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,560
In case you haven't noticed,
it's a fucking hockey rink out there.

144
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,120
Oh, my God,
what have I done?

145
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,400
What?
Nothing.

146
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,360
They say the rain is supposed to stop by midnight.

147
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
By 5:00 in the morning,
we're in Kansas City...

148
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,720
where we enjoy a leisurely
breakfast at the airport...

149
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,680
and by 8:00, we're on a plane
to someplace warm...

150
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,400
where it's against
the fucking law to rain, okay?

151
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,520
Click.

152
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,640
Vic? Vic?

153
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,520
Fuck me.

154
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa!

155
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,480
Fuck.

156
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,360
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

157
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,640
Hi, Mr. Arglist.
I didn't recognize you.

158
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,640
Hi.

159
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,360
Yeah. Boy, I didn't realize
how slippery that was.

160
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,560
Yeah.
Didn't you notice all the cars off the side of the road?

161
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,880
I wasn't paying close enough attention,
I guess.

162
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,640
You going somewhere,
Mr. Arglist? No.

163
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,840
Hey, none of my business,
right?

164
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,120
I'd be careful, though.

165
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,600
We're gonna have this freezing rain on and off all night...

166
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,160
so I'd stay off the road...

167
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,080
and probably take it easy
with that, too.

168
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,040
The next guy
who pulls you over...

169
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,280
might be somebody
who don't know any better.

170
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,560
I definitely owe you one.

171
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,600
All right. It's Tyler.
It's R.P. Tyler.

172
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,360
Remember my name
to Mr. Guerrard.

173
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,640
I will.

174
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,120
What is it?

175
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,600
Just kidding. Just kidding.

176
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,120
Have a merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

177
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,920
Dickhead.

178
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,080
I'm not working Christmas for no fucking money, Dennis.

179
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,320
I'm not.

180
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,240
I could be at home spending Christmas with my kids.

181
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,320
Your kids with your husband, Francie.
They in Denver.

182
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,240
Fuck you very much
for throwing that in my face.

183
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,600
Look, you can cry all you want,
but you're still going on.

184
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,720
You've been here long enough
to know the goddamn drill.

185
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,040
You wanna work on the hot nights,
you gotta work on the cold.

186
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,400
Fuck it, Dennis.

187
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,400
I'm not paying Bill Guerrard
a $100 stage rental fee...

188
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,080
so some old pervert can look at my twat on Christmas fucking Eve!

189
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,240
Go dance.

190
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,160
Tell you what.
Since it's Christmas Eve...

191
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,640
stage rental's on the house.

192
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,040
Hi, Charlie.
I didn't see you come in.

193
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,080
Hi.

194
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,080
You mean it?

195
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,480
Uh-huh.

196
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,960
Gee, thanks.

197
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,160
Since when are you a friend
of the working girl?

198
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,680
It's Christmas, Dennis.
It's God's birthday.

199
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,640
Well, hello there, Councilman.

200
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,320
So, Dennis,
you're saying you haven't seen Charlie, huh?

201
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,640
Charlie? No.
Why do you ask?

202
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,160
How about Vic Cavanaugh?
You seen him?

203
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,840
Dude, I don't do henchmen,
man. I do strippers.

204
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,960
Hey, Frankie.
Is Vic around?

205
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,640
He's sitting over there.

206
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,920
Let me get you a drink.
Thanks.

207
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,160
Victor.

208
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,360
You know, us being seen together,
tonight of all nights...

209
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,960
is probably not so smart.

210
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,520
I would have called...

211
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,600
but I had
a bit of a situation.

212
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,600
So, guess who's
over at the Tease.

213
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,760
Roy Gelles.
I just spoke to him.

214
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,000
You just spoke to him?
Yeah, I spoke to him.

215
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,120
Come on, man. What the fuck...
What did he say?

216
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,480
What's wrong with you?
He just called to wish me a merry Christmas.

217
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,920
Well, what
did you say?

218
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,560
Well, I wished him
a merry Christmas.

219
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,800
What did he say?

220
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,400
What the hell
are you so worried about?

221
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,920
Vic, I sue people
for a living.

222
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,080
You sell them pornography.

223
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,800
Roy hurts people.

224
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,680
He makes it so their knees and elbows bend in both directions.

225
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,920
That worries me.

226
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,000
Let me ask you something.

227
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,320
Did I make a mistake when I made you my partner in this deal?

228
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,360
Hey! You didn't make me your partner.
I am the one who showed you...

229
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,120
how to steal $2 million worth
of Bill Guerrard's money.

230
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,160
Then I showed you how to do it so he wouldn't know what you'd done...

231
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,560
till it was too late.

232
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,840
What we've done, okay?

233
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,200
Remember that.
What we've done.

234
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,280
And here's the thing
about what we've done.

235
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,760
Mr. Arglist?

236
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,520
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

237
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,160
Left to yourself,
you'd still be on a barstool...

238
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,880
thinking about
how it could be done...

239
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,840
if somebody had the balls to do it.
Which is me.

240
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,560
Don't poke, Vic, okay?
I get it.

241
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,480
Hello.

242
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,280
Yeah.

243
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,560
I know that.
I know that.

244
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,840
I know that, too.

245
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,400
All right,
I gotta get out of here.

246
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,720
So, I'll meet you
at the Velvet Touch at 1:00.

247
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,960
Just like we planned,
all right? Who was that?

248
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,760
Not that it's any
of your fucking business.

249
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,720
That was my wife.

250
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,760
Thank you.
Thank you, sweetie.

251
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,560
The lovely Gladys,
of whom you've heard me speak over the years...

252
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,520
with tenderness
and affection.

253
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,440
She was wondering
if I'm gonna be home...

254
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,200
in time for midnight worship.

255
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,120
I thought that's who you were... Oh,
having dinner with? No, no.

256
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,920
See, Gladys is
on the Subway Diet.

257
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,440
She has a couple of foot-longs at lunch,
couple at dinner.

258
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,000
Buys her clothes
from Omar the Tentmaker.

259
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,240
But perhaps I'm being unkind.

260
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,160
Anyway, let me out of here.

261
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,560
Hey, Vic.
Yeah?

262
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,800
If you wouldn't mind, you know,
in case we get separated...

263
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,160
tell me where the money is.

264
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,440
Excuse me, Mr. Arglist.

265
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,080
That's hilarious.

266
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,120
He's something else.
Yeah.

267
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,000
Mr. Arglist, I wonder
if I might have a word?

268
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,480
Sure. Vic!

269
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,920
Mr.
Arglist, I'm sorry to bother you.

270
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,880
I believe
you can help us.

271
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,240
Peter Van Heuten is a friend of yours, right?

272
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,640
Yes.

273
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,520
He's in no shape to drive...

274
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,920
Charlie fucking Arglist!

275
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,520
Yo ho ho, mo-fo!
What are you doing here, man?

276
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,400
Hiya, Pete.
Merry Christmas!

277
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,320
It's good to see you!
Good to see you!

278
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,880
What are you doing here, man?
The real people are in there.

279
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,320
Let's go in here.

280
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,160
Everybody, I want you to meet...
Listen up, a friend of mine...

281
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,000
This is Charlie Arglist,
the most talented and handsome...

282
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,440
mob lawyer in all of Kansas.

283
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,440
I really wish you wouldn't do that.
Come on.

284
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,520
Come on.
That was Vic Cavanaugh you were hanging out with back there.

285
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,640
So what?
Hey, let me ask you a question.

286
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,600
Is it true that one time...

287
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,600
he cut the hand off of somebody who stuck their fingers...

288
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,840
up the twazzallah of a dancer over at Tease-O-Rama?

289
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,920
Look around at the bar.

290
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,560
Do you see a lot
of one-armed men in here?

291
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,160
Because if they chopped off
the hand...

292
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,960
of every guy who tried
that with a stripper...

293
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,840
half the men in Wichita
would be wearing hooks.

294
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,960
Are you trying to tell me that these are just normal guys you work for?

295
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,080
What are you doing here?

296
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,240
Trying to get my ashes hauled,
like everybody else!

297
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,160
Noël, Joyeux Noëll

298
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,160
It's all right.
He's drunk.

299
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,040
Sarabeth isn't performing
that function anymore?

300
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,640
Did she do that
for you oftentimes...

301
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,000
throughout your saga?

302
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,200
Occasionally.
Not very often. Mmm-hmm.

303
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,640
Is she still wearing
flannel to bed?

304
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,840
Silly me.

305
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,160
I thought, until I met
and married Sarabeth...

306
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,880
that it was
only little children...

307
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,280
who wore those things with the feet sewn on the bottom.

308
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,760
You could have warned me
about that.

309
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,640
And I'm actually
being kind of serious here.

310
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,320
I tried to, Pete.
I really did.

311
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,480
Yeah, bullshit. I was the end
of your alimony problem.

312
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,000
That's what I was.
Like hell. You were in love.

313
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,160
With my wife.

314
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,480
Love.

315
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,480
Someday somebody is going
to tally up the cost...

316
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,560
of that particular illusion.

317
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,760
Hey.
Yeah?

318
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,560
Did you ever go and...

319
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,160
The strippers?
Yeah, occasionally.

320
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,440
Yeah?
Yeah, sure.

321
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,920
When I'm really desperate...

322
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,240
or completely shit-faced,
or generally have my head up my ass.

323
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,800
I'm all those three things
right now, baby. Let's go!

324
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,280
So how you doing
otherwise, buddy?

325
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,800
Great. Great. Really great.

326
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,640
Drawing a lot of buildings.
Making a fucking fortune.

327
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,800
Well, listen.
I gotta make a phone call.

328
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,040
If you just hold down
the fort here and remain calm.

329
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,480
Remain calm.

330
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,640
Big mob lawyer.

331
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,120
Sweet Cage.
Sidney, is Renata back yet?

332
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,040
No. She just called.
Said she's on her way.

333
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,640
All right, listen...

334
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,760
when she gets back,
you tell her I have that present...

335
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,000
that I mentioned for her
earlier and not to leave.

336
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,200
Okay? Bye.

337
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,400
Mr. Arglist.
Councilman.

338
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,920
I wonder if we might
have a quiet word.

339
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,480
Actually, I'm kind of...

340
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,480
Would you be good enough to deliver a message from me to Mr.
Guerrard?

341
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,040
Wichita is a community
of good people, Mr. Arglist.

342
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,160
Christian people.

343
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,880
Yeah, half of them are in this very bar trying to get laid.

344
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,560
That may well be.
But my point is, some time ago...

345
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,560
in a moment of weakness,
I did a very foolish thing.

346
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,960
And that foolish thing
was photographed.

347
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,640
I believe that photo is in the possession of a Mr.
Vic Cavanaugh...

348
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,040
an associate of yours,
who refuses to surrender it...

349
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,200
despite several generous
offers for its purchase...

350
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,320
the last of which,
delivered not 10 minutes ago.

351
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,040
People can be stubborn.

352
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,720
Do you think Mr.
Guerrard would be able to persuade Mr. Cavanaugh...

353
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,760
Oh.

354
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,320
...to reconsider if he understood his own interests in the matter?

355
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,320
Well, Mr.
Guerrard is one of the most persuasive men I know.

356
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,960
What kind of figures
are we talking about here?

357
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,560
Are we talking about four?
Five? Six?

358
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,440
Five, Mr. Arglist.
Low five.

359
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,200
Councilman, I think
the photo in question...

360
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,280
might be closer than you can possibly imagine.

361
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,600
You've given me hope, Mr.
Arglist. Merry Christmas.

362
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,720
Wonderful season, isn't it?
So full of mutual understanding.

363
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,000
Yeah.

364
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,920
You gotta know the whole culture is in the toilet...

365
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,360
if a guy dressed like that can get laid in a place like this.

366
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,360
Hey, you're flipping off the mob here,
just so you know.

367
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,840
Did I mention to you that I really wish you wouldn't do that?

368
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,040
Yeah.

369
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,960
M-O-B, mob. Okay?
All right, let's go.

370
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,880
Right back at you, huh?

371
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,320
And there, that one, too.
There, see?

372
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,800
That's my chair in there.

373
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,880
You wanna know the truth?

374
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,120
I can't fill it.

375
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,320
Neither could I,
if it makes you feel any better.

376
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,600
Listen, Charlie.

377
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,640
Before we go in,
there's something I have to tell you.

378
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,640
It's been on my conscience,
and you can punch me if you want to.

379
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,600
I don't think
I'm gonna want to.

380
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,400
Back when you and Sarabeth were still married that last year...

381
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,400
Uh-huh.

382
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,400
...she and I
were fucking.

383
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,640
No kidding?

384
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,520
Like minks. Everywhere.
Kitchen table, your bed, garage.

385
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,960
Wow.

386
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,640
Jesus, Charlie,
we were friends.

387
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,080
It doesn't make you angry?

388
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,800
Actually, it makes me curious.

389
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,120
Makes me wonder
who she's fucking now.

390
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,440
Yo ho ho!
Merry fucking Christmas!

391
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,840
Guess who I brought with me?
Ghost of Christmas Past.

392
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,520
Ooh.

393
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,440
Marley!
Get the fuck in here.

394
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,680
Hey, everybody.

395
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,000
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

396
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,040
Hello, Charlie.

397
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,240
Come in
and have a piece of pie.

398
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,160
Hi, Dottie.
No, thank you. I'm fine.

399
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,720
I just wanted to stop in and wish you all a very merry...

400
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,520
Screw the pie, you old harpy.
We're here for dinner.

401
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,840
Turkey, cranberry,
stuffing, the works!

402
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,880
Thanks. Yeah.

403
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,000
Yeah. Motherfucker.
Yeah.

404
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,040
Turkey-alurkey.

405
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,760
Pathetic.

406
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,000
What did you say, Stan?

407
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,920
You two are pathetic.
Makes me ashamed to be a man.

408
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,320
I'm pathetic?
I'm pathetic?

409
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,520
Who paid for that
hip replacement...

410
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,760
your insurance company
wouldn't cover, huh?

411
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,000
Dad, tell me that!

412
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,280
And who took care of your mortgage
payments when you were recuperating?

413
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,080
And when you're
done with that...

414
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,600
maybe you could
explain to me who it was...

415
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,520
raised his only daughter...

416
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,360
to be a cold, gossiping,
hypocritical bitch!

417
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,400
So, Spence, how you doing?
Go to hell.

418
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,000
Don't you talk
to your father that way.

419
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,840
He's not my father.
He didn't even send us presents this year.

420
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,240
I hate his guts.

421
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,680
Is that right, Charlie?

422
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,040
You didn't even send them
any Christmas presents?

423
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,120
No.
Christmas is tomorrow.

424
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,720
Guess what, Daddy?
I was in the Christmas play.

425
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,720
So what?

426
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,640
All you were was Tiny Tim's sister,
and you didn't even have any lines!

427
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,040
And he didn't even
come to watch!

428
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,640
He would have,
but Mommy didn't send an invitation!

429
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,760
I'm sorry, Charlie,
but maybe you should go now.

430
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,720
And perhaps you would give
Pete a ride home?

431
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,480
Sarabeth and the children
will be staying here tonight.

432
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,080
Okay.
Yeah.

433
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,200
Listen, sweetie,
I'm gonna go...

434
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,320
and I'm gonna come back and visit you tomorrow,
all right?

435
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,640
Don't believe him, Melissa.
He's lying. All he ever does is lie.

436
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,800
Shut up!

437
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,680
Merry Christmas, Charlie.

438
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,360
On the whole,
I thought that went well.

439
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,280
Yeah, it's good
to see the family.

440
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,280
What do you say, one more drink?
The night is young.

441
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,680
All right, one more,
that's it. Okay. One more.

442
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,720
Melissa really misses you.

443
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,440
Not Spencer. He hates me.

444
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,720
You just gotta give him time.
He'll come around.

445
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,760
Your leaving came
at an awkward age for him.

446
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,680
A clean break is best.

447
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,400
No, a clean break is easiest.
On you.

448
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,080
Oh.

449
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,480
Are you saying
you have no regrets?

450
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,560
Don't believe in them.

451
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,920
Bullshit.
Everybody has regrets.

452
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,720
Guys our age,
what else is there?

453
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,520
I ever tell you
my father was a twin?

454
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,160
Identical?
Fraternal.

455
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,720
Looked a lot alike, though,
him and my uncle.

456
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,240
Different temperaments
completely.

457
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,760
My father, he's a cop.

458
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,520
By-the-book guy.

459
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,320
Believed in the law.
Wanted his only son to be a lawyer.

460
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,800
Drank in moderation,
didn't smoke.

461
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,440
Kept up his
life insurance premiums.

462
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,400
Voted in every election,
not just for president.

463
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,440
Let me guess.
Uncle didn't vote.

464
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,640
He said he didn't want
to encourage the bastards.

465
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,680
In and out of jail
from the time he was 16...

466
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,360
drunk all the time,
fucked everything that walked.

467
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,720
Won a fortune playing poker,
lost it all the same way.

468
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,840
Lost an eye in a fight.
Half his life...

469
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,000
So what you're trying to say is,
you take after your uncle.

470
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,760
I wasn't finished.

471
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,800
My father was 54...

472
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,040
when he died of a massive embolism,
right here in Wichita.

473
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,480
My uncle
died the very next day...

474
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,960
in a car wreck in California.

475
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,080
So the point is...

476
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,000
it is futile to regret.

477
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,680
You do one thing,
you do another...

478
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,040
I mean, so what?

479
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,200
What's the difference?
Same result.

480
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,560
How many of these lights
you gonna sit through?

481
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,000
See if I tell you
another fucking story.

482
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,080
Sorry, guys, we're closed.

483
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,480
We just want one drink.
Each.

484
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,240
My friend's a mobster.
You might know that, you might not.

485
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,960
I'll tell you what.
I'll give you one, on the house...

486
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,400
if you drink it up and leave.

487
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,040
But I'm not opening
my register back up.

488
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,880
Thank you, gorgeous.

489
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:09,080
Do you know where this last drink is going to take me?

490
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,720
To that perfect stage
of drunkenness.

491
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,160
And then, do you know
what I'm going to do?

492
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,360
I'm going to go straight home,
go to bed, and dream of you.

493
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,400
I don't think I'd pursue that particular line.

494
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,040
You with him?
Yeah.

495
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,440
Makes no difference.
It's okay.

496
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,480
It's a free country.

497
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,480
And any man can dream
anything he wants to dream.

498
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,840
And tonight
I'm gonna dream of you.

499
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,760
All right, I gotta make a phone call.
I'll be right back.

500
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,160
Okay, behave yourself.

501
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,240
Sweet Cage.
Sidney, is Renata back yet?

502
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,800
No. Not yet.

503
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,320
But you won't believe
who just walked in.

504
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,840
Roy Gelles? No.
Forget Roy Gelles, will you?

505
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,800
That fucking guitar player.

506
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,760
The one who gave Rusti
the black eye.

507
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,120
What's going on?

508
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,440
I swear to God...

509
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,080
if he gives Rusti any trouble,
I'm gonna break his fucking fingers.

510
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,360
What's your name,
jock strap?

511
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,680
Which hand should I break?

512
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,840
I don't have the answer
to that question, Sidney.

513
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,000
Listen, when Renata gets
back in, just tell her...

514
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,680
I know.
You got a present for her.

515
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,800
I hope you don't think she's gonna fuck you, Charlie.

516
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,360
Think it's out of the question?
Absolutely.

517
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,480
Merry Christmas, Sidney.

518
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,080
Yeah.
Merry Christmas, Charlie.

519
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,120
Would you like to know what you're going to be wearing...

520
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,800
in my little dream?
Disregard him.

521
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,880
Hmm.

522
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,080
That fish necklace,
and that's it.

523
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,720
Completely disregard him
tonight. He's drunk.

524
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,160
Except for that necklace,
you're gonna be one naked little Christian.

525
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,160
Pete, not that you're asking
for my advice...

526
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,360
but, listen, I would shut
the fuck up right now.

527
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,800
Yeah.

528
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,640
Hey. Sporty Nuts.
Pete.

529
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,000
If you don't get laid tonight,
fish necklace or no...

530
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,240
it's 'cause
you're not trying, my son.

531
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,960
Pete, I hope you're
listening to me.

532
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,480
And if you play
your cards right...

533
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,640
this hot-assed
little Jesus freak...

534
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,000
just might initiate you into the Campus Crusade for Cunnilingus.

535
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,520
Do you notice that I am practicing non-violent resistance...

536
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,880
in honor
of the Christmas holiday?

537
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,360
Because that's the way...

538
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,280
baby Jesus
would have wanted me to do it.

539
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:31,480
That was unpleasant.
I think I scraped my tummy.

540
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,760
Hmm.

541
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,240
Oh, my nuts.

542
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,240
I got it. I got it.

543
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,120
You sure?
I got it.

544
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,000
Oh, fuck.

545
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,600
Jesus Christ, Pete,
you had the whole goddamn parking lot.

546
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,840
Why did you have
to throw up in the car?

547
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:19,600
I think that boy drove one of my testicles up into my body cavity.

548
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,080
Are you sure?

549
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,640
I don't know
where else it could be.

550
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,320
Okay, bounce me.

551
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,520
Again, again.

552
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,800
Now, three times fast.
Three times fast!

553
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,480
If you're trying to shake the money out of his pockets...

554
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,120
you gotta turn him
upside down first.

555
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,600
Right.

556
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,160
Think that did it.

557
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,440
One, two. Yup.

558
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,600
We did it.

559
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,680
You have a good night,
Mr. Arglist.

560
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,280
Good night, now.

561
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,040
Take me home, buddy.
I know my limit.

562
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,280
You are home,
for Christ's sake, Pete.

563
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,800
Pants, pants, pants.

564
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,880
I got it, I got it,
I got it.

565
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,360
Do you remember
when you used to live here?

566
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,880
Do you remember?
Yeah. I remember.

567
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,840
This used to be your house.
Come on.

568
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,640
I got it, I got it, I got it.

569
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,760
I know the way.

570
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,800
Are you sure?
Buddy, I got it.

571
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,600
All right.
I got it, okay?

572
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,880
Man down.

573
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,360
Man down.

574
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,960
I thought I had it.

575
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,680
But I didn't.

576
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,120
I didn't have it.

577
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,760
Man still down.

578
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,920
Man remains down.

579
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,880
Get some rest, pal.

580
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,440
Stop! Stop it!

581
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,960
Oh, fuck!

582
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,960
Oh my God!

583
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,880
Hi, Rusti.
Is Renata inside?

584
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,560
Oh, fuck!

585
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,240
Charlie, did you meet Donny?
Ronny.

586
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,600
Yeah.
Donny had this giant crush on me back in high school.

587
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,960
Only I had no idea.

588
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,800
We had two classes together,
chemistry and something else.

589
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,000
We can't remember.

590
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,960
Anyway, so we're talking...

591
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,480
and remembering old times,
and guess what?

592
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,400
We're getting married.

593
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,760
Oh, fuck!

594
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,440
Great.
Oh, God!

595
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,320
Listen. Let this night
be a reminder to you...

596
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,680
when you think
about using her...

597
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,960
As a punching bag.
All right?

598
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
All right?
Don't... All right? Sidney.

599
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,560
Sidney.
All right.

600
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,040
You do hear that siren, right?
Yeah, yeah.

601
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,800
Look, Charlie,
my blood was up, you know?

602
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,280
My mother's always telling me
I need to work on my anger.

603
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,360
Channel my energies
into something more positive.

604
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,800
Makes me
want to slap her silly.

605
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,000
Jesus Christ, Sidney,
you don't hit your mother, do you?

606
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,280
Christ, no.

607
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,000
Charlie, I'm talking about desires here,
that's all.

608
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,400
Urges and shit.

609
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,480
Anyway, I gotta go.
Gotta pick up the kids.

610
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,920
We're going to Six Flags
tomorrow.

611
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,240
Good.
Yeah.

612
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,800
Is she back?
Oh, yeah.

613
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,160
She's gonna be pissed at me
'cause I'm leaving early.

614
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,080
That's okay. I got something for her,
to cheer her up.

615
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,400
Damn.
You can read the fine print on the lubricant.

616
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,080
I didn't know you smoked.
I don't.

617
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,320
I guess I thought you'd be happier.
Happy?

618
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,560
I'm fucking ecstatic.
Can't you tell?

619
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,280
And in return for this,
you want exactly what?

620
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,160
Nothing.

621
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,960
Nothing.

622
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:07,480
Charlie, I've been hearing weird things about you all night.

623
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,560
Like what?

624
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,200
Like waiving stage rentals
over at the Tease-O-Rama.

625
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,640
Comping dancers' drinks?
Not like you at all.

626
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,800
And now this.

627
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,840
Oh, my God.

628
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,640
You are leaving town.

629
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,600
Have you and Vic
been dipping into the till?

630
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,200
Steal from Bill?
That would be crazy.

631
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:51,200
Well, then there's only one
other possible explanation.

632
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,000
You're in love with me.

633
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,360
I've always liked you.

634
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,240
I've noticed.

635
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,920
Tell you what.
What?

636
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,240
Give me 45 minutes to close up,
then meet me at my apartment.

637
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,440
All right.

638
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,240
Okay.

639
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,440
I forgot. Vic called.

640
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,480
Said to tell you that you were right and he was wrong.

641
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,160
Something about a guy you thought might be looking for you.

642
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,680
Yeah?
He is.

643
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,920
This was when?

644
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,920
About half an hour ago.

645
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,160
Vic said for you to meet him at the Velvet Touch as soon as you can.

646
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,280
You sure nothing's going on?
Not a thing.

647
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,680
Don't forget to come back,
okay?

648
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,240
I won't.

649
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,760
Vic.

650
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,880
Harder. Oh, yeah.

651
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,560
Vic, hate to interrupt!

652
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,600
Yeah, baby.

653
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,920
Come on, Vic.

654
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,360
Don't stop.

655
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,720
Almost there.

656
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,640
Keep going. Keep going.

657
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,360
Vic?

658
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,560
Fuck! Oh, fuck.

659
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,760
Mr. Arglist?

660
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,720
Oh, fuck!

661
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,040
Ouch, that had to hurt.
Yeah, it sure did.

662
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,080
What were you doing?

663
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,960
I was gonna be sick,
but now I'm okay.

664
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,600
Different car.

665
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,120
Yeah, it's my ex-wife's.
It's a long story.

666
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,040
You don't look too good.

667
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,200
You want me to call somebody
to come get you?

668
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,080
No, no, I'm fine.
I'm headed home anyway.

669
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,200
Okay, Mr. Arglist.
You go home and get some sleep.

670
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,840
And don't forget to put in a good word for me with Mr.
Guerrard.

671
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,000
I will, Officer.
Officer what?

672
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,320
Taylor.
Tyler.

673
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,520
But it's pretty close, though. Yeah.

674
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,640
All right, tell you what.
When you go home...

675
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,600
I don't think I'd come back out again tonight,
if I were you.

676
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,960
No, I probably won't.
Good night to you.

677
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,840
Happy holidays.
Okay. All the best.

678
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,760
Oh, fuck.

679
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,520
Hello?
Renata.

680
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,800
Charlie.
Listen.

681
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,960
You were right.
Vic and I have been skimming.

682
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,040
Well, duh.

683
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,120
I think Roy Gelles
must have found out...

684
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,680
and I think
he might have killed Vic.

685
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,040
That's terrible.

686
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,440
So, I was thinking it might be best if I left town.

687
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,680
I was wondering
if you wanted to come with me.

688
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,680
You have the money?
What?

689
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,000
Which...
The money we're talking about.

690
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,760
That you and Vic
have been skimming.

691
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,360
Try to keep up, okay?

692
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,880
No. Vic had it.

693
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,920
So, your idea is that we should run away together and be poor?

694
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,240
I thought I'd give it a shot.

695
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,800
Here's the thing, though.

696
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,160
Roy wouldn't have killed Vic unless Vic told him where the money was...

697
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,920
which means Roy has it now.

698
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,400
Well, why don't you sneak up
behind him...

699
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:20,000
and hit him over the head
with something and take it?

700
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,560
Me? You want me
to sneak up on Roy Gelles?

701
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,160
Charlie, think of this
as your defining moment.

702
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,400
This is your chance
to be something more.

703
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,000
Like a murderer?

704
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,320
This is your chance
to start over, Charlie.

705
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,480
Our chance,
if that's what you want.

706
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,000
If that's what I want.

707
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,240
Listen, I just gotta
ask you one thing.

708
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,760
What?

709
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,400
I didn't have
a specific question planned.

710
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,200
Nothing, sorry.

711
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,480
Well, then...

712
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,120
Gladys.

713
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,680
Gladys, it's me,
Charlie Arglist.

714
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,360
Gladys, where is Vic?

715
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,280
It's a sweet thought, Charlie.
But she's already dead.

716
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,680
Jesus Christ,
you scared the fuck out of me!

717
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,360
I thought you were dead!
I thought Roy killed you.

718
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,000
Well, he was going to.

719
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,800
But he got sidetracked.
You should have been there.

720
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,520
He actually threatened
to shoot Gladys...

721
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,640
if I didn't tell him
where the money was.

722
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:21,680
But I think he was counting...

723
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,080
on a level of commitment and affection between her and me...

724
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,440
that just simply wasn't there.

725
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,680
Where is he now?

726
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,760
Follow me.
You're gonna love this.

727
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,120
Hey, Roy!

728
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,200
You still alive in there?

729
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,160
You didn't asphyxiate yet,
did you?

730
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,040
Hey, Vic.

731
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,640
Come a little closer,
so I can talk to you.

732
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:00,840
What's that, Roy?

733
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,040
Jesus fucking Christ!

734
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,680
Damn it, I took his gun.

735
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,640
Guess he must have
another one.

736
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,040
Must have.

737
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,000
Is that you, Arglist?

738
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:20,600
Hi, Roy.

739
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,680
When I get out of here,
I'm gonna kill you.

740
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:23,840
You do know that, right?

741
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,000
Roy, you must be
one fucking optimist...

742
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,200
if you think you're ever
getting out of that trunk.

743
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,800
Let me out, Arglist.
I'm your only hope.

744
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,680
Actually, you just told me you'd kill me if you got out, Roy.

745
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,400
I didn't mean it.
Sounded like you did.

746
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,760
I was just pissed off.

747
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,720
It's cramped in here
and I'm claustrophobic.

748
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,280
Come on.
Give me a hand.

749
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,760
Wanna go to the trunk?

750
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,520
Already tried it.
Let's go to the back seat.

751
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,880
Ready?
Yeah.

752
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,880
That's one
big motherfucker.

753
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,280
One, two, three!

754
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,480
Oh, God damn.

755
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:14,160
We're gonna have to
take the door off.

756
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,280
It's not gonna fit.
You want me to get the Mercedes?

757
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,320
Mercedes? What Mercedes?

758
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,320
My ex-wife's.
It's a long story. Don't ask.

759
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,320
There is no way that this thing is gonna fit...

760
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,080
in a piece-of-shit Mercedes
if it don't go in a Lincoln.

761
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,480
No, they're surprisingly
spacious, Vic.

762
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,280
I'm offering you a deal,
Arglist.

763
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,880
Jesus fucking shit.
Give me something.

764
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,280
Don't be an idiot.
God damn it.

765
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,760
Fucking shut up!

766
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,400
Shut the fuck up in there!

767
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,120
You just keep
your fucking mouth shut, okay?

768
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,760
Piece of fucking shit!
God damn it!

769
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:59,000
You keep that up,
you're gonna spring the lock.

770
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,440
What the fuck were you thinking?
Why didn't you just shoot him?

771
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,200
And then you could have
put him in the trunk...

772
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,680
and you wouldn't need
that footlocker.

773
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,720
Because I want the pleasure
of seeing his big ass...

774
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,800
sink to the bottom of Lake Bascombe!
That's why!

775
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,840
Hey, Roy. Roy?

776
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,240
I can't wait for you
to feel the icy water...

777
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,240
seeping into this trunk...

778
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:26,920
shriveling your balls
before you drown!

779
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,160
What if he's reloaded?

780
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,560
Well, he's folded up in there
like a card table.

781
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,440
How the hell
is he gonna reload?

782
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,280
I don't know, Vic.

783
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,520
She could never
do anything right.

784
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,120
Jesus.

785
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,160
What?

786
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:23,480
Nothing.
I just thought you were gonna put Roy in the trunk.

787
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:26,080
The footlocker might not fit
in the back seat, is all.

788
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,840
You're the one
been going on...

789
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,320
about how spacious
these fuckers are.

790
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,720
And now you're saying
it won't fit?

791
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,240
It might. I'm not sure,
is what I'm saying.

792
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,240
One night driving a Mercedes,
and already you're an asshole.

793
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,920
Come on,
help me get this thing.

794
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,080
Ow! God damn it!

795
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,560
If I could open
the fucking door...

796
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,120
Okay.

797
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,840
Jesus, Charlie, you're right.
This thing is spacious.

798
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,960
There's no way it would
have gone in a Lincoln.

799
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,960
Give me the key.
Oh, yeah.

800
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,120
All right.
I gotta get my shit.

801
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,960
Oh, Vic?

802
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,360
What?

803
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,120
Whose thumb is this?

804
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:25,920
Oh, yeah. Good news, Roy.
Charlie brought your thumb.

805
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,640
So, you think you're
going to go back to Florida?

806
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,360
You know,
I've been thinking about that.

807
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,280
Maybe you shouldn't tell me
where you're going...

808
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,840
and I shouldn't tell you
where I'm going.

809
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:41,280
I just think
it's safer that way.

810
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,320
He's going to kill you,
Arglist.

811
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,200
That's where you're going.

812
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,200
It's the truth, Arglist!

813
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:48,920
Think about it.

814
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,400
Pay no attention
to the man in the trunk.

815
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,960
He's got a gun, Roy. He could
shoot me now if he wanted to.

816
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:04,280
Uh-uh. He needs your help
to unload the car.

817
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:09,240
Once he's deposited me
and his missus in the lake...

818
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:10,800
you're next.

819
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,800
You know what, Roy?

820
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,440
One more word
out of that trunk...

821
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,400
and I'm gonna shoot it
at both ends.

822
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,240
Because the truth is,
I can't remember which end your head's at.

823
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:31,280
You know, the fact of the matter is,
I should shoot you.

824
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,240
What were you doing
in there tonight?

825
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,720
What are you talking about?
Well, you're waiving stage fees...

826
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,800
you're comping drinks,
being nice to people.

827
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,760
You may as well wear a fucking sign that says:

828
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:43,920
"Hey, I just stole a shitload of money and now I'm blowing town."

829
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,920
For Christ's sake...
Calm down! It's Christmas.

830
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,520
Everybody's nice
on Christmas.

831
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:50,840
No, Charlie. No.
Only morons are nice at Christmas.

832
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,840
And that's a lot of people,
too, Charlie.

833
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,480
Especially in Kansas.
But not everybody.

834
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,640
What kind of man
shoots his own wife...

835
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:02,040
in the back of the head
on Christmas Eve?

836
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,480
Roy, he already knows
that you shot her, okay?

837
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,880
That's what he told you,
Arglist?

838
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,960
What the hell do I want to shoot his wife for?

839
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:14,280
Bill Guerrard knows about this whole deal, Arglist.

840
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,400
That's not what
you said earlier, Roy...

841
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,600
when your thumb
was in the vise.

842
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,640
You'll never make it
out of Wichita.

843
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,040
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but did I not warn that asshole...

844
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:24,080
to shut the fuck up?

845
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,720
You told him.
You got one chance, Arglist...

846
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,040
That's right. I told him.
Take the wheel.

847
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:29,080
...and that's me.
Take the fucking wheel!

848
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,120
Think about it!

849
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:37,840
Fucking asshole.

850
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,880
Well, I guess
that was the head end, huh?

851
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,440
Where's the thumb?

852
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,960
The thumb,
where's the thumb?

853
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,440
Thank you, sir.

854
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,120
There she is.

855
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,280
It's kind of beautiful
out here, huh?

856
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,160
All right, give her a shove.

857
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:40,480
Well, come on.
Open the fucking door and help me with this goddamn thing.

858
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:43,000
What do you think we're here for?
Come on.

859
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,040
Jesus.

860
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,160
Hang on! It's caught.

861
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,680
Okay.

862
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:05,840
Okay.

863
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,680
Now toss it over.
Come on.

864
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,880
For fuck's sake, Charlie,
come on.

865
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,520
Fuck, this is heavy.

866
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,000
It says, "Keep off."

867
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,400
All right, ready?
Let's go.

868
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,440
Think I'd rather push.

869
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,160
Okay, fucking push.
I don't give a shit.

870
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,560
You're in the way, Charlie.

871
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,280
Okay, let's go. Ready?
Yeah.

872
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,160
It's falling apart.

873
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,120
You know what?
Put it up on its end.

874
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,560
Just shove it up.

875
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,640
I mean, it's as deep here
as it is any place else.

876
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,800
Just throw
the fucking thing over.

877
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,240
Vic.

878
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:27,720
God damn it, Roy.
That was just blind fucking luck, you asshole.

879
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,520
Give me a hand, Arglist.
I'm all stiff.

880
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,400
Now, as promised.

881
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,440
Well, Roy, the good news is,
you're out of the trunk.

882
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:49,840
The bad news is,
you're down four quarts of blood...

883
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,160
and your gun's empty.

884
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,920
I'm going to kill you anyway.

885
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,240
Here, hold this.

886
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,040
That's an unrealistic goal,
Roy.

887
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,360
You're dead, Roy.

888
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,160
Don't just stand there
pretending you're not.

889
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,680
Jesus Christ, Charlie!

890
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,600
Throw me a rope or something.
I can't swim!

891
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,440
I'm thinking, no.

892
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,840
You were gonna kill me, right, Vic?
You asshole!

893
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,040
Jesus, you're stupid!

894
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,840
All right, that's it!
Fuck you!

895
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,320
Look, okay, I'm sorry!

896
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,400
Charlie, I'm sorry!

897
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:52,040
I'm going to throw
the gun away! Look!

898
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:57,720
Oh, God, you have no idea
how cold this water is.

899
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,800
Charlie.

900
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,240
So long, Vic.

901
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:08,920
Don't you want to know
where the money is?

902
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,520
I know where the money is.
It's in the back seat of the Benz.

903
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:15,600
Not a chance! Not a chance.

904
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,600
I'm done talking to you, Vic.
I'm through listening to you.

905
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:21,240
If you don't believe me,
look for yourself!

906
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:24,360
Only hurry! Hurry!
I can't feel my legs!

907
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,520
I'm dying here! I'm dying!

908
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:31,200
Charlie! God damn it!

909
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:35,920
I know what I did was wrong!
But, Jesus! Fuck!

910
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:42,560
I'm shot, Charlie.
I can't pull myself up!

911
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:45,800
Please. Please.

912
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:51,880
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be his name, because...

913
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,520
We are kingdom come,
and will be done...

914
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:57,240
and give us every day...

915
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,640
our bread,
because we gotta eat...

916
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:07,000
Charlie, is that you? Charlie!

917
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:11,720
I knew it. I knew it.
You're a good man, Charlie.

918
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,240
You're a good man.

919
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:16,480
Vic, I wouldn't want you
to die alone.

920
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,600
No! No.

921
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:26,800
No!

922
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:44,680
Vic! Vic, hold on!

923
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,280
Hold on, Vic.

924
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,360
Is that all?

925
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:53,280
Yeah.

926
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,160
Stocking stuffers.

927
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:05,560
Big spender.

928
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:09,080
Do you have any kids?
No.

929
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:12,080
Then shut the fuck up.
Bag it.

930
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:19,960
Hello. Charlie?
Renata.

931
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,160
I'd just about given up.

932
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,680
I fucked up.

933
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:26,360
Vic's dead.

934
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:28,760
What about Roy Gelles?

935
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,120
He's dead, too.

936
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,160
Why don't you come over?

937
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:38,400
I'll wait here for you.
The front door's open.

938
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:41,080
No. I don't see the point.
I mean...

939
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,760
I don't have the money.

940
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:46,320
Vic died before he told me
where it was.

941
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:50,240
You know what?
Money isn't everything.

942
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:52,280
Excuse me?

943
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,440
You know what I said before?
It's true, isn't it?

944
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:01,920
You're in love with me.
Yeah.

945
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,360
Sure. I guess.

946
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:07,640
I've still got to ask you
something.

947
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:09,800
What?

948
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:16,680
I don't have it yet.
I'm sorry.

949
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:19,640
But you're coming over?
Yeah. Sure.

950
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,440
See you.

951
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:03,520
Take me with you, man.
Oh, fuck.

952
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:08,080
Jesus, Pete.
No, I mean it.

953
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:09,520
Take me with you, buddy.

954
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:15,800
I can't do my life, man.
I can't do it.

955
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,840
Just get some rest.

956
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:20,160
I hate myself.
I want a new life.

957
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:25,720
You don't want mine.
I really do.

958
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:29,480
I'm in trouble.

959
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:34,000
I'm in big fucking trouble.

960
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:36,640
But that'd be great.
Don't you see?

961
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:38,400
We go out in a blaze of glory.

962
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,760
Like men.
Like men, Charlie.

963
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,920
No goddamn life left
for men anymore.

964
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:51,960
Not here.

965
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:55,320
This country,
all that's left for men is money and pussy.

966
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:00,480
But together,
you and me together...

967
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:11,880
Don't you think?

968
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:56,200
Come on. Hurry up.

969
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:58,880
Bill Guerrard
is around here somewhere.

970
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,000
Oh.
Yeah, "Oh."

971
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:09,840
Where is he?

972
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:11,640
Oh.

973
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,200
Hide behind the door and shoot him when he comes in.

974
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:17,280
You don't happen to have
any bullets for this, do you?

975
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:26,360
Shotgun behind the bar.

976
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,800
"As Wichita falls...

977
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:31,920
"so falls Wichita Falls."

978
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:35,680
I like that.

979
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,400
And I'm gonna give your pussy-whipped pal Arglist...

980
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:41,080
another 15 minutes
to rescue your sweet ass.

981
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:46,120
After which time I'm going to assume his brain overruled his pecker.

982
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:50,040
Well, Bill,
that's just not enough time.

983
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,400
He lives way across town.

984
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:55,880
Yeah? Well, that's your bad luck.
I should be home in Kansas City...

985
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:58,520
watching my kids
open their Christmas presents!

986
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:00,120
Now I gotta waste
the whole fucking day...

987
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:01,840
Iooking for that nitwit!

988
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,160
I'll never understand lawyers.

989
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:10,200
I mean,
here they've got a license to steal from the general public...

990
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:13,000
all legal and aboveboard,
but is that enough?

991
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:15,760
Fuck, no!
They gotta steal from their friends!

992
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:19,680
Anybody
but a fucking lawyer...

993
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,680
would consider
the consequences, right?

994
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:27,320
That I would,
for an absolute certainty...

995
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:30,880
castrate that son of a bitch
with a butter knife.

996
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:34,200
And that would give
a normal person pause.

997
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:36,160
But not a lawyer.

998
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:40,120
It defies the imagination,
you know.

999
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:45,520
How a woman like you could throw in with a couple of farthammers...

1000
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,600
like Cavanaugh and Arglist.

1001
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,320
Cavanaugh, he doesn't
have the brains...

1002
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,840
to pull off
something like this.

1003
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:55,480
And Arglist,
he doesn't have the guts.

1004
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,360
Maybe that's where you
came in, huh?

1005
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,400
What did you do?

1006
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:09,880
Did you encourage them both?

1007
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:24,720
Suppose you do luck out...

1008
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:28,120
and you get clear of Wichita
with all that money.

1009
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:29,360
At some point...

1010
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:32,920
you're gonna have to get rid of at least one of the peckerwoods.

1011
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,640
And then what do you got?

1012
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,200
A dick with no brain?

1013
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:40,800
Or a brain with no dick?

1014
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:49,280
You know what, Bill?

1015
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,720
You seem awfully tense.

1016
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:56,760
And I have this idea
of what might help you relax.

1017
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:00,480
You do, huh?

1018
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:01,520
Mmm-hmm.

1019
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:15,960
That you, Arglist?

1020
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:18,640
Drop the gun.

1021
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:22,600
Step away from the desk
and put your hands up.

1022
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:25,480
Charlie,
don't be a fucking idiot.

1023
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:28,840
You've been watching
too many stupid old movies.

1024
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:30,720
Why would I drop my gun?

1025
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,520
I don't know, Bill.

1026
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:34,120
Because I got
a big fucking shotgun...

1027
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,320
and I'll blow your head off?

1028
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:37,600
Well, if you could do that,
you'd be me...

1029
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:40,080
and I'd be a pissant lawyer
with a case of the shakes.

1030
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:42,360
Jesus, Charlie,
just shoot him!

1031
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:47,520
If he was gonna
pull the trigger...

1032
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:50,000
he'd have done it when he came
through the door, girlie.

1033
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:52,280
It's something they don't
teach you in law school.

1034
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:54,120
Which is a shame,
because...

1035
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:05,880
Get his gun, Charlie.

1036
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:09,280
Get his gun.

1037
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:11,320
He's dead, Renata.

1038
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:14,160
The fuck he is!
Sidney loads that with birdshot!

1039
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:15,560
Why would he? I mean...
Charlie.

1040
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:18,280
...from a liability standpoint,
that doesn't make any sense at all.

1041
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:19,480
Charlie!

1042
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:25,120
Well, Arglist...

1043
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:28,120
now you've truly gone
and shit in your nest!

1044
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:35,040
All right, girlie.
You first.

1045
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:36,280
Mr. Guerrard?

1046
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,400
What's going on?

1047
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:55,600
Come here!

1048
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:04,560
Bitch!

1049
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:10,120
Charlie.

1050
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:15,520
I don't know why
I even bother with Kansas.

1051
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,400
Do I hear an "amen"?

1052
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:21,400
My old man tried
to tell me...

1053
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:24,160
that I'd be better off
starting a church...

1054
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:26,880
and letting Jesus pay
for the mortgage...

1055
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:30,640
in this sorry-ass
backwards state.

1056
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:32,920
I wouldn't listen.

1057
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:34,640
Instead...

1058
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:38,960
I put my faith
in naked women and hand jobs.

1059
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:42,680
Which have a proven track
record everywhere but here.

1060
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:51,600
And now I've been disfigured
by a whisky-dick lawyer...

1061
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:56,240
who imagines he can kill me with a shotgun loaded for snake.

1062
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:00,280
Serves me right.

1063
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:02,520
That's all I can say.

1064
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,440
All right, girlie...

1065
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:10,080
this is the one
that's gonna kill you.

1066
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:12,560
Bill.

1067
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:25,120
Yuck!

1068
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:44,080
I will say, after this...

1069
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:47,320
the holidays are never gonna feel quite the same to me.

1070
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:53,200
How's the foot?
Shorter.

1071
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:56,520
You don't happen to have
any morphine...

1072
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:58,360
or Demerol or anything,
do you?

1073
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:00,600
Try this.

1074
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,040
I have to give you credit,
Charlie.

1075
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:12,000
You took your own sweet time
rising to the occasion...

1076
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:15,360
but in the end,
you did the deed.

1077
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:18,680
'Deed you did.

1078
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:29,120
You really came through,
Charlie.

1079
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:33,280
The odds were definitely
against it, but somehow...

1080
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:36,120
you managed to be
the last man standing.

1081
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,560
I know what I wanted
to ask you.

1082
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:25,360
What?
Where are you actually from?

1083
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,320
Originally.

1084
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:32,800
Why do you keep
asking questions, Charlie?

1085
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,080
What's it got to do
with anything?

1086
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,160
I was just curious.

1087
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,960
Wanted to know
where you came from.

1088
01:14:57,680 --> 01:14:59,680
It's a long story,
Charlie.

1089
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:03,600
I think we've got plenty of time to get to know each other better.

1090
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:06,480
Don't you?
Yeah.

1091
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:08,720
I guess we do.

1092
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,160
It's just you and me now,
Charlie.

1093
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:18,080
To the victor go the spoils.

1094
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:31,200
You saved my life,
Charlie.

1095
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:34,640
You're a different man,
just like I promised.

1096
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,960
Can you feel it?

1097
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:43,200
Yes. I can.

1098
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:48,880
Charlie.

1099
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:53,840
What'd you do?

1100
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:05,720
Oh! Damn stupid fuck!

1101
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:08,760
You stupid fucking whore!

1102
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:12,120
You dumb, dumb fuck!

1103
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:14,160
Your mother again?
Shit!

1104
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:18,080
Hi, Charlie. Yeah.
Who else?

1105
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:23,200
Loans me her camper and fails to mention that it's out of gas.

1106
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:26,680
If you've got a gas can,
you can siphon some from me.

1107
01:17:57,720 --> 01:17:59,000
Charlie.

1108
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:02,760
I don't want you
to take this the wrong way...

1109
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:08,920
but you're about
the nicest guy I know.

1110
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:14,320
I'm awfully sorry to hear that, Sidney,
but thank you.

1111
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Have a good time
with your kids at Six Flags.

1112
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:21,120
Merry Christmas.

1113
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:08,720
Nuts! Fuck!

1114
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:16,400
What was that?

1115
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:18,880
Nothing.

1116
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:58,520
Morning, Pete. Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, buddy.

1117
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:02,560
Where are we?

1118
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:04,720
We're in heaven.

1119
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:07,120
Mmm.

1120
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:13,240
They got pancakes?
They got everything.

1121
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:14,960
Good.
