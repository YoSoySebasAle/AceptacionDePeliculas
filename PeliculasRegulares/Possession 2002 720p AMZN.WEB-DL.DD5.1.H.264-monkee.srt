00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,518
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it! :D

Possession (2002)

5
00:00:42,257 --> 00:00:45,385
<i>They say that women change</i>

6
00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:48,046
<i>'Tis so</i>

7
00:00:48,297 --> 00:00:52,092
<i>But you are ever constant</i>
<i>In your changefulness</i>

8
00:00:52,342 --> 00:00:55,429
<i>Like that still thread</i>
<i>Of falling river</i>

9
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,766
<i>One from source to last embrace</i>
<i>In the still pool</i>

10
00:01:00,017 --> 00:01:05,022
<i>Ever-renewed and ever-moving on</i>
<i>From first to last</i>

11
00:01:05,272 --> 00:01:09,026
<i>From first to last</i>
<i>A myriad of water drops</i>

12
00:01:09,276 --> 00:01:11,903
<i>And you, I love you for it</i>

13
00:01:12,154 --> 00:01:16,950
<i>Are the force that moves</i>
<i>And holds the form</i>

14
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,912
Ladies and gentlemen,
you've just heard a snippet...

15
00:01:21,163 --> 00:01:27,794
...from one of only two copies of this
poem by Mr. Randolph Henry Ash...

16
00:01:28,045 --> 00:01:31,423
...poet laureate to Queen Victoria
herself.

17
00:01:31,673 --> 00:01:37,888
And this gorgeous ode to his nuptial
bliss, written in his own hand...

18
00:01:38,138 --> 00:01:40,265
...begins our bidding today.

19
00:01:40,515 --> 00:01:47,397
May we start the bidding,
please, at 40,000 pounds?

20
00:02:12,714 --> 00:02:16,009
- Bit of an old monster.
- Yeah.

21
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:18,428
But an important monster.

22
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:21,056
- It's Randolph Ash's.
- Yes.

23
00:02:21,306 --> 00:02:23,308
Who are you with again?

24
00:02:23,558 --> 00:02:27,521
- I'm Roland Michell.
- Who?

25
00:02:27,771 --> 00:02:31,817
- Professor Blackadder's assistant.
- Isn't that Dr. Wolfe?

26
00:02:32,067 --> 00:02:35,988
Was. Fergus got the lectureship
at St. John's over me.

27
00:02:36,238 --> 00:02:37,948
Of course he did.

28
00:02:38,198 --> 00:02:44,413
Yes, Dr. Wolfe mentioned you.
You're that American who's over here.

29
00:02:44,788 --> 00:02:51,420
I'm sure there are others.
After all, you are our favorite colony.

30
00:02:56,383 --> 00:03:01,847
Any further offers on 10,000 pounds?
11,000 pounds.

31
00:03:02,097 --> 00:03:05,642
So when do your little suffragist
trinkets come up?

32
00:03:05,892 --> 00:03:08,520
Look! Maud, it's Mortimer Cropper.

33
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,940
- That's someone you should know.
- You know him?

34
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,819
Of him. Suffered through a lecture,
that sort of thing.

35
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:17,821
He's a voracious collector.

36
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:23,243
Yes, his penchant for conquest is well
documented. A very male quality.

37
00:03:23,493 --> 00:03:28,790
- It's vulgar, but I have to introduce myself.
- All right.

38
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,460
Damn.

39
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:37,299
Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry. Thank you.

40
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:39,676
Professor Cropper? Fergus Wolfe.

41
00:03:39,926 --> 00:03:43,555
We spoke actually after one
of your papers at Trinity.

42
00:03:43,805 --> 00:03:47,434
- You wouldn't remember.
- Sorry, I don't. Nice coat.

43
00:03:47,684 --> 00:03:49,394
- Thank you.
- You're with?

44
00:03:49,645 --> 00:03:50,937
James Blackadder.

45
00:03:51,188 --> 00:03:53,940
One of his boys from
the British Museum.

46
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:57,778
Hello. Hildebrand Ash, man of leisure.

47
00:03:58,028 --> 00:03:59,321
Hello.

48
00:03:59,571 --> 00:04:03,075
I don't know why Blackadder
comes to these things.

49
00:04:03,325 --> 00:04:05,118
He hasn't got any money.

50
00:04:05,369 --> 00:04:10,582
He's Irish, you see.
He enjoys feeling persecuted.

51
00:04:32,688 --> 00:04:34,523
<i>Dear Madam:</i>

52
00:04:34,773 --> 00:04:39,611
<i>Since our pleasant conversation,</i>
<i>I have thought of little else.</i>

53
00:04:39,861 --> 00:04:46,076
<i>I write with a strong sense of the</i>
<i>necessity of continuing our talk.</i>

54
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,835
<i>Dear Madam:</i>

55
00:04:55,085 --> 00:04:59,506
<i>I know that you came to honor</i>
<i>Crabb-Robinson at his small party...</i>

56
00:04:59,756 --> 00:05:02,843
<i>... because he'd assisted</i>
<i>your illustrious father.</i>

57
00:05:03,093 --> 00:05:05,429
Excuse me, sir.

58
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:08,932
Meal is served.

59
00:05:09,683 --> 00:05:12,894
Thank you.

60
00:06:49,324 --> 00:06:51,576
- Well, hello.
- Hello.

61
00:06:51,827 --> 00:06:55,122
My tenant. Your evening sherry.

62
00:06:55,372 --> 00:06:56,707
Thank you.

63
00:06:56,957 --> 00:06:59,918
Candi, this is Roland. Roland, Candi.

64
00:07:00,168 --> 00:07:03,630
- Hello again.
- Be a love and check on the duck.

65
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,591
Okay.

66
00:07:06,842 --> 00:07:08,635
Coming in?

67
00:07:08,885 --> 00:07:13,974
- How do you always know it's me?
- I'm a solicitor, I know everything.

68
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:17,936
- Candi, huh?
- No, please. Candi's just a friend.

69
00:07:18,186 --> 00:07:21,815
- Why, are you interested?
- I told you, I'm off women.

70
00:07:22,065 --> 00:07:27,154
Yeah, but there's no reason
to be off women.

71
00:07:31,491 --> 00:07:34,745
- Why do we sit in your hall?
- It's the best room.

72
00:07:34,995 --> 00:07:38,624
I bought this place for the hallway.

73
00:07:38,874 --> 00:07:42,919
I found something pretty
incredible in the London Library.

74
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:46,089
- A place to sit?
- No.

75
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,092
I found something of Ash's.
Randolph Ash?

76
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:53,180
Ash? Doesn't he have
some sort of celebration going?

77
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:58,268
- It's a centenary of his love poems.
- Mushy ones? Found after his death?

78
00:07:58,518 --> 00:08:03,023
- Is the table laid, darling?
- What's it cost an hour?

79
00:08:03,273 --> 00:08:06,818
- Candi's a friend, I told you.
- Not her, you.

80
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:10,739
What do you charge an hour, roughly?

81
00:08:10,989 --> 00:08:13,909
- I don't know, 500.
- Pounds?

82
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:17,996
- No wonder you have a nice hallway.
- Thank you.

83
00:08:18,246 --> 00:08:21,875
I want seven minutes
of attorney-client privilege.

84
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:25,629
Step into my office.

85
00:08:35,555 --> 00:08:36,848
Ash wrote those.

86
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,476
- They're not the originals?
- Yeah.

87
00:08:39,726 --> 00:08:43,230
How much time is left?
I gotta think of a defense.

88
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,025
- They're practically love letters.
- Rather racy.

89
00:08:47,275 --> 00:08:52,906
Ash supposedly never even looked
at another woman his entire marriage.

90
00:08:53,156 --> 00:08:56,785
Can you imagine if I proved
that Mr. Perfect Husband...

91
00:08:57,035 --> 00:09:00,580
...had this Shakespearean
dark-lady thing going?

92
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:05,002
The duck's done. Would you
be a sweetheart and do the sauce?

93
00:09:05,252 --> 00:09:08,297
Yeah, sure.

94
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,800
- Duck, huh?
- Yeah, Peking.

95
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:15,721
No, it's from around the corner.

96
00:09:15,971 --> 00:09:20,058
Yeah, but that would be extraordinary.

97
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:24,062
It'd be rewriting history, old chap.

98
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:27,733
Yeah, it would be.

99
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,276
- Morning.
- Morning.

100
00:10:11,526 --> 00:10:15,614
- Roland.
- Professor.

101
00:10:17,866 --> 00:10:22,954
- I think I made a discovery.
- It's been discovered 20 times already.

102
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:26,917
- I don't think so.
- Surprise me.

103
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:32,422
Ash's copy of "Vico" in the library is
full of his own notes on bits of paper.

104
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:35,050
- Useful?
- Very.

105
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:40,430
Better have a look before Cropper
turns up with his checkbook.

106
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:45,268
He made a mockery yesterday.
1900 pounds for a toothpick.

107
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,731
- Fergus? Where is Fergus?
- He's supposed to be teaching.

108
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,192
- I'll come with you.
- No need.

109
00:10:52,442 --> 00:10:56,738
The novice blunders on the discovery,
the scholar investigates.

110
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,992
You do those requests
for Ellen's stuff.

111
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:04,788
I'll go straight from there
to my class.

112
00:11:06,915 --> 00:11:11,295
"Thank you, what a wonderful discovery.
They're magically delicious."

113
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:14,589
- He's a meanie.
- That's a nice name for him.

114
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,510
Wretched requests, please.

115
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:24,558
"How many jars of gooseberry jam did
Ash's wife, Ellen, make in 1850?"

116
00:11:24,808 --> 00:11:28,854
This is not a job for a grownup.

117
00:11:33,358 --> 00:11:36,445
Gooseberry.

118
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,531
Cooking.

119
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:43,201
Gooseberry jam.

120
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:47,706
Cooking, 142.

121
00:12:04,806 --> 00:12:11,605
What about a small,
informal party, 1859?

122
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:29,623
<i>My headache kept me from accompanying</i>
<i>Randolph to Crabb-Robinson's...</i>

123
00:12:29,873 --> 00:12:33,418
<i>... for a dinner honoring the poetess,</i>
<i>Christabel LaMotte.</i>

124
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:38,674
<i>He was reluctant to attend without me.</i>
<i>I was persistent and persuaded him.</i>

125
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:43,261
- Ash, do you know Professor Spear?
- I'm delighted.

126
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:44,888
Mrs. Jameson.

127
00:12:45,138 --> 00:12:47,683
- Mrs. Jameson.
- Charmed.

128
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,060
Miss Glover.

129
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,104
Miss Glover.

130
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:56,441
- And Miss LaMotte.
- Miss LaMotte.

131
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:59,611
The highest pleasure.

132
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:03,448
<i>Randolph reported the party went off</i>
<i>very well indeed.</i>

133
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:06,284
<i>The discussion of poetry</i>
<i>was animated...</i>

134
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:10,872
<i>... with Miss LaMotte speaking more</i>
<i>forcibly than anyone expected.</i>

135
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,751
It surprises me that a lady
who lives as quietly as you...

136
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:18,463
...would be aware
of my modest success.

137
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:23,260
I am very aware of it.
The papers herald you weekly.

138
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:27,180
- It is you, however, who surprise me.
- Why is that?

139
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:32,436
Judging from your work, I'm surprised
you acknowledge my existence...

140
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:38,108
...or any woman's, since you show us
such small regard on the page.

141
00:13:38,358 --> 00:13:40,193
You cut me, madam.

142
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:45,949
Then I'm sorry.
I only meant to scratch.

143
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:50,245
Hey, Fergus!

144
00:13:51,496 --> 00:13:56,251
Hello, Roland. What is it you chaps
always say? How's it hanging?

145
00:13:56,501 --> 00:14:00,130
We usually just say "Hey".
I mean, unless you're gay.

146
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:04,051
Listen. Let me ask you.
Do you know a Dr. Maud Bailey?

147
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:09,806
Yes. I know Maud very well.
She teaches gender studies at Lincoln.

148
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:15,687
Would she be helpful? I'm checking out
Christabel LaMotte, a poet from 1859.

149
00:14:15,937 --> 00:14:17,689
Why are you interested?

150
00:14:17,939 --> 00:14:23,195
I had some requests about Ellen Ash's
papers and LaMotte's name came up.

151
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:27,240
The keeper of Ellen's flame,
that's bottom of the food chain.

152
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,869
But I gotta stay on the food chain.
That's why I do it.

153
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:38,502
Right. Publish or perish, as they say.
Or in your case, perish or perish.

154
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,171
So would she, this Maud Bailey?

155
00:14:41,421 --> 00:14:45,050
- Yes, but I'd be careful.
- Why? What's she like?

156
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,012
- She thicks men's blood with cold.
- Great.

157
00:14:49,262 --> 00:14:55,686
If you prefer the American vernacular,
she's a regular ball-breaker.

158
00:15:03,318 --> 00:15:06,279
Mr. Michell?

159
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,283
- What? I'm sorry.
- Roland Michell?

160
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,327
Yes.

161
00:15:12,577 --> 00:15:15,580
- You're Maud.
- Bailey. Dr. Bailey. Yes.

162
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:19,418
There's nothing in my index,
no mention of Ash at all.

163
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:22,671
- Ash and LaMotte definitely met.
- When?

164
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:29,594
June 1859. At a dinner party given
by Crabb-Robinson. It's in his diary.

165
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:33,181
You jump from that to the idea
they corresponded?

166
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,018
- I found an unfinished letter...
- To LaMotte?

167
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,561
No, "Dear Madam".

168
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:42,190
But of the three women at that party,
LaMotte is likeliest.

169
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:49,323
- LaMotte's letters may have something.
- There aren't many from that period.

170
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:54,411
I'm descended from Christabel.
I'm her niece, thrice removed.

171
00:15:54,661 --> 00:16:00,125
- Three greats.
- That's what thrice usually means.

172
00:16:00,917 --> 00:16:06,298
- Maybe I shouldn't have come.
- Does seem rather pointless.

173
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:09,843
You could have a look
through Blanche's diary.

174
00:16:10,093 --> 00:16:12,512
- Who's Blanche?
- Blanche Glover...

175
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:17,643
...Christabel's companion?
Her lover? You look surprised.

176
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,145
- I didn't know...
- She was a lesbian?

177
00:16:20,395 --> 00:16:26,902
- Don't get me wrong. I like lesbians.
- Unfortunately, they didn't have video then.

178
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:32,407
- I see why you think it's so unlikely.
- No. She could have been bisexual.

179
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:37,496
There's no evidence she was, but...
Did you not read before you came?

180
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:40,374
- Is this an oral exam?
- I suppose it is.

181
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:44,252
You don't know about her,
and yet you make these leaps.

182
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:49,049
You called her a lesbian, not me.

183
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:03,897
<i>Letters, letters, letters. Not for me.</i>

184
00:17:04,147 --> 00:17:08,902
<i>Letters I am not meant to know or see.</i>

185
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:24,543
Thank you, Jane.

186
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:35,679
- You do not have to hide them from me.
- I'm not hiding them.

187
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:39,808
You say they are not hidden,
but they are.

188
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:45,856
Tucked away.
As if they were from Cupid himself.

189
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,942
What does he want?

190
00:17:49,192 --> 00:17:53,196
- To be my friend.
- Friend?

191
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:58,952
- They give what they want a decent name.
- Blanche, no.

192
00:17:59,202 --> 00:18:02,289
No, Blanche, listen.

193
00:18:02,914 --> 00:18:07,169
What we have is ours.

194
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:11,840
No one can change that.

195
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:20,932
It is already changed.

196
00:18:34,529 --> 00:18:36,448
Find anything?

197
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:39,951
Maybe.

198
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:04,601
So, what are those bookmarks, then?

199
00:19:04,851 --> 00:19:09,898
Blanche writes about letters. Letters
that Christabel wrote and received.

200
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:13,527
And it nearly drove Blanche crazy.
Where are they?

201
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:17,489
Lost, destroyed, who knows.
There's lots we haven't got.

202
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:21,618
Not one of Blanche's paintings
has ever turned up.

203
00:19:21,868 --> 00:19:23,954
So who wrote the letters?

204
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:29,126
We've never verified it, but Ash
certainly isn't one of the candidates.

205
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,796
- You've got nothing.
- I mean, it's just a thought.

206
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:37,259
I've had many thoughts today,
and you've shot them all down.

207
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:40,929
It seems like a bit
of a wild-goose chase to me.

208
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:43,390
I'd like to do some more reading.

209
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,393
I suppose you'll wish
to stay overnight.

210
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:51,815
I can't afford to stay.
Unless I huddle in your doorway.

211
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:57,904
I suppose I could put up with you
for one evening, couldn't I?

212
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,414
No doubt you know Fergus Wolfe, then?

213
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:13,670
- Sorry. We're in the same department.
- I imagine he told you that we're...

214
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,633
...occasionally on together.
- No, he didn't.

215
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,302
What did he...?

216
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:25,349
Did he say anything about me?

217
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,936
No.

218
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:34,191
I'll use the bathroom.
Get out of your way.

219
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:39,154
I'm just a brush and flush
kind of guy, so...

220
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,990
Forget I said that.

221
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,412
Maud. Can I show you something?

222
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,220
- Are these...?
- The originals.

223
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,472
- How did you get?
- I stole them.

224
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:08,225
- Where from?
- The London Library.

225
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,560
- How could you do that?
- Impulse.

226
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:15,148
Impulse? I've seen that
take-what-you-want attitude...

227
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:18,276
What? In other Americans?

228
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,738
God, what is it with you people
and Americans?

229
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:25,409
I know I shouldn't have taken them.

230
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,495
I want to find out
if he sent the letter.

231
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:33,166
You don't buy it, but Blanche's
diary suggests that it's possible.

232
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:37,170
- Wouldn't someone have unearthed it?
- That's why it's big.

233
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,507
- Potentially so big.
- Well, no one has.

234
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:45,095
Probably because those
were never sent.

235
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:14,291
Are you doing your homework?

236
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:19,379
No, I was just writing stuff.
Stuff for me. It's nothing.

237
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:24,968
- You're a closet poet.
- More like basement, really.

238
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:29,973
- Just fooling around.
- So is that what you want to be?

239
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:35,145
No, I'll be safe and teach
like everybody else.

240
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:39,191
Besides, there's no such thing
as poets anymore.

241
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:42,194
Well, poet.

242
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:47,115
Do you want to see Christabel's
family home before you go?

243
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:51,203
Michell's late again.

244
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,790
Roland asked for another day off,
Fergus.

245
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,461
- Really? Where's he gone?
- I didn't ask. And he didn't say.

246
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:03,131
He's an American.
He's probably trafficking drugs.

247
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,259
Did his new discovery
lead to anything?

248
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,681
- Ash's "Vico"? Are you dreaming?
<i>- Vico.</i>

249
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:16,269
No, it's about Christabel LaMotte.
He went to see Dr. Bailey. A woman.

250
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,897
LaMotte.

251
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,483
- No.
- It probably came to nothing.

252
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:26,989
- Exactly.
- Or he would have told you.

253
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:32,536
Wouldn't he?

254
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,504
Seal Court's over there.

255
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,382
So how long did Christabel live there?

256
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:49,845
Ages. Last 20 or so years of her life.

257
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,847
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

258
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:56,476
"To a dusty shelf we aspire."

259
00:23:56,727 --> 00:24:01,732
You should drop by Seal Court
before your train.

260
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:07,779
What do you do in London, Mr. Michell?
Are you a teacher?

261
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:12,159
- No, not yet. I'm doing a fellowship.
- Which means what?

262
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:15,579
On the dole.

263
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,460
- My field's Victorian poetry.
- We had a poet in this house once.

264
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:26,131
Terrible sentimental stuff about God.
Death. The dew. And fairies.

265
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:30,218
Show this young man
Christabel's room, Maud.

266
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:33,680
And why don't you stay tonight?

267
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:38,977
You're under no obligation to stay.
Just Joan's way, misses our daughter.

268
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:43,607
- It's quite a drive back.
- No, we're fine.

269
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,109
Hardly ever come up here.

270
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:51,990
With the wheelchair, of course,
we bunk down on the ground floor.

271
00:24:55,994 --> 00:25:00,499
I haven't been up here
since I was a child.

272
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,585
Maud.

273
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:08,507
- Is this the photograph at your house?
- Yes, Christabel's niece, May...

274
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,801
...my great-great grandmother.

275
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:16,181
Christabel wrote dozens of poems
about this place.

276
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:24,398
<i>What are they, who haunt our dreams</i>
<i>And weaken our desires</i>

277
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:28,944
<i>And turn us from a solid face</i>
<i>And in the depth of wintry night</i>

278
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,363
<i>They slumber open-eyed and bright</i>

279
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:36,118
<i>Dolly keeps a secret</i>
<i>Safer than a friend</i>

280
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:39,079
<i>Dolly's silent sympathy</i>
<i>Lasts without end</i>

281
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:43,125
<i>No rush of action</i>
<i>This is our doom</i>

282
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:49,548
<i>To live a long life out</i>
<i>In a dark room</i>

283
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:53,302
Maud.

284
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:57,014
It's pretty incredible.

285
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:09,860
Fergus, it's me.
I'm out of town tonight on business.

286
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:15,449
<i>I'd like to ask you about a connection</i>
<i>between Christabel and Randolph Ash.</i>

287
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:22,956
<i>Call me on 015-226-32416.</i>

288
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,010
Roland.

289
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,392
- Roland.
- No.

290
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:46,396
Roland, it's me. It's Maud.

291
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:50,942
- What is it?
- Listen.

292
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:55,489
<i>Dolly keeps a secret</i>
<i>Safer than a friend</i>

293
00:26:55,739 --> 00:27:01,036
<i>Dolly's silent sympathy</i>
<i>Lasts without end</i>

294
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:41,159
God.

295
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,787
I was so sure.

296
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:50,335
Sympathy. Sympathy. Sympathy.
Meaning what?

297
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:58,552
Mutual affection or understanding.
Favor, pity or accord. That's not it.

298
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:02,055
That's not it at all.

299
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:05,684
She uses silent sympathy
in a more classical context.

300
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:13,191
Like structure or support. Dolly
conceals it, but not within, beneath.

301
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:22,159
There's a door.

302
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:38,800
- I can't believe it.
- Let me see.

303
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:42,012
- Be careful. They're precious.
- I will be.

304
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:46,558
- We shouldn't be doing this.
- Why'd you drag me up here then?

305
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,436
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna read.

306
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:54,566
- We've got to ask the Baileys!
- Ask, and you'll see these under glass.

307
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:58,028
Stop! Stop! All right.
Can we do it properly?

308
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:05,327
- Let me get notecards and pencils...
- All right. Go, go. Hurry!

309
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,992
Look at this. We got Ash
and Christabel's letters. Listen.

310
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:46,994
"Dear Miss LaMotte:

311
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:53,125
It was a great pleasure to talk to you
at dear Crabb-Robinson's party."

312
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:56,295
"May I hope that you too
enjoyed our talk?"

313
00:29:56,545 --> 00:30:01,842
"And may I have the pleasure
of calling on you?"

314
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:04,177
She says no.

315
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:06,221
"But you may write."

316
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:10,267
<i>"Would you rather not have a letter,</i>
<i>however imperfect...</i>

317
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:15,522
<i>... than a plate of cucumber sandwiches,</i>
<i>however exquisitely fine cut?"</i>

318
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:20,110
<i>"You know you would, and so would I."</i>

319
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:26,283
"I was entranced and moved
by your portrait of your father."

320
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,243
"I write nonsense."

321
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:32,789
"If you write again, you shall
have an essay on what you will."

322
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,250
"Yours to command, in some things."

323
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,669
- "I was born...
- Christabel LaMotte.

324
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,841
...in a small place too."
Not like this, not bare.

325
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:49,723
<i>A brilliant, dusty hutch of mysteries.</i>
<i>A cabinet of curiosities.</i>

326
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,184
<i>What did my eyes first light on?</i>

327
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:58,899
<i>I am a creature of my pen.</i>
<i>My pen is the best part of me.</i>

328
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:01,193
<i>I send you now two more poems.</i>

329
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:07,824
<i>I read your mythic tales of Maia and</i>
<i>found them both charming and sad.</i>

330
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:11,495
<i>Your verse is rich</i>
<i>but the metaphor is richer.</i>

331
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:16,458
<i>Dear Mr. Ash: I live circumscribed</i>
<i>and self-communing.</i>

332
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,251
<i>It is best so.</i>

333
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:23,006
<i>Not like a princess in a thicket.</i>
<i>More like a spider in her web.</i>

334
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:27,511
"Inclined to snap at visitors
or trespassers...

335
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:32,891
...not perceiving the distinction until
too late. Thus it is unwise to call."

336
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:37,813
<i>I know you live very quietly</i>
<i>but I could be very quiet.</i>

337
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:40,774
<i>I only want to discuss Dante.</i>
<i>Shakespeare.</i>

338
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,819
<i>Wordsworth. Coleridge. Goethe.</i>

339
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:52,369
<i>Not forgetting, of course, Christabel</i>
<i>LaMotte and the ambitious fairy project.</i>

340
00:32:06,008 --> 00:32:12,681
<i>Sir, things flicker and shift</i>
<i>all spangle and sparkle and flashes.</i>

341
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:19,104
<i>I have sat all this long evening by my</i>
<i>fireside, turning towards a caving in...</i>

342
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:24,443
<i>... the crumbling of the consumed coals</i>
<i>to where I am leading myself...</i>

343
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:27,279
<i>... to lifeless dust, sir.</i>

344
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:34,369
<i>My dear friend, for I may</i>
<i>call myself a friend, may I not?</i>

345
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:40,125
<i>I speak to you as I would to any person</i>
<i>who possesses my true thoughts...</i>

346
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:46,632
<i>... my thoughts have spent more time in</i>
<i>your company than anyone else's lately.</i>

347
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:53,180
<i>Where my thoughts are,</i>
<i>there am I in truth.</i>

348
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:57,184
"My dear friend,
it has been borne in upon me...

349
00:32:57,434 --> 00:33:01,146
...that there are dangers
in our continued conversation."

350
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,482
<i>The world would not approve...</i>

351
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:08,904
<i>... of letters between a woman living in</i>
<i>shared solitude as I do, and a man.</i>

352
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:13,116
<i>Even if that man were a great poet.</i>

353
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:15,827
<i>And if one is to live in this way...</i>

354
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:24,127
<i>... it's imperative to appear respectable</i>
<i>in the eyes of that world and your wife.</i>

355
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:26,713
<i>It is a sealed pact.</i>

356
00:33:26,964 --> 00:33:30,968
<i>It is a chosen life in which I</i>
<i>have been wondrously happy...</i>

357
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:34,262
<i>... and not alone in being so.</i>

358
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:39,977
"I have chosen a way, dear friend.
I must hold to it."

359
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:43,772
"Be patient, be generous, forgive."

360
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:47,776
"May I also request that you
return my correspondence."

361
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:51,655
"In this way at least our letters
shall remain together."

362
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:59,413
"I have known incandescence and must
decline to sample it any further."

363
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:07,212
"This goes to the post. Forgive its faults
and forgive me. Christabel."

364
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:14,594
<i>My dear Christabel, your letter came</i>
<i>as a shock to me, I will confess.</i>

365
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:21,143
<i>I was at first not only shocked,</i>
<i>but angry that you should write so.</i>

366
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:25,772
<i>As you have asked about my wife,</i>
<i>however, I will tell you.</i>

367
00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:28,442
<i>I love Ellen...</i>

368
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:31,236
<i>... but not as I love you.</i>

369
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:37,659
<i>There are good reasons I cannot discuss</i>
<i>why my love for you may not hurt her.</i>

370
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,204
I do not feel I have been
a proper wife to you...

371
00:34:41,455 --> 00:34:46,251
...without children or any physical...
- Nonsense, Ellen.

372
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:49,504
Nonsense.

373
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:54,718
There are many types of love.

374
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:56,845
All sorts.

375
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,264
And ours...

376
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:03,518
...that good between us...

377
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:08,732
...has been most profound.

378
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,947
<i>I must say to you what is in my mind.</i>
<i>I've called you my muse, and so you are.</i>

379
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:22,162
<i>I could call you,</i>
<i>with even greater truth, my love.</i>

380
00:35:22,204 --> 00:35:25,082
- Whoa, whoa.
- What?

381
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:26,708
Don't do that. What?

382
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:32,089
He sends her more letters and she
doesn't answer him. She ignores him.

383
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:33,966
Typical.

384
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:42,432
No. She chose her life with Blanche.
It's not typical. It's remarkable.

385
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:48,689
"I hope this note is the dove...

386
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:52,317
...which will return with
the wished-for olive branch."

387
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,028
<i>"My letters are like Noah's ravens..."</i>

388
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:59,992
<i>They have sped out across the Thames,</i>
<i>and yet have not returned.</i>

389
00:36:00,242 --> 00:36:05,914
<i>I send this note by hand,</i>
<i>in the hope you might receive it.</i>

390
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:17,676
- Where are the letters?
- They're gone.

391
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:22,556
I tore them up. Burned them.

392
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:27,644
- And the others from my desk?
- The same.

393
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:32,482
I beg for us to be as we were,
Christabel.

394
00:36:32,733 --> 00:36:35,861
Sweetheart, please.

395
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:42,909
<i>This house...</i>

396
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:48,749
<i>... so happy once, is full of weeping</i>
<i>and wailing and black headaches.</i>

397
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:54,630
<i>I ask myself to whom I may turn</i>
<i>and think of you, my friend...</i>

398
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,676
<i>... the unwitting cause</i>
<i>of all this grief.</i>

399
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:09,645
<i>I shan't forget the first glimpse</i>
<i>of your form.</i>

400
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:13,899
<i>Illuminated as it was</i>
<i>by flashes of sunlight.</i>

401
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,777
<i>I have dreamt nightly of your face...</i>

402
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:21,823
<i>... and walked the landscape of my life</i>
<i>with the rhythms of your writing...</i>

403
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:23,867
<i>... ringing in my ears.</i>

404
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:28,956
<i>I shall never forget our shining</i>
<i>progress towards one another.</i>

405
00:37:29,206 --> 00:37:34,628
<i>Never have I felt such a concentration</i>
<i>of my entire being.</i>

406
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:40,467
<i>I cannot let you burn me up.</i>
<i>Nor can I resist you.</i>

407
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:48,058
<i>No mere human can stand in a fire</i>
<i>and not be consumed.</i>

408
00:37:51,979 --> 00:37:57,025
Mind reading that last part out
one more time?

409
00:37:57,484 --> 00:38:04,491
"I cannot let you burn me up.
Nor can I resist you."

410
00:38:04,574 --> 00:38:10,247
"No mere human can stand in a fire
and not be consumed."

411
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:12,416
That?

412
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:15,627
Yeah.

413
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:22,050
Thank you, and...

414
00:38:22,301 --> 00:38:24,511
"And I took your hand."

415
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:31,268
"Mine rested in yours
with trust and belief."

416
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:43,405
Do you have regrets?

417
00:38:43,697 --> 00:38:50,704
I should regret venturing out
to Crabb-Robinson's party that evening.

418
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,541
I should regret it, but I do not.

419
00:38:54,791 --> 00:39:00,005
Not even in that most sensible
corner of my heart.

420
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:05,969
What are we to do?

421
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:12,392
<i>"I do not wish to damage your life."</i>

422
00:39:12,643 --> 00:39:16,897
<i>"Nonetheless, I shall be in the church</i>
<i>at noon tomorrow...</i>

423
00:39:17,147 --> 00:39:21,318
...with what strikes me
as the holiest of prayers...

424
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:25,447
...that you should join me
on a journey to Yorkshire...

425
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:32,454
...a journey out of time
beyond our lives here on earth."

426
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:40,545
- This is unbelievable.
- That was the last one.

427
00:39:40,796 --> 00:39:44,341
- You're kidding me.
- No.

428
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:46,593
Did she go with him or not?

429
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:48,553
Hands up!

430
00:39:48,804 --> 00:39:52,975
You two?

431
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:55,268
What's this, then?

432
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:59,773
- There's been no harm done, George.
- How do we know?

433
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:03,402
It was very clever of Maud
to find your treasure.

434
00:40:03,652 --> 00:40:05,988
Yes, well...

435
00:40:06,238 --> 00:40:10,075
Must take advice, Joanie.

436
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:12,744
How long before he takes advice?

437
00:40:12,995 --> 00:40:16,665
He'll dither around for a while,
but not long.

438
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:19,793
Blanche's diary has nothing
for that period.

439
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:22,963
- Did Ellen keep a journal?
- Yeah, in London...

440
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:27,509
...but it's mostly housewife stuff.
- Gold is in that stuff.

441
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:31,263
We should check it.

442
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:43,233
<i>- Bailey here.</i>
- Bailey?

443
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:45,444
Is that Dr. Heath?

444
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:49,323
No. I'm a friend of Maud Bailey's.

445
00:40:49,573 --> 00:40:52,367
- Is she there?
- No, she isn't.

446
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:56,121
Could you get off the line?
I'm expecting the doctor.

447
00:40:56,371 --> 00:41:01,460
- Have you seen Roland Michell?
<i>- Not since this morning, no.</i>

448
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:03,337
But his work went well?

449
00:41:03,587 --> 00:41:07,549
The fairy poet?
I haven't the foggiest idea.

450
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:12,804
- Do you mean Christabel LaMotte?
<i>- Get off the line!</i>

451
00:41:28,362 --> 00:41:33,533
I looked in Ellen's diary
and there's nothing.

452
00:41:33,784 --> 00:41:37,329
But this should cheer you up.

453
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:40,332
It's in her correspondence.

454
00:41:40,582 --> 00:41:45,879
- I won't ask if this is the original.
- I wouldn't.

455
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:50,133
"Dear Mrs. Ash: I am at present
totally unknown to you...

456
00:41:50,384 --> 00:41:54,638
...but I have something to impart
to which concerns both of us...

457
00:41:54,888 --> 00:41:59,393
...and is, in my case,
a matter of life and death."

458
00:41:59,643 --> 00:42:04,564
<i>"May I trespass on your time</i>
<i>and come to see you?"</i>

459
00:42:04,815 --> 00:42:09,152
<i>"You would do wrong to keep this</i>
<i>evidence which I send to you now."</i>

460
00:42:09,403 --> 00:42:12,239
<i>"It is not mine, it is also not yours."</i>

461
00:42:12,489 --> 00:42:15,534
<i>"What I say is true and urgent,</i>
<i>as you will see."</i>

462
00:42:15,784 --> 00:42:20,956
<i>"Yours sincerely, Blanche Glover."</i>

463
00:42:26,545 --> 00:42:29,464
Mrs. Ash...

464
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:35,887
<i>Maybe Blanche kept the letters</i>
<i>and showed them to Ellen.</i>

465
00:42:36,138 --> 00:42:39,433
<i>It all fits beautifully.</i>

466
00:42:39,683 --> 00:42:43,770
Perhaps both of our departments
should work on this together.

467
00:42:44,021 --> 00:42:46,315
- Is that what you want?
- Do you?

468
00:42:46,565 --> 00:42:51,194
No. I want to find out what happened.
I wanna follow their trail.

469
00:42:51,445 --> 00:42:53,447
I need to know.

470
00:42:53,697 --> 00:42:58,952
I thought you were mad when you came
to Lincoln with your stolen letter.

471
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:03,332
Now I feel exactly the same.

472
00:43:05,459 --> 00:43:10,964
I haven't really thanked you.
I mean, properly, for all of this.

473
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:15,302
I have difficulty with compliments
and such.

474
00:43:15,552 --> 00:43:20,599
- Giving or receiving?
- Both, actually.

475
00:43:20,849 --> 00:43:24,478
Well, I won't tell you
you're amazing-looking then.

476
00:43:24,728 --> 00:43:27,814
- Thank you...
- I wouldn't act on it anyway...

477
00:43:28,065 --> 00:43:30,692
...with Fergus and all.
- What does "and all" mean?

478
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:35,572
Nothing. It's just a little problem
that I have, socially.

479
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:41,495
- Do you take anything for it?
- It's not that kind of a problem.

480
00:43:41,745 --> 00:43:46,333
It's just relationships on the whole,
they're not really for me.

481
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:49,753
- Anyway...
- Yes.

482
00:43:50,003 --> 00:43:57,636
- Anyway, thank you.
- You're welcome.

483
00:44:03,183 --> 00:44:07,437
- Thank you for agreeing to meet me.
- You made me rather curious.

484
00:44:07,688 --> 00:44:13,819
- Scotch with just a dash of soda.
- I'll have the same.

485
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:20,158
I wanted to learn of the connection
between Ash and Christabel LaMotte.

486
00:44:20,409 --> 00:44:22,369
LaMotte and Ash?
There isn't any.

487
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:27,582
Roland Michell has made a discovery
with a colleague of mine, Maud Bailey.

488
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:31,586
- Who is Roland Michell?
- Blackadder's research assistant.

489
00:44:31,837 --> 00:44:34,881
American. Blondish...

490
00:44:35,132 --> 00:44:39,428
Well, he seems to know you.
And he thinks it's important.

491
00:44:39,678 --> 00:44:45,934
- Does Blackadder agree?
- I don't believe he knows about it.

492
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:21,094
Do you wish to be lodged separately?

493
00:45:21,345 --> 00:45:26,099
- Respectably, elsewhere from me?
- I want to be with you.

494
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:29,936
I understood that was
what we had decided.

495
00:45:30,187 --> 00:45:35,108
These four weeks only are ours.

496
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:39,780
But ours alone.

497
00:45:52,793 --> 00:45:58,548
- I hope you will accept this ring.
- I brought a ring too.

498
00:45:58,799 --> 00:46:05,806
You see? Proof of my resolution.

499
00:46:19,945 --> 00:46:24,408
You take my breath away.

500
00:46:45,971 --> 00:46:49,308
Not yet.

501
00:46:51,393 --> 00:46:55,647
No, no. Not yet.

502
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:02,446
Shall we go out then, to explore?

503
00:47:19,338 --> 00:47:23,300
Here's your bathroom.

504
00:47:23,842 --> 00:47:27,679
Cupboards.

505
00:47:28,055 --> 00:47:32,100
Your lovely view.

506
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:36,813
And, of course, the bed.

507
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:44,655
- We'll look for another hotel.
- But this is where Ash stayed.

508
00:47:44,905 --> 00:47:48,784
- Then we'll have to share.
- I can bring up a folding bed...

509
00:47:49,034 --> 00:47:52,954
...if that's your problem.

510
00:47:53,288 --> 00:47:56,583
- We work together.
- We were expecting two rooms.

511
00:47:56,833 --> 00:48:02,714
I'm sure it's more complicated
than I can imagine.

512
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:21,817
That's a lovely brooch
you're wearing, miss.

513
00:48:22,067 --> 00:48:25,237
It could be one of
Isaac Greenburg's designs.

514
00:48:25,487 --> 00:48:30,200
I'll get the book
and see if I can tell.

515
00:48:36,331 --> 00:48:38,083
Where did you get this?

516
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:44,423
I've had it for ages.
It was in the family dress-up box.

517
00:48:45,716 --> 00:48:47,134
Don't you see?

518
00:48:47,384 --> 00:48:53,181
Ash bought the brooch for Ellen,
the clasped hands, here. We know that.

519
00:48:53,432 --> 00:48:55,809
- And this for Christabel.
- Right.

520
00:48:56,059 --> 00:49:00,272
So he bought this and said, "I'll have
the eternal embrace for my wife."

521
00:49:00,522 --> 00:49:04,401
He wouldn't have said anything,
he would have just bought it.

522
00:49:04,651 --> 00:49:07,195
It was accepted between them.

523
00:49:07,446 --> 00:49:12,326
Are you writing fiction now?

524
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:16,038
Maybe.

525
00:49:16,288 --> 00:49:21,543
But I'm having fun. Are you?

526
00:49:21,793 --> 00:49:25,380
Yes, I suppose I am.

527
00:49:25,631 --> 00:49:29,051
Don't grimace when you say it,
it's more convincing.

528
00:49:29,301 --> 00:49:35,557
I suppose I can be
a touch empirical at times.

529
00:49:35,807 --> 00:49:39,603
Just a touch.

530
00:49:39,853 --> 00:49:43,398
You want to go for a walk?
I mean, after this?

531
00:49:43,649 --> 00:49:49,363
For sure it's earlier than the death
of Victoria's Albert. Probably late '50s.

532
00:49:49,613 --> 00:49:55,077
- 1860s, maybe.
- 1859...

533
00:49:55,494 --> 00:49:58,080
...ish?

534
00:50:08,674 --> 00:50:12,302
I think we're getting
near Thomason Foss.

535
00:50:12,552 --> 00:50:14,638
- Cropper mentions it...
- Mortimer Cropper?

536
00:50:14,888 --> 00:50:18,642
Ash's biographer.
All-purpose asshole.

537
00:50:18,892 --> 00:50:22,062
He's tracked Ash's entire life.
He's happy to tell you that.

538
00:50:22,312 --> 00:50:27,734
- More than happy, I'm sure.
- You know him?

539
00:50:41,331 --> 00:50:45,294
That is beautiful.

540
00:50:47,004 --> 00:50:48,630
Maud.

541
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,465
What?

542
00:50:50,716 --> 00:50:54,553
I think Christabel did come here.

543
00:50:54,803 --> 00:50:57,264
Listen:

544
00:50:57,514 --> 00:51:01,643
<i>Three elements combine</i>
<i>To make the fourth</i>

545
00:51:01,893 --> 00:51:05,022
<i>But above the water and the light</i>
<i>Together made</i>

546
00:51:05,272 --> 00:51:07,899
<i>A halo in the darkened cave</i>

547
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:12,863
That poem is dated 1859, July.

548
00:51:13,113 --> 00:51:20,078
See, if there's a cave behind it,
that might be all the proof we need.

549
00:51:27,002 --> 00:51:31,298
I know it's an awfully repressed
English thing to say...

550
00:51:31,548 --> 00:51:37,971
...but what the hell are you doing?
- There's only one way to find out.

551
00:51:42,351 --> 00:51:47,606
Of course, we could have
just asked someone.

552
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:19,304
I found it!

553
00:54:07,371 --> 00:54:10,165
Your hands are shaking.

554
00:54:10,415 --> 00:54:13,293
Are you afraid?

555
00:54:13,543 --> 00:54:16,129
No.

556
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:19,800
A little.

557
00:54:50,247 --> 00:54:55,002
<i>These are and were there</i>
<i>The garden and the tree</i>

558
00:54:55,252 --> 00:54:59,631
<i>The serpent at its root</i>
<i>The fruit of gold</i>

559
00:54:59,881 --> 00:55:06,930
<i>The woman in the shadow of the boughs</i>
<i>The running water and the grassy space</i>

560
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:13,020
<i>They are and were there</i>

561
00:55:13,937 --> 00:55:17,733
I don't mind that.

562
00:55:19,109 --> 00:55:24,239
See? You could grow to like Ash.

563
00:55:24,531 --> 00:55:30,620
Yes. He's sort of
a soft-core misogynist.

564
00:55:39,588 --> 00:55:44,593
Why do you always tie
your hair up like that?

565
00:55:46,553 --> 00:55:54,353
- It's to do with Fergus Wolfe mostly.
- Fergus? How to do with Fergus?

566
00:55:55,937 --> 00:56:00,025
When we met, he drove me mad
quoting Yeats:

567
00:56:00,275 --> 00:56:05,572
<i>Who could love you for yourself alone</i>
<i>And not your yellow hair?</i>

568
00:56:05,822 --> 00:56:11,662
Then I was accused by feminists at a
conference of dyeing it to attract men.

569
00:56:11,912 --> 00:56:14,665
- Really?
- Yes.

570
00:56:14,915 --> 00:56:19,378
So I shaved it off. All of it.

571
00:56:19,628 --> 00:56:22,130
- And did he?
- Did who what?

572
00:56:22,381 --> 00:56:25,467
Fergus love you
without your yellow hair?

573
00:56:25,717 --> 00:56:27,886
No.

574
00:56:28,136 --> 00:56:31,306
With or without.

575
00:56:31,556 --> 00:56:35,227
I don't even like him.
But I can't seem to...

576
00:56:35,477 --> 00:56:37,437
It's Freud:

577
00:56:37,688 --> 00:56:41,775
On the other side of attraction
lies repulsion.

578
00:56:42,025 --> 00:56:46,321
Or was that Calvin Klein?

579
00:56:49,574 --> 00:56:52,786
- Do you believe that?
- I wouldn't know.

580
00:56:53,036 --> 00:56:58,125
I don't allow myself to do that
Ash-Christabel grand passion thing.

581
00:56:58,375 --> 00:57:00,085
- Allow?
- No.

582
00:57:00,335 --> 00:57:04,798
Jealousy. Obsession. All that.
Not anymore.

583
00:57:05,048 --> 00:57:07,718
You're lucky, then.

584
00:57:07,968 --> 00:57:12,723
It all gets so...
Just such a tangle.

585
00:57:12,973 --> 00:57:17,269
It's a tangle most people want.

586
00:57:17,519 --> 00:57:20,063
Not me, though.

587
00:57:20,314 --> 00:57:24,693
My antics made
a lot of people unhappy.

588
00:57:24,943 --> 00:57:27,612
One horribly so.

589
00:57:31,366 --> 00:57:34,786
For me...

590
00:57:35,037 --> 00:57:39,750
...whenever I feel anything
for anyone...

591
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,419
...I go cold all over.

592
00:57:42,669 --> 00:57:47,966
- What makes you do that?
- Fear, I suppose.

593
00:57:48,216 --> 00:57:54,431
Fear of being burned up by love.

594
00:57:56,308 --> 00:57:59,227
- Listen to us.
- Yes.

595
00:57:59,478 --> 00:58:04,316
Aren't we just modern?

596
00:58:04,691 --> 00:58:08,820
Maud, you should let your hair out.
You should let it breathe.

597
00:58:09,071 --> 00:58:12,741
Don't do the icy thing. You have
nothing to worry about from me.

598
00:58:12,991 --> 00:58:21,083
- Christabel said, "Fear all men."
- Yeah, well, Christabel didn't know me.

599
00:58:21,416 --> 00:58:25,379
I don't want to take anything from you.

600
00:58:25,629 --> 00:58:28,215
So then we're both...

601
00:58:28,465 --> 00:58:33,762
...perfectly safe.
- Right.

602
00:59:20,767 --> 00:59:28,525
How can we bear it?
Every day we will have less.

603
00:59:34,031 --> 00:59:39,286
- Would you rather have had nothing?
- Oh, no.

604
00:59:39,536 --> 00:59:45,751
I thank God that if there
had to be a dragon, it was you.

605
01:00:31,713 --> 01:00:33,298
Wait.

606
01:00:33,548 --> 01:00:36,593
Wait.

607
01:00:41,723 --> 01:00:47,562
- I was trying to get out from the covers.
- No.

608
01:00:47,562 --> 01:00:52,442
We shouldn't be doing this.
It's dangerous.

609
01:00:52,859 --> 01:00:56,071
- I don't...
- Because I like you. I like you a lot.

610
01:00:56,321 --> 01:01:00,784
I just don't want to blow it here.

611
01:01:01,034 --> 01:01:07,124
- It doesn't matter to me, honestly.
- What do you mean?

612
01:01:12,838 --> 01:01:17,217
It's all right. We're probably just...

613
01:01:17,467 --> 01:01:22,431
These cramped quarters.
It was a mistake.

614
01:01:27,894 --> 01:01:32,399
I didn't mean that.

615
01:02:01,553 --> 01:02:05,015
Let's not beat the thing dead.

616
01:02:05,265 --> 01:02:11,188
- It happened. It's over. We're adults.
- Speak for yourself.

617
01:02:11,438 --> 01:02:17,819
I can't imagine what you're like after
you actually sleep with someone.

618
01:02:19,404 --> 01:02:24,534
Maud, I think that you are very...

619
01:02:24,785 --> 01:02:27,704
You know?

620
01:02:27,954 --> 01:02:32,042
No, I don't know.

621
01:02:33,001 --> 01:02:38,173
So we're friends now, is that it?

622
01:02:38,423 --> 01:02:42,970
- Yeah, but that's a lot.
- I agree, it's fine.

623
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:45,472
Yeah.

624
01:02:45,722 --> 01:02:48,725
It's perfect.

625
01:02:48,976 --> 01:02:51,561
Anyway, we're getting off the track.

626
01:02:51,812 --> 01:02:57,526
We came to investigate them,
not us.

627
01:03:08,036 --> 01:03:13,333
- So whatever happened to Blanche?
- Blanche drowned.

628
01:03:15,168 --> 01:03:18,588
- Where was Christabel?
- We don't know where she was.

629
01:03:18,839 --> 01:03:23,385
- The year before is a bit blank too.
- That entire year?

630
01:03:23,635 --> 01:03:30,642
There's speculation she went to France.
But I've nothing to support that.

631
01:03:30,892 --> 01:03:33,812
Okay, so...

632
01:03:34,062 --> 01:03:38,317
Christabel comes here with Ash,
then disappears. On paper, at least.

633
01:03:38,567 --> 01:03:40,902
Yes.

634
01:03:41,153 --> 01:03:46,575
- And Blanche suicides.
- Jesus.

635
01:03:52,873 --> 01:03:55,167
What are you doing?

636
01:03:55,417 --> 01:03:59,880
- It's a poem I've been writing.
- You're not pleased with it?

637
01:04:00,130 --> 01:04:05,677
On the contrary, I think it perfectly
expresses the joy I have felt with you.

638
01:04:05,927 --> 01:04:07,971
Then why that?

639
01:04:08,221 --> 01:04:11,433
These feelings,
I want them to survive.

640
01:04:11,683 --> 01:04:14,728
I know I can never declare
all this...

641
01:04:14,978 --> 01:04:16,772
This love.

642
01:04:17,022 --> 01:04:21,360
There, I've said it. I know it cannot
be declared to the world.

643
01:04:21,610 --> 01:04:28,075
All I may do is scatter these words from
the train and hope that they take root.

644
01:04:28,325 --> 01:04:33,538
They will flourish. I swear it.

645
01:05:21,545 --> 01:05:26,008
So, what next? I mean, for you?

646
01:05:26,258 --> 01:05:31,888
I'll check the archives to see where
Christabel might have been that year.

647
01:05:32,139 --> 01:05:34,057
Good.

648
01:05:34,308 --> 01:05:37,853
I guess I'll just...

649
01:05:38,103 --> 01:05:40,522
I don't know.

650
01:05:40,772 --> 01:05:46,862
Go look up shit on the microfiche.
Suffer over you.

651
01:05:47,112 --> 01:05:49,197
Goodbye.

652
01:05:49,448 --> 01:05:53,076
See you.

653
01:06:59,768 --> 01:07:02,229
Lost your way? Don't do tours here.

654
01:07:02,479 --> 01:07:04,731
- Sir George Bailey?
- Who wants to know?

655
01:07:04,982 --> 01:07:07,484
Professor Cropper,
curator of the Stant Collection...

656
01:07:07,734 --> 01:07:10,529
...Robert Owen University
in New Mexico.

657
01:07:10,779 --> 01:07:12,698
And this is Dr. Wolfe.

658
01:07:12,948 --> 01:07:18,328
- I'm a busy man. My wife's ill.
- I can quite understand that, sir.

659
01:07:18,578 --> 01:07:22,249
I believe you may be in possession
of some documents...

660
01:07:22,499 --> 01:07:27,421
...by Randolph Henry Ash.

661
01:07:28,088 --> 01:07:32,467
- Don't shoot.
- Get off my land.

662
01:07:33,093 --> 01:07:35,721
Do you have any idea
what we're talking about?

663
01:07:35,971 --> 01:07:41,601
Do you have any idea how much
such pieces, if they existed...

664
01:07:41,852 --> 01:07:46,940
...how much they would be worth?
- Worth?

665
01:07:54,031 --> 01:07:58,452
Mind if we swing past the university?
Bit of unfinished business.

666
01:07:58,702 --> 01:08:02,914
Miss Bailey, I presume.
The accomplice.

667
01:08:03,165 --> 01:08:05,959
The very same.

668
01:08:06,209 --> 01:08:11,131
- God! You're like Bonnie and Clyde.
- I needed a picture of her.

669
01:08:11,381 --> 01:08:14,551
I've never seen you like this.
Just go.

670
01:08:14,801 --> 01:08:19,723
Take the Porsche and go.

671
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:51,463
Fergus, what?

672
01:08:52,005 --> 01:08:58,095
If Fergus went out to get Indian food,
I'm gonna feel really stupid.

673
01:08:58,345 --> 01:09:00,138
No, he didn't.

674
01:09:00,389 --> 01:09:05,435
India wouldn't be
far enough away, actually.

675
01:09:06,728 --> 01:09:09,272
Come inside, I'll explain.

676
01:09:09,523 --> 01:09:13,527
You sure? I mean,
about me coming in?

677
01:09:13,777 --> 01:09:16,697
Yes, very.

678
01:09:16,947 --> 01:09:19,574
I left Fergus a message
from Seal Court...

679
01:09:19,825 --> 01:09:24,621
...which put him on our trail.
And he came here looking for answers.

680
01:09:24,871 --> 01:09:30,002
- He and Cropper from the sound of it.
- So that was Cropper's car outside.

681
01:09:30,252 --> 01:09:34,965
I think Fergus found something.
He's been spooking around the museum.

682
01:09:35,215 --> 01:09:38,969
Sending out a bunch of faxes.

683
01:09:39,219 --> 01:09:43,640
I wouldn't be so quick to do that.

684
01:09:47,894 --> 01:09:51,606
The British Museum fax log sheet.

685
01:09:51,857 --> 01:09:56,153
"To University of Nantes from Wolfe.
Subject: Christabel LaMotte."

686
01:09:56,403 --> 01:10:02,034
"Information on LaMotte genealogy.
Request journal of Sabine de Kercoz."

687
01:10:02,284 --> 01:10:05,912
Unfortunately for Fergus,
we have to log our faxes.

688
01:10:06,163 --> 01:10:09,833
You're shameless.

689
01:10:20,385 --> 01:10:22,471
So, what are we gonna do now?

690
01:10:22,721 --> 01:10:27,434
Are we gonna try
to beat him to France or...

691
01:10:29,436 --> 01:10:32,314
Or are we just gonna
stare at each other?

692
01:10:32,564 --> 01:10:35,984
That is the question, isn't it?

693
01:10:36,234 --> 01:10:38,987
- I have another one for you.
- What's that?

694
01:10:39,237 --> 01:10:43,575
What are you really doing here?

695
01:10:49,790 --> 01:10:54,252
I needed to see your face.

696
01:10:59,132 --> 01:11:03,637
I just want to let you know
whatever happened in Whitby...

697
01:11:03,887 --> 01:11:09,351
...which, unfortunately,
was not much...

698
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:15,983
...it's not because anything
that you did.

699
01:11:16,233 --> 01:11:19,987
Not at all.

700
01:11:20,862 --> 01:11:24,700
I just didn't want
to jump into something.

701
01:11:24,950 --> 01:11:28,704
I mean, I did and I do...

702
01:11:28,954 --> 01:11:30,914
...want to.

703
01:11:31,164 --> 01:11:34,835
Badly.

704
01:11:36,628 --> 01:11:41,174
I just didn't want to mess this up.

705
01:11:43,593 --> 01:11:46,013
And I just want to see...

706
01:11:46,263 --> 01:11:50,434
I want to see if there's an us...

707
01:11:50,684 --> 01:11:54,980
...in you and me.

708
01:11:58,025 --> 01:12:01,069
Would you like that?

709
01:12:09,244 --> 01:12:13,624
I'll take that as a "yes".

710
01:12:46,490 --> 01:12:49,076
When will she be back?

711
01:12:49,326 --> 01:12:54,081
Could you check for us?

712
01:13:18,772 --> 01:13:22,776
She will return on Thursday.

713
01:13:24,403 --> 01:13:31,243
What about you and your shoplifting?
I can't take you anywhere.

714
01:13:42,296 --> 01:13:43,755
"Dear Professor Wolfe:

715
01:13:44,006 --> 01:13:49,052
I have made another discovery.
Among Sabine's papers was her journal."

716
01:13:49,303 --> 01:13:53,223
"She writes about LaMotte's visit
to Brittany in 1859...

717
01:13:53,473 --> 01:13:58,645
<i>... and the subsequent arrival</i>
<i>of a mysterious visitor."</i>

718
01:15:01,917 --> 01:15:07,047
I know how things are.
I wish to help you.

719
01:15:07,297 --> 01:15:13,428
You know? Tell me, Cousin Sabine,
how do you think things are with me?

720
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:20,644
I am a grown woman, you are a girl.
I do not desire any help from you.

721
01:15:27,150 --> 01:15:32,698
<i>Christabel's condition became worse</i>
<i>after she received word from London...</i>

722
01:15:32,948 --> 01:15:38,578
<i>... that her close friend had died.</i>

723
01:16:11,695 --> 01:16:14,573
She left England
because she was pregnant...

724
01:16:14,823 --> 01:16:19,411
...and Blanche committed suicide.

725
01:16:22,789 --> 01:16:29,296
- What happened to the baby?
- Must've been stillborn. Or died.

726
01:16:29,546 --> 01:16:34,801
- Maybe it was taken in by a local family.
- And brought up here?

727
01:16:35,052 --> 01:16:37,721
I'd like to think that...

728
01:16:37,971 --> 01:16:40,807
...but I wonder.
- You wonder what?

729
01:16:41,058 --> 01:16:43,560
I don't know, I just...

730
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:49,024
She comes here alone,
hears that Blanche has killed herself.

731
01:16:49,274 --> 01:16:54,196
She's pregnant, distraught.

732
01:16:56,823 --> 01:17:03,080
- I mean, I've no evidence for it...
- Can you imagine how she felt?

733
01:17:03,330 --> 01:17:07,334
Yes, I can.

734
01:17:17,552 --> 01:17:20,347
So when do we see Christabel next?

735
01:17:20,597 --> 01:17:24,810
Autumn, 1860. In the references
to the Vestal Lights.

736
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:28,689
It was a group of women who
met with mediums regularly.

737
01:17:28,939 --> 01:17:33,193
Really? You know Ash
hated spiritualists, pretty openly.

738
01:17:33,443 --> 01:17:40,117
- Is it a connection worth tracking down?
- I don't know.

739
01:17:47,624 --> 01:17:53,880
Please, make a circle with your hands.

740
01:17:57,009 --> 01:18:00,971
Close your eyes.

741
01:18:04,266 --> 01:18:08,020
White earth. Valley.

742
01:18:08,270 --> 01:18:10,605
Waterfall.

743
01:18:10,856 --> 01:18:14,276
Child laughing.

744
01:18:14,526 --> 01:18:17,404
Two people.

745
01:18:17,654 --> 01:18:19,448
Deception.

746
01:18:19,698 --> 01:18:21,908
Letters.

747
01:18:22,159 --> 01:18:24,536
Two people.

748
01:18:24,786 --> 01:18:27,080
Words.

749
01:18:27,331 --> 01:18:30,626
- Death.
- What have you done?

750
01:18:30,876 --> 01:18:33,879
A field.

751
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:37,674
Where is the child?

752
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:46,683
What have you done with the child?

753
01:18:46,933 --> 01:18:51,647
You have made a murderess of me.

754
01:18:57,319 --> 01:19:03,367
"I understood that Mr. Ash was inquiring
about the spirit of his departed child."

755
01:19:03,617 --> 01:19:10,874
"But I am told that this could not be
the case as Mr. Ash is childless."

756
01:19:14,211 --> 01:19:19,883
Was there any mention
of Hella Lees in your research?

757
01:19:20,133 --> 01:19:22,260
I don't know.

758
01:19:22,511 --> 01:19:28,100
Nor do I care.
Look, I've got to get back.

759
01:19:28,183 --> 01:19:32,771
- What's going on?
- Nothing, I'm just tired. I should...

760
01:19:33,021 --> 01:19:36,733
Come on. What's wrong, seriously?

761
01:19:36,984 --> 01:19:41,154
I don't actually want to discover
anything else about them.

762
01:19:41,405 --> 01:19:44,616
Do you know?

763
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:46,994
I'm finding things out
that are...

764
01:19:47,244 --> 01:19:53,083
It's horrible, when you think about it,
really. Men and women together.

765
01:19:53,333 --> 01:19:55,877
She gave up her life, didn't she?

766
01:19:56,128 --> 01:20:00,882
A perfectly decent life I've always
admired. And for what? For nothing.

767
01:20:01,133 --> 01:20:03,635
- Not nothing.
- Really? For what, then?

768
01:20:03,885 --> 01:20:08,348
A child who died. A lover drowned.
And to what end?

769
01:20:08,598 --> 01:20:14,646
She and Ash. My own parents.
And every relationship I've ever had.

770
01:20:14,896 --> 01:20:19,818
It's all doomed. We can't seem to help
but just tear each other apart.

771
01:20:20,068 --> 01:20:25,282
Well, what about us? You didn't
include us. What about that?

772
01:20:25,532 --> 01:20:28,827
Look, l...

773
01:20:29,077 --> 01:20:34,124
I can't think about anything right now.

774
01:20:35,208 --> 01:20:39,671
So okay. So this is the icy,
pull back part then?

775
01:20:39,921 --> 01:20:44,509
- What?
- You get close. You pull away. You get...

776
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:47,888
- It's the pattern, right?
- What are you talking about?

777
01:20:48,138 --> 01:20:53,018
Your "fear men" mantra from Yorkshire,
that's what I'm talking about.

778
01:20:53,268 --> 01:20:56,605
If that's the way you play it,
that's the way you play it.

779
01:20:56,855 --> 01:20:59,775
Do you honestly believe that?

780
01:21:00,025 --> 01:21:03,320
Is that what you think this is to me,
a game?

781
01:21:03,570 --> 01:21:07,240
Is it?

782
01:21:09,743 --> 01:21:13,622
All this talk of us
really comes to nothing, doesn't it?

783
01:21:13,872 --> 01:21:18,752
Yes, I guess you're right.
It's nothing.

784
01:21:53,078 --> 01:21:55,872
<i>Dear Professor Blackadder:</i>

785
01:21:56,123 --> 01:21:59,459
<i>I did try to tell you</i>
<i>about my discovery before...</i>

786
01:21:59,710 --> 01:22:02,170
<i>... but found that I couldn't.</i>

787
01:22:02,421 --> 01:22:06,174
<i>Please read these two letters...</i>

788
01:22:06,425 --> 01:22:09,511
<i>... and you will begin to understand.</i>

789
01:22:09,761 --> 01:22:13,015
<i>I'm sorry for deceiving you.</i>

790
01:22:13,265 --> 01:22:15,475
<i>Sincerely...</i>

791
01:22:15,726 --> 01:22:19,688
<i>... Roland Michell.</i>

792
01:22:33,035 --> 01:22:36,913
It's well-documented that Ellen
set a box on Ash's coffin.

793
01:22:37,164 --> 01:22:41,168
A sealed container. We'd always
imagined it was just trinkets.

794
01:22:41,418 --> 01:22:45,380
But in light of Michell's discovery,
who knows what may be in it.

795
01:22:45,631 --> 01:22:47,799
Morally, that box is mine.

796
01:22:48,050 --> 01:22:51,219
Once you become Lord Ash,
it's absolutely yours.

797
01:22:51,470 --> 01:22:58,352
Until then, we keep it secret. Then you
discover it among old Lord Ash's things.

798
01:22:58,602 --> 01:23:03,273
Then I purchase it from you. It's all
aboveboard, no one the wiser.

799
01:23:03,523 --> 01:23:07,402
Cropper, you absolutely sure of that?

800
01:23:07,653 --> 01:23:08,612
Where is it?

801
01:23:08,862 --> 01:23:12,824
"I place this letter in his hands,
and if ghouls dig it up again...

802
01:23:13,075 --> 01:23:19,289
...then perhaps justice will be done
when I am not here to see it."

803
01:23:26,088 --> 01:23:27,506
<i>Dear Madam:</i>

804
01:23:27,756 --> 01:23:31,802
<i>We are older now,</i>
<i>and my fires, at last, are out.</i>

805
01:23:32,052 --> 01:23:35,430
<i>I know that you are</i>
<i>more than aware of my name...</i>

806
01:23:35,681 --> 01:23:39,434
<i>... but I find you must see it</i>
<i>in print one last time.</i>

807
01:23:39,685 --> 01:23:43,939
<i>It has been made known to me</i>
<i>that your husband is near to death.</i>

808
01:23:44,189 --> 01:23:49,111
<i>So I have writ down,</i>
<i>for his eyes only, some things.</i>

809
01:23:49,361 --> 01:23:54,491
<i>I find I cannot say what things</i>
<i>and have sealed the letter.</i>

810
01:23:54,741 --> 01:23:58,328
<i>If you wish to read it,</i>
<i>it is in your hands...</i>

811
01:23:58,578 --> 01:24:02,833
<i>... though I must hope</i>
<i>that he will see it first and decide.</i>

812
01:24:03,083 --> 01:24:09,840
<i>I have done great harm,</i>
<i>though I meant none to you.</i>

813
01:25:02,601 --> 01:25:07,397
I'll see they get back,
no questions asked.

814
01:25:07,648 --> 01:25:10,442
You're more enterprising
than I gave you credit for.

815
01:25:10,692 --> 01:25:13,528
Was there a compliment
in there somewhere?

816
01:25:13,779 --> 01:25:17,199
Yes. Probably.

817
01:25:17,949 --> 01:25:21,912
What I can't believe is Fergus Wolfe
conniving with Cropper.

818
01:25:22,162 --> 01:25:25,248
- I thought I was a better judge of men.
- That's where you went wrong.

819
01:25:25,499 --> 01:25:29,211
You gave him credit for being one.

820
01:25:30,420 --> 01:25:33,882
Thank you.

821
01:25:39,763 --> 01:25:42,349
- Thanks for coming.
- Sure.

822
01:25:42,599 --> 01:25:47,437
I believe that may be her.

823
01:25:47,980 --> 01:25:53,777
- I'm sorry, I lost it totally.
- No, I'm sorry. Honestly, it wasn't you.

824
01:25:54,027 --> 01:25:58,490
So why don't we all talk
some strategy?

825
01:25:58,740 --> 01:26:03,245
Let me introduce you to...
Professor Blackadder, Paola...

826
01:26:03,495 --> 01:26:07,291
...this is Dr. Bailey.
- Maud.

827
01:26:07,541 --> 01:26:09,543
How do you do?

828
01:26:09,793 --> 01:26:16,300
So do we really think that Cropper's
capable of robbing a grave?

829
01:26:20,554 --> 01:26:26,893
- The idea of opening a grave's creepy.
- Let's just keep going.

830
01:26:27,144 --> 01:26:28,687
Jesus.

831
01:26:28,937 --> 01:26:34,526
<i>Moping owl doth to moon complain</i>

832
01:26:34,735 --> 01:26:37,904
Are you ready?

833
01:26:38,155 --> 01:26:42,075
Hold the light up.

834
01:26:56,381 --> 01:26:58,967
Fergus! Fergus!

835
01:26:59,217 --> 01:27:03,263
- That it?
- Yes. It's gotta be.

836
01:27:03,513 --> 01:27:07,434
I found it, Fergus. I found it.

837
01:27:13,899 --> 01:27:16,777
Oh, my God.

838
01:27:17,027 --> 01:27:19,154
I found it, Fergus.

839
01:27:19,404 --> 01:27:21,198
Great!

840
01:27:21,448 --> 01:27:23,367
Hey, Cropper.

841
01:27:23,617 --> 01:27:26,411
Cropper!

842
01:27:31,208 --> 01:27:35,420
This has nothing to do
with you people.

843
01:27:44,179 --> 01:27:46,556
Get off of me! Get off!

844
01:27:46,807 --> 01:27:48,850
No, you don't!

845
01:27:49,101 --> 01:27:53,689
You traitor, you! Bloody conniver!

846
01:27:59,903 --> 01:28:03,156
What are you doing?

847
01:28:25,887 --> 01:28:29,391
- Are you sure we should do this?
- I said we'd take a look...

848
01:28:29,641 --> 01:28:32,936
...before we handed it over
to the museum.

849
01:28:33,186 --> 01:28:36,732
Can you hold that there?

850
01:28:53,123 --> 01:28:56,168
Maud, look at this.

851
01:29:11,767 --> 01:29:15,145
It's her handwriting.

852
01:29:42,297 --> 01:29:45,175
"My dear, my dear:

853
01:29:45,425 --> 01:29:48,261
They tell me you are very ill."

854
01:29:48,512 --> 01:29:54,559
"Perhaps I am wrong to disturb you at
this time with unseasonable memories."

855
01:29:54,810 --> 01:29:56,937
"But I find I have...

856
01:29:57,187 --> 01:30:01,817
...after all, a thing
which I must tell you."

857
01:30:01,900 --> 01:30:08,991
"You will say it should've been told
20 years ago but I could, or would not."

858
01:30:09,116 --> 01:30:13,036
"You have a daughter...

859
01:30:13,036 --> 01:30:18,917
...who is well and married
and the mother of a beautiful boy."

860
01:30:19,167 --> 01:30:23,505
"I sent you her picture."

861
01:30:26,758 --> 01:30:29,761
"You will see she resembles
both her parents...

862
01:30:30,012 --> 01:30:33,515
...neither of whom she knows
to be her parent."

863
01:30:33,765 --> 01:30:39,187
<i>"When I said at that terrible séance</i>
<i>that you had made a murderess of me...</i>

864
01:30:39,438 --> 01:30:45,277
<i>... I was speaking of poor Blanche,</i>
<i>whose end torments me daily."</i>

865
01:30:45,527 --> 01:30:53,410
<i>"And I thought, let him think so then,</i>
<i>if he knows me so little."</i>

866
01:30:53,702 --> 01:30:55,662
"I had a secret fear, you see."

867
01:30:55,912 --> 01:31:00,500
"I was afraid you would take her,
you and your wife, for your own."

868
01:31:00,751 --> 01:31:04,630
"But I could not let her go."

869
01:31:06,548 --> 01:31:08,967
<i>And so I hid her from you.</i>

870
01:31:09,217 --> 01:31:12,638
<i>And you from her.</i>

871
01:31:12,888 --> 01:31:16,600
<i>She loves her adoptive parents</i>
<i>most deeply.</i>

872
01:31:16,850 --> 01:31:18,977
<i>Me, she does not love.</i>

873
01:31:19,227 --> 01:31:24,483
<i>So I am punished, living at Seal Court</i>
<i>with them and watching her grow.</i>

874
01:31:24,733 --> 01:31:29,363
<i>I have been angry</i>
<i>for so long with all of us.</i>

875
01:31:29,613 --> 01:31:36,203
<i>And now near the end,</i>
<i>I think of you again with clear love.</i>

876
01:31:36,453 --> 01:31:38,747
<i>Did we not?</i>

877
01:31:38,997 --> 01:31:43,877
<i>Did you not flame and I catch fire?</i>

878
01:31:44,127 --> 01:31:49,257
<i>Was not the love that we found</i>
<i>worth the tempest that it brought?</i>

879
01:31:49,508 --> 01:31:53,512
<i>I feel it was. I know it was.</i>

880
01:31:53,762 --> 01:31:57,933
"If you are able, please send me a sign
that you have read this."

881
01:31:58,183 --> 01:32:02,688
"I dare not ask if you forgive."

882
01:32:03,939 --> 01:32:07,818
"Christabel LaMotte."

883
01:32:09,444 --> 01:32:12,614
Ash never read this.

884
01:32:12,864 --> 01:32:15,993
He never knew he had a child.

885
01:32:16,243 --> 01:32:20,956
You're descended from
both Christabel and Ash.

886
01:32:21,206 --> 01:32:25,127
My God!

887
01:32:25,961 --> 01:32:28,630
All these clues...

888
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:32,217
...they're for you.

889
01:32:32,759 --> 01:32:36,179
For us.

890
01:32:48,317 --> 01:32:52,404
You're so beautiful.

891
01:33:20,641 --> 01:33:25,812
<i>There are things that happen</i>
<i>not spoken or written of.</i>

892
01:33:26,063 --> 01:33:28,482
<i>A poet walked out</i>
<i>one summer's day...</i>

893
01:33:28,732 --> 01:33:33,654
<i>... seeking forgiveness</i>
<i>from a love long lost.</i>

894
01:33:33,987 --> 01:33:38,450
<i>He found something else instead.</i>

895
01:33:38,909 --> 01:33:42,954
<i>This is how it was.</i>

896
01:33:49,002 --> 01:33:50,629
Morning.

897
01:33:50,879 --> 01:33:53,840
- Good morning.
- What's your name?

898
01:33:54,091 --> 01:33:58,303
May Bailey. But I have
another name I don't like.

899
01:33:58,553 --> 01:34:01,473
Do you?

900
01:34:01,723 --> 01:34:03,392
What's that?

901
01:34:03,642 --> 01:34:07,396
Maia Thomason Bailey.

902
01:34:11,692 --> 01:34:15,112
Well...

903
01:34:16,321 --> 01:34:19,449
Maia was the...

904
01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:22,327
The mother of Hermes.

905
01:34:22,577 --> 01:34:27,457
- And I know a waterfall called Thomason.
- A waterfall? Really?

906
01:34:27,708 --> 01:34:31,003
Yes, in Yorkshire.

907
01:34:31,253 --> 01:34:35,674
With a lovely cave hidden behind it.

908
01:34:35,924 --> 01:34:37,426
Where do you live?

909
01:34:37,676 --> 01:34:41,305
I live in the house there.
And my mother lives there...

910
01:34:41,555 --> 01:34:45,600
...and my father and my two brothers.

911
01:34:45,851 --> 01:34:49,771
And my Aunt Christabel too.

912
01:34:50,272 --> 01:34:54,359
Yes, I think I know your mother.

913
01:34:56,528 --> 01:34:59,114
You have the true look of her.

914
01:34:59,364 --> 01:35:05,454
No one else says that.
I think I look like my father.

915
01:35:06,121 --> 01:35:09,916
You look like your father too.

916
01:35:11,376 --> 01:35:14,296
Can you make daisy chains?

917
01:35:14,546 --> 01:35:17,799
Yes.

918
01:35:19,217 --> 01:35:23,513
Yes, I'll make you a crown.

919
01:35:23,972 --> 01:35:26,767
But...

920
01:35:27,017 --> 01:35:30,604
...would you give me
a lock of your hair?

921
01:35:30,854 --> 01:35:34,775
Like fairy story.

922
01:35:35,359 --> 01:35:38,528
Just so.

923
01:35:48,580 --> 01:35:49,915
Now...

924
01:35:50,165 --> 01:35:52,334
Would you take this note...

925
01:35:52,584 --> 01:35:56,004
...give it to your aunt?

926
01:35:56,546 --> 01:36:01,843
Tell her that you saw a poet
who was coming to meet her...

927
01:36:02,094 --> 01:36:03,845
...but met you instead.

928
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:08,016
I'll try to remember.

929
01:36:08,100 --> 01:36:11,395
Thank you.
