How are you doing today,
Maggie?

00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:18,190
Looking pretty good.

8
00:00:18,225 --> 00:00:19,088
Let me see those paws.

9
00:00:19,122 --> 00:00:20,330
Why so grumpy?

10
00:00:20,365 --> 00:00:22,056

All right, Puggles.

22
00:00:46,253 --> 00:00:47,357
I'm going
to take your bandage off.

23
00:00:49,394 --> 00:00:50,188
Is it going to hurt?

24
00:00:50,222 --> 00:00:52,155
No, of course not.

25
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,708
You might be stiff
for a little while,

26
00:00:53,743 --> 00:00:54,813
but that's normal.

27
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:56,677
How is it
when you talk to them

28
00:00:56,711 --> 00:00:58,230
it seems like
they're really listening?

29
00:00:58,265 --> 00:01:00,715
I... I'm not talking to them.

30
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,200
I mean,
am talking to them,

31
00:01:02,234 --> 00:01:03,718
but it's just
to make them feel better.

32
00:01:03,753 --> 00:01:05,203
How was your day?

33
00:01:05,237 --> 00:01:06,790
Productive.

34
00:01:06,825 --> 00:01:08,620
So...

35
00:01:08,654 --> 00:01:11,278
Did you come up
with any new toys?

36
00:01:11,312 --> 00:01:12,555
Well, I'm
working on it.

37
00:01:12,589 --> 00:01:13,349
But what I did
come up with

38
00:01:13,383 --> 00:01:15,109
is a surprise for you.

39
00:01:15,144 --> 00:01:17,870
A surprise?

40
00:01:17,905 --> 00:01:19,596
Before Christmas?

41
00:01:19,631 --> 00:01:21,288
Don't worry,
there's no obstacles.

42
00:01:21,322 --> 00:01:22,220
Okay.

43
00:01:22,254 --> 00:01:23,669
It's all good.

44
00:01:23,704 --> 00:01:25,499
My gosh,
what are you doing?

45
00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:27,156
Nothing.
We're just out walking.

46
00:01:28,502 --> 00:01:30,400
-No peeking.
-Okay.

47
00:01:30,435 --> 00:01:31,401
-One more step.
-Okay.

48
00:01:31,436 --> 00:01:32,816
Here you go.

49
00:01:32,851 --> 00:01:33,921
All right. Still not looking?

50
00:01:33,955 --> 00:01:36,510
-No.
-No? I've got a spot.

51
00:01:36,544 --> 00:01:39,927
-All right.
-All right. Yeah? Yeah, yeah?

52
00:01:39,961 --> 00:01:40,928
All right.

53
00:01:40,962 --> 00:01:42,550
And... look.

54
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,936
What do you think?

55
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,283
I love it.

56
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,287
Classic.

57
00:01:56,978 --> 00:01:58,532
Probably a loose bulb
just needs to be tightened.

58
00:02:01,328 --> 00:02:03,261
So, listen,
I was, you know, thinking

59
00:02:03,295 --> 00:02:04,469
now that your apartment

60
00:02:04,503 --> 00:02:06,195
is all decked out
for the holidays,

61
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:09,232
maybe you'd want to invite
your parents over for Christmas?

62
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:10,647
You know, we've been together
for a while now,

63
00:02:10,682 --> 00:02:12,649
and I'd just really
love to meet them.

64
00:02:12,684 --> 00:02:14,272
Um...

65
00:02:18,276 --> 00:02:19,587
Please hold.

66
00:02:19,622 --> 00:02:21,658
I have an extra
set of lights.

67
00:02:23,488 --> 00:02:24,696
You know, the holidays

68
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,491
are a really busy time
for my parents,

69
00:02:26,525 --> 00:02:27,492
and Christmas is only

70
00:02:27,526 --> 00:02:29,666
a couple of weeks
away.

71
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:31,427
So, um...

72
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,499
But maybe next year,
you know?

73
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:35,534
Got it!

74
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:38,434
Whoa.

75
00:02:38,468 --> 00:02:39,435
I guess it fixed itself.

76
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:40,608
Yeah.

77
00:02:40,643 --> 00:02:42,507
You were right...
Just a loose bulb.

78
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:44,440
You understand

79
00:02:44,474 --> 00:02:46,718
about my parents, right?

80
00:02:46,752 --> 00:02:47,581
Um...

81
00:02:47,615 --> 00:02:49,962
I do...

82
00:02:49,997 --> 00:02:51,619
Look, there's
something really special

83
00:02:51,654 --> 00:02:53,276
that I want to do
this Christmas,

84
00:02:53,311 --> 00:02:55,451
something that
I want to ask you.

85
00:02:55,485 --> 00:02:57,453
But before I do that,

86
00:02:57,487 --> 00:02:59,386
I need to ask
your parents,

87
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,215
your father, in particular.

88
00:03:07,566 --> 00:03:10,293
Are you... Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

89
00:03:12,571 --> 00:03:15,333
Look, Holly.

90
00:03:15,367 --> 00:03:17,680
Holly, I love you.

91
00:03:17,714 --> 00:03:20,648
Okay? I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

92
00:03:20,683 --> 00:03:22,754
I just want
to do it right.

93
00:03:22,788 --> 00:03:24,514
I want to ask your dad
if it's okay.

94
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:26,551
Wow.

95
00:03:26,585 --> 00:03:28,553
Boy, um...

96
00:03:28,587 --> 00:03:30,244
Hey...

97
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:31,659
I've got a great idea.

98
00:03:31,694 --> 00:03:33,592
You were saying your parents
are always too busy,

99
00:03:33,627 --> 00:03:35,560
they can't come here.
Why don't we go there?

100
00:03:35,594 --> 00:03:36,561
No, Connor,

101
00:03:36,595 --> 00:03:38,494
they live way, way up north.

102
00:03:38,528 --> 00:03:41,393
But you know
what we can do?

103
00:03:41,428 --> 00:03:42,739
We can screentime them.

104
00:03:42,774 --> 00:03:44,431
Wouldn't that
be great?

105
00:03:44,465 --> 00:03:45,570
No, I kind of want
to do it in person.

106
00:03:45,604 --> 00:03:47,330
You know, I mean,
besides,

107
00:03:47,365 --> 00:03:49,367
if we're really ready
to take this next step,

108
00:03:49,401 --> 00:03:53,025
don't you think it's time
I met your parents?

109
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,273
Hello-ho-ho.

110
00:03:59,308 --> 00:04:00,343
How can I help you?

111
00:04:00,378 --> 00:04:01,344
Hey, Uncle Mario.

112
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:02,552
It's Holly.

113
00:04:03,726 --> 00:04:05,659
How are you doing, Jingles?

114
00:04:05,693 --> 00:04:06,798
I'm great.

115
00:04:06,832 --> 00:04:09,490
I'm coming home for Christmas...

116
00:04:09,525 --> 00:04:11,596
with my boyfriend, Connor.

117
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,045
Hey, Uncle Mario.
It's Connor.

118
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,497
Well, well, well,
won't your parents be tickled!

119
00:04:16,532 --> 00:04:17,498
I'd get them on the line,

120
00:04:17,533 --> 00:04:18,844
but they're off

121
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:21,675
making sure
that the sleigh's flying right.

122
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:22,848
Right, because
it's so fast,

123
00:04:22,883 --> 00:04:24,609
it's like
it's practically flying.

124
00:04:24,643 --> 00:04:26,369
Um, speaking of which,

125
00:04:26,404 --> 00:04:29,441
can you get Mom and Dad
prepared for our arrival

126
00:04:29,476 --> 00:04:32,824
and make sure that everything
is running... smoothly?

127
00:04:32,858 --> 00:04:34,791
You got it, Chestnut.

128
00:04:34,826 --> 00:04:36,517
I'll pick you up
at the airport.

129
00:04:36,552 --> 00:04:38,795
I've got to go...

130
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,867
It's time for the elves'
cocoa break.

131
00:04:41,902 --> 00:04:44,353
Yeah, okay.

132
00:04:46,596 --> 00:04:48,702
Uncle Mario,
he's such a kidder.

133
00:04:48,736 --> 00:04:50,738
Yeah.

134
00:04:57,607 --> 00:04:58,850
Morning, boys and girls.

135
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:02,543
Can you guess
what I have in here?

136
00:05:02,578 --> 00:05:04,545
Any takers? No?

137
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,583
All right, this is Fido,

138
00:05:07,617 --> 00:05:08,446
all right?

139
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,586
And he wants to be

140
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,794
your best friend.

141
00:05:14,383 --> 00:05:15,625
Yes.

142
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,351
Does it make any sound effects?

143
00:05:17,386 --> 00:05:19,388
No, but you can absolutely
make your own sound effects.

144
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,667
Does it come with an app?

145
00:05:22,701 --> 00:05:24,772
No,
but the great thing about Fido

146
00:05:24,807 --> 00:05:26,878
is that doesn't need
to be synced up.

147
00:05:26,912 --> 00:05:29,777
Put those back on...

148
00:05:29,812 --> 00:05:31,676
He's compatible
just the way that he is.

149
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:32,815
Does anybody
want to play with him?

150
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:34,817
Anybody?

151
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:35,818
You want to... give it a try?

152
00:05:35,852 --> 00:05:37,406
Anybody?

153
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,032
Okay!

154
00:05:43,066 --> 00:05:44,758
Well, that's all we're going
to need from you today,

155
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:46,069
boys and girls.

156
00:05:46,104 --> 00:05:48,589
Now, there is a docking bay
right over there

157
00:05:48,624 --> 00:05:49,832
where you can plug in
your electronics,

158
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:51,523
and there's
some snacks

159
00:05:51,558 --> 00:05:52,800
over there
in the staff room.

160
00:05:52,835 --> 00:05:54,388
Go get 'em!

161
00:05:56,045 --> 00:05:57,702
Little rascals.

162
00:06:01,878 --> 00:06:03,846
That toy was lame.

163
00:06:08,644 --> 00:06:09,852
Stuart, Wesley, Kelly!

164
00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:16,686
Well,

165
00:06:16,721 --> 00:06:18,067
thanks to Connor here,

166
00:06:18,101 --> 00:06:20,069
you can kiss your little
Christmas party goodbye

167
00:06:20,103 --> 00:06:22,105
because you're all

168
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,624
going to be too busy

169
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:25,108
coming up
with a better idea

170
00:06:25,143 --> 00:06:26,938
than a wooden dog
with wheels.

171
00:06:28,802 --> 00:06:30,838
I... I got something.

172
00:06:30,873 --> 00:06:32,184
Hit me.

173
00:06:32,219 --> 00:06:36,948
Um, what about
a hunky Santa doll?

174
00:06:36,982 --> 00:06:38,777
You know,
for the teen market.

175
00:06:38,812 --> 00:06:39,778
Um, I think

176
00:06:39,813 --> 00:06:40,952
that was my idea.

177
00:06:40,986 --> 00:06:42,056
Since when?

178
00:06:42,091 --> 00:06:43,782
Yesterday,
by the water coolers?

179
00:06:43,817 --> 00:06:45,612
I thought you were
talking about your date.

180
00:06:45,646 --> 00:06:46,923
Yeah, I was.

181
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,926
A hunky Santa doll.

182
00:06:51,756 --> 00:06:52,653
Yeah.

183
00:06:55,725 --> 00:06:57,037
You might have something there.

184
00:07:01,075 --> 00:07:03,492
That's more
like it.

185
00:07:06,011 --> 00:07:07,081
So get busy!

186
00:07:16,263 --> 00:07:18,783
So we'll have two stopovers
before we fly into Nunavut,

187
00:07:18,817 --> 00:07:19,887
and then after that,

188
00:07:19,922 --> 00:07:21,199
Uncle Mario is going
to pick us up

189
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,718
and drive us
the rest of the way up north.

190
00:07:22,752 --> 00:07:24,513
It's a bit of a trek,

191
00:07:24,547 --> 00:07:26,515
but we should make
good time in Dad's car.

192
00:07:26,549 --> 00:07:28,033
Connor? Your lunch?

193
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:30,829
Right, yeah. Yeah, thank you.

194
00:07:31,761 --> 00:07:32,659
Are you okay?

195
00:07:32,693 --> 00:07:33,970
Yeah.

196
00:07:34,005 --> 00:07:35,040
Yeah,
everything's fine.

197
00:07:35,075 --> 00:07:36,835
Okay.

198
00:07:39,873 --> 00:07:41,081
Way to go, Connor.

199
00:07:41,115 --> 00:07:42,531
Yeah,
thanks a lot.

200
00:07:42,565 --> 00:07:43,670
The Christmas party
was my only chance

201
00:07:43,704 --> 00:07:44,912
with Deb
from accounting.

202
00:07:44,947 --> 00:07:46,086
Yeah, in your dreams, Wesley.

203
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,744
Dreams can
become reality.

204
00:07:48,778 --> 00:07:50,780
What's going on?

205
00:07:50,815 --> 00:07:51,919
Wegman canceled
the Christmas party

206
00:07:51,954 --> 00:07:53,921
thanks to me
and my toy.

207
00:07:53,956 --> 00:07:55,785
Connor.

208
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,097
Yeah, I don't know what it is,

209
00:07:57,131 --> 00:07:58,063
but I just can't
get the kids interested

210
00:07:58,098 --> 00:07:58,926
these days.

211
00:07:58,961 --> 00:08:00,031
And all Wegman wants

212
00:08:00,065 --> 00:08:01,791
is, like, some
flash-pan toy

213
00:08:01,826 --> 00:08:03,172
like
a hulky Christmas Santa doll,

214
00:08:03,206 --> 00:08:04,967
and that's popular,
you know, in the moment,

215
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:06,865
but it doesn't stand
the test of time,

216
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,833
not like the toys
that I make.

217
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:10,179
Well,

218
00:08:10,213 --> 00:08:13,769
maybe you'll get inspired
at my parents' place.

219
00:08:33,892 --> 00:08:35,066
That him?

220
00:08:36,377 --> 00:08:37,620
Yeah! I think
that's him.

221
00:08:37,655 --> 00:08:38,932
-Can you grab the...
-Okay.

222
00:08:38,966 --> 00:08:40,761
Uncle Mario!

223
00:08:40,796 --> 00:08:43,212
Chestnut!

224
00:08:43,246 --> 00:08:44,627
How ya doin'?

225
00:08:44,662 --> 00:08:46,905
I couldn't be better.

226
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,287
Well, you still look
pretty as a snowflake.

227
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:51,082
Although, you know,

228
00:08:51,116 --> 00:08:53,049
you could put a little sugar
on your bones.

229
00:08:53,084 --> 00:08:54,568
Aw...

230
00:08:54,603 --> 00:08:57,053
Well, Mario,
this is my boyfriend, Connor.

231
00:08:57,088 --> 00:08:58,572
Nice to meet you, Mario.

232
00:08:58,607 --> 00:09:01,230
Yeah, well,
he's, skinny, too.

233
00:09:02,265 --> 00:09:04,164
Well,
no worries...

234
00:09:04,198 --> 00:09:06,580
We got lots of goodies at home
to fatten you both up

235
00:09:06,615 --> 00:09:07,961
for Christmas.

236
00:09:07,995 --> 00:09:10,860
Well, away we go!

237
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,147
Geez, you weren't kidding,

238
00:09:22,182 --> 00:09:25,254
when you said your parents
live up north.

239
00:09:26,289 --> 00:09:27,256
So,

240
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,983
how long
till we get there?

241
00:09:30,017 --> 00:09:31,087
It...

242
00:09:31,122 --> 00:09:32,606
shouldn't be
that much longer.

243
00:09:32,641 --> 00:09:36,645
Here, try some of my
special hot cocoa.

244
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:38,336
Yes, please.

245
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,924
Yeah,
it's a home brew.

246
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:40,925
Yeah?

247
00:09:42,305 --> 00:09:44,135
It's very hot.

248
00:09:48,726 --> 00:09:50,348
Thank you.

249
00:09:52,177 --> 00:09:54,317
Smells delicious.

250
00:09:54,352 --> 00:09:56,354
Bottoms up.

251
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:01,359
Wow.

252
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:02,360
Mario,

253
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:03,603
seriously.

254
00:10:04,811 --> 00:10:06,122
That's, like, some good hock.

255
00:10:13,751 --> 00:10:14,717
All right, Jingles.

256
00:10:14,752 --> 00:10:15,994
Are you ready to go home?

257
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:17,340
Ready.

258
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:20,723
Wow, Mario,
you've sure souped up this ride.

259
00:10:20,758 --> 00:10:24,209
You have no idea.

260
00:10:25,832 --> 00:10:27,627
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

261
00:10:52,099 --> 00:10:53,238
Whoa.

262
00:11:00,936 --> 00:11:02,972
Snowball! Snowball!

263
00:11:03,007 --> 00:11:03,904
Whoa, whoa!

264
00:11:03,939 --> 00:11:05,492
I'm sorry,

265
00:11:05,526 --> 00:11:07,736
we don't get a lot
of visitors up here,

266
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:10,152
so he gets
a bit excited.

267
00:11:10,186 --> 00:11:13,465
Nick. You must be Connor.

268
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,984
Yeah. Nice to meet you,
Mr. Klaus.

269
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:17,193
Actually, it's "Claus".

270
00:11:17,228 --> 00:11:19,264
I could have sworn
it was "Klaus".

271
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:21,335
Klaus, Claus,
potato, patato...

272
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,854
same name, really.

273
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:24,442
Honey, you must be
so hungry

274
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:26,271
from that nap.

275
00:11:26,306 --> 00:11:27,341
Yeah, wow. Talk about
hitting the snooze button.

276
00:11:27,376 --> 00:11:29,171
Don't make the poor guy
just freeze out here.

277
00:11:29,205 --> 00:11:31,345
I am the mother.
Come in, come in.

278
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,175
-Come on.
-All right.

279
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:34,970
There we go. Come on.

280
00:11:35,004 --> 00:11:37,835
Get in there,
get the chill off your bones.

281
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,492
Welcome, welcome.

282
00:11:40,527 --> 00:11:41,528
Watch your step here.

283
00:11:41,562 --> 00:11:42,771
Come on in.

284
00:11:42,805 --> 00:11:45,428
Make yourself
comfortable.

285
00:11:45,463 --> 00:11:47,361
Wow, this place is amazing.

286
00:11:47,396 --> 00:11:50,157
This is all
my wife's doing.

287
00:11:53,782 --> 00:11:54,783
Wow.

288
00:11:56,198 --> 00:11:58,959
You must have the best
decorations in town.

289
00:11:58,994 --> 00:12:00,202
Well, I should hope so.

290
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,376
Would you care
for a tour?

291
00:12:02,411 --> 00:12:03,515
Are you sure, Dad?

292
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,414
There's not much to see,
is there?

293
00:12:05,448 --> 00:12:06,898
Well, don't worry,
I'll give Connor the short tour.

294
00:12:06,933 --> 00:12:08,555
Come on, come on.

295
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:10,281
Yeah, yeah, do that one,
because dinner's almost ready.

296
00:12:10,315 --> 00:12:11,972
Can't keep
the ladies waiting.

297
00:12:12,007 --> 00:12:13,802
Come on, come on.

298
00:12:15,355 --> 00:12:19,186
Lordie, that boy's gonna
need some fattening up.

299
00:12:19,221 --> 00:12:20,360
Let's go make the beds.

300
00:12:22,396 --> 00:12:24,433
I have to admit

301
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:25,986
I was a little
surprised to hear

302
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:28,817
that you were
bringing Connor up with you.

303
00:12:28,851 --> 00:12:31,992
Is this serious?

304
00:12:32,027 --> 00:12:33,476
Well, yes, it is.

305
00:12:33,511 --> 00:12:34,788
Um...

306
00:12:34,823 --> 00:12:37,826
I think he's
planning to propose.

307
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,310
Propose?

308
00:12:39,344 --> 00:12:40,587
Holly...

309
00:12:40,621 --> 00:12:42,347
Well, are you sure?

310
00:12:42,382 --> 00:12:44,142
I mean, Connor's lovely
and everything,

311
00:12:44,177 --> 00:12:47,180
but, um... Jack?

312
00:12:47,905 --> 00:12:49,838
What about Jack?

313
00:12:49,872 --> 00:12:54,428
Well, you always seemed
like such a good fit.

314
00:12:54,463 --> 00:12:57,086
Plus he knows your family
and the business,

315
00:12:57,121 --> 00:13:01,401
not to mention
he's already prepared.

316
00:13:01,435 --> 00:13:04,335
Are you sure
that Connor's the one?

317
00:13:04,369 --> 00:13:07,821
Yes, Mom.

318
00:13:07,856 --> 00:13:10,582
He's everything that
I could have wished for.

319
00:13:10,617 --> 00:13:16,174
He's kind, and he's generous,
and he adores kids.

320
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:18,418
He even makes toys
for a living.

321
00:13:18,452 --> 00:13:20,592
I've never met anybody
who loves Christmas

322
00:13:20,627 --> 00:13:22,249
more than he does...

323
00:13:22,284 --> 00:13:23,423
besides us.

324
00:13:24,907 --> 00:13:28,255
Well... I guess
he'll do fine.

325
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,429
Hey, come on, Connor,

326
00:13:29,463 --> 00:13:30,948
I'll show you the barn.

327
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:37,333
Hey...

328
00:13:46,377 --> 00:13:47,343
What do you keep
in here?

329
00:13:47,378 --> 00:13:48,620
Horses?

330
00:13:48,655 --> 00:13:50,070
Something even better.

331
00:13:53,694 --> 00:13:55,110
What are those?

332
00:13:55,144 --> 00:13:57,871
Those, my boy,
are reindeer.

333
00:13:57,906 --> 00:13:59,045
For real?

334
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:00,322
You bet.

335
00:14:01,668 --> 00:14:04,291
All of them!

336
00:14:04,326 --> 00:14:05,948
Whoa.

337
00:14:05,983 --> 00:14:08,226
I've never seen reindeer
in real life.

338
00:14:08,261 --> 00:14:09,503
What do you use them for?

339
00:14:09,538 --> 00:14:10,539
Well...

340
00:14:10,573 --> 00:14:11,609
We use them for the sleigh!

341
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:13,231
Rides!

342
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:15,578
My parents own
a lot of property up here,

343
00:14:15,613 --> 00:14:17,063
and they like to give
authentic sleigh rides

344
00:14:17,097 --> 00:14:17,960
to the visitors.

345
00:14:17,995 --> 00:14:18,892
Right, Dad?

346
00:14:20,411 --> 00:14:21,653
Something like that.

347
00:14:21,688 --> 00:14:23,241
What?

348
00:14:23,276 --> 00:14:25,174
I thought you said
you didn't get many visitors.

349
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:27,694
Gosh, guys, we are going
to get in trouble

350
00:14:27,728 --> 00:14:28,937
if we make dinner
cold.

351
00:14:28,971 --> 00:14:31,387
Chop, chop.

352
00:14:31,422 --> 00:14:32,630
Come on.

353
00:14:37,497 --> 00:14:40,396
Will you look at that.

354
00:14:40,431 --> 00:14:41,397
Wow.

355
00:14:42,951 --> 00:14:45,160
So, what we have here now

356
00:14:45,194 --> 00:14:47,403
is beef tenderloin
with chocolate sauce,

357
00:14:47,438 --> 00:14:49,164
sugared carrots,

358
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:50,924
and Holly's favorite dessert,

359
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,167
a holiday trifle.

360
00:14:52,201 --> 00:14:54,031
Welcome home, darling.

361
00:14:54,065 --> 00:14:54,997
Thank you, Mom.

362
00:14:57,137 --> 00:14:58,242
Should we wait
for your uncle Mario?

363
00:14:58,276 --> 00:14:59,415
No, don't worry about him.

364
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,589
He's probably
just tinkering away

365
00:15:00,623 --> 00:15:01,693
on something
down in the factory...

366
00:15:04,558 --> 00:15:06,595
So I have some good news.

367
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:09,149
I am officially
a part of the veterinary team

368
00:15:09,184 --> 00:15:10,633
at Secord clinic.

369
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,740
Ho, ho, ho,
that is something!

370
00:15:13,774 --> 00:15:15,190
It is.

371
00:15:15,224 --> 00:15:16,191
She's incredible,
actually.

372
00:15:16,225 --> 00:15:18,020
She just has such a way

373
00:15:18,055 --> 00:15:19,125
with animals.

374
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:20,264
That's my girl.

375
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:23,025
And so, Connor,

376
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,682
what do you do
to keep yourself busy?

377
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:27,029
I work
for a toy manufacturer.

378
00:15:27,064 --> 00:15:28,272
Wegman's.

379
00:15:28,306 --> 00:15:30,205
You guys ever
heard of it?

380
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:30,999
Wegman's...

381
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:32,207
I may have.

382
00:15:32,241 --> 00:15:33,691
The elves would know...

383
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:36,521
Connor is an amazing
toy creator.

384
00:15:36,556 --> 00:15:38,385
Aren't you, Connor?

385
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,525
Well, I mean,
I'd hardly say that.

386
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,320
My last idea
actually tanked so bad

387
00:15:42,355 --> 00:15:45,530
that Mr. Wegman
canceled the Christmas party.

388
00:15:45,565 --> 00:15:47,049
Well, bah humbug to that!

389
00:15:47,084 --> 00:15:49,051
You give me
his whole name

390
00:15:49,086 --> 00:15:51,536
and I will put him
on the naughty list.

391
00:15:55,195 --> 00:15:57,163
More carrots?

392
00:15:57,197 --> 00:15:58,716
I've got to say,

393
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,545
I've never thought to put beef
and chocolate together,

394
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,168
but that was delicious.

395
00:16:02,202 --> 00:16:03,514
You can't go wrong
with chocolate.

396
00:16:03,548 --> 00:16:04,722
No, apparently not.

397
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,689
What is it, Snowball?

398
00:16:06,724 --> 00:16:07,759
He wants you
to go outside

399
00:16:07,794 --> 00:16:09,071
and throw the ball
to him.

400
00:16:09,106 --> 00:16:09,796
It's his
favorite game.

401
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:15,802
Well, in that case, 
let's go chuck some ball.

402
00:16:15,836 --> 00:16:17,631
Whoa, whoa.

403
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:21,083
I need a jacket.

404
00:16:21,118 --> 00:16:23,120
Where's Snowball?

405
00:16:23,154 --> 00:16:24,397
I need my slippers.

406
00:16:24,431 --> 00:16:25,777
Connor took him outside
to throw the ball.

407
00:16:25,812 --> 00:16:27,469
Did you tell him

408
00:16:27,503 --> 00:16:29,091
not to throw it
to the back of the house

409
00:16:29,126 --> 00:16:30,403
where all the lights
are hooked up?

410
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,029
Connor!

411
00:16:40,482 --> 00:16:42,622
Connor?

412
00:16:44,313 --> 00:16:45,418
I brought you
some trifle.

413
00:16:45,452 --> 00:16:46,281
Thank you.

414
00:16:46,315 --> 00:16:48,076
What are you
doing?

415
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:51,320
I was seeing
if I had any messages from work,

416
00:16:51,355 --> 00:16:53,115
but I can't seem
to get a signal up here.

417
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,289
Well.

418
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:56,636
Hey, did your parents
get those lights

419
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,602
back up and running?

420
00:16:57,637 --> 00:16:58,810
Mario's
working on it.

421
00:16:58,845 --> 00:16:59,777
I'm sure they'll be
back up and running

422
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,365
by the morning.

423
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:02,435
I feel like
I should go help him.

424
00:17:02,469 --> 00:17:03,781
No, no, no, no.

425
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:06,370
Mario likes doing
that kind of thing.

426
00:17:06,404 --> 00:17:09,131
So I made a great
first impression?

427
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:12,652
Of course you did.

428
00:17:12,686 --> 00:17:14,240
You didn't know
that Snowball

429
00:17:14,274 --> 00:17:16,449
was going to go running
through those cords.

430
00:17:18,485 --> 00:17:19,452
No.

431
00:17:23,421 --> 00:17:24,457
Come on.

432
00:17:24,491 --> 00:17:25,699
I've got something

433
00:17:25,734 --> 00:17:28,219
that I think
will cheer you up.

434
00:17:30,773 --> 00:17:31,774
Where are you going?

435
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:32,810
Just follow me.

436
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,712
Are you sure this
is structurally sound?

437
00:17:46,582 --> 00:17:48,584
Look.

438
00:17:49,758 --> 00:17:51,829
Whoa...

439
00:17:53,934 --> 00:17:55,143
What is that?

440
00:17:55,177 --> 00:17:57,490
The Northern Lights.

441
00:17:57,524 --> 00:17:58,767
The North Pole

442
00:17:58,801 --> 00:18:01,425
is one of the best places
to see them.

443
00:18:01,459 --> 00:18:02,702
The North Pole?

444
00:18:02,736 --> 00:18:04,773
This is the North Pole?

445
00:18:06,844 --> 00:18:08,363
I told you that,
right?

446
00:18:08,397 --> 00:18:11,918
I... I could have sworn
I told you at lunch...

447
00:18:11,952 --> 00:18:13,609
No.

448
00:18:13,644 --> 00:18:14,886
No, no, no, you said
that your parents lived,

449
00:18:14,921 --> 00:18:16,681
like, way, way, way
up north.

450
00:18:16,716 --> 00:18:19,512
You didn't say
they lived this far.

451
00:18:19,546 --> 00:18:21,893
Well...
Here we are.

452
00:18:21,928 --> 00:18:23,688
I hope that's okay?

453
00:18:27,313 --> 00:18:29,177
It's okay.

454
00:18:30,971 --> 00:18:31,834
No, I love it.

455
00:18:31,869 --> 00:18:33,767
It's like

456
00:18:33,802 --> 00:18:35,700
there's something magical
about it all, don't you think?

457
00:18:35,735 --> 00:18:36,632
Yeah, yeah.

458
00:18:36,667 --> 00:18:38,738
It's magical.

459
00:18:38,772 --> 00:18:40,533
Yeah.

460
00:18:43,881 --> 00:18:45,469
I love you, Connor.

461
00:18:51,716 --> 00:18:53,270
What was that?

462
00:18:53,304 --> 00:18:55,962
What was what?

463
00:18:55,996 --> 00:18:57,550
It kind of sounded
like a kid.

464
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,691
-Connor, look! A shooting star!
-What? Where?

465
00:19:00,725 --> 00:19:02,313
Whoa!

466
00:19:02,348 --> 00:19:04,522
Look at that.
That's crazy!

467
00:19:05,661 --> 00:19:07,629
I've never seen anything
like that before.

468
00:19:07,663 --> 00:19:09,907
That was, like, pfff!

469
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:11,219
Well, it's like
you said,

470
00:19:11,253 --> 00:19:14,705
it's, 
pretty magical up here.

471
00:19:14,739 --> 00:19:16,258
Yeah.

472
00:19:17,777 --> 00:19:20,297
Maybe we should go
back inside.

473
00:19:20,331 --> 00:19:22,747
It's... brrr!

474
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:25,888
Okay.

475
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,895
Whoa... Whoa!

476
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:33,931
I'm okay!

477
00:19:40,006 --> 00:19:41,525
These lights, Snowball...

478
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:43,699
Yeah, it's not like
I had enough to do, no, no.

479
00:19:43,734 --> 00:19:44,942
I...

480
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:45,908
I needed to fix the lights,

481
00:19:45,943 --> 00:19:47,807
so I really appreciate it.

482
00:19:47,841 --> 00:19:48,946
Good dog.

483
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,879
Good dog.

484
00:19:52,018 --> 00:19:53,916
I tell you, every year

485
00:19:53,951 --> 00:19:57,782
it seems the kids wish
for more electronic gadgets.

486
00:19:57,817 --> 00:19:58,783
Some toys.

487
00:19:58,818 --> 00:20:00,544
Listen to this...

488
00:20:00,578 --> 00:20:02,925
Dear Santa, I think I've been
a very good boy,

489
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,999
so I'm wishing
for an RX-48 Gaming System,

490
00:20:08,034 --> 00:20:09,725
a cellphone,
and a tablet.

491
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,726
Love, David.

492
00:20:10,761 --> 00:20:12,038
Wow.

493
00:20:12,072 --> 00:20:13,764
Well, David's got
a tall order.

494
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:14,834
Is he on the nice list?

495
00:20:14,868 --> 00:20:16,284
Why, yes, he is.

496
00:20:16,318 --> 00:20:18,355
-Good morning.
-Hi.

497
00:20:18,389 --> 00:20:20,840
Well,
good morning, sleepyhead.

498
00:20:21,944 --> 00:20:23,877
Yeah. Yeah, so sorry.

499
00:20:23,912 --> 00:20:26,708
I... I slept late.

500
00:20:26,742 --> 00:20:27,950
It must be that
fresh arctic air.

501
00:20:27,985 --> 00:20:28,848
Pancakes?

502
00:20:28,882 --> 00:20:30,056
Yes, please.

503
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:30,884
Don't mind if I do.

504
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:33,922
Frost, my boy!

505
00:20:33,956 --> 00:20:35,372
Hello.

506
00:20:35,406 --> 00:20:36,821
Nick.

507
00:20:36,856 --> 00:20:37,753
Hey-hey-hey!

508
00:20:37,788 --> 00:20:38,892
Well, ho-ho-ho!

509
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,792
Nice
to see you, Jack.

510
00:20:41,826 --> 00:20:45,036
Jessica, you are looking
as rosy as ever.

511
00:20:45,071 --> 00:20:46,866
Very charming.

512
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,867
Here you go.

513
00:20:47,901 --> 00:20:48,799
Thank you.

514
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:49,869
Hello, Jack.

515
00:20:49,903 --> 00:20:50,801
"Hello, Jack"?

516
00:20:50,835 --> 00:20:52,043
That's it?

517
00:20:52,078 --> 00:20:53,459
I haven't seen you
in forever, it seems,

518
00:20:53,493 --> 00:20:54,494
and that's all I get?

519
00:20:56,116 --> 00:20:59,016
Jack, this is
my boyfriend, Connor.

520
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,397
Connor, Jack.

521
00:21:00,431 --> 00:21:02,330
Boyfriend.

522
00:21:02,364 --> 00:21:03,054
Hey. Connor.
Nice to meet you.

523
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:04,470
-Yeah.
-Wow, chilly hands.

524
00:21:04,504 --> 00:21:06,092
You should get some gloves.

525
00:21:06,126 --> 00:21:07,473
Well,
they don't call me Frost

526
00:21:07,507 --> 00:21:09,095
for nothing...

527
00:21:09,129 --> 00:21:09,958
Do you hear that?

528
00:21:09,992 --> 00:21:11,546
Which reminds me,

529
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,030
I brought you
a welcome home present.

530
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:16,585
One of
your ice sculptures!

531
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,553
Yeah,
it's a replica

532
00:21:18,587 --> 00:21:19,968
of the life-size one
I made for Holly

533
00:21:20,002 --> 00:21:21,038
on her 16th birthday.

534
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:22,764
Remember, Holly?

535
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:24,421
Beautiful.

536
00:21:24,455 --> 00:21:25,318
That was the day
you agreed to be my girl

537
00:21:25,353 --> 00:21:27,527
forever and ever.

538
00:21:27,562 --> 00:21:29,978
that was a long time ago.

539
00:21:30,012 --> 00:21:31,428
It wasn't that long.

540
00:21:31,462 --> 00:21:32,981
Why don't I just go
put this on ice?

541
00:21:33,015 --> 00:21:34,500
Yes.

542
00:21:34,534 --> 00:21:37,088
So is that your thing,
like, ice sculpting?

543
00:21:37,123 --> 00:21:39,056
Well, not just ice.

544
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,091
Snow too.

545
00:21:40,126 --> 00:21:41,334
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

546
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:42,922
-Wow.
-Think fast.

547
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,062
- Come...
- Jack!

548
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:48,376
Really?

549
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:49,515
Come on,
it's all in good fun,

550
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:50,619
right, Connor?

551
00:21:50,654 --> 00:21:52,656
Yeah, that came
out of nowhere.

552
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,451
Well, I can't
imagine Holly dating someone

553
00:21:54,485 --> 00:21:55,935
that hasn't got
a sense of humor.

554
00:21:55,969 --> 00:21:57,108
Yeah, you're right.

555
00:21:57,143 --> 00:21:58,455
Look at her father.

556
00:21:58,489 --> 00:22:00,526
It doesn't get
jollier than this guy.

557
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,837
I guess not.

558
00:22:01,872 --> 00:22:03,529
Jack...

559
00:22:03,563 --> 00:22:04,495
It's good to see you.

560
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,496
Let me help you out.

561
00:22:05,531 --> 00:22:06,704
Okay, see
you guys later.

562
00:22:06,739 --> 00:22:08,775
He slays me.

563
00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:13,366
Holly Claus,
I'm surprised at you...

564
00:22:13,401 --> 00:22:14,436
Dating someone

565
00:22:14,471 --> 00:22:16,024
who can't even
catch a snowball.

566
00:22:16,058 --> 00:22:17,370
We live down south.

567
00:22:17,405 --> 00:22:19,441
He hasn't had
a lot of practice.

568
00:22:19,476 --> 00:22:20,718
So, what,

569
00:22:20,753 --> 00:22:22,375
are you actually serious
about this guy?

570
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:24,412
Yes. Yes, I am.

571
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:27,587
I think he's going to propose.

572
00:22:29,071 --> 00:22:30,556
You're kidding, right?

573
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,591
You actually
think Conrad...

574
00:22:31,626 --> 00:22:32,972
Connor.

575
00:22:33,006 --> 00:22:35,733
...Connor will fit in
to your family?

576
00:22:35,768 --> 00:22:37,908
Because, you know, with me,
I never had that problem.

577
00:22:37,942 --> 00:22:39,599
I mean, in fact,

578
00:22:39,634 --> 00:22:41,498
it's what made us
a great match...

579
00:22:41,532 --> 00:22:44,086
It's what makes us
a great match.

580
00:22:46,123 --> 00:22:48,643
It's not going to happen, Jack.

581
00:22:49,989 --> 00:22:52,647
I'm with Connor now.

582
00:22:53,613 --> 00:22:54,476
Okay.

583
00:22:54,511 --> 00:22:56,444
We'll see.

584
00:22:56,478 --> 00:22:58,480
But I'll be by
again soon, Holly.

585
00:22:58,515 --> 00:23:00,827
It's good to see you.

586
00:23:03,934 --> 00:23:05,142
Everything okay?

587
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:06,212
Yeah, everything's fine.

588
00:23:06,246 --> 00:23:07,558
Yeah.

589
00:23:07,593 --> 00:23:09,560
So that was
the ex-boyfriend?

590
00:23:09,595 --> 00:23:11,217
Yes. That was
a long time ago.

591
00:23:11,251 --> 00:23:12,425
Yeah, well...

592
00:23:13,771 --> 00:23:15,670
So he lives here?
At the North Pole?

593
00:23:15,704 --> 00:23:17,223
Yeah, he's our neighbor.

594
00:23:17,257 --> 00:23:18,500
He's probably
the closest one...

595
00:23:18,535 --> 00:23:21,745
In... In... Not that
he's the closest,

596
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:23,505
but in proximity.

597
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,644
Yeah.

598
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:25,507
Come on,
let's get some pancakes

599
00:23:25,542 --> 00:23:26,474
before they get cold.

600
00:23:26,508 --> 00:23:28,441
Actually, you know what?

601
00:23:28,476 --> 00:23:31,755
There's a little something
that I need to work on.

602
00:23:31,789 --> 00:23:33,239
Okay.

603
00:23:33,273 --> 00:23:34,171
All right.

604
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:35,068
All right.

605
00:23:40,004 --> 00:23:41,523
Dear sir...

606
00:23:42,628 --> 00:23:43,629
No.

607
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,633
Dear Mr. Claus...

608
00:23:52,948 --> 00:23:53,915
Mom...

609
00:23:55,744 --> 00:23:56,883
Why did you have to
tell Jack I was home?

610
00:23:56,918 --> 00:23:57,884
Well, I didn't, honey.

611
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,230
The little birds told him.

612
00:23:59,265 --> 00:24:01,543
You know how
those doves do chatter.

613
00:24:03,165 --> 00:24:04,201
Well, just
so you know,

614
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:05,478
it's over
with me and Jack.

615
00:24:05,513 --> 00:24:07,653
It was the moment
that I left.

616
00:24:07,687 --> 00:24:09,206
Well, that
doesn't surprise me.

617
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,277
That boy would have melted
if he'd left the Pole.

618
00:24:11,311 --> 00:24:15,661
Well, I mean,
that's not why it ended.

619
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:18,629
It didn't work.

620
00:24:19,561 --> 00:24:21,494
You understand, right?

621
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:22,564
Yeah, of course I do.

622
00:24:23,876 --> 00:24:27,776
Honey, you have not yet
told Connor

623
00:24:27,811 --> 00:24:28,984
who you really are.

624
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:31,021
I will.

625
00:24:31,055 --> 00:24:32,643
And when I do,

626
00:24:32,678 --> 00:24:35,301
I think he is going
to fit in perfectly.

627
00:24:35,335 --> 00:24:36,889
Yeah.

628
00:24:36,923 --> 00:24:38,753
Right, Donner?

629
00:24:40,582 --> 00:24:42,895
See, Donner agrees.

630
00:24:42,929 --> 00:24:44,897
Well, there's a truth.

631
00:24:44,931 --> 00:24:46,208
That's settled.

632
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:56,598
Dear Mr. Claus.

633
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,878
Mr. Claus,
may I have a moment?

634
00:25:00,913 --> 00:25:02,570
Just a moment of your time?
A word?

635
00:25:02,604 --> 00:25:03,743
Your daughter, she's...

636
00:25:03,778 --> 00:25:05,020
She's a wonderful person.

637
00:25:05,055 --> 00:25:07,057
You know what,
she has made me so happy.

638
00:25:07,091 --> 00:25:08,610
What I'd like to do

639
00:25:08,645 --> 00:25:11,302
is ask
for her hand in marriage.

640
00:25:12,338 --> 00:25:13,201
Hey, hey, Connor!

641
00:25:13,235 --> 00:25:14,305
Hey, Snowball.

642
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,135
Nick. Mr. Claus. Hey.

643
00:25:16,169 --> 00:25:17,654
Do you have a minute?

644
00:25:17,688 --> 00:25:20,864
I will, after I get back
from my fitting.

645
00:25:20,898 --> 00:25:23,211
Seems I've lost a wee pound
or two this year.

646
00:25:23,245 --> 00:25:24,557
I'll be back.

647
00:25:24,592 --> 00:25:26,663
Milk and cookies
in the kitchen.

648
00:25:26,697 --> 00:25:29,320
Something special...
in the corner.

649
00:25:38,709 --> 00:25:40,677
Something special in the corner.

650
00:25:42,886 --> 00:25:44,612
Now, ladies,

651
00:25:44,646 --> 00:25:46,786
you have got to stop gossiping
to Jack

652
00:25:46,821 --> 00:25:48,029
about me and Connor.

653
00:25:48,063 --> 00:25:49,030
You got it?

654
00:25:49,064 --> 00:25:50,721
I know we're friends,

655
00:25:50,756 --> 00:25:53,724
but you can't betray my trust
here.

656
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:55,864
Jack doesn't get
to know everything anymore.

657
00:25:55,899 --> 00:25:57,659
There you go.

658
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:02,768
Those birds can't keep
their dang beaks shut.

659
00:26:02,802 --> 00:26:04,321
Yeah, I'm talking about you.

660
00:26:07,151 --> 00:26:09,222
So how are you holding up?

661
00:26:09,257 --> 00:26:11,708
You know...

662
00:26:11,742 --> 00:26:14,020
It's kind of strange
to be here,

663
00:26:14,055 --> 00:26:16,057
especially with Connor.

664
00:26:16,091 --> 00:26:18,853
Have you talked to him
about...

665
00:26:18,887 --> 00:26:20,751
No, not yet,
but I will.

666
00:26:20,786 --> 00:26:24,962
I'm just kind of
scared that he...

667
00:26:24,997 --> 00:26:26,964
It might freak him out,
and then...

668
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:32,798
Maybe just talk to him,
and then you'll know.

669
00:26:36,077 --> 00:26:37,078
You're right, Mario,

670
00:26:37,112 --> 00:26:39,218
I just need to talk to him.

671
00:26:39,252 --> 00:26:40,909
Going to tell him right now.

672
00:26:42,462 --> 00:26:44,672
Attagirl!

673
00:26:59,928 --> 00:27:02,344
Don't mind if I do.

674
00:27:09,386 --> 00:27:12,838
Perhaps I'll try
a thimble of the sherry.

675
00:27:17,187 --> 00:27:18,671
What?

676
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,815
Connor?

677
00:27:28,232 --> 00:27:30,718
Aah! Aah!

678
00:27:30,752 --> 00:27:32,685
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

679
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,894
Wha... Whoa!

680
00:27:43,765 --> 00:27:45,767
Intruder!

681
00:27:48,287 --> 00:27:50,496
What? Wha... Whoa!

682
00:27:52,187 --> 00:27:53,741
No!

683
00:27:58,815 --> 00:28:01,058
Huckleberries and mistletoe!

684
00:28:01,093 --> 00:28:01,921
Don't move.

685
00:28:06,201 --> 00:28:08,203
There's got to be some kind
of misunderstanding here, okay?

686
00:28:08,238 --> 00:28:09,929
What's going on
here?

687
00:28:09,964 --> 00:28:11,137
Intruder, sir.

688
00:28:11,172 --> 00:28:12,276
No, I'm not an intruder.

689
00:28:13,968 --> 00:28:15,176
Guys, he's not an intruder.

690
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,177
He's my boyfriend.

691
00:28:16,211 --> 00:28:17,212
Yeah.

692
00:28:17,247 --> 00:28:18,110
Come on,
you merry munchkins,

693
00:28:18,144 --> 00:28:19,836
untie him.

694
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:20,837
Yeah. Thank you.

695
00:28:20,871 --> 00:28:21,872
Thank you.

696
00:28:21,907 --> 00:28:22,873
Yeah...

697
00:28:22,908 --> 00:28:25,807
You guys are animals.

698
00:28:25,842 --> 00:28:26,843
Thank you.

699
00:28:28,051 --> 00:28:28,983
Yeah. All right.

700
00:28:32,227 --> 00:28:34,747
Are you okay?

701
00:28:35,852 --> 00:28:37,129
I... I mean, I'm fine.

702
00:28:37,163 --> 00:28:38,544
I'm fine.

703
00:28:38,578 --> 00:28:39,959
What is this place?

704
00:28:39,994 --> 00:28:43,031
It's a factory.

705
00:28:44,446 --> 00:28:46,138
So, like, when
you were talking about

706
00:28:46,172 --> 00:28:47,518
how your parents
are busy all the time,

707
00:28:47,553 --> 00:28:48,899
it's 'cause they run
a factory.

708
00:28:48,934 --> 00:28:50,176
Exactly.

709
00:28:50,211 --> 00:28:51,177
What do they make here?

710
00:28:51,212 --> 00:28:52,834
Toys.

711
00:28:52,869 --> 00:28:54,422
We make toys.

712
00:28:54,456 --> 00:28:56,079
Jumpin'
juniper berries!

713
00:28:56,113 --> 00:28:57,943
What's all the ruckus?

714
00:28:57,977 --> 00:29:00,221
At least let me get
the last of the pins out, sir.

715
00:29:01,843 --> 00:29:04,087
You have to tell him,
sweetheart,

716
00:29:04,121 --> 00:29:06,917
before his head
explodes.

717
00:29:13,027 --> 00:29:15,063
Connor...

718
00:29:15,098 --> 00:29:16,271
Um, there's something

719
00:29:16,306 --> 00:29:18,826
that I've been meaning
to tell you.

720
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,965
My parents,

721
00:29:19,999 --> 00:29:24,452
they have
a very special job.

722
00:29:33,219 --> 00:29:35,187
My gosh...

723
00:29:35,221 --> 00:29:37,120
Here? North Pole.

724
00:29:37,154 --> 00:29:39,122
The toys...

725
00:29:40,364 --> 00:29:41,952
Your guys' name?

726
00:29:41,987 --> 00:29:43,471
Yeah.

727
00:29:43,505 --> 00:29:45,853
Um, I'm Holly Claus,

728
00:29:45,887 --> 00:29:49,442
and I am Santa Claus'
daughter.

729
00:29:49,477 --> 00:29:53,205
Daughter.

730
00:29:53,239 --> 00:29:54,171
Father.

731
00:29:55,172 --> 00:29:56,070
Mother.

732
00:29:56,967 --> 00:29:59,349
Hah! Boy.

733
00:29:59,383 --> 00:30:01,558
I'm... I'm so sorry,
Connor.

734
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:02,870
I meant to tell you
before we left,

735
00:30:02,904 --> 00:30:04,043
and I got nervous,

736
00:30:04,078 --> 00:30:06,149
and then I was on my way
to tell you now,

737
00:30:06,183 --> 00:30:08,047
and it's, um...

738
00:30:08,082 --> 00:30:10,463
Well, now it's too late, so...

739
00:30:12,086 --> 00:30:14,053
Connor, are you okay?

740
00:30:14,088 --> 00:30:15,054
I...

741
00:30:15,089 --> 00:30:16,021
I need that sherry.

742
00:30:41,115 --> 00:30:44,118
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

743
00:30:45,429 --> 00:30:48,087
These reindeer...

744
00:30:48,122 --> 00:30:50,193
are "the" reindeer.

745
00:30:53,955 --> 00:30:54,922
Yeah.

746
00:30:57,303 --> 00:30:59,202
Donner in there.

747
00:30:59,236 --> 00:31:00,686
Vixen.

748
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,896
Blitzen, Prancer, Dasher.

749
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:06,278
Dancer, Comet, and Cupid
are out to pasture.

750
00:31:06,312 --> 00:31:07,520
Rudolph,

751
00:31:07,555 --> 00:31:09,281
he takes off right
after Christmas,

752
00:31:09,315 --> 00:31:11,248
and he doesn't come back again
till the next year,

753
00:31:11,283 --> 00:31:12,422
like, the night of.

754
00:31:12,456 --> 00:31:15,183
It makes my mom
so crazy with worry.

755
00:31:17,392 --> 00:31:19,498
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

756
00:31:19,532 --> 00:31:21,327
If you and I get married,

757
00:31:21,362 --> 00:31:22,604
my in-laws

758
00:31:22,639 --> 00:31:26,436
will be "the"
Mr. and Mrs. Santa Claus?

759
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,196
Yes.

760
00:31:28,231 --> 00:31:31,475
But you can call them
Nick and Jessica, of course.

761
00:31:34,409 --> 00:31:36,377
Connor, if you're not
okay with this,

762
00:31:36,411 --> 00:31:38,206
I totally understand.

763
00:31:38,241 --> 00:31:40,174
Okay?

764
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:43,660
I'm better than okay.

765
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:46,180
I'm so good!

766
00:31:48,078 --> 00:31:50,425
I mean, you...
you and your family

767
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,357
are incredible.

768
00:31:51,392 --> 00:31:52,496
I mean...

769
00:31:52,531 --> 00:31:53,635
We're just, you know,

770
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:54,602
we've got issues
like every family.

771
00:31:54,636 --> 00:31:56,224
No, this is exciting.

772
00:31:56,259 --> 00:31:57,570
Okay, what are the
chances? Seriously.

773
00:31:57,605 --> 00:31:59,503
Me, my absolute favorite
time of the year

774
00:31:59,538 --> 00:32:00,504
is Christmas.

775
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:02,058
Now this.

776
00:32:02,092 --> 00:32:04,198
Fate? No, destiny.

777
00:32:04,232 --> 00:32:07,408
Speaking of destiny,
I actually...

778
00:32:07,442 --> 00:32:10,618
I'm going to marry you,
Holly Klaus. Claus.

779
00:32:10,652 --> 00:32:11,619
Santa Claus' daughter!

780
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,277
Santa Claus' daughter!

781
00:32:14,311 --> 00:32:16,106
I'm going to marry
Santa Claus' daughter!

782
00:32:16,141 --> 00:32:18,143
I'm going to ask Santa
to marry his daughter.

783
00:32:18,177 --> 00:32:19,489
I...

784
00:32:19,523 --> 00:32:20,386
I've got to ask Santa
to marry his daughter!

785
00:32:20,421 --> 00:32:21,491
What?!

786
00:32:21,525 --> 00:32:22,595
That's insane!

787
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:23,700
That's like
asking the president

788
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:24,701
or, like, the Easter Bunny.

789
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:25,564
Is the Easter Bunny here?

790
00:32:25,598 --> 00:32:27,428
No. No.

791
00:32:27,462 --> 00:32:28,498
Okay, good.

792
00:32:28,532 --> 00:32:30,672
I need to focus.

793
00:32:30,707 --> 00:32:32,157
What am I going to say?

794
00:32:32,191 --> 00:32:33,503
What do you mean,
what are you going to say?

795
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:36,023
Well, I mean, I've got
to convince Santa

796
00:32:36,057 --> 00:32:37,610
that I'm worthy
to marry his daughter,

797
00:32:37,645 --> 00:32:39,233
or else why would Santa
let me marry his daughter?

798
00:32:39,267 --> 00:32:40,475
Why wouldn't he?

799
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:43,444
He will because I love you.

800
00:32:47,206 --> 00:32:48,345
I love you.

801
00:32:51,521 --> 00:32:53,730
Okay. Okay.

802
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:54,731
Let's do this.

803
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:55,732
Hand?

804
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:56,733
Let's go.

805
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:09,780
Nick?

806
00:33:09,815 --> 00:33:12,783
- Hello.
- Sorry.

807
00:33:12,818 --> 00:33:16,270
Yeah. Santa Claus.

808
00:33:16,304 --> 00:33:17,754
Mr. Claus.

809
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:18,755
Yes.

810
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:20,274
May I have a word?

811
00:33:20,308 --> 00:33:21,344
Of course.

812
00:33:21,378 --> 00:33:22,690
Come, come, come.

813
00:33:22,724 --> 00:33:24,657
Yeah. Thank you.

814
00:33:24,692 --> 00:33:25,589
My gosh.

815
00:33:25,624 --> 00:33:26,694
Is that the book?

816
00:33:26,728 --> 00:33:28,454
It sure is.

817
00:33:28,489 --> 00:33:29,731
Have a look.

818
00:33:29,766 --> 00:33:33,666
Don't worry, you're
on the "nice" list.

819
00:33:35,737 --> 00:33:38,637
Wow.

820
00:33:38,671 --> 00:33:40,328
What's going on?

821
00:33:40,363 --> 00:33:43,124
Shh.
He's going to ask Dad.

822
00:33:44,505 --> 00:33:45,437
Donny Bartlet?

823
00:33:45,471 --> 00:33:46,783
Wow.

824
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:48,164
He comes to our focus groups
all the time.

825
00:33:48,198 --> 00:33:50,338
He's got a bit
of a mouth on him.

826
00:33:50,373 --> 00:33:52,099
You sure he should be
on the nice list?

827
00:33:52,133 --> 00:33:54,687
You learn, in my business,

828
00:33:54,722 --> 00:33:56,517
everyone gets another chance.

829
00:34:01,384 --> 00:34:03,351
I wonder if Stuart Cuthbert
is on there.

830
00:34:03,386 --> 00:34:04,697
Yeah...

831
00:34:08,115 --> 00:34:09,599
Well, it's taking forever.

832
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:10,772
Look, Connor.

833
00:34:10,807 --> 00:34:12,809
You wanted to speak
with me?

834
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:14,776
Yes. Yes, of course.

835
00:34:14,811 --> 00:34:15,743
Okay. Here it is.

836
00:34:15,777 --> 00:34:16,778
Okay.

837
00:34:17,917 --> 00:34:20,368
Yeah, I...

838
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:28,273
Mr. Claus...

839
00:34:29,757 --> 00:34:31,448
I want you to know

840
00:34:31,483 --> 00:34:33,450
that I love your daughter
very much.

841
00:34:34,589 --> 00:34:36,695
She inspires me.

842
00:34:36,729 --> 00:34:39,629
You know, she motivates me.

843
00:34:39,663 --> 00:34:41,562
I just can't imagine my world
without her.

844
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:49,432
So I wanted to know...

845
00:34:49,466 --> 00:34:51,365
would you allow me
to marry your daughter?

846
00:35:01,513 --> 00:35:02,652
Connor...

847
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:07,139
Welcome to the family.

848
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,729
My boy...

849
00:35:12,179 --> 00:35:14,802
Holly, Holly, Holly...

850
00:35:14,836 --> 00:35:17,736
Yes, yes, yes.

851
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:19,531
Mother...

852
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,675
Holly Claus...

853
00:35:25,709 --> 00:35:27,573
Will you marry me?

854
00:35:27,608 --> 00:35:28,333
Yes!

855
00:35:28,367 --> 00:35:30,162
Yes, yes, yes!

856
00:35:37,273 --> 00:35:39,896
You two!

857
00:35:59,778 --> 00:36:01,573
So it's official.

858
00:36:01,607 --> 00:36:04,783
It is.

859
00:36:04,817 --> 00:36:06,681
And you've told him, right?

860
00:36:06,716 --> 00:36:08,442
I will.

861
00:36:08,476 --> 00:36:10,444
Honey...

862
00:36:10,478 --> 00:36:13,274
Look, you cannot forget
the task at hand.

863
00:36:13,309 --> 00:36:16,346
It has been our job
as the women in this family

864
00:36:16,381 --> 00:36:17,796
to prepare the men
for their job

865
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:19,246
as the next Santa.

866
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,662
I know.

867
00:36:21,696 --> 00:36:22,594
I do.

868
00:36:22,628 --> 00:36:24,872
I will.

869
00:36:24,906 --> 00:36:26,460
But I would just like
to give him

870
00:36:26,494 --> 00:36:28,220
a couple of extra days

871
00:36:28,255 --> 00:36:29,532
to get used to the idea
of all of this first.

872
00:36:30,878 --> 00:36:32,535
Fine.

873
00:36:32,569 --> 00:36:33,846
But it doesn't mean
we can't start working,

874
00:36:33,881 --> 00:36:35,883
though.

875
00:36:35,917 --> 00:36:36,953
Time is ticking.

876
00:36:36,987 --> 00:36:37,850
Absolutely.

877
00:36:37,885 --> 00:36:39,404
Tick-tock.

878
00:36:40,957 --> 00:36:42,821
So, what are we doing?

879
00:36:42,855 --> 00:36:44,892
I think we should see
if he could hold his cookies.

880
00:36:44,926 --> 00:36:47,377
I mean, after all,
on Christmas Eve,

881
00:36:47,412 --> 00:36:49,379
he's going to be eating
about five billion of them.

882
00:36:49,414 --> 00:36:52,037
And a Santa on Christmas Eve
with an upset tummy...

883
00:36:52,071 --> 00:36:53,901
ooh, is a cranky Santa.

884
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:58,250
So over here
is our test area.

885
00:36:58,285 --> 00:37:01,322
It's kind of our, 
quality control.

886
00:37:01,357 --> 00:37:03,566
And here's
our newest creations.

887
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,294
Every year we like to create
about a dozen new toys.

888
00:37:07,328 --> 00:37:09,261
I mean,
you know how it is...

889
00:37:09,296 --> 00:37:11,953
Kids,
they get tired of their toys,

890
00:37:11,988 --> 00:37:14,991
so we like
to change it up.

891
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,479
What is this?

892
00:37:20,514 --> 00:37:25,415
Actually,
that's not a toy.

893
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,968
It's a contraption
I'm working on

894
00:37:27,003 --> 00:37:29,074
that warps time and space

895
00:37:29,108 --> 00:37:30,040
so when the elves
have to go back

896
00:37:30,075 --> 00:37:31,490
and do damage control,

897
00:37:31,525 --> 00:37:35,563
they can leave the North Pole
at warp speed.

898
00:37:35,598 --> 00:37:37,531
So how does it work?

899
00:37:37,565 --> 00:37:40,844
Well, you just
write your address here,

900
00:37:40,879 --> 00:37:42,536
and then... but...

901
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,952
Actually, it really
hasn't been tested...

902
00:37:44,986 --> 00:37:46,436
No, don't break it!

903
00:37:51,545 --> 00:37:52,960
-Connor?
-Yeah?

904
00:37:52,994 --> 00:37:54,548
Mom and I
were wondering

905
00:37:54,582 --> 00:37:55,514
if you could assist us
in the kitchen

906
00:37:55,549 --> 00:37:56,998
with something.

907
00:37:57,033 --> 00:37:58,586
That's a great
idea.

908
00:37:58,621 --> 00:38:00,485
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

909
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:01,865
Yeah.

910
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,866
Mario, hey.

911
00:38:02,901 --> 00:38:04,316
Thanks for the tour, bud.

912
00:38:04,351 --> 00:38:09,425
And, sorry
about the... the thing.

913
00:38:09,459 --> 00:38:11,944
No biggie.

914
00:38:11,979 --> 00:38:12,911
I'll fix it.

915
00:38:12,945 --> 00:38:13,843
Nice.

916
00:38:13,877 --> 00:38:16,086
Yeah.

917
00:38:20,401 --> 00:38:23,024
Okay, Connor.
Here you go.

918
00:38:25,648 --> 00:38:27,097
Those look delicious.

919
00:38:27,132 --> 00:38:28,513
Well, we hope so,

920
00:38:28,547 --> 00:38:30,031
'cause, you see,

921
00:38:30,066 --> 00:38:32,482
Mom is trying out
a bunch of new recipes,

922
00:38:32,517 --> 00:38:35,071
and she needs your help
testing them for her,

923
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:35,934
right, Mom?

924
00:38:35,968 --> 00:38:37,832
That's right.

925
00:38:37,867 --> 00:38:40,801
Well, now, there's a job
I'll have no problem with.

926
00:38:42,009 --> 00:38:44,494
All right,
let's get started.

927
00:38:48,671 --> 00:38:50,431
Wow.

928
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:04,480
How are you doing,
sweetie?

929
00:39:04,514 --> 00:39:06,999
Yeah, yeah....
Um, I think I'm full.

930
00:39:10,417 --> 00:39:12,453
Hello?

931
00:39:12,488 --> 00:39:14,179
A little white dove told me

932
00:39:14,213 --> 00:39:16,630
Mamma was baking
some of her famous cookies.

933
00:39:16,664 --> 00:39:18,148
Darn doves.

934
00:39:18,183 --> 00:39:19,943
You always had
a real hankering

935
00:39:19,978 --> 00:39:21,704
for my cooking.

936
00:39:21,738 --> 00:39:23,153
Pff, yeah, only because
they're the best cookies

937
00:39:23,188 --> 00:39:24,672
this side of the Pole.

938
00:39:24,707 --> 00:39:25,673
Okay.

939
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:27,088
Hey, Connor.

940
00:39:27,123 --> 00:39:27,951
You're looking
a little green, man.

941
00:39:27,986 --> 00:39:28,883
Everything okay?

942
00:39:28,918 --> 00:39:29,746
Yeah.

943
00:39:29,781 --> 00:39:31,092
Yeah, I'm fine.

944
00:39:31,127 --> 00:39:32,577
Yeah, I was just
taste-testing

945
00:39:32,611 --> 00:39:34,406
some of Jessica's
cookies, yeah.

946
00:39:34,441 --> 00:39:35,718
Unfortunately

947
00:39:35,752 --> 00:39:37,202
I don't think we'll be
getting through these.

948
00:39:37,236 --> 00:39:38,583
No, no,
he'll be fine.

949
00:39:38,617 --> 00:39:40,412
He just needs
a little bit of a break.

950
00:39:40,447 --> 00:39:41,586
Right, Connor?

951
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,105
Do you have any antacids?

952
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,141
I have a little heartburn.

953
00:39:46,107 --> 00:39:47,419
Is this all that's left?

954
00:39:47,454 --> 00:39:49,559
Because... No problem.

955
00:39:49,594 --> 00:39:51,768
I am Jack Frost,
after all.

956
00:39:51,803 --> 00:39:52,942
I'll test them for you.

957
00:39:54,081 --> 00:39:55,047
Jack Frost?

958
00:40:19,969 --> 00:40:20,901
What?!

959
00:40:24,629 --> 00:40:26,907
That was tasty.

960
00:40:26,941 --> 00:40:28,253
Okay, Jack.

961
00:40:28,287 --> 00:40:30,566
These are for you.

962
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,050
Try not to eat them
all at once.

963
00:40:32,084 --> 00:40:34,017
I'll do my best,

964
00:40:34,052 --> 00:40:36,157
but no guarantees.

965
00:40:36,192 --> 00:40:37,814
Thanks, Jess.

966
00:40:37,849 --> 00:40:39,747
Hey, Holly, can I talk to you
for a minute?

967
00:40:39,782 --> 00:40:40,645
Yeah.

968
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:42,474
Thanks.

969
00:40:48,204 --> 00:40:49,757
So, what was that
in there?

970
00:40:49,792 --> 00:40:51,587
What was what?

971
00:40:51,621 --> 00:40:53,278
I see the ring on your finger.

972
00:40:53,312 --> 00:40:54,969
You were testing him.

973
00:40:56,799 --> 00:40:58,663
You don't know
what you're talking about, Jack.

974
00:40:58,697 --> 00:41:00,630
Does he even know
what he's in for?

975
00:41:03,081 --> 00:41:05,290
Wow.

976
00:41:05,324 --> 00:41:07,810
Well, all I have to say
is good luck.

977
00:41:07,844 --> 00:41:09,018
I mean, by the way
he failed miserably

978
00:41:09,052 --> 00:41:10,916
with those cookies,

979
00:41:10,951 --> 00:41:13,781
looks like you've got
your work cut out for you.

980
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:16,612
Always nice
to see you, Jack.

981
00:41:17,613 --> 00:41:18,752
Just remember, Holly...

982
00:41:18,786 --> 00:41:20,685
Christmas is the
most special day

983
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:21,824
of the year.

984
00:41:21,858 --> 00:41:23,619
You don't want to ruin it

985
00:41:23,653 --> 00:41:26,725
by giving the job
to someone who can't handle it.

986
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,761
Right?

987
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,765
I'm just saying.

988
00:41:48,609 --> 00:41:50,266
I brought you
some antacids.

989
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,302
Thank you.

990
00:41:55,961 --> 00:41:56,893
Jack still here?

991
00:41:56,928 --> 00:41:58,757
No. He left.

992
00:41:58,792 --> 00:41:59,931
Nice.

993
00:41:59,965 --> 00:42:01,311
He's got quite the appetite.

994
00:42:01,346 --> 00:42:02,278
I've never seen
anything like that.

995
00:42:02,312 --> 00:42:04,245
He was just showing off.

996
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,696
Yeah?

997
00:42:06,731 --> 00:42:08,042
For you or your mom?

998
00:42:08,077 --> 00:42:11,805
Connor, you don't have
to be jealous of him.

999
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,876
I know. I know.

1000
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:15,636
It just...

1001
00:42:15,671 --> 00:42:18,190
kind of seems like he fits in,
and...

1002
00:42:18,225 --> 00:42:19,709
I...

1003
00:42:23,092 --> 00:42:24,887
You have nothing
to worry about, okay?

1004
00:42:24,921 --> 00:42:27,372
You're going
to fit in.

1005
00:42:27,406 --> 00:42:29,719
I'll make sure of it.

1006
00:42:32,757 --> 00:42:33,758
Okay.

1007
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:37,382
Could you please tell your mom

1008
00:42:37,416 --> 00:42:38,797
that I might skip dinner
tonight?

1009
00:42:38,832 --> 00:42:40,592
Sure.

1010
00:42:44,941 --> 00:42:46,736
Thanks again.

1011
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,721
Only two
marshmallows.

1012
00:43:05,755 --> 00:43:08,240
I need the rest
for the smores.

1013
00:43:08,275 --> 00:43:09,794
Okay.

1014
00:43:09,828 --> 00:43:12,141
So where's
this Connor fellow?

1015
00:43:12,175 --> 00:43:14,005
I think he's down
in the factory.

1016
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:15,316
He seems very interested
in what the elves are doing.

1017
00:43:16,801 --> 00:43:18,630
Sounds like he might
be better served

1018
00:43:18,665 --> 00:43:19,424
making toys

1019
00:43:19,458 --> 00:43:21,426
than being Santa.

1020
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,427
What?

1021
00:43:22,461 --> 00:43:24,671
Come on,
Jessica.

1022
00:43:24,705 --> 00:43:25,948
Don't tell me you don't
have your doubts.

1023
00:43:25,982 --> 00:43:29,089
I mean, he's from the south,
for goodness sakes.

1024
00:43:29,123 --> 00:43:31,678
It never gets colder
than 30 degrees down there.

1025
00:43:31,712 --> 00:43:33,818
Now, Jack, we have to
give the boy a chance.

1026
00:43:33,852 --> 00:43:34,991
And I think Holly

1027
00:43:35,026 --> 00:43:35,958
is going to do
a really good job

1028
00:43:35,992 --> 00:43:37,856
at training him.

1029
00:43:37,891 --> 00:43:40,997
Yeah, but what if he fails?

1030
00:43:42,205 --> 00:43:44,207
So I guess
congratulations are in order.

1031
00:43:44,242 --> 00:43:46,865
Yes, thank you.

1032
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:49,281
Must be lots to do
before the big day?

1033
00:43:49,316 --> 00:43:51,974
Geez...

1034
00:43:52,008 --> 00:43:53,803
Speaking of which...

1035
00:43:53,838 --> 00:43:55,805
Connor, you ever
slide down a chimney before?

1036
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:58,670
Excuse me?

1037
00:43:58,705 --> 00:44:00,948
Hol and I used to do it
when we were kids,

1038
00:44:00,983 --> 00:44:02,294
all the time.

1039
00:44:02,329 --> 00:44:03,675
We had so much fun,

1040
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:06,678
remember, Hol?

1041
00:44:06,713 --> 00:44:08,024
Yeah, I've slid down
a few banisters in my day.

1042
00:44:09,405 --> 00:44:10,958
Well, then,

1043
00:44:10,993 --> 00:44:11,787
you shouldn't have
any problem at all

1044
00:44:11,821 --> 00:44:12,753
with a chimney.

1045
00:44:13,892 --> 00:44:16,239
What do you say
we give it a go?

1046
00:44:25,766 --> 00:44:27,699
Is it always
this windy?

1047
00:44:27,734 --> 00:44:29,943
Yeah. It's
the North Pole.

1048
00:44:36,328 --> 00:44:39,021
Ho, how are you, my girl?

1049
00:44:39,055 --> 00:44:43,128
I thought I'd have myself
a quick read.

1050
00:44:47,512 --> 00:44:48,962
What?

1051
00:44:50,135 --> 00:44:51,447
Nothing.

1052
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:54,484
Don't tell me "nothing".

1053
00:44:54,519 --> 00:44:55,865
I know you.

1054
00:44:57,108 --> 00:44:58,281
Tell me.

1055
00:44:58,316 --> 00:44:59,179
What, what?

1056
00:44:59,213 --> 00:45:01,940
It's all good.

1057
00:45:01,975 --> 00:45:03,321
You'll see.

1058
00:45:03,355 --> 00:45:05,150
Good news, though...

1059
00:45:05,185 --> 00:45:08,395
it's really hot
in the chimney.

1060
00:45:08,429 --> 00:45:10,742
Think you can
handle the heat?

1061
00:45:10,777 --> 00:45:13,503
Yeah. I can
handle the heat.

1062
00:45:13,538 --> 00:45:15,229
We'll see about that.

1063
00:45:16,886 --> 00:45:18,923
Here goes nothin'.

1064
00:45:20,476 --> 00:45:22,512
Ooh!

1065
00:45:23,272 --> 00:45:25,032
Jack!

1066
00:45:25,067 --> 00:45:26,758
Just doing a little
chimney sliding, Nick.

1067
00:45:26,793 --> 00:45:27,759
Jack...

1068
00:45:27,794 --> 00:45:28,933
Such fun.

1069
00:45:28,967 --> 00:45:29,865
All right, buddy,

1070
00:45:29,899 --> 00:45:31,107
you're up!

1071
00:45:31,142 --> 00:45:33,040
Yeah, yeah,
I'll be right down.

1072
00:45:34,248 --> 00:45:35,871
Wow.

1073
00:45:37,907 --> 00:45:40,254
Connor, you don't
have to do this!

1074
00:45:40,289 --> 00:45:42,878
Don't worry,
I got this, babe!

1075
00:45:44,258 --> 00:45:46,295
What are you kids
up to?

1076
00:46:19,293 --> 00:46:21,330
Yeah. Yeah...

1077
00:46:24,367 --> 00:46:25,265
Whoa! Aah!

1078
00:46:25,299 --> 00:46:26,335
Connor?

1079
00:46:26,369 --> 00:46:27,508
Hello!

1080
00:46:27,543 --> 00:46:28,509
Are you
all right?

1081
00:46:28,544 --> 00:46:29,579
Yeah, yeah.

1082
00:46:29,614 --> 00:46:32,030
Just a little stuck, I think.

1083
00:46:32,065 --> 00:46:33,998
Well,
pull your shoulders together

1084
00:46:34,032 --> 00:46:35,206
and suck it in.

1085
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:38,968
Yeah, still not working.

1086
00:46:39,003 --> 00:46:42,040
I got you, buddy...

1087
00:46:42,075 --> 00:46:43,076
use the ol' poker trick.

1088
00:46:44,077 --> 00:46:45,872
-Jack, Jack!
-What?

1089
00:46:45,906 --> 00:46:46,907
Not helping.

1090
00:46:46,942 --> 00:46:48,357
Relax, everyone.

1091
00:46:48,391 --> 00:46:50,290
I'll...
I'll melt the butter.

1092
00:46:53,293 --> 00:46:54,881
My.

1093
00:46:57,573 --> 00:46:58,919
Are you sure
you're okay?

1094
00:46:58,954 --> 00:46:59,989
Yeah, yeah.

1095
00:47:00,024 --> 00:47:01,439
Yeah, I'm fine.

1096
00:47:01,473 --> 00:47:02,923
I just, you know,
came down on a wrong angle...

1097
00:47:02,958 --> 00:47:04,338
or something.

1098
00:47:04,373 --> 00:47:06,133
Okay.

1099
00:47:07,652 --> 00:47:11,483
It was a solid
effort, Connor.

1100
00:47:11,518 --> 00:47:13,451
You're a good sport.

1101
00:47:24,151 --> 00:47:25,497
Yeah.

1102
00:47:42,066 --> 00:47:43,274
How's it going?

1103
00:47:43,308 --> 00:47:44,275
Hey.

1104
00:47:45,414 --> 00:47:48,624
It's okay.

1105
00:47:48,658 --> 00:47:52,145
Um, listen,
about today...

1106
00:47:52,179 --> 00:47:53,146
Yeah.

1107
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:53,974
Yeah, that went well.

1108
00:47:54,009 --> 00:47:55,665
Yeah...

1109
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,391
Listen, that
was my own stupidity,

1110
00:47:57,426 --> 00:48:00,222
like, thinking I could
actually slide down a chimney.

1111
00:48:00,256 --> 00:48:02,293
It's not like I'm your dad
or anything.

1112
00:48:02,327 --> 00:48:03,984
What I should
be able to do

1113
00:48:04,019 --> 00:48:05,399
is make a toy

1114
00:48:05,434 --> 00:48:08,057
that kids actually
want to play with.

1115
00:48:08,092 --> 00:48:09,921
But for whatever reason,

1116
00:48:09,956 --> 00:48:10,922
I don't know what to do

1117
00:48:10,957 --> 00:48:12,268
to make it better
or more fun

1118
00:48:12,303 --> 00:48:14,098
or whatever it is
I've got to do to this thing

1119
00:48:14,132 --> 00:48:16,410
to make it
more interesting to kids.

1120
00:48:17,653 --> 00:48:18,930
I guess
I could make an app

1121
00:48:18,965 --> 00:48:21,277
or add some lights
or something,

1122
00:48:21,312 --> 00:48:23,452
but that's kind of
like, plffft!

1123
00:48:25,764 --> 00:48:31,184
You know, once my dad
gave me a doll,

1124
00:48:31,218 --> 00:48:35,602
and it was kind of
an ugly doll,

1125
00:48:35,636 --> 00:48:37,086
to be honest.

1126
00:48:37,121 --> 00:48:39,088
It was one of
the elves' prototypes,

1127
00:48:39,123 --> 00:48:41,125
and it didn't
quite work out.

1128
00:48:41,159 --> 00:48:43,092
And I didn't want
to play with it,

1129
00:48:43,127 --> 00:48:45,198
and so it just sat
on my bedroom shelf

1130
00:48:45,232 --> 00:48:47,476
for months and months.

1131
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:50,099
And then one day
I spilled hot cocoa

1132
00:48:50,134 --> 00:48:54,207
and I got the
doll's dress dirty,

1133
00:48:54,241 --> 00:48:58,280
and so I picked her up
and I started cleaning her.

1134
00:48:58,314 --> 00:49:04,010
And the moment that doll
was in my hands,

1135
00:49:04,044 --> 00:49:05,632
it was like magic.

1136
00:49:05,666 --> 00:49:09,532
I cleaned her,
I dressed her,

1137
00:49:09,567 --> 00:49:10,533
and for the first time,

1138
00:49:10,568 --> 00:49:12,708
I played with her,

1139
00:49:12,742 --> 00:49:14,020
and from that moment on,

1140
00:49:14,054 --> 00:49:16,712
she was my
most favorite doll.

1141
00:49:16,746 --> 00:49:20,026
So, you see,

1142
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:23,236
sometimes you just
have to get the toy

1143
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:25,134
into the child's hands

1144
00:49:25,169 --> 00:49:27,965
for them to realize
how wonderful it is.

1145
00:49:35,075 --> 00:49:36,594
You'll get it.

1146
00:49:38,596 --> 00:49:40,253
Thanks.

1147
00:49:50,815 --> 00:49:54,577
My, Mr. Claus
smells something yummy

1148
00:49:54,612 --> 00:49:58,305
from Mrs. Claus' kitchen.

1149
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:00,652
Ho-ho, good morning, dumpling.

1150
00:50:00,687 --> 00:50:02,102
Where are the children?

1151
00:50:02,137 --> 00:50:04,070
Holly is out
feeding the animals,

1152
00:50:04,104 --> 00:50:05,795
and I have Connor
chopping firewood.

1153
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:07,659
Ooh.

1154
00:50:09,178 --> 00:50:10,662
Nicholas,

1155
00:50:10,697 --> 00:50:13,562
do you have any,
you know, concerns

1156
00:50:13,596 --> 00:50:16,151
about Connor's
abilities?

1157
00:50:16,185 --> 00:50:18,153
I mean, when I first met you,

1158
00:50:18,187 --> 00:50:19,568
you at least could polish off
a couple dozen of my cookies.

1159
00:50:19,602 --> 00:50:22,847
Well, I always had
a good appetite.

1160
00:50:22,881 --> 00:50:26,644
But we still had our doubts
about me.

1161
00:50:27,645 --> 00:50:29,371
Like when you forgot
to harness the reindeer

1162
00:50:29,405 --> 00:50:30,751
and they took off
without you.

1163
00:50:34,341 --> 00:50:37,655
You sure whipped me
into shape.

1164
00:50:37,689 --> 00:50:40,209
And Holly will do
the same for him.

1165
00:50:40,244 --> 00:50:42,867
Besides, the boy has
plenty of Christmas spirit.

1166
00:50:42,901 --> 00:50:44,041
That will get him through.

1167
00:50:45,249 --> 00:50:46,698
I don't know.

1168
00:50:46,733 --> 00:50:47,872
Look.

1169
00:50:47,906 --> 00:50:49,736
I tell you what.

1170
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:52,187
I'll think of a task
I'm sure he can do.

1171
00:50:53,774 --> 00:50:54,775
Okay.

1172
00:50:56,294 --> 00:50:57,295
Don't touch that...

1173
00:50:58,641 --> 00:50:59,884
Boy.

1174
00:50:59,918 --> 00:51:03,301
Connor, my boy.

1175
00:51:03,336 --> 00:51:04,406
Just stacking some wood.

1176
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,614
Don't worry
about that.

1177
00:51:05,648 --> 00:51:07,236
I've got another job
for you.

1178
00:51:07,271 --> 00:51:09,376
Job? What kind of job?

1179
00:51:09,411 --> 00:51:12,138
Well, the elves are having
their siesta,

1180
00:51:12,172 --> 00:51:13,829
but I need some toys.

1181
00:51:13,863 --> 00:51:14,795
I was going to get Connor
to go down to the factory

1182
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:15,900
and fill this up

1183
00:51:15,934 --> 00:51:17,281
while I get
some work done

1184
00:51:17,315 --> 00:51:18,765
in the office.

1185
00:51:18,799 --> 00:51:20,111
I could do that.

1186
00:51:20,146 --> 00:51:21,906
Um, actually,

1187
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:25,737
I need your help
in the office,

1188
00:51:25,772 --> 00:51:27,325
you know what I mean?

1189
00:51:29,845 --> 00:51:31,329
Just get
what's on the list,

1190
00:51:31,364 --> 00:51:35,126
and make sure
to be very, very quiet

1191
00:51:35,161 --> 00:51:37,128
so you don't wake up
the elves...

1192
00:51:37,163 --> 00:51:39,234
Or else they'll get
real cranky.

1193
00:51:39,268 --> 00:51:40,718
Got it.

1194
00:51:40,752 --> 00:51:42,168
Don't wake up the elves.

1195
00:51:42,202 --> 00:51:43,928
Good man.

1196
00:51:43,962 --> 00:51:45,585
There we go.

1197
00:51:59,978 --> 00:52:02,153
Yeah!

1198
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:22,656
I think he's got this
in the bag!

1199
00:52:25,349 --> 00:52:26,177
Hey!

1200
00:52:26,212 --> 00:52:27,696
Aw!

1201
00:52:40,916 --> 00:52:42,952
Heave, ho-ho-ho!

1202
00:52:42,987 --> 00:52:44,782
Heave, ho-ho-ho!

1203
00:52:44,816 --> 00:52:46,266
Heave! Good.

1204
00:52:54,309 --> 00:52:56,483
Pull, Santa, Pull.

1205
00:52:56,518 --> 00:52:57,864
You sure these
are the right size?

1206
00:52:57,898 --> 00:52:59,245
Yes.

1207
00:53:00,832 --> 00:53:02,420
Whoo. Whoo.

1208
00:53:24,408 --> 00:53:26,237
Robin,
you're the best.

1209
00:53:26,272 --> 00:53:27,238
I know.

1210
00:53:30,759 --> 00:53:33,313
You're looking very sharp
for the big day, Snowball.

1211
00:53:34,349 --> 00:53:36,454
What? No.

1212
00:53:36,489 --> 00:53:38,353
I haven't told him yet,

1213
00:53:38,387 --> 00:53:39,354
but I will.

1214
00:53:39,388 --> 00:53:41,356
I mean, there's no rush.

1215
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:42,840
We haven't even set
a date yet.

1216
00:53:44,048 --> 00:53:45,256
Rush what?

1217
00:53:46,533 --> 00:53:47,914
Um...

1218
00:53:47,948 --> 00:53:50,261
I was... I was just
telling Snowball

1219
00:53:50,296 --> 00:53:52,608
that, now that we're engaged,

1220
00:53:52,643 --> 00:53:54,058
that we don't have to
rush getting married.

1221
00:53:54,092 --> 00:53:55,266
We can take our time

1222
00:53:55,301 --> 00:53:56,509
and set a date
and plan, and...

1223
00:53:56,543 --> 00:53:58,338
You know, actually,
I was thinking

1224
00:53:58,373 --> 00:54:01,030
maybe we could...
we could do that sooner

1225
00:54:01,065 --> 00:54:01,928
rather than later.

1226
00:54:03,412 --> 00:54:05,587
Sooner...

1227
00:54:07,554 --> 00:54:10,523
Okay, well,
the summer is always nice.

1228
00:54:10,557 --> 00:54:13,491
And the... The fall
would be beautiful,

1229
00:54:13,526 --> 00:54:14,872
with all the leaves...

1230
00:54:14,906 --> 00:54:17,461
I was actually thinking
this Christmas.

1231
00:54:20,705 --> 00:54:21,637
This Christmas?

1232
00:54:21,672 --> 00:54:23,363
Yeah. Why not?

1233
00:54:23,398 --> 00:54:24,364
We're already here,

1234
00:54:24,399 --> 00:54:25,538
your family's here,

1235
00:54:25,572 --> 00:54:26,677
Mario, the elves...

1236
00:54:26,711 --> 00:54:28,610
Plus your dad
will be done

1237
00:54:28,644 --> 00:54:30,025
delivering all
the presents.

1238
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:31,337
He can kick back,

1239
00:54:31,371 --> 00:54:32,683
have an extra egg nog
or two...

1240
00:54:32,717 --> 00:54:34,443
But what about
your parents?

1241
00:54:34,478 --> 00:54:35,651
Well, first of all,

1242
00:54:35,686 --> 00:54:36,790
my parents are in
Florida vacationing,

1243
00:54:36,825 --> 00:54:38,447
like they do
every Christmas.

1244
00:54:38,482 --> 00:54:39,724
Second of all,
they eloped themselves,

1245
00:54:39,759 --> 00:54:41,036
I already talked
to them on the phone,

1246
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:43,383
and they're great with it.

1247
00:54:59,641 --> 00:55:01,367
Is that
your holiday stew?

1248
00:55:01,401 --> 00:55:02,644
Yes, it is.

1249
00:55:02,678 --> 00:55:04,335
A couple bowls of this

1250
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:05,440
has kept your father going
all Christmas

1251
00:55:05,474 --> 00:55:07,545
for almost 30 years.

1252
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:09,892
I thought a bowl or two
might help Connor along.

1253
00:55:09,927 --> 00:55:10,755
Yeah.

1254
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:12,654
Yeah.

1255
00:55:12,688 --> 00:55:13,724
Um, speaking of Connor,

1256
00:55:13,758 --> 00:55:15,450
we have set a wedding date.

1257
00:55:15,484 --> 00:55:16,796
You did? When?

1258
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:18,556
Christmas Day.

1259
00:55:18,591 --> 00:55:19,661
Honey, that
gives us plenty of time...

1260
00:55:19,695 --> 00:55:21,145
Christmas Day this year.

1261
00:55:21,179 --> 00:55:23,803
Good golly gumdrops,
Holly Claus!

1262
00:55:23,837 --> 00:55:25,460
That's in less
than a week!

1263
00:55:25,494 --> 00:55:26,530
I know, but he was
just so excited

1264
00:55:26,564 --> 00:55:27,531
about being here,

1265
00:55:27,565 --> 00:55:29,567
and us being here, and...

1266
00:55:29,602 --> 00:55:31,120
So he already knows?

1267
00:55:31,155 --> 00:55:33,433
Actually, I wanted to give him a
little bit more time to...

1268
00:55:33,468 --> 00:55:34,365
Holly, really...

1269
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,987
Mom, please.

1270
00:55:36,022 --> 00:55:38,680
I just think
that if can complete one task,

1271
00:55:38,714 --> 00:55:40,854
he's going to feel
a lot better about this.

1272
00:55:40,889 --> 00:55:46,515
Well, let's see
if he could handle...

1273
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:47,136
the sleigh.

1274
00:55:47,171 --> 00:55:48,414
Perfect!

1275
00:55:48,448 --> 00:55:50,519
Except, for now,

1276
00:55:50,554 --> 00:55:52,901
let's keep the reindeer
out of it.

1277
00:55:52,935 --> 00:55:54,696
Right.

1278
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:56,042
All right,
these new hydraulics

1279
00:55:56,076 --> 00:55:58,458
should take some of the load
off the reindeer

1280
00:55:58,493 --> 00:56:00,633
so you can get
to where you need to go

1281
00:56:00,667 --> 00:56:02,462
faster.

1282
00:56:02,497 --> 00:56:03,670
Ooh!

1283
00:56:05,707 --> 00:56:07,571
You guys needed me?

1284
00:56:07,605 --> 00:56:09,676
Yeah,
um, sweetie,

1285
00:56:09,711 --> 00:56:10,919
Mario just added
hydraulics

1286
00:56:10,953 --> 00:56:11,920
to the sleigh.

1287
00:56:11,954 --> 00:56:15,510
To ease the load.

1288
00:56:15,544 --> 00:56:16,925
And we were hoping

1289
00:56:16,959 --> 00:56:18,513
that you might
test-drive it for us,

1290
00:56:18,547 --> 00:56:19,997
considering
you probably know

1291
00:56:20,031 --> 00:56:21,619
a little more about this
than Dad.

1292
00:56:21,654 --> 00:56:22,793
Yeah,

1293
00:56:22,827 --> 00:56:24,898
I'm used to
using reindeer dust.

1294
00:56:24,933 --> 00:56:26,935
Absolutely.

1295
00:56:26,969 --> 00:56:28,454
Yeah, I used to build
go-karts when I was a kid.

1296
00:56:28,488 --> 00:56:30,041
I got this.

1297
00:56:30,076 --> 00:56:31,974
Climb aboard, captain.

1298
00:56:32,975 --> 00:56:35,633
Okay, so, what have we got?

1299
00:56:35,668 --> 00:56:37,532
These ones start it up.

1300
00:56:37,566 --> 00:56:38,498
This one gives it the lift.

1301
00:56:38,533 --> 00:56:39,982
But right now,

1302
00:56:40,017 --> 00:56:41,777
you just want to ease it
out of the barn

1303
00:56:41,812 --> 00:56:43,607
in a hover.

1304
00:56:43,641 --> 00:56:44,711
You got it?

1305
00:56:44,746 --> 00:56:45,885
Got it.

1306
00:56:45,919 --> 00:56:47,576
All right!

1307
00:56:47,611 --> 00:56:49,198
Good man, good man.

1308
00:56:51,511 --> 00:56:52,995
Here we go.

1309
00:56:56,516 --> 00:56:57,483
That was festive. Good tune!

1310
00:56:57,517 --> 00:56:58,656
Yeah!

1311
00:57:00,658 --> 00:57:02,488
Attaboy, attaboy.

1312
00:57:03,799 --> 00:57:04,697
Sounds good.

1313
00:57:04,731 --> 00:57:05,801
-Yeah.
-Yeah!

1314
00:57:05,836 --> 00:57:07,734
It sounds
like it's warmed up.

1315
00:57:07,769 --> 00:57:11,082
So now,
just go up into a hover.

1316
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:15,052
-Here I go.
-Here you go, here you go.

1317
00:57:15,086 --> 00:57:16,053
Nice and easy.

1318
00:57:25,614 --> 00:57:27,064
I... I don't know
what happened.

1319
00:57:29,791 --> 00:57:30,861
Everything was good...

1320
00:57:30,895 --> 00:57:31,862
Mario?

1321
00:57:31,896 --> 00:57:33,588
Duct tape.

1322
00:57:46,704 --> 00:57:48,982
Here you go, Donner.

1323
00:57:49,017 --> 00:57:51,053
That's enough, Thistle.

1324
00:57:52,883 --> 00:57:54,712
Good night, now.

1325
00:57:56,611 --> 00:57:58,716
Hey.

1326
00:57:58,751 --> 00:58:00,028
Can Mario fix the sleigh?

1327
00:58:00,062 --> 00:58:02,237
He'll set it right.

1328
00:58:04,757 --> 00:58:06,793
Dad, do you think
Connor can do it?

1329
00:58:06,828 --> 00:58:09,002
Now, now, now,
let's have none of that talk.

1330
00:58:09,037 --> 00:58:13,282
But he hasn't been able
to finish a single task.

1331
00:58:13,317 --> 00:58:14,491
Holly...

1332
00:58:17,183 --> 00:58:21,912
I flunked
rooftop parallel parking

1333
00:58:21,946 --> 00:58:22,982
seven times.

1334
00:58:24,777 --> 00:58:27,193
My first chimney slide,

1335
00:58:27,227 --> 00:58:29,126
I landed
smack in the fire,

1336
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,817
singed my "South Pole",

1337
00:58:30,852 --> 00:58:31,818
couldn't sit down
for a week.

1338
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:35,788
Darlin', if I can do this,

1339
00:58:35,822 --> 00:58:37,306
have faith he can.

1340
00:58:44,003 --> 00:58:45,660
Hey, Holly?

1341
00:58:45,694 --> 00:58:48,007
I think I might need
some aspirin.

1342
00:58:50,181 --> 00:58:51,320
What about you?

1343
00:58:52,839 --> 00:58:53,668
You know
where the aspirin is?

1344
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:04,748
Hey there, partner.

1345
00:59:04,782 --> 00:59:06,059
Looking for these?

1346
00:59:11,099 --> 00:59:13,066
Nice catch.

1347
00:59:13,101 --> 00:59:14,102
Yeah. Thanks.

1348
00:59:14,136 --> 00:59:16,967
So, from what I hear,

1349
00:59:17,001 --> 00:59:17,968
the big day
is right around the corner.

1350
00:59:18,002 --> 00:59:19,901
Yup.

1351
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:21,937
Bet you never thought
you'd be in the shoes you're in.

1352
00:59:21,972 --> 00:59:23,042
No. Some pretty big shoes.

1353
00:59:23,076 --> 00:59:25,907
Wow, that's an understatement.

1354
00:59:25,941 --> 00:59:27,149
I mean, how many
people can say

1355
00:59:27,184 --> 00:59:28,737
they're marrying
Santa's daughter?

1356
00:59:28,772 --> 00:59:29,738
Just me.

1357
00:59:29,773 --> 00:59:30,912
That's right.

1358
00:59:30,946 --> 00:59:32,914
Just you. You're the one.

1359
00:59:32,948 --> 00:59:34,122
That's right.

1360
00:59:34,156 --> 00:59:35,951
And it's just you

1361
00:59:35,986 --> 00:59:38,057
taking on that big, red,
jolly responsibility too.

1362
00:59:38,091 --> 00:59:39,403
That's right.

1363
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:43,787
Gee, I'm sorry,
I don't really know

1364
00:59:43,821 --> 00:59:45,098
what you're talking about.

1365
00:59:45,133 --> 00:59:47,825
Just the whole
Santa legacy thing.

1366
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:49,102
I mean, you
can't tell me

1367
00:59:49,137 --> 00:59:50,345
you're not just
a little bit freaked out

1368
00:59:50,379 --> 00:59:52,347
about the idea
of becoming Santa, right?

1369
00:59:57,283 --> 01:00:01,080
Wow.

1370
01:00:01,114 --> 01:00:02,668
She hasn't told you, has she?

1371
01:00:02,702 --> 01:00:04,980
What?!

1372
01:00:05,015 --> 01:00:09,295
Well, this is awkward...
for me.

1373
01:00:09,329 --> 01:00:11,055
Okay, so,
what you're saying

1374
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:12,850
is that,
because I'm marrying Holly,

1375
01:00:12,885 --> 01:00:14,334
I'm actually
next in line

1376
01:00:14,369 --> 01:00:15,922
to be Santa?

1377
01:00:15,957 --> 01:00:17,372
That's about right.

1378
01:00:17,406 --> 01:00:19,995
Hit the nail
on the head.

1379
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:21,859
Why wouldn't
she tell you?

1380
01:00:21,894 --> 01:00:22,791
You know?

1381
01:00:22,826 --> 01:00:24,206
Yeah, of course,

1382
01:00:24,241 --> 01:00:25,207
I guess
she could have her reasons,

1383
01:00:25,242 --> 01:00:28,210
like... maybe in her heart

1384
01:00:28,245 --> 01:00:30,143
she knows
you're not cut out for the job?

1385
01:00:32,836 --> 01:00:34,838
Look, I'm...
I'm sorry.

1386
01:00:34,872 --> 01:00:38,220
Forget I said anything,
all right?

1387
01:00:38,255 --> 01:00:41,223
You're a good man,
Connor, okay.

1388
01:00:41,258 --> 01:00:42,846
And I'm sure
you understand

1389
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:43,881
that Christmas
is the most magical day

1390
01:00:43,916 --> 01:00:45,849
of the year...

1391
01:00:45,883 --> 01:00:48,403
which is why I know
you wouldn't want to spoil it

1392
01:00:48,437 --> 01:00:50,232
for generations to come.

1393
01:00:50,267 --> 01:00:52,856
Right, buddy?

1394
01:00:54,996 --> 01:00:56,998
Feel better, bud.

1395
01:01:07,836 --> 01:01:08,906
Ooh!

1396
01:01:12,289 --> 01:01:14,325
Hey, Snowball.

1397
01:01:15,982 --> 01:01:18,778
Okay, I'll take care
of that.

1398
01:01:21,954 --> 01:01:24,957
We need some aspirin...

1399
01:01:24,991 --> 01:01:26,959
Actually, I already
took care of it.

1400
01:01:26,993 --> 01:01:28,961
You did?

1401
01:01:28,995 --> 01:01:30,445
I think I should just
go check on him anyway.

1402
01:01:30,479 --> 01:01:31,342
It's okay.

1403
01:01:31,377 --> 01:01:32,758
He was almost asleep.

1404
01:01:32,792 --> 01:01:33,759
Poor guy.

1405
01:01:33,793 --> 01:01:35,346
Really?

1406
01:01:35,381 --> 01:01:36,762
That arctic air
is really knocking him out.

1407
01:01:36,796 --> 01:01:38,142
Yeah.

1408
01:01:38,177 --> 01:01:40,317
So why don't you
just let him rest?

1409
01:01:40,351 --> 01:01:42,975
Let's say we have
a cup of cider?

1410
01:01:43,009 --> 01:01:43,596
I really should...

1411
01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:45,322
I'd love
some cider.

1412
01:01:45,356 --> 01:01:47,117
After a day like this,
I'll take two cups.

1413
01:01:47,151 --> 01:01:48,325
All right.

1414
01:01:48,359 --> 01:01:50,120
Then we'll all
raise a glass?

1415
01:01:50,154 --> 01:01:53,123
I...
I really should, um...

1416
01:01:53,157 --> 01:01:55,781
-Come on. Yeah!
-Okay.

1417
01:01:55,815 --> 01:01:57,955
All right.

1418
01:02:13,419 --> 01:02:16,560
So we snuck out
around midnight,

1419
01:02:16,594 --> 01:02:18,562
without waking
any of the elves,

1420
01:02:18,596 --> 01:02:20,081
and then
we pushed the sleigh

1421
01:02:20,115 --> 01:02:21,392
out of the barn.

1422
01:02:21,427 --> 01:02:23,429
Holly bribed the reindeer

1423
01:02:23,463 --> 01:02:24,464
so they'd help us out
and keep quiet.

1424
01:02:24,499 --> 01:02:26,363
With candy apples.

1425
01:02:26,397 --> 01:02:28,089
That's right,
with candy apples!

1426
01:02:28,123 --> 01:02:30,781
So we pushed the sleigh
far enough away

1427
01:02:30,816 --> 01:02:33,232
that when we took off,
you guys wouldn't hear us.

1428
01:02:33,266 --> 01:02:35,096
You're such rascals!

1429
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:38,202
Well, it didn't hurt
that we gave you hot cocoa!

1430
01:02:39,238 --> 01:02:40,584
That's right.

1431
01:02:40,618 --> 01:02:42,413
Where did you two fly to?

1432
01:02:42,448 --> 01:02:44,968
We went all the way
to the top of Snowy Ridge.

1433
01:02:45,969 --> 01:02:48,385
It was beautiful.

1434
01:02:48,419 --> 01:02:50,594
You always could
handle the sleigh, Jack.

1435
01:02:50,628 --> 01:02:52,078
Well, I had
a great co-pilot.

1436
01:02:52,113 --> 01:02:53,286
-Ooh.
-Aw.

1437
01:02:53,321 --> 01:02:55,392
I'm about ready for a top-off.

1438
01:02:56,634 --> 01:02:59,568
How about we do
some Christmas caroling?

1439
01:02:59,603 --> 01:03:01,191
You guys used to do
some caroling.

1440
01:03:01,225 --> 01:03:03,262
What was one of the songs
you used to sing?

1441
01:03:03,296 --> 01:03:04,125
you mean this one?

1442
01:03:04,159 --> 01:03:09,855

01:03:17,172 --> 01:03:19,036
- Join me up here.
- No.

1447
01:03:19,071 --> 01:03:20,210
Join in.

1448
01:03:20,244 --> 01:03:21,590
-No, I don't want to.
-Come on!

1449
01:03:21,625 --> 01:03:23,523
Honey, we haven't heard
you sing in so long.

1450
01:03:23,558 --> 01:03:24,524
This is true.

1451
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:25,387
Come on.

01:03:25,422 --> 01:03:26,872

Are you okay?

1489
01:06:03,511 --> 01:06:05,168
Dear Holly,

1490
01:06:05,202 --> 01:06:06,617
The first day
I laid eyes on you,

1491
01:06:06,652 --> 01:06:08,102
I knew I'd be a lucky man

1492
01:06:08,136 --> 01:06:10,138
if you ever gave me
a second glance...

1493
01:06:10,173 --> 01:06:11,726
because not only

1494
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,141
were you the most beautiful girl
in the room,

1495
01:06:13,176 --> 01:06:15,730
but you were the most radiant.

1496
01:06:15,764 --> 01:06:19,044
But I took a chance,

1497
01:06:19,078 --> 01:06:21,080
and when I did,

1498
01:06:21,115 --> 01:06:22,564
not only did you give me
a second glance,

1499
01:06:22,599 --> 01:06:24,049
but one
of the most magical nights

1500
01:06:24,083 --> 01:06:25,982
of my life.

1501
01:06:27,811 --> 01:06:30,262
I know I've told you before,
Holly,

1502
01:06:30,296 --> 01:06:32,747
but I fell in love with you
that night,

1503
01:06:32,781 --> 01:06:35,232
and nothing has come close
to that moment

1504
01:06:35,267 --> 01:06:37,476
until the day you said yes.

1505
01:06:40,306 --> 01:06:42,308
I love you, Holly...

1506
01:06:42,343 --> 01:06:44,655
and I'd do anything
for you,

1507
01:06:44,690 --> 01:06:47,175
which is why
I'm saying goodbye...

1508
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:50,109
because you deserve someone
who will take the reins

1509
01:06:50,144 --> 01:06:51,283
and fill your father's boots

1510
01:06:51,317 --> 01:06:53,664
in a way
that I'll never be able to,

1511
01:06:53,699 --> 01:06:56,184
and I cherish Christmas too much
for that.

1512
01:06:56,219 --> 01:06:58,083
And I love you even more.

1513
01:07:00,533 --> 01:07:02,294
Merry Christmas, Holly.

1514
01:07:02,328 --> 01:07:05,435
Love always, Connor.

1515
01:07:19,104 --> 01:07:21,658
Craftsmanship nowadays...

1516
01:07:23,211 --> 01:07:27,181
You think
this is real funny, do you?

1517
01:07:47,235 --> 01:07:49,582
What is it,
Jingles?

1518
01:07:51,688 --> 01:07:53,310
I was...

1519
01:07:55,554 --> 01:07:58,522
I was going to tell him,
you know...

1520
01:07:58,557 --> 01:07:59,592
prepare him.

1521
01:08:01,284 --> 01:08:04,252
But I guess he found out
and panicked.

1522
01:08:06,496 --> 01:08:09,637
But that's not
the worst of it.

1523
01:08:10,845 --> 01:08:13,399
The worst of it
is that I doubted him...

1524
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,712
I doubted if
he was up for the job

1525
01:08:15,746 --> 01:08:17,300
of being Santa...

1526
01:08:19,819 --> 01:08:25,308
which is terrible,
because... I love him.

1527
01:08:28,656 --> 01:08:32,729
I guess if I had
kept the faith

1528
01:08:32,763 --> 01:08:38,804
and not fallen
into doubt,

1529
01:08:38,838 --> 01:08:40,806
he would still be here.

1530
01:08:42,428 --> 01:08:47,709
Chestnut, there was
nothing you did.

1531
01:08:47,744 --> 01:08:49,642
This is on him.

1532
01:08:49,677 --> 01:08:52,473
And destiny.

1533
01:08:52,507 --> 01:08:55,579
And if it was meant to be,

1534
01:08:55,614 --> 01:08:58,755
the stars will align,

1535
01:08:58,789 --> 01:09:01,413
and believe me...

1536
01:09:01,447 --> 01:09:03,484
he'll be back.

1537
01:09:07,591 --> 01:09:12,389
What if that
doesn't happen?

1538
01:09:12,424 --> 01:09:14,564
Well...

1539
01:09:14,598 --> 01:09:16,842
you'll still
be all right.

1540
01:09:32,892 --> 01:09:35,895
I just got a huge order
for hunky Santa dolls.

1541
01:09:35,930 --> 01:09:37,656
Yes!

1542
01:09:37,690 --> 01:09:39,761
Merry Christmas!

1543
01:09:47,631 --> 01:09:49,426
Hey.

1544
01:09:55,777 --> 01:09:57,676
Yeah.

1545
01:09:58,918 --> 01:10:00,989
I heard
what happened,

1546
01:10:01,024 --> 01:10:04,441
and that's lousy.

1547
01:10:04,476 --> 01:10:07,237
I mean,
a Dear John letter?

1548
01:10:07,272 --> 01:10:09,446
I mean, at least
be man enough

1549
01:10:09,481 --> 01:10:12,760
to tell you
to your face, right?

1550
01:10:12,794 --> 01:10:14,313
I guess that's why

1551
01:10:14,348 --> 01:10:17,489
he's not cut out
for the job.

1552
01:10:18,490 --> 01:10:20,354
What do you want, Jack?

1553
01:10:30,605 --> 01:10:32,987
What I've always wanted.

1554
01:10:38,510 --> 01:10:39,821
You.

1555
01:10:41,996 --> 01:10:44,274
Really, Jack? Now?

1556
01:10:44,309 --> 01:10:46,932
Now is a better time
than never.

1557
01:10:46,966 --> 01:10:52,420
I can't lose you
again, Holly.

1558
01:10:52,455 --> 01:10:54,664
You've got to know it...
We're meant for each other.

1559
01:10:54,698 --> 01:10:57,011
Your dad knows it,
your mom knows it.

1560
01:10:57,045 --> 01:10:59,876
You've got to know it.

1561
01:10:59,910 --> 01:11:01,705
I mean,

1562
01:11:01,740 --> 01:11:04,501
think about how much fun
we all had together

1563
01:11:04,536 --> 01:11:07,573
the other night.

1564
01:11:07,608 --> 01:11:09,748
Right?

1565
01:11:09,782 --> 01:11:12,440
And there's no doubt that
I'm the man for the job.

1566
01:11:14,787 --> 01:11:16,306
I...

1567
01:11:17,825 --> 01:11:19,930
Just think about it.

1568
01:11:19,965 --> 01:11:22,312
That's all I'm asking.

1569
01:11:56,795 --> 01:11:58,866
Wow.

1570
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:01,351
That's quite the piece of ice
you got there.

1571
01:12:01,386 --> 01:12:04,975
Jack gave it to me.

1572
01:12:05,010 --> 01:12:10,049
He asked me to marry him,
in so many words.

1573
01:12:10,084 --> 01:12:12,604
Well, can't say
I'm surprised.

1574
01:12:14,744 --> 01:12:18,713
I guess you think
that's a good idea?

1575
01:12:18,748 --> 01:12:20,922
He would make
a great Santa.

1576
01:12:21,923 --> 01:12:23,097
I don't think

1577
01:12:23,131 --> 01:12:24,892
anything other than

1578
01:12:24,926 --> 01:12:27,826
wanting my little girl
to be happy.

1579
01:12:27,860 --> 01:12:30,415
And does he?

1580
01:12:30,449 --> 01:12:32,106
Does Jack make you happy?

1581
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:35,661
I don't think
it matters, does it?

1582
01:12:39,631 --> 01:12:44,739
You know what I love best
about being Santa?

1583
01:12:44,774 --> 01:12:47,432
The look on
those kids' faces

1584
01:12:47,466 --> 01:12:48,778
when they open up
a present

1585
01:12:48,812 --> 01:12:51,919
they've been wishing for
all year.

1586
01:12:53,955 --> 01:12:55,819
The twinkle
they get in their eyes...

1587
01:12:55,854 --> 01:13:00,065
The flush of pink
to their cheeks...

1588
01:13:00,099 --> 01:13:04,034
The feeling of pure joy.

1589
01:13:10,869 --> 01:13:14,562
Now, you tell me,

1590
01:13:14,597 --> 01:13:19,429
does it matter
if he makes you happy?

1591
01:13:34,099 --> 01:13:35,445
Connor!

1592
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:37,482
Surprised to
see you here, buddy.

1593
01:13:37,516 --> 01:13:39,967
I thought you would have
taken off for the holidays.

1594
01:13:40,001 --> 01:13:41,900
Yeah, I decided to come back,
you know, get some work done.

1595
01:13:43,004 --> 01:13:44,247
Yeah, well,

1596
01:13:44,281 --> 01:13:45,766
thanks to my new
hunky Santa doll,

1597
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:47,250
Wegman's throwing us
another party.

1598
01:13:47,284 --> 01:13:48,527
Yeah, but don't worry,

1599
01:13:48,562 --> 01:13:49,770
you don't need
to stick around.

1600
01:13:49,804 --> 01:13:52,048
Don't do us
any favors, okay?

1601
01:14:23,804 --> 01:14:26,531
So I was thinking
of a sexy Santa doll

1602
01:14:26,565 --> 01:14:27,635
to go with the hulky Santa
doll...

1603
01:14:27,670 --> 01:14:29,534
-I need a focus group!
-What?

1604
01:14:29,568 --> 01:14:30,880
Focus group. I need one.

1605
01:14:30,914 --> 01:14:32,640
No, no, no, no,
Connor, not now.

1606
01:14:32,675 --> 01:14:33,503
Can't you see?

1607
01:14:33,538 --> 01:14:34,297
You know...

1608
01:14:36,092 --> 01:14:39,060
Besides, all you've got
is that weird dog thing,

1609
01:14:39,095 --> 01:14:40,303
and it was a flop.

1610
01:14:40,337 --> 01:14:41,891
That's right,
Connor,

1611
01:14:41,925 --> 01:14:43,202
the dog with wheels.

1612
01:14:43,237 --> 01:14:45,170
Yeah. Wheels are turnin'.

1613
01:14:45,204 --> 01:14:46,999
Mr. Wegman, trust me.

1614
01:14:47,034 --> 01:14:48,276
I got something.

1615
01:14:55,698 --> 01:14:57,562
Holly?

1616
01:14:57,596 --> 01:14:59,702
Hey!

1617
01:15:03,119 --> 01:15:04,879
It's me, Jack.

1618
01:15:06,087 --> 01:15:07,813
You wanted to see me?

1619
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:25,175
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1620
01:15:32,044 --> 01:15:35,013
You're the man, Jack.

1621
01:15:35,047 --> 01:15:35,876
That's right.

1622
01:15:37,705 --> 01:15:40,328
All you've got
to say now is "I do,"

1623
01:15:40,363 --> 01:15:42,192
and this
will all be yours.

1624
01:15:44,367 --> 01:15:46,334
Ho, ho, ho!

1625
01:15:46,369 --> 01:15:48,302
All of you are naughty.

1626
01:15:55,171 --> 01:15:58,036
So that's what this
has always been about?

1627
01:15:58,070 --> 01:16:00,072
Wh... Holly, baby.

1628
01:16:00,107 --> 01:16:02,040
I was just
trying it on.

1629
01:16:02,074 --> 01:16:03,041
And guess what?

1630
01:16:03,075 --> 01:16:04,387
Fits like a glove.

1631
01:16:04,421 --> 01:16:06,354
Just as I said...

1632
01:16:06,389 --> 01:16:08,736
we're the perfect match.

1633
01:16:08,771 --> 01:16:11,221
Don't try to get yourself
out of this one, Jack,

1634
01:16:11,256 --> 01:16:13,292
'cause I get it now.

1635
01:16:13,327 --> 01:16:15,260
I mean, I can't believe
it took me this long to see it.

1636
01:16:15,294 --> 01:16:16,744
This...

1637
01:16:16,779 --> 01:16:18,125
This is what
you've always wanted.

1638
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:19,575
Not me.

1639
01:16:23,302 --> 01:16:24,614
Holly, please.

1640
01:16:24,649 --> 01:16:26,236
How can you say that?

1641
01:16:26,271 --> 01:16:27,721
It's only ever
been about you.

1642
01:16:27,755 --> 01:16:29,136
I mean, look at us.

1643
01:16:29,170 --> 01:16:31,103
We've been a team
since we were kids.

1644
01:16:32,415 --> 01:16:34,141
I love you.

1645
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:35,349
You know what,

1646
01:16:35,383 --> 01:16:36,902
if actually cared,

1647
01:16:36,937 --> 01:16:39,146
I might try to believe you.

1648
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:40,147
But I don't.

1649
01:16:40,181 --> 01:16:41,631
Holly.

1650
01:16:41,666 --> 01:16:42,908
Come on,
of course you care.

1651
01:16:42,943 --> 01:16:44,427
You're Holly Claus.

1652
01:16:44,461 --> 01:16:46,118
The most important thing
in the world to you

1653
01:16:46,153 --> 01:16:47,810
is Christmas.

1654
01:16:47,844 --> 01:16:52,331
So, really,
if you care about Christmas,

1655
01:16:52,366 --> 01:16:54,851
you care about us.

1656
01:16:57,302 --> 01:16:58,683
You're right.

1657
01:16:58,717 --> 01:17:00,305
I do care about Christmas.

1658
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:02,687
I knew it.

1659
01:17:02,721 --> 01:17:04,343
So, what do you say?

1660
01:17:04,378 --> 01:17:08,209
Shall we make this
official?

1661
01:17:08,244 --> 01:17:10,798
All right.

1662
01:17:10,833 --> 01:17:14,768
I'm officially taking over
the role of Santa.

1663
01:17:15,769 --> 01:17:16,908
What did you say?

1664
01:17:16,942 --> 01:17:18,288
I'm going to do it.

1665
01:17:18,323 --> 01:17:19,255
I'm going to do the job.

1666
01:17:21,878 --> 01:17:23,431
That's... That's golden.

1667
01:17:23,466 --> 01:17:24,743
Man...

1668
01:17:24,778 --> 01:17:28,264
You, as Santa,
with the belly...

1669
01:17:28,298 --> 01:17:30,369
and the beard!

1670
01:17:30,404 --> 01:17:31,923
I'm serious, Jack.

1671
01:17:31,957 --> 01:17:32,924
Why not?

1672
01:17:32,958 --> 01:17:35,374
As long as the job
gets done.

1673
01:17:35,409 --> 01:17:37,756
And I know I can do it.

1674
01:17:40,759 --> 01:17:41,760
Don't be
ridiculous, Holly.

1675
01:17:41,795 --> 01:17:42,934
I should be Santa.

1676
01:17:42,968 --> 01:17:43,900
Not you.

1677
01:17:43,935 --> 01:17:45,902
I mean, come on.

1678
01:17:45,937 --> 01:17:48,387
Do you know how many years
I've been working towards this,

1679
01:17:48,422 --> 01:17:50,804
with you
and your family?

1680
01:17:50,838 --> 01:17:52,909
Do you know how many
of your mom's cookies

1681
01:17:52,944 --> 01:17:53,945
I've had to choke down
over the years

1682
01:17:53,979 --> 01:17:55,774
to get here?

1683
01:17:55,809 --> 01:17:57,949
I thought you loved
my cookies.

1684
01:17:57,983 --> 01:18:01,918
Of course
I love your cookies, Momma.

1685
01:18:01,953 --> 01:18:02,954
I was just
saying that...

1686
01:18:02,988 --> 01:18:04,438
Save it, Jack.

1687
01:18:04,472 --> 01:18:05,957
And do me a favor.
Take off the jacket.

1688
01:18:05,991 --> 01:18:07,959
And don't call me "Momma".

1689
01:18:26,805 --> 01:18:27,461
You're making
the biggest mistake

1690
01:18:27,495 --> 01:18:28,738
of your life.

1691
01:18:30,015 --> 01:18:31,776
I'll take that chance.

1692
01:18:45,030 --> 01:18:46,860
So...

1693
01:18:46,894 --> 01:18:49,897
You are going to follow
in your father's footsteps?

1694
01:18:49,932 --> 01:18:53,349
I'm going to try.

1695
01:18:55,109 --> 01:18:57,456
You think Dad
will be okay with it?

1696
01:18:57,491 --> 01:18:59,562
Given that
you're your father's daughter,

1697
01:18:59,596 --> 01:19:01,909
I think he'll be just fine.

1698
01:19:06,465 --> 01:19:07,984
This is going
to be weak.

1699
01:19:16,544 --> 01:19:18,512
Hey, boys and girls.

1700
01:19:18,546 --> 01:19:21,308
Listen, have I got a toy
for you, okay.

1701
01:19:21,342 --> 01:19:23,034
Now, this toy...

1702
01:19:23,068 --> 01:19:26,520
the batteries
will never, ever, ever run out.

1703
01:19:26,554 --> 01:19:28,177
You'll never
have to charge them.

1704
01:19:28,211 --> 01:19:32,008
Okay, this toy will stand
the test of time, okay,

1705
01:19:32,043 --> 01:19:33,009
and it will be with you

1706
01:19:33,044 --> 01:19:34,562
for as long

1707
01:19:34,597 --> 01:19:35,978
as you're willing
to take care of it.

1708
01:19:37,462 --> 01:19:39,050
This toy...

1709
01:19:46,229 --> 01:19:47,610
...is Fido.

1710
01:19:47,644 --> 01:19:49,025
This is
ridiculous!

1711
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:50,233
Come on,

1712
01:19:50,268 --> 01:19:51,890
give the kid one of
my hunky Santa dolls.

1713
01:19:51,925 --> 01:19:53,547
Or try one of my
hunky Santa dolls.

1714
01:19:53,581 --> 01:19:55,135
Okay, for the last time,
it was my idea, okay?

1715
01:19:55,169 --> 01:19:56,032
So drop it.

1716
01:19:56,067 --> 01:19:57,206
Not even.

1717
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:58,138
Look,
yes, it was.

1718
01:19:58,172 --> 01:19:59,933
Meet Fido.

1719
01:19:59,967 --> 01:20:01,072
By the way,
a winky face means nothing.

1720
01:20:01,106 --> 01:20:02,867
It just makes you look
like a stalker.

1721
01:20:07,043 --> 01:20:08,389
Hey, can I
have a turn?

1722
01:20:12,048 --> 01:20:13,325
Hey, this is cool.

1723
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:16,570
-What is it?
-It's a toy dog!

1724
01:20:19,228 --> 01:20:21,195
I like its ears.

1725
01:20:21,230 --> 01:20:23,266
Yeah, he looks
really cool.

1726
01:20:23,301 --> 01:20:25,924
-Wow!
-Wow, I love it.

1727
01:20:29,583 --> 01:20:32,068
Brilliant, Connor,

1728
01:20:32,103 --> 01:20:34,105
just brilliant.

1729
01:20:34,139 --> 01:20:35,520
Work with me.

1730
01:20:37,039 --> 01:20:39,489
That was one heck
of a presentation.

1731
01:20:39,524 --> 01:20:41,250
Holy Dinah.

1732
01:20:41,284 --> 01:20:42,941
And I've got to say, Connor,

1733
01:20:42,976 --> 01:20:46,013
this whole time,
I knew you had it in you.

1734
01:20:46,048 --> 01:20:47,118
Wesley!

1735
01:20:47,152 --> 01:20:48,913
-I'm right here, Mr....
-Geez!

1736
01:20:48,947 --> 01:20:50,086
Wesley, let's
get this toy ready

1737
01:20:50,121 --> 01:20:51,363
to roll out
into production,

1738
01:20:51,398 --> 01:20:53,262
ASAP!

1739
01:20:53,296 --> 01:20:54,988
Got it.

1740
01:20:55,022 --> 01:20:58,025
And let's cut the order
of hunky Santa dolls

1741
01:20:58,060 --> 01:20:59,302
in half.

1742
01:20:59,337 --> 01:21:01,270
I want to double up
on Fido.

1743
01:21:01,304 --> 01:21:03,306
No. Really?

1744
01:21:03,341 --> 01:21:07,897
I am so sorry your idea
didn't pan out, Wesley.

1745
01:21:07,932 --> 01:21:09,934
Okay,
so much bickering.

1746
01:21:09,968 --> 01:21:11,970
Let's go.
Back to work.

1747
01:21:12,005 --> 01:21:14,041
The classic toys
are back!

1748
01:21:20,392 --> 01:21:22,360
Whoa, Connor...

1749
01:21:22,394 --> 01:21:23,706
A little success

1750
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:26,536
has given you
quite the appetite.

1751
01:21:26,571 --> 01:21:28,055
That's a lot
of donuts.

1752
01:21:32,232 --> 01:21:34,061
Ha! I can do it!

1753
01:21:34,751 --> 01:21:35,718
You can do it?

1754
01:21:35,752 --> 01:21:36,684
Look, I can do it!

1755
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:38,031
You can do it.

1756
01:21:38,065 --> 01:21:38,894
Do it!

1757
01:21:40,033 --> 01:21:42,552
I can do it.
I did that!

1758
01:21:45,107 --> 01:21:46,556
Cookie break is over.

1759
01:21:46,591 --> 01:21:47,972
Back to work.

1760
01:21:48,006 --> 01:21:50,043
Aww!

1761
01:21:50,077 --> 01:21:51,976
Ho, ho, ho!

1762
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:53,391
How can I help you?

1763
01:21:53,425 --> 01:21:54,323
Mario?

1764
01:21:54,357 --> 01:21:55,324
Hey, it's Connor.

1765
01:21:55,358 --> 01:21:57,291
How you doing, Sasquatch?

1766
01:21:57,326 --> 01:21:58,396
Listen...

1767
01:21:58,430 --> 01:22:00,087
Merry Christmas, Stuart.

1768
01:22:00,122 --> 01:22:00,846
Hey, can you pick me up
at the airport?

1769
01:22:00,881 --> 01:22:03,056
Hey, you bet your tinsel
I can.

1770
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:04,333
Awesome. Yes!

1771
01:22:04,367 --> 01:22:05,748
Listen... Um...

1772
01:22:05,782 --> 01:22:06,956
I'll see you
after the next flight.

1773
01:22:06,991 --> 01:22:07,715
You got it!

1774
01:22:07,750 --> 01:22:08,647
Yeah.

1775
01:22:12,030 --> 01:22:14,101
The stars have aligned.

1776
01:22:15,309 --> 01:22:16,276
Merry Christmas!

1777
01:22:16,310 --> 01:22:17,277
Merry Christmas!

1778
01:22:17,311 --> 01:22:19,624
Merry Christmas, everyone!

1779
01:22:19,658 --> 01:22:21,246
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

1780
01:22:21,281 --> 01:22:22,454
Merry Christmas.

1781
01:22:22,489 --> 01:22:23,628
Merry Christmas.

1782
01:22:23,662 --> 01:22:25,492
Whoo!

1783
01:22:25,526 --> 01:22:26,700
Merry Christmas, sir.

1784
01:22:33,051 --> 01:22:35,433
All right, Donner,

1785
01:22:35,467 --> 01:22:37,124
seeing as I'm going to be

1786
01:22:37,159 --> 01:22:39,057
the one holding the reins
one day,

1787
01:22:39,092 --> 01:22:40,679
I should probably
get some practice in?

1788
01:22:42,612 --> 01:22:44,131
Well, thank you.

1789
01:22:44,166 --> 01:22:45,753
I appreciate
the vote of confidence.

1790
01:22:45,788 --> 01:22:48,135
I think I can do it too.

1791
01:22:48,170 --> 01:22:50,448
I just wish I didn't
have to do it alone.

1792
01:22:50,482 --> 01:22:51,276
You don't.

1793
01:22:55,315 --> 01:22:57,041
Connor!

1794
01:23:05,049 --> 01:23:08,293
Holly, I am so sorry.

1795
01:23:08,328 --> 01:23:09,708
It's okay.

1796
01:23:09,743 --> 01:23:12,297
No, it's not okay.

1797
01:23:12,332 --> 01:23:15,024
I should never
have left you like I did.

1798
01:23:15,059 --> 01:23:18,269
I should have
talked to you first,

1799
01:23:18,303 --> 01:23:20,064
'cause that's what
couples do, right?

1800
01:23:20,098 --> 01:23:22,100
They talk it out.

1801
01:23:22,135 --> 01:23:24,206
And if I would have
done that,

1802
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:25,379
then maybe
I would have realized

1803
01:23:25,414 --> 01:23:27,071
that the reason
I wasn't succeeding

1804
01:23:27,105 --> 01:23:29,073
was because of my confidence,

1805
01:23:29,107 --> 01:23:30,384
my lack of it.

1806
01:23:30,419 --> 01:23:32,041
Connor,

1807
01:23:32,076 --> 01:23:33,318
I never wanted

1808
01:23:33,353 --> 01:23:35,251
to put that kind
of pressure on you...

1809
01:23:37,426 --> 01:23:39,324
which is why I waited
to tell you,

1810
01:23:39,359 --> 01:23:43,328
because I was...
I was afraid.

1811
01:23:43,363 --> 01:23:45,399
And I totally understand
if you don't want to...

1812
01:23:45,434 --> 01:23:47,056
No, no, I do.

1813
01:23:47,091 --> 01:23:49,265
I want to do it.

1814
01:23:50,784 --> 01:23:53,752
I can, Holly.

1815
01:23:55,168 --> 01:23:56,238
You watch me.

1816
01:24:01,450 --> 01:24:02,416
Here I come!

1817
01:24:10,114 --> 01:24:12,564
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

1818
01:24:12,599 --> 01:24:15,498
My, my, my!

1819
01:24:29,236 --> 01:24:30,686
And remember,

1820
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:34,897
a busy elf
is a happy elf.

1821
01:24:34,931 --> 01:24:36,278
Ha, ha, ha!

1822
01:24:36,312 --> 01:24:39,108
All right, Ewing,
loading it up.

1823
01:24:39,143 --> 01:24:40,834
Yeah!

1824
01:24:40,868 --> 01:24:43,216
With the legs... Yeah.

1825
01:24:44,424 --> 01:24:48,393
Ho, ho, how do I look?

1826
01:24:48,428 --> 01:24:49,636
Honey, well,

1827
01:24:49,670 --> 01:24:50,706
you're a little skinnier
than last year,

1828
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:51,741
but otherwise
pretty perfect.

1829
01:24:51,776 --> 01:24:53,122
Rudolph
just rolled in.

1830
01:24:53,881 --> 01:24:55,297
Thank goodness.

1831
01:24:55,331 --> 01:24:56,194
He always gets here
at the last minute.

1832
01:24:56,229 --> 01:24:57,264
All right.

1833
01:24:57,299 --> 01:24:58,610
Now we're all here,

1834
01:24:58,645 --> 01:25:00,440
I guess it's time
to get this show on the road.

1835
01:25:00,474 --> 01:25:01,717
Connor...

1836
01:25:01,751 --> 01:25:03,546
You'd best get a jacket
or something.

1837
01:25:03,581 --> 01:25:05,445
It gets a bit chilly
up there.

1838
01:25:05,479 --> 01:25:06,549
I'm sorry, where?

1839
01:25:06,584 --> 01:25:07,826
In the sleigh.

1840
01:25:07,861 --> 01:25:09,380
You're coming with me,
aren't you?

1841
01:25:09,414 --> 01:25:11,554
I mean, you need
at least a few practice runs.

1842
01:25:11,589 --> 01:25:12,624
Yes, sir.

1843
01:25:12,659 --> 01:25:14,316
I mean, Santa.

1844
01:25:14,350 --> 01:25:15,800
Yeah, absolutely
I'll go up there with you.

1845
01:25:15,834 --> 01:25:16,939
Then let's do this.

1846
01:25:16,973 --> 01:25:17,595
Ha, ha, ha!

1847
01:25:17,629 --> 01:25:19,321
Whoo!

1848
01:25:21,185 --> 01:25:23,290
Come on, everyone!

1849
01:25:23,325 --> 01:25:25,810
My favorite night
of the year!

1850
01:25:25,844 --> 01:25:27,294
Now, I packed
some extra socks...

1851
01:25:27,329 --> 01:25:28,640
I've got extra socks.

1852
01:25:28,675 --> 01:25:30,297
And some
little snacks,

1853
01:25:30,332 --> 01:25:31,643
and I've got
a lunch for you...

1854
01:25:31,678 --> 01:25:32,748
I don't need lunch.

1855
01:25:32,782 --> 01:25:33,956
I'll be eating
cookies all night.

1856
01:25:33,990 --> 01:25:35,509
Okay, okay.

1857
01:25:35,544 --> 01:25:36,648
Bye-bye, bye-bye.

1858
01:25:36,683 --> 01:25:37,822
Good night.

1859
01:25:37,856 --> 01:25:39,720
-Have a good time.
-Yeah.

1860
01:25:39,755 --> 01:25:40,652
-One more.
-Aw.

1861
01:25:40,928 --> 01:25:41,791
Are you
all right?

1862
01:25:41,826 --> 01:25:42,861
Yeah.

1863
01:25:42,896 --> 01:25:43,793
No, I'm better
than all right.

1864
01:25:43,828 --> 01:25:44,794
I'm great.

1865
01:25:44,829 --> 01:25:46,279
Hop in, Connor.

1866
01:25:46,313 --> 01:25:47,866
There's plenty of room.

1867
01:25:47,901 --> 01:25:49,661
Room for two?

1868
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:51,215
Because this generation
of Clauses

1869
01:25:51,249 --> 01:25:52,802
is going to do it
together.

1870
01:25:52,837 --> 01:25:54,356
Really?

1871
01:25:54,390 --> 01:25:55,322
Yeah.

1872
01:25:55,357 --> 01:25:56,289
That's my girl.

1873
01:25:56,323 --> 01:25:57,290
Come on, come on.

1874
01:25:57,324 --> 01:25:59,533
There's my girl.

1875
01:25:59,568 --> 01:26:02,881
You look
right at home there, Connor.

1876
01:26:02,916 --> 01:26:05,401
Now, will you both
do the honors?

1877
01:26:06,575 --> 01:26:07,576
On...

1878
01:26:07,610 --> 01:26:08,577
Dasher and Dancer

1879
01:26:08,611 --> 01:26:10,234
and Prancer and Vixen!

1880
01:26:10,268 --> 01:26:11,235
On Comet and Cupid

1881
01:26:11,269 --> 01:26:12,719
and Donner and Blitzen!

1882
01:26:12,753 --> 01:26:13,789
And you too, Rudolph!

1883
01:26:13,823 --> 01:26:15,584
Yeah!

1884
01:26:15,618 --> 01:26:16,792
To the top of the porch,
to the top of the wall!

1885
01:26:16,826 --> 01:26:18,380
Now dash away! Dash away!

1886
01:26:18,414 --> 01:26:19,967
Dash away all!

1887
01:26:25,835 --> 01:26:26,905
Bye!

1888
01:26:26,940 --> 01:26:27,941
Merry Christmas!

1889
01:26:35,811 --> 01:26:37,606
Here.

1890
01:26:38,538 --> 01:26:39,746
Whoo!

1891
01:26:43,888 --> 01:26:45,924
Whoo!

1892
01:26:47,788 --> 01:26:53,518
And... Merry Christmas!
