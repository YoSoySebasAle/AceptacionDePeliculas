1
00:04:14,278 --> 00:04:17,412
Drop your rifle.

2
00:04:17,456 --> 00:04:19,806
Get your hands up over your head.

3
00:04:21,938 --> 00:04:25,899
Well, so you've come
to thank me, stranger?

4
00:04:25,942 --> 00:04:27,204
That's one way of putting it,

5
00:04:27,248 --> 00:04:28,771
but I'm a curious man, mister.

6
00:04:28,815 --> 00:04:30,382
Before I thank you, I'd like to know

7
00:04:30,425 --> 00:04:31,557
what you got against me.

8
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,775
Why nothing, son,

9
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:34,560
nothing at all.

10
00:04:34,603 --> 00:04:36,605
Then why did you shoot at me
instead of the Comanches?

11
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:38,477
I'd call that a mighty fair question.

12
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,609
You mind if I put my arm down, son?

13
00:04:40,653 --> 00:04:42,263
I got a bad shoulder.

14
00:04:42,306 --> 00:04:44,744
Just don't go reaching
for any iron, huh.

15
00:04:44,787 --> 00:04:46,267
Well, you might put it onto the head

16
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,095
in the military strategy, son.

17
00:04:48,138 --> 00:04:51,098
You see Comanches sometimes
get queer notions.

18
00:04:51,141 --> 00:04:52,665
They figure that land back there

19
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,362
is kind of sacred.

20
00:04:54,406 --> 00:04:55,624
As long as you was trespassing,

21
00:04:55,668 --> 00:04:57,234
you were safe.

22
00:04:57,278 --> 00:04:59,585
I was just trying to coax you

23
00:04:59,628 --> 00:05:01,369
back onto sacred territory.

24
00:05:01,413 --> 00:05:03,719
So that's why they kept
changing their minds.

25
00:05:06,113 --> 00:05:09,464
I'm afraid I owe you
my sincere apology, sir,

26
00:05:09,508 --> 00:05:10,552
and my thanks.

27
00:05:10,596 --> 00:05:12,685
Ah, there was no real danger.

28
00:05:12,728 --> 00:05:13,903
There's only ten of them

29
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,905
and I still got one good arm left.

30
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,472
Mind if I have a look at this one?

31
00:05:17,516 --> 00:05:19,039
Yeah.

32
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:32,922
This is right friendly
of you, stranger.

33
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:34,446
Looks as though
the Comanches got to you

34
00:05:34,489 --> 00:05:35,751
before they got to me.

35
00:05:35,795 --> 00:05:37,144
There was no Comanches.

36
00:05:37,187 --> 00:05:38,798
Comanches is real friendly people,

37
00:05:38,841 --> 00:05:41,627
if you don't rub them the wrong way.

38
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,020
Let's just say it's a snake bite.

39
00:05:44,064 --> 00:05:45,413
Seems as though the snake

40
00:05:45,457 --> 00:05:47,371
left a little bit of lead in there.

41
00:05:47,415 --> 00:05:50,244
Only one kind of snake
around these parts.

42
00:05:52,115 --> 00:05:54,378
I'll get it out
as quick and easy as I can.

43
00:05:54,422 --> 00:05:55,423
There's no hurry, son.

44
00:05:55,467 --> 00:05:56,946
Only don't throw it away,

45
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,296
I like to save
the lead folks take out of me.

46
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,430
I got me three pounds of it.

47
00:06:02,474 --> 00:06:03,910
I reckon that there is supposed to be

48
00:06:03,953 --> 00:06:05,520
one of them Bowie knives.

49
00:06:05,564 --> 00:06:07,043
That's exactly what it is.

50
00:06:07,087 --> 00:06:08,958
That is exactly what it ain't.

51
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:10,264
That's the poorest imitation

52
00:06:10,307 --> 00:06:13,049
of the genuine article as ever I seen.

53
00:06:13,093 --> 00:06:14,573
- It is.
- Yessiree.

54
00:06:14,616 --> 00:06:17,010
That one is the same
as thousands of others

55
00:06:17,053 --> 00:06:18,968
folks are selling back east.

56
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:20,579
A real Bowie knife,

57
00:06:20,622 --> 00:06:22,624
that's something else again.

58
00:06:22,668 --> 00:06:24,844
I'd ought to know,
I gave Jim Bowie the idea

59
00:06:24,887 --> 00:06:26,498
for that weapon myself.

60
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:27,847
That's mighty interesting.

61
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,502
Yessiree, it was back in Louisiana.

62
00:06:30,545 --> 00:06:32,634
Me and Jim were sitting
on the front porch whipping.

63
00:06:32,678 --> 00:06:34,549
Jim was a rich man in them days.

64
00:06:34,593 --> 00:06:36,029
It was on account that I'd given him

65
00:06:36,072 --> 00:06:38,771
the idea there's plenty
of money in sugar.

66
00:06:38,814 --> 00:06:40,903
No time at all, Jim had cleaned up

67
00:06:40,947 --> 00:06:42,557
three million dollars.

68
00:06:42,601 --> 00:06:44,559
Two million.

69
00:06:44,603 --> 00:06:46,213
You a friend of Jim Bowie's?

70
00:06:46,256 --> 00:06:48,911
- Not particularly.
- Hmm.

71
00:06:48,955 --> 00:06:50,304
Well, anyways, Jim,

72
00:06:50,347 --> 00:06:52,393
I says, 'Someday I'm gonna fashion me

73
00:06:52,436 --> 00:06:55,222
a hunting knife, 16 inches long,

74
00:06:55,265 --> 00:06:58,051
and curved in the end
like a heathen...'

75
00:06:58,094 --> 00:06:59,835
Scimitar.

76
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:02,098
That's right, scimitar.

77
00:07:02,142 --> 00:07:03,578
'So as my hand won't slip,' I says,

78
00:07:03,622 --> 00:07:05,449
'aimed to put cross guard on the hilt,

79
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:07,190
and I'm going to put a double edge

80
00:07:07,234 --> 00:07:08,757
on the last three inches.'

81
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:10,977
Four inches.

82
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,500
Next thing I knowed,

83
00:07:12,544 --> 00:07:13,762
Jim Bowie had beat me to it

84
00:07:13,806 --> 00:07:17,636
and made the knife his self.

85
00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:20,073
I don't think I quite
got your name, son.

86
00:07:20,116 --> 00:07:21,770
James Bowie of Louisiana.

87
00:07:21,814 --> 00:07:24,338
Oh, while you was talking
I was beginning to think--

88
00:07:24,381 --> 00:07:26,775
James Bowie?

89
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:29,735
Why, I'll be hog swallowed.

90
00:07:29,778 --> 00:07:32,564
And whom do I have
the pleasure of digging into?

91
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,739
Dan'I Seeger,

92
00:07:33,782 --> 00:07:35,479
Dan'I Gideon Seeger,

93
00:07:35,523 --> 00:07:37,090
ex-hunter, ex-Indian fighter,

94
00:07:37,133 --> 00:07:39,962
ex-congressman, and as you have
probably figured out,

95
00:07:40,006 --> 00:07:41,964
the biggest hogtied, jugheaded,

96
00:07:42,008 --> 00:07:44,750
turnip sucking liar in the whole world.

97
00:07:44,793 --> 00:07:46,752
Steady now, Dan'I.

98
00:07:46,795 --> 00:07:48,884
I think I got it.

99
00:08:25,965 --> 00:08:27,967
I find this mighty interesting, Jim.

100
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,317
Them bucks out there,
come galloping by,

101
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,188
and see how close they can come to us

102
00:08:32,232 --> 00:08:33,755
with their arrows

103
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,888
and they try again 10 paces further on,

104
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:39,326
and so on.

105
00:08:39,369 --> 00:08:44,157
It's that so on that bothers me.

106
00:08:46,463 --> 00:08:49,423
Well, I wish you were still
a member of congress, Dan'I.

107
00:08:49,466 --> 00:08:51,164
This seems the most appropriate time

108
00:08:51,207 --> 00:08:52,469
to register a complaint.

109
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,356
I call that mighty fair shooting.

110
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:10,749
You take Shoshones, Jim,

111
00:09:10,792 --> 00:09:13,142
they're a bit nearsighted for Indians.

112
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:15,536
Now, if them were Shoshones
instead of Comanches,

113
00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:17,320
I'd be getting a little nervous.

114
00:09:26,112 --> 00:09:28,505
How many rounds do these
games usually run?

115
00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:29,942
Three is about average,

116
00:09:29,985 --> 00:09:31,639
four rounds is extra good.

117
00:09:31,683 --> 00:09:34,207
If it should happen to run up to five,

118
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,949
well, them bucks would be
talking about nothing else

119
00:09:36,992 --> 00:09:38,951
for weeks to come.

120
00:09:38,994 --> 00:09:40,256
That's nice to know.

121
00:09:55,924 --> 00:09:58,797
Well, in case they're only
playing a three rounder,

122
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,322
it was mighty nice meeting up
with you, Jim Bowie.

123
00:10:02,365 --> 00:10:04,498
Excuse the left hand, Dan'I.

124
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,979
It's been a nice friendship,

125
00:10:07,022 --> 00:10:08,328
if a short one.

126
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:10,330
Yeah, me unconscious

127
00:10:10,373 --> 00:10:12,898
most of the time.

128
00:10:21,776 --> 00:10:23,604
Look yonder, Jim.

129
00:10:29,566 --> 00:10:32,787
It's Quisima, the number one chief.

130
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,703
I'd seen him once in Washington.

131
00:10:35,747 --> 00:10:39,054
He's the one I came out here to see.

132
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:54,853
Does he understand English?

133
00:10:54,896 --> 00:10:56,376
I don't know.

134
00:10:58,857 --> 00:11:00,162
So this is the mighty Quisima,

135
00:11:00,206 --> 00:11:01,860
who sat in the Council of the White Man

136
00:11:01,903 --> 00:11:03,905
in Washington.

137
00:11:03,949 --> 00:11:04,993
This is Quisima,

138
00:11:05,037 --> 00:11:06,995
who gave one hand in friendship

139
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:08,475
to his white brothers,

140
00:11:08,518 --> 00:11:11,086
while the other hand held a knife.

141
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,740
This is Quisima

142
00:11:12,784 --> 00:11:15,830
whose word is shifting as the wind,

143
00:11:15,874 --> 00:11:18,441
whose tongue twists like a river

144
00:11:18,485 --> 00:11:20,269
of many branches.

145
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:23,664
This is Quisima, breaker of treaties.

146
00:11:28,016 --> 00:11:31,106
Today, the Comanche
is held in honor and respect,

147
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,979
like the mountain that never yields

148
00:11:34,022 --> 00:11:36,982
or the sun that never changes.

149
00:11:37,025 --> 00:11:39,549
Tomorrow you will be
driven off like a dog

150
00:11:39,593 --> 00:11:41,464
that wanders close to a campfire

151
00:11:41,508 --> 00:11:45,077
to take his place among men.

152
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,080
White men broke treaty,

153
00:11:48,123 --> 00:11:51,257
went where forbidden to go.

154
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,172
He's a stranger in these parts.

155
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,000
Your men should've come
to him friendly-like

156
00:11:55,043 --> 00:11:56,566
and told him he was trespassing

157
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:57,567
on sacred ground

158
00:11:57,611 --> 00:11:58,960
instead of swooping down on him

159
00:11:59,004 --> 00:12:01,397
like chicken hawks trying to kill him.

160
00:12:01,441 --> 00:12:02,834
I come from the Land of the Naches,

161
00:12:02,877 --> 00:12:04,574
in the Muscogeean, to sit in council

162
00:12:04,618 --> 00:12:06,707
with the mighty Quisima.

163
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,187
If I did not come in friendship,

164
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,580
your three braves would now lie dead.

165
00:13:01,109 --> 00:13:04,460
Comanche honors his treaties.

166
00:13:04,504 --> 00:13:06,941
Hope my white brothers do same

167
00:13:06,985 --> 00:13:09,204
when time comes.

168
00:13:19,301 --> 00:13:21,956
One white brother hurt,

169
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,697
Comanche medicine man

170
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,482
make him well again.

171
00:13:26,526 --> 00:13:28,484
Meantime, white man,

172
00:13:28,528 --> 00:13:32,097
whose tongue is as sharp as his blade,

173
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,142
will teach Quisima

174
00:13:34,186 --> 00:13:37,145
more about his knife.

175
00:13:47,939 --> 00:13:49,984
James Bowie,

176
00:13:50,028 --> 00:13:51,943
if I had your gift of speeching

177
00:13:51,986 --> 00:13:54,249
I'd still be in congress.

178
00:14:59,749 --> 00:15:01,490
It's all right, Jim.

179
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:04,406
My arm being as good as new,
we are pulling out tomorrow.

180
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,452
Well, Quisima, I've kept
my part of the bargain.

181
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,367
In the two weeks we've
been here, I've taught your men

182
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,325
how to make and fight
with my kind of knife.

183
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:12,110
A blade that cuts two ways

184
00:15:12,153 --> 00:15:14,025
has kept his word.

185
00:15:14,068 --> 00:15:16,201
Quisima will keep his

186
00:15:16,244 --> 00:15:19,073
when treaty with white man is renewed,

187
00:15:19,117 --> 00:15:21,032
Bowie, brother of Quisima,

188
00:15:21,075 --> 00:15:22,381
may dig silver ore

189
00:15:22,424 --> 00:15:25,645
that lies beneath land of Comanches.

190
00:15:25,688 --> 00:15:28,039
And the Comanches will get
a good price for it.

191
00:15:28,082 --> 00:15:30,650
As long as campfires burn

192
00:15:30,693 --> 00:15:33,044
before the tents of Comanches,

193
00:15:33,087 --> 00:15:34,697
the blade that cuts two ways

194
00:15:34,741 --> 00:15:38,092
and his friends will be welcome.

195
00:15:51,323 --> 00:15:52,715
I ain't aiming to pry

196
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:54,413
into your private affairs, Jim,

197
00:15:54,456 --> 00:15:58,025
but that silver deal
you made with Quisima...

198
00:15:58,069 --> 00:16:00,462
You're not prying, Dan'l,
since the war of 1812,

199
00:16:00,506 --> 00:16:02,464
the country's been trying
to get back on its feet.

200
00:16:02,508 --> 00:16:04,205
We need that silver to help us do it.

201
00:16:04,249 --> 00:16:06,294
That's why I came out here.

202
00:16:06,338 --> 00:16:07,817
I hate to disappoint you, Jim,

203
00:16:07,861 --> 00:16:10,994
but that treaty ain't
being renewed next week.

204
00:16:11,038 --> 00:16:12,474
You're mistaken.

205
00:16:12,518 --> 00:16:14,476
The renewal was drawn up
when I left the east.

206
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,434
Oh, it was drawn up all right.

207
00:16:15,477 --> 00:16:16,739
But Andy Jackson gave it

208
00:16:16,783 --> 00:16:18,915
to a dimwit named Dan'I Seeger

209
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,179
to give to the Comanches
for ratification.

210
00:16:21,222 --> 00:16:22,789
Well, then, what's wrong?

211
00:16:22,832 --> 00:16:25,705
Remember that bullet
you took out of my shoulder?

212
00:16:25,748 --> 00:16:27,707
Well, a short while
before I run into you,

213
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,448
I was dragged and thieved.

214
00:16:29,491 --> 00:16:32,146
The ornery skunks
took the treaty renewal.

215
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,279
But the president can always
send the Comanches another copy.

216
00:16:34,322 --> 00:16:36,281
Yeah, but it'll be
weeks before they get here.

217
00:16:36,324 --> 00:16:38,021
Meanwhile, folks are pouring
into the territory

218
00:16:38,065 --> 00:16:40,328
by the dozens, just waiting
for the treaty to expire.

219
00:16:40,372 --> 00:16:42,243
Comes the deadline,
they all will be staking claim.

220
00:16:42,287 --> 00:16:43,853
Once they get in here,

221
00:16:43,897 --> 00:16:46,117
it ain't gonna be as easy
to get out of here.

222
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,727
Any idea who might have done it?

223
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,468
Nope, but I'm hoping
I might find out something

224
00:16:49,511 --> 00:16:50,904
when we get to Crooked Tongue.

225
00:16:50,947 --> 00:16:53,167
Don't your remember anything?

226
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:56,736
As a matter of fact,
there was something, Jim.

227
00:16:56,779 --> 00:16:58,564
Just before I passed out,

228
00:16:58,607 --> 00:17:01,349
I got a whiff of fancy perfume.

229
00:17:01,393 --> 00:17:03,090
- Perfume?
- Perfume.

230
00:17:03,134 --> 00:17:04,657
Smelled real good, too.

231
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,354
For a minute,
I thought I was getting mighty

232
00:17:06,398 --> 00:17:08,182
too close to the pearly gates.

233
00:17:08,226 --> 00:17:10,619
Do you know what kind it was?

234
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,230
No, but I'd recollect it

235
00:17:12,273 --> 00:17:13,753
if I ever ran cross it again.

236
00:17:13,796 --> 00:17:15,407
I may not have good brains,

237
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,496
but I sure got a good smeller.

238
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:41,737
Dan'I and I have been
doing some tall thinking

239
00:17:41,781 --> 00:17:44,392
along the way.

240
00:17:44,436 --> 00:17:45,872
Whoever took that treaty
knows for certain

241
00:17:45,915 --> 00:17:47,482
there'll be no renewal next week.

242
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:49,267
- That follows.
- So naturally, you'll expect

243
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,399
to have a lot of silver
to sell in the near future.

244
00:17:51,443 --> 00:17:53,096
- Well, seems logical.
- Well, I'm gonna spread it

245
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,228
around town

246
00:17:54,272 --> 00:17:55,577
I came out here to buy silver,

247
00:17:55,621 --> 00:17:57,188
all I can lay my hands on.

248
00:17:57,231 --> 00:17:58,885
Now, why couldn't I have thunk of that?

249
00:17:58,928 --> 00:18:01,757
The best way to get polecats
is to smoke them out.

250
00:18:01,801 --> 00:18:03,803
Anybody who's ready
to make a deal with you

251
00:18:03,846 --> 00:18:05,370
knows more than he had ought to.

252
00:18:05,413 --> 00:18:07,110
Precisely.

253
00:18:07,154 --> 00:18:08,677
And since you're
evidently known by sight,

254
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:10,766
I suggest we ride into town alone, hmm?

255
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,159
As we used to say in congress,

256
00:18:12,203 --> 00:18:13,595
'The motion is seconded and passed

257
00:18:13,639 --> 00:18:15,945
and the meeting is adjourned.'

258
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,212
Come on, you cow-heels.

259
00:18:21,255 --> 00:18:22,952
Now, put your money down.

260
00:18:22,996 --> 00:18:24,432
Boozer here will take all bets.

261
00:18:24,476 --> 00:18:26,434
Your money or your livestock.

262
00:18:26,478 --> 00:18:29,132
But just see that you make it big.

263
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:31,178
With our luck,
I'm not gonna make this ride

264
00:18:31,222 --> 00:18:33,572
unless you fellas
make it worth my while.

265
00:18:33,615 --> 00:18:35,487
Now let me get this straight, Katie.

266
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:38,316
You're betting you can
take that tray in one hand

267
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:40,622
and ride full gallop
to the end of town...

268
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,537
Stop dead, ride back at full speed,

269
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:43,973
return the tray,

270
00:18:44,017 --> 00:18:46,715
and if one of the glasses is spilled,

271
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:49,240
- I've lost my bet.
- Katie, you've just made

272
00:18:49,283 --> 00:18:50,676
yourself a wager.

273
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:52,460
Do you call that a wager?

274
00:18:52,504 --> 00:18:53,722
Take that trash out of my sight.

275
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:54,941
I don't aim to be insulted

276
00:18:54,984 --> 00:18:57,683
by small bets like that.

277
00:18:57,726 --> 00:18:59,859
Well, come on some man-sized bets

278
00:18:59,902 --> 00:19:01,687
or I'm not going to trouble myself.

279
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:02,644
All right.

280
00:19:02,688 --> 00:19:03,906
There you are.

281
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,386
That's more I like it.

282
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:08,302
- Come on, now. Come on.
- $14, keep going.

283
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,052
Come on now, come on.

284
00:19:26,886 --> 00:19:28,322
All right.

285
00:19:28,366 --> 00:19:30,672
Come on now. Let him do it. Come on.

286
00:19:30,716 --> 00:19:33,240
Come on, put your hands over here.

287
00:19:33,284 --> 00:19:36,330
Come on, Katie. Come on, Katie.

288
00:19:36,374 --> 00:19:37,549
Get away, folks.

289
00:19:37,592 --> 00:19:38,941
Go on, hanging right on to it.

290
00:19:38,985 --> 00:19:41,466
There.

291
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:42,771
- Now, y'all set, Katie?
- All set.

292
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,207
Good lord, there we go.

293
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:45,513
Now, easy does it.

294
00:19:45,557 --> 00:19:46,949
Easy does it.

295
00:19:49,604 --> 00:19:52,520
Don't spill it, I got my money on it.

296
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:30,645
You clumsy ox.

297
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:32,168
I'm terribly sorry.

298
00:20:32,212 --> 00:20:33,431
Blundering fool.

299
00:20:33,474 --> 00:20:34,954
Now, now, miss. I said I was sorry.

300
00:20:34,997 --> 00:20:36,999
It's not nice for a lady
not to be a lady.

301
00:20:37,043 --> 00:20:38,131
Sorry?

302
00:20:38,174 --> 00:20:40,394
He said he's sorry.

303
00:20:40,438 --> 00:20:41,874
You blundering tinhorn,

304
00:20:41,917 --> 00:20:44,093
- you made me lose all my bets.
- Bets?

305
00:20:44,137 --> 00:20:46,182
I didn't know ladies made bets.

306
00:20:46,226 --> 00:20:48,184
You call me a lady once more

307
00:20:48,228 --> 00:20:50,012
and I'll fill you full of lead.

308
00:20:50,056 --> 00:20:51,405
Easy now, miss. The mood you're in,

309
00:20:51,449 --> 00:20:52,928
you're liable to pull that trigger

310
00:20:52,972 --> 00:20:54,626
thereby causing
a most embarrassing situation

311
00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:55,670
for both of us.

312
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:57,977
You did that on purpose.

313
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,153
Look, mister. If the lady wants
to pull a gun on me,

314
00:21:00,196 --> 00:21:01,633
that's quite all right.
Where I come from,

315
00:21:01,676 --> 00:21:03,635
we usually let the ladies
have their way.

316
00:21:03,678 --> 00:21:05,158
But I don't like a man doing it.

317
00:21:05,201 --> 00:21:06,551
Oh, you don't? Now I'm gonna shoot...

318
00:21:06,594 --> 00:21:08,335
- You get out of this.
- But Miss Katie,

319
00:21:08,379 --> 00:21:10,772
- I bet my whole bankroll on you.
- I can take care of this,

320
00:21:10,816 --> 00:21:12,818
this tinhorn without your help.

321
00:21:12,861 --> 00:21:15,168
I've got an idea.
Why don't you two toss a coin

322
00:21:15,211 --> 00:21:17,779
to see who shoots me, huh?

323
00:21:17,823 --> 00:21:20,695
You talk too much.

324
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:22,654
All right, mister.

325
00:21:22,697 --> 00:21:24,133
Draw.

326
00:21:27,136 --> 00:21:29,356
I said draw.

327
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,271
Sorry, ma'am. Back in Louisiana,

328
00:21:31,314 --> 00:21:32,403
when we meet any pretty ladies,

329
00:21:32,446 --> 00:21:33,665
we make love to them,

330
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,144
we kiss them,

331
00:21:35,188 --> 00:21:36,537
spank them on occasion,

332
00:21:36,581 --> 00:21:40,454
but we never go around shooting them.

333
00:21:40,498 --> 00:21:42,543
Are you going to draw or aren't you?

334
00:21:47,069 --> 00:21:49,420
Of all the yellow, spineless,

335
00:21:49,463 --> 00:21:51,813
cowardly coyotes I...

336
00:21:55,164 --> 00:21:57,428
Pay off all bets.

337
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:13,444
Another thing I forgot to mention,

338
00:22:13,487 --> 00:22:14,575
I dislike the sound of someone

339
00:22:14,619 --> 00:22:17,230
cocking a pistol behind my back.

340
00:22:32,506 --> 00:22:33,725
Hello.

341
00:22:33,768 --> 00:22:35,074
Howdy?

342
00:22:35,117 --> 00:22:37,076
I'd like to deposit this bank draft

343
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:38,381
and draw some cash against it.

344
00:22:38,425 --> 00:22:40,427
Oh, sure, sure.

345
00:22:42,734 --> 00:22:44,562
Hmm, $5,000?

346
00:22:44,605 --> 00:22:46,564
You have to take this up with the boss,

347
00:22:46,607 --> 00:22:48,000
in there.

348
00:22:53,222 --> 00:22:55,616
It's all right. Go right in.

349
00:23:13,329 --> 00:23:15,680
Well?

350
00:23:15,723 --> 00:23:18,117
Look, miss, I'm liable
to run out of apologies

351
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,815
if you're following me around
to start trouble again.

352
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:22,295
What do you want to see me about?

353
00:23:22,338 --> 00:23:24,123
I can assure you, miss,
seeing you was the least

354
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:26,560
of my intentions.

355
00:23:26,604 --> 00:23:29,302
I'm waiting to see
the president of the bank.

356
00:23:31,826 --> 00:23:32,914
All right,

357
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:35,264
start talking.

358
00:23:39,225 --> 00:23:40,879
You're not the bank president.

359
00:23:40,922 --> 00:23:44,317
Mister, I am the bank and I'm busy.

360
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,538
Now, what do you want?

361
00:23:47,581 --> 00:23:49,452
I'd like to deposit this draft

362
00:23:49,496 --> 00:23:52,586
and draw some cash against it.

363
00:23:54,283 --> 00:23:57,243
James Bowie, Louisiana.

364
00:23:57,286 --> 00:23:58,766
And now you got the better of me.

365
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,463
I usually like to know
the names of people

366
00:24:00,507 --> 00:24:02,727
- I do business with.
- The name's Kathryn Howard,

367
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:05,643
and we're not doing any business.

368
00:24:05,686 --> 00:24:07,645
Do you mean you're not going
to honor this draft?

369
00:24:07,688 --> 00:24:09,821
That's exactly what I do mean.

370
00:24:09,864 --> 00:24:11,997
I don't like the look of it.

371
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,781
Meaning, you don't like me?

372
00:24:13,825 --> 00:24:15,653
Suit yourself.

373
00:24:15,696 --> 00:24:17,263
I don't like you, mister,

374
00:24:17,306 --> 00:24:19,918
or your bank draft.

375
00:24:19,961 --> 00:24:23,356
But there isn't another bank
within 200 miles.

376
00:24:23,399 --> 00:24:25,271
I'm considered a fairly
wealthy man back east,

377
00:24:25,314 --> 00:24:27,360
but if you refuse to cash this draft,

378
00:24:27,403 --> 00:24:31,016
I might as well be broke.

379
00:24:31,059 --> 00:24:32,670
Now, it does seem to work out

380
00:24:32,713 --> 00:24:34,628
that way, doesn't it?

381
00:24:36,412 --> 00:24:39,415
Thanks for dropping in, Mr. Bowie.

382
00:24:39,459 --> 00:24:40,808
But this is ridiculous.

383
00:24:40,852 --> 00:24:44,029
This is a perfectly legal bank draft.

384
00:24:44,072 --> 00:24:45,596
You can't refuse to recognize

385
00:24:45,639 --> 00:24:47,598
- The Bank of Louisiana.
- I refuse to recognize

386
00:24:47,641 --> 00:24:50,818
the whole State of Louisiana.

387
00:24:50,862 --> 00:24:53,168
Ms. Howard, I've done
a lot of things in my life,

388
00:24:53,212 --> 00:24:55,344
but I've never had
a bank president across my knee

389
00:24:55,388 --> 00:24:56,737
for a good spanking.

390
00:24:56,781 --> 00:24:59,261
That's a pleasure
I shall look forward to.

391
00:24:59,305 --> 00:25:00,741
If you refuse to accept this draft,

392
00:25:00,785 --> 00:25:02,395
I'm sure the gambling casino next door

393
00:25:02,438 --> 00:25:03,701
will be very glad to.

394
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,398
Mr. Bowie.

395
00:25:07,792 --> 00:25:08,706
Let me give you

396
00:25:08,749 --> 00:25:12,361
some friendly advice.

397
00:25:12,405 --> 00:25:14,755
Get out of town. You've already
been here too long.

398
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,018
Very kind of you
to want to be my friend.

399
00:25:17,062 --> 00:25:18,672
Thank you.

400
00:25:18,716 --> 00:25:21,414
We must have dinner together sometime.

401
00:25:29,378 --> 00:25:32,468
Jack. Good

402
00:25:32,512 --> 00:25:34,645
How about you?

403
00:25:34,688 --> 00:25:36,603
- Eight.
- Seven.

404
00:25:36,647 --> 00:25:38,344
- Four.
- Who's in charge around here?

405
00:25:38,387 --> 00:25:39,693
Stacey.

406
00:25:41,739 --> 00:25:44,176
That's him at the end of the bar.

407
00:25:44,219 --> 00:25:48,136
- How about you?
- Yeah.

408
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,486
Excuse me. They tell me
you're in charge around here.

409
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:52,706
- That's right.
- I'd like to cash a draft

410
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,968
drawn on the Bank of Louisiana.

411
00:25:54,012 --> 00:25:55,361
Certainly. How large?

412
00:25:55,404 --> 00:25:56,797
- Five thousand.
- You know, that size,

413
00:25:56,841 --> 00:25:59,974
you have to take it up
with the big boss.

414
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:02,716
And where do I find the big boss?

415
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,631
In the office.

416
00:26:26,305 --> 00:26:29,656
Oh, no.

417
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,614
- It's you again.
- Get to the point, Mister.

418
00:26:31,658 --> 00:26:33,529
This happens to be one of my busy days.

419
00:26:33,573 --> 00:26:34,792
Now, what can I do for you?

420
00:26:34,835 --> 00:26:37,403
Oh, I've seen everything.

421
00:26:37,446 --> 00:26:39,666
I have no time for small talk,
Mr. Bowie.

422
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:42,103
But if this is a social call, I--

423
00:26:42,147 --> 00:26:43,452
No, not at all.

424
00:26:43,496 --> 00:26:44,889
Ms. Howard, I have in my possession

425
00:26:44,932 --> 00:26:46,804
a draft drawn on the bank--

426
00:26:49,328 --> 00:26:51,373
oh, what's the use?

427
00:26:51,417 --> 00:26:53,767
Look, I need cash.

428
00:26:53,811 --> 00:26:55,856
I'll make you a sporting proposition.

429
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,119
I'm not a gambler,
but evidently you are.

430
00:26:58,163 --> 00:27:01,166
One cut of the cards for five thousand.

431
00:27:06,127 --> 00:27:08,434
You've made yourself a bet, Mr. Bowie.

432
00:27:08,477 --> 00:27:09,740
Come on.

433
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:18,836
We're breaking in for one hand
of high card, Slim.

434
00:27:18,879 --> 00:27:20,359
That's all, boys. Pick up your chips.

435
00:27:22,404 --> 00:27:24,363
Give me 5,000.

436
00:27:24,406 --> 00:27:25,799
Five thousand one hand?

437
00:27:25,843 --> 00:27:29,672
You ask too many questions.

438
00:27:29,716 --> 00:27:31,587
Cash if you don't mind.

439
00:27:38,638 --> 00:27:40,945
Mind if I have a look at those cards?

440
00:27:48,213 --> 00:27:50,389
- Why you little...
- That's all right, Slim.

441
00:27:50,432 --> 00:27:53,740
Mr. Bowie has a peculiar
sense of humor.

442
00:27:56,743 --> 00:27:57,962
Why don't you shuffle them, too?

443
00:27:58,005 --> 00:27:59,572
Well, it's not necessary.

444
00:27:59,615 --> 00:28:02,314
After all, we do trust
each other, don't we?

445
00:28:10,104 --> 00:28:11,758
Ladies first.

446
00:28:11,802 --> 00:28:14,282
Oh, I forgot, you don't like
to be called a lady

447
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:16,632
or dress like one either.

448
00:28:19,722 --> 00:28:23,509
An eight.

449
00:28:23,552 --> 00:28:26,251
Four.

450
00:28:26,294 --> 00:28:27,643
Your money, Mr. Bowie.

451
00:28:27,687 --> 00:28:29,210
I believe I mentioned before,

452
00:28:29,254 --> 00:28:31,256
I don't gamble, Ms. Howard.

453
00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:32,953
You can have the draft.

454
00:28:32,997 --> 00:28:34,868
That'll keep it from being gambling.

455
00:28:34,912 --> 00:28:36,739
Now, look, Mr. Bowie, if that's a bet,

456
00:28:36,783 --> 00:28:40,395
I don't think you meant that
to be an insult or did you?

457
00:28:40,439 --> 00:28:43,834
I never insult anyone with $5,000,

458
00:28:43,877 --> 00:28:45,836
especially a lady.

459
00:29:07,466 --> 00:29:08,423
What'll it be?

460
00:29:08,467 --> 00:29:09,947
That'll be all right.

461
00:29:15,343 --> 00:29:17,650
Any kind of will do.

462
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:26,615
Jim, I've have smelled
half the people in town,

463
00:29:26,659 --> 00:29:29,444
and believe me, there are no lilies.

464
00:29:29,488 --> 00:29:31,446
I've smelled polecat and sheepherder

465
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:33,274
and about a dozen assorted smells

466
00:29:33,318 --> 00:29:34,928
I haven't classified as yet.

467
00:29:34,972 --> 00:29:36,364
Any trace of that perfume?

468
00:29:36,408 --> 00:29:38,889
Not a whiff, but I'll keep on smelling

469
00:29:38,932 --> 00:29:42,196
until my smeller gives up.

470
00:29:52,946 --> 00:29:55,253
I'm sorry you had trouble
with the boss.

471
00:29:55,296 --> 00:29:57,472
If she'd known who Jim Bowie was,

472
00:29:57,516 --> 00:29:59,779
I'm sure she would have been
more courteous.

473
00:29:59,822 --> 00:30:01,346
I can't imagine that female tiger,

474
00:30:01,389 --> 00:30:02,695
if she is a female,

475
00:30:02,738 --> 00:30:04,349
being courteous
under any circumstances.

476
00:30:04,392 --> 00:30:06,394
Oh, Katie's really
a nice person, Mr. Bowie,

477
00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:07,874
when you get to know her better.

478
00:30:07,918 --> 00:30:09,789
Getting to know her better
is one ordeal

479
00:30:09,832 --> 00:30:11,095
I'm hoping to spare myself.

480
00:30:11,138 --> 00:30:12,357
Can I buy you a drink?

481
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,794
- Thanks.
- Boozer.

482
00:30:14,837 --> 00:30:16,796
So far, all the friends
I've made in this town

483
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:18,885
- add up to zero.
- Well, your entrance into town

484
00:30:18,929 --> 00:30:22,933
wasn't exactly conducive
to making friends.

485
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:25,413
You know, I spent most
of my life in the east.

486
00:30:25,457 --> 00:30:26,980
That's where I first heard of Jim Bowie

487
00:30:27,024 --> 00:30:28,851
and his fabulous knife.

488
00:30:28,895 --> 00:30:31,724
I hear tell it's a deadly man killer.

489
00:30:31,767 --> 00:30:33,769
It's a hunting knife.

490
00:30:33,813 --> 00:30:35,206
Sorry.

491
00:30:35,249 --> 00:30:37,991
You're in sugar, aren't you?

492
00:30:38,035 --> 00:30:40,776
Used to be.

493
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,083
We don't grow much sugar
in these parts.

494
00:30:43,127 --> 00:30:44,998
No, but I understand
you're expecting a fine

495
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:46,913
crop of silver very soon.

496
00:30:46,957 --> 00:30:49,698
Thinking of staking your claim
in Comanche Territory?

497
00:30:49,742 --> 00:30:51,874
I'm leaving the claim taking to others.

498
00:30:51,918 --> 00:30:54,965
I'm buying silver. All I can get.

499
00:30:55,008 --> 00:30:56,879
That's very interesting, Mr. Bowie.

500
00:30:56,923 --> 00:30:59,230
If I hear of anyone
with silver to sell,

501
00:30:59,273 --> 00:31:01,232
I'll pass the word along.

502
00:31:19,859 --> 00:31:23,123
Well, if it ain't Ms. Katie Howard.

503
00:31:23,167 --> 00:31:24,559
Lucky for you, Lem,

504
00:31:24,603 --> 00:31:25,996
I can't tote any guns in this outfit.

505
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:27,127
What are you rigged up for, Katie,

506
00:31:27,171 --> 00:31:28,999
a wedding or a funeral?

507
00:31:29,042 --> 00:31:31,784
Wait until you see the dress
I wear the day we bury you.

508
00:31:34,961 --> 00:31:36,397
All right, boys.

509
00:31:52,109 --> 00:31:55,068
When Katie goes feminine,
somebody better watch out.

510
00:31:57,244 --> 00:32:00,552
Still wondering if the tiger is female?

511
00:32:00,595 --> 00:32:02,641
Not anymore.

512
00:32:04,904 --> 00:32:06,384
I'm raising 10 more.

513
00:32:06,427 --> 00:32:08,603
No bet.

514
00:32:08,647 --> 00:32:09,691
What's the idea?

515
00:32:09,735 --> 00:32:11,215
I thought I told you card sharks

516
00:32:11,258 --> 00:32:12,172
to keep out of my place.

517
00:32:12,216 --> 00:32:13,260
- Now get.
- But I--

518
00:32:13,304 --> 00:32:14,827
Go on.

519
00:32:27,796 --> 00:32:29,755
Mighty affectionate for a man your age.

520
00:32:29,798 --> 00:32:33,237
It ain't affection. It's that perfume.

521
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,934
Well, if it's going
to affect people like that,

522
00:32:34,977 --> 00:32:36,675
I better not use it anymore.

523
00:32:36,718 --> 00:32:39,634
All right, miss, where is the treaty?

524
00:32:39,678 --> 00:32:41,288
- Treaty?
- The treaty with the Comanches.

525
00:32:41,332 --> 00:32:42,594
The one you took from me.

526
00:32:42,637 --> 00:32:44,117
What have you done with it?

527
00:32:44,161 --> 00:32:45,858
I don't know what you're talking about.

528
00:32:45,901 --> 00:32:47,686
That treaty was a property
of the federal government

529
00:32:47,729 --> 00:32:49,253
and I aim to get it back.

530
00:32:59,915 --> 00:33:01,134
I'm sorry, Ms. Katie.

531
00:33:01,178 --> 00:33:03,267
Why you clumsy mutt.

532
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,705
Hey, someone get me out of here.

533
00:33:50,749 --> 00:33:53,099
Someone get me out of here.

534
00:33:54,796 --> 00:33:58,452
I promised myself this
pleasure, Ms. Bank President.

535
00:33:58,496 --> 00:34:00,193
- Ow.
- That's for not cashing

536
00:34:00,237 --> 00:34:01,499
my draft.

537
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:04,328
I'll kill you when I get out of here.

538
00:34:04,371 --> 00:34:06,112
Ow.

539
00:34:06,156 --> 00:34:09,028
That's for giving me so much trouble.

540
00:34:20,735 --> 00:34:23,390
Throw these two gentlemen out of here.

541
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:37,099
Well, I hope you know
what you're doing.

542
00:34:37,143 --> 00:34:38,884
You bet I do.

543
00:34:38,927 --> 00:34:41,191
You know, people don't toss
Jim Bowie around like that

544
00:34:41,234 --> 00:34:42,931
- and get away with it.
- I'll take my chances

545
00:34:42,975 --> 00:34:44,455
whoever he is.

546
00:34:44,498 --> 00:34:46,196
For your information,
he's a very wealthy man.

547
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,763
- He's in town to buy silver.
- So what?

548
00:34:48,807 --> 00:34:50,939
A Comanche silver is no good
to us if we don't get someone

549
00:34:50,983 --> 00:34:52,985
- to take it off our hands.
- There'll be other buyers.

550
00:34:53,028 --> 00:34:55,292
Sure, maybe in a few months?

551
00:34:55,335 --> 00:34:57,337
But we can use Jim Bowie now.

552
00:34:57,381 --> 00:34:59,209
If you don't want all our plans
to fall through,

553
00:34:59,252 --> 00:35:00,732
you'd better go after him.

554
00:35:00,775 --> 00:35:03,038
See if you can repair
the damage you've done.

555
00:35:03,082 --> 00:35:04,736
Me go crawling to him?

556
00:35:04,779 --> 00:35:07,260
I'd rather die first.

557
00:35:07,304 --> 00:35:10,045
I'm not asking you, Katie.

558
00:35:10,089 --> 00:35:11,699
I'm telling you.

559
00:35:32,503 --> 00:35:33,808
Eh, it's no use, Jim.

560
00:35:33,852 --> 00:35:35,810
I'll never learn to keep my mouth shut.

561
00:35:35,854 --> 00:35:38,160
If I had, I'd still be in Congress.

562
00:35:38,204 --> 00:35:39,814
You never struck me as the kind of man

563
00:35:39,858 --> 00:35:41,468
that goes around kissing strange girls

564
00:35:41,512 --> 00:35:43,296
in the shoulder

565
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,645
and in one drink, too.

566
00:35:44,689 --> 00:35:48,475
I wasn't kissing, I was whiffing.

567
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:50,912
And I got me a nose
full of that perfume.

568
00:35:50,956 --> 00:35:52,305
- Ms. Howard?
- Uh-hmm.

569
00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:53,959
Instead of saying nothing,
playing possum,

570
00:35:54,002 --> 00:35:56,004
I had to raise a fuss
and get us thrown out.

571
00:35:56,048 --> 00:35:59,138
Now, we can't get back in there
to snoop around.

572
00:36:00,618 --> 00:36:03,577
I'm not so sure of that, Dan'l.

573
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,930
I came out to tell you
that I was sorry.

574
00:36:08,974 --> 00:36:11,281
I want to apologize.

575
00:36:11,324 --> 00:36:12,456
Well, this is a surprise.

576
00:36:12,499 --> 00:36:15,110
It is to me, too.

577
00:36:15,154 --> 00:36:18,070
I mean, we try to run
a respectable place

578
00:36:18,113 --> 00:36:20,725
and if your friend here
hadn't started all the trouble--

579
00:36:20,768 --> 00:36:21,943
He's no friend of mine.

580
00:36:21,987 --> 00:36:24,468
I never saw him before.

581
00:36:24,511 --> 00:36:26,296
Well, you were trying to help him.

582
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:27,862
Just a case of helping the underdog,

583
00:36:27,906 --> 00:36:30,038
too many against one.

584
00:36:30,082 --> 00:36:32,476
I reckon I could take the blame
for that little fracas, miss.

585
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:34,695
You see, I met up with
an accident awhile back

586
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:37,219
and I've been kind of
getting funny spells ever since,

587
00:36:37,263 --> 00:36:42,137
you know, imagining
all sorts of funny things.

588
00:36:42,181 --> 00:36:45,924
I'm sorry if I caused you
any trouble, stranger.

589
00:36:49,928 --> 00:36:53,801
Um, I hope we can consider all this

590
00:36:53,845 --> 00:36:55,977
a misunderstanding, Mr. Bowie.

591
00:36:56,021 --> 00:36:57,718
I'm sure that's all it was, Ms. Howard.

592
00:36:57,762 --> 00:37:00,373
Oh, that's very kind of you to say so.

593
00:37:00,417 --> 00:37:02,854
If you're not holding any grudges,

594
00:37:02,897 --> 00:37:05,030
I--I'd like to offer you a drink.

595
00:37:05,073 --> 00:37:06,640
Well, the offer is gratefully accepted.

596
00:37:06,684 --> 00:37:08,338
Providing of course
I'm still welcome inside.

597
00:37:08,381 --> 00:37:11,645
Oh, of course, Mr. Bowie.

598
00:37:11,689 --> 00:37:13,430
And again,

599
00:37:13,473 --> 00:37:15,649
my deepest apologies.

600
00:37:15,693 --> 00:37:16,868
Not at all, Ms. Howard.

601
00:37:16,911 --> 00:37:18,348
My apologies to you.

602
00:37:18,391 --> 00:37:19,740
Oh.

603
00:37:25,703 --> 00:37:27,444
Well, I'll be...

604
00:37:27,487 --> 00:37:29,402
hogswalled.

605
00:37:29,446 --> 00:37:31,056
How about this table, Mr. Bowie.

606
00:37:31,099 --> 00:37:32,362
Splendid.

607
00:37:32,405 --> 00:37:34,320
You can see everything from here.

608
00:37:34,364 --> 00:37:36,757
And nobody can get behind me.

609
00:37:36,801 --> 00:37:39,020
Oh, now, Mr. Bowie.

610
00:37:39,064 --> 00:37:41,371
Boozer,

611
00:37:41,414 --> 00:37:44,025
see that Mr. Bowie
has anything he wants.

612
00:37:44,069 --> 00:37:45,505
But, Ms. Katie, I think he's just a--

613
00:37:45,549 --> 00:37:47,028
You're not paid to think.

614
00:37:47,072 --> 00:37:48,943
Mr. Bowie is a guest of mine.

615
00:37:48,987 --> 00:37:51,903
Give him the best in the house.

616
00:37:51,946 --> 00:37:54,688
Oh, by the way,
have you made any arrangements

617
00:37:54,732 --> 00:37:56,342
- for your lodgings?
- No, not yet.

618
00:37:56,386 --> 00:37:57,561
Well, then it's all settled.

619
00:37:57,604 --> 00:37:59,127
You'll stay at my ranch.

620
00:37:59,171 --> 00:38:01,608
That's very gracious of you,
Ms. Howard.

621
00:38:01,652 --> 00:38:03,958
Oh, not at all, Mr. Bowie.

622
00:38:40,691 --> 00:38:41,953
You know, I had no idea

623
00:38:41,996 --> 00:38:43,781
Stacey was your brother.

624
00:38:43,824 --> 00:38:45,478
You didn't?

625
00:38:45,522 --> 00:38:47,306
He told me when I got to
know you better,

626
00:38:47,349 --> 00:38:49,090
I'd get to like you,

627
00:38:49,134 --> 00:38:50,614
and I believe he was right.

628
00:38:50,657 --> 00:38:51,876
Oh?

629
00:38:51,919 --> 00:38:53,486
So, in two days, you think

630
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,053
you're beginning to know me?

631
00:38:55,096 --> 00:38:57,098
At least I'm beginning to like you.

632
00:38:57,142 --> 00:38:58,317
Oh.

633
00:39:05,411 --> 00:39:06,978
Come.

634
00:39:07,021 --> 00:39:08,806
I thought the Comanche
had a peace treaty

635
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:09,981
with his white brothers.

636
00:39:10,024 --> 00:39:11,983
Come.

637
00:39:14,072 --> 00:39:16,378
It seems that's his entire vocabulary.

638
00:39:16,422 --> 00:39:17,771
I think we better go with him.

639
00:39:36,311 --> 00:39:38,139
Why are we brought here like this?

640
00:39:38,183 --> 00:39:39,619
Quisima breaks his word
to keep the peace

641
00:39:39,663 --> 00:39:40,664
with the white man.

642
00:39:40,707 --> 00:39:42,970
Quisima keeps his word.

643
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:44,276
Want to know if white men

644
00:39:44,319 --> 00:39:46,757
will keep theirs.

645
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,628
A blade that cuts two ways

646
00:39:48,672 --> 00:39:49,890
will sit in council

647
00:39:49,934 --> 00:39:51,196
of Comanches.

648
00:40:55,434 --> 00:40:57,610
Pakanah.

649
00:41:05,052 --> 00:41:07,098
This is Pakanah,

650
00:41:07,141 --> 00:41:08,578
my son.

651
00:41:08,621 --> 00:41:10,405
He lived with white man.

652
00:41:10,449 --> 00:41:13,060
He tell you when your tongue message

653
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:15,454
is given to us.

654
00:41:17,282 --> 00:41:18,892
White man like bird

655
00:41:18,936 --> 00:41:21,025
that makes sweet music

656
00:41:21,068 --> 00:41:24,245
but rob nest of others.

657
00:41:24,289 --> 00:41:26,987
He promised Comanche peace

658
00:41:27,031 --> 00:41:29,511
while hand reaches for a gun

659
00:41:29,555 --> 00:41:31,992
to slay him.

660
00:41:32,036 --> 00:41:33,690
Every day,

661
00:41:33,733 --> 00:41:35,648
we see white man

662
00:41:35,692 --> 00:41:37,084
come across plain

663
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:40,522
from direction of morning sun.

664
00:41:40,566 --> 00:41:43,264
He bring tools with him,

665
00:41:43,308 --> 00:41:46,093
not for planting of corn,

666
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:49,923
but for digging of silver.

667
00:41:49,967 --> 00:41:51,011
White man

668
00:41:51,055 --> 00:41:54,058
plan to betray Comanche.

669
00:41:54,101 --> 00:41:56,669
He will take his land.

670
00:41:56,713 --> 00:42:00,455
There will be no new treaty.

671
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:04,416
Each day Comanche wait,

672
00:42:04,459 --> 00:42:08,115
white man becomes stronger.

673
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:11,205
Comanche must strike

674
00:42:11,249 --> 00:42:15,079
at once tonight.

675
00:42:15,122 --> 00:42:18,865
Council agrees with Pakanah.

676
00:42:18,909 --> 00:42:20,737
But I told them,

677
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,695
'My brother, Bowie,

678
00:42:22,739 --> 00:42:24,088
man of honor.

679
00:42:24,131 --> 00:42:26,656
He not lie.'

680
00:42:26,699 --> 00:42:28,135
If he tell me

681
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:30,834
white man renew treaty,

682
00:42:30,877 --> 00:42:34,620
Quisima believe him.

683
00:42:37,144 --> 00:42:39,364
What do you think, Ms. Howard?

684
00:42:39,407 --> 00:42:41,496
I...

685
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,368
I don't know.

686
00:42:46,327 --> 00:42:49,330
I pledge my word of honor, Quisima,

687
00:42:49,374 --> 00:42:50,897
that the treaty
has already been renewed

688
00:42:50,941 --> 00:42:52,551
and has been sent on its way here

689
00:42:52,594 --> 00:42:53,552
from Washington.

690
00:42:53,595 --> 00:42:55,249
White man has false tongue.

691
00:43:04,171 --> 00:43:05,607
I don't blame you

692
00:43:05,651 --> 00:43:06,913
for being angry, Pakanah,

693
00:43:06,957 --> 00:43:08,698
but I don't like to be called a liar.

694
00:43:08,741 --> 00:43:10,264
White man lie.

695
00:43:10,308 --> 00:43:12,614
I make him admit.

696
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,531
If that's the way you want it.

697
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:19,621
Not with your weapons,

698
00:43:19,665 --> 00:43:21,319
with ours.

699
00:43:24,235 --> 00:43:25,976
Each to his own.

700
00:43:29,414 --> 00:43:30,720
Please don't.

701
00:43:30,763 --> 00:43:32,722
You won't stand a chance.

702
00:43:34,462 --> 00:43:36,769
Then why don't you stop it?

703
00:43:36,813 --> 00:43:37,857
You know there's a new treaty

704
00:43:37,901 --> 00:43:40,381
and you know who took it.

705
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,994
I can't.

706
00:43:44,037 --> 00:43:45,604
Then I've got to fight him

707
00:43:45,647 --> 00:43:47,214
or every Comanche in the territory

708
00:43:47,258 --> 00:43:50,174
will be on the warpath before morning.

709
00:44:04,884 --> 00:44:07,626
I wish you'd change your mind, Pakanah.

710
00:44:09,149 --> 00:44:11,456
I don't wanna kill you.

711
00:44:11,499 --> 00:44:13,806
I want kill you.

712
00:45:00,766 --> 00:45:02,028
I told the truth.

713
00:45:02,072 --> 00:45:04,117
I told the truth.

714
00:45:04,161 --> 00:45:07,033
White man tell truth.

715
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:32,798
You think I want that silver

716
00:45:32,842 --> 00:45:34,713
for myself, don't you?

717
00:45:34,756 --> 00:45:36,062
Well, you're wrong.

718
00:45:36,106 --> 00:45:37,455
I have my reasons, good reasons,

719
00:45:37,498 --> 00:45:40,327
but they wouldn't mean anything to you.

720
00:45:40,371 --> 00:45:41,415
Maybe they would.

721
00:45:41,459 --> 00:45:43,635
Not to an Easterner.

722
00:45:43,678 --> 00:45:45,855
You would have to be a part of that

723
00:45:45,898 --> 00:45:47,465
to understand

724
00:45:47,508 --> 00:45:50,294
and that would have to be
a part of you.

725
00:45:51,556 --> 00:45:52,644
My father and grandfather

726
00:45:52,687 --> 00:45:54,733
came out here to try

727
00:45:54,776 --> 00:45:56,996
and make something
out of that wilderness

728
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,911
and they died trying.

729
00:45:58,955 --> 00:46:00,304
They brought
all their friends with them

730
00:46:00,347 --> 00:46:02,175
and everyone who'd listen.

731
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:05,613
Go on.

732
00:46:08,094 --> 00:46:10,662
But things didn't work out
the way they expected them.

733
00:46:10,705 --> 00:46:12,229
They raised cattle,

734
00:46:12,272 --> 00:46:13,708
but there was no way to get them

735
00:46:13,752 --> 00:46:15,972
to the eastern markets.

736
00:46:16,015 --> 00:46:17,408
People began to get discouraged.

737
00:46:17,451 --> 00:46:19,192
Lately things have been getting worse.

738
00:46:19,236 --> 00:46:22,065
A lot of families have left
the territory and gone back.

739
00:46:22,108 --> 00:46:23,457
And you think that Comanche silver

740
00:46:23,501 --> 00:46:24,545
will keep them from leaving,

741
00:46:24,589 --> 00:46:25,590
is that it?

742
00:46:25,633 --> 00:46:26,721
Yes, that's it.

743
00:46:26,765 --> 00:46:27,766
Once they stake claims,

744
00:46:27,809 --> 00:46:28,898
they'd have to stay here.

745
00:46:28,941 --> 00:46:30,247
And no one, the Indians

746
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:31,770
and the federal government included,

747
00:46:31,813 --> 00:46:33,076
is going to stop us.

748
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,513
That's mighty big talk, Ms. Howard.

749
00:46:35,556 --> 00:46:38,385
Well, that's the way
we feel about it, all of us,

750
00:46:38,429 --> 00:46:40,518
even my brother Stacey.

751
00:46:42,302 --> 00:46:43,608
Of all the upside down,

752
00:46:43,651 --> 00:46:45,001
back into,

753
00:46:45,044 --> 00:46:46,480
mule-headed, illogical,

754
00:46:46,524 --> 00:46:48,526
irrational feminine reasoning.

755
00:46:48,569 --> 00:46:51,485
You saw the mood
those Comanches are in.

756
00:46:51,529 --> 00:46:53,531
Do you think for one moment
the shooting stop

757
00:46:53,574 --> 00:46:55,011
with that one rifle ball I took out

758
00:46:55,054 --> 00:46:56,447
of Dan'I Seeger's shoulder?

759
00:46:56,490 --> 00:46:59,667
I'm sorry about that.

760
00:46:59,711 --> 00:47:01,756
There wasn't supposed to be a shooting

761
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,237
but the men with me
were pretty desperate.

762
00:47:04,281 --> 00:47:06,413
- Somebody slipped up.
- And they'll slip up again

763
00:47:06,457 --> 00:47:09,025
if they try to jump Indian land.

764
00:47:09,068 --> 00:47:10,983
Quisima has already given
the government permission

765
00:47:11,027 --> 00:47:12,593
to dig for their silver.

766
00:47:15,161 --> 00:47:17,076
That's mighty fine for the government,

767
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,252
but it doesn't do us any good.

768
00:47:19,296 --> 00:47:21,951
Listen, Ms. Howard,

769
00:47:21,994 --> 00:47:23,865
your desire to improve this territory

770
00:47:23,909 --> 00:47:26,433
is most commendable,
but you're going about it

771
00:47:26,477 --> 00:47:27,652
in the wrong way.

772
00:47:27,695 --> 00:47:29,871
Don't you understand?

773
00:47:29,915 --> 00:47:32,091
The country needs this silver.

774
00:47:32,135 --> 00:47:33,745
They'll make a road out here.

775
00:47:33,788 --> 00:47:35,790
Wagon trains will be rolling
in and out of here.

776
00:47:35,834 --> 00:47:37,009
People who left will be coming back

777
00:47:37,053 --> 00:47:38,663
and hundreds more.

778
00:47:38,706 --> 00:47:40,491
Besides, this territory
will be bigger than anything

779
00:47:40,534 --> 00:47:42,797
your father or grandfather
ever dreamed of.

780
00:47:44,364 --> 00:47:45,844
You really believe that?

781
00:47:45,887 --> 00:47:48,194
Believe that? I know it.

782
00:47:52,982 --> 00:47:54,853
So you're calling off the deal, Katie?

783
00:47:54,896 --> 00:47:55,941
All our plans,

784
00:47:55,985 --> 00:47:56,986
everything we've worked for?

785
00:47:57,029 --> 00:47:58,596
Not unless you agree, Stacey,

786
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:01,512
after all, that's your problem
as much as mine.

787
00:48:03,688 --> 00:48:04,645
Oh, anything you say

788
00:48:04,689 --> 00:48:05,690
is all right with me,

789
00:48:05,733 --> 00:48:06,952
you know that.

790
00:48:06,996 --> 00:48:08,388
Since we only have three days left,

791
00:48:08,432 --> 00:48:09,824
I suggest we get the treaty to Quisima

792
00:48:09,868 --> 00:48:11,565
as quickly as possible.

793
00:48:11,609 --> 00:48:13,698
I didn't know there'd would be
a change in plans.

794
00:48:13,741 --> 00:48:15,178
I destroyed it.

795
00:48:15,221 --> 00:48:16,918
I'm sorry.

796
00:48:18,224 --> 00:48:19,660
Well, no harm done.

797
00:48:19,704 --> 00:48:20,618
You two confess the word out

798
00:48:20,661 --> 00:48:22,228
that there is a new treaty

799
00:48:22,272 --> 00:48:24,187
and nobody is to try moving in
on the Comanches.

800
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:25,405
That'll protect us till Andy Jackson

801
00:48:25,449 --> 00:48:27,016
can send along a new copy.

802
00:48:27,059 --> 00:48:29,322
Yeah, I'm afraid that won't work, Jim.

803
00:48:29,366 --> 00:48:30,932
A lot of newcomers pulled up stakes

804
00:48:30,976 --> 00:48:33,109
and came out here just to get in
on the silver rush.

805
00:48:33,152 --> 00:48:35,285
They're not gonna be
in a listening mood.

806
00:48:36,721 --> 00:48:38,592
I found out when I was in
business back East

807
00:48:38,636 --> 00:48:39,854
that usually the best way

808
00:48:39,898 --> 00:48:40,899
to handle a stubborn customer

809
00:48:40,942 --> 00:48:42,292
was to get a couple of drinks

810
00:48:42,335 --> 00:48:43,684
and a good meal under his belt,

811
00:48:43,728 --> 00:48:45,295
then he'd usually listen to reason.

812
00:48:45,338 --> 00:48:46,687
We're gonna throw the biggest shindig

813
00:48:46,731 --> 00:48:47,906
this territory's ever known.

814
00:48:47,949 --> 00:48:49,864
We'd throw the cafe wide open

815
00:48:49,908 --> 00:48:51,736
and wine them and dine them
until they're ready to listen.

816
00:48:51,779 --> 00:48:53,999
And just in case a few of them
don't see the light,

817
00:48:54,043 --> 00:48:55,305
I suggest we take their guns away

818
00:48:55,348 --> 00:48:56,915
before they come in.

819
00:49:01,006 --> 00:49:02,007
What's the matter, Tom?

820
00:49:02,051 --> 00:49:03,574
Comanches making trouble?

821
00:49:03,617 --> 00:49:06,055
Heck no, get down
to Crooked Tongue today.

822
00:49:06,098 --> 00:49:08,100
Free fills and plenty of liquor.

823
00:49:08,144 --> 00:49:09,188
Katie Howard's throwing a shindig,

824
00:49:09,232 --> 00:49:10,755
- you better hurry.
- Yeah?

825
00:49:10,798 --> 00:49:12,626
I guess I better get home
and change my duds.

826
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:14,585
Come on.

827
00:49:14,628 --> 00:49:16,935
Hey, stop everything.

828
00:49:16,978 --> 00:49:18,328
Katie Howard's throwing a party.

829
00:49:18,371 --> 00:49:21,244
Free fills and liquor for everybody.

830
00:49:27,554 --> 00:49:29,339
Are you sure there ain't no
charge for this?

831
00:49:29,382 --> 00:49:32,342
Everything is free.

832
00:49:32,385 --> 00:49:34,735
Well, in that case, thanks.

833
00:49:38,739 --> 00:49:39,827
Here now.

834
00:49:39,871 --> 00:49:42,308
We don't have none of that.

835
00:49:51,404 --> 00:49:52,753
I like your neighbors, Katie.

836
00:49:52,797 --> 00:49:53,798
They're nice, friendly people.

837
00:49:53,841 --> 00:49:55,147
I sure hope they stay that way

838
00:49:55,191 --> 00:49:56,801
after we bust the news to them.

839
00:49:56,844 --> 00:49:58,368
Well, I don't expect any trouble

840
00:49:58,411 --> 00:50:00,152
with the old timers,

841
00:50:00,196 --> 00:50:01,980
but there's a lot of newcomers
around here

842
00:50:02,023 --> 00:50:03,460
that I've never seen before.

843
00:50:03,503 --> 00:50:05,853
Hello. Jed.

844
00:50:05,897 --> 00:50:07,768
Oh, excuse me.

845
00:50:07,812 --> 00:50:09,640
- Hello, Sue, hello, Jed.
- Hello.

846
00:50:09,683 --> 00:50:11,076
I'm sure glad you could make it.

847
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,383
I wouldn't miss this on a bet, Katie.

848
00:50:13,426 --> 00:50:15,167
- What's all this all here?
- Oh, sorry, Jed,

849
00:50:15,211 --> 00:50:16,690
everyone is checking their guns.

850
00:50:16,734 --> 00:50:18,388
Fair enough.

851
00:50:28,398 --> 00:50:30,487
Sure is a pretty girl.

852
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:32,010
Sure is.

853
00:50:32,053 --> 00:50:33,751
Too bad she's always wearing buckskin,

854
00:50:33,794 --> 00:50:35,405
keeping her figure covered.

855
00:50:35,448 --> 00:50:37,798
At your age, Dan'I,
you shouldn't be looking.

856
00:50:37,842 --> 00:50:40,801
I ain't seen much else to do.

857
00:50:45,241 --> 00:50:46,720
Uh-oh.

858
00:50:46,764 --> 00:50:49,114
We're just talking about you,
Ms. Katie.

859
00:50:49,158 --> 00:50:51,377
Jim here was saying
if I'd help keep an eye

860
00:50:51,421 --> 00:50:53,466
on the weapons,
he'd sure like to ask you

861
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:54,946
for a dance.

862
00:50:54,989 --> 00:50:56,513
And what did you say, Mr. Seeger?

863
00:50:56,556 --> 00:50:58,558
I said I'd be delighted.

864
00:50:58,602 --> 00:51:00,821
On the contrary, Mr. Seeger,

865
00:51:00,865 --> 00:51:02,954
I'd be delighted.

Uh-oh. I'm sorry, boys,
but you have to leave

912
00:53:34,627 --> 00:53:35,541
your shooting guns here.

913
00:53:35,585 --> 00:53:36,368
Who said so?

914
00:53:36,412 --> 00:53:37,935
Ms. Howard.

915
00:53:37,978 --> 00:53:39,850
Yeah? Well, nobody's taking my gun.

916
00:53:39,893 --> 00:53:41,155
Well, then, you can't go in.

917
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:44,115
Well, why don't you try to stop us?

918
00:53:44,158 --> 00:53:46,335
I got that one from the Iroquois.

919
00:53:47,945 --> 00:53:49,729
The Iroquois taught me that one.

920
00:53:57,084 --> 00:53:59,391
I better tell them now.

921
00:53:59,435 --> 00:54:01,785
I'll take a couple of these.

922
00:54:09,488 --> 00:54:10,924
This is as good a time as any

923
00:54:10,968 --> 00:54:13,449
to make a little announcement.

924
00:54:13,492 --> 00:54:15,668
There's a new treaty with the Comanches

925
00:54:15,712 --> 00:54:16,843
and it'll be here from Washington

926
00:54:16,887 --> 00:54:18,105
in a few days.

927
00:54:18,149 --> 00:54:20,369
That means that you can all forget

928
00:54:20,412 --> 00:54:22,458
that midnight deadline tomorrow.

929
00:54:22,501 --> 00:54:24,024
Nobody is moving in

930
00:54:24,068 --> 00:54:26,592
on Comanche territory, nobody.

931
00:54:26,636 --> 00:54:27,985
You can do whatever you like, lady,

932
00:54:28,028 --> 00:54:29,508
but I'm moving in.

933
00:54:29,552 --> 00:54:31,423
If any of you newcomers feel
like arguing,

934
00:54:31,467 --> 00:54:34,383
I've got a couple of good
arguments right here.

935
00:54:36,167 --> 00:54:37,255
You old timers

936
00:54:37,298 --> 00:54:38,256
know how my folks felt

937
00:54:38,299 --> 00:54:39,562
about this territory

938
00:54:39,605 --> 00:54:41,041
and how I feel about it,

939
00:54:41,085 --> 00:54:44,175
and I'm not going to let it break up.

940
00:54:44,218 --> 00:54:46,699
That silver is going to be mined,

941
00:54:46,743 --> 00:54:48,571
but it'll be done legally

942
00:54:48,614 --> 00:54:50,399
and there'll be plenty of work
for everybody

943
00:54:50,442 --> 00:54:51,791
and a chance to live right

944
00:54:51,835 --> 00:54:54,098
and bring your kids up in the same way.

945
00:54:54,141 --> 00:54:56,840
This territory is going to grow faster

946
00:54:56,883 --> 00:54:59,843
and bigger than we ever dreamed.

947
00:54:59,886 --> 00:55:01,410
Those that feel like I do

948
00:55:01,453 --> 00:55:03,803
will do well to stay.

949
00:55:03,847 --> 00:55:05,457
And as for the others, well,

950
00:55:05,501 --> 00:55:06,545
we'll stake them to the expenses

951
00:55:06,589 --> 00:55:08,112
of their trip back home.

952
00:55:12,464 --> 00:55:14,161
I'm staying, Katie.

953
00:55:14,205 --> 00:55:16,337
- You can count on me, too.
- yeah.

954
00:55:16,381 --> 00:55:17,730
What about the rest of you?

955
00:55:31,309 --> 00:55:33,746
Katie, I'm afraid
I've got some bad news.

956
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:35,574
I was up on the north range
checking the cattle

957
00:55:35,618 --> 00:55:37,141
and I found a couple of fresh carcasses

958
00:55:37,184 --> 00:55:38,534
and some wolf tracks.

959
00:55:38,577 --> 00:55:40,144
- Wolves?
- Yeah, traveling in a pack,

960
00:55:40,187 --> 00:55:42,146
about a dozen of them
as near as I can make out.

961
00:55:42,189 --> 00:55:43,713
I've never heard of wolves
traveling in packs

962
00:55:43,756 --> 00:55:45,062
this far South.

963
00:55:45,105 --> 00:55:46,585
They're heading towards Timberline.

964
00:55:46,629 --> 00:55:49,066
Oh, I got my stock grazing up there.

965
00:55:49,109 --> 00:55:50,633
I better get my rifle and get going.

966
00:55:50,676 --> 00:55:52,199
- I'll go with you.
- Just a minute, boys,

967
00:55:52,243 --> 00:55:53,505
you'll need help.

968
00:55:53,549 --> 00:55:55,638
Folks, as part of these festivities,

969
00:55:55,681 --> 00:55:57,727
I'm organizing a wolf hunt.

970
00:55:57,770 --> 00:55:59,772
I'll pay $20 in gold

971
00:55:59,816 --> 00:56:01,513
for every pelt you bring back.

972
00:56:04,603 --> 00:56:06,779
Well, Jim, you sure you won't
change your mind

973
00:56:06,823 --> 00:56:08,215
- and come with us?
- No, I better stay

974
00:56:08,259 --> 00:56:09,869
and keep an eye on the party.

975
00:56:09,913 --> 00:56:12,872
Hmm, it's quite a pretty party
to keep an eye on.

976
00:56:12,916 --> 00:56:14,787
- What about you, Stacey?
- Oh, I'd have trouble

977
00:56:14,831 --> 00:56:16,746
getting on a horse,
let alone, riding one.

978
00:56:16,789 --> 00:56:18,182
Well, I'm thinking on four pelts,

979
00:56:18,225 --> 00:56:20,750
- one for each of us.
- Let's go.

980
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,865
Well, I guess everybody's here
except the boss.

981
00:58:15,516 --> 00:58:17,431
It's only a wild turkey.

982
00:58:19,172 --> 00:58:20,609
We got a long day ahead of us.

983
00:58:20,652 --> 00:58:22,045
They make mighty good eating.

984
00:58:23,786 --> 00:58:25,222
Here he comes.

985
00:58:38,148 --> 00:58:40,106
You all know what we're here for.

986
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:41,760
I had you men picked because I think

987
00:58:41,804 --> 00:58:43,544
you all feel the way I do.

988
00:58:43,588 --> 00:58:44,850
We didn't come out here

989
00:58:44,894 --> 00:58:46,896
for the good of the glorious West,

990
00:58:46,939 --> 00:58:48,724
but for our own good.

991
00:58:48,767 --> 00:58:50,290
Now, that being so, we are moving in

992
00:58:50,334 --> 00:58:52,641
on Comanche territory tonight.

993
00:58:52,684 --> 00:58:54,468
Are there any questions?

994
00:58:54,512 --> 00:58:56,427
Yeah.

995
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:57,820
Suppose the federal government

996
00:58:57,863 --> 00:58:59,604
brings troops in here to throw us out.

997
00:58:59,648 --> 00:59:01,127
There won't be any law
in this territory

998
00:59:01,171 --> 00:59:02,868
for 25 years.

999
00:59:02,912 --> 00:59:04,522
By that time, we'll all be rich enough

1000
00:59:04,565 --> 00:59:05,741
not to have to worry.

1001
00:59:05,784 --> 00:59:07,090
You've been talking mighty big

1002
00:59:07,133 --> 00:59:08,831
about how we're all gonna get rich,

1003
00:59:08,874 --> 00:59:10,267
but you ain't never mentioned

1004
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:11,703
how we're gonna split up the silver.

1005
00:59:11,747 --> 00:59:13,487
I'll let you know that
after we take over

1006
00:59:13,531 --> 00:59:14,793
and start digging it.

1007
00:59:14,837 --> 00:59:18,014
I'd like to know right now.

1008
00:59:18,057 --> 00:59:19,363
Are there any other troublemakers

1009
00:59:19,406 --> 00:59:21,104
hankering to know how we split up?

1010
00:59:21,147 --> 00:59:23,454
This ain't no argument, Stacey,

1011
00:59:23,497 --> 00:59:24,847
But what are the Comanches
gonna be doing

1012
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:26,326
while we're digging the silver?

1013
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:27,850
That's all taken care off.

1014
00:59:27,893 --> 00:59:29,286
Comanches without rifles

1015
00:59:29,329 --> 00:59:32,115
shouldn't present much of a problem.

1016
00:59:32,158 --> 00:59:34,944
I've got the original treaty right here

1017
00:59:34,987 --> 00:59:36,423
with, shall we say,

1018
00:59:36,467 --> 00:59:38,077
a little added clause.

1019
00:59:39,165 --> 00:59:40,732
Clause 10,

1020
00:59:40,776 --> 00:59:42,734
this treaty of peace to take effect

1021
00:59:42,778 --> 00:59:43,692
only on the condition that said

1022
00:59:43,735 --> 00:59:44,780
Comanche Indians

1023
00:59:44,823 --> 00:59:46,259
shall immediately as a token

1024
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:48,784
of their intention
of keeping said peace,

1025
00:59:48,827 --> 00:59:50,873
surrender all guns, rifles,

1026
00:59:50,916 --> 00:59:53,179
and powder in their possessions.

1027
00:59:53,223 --> 00:59:55,007
Well, there it is, Quisima,

1028
00:59:55,051 --> 00:59:56,400
all signed and sealed.

1029
00:59:56,443 --> 00:59:57,488
This trick of white man,

1030
00:59:57,531 --> 01:00:00,839
Comanche must not give up gun.

1031
01:00:00,883 --> 01:00:03,799
Long before white man came,

1032
01:00:03,842 --> 01:00:06,149
Comanche hunted with bow

1033
01:00:06,192 --> 01:00:09,413
and knife was happy.

1034
01:00:09,456 --> 01:00:10,806
White man's gun

1035
01:00:10,849 --> 01:00:13,286
has brought them only sorrow

1036
01:00:13,330 --> 01:00:15,506
and bloodshed.

1037
01:00:15,549 --> 01:00:18,378
Since we will now live in peace

1038
01:00:18,422 --> 01:00:20,816
with white brothers,

1039
01:00:20,859 --> 01:00:23,949
we not need these guns.

1040
01:00:25,298 --> 01:00:29,215
It shall be as white brother's wish.

1041
01:00:30,956 --> 01:00:32,741
Sorry you had to leave so soon.

1042
01:00:32,784 --> 01:00:34,525
Got to get the youngsters home
and straightened out,

1043
01:00:34,568 --> 01:00:36,048
they act too much.

1044
01:00:36,092 --> 01:00:38,398
Sure was a swell shindig, Ms. Howard.

1045
01:00:38,442 --> 01:00:40,792
That cake was every bit
as good as mom's.

1046
01:00:40,836 --> 01:00:43,926
Mmm, almost.

1047
01:00:45,014 --> 01:00:47,451
- Bye-bye.
- Bye. Bye.

1048
01:00:49,627 --> 01:00:50,889
Well, it looks like your party

1049
01:00:50,933 --> 01:00:52,761
is a success in more ways than one.

1050
01:00:52,804 --> 01:00:53,805
Thanks to you.

1051
01:00:53,849 --> 01:00:56,721
It was really your idea.

1052
01:00:56,765 --> 01:00:58,070
Folks took the change in plans

1053
01:00:58,114 --> 01:00:59,680
very nicely.

1054
01:00:59,724 --> 01:01:01,987
I'm sure you won't have any trouble.

1055
01:01:02,031 --> 01:01:03,293
And someday soon,
I'll be coming through

1056
01:01:03,336 --> 01:01:04,555
this way again

1057
01:01:04,598 --> 01:01:07,166
and this territory will be booming.

1058
01:01:07,210 --> 01:01:08,472
You're not leaving.

1059
01:01:08,515 --> 01:01:10,953
In a couple of days.

1060
01:01:10,996 --> 01:01:12,302
I want to get down there

1061
01:01:12,345 --> 01:01:14,521
and find out what it's all about.

1062
01:01:14,565 --> 01:01:16,785
When do you expect to get back?

1063
01:01:18,525 --> 01:01:19,570
I'd be more up to hurry

1064
01:01:19,613 --> 01:01:21,441
if I knew I was being missed.

1065
01:01:23,356 --> 01:01:25,663
In that case, Jim Bowie,

1066
01:01:25,706 --> 01:01:27,491
you'd better hurry.

1067
01:01:37,283 --> 01:01:39,416
I'm going to miss you, too.

1068
01:01:49,034 --> 01:01:50,079
Oh, what's the matter, Dan'l?

1069
01:01:50,122 --> 01:01:51,080
Didn't you get any wolves?

1070
01:01:51,123 --> 01:01:52,124
I found plenty of wolves,

1071
01:01:52,168 --> 01:01:53,604
two-legged wolves.

1072
01:01:53,647 --> 01:01:55,519
Jim Bowie, you and me have been took in

1073
01:01:55,562 --> 01:01:57,826
like a couple of first-class
greenhorns.

1074
01:01:57,869 --> 01:01:59,479
- Meaning, what?
- Meaning if there's a wolf pack

1075
01:01:59,523 --> 01:02:01,133
in them hills, I'll eat my saddle.

1076
01:02:01,177 --> 01:02:02,918
Looks like Ms. Howard and her brother

1077
01:02:02,961 --> 01:02:04,180
dealt it to us right off

1078
01:02:04,223 --> 01:02:06,138
the bottom of the deck.

1079
01:02:06,182 --> 01:02:09,054
I hope you know what you're
talking about, Mr. Seeger

1080
01:02:09,098 --> 01:02:10,447
because I don't.

1081
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:12,144
No, I suppose you don't know

1082
01:02:12,188 --> 01:02:13,145
where your brother is

1083
01:02:13,189 --> 01:02:14,494
or what he is up to.

1084
01:02:14,538 --> 01:02:16,061
Of course I do.

1085
01:02:16,105 --> 01:02:18,194
He took the buckboard back
to the ranch.

1086
01:02:18,237 --> 01:02:20,370
And you can just stop
your playacting, young woman.

1087
01:02:20,413 --> 01:02:21,371
Stacey and most of those men

1088
01:02:21,414 --> 01:02:22,676
are up in the hills

1089
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,504
in that supposed-to-be wolf hunt

1090
01:02:24,548 --> 01:02:26,202
and they are aiming to move in

1091
01:02:26,245 --> 01:02:27,203
on the Comanches.

1092
01:02:27,246 --> 01:02:28,813
Well, that's not true.

1093
01:02:28,857 --> 01:02:30,989
Naturally, she don't know
nothing about it.

1094
01:02:31,033 --> 01:02:32,382
Just like she don't know
her brother rides

1095
01:02:32,425 --> 01:02:33,905
like a

1096
01:02:33,949 --> 01:02:35,907
and he's mighty handy
in a lot of other ways.

1097
01:02:35,951 --> 01:02:38,344
Jim, I don't know anything about this.

1098
01:02:38,388 --> 01:02:40,216
- I swear it.
- I've got to hand it to you,

1099
01:02:40,259 --> 01:02:42,479
Ms. Howard, that wolf hunt
was a stroke of genius.

1100
01:02:42,522 --> 01:02:44,524
- You've got to believe me, Jim.
- You picked a clever way

1101
01:02:44,568 --> 01:02:46,613
of getting the guns back
to the men and sneaking them out

1102
01:02:46,657 --> 01:02:47,745
without arousing suspicion.

1103
01:02:47,788 --> 01:02:48,964
Jim, you've got to listen to me.

1104
01:02:49,007 --> 01:02:50,008
I've listened enough.

1105
01:02:50,052 --> 01:02:51,357
Let's go.

1106
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:02,107
Boozer, I want to see you
in the office.

1107
01:03:23,694 --> 01:03:25,391
I'm kind of busy out there, Ms. Katie.

1108
01:03:25,435 --> 01:03:26,740
Get over there.

1109
01:03:30,135 --> 01:03:32,050
Where's Stacey?

1110
01:03:32,094 --> 01:03:33,704
I don't know.

1111
01:03:33,747 --> 01:03:35,488
I guess he went home.

1112
01:03:35,532 --> 01:03:36,489
You know where he is

1113
01:03:36,533 --> 01:03:37,751
and what he's up to.

1114
01:03:37,795 --> 01:03:38,970
No, ma'am.

1115
01:03:39,014 --> 01:03:40,319
I don't know nothing.

1116
01:03:40,363 --> 01:03:41,581
Then, you'd better start guessing.

1117
01:03:41,625 --> 01:03:42,843
- No.
- Stay right where you are

1118
01:03:42,887 --> 01:03:44,062
and don't move.

1119
01:03:44,106 --> 01:03:45,542
What is this, a joke?

1120
01:03:45,585 --> 01:03:47,022
Listen, Boozer,

1121
01:03:47,065 --> 01:03:49,067
I've talked big and tough
all of my life,

1122
01:03:49,111 --> 01:03:52,201
but I've never shot anyone.

1123
01:03:52,244 --> 01:03:53,811
You'd better start talking.

1124
01:03:53,854 --> 01:03:55,813
But if I talk,

1125
01:03:55,856 --> 01:03:57,293
Stacey will kill me.

1126
01:03:57,336 --> 01:03:59,034
You can worry about that later.

1127
01:03:59,077 --> 01:04:00,949
If you don't talk,

1128
01:04:00,992 --> 01:04:03,038
I'll kill you.

1129
01:04:03,081 --> 01:04:04,865
We got here as fast as we could.

1130
01:04:04,909 --> 01:04:06,345
We do not want Quisima to think

1131
01:04:06,389 --> 01:04:07,825
it is the white man's government

1132
01:04:07,868 --> 01:04:09,218
that betrays The Comanche.

1133
01:04:09,261 --> 01:04:11,829
Our brother, Bowie has spoken well.

1134
01:04:11,872 --> 01:04:12,830
Quisima understand

1135
01:04:12,873 --> 01:04:14,310
there's great problem.

1136
01:04:14,353 --> 01:04:16,007
The boys still got a few hours
before sundown,

1137
01:04:16,051 --> 01:04:17,139
plenty of time to get ready

1138
01:04:17,182 --> 01:04:18,618
for that pack of human hyenas.

1139
01:04:18,662 --> 01:04:21,186
The Comanches have given up their guns.

1140
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:23,710
They have only arrows and lances

1141
01:04:23,754 --> 01:04:24,755
and few knives

1142
01:04:24,798 --> 01:04:26,496
my brother, Bowie made for them.

1143
01:04:26,539 --> 01:04:28,454
They'll never let you get
close enough to use them.

1144
01:04:28,498 --> 01:04:30,848
Well, they'd pick you off
like a herd of buffalo.

1145
01:04:30,891 --> 01:04:32,981
If Comanches must die,

1146
01:04:33,024 --> 01:04:34,634
they will die like men,

1147
01:04:34,678 --> 01:04:36,071
but never gave up

1148
01:04:36,114 --> 01:04:38,029
sacred soil of their fathers.

1149
01:04:38,073 --> 01:04:39,378
Listen, Quisima,

1150
01:04:39,422 --> 01:04:40,989
dying may be all right for your men,

1151
01:04:41,032 --> 01:04:42,033
but you've got to get your women

1152
01:04:42,077 --> 01:04:43,426
and children out of here.

1153
01:04:43,469 --> 01:04:45,036
Let them take what they can carry

1154
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:46,037
and hide out in the hills,

1155
01:04:46,081 --> 01:04:47,560
then spread your men out.

1156
01:04:47,604 --> 01:04:50,041
Let them fight
from behind rocks and trees.

1157
01:05:24,336 --> 01:05:25,511
Caution your braves again.

1158
01:05:25,555 --> 01:05:26,643
We'll wait beyond the village

1159
01:05:26,686 --> 01:05:28,079
until Stacey's men come close

1160
01:05:28,123 --> 01:05:29,559
on this mountain then we'll attack.

1161
01:05:39,134 --> 01:05:40,570
Well, Stacey,
the men are rested and fed

1162
01:05:40,613 --> 01:05:42,050
and raring to go.

1163
01:05:42,093 --> 01:05:43,573
Well, you can pass out some whiskey,

1164
01:05:43,616 --> 01:05:45,401
no more than two drinks per man.

1165
01:06:13,690 --> 01:06:15,996
You're quite a ways from home,
aren't you, sis?

1166
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:18,260
I had to see for myself.

1167
01:06:18,303 --> 01:06:20,131
Well, now you know.

1168
01:06:20,175 --> 01:06:21,089
You're not thinking of whipping

1169
01:06:21,132 --> 01:06:24,004
your naughty brother.

1170
01:06:24,048 --> 01:06:25,832
Quite an arsenal you've got over there.

1171
01:06:25,876 --> 01:06:27,573
You're not taking any chances.

1172
01:06:27,617 --> 01:06:28,922
I can't afford to.

1173
01:06:28,966 --> 01:06:30,576
The Comanches are most cooperative.

1174
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:33,101
They gave up their guns
without a struggle.

1175
01:06:33,144 --> 01:06:35,973
You've been planning this
for a long time.

1176
01:06:36,016 --> 01:06:38,367
Even before I come out here.

1177
01:06:38,410 --> 01:06:40,412
I suppose I'd be wasting my breath

1178
01:06:40,456 --> 01:06:42,110
if I tried to talk you out of it.

1179
01:06:42,153 --> 01:06:43,894
Just as much as if I tried to talk you

1180
01:06:43,937 --> 01:06:44,982
into coming in with me,

1181
01:06:45,025 --> 01:06:45,983
and giving up that nonsense

1182
01:06:46,026 --> 01:06:47,985
about building up the West.

1183
01:06:48,028 --> 01:06:49,595
Very well, Stacey.

1184
01:06:49,639 --> 01:06:51,380
Now we know where we stand.

1185
01:06:51,423 --> 01:06:54,644
From now on, I'm on the other
side of the fence.

1186
01:06:54,687 --> 01:06:57,342
Fortunes of war, Katie.

1187
01:06:58,430 --> 01:07:00,345
Where are you going?

1188
01:07:00,389 --> 01:07:03,043
Out of here if I don't get
a bullet in my back.

1189
01:07:26,502 --> 01:07:28,068
Take some men and go after her.

1190
01:07:41,647 --> 01:07:43,127
We're not waiting any longer.

1191
01:07:43,171 --> 01:07:44,781
We're moving in on
the Comanches right now.

1192
01:08:09,153 --> 01:08:11,373
Ha, ha.

1193
01:08:29,347 --> 01:08:31,306
Ha, ha.

1194
01:09:49,949 --> 01:09:51,473
I don't know how I'm gonna make out

1195
01:09:51,516 --> 01:09:52,996
with your kind of knife, Jim.

1196
01:09:53,039 --> 01:09:54,171
I was practically weaned

1197
01:09:54,214 --> 01:09:56,739
on this Arkansas toothpick.

1198
01:09:56,782 --> 01:09:59,219
Remember, it cuts up as well as down.

1199
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:03,223
This not white man's fight.

1200
01:10:03,267 --> 01:10:05,704
You go.

1201
01:10:05,748 --> 01:10:07,358
We like it here, Pakanah.

1202
01:10:07,402 --> 01:10:09,012
Besides, we've gotta make
things right on account

1203
01:10:09,055 --> 01:10:10,535
of what Stacey's doing.

1204
01:10:10,579 --> 01:10:11,928
It's fellers like him

1205
01:10:11,971 --> 01:10:14,713
that gives a white man a bad name.

1206
01:10:20,458 --> 01:10:22,417
Once, in anger,

1207
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:24,941
I want kill my brother, Bowie.

1208
01:10:26,334 --> 01:10:29,119
Now, if you let me,

1209
01:10:29,162 --> 01:10:31,600
I want fight beside him.

1210
01:10:32,601 --> 01:10:34,385
Glad to have you.

1211
01:10:35,865 --> 01:10:36,822
Well, wouldn't have to wait long

1212
01:10:36,866 --> 01:10:37,823
to get his wish.

1213
01:10:37,867 --> 01:10:38,824
Here they come.

1214
01:12:05,563 --> 01:12:07,609
They won't get their guns back.

1215
01:12:09,306 --> 01:12:11,351
Tell them to save their arrows.

1216
01:12:14,659 --> 01:12:16,574
Well, you know what
it feels like to be a turkey

1217
01:12:16,618 --> 01:12:18,097
in a turkey shoot.

1218
01:12:18,141 --> 01:12:20,970
Well, they can't hold that much longer.

1219
01:12:22,188 --> 01:12:24,103
Maybe if I try to ration them.

1220
01:12:25,757 --> 01:12:27,324
You think so, huh?

1221
01:12:30,283 --> 01:12:32,111
Look.

1222
01:12:40,076 --> 01:12:42,513
They won't get their guns back, eh?

1223
01:12:48,737 --> 01:12:50,260
Quick, rifles.

1224
01:12:57,485 --> 01:12:58,529
Don't get them tied along.

1225
01:12:58,573 --> 01:12:59,530
Let's go.

1226
01:14:40,370 --> 01:14:42,372
I ought to turn you over
to The Comanches,

1227
01:14:42,415 --> 01:14:45,201
but you'll be a lot safer
with the federal government.

1228
01:14:46,506 --> 01:14:47,595
As soon as I finish my business

1229
01:14:47,638 --> 01:14:48,596
with Mr. Houston,

1230
01:14:48,639 --> 01:14:49,597
I'll be back.

1231
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:51,337
Hurry, Jim,

1232
01:14:51,381 --> 01:14:53,557
I'll need a lot more help now.

1233
01:14:53,601 --> 01:14:54,558
Looking like that,

1234
01:14:54,602 --> 01:14:56,255
you'll do all right.

1235
01:15:01,870 --> 01:15:03,741
Well, goodbye, Kate.

1236
01:15:03,785 --> 01:15:04,873
Bye, Jim.

1237
01:15:04,916 --> 01:15:06,657
Good luck.

1238
01:15:11,401 --> 01:15:12,532
That ain't no way

1239
01:15:12,576 --> 01:15:13,838
to say goodbye to a gal,

1240
01:15:13,882 --> 01:15:15,535
you big galoot.

1241
01:15:15,579 --> 01:15:17,755
Go ahead and kiss her.
