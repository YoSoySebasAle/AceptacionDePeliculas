Look, the only thing wrong with you, Coral,

47
00:04:12,508 --> 00:04:15,005
is you can't stand if someone's
more mental than you.

48
00:04:15,053 --> 00:04:18,280
Girls, we are having dinner at the table...

49
00:04:18,457 --> 00:04:20,819
as if we were a normal family.

50
00:04:22,921 --> 00:04:25,202
Well, Mum's way more mental than you!

51
00:04:25,227 --> 00:04:27,928
- We're more mental than you.
- I'm a sociopath.

52
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,928
- Leanne's autistic.
- Other people eat dinner together,

53
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,022
so why not us?

54
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:33,444
- We looked it up.
- And they talk to each other.

55
00:04:33,484 --> 00:04:35,116
They tell each other about their days.

56
00:04:35,155 --> 00:04:37,046
Even Michelle's more mental than you.

57
00:04:37,085 --> 00:04:38,694
She hears voices.

58
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,702
- She told us.
- In her head.

59
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:42,626
And she thinks she's being followed.

60
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,227
By aliens.

61
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,571
Now, top that, Coral.

62
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,438
And when your father gets home,

63
00:04:49,501 --> 00:04:52,220

64
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,922
Dad's not coming.

65
00:04:54,016 --> 00:04:57,188
He hasn't had dinner with us
since "The Disgrace".

66
00:04:57,626 --> 00:04:59,938
- Coral!
- Dad hates us, Mum.

67
00:04:59,993 --> 00:05:02,493
That's because we're not a real family.

68
00:05:02,563 --> 00:05:04,347
But when we start acting like one,

69
00:05:04,378 --> 00:05:06,808
telling each other about our days
and singing and dancing,

70
00:05:06,836 --> 00:05:08,808
then he will want to be with us.

00:11:04,768 --> 00:11:06,610

185
00:11:15,413 --> 00:11:17,094
G'day, Mrs. Moochmore.
How are ya?

186
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,132
Oh, I'm fine, thank you.
How are you?

187
00:11:19,163 --> 00:11:23,058
Bet you want a big jam and cream
doughnut this morning, don't ya?

188
00:11:23,093 --> 00:11:24,421
Oh, well, no.

189
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,491
Of course you do.
And an iced coffee to go with it.

190
00:11:26,516 --> 00:11:29,069
- An iced coffee.
- Just an iced coffee.

191
00:11:30,192 --> 00:11:31,466
No doughnut?

192
00:11:31,544 --> 00:11:33,247
No, not this morning.

193
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,482
Okay.

194
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:37,700
Mrs. Moochmore reckons she doesn't
want a jam and cream doughnut.

195
00:11:37,753 --> 00:11:39,544
What are you talking about?

196
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:43,052
You always have a jam
and cream doughnut, Mrs. Moo.

197
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,786
- She's pulling your leg, Manda.
- No, I'm not.

198
00:11:45,832 --> 00:11:48,184
- Oh, we'll give you two.
- She's dying for it.

199
00:11:48,222 --> 00:11:50,130
No, really. I...

200
00:11:51,927 --> 00:11:54,091
$5.50, Mrs. Moochmore.

201
00:11:54,411 --> 00:11:56,262
But I, I don't want it.

202
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,309
What are you talking about?

203
00:11:58,614 --> 00:12:00,950
Gone to all this trouble.

204
00:12:02,836 --> 00:12:05,109
Enjoying that, Mrs. Moochmore?

205
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:06,758
Oh, yes, thank you.

206
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:08,804
You want another one?

207
00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:10,195
Oh.

208
00:12:10,258 --> 00:12:11,610
No, thank you.

209
00:12:12,211 --> 00:12:13,961
Moo.

210
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:15,406
- What?
- Shirley.

211
00:12:15,446 --> 00:12:17,945
- Mm? Oh!
- What are you doing?

212
00:12:18,336 --> 00:12:21,047
- Um--
- You promised me no more fattening foods.

213
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:22,774
Don't you care about your health?

214
00:12:22,812 --> 00:12:24,822
I do. I do.

215
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,009
Well, if you don't care,
how do you expect me to care?

216
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:28,134
Oh, I do care.

217
00:12:28,174 --> 00:12:29,750
And, and I care that you care.

218
00:12:29,775 --> 00:12:31,189
I brought the girls.

219
00:12:31,447 --> 00:12:33,517
They've just been glazed.

220
00:12:33,798 --> 00:12:34,962
Oh.

221
00:12:37,741 --> 00:12:39,712
Elizabeth the 1st.

222
00:12:40,571 --> 00:12:42,142
For the competition.

223
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:45,439
I'm doing Elizabeth the 1st.

224
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:48,661
Now, feel Miriam's hair.

225
00:12:49,234 --> 00:12:50,525
Go on.

226
00:12:51,457 --> 00:12:52,791
Nylon.

227
00:12:53,298 --> 00:12:55,291
Now, feel Yvette's.

228
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,377
Feel the difference?

229
00:12:59,017 --> 00:13:00,150
Human.

230
00:13:00,252 --> 00:13:03,867
I want to do Elizabeth the 1st
with human hair.

231
00:13:04,095 --> 00:13:06,548
Red human hair.

232
00:13:07,946 --> 00:13:09,054
Do you think, um...

233
00:13:09,117 --> 00:13:12,195
Jane would like
to visit me this afternoon?

234
00:13:13,362 --> 00:13:14,601
Jane?

235
00:13:14,867 --> 00:13:16,671
Oh, I'm sure she would.

236
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,562
I'll pick her up after school, then.

237
00:13:20,202 --> 00:13:21,804
You know, I think I will have cream.

238
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,804
I don't think Barry loves me anymore.

239
00:13:23,851 --> 00:13:24,929
What?

240
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,273
Well, did Barry say that?

241
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,374
Well, then, how do you know?

242
00:13:31,304 --> 00:13:33,124
He never looks at me.

243
00:13:34,151 --> 00:13:36,057
He never says anything to me.

244
00:13:37,432 --> 00:13:39,245
He hasn't come home for two weeks.

245
00:13:39,292 --> 00:13:41,229
Barry's got a lot on his mind these days,

246
00:13:41,271 --> 00:13:43,307
what with the election coming up.

247
00:13:43,401 --> 00:13:46,581
I don't blame him
for not loving me anymore.

248
00:13:47,151 --> 00:13:50,010
- I know I've let myself go.
- Oh, no, stop that.

249
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,042
- I let the girls run wild.
- Well, I've always said that.

250
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:55,167
I remind people of garbage.

251
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:56,245
Who does?

252
00:13:56,292 --> 00:13:57,573
I do.

253
00:13:57,606 --> 00:13:59,745
My bins do.

254
00:14:01,701 --> 00:14:04,221
Well, use that perfume
I gave you for Christmas.

255
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:05,706
That L'Air Du Temps.

256
00:14:06,072 --> 00:14:07,282
No, enough of that.

257
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,417
Uh...

258
00:14:08,854 --> 00:14:10,010
have another doughnut.

259
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:12,979
You said I shouldn't eat
any more doughnuts.

260
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:15,964
Well, if it, it, it cheers you up,
you can have a dozen doughnuts.

261
00:14:16,018 --> 00:14:18,112
She'll, she'll have another doughnut.

262
00:14:18,174 --> 00:14:19,385
Jam and cream?

263
00:14:19,417 --> 00:14:21,737
Uh, yes, why not?

264
00:14:21,821 --> 00:14:23,315
My treat.

265
00:14:25,274 --> 00:14:27,573
- Can't this wait till later?
- No!

266
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,729
No. Well...

267
00:14:31,855 --> 00:14:33,503
I'm sure everything's fine.

268
00:14:33,534 --> 00:14:36,159
It's not fine!

269
00:14:36,664 --> 00:14:39,432
I feel like I don't exist.

270
00:14:39,464 --> 00:14:41,214
Well, Of course, you exist.
Everyone exists.

271
00:14:41,239 --> 00:14:44,440
But, I don't. I sit here and
I eat doughnuts I don't want!

272
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:46,659
Now get a grip on yourself.
Stop this spectacle.

273
00:14:46,698 --> 00:14:47,995
Hmm?

274
00:14:48,042 --> 00:14:50,440
Why don't you go shopping?
That always cheers me up.

275
00:14:50,495 --> 00:14:54,635
You just go shopping and you keep
shopping until you cheer up.

276
00:14:57,324 --> 00:14:59,621
Michelle.

277
00:14:59,684 --> 00:15:02,371
- Give us the mechanical man.
- No, no!

278
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:06,152
- I don't have the mechanical man!
- Give us the mechanical man.

279
00:15:06,965 --> 00:15:08,168
- Ah!
- Michelle...

280
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,605
do you want a couch?

281
00:15:09,668 --> 00:15:10,738
A couch.

282
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:12,730
It's a lovely white couch.

283
00:15:12,801 --> 00:15:14,793
Oh, she doesn't want it.

284
00:15:15,105 --> 00:15:18,263
Why didn't you tell me
your father had won Wheel Of Fortune?

285
00:15:18,326 --> 00:15:19,912
Darling, don't lie in here
with the lights off.

286
00:15:19,951 --> 00:15:21,662
It's not normal.

287
00:15:32,812 --> 00:15:34,843
Dolphin Heads Council,
Mayor Moochmore's office.

288
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,563
Tisha speaking.

289
00:15:39,992 --> 00:15:42,338
- Polly, I've already warned youse twice.
- This council is not listening...

290
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,534
- Barry Yono.
- One more time, I'm gonna take it away.

291
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,851
Barry!

292
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:47,375
I mean...

293
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:49,260
Mayor Moochmore.

294
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:52,096
There's an emergency.

295
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,400
At home.

296
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:55,299
It's an Excelsior.

297
00:15:55,565 --> 00:15:56,620
Oh!

298
00:15:58,536 --> 00:16:01,747
It's the vacuum cleaner I've always wanted.
And it's purple. Oh!

299
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:04,866
Oh, my goodness!
Another washing machine. Oh!

300
00:16:04,905 --> 00:16:06,550
Put it right there with the others.
Thank you.

301
00:16:06,575 --> 00:16:07,646
- Mum.
- Yes.

302
00:16:07,693 --> 00:16:09,070
- I'm scared.
- Oh...

303
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:10,656
don't be silly, darling.

304
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:14,257
Does anyone on TV look scared when
their fathers win the Wheel Of Fortune?

305
00:16:14,296 --> 00:16:15,390
Of course not.

306
00:16:15,429 --> 00:16:17,994
They're happy someone
invented game shows.

307
00:16:18,072 --> 00:16:20,111
And when your dad gets home,

308
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,533
we are gonna celebrate with dinner...

309
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:24,525
on our new table!

310
00:16:24,611 --> 00:16:26,712
Oh, look!
There's Nancy Boyle.

311
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,525
Nancy, hello!

312
00:16:28,619 --> 00:16:29,846
Hello.

313
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,470
Look at all the furniture.

314
00:16:31,534 --> 00:16:33,501
It's alright.
You don't have to be afraid of it.

315
00:16:33,536 --> 00:16:34,759
It's not rubbish.

316
00:16:34,822 --> 00:16:36,010
It's all new.

317
00:16:36,056 --> 00:16:37,940
Fabulously new from my husband.

318
00:16:38,082 --> 00:16:40,494
He calls you 'Noxious Nance'
behind your back, he does.

319
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,392
He says you're a nasty,
gossiping bitch.

320
00:16:42,439 --> 00:16:45,290
But, I think that's unfair, because
you've done a lot for this community.

321
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,665
Or at least, act like you have.

322
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,712
So, I want you to have this lamp.

323
00:16:49,815 --> 00:16:53,079
Is you oldest daughter really a lesbian
or is that just malicious gossip?

324
00:16:53,611 --> 00:16:54,619
Oh!

325
00:16:54,658 --> 00:16:55,822
He's here.

326
00:16:55,885 --> 00:16:57,087
We've done it.

327
00:16:57,143 --> 00:16:59,767
He's home.
Your father's home.

328
00:16:59,837 --> 00:17:01,386
Quickly, start singing.

What the fuck is going on?

336
00:17:29,652 --> 00:17:31,716
Jane, get away from that!

337
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:33,143
It's going back to the shop.

338
00:17:33,182 --> 00:17:34,838
I'm Kayleen.

339
00:17:39,489 --> 00:17:41,528
Make sure you leave the kettle on
the whole time--

340
00:17:41,573 --> 00:17:43,067
Bastard.

341
00:17:50,245 --> 00:17:51,854
Sit at the table, Dad.

342
00:17:52,253 --> 00:17:54,237
We're getting you breakfast.

343
00:18:01,717 --> 00:18:04,772
Fresh and premium cold beer, Dad.

344
00:18:05,633 --> 00:18:07,362
Excuse me.

345
00:18:22,754 --> 00:18:24,174
Your mum...

346
00:18:24,494 --> 00:18:26,667
is on holiday in Wollongong,

347
00:18:26,728 --> 00:18:29,387
and she's having a wonderful time.

348
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,448
If anybody asks, that's the story.

349
00:18:32,484 --> 00:18:33,946
You got it?

350
00:18:42,293 --> 00:18:43,600
Dad...

351
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:46,781
we were thinking,
while Mum's away,

352
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:49,367
maybe we should be seeing somebody.

353
00:18:49,452 --> 00:18:51,192
You know, like a psychiatrist.

354
00:18:51,228 --> 00:18:52,338
What?

355
00:18:52,513 --> 00:18:54,874
Someone to talk to about our problems.

356
00:18:54,946 --> 00:18:55,996
What?

357
00:18:56,031 --> 00:18:57,671
So we don't end up in Wollongong.

358
00:18:57,715 --> 00:19:00,272
- What?
- Dad, I'm autistic.

359
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:03,042
Dad, I'm a sociopath.
I don't feel anything.

360
00:19:03,067 --> 00:19:04,242
- I'm pre-psychotic.
- Michelle hears voices.

361
00:19:04,292 --> 00:19:05,776
- Don't you Michelle?
- What?

362
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:07,743
- Tell Dad you hear voices.
- Wait.

363
00:19:07,786 --> 00:19:09,403
I hear voices.

364
00:19:10,909 --> 00:19:12,471
And I just keep looking away.

365
00:19:12,521 --> 00:19:14,239
She did it to me three times.

366
00:19:14,297 --> 00:19:16,065
I don't want to end up in Wollongong, Dad.

367
00:19:16,107 --> 00:19:19,715
- Auntie Doris stole my hair!
- Enough!

368
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:25,915
There are no psychiatrists in
Dolphin Heads anywhere but the loony bin.

369
00:19:25,951 --> 00:19:30,196
And the only person in this family
going to the loony bin is your mother!

370
00:19:30,552 --> 00:19:33,140
This wouldn't be happening to me
if I had a family of boys.

371
00:19:33,178 --> 00:19:34,720
Boys have breakdowns, Dad.

372
00:19:34,777 --> 00:19:38,061
Not Australian boys.
They're too busy playing football.

373
00:19:38,118 --> 00:19:39,822
Now, I've got an election to run,

374
00:19:39,865 --> 00:19:41,875
and I don't care if you five lumps...

375
00:19:41,925 --> 00:19:45,024
eat me out of house and home,
and spend every cent I make.

376
00:19:45,089 --> 00:19:47,877
No-one is going mental.

377
00:19:48,055 --> 00:19:49,918
Not before I do.

378
00:19:50,953 --> 00:19:52,392
I'm going mental!

379
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:53,599
I live in a barn, Jack.

380
00:19:53,644 --> 00:19:56,745
There's pizza boxes piled everywhere
because none of them can cook.

381
00:19:56,806 --> 00:19:58,833
They can't do the dishes,
they don't make the beds.

382
00:19:58,883 --> 00:20:01,717
- It's a nightmare!
- Get Shirley back from her holiday.

383
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,237
- She can't come back.
- Why not?

384
00:20:03,272 --> 00:20:04,686
It's been over a week.

385
00:20:04,776 --> 00:20:07,363
Barry, you gotta level with me.
Has she left you?

386
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,608
Because if she has, get her back.

387
00:20:09,686 --> 00:20:12,214
Mate, we go to the polls in eight weeks.

388
00:20:12,239 --> 00:20:14,139
She's on all of the leaﬂets
with you and the girls.

389
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:17,328
She hasn't left me.
She's in Wollongong, and she likes it.

390
00:20:17,434 --> 00:20:19,607
I wish I was there meself.

391
00:20:23,421 --> 00:20:24,661
Nah.

392
00:20:29,832 --> 00:20:31,330
Nah.

393
00:20:33,022 --> 00:20:35,524
Turn around and have another look.

394
00:20:37,928 --> 00:20:39,061
Looks normal.

395
00:20:39,111 --> 00:20:40,553
Got a dog.

396
00:20:41,764 --> 00:20:43,379
Nah, I can't.

397
00:20:43,584 --> 00:20:44,991
Hitchhiker.

398
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,397
Nah.

399
00:20:47,918 --> 00:20:49,842
- Barry Moochmore.
<i>- Dad!</i>

400
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,051
<i>I know you don't believe anything I say,</i>

401
00:20:52,076 --> 00:20:53,407
<i>but I'm a sociopath.</i>

402
00:20:53,432 --> 00:20:54,821
<i>I don't have any feelings.</i>

403
00:20:54,885 --> 00:20:57,278
- Which one is this?
<i>- It's Kayleen!</i>

404
00:20:57,321 --> 00:20:59,608
<i>Why don't you ever remember my name?</i>

405
00:20:59,639 --> 00:21:02,407
Look, don't worry about it.
I'm gonna fix everything.

406
00:21:16,027 --> 00:21:18,118
The embarrassment is total.

407
00:21:18,182 --> 00:21:21,016
I have to get some hats.
People are gawking at me.

408
00:21:21,048 --> 00:21:22,600
<i>- What does your dad think?</i>
- Oh.

409
00:21:22,671 --> 00:21:26,208
Dad thinks 12-year-olds
don't know anything, but they do.

410
00:21:29,876 --> 00:21:30,934
<i>Jane?</i>

411
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,586
Don't make any sudden moves.

412
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,431
Ripper! Come here.

413
00:21:39,863 --> 00:21:41,905
I didn't train him to kill.

414
00:21:42,147 --> 00:21:43,636
He does it out of love.

415
00:21:43,722 --> 00:21:44,737
Of course,

416
00:21:44,766 --> 00:21:46,509
he only kills for me.

417
00:21:46,695 --> 00:21:48,605
If someone attacked you,

418
00:21:48,712 --> 00:21:50,239
he'd watch.

419
00:21:50,438 --> 00:21:51,624
Hm.

420
00:21:51,773 --> 00:21:54,215
Is, is my dad here?

421
00:21:54,263 --> 00:21:56,012
In the back room.

422
00:21:56,927 --> 00:21:58,896
Wouldn't have paid for that haircut
if I was you.

423
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:03,200
Brother! It's Barry.

424
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,578
Dad.

425
00:22:04,933 --> 00:22:06,474
- Who's that woman?
- Oh.

426
00:22:06,524 --> 00:22:08,250
I forget her name. But...

427
00:22:08,307 --> 00:22:10,977
you are to do everything she tells you.

428
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,749
Nah, nah, everything's Jake.

429
00:22:12,828 --> 00:22:14,922
I took your advice and
got meself a babysitter.

430
00:22:14,986 --> 00:22:17,036
Yeah, hired her on the way home.

431
00:22:17,093 --> 00:22:18,608
She can live in, too.

432
00:22:18,722 --> 00:22:19,752
Ah.

433
00:22:19,801 --> 00:22:20,831
Oi.

434
00:22:20,952 --> 00:22:22,230
She's staying in your room.

435
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:23,318
Where will I sleep?

436
00:22:23,353 --> 00:22:25,015
You share with Jane.

437
00:22:25,071 --> 00:22:26,513
I am Jane.

438
00:22:26,562 --> 00:22:30,377
I don't care about that anymore.
Tell your problems to what's-her-name.

439
00:22:30,509 --> 00:22:31,844
Feel like a beer, mate?

440
00:22:31,947 --> 00:22:33,087
Great!

441
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:36,540
- I'll see you in ten minutes.
- No, I don't have the mechanical man!

442
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:39,821
Fair enough.

443
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,944
That's Michelle.

444
00:22:46,054 --> 00:22:47,437
She's mental.

445
00:22:47,493 --> 00:22:49,054
We all are.

446
00:22:51,219 --> 00:22:53,116
I'll be the judge of that.

447
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:01,449
What are you doing?

448
00:23:01,478 --> 00:23:03,371
- Coral!
- She's making us clean.

449
00:23:03,396 --> 00:23:04,398
- Who is?
- Shaz!

450
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:05,700
- Coral.
- Her dog's crazy.

451
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,191
- Whose dog?
- Shaz's dog.

452
00:23:07,228 --> 00:23:08,832
It's gonna kill us if we stop cleaning.

453
00:23:08,857 --> 00:23:10,486
You're the oldest, Coral.
Get rid of her.

454
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:11,740
She's in there.

455
00:23:11,803 --> 00:23:12,998
She's got a knife.

456
00:23:13,046 --> 00:23:15,662
I saw it sticking out of her boot.

457
00:23:25,922 --> 00:23:27,265
Gawvvw!

458
00:23:27,303 --> 00:23:29,241
Oh, oh, not bad.

459
00:23:32,336 --> 00:23:33,945
Who are you?

460
00:23:35,893 --> 00:23:38,500
- Coral.
- Oh, like the sea.

461
00:23:38,854 --> 00:23:40,695
The Coral Sea.

462
00:23:41,151 --> 00:23:43,086
I'm Shaz. Just...

463
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:44,766
Shaz.

464
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,976
<i>- I'm Shaz.</i>
<i>- Mm, I'm tough.</i>

465
00:23:47,053 --> 00:23:48,640
Ripper!

466
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,465
What are you doing here?

467
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:00,950
I'm here...

468
00:24:01,052 --> 00:24:03,473
to fulfill me destiny.

469
00:24:04,058 --> 00:24:06,426
Right a grievous wrong.

470
00:24:09,612 --> 00:24:11,248
See the sights.

471
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:14,178
Where's your mum, by the way?

472
00:24:14,223 --> 00:24:15,691
She's...

473
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,397
In Wollongong?

474
00:24:21,133 --> 00:24:22,772
On holiday?

475
00:24:23,448 --> 00:24:25,530
Having a wonderful time?

476
00:24:27,422 --> 00:24:29,194
I'm not scared of you.

477
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,163
I work in a shark show.

478
00:24:31,225 --> 00:24:32,397
You're kidding.

479
00:24:32,467 --> 00:24:34,108
They're dead, but...

480
00:24:34,186 --> 00:24:36,592
one of them ate Harold Holt.

481
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:48,498
Don't worry, love.

482
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,592
It would've been quick.

483
00:25:37,488 --> 00:25:39,269
Patchouli oil?

484
00:25:39,394 --> 00:25:40,902
She's a hippie.

485
00:25:49,144 --> 00:25:50,617
It's pretend.

486
00:25:58,317 --> 00:26:00,122
Hm, "Di...

487
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,473
disa...

488
00:26:01,505 --> 00:26:02,817
agnosum--"

489
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,695
"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders".

490
00:26:07,351 --> 00:26:09,968
Maybe she's a psychiatrist,
like we wished for.

491
00:26:10,031 --> 00:26:11,554
Hhh!

492
00:26:12,116 --> 00:26:13,741
G'day.

493
00:26:13,921 --> 00:26:16,249
Sharon Thornbender.
All the way from Tassie.

494
00:26:16,304 --> 00:26:17,695
Nancy.

495
00:26:17,961 --> 00:26:21,148
Nancy Boyle.
This is my daughter... Donna.

496
00:26:21,185 --> 00:26:22,952
Jeez, you're a big one,
aren't you, Donna?

497
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:24,655
Which house did you say you'd moved into?

498
00:26:24,695 --> 00:26:25,961
I didn't.

499
00:26:26,023 --> 00:26:28,382
You'll have to invite me in
for a cuppa tea, won't you?

500
00:26:28,415 --> 00:26:30,207
Already been next door.

501
00:26:30,294 --> 00:26:32,476
The Mooch mores?

502
00:26:32,848 --> 00:26:35,195
Could I tell you stories.

503
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:40,977
Once I saw Shirley Moochmore
standing outside in their backyard...

504
00:26:41,165 --> 00:26:42,759
screaming.

505
00:26:42,853 --> 00:26:43,923
No.

506
00:26:43,966 --> 00:26:46,634
Her screaming's better
than her singing, though.

507
00:26:46,728 --> 00:26:48,345
Ugh!

508
00:26:48,424 --> 00:26:49,891
Close your legs.

509
00:26:50,164 --> 00:26:52,673
She brought it on herself,
in my opinion.

510
00:26:52,876 --> 00:26:56,618
Because those girls, they're enough
to drive anyone around the bend.

511
00:26:56,651 --> 00:26:59,774
But, who let them get that way?

512
00:27:00,426 --> 00:27:02,985
- She did.
- Mm.

513
00:27:03,124 --> 00:27:04,845
- Legs.
- Yeah.

514
00:27:05,186 --> 00:27:06,602
Once, um...

515
00:27:06,649 --> 00:27:08,696
once they bought this pool.

516
00:27:08,729 --> 00:27:09,797
Oh!

517
00:27:10,048 --> 00:27:11,423
This is...

518
00:27:11,473 --> 00:27:13,610
Oh, no, no, this...

519
00:27:16,087 --> 00:27:17,891
This is terrible.

520
00:27:18,985 --> 00:27:21,930
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
You can't tell her that!

521
00:27:21,965 --> 00:27:23,477
- I won't!
- You can't!

522
00:27:24,813 --> 00:27:27,337
They got this upright pool...

523
00:27:28,391 --> 00:27:30,954
and they put it in their backyard,

524
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:34,852
and, and their backyard's on a slant.

525
00:27:35,243 --> 00:27:37,102
So all the Moochmores,

526
00:27:37,141 --> 00:27:38,665
they all get in.

527
00:27:39,139 --> 00:27:40,876
And then...

528
00:27:40,957 --> 00:27:43,743
Well, not all of them, not Barry of course,
because you never see him.

529
00:27:43,782 --> 00:27:46,212
But because it's on a slant,
they just go, like,

530
00:27:46,283 --> 00:27:49,048
washing to one side...

531
00:27:51,534 --> 00:27:53,938
And then the side...

532
00:27:53,977 --> 00:27:57,860
- And the side just, like, breaks.
- Side breaks!

533
00:28:02,965 --> 00:28:05,051
So they just spill out,

534
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:07,138
all over the yard.

535
00:28:07,161 --> 00:28:09,918
- And they ﬂoat.
- Rolling out like a bunch of bananas.

536
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,895
Shirley Moochmore, ugh,

537
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:14,051
she just starts screaming again!

538
00:28:14,118 --> 00:28:18,403
It's like living next door
to an Aboriginal encampment.

539
00:28:18,977 --> 00:28:21,270
Because Mum hates Abos.

540
00:28:21,477 --> 00:28:24,379
And where is Shirley Moochmore these days?

541
00:28:24,418 --> 00:28:27,106
There's the million-dollar question.

542
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:36,100
Oh! Oh! Oh!

543
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:37,358
You're such an idiot!

544
00:28:37,397 --> 00:28:38,441
Coral, help!

545
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,183
In all me life, I have never
witnessed a sorrier display.

546
00:28:46,505 --> 00:28:48,184
- Yep.
<i>- Shirley?</i>

547
00:28:48,239 --> 00:28:49,458
No. Who's this?

548
00:28:49,514 --> 00:28:51,473
This is Doris Charles speaking.

549
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:55,200
Ah! Would this be
Auntie Doris Charles?

550
00:28:55,411 --> 00:28:56,950
<i>Who is this?</i>

551
00:28:57,005 --> 00:28:58,548
This is Auntie Shaz speaking.

552
00:28:58,596 --> 00:29:00,515
Auntie Shaz?

553
00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:03,172
I didn't know Barry had a sister.

554
00:29:03,343 --> 00:29:05,914
Yeah, well, I'm more the auntie
you earn than the other kind.

555
00:29:05,945 --> 00:29:07,211
What other kind?

556
00:29:07,266 --> 00:29:10,430
Your kind.
The hairdressing kind.

557
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,437
I'm not a hairdresser.

558
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,424
Oh. Well, you'd better give Jane
her hair back, then, hadn't you?

559
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:16,917
You ready?

560
00:29:18,538 --> 00:29:20,502
OK. Another one.

561
00:29:22,821 --> 00:29:24,588
It's still me.

562
00:29:30,422 --> 00:29:33,282
You know what they say
about youse in this town, hm?

563
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:35,532
They say youse are freaks.

564
00:29:35,624 --> 00:29:37,430
They say you don't belong.

565
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:41,758
They say you're good-for-nothing layabouts
who'll never achieve nothing.

566
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:45,906
If someone said that about me,
I'd cut their throats.

567
00:29:46,163 --> 00:29:48,406
Why aren't youse out there
cutting their throats?

568
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:50,773
Because it's true.

569
00:29:51,796 --> 00:29:54,734
There's someone outside watching us.

570
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:58,507
Oh.

571
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,411
This'll be good.

572
00:30:03,458 --> 00:30:04,747
Hello?

573
00:30:04,802 --> 00:30:05,974
Come out.

574
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,385
Hello?

575
00:30:07,513 --> 00:30:08,731
Hello?

576
00:30:08,767 --> 00:30:10,122
Hello?

577
00:30:10,365 --> 00:30:11,677
I think they hung up.

578
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,669
Michelle...

579
00:30:14,405 --> 00:30:16,731
you're holding the phone
the wrong way, darl.

580
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,091
- Hello?
- Michelle'?

581
00:30:19,364 --> 00:30:20,708
Yeah?

582
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:23,270
- Can you talk?
- Yeah.

583
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:26,474
It's Auntie Doris.

584
00:30:26,568 --> 00:30:27,865
Is everything alright?

585
00:30:27,901 --> 00:30:30,708
Oh. Is that you outside in the car?

586
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:33,966
Where's your mother?

587
00:30:34,013 --> 00:30:35,482
On holiday.

588
00:30:35,591 --> 00:30:37,036
On holiday?

589
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,645
Well, where's Barry?
Where's your father?

590
00:30:38,684 --> 00:30:40,044
I dunno.

591
00:30:40,098 --> 00:30:42,067
He's never here, is he?

592
00:30:42,113 --> 00:30:45,293
Maybe, he's dead
and they forgot to tell us.

593
00:30:46,573 --> 00:30:48,347
Can you see me at the window?

594
00:30:48,418 --> 00:30:50,918
I'm waving at you.
Why don't you come in?

595
00:30:51,044 --> 00:30:53,613
No. No, I can't come in.

596
00:30:53,668 --> 00:30:55,121
She never comes in.

597
00:30:55,168 --> 00:30:57,129
She thinks we're pigs.

598
00:30:57,597 --> 00:30:59,987
- Really?
- We're not pigs now.

599
00:31:00,056 --> 00:31:02,650
It's all tidy in here. See?

600
00:31:04,246 --> 00:31:06,035
Did you break down or something?

601
00:31:06,082 --> 00:31:09,496
We could come out and give you a push.

602
00:31:10,832 --> 00:31:13,464
Michelle, look.
Who is this Shaz woman?

603
00:31:13,489 --> 00:31:14,503
- G'day.
- Oh!

604
00:31:14,551 --> 00:31:16,816
Sharon Thornbender.
All the way from Tassie.

605
00:31:16,863 --> 00:31:18,183
Oh! Oh!

606
00:31:18,214 --> 00:31:20,316
Put it on speaker.
Put it on speaker!

607
00:31:20,449 --> 00:31:22,238
Don't make any sudden moves, Doris.

608
00:31:22,263 --> 00:31:24,082
He's checking to see
if you're a sex pervert.

609
00:31:24,107 --> 00:31:25,246
Can't be too careful.

610
00:31:25,285 --> 00:31:27,988
And Ripper here can sniff out
a psycho at ten paces.

611
00:31:28,542 --> 00:31:30,316
Oh, he doesn't like the smell of you.

612
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:32,521
Doris, you're not a sex pervert, are you?

613
00:31:32,584 --> 00:31:33,609
- Hrr.
- No.

614
00:31:33,654 --> 00:31:36,003
Then what are you doing
sitting out here in the dark, then?

615
00:31:36,043 --> 00:31:38,378
Are you some old lezzie
on the prowl for young girls?

616
00:31:38,418 --> 00:31:39,800
Certainly not.

617
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,496
- I'm married.
- Prove it.

618
00:31:41,535 --> 00:31:42,537
I have a ring.

619
00:31:42,576 --> 00:31:45,209
Oh, anyone coulda give you that.
Another lezzie coulda give you that.

620
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,154
You could be head of a coven of lezzies
masquerading as old married women.

621
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,930
Jesus!
Ripper, they're in the back!

622
00:31:49,961 --> 00:31:51,914
Oh, no! Oh, no!
They're my girls!

623
00:31:51,945 --> 00:31:53,141
Don't hurt them.

624
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:54,555
- Oh, no!
- What are they?

625
00:31:54,586 --> 00:31:55,728
They're dolls.

626
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,918
I make them for competitions.
They're very expensive.

627
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,173
Now, please.

628
00:31:59,205 --> 00:32:02,205
- Just get your dog off!
- Ripper, get off them.

629
00:32:02,461 --> 00:32:03,516
Oh, spun out.

630
00:32:03,541 --> 00:32:05,548
I thought they was wee dwarves
and you was their leader.

631
00:32:05,577 --> 00:32:07,845
I've won prizes for my dolls.

632
00:32:07,899 --> 00:32:09,017
Gawd!

633
00:32:09,056 --> 00:32:10,829
Look at them staring.
Cover them up.

634
00:32:10,863 --> 00:32:12,727
I'm gonna freak out!

635
00:32:15,971 --> 00:32:18,241
You scalped Jane for one of them,
didn't you?

636
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:21,483
Your own niece,
so as you could win prizes.

637
00:32:22,054 --> 00:32:23,858
I had Shirley's permission.

638
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,015
Oh, Shirley said you could
chop off her daughter's hair

639
00:32:26,038 --> 00:32:27,210
and put it on some bald doll.

640
00:32:27,252 --> 00:32:28,548
How do you know Shirley?

641
00:32:28,585 --> 00:32:30,322
Where is she?
What have you done with her?

642
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,751
She's in Wollongong.

643
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:32,954
Oh.

644
00:32:33,021 --> 00:32:35,650
Been to Wollongong before, has she?

645
00:32:37,885 --> 00:32:39,150
Yep.

646
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:41,939
I've been hearing a lot
about Shirley around here.

647
00:32:41,994 --> 00:32:43,533
None of it flattering.

648
00:32:43,579 --> 00:32:45,376
Sounds like she was a shocking housekeeper,

649
00:32:45,401 --> 00:32:47,626
but thought the world of her daughters,
is that right?

650
00:32:47,688 --> 00:32:49,564
It's hard to juggle a home and a family.

651
00:32:49,595 --> 00:32:52,220
I mean, I should know.
I have two children myself.

652
00:32:52,274 --> 00:32:53,579
Do you?

653
00:32:53,977 --> 00:32:56,884
Some children are less trouble
than others, I reckon?

654
00:32:56,978 --> 00:32:58,299
I was lucky.

655
00:32:58,431 --> 00:33:00,556
My children are naturally tidy.

656
00:33:00,635 --> 00:33:02,369
Quiet too, I bet.

657
00:33:02,603 --> 00:33:03,642
Well...

658
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,947
I was strict.

659
00:33:06,148 --> 00:33:07,861
But, children need that.

660
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:12,486
I posted a daily roster
of their responsibilities.

661
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,744
You sure you're Shirley's sister?

662
00:33:14,821 --> 00:33:16,884
We're ten years apart.

663
00:33:17,548 --> 00:33:19,454
I still think of Shirley as...

664
00:33:19,486 --> 00:33:22,712
the baby of the family, the one
who got away with everything.

665
00:33:23,152 --> 00:33:24,908
But, she's a dear thing,

666
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,353
with a sweet, trusting nature.

667
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,158
Yep.

668
00:33:29,454 --> 00:33:30,665
It's all coming together.

669
00:33:30,728 --> 00:33:33,251
The life of Shirley Moochmore.

670
00:33:35,562 --> 00:33:37,353
- Ripper!
- Oh!

671
00:33:37,797 --> 00:33:39,619
I understand you, Doris.

672
00:33:39,728 --> 00:33:40,869
And soon,

673
00:33:40,955 --> 00:33:42,494
you're gonna understand me.

674
00:33:42,546 --> 00:33:43,869
That sounds...

675
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,111
ominous.

676
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:47,165
You wouldn't know.

677
00:33:52,317 --> 00:33:53,575
- Oh!
- Oh.

678
00:33:56,341 --> 00:33:58,192
Oh, shit. It's a mask.

679
00:33:58,223 --> 00:33:59,395
Yes.

680
00:33:59,528 --> 00:34:00,997
Did I scream?

681
00:34:01,153 --> 00:34:02,231
Mm.

682
00:34:04,758 --> 00:34:07,261
Seen me feminine side, Coral.

683
00:34:09,266 --> 00:34:11,300
Girls like that, don't they?

684
00:34:11,825 --> 00:34:13,824
It turns you on, don't it?

685
00:34:14,525 --> 00:34:16,753
Oh, it turns me on.

686
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:21,609
I didn't think you liked me, Trout.

687
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:24,839
You let me see the sharks
after closing time, didn't ya?

688
00:34:24,964 --> 00:34:27,863
This is your reward.

689
00:34:28,722 --> 00:34:30,699
What do you like about me, Trout?

690
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,081
What?

691
00:34:32,462 --> 00:34:34,839
Uh, you're different.

692
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:36,558
How am I different?

693
00:34:36,589 --> 00:34:39,642
I dunno. It's hard to say.
You're missing something.

694
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:42,519
Or you got too much of it.
I don't know which.

695
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:45,777
Woo!

696
00:34:48,176 --> 00:34:49,730
Ow! Don't.

697
00:34:49,894 --> 00:34:51,730
- Oh, sorry.
- Oh!

698
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,683
- You OK?
- Uh-huh.

699
00:34:55,943 --> 00:34:57,131
What was that?

700
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,177
Did you, did you hear that?

701
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,756
Did you lock the door?

702
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:02,779
It's nothing.

703
00:35:04,045 --> 00:35:05,443
Trout, there's somebody here.

704
00:35:05,498 --> 00:35:07,037
No, no, Trout! Get off!

705
00:35:07,084 --> 00:35:08,435
No, get--

706
00:35:16,413 --> 00:35:18,950
- Are you OK?
- Uh-huh.

707
00:35:24,017 --> 00:35:25,426
Trout.

708
00:35:25,497 --> 00:35:27,739
I've temporarily paralyzed you.

709
00:35:28,301 --> 00:35:30,183
You'll be right in 20 seconds.

710
00:35:30,288 --> 00:35:31,997
While I got ya here,

711
00:35:32,116 --> 00:35:35,965
Coral is an employee of Trev Blundell's
Jaws of Terror shark show.

712
00:35:36,019 --> 00:35:38,980
And being Trev Blundell,
I look out for her.

713
00:35:39,122 --> 00:35:40,380
"No"...

714
00:35:40,473 --> 00:35:42,028
means no.

715
00:35:42,129 --> 00:35:45,207
Don't mean "maybe" or "more please".

716
00:35:45,392 --> 00:35:47,707
I've had a few conversations
with Coral and...

717
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,692
physically, she's all woman.

718
00:35:49,763 --> 00:35:51,715
Mentally, she's, uh...

719
00:35:52,747 --> 00:35:56,005
ill-equipped to part
with her girlhood right now.

720
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:58,028
I'm not saying never.

721
00:35:58,601 --> 00:36:00,731
Maybe, in a couple of years.

722
00:36:01,465 --> 00:36:03,450
You're OK now, Trout.

723
00:36:03,801 --> 00:36:05,371
Piss off.

724
00:36:19,856 --> 00:36:21,953
Trout's not right for you.

725
00:36:22,554 --> 00:36:24,249
I've been hunting sharks 40 years.

726
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:25,609
Seen his type before.

727
00:36:25,672 --> 00:36:27,859
All instinct, no feeling.

728
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:30,906
He craves, devours, moves on.

729
00:36:31,257 --> 00:36:33,085
Trout isn't a shark.

730
00:36:33,351 --> 00:36:36,031
- Boys aren't sharks.
- Everything is sharks.

731
00:36:36,077 --> 00:36:37,663
Life is sharks.

732
00:36:37,984 --> 00:36:40,371
100 million years ago,
when the dinosaurs lay dying,

733
00:36:40,411 --> 00:36:42,028
last thing they saw were sharks...

734
00:36:42,106 --> 00:36:43,802
laughing at them.

735
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,825
That's the last thing we'll see too.

736
00:36:50,137 --> 00:36:52,262
I'm quitting my job
because I think you're mental.

737
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,082
Mental is a shark.

738
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:56,411
- It is not.
- It is.

739
00:36:57,395 --> 00:37:00,223
I expect to be schizophrenic any day now.

740
00:37:00,282 --> 00:37:02,918
And none of my research mentions sharks...

741
00:37:03,053 --> 00:37:04,184
ever.

742
00:37:04,242 --> 00:37:06,006
Is that right? Mm.

743
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,340
I've been in a lunatic asylum.

744
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,929
Five years ago,
after me daughter died,

745
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,960
and me wife lost her mind.

746
00:37:14,596 --> 00:37:17,890
I've battled insanity,
and it's a shark.

747
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:19,936
Circles your boat,

748
00:37:20,203 --> 00:37:22,186
waiting for you to fall.

749
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:25,455
You can't see it, but it's there.

750
00:37:26,363 --> 00:37:28,499
You know that feeling, Coral?

751
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:31,593
Because if you don't,
I can show it to you.

752
00:37:57,311 --> 00:37:59,583
They have us surrounded, Coral.

753
00:38:02,031 --> 00:38:03,419
Madness...

754
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:05,317
is when you see them.

755
00:38:10,737 --> 00:38:12,394
Sanity.

756
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:17,277
Insanity.

757
00:38:19,345 --> 00:38:21,879
Don't dream of madness, Coral.

758
00:38:22,052 --> 00:38:23,832
When madness gets you,

759
00:38:23,934 --> 00:38:25,996
there's no 'you' left.

760
00:38:26,558 --> 00:38:28,355
Just madness.

761
00:38:30,351 --> 00:38:32,668
What if it's too late?

762
00:38:34,611 --> 00:38:38,790
I tried to kill myself when I was 13
by jumping off the verandah.

763
00:38:38,884 --> 00:38:41,321
Because I'm ugly and I'm abnormal.

764
00:38:41,405 --> 00:38:44,720
And my mum's in the loony bin,
my sister talks to aliens,

765
00:38:44,754 --> 00:38:47,079
and my dad hates us.

766
00:38:49,884 --> 00:38:53,618
Even me being here
talking to you isn't normal.

767
00:38:55,001 --> 00:38:56,580
Look at you.

768
00:38:56,743 --> 00:38:57,954
You're old,

769
00:38:58,001 --> 00:39:00,454
you have weird scars.

770
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:04,438
And what do you want
to be with me for, anyway?

771
00:39:14,335 --> 00:39:16,425
You remind me of someone.

772
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,528
Don't lose yourself, Coral.

773
00:39:22,295 --> 00:39:24,678
I know it don't seem like much...

774
00:39:26,908 --> 00:39:28,785
but it's all you got.

775
00:39:36,761 --> 00:39:38,250
♪ <i>Crazy</i> ♪

776
00:39:38,305 --> 00:39:40,071
- That's very inappropriate, Karen.
- ♪ All ♪

777
00:39:40,141 --> 00:39:45,789
- Very inappropriate.
- ♪ <i>Crazy for feeling so lonely</i> ♪

778
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:48,877
Well, it's not a really romantic story.

779
00:39:48,971 --> 00:39:51,385
Well, there's a romantic bit in it.

780
00:39:51,565 --> 00:39:55,776
Uh, Barry was 25 and I was 24. And...

781
00:39:55,877 --> 00:39:58,471
on our second date,
he sort of raped me.

782
00:39:58,518 --> 00:39:59,768
Mm.

783
00:39:59,799 --> 00:40:02,174
Date rape I suppose you'd call it now.

784
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:05,588
Yeah. On the terrace
of the Dolphin Heads Casino.

785
00:40:05,832 --> 00:40:07,877
Well, he'd had a bit to drink and...

786
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:10,198
suddenly he was all over me.

787
00:40:10,316 --> 00:40:13,159
And I'm there going:
"No, no," like you do.

788
00:40:13,776 --> 00:40:17,182
But, you know how men are,
they just go with the ﬂow, don't they?

789
00:40:17,737 --> 00:40:19,307
Anyway, next day, I said to myself,

790
00:40:19,338 --> 00:40:22,745
"Shirley, if he doesn't call you
in three weeks, you're a slut."

791
00:40:23,604 --> 00:40:25,128
Of course, before three weeks was up,

792
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:27,870
I found out I was pregnant
with Coral and--

793
00:40:28,397 --> 00:40:30,175
But, he did call me.

794
00:40:30,331 --> 00:40:31,667
Yeah.

795
00:40:31,909 --> 00:40:33,876
That's the romantic bit.

796
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,118
Mm.

797
00:40:35,251 --> 00:40:38,149
Boy, did he get a surprise.

798
00:40:40,475 --> 00:40:43,545
I suppose you think that's
a bad foundation for a marriage...

799
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,991
rape.

800
00:40:45,295 --> 00:40:46,991
I've heard worse.

801
00:40:47,238 --> 00:40:48,506
Have you?

802
00:40:48,561 --> 00:40:50,772
- I've lived worse.
- Have you?

803
00:40:50,834 --> 00:40:52,530
You wouldn't know.

804
00:40:52,662 --> 00:40:56,420
See, you're not like my other doctors,
because you tell me stuff.

805
00:40:56,445 --> 00:40:58,787
Keep your voice down, Shirley.
I don't want them stealing me techniques.

806
00:40:58,813 --> 00:41:01,018
So, do you think I use food
as an emotional crutch?

807
00:41:01,057 --> 00:41:02,557
- Nup.
- What about waterfalls?

808
00:41:02,592 --> 00:41:04,362
- What about waterfalls?
- Well, Dr. Kurland says,

809
00:41:04,388 --> 00:41:06,362
when I feel overwhelmed,
I should think of them.

810
00:41:06,393 --> 00:41:07,440
Bullshit.

811
00:41:07,477 --> 00:41:11,021
What are these doctors doing about
the daily misery that is your life?

812
00:41:11,092 --> 00:41:13,854
Close your eyes and imagine this...

813
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:17,713
a giant tumor eating your brain.

814
00:41:18,705 --> 00:41:20,651
You go into a hospital filled with doctors,

815
00:41:20,691 --> 00:41:23,783
experts on brain-eating tumors,
and what do they do?

816
00:41:23,921 --> 00:41:27,002
Brush your hair over the bulge,
so no-one can see it and send you home.

817
00:41:27,052 --> 00:41:30,291
But, what you need
is someone to cut out the tumor,

818
00:41:30,348 --> 00:41:32,377
so you can live.

819
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:34,198
Shaz.

820
00:41:34,916 --> 00:41:37,815
Oh, no! Sandra!

821
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:39,494
Gaw! Spun out!

822
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:42,033
What are you doing in here,
you mad boong?

823
00:41:42,157 --> 00:41:44,815
Oh, they reckon I've got
borderline personality disorder.

824
00:41:44,846 --> 00:41:46,862
Borderline fucking personality!

825
00:41:46,905 --> 00:41:49,502
What the fuck do they know
about my fucking personality?

826
00:41:49,527 --> 00:41:50,541
Fucking nothing!

827
00:41:50,584 --> 00:41:52,448
- I'm still vibrant.
- Oh.

828
00:41:52,479 --> 00:41:55,401
Too vibrant for some, eh, Shaz?

829
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:57,627
Do you remember?

830
00:42:01,588 --> 00:42:02,724
Shut up.

831
00:42:02,755 --> 00:42:03,895
I admit, I admit,

832
00:42:03,927 --> 00:42:06,107
I had a bit too much to drink,
got a bit outta hand.

833
00:42:06,153 --> 00:42:07,200
Don't remember, anyway.

834
00:42:07,248 --> 00:42:09,356
Bit of a punch-up, bit of a committal,
and here I am.

835
00:42:09,403 --> 00:42:11,067
Yeah, they got Shirley in here too.

836
00:42:11,122 --> 00:42:12,692
Fuck, no! Shirley?

837
00:42:12,726 --> 00:42:14,497
- You in here too?
- Mm.

838
00:42:14,633 --> 00:42:15,950
Who are ya?

839
00:42:16,007 --> 00:42:17,560
Shirley...

840
00:42:17,951 --> 00:42:19,497
Moochmore.

841
00:42:19,789 --> 00:42:23,231
What a stupid fucking name!
No wonder, they put you away.

842
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,534
- Aw.
- Aw, sorry.

843
00:42:27,724 --> 00:42:30,643
Eh, she's great, this one.
Has she taken you under her wing?

844
00:42:30,675 --> 00:42:31,799
Yep.

845
00:42:31,862 --> 00:42:33,229
Shirley's me project.

846
00:42:33,299 --> 00:42:36,909
Are, are you one of Dr. Thornbender's
patients as well?

847
00:42:42,077 --> 00:42:43,452
Yep.

848
00:42:43,646 --> 00:42:45,171
And I love her.

849
00:42:45,299 --> 00:42:47,835
And I don't like whities,
as a rule, but Shaz...

850
00:42:47,921 --> 00:42:49,281
Shaz isn't white.

851
00:42:49,337 --> 00:42:51,016
She's a new color.

852
00:42:51,524 --> 00:42:52,610
She's mauve.

853
00:42:52,665 --> 00:42:53,844
Gaw.

854
00:42:53,869 --> 00:42:56,563
It's true, Shaz. You're mauve.
You're fucking mauve!

855
00:42:56,624 --> 00:42:58,376
Now, Shaz knows.

856
00:42:59,261 --> 00:43:00,899
She knows.

857
00:43:01,084 --> 00:43:03,883
She's gonna change your fucking life.

858
00:43:04,643 --> 00:43:06,985
That's the impression I get.

859
00:43:09,021 --> 00:43:11,953
The problem with you two
is you let people say you're crazy.

860
00:43:12,008 --> 00:43:14,024
You're only as crazy as
you let people say you are.

861
00:43:14,055 --> 00:43:16,211
I don't let anyone say I'm crazy,
so I'm normal.

862
00:43:16,246 --> 00:43:19,081
Youse, you let everyone say you're crazy,
so you're in here.

863
00:43:19,169 --> 00:43:20,180
Dr. Kurland--

864
00:43:20,211 --> 00:43:22,524
I don't care what them doctors say, Shirl.

865
00:43:22,648 --> 00:43:24,391
What do you say?

866
00:43:24,813 --> 00:43:26,196
Are you crazy?

867
00:43:26,243 --> 00:43:28,125
I don't cope well.

868
00:43:29,687 --> 00:43:32,836
There's ways of coping that
don't involve loony bins and drugs.

869
00:43:32,887 --> 00:43:35,094
There's offensive and defensive coping.

870
00:43:35,135 --> 00:43:37,000
I've always favoured offensive meself.

871
00:43:37,048 --> 00:43:38,633
You might say I invented it.

872
00:43:38,707 --> 00:43:41,076
But, I'm gonna get you out of here, Shirl.

873
00:43:41,313 --> 00:43:42,685
But first,

874
00:43:42,811 --> 00:43:45,365
we gotta deal with them
tumors of yours.

875
00:43:49,681 --> 00:43:50,695
Rise and shine!

876
00:43:50,735 --> 00:43:53,711
We got mountains to climb,
starting now.

877
00:43:54,016 --> 00:43:58,102
- Give us the mechanical man.
- I don't have the mechanical man!

878
00:43:58,149 --> 00:43:59,211
Forget about that.

879
00:43:59,251 --> 00:44:01,156
You're never gonna give them
the mechanical man

880
00:44:01,187 --> 00:44:03,078
because you're not a character
in Lost In Space.

881
00:44:03,117 --> 00:44:05,422
Now, get up and get dressed.

882
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:10,280
You think Noxious Nance
has climbed this mountain?

883
00:44:10,337 --> 00:44:13,171
Of course not. She's too busy
scrubbing her driveway.

884
00:44:13,216 --> 00:44:15,719
This takes guts and perseverance.

885
00:44:17,046 --> 00:44:19,428
Do you reckon Auntie Doris
has climbed this mountain?

886
00:44:19,476 --> 00:44:21,256
She doesn't even know it's here.

887
00:44:21,304 --> 00:44:24,522
You gotta believe in yourselves, girls,
and each other.

888
00:44:26,499 --> 00:44:28,978
I can't go any further.
I won't.

889
00:44:29,009 --> 00:44:31,821
You don't get to the top of this mountain,
Coral, then you're nothing.

890
00:44:31,853 --> 00:44:33,110
Just like they say you are.

891
00:44:33,142 --> 00:44:35,985
What's the point of getting
to the top, anyway?

892
00:44:36,023 --> 00:44:37,868
Not being at the bottom.

893
00:44:40,025 --> 00:44:41,970
- Oh!
- Push, push, push!

894
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:43,493
Come on, girls! That's it!

895
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:45,673
- Almost there.
- I can't do it.

896
00:44:45,728 --> 00:44:47,892
- Come on, Michelle.
- Come on, move!

897
00:44:47,923 --> 00:44:49,821
Come on, Michelle! Just move it!

898
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:52,485
- I can't!
- We're all waiting here!

899
00:44:52,517 --> 00:44:54,556
Jane, Coral. Get in behind her
and give her a push.

900
00:44:54,587 --> 00:44:55,689
I can't!

901
00:44:55,729 --> 00:44:57,346
Coral, push.

902
00:44:57,502 --> 00:44:58,923
Push, Coral!

903
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:02,165
She's too heavy!

904
00:45:02,217 --> 00:45:05,657
She's not heavy, she's your sister!

905
00:45:05,704 --> 00:45:07,791
One, two, three.

906
00:45:12,699 --> 00:45:14,066
Whoa!

907
00:45:14,814 --> 00:45:16,691
That's it, Michelle.

908
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:18,949
- Yeah!
- Woo!

909
00:45:30,133 --> 00:45:31,995
I'm ﬂying!

910
00:45:32,089 --> 00:45:33,698
Woo-hoo!

911
00:45:45,922 --> 00:45:47,406
Everybody,

912
00:45:47,695 --> 00:45:49,148
pick up a rock.

913
00:45:53,393 --> 00:45:56,227
One day, this rock's gonna
mean something to you.

914
00:45:58,761 --> 00:46:01,329
You might lose the only thing
you ever loved,

915
00:46:01,476 --> 00:46:03,345
or that ever loved you.

916
00:46:03,915 --> 00:46:06,063
But, you're gonna look at this rock...

917
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:08,805
and you're gonna say,
"I can take it,

918
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:11,102
because I climbed the mountain."

919
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,422
This is where they live.

920
00:46:17,003 --> 00:46:18,899
It's where the voices live.

921
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:23,641
Can hear them clearer up here.

922
00:46:25,498 --> 00:46:27,086
They're singing.

923
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:30,727
They're happy.

924
00:46:32,649 --> 00:46:35,548
They was from Lost In Space,
wasn't they, Shaz?

925
00:46:35,688 --> 00:46:36,719
Yeah.

926
00:46:36,774 --> 00:46:38,243
Knew as soon as I heard you.

927
00:46:38,336 --> 00:46:40,735
"Give us the mechanical man."

928
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,376
Great episode.

929
00:46:42,453 --> 00:46:45,422
Of course, not as great as the episode
where Dr. Smith turns into a tree,

930
00:46:45,465 --> 00:46:47,407
but you can't have everything.

931
00:46:48,884 --> 00:46:50,688
You're onto them now, Michelle.

932
00:46:50,753 --> 00:46:53,524
They're gonna have
to think of something else.

933
00:46:54,754 --> 00:46:56,688
None of youse are mental.

934
00:46:57,485 --> 00:46:59,008
Except you, Michelle.

935
00:46:59,118 --> 00:47:01,305
You're bonkers.
But, the rest of youse?

936
00:47:02,618 --> 00:47:03,633
Nah.

937
00:47:03,691 --> 00:47:05,672
But, if we're not mental,

938
00:47:06,132 --> 00:47:07,829
we're just unpopular.

939
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:10,942
I'll show you the meaning
of the word "mental".

940
00:47:10,997 --> 00:47:13,254
Page 354.

941
00:47:14,223 --> 00:47:16,926
- "Obsessive compulsive disorder."
- Yeah, that's her.

942
00:47:16,969 --> 00:47:19,949
"Stubborn, stingy, possessive,
uncreative and unimaginative,

943
00:47:19,977 --> 00:47:24,145
devoted to meaningless activities
that require being tidy and meticulous.'

944
00:47:24,261 --> 00:47:25,699
- It is her.
- Yeah.

945
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:28,020
They're all in there,
the whole neighbourhood.

946
00:47:28,067 --> 00:47:29,481
See that delusional over there?

947
00:47:29,512 --> 00:47:31,630
He mowed the same strip
of grass yesterday.

948
00:47:31,661 --> 00:47:33,106
He can't help himself.

949
00:47:36,192 --> 00:47:38,215
Look!Look!
Look at him! Look!

950
00:47:38,473 --> 00:47:42,746
Oh, upset the delicate balance of
their fantasy world, they go nuts.

951
00:47:42,801 --> 00:47:45,614
- But, they can't all be mental.
- What are the odds of that?

952
00:47:46,733 --> 00:47:50,475
Youse have stumbled on the meaning
of life and you don't even know it!

953
00:47:50,866 --> 00:47:52,233
America.

954
00:47:52,296 --> 00:47:53,506
Europe.

955
00:47:53,546 --> 00:47:54,648
Asia.

956
00:47:54,702 --> 00:47:57,342
And all the way down here is Australia.

957
00:47:57,390 --> 00:47:58,562
Alone.

958
00:47:58,624 --> 00:48:00,108
Isolated.

959
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,686
Ever wonder why?

960
00:48:01,765 --> 00:48:03,687
Why we're down here?

961
00:48:04,608 --> 00:48:05,889
Well,

962
00:48:05,952 --> 00:48:08,233
we were a penal colony.

963
00:48:08,296 --> 00:48:10,069
Well, that's the cover story, yeah.

964
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:13,171
But, historically, where have
they always sent the loonies?

965
00:48:13,225 --> 00:48:15,460
As far away as possible.

966
00:48:15,499 --> 00:48:17,428
You can't get any further away
than Australia.

967
00:48:17,475 --> 00:48:19,866
We weren't a penal colony.
We was a lunatic asylum.

968
00:48:19,891 --> 00:48:22,569
Our ancestors were loonies,
and this is the result.

969
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:25,405
Well, have a look around.
There's no such thing as normal.

970
00:48:25,448 --> 00:48:27,121
It's just different shades of mental.

971
00:48:27,169 --> 00:48:29,639
Your totally mental are
in the lunatic asylums.

972
00:48:29,678 --> 00:48:30,944
The rest of them are...

973
00:48:31,015 --> 00:48:34,116
the delusionals,
borderlines, compulsives,

974
00:48:34,225 --> 00:48:37,335
paranoids, schizoids,
make up Australia as we know it.

975
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:41,052
We're nothing but a living experiment
in madness under constant observation

976
00:48:41,077 --> 00:48:43,883
by the psychiatric community of the world.

977
00:48:44,882 --> 00:48:46,194
But,

978
00:48:46,717 --> 00:48:50,381
if we're all under observation,
and mental,

979
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:53,229
how come we're allowed to leave?

980
00:48:53,354 --> 00:48:55,553
Kylie Minogue. She left.

981
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,225
She's practically British.

982
00:48:57,264 --> 00:49:00,116
In any experiment,
there's test mice and control mice.

983
00:49:00,186 --> 00:49:02,288
Control mice are marked in some way

984
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:04,491
and sent off into the normal world
as comparisons.

985
00:49:04,538 --> 00:49:06,092
Kylie Minogue's a control mouse.

986
00:49:06,131 --> 00:49:07,866
Cate Blanchett, control mouse.

987
00:49:07,905 --> 00:49:10,405
Russell Crowe,
a control mouse outta control.

988
00:49:10,475 --> 00:49:13,944
Rupert Murdoch, Nicole Kidman.
The list of control mice is endless.

989
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:15,264
What about you, Shaz?

990
00:49:15,304 --> 00:49:17,014
What about me?

991
00:49:17,626 --> 00:49:19,944
Do you know the meaning
of the word "conformity"?

992
00:49:20,069 --> 00:49:21,116
I don't.

993
00:49:21,171 --> 00:49:23,296
I instinctively do not know it.

994
00:49:23,374 --> 00:49:24,999
And that's how they knew about me.

995
00:49:25,054 --> 00:49:26,788
Knew about me from birth.

996
00:49:26,913 --> 00:49:29,382
They been after me ever since.

997
00:49:29,444 --> 00:49:31,608
- Who's after you?
- Scientists.

998
00:49:31,819 --> 00:49:33,366
After me brain.

999
00:49:33,444 --> 00:49:34,928
They want to study me,

1000
00:49:34,999 --> 00:49:37,218
clone me, or prevent me
from happening again.

1001
00:49:37,243 --> 00:49:38,749
I don't know which.
I'm not psychic.

1002
00:49:38,796 --> 00:49:40,702
Luckily, Ripper is.

1003
00:49:40,757 --> 00:49:43,015
He warns me when
they're getting too close.

1004
00:49:43,093 --> 00:49:45,499
And I understand why
they're scared of me.

1005
00:49:45,553 --> 00:49:48,046
I'm the next step to human evolution.

1006
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,749
A next step to perfection.

1007
00:49:50,882 --> 00:49:52,835
And they don't want me building an army.

1008
00:49:52,882 --> 00:49:53,915
What army?

1009
00:49:53,955 --> 00:49:55,189
An army of me.

1010
00:49:55,236 --> 00:49:57,694
Because I can see the ones
who are like me,

1011
00:49:57,763 --> 00:50:00,663
born without the instinct of conformity.

1012
00:50:00,893 --> 00:50:03,142
That's what led me to Dolphin Heads.

1013
00:50:03,206 --> 00:50:05,853
You think it was an accident
you dad stopped for me?

1014
00:50:05,931 --> 00:50:07,150
He had to.

1015
00:50:07,205 --> 00:50:08,986
It was his destiny.

1016
00:50:09,085 --> 00:50:11,439
- Dad's like you.
- No.

1017
00:50:12,251 --> 00:50:13,923
Youse are.

1018
00:50:14,175 --> 00:50:16,343
Youse are me army.

1019
00:50:16,554 --> 00:50:18,673
Youse are next steps,

1020
00:50:18,736 --> 00:50:23,392
but crushed into unrecognizability
by the forces of conformity.

1021
00:50:23,454 --> 00:50:25,376
There you go, Michelle.

1022
00:50:25,486 --> 00:50:29,032
A jam and cream doughnut on the house.

1023
00:50:29,722 --> 00:50:32,001
I didn't want a jam and cream doughnut.

1024
00:50:32,056 --> 00:50:34,876
Oh, you sound just like your mum
when you say that.

1025
00:50:34,907 --> 00:50:36,292
She's always telling us,

1026
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:38,847
she doesn't want the jam
and cream doughnuts too,

1027
00:50:38,884 --> 00:50:42,095
then she shovels them down
like there's no tomorrow.

1028
00:50:42,157 --> 00:50:43,722
Doesn't she, Kay?

1029
00:50:43,808 --> 00:50:45,683
We love your mum.

1030
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:49,214
We call her Mrs. Moo.

1031
00:50:49,595 --> 00:50:51,378
Where is she these days?

1032
00:50:51,441 --> 00:50:53,964
She's in Wollongong,
on holiday.

1033
00:50:54,011 --> 00:50:55,870
Having a rest, is she?

1034
00:50:55,918 --> 00:50:57,551
Nice long rest?

1035
00:50:57,730 --> 00:50:59,152
Well, I believe you.

1036
00:50:59,246 --> 00:51:00,886
Thousands wouldn't.

1037
00:51:01,269 --> 00:51:03,613
Now, how about the rest of you Moos?

1038
00:51:03,714 --> 00:51:05,566
Are you ready for seconds?

1039
00:51:05,614 --> 00:51:07,902
She's in a mental institution.

1040
00:51:08,192 --> 00:51:10,277
She had a nervous breakdown.

1041
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,277
Get too much for her, did it?

1042
00:51:12,358 --> 00:51:14,089
Mm, you might say that.

1043
00:51:14,177 --> 00:51:16,409
You might say this place broke her spirit.

1044
00:51:16,463 --> 00:51:17,706
Dolphin Heads?

1045
00:51:17,761 --> 00:51:20,105
Nah. Best town in the world.

1046
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:21,964
- That right?
- Yeah.

1047
00:51:22,066 --> 00:51:25,019
If she gone crazy,
it won't be Dolphin Heads.

1048
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:28,753
Something closer to home, I reckon.

1049
00:51:30,436 --> 00:51:32,577
What's your name, sweetheart?

1050
00:51:32,632 --> 00:51:34,108
Manda.

1051
00:51:34,226 --> 00:51:36,023
I'm the manageress.

1052
00:51:36,108 --> 00:51:37,303
This is Kay.

1053
00:51:37,389 --> 00:51:38,624
Manda,

1054
00:51:38,694 --> 00:51:41,022
we just been reading about you, Manda.

1055
00:51:41,062 --> 00:51:42,187
Haven't we, girls?

1056
00:51:42,225 --> 00:51:43,663
Right here, in me book.

1057
00:51:43,702 --> 00:51:44,742
What book's that?

1058
00:51:44,796 --> 00:51:46,538
Oh, it's kinda like the Bible,

1059
00:51:46,593 --> 00:51:48,515
except more about Australia than heaven.

1060
00:51:48,561 --> 00:51:51,991
Here youse are.
Page 369. Can you read that?

1061
00:51:52,171 --> 00:51:55,421
"Sadistic personality disorder."

1062
00:51:55,468 --> 00:51:56,780
No, not that bit.

1063
00:51:56,842 --> 00:51:58,866
The underlined bit.

1064
00:52:00,874 --> 00:52:01,999
Oh! Oh!

1065
00:52:02,024 --> 00:52:05,626
You think these jam and cream doughnuts
are so fucking great, you eat them!

1066
00:52:05,843 --> 00:52:08,686
I think young Kay wants
a jam and cream doughnut, girls.

1067
00:52:08,711 --> 00:52:10,001
What do you think?

1068
00:52:10,077 --> 00:52:13,983
Little career advice, psychos,
the customer is always right!

1069
00:52:14,014 --> 00:52:15,888
If the Moos don't want
jam and cream doughnuts,

1070
00:52:15,913 --> 00:52:18,850
they don't get jam and cream doughnuts!

1071
00:52:23,183 --> 00:52:26,089
They are out to get you Moochmores.

1072
00:52:26,128 --> 00:52:27,894
And these bitches are ruthless.

1073
00:52:27,949 --> 00:52:29,676
They declared war.

1074
00:52:29,753 --> 00:52:31,902
Well, we got one thing on our side,

1075
00:52:31,988 --> 00:52:34,402
they're crazy and we're not.

1076
00:52:37,442 --> 00:52:39,973
That was fantastic!

1077
00:52:46,524 --> 00:52:51,478
Manda and Kay lying on the ground,
jam and cream on their naked face.

1078
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,782
Got your doubts,

1079
00:52:53,908 --> 00:52:55,501
haven't you, Coral?

1080
00:52:58,253 --> 00:53:00,786
I want to believe you, Shaz, but...

1081
00:53:00,888 --> 00:53:03,224
I'm not perfect.

1082
00:53:03,589 --> 00:53:05,161
Look at me.

1083
00:53:06,143 --> 00:53:07,825
I'm ugly,

1084
00:53:08,615 --> 00:53:10,138
awkward, and...

1085
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,372
unpopular.

1086
00:53:11,429 --> 00:53:13,997
That's proof of your perfection.

1087
00:53:14,378 --> 00:53:16,497
They want you to hate yourself, Coral.

1088
00:53:16,565 --> 00:53:18,740
That way, they control you.

1089
00:53:18,927 --> 00:53:20,622
And when they control you,

1090
00:53:20,677 --> 00:53:22,115
they've robbed you of your power.

1091
00:53:22,146 --> 00:53:23,193
What power?

1092
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:26,357
A doctor once told me
I had six months to live.

1093
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,271
I took out me knife,

1094
00:53:28,318 --> 00:53:31,658
held it to his throat and I said,
"You take it back."

1095
00:53:31,893 --> 00:53:33,779
He took it back.

1096
00:53:34,598 --> 00:53:35,810
And I lived.

1097
00:53:35,849 --> 00:53:37,990
- I couldn't do that.
- Nah, you could.

1098
00:53:38,032 --> 00:53:41,271
- I couldn't pull a knife on anyone.
- Nah, you don't need the knife.

1099
00:53:41,857 --> 00:53:44,154
You're stronger than I am.

1100
00:53:44,825 --> 00:53:46,521
Shut up.

1101
00:53:48,776 --> 00:53:52,615
Take enough pain and humiliation,
and a part of you dies.

1102
00:53:53,769 --> 00:53:55,865
But the part that's left,

1103
00:53:56,013 --> 00:53:58,279
it can't be hurt no more.

1104
00:53:58,602 --> 00:54:01,479
I call that a State of Shaz.

1105
00:54:01,763 --> 00:54:05,427
I am beyond pain and humiliation.

1106
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:09,372
I am the avenging angel
of the perpetually humiliated.

1107
00:54:09,414 --> 00:54:10,935
I'll save you, Coral.

1108
00:54:10,974 --> 00:54:14,335
I'll save your whole family.
I'll make you strong.

1109
00:54:14,524 --> 00:54:16,185
And in return,

1110
00:54:16,381 --> 00:54:18,662
you make me whole.

1111
00:54:18,966 --> 00:54:20,200
How?

1112
00:54:22,699 --> 00:54:24,107
Start by answering the door.

1113
00:54:24,162 --> 00:54:25,771
The cops are here.

1114
00:54:26,536 --> 00:54:28,029
You got a choice.

1115
00:54:28,099 --> 00:54:30,013
Things can either stay the way they are...

1116
00:54:30,099 --> 00:54:31,966
or you can fight back.

1117
00:54:36,685 --> 00:54:39,710
So, did this woman say anything to you?

1118
00:54:39,757 --> 00:54:40,703
No.

1119
00:54:40,742 --> 00:54:41,967
- Yes.
- No.

1120
00:54:41,998 --> 00:54:43,060
- Yes.
- No.

1121
00:54:43,091 --> 00:54:44,140
- No.
- No.

1122
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,523
- No?
- No, she didn't.

1123
00:54:45,576 --> 00:54:46,875
No.

1124
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:49,640
Did she?

1125
00:54:51,617 --> 00:54:53,117
Um...

1126
00:54:54,843 --> 00:54:59,132
She said we were the next steps
in, um, human evolution.

1127
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:01,531
The next steps to perfection.

1128
00:55:02,035 --> 00:55:04,406
- What, you lot?
- Yeah.

1129
00:55:12,323 --> 00:55:13,544
Oh!

1130
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,357
Oh, your poor dad.

1131
00:55:15,407 --> 00:55:18,748
Look, show them this,
so we can get outta here.

1132
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:24,151
- Is this supposed to be her?
- Yes.

1133
00:55:24,315 --> 00:55:26,401
According to six eyewitnesses.

1134
00:55:26,444 --> 00:55:27,986
Well, they're wrong.

1135
00:55:28,097 --> 00:55:29,753
Her hair wasn't brown.

1136
00:55:29,815 --> 00:55:31,433
It was blonde.

1137
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:32,737
Blonde?

1138
00:55:32,948 --> 00:55:36,451
And she wasn't 5-foot.
She was 6-foot.

1139
00:55:36,476 --> 00:55:38,279
- Yep, she was really tall.
- She was tall.

1140
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:39,920
- Really--
- And her eyes weren't blue.

1141
00:55:39,951 --> 00:55:41,006
They were brown.

1142
00:55:41,053 --> 00:55:45,159
- B-Brown eyes?
- Um, and she was Chinese.

1143
00:55:47,936 --> 00:55:48,975
Yep.

1144
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:50,303
That's right.

1145
00:55:50,404 --> 00:55:52,076
She was Chinese.

1146
00:55:52,143 --> 00:55:55,514
- Was she all Chinese?
- Except for the French bits.

1147
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:14,099
Remember that fucking awful
white racist shit song...

1148
00:56:14,124 --> 00:56:16,379
by them fat ugly white racist
bastards in the '60s...

1149
00:56:16,419 --> 00:56:17,762
My Boomerang Won't Come Back?

1150
00:56:17,809 --> 00:56:20,153
Well, my boomerang won't come back.

1151
00:56:20,231 --> 00:56:22,171

Nance, Sandra.
Sandra, Nance.

1159
00:56:33,846 --> 00:56:34,868
G'day. Sandra MacDonald,

1160
00:56:34,893 --> 00:56:37,530
a Goorie from Bundjalung Nation
via Dolphin Heads lunatic asylum.

1161
00:56:37,555 --> 00:56:39,481
Yeah, I've been telling Sandra
all about you, Nance.

1162
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:40,903
Told her you was warts-n-all honest.

1163
00:56:40,933 --> 00:56:43,388
- Especially the warts.
- Jesus! Look at the size of this one.

1164
00:56:43,413 --> 00:56:44,762
- Who are you, love?
- It's Donna.

1165
00:56:44,798 --> 00:56:47,082
- You gonna invite us in, Donna?
- No!

1166
00:56:47,169 --> 00:56:48,333
No, I can't!

1167
00:56:48,387 --> 00:56:50,051
I've just shampooed the carpets.

1168
00:56:50,114 --> 00:56:52,356
Oh, what about my boomerang?

1169
00:56:52,974 --> 00:56:54,723
I'll get it.

1170
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:56,520
You just stay here.

1171
00:56:57,491 --> 00:57:00,460
You all stay here!

1172
00:57:12,373 --> 00:57:14,100
How do you like it?

1173
00:57:14,922 --> 00:57:16,924
Sweet and white.

1174
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:19,717
You alright there, love?

1175
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:21,967
Sit down.

1176
00:57:24,734 --> 00:57:26,666
Excuse me.

1177
00:57:27,655 --> 00:57:29,947
Did I invite you inside?

1178
00:57:30,003 --> 00:57:31,627
Oh, Donna's making us tea.

1179
00:57:31,674 --> 00:57:32,971
She's a credit to you, Nance.

1180
00:57:33,014 --> 00:57:34,713
She's got great legs too.

1181
00:57:34,744 --> 00:57:37,150
Hey, Donna, stretch them hamstrings.

1182
00:57:37,424 --> 00:57:40,142
See that, Shaz?
Fucking amazing.

1183
00:57:40,189 --> 00:57:41,541
Donna!

1184
00:57:41,712 --> 00:57:44,079
Put that away.

1185
00:57:45,291 --> 00:57:46,447
Get out!

1186
00:57:46,502 --> 00:57:47,588
Go on.

1187
00:57:47,627 --> 00:57:48,760
Mum.

1188
00:57:48,814 --> 00:57:49,892
Here.

1189
00:57:49,932 --> 00:57:51,627
Here's what you came for.
Go on.

1190
00:57:51,729 --> 00:57:53,627
Off you go. Shoo!

1191
00:57:53,838 --> 00:57:56,775
- You're being rude, Mum.
- No, no, don't worry, Donna.

1192
00:57:56,837 --> 00:57:58,744
This is more than a social visit.

1193
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:00,580
It's an intervention.

1194
00:58:00,752 --> 00:58:01,877
Nance,

1195
00:58:01,916 --> 00:58:05,510
you're obsessive compulsive disorder,
and a nasty, gossiping bitch to boot.

1196
00:58:05,549 --> 00:58:07,400
You need help and we're here to help you.

1197
00:58:07,431 --> 00:58:09,603
You can't control the world
with cleanliness and order.

1198
00:58:09,635 --> 00:58:11,684
Life's not like that.
Life's mess.

1199
00:58:11,723 --> 00:58:14,129
Oozing, ﬂowing, dripping mess.

1200
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,346
Sure, you can keep your house
looking' like a science lab...

1201
00:58:16,371 --> 00:58:18,309
and you can have Donna here
acting like a nun with a netball,

1202
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:21,144
but what are you gonna do
when life busts in?

1203
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,645
And you, Nance,

1204
00:58:22,684 --> 00:58:25,442
you're ﬂesh and blood,
sweat and piss.

1205
00:58:25,487 --> 00:58:28,106
You're a woman, Nance, not Tupperware.

1206
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:29,676
Nah, we can't leave you.

1207
00:58:29,731 --> 00:58:31,473
This is an emergency.

1208
00:58:31,933 --> 00:58:35,621
- I'm calling the police.
- Nah, not a police emergency.

1209
00:58:35,707 --> 00:58:37,871
A feminine emergency.

1210
00:58:38,028 --> 00:58:39,944
You got any pads?

1211
00:58:41,358 --> 00:58:43,200
- What?
- You know?

1212
00:58:43,341 --> 00:58:44,778
Pads.

1213
00:58:46,285 --> 00:58:47,739
Writing pads?

1214
00:58:47,807 --> 00:58:49,356
Sanitary pads.

1215
00:58:49,466 --> 00:58:51,356
Preferably Maxi.

1216
00:58:52,405 --> 00:58:53,897
- For who?
- All of us.

1217
00:58:53,944 --> 00:58:55,296
Actually, yeah.

1218
00:58:55,335 --> 00:58:58,374
You know how women living
in close proximity line up menstrually?

1219
00:58:58,405 --> 00:58:59,647
Something to do with the moon.

1220
00:58:59,695 --> 00:59:01,851
Well, we've all lined up,
haven't we, girls?

1221
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:04,608
Right here, in your lounge room.

1222
00:59:05,785 --> 00:59:09,043
I'm having an emergency
on your white couch.

1223
00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:10,660
Me too.

1224
00:59:10,708 --> 00:59:13,606
Oh, you're a woman now, Jane.

1225
00:59:13,726 --> 00:59:14,926
Get out!

1226
00:59:15,005 --> 00:59:16,449
Shaz.

1227
00:59:16,577 --> 00:59:17,668
Get out!

1228
00:59:17,715 --> 00:59:19,559
- Oh.
- Shaz.

1229
00:59:19,598 --> 00:59:22,239
Whoa!
Looks like pads all round, Nance.

1230
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:23,668
Oh! Pigs!

1231
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:25,671
You filthy, filthy pigs!

1232
00:59:25,696 --> 00:59:27,717
Oh, I'm bleeding like a stuck one,
that's for sure.

1233
00:59:27,742 --> 00:59:28,975
- I'll get the toilet paper.
- Oh.

1234
00:59:29,015 --> 00:59:30,443
- Where's the bathroom?
- Oh!

1235
00:59:31,522 --> 00:59:32,895
- Excuse me.
- Move back!

1236
00:59:32,949 --> 00:59:34,160
- Get out!
- Oh, no.

1237
00:59:34,192 --> 00:59:36,090
Jane, let Nance hit you
with that boomerang.

1238
00:59:36,145 --> 00:59:37,223
It's good therapy for her.

1239
00:59:37,254 --> 00:59:38,699
Don't be afraid of mess, Nance.

1240
00:59:38,739 --> 00:59:40,402
Mess is good. Mess is life.

1241
00:59:40,427 --> 00:59:41,442
Call the police!

1242
00:59:41,481 --> 00:59:43,741
- Call the police!
- I invited them in!

1243
00:59:43,766 --> 00:59:46,577
What are the cops gonna do, Nance?
Arrest us for bleeding?

1244
00:59:46,605 --> 00:59:48,473
That's it, Nance. Lose control.

1245
00:59:48,512 --> 00:59:49,879
Fight your pathology!

1246
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:51,652
- Coming through.
- Oh!

1247
00:59:51,692 --> 00:59:54,856
Break free of your delusions, Nance.
Unleash them forbidden desires.

1248
00:59:54,896 --> 00:59:56,473
Them repressed impulses.

1249
00:59:56,512 --> 01:00:01,770
- Embrace mess and be free!
- She's gone mental!

1250
01:00:01,858 --> 01:00:04,704
- Filthy neanderthal!
- No!

1251
01:00:04,758 --> 01:00:07,548
- Mum!
- Filthy sluts!

1252
01:00:10,024 --> 01:00:13,204
We'll get them dry-cleaned!

1253
01:00:14,415 --> 01:00:16,447

I warned you.

1294
01:04:41,766 --> 01:04:43,801
This time I kill you.

1295
01:05:03,659 --> 01:05:05,307
Nah, I said to him,

1296
01:05:05,378 --> 01:05:07,839
"I'm not going to have sex
with you on the first date.

1297
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,268
I have self-respect."

1298
01:05:09,318 --> 01:05:10,861
Yeah. I know--

1299
01:05:11,143 --> 01:05:12,815
Hang on a tick.

1300
01:05:13,166 --> 01:05:15,229
Dolphin Heads Council,
Mayor Moochmore's office.

1301
01:05:15,261 --> 01:05:16,894
Tisha speaking.

1302
01:05:21,183 --> 01:05:22,769
Barry!

1303
01:05:23,098 --> 01:05:25,113
Mayor Moochmore!

1304
01:05:25,478 --> 01:05:28,652
- I'm in conference!
- There's an emergency at home.

1305
01:05:32,078 --> 01:05:34,096
I painted that.

1306
01:05:34,371 --> 01:05:37,510
I'm helping Jean widen her access road.

1307
01:05:38,718 --> 01:05:41,331
They reckon somebody's died!

1308
01:05:41,362 --> 01:05:43,409
Where are youse?
Nobody panic!

1309
01:05:43,464 --> 01:05:45,925
I'm here! I'm here!

1310
01:05:47,523 --> 01:05:49,625
See? I told you he wasn't dead.

1311
01:05:49,664 --> 01:05:51,078
Just seemed like it.

1312
01:05:51,148 --> 01:05:53,826
Sit down, Barry.
You're just in time to carve the bird.

1313
01:05:53,859 --> 01:05:56,687
The girls cooked everything you see,
including the stuffing.

1314
01:05:56,746 --> 01:05:59,179
You seem a bit stuffed yourself.
What have you been up to?

1315
01:05:59,218 --> 01:06:00,797
Here's your beer.

1316
01:06:00,930 --> 01:06:03,727
Here's your name tag,
so nobody forgets who anybody is.

1317
01:06:03,908 --> 01:06:05,859
Michelle.

1318
01:06:07,015 --> 01:06:08,203
Peas, Dad?

1319
01:06:08,258 --> 01:06:10,398
- Bread and butter, Dad?
- Delicious corn.

1320
01:06:10,437 --> 01:06:12,593
- This is gravy.
- Uh...

1321
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,265
yeah.

1322
01:06:17,141 --> 01:06:19,008
You girls cooked this yourselves?

1323
01:06:19,047 --> 01:06:20,086
- Certainly did.
- Yep.

1324
01:06:20,141 --> 01:06:21,368
Yeah.

1325
01:06:21,412 --> 01:06:23,094
It's, um...

1326
01:06:24,891 --> 01:06:26,571
it's great.

1327
01:06:27,375 --> 01:06:29,141
Um...

1328
01:06:30,641 --> 01:06:32,407
I gotta go.

1329
01:06:34,178 --> 01:06:35,772
You're not going anywhere.

1330
01:06:35,842 --> 01:06:37,210
What?

1331
01:06:37,679 --> 01:06:38,835
- You heard me.
- What?

1332
01:06:38,874 --> 01:06:39,960
- You heard me.
- What?

1333
01:06:39,985 --> 01:06:40,991
- You heard me.
- What?

1334
01:06:41,022 --> 01:06:42,850
- You heard me.
- What?

1335
01:06:42,905 --> 01:06:45,030
- "What" means "no".
- What?

1336
01:06:45,139 --> 01:06:48,475
When Dad says "what" like that,
he means no.

1337
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:49,624
Is that right, Barry?

1338
01:06:49,663 --> 01:06:52,045
When you say "what" like that,
you mean "no" or you just mean "what"?

1339
01:06:52,077 --> 01:06:53,194
- What?
- Or does it mean,

1340
01:06:53,218 --> 01:06:55,884
"I don't feel comfortable with you girls
because I don't know any of youse.

1341
01:06:55,915 --> 01:06:57,445
And I don't know what to say to youse.

1342
01:06:57,485 --> 01:06:59,829
Easiest thing for me to do
is run off to the pub with me mates,

1343
01:06:59,854 --> 01:07:01,838
and talk about nothing,
instead of everything."

1344
01:07:01,878 --> 01:07:03,431
And that's what "what" means.

1345
01:07:03,470 --> 01:07:04,970
Innit, Barry?

1346
01:07:36,464 --> 01:07:38,573
Wakey-wakey!

1347
01:07:38,604 --> 01:07:40,145
I admired you, Barry.

1348
01:07:40,170 --> 01:07:41,825
I thought you was a big man.

1349
01:07:41,864 --> 01:07:46,012
But, you're nothing but a self-centered,
whining piece of shit.

1350
01:07:46,122 --> 01:07:46,872
Jesus!

1351
01:07:46,911 --> 01:07:49,606
You think I'm gonna stand by
while you abuse your family?

1352
01:07:49,653 --> 01:07:51,249
- I'd never hit any of them.
- Oh, no.

1353
01:07:51,288 --> 01:07:53,348
You don't have the guts
to use your fists.

1354
01:07:53,395 --> 01:07:56,020
You slap them girls around
with silence, don't you?

1355
01:07:56,059 --> 01:07:57,575
You kick them by not looking at them.

1356
01:07:57,606 --> 01:08:00,061
You beat your wife by not coming home,
and fucking anything that moves.

1357
01:08:00,093 --> 01:08:02,741
- That's not true, I...
- Oh, shut up! I heard the stories.

1358
01:08:02,831 --> 01:08:05,210
You know what I did
when my husband hit me?

1359
01:08:05,288 --> 01:08:07,069
I slit his face open...

1360
01:08:07,124 --> 01:08:08,796
from his eyebrows...

1361
01:08:08,866 --> 01:08:10,421
to his chin.

1362
01:08:10,472 --> 01:08:12,514
You think he ever hit me again?

1363
01:08:12,601 --> 01:08:13,827
Hit me?

1364
01:08:13,897 --> 01:08:16,366
He couldn't even look in the mirror
without crying about it.

1365
01:08:16,397 --> 01:08:17,475
- Oh.
- Shut up!

1366
01:08:17,546 --> 01:08:19,210
- And keep moving!
- God!

1367
01:08:19,389 --> 01:08:20,546
- Shaz!
- Call the police!

1368
01:08:20,577 --> 01:08:22,233
- Don't hurt him!
- Oh!

1369
01:08:23,014 --> 01:08:24,749
- Get off.
- Get in there!

1370
01:08:24,813 --> 01:08:25,850
Oh!

1371
01:08:25,882 --> 01:08:27,070
You can't kill me!

1372
01:08:27,116 --> 01:08:28,280
I'm an elected official!

1373
01:08:28,305 --> 01:08:30,616
Oh, it's easy to impress people
who don't know you, innit?

1374
01:08:30,641 --> 01:08:31,671
I'll be missed!

1375
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:34,335
Yeah, only by your family.
Suck on that irony.

1376
01:08:36,874 --> 01:08:38,069
Michelle.

1377
01:08:38,109 --> 01:08:39,296
- I don't have it!
- Michelle.

1378
01:08:39,327 --> 01:08:40,858
- Michelle, it's me, love.
- I'm sorry!

1379
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:43,186
I'm so sorry.
I don't have it.

1380
01:08:46,942 --> 01:08:48,845
- Shaz?
- Yeah.

1381
01:08:48,892 --> 01:08:50,931
I got your dad down here.

1382
01:08:51,169 --> 01:08:52,989
This is where she sleeps now, Barry.

1383
01:08:53,024 --> 01:08:56,532
She waits till everyone goes to bed
and then she moves her stuff down here.

1384
01:08:56,634 --> 01:08:59,696
Tell your dad what
you're doing down here, Michelle.

1385
01:09:00,673 --> 01:09:02,357
They know where to find me up there.

1386
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:04,040
- Who does?
- The ones from Lost In Space.

1387
01:09:04,069 --> 01:09:06,899
They want the mechanical man.
I don't have him!

1388
01:09:07,097 --> 01:09:08,993
They know where I sleep.

1389
01:09:09,079 --> 01:09:11,696
They want to hurt me because I'm bad.

1390
01:09:12,136 --> 01:09:14,657
They took Mum because I let them down.

1391
01:09:15,192 --> 01:09:17,540
I can't be up there no more.

1392
01:09:18,474 --> 01:09:22,017
She needs help, Barry.
What are you gonna do about it?

1393
01:09:22,899 --> 01:09:24,954
- I'm onto it, sweetheart.
- No!

1394
01:09:24,993 --> 01:09:26,548
- You can come out now.
- No!

1395
01:09:26,586 --> 01:09:28,610
I've gotta stay here!

1396
01:09:29,574 --> 01:09:32,188
I, I gotta stay here.

1397
01:09:33,633 --> 01:09:35,196
I wanna talk to her.

1398
01:09:35,267 --> 01:09:36,572
- Alone.
- No.

1399
01:09:36,610 --> 01:09:39,188
She's my daughter, not yours!

1400
01:10:00,854 --> 01:10:03,283
Why don't you tell me about it, OK?

1401
01:10:03,408 --> 01:10:05,197
You won't get mad?

1402
01:10:05,627 --> 01:10:07,361
No.

1403
01:10:08,102 --> 01:10:09,956
I won't get mad.

1404
01:10:10,309 --> 01:10:12,651
You won't hate me no more?

1405
01:10:25,905 --> 01:10:28,001
You were married, Shaz.

1406
01:10:28,684 --> 01:10:31,102
You were married to Trevor Blundell.

1407
01:10:31,245 --> 01:10:32,978
Married?

1408
01:10:33,599 --> 01:10:35,683
Till death do us part.

1409
01:10:35,887 --> 01:10:37,142
I meant that,

1410
01:10:37,181 --> 01:10:38,782
even if he didn't.

1411
01:10:40,479 --> 01:10:43,737
- He told me you were dead.
- And what about Grace?

1412
01:10:44,839 --> 01:10:47,190
He tell you about our daughter?

1413
01:10:47,766 --> 01:10:50,440
He told you she was dead too, didn't he?

1414
01:10:51,667 --> 01:10:53,565
Yeah, well, she ain't dead.

1415
01:10:53,644 --> 01:10:55,136
He's got her.

1416
01:10:55,222 --> 01:10:57,292
And he keeps her against her will.

1417
01:10:57,347 --> 01:10:58,457
No.

1418
01:10:58,526 --> 01:11:00,870
That's why I come to Dolphin Heads.

1419
01:11:00,948 --> 01:11:03,802
That's why your dad stopped for me.

1420
01:11:04,151 --> 01:11:07,206
That's why you work for him.

1421
01:11:08,184 --> 01:11:10,073
It's your destiny.

1422
01:11:13,857 --> 01:11:15,503
Trust me?

1423
01:11:20,809 --> 01:11:23,098
I done for you, didn't I?

1424
01:11:25,755 --> 01:11:27,708
Then you do for me.

1425
01:11:41,777 --> 01:11:43,309
Go on.

1426
01:11:43,988 --> 01:11:45,746
He needs you.

1427
01:11:49,191 --> 01:11:51,182
Ian Davies, please.

1428
01:11:51,361 --> 01:11:53,478
Yeah, Barry Moochmore.

1429
01:11:54,847 --> 01:11:56,205
Yeah, Ian?

1430
01:11:56,268 --> 01:11:59,479
Oh, no, not, not good, actually.

1431
01:11:59,994 --> 01:12:03,237
It's me daughter Michelle,
she's feeling crook.

1432
01:12:04,971 --> 01:12:07,330
She's hearing voices, Ian.

1433
01:12:08,084 --> 01:12:10,432
Telling her to kill herself and that.

1434
01:12:11,088 --> 01:12:13,502
Yeah, I think you better.

1435
01:12:13,893 --> 01:12:15,925
See you soon.

1436
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:24,728
I don't hate youse.

1437
01:12:26,281 --> 01:12:28,353
Who said I hated youse?

1438
01:12:32,002 --> 01:12:34,806
I grew up with boys, that's all.

1439
01:12:39,396 --> 01:12:41,420
They used to compare...

1440
01:12:41,706 --> 01:12:44,803
me and me brothers to the Kennedys.

1441
01:12:46,231 --> 01:12:50,123
We was like Jack, Bobby
and Teddy in Hyannis Port.

1442
01:12:50,425 --> 01:12:53,490
Except, we were Barry, Vince,
and Ken in Dolphin Heads.

1443
01:12:53,607 --> 01:12:55,560
And me dad...

1444
01:12:56,763 --> 01:12:59,076
he was a big man,

1445
01:12:59,194 --> 01:13:02,826
a rogue, like old Joe Kennedy was.

1446
01:13:03,415 --> 01:13:05,373
And he told us...

1447
01:13:05,521 --> 01:13:09,912
that we was destined for greatness
like them Kennedy boys.

1448
01:13:19,946 --> 01:13:22,868
But, this is my greatness, isn't it?

1449
01:13:25,437 --> 01:13:28,359
Mayor of nothing but a shithole town...

1450
01:13:29,464 --> 01:13:33,085
with an insane wife
and five mental daughters.

1451
01:13:33,531 --> 01:13:35,515
So, you didn't get what you want?

1452
01:13:35,570 --> 01:13:36,742
Big deal!

1453
01:13:36,788 --> 01:13:37,828
We're girls, Dad.

1454
01:13:37,853 --> 01:13:39,766
We're gonna be girls
for the rest of our lives,

1455
01:13:39,797 --> 01:13:42,695
so why don't you just shut up about it?

1456
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:44,968
And we want you to start coming home,

1457
01:13:45,031 --> 01:13:46,812
and talking to us about things.

1458
01:13:46,867 --> 01:13:48,554
And taking us places,

1459
01:13:48,617 --> 01:13:50,680
like the beach and that.

1460
01:13:50,892 --> 01:13:53,788
- Like we were a real family.
- Because we are one.

1461
01:13:53,991 --> 01:13:55,655
If you think about it.

1462
01:13:55,746 --> 01:13:58,695
And we want you to stop
seeing other women,

1463
01:13:58,908 --> 01:14:01,312
because everybody knows about it.

1464
01:14:01,538 --> 01:14:03,429
Mum did too.

1465
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:07,078
It's just embarrassing.

1466
01:14:09,906 --> 01:14:12,586
I would never have dared...

1467
01:14:12,657 --> 01:14:14,532
not in a million years...

1468
01:14:14,610 --> 01:14:17,547
dared to talk to my father like this!

1469
01:14:18,031 --> 01:14:21,937
One wrong look and he thrashed
the living daylights outta me!

1470
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:52,471
Yeah.

1471
01:14:54,111 --> 01:14:56,455
He was a bad father too.

1472
01:15:20,302 --> 01:15:21,748
Dad.

1473
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:25,825
There weren't only Kennedy boys.

1474
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:28,357
There were girls too.

1475
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,833
And, and one of them was mental.

1476
01:15:31,059 --> 01:15:33,036
And they put her away.

1477
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:36,255
So...

1478
01:15:37,545 --> 01:15:39,482
you're sort of like a Kennedy.

1479
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:41,771
Well, if you think about it.

1480
01:15:51,237 --> 01:15:52,659
Yeah.

1481
01:15:54,277 --> 01:15:56,074
I reckon I am.

1482
01:16:02,336 --> 01:16:04,170
Doris Charles speaking.

1483
01:16:04,249 --> 01:16:07,753
<i>We have Elizabeth the 1st
and all her wee friends.</i>

1484
01:16:13,021 --> 01:16:14,838
No! No! No!

1485
01:16:25,941 --> 01:16:27,855
Smile.

1486
01:16:33,273 --> 01:16:36,351
Doris has got something
to say to you, Shirley.

1487
01:16:39,933 --> 01:16:41,279
I've...

1488
01:16:43,263 --> 01:16:44,709
I've...

1489
01:16:47,396 --> 01:16:50,521
- I've...
- What's that? Speak up, Doris.

1490
01:16:51,334 --> 01:16:52,663
I've...

1491
01:16:52,757 --> 01:16:54,397
always...

1492
01:16:56,432 --> 01:16:58,655
been jealous of you...

1493
01:16:59,073 --> 01:17:02,530
of your sweet, caring nature...

1494
01:17:04,045 --> 01:17:06,467
and the fact that Mum loved you
more than she loved me.

1495
01:17:06,509 --> 01:17:08,702
- Oh! No, she didn't.
- She did.

1496
01:17:08,741 --> 01:17:10,006
- Well, she didn't.
- She did.

1497
01:17:10,048 --> 01:17:11,420
- She did.
- She really didn't.

1498
01:17:11,452 --> 01:17:12,452
She did.

1499
01:17:12,491 --> 01:17:14,569
And old Doris here's been
pissed off about it for years.

1500
01:17:14,611 --> 01:17:16,592
But you're over that now,
ain't you, Doris?

1501
01:17:16,620 --> 01:17:18,030
- Yes.
- Yeah, and twice a week,

1502
01:17:18,061 --> 01:17:20,944
she's gonna come over to your house and
have a cup of tea with you and the girls.

1503
01:17:20,986 --> 01:17:23,545
And afterwards, she's gonna help you
with the dishes, aren't you, Doris?

1504
01:17:23,581 --> 01:17:24,739
And maybe some vacuuming.

1505
01:17:24,795 --> 01:17:27,130
Little bit of laundry too,
aren't you, Doris?

1506
01:17:27,274 --> 01:17:28,638
Aren't ya?

1507
01:17:29,728 --> 01:17:31,575
Elizabeth the 1st.

1508
01:17:31,808 --> 01:17:33,271
Yes, I am. I will, yes.

1509
01:17:33,310 --> 01:17:36,243
And she's very, very sorry.

1510
01:17:36,341 --> 01:17:38,778
I'm very, very sorry.

1511
01:17:38,849 --> 01:17:40,817
- For what?
- For being a cunt.

1512
01:17:40,864 --> 01:17:42,341
- I will not say that.
- Oh, no. Oh don't--

1513
01:17:42,372 --> 01:17:45,286
But, you are a cunt. You are
the cuntiest cunt of all time.

1514
01:17:45,334 --> 01:17:47,247
- Admit your cunthood.
- No, don't make her say that.

1515
01:17:47,281 --> 01:17:50,403
- An irrefutable fact, like gravity.
- Oh, please don't make her say that.

1516
01:17:50,955 --> 01:17:55,364
Oh, alright. She's sorry for not
being a very good sister. Hm?

1517
01:17:56,153 --> 01:17:57,497
Oh, I'm sorry too.

1518
01:17:57,552 --> 01:17:59,669
- You don't have to be sorry, Shirley.
- Yes, I do.

1519
01:17:59,709 --> 01:18:00,669
- No.
- I do.

1520
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:01,552
- Shirley?
- No, I do.

1521
01:18:01,591 --> 01:18:02,536
- Shirley?
- I do.

1522
01:18:02,568 --> 01:18:03,318
- Shirley?
- But, I do.

1523
01:18:03,357 --> 01:18:04,935
- Shirley?
- I really am sorry.

1524
01:18:04,974 --> 01:18:06,583
She's right.

1525
01:18:07,693 --> 01:18:09,466
You don't.

1526
01:18:10,771 --> 01:18:13,317
I haven't been a very good sister.

1527
01:18:15,464 --> 01:18:17,862
Oh, come on out, Shirley.

1528
01:18:18,034 --> 01:18:20,338
Everything's gonna be alright.

1529
01:18:24,214 --> 01:18:26,120
But, what about Barry?

1530
01:18:26,995 --> 01:18:28,432
Is he still angry with me?

1531
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:30,784
Shirley, as you know,
I think Doris here is a cunt,

1532
01:18:30,813 --> 01:18:32,533
but she is right about one thing.

1533
01:18:32,581 --> 01:18:34,017
Barry's a bit of a dickhead.

1534
01:18:34,056 --> 01:18:35,618
You have to stop worrying
about what he thinks...

1535
01:18:35,650 --> 01:18:37,322
because he only ever thinks of himself.

1536
01:18:37,361 --> 01:18:39,126
Mum!

1537
01:18:41,292 --> 01:18:42,495
Hello!

1538
01:18:42,542 --> 01:18:43,862
- I love you.
- Mum? Mum?

1539
01:18:43,901 --> 01:18:45,042
Mum, it's me.

1540
01:18:45,081 --> 01:18:46,605
I'm Michelle.

1541
01:18:47,471 --> 01:18:48,948
G'day, love.

1542
01:18:48,987 --> 01:18:50,487
What's happening?

1543
01:18:50,764 --> 01:18:52,909
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, I'm fine.

1544
01:18:52,955 --> 01:18:54,002
Fine.

1545
01:18:54,042 --> 01:18:55,307
Oh, sweetheart, stop.

1546
01:18:55,344 --> 01:18:56,690
I voted for you.

1547
01:18:56,721 --> 01:18:57,722
- Oh.
- So did Beverly.

1548
01:18:57,764 --> 01:19:00,018
Oh, thank you, love.
Both of youse.

1549
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:02,620
You can come out now, Mum.
The house is all clean.

1550
01:19:02,667 --> 01:19:05,245
And Noxious Nance went mental,
didn't she, Shaz?

1551
01:19:05,277 --> 01:19:07,573
High-dependency ward, Shirley.
The Quiet Room.

1552
01:19:07,615 --> 01:19:11,237
Donna ran off with a borderline
personality lesbian Aboriginal.

1553
01:19:11,379 --> 01:19:12,854
You remember? Sandra.

1554
01:19:12,901 --> 01:19:15,229
- Oh, Sandra. How is Sandra?
- Married.

1555
01:19:15,276 --> 01:19:17,652
- To Donna.
- Here, they sent me a picture.

1556
01:19:17,708 --> 01:19:20,432
They eloped to Adelaide,
and Nance just went ballistic.

1557
01:19:20,471 --> 01:19:22,276
And kidnapped Donna out of a supermarket.

1558
01:19:22,301 --> 01:19:25,276
So, Sandra's doctors had Nance certified.

1559
01:19:25,658 --> 01:19:28,901
See Shirley, all this time
you was the normal one.

1560
01:19:28,959 --> 01:19:30,541
- And guess what?
- Mm?

1561
01:19:30,565 --> 01:19:33,502
Oh, uh, I'm schizophrenic.

1562
01:19:33,547 --> 01:19:35,893
Michelle's schizophrenic and Coral's not.

1563
01:19:36,026 --> 01:19:37,736
Dad got a psychiatrist,
didn't you, Dad?

1564
01:19:37,770 --> 01:19:39,221
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ian Davies.

1565
01:19:39,257 --> 01:19:41,224
You remember Ian.
He's the one that...

1566
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:43,744
helped put you--

1567
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:47,385
But he gave me, um, uh, clozapine.

1568
01:19:47,452 --> 01:19:50,479
As long as Michelle keeps taking that,
she's gonna be fine.

1569
01:19:50,885 --> 01:19:52,182
Oh.

1570
01:19:52,283 --> 01:19:55,924
I don't know if things are
coming together or falling apart.

1571
01:19:56,278 --> 01:19:58,713
Don't cry, Mum.

1572
01:19:59,026 --> 01:20:00,791
I'm happy.

1573
01:20:01,082 --> 01:20:04,408
All the girls are jealous of me,
aren't you?

1574
01:20:04,855 --> 01:20:06,736
Come out, Shirl.

1575
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:10,096
You can't be in here no more.

1576
01:20:10,419 --> 01:20:12,877
Please come home.
We miss you so much, Mum.

1577
01:20:12,906 --> 01:20:14,736
- We made our beds
- And I washed the dishes

1578
01:20:14,761 --> 01:20:15,916
and Kayleen dried them.

1579
01:20:15,948 --> 01:20:18,416
And, and I can play with you at home.

1580
01:20:19,346 --> 01:20:21,229
- Come home, love.
- Look, the whole kitchen,

1581
01:20:21,289 --> 01:20:22,914
it's really clean.

1582
01:20:23,648 --> 01:20:25,307
- Come home.
- Please, Mum?

1583
01:20:25,354 --> 01:20:27,065
- OK.
- Yes!

1584
01:20:37,267 --> 01:20:39,626
Saturday, 7 P.M.

1585
01:20:39,696 --> 01:20:43,508
He'll be at the aquarium,
spouting his shark-hunter bullshit.

1586
01:20:43,731 --> 01:20:45,524
And that's when we do it.

1587
01:20:45,649 --> 01:20:48,771
Now, the boat's booby-trapped,
so we gotta be smart.

1588
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:52,837
If we want Grace, we have to have
something we can negotiate with,

1589
01:20:53,017 --> 01:20:55,204
something he cares about.

1590
01:20:55,621 --> 01:20:58,743
You know what I'm talking about,
don't you, Coral?

1591
01:21:00,367 --> 01:21:01,704
Find the keys,

1592
01:21:01,751 --> 01:21:04,423
unlock them chains on the wheels.

1593
01:21:05,094 --> 01:21:07,485
We tow it right outta there.

1594
01:21:21,809 --> 01:21:25,942
♪ She doesn't know what she does to me ♪

1595
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:29,957
♪ Born without the instinct of conformity ♪

1596
01:21:30,003 --> 01:21:33,818
♪ She ain't normal, ♪
♪ just different shades of mental ♪

1597
01:21:33,883 --> 01:21:36,896
♪ The fact that we met, ♪
♪ it could not be accidental ♪

1598
01:21:36,927 --> 01:21:41,045
- Grace?
- ♪ Maybe she's not the solution ♪

1599
01:21:41,095 --> 01:21:45,467
♪ But she's the next step in human evolution ♪

1600
01:21:45,513 --> 01:21:46,826
♪ She's the best-- ♪

1601
01:21:47,248 --> 01:21:48,631
Oh!

1602
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:50,155
Oh. What?

1603
01:21:51,552 --> 01:21:53,115
- What are you singing, mate?
- What?

1604
01:21:53,170 --> 01:21:54,756
Where'd you get them words?

1605
01:21:54,808 --> 01:21:57,138
- I made them up.
- "Instinct of conformity"?

1606
01:21:57,211 --> 01:21:58,357
"Next step"?

1607
01:21:59,623 --> 01:22:00,646
Where is she?

1608
01:22:00,685 --> 01:22:02,881
Where is the mad bitch?

1609
01:22:06,580 --> 01:22:07,958
Grace?

1610
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:25,457
Where is she?

1611
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,317
Where's your daughter?

1612
01:22:29,802 --> 01:22:31,935
- Sure that mate, I saw that book.
- It's fine.

1613
01:22:31,971 --> 01:22:35,153
- Michelle, what you got is the book on--
- Shhh! There's someone coming.

1614
01:22:35,786 --> 01:22:37,077
Nothing to worry about, Shirl.

1615
01:22:37,117 --> 01:22:38,765
We're just going to steal
me ex-husband's shark.

1616
01:22:38,805 --> 01:22:40,044
Go back to bed.

1617
01:22:40,468 --> 01:22:41,882
Shaz!

1618
01:22:45,746 --> 01:22:48,152
- That old bitch.
- I want you to treat this as a kidnapping.

1619
01:22:48,199 --> 01:22:50,441
Don't worry, I've been in tighter
spots than this.

1620
01:22:50,481 --> 01:22:52,300
- Come on!
- No, Shaz. No.

1621
01:22:52,347 --> 01:22:54,300
No, no.
When you wake up, Shirley,

1622
01:22:54,324 --> 01:22:56,434
I'll be gone and you'll have
your family back.

1623
01:22:56,486 --> 01:22:58,410
- No.
- Mum, I've got this.

1624
01:22:59,332 --> 01:23:02,097
Youse check down the hallway,
youse check out on the verandah.

1625
01:23:02,136 --> 01:23:04,425
Don't worry, we're not here for you.
We're here for Shaz.

1626
01:23:04,464 --> 01:23:06,964
She's nuts.
She attacked me with a knife.

1627
01:23:07,003 --> 01:23:08,254
Oh, shut up about that.

1628
01:23:08,285 --> 01:23:10,812
More importantly,
where are my dolls?

1629
01:23:18,039 --> 01:23:19,352
Die dolls!

1630
01:23:20,327 --> 01:23:22,329
He told me about you, Shaz.

1631
01:23:23,781 --> 01:23:25,563
Black out your face, Coral.

1632
01:23:25,601 --> 01:23:27,134
- Grace drowned.
- What?

1633
01:23:27,173 --> 01:23:29,845
She was a drug addict.
She went swimming in the sea--

1634
01:23:32,524 --> 01:23:35,071
You don't know the first thing
about me daughter, you hear me?

1635
01:23:35,108 --> 01:23:37,407
Grace weren't on drugs
and she didn't drown.

1636
01:23:37,465 --> 01:23:40,118
She got took by a shark,
his shark, the one in his show.

1637
01:23:40,166 --> 01:23:41,884
The shark that ate Harold Holt?

1638
01:23:41,936 --> 01:23:43,524
It never ate Harold Holt.

1639
01:23:43,549 --> 01:23:45,517
That's bullshit he made up for the punters.

1640
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:48,259
He caught it five years ago,
the day after Grace went missing

1641
01:23:48,289 --> 01:23:50,571
because he knew, he knew,
it was the shark that took her.

1642
01:23:50,621 --> 01:23:53,196
He's got a restraining order on you, Shaz.

1643
01:23:53,274 --> 01:23:55,704
He says if you go near him,
he'll put you away again.

1644
01:23:55,731 --> 01:23:56,743
Again?

1645
01:23:56,786 --> 01:23:58,173
You told him, didn't you?

1646
01:23:58,228 --> 01:23:59,744
Oh, you told him.

1647
01:23:59,782 --> 01:24:02,470
- He already knew!
- Oh, don't you lie to me!

1648
01:24:02,511 --> 01:24:03,806
You're the liar!

1649
01:24:03,837 --> 01:24:06,321
We're not special,
we're not the next steps either!

1650
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:08,946
- No, Coral!
- Three times it's happened.

1651
01:24:08,971 --> 01:24:10,392
- No.
- He moves to a place...

1652
01:24:10,423 --> 01:24:12,689
- and she finds losers,
- It's not true!

1653
01:24:12,751 --> 01:24:14,392
- losers like us.
- No!

1654
01:24:14,426 --> 01:24:16,993
- I'm not a loser!
- She picks the stupid...

1655
01:24:17,071 --> 01:24:20,048
- and the lonely, and she flatters you,
- Oh, no.

1656
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:22,126
avenges you, and before you know it,

1657
01:24:22,173 --> 01:24:25,688
you have boot-polish on your face,
helping her steal a dead shark!

1658
01:24:25,712 --> 01:24:26,775
No!

1659
01:24:26,829 --> 01:24:28,603
Coral, she believes in us!

1660
01:24:28,665 --> 01:24:31,688
Tell them.
Tell them what you really think.

1661
01:24:31,735 --> 01:24:33,024
Oh, shut up!

1662
01:24:33,079 --> 01:24:34,649
Tell them, you lying bitch!

1663
01:24:34,674 --> 01:24:36,087
Oh, you're nothing!

1664
01:24:36,150 --> 01:24:38,353
You're too stupid
to stand up for yourselves,

1665
01:24:38,398 --> 01:24:40,441
too lazy to care about anyone but you!

1666
01:24:40,489 --> 01:24:42,978
What else are you good for but lies?

1667
01:24:57,431 --> 01:24:58,919
Get it?

1668
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:03,872
We're stupid, lazy and unpopular.

1669
01:25:05,395 --> 01:25:07,950
But, at least we're not crazy.

1670
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:10,170
Oh, I can't--

1671
01:25:10,677 --> 01:25:12,544
You take it back.

1672
01:25:13,631 --> 01:25:14,826
No.

1673
01:25:17,738 --> 01:25:19,810
Take it back.

1674
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:25,263
You hear voices.

1675
01:25:27,780 --> 01:25:32,943
You hear your daughter's voice
calling you from inside a dead shark.

1676
01:25:36,829 --> 01:25:38,102
Nobody...

1677
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:40,251
can save you from that.

1678
01:25:44,556 --> 01:25:48,243
The spirit lives on after the body,
don't you know that?

1679
01:25:49,157 --> 01:25:50,950
But, it can be trapped.

1680
01:25:51,412 --> 01:25:54,407
It screams out in pain...

1681
01:25:54,806 --> 01:25:56,860
but no-one is hearing it.

1682
01:26:00,264 --> 01:26:02,745
A mother never stops hearing it.

1683
01:26:05,506 --> 01:26:09,393
Her spirit's gotta be in the ocean
where she died.

1684
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:12,135
I've got to get it outta me head.

1685
01:26:15,675 --> 01:26:17,263
Come on.

1686
01:26:23,621 --> 01:26:24,989
No.

1687
01:26:26,254 --> 01:26:27,825
No.

1688
01:26:28,152 --> 01:26:29,371
Well...

1689
01:26:29,410 --> 01:26:31,348
you promised me.

1690
01:26:35,005 --> 01:26:37,583
He knows you're coming, Shaz.

1691
01:26:38,786 --> 01:26:40,380
Get out of here...

1692
01:26:40,474 --> 01:26:43,036
- while you still can.
- Go, Shaz!

1693
01:26:43,562 --> 01:26:45,155
Please.

1694
01:26:47,646 --> 01:26:49,230
Don't you know what it's like

1695
01:26:49,255 --> 01:26:52,263
to care for someone
more than you care for yourself?

1696
01:26:59,805 --> 01:27:01,330
Ripper.

1697
01:28:01,843 --> 01:28:03,257
Hold still, all right?

1698
01:28:03,312 --> 01:28:05,672
Just, please, just lay still.

1699
01:28:05,741 --> 01:28:07,306
Help me out here.

1700
01:28:07,353 --> 01:28:09,612
Hey, stay back, love.
Stay out of it.

1701
01:28:11,184 --> 01:28:12,701
Don't hurt her, please.

1702
01:28:12,733 --> 01:28:15,350
- No!
- Gonna make it. Most dead.

1703
01:28:16,756 --> 01:28:18,959
Could we have lunch this Friday?

1704
01:28:20,951 --> 01:28:22,889
Or, or afternoon tea?

1705
01:28:40,865 --> 01:28:42,441
- Dad's home!
- It's Dad!

1706
01:28:42,473 --> 01:28:44,528
- I got over here.
- Great, I do the peas.

1707
01:28:44,575 --> 01:28:46,067
Dad loves peas.

1708
01:28:51,490 --> 01:28:52,752
G'day!

1709
01:28:53,758 --> 01:28:55,088
Mrs. Moochmore.

1710
01:28:55,260 --> 01:28:56,307
Yes.

1711
01:28:56,421 --> 01:28:58,049
Trevor Blundell.

1712
01:28:59,988 --> 01:29:01,791
Coral's employer.

1713
01:29:02,049 --> 01:29:03,518
Former employer.

1714
01:29:03,639 --> 01:29:05,166
Sorry, love.
You're out of a job.

1715
01:29:05,219 --> 01:29:07,291
I'm closing the shark show.
Taking off tonight.

1716
01:29:07,370 --> 01:29:08,698
Cheers, love.

1717
01:29:13,824 --> 01:29:16,633
You all feel bad about Shaz, I know.

1718
01:29:17,562 --> 01:29:19,812
But, you done the right thing.

1719
01:29:20,539 --> 01:29:21,945
They'll let her out.

1720
01:29:22,055 --> 01:29:24,680
They always do.
Then it starts again.

1721
01:29:25,890 --> 01:29:28,406
Why don't you just give her the shark?

1722
01:29:34,688 --> 01:29:36,736
She never gets that shark.

1723
01:29:38,041 --> 01:29:40,039
She never gets to forget what she done.

1724
01:29:40,084 --> 01:29:42,906
- What did she do?
- She looked the other way!

1725
01:29:43,223 --> 01:29:45,422
She wants to protect Grace now!

1726
01:29:45,485 --> 01:29:47,094
Where was she then?

1727
01:29:51,458 --> 01:29:53,062
Maybe, she'll die.

1728
01:29:55,163 --> 01:29:56,898
There's a possibility.

1729
01:29:57,198 --> 01:30:00,320
She can't take another 12 months
searching for me, it'll kill her.

1730
01:30:00,492 --> 01:30:02,189
Or she'll kill herself.

1731
01:30:02,494 --> 01:30:04,273
Shaz would never do that.

1732
01:30:06,742 --> 01:30:08,085
That a fact?

1733
01:30:10,296 --> 01:30:12,656
A little girl once told me
she jumped off a verandah

1734
01:30:12,697 --> 01:30:15,074
because she didn't like
the look of her own face.

1735
01:30:16,355 --> 01:30:18,973
Imagine if that little girl knew real pain.

1736
01:30:19,754 --> 01:30:20,988
Grief.

1737
01:30:21,754 --> 01:30:23,191
Despair.

1738
01:30:25,276 --> 01:30:27,776
Maybe, she'd out her throat too.

1739
01:30:28,998 --> 01:30:30,104
Yeah.

1740
01:30:31,752 --> 01:30:33,260
Or her wrists.

1741
01:30:34,075 --> 01:30:37,862
Or try to hang herself in the bathroom
with the elastic from her pajamas.

1742
01:30:41,591 --> 01:30:45,070
Maybe this time, we'll be lucky,
and there'll be no five-minute checks.

1743
01:30:46,005 --> 01:30:48,125
And we can all be free.

1744
01:31:12,253 --> 01:31:13,880
I had a family.

1745
01:31:15,042 --> 01:31:17,544
We used to sit around a table and...

1746
01:31:18,404 --> 01:31:20,154
talk about things.

1747
01:31:21,999 --> 01:31:23,211
The future.

1748
01:31:25,399 --> 01:31:26,406
Hm.

1749
01:31:28,216 --> 01:31:29,860
We had it all.

1750
01:31:32,695 --> 01:31:34,455
We just didn't know it.

1751
01:32:00,119 --> 01:32:01,517
G'day, Trev.

1752
01:32:01,619 --> 01:32:03,018

1753
01:32:03,159 --> 01:32:04,268
sorry, but...

1754
01:32:04,346 --> 01:32:06,300
they've stolen your shark.

1755
01:32:07,826 --> 01:32:09,072
They left this, but--

1756
01:32:10,693 --> 01:32:12,291
Oh, mate.

1757
01:32:12,729 --> 01:32:15,291
You're not still upset about that, are you?

1758
01:32:17,989 --> 01:32:19,510
What are you doing?

1759
01:32:21,291 --> 01:32:22,298

G'day, Shirley.
How was Wollongong?

1768
01:32:52,740 --> 01:32:54,982
I wouldn't know, Jack,
I was in a mental hospital.

1769
01:32:55,561 --> 01:32:57,841
That would be crazy.

1770
01:32:58,201 --> 01:33:00,826
Where have you been
the last three days, Barry?

1771
01:33:00,973 --> 01:33:02,209
What?

1772
01:33:02,329 --> 01:33:03,521
I said,

1773
01:33:03,741 --> 01:33:06,467
where have you been
the last three days?

1774
01:33:06,826 --> 01:33:09,264
- What?
- And who's she?

1775
01:33:10,161 --> 01:33:11,850
I painted that.

1776
01:33:11,951 --> 01:33:12,982
What?

1777
01:33:13,037 --> 01:33:14,248
I see.

1778
01:33:15,015 --> 01:33:17,678
So nothing's changed, then, has it?

1779
01:33:20,636 --> 01:33:22,179
You're leaving me, Barry.

1780
01:33:22,258 --> 01:33:25,334
Actually, you left me a long time ago.

1781
01:33:25,592 --> 01:33:28,193
But this time, you're really leaving me.

1782
01:33:29,151 --> 01:33:31,100
What about me election?

1783
01:33:31,654 --> 01:33:32,842
What?

1784
01:33:33,049 --> 01:33:34,639
I said, what about me election?

1785
01:33:34,702 --> 01:33:36,358
- What?
- His election.

1786
01:33:36,420 --> 01:33:38,584
- What? What! What!

1787
01:33:38,622 --> 01:33:39,990
Oh.

1788
01:33:54,159 --> 01:33:55,285
- Where is it?
- Ah!

1789
01:33:55,316 --> 01:33:56,348
- Look.
- Oh!

1790
01:33:56,391 --> 01:33:58,160
The plaque!
The emergency plaque!

1791
01:33:58,210 --> 01:33:59,918
- Oh.
- The emergency plaque!

1792
01:33:59,965 --> 01:34:01,590
Where is it?

1793
01:34:01,917 --> 01:34:03,144
Shirley.

1794
01:34:03,215 --> 01:34:04,699
Shirley!

1795
01:34:04,801 --> 01:34:06,137
Stop!

1796
01:34:10,261 --> 01:34:12,508
I have been saving this...

1797
01:34:12,625 --> 01:34:14,961
for a special occasion.

1798
01:34:15,959 --> 01:34:18,054
Your very own waterfall.

1799
01:34:18,363 --> 01:34:20,109
Named it after you.

1800
01:34:20,195 --> 01:34:21,703
Pushed it through the council last year.

1801
01:34:21,716 --> 01:34:24,273
It, it's in the rainforest
near Mount Warning.

1802
01:34:24,375 --> 01:34:26,562
It's only a two-hour hike from the road...

1803
01:34:26,617 --> 01:34:29,047
if you use a machete.

1804
01:34:30,208 --> 01:34:31,633

1807
01:34:42,313 --> 01:34:43,985
I did fall.

1808
01:34:45,586 --> 01:34:47,032
I fell,

1809
01:34:47,235 --> 01:34:49,141
deep in a forest.

1810
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:52,813
And there was no-one there to hear me.

1811
01:34:54,628 --> 01:34:56,961
Except, there was someone.

1812
01:34:57,586 --> 01:34:59,641
And it wasn't you.

1813
01:35:00,323 --> 01:35:02,415

1814
01:35:03,376 --> 01:35:04,782

- Um, hi.
- Thank you.

1833
01:35:46,943 --> 01:35:48,615
- Bye.
- My name's Shirley Moochmore.

1834
01:35:48,670 --> 01:35:50,045
I used to be a patient here.

1835
01:35:50,070 --> 01:35:52,451
I was the one who thought
her husband had won Wheel Of Fortune.

1836
01:35:52,496 --> 01:35:55,599
Anyway, I'm fine now, thanks to you
and Prozac, of course.

1837
01:35:55,650 --> 01:35:58,334
These are my daughters. This is
Leanne, Coral, and that's Michelle--

1838
01:35:58,377 --> 01:36:00,494
Sharon Thornbender.
We wanna see Sharon Thornbender.

1839
01:36:00,536 --> 01:36:01,939
Shirley!

1840
01:36:02,477 --> 01:36:03,603
- Sandra!
- Oh!

1841
01:36:03,635 --> 01:36:06,564
- Sandra!
- Donna!

1842
01:36:06,595 --> 01:36:07,720
Donna, you free!

1843
01:36:07,766 --> 01:36:09,611
They got Shaz in here?

1844
01:36:09,666 --> 01:36:11,549
Fuck! You mum's gonna shit!

1845
01:36:11,588 --> 01:36:13,729
Wait till they clap eyes on each other.

1846
01:36:13,885 --> 01:36:15,306
Mum won't see us.

1847
01:36:15,338 --> 01:36:16,978
She reckons we're abnormal freaks.

1848
01:36:17,016 --> 01:36:19,431
- Hey, check out our wedding rings.
- Oh, that's so nice.

1849
01:36:19,471 --> 01:36:21,369
- We're here to bust Shaz out.
- Oh.

1850
01:36:21,424 --> 01:36:23,330
Yeah, that's why we got the koala.

1851
01:36:23,362 --> 01:36:24,642
- Oh.
- And there's this.

1852
01:36:24,689 --> 01:36:26,166
- Oh.
- Don't worry, it's not real.

1853
01:36:26,197 --> 01:36:27,642
No, no, no. No.
Once she's safe,

1854
01:36:27,674 --> 01:36:29,791
I'll turn myself in and plead insanity.

1855
01:36:29,859 --> 01:36:31,533
You gone mad.

1856
01:36:31,729 --> 01:36:33,393

1930
01:40:51,435 --> 01:40:53,146
I'll shoot you.

1931
01:40:54,808 --> 01:40:56,642
I'll shoot you dead.

1932
01:40:56,729 --> 01:40:58,826
Yeah, well, you're gonna have to.

1933
01:40:58,959 --> 01:41:00,600
Because this time, I'm doing it.

1934
01:41:00,697 --> 01:41:02,685
She's gonna be free.

1935
01:41:02,811 --> 01:41:04,936
- Or I join her.
- She's dead!

1936
01:41:05,021 --> 01:41:08,841
- Why don't you let her die?
- Because she calls me!

1937
01:41:09,150 --> 01:41:11,860
You hear her too!
I know you hear her!

1938
01:41:11,955 --> 01:41:13,943
Of course, I hear her.

1939
01:41:14,248 --> 01:41:16,568
I hear her every day of me life.

1940
01:41:16,797 --> 01:41:19,255
In me heart, me memories.

1941
01:41:19,326 --> 01:41:21,537
But not coming out of that fucking shark!

1942
01:41:21,583 --> 01:41:23,618
- Trev.
- Shut up, Coral!

1943
01:41:23,814 --> 01:41:25,123
You're in over you head.

1944
01:41:25,186 --> 01:41:27,029
You want it to stop, Trev?

1945
01:41:29,247 --> 01:41:30,919
Pull the trigger.

1946
01:41:33,228 --> 01:41:35,849
Because I can't stop no other way.

1947
01:41:40,947 --> 01:41:42,540
Help me.

1948
01:41:43,876 --> 01:41:46,931
You're the only one who understands.

1949
01:41:50,606 --> 01:41:52,156
Help me.

1950
01:41:55,784 --> 01:41:57,195
Do it.

1951
01:42:00,046 --> 01:42:01,507
Do it.

1952
01:42:06,594 --> 01:42:08,007
No!

1953
01:42:32,412 --> 01:42:33,462
OK!

1954
01:42:33,509 --> 01:42:35,876
- Forward!
- Go forward!

1955
01:42:35,907 --> 01:42:37,868
- Mum, move forward.
- Come on, Trevor!

1956
01:42:37,937 --> 01:42:39,273
Trevor!

1957
01:42:39,476 --> 01:42:40,546
Trevor!

1958
01:42:40,585 --> 01:42:41,975
- Trevor!
- Slowly!

1959
01:42:42,014 --> 01:42:43,663
- Mum, slowly!
- Slowly!

1960
01:42:43,702 --> 01:42:45,694
- Slowly!
- Slowly, Mum!

1961
01:42:45,733 --> 01:42:47,632
- Slowly!
- Slowly, Mum!

1962
01:42:47,677 --> 01:42:49,202
I'm going slowly.

1963
01:42:49,257 --> 01:42:50,499
Slowly!

1964
01:42:50,539 --> 01:42:51,928
Okay, easy.

1965
01:42:51,983 --> 01:42:53,467
That so insane!

1966
01:42:53,562 --> 01:42:55,480
Be careful, Trevor!

1967
01:42:55,973 --> 01:42:57,680
Easy does it.

1968
01:42:57,999 --> 01:42:59,116
- What?
- Give me the rope.

1969
01:42:59,163 --> 01:43:00,437
Chuck it now.

1970
01:43:00,544 --> 01:43:01,992
- I'm right.
- Okay.

1971
01:43:02,048 --> 01:43:03,860
Got it, yeah, I'm ready.

1972
01:43:04,310 --> 01:43:06,203
I've got it. I've got it!

1973
01:43:06,270 --> 01:43:08,696
When she clears the tank, pull.

1974
01:43:10,301 --> 01:43:12,558
I love you, you cunt.

1975
01:43:13,629 --> 01:43:16,254
You fucking mad bitch.

1976
01:43:17,768 --> 01:43:18,956
What now?

1977
01:43:19,061 --> 01:43:21,113
- Now?
- Now?

1978
01:43:21,288 --> 01:43:23,722
- No!
- Go!

1979
01:43:25,087 --> 01:43:26,470
No!

1980
01:43:27,337 --> 01:43:28,501
Oh, my God!

1981
01:43:50,018 --> 01:43:51,177
Shaz!

1982
01:43:52,146 --> 01:43:53,427
Shaz!

1983
01:43:53,748 --> 01:43:55,419
Trev!

1984
01:43:56,441 --> 01:43:58,044
Shaz!

1985
01:44:59,488 --> 01:45:01,391
He looks sorry.

1986
01:45:02,513 --> 01:45:06,071
He just wants me to show up
to his campaign launch, that's all.

1987
01:45:12,277 --> 01:45:14,071
Come on, Mum.

1988
01:45:14,423 --> 01:45:16,516
What would Shaz do?

1989
01:45:23,099 --> 01:45:25,271
Tell your father I will go...

1990
01:45:25,677 --> 01:45:27,318
under one condition.

1991
01:45:27,529 --> 01:45:29,388
